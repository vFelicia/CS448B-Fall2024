00:06 - keep an eye on the chat so welcome I'm
00:10 - kind of I'm about to introduce what's
00:12 - going to happen in this very special
00:13 - extra kind of a surprise but not really
00:16 - a surprise live stream please if you
00:19 - happen to be one of the first people
00:20 - tuning in live to this if you could let
00:22 - me know if the audio sounds okay in the
00:24 - chat and not spoiler alert I have a
00:26 - guest with me Jade if you could just

00:35 - Jane I see that there's a Trevor Clarke
00:38 - in the chat okay I'm gonna assume yes
00:39 - perfect great okay so I think I'm just
00:42 - gonna get started wow this is like the
00:43 - fastest I've ever started a live stream
00:45 - ever it hasn't even been one minute yet
00:46 - so my name is Dan this is yet another
00:49 - live stream on this YouTube channel that
00:51 - currently doesn't have a name and this
00:53 - is very special episode for those who
00:55 - have been following my channel one of
00:57 - the things that I've talked a lot about
00:58 - I've talked about a lot but haven't done
01:00 - too much with but I've done a little bit
01:01 - of experiment fourth is having more
01:03 - guests as part of this YouTube channel
01:05 - so the first I had an interview that you
01:08 - may have watched with Claire Kearney
01:09 - Volpe and Chauncey Fleet about
01:11 - accessibility and code and just today I
01:14 - published a tutorial by tiga brain about
01:19 - working with physical sensors and and
01:22 - Appy 5gs so now so now today what this
01:27 - is the first-ever livestream guest I
01:29 - even in fact have two microphones
01:31 - working working so that's a pretty big
01:34 - innovation for me technically and
01:36 - today's guest is a right here well she's
01:40 - not right here but her name is right
01:41 - here she's right over there
01:42 - Jane freaked off with his awkward thing
01:44 - which is standing out of the camera and
01:45 - we're gonna change places
01:47 - Jane freed off Jane is a independent
01:50 - game developer I encourage you to check
01:52 - out her website which will be linked in
01:54 - the description of this video after it
01:56 - gets archived online to see the games
01:58 - that she's made and the other kind of
01:59 - research and data and visualization
02:01 - projects that she's she works on and so
02:04 - I think what's particularly exciting
02:05 - about this for me a is just to have
02:07 - different voices as part of the channel
02:09 - talking about code and projects and
02:11 - things that that
02:12 - make and then also you know I've done a
02:14 - lot of tutorials about how to program
02:16 - stuff and yeah graphics and animation
02:18 - and logic and even a few quick and dirty
02:20 - like hey let's make space invaders or
02:22 - let's make flappy bird type type
02:25 - tutorials but I think thinking about the
02:28 - broader context of game design and what
02:30 - it means to actually build a game to
02:33 - release a game what kind of themes and
02:35 - what kind of stories you can tell with
02:36 - games and what goes into actually being
02:38 - an independent game developer I think is
02:40 - a exciting and interesting different
02:42 - perspective than something that I have
02:43 - to offer so I'm going to take this
02:46 - laptop with me over there and I'm going
02:49 - to interview introducing game but I'm
02:51 - going to bring her in to talk to you
02:52 - she'll talk for a little bit and then
02:54 - what I'm going to be doing over there is
02:56 - watching the chat so if you have
02:57 - questions or things you're thinking
02:58 - about that you want to ask Jane when she
03:01 - finishes a short presentation then we'll
03:02 - just have a brief conversation I'll ask
03:04 - some of the questions from the chat this
03:05 - is the first time I've tried this so
03:06 - we'll see how it goes
03:07 - so thank you for being here and watching
03:10 - Thank You Jane for being here and trying
03:12 - this experiment with me and now without
03:13 - further ado uh Jane welcome thanks for
03:18 - having me damn awkwardly slide in here
03:20 - hi everyone thanks for joining us on the
03:23 - live stream it's really amazing to be
03:24 - here I love dance videos um and I'm
03:27 - going to talk to you a little bit about
03:28 - some of my influences to become a game
03:30 - designer uh when designers talk
03:33 - sometimes we just stick to individual
03:35 - games that we like and like I grew up in
03:37 - arcade games my earliest memories are
03:39 - all in arcades um like like The Simpsons
03:42 - or Marvel or like Dance Dance Revolution
03:45 - um but we don't necessarily talk about
03:48 - like exactly what spurred us to either
03:51 - like me just saying that I love Grand
03:53 - Theft Auto which I did for a really long
03:54 - time doesn't really explain why I got
03:57 - into games and I feel like it's really
03:58 - interesting to hear about what inspires
04:00 - us about the field that we're in and so
04:03 - hopefully this will shed a little bit of
04:05 - light on the stuff that I do maybe
04:07 - you'll notice some own themes some
04:08 - themes like in the work that you all do
04:10 - um but yeah so let's let's get started
04:13 - so uh like I said Jane freehoff I'm
04:16 - going to talk a little bit about my
04:17 - interests and my influences and one of
04:21 - the things that was really exciting to
04:23 - me and thinking about this is that
04:25 - sometimes
04:26 - you don't really get the chance to talk
04:28 - about what inspires you especially if
04:31 - you're a person uh you know maybe like a
04:34 - woman or a person of color in games you
04:36 - know people ask you a lot about like
04:37 - what's it like to be you know person in
04:40 - games rather than like what brought you
04:42 - here and I love hearing the stories of
04:44 - what brings people to this field and one
04:47 - of the things that really brought me to
04:48 - this field was this belief that games
04:52 - can tell stories maybe their narrative
04:54 - also through mechanics in a way that
04:57 - really affects people like deep down
04:59 - that really gets them right in the gut
05:00 - and there's a kind of communication that
05:03 - you can have with people the same with
05:05 - like an amazing song or an amazing book
05:07 - where you realize that this thing
05:09 - expresses for you something that you
05:11 - didn't even realize that you fought in
05:13 - the first place and I think that's super
05:14 - exciting right like to me that's why
05:15 - games are as much an art form as any
05:17 - other right because they can do the same
05:19 - thing for us I'll tell you about the
05:21 - thing that did that for me in a minute
05:22 - Oh where's my mouse um first live stream
05:30 - okay cool so so also as game developers
05:33 - we don't really talk about the ways that
05:35 - we mess up right sometimes we make some
05:38 - really bad games and although I have
05:40 - many prototypes that were like true
05:43 - garbage um the one I'm going to talk
05:45 - about right now is a something that I
05:48 - realized later on was a game there was
05:50 - something that I used to do when I was a
05:51 - kid so like if you asked me when I
05:53 - actually started to be like a proper
05:55 - game developer I'd say okay well maybe
05:57 - when I was 17 I was interning at games
05:59 - companies maybe when I was 22 and that's
06:02 - like when I started to really like have
06:04 - stephane shows um but sometimes I think
06:06 - back to this uh game that I used to play
06:09 - with myself where I kind of thought
06:13 - about it as this game called face mush
06:14 - and the idea was that uh so you take
06:17 - your hands and you try to get your face
06:19 - to look like a model space right so high
06:21 - cheekbones like big eyes and all those
06:24 - sorts of things right and you sit in
06:25 - front of the mirror and you try and you
06:27 - try and you try to look like what
06:30 - everyone tells you that you should look
06:31 - like right and the wind condition for
06:34 - this terrible game was that you do it
06:35 - for the rest of your life right and it's
06:38 - not really the kind of game you could
06:39 - but I realized it was the kind of game I
06:41 - was playing with myself all the time and
06:44 - it wasn't because I grew up with people
06:46 - you know with like bad influences or
06:48 - anything I had family that was super
06:50 - supportive lots of people who took zero
06:52 - guff but there was this kind of
06:55 - messaging that was affecting me and
06:56 - maybe it's affected some of you too I
06:58 - was telling you that I wasn't enough you
07:00 - know something about me had to change
07:02 - that there was this bar and I was down
07:04 - here right and something something had
07:07 - to give
07:08 - right and it wasn't going to be the
07:09 - rules and you know whether that's
07:11 - through advertising or whether that's
07:12 - the messaging that you get through
07:14 - society you know that's there that's
07:15 - there for most of us in different ways
07:17 - so I would like try and try to get this
07:19 - performance right and feel less and less
07:21 - real as I screwed it up and I really
07:24 - hated it but it was really hard to see
07:26 - any other options it's hard to imagine
07:27 - any other way out um this may not seem
07:30 - like it links up to games but I think
07:32 - you'll see the link in a second so I
07:34 - don't know what changed right I likes I
07:37 - was this kid this insecure kid feeling a
07:40 - lot of pressure from the outside world
07:41 - and a lot of messages from society
07:44 - telling me that I had to be you or not
07:46 - being a certain way but one day I just
07:48 - had this like series of revelations out
07:50 - of nowhere I'm going to use Keanu Reeves
07:52 - tell me demonstrate them so that the
07:54 - right direction how do I not go into
07:56 - Keanu space so I knew that I didn't meet
07:59 - a lot of these standards right that
08:01 - society had set for me but all of a
08:02 - sudden I also realize like most people
08:05 - don't right kind of never see anyone
08:08 - where they hit the standard and then
08:09 - they're done they win you know those
08:11 - standards can always change the rug can
08:13 - be pulled out from you at any time and
08:15 - the wreck can be pulled out from you at
08:17 - any time it means okay well there's
08:20 - those things that are expected of you I
08:22 - don't really matter you know they shift
08:24 - a change they go back and forth and
08:25 - decided arbitrarily by other people
08:27 - right they're sort of just done because
08:31 - they can and so if those people were
08:34 - able to make up rules for me I realized
08:37 - that there wasn't any real reason why I
08:39 - just couldn't go ahead and make up my
08:40 - own rules right so like my rules for how
08:43 - I want to live for what I think is
08:44 - important right not win right like we're
08:47 - not like living under the under the like
08:49 - unite stay
08:50 - Jane or anything but they would at least
08:51 - be a respite from a lot of this other
08:54 - stuff going on through rules through my
08:56 - own valuations it kind of create my own
08:58 - little world and if I could make my own
09:00 - rules
09:01 - I can value whatever right uh I got told
09:05 - a lot that I was too loud or too weird
09:07 - or my hair was too curly or my nose was
09:09 - too big but in my world with this rules
09:12 - creations I can make it so that being
09:14 - loud was good and taking up room was
09:16 - good and have him curly hair was good I
09:18 - actually haven't made a game about curly
09:19 - hair yet but maybe I will so I realized
09:23 - through this rule creation I could
09:24 - create these sort of like alternate
09:26 - settings in which case in which I could
09:29 - value the things that I wanted right and
09:31 - if I am super stoked about this which I
09:34 - was this idea of creating this sort of
09:36 - alternate world for a period of time
09:38 - where I could be myself if I was soft
09:41 - about that there is no way that other
09:43 - people also weren't super pumped about
09:45 - that right I think most of us can relate
09:47 - to this idea of not always being able to
09:49 - be or express the people that we want to
09:51 - be and so if I'm super excited by the
09:54 - idea of using rules to make a separate
09:56 - world then probably a lot of other
09:58 - people are into that too and so if I can
10:01 - do that then I should do it right and it
10:05 - just like hit me all of a sudden it was
10:07 - like my like Keanu Reeves like whoa a
10:08 - moment but I looked like this so it's
10:11 - kind of like this okay I don't know if
10:14 - I'm doing it right so my mind was blown
10:17 - it was ridiculous um I don't know
10:19 - exactly why it happened but it did and I
10:22 - had this series of Revelations and I was
10:25 - super like totally drunk off it it felt
10:27 - like my role had been shaken up in this
10:29 - fundamental way right this idea that
10:31 - through the usage of different like
10:34 - rules and different settings we can
10:35 - create these alternate spaces for
10:37 - ourselves in which we can play with
10:39 - things in which we can be ourselves and
10:41 - do the things that we want to do and
10:43 - value things that we want to value and
10:45 - at the same time I'd no idea what to do
10:47 - that I was like 15 years old I don't
10:49 - know what to do with anything at that
10:50 - point uh and the closest thing that I
10:53 - could think about was sort of like the
10:56 - epoch of punk or culture jamming but
10:59 - those didn't really seem to like connect
11:00 - with
11:01 - super hard for whatever reason uh there
11:05 - we go but not after that I discovered
11:07 - riot girl and right girl like totally
11:11 - blew my mind
11:12 - it was super transformative for me to
11:15 - come across a group of other people
11:17 - special I think it's pipes okay filming
11:21 - live from Brooklyn um oh no we're in
11:24 - Manhattan aren't we looking all around
11:26 - um is that place check you're going yeah
11:33 - probably I don't see anyone [ __ ] does
11:37 - anyone else hear that water sound
11:41 - awfully coming from your computer look
11:44 - no I don't think so this was gonna be my
11:48 - big day in LA
11:50 - yeah it's getting yeah they do hear it
11:55 - in the chat hold on I don't hello
11:57 - everyone we're taking a brief pause for
11:59 - a second to figure out what's making
12:00 - this crazy extra weird sound is it let
12:04 - me see if it's something on this
12:05 - computer yeah because it's coming out of
12:07 - this computers hold on I can't matter
12:11 - what would be over here
12:12 - Oh oh my god what weight is this what's
12:17 - that livestreams now what is that sound
12:25 - it's
12:33 - let's check for the sick let me mute
12:36 - some of the audio sources sorry I'm like
12:38 - I'm like totally like a loss for what to
12:40 - do
12:45 - no it's the weirdest in the service area
12:50 - I don't know why but I had something
12:58 - running called airserver which is like I
13:00 - wonder if somebody's like white noise
13:03 - iOS app was like air playing into this
13:06 - oh my god that was a little bit crazy
13:08 - which maybe is appropriate for this law
13:10 - yeah okay we can go on and continue
13:14 - everything should be okay that was why I
13:16 - learned my mic back off okay okay cool
13:23 - whoa like what already kill your
13:28 - momentum no no it's fine it's fine
13:30 - no worries um but so basically um for me
13:34 - what this thing was was riot girl right
13:36 - and riot girl was this sort of punk-rock
13:38 - feminist movement that was very much
13:40 - about women making art that represented
13:42 - them and represented their lives and how
13:45 - a lot of issues right like I was kind of
13:47 - its target demographic like it had like
13:50 - race issues class issues but still for
13:52 - all of its faults it really like gave
13:54 - voice to the set of emotions that I had
13:57 - about the world that I didn't know how
13:58 - to process and these values that I
13:59 - didn't really know how to articulate um
14:03 - and so there's this thing called the
14:06 - right girl manifesto and for that that
14:08 - really like totally hypnotized me and
14:11 - there were a couple of lines that really
14:13 - spoke to me I really like the line
14:15 - because we girls want to create mediums
14:18 - that speak to us right this idea that
14:20 - we're going to create art music and zine
14:23 - zand that sort of thing that's speak
14:25 - really to us as people because anytime
14:27 - we get anything done we are creating the
14:29 - revolution right which is really nice
14:31 - and maybe the most important went to me
14:34 - because I need laughter and I need a
14:36 - girl love right this idea that these
14:38 - experiences can bring us together right
14:40 - and so seeing these people try to
14:42 - cultivate these things made me realize I
14:44 - wanted to do it too but uh for me like
14:48 - if you know me in real life you
14:50 - definitely don't want to hear me play
14:51 - music I'm not a very good artist either
14:53 - all of the art and these slides have
14:55 - been done by an artist friend of mine
14:56 - because it's not a good
14:58 - when I try to do it and for me what I
15:01 - had been really interested in up to that
15:02 - point was game design right and I don't
15:05 - even mean like super artsy artsy fartsy
15:07 - game design right at this point in my
15:09 - life I was like planning a lot of Grand
15:11 - Theft Auto I was playing a lot of like
15:12 - Katamari Damacy
15:13 - playing a lot of rez a lot of like weird
15:16 - little games but these ideas or well
15:20 - grant that thought it was in a weird
15:21 - little game but you know what I mean a
15:22 - big span of games
15:24 - um there weren't necessarily about this
15:26 - but I sort of had a moment where I
15:29 - wondered could there be a meeting point
15:31 - here right in games basically a lot of
15:34 - what we're doing regardless of like the
15:36 - content at the game regardless of
15:37 - whether we like dubbin an art game or an
15:40 - indie game or a serious game we're
15:42 - trying to use mechanics to tell some
15:44 - story about the world right our
15:46 - mechanics value certain things maybe
15:49 - they're like a little bit more wild in
15:51 - one game a little bit more tame in
15:52 - another but regardless they're sort of
15:54 - pointing at a world that could exist
15:56 - right or that does exist for a little
15:58 - while and to me why a girl also pointed
16:01 - at this right you go to a riot girl show
16:03 - you hop in the mosh pit you sing along
16:05 - you kind of have this feeling of
16:06 - connection that you're in this alternate
16:08 - world for a second and so I kept
16:10 - wondering like there's not really a lot
16:12 - of like right girl game it's right this
16:13 - happened in the 90s so I mean probably
16:16 - some of you are younger than me to be
16:18 - that's like you know when I was growing
16:20 - up and I really started to wonder you
16:23 - know not a lot of people were making you
16:25 - know it's like a flourishing indie
16:26 - culture back then so I started to think
16:28 - what how could we combine this right how
16:30 - can we mash this up and so this question
16:35 - nagged at me all throughout college into
16:37 - law school and then out of law school a
16:39 - year later when I dropped out and then
16:41 - finally into design school and then the
16:43 - indie scene if anyone ever like pretends
16:45 - to know what they're doing I can promise
16:46 - you that 99% of us don't uh but uh when
16:51 - I sort of arrived at design school I
16:53 - realized I wanted to take the things
16:54 - about the genre that I found so
16:55 - transformative and start applying their
16:57 - ideas directly to the mechanics of games
16:59 - and so for me what that meant was to
17:01 - make games that had certain values right
17:04 - like I was talking about with the first
17:05 - terrible game that I made I wanted to
17:07 - create games that had particular values
17:09 - that cared about certain things
17:10 - like the weird little game world that
17:12 - they created focused on these things
17:14 - like deliberately being messy sometimes
17:16 - all right giving yourself the space to
17:18 - be messy you ridiculous view over the
17:20 - top we don't really get that a lot
17:22 - creating these like very expressive
17:24 - spaces goes along with messiness
17:26 - sometimes being expressive is messy
17:28 - creating relationships through art not
17:31 - just with me art you know I didn't
17:32 - really want to make stuff where people
17:33 - would just look at it and then walk away
17:35 - I wanted to make something where people
17:37 - would sort of interact with each other
17:38 - through it like being in a mosh pit or a
17:40 - girl show and I really wanted to
17:42 - communicate with my audience directly
17:44 - not trying to like explain them to
17:45 - anyone else so I'll show you two games
17:49 - that I made I mean I've made a lot more
17:51 - games other than this but there are two
17:54 - games that I've made that I think really
17:55 - kind of speak to this spirit and this
17:57 - ethos so this first one is this still
18:00 - from a game called screw mom up and
18:02 - screw-up is a basically a two-player
18:04 - knockoff of space invaders but with two
18:06 - very crucial differences so let's play
18:09 - with the Kinect and a microphone it's
18:11 - two-player you work together so in order
18:14 - to move you hold this mic in your hand
18:16 - and you're tracked by a Kinect so I
18:18 - don't know if I have enough space over
18:20 - here so you have to run laterally up
18:22 - there I go into the void across to move
18:26 - your ship and you have to scream into a
18:28 - microphone in order to shoot I have a
18:31 - video let's see if this works
18:33 - yeah this is kind of like where's my
18:36 - head's in the way
18:38 - oh nice too hot
19:38 - I'm gonna awkwardly slide that video so
19:43 - um so you know I could talk about like
19:47 - the design choices in this game and the
19:49 - ways of hooking the tech up together and
19:51 - all of that is important but for me what
19:53 - I really wanted was to create a win
19:55 - condition in a game right in a wind
19:57 - condition just meaning something that
19:58 - you do to win oh I didn't make this
20:02 - video um uh I'm gonna close that cool
20:07 - then I'm gonna that cool okay so um so
20:14 - one condition is just something that you
20:15 - do to win the game right you want to
20:17 - score the most points or or whatever and
20:21 - the thing about them that's kind of
20:23 - great is that they sort of inherently
20:25 - justify whatever mechanic you used to
20:27 - achieve them right like if you think
20:29 - about it most of the games that we play
20:30 - a pretty silly right why don't we play
20:32 - golf instead of just picking up the golf
20:34 - ball walking over the hole and dropping
20:36 - it in right why do we use missing golf
20:39 - bets oh my god oh why do we use whatever
20:42 - using right like why do we use drivers
20:44 - and putters and that sort of thing when
20:45 - it's totally ridiculous right well we
20:49 - use them because the rules of a game
20:50 - require that we use them so we're gonna
20:52 - use them of course right we have to if
20:54 - we're gonna win we got to use them to
20:56 - hit the thing into the home and so
20:58 - reveal I sort of realized like I could
21:00 - take all these things that I really
21:01 - liked people being loud people being
21:03 - messy people having fun with each other
21:05 - people like running around in real life
21:08 - slamming into each other and I could
21:10 - kind of justify creating that alternate
21:13 - little space if I just made a game about
21:15 - it right and so um what I really felt
21:19 - was you're especially being told as a
21:21 - kid that I was like too loud it took up
21:24 - too much space or
21:25 - I decide too much uh I could take
21:28 - something that I felt self-conscious
21:30 - without in real life and just translate
21:32 - it into a game mechanic right giving me
21:34 - and other people this sort of release
21:36 - valve and this place to explore that
21:38 - kind of expression and I remember it was
21:40 - um was really gratifying because I
21:42 - brought this game to an outdoor festival
21:44 - and I was sort of like as with every
21:46 - game that I make I was like maybe only I
21:48 - think this is good maybe everyone else
21:50 - will hate it um you know people people
21:53 - in that hatton are cool you know they
21:54 - walk around and they look like they
21:56 - don't really care whatever uh but this
21:59 - like really steady flow of like
22:00 - initially you know very cool hipster
22:03 - people came by they would play it and
22:05 - all of a sudden they would like turn
22:07 - into feral animals right and screaming
22:10 - climbing on each other laughing shoving
22:13 - pushing and that was something I noticed
22:15 - didn't really end with the end screen
22:18 - the end screen would come up and they
22:20 - would laugh they would be hoarse uh and
22:22 - they would look at each other and they
22:24 - would look at me and say thank you and
22:25 - you could see that they had this kind of
22:27 - glint in their eye really excited like
22:30 - they had unlocked something and you know
22:32 - I don't want to say that games you know
22:35 - totally influenced behavior don't
22:36 - totally influence behavior but I think
22:38 - they can give us little spaces to be
22:40 - ourselves and to like discover different
22:42 - facets of ourselves and so it was really
22:44 - nice for me to grow up as a riot girl in
22:47 - mosh pits and that the see people leave
22:49 - my game with the same kind of like glint
22:50 - in their eye that I had coming out of
22:52 - those shows um my most recent releases a
22:57 - game called slam city oracles and it's
22:59 - really really tried to like infuse the
23:01 - whole thing with this practice one of
23:04 - the reasons I made slims to be oracles
23:05 - which is a two player arcade game is
23:07 - because installation games are really
23:10 - hard uh uh it turns out sometimes if the
23:13 - Sun Goes Down you're connect will break
23:15 - and no one tells you that in advance and
23:17 - there are 50 people who want to play
23:19 - your game in an outdoor festival and you
23:22 - figure it out
23:23 - so I really wanted to make something
23:25 - that could run on its own just go off
23:28 - into the world not need me to attend to
23:30 - it but basically the idea behind slam
23:33 - city oracles is that sort of like if you
23:36 - mashed a GTA and
23:38 - Annamarie dama she so you and your best
23:40 - friends the two-player collaborative
23:42 - game smash up this city to this riot
23:44 - girl soundtrack done by a local band so
23:46 - I'll play you
23:46 - oops not thank you yet soon they're not
23:49 - yet I'm gonna escape that I've done with
23:53 - my nuts they're spoilers uh plenty o
23:59 - like try to do it over here
24:01 - where's my head okay good oh by the way
24:05 - if you have photosensitive epilepsy
24:06 - please look away because there's lots of
24:08 - blinking lights thank you
24:13 - you
24:48 - one of my like proudest achievements was
24:50 - that I actually released on time which I
24:52 - really did not think was gonna happen at
24:55 - all um that was kind of a miracle thanks
24:58 - to everyone who helped me do it because
25:00 - I definitely do not do that alone I'm
25:03 - gonna put the presentation back here
25:06 - alright so um this was a really great
25:09 - experience because I got to work with
25:11 - and pay paying people is great a lot of
25:15 - people who had a lot of the same values
25:16 - as I did with regard to like making art
25:19 - that feels very much like this bright
25:21 - girl experience and again if you
25:25 - couldn't tell from the video the way
25:26 - that you win is you cause as much chaos
25:29 - as you can so you slam down make things
25:32 - fly around when you go up higher from
25:34 - aslim you can slam down again that makes
25:36 - it go even higher more things fly all
25:38 - around you have two minutes basically to
25:40 - cause as much destruction as you
25:41 - possibly can and again for me I really
25:45 - enjoyed this process of making a wind
25:46 - condition that valued the things that I
25:48 - wanted to value right like one of the
25:50 - major tenets of riot girl was taking up
25:53 - space right this idea that you don't
25:55 - shrink back you don't try to like lower
25:57 - your voice you don't try to just
25:59 - accommodate people around you you take
26:00 - up space uh metaphorically often obvious
26:04 - in some cases literally right like in
26:05 - this game it's all about taking up space
26:07 - all about like the impact of your
26:09 - physical self um in the world and
26:13 - another thing that really inspired me
26:15 - about this too is uh and I feel like
26:18 - this is a facet of the way that we think
26:19 - about like games that are serious or
26:22 - emotional or artsy but um this was
26:24 - actually a game that was really inspired
26:26 - by feeling like really vulnerable right
26:28 - really lonely there are a ton of women
26:30 - game developers there are a lot more now
26:32 - which is awesome and I mean I love all
26:34 - game developers have been amazing like
26:36 - mentors and influences on my life but
26:38 - there was a period of time where it felt
26:40 - really strange to be a woman games and I
26:42 - kind of fantasized about this place
26:45 - where I would just be invincible right
26:47 - you know cool me better Jane wouldn't be
26:51 - afraid to take up space you know would
26:53 - have would basically be invincible to
26:55 - anything else around her and so for me
26:57 - it kind of like with scream up which was
26:59 - all about giving yourself the excuse
27:01 - to take up space and be loud and
27:03 - basically better at it scream like you
27:05 - probably haven't done since you were
27:06 - about five or six this was very much
27:08 - about reclaiming a moment of feeling
27:10 - powerful feeling connected with other
27:12 - people and getting to miss things up and
27:17 - so so I think it's funny like you know
27:19 - we have this really like intense
27:21 - delineations about like what is art what
27:24 - is like serious or emotional we tend to
27:28 - think about it as like oh it has to be
27:30 - super autobiographical right but to me I
27:33 - really enjoy games that are sort of born
27:35 - out of the ways that people want to see
27:37 - the world right like and this is just
27:40 - the way that I see the world I'm sure
27:41 - that the people who are watching this
27:43 - channel all have their own influences
27:45 - and all have their different ways of
27:46 - seeing the world and I think one of the
27:48 - really exciting things about games is
27:49 - that again through this process of
27:51 - making rules through this process of
27:53 - sort of setting the narrative and
27:54 - through this process of determining what
27:56 - is it like what is the lane condition
27:58 - what's the main condition for you like
28:00 - what makes you happy what would be an
28:01 - interesting thing that you would want to
28:03 - do like it sounds kind of corny I get it
28:06 - but I think there's something really
28:07 - cool about making games about that
28:09 - because they kind of create these weird
28:11 - little like temporary utopias right
28:14 - where everything is different and in
28:16 - examples like this it's only different
28:17 - for about two minutes two and a half
28:18 - minutes it's a short song also it hurts
28:21 - to just slam the button over and over
28:22 - again by the you get to kind of create
28:26 - this alternate world where the stuff
28:28 - that you like that you value that you
28:30 - care about matters and what's even
28:31 - better is that with games you get to see
28:34 - other people experience it and see when
28:36 - they care about the things that you care
28:38 - about that you think matter and for me
28:41 - whenever I see people get that feral
28:43 - glint in their eyes for me
28:45 - that's my judgment for knowing that I've
28:46 - done something right so that's pretty
28:49 - much what I had to say um I appreciate
28:51 - all y'all bearing with me through the
28:53 - technical difficulties come on okay one
28:56 - question Zach yeah yeah so I'm gonna I'm
28:59 - gonna try we're gonna sort of like just
29:01 - rearrange ourselves you can no leave
29:03 - that there
29:03 - I mean we don't need just I think that's
29:05 - a nice background I'm gonna don't stand
29:06 - a little bit off to the side here yes so
29:09 - I'm gonna try so first of all in the CH
29:12 - I'm kind of keeping an eye on the
29:14 - and first Thank You Jane this was
29:16 - awesome thank you I love I've seen some
29:18 - rework before it was so great to hear
29:20 - like stories behind it and I think
29:22 - really just like super fun and
29:24 - interesting themes and exciting exciting
29:27 - stuff so I have a boy now there's even
29:29 - more people lots of positive feedback in
29:31 - the chat people really like the scream
29:33 - em up game and so so okay so fine so
29:37 - people are staying lots of thank-yous
29:39 - now so I think what I'll try to do this
29:41 - is we haven't tried this before so I'm
29:42 - kind of learning how to figure this out
29:44 - but I'm going to ask I note it down a
29:47 - bunch of the questions so I'm just gonna
29:49 - kind of go through them in sort of I'm
29:52 - gonna start with some of the technical
29:53 - ones first yeah um so bunch of people
29:55 - that had asked like what kind of
29:56 - programs what kind of programming
29:57 - languages what tools do you use to make
29:58 - these games or other games yeah totally
30:00 - should I look at you sure I don't know
30:02 - both yeah kill get me if you're the
30:06 - audience have a preference let me know
30:07 - so this is good so um I used unity unity
30:12 - 3d is a game model as a game development
30:15 - engine um you can use a couple of
30:16 - language of the community I use c-sharp
30:18 - because I've been working in like C++
30:20 - before and it seemed the most natural to
30:21 - me right um I primarily chose it because
30:23 - as a development team of one uh unity I
30:27 - guess one of the reasons why it's called
30:29 - that it exports to a lot of different
30:30 - platforms so you can make a game and
30:32 - then it exports to Mac to PC the iPhone
30:34 - to Android right like I think I like to
30:37 - blackberry I feel like I've seen that oh
30:40 - maybe I'm like super hallucinating um
30:43 - but for me it made a lot of sense
30:44 - because it really streamlined the
30:45 - workflow and let me like I was able to
30:47 - make a Linux build of this game right
30:48 - that works right like without any hassle
30:51 - which is not a sentence I've ever said
30:53 - about Linux I know that unity has like a
30:55 - free in a pro as well stuff you're doing
30:57 - like works under the free or you need
30:58 - primo for it yeah yeah yeah even the
31:00 - exporting is so you don't need the pro
31:02 - for that yeah I think yeah I think it
31:04 - like change used I think I'm like
31:05 - thinking about in an old way because I
31:07 - think it actually is now kind of like
31:08 - all free I think it's also like if your
31:09 - thing makes a certain amount of money
31:10 - then you have to get pro right um I
31:13 - haven't faced that like no uh and and
31:16 - the other thing I know like in
31:17 - particular with like slam
31:19 - city Oracle's here it looks like there's
31:20 - a lot of physics built into that game is
31:22 - that stuff that you're using from the
31:23 - built in
31:24 - yeah yeah so unity has really great
31:27 - physics both for 3d and 2d I know some
31:29 - people make their own but for me it was
31:31 - definitely definitely good enough it
31:34 - handles it pretty nicely there's like
31:35 - some garbage collection that I end up
31:37 - doing but um yeah it just kind of works
31:40 - it'll figure out where like so if you
31:42 - like have colliders and stuff objects
31:44 - like the characters you don't have to
31:46 - like trace that manually like figures it
31:48 - out for you that kind of thing I started
31:50 - building it in a different platform that
31:52 - didn't have like GUI right everyone's
31:58 - like show us the code well not not today
32:00 - god you don't want to see the code trust
32:02 - me all right so let's see I'm gonna I've
32:04 - got some more thematic questions by
32:06 - mistake with some of the technical stuff
32:08 - so so we've covered this on Holtz I'm
32:12 - trying to like use people's names from
32:13 - the chat but that first question by the
32:15 - way came from Jose came from Jose Thank
32:18 - You Jose
32:19 - and then um so one thing that I think is
32:22 - an interesting question that been asked
32:24 - in the chat um so it in particular for
32:26 - like the screaming up game yeah that you
32:28 - showed it like a festival
32:29 - it requires the Kinect maybe you built
32:31 - that with oh that was your open
32:34 - framework though we prorate you mention
32:35 - that open frameworks so how do you like
32:38 - is there oh dude does this does the
32:40 - Kenda game find an audience beyond this
32:42 - sort of like Festival or conference kind
32:44 - of circuit or just like an installation
32:45 - have you thought about that or is that
32:47 - been like part of struggle for you or
32:49 - yes what's it what's your thoughts on
32:52 - that no it's a great question and it
32:53 - totally depends I think it like again I
32:55 - think it depends on what your dev team
32:58 - sizes right because it's just you know
32:59 - the more platforms the more like
33:01 - overhead you require people to do right
33:03 - so the process for running screw up if I
33:06 - remember correctly cuz I made it a
33:07 - couple years ago you have to get an app
33:09 - on your iPhone because the iPhone
33:11 - transmits the sound data to the computer
33:13 - you have to hook up the connect to your
33:15 - computer then you have to make sure that
33:17 - they're both on the same network so OS
33:19 - seek communicate and have to make sure
33:20 - that like the port numbers and the IP
33:22 - addresses and everything all match up
33:23 - and like you know write that is intense
33:28 - that is a big ask and automating that
33:31 - kind of thing is like totally possible
33:33 - I'm trying to think about
33:35 - would have done that before but for me
33:37 - it just wasn't really feasible right
33:38 - right also like I'm very selfish and I
33:40 - mostly wanted to see people play the
33:42 - game yeah well there are like a lot of
33:44 - you know you have to you have to work at
33:46 - it you've got to apply but there are a
33:48 - lot of opportunities and a lot of times
33:49 - a lot of these games are the most fun in
33:51 - the sort of like crowd public simulated
33:53 - context totally but I think it's an
33:54 - interesting to think about you know a
33:57 - like finding the audience what's the
33:59 - right context for the audience the
34:00 - economics of like all this stuff like
34:02 - I'm just putting the stuff out there for
34:04 - people to feel joy which is a good thing
34:05 - but also like you know you want to be
34:08 - able to have a sustainable practice yeah
34:10 - this is why I don't make my money in
34:12 - games primarily thanks I have other jobs
34:14 - so this is kind of a related question I
34:19 - think which is from Kirpal from the chat
34:22 - rightz
34:23 - how would you recommend someone in high
34:25 - school who likes coding and gaming to
34:27 - sort of get into the game industry or
34:28 - get into internships College address
34:32 - that question that's a really good
34:33 - question so I feel like the thing that's
34:35 - nice about games at least nowadays is
34:38 - that it's such a wide field that it's
34:40 - not there's not necessarily one path
34:42 - right um I obviously took a pretty
34:44 - untraditional right there right I wrote
34:46 - down in my notes school question oh yes
34:48 - my like if I was gonna have any
34:50 - questions were at law school no idea
34:52 - that you went to law school that's crazy
34:53 - oh my god it's like this is the thing
34:55 - through is that I feel like um when we
34:58 - like our professional you know we have
34:59 - our CVS and our portfolios and it makes
35:01 - it look like we had anything figured out
35:03 - at any point in time I definitely did
35:05 - not like any way that's like a
35:07 - motivational speech for another day um
35:09 - so what was the question again
35:12 - it was no for a high school so how to
35:14 - begin yeah yeah so I think probably one
35:17 - of the best so let's say two things come
35:19 - to mind um one thing is actually they're
35:22 - both related so if you haven't done a
35:24 - game jam before I would say that's
35:26 - actually a really amazing opportunity I
35:28 - one of my first after interning in the
35:31 - games industry I kind of got back into
35:33 - games through game jams and if you
35:35 - haven't heard of a game jam before
35:36 - basically it's when a bunch of people
35:37 - get together for usually between like
35:40 - 24-48 hours
35:41 - some are longer some are shorter I went
35:43 - in a one-hour game jam on stage which I
35:47 - almost had a nervous breakdown
35:48 - but um
35:49 - but it's really nice because it kind of
35:52 - forces you to make something like at the
35:54 - end of that 48 hours you'll have
35:55 - something you'll have made your first
35:57 - game or your second game or your tenth
35:58 - game whatever and it also gets you out
36:01 - in meeting people right it's really
36:03 - tempting I know I do this all the time
36:05 - as a developer to kind of think I'm the
36:07 - indie developer I gotta like do
36:08 - everything I have to make the art I have
36:10 - to make sound is that and you'll find in
36:12 - these communities which are bigger than
36:13 - you think probably other people who are
36:16 - also interested in other people would
36:17 - probably think your idea is like awesome
36:19 - uh so so doing that together like gets
36:22 - you a portfolio piece it gets you some
36:23 - experience prototyping iterating and to
36:26 - me that's the most important thing
36:27 - actually the way that I got um the
36:30 - internship that I got in high school in
36:32 - the first place I mean it's a very
36:34 - different time ten years ago but uh but
36:37 - it was because I had made a game with a
36:39 - team over I want to stay like a six week
36:41 - program and some people from the games
36:43 - industry came and they saw it and they
36:45 - liked it and they liked me and they're
36:47 - like hey do you want to intern for us
36:48 - it's sort of like getting scouted as a
36:50 - model except like way different high but
36:54 - uh but yeah and so so I think that's one
36:57 - of the biggest things you can go to like
36:59 - conferences and conventions - those are
37:01 - super helpful but I often find that the
37:03 - people who um who show up there also
37:06 - show up to the game jams it's a little
37:07 - bit easier I guess someone who's like
37:09 - stood around with my little name tag and
37:11 - my drink like wanting to talk to people
37:13 - but being too shy it's a lot easier to
37:15 - go to someone at hour 36 at a game jam
37:17 - and go like hey I know you I like your
37:18 - work and get a conversation started
37:20 - they're cool um a couple of people were
37:22 - just asking now because you mentioned
37:23 - like you don't necessarily do
37:24 - independent game development full-time
37:25 - what is what what's your other like work
37:28 - that you do yeah I do all kinds of weird
37:30 - stuff uh so primarily what I do is um I
37:34 - do I protect tools which is not the most
37:38 - descriptive answer uh but uh so right
37:42 - now I work in a place called the office
37:44 - for creative research which is super
37:45 - amazing basically we're a studio that
37:49 - does a lot of like data and data
37:51 - analysis and data exploration in a very
37:54 - like socially oriented way so I just got
37:56 - off a project doing doing like a
37:59 - visualization of a census of elephants
38:01 - that took place over all of Africa
38:03 - oh this is like the Congo no that's that
38:06 - are lots of different yeah yeah those
38:08 - why my boss almost got like attacked by
38:10 - a lion which is a sentence I never
38:11 - thought I would say but uh I'm staying
38:14 - here yeah good cool
38:16 - um but uh but so uh so it is like weird
38:20 - and different um but I find that
38:22 - everything I do kind of orbits around
38:25 - people playing with each other like
38:27 - sometimes it's really explicit like the
38:29 - like the scream em up where you're like
38:31 - literally screaming and laughing and
38:32 - diving on each other like it's a game of
38:34 - football um but other times it's a
38:36 - little bit more subtle and it's about
38:38 - like how do people get curious how do
38:40 - people explore things um I'm really
38:43 - interested in that I actually sometimes
38:44 - think about myself as more of like a
38:47 - play designer than a game designer cuz
38:49 - that's what's really compelling to me
38:50 - and there's not like there's not a value
38:51 - judgement there yeah yeah we all need
38:53 - each other but uh but I find that that's
38:55 - what ties my practice together so um
38:58 - okay people are talking about game jams
39:00 - yeah there's another question why I've
39:02 - got so many okay gotcha
39:04 - we're we were to go for it well we'll go
39:06 - for a little longer answer somewhere I
39:07 - want to make sure I get to some of these
39:08 - um what this comes up a lot in with my
39:11 - tutorials and stuff that I've done
39:12 - people are always asking what we'll just
39:15 - turn a little background yeah yeah um
39:17 - what um like do you find that how much
39:19 - does like I'm rephrasing the question a
39:21 - little bit for my own question but how
39:23 - much does like math play a role in what
39:26 - you're doing and how much is that a
39:27 - struggle or how do you how do you deal
39:29 - with that you guys pay attention and
39:31 - trick please pay attention in trig
39:32 - because I didn't and I regret it so hard
39:35 - uh no it plays it has a huge influence
39:37 - actually um
39:40 - way more than I want to admit and that's
39:42 - probably honestly why to some degree I
39:45 - rely on outside sources um to get stuff
39:48 - done right like I'm not I'd like to say
39:50 - that I use your knees like engine
39:51 - because oh I didn't have time to write
39:53 - my own like let's be real I probably
39:55 - would not be able to write my own
39:56 - physics system but but uh you know you
39:58 - don't need to to realize your idea and I
40:00 - think the totally point is liked it you
40:02 - have something you want Express and so
40:03 - they want to communicate and you know
40:04 - sure it's an interesting academic
40:06 - exercise but if you understand I work so
40:08 - you can make it rip totally Express the
40:10 - idea then that's great totally totally
40:11 - but like definitely um it helps a lot uh
40:15 - I'm gonna help
40:16 - everywhere the way that I see it popping
40:18 - up a lot is what am i well my partner he
40:23 - does a lot of work with Perlin noise I
40:25 - hope you cover Berlin yes I have a nice
40:28 - tutorial Alice and so that is a way of
40:33 - making things seem really natural yes so
40:36 - sometimes like if you want and it means
40:37 - to look like they have a eye or they're
40:39 - moving around in a particular way you
40:40 - can add that and it doesn't feel so
40:42 - static you know what I mean it's sort of
40:43 - like you know if I walk around like this
40:45 - it feels a lot stiffer than me moving
40:47 - how it usually do so like using noise
40:48 - for example it's really important that
40:50 - same partner has a unit circle tattooed
40:52 - on him because that's how much he loves
40:54 - so uh so yeah I mean it's important but
40:57 - my attitude towards this is that one you
41:02 - know you realize your idea how you can
41:04 - no one no one who matters probably is
41:07 - gonna be like getting angry you about
41:09 - your code for no reason if they have
41:10 - nothing to do with it and like - there's
41:13 - always Stack Overflow like you know it's
41:18 - there for a reason and you shouldn't
41:19 - feel like you have to figure this out
41:20 - all by yourself in the start yeah
41:22 - awesome okay so I want to ask question
41:24 - which i think is particularly relevant
41:25 - especially like in light of things have
41:28 - been happening in the world in this
41:29 - country the ones the last week Jane and
41:31 - I are both wearing safety pins here so a
41:33 - jew jew jew writes in the chat she wants
41:34 - to know if you've dealt with sexism in
41:36 - your career and also what you think you
41:40 - your our role as as developers might be
41:42 - in resisting oppression and
41:44 - marginalization yeah
41:45 - that's an amazing question and I should
41:47 - probably preface it with the fact that
41:48 - like I can only speak to my own
41:50 - experience and there are some amazing
41:52 - critics who like come from different
41:54 - backgrounds than me like I obviously
41:55 - like I have white privilege right like
41:57 - that's just a fact I went to like design
41:59 - school that gives me like a certain
42:01 - level of closeted education privilege so
42:04 - I'm coming from there I can't speak for
42:05 - everyone obviously um but in terms of
42:08 - sexism yes there it's interesting
42:13 - because it's pretty rarely um you know
42:16 - it's usually not people coming up to and
42:17 - being like get out of our playground we
42:19 - don't like you right but it's things
42:21 - like I remember I was at a conference
42:23 - once I had developed a game with my
42:25 - partner he's a man I'm a woman we both
42:28 - were at the booth we
42:29 - - was a PlayStation Vita game we had
42:32 - Vita in front of each of us and I
42:35 - noticed that people primarily men would
42:38 - line up to talk to him so it was like a
42:40 - line like six or seven people deep to
42:41 - talk to him to fly his Vita and
42:43 - literally no one would come to me and
42:45 - even when people did maybe like oh are
42:48 - you the marketer are you the artist I
42:51 - was like I did the AI like yeah and
42:54 - don't get me wrong again
42:55 - god bless artists I cannot lie I not
42:58 - make any of my work without them this is
43:00 - not to denigrate artist or marketers but
43:01 - it was I would get this over and over
43:04 - and over again this sort of people call
43:06 - them microaggressions but this sort of
43:07 - like constant chipping away that's like
43:09 - oh I was at the Game Developers
43:11 - Conference lunch wearing a game wearing
43:13 - a badge from NYU Game Center has game in
43:16 - the title the Game Developers Conference
43:17 - which has game in the title and
43:19 - developer in the title um where my title
43:22 - said developer and someone came up to me
43:24 - and said oh sorry are you in games like
43:28 - would you ask my boyfriend like so it's
43:32 - very weird and it's something you kind
43:34 - of people can get better at it
43:36 - um to some degree you just have to like
43:38 - let it roll off your back a little bit
43:41 - um but it's hard and I mean it's it's
43:43 - really nice if you're a merchandise
43:45 - person of any stripe to find a community
43:47 - that understands you and that's super
43:49 - helpful and like you'll also find Ally's
43:51 - allies like where you don't necessarily
43:52 - expect like a lot this sounds like the
43:55 - famous like sentence but truly actually
43:58 - a lot of my most amazing allies are men
44:00 - right who have gotten me like the most
44:02 - the most help and the most opportunities
44:04 - um but it is really nice to have spaces
44:07 - where people understand you know I
44:08 - remember talking to people and then
44:10 - being like oh oh I guess I didn't
44:13 - realize that right um in terms of what
44:17 - was the exact question I mean I think I
44:19 - have a couple follow-up yeah that's well
44:21 - one I guess it's like so one of the
44:22 - things that with p5.js which is a
44:24 - JavaScript framework that I do a lot of
44:26 - tutorials about started by Lauren
44:27 - McCarthy really started with this ethos
44:30 - of you know the tool know tool is
44:33 - neutral and a tool like has the sort of
44:35 - biases of the creators and it's really
44:37 - important to have all voices of the
44:38 - table and also creating like this place
44:40 - that can be a community for people who
44:41 - might feel like I'm not include
44:43 - in open-source projects this could be a
44:44 - place where I could feel that way and I
44:46 - you know I guess I'm wondering are there
44:48 - some or they're like um you know online
44:51 - communities or web sites or like a
44:53 - conference I know there's like
44:54 - initiatives like Phoenix Perry's coat
44:56 - Club which we're kind of information are
44:58 - you co-founder that two-second gain and
45:00 - Phoenix s a code liberation which is a
45:03 - wonderful organization are there other
45:05 - things that you can I mean to put you on
45:07 - the spot like a gov there's a time we
45:09 - can answer the links in the description
45:10 - yeah that's a really great question the
45:12 - ones off the top that I had off the time
45:14 - I had that I know it again they're
45:15 - mostly like women oriented because I am
45:17 - a woman and that's what I was looking at
45:18 - like I know pixels this girl this good
45:21 - girls make games is good we code
45:24 - liberation did a like collaboration
45:26 - workshop with black girls code which is
45:29 - an amazing organization I keep thinking
45:32 - I'm not totally sure in terms of tools
45:34 - though like that's actually the most
45:36 - exciting thing to me about um the last
45:39 - while in indie games because like when I
45:41 - was the first game I ever made aside
45:43 - from the way I talked about the
45:44 - presentation one of the earlier like
45:45 - program games that I can remember is
45:47 - like a text adventure really some
45:50 - language that like super doesn't exist
45:52 - anymore like a lot of the people that I
45:53 - know maybe their first games I'm like
45:55 - ms-dos and I'll tell you it's not the
45:57 - most user-friendly system uh and what I
45:59 - think it's great is that there's been
46:01 - this real explosion and tools that are
46:02 - available and they really work with like
46:05 - a diff different um like genre so you
46:08 - want to do it but also a lot of
46:09 - different learning styles and thinking
46:10 - styles so like your twine for text games
46:14 - is very much about like connecting
46:15 - passages or even like game maker has a
46:18 - sort of logic blocks and actually you
46:20 - can have code blocks in there too so as
46:22 - you start to like feel more comfortable
46:24 - maybe you rely less on the logic blocks
46:26 - and more on the code blocks maybe you
46:27 - start watching some tutorial to thank
46:29 - you uh but I think that's really amazing
46:31 - like I I think that's totally spot on
46:34 - that no tool is like a political and I
46:36 - actually think that's like it's really
46:37 - exciting when people make their own
46:38 - tools but I think having like a
46:41 - biodiversity of tools right is really
46:43 - great like it only supports more people
46:45 - making games awesome let's see if I'm
46:48 - going to just try to like wrap up and
46:49 - there
46:50 - a bunch of questions people are in the
46:54 - chat let's see it is an interview about
46:56 - interactive fiction yes interactive
46:57 - fiction okay um so one other I guess the
47:02 - so one other question I think is kind of
47:04 - actually is a good one to ask also asked
47:06 - by Jose is just about how long it takes
47:09 - you two for any of these projects look
47:10 - at these games how long did you work on
47:12 - them yeah hello how do you allocate the
47:14 - time for that
47:15 - totally what's that process well mine is
47:17 - usually very unhealthy uh so um it
47:20 - really depends there are a lot of small
47:23 - like there are a lot of games dynamic at
47:24 - game jam so to take a very short amount
47:26 - of time there are games where all do a
47:27 - lot of work on them at first and then
47:29 - kind of like letting life happen and
47:31 - then pick them up later
47:32 - slam city Oracle was kind of a totally
47:34 - ridiculous like thing that I could only
47:36 - do because I was young uh it was like
47:39 - two years ago anyway yes it counts um
47:42 - but I I made it in like six weeks
47:45 - because I had a deadline that I couldn't
47:47 - mess so I took a week of baking like I
47:50 - took one of my weeks of vacation from
47:51 - work and I just worked on it the entire
47:53 - time I wouldn't really recommend doing
47:55 - that um it's definitely really important
47:58 - to like balance self-care um I can show
48:00 - like so what's kind of interesting if we
48:03 - have a second I'll show it cuz I kind of
48:04 - love it where do my video go where's my
48:09 - oh there it is great so um something
48:12 - that I something that I really like talk
48:15 - to people a lot about is how important
48:16 - it is to prototype and how like weird it
48:19 - is how sorry okay so so the thing about
48:23 - slam City this is a blog post of mine
48:26 - called finding the fun which you can see
48:27 - on kamasutra um where is my awesome uh
48:30 - so this is what slime city oracles looks
48:32 - like now but what slaps on your elbows
48:35 - look like when I started was this like
48:38 - literally that's it this is not the most
48:41 - inspiring thing in the world right I I
48:43 - refer to typing this and being like I'm
48:46 - a failure I'll never make another game
48:47 - this is like what how is this all loops
48:50 - it's just good yeah that means a half an
48:52 - hour has passed
48:53 - shuts off on man gotcha gotcha and like
48:56 - this was it this is where I started and
48:58 - if I looked at other games it was like
49:00 - how does this stack up to journey like
49:02 - that's bad um but it's kind of necessary
49:06 - to start here you know you find what you
49:09 - find is fun right like I was playing
49:10 - this with my partner we kind of realized
49:12 - that this ridiculous little bouncing
49:14 - ball game we kept doing it we kept
49:16 - throwing each other up and slamming each
49:17 - other down and so it can take a really
49:19 - long time to get through that iterative
49:21 - cycle but it's and how you'll get there
49:23 - how do you fold in like user testing
49:25 - like so yeah you try to do that like
49:26 - continuously you just like gather your
49:29 - friends it's can you put stuff online to
49:31 - user test like yeah uh so what I
49:34 - typically do it totally depends on like
49:36 - how big your audience is and like
49:38 - whether you're coming out of your
49:39 - bedroom or whether you have like a legit
49:41 - game development shop but uh but uh I
49:43 - user test it every turn and usually the
49:47 - way I frame it is for each prototype I
49:50 - try to have that prototype address
49:53 - something right
49:54 - so is it fun to slam down is it fun to
49:57 - throw other people up turns out that
49:58 - that second one was not fun it was just
50:00 - confusing right so I try to think of a
50:02 - very specific question that I can answer
50:03 - through code I see if people respond to
50:06 - it if it works and if it doesn't I throw
50:08 - it out um and so it's a lot of iterating
50:10 - you buy a lot of pizza and beer for your
50:12 - friends ah my facebook messages about
50:15 - testing got way let's go here and as the
50:17 - development went on um but there are
50:20 - also a lot of play testing events uh I
50:22 - guess not all obviously not all of you
50:24 - were in New York City but for example in
50:26 - New York City there are play testing
50:27 - events that happen at Parsons The New
50:29 - School for Design at the game center
50:31 - I believe play crafting also has events
50:34 - basically if you look up like indie game
50:36 - development in your city or play testing
50:37 - in your city I think I'll probably be
50:38 - surprised at what you find and you can
50:40 - also send your prototypes to people here
50:43 - and I mean yeah yeah especially if you
50:44 - know them and you like their work
50:46 - usually they'll be down cuz they were
50:48 - also like totally insecure about their
50:51 - projects ones I know I was in continue
50:53 - to think okay so wait now I realized
50:57 - that I forgot that there were some
50:59 - questions posted on Twitter because I
51:01 - was like oh that's good I have some
51:03 - questions just in case there are no
51:04 - questions but there's so many questions
51:05 - in the chat so and
51:07 - some of them came from Angela who I also
51:08 - see is posting in the chat so let me let
51:11 - me go see if I can quickly go to my
51:13 - Twitter notifications here and let me
51:19 - find some of these questions ok so I
51:27 - think we've talked about some of these
51:28 - but there are so Angela I'm gonna ask
51:31 - two questions from at Angela Wineman on
51:34 - Twitter one from Twitter and one from
51:35 - the chat one is that do a kind of like
51:38 - non-digital games card games
51:40 - role-playing games board games how does
51:43 - play a role in your thinking and your
51:45 - practice I mean I know for me like I
51:47 - just love playing oh my god those kind
51:48 - of games and often I'm thinking about
51:50 - making computer versus of course I never
51:53 - do that but yeah I love them so I don't
51:56 - I don't tend to make a ton of them but
51:59 - they were definitely how I learned game
52:00 - design and I feel like one of the
52:02 - reasons why they're so hopeful is
52:03 - because they really forced you to strip
52:04 - things down and when I've taught game
52:06 - design before I'll run into students and
52:09 - I totally get it this is why I got into
52:10 - games where they're like on make a game
52:12 - it's gonna have this art and this music
52:14 - and this narrative I'm like that's great
52:16 - what's your like what's the what do you
52:19 - do right or do you just have like a
52:21 - theme um and that's not bad but I feel
52:24 - like starting with analog games really
52:26 - helps you like understand what mechanics
52:28 - work and what done right because you
52:29 - can't you can't be like oh this deck of
52:31 - playing cards is going to be like so
52:33 - emotionally resonant that it will do all
52:34 - the work for me so that's really great
52:37 - it really teaches you like about how to
52:38 - manipulate systems and how to like
52:40 - create those systems I still make um
52:42 - card games and like public space games
52:45 - occasionally I made a game recently
52:47 - called muscle-bound glory uh and it's a
52:51 - game where if you've ever seen like haze
52:53 - ever seen like an 80s action movie yes
52:55 - where it's like okay just making sure
52:57 - where they have like the really cheesy
52:58 - lines when they like finally like how
53:01 - the bad the bad guy you know what I mean
53:03 - like I want to treat you like garbage
53:04 - doesn't like kick you into this puzzle
53:06 - or whatever um so it's a game about that
53:08 - so you draw three cards it's like a
53:11 - situation a villain and a weapon or
53:14 - something like that I don't totally
53:15 - remember and as a group you have to try
53:18 - to or well individually
53:19 - you compete to make the best cheesy
53:22 - punny line that you can write and you
53:25 - kind of deliver them with like these you
53:27 - know poses and these like props and
53:30 - stuff and just really goofy and
53:32 - ridiculous I love I'm actually it you
53:35 - know it sort of strikes me to that one
53:36 - thing that it's done I think it's kind
53:39 - of interesting to think about is also
53:40 - like if you're planning to make a
53:42 - digital game like is there like a paper
53:44 - prototype version of it oh yeah oh yeah
53:46 - really great way to think through an
53:47 - idea solutely to like get user testing
53:50 - yeah you know I always I know like I
53:51 - doing all these tutorials this fall
53:53 - about text analysis and I'm often
53:55 - talking about like it actually is really
53:56 - good to just like get the physical book
53:58 - open it and like do the text analysis by
54:00 - reading the text that's in your line and
54:03 - like making notes with a pencil because
54:04 - that will sort of give you the clues to
54:06 - how the algorithm how the code has to be
54:08 - written
54:08 - yeah and allow you to kind of like slow
54:09 - that pace down to like think through the
54:11 - problem that's totally just like pencil
54:13 - sketches and like swapping them out and
54:15 - that's the kind of thing that I think is
54:16 - easy to forget when you're just like I'm
54:18 - gonna program this I got a perfectly
54:19 - well it's so like relatively speaking
54:21 - well both in terms of materials and time
54:23 - that's so much more low cost right like
54:25 - I I felt way working ideas than I do and
54:28 - it's really nice to not waste you know a
54:30 - week a month programming something and
54:32 - then find out that it's not any good
54:33 - than to just do it in a paper prototype
54:35 - yeah go this definitely doesn't work
54:37 - yeah and be done with it and move on
54:39 - yeah oh boy so many questions we're
54:41 - gonna so I think we're probably need to
54:43 - wrap up soon I think like an hour is a
54:44 - good amount of here for these two you
54:47 - know to not overburden our guests here
54:49 - um but let's me on Twitter let me yes
54:51 - and so but will looking at all that
54:53 - second at the end oh yeah no no you give
54:55 - that now yes you definitely do hit ask
54:57 - more questions to Jane on Twitter but I
55:00 - do you want to ask this other question
55:01 - from Angela which I can't seem to find
55:03 - right now but I saw it anyway so are
55:05 - there some people that are your kind of
55:07 - like major influences or people that you
55:09 - really admire I know this is one of
55:10 - these like pajamas all right yeah I mean
55:13 - we're so many you can think of them
55:14 - later and tweet these names you know
55:16 - it's okay I can do it
55:17 - people that you admire other I guess
55:18 - another way to phrase this question that
55:20 - might feel less like awkward to answer
55:21 - is like hey if you're interested in
55:22 - games also check out like these other
55:24 - indie developers oh my god that's also a
55:26 - really hard question sorry I'll start
55:28 - with my influence
55:29 - because or with my like inspirations
55:31 - because I've thought about that a lot
55:32 - because I like like oh what am I ever
55:34 - gonna be as good as them but uh so um
55:37 - Keita Takahashi is amazing
55:39 - he is the developer of kata married
55:42 - Amish oh yeah if you've ever seen it he
55:44 - did an amazing installation with baby
55:46 - castles where he basically dreamed up a
55:48 - bunch of like super weird installation
55:50 - games and they executed them in this
55:52 - museum so one of them was like a
55:53 - side-scrolling game and if you play a
55:55 - side-scrolling game it's like maybe
55:56 - you're a ship over here and you move
55:59 - through space in the background with
56:00 - behind you except this is rural about
56:02 - that Hey there you go um by that this
56:05 - side-scrolling game actually instead of
56:07 - having the background scroll the ship
56:09 - scrolled across about five or six
56:11 - monitors scattered throughout the space
56:13 - oh that's cool and to me that was just
56:14 - so like so I love that kind of stuff
56:16 - that plays with the forum and the medium
56:18 - I forget the the guys name the developer
56:21 - of res res is uh it was like on the
56:24 - Dreamcast which like oh my god so uh but
56:28 - uh it was a game that really attempted
56:30 - to sort of create the sensation of
56:32 - synesthesia which is like I don't think
56:35 - I'd come up with a dictionary definition
56:36 - of synesthesia but like the blurring of
56:39 - senses you know and and so that was
56:43 - really amazing that was one of the first
56:45 - like music games that really like
56:46 - totally struck me so there's a lot of
56:49 - things like that yeah I can probably
56:50 - write a whole post on like the weird old
56:52 - games that I like oh man
56:55 - in terms of current developers this is
56:56 - way harder because I would be
56:58 - heartbroken how can I plant this this
57:00 - Twitter yeah yeah yeah define okay so
57:02 - first of all sorry there's a lot of
57:03 - questions that shot about like what
57:05 - programming language should you start
57:06 - with what program language should I
57:07 - learn and so we did if you some of you
57:09 - might be tuning in late you can kind of
57:11 - roll back at when this archive gets
57:12 - published and we did discuss some of
57:14 - that stuff about different tools that
57:15 - Jane is using so um somebody said I
57:20 - think I was like scratching the mic by
57:22 - accent okay I should stop looking at I
57:24 - have a problem of like looking at the
57:25 - chat and I get very distracted by it's
57:27 - kind of a problem I also have this Bell
57:29 - which I don't know what to do it but I
57:31 - thought I needed a Bell yeah I'm using
57:32 - this Bell as like it's a thank you to
57:34 - Jane yeah um so this is really awesome
57:36 - and like super inspirational and like
57:39 - really fun a good experiment and
57:41 - challenge for me to sort of think about
57:43 - guests and interviews and that type of
57:44 - thing which and I think I would say
57:45 - thumbs up at least on your part you
57:47 - didn't write man so if you guys are
57:50 - interested in learning more about Jane's
57:52 - work yeah you can go to her website
57:55 - which is Jane free.com and also you can
57:58 - see her Twitter handle right yeah see my
58:02 - name yeah that's it
58:02 - so feel free to I could look up feel
58:05 - free to ask questions to Jane also you
58:07 - can ask questions with me on Twitter
58:08 - send us your feedback write in the
58:10 - comments and maybe you know I'm gonna
58:14 - have more guests maybe you could come
58:15 - back and we can make a new game show it
58:17 - or you can you know maybe we'll I'll
58:19 - think about if there are some I don't
58:21 - really do unity I like sugar and
58:23 - everything but if I can think what I
58:25 - like to sort of think about too is if
58:26 - there like some themes that came up I
58:27 - can do some tutorials kind of like
58:29 - around those themes I'm young think
58:30 - about that so if anyone got an idea of
58:32 - like oh how do you do X from this video
58:34 - then you could let me know so that's my
58:36 - parting words I have this really
58:38 - ridiculous thing that I do which is that
58:40 - I'm just gonna put on this I'll play you
58:42 - out with the redacted edited blurts he
58:46 - was talking and trailer one of these
58:47 - days we'll have a new one and um thank
58:50 - you for tuning in thank you again Jane I
58:53 - and um so this video by the way as soon
58:56 - as it finishes you won't be able to see
58:58 - it on YouTube but sometime later tonight
59:00 - or tomorrow we'll be back and I'll post
59:01 - on Twitter and will appear in the feed
59:03 - and that sort of thing so thanks for
59:05 - watching I'm always like I can't ever
59:07 - stop yeah but does are look it says 59
59:10 - minutes and 11 seconds which is just
59:11 - like perfect so and I apologize if I
59:13 - missed your question please send me up
59:15 - write it in the comments send me a tweet
59:17 - send the tweet to Jane uh hopefully we
59:19 - can well hear from anybody who got
59:20 - missed okay so I'm gonna hit uh oh no
59:23 - whoops first I'm gonna hit this okay
59:34 - did you
59:36 - that learning coding would be really
59:38 - rough throw your hands up in the air and
59:40 - saying nothing not do you was allergic
59:43 - code and make some awesome stuff learn
59:45 - it anyone can when you're coding with
59:47 - Dan
59:55 - whether you're a power this is open you
60:00 - Burnie overarching concepts and some fun
60:03 - stuff too and with Dan as your guide
60:05 - come along for the ride
60:10 - make a crazy pixel mirror to reflect
60:13 - your face you can make it jump to
60:15 - Lightspeed into outer space you can
60:17 - generate a maze that can go on for days
60:20 - you can make your own terrain and some
60:22 - purple red you can make a retro game to
60:25 - see how it's done and then tweak a piece
60:27 - to make it yours for everyone make some
60:30 - fresh deleterious or Twitter but if you
60:32 - please and when the scissors
60:42 - right the colors of code

Cleaned transcript:

hello I think I am live this is how every live stream starts I'm going to keep an eye on the chat so welcome I'm kind of I'm about to introduce what's going to happen in this very special extra kind of a surprise but not really a surprise live stream please if you happen to be one of the first people tuning in live to this if you could let me know if the audio sounds okay in the chat and not spoiler alert I have a guest with me Jade if you could just like say hello my name is Jane just to hear if your mic is working hi my name is Jane okay so let me know in the chat could you hear me and could you hear Jane I see that there's a Trevor Clarke in the chat okay I'm gonna assume yes perfect great okay so I think I'm just gonna get started wow this is like the fastest I've ever started a live stream ever it hasn't even been one minute yet so my name is Dan this is yet another live stream on this YouTube channel that currently doesn't have a name and this is very special episode for those who have been following my channel one of the things that I've talked a lot about I've talked about a lot but haven't done too much with but I've done a little bit of experiment fourth is having more guests as part of this YouTube channel so the first I had an interview that you may have watched with Claire Kearney Volpe and Chauncey Fleet about accessibility and code and just today I published a tutorial by tiga brain about working with physical sensors and and Appy 5gs so now so now today what this is the firstever livestream guest I even in fact have two microphones working working so that's a pretty big innovation for me technically and today's guest is a right here well she's not right here but her name is right here she's right over there Jane freaked off with his awkward thing which is standing out of the camera and we're gonna change places Jane freed off Jane is a independent game developer I encourage you to check out her website which will be linked in the description of this video after it gets archived online to see the games that she's made and the other kind of research and data and visualization projects that she's she works on and so I think what's particularly exciting about this for me a is just to have different voices as part of the channel talking about code and projects and things that that make and then also you know I've done a lot of tutorials about how to program stuff and yeah graphics and animation and logic and even a few quick and dirty like hey let's make space invaders or let's make flappy bird type type tutorials but I think thinking about the broader context of game design and what it means to actually build a game to release a game what kind of themes and what kind of stories you can tell with games and what goes into actually being an independent game developer I think is a exciting and interesting different perspective than something that I have to offer so I'm going to take this laptop with me over there and I'm going to interview introducing game but I'm going to bring her in to talk to you she'll talk for a little bit and then what I'm going to be doing over there is watching the chat so if you have questions or things you're thinking about that you want to ask Jane when she finishes a short presentation then we'll just have a brief conversation I'll ask some of the questions from the chat this is the first time I've tried this so we'll see how it goes so thank you for being here and watching Thank You Jane for being here and trying this experiment with me and now without further ado uh Jane welcome thanks for having me damn awkwardly slide in here hi everyone thanks for joining us on the live stream it's really amazing to be here I love dance videos um and I'm going to talk to you a little bit about some of my influences to become a game designer uh when designers talk sometimes we just stick to individual games that we like and like I grew up in arcade games my earliest memories are all in arcades um like like The Simpsons or Marvel or like Dance Dance Revolution um but we don't necessarily talk about like exactly what spurred us to either like me just saying that I love Grand Theft Auto which I did for a really long time doesn't really explain why I got into games and I feel like it's really interesting to hear about what inspires us about the field that we're in and so hopefully this will shed a little bit of light on the stuff that I do maybe you'll notice some own themes some themes like in the work that you all do um but yeah so let's let's get started so uh like I said Jane freehoff I'm going to talk a little bit about my interests and my influences and one of the things that was really exciting to me and thinking about this is that sometimes you don't really get the chance to talk about what inspires you especially if you're a person uh you know maybe like a woman or a person of color in games you know people ask you a lot about like what's it like to be you know person in games rather than like what brought you here and I love hearing the stories of what brings people to this field and one of the things that really brought me to this field was this belief that games can tell stories maybe their narrative also through mechanics in a way that really affects people like deep down that really gets them right in the gut and there's a kind of communication that you can have with people the same with like an amazing song or an amazing book where you realize that this thing expresses for you something that you didn't even realize that you fought in the first place and I think that's super exciting right like to me that's why games are as much an art form as any other right because they can do the same thing for us I'll tell you about the thing that did that for me in a minute Oh where's my mouse um first live stream okay cool so so also as game developers we don't really talk about the ways that we mess up right sometimes we make some really bad games and although I have many prototypes that were like true garbage um the one I'm going to talk about right now is a something that I realized later on was a game there was something that I used to do when I was a kid so like if you asked me when I actually started to be like a proper game developer I'd say okay well maybe when I was 17 I was interning at games companies maybe when I was 22 and that's like when I started to really like have stephane shows um but sometimes I think back to this uh game that I used to play with myself where I kind of thought about it as this game called face mush and the idea was that uh so you take your hands and you try to get your face to look like a model space right so high cheekbones like big eyes and all those sorts of things right and you sit in front of the mirror and you try and you try and you try to look like what everyone tells you that you should look like right and the wind condition for this terrible game was that you do it for the rest of your life right and it's not really the kind of game you could but I realized it was the kind of game I was playing with myself all the time and it wasn't because I grew up with people you know with like bad influences or anything I had family that was super supportive lots of people who took zero guff but there was this kind of messaging that was affecting me and maybe it's affected some of you too I was telling you that I wasn't enough you know something about me had to change that there was this bar and I was down here right and something something had to give right and it wasn't going to be the rules and you know whether that's through advertising or whether that's the messaging that you get through society you know that's there that's there for most of us in different ways so I would like try and try to get this performance right and feel less and less real as I screwed it up and I really hated it but it was really hard to see any other options it's hard to imagine any other way out um this may not seem like it links up to games but I think you'll see the link in a second so I don't know what changed right I likes I was this kid this insecure kid feeling a lot of pressure from the outside world and a lot of messages from society telling me that I had to be you or not being a certain way but one day I just had this like series of revelations out of nowhere I'm going to use Keanu Reeves tell me demonstrate them so that the right direction how do I not go into Keanu space so I knew that I didn't meet a lot of these standards right that society had set for me but all of a sudden I also realize like most people don't right kind of never see anyone where they hit the standard and then they're done they win you know those standards can always change the rug can be pulled out from you at any time and the wreck can be pulled out from you at any time it means okay well there's those things that are expected of you I don't really matter you know they shift a change they go back and forth and decided arbitrarily by other people right they're sort of just done because they can and so if those people were able to make up rules for me I realized that there wasn't any real reason why I just couldn't go ahead and make up my own rules right so like my rules for how I want to live for what I think is important right not win right like we're not like living under the under the like unite stay Jane or anything but they would at least be a respite from a lot of this other stuff going on through rules through my own valuations it kind of create my own little world and if I could make my own rules I can value whatever right uh I got told a lot that I was too loud or too weird or my hair was too curly or my nose was too big but in my world with this rules creations I can make it so that being loud was good and taking up room was good and have him curly hair was good I actually haven't made a game about curly hair yet but maybe I will so I realized through this rule creation I could create these sort of like alternate settings in which case in which I could value the things that I wanted right and if I am super stoked about this which I was this idea of creating this sort of alternate world for a period of time where I could be myself if I was soft about that there is no way that other people also weren't super pumped about that right I think most of us can relate to this idea of not always being able to be or express the people that we want to be and so if I'm super excited by the idea of using rules to make a separate world then probably a lot of other people are into that too and so if I can do that then I should do it right and it just like hit me all of a sudden it was like my like Keanu Reeves like whoa a moment but I looked like this so it's kind of like this okay I don't know if I'm doing it right so my mind was blown it was ridiculous um I don't know exactly why it happened but it did and I had this series of Revelations and I was super like totally drunk off it it felt like my role had been shaken up in this fundamental way right this idea that through the usage of different like rules and different settings we can create these alternate spaces for ourselves in which we can play with things in which we can be ourselves and do the things that we want to do and value things that we want to value and at the same time I'd no idea what to do that I was like 15 years old I don't know what to do with anything at that point uh and the closest thing that I could think about was sort of like the epoch of punk or culture jamming but those didn't really seem to like connect with super hard for whatever reason uh there we go but not after that I discovered riot girl and right girl like totally blew my mind it was super transformative for me to come across a group of other people special I think it's pipes okay filming live from Brooklyn um oh no we're in Manhattan aren't we looking all around um is that place check you're going yeah probably I don't see anyone [ __ ] does anyone else hear that water sound awfully coming from your computer look no I don't think so this was gonna be my big day in LA yeah it's getting yeah they do hear it in the chat hold on I don't hello everyone we're taking a brief pause for a second to figure out what's making this crazy extra weird sound is it let me see if it's something on this computer yeah because it's coming out of this computers hold on I can't matter what would be over here Oh oh my god what weight is this what's that livestreams now what is that sound it's let's check for the sick let me mute some of the audio sources sorry I'm like I'm like totally like a loss for what to do no it's the weirdest in the service area I don't know why but I had something running called airserver which is like I wonder if somebody's like white noise iOS app was like air playing into this oh my god that was a little bit crazy which maybe is appropriate for this law yeah okay we can go on and continue everything should be okay that was why I learned my mic back off okay okay cool whoa like what already kill your momentum no no it's fine it's fine no worries um but so basically um for me what this thing was was riot girl right and riot girl was this sort of punkrock feminist movement that was very much about women making art that represented them and represented their lives and how a lot of issues right like I was kind of its target demographic like it had like race issues class issues but still for all of its faults it really like gave voice to the set of emotions that I had about the world that I didn't know how to process and these values that I didn't really know how to articulate um and so there's this thing called the right girl manifesto and for that that really like totally hypnotized me and there were a couple of lines that really spoke to me I really like the line because we girls want to create mediums that speak to us right this idea that we're going to create art music and zine zand that sort of thing that's speak really to us as people because anytime we get anything done we are creating the revolution right which is really nice and maybe the most important went to me because I need laughter and I need a girl love right this idea that these experiences can bring us together right and so seeing these people try to cultivate these things made me realize I wanted to do it too but uh for me like if you know me in real life you definitely don't want to hear me play music I'm not a very good artist either all of the art and these slides have been done by an artist friend of mine because it's not a good when I try to do it and for me what I had been really interested in up to that point was game design right and I don't even mean like super artsy artsy fartsy game design right at this point in my life I was like planning a lot of Grand Theft Auto I was playing a lot of like Katamari Damacy playing a lot of rez a lot of like weird little games but these ideas or well grant that thought it was in a weird little game but you know what I mean a big span of games um there weren't necessarily about this but I sort of had a moment where I wondered could there be a meeting point here right in games basically a lot of what we're doing regardless of like the content at the game regardless of whether we like dubbin an art game or an indie game or a serious game we're trying to use mechanics to tell some story about the world right our mechanics value certain things maybe they're like a little bit more wild in one game a little bit more tame in another but regardless they're sort of pointing at a world that could exist right or that does exist for a little while and to me why a girl also pointed at this right you go to a riot girl show you hop in the mosh pit you sing along you kind of have this feeling of connection that you're in this alternate world for a second and so I kept wondering like there's not really a lot of like right girl game it's right this happened in the 90s so I mean probably some of you are younger than me to be that's like you know when I was growing up and I really started to wonder you know not a lot of people were making you know it's like a flourishing indie culture back then so I started to think what how could we combine this right how can we mash this up and so this question nagged at me all throughout college into law school and then out of law school a year later when I dropped out and then finally into design school and then the indie scene if anyone ever like pretends to know what they're doing I can promise you that 99% of us don't uh but uh when I sort of arrived at design school I realized I wanted to take the things about the genre that I found so transformative and start applying their ideas directly to the mechanics of games and so for me what that meant was to make games that had certain values right like I was talking about with the first terrible game that I made I wanted to create games that had particular values that cared about certain things like the weird little game world that they created focused on these things like deliberately being messy sometimes all right giving yourself the space to be messy you ridiculous view over the top we don't really get that a lot creating these like very expressive spaces goes along with messiness sometimes being expressive is messy creating relationships through art not just with me art you know I didn't really want to make stuff where people would just look at it and then walk away I wanted to make something where people would sort of interact with each other through it like being in a mosh pit or a girl show and I really wanted to communicate with my audience directly not trying to like explain them to anyone else so I'll show you two games that I made I mean I've made a lot more games other than this but there are two games that I've made that I think really kind of speak to this spirit and this ethos so this first one is this still from a game called screw mom up and screwup is a basically a twoplayer knockoff of space invaders but with two very crucial differences so let's play with the Kinect and a microphone it's twoplayer you work together so in order to move you hold this mic in your hand and you're tracked by a Kinect so I don't know if I have enough space over here so you have to run laterally up there I go into the void across to move your ship and you have to scream into a microphone in order to shoot I have a video let's see if this works yeah this is kind of like where's my head's in the way oh nice too hot I'm gonna awkwardly slide that video so um so you know I could talk about like the design choices in this game and the ways of hooking the tech up together and all of that is important but for me what I really wanted was to create a win condition in a game right in a wind condition just meaning something that you do to win oh I didn't make this video um uh I'm gonna close that cool then I'm gonna that cool okay so um so one condition is just something that you do to win the game right you want to score the most points or or whatever and the thing about them that's kind of great is that they sort of inherently justify whatever mechanic you used to achieve them right like if you think about it most of the games that we play a pretty silly right why don't we play golf instead of just picking up the golf ball walking over the hole and dropping it in right why do we use missing golf bets oh my god oh why do we use whatever using right like why do we use drivers and putters and that sort of thing when it's totally ridiculous right well we use them because the rules of a game require that we use them so we're gonna use them of course right we have to if we're gonna win we got to use them to hit the thing into the home and so reveal I sort of realized like I could take all these things that I really liked people being loud people being messy people having fun with each other people like running around in real life slamming into each other and I could kind of justify creating that alternate little space if I just made a game about it right and so um what I really felt was you're especially being told as a kid that I was like too loud it took up too much space or I decide too much uh I could take something that I felt selfconscious without in real life and just translate it into a game mechanic right giving me and other people this sort of release valve and this place to explore that kind of expression and I remember it was um was really gratifying because I brought this game to an outdoor festival and I was sort of like as with every game that I make I was like maybe only I think this is good maybe everyone else will hate it um you know people people in that hatton are cool you know they walk around and they look like they don't really care whatever uh but this like really steady flow of like initially you know very cool hipster people came by they would play it and all of a sudden they would like turn into feral animals right and screaming climbing on each other laughing shoving pushing and that was something I noticed didn't really end with the end screen the end screen would come up and they would laugh they would be hoarse uh and they would look at each other and they would look at me and say thank you and you could see that they had this kind of glint in their eye really excited like they had unlocked something and you know I don't want to say that games you know totally influenced behavior don't totally influence behavior but I think they can give us little spaces to be ourselves and to like discover different facets of ourselves and so it was really nice for me to grow up as a riot girl in mosh pits and that the see people leave my game with the same kind of like glint in their eye that I had coming out of those shows um my most recent releases a game called slam city oracles and it's really really tried to like infuse the whole thing with this practice one of the reasons I made slims to be oracles which is a two player arcade game is because installation games are really hard uh uh it turns out sometimes if the Sun Goes Down you're connect will break and no one tells you that in advance and there are 50 people who want to play your game in an outdoor festival and you figure it out so I really wanted to make something that could run on its own just go off into the world not need me to attend to it but basically the idea behind slam city oracles is that sort of like if you mashed a GTA and Annamarie dama she so you and your best friends the twoplayer collaborative game smash up this city to this riot girl soundtrack done by a local band so I'll play you oops not thank you yet soon they're not yet I'm gonna escape that I've done with my nuts they're spoilers uh plenty o like try to do it over here where's my head okay good oh by the way if you have photosensitive epilepsy please look away because there's lots of blinking lights thank you you one of my like proudest achievements was that I actually released on time which I really did not think was gonna happen at all um that was kind of a miracle thanks to everyone who helped me do it because I definitely do not do that alone I'm gonna put the presentation back here alright so um this was a really great experience because I got to work with and pay paying people is great a lot of people who had a lot of the same values as I did with regard to like making art that feels very much like this bright girl experience and again if you couldn't tell from the video the way that you win is you cause as much chaos as you can so you slam down make things fly around when you go up higher from aslim you can slam down again that makes it go even higher more things fly all around you have two minutes basically to cause as much destruction as you possibly can and again for me I really enjoyed this process of making a wind condition that valued the things that I wanted to value right like one of the major tenets of riot girl was taking up space right this idea that you don't shrink back you don't try to like lower your voice you don't try to just accommodate people around you you take up space uh metaphorically often obvious in some cases literally right like in this game it's all about taking up space all about like the impact of your physical self um in the world and another thing that really inspired me about this too is uh and I feel like this is a facet of the way that we think about like games that are serious or emotional or artsy but um this was actually a game that was really inspired by feeling like really vulnerable right really lonely there are a ton of women game developers there are a lot more now which is awesome and I mean I love all game developers have been amazing like mentors and influences on my life but there was a period of time where it felt really strange to be a woman games and I kind of fantasized about this place where I would just be invincible right you know cool me better Jane wouldn't be afraid to take up space you know would have would basically be invincible to anything else around her and so for me it kind of like with scream up which was all about giving yourself the excuse to take up space and be loud and basically better at it scream like you probably haven't done since you were about five or six this was very much about reclaiming a moment of feeling powerful feeling connected with other people and getting to miss things up and so so I think it's funny like you know we have this really like intense delineations about like what is art what is like serious or emotional we tend to think about it as like oh it has to be super autobiographical right but to me I really enjoy games that are sort of born out of the ways that people want to see the world right like and this is just the way that I see the world I'm sure that the people who are watching this channel all have their own influences and all have their different ways of seeing the world and I think one of the really exciting things about games is that again through this process of making rules through this process of sort of setting the narrative and through this process of determining what is it like what is the lane condition what's the main condition for you like what makes you happy what would be an interesting thing that you would want to do like it sounds kind of corny I get it but I think there's something really cool about making games about that because they kind of create these weird little like temporary utopias right where everything is different and in examples like this it's only different for about two minutes two and a half minutes it's a short song also it hurts to just slam the button over and over again by the you get to kind of create this alternate world where the stuff that you like that you value that you care about matters and what's even better is that with games you get to see other people experience it and see when they care about the things that you care about that you think matter and for me whenever I see people get that feral glint in their eyes for me that's my judgment for knowing that I've done something right so that's pretty much what I had to say um I appreciate all y'all bearing with me through the technical difficulties come on okay one question Zach yeah yeah so I'm gonna I'm gonna try we're gonna sort of like just rearrange ourselves you can no leave that there I mean we don't need just I think that's a nice background I'm gonna don't stand a little bit off to the side here yes so I'm gonna try so first of all in the CH I'm kind of keeping an eye on the and first Thank You Jane this was awesome thank you I love I've seen some rework before it was so great to hear like stories behind it and I think really just like super fun and interesting themes and exciting exciting stuff so I have a boy now there's even more people lots of positive feedback in the chat people really like the scream em up game and so so okay so fine so people are staying lots of thankyous now so I think what I'll try to do this is we haven't tried this before so I'm kind of learning how to figure this out but I'm going to ask I note it down a bunch of the questions so I'm just gonna kind of go through them in sort of I'm gonna start with some of the technical ones first yeah um so bunch of people that had asked like what kind of programs what kind of programming languages what tools do you use to make these games or other games yeah totally should I look at you sure I don't know both yeah kill get me if you're the audience have a preference let me know so this is good so um I used unity unity 3d is a game model as a game development engine um you can use a couple of language of the community I use csharp because I've been working in like C++ before and it seemed the most natural to me right um I primarily chose it because as a development team of one uh unity I guess one of the reasons why it's called that it exports to a lot of different platforms so you can make a game and then it exports to Mac to PC the iPhone to Android right like I think I like to blackberry I feel like I've seen that oh maybe I'm like super hallucinating um but for me it made a lot of sense because it really streamlined the workflow and let me like I was able to make a Linux build of this game right that works right like without any hassle which is not a sentence I've ever said about Linux I know that unity has like a free in a pro as well stuff you're doing like works under the free or you need primo for it yeah yeah yeah even the exporting is so you don't need the pro for that yeah I think yeah I think it like change used I think I'm like thinking about in an old way because I think it actually is now kind of like all free I think it's also like if your thing makes a certain amount of money then you have to get pro right um I haven't faced that like no uh and and the other thing I know like in particular with like slam city Oracle's here it looks like there's a lot of physics built into that game is that stuff that you're using from the built in yeah yeah so unity has really great physics both for 3d and 2d I know some people make their own but for me it was definitely definitely good enough it handles it pretty nicely there's like some garbage collection that I end up doing but um yeah it just kind of works it'll figure out where like so if you like have colliders and stuff objects like the characters you don't have to like trace that manually like figures it out for you that kind of thing I started building it in a different platform that didn't have like GUI right everyone's like show us the code well not not today god you don't want to see the code trust me all right so let's see I'm gonna I've got some more thematic questions by mistake with some of the technical stuff so so we've covered this on Holtz I'm trying to like use people's names from the chat but that first question by the way came from Jose came from Jose Thank You Jose and then um so one thing that I think is an interesting question that been asked in the chat um so it in particular for like the screaming up game yeah that you showed it like a festival it requires the Kinect maybe you built that with oh that was your open framework though we prorate you mention that open frameworks so how do you like is there oh dude does this does the Kenda game find an audience beyond this sort of like Festival or conference kind of circuit or just like an installation have you thought about that or is that been like part of struggle for you or yes what's it what's your thoughts on that no it's a great question and it totally depends I think it like again I think it depends on what your dev team sizes right because it's just you know the more platforms the more like overhead you require people to do right so the process for running screw up if I remember correctly cuz I made it a couple years ago you have to get an app on your iPhone because the iPhone transmits the sound data to the computer you have to hook up the connect to your computer then you have to make sure that they're both on the same network so OS seek communicate and have to make sure that like the port numbers and the IP addresses and everything all match up and like you know write that is intense that is a big ask and automating that kind of thing is like totally possible I'm trying to think about would have done that before but for me it just wasn't really feasible right right also like I'm very selfish and I mostly wanted to see people play the game yeah well there are like a lot of you know you have to you have to work at it you've got to apply but there are a lot of opportunities and a lot of times a lot of these games are the most fun in the sort of like crowd public simulated context totally but I think it's an interesting to think about you know a like finding the audience what's the right context for the audience the economics of like all this stuff like I'm just putting the stuff out there for people to feel joy which is a good thing but also like you know you want to be able to have a sustainable practice yeah this is why I don't make my money in games primarily thanks I have other jobs so this is kind of a related question I think which is from Kirpal from the chat rightz how would you recommend someone in high school who likes coding and gaming to sort of get into the game industry or get into internships College address that question that's a really good question so I feel like the thing that's nice about games at least nowadays is that it's such a wide field that it's not there's not necessarily one path right um I obviously took a pretty untraditional right there right I wrote down in my notes school question oh yes my like if I was gonna have any questions were at law school no idea that you went to law school that's crazy oh my god it's like this is the thing through is that I feel like um when we like our professional you know we have our CVS and our portfolios and it makes it look like we had anything figured out at any point in time I definitely did not like any way that's like a motivational speech for another day um so what was the question again it was no for a high school so how to begin yeah yeah so I think probably one of the best so let's say two things come to mind um one thing is actually they're both related so if you haven't done a game jam before I would say that's actually a really amazing opportunity I one of my first after interning in the games industry I kind of got back into games through game jams and if you haven't heard of a game jam before basically it's when a bunch of people get together for usually between like 2448 hours some are longer some are shorter I went in a onehour game jam on stage which I almost had a nervous breakdown but um but it's really nice because it kind of forces you to make something like at the end of that 48 hours you'll have something you'll have made your first game or your second game or your tenth game whatever and it also gets you out in meeting people right it's really tempting I know I do this all the time as a developer to kind of think I'm the indie developer I gotta like do everything I have to make the art I have to make sound is that and you'll find in these communities which are bigger than you think probably other people who are also interested in other people would probably think your idea is like awesome uh so so doing that together like gets you a portfolio piece it gets you some experience prototyping iterating and to me that's the most important thing actually the way that I got um the internship that I got in high school in the first place I mean it's a very different time ten years ago but uh but it was because I had made a game with a team over I want to stay like a six week program and some people from the games industry came and they saw it and they liked it and they liked me and they're like hey do you want to intern for us it's sort of like getting scouted as a model except like way different high but uh but yeah and so so I think that's one of the biggest things you can go to like conferences and conventions those are super helpful but I often find that the people who um who show up there also show up to the game jams it's a little bit easier I guess someone who's like stood around with my little name tag and my drink like wanting to talk to people but being too shy it's a lot easier to go to someone at hour 36 at a game jam and go like hey I know you I like your work and get a conversation started they're cool um a couple of people were just asking now because you mentioned like you don't necessarily do independent game development fulltime what is what what's your other like work that you do yeah I do all kinds of weird stuff uh so primarily what I do is um I do I protect tools which is not the most descriptive answer uh but uh so right now I work in a place called the office for creative research which is super amazing basically we're a studio that does a lot of like data and data analysis and data exploration in a very like socially oriented way so I just got off a project doing doing like a visualization of a census of elephants that took place over all of Africa oh this is like the Congo no that's that are lots of different yeah yeah those why my boss almost got like attacked by a lion which is a sentence I never thought I would say but uh I'm staying here yeah good cool um but uh but so uh so it is like weird and different um but I find that everything I do kind of orbits around people playing with each other like sometimes it's really explicit like the like the scream em up where you're like literally screaming and laughing and diving on each other like it's a game of football um but other times it's a little bit more subtle and it's about like how do people get curious how do people explore things um I'm really interested in that I actually sometimes think about myself as more of like a play designer than a game designer cuz that's what's really compelling to me and there's not like there's not a value judgement there yeah yeah we all need each other but uh but I find that that's what ties my practice together so um okay people are talking about game jams yeah there's another question why I've got so many okay gotcha we're we were to go for it well we'll go for a little longer answer somewhere I want to make sure I get to some of these um what this comes up a lot in with my tutorials and stuff that I've done people are always asking what we'll just turn a little background yeah yeah um what um like do you find that how much does like I'm rephrasing the question a little bit for my own question but how much does like math play a role in what you're doing and how much is that a struggle or how do you how do you deal with that you guys pay attention and trick please pay attention in trig because I didn't and I regret it so hard uh no it plays it has a huge influence actually um way more than I want to admit and that's probably honestly why to some degree I rely on outside sources um to get stuff done right like I'm not I'd like to say that I use your knees like engine because oh I didn't have time to write my own like let's be real I probably would not be able to write my own physics system but but uh you know you don't need to to realize your idea and I think the totally point is liked it you have something you want Express and so they want to communicate and you know sure it's an interesting academic exercise but if you understand I work so you can make it rip totally Express the idea then that's great totally totally but like definitely um it helps a lot uh I'm gonna help everywhere the way that I see it popping up a lot is what am i well my partner he does a lot of work with Perlin noise I hope you cover Berlin yes I have a nice tutorial Alice and so that is a way of making things seem really natural yes so sometimes like if you want and it means to look like they have a eye or they're moving around in a particular way you can add that and it doesn't feel so static you know what I mean it's sort of like you know if I walk around like this it feels a lot stiffer than me moving how it usually do so like using noise for example it's really important that same partner has a unit circle tattooed on him because that's how much he loves so uh so yeah I mean it's important but my attitude towards this is that one you know you realize your idea how you can no one no one who matters probably is gonna be like getting angry you about your code for no reason if they have nothing to do with it and like there's always Stack Overflow like you know it's there for a reason and you shouldn't feel like you have to figure this out all by yourself in the start yeah awesome okay so I want to ask question which i think is particularly relevant especially like in light of things have been happening in the world in this country the ones the last week Jane and I are both wearing safety pins here so a jew jew jew writes in the chat she wants to know if you've dealt with sexism in your career and also what you think you your our role as as developers might be in resisting oppression and marginalization yeah that's an amazing question and I should probably preface it with the fact that like I can only speak to my own experience and there are some amazing critics who like come from different backgrounds than me like I obviously like I have white privilege right like that's just a fact I went to like design school that gives me like a certain level of closeted education privilege so I'm coming from there I can't speak for everyone obviously um but in terms of sexism yes there it's interesting because it's pretty rarely um you know it's usually not people coming up to and being like get out of our playground we don't like you right but it's things like I remember I was at a conference once I had developed a game with my partner he's a man I'm a woman we both were at the booth we was a PlayStation Vita game we had Vita in front of each of us and I noticed that people primarily men would line up to talk to him so it was like a line like six or seven people deep to talk to him to fly his Vita and literally no one would come to me and even when people did maybe like oh are you the marketer are you the artist I was like I did the AI like yeah and don't get me wrong again god bless artists I cannot lie I not make any of my work without them this is not to denigrate artist or marketers but it was I would get this over and over and over again this sort of people call them microaggressions but this sort of like constant chipping away that's like oh I was at the Game Developers Conference lunch wearing a game wearing a badge from NYU Game Center has game in the title the Game Developers Conference which has game in the title and developer in the title um where my title said developer and someone came up to me and said oh sorry are you in games like would you ask my boyfriend like so it's very weird and it's something you kind of people can get better at it um to some degree you just have to like let it roll off your back a little bit um but it's hard and I mean it's it's really nice if you're a merchandise person of any stripe to find a community that understands you and that's super helpful and like you'll also find Ally's allies like where you don't necessarily expect like a lot this sounds like the famous like sentence but truly actually a lot of my most amazing allies are men right who have gotten me like the most the most help and the most opportunities um but it is really nice to have spaces where people understand you know I remember talking to people and then being like oh oh I guess I didn't realize that right um in terms of what was the exact question I mean I think I have a couple followup yeah that's well one I guess it's like so one of the things that with p5.js which is a JavaScript framework that I do a lot of tutorials about started by Lauren McCarthy really started with this ethos of you know the tool know tool is neutral and a tool like has the sort of biases of the creators and it's really important to have all voices of the table and also creating like this place that can be a community for people who might feel like I'm not include in opensource projects this could be a place where I could feel that way and I you know I guess I'm wondering are there some or they're like um you know online communities or web sites or like a conference I know there's like initiatives like Phoenix Perry's coat Club which we're kind of information are you cofounder that twosecond gain and Phoenix s a code liberation which is a wonderful organization are there other things that you can I mean to put you on the spot like a gov there's a time we can answer the links in the description yeah that's a really great question the ones off the top that I had off the time I had that I know it again they're mostly like women oriented because I am a woman and that's what I was looking at like I know pixels this girl this good girls make games is good we code liberation did a like collaboration workshop with black girls code which is an amazing organization I keep thinking I'm not totally sure in terms of tools though like that's actually the most exciting thing to me about um the last while in indie games because like when I was the first game I ever made aside from the way I talked about the presentation one of the earlier like program games that I can remember is like a text adventure really some language that like super doesn't exist anymore like a lot of the people that I know maybe their first games I'm like msdos and I'll tell you it's not the most userfriendly system uh and what I think it's great is that there's been this real explosion and tools that are available and they really work with like a diff different um like genre so you want to do it but also a lot of different learning styles and thinking styles so like your twine for text games is very much about like connecting passages or even like game maker has a sort of logic blocks and actually you can have code blocks in there too so as you start to like feel more comfortable maybe you rely less on the logic blocks and more on the code blocks maybe you start watching some tutorial to thank you uh but I think that's really amazing like I I think that's totally spot on that no tool is like a political and I actually think that's like it's really exciting when people make their own tools but I think having like a biodiversity of tools right is really great like it only supports more people making games awesome let's see if I'm going to just try to like wrap up and there a bunch of questions people are in the chat let's see it is an interview about interactive fiction yes interactive fiction okay um so one other I guess the so one other question I think is kind of actually is a good one to ask also asked by Jose is just about how long it takes you two for any of these projects look at these games how long did you work on them yeah hello how do you allocate the time for that totally what's that process well mine is usually very unhealthy uh so um it really depends there are a lot of small like there are a lot of games dynamic at game jam so to take a very short amount of time there are games where all do a lot of work on them at first and then kind of like letting life happen and then pick them up later slam city Oracle was kind of a totally ridiculous like thing that I could only do because I was young uh it was like two years ago anyway yes it counts um but I I made it in like six weeks because I had a deadline that I couldn't mess so I took a week of baking like I took one of my weeks of vacation from work and I just worked on it the entire time I wouldn't really recommend doing that um it's definitely really important to like balance selfcare um I can show like so what's kind of interesting if we have a second I'll show it cuz I kind of love it where do my video go where's my oh there it is great so um something that I something that I really like talk to people a lot about is how important it is to prototype and how like weird it is how sorry okay so so the thing about slam City this is a blog post of mine called finding the fun which you can see on kamasutra um where is my awesome uh so this is what slime city oracles looks like now but what slaps on your elbows look like when I started was this like literally that's it this is not the most inspiring thing in the world right I I refer to typing this and being like I'm a failure I'll never make another game this is like what how is this all loops it's just good yeah that means a half an hour has passed shuts off on man gotcha gotcha and like this was it this is where I started and if I looked at other games it was like how does this stack up to journey like that's bad um but it's kind of necessary to start here you know you find what you find is fun right like I was playing this with my partner we kind of realized that this ridiculous little bouncing ball game we kept doing it we kept throwing each other up and slamming each other down and so it can take a really long time to get through that iterative cycle but it's and how you'll get there how do you fold in like user testing like so yeah you try to do that like continuously you just like gather your friends it's can you put stuff online to user test like yeah uh so what I typically do it totally depends on like how big your audience is and like whether you're coming out of your bedroom or whether you have like a legit game development shop but uh but uh I user test it every turn and usually the way I frame it is for each prototype I try to have that prototype address something right so is it fun to slam down is it fun to throw other people up turns out that that second one was not fun it was just confusing right so I try to think of a very specific question that I can answer through code I see if people respond to it if it works and if it doesn't I throw it out um and so it's a lot of iterating you buy a lot of pizza and beer for your friends ah my facebook messages about testing got way let's go here and as the development went on um but there are also a lot of play testing events uh I guess not all obviously not all of you were in New York City but for example in New York City there are play testing events that happen at Parsons The New School for Design at the game center I believe play crafting also has events basically if you look up like indie game development in your city or play testing in your city I think I'll probably be surprised at what you find and you can also send your prototypes to people here and I mean yeah yeah especially if you know them and you like their work usually they'll be down cuz they were also like totally insecure about their projects ones I know I was in continue to think okay so wait now I realized that I forgot that there were some questions posted on Twitter because I was like oh that's good I have some questions just in case there are no questions but there's so many questions in the chat so and some of them came from Angela who I also see is posting in the chat so let me let me go see if I can quickly go to my Twitter notifications here and let me find some of these questions ok so I think we've talked about some of these but there are so Angela I'm gonna ask two questions from at Angela Wineman on Twitter one from Twitter and one from the chat one is that do a kind of like nondigital games card games roleplaying games board games how does play a role in your thinking and your practice I mean I know for me like I just love playing oh my god those kind of games and often I'm thinking about making computer versus of course I never do that but yeah I love them so I don't I don't tend to make a ton of them but they were definitely how I learned game design and I feel like one of the reasons why they're so hopeful is because they really forced you to strip things down and when I've taught game design before I'll run into students and I totally get it this is why I got into games where they're like on make a game it's gonna have this art and this music and this narrative I'm like that's great what's your like what's the what do you do right or do you just have like a theme um and that's not bad but I feel like starting with analog games really helps you like understand what mechanics work and what done right because you can't you can't be like oh this deck of playing cards is going to be like so emotionally resonant that it will do all the work for me so that's really great it really teaches you like about how to manipulate systems and how to like create those systems I still make um card games and like public space games occasionally I made a game recently called musclebound glory uh and it's a game where if you've ever seen like haze ever seen like an 80s action movie yes where it's like okay just making sure where they have like the really cheesy lines when they like finally like how the bad the bad guy you know what I mean like I want to treat you like garbage doesn't like kick you into this puzzle or whatever um so it's a game about that so you draw three cards it's like a situation a villain and a weapon or something like that I don't totally remember and as a group you have to try to or well individually you compete to make the best cheesy punny line that you can write and you kind of deliver them with like these you know poses and these like props and stuff and just really goofy and ridiculous I love I'm actually it you know it sort of strikes me to that one thing that it's done I think it's kind of interesting to think about is also like if you're planning to make a digital game like is there like a paper prototype version of it oh yeah oh yeah really great way to think through an idea solutely to like get user testing yeah you know I always I know like I doing all these tutorials this fall about text analysis and I'm often talking about like it actually is really good to just like get the physical book open it and like do the text analysis by reading the text that's in your line and like making notes with a pencil because that will sort of give you the clues to how the algorithm how the code has to be written yeah and allow you to kind of like slow that pace down to like think through the problem that's totally just like pencil sketches and like swapping them out and that's the kind of thing that I think is easy to forget when you're just like I'm gonna program this I got a perfectly well it's so like relatively speaking well both in terms of materials and time that's so much more low cost right like I I felt way working ideas than I do and it's really nice to not waste you know a week a month programming something and then find out that it's not any good than to just do it in a paper prototype yeah go this definitely doesn't work yeah and be done with it and move on yeah oh boy so many questions we're gonna so I think we're probably need to wrap up soon I think like an hour is a good amount of here for these two you know to not overburden our guests here um but let's me on Twitter let me yes and so but will looking at all that second at the end oh yeah no no you give that now yes you definitely do hit ask more questions to Jane on Twitter but I do you want to ask this other question from Angela which I can't seem to find right now but I saw it anyway so are there some people that are your kind of like major influences or people that you really admire I know this is one of these like pajamas all right yeah I mean we're so many you can think of them later and tweet these names you know it's okay I can do it people that you admire other I guess another way to phrase this question that might feel less like awkward to answer is like hey if you're interested in games also check out like these other indie developers oh my god that's also a really hard question sorry I'll start with my influence because or with my like inspirations because I've thought about that a lot because I like like oh what am I ever gonna be as good as them but uh so um Keita Takahashi is amazing he is the developer of kata married Amish oh yeah if you've ever seen it he did an amazing installation with baby castles where he basically dreamed up a bunch of like super weird installation games and they executed them in this museum so one of them was like a sidescrolling game and if you play a sidescrolling game it's like maybe you're a ship over here and you move through space in the background with behind you except this is rural about that Hey there you go um by that this sidescrolling game actually instead of having the background scroll the ship scrolled across about five or six monitors scattered throughout the space oh that's cool and to me that was just so like so I love that kind of stuff that plays with the forum and the medium I forget the the guys name the developer of res res is uh it was like on the Dreamcast which like oh my god so uh but uh it was a game that really attempted to sort of create the sensation of synesthesia which is like I don't think I'd come up with a dictionary definition of synesthesia but like the blurring of senses you know and and so that was really amazing that was one of the first like music games that really like totally struck me so there's a lot of things like that yeah I can probably write a whole post on like the weird old games that I like oh man in terms of current developers this is way harder because I would be heartbroken how can I plant this this Twitter yeah yeah yeah define okay so first of all sorry there's a lot of questions that shot about like what programming language should you start with what program language should I learn and so we did if you some of you might be tuning in late you can kind of roll back at when this archive gets published and we did discuss some of that stuff about different tools that Jane is using so um somebody said I think I was like scratching the mic by accent okay I should stop looking at I have a problem of like looking at the chat and I get very distracted by it's kind of a problem I also have this Bell which I don't know what to do it but I thought I needed a Bell yeah I'm using this Bell as like it's a thank you to Jane yeah um so this is really awesome and like super inspirational and like really fun a good experiment and challenge for me to sort of think about guests and interviews and that type of thing which and I think I would say thumbs up at least on your part you didn't write man so if you guys are interested in learning more about Jane's work yeah you can go to her website which is Jane free.com and also you can see her Twitter handle right yeah see my name yeah that's it so feel free to I could look up feel free to ask questions to Jane also you can ask questions with me on Twitter send us your feedback write in the comments and maybe you know I'm gonna have more guests maybe you could come back and we can make a new game show it or you can you know maybe we'll I'll think about if there are some I don't really do unity I like sugar and everything but if I can think what I like to sort of think about too is if there like some themes that came up I can do some tutorials kind of like around those themes I'm young think about that so if anyone got an idea of like oh how do you do X from this video then you could let me know so that's my parting words I have this really ridiculous thing that I do which is that I'm just gonna put on this I'll play you out with the redacted edited blurts he was talking and trailer one of these days we'll have a new one and um thank you for tuning in thank you again Jane I and um so this video by the way as soon as it finishes you won't be able to see it on YouTube but sometime later tonight or tomorrow we'll be back and I'll post on Twitter and will appear in the feed and that sort of thing so thanks for watching I'm always like I can't ever stop yeah but does are look it says 59 minutes and 11 seconds which is just like perfect so and I apologize if I missed your question please send me up write it in the comments send me a tweet send the tweet to Jane uh hopefully we can well hear from anybody who got missed okay so I'm gonna hit uh oh no whoops first I'm gonna hit this okay did you that learning coding would be really rough throw your hands up in the air and saying nothing not do you was allergic code and make some awesome stuff learn it anyone can when you're coding with Dan whether you're a power this is open you Burnie overarching concepts and some fun stuff too and with Dan as your guide come along for the ride make a crazy pixel mirror to reflect your face you can make it jump to Lightspeed into outer space you can generate a maze that can go on for days you can make your own terrain and some purple red you can make a retro game to see how it's done and then tweak a piece to make it yours for everyone make some fresh deleterious or Twitter but if you please and when the scissors right the colors of code
