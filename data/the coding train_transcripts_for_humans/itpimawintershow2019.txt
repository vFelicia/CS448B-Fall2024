00:00 - hello happy holiday is almost Happy New
00:02 - Year I'm standing here at ITP and ima in
00:05 - Brooklyn New York to School of the Arts
00:07 - and New York University were just a few
00:09 - days ago this whole floor was full of
00:13 - over a hundred projects student work
00:15 - from the ITP and ima programs on the
00:18 - fourth floor of 370 J Street and we
00:20 - looked at 91 projects you can see that
00:21 - full three and a half hour livestream
00:23 - by following the link in this video's
00:25 - description but what you're about to
00:27 - watch is a shorter highlight reel of a
00:29 - bunch of projects made by a wonderful
00:30 - group of students I hope you enjoy them
00:33 - I hope you have had a great 2019 and I
00:35 - look forward to seeing you on the coding
00:37 - train in 2020 good bye
00:39 - [Music]
00:51 - so I'm Aiden Fowler i'm nicole calvo
00:54 - quick sale and this is our lenticular
00:55 - portal room so we're doing experiments
00:57 - with the lenticular lens which is if
00:59 - you've seen bookmarks that have moving
01:00 - images that's what we're working with
01:02 - here and it stretches and magnifies the
01:04 - light so we're doing different
01:05 - experiments here we have a 3-dimensional
01:06 - box moving lenses that are rotating and
01:10 - then these flats on Sun rises over the
01:13 - ocean there's nothing in the box shall
01:15 - we do the reveal like what actually is
01:18 - inside it's an empty box but there's a
01:21 - thousand LEDs in here hi I'm Tina I'm
01:26 - Chris Kristina and this project is
01:29 - called one amongst many is a physical
01:31 - data visualization representing women in
01:33 - computing so you pick up these orbs they
01:37 - illuminate to full brightness and you
01:39 - can see every woman that we chose is in
01:43 - a cohort with a bunch of other women so
01:46 - we have computer scientists
01:47 - mathematicians as you picked an orb up
01:50 - and read about a certain woman other
01:52 - women in her cohort will also illuminate
01:54 - and as the orbs are interacted with over
01:58 - time they get incrementally brighter my
02:03 - name is Lulu and this is an installation
02:05 - that show everybody has a mountain on
02:08 - their original hand I have to tell the
02:11 - rock what is the shape of my hand and it
02:15 - will turns into a mountain which is my
02:17 - own mountain and I want everybody to
02:22 - have a nature connection when they see
02:24 - their Ridge of their hand
02:27 - hi I'm Winnie and so these are or from
02:31 - my data or class I'm from Hong Kong so I
02:33 - did a lot of projects about the protests
02:35 - and specifically focusing on the
02:37 - narratives I'm really interested in
02:39 - non-traditional approaches to protest
02:42 - and the focus of narrative is because I
02:44 - feel like our ability to craft our
02:46 - narrative
02:47 - that's really powerful and healing
02:49 - there's two projects about police and
02:52 - protesters and so I have these YouTube
02:56 - videos that I script that transcript
02:57 - from and I did these generator texts and
03:01 - also with the most common words I made
03:05 - these fridge magnets that people could
03:07 - interact with and then this piece here
03:10 - is all the protest informations I have
03:13 - consumed from September up until now so
03:16 - as you hover you could see the articles
03:19 - and the brighter the box is the more
03:22 - articles I have read in that hour of the
03:25 - day so my name is Tammy's and my project
03:29 - is basically a block puzzle game when
03:32 - you can build the correct sentence you
03:34 - have to use the brain blocks in this
03:36 - case this is basically like a learning
03:38 - tool for kids carrot Oh No say that
03:46 - right there
03:54 - I'm basically that's it
04:00 - [Music]
04:06 - I'm Andrea and so my project savvy our
04:08 - project and it uses VR to tell a poetic
04:12 - experience about kind of exploring
04:14 - flashbacks and what it means to have
04:16 - control of our own experiences and
04:18 - memory so that man that you see is
04:20 - supposed to represent trauma so the
04:22 - first time you go through this
04:23 - experience it's like you're going and
04:25 - walking around you may experience
04:26 - something horrific happen and now
04:28 - there's part of it's supposed to
04:29 - represent how memory will kind of try to
04:32 - understand that so in a memory if you've
04:34 - ever unfortunate experience something
04:35 - like bad happen you might replay that
04:38 - memory in your head over and over again
04:40 - and if he ever chooses to stop he can
04:43 - stop time and stop everyone from moving
04:45 - but he can never prevent what's gonna
04:47 - happen and so he is like looping this
04:49 - memory
04:53 - [Music]
05:06 - [Music]
05:15 - so it's really a struggle it's about
05:17 - patience actually finding where you need
05:19 - to be and then adjusting it for anyway
05:21 - go ahead a few hours on this and still
05:23 - try to figure I actually gave me to play
05:24 - this but I see some other people do some
05:26 - interesting things on this
05:27 - [Music]
05:50 - [Music]
05:57 - the dirt Rickman
05:59 - um this is web / wall it's
06:02 - my nine projects so we build our own
06:06 - instrument and then we perform with it
06:08 - like in urine
06:11 - dissident interesting chaotic sounds
06:16 - I'm sigh I'm the coding training
06:18 - community manager also a first-year ITP
06:21 - so this project is called the black
06:23 - projections project and basically I
06:26 - built what I call like a portal mapping
06:28 - device so it's like a math that
06:30 - potentially can help you on lappa portal
06:32 - and it kind of talks about or
06:34 - investigates space-time and how those
06:37 - are all connected to a lot of different
06:39 - moments that are happening and you
06:41 - basically explore it with a magnet you
06:43 - move across the points and then
06:45 - different images are projected on the
06:48 - screen my name is Ada and this is my
06:53 - project it's noise it's an audio enhance
06:57 - optical illusion the visual pattern is a
07:01 - vortex the center shifts depending on
07:03 - where you're looking at it so as the
07:05 - viewer moves around in space the
07:08 - triggers also triggers the audio changes
07:10 - in your headphone that corresponds to
07:12 - the direction of the moving center of
07:16 - the border my name is Rita and this
07:26 - project is in collaboration with Max mu
07:28 - Silva and it's kind of a
07:31 - choose-your-own-adventure color you can
07:33 - see if you put your headphones and you
07:36 - started by saying hi sailors
07:38 - and then it gives you a list of
07:39 - questions you can ask and you
07:41 - here a story that will change every time
07:43 - high sailors hi stranger you can ask us
07:47 - the following questions in any order and
07:49 - you can ask the same question more than
07:51 - once until we reach out destination who
07:54 - are you I am a sailor who will cross the
07:57 - ocean do get where I need to get and do
07:59 - what I need to do why did you leave I
08:03 - left because my father owned a dark
08:05 - mountain of anger where he wanted me to
08:06 - live
08:07 - I loved freedom more than I loved him
08:10 - hey so I'm Lachlan I'm a first year
08:13 - student here at ima and so I made a
08:15 - website called gun funded and it's a
08:17 - visualization of the gun lobby's funding
08:19 - of US Congress like where I'm from in
08:21 - Pennsylvania you can you can see the
08:24 - total and how the funding is
08:27 - disproportionately goes to Republican
08:31 - men in Congress and so you can go to
08:34 - anyone's profile you can share these you
08:37 - can see lists of top senators and
08:38 - representatives so that's gonna fund it
08:41 - and it's gun funder calm
08:43 - Jake Sherwood my project is called
08:46 - climate scape it's a kinetic art
08:49 - installation to raise awareness for
08:50 - climate change and the human effect on
08:52 - the climate it's representing for a
08:55 - future of potential climate change in
08:57 - there is going from best case to worst
08:59 - case so as you progress through the
09:00 - installation it gets more and more
09:01 - chaotic the best case kind of producing
09:04 - a more tranquil softer sound and then as
09:08 - you get through it gets more chaotic and
09:10 - become scary at the end my name is
09:14 - Alvaro la Couture
09:16 - I'm Nicole Genoa and our project is
09:19 - object tracking installation that tracks
09:23 - objects to control different types of
09:25 - animations in real time so we have these
09:27 - fears help with all of the animation
09:44 - position
09:45 - [Music]
09:55 - I'm an IDP second year and I have like
10:00 - installation which you don't waste on
10:03 - the best marriage so here as you can see
10:07 - there is a KGB equation which is away in
10:10 - a shallow water but it seems to be
10:13 - difficult but it can be also simulated
10:15 - by a very simple mathematics like like I
10:17 - said automata so it grows these across
10:20 - this bacon space so big wave grows
10:22 - faster quite a small wave goes slower
10:25 - it's similar to the real world smoke
10:29 - slowly my name is Jung and here thank ye
10:45 - creator of this project the idea of this
10:48 - project is to let people to interact
10:51 - what they are doing in the routine life
10:54 - and I didn't be aware of what they're
10:58 - doing because normally in some time
11:00 - people are like doing the same song
11:02 - Felicity so we made our parks which can
11:05 - reflect what people had to in do daily
11:07 - life so we said some of the interaction
11:10 - in the room in the real science room and
11:12 - every reaction due to in the room will
11:14 - be reflected in a small box so I'm
11:17 - Fernando and I'm creating this character
11:19 - called the Firebird and to embody the
11:22 - character image you put on the school
11:24 - office
11:25 - and imagining here at performing arts
11:27 - context so depending on the gestures you
11:29 - make you get like different a different
11:33 - sound and also you change the position
11:35 - of these 3d objects on the screen and
11:38 - you can like change the color of the
11:40 - object making different gestures related
11:43 - to the narrative I'm creating so you can
11:45 - make like fire and you get a red object
11:47 - or you can make like a tree and you get
11:50 - a green object and you can make like
11:52 - this and this is bird so you can fly you
11:56 - can embody the fire fire bird and fly
11:58 - around carrying this seat that is inside
12:02 - the land of the fire bird my name is
12:06 - Pippa Kalman sin' I worked on this
12:07 - project with Noah Curtis he also has a
12:10 - project we made a heart that beats the
12:13 - beat of your own pulse there's a monitor
12:15 - on the outside and there's a motor
12:17 - inside a elastic heart basically you
12:21 - just put your index finger on the pole
12:23 - sensor and then you can see your pulse
12:25 - beat in real time in a heart i'm julian
12:29 - matthews this is the hourglass so there
12:33 - is climate change related data
12:35 - correlated to visual on the sculpture so
12:39 - this is a statistic related to bees it
12:41 - the bee disappeared off the face of the
12:43 - earth humans would only have four years
12:44 - left to live there are some static ones
12:47 - another static one and then these
12:49 - require some user input this is meant to
12:51 - visualize rising sea levels so you can
12:54 - use a slider to demonstrate that this is
12:59 - the approximate cue of the Flint River
13:01 - water during peak crisis a little bit
13:04 - terrifying it this was coming out of
13:05 - people's faucets so these are two discs
13:07 - that are actually 3d printed
13:10 - [Music]
13:11 - once it slows down I attach neopixel
13:13 - strips on the outside and with this
13:15 - motor down here it allows me to spin it
13:18 - at 450 rotations per minute my name is
13:20 - Jen this is kind of like this instead
13:22 - okay no scope it's like detector at your
13:25 - distance so you like playing it it's
13:27 - like I've got a certain pattern
13:28 - according to it and then you get close
13:30 - to it you can like really control it by
13:32 - every centimeter see there's no
13:33 - projector just like no just like LED and
13:36 - tumorous and here la you can try to like
13:39 - we need you can throw it slowly hello my
13:52 - name is Matt Ross I'm a second year at
13:54 - ITP and I'm here today to talk to you
13:57 - about your relationship with your data
13:59 - if here today is a simple outlet but
14:02 - it's not just a simple outlet this
14:04 - outlet is connected directly to the
14:06 - servers at Google and what it does is it
14:09 - looks for any documents that you haven't
14:11 - even looked at in over two years so what
14:13 - you can do today is log in and it will
14:17 - find just one single file and if you're
14:20 - ready you can pull the plug and it'll
14:23 - delete just that single file and maybe
14:25 - just let me take a step towards having
14:28 - data in your life that really makes you
14:29 - feel good and then it's important to see
14:31 - it's retrieving all documents from a
14:33 - year and a half ago when I pulled this
14:35 - all of six seconds to change my mind
14:39 - see it's going gold and that's the whole
14:44 - process I'm down on a second here here
14:47 - at Nike feet and I work together with
14:48 - NASA developed a new team full of URL
14:52 - data where obviously you can see healthy
14:55 - data starts here it's just the p5 sketch
15:01 - asking me insert your phone into the
15:03 - container now all our goal today is
15:06 - basically to delete your or clear your
15:10 - browsing history so I'm gonna come here
15:12 - to this / l-lovely Pharrell and if you
15:14 - would take a look here my browsing
15:17 - history has been cleared I'm when I'm
15:22 - from Taiwan
15:22 - hi I'm KJ I'm from Korea yeah so this
15:26 - project's called Karim voices so this is
15:28 - basically a goddarn system that is based
15:31 - on word recognition so you can choose
15:33 - the word from the library we've built
15:35 - and say you to a microphone and see how
15:37 - he goes revolution
15:42 - yeah so this installation is about like
15:45 - the power of words because sometimes is
15:47 - - it's not visible so people just ignore
15:51 - it and want to enforce emphasize that
15:53 - this is so instructed I'm Stacy again I
15:57 - am money
15:59 - I'm kinship so this is a life vending
16:02 - machine we want to raise people surround
16:04 - yourself protecting animals
16:06 - how the indentured animals are feeling
16:09 - right now
16:09 - please insert the coin and start your
16:13 - journey so here you can see an animation
16:16 - the tiger is falling into the trap here
16:23 - you will get a product made by the tiger
16:26 - it's a leather coat I'm Skyler DeVos
16:29 - this is my project I called it liquid
16:31 - relationships and it's about connecting
16:34 - with other people I'm you know I'm the
16:53 - first year at ITP this is the
16:55 - interactive scroll so it's designed to
17:00 - allow someone to interact with an
17:02 - ancient scroll physically so you can use
17:08 - these rods to scroll through and then
17:11 - this allows you to translate my name is
17:16 - Noah and this project is called light
17:18 - it's about communication with physical
17:22 - separation
17:34 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello happy holiday is almost Happy New Year I'm standing here at ITP and ima in Brooklyn New York to School of the Arts and New York University were just a few days ago this whole floor was full of over a hundred projects student work from the ITP and ima programs on the fourth floor of 370 J Street and we looked at 91 projects you can see that full three and a half hour livestream by following the link in this video's description but what you're about to watch is a shorter highlight reel of a bunch of projects made by a wonderful group of students I hope you enjoy them I hope you have had a great 2019 and I look forward to seeing you on the coding train in 2020 good bye so I'm Aiden Fowler i'm nicole calvo quick sale and this is our lenticular portal room so we're doing experiments with the lenticular lens which is if you've seen bookmarks that have moving images that's what we're working with here and it stretches and magnifies the light so we're doing different experiments here we have a 3dimensional box moving lenses that are rotating and then these flats on Sun rises over the ocean there's nothing in the box shall we do the reveal like what actually is inside it's an empty

you have to use the brain blocks in this case this is basically like a learning tool for kids carrot Oh No say that right there I'm basically that's it I'm Andrea and so my project savvy our project and it uses VR to tell a poetic experience about kind of exploring flashbacks and what it means to have control of our own experiences and memory so that man that you see is supposed to represent

memory will kind of try to understand that so in a memory if you've ever unfortunate experience something like bad happen you might replay that memory in your head over and over again and if he ever chooses to stop he can stop time and stop everyone from moving but he can never prevent what's gonna happen and so he is like looping this memory so it's really a struggle it's about patience actually finding where you need to be and then adjusting it for anyway go ahead a few hours on this and still try to figure I actually gave me to play this but I see some other people do some interesting things on this the dirt Rickman um this is web / wall it's my nine projects so we build our own instrument and then we perform with it like in urine dissident interesting chaotic sounds I'm sigh I'm the coding training community manager also a firstyear ITP so this project is called the black projections project and basically I built what I call like a portal mapping device so it's like a math that potentially can help you on lappa portal and it kind of talks about or investigates spacetime and how those are all connected to a lot of different moments that are happening and you basically

us the following questions in any order and you can ask the same question more than once until we reach out destination who are you I am a sailor who will cross the ocean do get where I need to get
