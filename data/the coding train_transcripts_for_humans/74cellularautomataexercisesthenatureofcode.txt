00:01 - okay so these cellular automata videos
00:04 - have been a bit haphazard but now that
00:07 - we've looked kind of at an overview we
00:08 - looked at the Wolfram Elementary CA and
00:10 - have the lights on and we looked at the
00:12 - game of life I want to just kind of give
00:14 - you a quick list of exercises or things
00:17 - you might think about it in terms of
00:18 - taking these systems a little bit
00:20 - further as well as tying them back to
00:22 - some of the stuff we've looked at in
00:23 - previous videos so I'll kind of talk
00:25 - through these briefly it should be a
00:26 - short video and hopefully as time goes
00:29 - on I will be able to expand this or
00:31 - include links to below to some exercises
00:33 - or other implementations that are
00:35 - examples of this so a one thing that you
00:37 - might start with it first is simply you
00:40 - know the ca doesn't have to be a perfect
00:42 - grid of cells right what if it is a
00:45 - whole bunch of tiled triangles or
00:49 - arbitrary polygons or some sort of like
00:51 - crazy
00:51 - asure like tiling how would you have
00:53 - this cell state change based on its
00:56 - neighbors an example of that that I do
00:57 - actually have over here which you can
00:59 - find is exercise 7.9 is what if you have
01:02 - this cell's hexagonal and you can see
01:04 - each cell it's a hexagon has six
01:06 - neighbors what type of rule sets and
01:08 - what type of things could you do there
01:09 - so for those of you who are kind of
01:11 - interested in designing your own
01:12 - patterns if you've made a pattern
01:14 - could you make turn your pattern into a
01:18 - CA to create some sort of animation etc
01:21 - you also might think about it in 3d
01:23 - which I have which I've kind of alluded
01:26 - to previously what if you had a cube and
01:28 - what would its neighbors be and what
01:30 - could you do in terms of stacking or
01:32 - three-dimensional design that way
01:34 - another thing that you might think about
01:35 - and this would be a sort of simple
01:37 - exercise to implement is probability
01:39 - what if you said in the game of life
01:40 - instead of a cell dying when it's over
01:44 - populated when it's over populated it
01:45 - has an 80% chance of dying what type of
01:48 - behavior would you get if you made the
01:50 - outcomes they tied to probabilities and
01:53 - what if those probabilities changed over
01:54 - time another thing you might think about
01:57 - is this idea of a continuous state so
02:01 - we've only looked really scratched the
02:03 - surface of states 0 or 1 alive or dead
02:06 - black or white if you look if you look
02:07 - at Wolfram's new kind of science there
02:09 - is a wide variety of implement
02:12 - with with with larger states you know
02:15 - four possible states 8 possible States
02:16 - but something you could think about is
02:18 - what if the state is a floating-point
02:20 - number between 0 and 1 point oh the
02:23 - reason that could be useful is you a lot
02:26 - of things we do in computer programming
02:27 - the data is it could be a map to numbers
02:31 - between 0 1 point oh that's nothing to
02:32 - think about
02:33 - I mentioned image processing in the
02:34 - previous video but this is really really
02:37 - key so if you're looking for an
02:38 - application of this that you know might
02:41 - relate to an interactive system are you
02:42 - doing something with depth data from the
02:44 - Kinect are you doing something with live
02:45 - images from a camera from a movie could
02:47 - you create some type of special effect
02:49 - motion graphics effect over an image
02:51 - through CA like rules and this is
02:53 - nothing new this is what a blur is this
02:55 - is what a sharpen filter are and I
02:57 - mentioned stuff about that in the
02:59 - previous video how could this cell how
03:02 - could as the color be the state of a
03:04 - cell and a new color that changes over
03:07 - time be tied to a neighboring set of
03:09 - colors so I'll try to include a link
03:13 - below to an effect that has to do with
03:15 - water ripple effect so if you think of
03:17 - the heights of the cellular automata
03:21 - being filled with the height of water
03:23 - and L if we have a lake which all the
03:26 - water is even and we drop a pebble into
03:28 - it and one part of that water height
03:31 - changes how does that height ripple out
03:33 - into neighboring cells so could we do a
03:35 - one rippling look effect with with Cas
03:38 - historical I think we also mentioned
03:40 - what if you were to design a CA where
03:42 - it's state is not just computed by the
03:45 - states that are in the previous
03:46 - generation but many generations over
03:48 - time or a state in the game of life it's
03:50 - been alive for a really long time what
03:52 - would happen to that cell or dead for a
03:54 - long time moving cells I think this is
03:56 - perhaps the one I should start the most
03:58 - I think one of the reasons for looking
04:00 - at this is you know the CAS are
04:02 - interesting unto themselves and we can
04:04 - do projects with them they tiny image
04:06 - processing but really if we're thinking
04:08 - about it we had that flocking system in
04:11 - that flocking system all of these Boyd's
04:14 - what if we thought of those boys as
04:16 - having a state and that state somehow
04:18 - defined its behavior the way it steered
04:20 - what it was looking for what was doing
04:21 - the way it looked
04:22 - what if those what if that CA all these
04:25 - are Sal
04:26 - essentially but they're moving and their
04:27 - neighborhood changes based on who
04:29 - happens to be next then at a given point
04:31 - of time so this is a way of taking our
04:33 - flocking simulation - I hate to say this
04:35 - but to the next level right what if
04:37 - those voids in addition to following
04:39 - these rules actually have states that
04:41 - change based on their neighbors and the
04:42 - states drive their motion behaviors so
04:44 - this is something that would HIGHLY
04:45 - encourage you to look at if you're if
04:47 - you're kind of in your thinking about
04:49 - expanding the ways to simulate systems
04:52 - of moving elements and then you know
04:53 - that there's also this kind of idea of
04:56 - nesting complex systems right you know
04:59 - this is so this is that you know the
05:01 - world is a nested place right I don't
05:03 - know I I
05:06 - organ is a system of I am a system of
05:09 - organs this I made a room by myself but
05:12 - I teepee here is a system of people the
05:15 - world is a system of I teepees no but
05:17 - you get the idea right people the city
05:20 - is a system of people the world is the
05:22 - system of cities the universal system of
05:24 - world right this idea of nested complex
05:26 - systems like this terrible was a
05:27 - terrible explanation but I think you're
05:29 - getting the point right what if you made
05:31 - what if you had a flocking system where
05:33 - each boyd is actually a little mini Jima
05:35 - game of life or if you made a CA which
05:38 - is a grid of cells and each cell on that
05:42 - grid is its own grid of cells so how
05:44 - could you what would you accomplish with
05:47 - nesting complex systems in a way or CAS
05:50 - and flocking systems in a way that could
05:52 - be introduced interesting results with
05:54 - varying levels of zoom okay so this is I
05:57 - guess this video was just kind of a list
05:59 - of exercises and thoughts of things you
06:01 - might pursue I hope that this you can
06:04 - find ideas here for projects you might
06:06 - want to make and and I guess I'm hoping
06:08 - with these videos that I'm making calls
06:10 - I haven't really pushed on this is that
06:12 - videos like this could inspire or kind
06:14 - of out of the video like this could come
06:17 - become a little community of projects
06:19 - that people are making and links to them
06:21 - that relate back to some of these topics
06:23 - okay I hope I was recording I was I
06:25 - think this is the last video on CAS and
06:27 - the next video series will be on
06:29 - fractals

okay so these cellular automata videos have been a bit haphazard but now that we've looked kind of at an overview we looked at the Wolfram Elementary CA and have the lights on and we looked at the
