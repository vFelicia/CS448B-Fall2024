00:00 - as always another audio visualization
00:02 - video and the previous one left us weird
00:05 - like shaking crazy graphing the volume
00:07 - of a sound file and what I want to do
00:10 - now and it was a great suggestion from
00:11 - Oliver and the chat is instead of
00:15 - graphing as a graph along say an x-axis
00:19 - what if I took this graph and wrapped it
00:23 - around a circle and the way to do that
00:26 - is to think about a circle as a bunch of
00:31 - points that are based on an angle and a
00:34 - radius so if that angle iterates all
00:36 - around the circle but the radius changes
00:39 - according to the volume then maybe we've
00:41 - got something so let's see if we can
00:44 - implement that so I need to I'm going to
00:46 - just kind of like simplify the code for
00:48 - a second so I'm gonna pull this out I'm
00:50 - gonna pull out the push oh oh that's
00:56 - fine I'll reverse engineer all this code
00:58 - later I made a new version but that's
01:00 - fine I'm going to take out this line and
01:05 - then run it again as always I've always
01:07 - pretty great to play this so what I want
01:12 - to do now instead is say ok what if I
01:15 - I'm gonna do a begin shape and shape and
01:18 - I'm gonna say I is less than 360 and I
01:23 - now I need to have I is the angle right
01:25 - so first of all I want to I want to have
01:28 - the sketch in think in terms of degrees
01:31 - I can by default p5 we'll think in width
01:34 - of angles in a unit of measurement
01:35 - called radians but I want to think in
01:37 - terms of degrees here and I can say VAR
01:39 - x equals and this is a math formula that
01:43 - converts from an angle and a radius to
01:45 - an x and y position which is R times
01:48 - cosine of that angle that's X and VAR y
01:53 - equals R times sine of that angle and I
01:56 - can now have a vertex at X comma Y and I
02:03 - can say R equals just 100 let me run
02:07 - this I think there's that circle around
02:09 - if your
02:11 - so what I want to do now is right before
02:14 - he or say translate with / - let's let's
02:19 - have the centre be in the center and put
02:24 - a semicolon here and here we go
02:25 - as always our goal stop there do not let
02:29 - this stop this is the Cartesian
02:34 - coordinate systems and now what I'm
02:37 - going to do is are can be based on the
02:45 - volume so it can be let's just say it's
02:46 - between 10 and 100 based on what the
02:50 - volume is and I can get this out of here
02:53 - oops that pop is unnecessary and I want
02:56 - to only ever have 360 elements in the
03:00 - array and now I can do this as always I
03:04 - always forget the Vista all right so
03:18 - there's plenty more I could I could keep
03:20 - going with this you can make it rainbow
03:22 - color that could fill it in to stop
03:24 - colors I could have the colors respond
03:27 - to something else I encourage you to
03:30 - this version and stuff in the next video
03:33 - and then show you had okay thanks for
03:39 - watching another video where I'm

Cleaned transcript:

as always another audio visualization video and the previous one left us weird like shaking crazy graphing the volume of a sound file and what I want to do now and it was a great suggestion from Oliver and the chat is instead of graphing as a graph along say an xaxis what if I took this graph and wrapped it around a circle and the way to do that is to think about a circle as a bunch of points that are based on an angle and a radius so if that angle iterates all around the circle but the radius changes according to the volume then maybe we've got something so let's see if we can implement that so I need to I'm going to just kind of like simplify the code for a second so I'm gonna pull this out I'm gonna pull out the push oh oh that's fine I'll reverse engineer all this code later I made a new version but that's fine I'm going to take out this line and then run it again as always I've always pretty great to play this so what I want to do now instead is say ok what if I I'm gonna do a begin shape and shape and I'm gonna say I is less than 360 and I now I need to have I is the angle right so first of all I want to I want to have the sketch in think in terms of degrees I can by default p5 we'll think in width of angles in a unit of measurement called radians but I want to think in terms of degrees here and I can say VAR x equals and this is a math formula that converts from an angle and a radius to an x and y position which is R times cosine of that angle that's X and VAR y equals R times sine of that angle and I can now have a vertex at X comma Y and I can say R equals just 100 let me run this I think there's that circle around if your so what I want to do now is right before he or say translate with / let's let's have the centre be in the center and put a semicolon here and here we go as always our goal stop there do not let this stop this is the Cartesian coordinate systems and now what I'm going to do is are can be based on the volume so it can be let's just say it's between 10 and 100 based on what the volume is and I can get this out of here oops that pop is unnecessary and I want to only ever have 360 elements in the array and now I can do this as always I always forget the Vista all right so there's plenty more I could I could keep going with this you can make it rainbow color that could fill it in to stop colors I could have the colors respond to something else I encourage you to this version and stuff in the next video and then show you had okay thanks for watching another video where I'm
