00:00 - hello I'm back in making a video in this
00:02 - video I want to look at the JavaScript
00:04 - input event now you might be wondering
00:07 - why are you looking at the JavaScript
00:09 - input event well first of all it's a
00:10 - very useful event the name input doesn't
00:13 - exactly describe what it does so I feel
00:15 - like that's a nice thing to clear up in
00:16 - this discussion that but I feel like I'm
00:19 - having a discussion with you even though
00:20 - you're not actually there but you are
00:22 - there you're a real person and but well
00:26 - one of the reasons in particular why I
00:27 - want to make this video is I attempted
00:29 - to do exactly the same thing you can go
00:31 - back and find another video where it
00:32 - just like didn't work and I was trying
00:34 - to update stuff so one thing to make
00:35 - sure you're doing is that you have the
00:37 - most recent copy of the p5.js library
00:40 - now if you're watching this video like a
00:42 - year from now you'll be using the I
00:44 - don't know the lor Dutch library effort
00:47 - so this won't be relevant anymore
00:48 - but if you're actually here in 2015 make
00:52 - sure you're working with one of the most
00:54 - recent p5.js and people I've done
00:56 - library so that this particular event
00:58 - function will work okay so what do I
01:01 - want to happen here this is a web page
01:03 - it's got some text on it it's got a text
01:06 - input box and it's got a slider now
01:08 - nothing is going to happen right now I'm
01:10 - gonna type some text in here which
01:12 - that'll work and I can even move this
01:13 - slider the goal that I want for this
01:15 - example is for when I type text in there
01:18 - I want the paragraph above to update in
01:20 - real time with that text when I move the
01:23 - slider
01:23 - I want that paragraph up there the font
01:26 - size to change these are exciting
01:29 - moments that will happen when we get
01:30 - this to work so first I let so so first
01:34 - let's look at the code that's at least
01:36 - gotten this so far
01:37 - now again I'm doing the thing that I
01:40 - that I feel confused and torn about
01:43 - which is that I'm creating these Dom
01:45 - elements with the p5.js library they
01:48 - certainly could be written into the HTML
01:51 - file directly an access from p5 and
01:53 - that's a topic for a video I will make
01:55 - next using the Select and select all
01:58 - functions but for right now just to
01:59 - demonstrate the idea of the event it's
02:01 - easiest if I make the paragraph with
02:03 - some starting text I make the input the
02:05 - text input
02:06 - oh I don't okay so I made this mistake
02:08 - the other day and I'm going to correct
02:09 - it the event that I want to demonstrate
02:12 - is call
02:13 - input I actually probably would work
02:16 - fine but I think it's particularly
02:17 - confusing for me to name a variable
02:19 - input and then start demonstrating this
02:21 - other thing called input so let's change
02:23 - that to something like if only you are
02:27 - actual person there you would say shout
02:29 - out a good variable name and all I can
02:31 - think of is like porcupine but which
02:33 - makes no sense in this context but we
02:35 - could use it no no let's not use it
02:36 - that's too crazy let's just say a text
02:40 - text field text box let's call it text
02:43 - box that looks pretty good okay so I'm
02:46 - gonna call it text box text text mech
02:48 - like tex-mex no text box it's like spicy
02:51 - but not too spicy I don't know okay so I
02:54 - make the text box and the slider all
02:57 - those things in the page you can see
02:58 - I've made them with Coach now how do you
03:00 - attach an event to a particular Dom
03:03 - element now there are many ways to do
03:05 - this using all sorts of frameworks and
03:07 - libraries and native JavaScript I'm
03:09 - going to show you how to use the p5.js
03:12 - framework so certainly I could do
03:14 - something like the mousepressed event
03:16 - which I demonstrated in a previous video
03:18 - but let's start I'm going to start with
03:20 - the changed event I'm just gonna say
03:21 - something like text the input event
03:24 - sorry I'm gonna say textbox dot changed
03:27 - do something so with this lovely
03:31 - wonderful little line of code does is it
03:34 - says there's an event called changed
03:36 - when the content of the text box changes
03:40 - execute a function called do something
03:43 - now if I ran this code with this work it
03:45 - would not do I ask weird questions to
03:48 - myself while I'm standing here
03:49 - apparently yes but would this work it
03:51 - would not work why because do something
03:53 - is a function that I have to define
03:55 - myself so now I'm gonna say function do
03:59 - something and I could just say something
04:01 - like print line you know did like see a
04:03 - message in the console but really what
04:05 - do I want to do maybe what I want to do
04:07 - is update the paragraphs text with the
04:10 - text boxes text value so this is kind of
04:18 - like a bit of a tricky line of code
04:19 - right here but let's look at what it's
04:21 - doing the HTML function is a function
04:23 - that's part of the p5.js library
04:25 - changes the HTML content of a Dom
04:27 - element so the paragraphs content should
04:30 - change to what the text boxes value
04:33 - what's the text boxes value the thing
04:35 - that you typed into that text box so now
04:38 - if we run this I should see right when
04:43 - the text boxes update the paragraph with
04:46 - what's in the text box let's do that
04:51 - hello this should it's not updating why
04:54 - isn't it updating well it turns out that
04:57 - I've misled you and I've led to believe
04:59 - that the changed event the changed event
05:03 - is an event that is triggered any time
05:05 - the content changes it's actually not
05:07 - the changed event is an event that's
05:09 - triggered whenever the browser deems you
05:12 - to have finished your action so this is
05:15 - kind of like a vague strange concept
05:17 - that you know but somebody somewhere
05:18 - there's like borgov browser designers
05:22 - has decided what this should be and it
05:24 - happens to be hope this works when you
05:27 - hit the enter key is one up so if I hit
05:28 - enter hey we're Tobit so lucky when I
05:31 - hit enter in the text box that's when
05:34 - the changed event happens also by the
05:37 - way I could hit tab I'm writing my name
05:39 - and then watch this you can't see but
05:41 - here on this keyboard I'm gonna hit tab
05:43 - one two three tap it also updates so
05:46 - this is an event that fires when the
05:49 - user has changed their action but what I
05:52 - want is for that to continuously change
05:54 - any type you've any any time it changes
05:56 - for whatever reason you can type any
05:57 - single character and that my friends is
06:01 - the input event so this particular event
06:05 - this particular event the input event is
06:08 - an event that happens anytime the
06:10 - content of the text box changes do
06:13 - something is the callback right it's the
06:15 - function that gets triggered when the
06:18 - event occurs that function is we call
06:20 - back call call like a that's a bird call
06:23 - I know it up to would call back to the
06:26 - function that was gonna go somewhere
06:27 - interesting and it just didn't so I
06:29 - apologize for that
06:30 - okay so let's run this again look at
06:33 - this
06:34 - and then say hello look at that oh that
06:36 - is so nice
06:38 - this is constantly changing no matter
06:41 - what I could just do this all day long
06:44 - it's just fun real-time quick
06:46 - interaction is fun you know it's
06:50 - actually fun is like going outside and
06:52 - like playing a game of capture the flag
06:55 - with friends and socializing but you
06:57 - know if you're by yourself in a room
06:58 - with a camera and the node kid web
07:00 - browser then making the text box change
07:03 - in the real time is fine now let's add
07:04 - the slider so all I need to do and just
07:08 - do something I don't really like the
07:10 - name of that so I'm going to change that
07:11 - to like update text and then I'm going
07:15 - to make another event slider dot input
07:19 - update font size oh that's the worst
07:23 - whenever you know update let's just say
07:25 - update size so now I'm gonna write
07:27 - another function called update size and
07:30 - let's actually sorry about this let's
07:33 - actually put it up here so that we can
07:37 - see now so when the text box changes the
07:40 - paragraph element is updated with the
07:42 - contents of the text box when the slider
07:45 - changes what happens so in a previous
07:49 - video I looked at the style function the
07:52 - style function is a function that is a
07:55 - way to programmatically assign style
07:58 - information CSS tags essentially to a
08:03 - Dom element so I'm gonna say paragraph
08:06 - dot style and say anything about CSS I
08:12 - could never remember what things are
08:13 - called but I'm just gonna like look up
08:17 - to the ceiling of this room and think
08:19 - for a second and hope that the correct
08:21 - term is font size now you might think
08:24 - all I would need to do now is say slider
08:26 - dot value right because this sort of
08:29 - makes sense right I made this slider
08:31 - that and remember this is the minimum
08:34 - value of the slider the maximum value I
08:36 - like wanted to zoom over here so I can
08:38 - point to it this is me being ridiculous
08:40 - but this is the minimum value of the
08:41 - slider 64 is the maximum value slider
08:43 - and 16 is the starting value of the
08:46 - slider so in other words
08:47 - whatever value is here should be
08:50 - assigned to the font size each 16 I
08:53 - slide down it's Tanis line all the way
08:54 - up at 64 now you might think that work
08:57 - would work and it's I don't think it's
08:59 - going to it's not working so what's the
09:02 - issue what's the what's what's the
09:06 - problem the problem is that CSS expects
09:10 - you not just to give it a value for font
09:13 - size but a unit of measurement and
09:15 - there's different ways other all sorts
09:17 - of you could some typography genius
09:20 - person knowledgeable person please come
09:22 - and enter this internet world and add
09:23 - some information below and like a
09:25 - comment that explains about different
09:27 - types of Units but here's one that I
09:28 - think is a useful one point P T so what
09:32 - I actually can true enough what I
09:35 - actually need to add and I'm coming back
09:37 - here is plus PT so what this is doing
09:44 - again it's not like adding 10 plus the
09:47 - letter P the letter T the plus operator
09:50 - with text joins those things so the goal
09:53 - is really and I probably should have
09:55 - done this in two steps if I were to say
09:57 - something like 24 point and run this
10:01 - whenever I move the slider it's gonna
10:04 - change it to 24 point but that's not
10:06 - what I want I want to change it to the
10:09 - slider dot value followed by PT and I
10:14 - guess I got font size right and now when
10:16 - we do this I can write whatever any text
10:20 - I want and I can use the slider to
10:22 - change its size dynamically now this is
10:25 - kind of interesting how the note how the
10:28 - flow of a page works right as that
10:31 - paragraph gets bigger the other content
10:34 - gets pushed down which makes for a kind
10:35 - of strange goofy interaction which I
10:37 - kind of like in this moment but you know
10:40 - certainly if I wanted to fix that I
10:42 - don't know fixes the right word but
10:43 - alter that the behavior I could put the
10:45 - paragraph below and now if the paragraph
10:47 - was below I could type some text and it
10:51 - would seem maybe a little less weird and
10:53 - change its size dynamically
10:55 - so now hopefully you see how you can
10:57 - create these interface elements like a
11:00 - text box a slider there are other ones
11:02 - too and anytime anything about that
11:06 - element changes whether it's the text in
11:09 - the text box or the value of the slider
11:10 - you can trigger an event that alters
11:13 - something else that's happening on the
11:14 - page so I might say to you like how far
11:17 - can you take this how many sliders can
11:19 - you add how many can you control
11:20 - different paragraph elements could you
11:22 - as you're typing like each letter is
11:24 - like a new Dom element that's randomly
11:26 - absolute positions over on the page what
11:28 - kind of creative graphical experiments
11:30 - can you make with just this simple idea
11:32 - and that is this video about the input
11:37 - function callback and I'm going to stop
11:39 - this video and go on to the next one
11:41 - which I believe I'm gonna look at select
11:44 - and select all I look at my list anyway
11:46 - just look and you'll know okay

Cleaned transcript:

hello I'm back in making a video in this video I want to look at the JavaScript input event now you might be wondering why are you looking at the JavaScript input event well first of all it's a very useful event the name input doesn't exactly describe what it does so I feel like that's a nice thing to clear up in this discussion that but I feel like I'm having a discussion with you even though you're not actually there but you are there you're a real person and but well one of the reasons in particular why I want to make this video is I attempted to do exactly the same thing you can go back and find another video where it just like didn't work and I was trying to update stuff so one thing to make sure you're doing is that you have the most recent copy of the p5.js library now if you're watching this video like a year from now you'll be using the I don't know the lor Dutch library effort so this won't be relevant anymore but if you're actually here in 2015 make sure you're working with one of the most recent p5.js and people I've done library so that this particular event function will work okay so what do I want to happen here this is a web page it's got some text on it it's got a text input box and it's got a slider now nothing is going to happen right now I'm gonna type some text in here which that'll work and I can even move this slider the goal that I want for this example is for when I type text in there I want the paragraph above to update in real time with that text when I move the slider I want that paragraph up there the font size to change these are exciting moments that will happen when we get this to work so first I let so so first let's look at the code that's at least gotten this so far now again I'm doing the thing that I that I feel confused and torn about which is that I'm creating these Dom elements with the p5.js library they certainly could be written into the HTML file directly an access from p5 and that's a topic for a video I will make next using the Select and select all functions but for right now just to demonstrate the idea of the event it's easiest if I make the paragraph with some starting text I make the input the text input oh I don't okay so I made this mistake the other day and I'm going to correct it the event that I want to demonstrate is call input I actually probably would work fine but I think it's particularly confusing for me to name a variable input and then start demonstrating this other thing called input so let's change that to something like if only you are actual person there you would say shout out a good variable name and all I can think of is like porcupine but which makes no sense in this context but we could use it no no let's not use it that's too crazy let's just say a text text field text box let's call it text box that looks pretty good okay so I'm gonna call it text box text text mech like texmex no text box it's like spicy but not too spicy I don't know okay so I make the text box and the slider all those things in the page you can see I've made them with Coach now how do you attach an event to a particular Dom element now there are many ways to do this
