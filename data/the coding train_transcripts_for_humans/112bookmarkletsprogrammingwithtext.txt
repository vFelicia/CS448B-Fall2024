00:00 - hello this video tutorial where I'm
00:03 - going to show you how to make a very
00:04 - simple basic bookmarklet and this is
00:07 - really a warm-up my goal here in the
00:09 - next video and the video after that and
00:11 - the video after that is to start looking
00:13 - at Chrome extensions Chrome extensions
00:15 - are a much more powerful way to affect
00:18 - the browsing experience as a whole and
00:20 - actually the interface elements and all
00:23 - sorts of stuff
00:24 - in the Chrome browser but a bookmarklet
00:26 - is a really quick and easy way to add a
00:28 - button that's like a bookmark that
00:30 - triggers some code that changes your
00:32 - browsing experience so let's look at how
00:33 - that works
00:34 - so before I get to that I'm gonna leave
00:38 - it es5 which is and not use some of the
00:42 - fancier newer JavaScript syntax just to
00:44 - sort of demonstrate the simplicity of
00:46 - the idea but I I'm sure that it will get
00:48 - people watching who will help suggest
00:50 - fancier ways to write the same code and
00:52 - I look forward to including that in the
00:53 - material supplemental materials that'll
00:55 - be linked from this video's description
00:56 - so if you've ever made a function in
00:59 - JavaScript you might have done this
01:02 - function you know hello curly bracket
01:07 - curly no parentheses parentheses curly
01:10 - bracket curly bracket if I want to
01:12 - execute this function I want to run that
01:16 - function I would just say hello with the
01:18 - parentheses that means execute this
01:19 - function so now you are probably aware
01:22 - I'm looking for my eraser here it is you
01:25 - are probably aware that in JavaScript
01:29 - functions could be anonymous meaning
01:32 - they don't have to have a name and it
01:34 - can just look like this but then how do
01:40 - you execute the function so typically
01:42 - you might write an anonymous function
01:43 - because you're passing it in somewhere
01:44 - as a callback and somewhere else it's
01:46 - gonna get a reference to it and call it
01:48 - somewhere but in the case of a
01:49 - bookmarklet what a bookmarklet actually
01:52 - is it's a JavaScript function that when
01:54 - you press the button it runs and so a
01:57 - funny thing that you can do if this is
01:59 - the entire right remember if this was
02:01 - named hello then I could execute the
02:05 - function with the name and these two
02:07 - parentheses I can actually just execute
02:09 - the function by putting the two
02:10 - parentheses there so this is like an
02:12 - anonymous
02:13 - self-executing function again I think
02:15 - that's right there's some probably of
02:18 - appropriate technical term for it so
02:19 - this is actually somewhat a bookmarklet
02:21 - actually is and if I just put something
02:24 - like console dot log or alert maybe
02:27 - alert will be a good I think never I
02:29 - have this like mission in life to never
02:31 - ever use a JavaScript alert and I'm
02:32 - gonna somehow I'm gonna do that but I'm
02:35 - gonna break that mission that's it right
02:38 - now so I could say alert you know hello
02:40 - so if this were the code for my
02:42 - bookmarklet whatever the user presses
02:45 - the button or goes to that quote-unquote
02:47 - bookmark this code is gonna execute so
02:52 - this begs the question this is very
02:54 - simple idea a good and and now it's up
02:56 - to you like what do you put in here you
02:57 - can read you this is where you can start
02:59 - parsing and looking at what's on the
03:01 - webpage and changing it in real time
03:02 - with JavaScript but other question is
03:05 - where's this code go so now let's look
03:07 - at that all right so you might be aware
03:10 - that if you go so if you go to a URL and
03:13 - this you don't really see that Chrome by
03:14 - the way is hiding the fact that this is
03:16 - HTTP colon slash slash so I could go to
03:21 - URL by saying HTTP that's I'm saying I
03:24 - want to make an hypertext Transfer
03:26 - Protocol get request to this URL but I
03:28 - can also in the browser look at things
03:30 - that are like files on the computer so I
03:36 - can open up index of HTML and you can
03:38 - see oh look now I'm going to the file
03:40 - colon slash slash but I can actually
03:43 - there is and there's actually like a
03:45 - data path where I can do you know base64
03:48 - encoded images there's all sorts of
03:50 - different kinds of paths that the
03:52 - address bar will accept one of them
03:54 - happens to be JavaScript I let's dare I
03:59 - try to do this function oh I am
04:03 - remembering something that I'm also
04:05 - being told in the chat I made a little
04:07 - mistake here which is that in order for
04:10 - you to execute this function the way
04:12 - that I've described here you actually
04:14 - have to also enclose the entire nameless
04:17 - or anonymous function in parenthesis
04:19 - itself so otherwise it's that's unclear
04:22 - I guess to the interpreter like what
04:24 - this actually match
04:26 - so this is execute the function that's
04:28 - inside these parentheses I'm pretty sure
04:30 - that's required so now let's come back
04:34 - here and so the reason why I saw that's
04:36 - just now I'm going to actually just type
04:37 - that code in right here in the address
04:41 - bar function that's gonna be really hard
04:43 - function curly bracket alert hello
04:51 - semicolon close curly bracket close
04:54 - parentheses parentheses parentheses so
04:56 - this is me saying I want to go to this
04:58 - URL it's JavaScript colon slash slash
05:01 - actually I don't think you need to slash
05:03 - slash if I'm thinking about this I think
05:06 - it's just JavaScript colon and then this
05:09 - code which is a self-executing anonymous
05:11 - function so I'm gonna zoom back out here
05:14 - and I'm going to now hit enter as if I'm
05:17 - loading this web page and I get this
05:19 - alert the page says hello
05:21 - so this that's actually what a
05:24 - bookmarklet is and I wish I had copy
05:26 - pasted that because now all I need to do
05:28 - is I can say I can have a paragraph and
05:31 - I can say I can say hey this is a and I
05:37 - could say a href equals book mark litt
05:42 - all right so look take a look at this
05:44 - now we can see this here now if I click
05:47 - on this nothing happens so what can go
05:50 - in a a what can be the H ref to an a tag
05:54 - it could be a URL it could be it could
06:00 - be lots of things one of the things that
06:02 - can be is actual JavaScript code so for
06:05 - example that same thing that I typed
06:08 - JavaScript colon function oh I need to
06:11 - put a parentheses around the function
06:13 - function parentheses curly bracket alert
06:22 - hello
06:24 - close quote close parenthesis close
06:28 - curly bracket close parentheses execute
06:31 - so now let's try refreshing this page
06:35 - and now whenever I click on that it runs
06:37 - that JavaScript code
06:39 - now guess what if I wanted to bookmark a
06:44 - URL all the whole thing like if I like
06:46 - here I have a bookmark up here to the
06:48 - rainbow topics github repository if I
06:50 - click Edit all this is is a name for
06:54 - this particular URL a bookmarklet is
06:56 - just a named set of JavaScript code so I
07:00 - can now say I can now write if actually
07:05 - what I could I could have created but I
07:06 - can't really just drag this up here and
07:09 - you can see look at that now I have this
07:10 - here and every time you I click on it I
07:13 - get that alert click alert click alert
07:18 - and if I go edit we can see this is just
07:21 - this now its URL encoded it did that for
07:26 - me because a quote is not a valid a
07:30 - valid character in a URL so the this has
07:34 - been URL encoded meaning % 27 you'll
07:36 - often see like % 20 that means space %
07:39 - 27 currently means single quote I think
07:41 - so you can see you can write it this way
07:43 - now so in a way we're done yay we made a
07:47 - bookmarklet but we haven't really done
07:49 - anything yet like here's the thing is
07:52 - this really sustainable is this the
07:54 - thing like oh my goodness and I how am I
07:56 - going to send what if I want to do
07:57 - something really elaborate I want to
07:59 - crawl I want to look at all the content
08:01 - on that web page and I want to find all
08:03 - the paragraph elements and I want to
08:05 - look anytime the word puppy is in there
08:08 - I want to change the word puppy to
08:09 - kitten so it's a it's a bookmarklet that
08:12 - changes puppies the kittens or swap
08:14 - images out or change the background
08:16 - color of every web page to a random
08:18 - color all these things are possible but
08:20 - working with kind of trying to write the
08:23 - code in here is going to be so
08:25 - incredibly awkward like how am I gonna
08:28 - really develop because I can't really
08:29 - have line breaks or spaces very easily
08:31 - here so there is a strategy that is used
08:35 - quite often so the next step that I want
08:37 - to show you is how could I write all of
08:40 - my bookmarklet code in a separate
08:43 - JavaScript file and then simply point to
08:48 - it from here so in other words what I
08:50 - want to say is new file
08:54 - I'm just gonna call it book mark lit a s
09:00 - and then what I want to do is I want to
09:01 - be able to write the bookmarklet in a
09:03 - way that's much like easier for me to
09:05 - follow and debug so for example
09:09 - something that I might do is I might say
09:12 - you know console.log bookmarklet
09:15 - starting and then I might say and now I
09:19 - don't have access to there is a way to
09:21 - gain access to JavaScript libraries like
09:23 - I could have jQuery or p5 be a part of
09:26 - what I'm doing but I'm gonna just do
09:28 - stuff with native JavaScript so I could
09:30 - say for example you know let P
09:33 - paragraphs equal equal document get
09:40 - elements by tag name us P and then I
09:45 - could say for
09:47 - [Music]
09:48 - let I equals 0 I is less than paragraphs
09:54 - length I plus plus and I could say
09:57 - paragraphs index i dot inner HTML equals
10:02 - so this is me like kind of doing a
10:04 - little version of the deletion Esther
10:05 - word list web like we find all the
10:07 - paragraphs on the page and just set
10:09 - their inner HTML to nothing or I could
10:11 - say it's at their inner HTML to kitten
10:13 - so this now if I wanted to I could put
10:16 - all of this into that JavaScript URL and
10:19 - I could like remove all the the I could
10:22 - remove all the white space and probably
10:24 - make it work but what I could do that's
10:26 - a little bit easier is and I'm gonna I'm
10:29 - gonna just type this out on this in this
10:32 - text document for a second
10:35 - down here is I could actually say all
10:40 - right so this is kind of the and I could
10:45 - write that this anonymous function and
10:47 - then what I can do is one of the things
10:51 - you can do in JavaScript is add elements
10:54 - to the web page and so the element that
10:55 - I want to add is a script so I'm going
10:58 - to say let script equal document dot
11:02 - create element script
11:06 - and then what I want to do is I want to
11:09 - add that change the source script source
11:13 - equal to book mark lit a s so I want the
11:21 - source to point to this other JavaScript
11:24 - file and then I want to say
11:27 - document.body.appendchild script so in
11:32 - other words this is kind of some
11:34 - boilerplate code that can basically say
11:37 - any I this just a point to a different
11:41 - javascript file that's gonna have all
11:42 - this other stuff and it tons and tons of
11:44 - code and then just load that and execute
11:47 - that code whenever the bookmarklet is is
11:50 - trigger so this is actually what I
11:53 - wanted to get this right and hopefully I
11:56 - got this right this is what I want to go
12:00 - in here and this is going to be a little
12:04 - tricky to make happen actually what I'm
12:05 - gonna do I'm gonna do this here is now
12:08 - what I'm going to do is I'm going to
12:09 - just put this all on one line there
12:14 - might be a way for it to account for
12:15 - line breaks and stuff so I'm gonna take
12:18 - this now and I'm gonna put it in here
12:22 - [Music]
12:24 - let's see if this is really gonna work I
12:28 - didn't close the paragraph tag so let's
12:32 - see what happens here so I am now going
12:35 - to refresh this page I'm going to delete
12:39 - this one up here if you can see that I
12:41 - am going to I'm just gonna like click
12:46 - this okay air for for file not sound so
12:51 - I think there's a look a so there's a
12:53 - little bit of an issue here which is
12:55 - that and I'm gonna get to this if you
12:57 - actually need to host your JavaScript
12:59 - file somewhere and I have one that I
13:01 - already made and hosted somewhere let's
13:02 - see if I can get the one that I so this
13:04 - this won't really work in a sustainable
13:06 - way but what I can do I wonder if it
13:08 - doesn't like the whitespace either but I
13:10 - think more likely right what I need to
13:13 - do is just say this because what I want
13:18 - to do let's just make sure this is the
13:19 - right
13:19 - URL for that javascript code it is
13:24 - there's that JavaScript code of that URL
13:25 - so that that should allow it to point to
13:31 - the actual URL where that JavaScript
13:32 - code is hosted now what I'm gonna do is
13:37 - click this oops I made a really silly
13:44 - error
13:44 - I completely forgot that I need to have
13:46 - this say JavaScript at the beginning
13:48 - just miscellaneous JavaScript code in
13:51 - that URL is not gonna do any good so
13:54 - this has to say JavaScript sorry about
13:56 - that
13:57 - all right so let's try it now I'm gonna
13:59 - click on this bookmarklet and it made a
14:01 - kitten and we see the console log
14:02 - perfect so what I could do is I can now
14:05 - drag this up to here I could go to like
14:08 - my tutorial page I'm now on my tutorial
14:10 - page I'm gonna scroll to the middle
14:12 - somewhere where there's a bunch of
14:13 - paragraphs I'm gonna click the
14:14 - bookmarklet and all the paragraphs now
14:17 - say kitten yes so this is the basic idea
14:20 - of making a bookmarklet what you need to
14:22 - do and it's obviously a little trickier
14:24 - than I thought and you can see actually
14:25 - I actually just copy pasted the code for
14:28 - my tutorial but here it is right here
14:30 - I can just basically all I need to do is
14:34 - have this boilerplate code that points
14:39 - to a JavaScript program that's hosted
14:42 - somewhere and then what it does is that
14:47 - JavaScript program does something parses
14:49 - the web page changes them stuff anything
14:51 - is possible there now there's a couple
14:53 - things I want to mention about this
14:54 - browsers browsers love love love love
14:57 - love to cache your stuff so if I don't
15:02 - know if we're gonna if this is gonna
15:03 - happen but let's see if we can make this
15:04 - happen if I change this now to say puppy
15:09 - right and I go back to and refresh this
15:13 - page and click the bookmarklet like does
15:16 - say puppy so it worked but I've
15:19 - definitely been in a situation where I
15:20 - changed the code and the bookmarklet
15:23 - didn't actually update when it when I
15:26 - when I executed it so way that you can
15:28 - get around this I actually have it here
15:31 - in this tutorial so I'll just come in
15:33 - you
15:33 - to add a kind of arbitrary URL argument
15:37 - which is like the turn date and time
15:41 - which will force it'll make the URL
15:43 - appear different to the page that's
15:45 - loading the JavaScript code and will
15:46 - force it to reload so I'm gonna leave
15:48 - that out of adding that in but you can
15:50 - when I publish the code for this example
15:52 - I'll include that as part of the code
15:55 - now what I've shown you so far it
15:58 - doesn't really do you any good what I
16:00 - least what I'm going to do is I'm going
16:02 - to show you this is actually a piece of
16:07 - JavaScript code that's basically the
16:08 - same thing that just takes all the
16:10 - paragraphs and changes their background
16:12 - color to some purple so the way that you
16:15 - really want to do this is you want to
16:17 - host your JavaScript code somewhere
16:18 - permanent and then what you want is for
16:21 - the bookmarklet
16:23 - to reference not like referencing
16:26 - localhost is no good it's gonna work on
16:28 - my computer but you want to reference a
16:30 - URL that's actually out there somewhere
16:32 - in the cloud the nice thing about this
16:34 - is as people use your bookmarklet I mean
16:38 - there's a there is a sort of security
16:39 - question here you can change your
16:41 - bookmarklets code and they don't have to
16:43 - reinstall it because the the actual code
16:46 - that they have in the bookmarklet is
16:47 - just pointing to another javascript file
16:49 - and that javascript file can be updated
16:50 - ok so maybe I'll come back and do a
16:52 - coding challenge over but so sending
16:54 - your creative bookmarklets that change
16:57 - images the kittens or puppies or
16:58 - rainbows and unicorns or whatever and
17:01 - all sorts of unserved more creative
17:03 - ideas than what i can think of right now
17:04 - but I'm gonna now move into Chrome
17:07 - extensions we can do I'm gonna start by
17:09 - making a Chrome extension that does
17:11 - exactly the same thing but with this
17:13 - kind of code that alters your view of a
17:15 - web page in a Chrome extension there's
17:17 - going to be a lot more possibilities of
17:19 - what you can do beyond that ok so thanks
17:21 - for watching this bookmarklet tutorial
17:23 - and I'll see you in the next one
17:29 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello this video tutorial where I'm going to show you how to make a very simple basic bookmarklet and this is really a warmup my goal here in the next video and the video after that and the video after that is to start looking at Chrome extensions Chrome extensions are a much more powerful way to affect the browsing experience as a whole and actually the interface elements and all sorts of stuff in the Chrome browser but a bookmarklet is a really quick and easy way to add a button that's like a bookmark that triggers some code that changes your browsing experience so let's look at how that works so before I get to that I'm gonna leave it es5 which is and not use some of the fancier newer JavaScript syntax just to sort of demonstrate the simplicity of the idea but I I'm sure that it will get people watching who will help suggest fancier ways to write the same code and I look forward to including that in the material supplemental materials that'll be linked from this video's description so if you've ever made a function in JavaScript you might have done this function you know hello curly bracket curly no parentheses parentheses curly bracket curly bracket if I want to execute this function I want to run that function I would just say hello with the parentheses that means execute this function so now you are probably aware I'm looking for my eraser here it is you are probably aware that in JavaScript functions could be anonymous meaning they don't have to have a name and it can just look like this but then how do you execute the function so typically you might

execute the function with the name and these two parentheses I can actually just execute the function by putting the two parentheses there so this is like an anonymous selfexecuting function again I think that's right there's some probably of appropriate technical term for it so this is actually somewhat a bookmarklet actually is and if I just put something like console dot log or alert maybe alert will be a good I think never I have this like mission in life to never ever use a JavaScript alert and I'm gonna somehow I'm gonna do that but I'm gonna break that mission that's it right now so I could say alert you know hello so if this were the code for my bookmarklet whatever the user presses the button or goes to that quoteunquote bookmark this code is gonna execute so this begs the question this is very simple idea a good and and now it's up to you like what do you put in here you can read you this is where you can start parsing and looking at what's on the webpage and changing it in real time with JavaScript but other question is where's this code go so now let's look at that all right so you might be aware that if you go so if you go to a URL and this you don't really see

I'm going to actually just type that code in right here in the address bar function that's gonna be really hard function curly bracket alert hello semicolon close curly bracket close parentheses parentheses parentheses so this is me saying I want to go to this URL it's JavaScript colon slash slash actually I don't think you need to slash slash if I'm thinking about this I think it's just

tag it could be a URL it could be it could be lots of things one of the things that can be is actual JavaScript code so for example that same thing that I typed JavaScript colon function oh I need to put a parentheses around the function function parentheses curly bracket alert hello close quote close parenthesis close curly bracket close parentheses execute so now let's try refreshing this page and now whenever I click on that it runs that JavaScript code now guess what if I wanted to bookmark a URL all the whole thing like if I like here I have a bookmark up here to the rainbow topics github repository if I click Edit all this is is a name for this particular URL a bookmarklet is just a named set of JavaScript code so I can now say I can now write if actually what I could I could have created but I can't really just drag this up here and you can see look at that now I have this here and every time you I click on it I get that alert click alert click alert and if I go edit we can see this is just this now its URL encoded it did that for me because a quote is not a valid a valid character in a URL so the this has been URL encoded meaning % 27 you'll often see like % 20 that means space % 27 currently means single quote I think so you can see you can write it this way now so in a way we're done yay we made a bookmarklet but we haven't really done anything yet like here's the thing is this really sustainable is this the thing like oh my goodness and I how am I going to send what if I want to do something really elaborate I want to crawl I want to look at all the content on that web page and I want to find all the paragraph elements and I want to look anytime the word puppy is in there I want to change the word puppy to kitten so it's a it's a bookmarklet that changes puppies the kittens or swap images out or change the background color of every web page to a random color all these things are possible but working with kind of trying to write the code in here is going to be so incredibly awkward like how am I gonna really develop because I can't really have line breaks or spaces very easily here so there is a strategy that is used quite often so the next step that I want to show you is how could I write all of my bookmarklet code in a separate JavaScript file and then simply point to it from here so in other words what I want to say is new file I'm just gonna call it book mark lit a s and then what I want to do is I want to be able to write the bookmarklet in a way that's much like easier for me to follow and debug so for example something that I might do is I might say you know console.log bookmarklet starting and then I might say and now I don't have access to there is a way to gain access to JavaScript libraries like I could have jQuery or p5 be a part of what I'm doing but I'm gonna just do stuff with native JavaScript so I could say for example you know let P paragraphs equal equal document get elements by tag name us P and then I could say for let I equals 0 I is less than paragraphs length I plus plus and I could say paragraphs index i dot inner HTML equals so this is me like kind of doing a little version of the deletion Esther word list web like we find all the paragraphs on the page and just set their inner HTML to nothing or I could say it's at their inner HTML to kitten so this now if I wanted to I could put all of this into that JavaScript URL and I could like remove all the the I could remove all the white space and probably make it work but what I could do that's a little bit easier is and I'm gonna I'm gonna just type this out on this in this text document for a second down here is I could actually say all right so this is kind of the and I could write that this anonymous function and then what I can do is one of the things you can do in JavaScript is add elements to the web page and so the element that I want to add is a script so I'm going to say let script equal document dot create element script and then what I want to do is I want to add that change the source script source equal to book mark lit a s so I want the source to point to this other JavaScript file and then I want to say document.body.appendchild script so in other words this is kind of some boilerplate code that can basically say any I this just a point to a different javascript file that's gonna have all this other stuff and it tons and tons of code and then just load that and execute that code whenever the bookmarklet is is trigger so this is actually what I wanted to get this right and hopefully I got this right this is what I want to go in here and this is going to be a little tricky to make happen actually what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do this here is now what I'm going to do is I'm going to just put this all on one line there might be a way for it to account for line breaks and stuff so I'm gonna take this now and I'm gonna put it in here let's see if this is really gonna work I didn't close the paragraph tag so let's see what happens here so I am now going to refresh this page I'm going to delete this one up here if you can see that I am going to I'm just gonna like click this okay air for for file not sound so I think there's a look a so there's a little bit of an issue here which is that and I'm gonna get to this if you actually need to host your JavaScript file somewhere and I have one that I already made and hosted somewhere let's see if I can get the one that I so this this won't really work in a sustainable way but what I can do I wonder if it doesn't like the whitespace either but I think more likely right what I need to do is just say this because what I want to do let's just make sure this is the right URL for that javascript code it is there's that JavaScript code of that URL so that that should allow it to point to the actual URL where that JavaScript code is hosted now what I'm gonna do is click this oops I made a really silly error I completely forgot that I need to have this say JavaScript at the beginning just miscellaneous JavaScript code in that URL is not gonna do any good so this has to say JavaScript sorry about that all right so let's try it now I'm gonna click on this bookmarklet and it made a kitten and we see the console log perfect so what I could do is I can now drag this up to here I could go to like my tutorial page I'm now on my tutorial page I'm gonna scroll to the middle somewhere where there's a bunch of paragraphs I'm gonna click the bookmarklet and all the paragraphs now say kitten yes so this is the basic idea of making a bookmarklet what you need to do and it's obviously a little trickier than I thought and you can see actually I actually just copy pasted the code for my tutorial but here it is right here I can just basically all I need to do is have this boilerplate code that points to a JavaScript program that's hosted somewhere and then what it does is that JavaScript program does something parses the web page changes them stuff anything is possible there now there's a couple things I want to mention about this browsers browsers love love love love love to cache your stuff so if I don't know if we're gonna if this is gonna happen but let's see if we can make this happen if I change this now to say puppy right and I go back to and refresh this page and click the bookmarklet like does say puppy so it worked but I've definitely been in a situation where I changed the code and the bookmarklet didn't actually update when it when I when I executed it so way that you can get around this I actually have it here in this tutorial so I'll just come in you to add a kind of arbitrary URL argument which is like the turn date and time which will force it'll make the URL appear different to the page that's loading the JavaScript code and will force it to reload so I'm gonna leave that out of adding that in but you can when I publish the code for this example I'll include that as part of the code now what I've shown you so far it doesn't really do you any good what I least what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you this is actually a piece of JavaScript code that's basically the same thing that just takes all the paragraphs and changes their background color to some purple so the way that you really want to do this is you want to host your JavaScript code somewhere permanent and then what you want is for the bookmarklet to reference not like referencing localhost is no good it's gonna work on my computer but you want to reference a URL that's actually out there somewhere in the cloud the nice thing about this is as people use your bookmarklet I mean there's a there is a sort of security question here you can change your bookmarklets code and they don't have to reinstall it because the the actual code that they have in the bookmarklet is just pointing to another javascript file and that javascript file can be updated ok so maybe I'll come back and do a coding challenge over but so sending your creative bookmarklets that change images the kittens or puppies or rainbows and unicorns or whatever and all sorts of unserved more creative ideas than what i can think of right now but I'm gonna now move into Chrome extensions we can do I'm gonna start by making a Chrome extension that does exactly the same thing but with this kind of code that alters your view of a web page in a Chrome extension there's going to be a lot more possibilities of what you can do beyond that ok so thanks for watching this bookmarklet tutorial and I'll see you in the next one
