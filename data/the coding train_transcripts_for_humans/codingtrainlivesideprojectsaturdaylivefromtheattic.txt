06:04 - which means my mic is on i see a picture
06:07 - of me
06:09 - i see chat happening i think i might

06:28 - hang out with all of you
06:29 - and chat for a bit um let's start with
06:32 - our
06:32 - ceremonial reading of the random numbers
06:36 - to get warmed up uh we have a new member
06:38 - um i would love to know the proper
06:40 - pronunciation of moyne khan's name
06:43 - um khan

07:45 - 80 315
07:47 - [Music]
07:49 - 76 806. thank you
07:52 - this has been random numbers with the
07:55 - coding train
07:56 - i'll see you again next saturday
07:59 - wouldn't that be great that's what i
08:01 - should just do
08:03 - just like a two minute live stream i
08:04 - don't even know if it was two minutes
08:06 - there's a very loud noise over there and
08:08 - you might think it was like a
08:09 - rabbit or a raccoon or some sort of
08:12 - strange creature who's made its way into
08:14 - the attic with me but no
08:15 - it's my cat i have two cats i don't know
08:19 - which one it is
08:20 - because i can't see it there's a huge
08:21 - mess in this attic
08:24 - where i set up this streaming equipment
08:26 - i pushed everything to the side
08:28 - [Music]
08:32 - book is going back the music is muting
08:36 - and uh where i want to start with is by
08:39 - thanking today's sponsor
08:41 - which i don't necessarily do right at
08:42 - the beginning but i've got to do today
08:44 - because today's sponsor is letting me or
08:48 - allowing me or facilitating me or
08:49 - giving me the opportunity to show you a
08:51 - little behind the scenes of the coding
08:53 - train today's
08:54 - coding train is sponsored by lg yes lg
08:57 - life's good
08:59 - uh i have a button a new button it says
09:01 - lg on my stream deck i'm gonna press it
09:02 - i'm a little bit afraid
09:04 - i don't have the setup where like it
09:05 - shows me what i'm gonna show you first
09:06 - let's just go right into it
09:08 - there it is this is my new lg
09:11 - ultra wide 34 inch monitor
09:15 - you can find links to this monitor in
09:16 - the video's description
09:18 - and this has totally been a game changer
09:20 - for me um what i'm showing you here is
09:22 - my sort of con like i'm over here by the
09:24 - way hello
09:25 - um i'm showing you my console for where
09:27 - what i look at when i'm always like
09:28 - looking in this direction
09:30 - while live streaming this is a new setup
09:32 - at home and
09:33 - over here you can see this is open
09:35 - broadcast studio where you've got the
09:37 - uh repeating recursive
09:40 - video inside video inside video uh
09:42 - forever pattern
09:43 - um where i can kind of monitor my mic
09:46 - level down here if i were to play some
09:48 - music
09:50 - oh what
09:53 - it's not working i don't know why the oh
09:56 - oh i don't have the laptop audio added
09:58 - oh look i'm going to show you i'm going
09:59 - to add it right now
10:01 - this is what i do audio source
10:04 - audio audio input capture add existing
10:07 - laptop sound this was a new
10:09 - uh there we go and so now i can see the
10:11 - laptop audio
10:12 - uh i've got my um by the way my stream
10:14 - deck over here where i can just mute
10:16 - that laptop audio really quickly
10:18 - but i want to just turn it off um and
10:20 - then
10:21 - over here i am monitoring the youtube
10:23 - chat so for example
10:25 - uh i see that uh marcos
10:28 - says whoa look at that real estate yeah
10:30 - 34 inches of water it's like it's like
10:32 - mind blowing
10:33 - i need two of these actually i it's like
10:35 - so much that i just want another one
10:37 - maybe lg will send me another one ah
10:39 - it's okay
10:39 - one thank you mwah thank you for this
10:41 - one monitor um
10:43 - and uh uh saying yay coding garden is
10:47 - alive which i'm not sure if that means
10:49 - coding guardians live is that coding
10:50 - garden live also at the same time
10:52 - oh my god what is the cat doing i gotta
10:55 - go get that cat in a second
10:56 - do you hear it
11:00 - you can hear that rustling right what is
11:02 - the cat gotten into
11:04 - oh my god um uh i think someone confused
11:07 - me for the coding garden
11:09 - or maybe cj is live at the same time all
11:11 - right so i'm reading the chat um have
11:12 - you connected your laptop to your
11:14 - monitor yes
11:14 - so i also use this for coding um and
11:17 - maybe i'll show you that midway through
11:18 - the live stream
11:19 - i have a um i put up my like browser
11:22 - window
11:23 - uh with the javascript console hold on
11:26 - hold on something's happening
11:28 - is the cat stuck no he's in a box
11:32 - it's okay it's entertaining for the for
11:34 - the viewers
11:39 - they can hear you you know
11:43 - um i forgot what i was talking about
11:47 - uh and no i'm not talking to you i'm
11:49 - talking to the
11:50 - millions of people of the internet i
11:52 - know i'm sorry
11:56 - um what is going on here uh one of my
12:00 - cats
12:01 - chewed through a mouse wire once called
12:03 - said both xp that's not good
12:05 - um but wait i was showing all the pieces
12:08 - of my console here
12:10 - so i have the chat oh right you're
12:12 - asking about coding with it so when i
12:13 - use it for coding which i will show you
12:16 - i put up like the javascript console my
12:19 - terminal window
12:20 - [Music]
12:23 - all the different pieces of things that
12:25 - i need to look at
12:26 - while i am working on stuff and then i
12:29 - actually then my laptop which is here
12:30 - which you can't easily see but i'll pull
12:32 - it up
12:32 - i usually actually keep my code on the
12:34 - laptop and this is just my secondary
12:36 - display
12:37 - for all the debugging i have like i'll
12:39 - put like the p5 reference over here
12:40 - but anyway this side should just show
12:42 - you so much room for roblox
12:44 - says unoriginal and yes this is actually
12:45 - the main problem
12:47 - uh with having this monitor this is the
12:49 - sole reason why my children
12:52 - decide they insist on using this
12:54 - workstation because they want to play
12:56 - roblox
12:56 - only on this monitor uh and so that kind
12:59 - of drives me a little bit crazy and then
13:00 - they start unplugging and moving these
13:02 - around i have to reset everything up
13:03 - again it's kind of a nightmare
13:04 - but they did make this beautiful lego
13:07 - and i can also
13:08 - um not yet a sponsor show you my
13:10 - technivore mocha master
13:13 - which i will now pour into my cup
13:23 - um and um
13:27 - what was i saying oh and then i wanted
13:28 - to show you the discord chat
13:30 - so this is what's going on if you would
13:31 - like to become a coding trained member
13:33 - that's one way you can support the
13:34 - coding train uh well anybody can join
13:36 - the discord but i'm looking at
13:38 - a um live chat of discord over here and
13:41 - also i can see
13:42 - my little graph here on youtube studio
13:45 - of
13:45 - the concurrent number of viewers it says
13:47 - here that 574 people are watching with a
13:49 - chat rate of 34
13:51 - blah blah blah see this graph is going
13:52 - up come on people let's have that graph
13:54 - go up
13:55 - so um just to mention a few other things
13:59 - about the monitor
14:00 - uh it is 34 inches 21 by nine
14:03 - do that math uh ip uh wq hd
14:06 - ips display it's a 99 color gamut
14:10 - i don't even know how to pronounce that
14:11 - word but i think that just means
14:12 - basically you can see every color
14:14 - an hdr10 uh multitasking dual controller
14:17 - on-screen control amd freesync
14:19 - technology a three-sided
14:21 - you can see this virtual borderless
14:22 - design there's basically
14:24 - no bezel or border here at all um
14:27 - and it has this uh wonderful uh a giant
14:29 - a
14:30 - height adjustable stand that you can
14:31 - tilt and uh move up and down which i'm
14:33 - afraid to do right now for like breaking
14:35 - my whole setup
14:36 - all right so thank you lg um you can
14:39 - find links to
14:40 - more about this monitor in the video's
14:43 - description and maybe i'll try to do
14:44 - some coding on it a little bit
14:46 - later back to me
14:51 - uh so how are you all doing
14:58 - the cat was taken away it's very sad
15:02 - um and i'm like
15:06 - now uh let's see uh teach us coding now
15:09 - please
15:10 - says gabriel wood what kind of coffee
15:12 - are you drinking if you could believe
15:13 - this
15:15 - i forgot the name of the brand but
15:16 - something organic and it says
15:18 - on the uh it says low acid because you
15:21 - know i'm
15:21 - i'm a very sensitive soul i have a weak
15:24 - constitution
15:26 - and uh i really have to wash my caffeine
15:31 - intake and my you know acidic intake
15:35 - i don't know if it makes a difference
15:37 - but
15:39 - all right stretch stretch stretch
15:42 - let's start with sharing some
15:47 - uh
15:47 - [Music]
15:51 - oh wait oh no that's the wrong music
15:55 - projects from you the community of the
15:58 - coding train
15:58 - thank you for being you you are for
16:01 - making your own creative coding projects
16:03 - and or sharing them with me on the
16:05 - codingtrain.com website
16:08 - which i will now maybe show to you ah
16:11 - here is my laptop
16:12 - i am in the corner with my green screen
16:14 - um i do have kind of an issue that i
16:16 - wanted to ask about
16:17 - let me just pause this for a second so
16:19 - because we've got this like nice little
16:20 - extra camera for today
16:22 - if i go back where i was showing you the
16:24 - monitor um i can also sort of move to
16:26 - the side
16:27 - here and you can see that's my green
16:30 - screen
16:30 - and i have these um by the way these are
16:32 - the lights that will blink these are
16:34 - phillips hue lights and they'll blink i
16:36 - have it set up to blink if someone joins
16:37 - as a member
16:38 - um and i thought i was like oh this
16:39 - brilliant idea i have which is to like
16:42 - put the lights around the green screen
16:46 - to fill
16:46 - it in so that there's no shadows but um
16:50 - one thing that i'm noticing and you
16:51 - can't really see it um
16:54 - but um with the sony alpha camera i have
16:57 - when i
16:58 - look at it without the chroma key maybe
16:59 - i'll show you that real fast
17:02 - so if i go here and i go
17:05 - to um i'm in camera only
17:09 - and i go to this thing and i go to
17:11 - properties
17:13 - and no no filters
17:16 - and i turn off the chroma key do you see
17:19 - that waviness over here
17:21 - that's like the frequency of the light
17:23 - the leds
17:24 - that don't match up with maybe the
17:26 - frequency of the camera
17:28 - oh my goodness topher has joined we're
17:30 - gonna have to say hello oh
17:31 - and there's the blinking so at least
17:34 - it's nice that you can see that right
17:35 - now
17:35 - um and we uh if i could press the button
17:38 - fast enough
17:39 - you might actually see it there you go
17:41 - um but
17:42 - um i would like to figure out how to
17:46 - clean that up a little bit or maybe i
17:48 - just shouldn't use these leds
17:49 - and something else for the sort of
17:51 - backfill of the green screen but i was
17:52 - curious if anybody has some advice on
17:54 - that let me put the filter back
17:56 - on uh close and back to
18:00 - the laptop oh no back to me where we
18:02 - will say
18:04 - welcome to topher
18:09 - jay who has been a supporter of the
18:11 - coding train for many many years
18:14 - we're always in there got a moderation
18:16 - thing we've communicated on many an
18:18 - occasion and now just today
18:22 - topher wanted to see that blinking and
18:24 - guess what topher for your membership
18:26 - with the coding train i blink my lights
18:28 - for you
18:31 - i gotta give you a random number too is
18:34 - somebody keeping track of these random
18:35 - numbers maybe people keep track of their
18:37 - own random numbers what if somebody has
18:38 - the same random number
18:39 - we should get shirts i'm a proud coding
18:41 - trade member my number is
18:44 - 21 121 there you go
18:47 - uh but i forgot what we were doing we
18:49 - were doing
18:51 - community project sharing time which is
18:54 - a thing that i like to do on saturdays
18:57 - to share the work of those of you who
18:59 - watch coding training video tutorials
19:01 - and contribute your contributions for
19:03 - example
19:04 - maybe you recently watched the marching
19:07 - squares
19:08 - uh cabana video and made something like
19:12 - oh i know unoriginal pun is watching
19:14 - like
19:14 - marching rays and if i click over here
19:18 - wait wait wait wait wait wait stop
19:20 - everybody hold hold
19:22 - this is wild okay let me see if i
19:24 - understand this
19:26 - the marching squares uh algorithm is
19:30 - one that looks for contours around
19:33 - um oh no
19:37 - you people you have to stop joining
19:42 - crosson mesh kawakkar
19:46 - thank you for joining the coding train
19:49 - with your membership you won the award
19:51 - of interrupting me
19:52 - while i was doing something very
19:53 - important by showing unoriginal puns
19:56 - wonderful community contribution but
20:00 - i thank you for your support and your
20:02 - membership i will blow my train whistle
20:04 - and maybe even someday
20:05 - you'll receive some stickers in the mail
20:08 - i would love to send you a baseball i
20:09 - got my smarter everyday baseball the
20:10 - other day and i forgot to bring it home
20:12 - i'm so sad because i have a place on the
20:14 - shelf it went to my
20:16 - work address and et cetera et cetera et
20:18 - cetera anyway
20:19 - [Music]
20:21 - i already lost this chat is too active
20:25 - and i've now lost it just says member
20:28 - this youtube interface oh there we go
20:29 - prasa mesh uh your random number
20:34 - is let's make this more dramatic
20:38 - [Music]
20:45 - your random number is
20:54 - [Music]
20:59 - this is a very long sound effect it's
21:01 - got seven more seconds
21:03 - what happens at the end i have no idea
21:05 - [Music]
21:08 - 88 771
21:13 - this i better turn back over here to
21:16 - fulfill
21:17 - my destiny to become an ad man
21:22 - it's very sad that's kind of nice
21:24 - actually and and i'm very grateful for
21:26 - my
21:27 - uh well i don't know what the next part
21:30 - of that sentence is
21:31 - uh back to here okay no here
21:35 - so this if i understand it correctly is
21:38 - um
21:38 - the marching squares algorithm which you
21:40 - can see i don't know if this is using
21:41 - noise or just randomness created these
21:43 - contours and
21:44 - then the ray marching algorithm
21:48 - which uh emanates uh rays
21:51 - from this uh shining
21:54 - smiley face and hits the contours and
21:58 - stops
21:59 - it don't seem to be running rather slow
22:00 - i'm curious if that is true for
22:02 - everybody
22:03 - or if it is um
22:07 - just for
22:11 - me sometimes i feel like stuff runs
22:13 - super slow on my laptop when i'm
22:15 - streaming because i've got things
22:16 - all connected doing like a million
22:18 - different things oh and i forgot i'm not
22:20 - in the picture
22:21 - um today's mug by the way i have like a
22:24 - collection of mugs
22:26 - this is really embarrassing usually i
22:27 - show you my math mug let's see if this
22:29 - one will auto focus on it
22:30 - i clear castle which i actually got
22:34 - visiting high cure class just just just
22:36 - to say like it's not like i got this in
22:38 - the mail i was there
22:40 - and i picked up a mug years ago back
22:44 - when there was a world to move around in
22:46 - and now we just exist
22:49 - in floating in space with green screens
22:51 - talking to each other over the internet
22:52 - which i'm very
22:53 - again once grateful for this connection
22:56 - to the outside world that i have
22:58 - um from my attic um in brooklyn
23:02 - uh how's the audio by the way because i
23:06 - have the mic
23:08 - on original punch saying don't look at
23:09 - the code the mic is
23:12 - um pretty far from me today but
23:15 - i could move up closer to it and speak
23:17 - to you
23:19 - in a different kind of way
23:22 - i hope you all shut this off now by the
23:26 - way i think
23:26 - streaming really on saturday has
23:27 - definitely increased my numbers this is
23:29 - way more people
23:30 - than are usually watching um i will show
23:33 - you it here on my behind the scenes view
23:35 - 673 right now okay uh
23:39 - too many buttons all right now um you'd
23:42 - think that i would just bookmark the
23:44 - wheel
23:44 - that david snyder made but i can't
23:46 - manage to do that
23:48 - so let's go to codingtrainwebs let's
23:49 - also address something
23:51 - let us talk about hacktoberfest for a
23:54 - moment
23:56 - i don't know what to say about this um
24:02 - hacktoberfest
24:04 - i i believe it's put on by digitalocean
24:06 - yes presented by digitalocean
24:08 - is a month-long um
24:13 - event digital event i guess it's a
24:16 - month-long
24:17 - program where if you support some open
24:20 - source projects
24:22 - by contributing you will pick a limited
24:25 - edition t-shirt or plan to treat
24:27 - well that's nice that they offer that
24:31 - option for sort of like making less
24:34 - stuff
24:34 - in the world than planting a tree
24:36 - instead um
24:38 - and i i think this is coming from a very
24:40 - good place it's i've enjoyed this
24:42 - program before
24:43 - i don't mean to be critical of it i am
24:45 - experiencing some difficulty and i would
24:47 - like to just speak to the community
24:49 - about this
24:50 - because it's creating a lot of work for
24:52 - um essentially what our
24:53 - volunt some volunteers who help maintain
24:55 - these repos
24:57 - um i do have um people who work for the
24:59 - coding train and
25:00 - as well and that's a tricky balance that
25:02 - i'm always trying to strike
25:04 - um but uh if i go to pull requests here
25:08 - and i'm gonna go to i believe this is
25:10 - the repo where we're seeing the most of
25:11 - this traffic
25:12 - let me move this over um let's go to
25:16 - closed um and we're going to see
25:20 - improved a bit improved docs minor edits
25:23 - improve docs improve dock modify docs
25:25 - update readme correction of typing say
25:26 - improve docs improve docs improve doc
25:28 - improve doct
25:29 - improve docs improve watch down docs
25:30 - improve docs there's a lot of work
25:32 - to and it's a lot of email notifications
25:35 - i get a notification
25:36 - for every single pull request i don't
25:39 - necessarily look at everyone or i don't
25:40 - get to it before somebody else does
25:42 - um and this is kind of a problem so um i
25:46 - don't know how
25:47 - um this can be addressed on a from the
25:50 - sort of open source community at large
25:51 - on a larger scale
25:53 - but at least in our small local
25:55 - community here i want to thank um
25:56 - violet graham many people who have been
25:58 - helping with this um and you can sort of
26:00 - see
26:01 - uh for example if i clicked on this one
26:03 - improved a bit
26:04 - we'll see that gypsy dangerous added
26:06 - invalid and closed
26:07 - this issue this is like work it's a
26:09 - significant amount of work to do
26:12 - um but i want to go over to the issues
26:15 - where
26:16 - thank you to violet craze they um
26:19 - created this issue to sort of help
26:21 - people think about a
26:22 - positive and productive way to
26:24 - contribute um
26:28 - and it's violet is also in the chat
26:31 - telling me
26:33 - and marcus is asking why are those
26:34 - invalid so let's go we'll look at one
26:36 - and see
26:37 - hopefully hopefully we marked it
26:38 - correctly we might be making mistakes
26:40 - because of the amount of noise and
26:42 - traffic
26:43 - um and okay
26:46 - which i like i have to say by moving my
26:48 - head up and down
26:50 - i gotta practice that more i was asking
26:52 - if i record i don't record the saturday
26:54 - live streams to disc maybe i should
26:56 - i don't have as powerful a computer i
26:58 - could always it's
26:59 - it's it's being archived through youtube
27:01 - which who knows if that will last for
27:02 - posterity and maybe i should keep my own
27:04 - track of that but um yeah let me i have
27:07 - to think about that but sorry all right
27:08 - wait wait wait bunch of things
27:09 - so uh profit match is saying you can add
27:13 - tags to the progress yeah so that the
27:15 - invalid tag is something we added let me
27:17 - go back to this
27:18 - um and by the way i'm gonna be here
27:21 - until about noon
27:22 - and once again i just i should be clear
27:24 - like i've really segmented out
27:27 - my tutorial making process which i have
27:30 - uh two new tutorials that i've recorded
27:32 - that are coming out soon and my live
27:33 - streaming process which is just like
27:35 - hanging out and kind of goofing off
27:37 - so there might not be a lot of anything
27:39 - happening today
27:40 - so all of you you maybe i can get this
27:43 - number down below 500 it seems like
27:45 - there shouldn't be this many people in
27:46 - the world who actually want to watch
27:47 - what this is right now
27:48 - so i encourage you to you know move
27:50 - along or put this on in the background
27:52 - and
27:52 - um you know i don't i don't have a plan
27:55 - i'm just kind of winging it here okay
27:57 - um let's look at one of these pull
28:00 - requests
28:01 - um that's marked as invalid um
28:05 - wait am i in the right place oh i need
28:07 - to go to the closed ones
28:09 - um we'll just go to this
28:12 - um first usually the one you can really
28:14 - tell by just called improved a bit
28:16 - um and if i click on this one um you can
28:20 - see that there hasn't nothing was
28:22 - there's nothing here in the pull request
28:23 - comment other than the template so this
28:25 - is our template
28:27 - um if i go here to files changed um
28:30 - i can go here and you can see there's
28:31 - just one little change tell me about
28:34 - how much you love blueberries what is
28:36 - this from
28:37 - it's one of my program with text
28:39 - tutorials it just changed it to how much
28:41 - do you love blueberries
28:42 - so there's nothing malicious really i
28:44 - think about this
28:46 - um and i probably should have been more
28:47 - thoughtful about like i don't mean to be
28:49 - calling out a
28:50 - single person and no i'm not showing
28:52 - their i their name was their username
28:54 - was shown and
28:55 - um i think they're probably their
28:57 - intentions are good in many ways and
28:59 - um but this kind of noise makes it hard
29:03 - to
29:03 - manage the community um so that's why
29:06 - it's marked as invalid
29:07 - because it's clearly to me it seems that
29:10 - it is a pull request with the intention
29:12 - of making a trivial change
29:13 - to be able to accumulate for pull
29:15 - requests for the hacktoberfest
29:17 - um thing so um
29:21 - but what i wanted to i wanted to be
29:22 - positive about this so
29:24 - uh i think you you you should
29:27 - participate
29:28 - um and contribute to open source and
29:31 - this um issue that um
29:32 - violet craze um they added is
29:36 - a a wonderful guide to how you can make
29:39 - a productive and
29:40 - positive pull request to the coding
29:42 - train and
29:43 - to be clear you will never be criticized
29:46 - well
29:46 - hopefully it's up to us to um live up to
29:49 - these ideals so you know
29:51 - please let us know if we're doing it but
29:54 - it is the coding trains desire
29:56 - me my desire and people who help
29:58 - participate and manage the community
29:59 - to never um yell at somebody or put them
30:03 - down
30:03 - or criticize their code this is an open
30:07 - inclusive welcoming space for you to try
30:09 - contributing open source
30:10 - you can get it wrong and we'll help you
30:12 - try to get it right and there is no
30:13 - right or wrong
30:14 - but um here are some things that you
30:16 - could do so for example i'm going to
30:18 - show you some community contributions
30:19 - if you made your own project based on
30:21 - one of the videos you can submit it to
30:23 - the coding train website through a pull
30:24 - request
30:25 - that's what this is under number one um
30:27 - this ten print for example
30:29 - i don't know if it's still true is the
30:30 - one is one of the videos that has had
30:33 - historically the most community
30:34 - contributions
30:38 - you can um all right hold on a second i
30:41 - gotta mute my
30:46 - [Music]
30:49 - maybe you can't hear
30:52 - bear with me for one second
31:04 - [Music]
31:25 - [Music]
31:30 - so
31:32 - [Music]
31:45 - all right i'm back uh sorry about that
31:46 - quick digression
31:49 - uh back here we are um so you can make
31:52 - something
31:53 - um and
31:56 - uh add your creation oh this is these
31:58 - are the steps to follow so these are the
32:00 - steps to follow
32:01 - um in terms of a nice way that you can
32:03 - contribute your own work
32:05 - um there okay sorry sorry about that um
32:08 - all right now um
32:12 - oh okay uh so where did i want to show
32:15 - community contributions but thank you to
32:16 - k weekman
32:18 - who um uh lifted a good question from
32:21 - the chat
32:21 - from uh mushi next and turtle joe
32:24 - players are you sure those are real
32:25 - people's names are you just making is
32:27 - this your question okay weak mom you
32:28 - just
32:29 - wanted to no okay um
32:34 - and violet is saying these are steps for
32:36 - making a community contribution have
32:37 - meaning to make some other issues with
32:39 - other suggestions
32:40 - but the those aren't there yet but this
32:42 - is these are helpful steps and i
32:44 - actually also have
32:45 - um uh i think if i search for community
32:49 - contribution
32:51 - uh coding train um i i'm pretty sure
32:54 - that yeah
32:54 - this particular video how to add your
32:57 - contribution to the coding grade website
32:58 - will also come up because
32:59 - i pretty much have a video for
33:00 - everything okay um and then there also
33:03 - is this other guide
33:04 - which has that video on it anyway okay
33:06 - where was i uh so the question from the
33:08 - chat is
33:09 - how much time did it take to learn
33:11 - javascript
33:13 - well i don't know if my answer to that
33:15 - question is obvious but i would say a
33:16 - lifetime
33:17 - i don't think there ever is a moment
33:19 - where you finish
33:21 - learning coding have learned it now i
33:24 - do it it is uh and certainly in my
33:26 - experience
33:27 - you know i started very late in life um
33:30 - well not
33:31 - relative to when most people start
33:32 - coding certainly now in terms of it
33:34 - being integrated into
33:36 - um or educating education systems
33:39 - but i have been doing it now for almost
33:40 - 20 years and i have to relearn it over
33:43 - and over again because it's a constantly
33:45 - moving target
33:46 - um but i know you asked specifically
33:48 - about javascript for me
33:49 - i can only really speak to my experience
33:52 - um i started i don't remember
33:53 - when it was but i should look back and
33:56 - find this but
33:57 - javascript i certainly didn't really
33:58 - program in until i would i want to say
34:00 - like 2015
34:02 - maybe a little bit earlier than that um
34:04 - and i think
34:06 - i spent a year bef of sort of like
34:09 - figuring it out and i'm still
34:11 - definitely still figuring out but i
34:12 - don't know that i felt comfortable
34:14 - in javascript the language um
34:18 - for for at least a year and also like i
34:20 - don't know
34:22 - 80 percent of the 90 whatever the
34:25 - percentage is
34:26 - of things that people who work
34:27 - professionally uh developing for
34:29 - front-end and back-end web stuff and
34:31 - other things in javascript no
34:33 - maybe they don't know 80 of the things
34:35 - that i know i don't know but like
34:37 - i don't know most of the like frameworks
34:38 - that people use i don't know how some of
34:40 - the latest
34:41 - yesterday i was trying someone was
34:42 - telling explain to me what axios is
34:45 - um and so um there's
34:48 - there's so much always to learn okay um
34:52 - all right so marcos is fact-checking me
34:54 - said i believe you were already teaching
34:56 - javascript before
34:57 - okay i don't think so maybe maybe i was
35:01 - we'll have to look
35:05 - is there a way to connect a node.js that
35:06 - uses discord.js with a processing p5
35:08 - sketch aloho
35:10 - um that is coming soon on the coding
35:12 - train all right i gotta move
35:13 - move along here let's get back to our
35:16 - community contributions we are going to
35:18 - spin the wheel
35:20 - which i can only ever find
35:23 - by scrolling down into issues to this
35:25 - one called real link
35:27 - did i bookmark it maybe i'll bookmark it
35:30 - and here
35:31 - thank you to gypsy dangerous for helping
35:34 - to create this
35:34 - wheel um by the way um i think this is a
35:38 - project now that i'm using it regularly
35:40 - we could
35:40 - uh could use some attention we could
35:42 - make some improvements to it
35:44 - um a we should you know something to do
35:47 - is to check to see if the data that it's
35:49 - drawing from is up to date
35:50 - that's a lot of work to do i don't know
35:51 - how to best manage that but
35:53 - um also i've mentioned like i like the
35:55 - idea of maybe some of the people's names
35:56 - populating instead of numbers but here
35:58 - we go let us
36:00 - spin the wheel i would say there is a
36:01 - high probability that we'll be looking
36:03 - at one of
36:03 - the gypsy dangerous projects
36:05 - [Music]
36:08 - uh i'm joking gypsy dangerous has
36:11 - uh submitted so many projects there's no
36:13 - this is not a rigged wheel here
36:15 - number 41 we're gonna take a look ah
36:18 - have i looked at this before i mean the
36:20 - problem is i've looked at so many of
36:21 - these i remember what i've looked at
36:22 - live or not
36:24 - um
36:26 - uh prime spiral phylotaxis contributed
36:30 - by sam lee
36:31 - so this is based off of the coding video
36:34 - phylotaxis
36:36 - um that the and if this is uh if i look
36:39 - at the orig i like to just sort of look
36:41 - at the original example
36:42 - which is here you can see this is the
36:44 - original example from that
36:45 - particular video and now you will all
36:50 - contribute to hacktoberfest with no spam
36:54 - pull requests
36:56 - only productive useful pull request
37:00 - yes i am hypnotizing you the open source
37:03 - community
37:04 - you will get your t-shirt but you could
37:06 - also plant a tree
37:09 - all right did that work hopefully the
37:10 - internet has been fixed
37:12 - i fixed it everybody thank you
37:16 - all right what was i doing yes aha uh
37:19 - prime spiral phylotaxis
37:21 - oh and using um codepen so one of the
37:24 - things i always like to see
37:25 - is different code editors and platforms
37:28 - um
37:29 - perhaps this i would i get um this is
37:32 - also using looks like native canvas oh
37:35 - and d3
37:36 - we can see here the code so this is
37:38 - really um wonderful to see i especially
37:40 - enjoy seeing people who take the concept
37:42 - and use it with a different environment
37:44 - and so this to me i believe
37:46 - is also known as the ulam spiral i don't
37:48 - know if i'm pronouncing that correctly
37:50 - i've been meaning to do a video about it
37:53 - in fact um
37:54 - at one point i had this conversation
37:56 - with um stand up maths
37:57 - matt parker about this spiral and i
38:01 - have like a nap i still have like i
38:02 - don't think i kept the napkin but i
38:04 - kept the photo of it it's like in my
38:06 - email like as an email reminder from
38:07 - like three years ago
38:09 - but uh the prime spiral is oh uh
38:12 - um the set of prime numbers devised by
38:15 - mathematician stanislaw ulam
38:17 - 1963. so i believe
38:20 - it is a uh way for sure
38:23 - somebody tell me if i'm right about this
38:25 - um that i think you can sort of like
38:28 - follow a spiral pattern and then a dot
38:31 - appear and sort of like
38:32 - as you're counting the steps a dot
38:33 - appears for a prime number
38:35 - and um you sort of can learn quite a bit
38:38 - about the density of prime numbers and a
38:40 - pattern that's kind of
38:41 - revealed by looking for this uh yeah so
38:43 - you can see here this is sort of like
38:44 - the spiral
38:45 - and then so this would be an awesome
38:47 - coding in the cabana
38:48 - coding challenge video um one thing i
38:50 - haven't really figured out now that i
38:52 - have my regular schedule
38:54 - is how to do the coding in the cabana
38:55 - videos i don't have an extra day of the
38:57 - week
38:59 - uh unfortunately so i again i could take
39:01 - a one of these saturdays off and try to
39:02 - record one
39:04 - um i had some ambitions there but anyway
39:07 - um thank you uh dombo
39:10 - um for your wonderful you can't really
39:14 - can you see the blinking lights
39:16 - you can see my face is kind of like
39:17 - blinking right
39:20 - um all right thank you for that uh sam
39:22 - lee let's look at
39:29 - one more community contribution because
39:31 - i
39:32 - talk so much and spend so much time and
39:34 - it's sort of hard for me to look at more
39:35 - than just two okay
39:38 - spinning the wheel the wheel
39:43 - and we have landed on i feel like it's
39:45 - good that they're numbers it fits with
39:46 - the random number
39:47 - you know we should create instead of a
39:48 - wheel we should have a book
39:51 - that just flips pages and picks a random
39:54 - one
39:57 - uh number six you selected
40:01 - nika cruchell random walker with colors
40:05 - okay so the original challenge is random
40:07 - walk
40:08 - um which is this one very simple
40:11 - algorithm
40:12 - um to move a dot randomly in four
40:15 - different directions and trace its path
40:18 - and if we go back here let's see what we
40:20 - see here
40:21 - from mika so a couple things i love
40:25 - about this
40:26 - uh this is wonderful thank you for
40:27 - sharing this oh sure first of all it's
40:29 - visualizing pi
40:30 - so i love this so one of the things
40:33 - that's interesting
40:34 - to me about the digits of pi
40:37 - is the sort of question around uh
40:40 - detectable
40:40 - is there a detectable pattern or no is
40:43 - what is the distribution of digits
40:45 - um is this visually distinguishable at
40:48 - all between a pure random walk um
40:52 - but an eye just looking at this just
40:54 - assumed here's a random walk
40:56 - larger steps and colors now i wonder
40:58 - here i believe the length it looks to me
41:01 - like the length of the step
41:02 - might be tied to the digit or the color
41:04 - i don't know but that would be an
41:05 - interesting thing to try
41:06 - right when you get one move just one
41:09 - pixel
41:10 - four move four pixels or maybe you pick
41:13 - the direction based on the number
41:15 - i don't know i i wonder how this was
41:17 - done each oh
41:18 - it says right down here read the manual
41:20 - folks each angle corresponds to a digit
41:22 - of pi
41:23 - so you could have the an angle that
41:25 - corresponds maybe a length
41:26 - um the color there's so many uh possible
41:29 - ways
41:30 - uh pi day is a while from now but that's
41:33 - that there's always wonderful
41:35 - possibilities to think about
41:36 - visualizing the digits mapping the
41:38 - numbers to various
41:40 - um parameters within a design system
41:46 - okay um thank you for these wonderful
41:49 - two community contributions
41:51 - um i do try to check them all out the
41:53 - community really enjoys them one thing
41:54 - that's
41:55 - wonderful for me especially also is and
41:58 - i'll just show you an example of this in
41:59 - my nyu class this week um
42:02 - we were looking at how to make your own
42:05 - pose classifier
42:06 - which i cover in this particular video
42:09 - and it was like a wonderful thing for me
42:11 - to be able to show like the students
42:12 - homework was basically to make their own
42:14 - version of this
42:15 - and i have um four uh uh
42:18 - or five just examples of things other
42:20 - people things have made
42:21 - um just right here for us to look at in
42:24 - class and look at look at the halo of
42:26 - the sun right around me right now
42:30 - [Music]
42:32 - it's a little sad how i'm always trying
42:34 - to like make myself giffable
42:36 - [Music]
42:37 - oh that's one thing i wanted to look at
42:39 - today was the um
42:42 - tenor
42:44 - uh gif tender.com
42:46 - [Music]
42:48 - tenor gif api all right let's figure out
42:50 - what we're doing today
42:52 - now it's 10 40. um
42:58 - i just named unoriginal punishing i name
43:00 - dropped matt parker i don't know
43:02 - [Music]
43:04 - i didn't mean to be doing that
43:09 - by the way matt parker is not who i
43:11 - think of when i hear the name matt
43:12 - parker because i know somebody else
43:13 - named matt parker who i talk to all the
43:14 - time
43:15 - actually i don't talk to all the time
43:16 - but i used to more often and i i should
43:19 - anyway what i'm talking about
43:23 - i'm getting a little clamped up here
43:25 - okay um
43:29 - what's next i think i might need some
43:31 - help here
43:31 - [Music]
43:33 - no no
43:35 - [Music]
43:38 - all right first of all let's log in
43:44 - [Music]
43:49 - here we go so uh oh
43:54 - wait we've got some we've got a problem
43:55 - [Music]
43:57 - this doesn't usually happen to me uh i
44:00 - have a very good connection here at home
44:04 - um where's that button here um i'm
44:06 - getting a message here
44:08 - uh right here it says youtube is not
44:09 - receiving enough video to maintain
44:12 - smooth streaming as such viewers will
44:14 - experience
44:16 - open widget so i click that stream
44:18 - health
44:19 - poor this has not happened to me
44:23 - uh recently um so hopefully you're all
44:26 - seeing this
44:26 - oh yeah you feel like 7.5 stream per
44:28 - second all right we're gonna try
44:30 - to address this shoot
44:33 - i i was concerned this would happen when
44:36 - i started streaming from home
44:37 - i do have uh an expensive you know
44:41 - i paid for like the highest bandwidth
44:43 - possible through the uh
44:45 - um theory of fiber line but one thing i
44:48 - think there's probably a lot of people
44:50 - in my house using the internet
44:51 - i'm gonna go to my wi-fi settings and
44:54 - give
44:54 - the this pc priority so we'll see if
44:58 - this uh
44:58 - helps um
45:10 - um i can also
45:12 - [Music]
45:16 - let's just see i'm gonna um i could also
45:18 - check my i have a mesh
45:20 - maybe one of them got unplugged
45:28 - um which maybe i'll go check when i take
45:30 - a break but hold on let me let me do the
45:31 - wi-fi priority thing and see if this
45:33 - helps
45:34 - so i'm going to wi-fi um
45:41 - let's see desktop windows device
45:45 - up um can i i don't want to pause it if
45:48 - i go to devices set priority device
45:51 - desk this must be the i have so many
45:53 - devices
45:55 - it's got to be the windows one that's
45:56 - the machine okay
45:58 - um for let's prioritize it for two hours
46:03 - uh check
46:07 - um i know i i i want to it looks fine oh
46:10 - wait and it's back
46:11 - it's back to excellent okay great so um
46:16 - i would like to run um
46:19 - uh an ethernet line uh up to the attic
46:22 - but i just don't
46:23 - i guess i could get like a super long
46:25 - cable and just like plug it
46:26 - like run it up the stairs and plug it in
46:29 - just on saturday mornings
46:30 - um but i did get an uh uh some new
46:34 - mesh base stations and i put one right
46:36 - up here and i so
46:37 - i the signal has been very good um but i
46:40 - guess that happens from time to time
46:41 - okay the warning is gone now
46:43 - um all right hopefully that will not
46:45 - come back so let's take a look at this
46:47 - so um ah this is something i wanna let's
46:50 - make a list
46:52 - um now just for a second here i had some
46:55 - things
46:56 - open that i don't want to open oh yeah
47:00 - well actually this list is fine
47:05 - but let's just make a new one uh all
47:08 - right
47:09 - sorry everybody this is silly what i'm
47:11 - doing
47:13 - where to come up with some possibilities
47:16 - i should work on the live poll app
47:18 - so that people could vote in real time i
47:21 - know simon will
47:22 - will want me to do that oh it got lower
47:24 - when i was using the filo taxes that's
47:26 - interesting
47:26 - uh where am i here okay so um i want to
47:30 - look at body picks 2.0
47:34 - um i have made yesterday i recorded
47:37 - a this is done now i recorded a video
47:39 - tutorial on
47:40 - machine object detection models um so
47:42 - hopefully that'll get edited and
47:43 - released in the next week or so
47:45 - um um this this
47:49 - these are things i need to record as
47:50 - tutorials ah um
47:52 - i would like to uh download
47:55 - all code coding train captions
47:59 - that's something i want to work on
48:00 - because i want to train a model for that
48:02 - um these are things i want to do uh this
48:06 - is really a tutorial i want to record
48:08 - so these are all um um a tenor gif
48:11 - api something we could play with um
48:15 - i need to figure out um this question
48:18 - about
48:18 - fetch plus twitter or axios
48:22 - that's something i could work on today
48:24 - um
48:25 - and then um i want i don't think i'm
48:27 - gonna do this right now the everyday
48:29 - calendar is behind but i um behind the
48:32 - green screen for today but i
48:34 - want to um do serial
48:37 - um i want to do camera
48:40 - pixels over serial
48:43 - to everyday calendar so that's the thing
48:46 - i want to do
48:48 - and then there's the live poll uh
48:52 - application which is sort of like a
48:53 - little project that i'm trying to work
48:55 - on
48:55 - anything else um
49:01 - anything else that twitch has an
49:03 - integrated poll system i know
49:06 - what am i doing here
49:09 - oh youtube i cannot i cannot quit you
49:14 - youtube
49:16 - yes am i saying it wrong um
49:20 - it's actually the live poll application
49:21 - would be a perfect thing for me to work
49:23 - on briefly while showing you
49:25 - uh a coding setup like this so i might
49:28 - do that um
49:30 - in a bit this is weird okay um
49:33 - let's um this time this i can't do right
49:37 - now i feel like i'd have to
49:39 - unplug actually i could but it's so
49:41 - bright in here right now that i i should
49:43 - be
49:43 - i should work with the everyday calendar
49:44 - at night um
49:48 - i'm just looking at the chat to see if
49:50 - there's any uh
49:52 - everybody people seem to really like
49:54 - this poll application all right um these
49:58 - are
49:58 - four things five things that i really
50:00 - feel like would be worth
50:01 - taking a look at today um i think
50:07 - um this is yes
50:10 - the thing that i have for spinning
50:14 - okay
50:17 - here we go everyone
50:23 - oh i typed axis
50:27 - yes this should be axios you sure didn't
50:30 - autocorrect me or something okay
50:44 - oh
50:49 - interesting this is perfect actually
50:52 - because
50:52 - one of the reasons why i wanted to look
50:54 - at body pics uh
50:56 - was to figure out um
50:59 - if i could um use that particular
51:03 - machine learning model
51:04 - to control the everyday calendar um
51:08 - and so um i could do more
51:12 - more than one of these um some of these
51:14 - are going to be
51:15 - well famous last words an hour three
51:18 - hours later they're not that quick
51:20 - but um oh people are upset
51:25 - let's do a poll now i'm gonna work
51:28 - let me okay here's the give me 10
51:31 - minutes
51:34 - um i have a timer on my watch
51:38 - i set it for 10 minutes okay i'm going
51:40 - to allow myself
51:41 - 10 minutes to look at body picks 2 and
51:44 - whenever
51:47 - the 10 minutes is up i stop i take my
51:50 - break
51:51 - um people are saying body pick sounds in
51:54 - nsfw
51:55 - are not safe for work don't worry it is
51:57 - very safe for work it is a machine
51:59 - learning mod
51:59 - have you ever been on a zoom call where
52:01 - you used a virtual background
52:03 - guess what i'm not saying it's using
52:04 - body picks but it's using a
52:06 - machine learning model that separates uh
52:08 - foreground from background or the
52:10 - sort of contours your silhouette the
52:12 - pixels of your body
52:14 - from the background and that's exactly
52:15 - what body picks does um
52:17 - so uh then um
52:21 - let me just look at that really quickly
52:23 - i'm just i'll show people
52:25 - people don't seem happy with this choice
52:26 - anecdotally i don't i
52:28 - give myself 10 minutes okay um so first
52:31 - of all um if i go to learn.ml5js.org
52:35 - um this is actually a particular machine
52:37 - learning model that is in ml5
52:40 - if i click here under body pics and i
52:42 - scroll down
52:44 - and let's find just uh one of the oh
52:47 - you know what it's actually easier to do
52:49 - this i'm gonna go to examples
52:51 - um and i want to
52:56 - well let's look at this one that says
52:57 - image oh and actually whoops ah
53:00 - i'm the worst
53:03 - um let's go to the web editor once let's
53:05 - go to the one that says image
53:07 - um actually let's use the webcam because
53:08 - that's sort of the point of what i
53:09 - wanted to do
53:11 - uh webcam and i'm going to run it
53:14 - let's see what happens
53:17 - so this is what body pics does and you
53:19 - can see um it
53:21 - it allows you to create a mask um and
53:23 - you know of course i have a green screen
53:25 - here so that's giving me a lot of
53:27 - possibilities that i
53:28 - don't really need something like body
53:30 - picks for but if i were to
53:31 - uh have a much noisier background this
53:33 - particular machine learning model has
53:35 - been trained
53:36 - on segmented images images that have
53:39 - been labeled
53:40 - with people person body pixels versus uh
53:42 - background pixels
53:43 - so this is exact you know i'm not work
53:45 - at zoom i don't know how
53:47 - what they're using you know um exactly
53:50 - and and
53:50 - but zoom is a particular video call
53:53 - software that i use a lot right now and
53:54 - oh i have a video coming out about how
53:56 - to
53:57 - put a p5 p5.js sketch with a machine
54:00 - learning model into zoom oh i'm so
54:02 - excited about this
54:03 - i forgot about that gotta work on that
54:05 - this weekend um
54:07 - so but this is actually working quite
54:09 - well and this is what i was imagining
54:10 - using with the everyday calendar so if i
54:12 - could get
54:13 - with a machine learning model a very a
54:16 - clean
54:17 - or not it doesn't even have to be clean
54:20 - because it's so low i just want to get a
54:21 - silhouette from any generic video um
54:24 - oh but i was gonna do this with
54:25 - processing i don't know how we get body
54:27 - pics and processing that will be an
54:28 - interesting challenge
54:30 - um and um let's just let me just look up
54:34 - everyday calendar
54:35 - [Music]
54:37 - um so if you this is what it looks like
54:40 - it's simon yetches
54:41 - uh and so i worked on this last week
54:45 - to um
54:48 - to be able to control all of these
54:50 - different lights uh
54:52 - spots on the calendar individually and
54:54 - so um
54:55 - i could inconceivably walk up to it and
54:58 - see my reflection in it so to speak in
55:00 - real time that's what i want to do
55:01 - eventually
55:02 - now this particular ml5 example is using
55:05 - the original body pics machine learning
55:07 - model
55:08 - i believe this was trained and created
55:10 - by our researchers
55:12 - at google part of the tensorflow team
55:15 - and
55:16 - um that
55:19 - what was i saying here because i started
55:21 - looking at the chat and i forgot what i
55:22 - was saying
55:24 - ah there has been there is more recently
55:26 - a newer version body picks 2.0
55:29 - which has not um
55:33 - which is not in ml5 yet but hopefully in
55:35 - a future release soon enough so i want
55:37 - to look up
55:37 - body pics 2.0 tensorflow
55:41 - um updated and where is gonna yeah so
55:44 - let's look at
55:45 - this one of these
55:49 - um blog posts i mean this has been oh
55:51 - updated
55:52 - so let's do this body picks 2.0 has been
55:55 - released and you can see
55:56 - here in this demonstration image
55:59 - that not only does it do image
56:01 - segmentation for your
56:04 - body uh you know foreground versus
56:06 - background it
56:07 - there's key points here as well as your
56:10 - body itself is segmented into different
56:12 - parts
56:12 - so try the new demo let's try that i
56:15 - just want to see if this runs a lot
56:16 - faster
56:18 - and it does so you can see this the
56:21 - performance of this
56:22 - is much faster i don't know if it's more
56:24 - accurate
56:25 - than um
56:29 - than what what i just showed you in ml5
56:31 - but you can see this video the frame
56:33 - rate
56:33 - is very uh is very fluid and this demo
56:35 - is working very uh
56:36 - very well and i bet you if i switch it
56:38 - to one person
56:40 - um and then it can also try this other
56:43 - base model presumably
56:45 - um let's see what happens here
56:47 - [Music]
56:51 - um here's another base model with one
56:54 - person is this faster is this better i
56:56 - don't know
56:56 - so i wanted to try to get this working
57:00 - um but um i am
57:03 - i've already used up i have four minutes
57:07 - and 30 seconds left
57:08 - uh so i don't know four minutes yeah
57:11 - yeah yeah yeah
57:12 - i'm not talking to you
57:15 - um so um maybe i'll come back to this
57:22 - uh ten minutes sounds kind of short so
57:25 - simon maybe do a straw poll in the
57:28 - meantime
57:29 - ken maton is asking can we use ml5 in
57:32 - java in processing
57:33 - so this is a great question and so
57:37 - no in the sense that ml5 is a javascript
57:40 - library
57:41 - and it won't work just out of the box
57:44 - without
57:45 - you know any further work in processing
57:48 - but just about everything in ml5
57:52 - is a layer on top of tensorflow.js
57:55 - and tensorflow.js is a
57:58 - port or a port is exactly the right word
58:00 - but is the javascript
58:03 - implementation of the
58:06 - larger tensorflow machine learning
58:09 - library from google which is written in
58:10 - c
58:11 - plus most people interface with it
58:13 - through python
58:14 - but there are java bindings this has
58:17 - been like a fantasy project of mine
58:20 - yeah that's welcome to my fantasy java
58:22 - bindings for tensorflow what a likewise
58:24 - um um to uh look into this
58:28 - uh tensorflow for java um and
58:32 - try to see if i can get this running and
58:33 - processing anybody wants to work on this
58:35 - um
58:38 - hit me up don't hit me i don't have to i
58:41 - don't unfortunately just i don't believe
58:42 - i
58:42 - uh i don't i don't think i can i have
58:45 - the the time for this right now
58:46 - um in that especially that all my
58:48 - teaching is um so much focused
58:50 - on um
58:55 - um javascript these days okay oh it's
58:58 - getting warm
58:59 - it's very warm up here in the attic the
59:01 - sun is shining
59:04 - all right let's um
59:08 - let me take a few minute break i'll put
59:10 - up a straw poll just
59:12 - out of curiosity and i'm going to take a
59:13 - short break when i come back
59:15 - i want to try i want to show you uh
59:19 - work how i work on a node web
59:21 - application
59:22 - with a sort of like separate monitor
59:25 - setup
59:25 - um so i'll show you that um briefly
59:29 - um thank you to lg for the sponsorship
59:32 - and for sending me this uh
59:33 - monitor um and so that'll be at least a
59:36 - little bit on the live poll application
59:38 - but let's
59:39 - um let me go to a straw poll
59:44 - oh i don't i think i like the other one
59:46 - better i don't know why
59:52 - uh maybe i don't i don't know
59:56 - what were my choices well so this by the
59:58 - way if you pick body picks
60:01 - it would be me actually just trying to
60:02 - write my own code this no one's
60:04 - going to want but this is this is the
60:06 - first step to
60:07 - an ai model that would speak like me
60:10 - suppose potentially you know assuming
60:13 - that
60:14 - the captions of my videos there's a
60:16 - correlation there
60:18 - tender gif api which i do want to make a
60:20 - video tutorial for
60:22 - figure out fetch this i have to do for
60:24 - um this is just like twitter api i'm
60:26 - just gonna call this twitter api
60:28 - uh live poll application and
60:31 - i mean i could put this on there i'll
60:34 - take down that green screen but i think
60:35 - i should leave that out
60:36 - okay um
60:40 - you know what should i allow mo i wonder
60:42 - if it would be more accurate if i allow
60:43 - multiple choices
60:45 - because if you have to only pick one is
60:47 - that really an accurate reflection of
60:49 - what the community is interested in
60:52 - um i don't know let's do a poll
60:56 - as to whether i should allow multiple
60:57 - choices or not
61:01 - i guess i won't allow multiple choices
61:03 - i'm gonna allow multiple choice no
61:04 - uh i hope somebody answered this
61:06 - question for me
61:08 - i can't believe it's been an hour uh i
61:11 - see unoriginal pun is typing i'll wait a
61:13 - minute
61:14 - um chinchya mathur is asking did you try
61:17 - out openai gpt too i don't have beta
61:20 - access to gpt so gpg3 um you might be
61:24 - asking what is gpt-3 it's a
61:26 - a large language model that um allow
61:29 - multiple choices okay
61:30 - tetris make the list yeah tetris i could
61:33 - get started on i honestly would be happy
61:35 - to get started on that okay
61:37 - um let's create this poll all right so
61:40 - hopefully
61:41 - oh my timer is up perfect stop um
61:44 - hopefully uh somebody can
61:47 - put this poll into the chat you know
61:50 - sorry to everybody someone who's going
61:51 - to have to manually retype zxqq3v36w
61:55 - uh put that poll into the chat please um
61:58 - i will take a look at the results no
62:01 - votes wait what do i want
62:04 - um honestly for me i want to look at the
62:07 - twitter api although that might not be
62:09 - successful
62:10 - because i need that for my my class
62:13 - um i also um also this would be good to
62:16 - have because then i
62:17 - we could just use it all the time oh i
62:20 - i'm going to vote for them all
62:22 - i don't i don't know i'm not voting did
62:24 - somebody paste it in
62:26 - i'm still waiting to see it appear in
62:27 - the chat
62:29 - [Music]
62:33 - all right let me do it thank you to
62:35 - siobhan unfortunately you have to be
62:36 - there we go k weekman did it all right
62:37 - here we go
62:38 - uh results so will this show me in real
62:41 - time
62:42 - i will leave this up and i will be back
62:45 - oh i have to press refresh manually i
62:47 - will be back
62:48 - in just about five minutes
63:03 - [Music]
63:24 - [Music]
63:42 - so
63:44 - [Music]
63:58 - [Music]
64:10 - do
64:19 - [Music]
64:52 - do
64:55 - [Music]
65:34 - do
65:36 - [Music]
66:25 - [Music]
66:44 - so
66:48 - [Music]
67:03 - [Music]
67:18 - [Music]
67:40 - do
67:42 - [Music]
67:54 - do
67:56 - [Music]
68:08 - don't
68:24 - ah i
68:27 - am back i have an issue by the way first
68:30 - of all i just very warm up here so i got
68:31 - rid of my sweatshirt
68:33 - um i have an issue with my stream deck
68:36 - it often like starts to like just
68:38 - work really really slowly like for
68:39 - example i'm gonna press
68:41 - now the laptop only scene
68:46 - and there it finally appears and then
68:48 - i'm gonna press again
68:50 - the uh to put myself back
68:54 - and like i don't understand why it's
68:57 - it's usually
68:57 - when it's working it's instantaneous
68:59 - it's very responsive
69:01 - and i i've tried so many things
69:03 - reinstalling uninstalling
69:05 - i don't know if anybody's experienced
69:06 - this but if you use the elgato stream
69:08 - deck product let me know
69:10 - all right so it looks like the results
69:13 - are
69:13 - fairly clear and i think that's good um
69:16 - this is kind of like a learning project
69:18 - for me um
69:20 - kind of learning more about server-side
69:22 - programming
69:24 - learning more about networking i gotta
69:26 - refresh my knowledge and understanding
69:28 - of web sockets which i think i might
69:30 - want to use
69:32 - well that's not entirely necessary and
69:34 - then mostly while the reason why
69:35 - i'm doing this is because i want to work
69:39 - on
69:39 - more interactive um
69:43 - overlays for uh live streaming
69:46 - so and um that's something that by the
69:48 - way
69:51 - i don't think i'm gonna run this right
69:52 - now but i the the video that i'm going
69:55 - to release
69:56 - shows you how to create an overlay in
70:00 - a um video call so it actually will work
70:03 - with
70:04 - the video i use zoom platform um but
70:07 - it's it's i use open broadcast studio to
70:09 - create a virtual camera and then i can
70:10 - create a layout with overlays in open
70:12 - broadcast studio
70:13 - then i can train a machine learning
70:14 - model to recognize when i'm saying
70:16 - raising my hand
70:17 - and put like an animation of like i have
70:19 - a question in front of me or something
70:20 - like that
70:21 - this came from an idea that i referenced
70:23 - in the video from a twitter user cameron
70:25 - hunter
70:26 - um so anyway um that's also why i'm
70:30 - working on this because i like the idea
70:32 - of just
70:33 - overlays in general sort of augmenting a
70:36 - live video stream
70:37 - and so that's that's that's kind of the
70:38 - focus that i want to work on all right
70:40 - um i'm also going to use this as
70:42 - a sort of perfect confluence here as an
70:44 - opportunity again to sort of thank the
70:46 - sponsor lg who sent me this
70:47 - particular monitor that i'll talk about
70:49 - because i want to what i'm going to do
70:50 - is set
70:50 - up um my coding environment on this
70:54 - monitor now i have to do something a
70:55 - little bit odd
70:56 - to do that so the first thing and by the
70:59 - way you can find links to about this
71:00 - monitor in the video's description
71:02 - um the thing that i'm going to do
71:04 - unfortunately
71:06 - is the what's coming out of the laptop
71:08 - right now the hdmi cable that's coming
71:10 - out of the laptop
71:11 - is going into the streaming pc
71:15 - so i'm going to unplug that
71:18 - kind of dangerous here and plug it into
71:20 - the monitor
71:23 - so um i'm doing that right now so there
71:26 - it is
71:28 - [Music]
71:29 - then um i actually should have um
71:33 - one thing that's uh wonderful about the
71:36 - monitor is how just this is how like
71:38 - well it works
71:40 - for example how do i get back to that
71:41 - it's already giving me a message like oh
71:44 - you've connected a new external input
71:47 - and you want to use it i could have
71:48 - clicked yes
71:50 - has this nice button on the bottom i can
71:52 - just go over here to input and i can
71:54 - switch it oops
71:55 - um go over to input and i can switch
71:59 - up i believe i'm in hdmi one and i
72:01 - should
72:02 - see oh i can't see my streaming console
72:05 - anymore
72:05 - oh look at this it auto i don't know why
72:08 - but for whatever reason i've got the
72:09 - cozy
72:10 - coding um
72:14 - uh background can i change that change
72:16 - that so
72:17 - by the way i can't see anymore what i'm
72:19 - live streaming
72:20 - i guess i could go and look watch the
72:22 - live stream on my laptop wow my console
72:24 - is gone
72:25 - like am i still live streaming do you
72:27 - see it near me you could tell me but i
72:28 - don't know
72:29 - i guess you could um if you like i could
72:31 - look at the disc you know what i'm gonna
72:32 - do
72:33 - i've got um discord on my phone here so
72:36 - please codingtrain members
72:41 - if you could communicate with me in the
72:45 - [Music]
72:48 - coding train live chat
72:51 - um
72:54 - um i'm looking at that chat right here
72:59 - and let me know if i'm still live
73:01 - streaming and showing you anything
73:02 - that you can that useful so let's let's
73:04 - get a picture of gloria pickle
73:07 - uh i've got to find my mouse again
73:11 - this is crazy where's my mouse
73:15 - it's so much screen space
73:19 - do you see me do you see me i don't know
73:20 - where what's who's seeing me where
73:23 - uh all right um where's my mouse i gotta
73:26 - find my mouse
73:28 - it's so much screen space that i can't
73:29 - there it is
73:32 - uh which way
73:35 - is this way uh
73:38 - okay hold on this is really crazy that i
73:41 - can't find my mouse
73:44 - give me a second here um let me try
73:47 - unplugging it for a second here because
73:49 - i can get my mouse back
73:51 - on um
73:54 - this screen can plug it back in
74:06 - stream is still good okay please keep me
74:09 - um posted uh i'm looking for displays
74:14 - and i'm going to say arrangement
74:18 - okay that's perfect so i'm going to the
74:20 - right when i want my mouse to come over
74:22 - here there's my mouse
74:24 - and then i can go back to desktop
74:27 - and i'm going to bring my mouse over and
74:29 - i want to pick
74:31 - gloria there we go there's gloria pickle
74:34 - oh she is so cute
74:36 - all right so now i've got this picture
74:38 - of gloria pickle and now i'm going to
74:40 - start
74:40 - setting up my coding environment
74:45 - so first of all let me just um say
74:48 - uh quickly that this particular monitor
74:52 - um is um
74:56 - the lg ultra wide 34 inch um monitor
75:00 - um it has rgb 99 color gamut in hdr 10
75:03 - multitasking dual controller on screen
75:05 - control
75:06 - amd freesync technology three side
75:08 - virtually borderless design
75:10 - and a tilt height adjustable stand and
75:12 - by the way
75:13 - it's really nice to play roblox on in
75:16 - addition to coding on so please check
75:17 - out the just
75:18 - the links to it in the video's
75:20 - description um
75:22 - all right so now what i'm going to do is
75:25 - i'm going to go to
75:25 - i term open that up and i'm going to
75:29 - bring that over here
75:31 - okay
75:32 - [Music]
75:34 - all right you're finally going to need
75:36 - to use the
75:37 - cursor trails is that still a thing all
75:40 - right
75:41 - try to keep your messages in the discord
75:44 - chat right now
75:45 - to like important things where i have to
75:48 - like fix the thing on the live stream
75:49 - because i cannot see my console right
75:51 - now
75:52 - um all right so that is so let's go to
75:55 - uh desktop you i don't you probably
75:57 - can't actually
75:58 - read what i'm doing so um
76:01 - live poll we're gonna go to the live
76:03 - poll app um
76:05 - then i am going to uh
76:08 - get a browser window
76:12 - i'm going to bring that over here this
76:15 - is what i like to do
76:17 - i have i can run um
76:20 - so and i can say let's let's look if i
76:23 - do
76:23 - index.js and i go to localhost 3000
76:29 - i love you localhost 3000
76:32 - we can see there's the live poll um and
76:35 - i can
76:36 - i can have so much screen real estate
76:38 - that i can have
76:39 - both the web app that i'm working on as
76:42 - well as sort of javascript console
76:44 - for errors right here um i can put this
76:48 - up here then what i will also often do
76:52 - uh while i'm coding is and i'm coming
76:55 - back to my monitor here
76:57 - i will go to like um
77:00 - have my references
77:06 - wait what
77:09 - here um i will have my reference
77:13 - uh up here so i'm typically this would
77:16 - be like the p5 reference potentially
77:22 - so this is how i like to have a setup so
77:24 - i have like node here
77:26 - mp5js.org and i might go on to the
77:29 - reference
77:30 - and then you know if i and and then of
77:33 - course there's the actual code
77:35 - and so the actual code itself i will um
77:38 - have on this laptop so i'm gonna
77:40 - um open up another tab here i'm going to
77:43 - say code i'm looking at the chat no one
77:45 - has said anything i can't see
77:47 - the youtube chat right now and i'm going
77:50 - to open up
77:51 - um this and basically what this allows
77:55 - even though i'm having all this trouble
77:56 - with my mouse right now as soon as i'm
77:58 - done
77:59 - [Music]
78:02 - and i have the code open basically
78:05 - um and actually a really good thing that
78:08 - i could do to improve this setup
78:12 - would be to um well actually i'm not
78:14 - going to do that right now
78:16 - so the nice thing that i could do here
78:18 - is
78:21 - just fix this
78:25 - um i can so if i'm going to make a
78:27 - change like right now i'm
78:28 - i want to change that to be blue and i'm
78:31 - going to add some
78:31 - a console log like console.log
78:35 - test um and i can just
78:39 - uh it's going to refresh it and i can
78:41 - see here ah there's my console logo is
78:43 - there an error
78:44 - i'm changing the code like i'm typing
78:46 - over here
78:47 - and then ah it's now yellow if
78:50 - i want to do stuff in terminal
78:54 - i can just do that over here and i'm
78:56 - able to do this
78:57 - without like moving the mouse around
78:59 - because i can just switch between
79:00 - windows very easily so i always keep the
79:02 - mouse
79:02 - and my code editor on this here but
79:05 - certainly if i were just using this
79:06 - monitor like
79:07 - it doesn't have it doesn't have to be a
79:08 - secondary monitor there's enough screen
79:10 - real estate that i could very easily
79:11 - just fit my
79:13 - um code editor uh in a panel here
79:16 - the terminal here so many possibilities
79:18 - so let's
79:19 - let's try to just um start thinking
79:21 - about how
79:22 - to work on this let me remind myself
79:25 - what is this live poll application
79:27 - so the idea is that i have a server
79:30 - well i have done nothing on this so i'm
79:32 - looking at the code right now there's a
79:33 - lot to work on and it's about 1120 now
79:35 - know how much further we'll get
79:37 - but the idea is that i want to run a
79:39 - server that
79:41 - anybody could look could go to a web
79:43 - page and the server is going to serve
79:44 - that web page
79:45 - and allow them to vote in one of four
79:48 - options
79:49 - then the server is going to keep track
79:50 - of all of the votes
79:53 - and then display them in real time on
79:56 - a web page and this web page i would
80:00 - then show as an overlay onto
80:05 - my um onto my live stream
80:10 - makes sense um let me go back to
80:15 - my i'm very disturbed by not having my
80:18 - live stream console
80:20 - so i just want to see that
80:23 - uh okay great so i'm back to my live
80:26 - stream console i don't know why it's
80:28 - detected a new device here and discord
80:32 - um this is really like i mean coding
80:34 - with a large monitor
80:35 - is awesome but having running a live
80:38 - stream
80:39 - on your own in an attic you don't know
80:41 - how i would do it
80:42 - without having all this screen real
80:44 - estate um and simon's pointing out you
80:46 - can't see the code which is why i'm
80:47 - going to
80:48 - switch back now to actually doing this
80:51 - from my laptop in the usual way i just
80:53 - wanted to show you that configuration
80:55 - which is incredibly convenient
80:57 - for working on a project
81:00 - all right so i'm going to switch the
81:02 - hdmi plug
81:04 - again i think you'll be able to see me
81:06 - do that
81:08 - i'm coming over here
81:11 - hello so i'm just taking this hdmi cable
81:15 - which was connected to my laptop
81:17 - and i am now plugging it into the
81:19 - capture computer for live streaming
81:23 - so that shouldn't change anything that
81:25 - you see it's going to change a lot of
81:26 - things for me
81:30 - um and
81:34 - um i've got my console back and i
81:38 - hopefully
81:39 - can switch back to this view yep
81:43 - and here we are and here's the code so
81:46 - and now everything that i open now now
81:47 - here's the thing this is why it's so
81:49 - great to have a secondary monitor
81:51 - um because now i have everything
81:54 - uh on one uh screen here so i have to
81:57 - sort of like
81:57 - alt tab between all the various things
81:59 - which i'm used to doing while i'm
82:00 - streaming it's no problem
82:02 - but they're all sort of in separate
82:04 - places okay
82:05 - so let's think about how we're gonna do
82:08 - this
82:10 - my children are arguing can you hear
82:12 - that
82:13 - argue with each other hopefully it
82:14 - doesn't get too intense all right so
82:17 - the main thing that i need to do i think
82:19 - first is to have
82:20 - some kind of database on the server
82:23 - that's keeping track of the votes
82:26 - and i like this particular node package
82:30 - called nedb
82:32 - or any db which is a very lightweight
82:35 - database
82:37 - so let's try i mean i could just use a
82:40 - json file frankly
82:41 - and that's what this is but let me
82:43 - install
82:45 - [Music]
82:46 - nedb
82:51 - and let me run this which i like to do
82:54 - whenever it tells me to
82:56 - and then let's go down to the code
83:00 - and see i want to uh acquire it
83:08 - require
83:11 - and also i use this in my intro to data
83:16 - and apis so i think i would
83:20 - like to
83:25 - find those those examples would be
83:27 - helpful
83:28 - um do i use it here data selfie app
83:31 - just just take a look at this for
83:33 - reference um yeah
83:35 - so this is what i do and then i create a
83:37 - data store
83:38 - and load the database so let's also do
83:41 - that
83:44 - and then i want to create us one route
83:49 - uh which is just like a vote route
83:52 - should i i think i could probably get
83:54 - away with it just being
83:56 - a get request but it should probably be
83:58 - a post when you vote should it be a post
84:00 - or a get does that matter
84:02 - so i get you know the words get and post
84:09 - what's that loud noise
84:13 - okay um all right let's see
84:17 - um let me think about this
84:23 - let's just work with a get request right
84:24 - now
84:26 - um called vote hey
84:29 - vote register to vote
84:32 - um and um
84:36 - i'm going to add in this exact
84:40 - thing so we're going to set up a route
84:43 - and i realize i'm kind of jumping a lot
84:44 - of you might not be familiar with
84:46 - anything that i'm doing
84:47 - that's a little bit what this side
84:48 - project saturday is
84:51 - um and
84:56 - um
85:01 - um i don't need any of this sorry i'm
85:04 - being distracted by lots of
85:06 - noises and i just want to get
85:09 - a parameter here
85:13 - um let's just do console.log
85:16 - is this how i do it request.params
85:22 - so i want to create a route a get
85:23 - request so get versus post
85:26 - an http request is a request that a
85:28 - client like you're on a web page
85:30 - you type in the server your google.com
85:32 - or whatever it is you're typing in
85:33 - you make a get request please give me
85:35 - the stuff a post request is like
85:37 - ah i'm going to send you some stuff and
85:39 - you could give me a reply but you can
85:40 - use a get with a get request you can
85:42 - sort of send information
85:43 - that is like a parameter to the get
85:46 - request so i think i'm going to use that
85:47 - right now
85:48 - um and then um
85:52 - respond no response
85:56 - dot send uh hello is this right
85:59 - so i think if i set up this route
86:02 - and i restart the server
86:06 - and maybe i should use nodemon um
86:09 - so nodemon or node monitor
86:13 - is a way to run a node
86:17 - um a node application where any time you
86:19 - change the code it will auto restart
86:21 - and so i want that to be a global module
86:23 - so i think if i say npm install
86:25 - g nodemon
86:32 - did that work and then i think i could
86:34 - say nodemon index.js
86:37 - so you can see here to restart it
86:40 - anytime
86:40 - enter rs watching paths watching
86:43 - extensions
86:44 - starting so now in theory
86:47 - if i did this
86:51 - you can see it restarted the server so i
86:52 - don't have to remember to do that
86:53 - sometimes i want to intentionally
86:55 - stop and start the server but this um
87:00 - so if i go to local host 3000
87:04 - a vote i get hello friends
87:09 - um and now if i do uh no i want to use
87:13 - um maybe i should use those like reston
87:16 - routes
87:16 - so if i do vote slash a
87:20 - um if i do
87:23 - i think if i configure it like this
87:27 - choice then
87:32 - then is this what i do so this becomes i
87:35 - don't know the terms for this
87:37 - choice becomes like a variable basically
87:39 - and is it in request.params
87:41 - is that where i find it request params
87:44 - poll
87:45 - and then i think i could do console.log
87:46 - request prints uh choice
87:49 - i think this is how i do it so now
87:54 - um and so let's um
87:57 - i'm gonna do i'm gonna just send some
87:59 - json back
88:01 - um and i'm gonna send vote
88:04 - uh
88:08 - i'm gonna co i'm gonna get the choice
88:12 - and i'm going to say vote choice
88:16 - okay so now
88:19 - great so and whatever i put here
88:23 - i will get that back so i know that's
88:24 - being logged in the server now probably
88:27 - you know oh there's so many things to
88:30 - think about when you create a web
88:31 - application and i'm going to make one
88:33 - that all of you are going to be able to
88:34 - probably like
88:36 - destroy and hack and ruin very quickly
88:39 - so um but you know such is life
88:45 - so now in the database
88:49 - how do i add something to the database
88:53 - um this is the date
88:56 - insert so i can cr i can
89:00 - insert something but i don't want to
89:03 - i want to keep track of a k oh
89:06 - i almost want to just use my own json
89:08 - file i want to update
89:11 - update is what i want to do if it
89:12 - doesn't exist
89:14 - so wait i have a lot of control here
89:17 - over what's going on
89:19 - let's insert um
89:26 - so like if i say uh
89:29 - just for the sake of argument choice a
89:32 - is a zero
89:36 - like this is oh no no
89:39 - um this is so confusing
89:43 - like label is this what i want to do
89:47 - um it seems silly to use um
89:51 - i guess i want to make a poll object
89:56 - yeah maybe i should just make do this
89:58 - poll
90:00 - uh i don't need a separate entry for
90:02 - every choice every entry to the database
90:04 - is a particular poll that makes more
90:06 - sense so the poll
90:08 - has a 0 b 0
90:11 - c let's just say it's gonna have four
90:13 - choices right now
90:15 - and then um
90:21 - database insert poll
90:25 - so if i do this
90:31 - there it is now i don't want to do that
90:33 - anymore
90:35 - i don't want to insert another one so
90:38 - let's take this out i just want to have
90:39 - one i have to think about
90:41 - how you insert a pole but now uh
90:46 - this is why i don't uh uh database
90:50 - and see what happens here great
90:54 - uh so and it should be that in the
90:57 - database is just this one poll
91:00 - hmm
91:04 - so i could have just do this without a
91:05 - database at first and just use
91:07 - persistent memory while running the node
91:09 - server but because i'm going to restart
91:10 - the node server so many times i need to
91:12 - save the votes
91:13 - like i want to like save and reload the
91:16 - votes
91:17 - so i probably need a separate interface
91:19 - for adding polls
91:20 - um and then which one i'm loading but
91:22 - this is just going to be the only
91:24 - uh poll and then i should give the poll
91:28 - a name like i should
91:29 - be able to look it up by a name maybe
91:32 - this is the unique key
91:33 - there's so much to think about here and
91:35 - i'm just trying to like skip 90
91:37 - of those steps uh yes paul
91:40 - and simon is right the vote route should
91:42 - look like vote poll idea
91:45 - choice perfect thank you so let me do
91:47 - that
91:48 - um let me go back to i like this idea so
91:51 - i that was just my like quick way of
91:52 - adding something to the database
91:55 - and then so now this should be poll id
92:00 - choice let's try this
92:05 - and so now here
92:10 - i should be able to query from the
92:11 - database
92:16 - um where where where where where
92:19 - where how i query
92:23 - basic query means you're looking for
92:25 - documents whose fields match the ones
92:27 - you specify
92:28 - find planet solar i just want to find
92:31 - one with the i
92:32 - particular id
92:35 - so let's do this so
92:39 - so database find
92:43 - id is
92:47 - params oh response params
92:50 - poll id
92:58 - and it i can actually just do this right
93:06 - why why is my auto format doing that to
93:09 - me that seems insane
93:11 - all right fine can i make this um does
93:14 - this
93:14 - uh does any db support promises
93:16 - [Music]
93:18 - oh a dead simple promise
93:22 - wrapper has this been maintained two
93:24 - months ago i'll take that
93:29 - all right let's try this uh
93:35 - i like to use promises you'll see why in
93:36 - a second i like to use the async and
93:38 - await
93:39 - syntax now it's how i do everything find
93:42 - one is actually what i want to do
93:43 - maybe um so let's see npm
93:47 - install any db those are called promises
93:52 - i hope this works and now i should be
93:55 - able to switch
93:56 - to any db promises
94:02 - right um and then
94:06 - um now i should be able to say i should
94:10 - be able to make this function
94:11 - a sync function and say uh
94:16 - poll equals await database
94:19 - find
94:25 - ah no stop seriously
94:29 - what what setting do i have this is
94:31 - making me crazy
94:33 - does anybody know like how do i find
94:35 - quickly where that setting is it's like
94:37 - the line length setting maybe
94:39 - um and i need an equals here i'm gonna
94:41 - just have to i'll leave it for right now
94:44 - and then
94:47 - let's see if this works
94:51 - um so my server oh crashed
94:55 - database load database is not a function
94:57 - why not
95:03 - data store create
95:08 - oh do i do it this way
95:12 - there are no callbacks all right
95:16 - oh
95:16 - [Music]
95:24 - will this work whoops
95:28 - i oh i'm i'm so used to restarting the
95:30 - server myself
95:32 - line length okay let's see
95:38 - can i line length
95:44 - uh extensions text maxed
95:48 - i don't know i don't know how to find
95:52 - this setting
95:53 - if it's part of like something that i
95:55 - installed like beautify config
95:59 - is that what i'm using
96:03 - um
96:09 - and can i like add a user setting
96:14 - maybe somebody can tell me where this
96:16 - might be yes lint
96:20 - no must be beautify
96:28 - um can i how do i get the json oops yeah
96:30 - like something like this like editor
96:38 - line length now
96:42 - beautify
96:50 - beautify
96:54 - oh
96:59 - someone's going to tell me command shift
97:01 - p type settings.json prettier
97:03 - print with if you're using prettier
97:07 - am i using prettier
97:12 - i don't think so
97:15 - [Music]
97:19 - uh i can't recall uh
97:22 - print with
97:26 - no i know i could disable format on save
97:30 - i like it formatting it on save i just
97:32 - don't
97:33 - want a longer line length okay gotta go
97:35 - back to here
97:36 - somebody will tell me okay okay let's
97:38 - make sure this still works
97:40 - um let's go to here
97:45 - a 404 not found all right so i need to
97:48 - do the poll id
97:49 - which is insane that i have to like but
97:51 - i'm just going to do that
97:53 - let's just grab this put it
97:56 - uh vote slash this slash b
98:02 - okay uh cannot read property poll id
98:06 - of undefined um
98:13 - pull id
98:23 - let's just send back um
98:34 - uh response dot um
98:38 - params all right hopefully this is gonna
98:42 - work
98:54 - oh request
98:57 - oh did i have response up there why did
98:59 - i have that that's a mistake
99:02 - there we go
99:06 - why did i say so the request is the data
99:08 - coming in responses for things coming
99:10 - but going out
99:23 - let's see what happens here
99:28 - okay is the database still there yeah
99:36 - it's empty
99:40 - wait database find id
99:48 - oh do i have to say like underscore id
99:50 - that's weird
99:54 - all right let's just be there must
99:59 - find field equals true
100:07 - i guess i have to go back to the regular
100:11 - nedb docs to understand how this works
100:22 - um fine basic querying
100:28 - is finding by an id like
100:31 - is that not fine is that like a get or
100:33 - something
100:35 - in this it seems like i'm not supposed
100:38 - to do this because it's underscore
100:40 - but let's just do this
100:43 - um and here we go there we go okay well
100:47 - that works
100:49 - all right
100:55 - did anybody figure out my uh line length
100:59 - i don't know how you would figure it out
101:01 - i guess i would look under extensions
101:05 - like where where's exten is this
101:07 - extensions yeah
101:08 - i have beautify these are the things i
101:11 - have installed
101:12 - eslint and beautify settings
101:16 - uh extension settings
101:20 - config path to a file oh i can create a
101:23 - file
101:24 - js beautify rc beautify ignore
101:28 - um beautify line length
101:32 - vs code yes cool
101:36 - open extensions menu then click on
101:38 - extension change the line length
101:42 - extension settings change the line
101:44 - length yeah
101:46 - extension
101:53 - uh i don't understand
101:58 - um
102:04 - extension settings doesn't seem to be a
102:06 - lot
102:07 - of extensions
102:12 - huh
102:18 - tab size editor line length
102:22 - oh yeah
102:23 - [Music]
102:26 - but javascript format wrap
102:30 - line length is that what i would do
102:35 - but that's for that seems weird
102:38 - should i not use beautify where's
102:42 - cj when you need the coding garden
102:52 - is it what was it uh
102:57 - is i'm not looking here okay hold on
103:01 - oh pretty we'll always do this okay
103:05 - maximum line yeah
103:08 - dart
103:12 - this is crazy that this is what i'm
103:14 - stuck on it's 1140
103:16 - formatter in js section okay
103:20 - all right command shift p
103:24 - format document
103:28 - command shift p
103:32 - uh
103:33 - [Music]
103:37 - format talking with configure default
103:39 - formatter
103:45 - i'm lost totally lost
103:50 - all right this is what i was looking for
103:52 - line
103:54 - [Music]
103:59 - i guess i could put this in js beautify
104:02 - like i guess do i need to do it in my
104:03 - own file
104:09 - just install printer
104:15 - just install prettier i thought cj uses
104:17 - beautify though i just
104:18 - took my settings from cj in the settings
104:22 - in the js
104:23 - section okay
104:26 - um text editor
104:30 - where do i find javascript
104:34 - uh javascript extensions
104:38 - eslint typescript
104:48 - i don't understand js ah no
104:51 - [Music]
104:52 - this is making me crazy
104:55 - settings editor control
104:58 - w side project to fix line length come
105:01 - on i really
105:02 - i really want to fix this just install
105:07 - come on people
105:16 - oh i'm gonna get this i'm gonna get you
105:18 - line length i've done this like so many
105:20 - times
105:21 - maybe i should use prettier um all right
105:24 - hold on
105:24 - vs code
105:27 - [Music]
105:29 - javascript line length
105:33 - that's obvious
105:37 - command to re-wrap code to respect a
105:39 - preferred that's from 2000
105:42 - maximum line length in your code
105:45 - prettier
105:50 - line break when curly brace okay
105:54 - cj uses prettier scroll down
105:58 - i'm sorry all right all right fine
106:04 - goodbye i uninstalled it
106:10 - prettier this is what i want
106:14 - do i want prettier eslint i don't know
106:17 - let's try this okay installed it
106:25 - now i've installed prettier
106:39 - why is there a setting for every single
106:42 - like
106:44 - language but no
107:00 - all right it's totally prettier didn't i
107:06 - prettier is installed settings
107:10 - so i think the settings the setting that
107:13 - i'm looking for is not
107:15 - a setting of the code formatter it's a
107:18 - vs code
107:20 - setting
107:29 - it uses old control shift p
107:36 - really gone off the rails here these
107:38 - extensions conflicts with eslint search
107:40 - for prettier in settings
107:42 - all right i don't think i need to
107:43 - restart it but let's restart it
107:45 - um i'm really off the rails i was making
107:50 - progress until i decided that i couldn't
107:52 - take it anymore
107:57 - ah okay i got rid of beautify and put in
108:01 - prettier and it's fine now
108:03 - all right great amazing all right who
108:05 - knows what happened
108:06 - but i'll take it i'll take it we can
108:08 - move on now okay
108:11 - so now what i want to do is update
108:16 - how do i update um i found the poll
108:21 - then um so let's make sure i'm doing
108:24 - this correctly
108:26 - um and i'll get back
108:29 - where am i here
108:33 - okay i get the poll back and then i want
108:36 - to whatever the vote is
108:38 - i want to say poll so we're going to say
108:41 - const
108:42 - vote equals request params choice
108:46 - so i should maybe i'll call this choice
108:48 - poll choice
108:51 - plus plus and then
108:56 - can i how do i update it
108:59 - then what i want to do is use update
109:07 - insert find update remove persistence
109:11 - update
109:11 - right that's what i want to do insert
109:14 - db.update
109:16 - query update options callback
109:22 - oh it's the same kind of finding query
109:24 - used with find and find
109:25 - one but it specifies how the document
109:29 - should be
109:29 - um oh so i can just
109:33 - update it and increase the number at the
109:35 - same time
109:36 - let's see if i do that so i should be
109:38 - able to say update
109:43 - um and then set
109:48 - um see any db increment
109:51 - count i don't want to auto increment the
109:55 - field in
109:56 - any db
110:00 - find sort limit exact
110:04 - this seems crazy there's got to be a way
110:06 - to sort of like
110:09 - update this one
110:12 - with
110:15 - oh increment there we go so it must be
110:18 - like this increment
110:21 - queried by the modifier distance
110:27 - 38 so maybe i can do
110:30 - this weight id
110:34 - increment choice
110:38 - um
110:46 - wait no no
110:52 - how do i i want it to rap
110:57 - i'm just kidding go to the next line
111:01 - [Laughter]
111:03 - i have the opposite problem now um
111:07 - increment this
111:11 - like with this let me just do this for a
111:12 - second
111:18 - if i do this no matter what i vote for
111:19 - it's going to increment
111:22 - a by one right let's see if this works
111:28 - oh error invalid code use
111:36 - i guess i need like a try catch to get a
111:38 - better error message we've got 10
111:40 - minutes left in this live stream
111:42 - okay there's no special function for
111:44 - updating you don't need the separate
111:45 - plus plus it does it automatically
111:48 - um this is display
111:51 - like this will eventually require object
111:53 - dot keys poll for each
111:56 - uh pulling but people are um all right
111:59 - so
111:59 - increment a by one that's what i assume
112:03 - by looking at this documentation
112:06 - [Music]
112:15 - oh increment distance 38 maybe this
112:19 - doesn't mean
112:20 - increment
112:25 - i mean the thing is like i can easily
112:28 - just get it
112:28 - add one to it and then
112:33 - update the value maybe i should just do
112:35 - that i'm gonna do that right now
112:42 - uh
112:46 - um
112:49 - find one id
112:56 - right
112:58 - update id
113:03 - like is this
113:08 - would this work right and this is
113:11 - there's got to be a better way to do it
113:13 - but what i'm doing here is i'm saying
113:15 - give me the poll increment the count of
113:18 - the choice by
113:19 - one and then update the poll
113:23 - and then send it back let's see if this
113:26 - works
113:30 - um yeah
113:33 - so this works
113:37 - so i'm gonna i'm sure this could be
113:40 - fixed in one line
113:41 - what if i put something that's not there
113:43 - oh look at that
113:44 - it adds it so obviously i need some kind
113:47 - of protection there to not do that
113:50 - but that's fine um all right great
113:54 - okay so this is now voting
113:57 - route and then um
114:00 - i want to just do app.get
114:04 - votes and then
114:08 - this uh so this would also be the poll
114:11 - id
114:15 - and then you would get um
114:23 - where what am i doing here um await
114:25 - database find one
114:29 - response.send
114:32 - this is a lot of duplicate code but why
114:35 - not
114:37 - all right so then oops and this is
114:40 - putting this into a sync await function
114:48 - so i've got two routes now in the server
114:51 - one where i can vote
114:52 - and one for i can see the results so
114:55 - let's
114:55 - go back to the p5.js sketch and
114:59 - um i want to use uh fetch so let's do
115:04 - like a function called count votes
115:08 - [Music]
115:10 - and i'll say
115:12 - [Music]
115:15 - i'm going to get
115:19 - from the server
115:23 - uh
115:27 - [Music]
115:29 - yeah i know it's supposed to be a wait i
115:30 - was gonna add that in later
115:32 - stop fixing everything for me i'm
115:34 - writing the code
115:35 - not you uh and then
115:39 - oh okay and then um
115:47 - so now draw i'm going to
115:52 - uh do this do this
115:57 - okay so first we have
116:03 - and then we will count the votes
116:07 - and then in draw i'm going to get
116:11 - the choices are object.keys
116:15 - of the votes and then for every
116:20 - choice of choices
116:23 - and i think actually i'll use
116:29 - more traditional loop because i'm going
116:31 - to spread these out
116:35 - i am going to say uh rectangle
116:40 - well i got to fix this 10
116:43 - um i
116:48 - uh i'm just gonna pick some arbitrary
116:50 - choices right now
116:52 - uh start at 20 pixels down
116:56 - spaced out by 20 pixels
116:59 - and the width is gonna end with 10
117:01 - pixels high
117:02 - and the width will be
117:06 - the um votes
117:11 - choice dot just that count
117:14 - times two
117:17 - times ten and uh phil
117:24 - uh let's just make it zero uh no
117:27 - stroke and
117:31 - let's see if what this does
117:34 - so now if i go to here all right
117:39 - get localhost 3000 votes didn't work
117:42 - oh i need a i need a um
117:46 - an id so what's the id that i need
117:49 - uh oh my god what's going on here this
117:52 - is bad
117:55 - that's not what's supposed to happen i'm
117:58 - not updating it
117:59 - something is really wrong oh dude i did
118:01 - something terrible
118:06 - all right let's not worry about this
118:07 - right now oh i've done something bad
118:09 - i don't know how to use net database.db
118:12 - net
118:12 - any db apparently um but
118:16 - just for um just to get this to
118:20 - work for a second
118:24 - let's just see if this works assignment
118:28 - to constant variable at count
118:32 - votes
118:37 - choice is not defined let's sketch
118:40 - line 18. uh
118:46 - oh
118:51 - that's the thing in the array okay
118:56 - all right let's put um
119:00 - let's put uh
119:04 - fill uh text
119:08 - uh so let's do who let x equals 10
119:11 - let y equal this
119:15 - uh let's put the text at uh of that
119:19 - choice at x
119:21 - comma y plus 20 plus 10
119:26 - um and then this will start at
119:29 - x plus 20.
119:33 - whoops uh uh what's what's what happened
119:37 - here
119:38 - what did i do what did i mess up
119:43 - choice no that's right
119:47 - i just wanted to require is not defined
119:51 - i don't have require oh that it's auto
119:55 - adding some weird stuff
119:56 - for me that i don't want okay
120:00 - it's got the id there
120:02 - [Music]
120:06 - i got to work on this all right so in
120:08 - the chat has it brace style collapse
120:11 - preserve in line okay okay i'll get to
120:13 - that later
120:16 - um all right so this is the uh
120:19 - now i just want to have this be like
120:21 - live so i'm also going to do
120:24 - a set interval count
120:28 - votes and again maybe eventually i want
120:30 - to use web sockets
120:31 - but i'm just going to like every second
120:35 - maybe let's try like half a second let's
120:37 - count the votes
120:42 - so in theory if i were to take
120:46 - this
120:50 - and kind of put this page
120:54 - over here
120:55 - [Music]
120:59 - and i'm going to
121:02 - vote for b
121:06 - yeah look at that
121:11 - [Music]
121:12 - every time i vote in real time
121:15 - it's updating yes
121:20 - okay so that's kind of working uh it's
121:23 - about
121:24 - just about noon so i've made progress on
121:26 - this
121:28 - a very very slow crude progress
121:32 - i don't have an interface the database
121:34 - is not working let me see if i can at
121:36 - least
121:36 - fix the thing where i'm updating the
121:39 - database correctly does anybody have all
121:41 - right so let's start over here
121:44 - [Music]
121:47 - maybe i
121:59 - so did the server restart
122:03 - no
122:13 - okay so this is correct let's filter out
122:17 - id
122:18 - um that seems like i don't want to
122:23 - to to send that to display that
122:26 - so um
122:34 - isn't that like how does filter work oh
122:36 - i can't do anything
122:38 - anymore i'm like my brain is dead i have
122:40 - to end this live stream
122:44 - um
122:46 - filter
122:53 - uh to do better do something different
122:57 - than this
123:00 - uh all right so this should
123:05 - remove that every
123:08 - oh no i have to actually refresh the
123:10 - yeah there we go okay
123:12 - and i don't all right so all right so
123:14 - now i'm getting the live votes
123:18 - and it is coming from any db now if i
123:21 - were to
123:21 - vote
123:27 - it's counting it is it it's making
123:30 - separate entries
123:32 - so what am i doing wrong in instead of
123:34 - update
123:41 - all right so this is clearly wrong i'm
123:44 - finding it incrementing a value
123:47 - and then updating it
123:56 - filter value value does not equal id
123:58 - thank you
124:00 - all right so people are upset at my not
124:02 - actually using i'll actually do filter i
124:04 - just got kind of tired
124:07 - it's like this is easier uh
124:10 - i should probably filter it somewhere
124:12 - else but
124:14 - i can basically filter by
124:18 - another function so i take the element
124:21 - and i'm just looking as long as that
124:23 - element
124:24 - i filter out i say if it's not equal to
124:29 - id um
124:38 - this what i'm doing
124:42 - apparently that worked right i filter
124:45 - out any elements
124:47 - oh i keep all the elements where this is
124:49 - true so it's not equals yes
124:51 - okay um i could use a regular expression
124:55 - uses an append only format it should
124:57 - auto compact at some point
124:59 - really that's what super bunny
125:04 - the pen only behavior is built into any
125:06 - db it is working as expected
125:08 - they purposely don't do seeking
125:09 - overwriting oh
125:13 - chris manning is suggesting uh
125:16 - redis so is any db something i shouldn't
125:19 - use
125:21 - i'm happy to okay i've got the message
125:24 - now
125:26 - that it is using the append only format
125:29 - fine i don't know what um
125:34 - i i just want to use something simple at
125:36 - the beginning that like
125:37 - makes sense but what is redis um oops
125:40 - i never heard of that redis database
125:46 - npm
125:53 - this looks popular
126:01 - what is this a high performance node.js
126:05 - redis client i don't know what that
126:07 - redis okay what is redis
126:17 - what is redis
126:23 - open source in-memory data structure
126:25 - store uses a database cache
126:27 - and message broker it supports data
126:29 - structures such as strings hashes list
126:31 - sets
126:32 - this looks good um
126:35 - i like this this sounds like what i
126:39 - should use should i switch
126:44 - i've never used redis redis is for cache
126:47 - use firebase remote dictionary server a
126:50 - key value store
126:53 - uh it isn't file based try out low db
127:00 - i want something i guess actually this
127:02 - is silly because my real-time polling
127:04 - application i don't actually need to
127:07 - save it to a database
127:08 - i just thought like we could save polls
127:11 - and i maybe i should use a database
127:12 - and have a local one i'm now realizing
127:15 - that's kind of unnecessary i'm over
127:17 - engineering this
127:18 - is a small local json database powered
127:21 - by load upload
127:22 - i mean the way i want to do this is just
127:25 - write my own
127:26 - i was going to do this by just using
127:28 - writing my own json file
127:30 - i mean ultimately that's what i should
127:32 - do uh
127:34 - firebase suits this i don't want to use
127:36 - a database as a service for this
127:38 - um right now um that's probably silly i
127:42 - don't want to over engineer this i can
127:44 - always come back
127:45 - and do this later all right i'm gonna
127:47 - leave i'm gonna i'm gonna file this as
127:49 - an
127:50 - issue okay so i'm i'm looking for your
127:53 - feedback
127:54 - here um let's go to um
127:58 - because i have to wrap up
128:03 - [Music]
128:06 - um
128:11 - um database okay
128:15 - i don't actually need a database
128:18 - because i can just store
128:22 - the votes in memory for a real
128:26 - time poll but what if
128:29 - i want to restart the server
128:32 - and not lose the votes
128:37 - currently i'm using any db just as
128:40 - a simple beginner friendly database
128:43 - example
128:46 - please add your suggestions
128:49 - and thoughts to
128:52 - to this thread
128:57 - all right so people um you can go to the
129:00 - coding train live poll
129:02 - issues and comment there and i'll think
129:05 - about this
129:06 - for the next time since i have this
129:08 - working i just want to
129:11 - put this as an overlay
129:15 - so oh right i forgot that i was trying
129:18 - to do this on glitch
129:19 - all right so i'm gonna do this in a very
129:20 - crude way but it's gonna work
129:24 - um but how am i gonna get it so that
129:26 - people can actually
129:27 - vote even though you're all gonna like
129:30 - hack first of all let me
129:32 - do a mapping let me let me try to like
129:36 - keep things in check here so the first
129:39 - thing i want to do
129:40 - is normalize the values um
129:44 - so i'm sure i could do this with higher
129:46 - order array functions
129:48 - but i know the minimum is going to be
129:49 - zero uh max
129:51 - votes um so let me just do
129:55 - four let choice of choices
130:00 - let count equal
130:04 - votes choice
130:07 - um max votes
130:10 - equals whichever one is bigger which is
130:12 - math.max
130:14 - between count and max votes is that
130:16 - right
130:17 - and then console log max
130:21 - votes let's make sure this is working
130:24 - um not a number
130:35 - what
130:39 - why did that not work oh first of all
130:40 - i'm in p5 so i don't have to do math.max
130:47 - number for the first parameter
130:53 - what choice
130:57 - well how come that didn't work
131:01 - oh is it because i'm no i filtered out
131:08 - id
131:16 - oh
131:21 - those are the choices
131:28 - what
131:32 - what am i doing here no i filtered out
131:37 - id i thought
131:41 - do i have to set it
131:46 - oh i guess i have to well how come that
131:49 - worked
131:50 - down here weird i don't know what's
131:53 - going on
131:54 - oh because the width maybe this is so
131:56 - weird
132:00 - anyway it's working now
132:03 - okay so i have the maximum
132:07 - and then i want
132:10 - to um
132:17 - map the number of votes between
132:20 - zero and max votes to a width between
132:25 - zero and let's just say 100
132:33 - so whichever
132:38 - so if i go here
132:40 - [Music]
132:43 - so as i continue to vote
132:46 - the number b is going up but it's just
132:47 - sort of normalizing them
132:49 - okay so that's what i wanted to do also
132:52 - to keep them normalized just as a
132:53 - percentage
132:55 - in case the votes go crazy um
132:58 - [Music]
133:00 - now
133:04 - one is not a is one log the count you
133:06 - need to do choices yes so that's
133:08 - um okay
133:12 - okay so excellent
133:17 - i'm gonna do something a little weird
133:19 - here you'll see in a second
133:21 - [Music]
133:23 - um
133:27 - just gonna make the background green
133:29 - because i'm gonna i'm gonna
133:31 - the way i'm gonna capture this is not
133:32 - the way that i intend to eventually
133:36 - but wait why there we go um and
133:39 - so actually instead of doing that
133:48 - i got to get rid of the autofill that
133:49 - it's doing that has nothing to do with
133:51 - let's add
133:52 - um how do i do this body
133:57 - background
134:00 - is that is that how css works
134:04 - there we go okay so
134:09 - what i'm going to do now could i
134:13 - if i'm this is localhost
134:16 - could i open and my pc is on the same
134:21 - local network can i open this webpage on
134:27 - the pc
134:29 - um serving this here
134:32 - i was gonna do this it's gonna show you
134:38 - um
134:41 - uh all right i'm just looking at the
134:42 - chat this is i'm i'm wrapping this up i
134:44 - want to
134:45 - get allow people to vote so i maybe i
134:48 - should deploy this to glitch
134:51 - let's you all break it but why not
134:54 - um so let's go to coding train live poll
135:00 - uh edit project
135:04 - i don't have a way to i need to figure
135:07 - out a way to sync my local development
135:09 - with
135:09 - glitch
135:13 - um yeah i just need the ip
135:20 - okay
135:22 - i'm wrapping up people by the way i'm
135:24 - i'm running 15 minutes behind
135:27 - [Music]
135:34 - um
135:36 - okay all right i definitely have to be
135:37 - done by 12 45.
135:39 - i mean i need to be done well before
135:41 - then i can use ngrok i'm afraid to use
135:44 - ngrok i do want to learn and if i use
135:47 - ngrok
135:47 - am i opening myself up to any like
135:50 - extreme risk
135:51 - i don't like glitch is not working
135:55 - all right i want to learn ngrok
135:59 - secure public urls for testing your
136:02 - chatbot
136:03 - all right what could go wrong
136:07 - what could possibly go wrong
136:10 - sign up i don't have it
136:13 - do i dare sign up with github or google
136:17 - um people in
136:21 - uh uh uh coding trained members trust
136:23 - trusted members tell me
136:25 - if i shouldn't use ngrok but i think i'm
136:27 - going to
136:28 - um brought the out saying don't use
136:31 - ngrok
136:32 - okay no
136:36 - what i want to do is i want people to be
136:38 - able i want to give a url the chat where
136:40 - people can vote
136:42 - uh without destroying i mean i could
136:45 - deploy this to like digital ocean or
136:47 - something
136:48 - i could also just demonstrate it and i'm
136:49 - the only person who can vote
136:52 - if only i had a live polling application
136:54 - that i could use
136:58 - uh you can just download it no need to
137:00 - sign up
137:01 - i'm i'm trusting prothmesh right now
137:03 - which is telling me not to use ngrok
137:06 - um
137:08 - [Music]
137:10 - oh local all right i'm gonna i'm gonna
137:12 - um
137:13 - so download
137:22 - this is so bad
137:31 - no a profit match i need to serve my
137:33 - node application
137:35 - so it's not about hosting the client all
137:37 - right i'm gonna
137:38 - go i'm gonna go for it if you all hack
137:40 - my
137:41 - house i'll be sad
137:46 - now how do i use it
137:50 - oh i have to i have to sign up fire it
137:53 - up i should learn how to use this
137:55 - what could go wrong ngrok is fine for
137:57 - testing okay
138:03 - all right i'm gonna sign up for this um
138:05 - but just not show my screen while i'm
138:07 - signing up for it
138:09 - um let's use i'll use my
138:12 - coding train google account or i
138:14 - probably should use github
138:16 - i hate like connecting these things but
138:18 - i'm just
138:19 - let's just use github um
138:27 - authorize ngrok private sure
138:31 - okay so i'm i'm there
138:39 - off okay so this is great my auth token
138:43 - is here
138:43 - so i'm not showing that i for once i'm
138:45 - not showing you my auth stroke token
138:48 - unzip path to ngrok
138:51 - i probably want it so i'm just i'm going
138:54 - to
138:56 - um just just give me a second i
138:57 - apologize for not showing you what i'm
138:59 - doing but it
139:00 - there's an auth token so i'll explain
139:02 - what i'm doing in a second
139:04 - oops and let's go
139:07 - desktop and grock into live
139:11 - poll
139:14 - i'm just going to put it on i'm just
139:15 - going to put it on the desktop right now
139:21 - i know sorry you can't see what i'm
139:22 - doing
139:27 - [Music]
139:28 - okay great i've got ungrock
139:33 - let's see if i can do my auth token
139:36 - [Music]
139:37 - auth token saved
139:41 - okay okay
139:45 - so now all right so let me just um
139:50 - i want to show you what i did without
139:52 - showing my auth
139:53 - token so let's see if i can just do
139:56 - something really quickly
139:57 - this is very hacky
140:02 - but i'm going to show you the steps that
140:04 - i did right now
140:06 - so basically i downloaded oh sorry i
140:09 - downloaded
140:10 - ngrok which is um
140:17 - as soon as i zoomed the little thing i
140:19 - put covering up my auth token
140:22 - all right i gotta there's gotta be a
140:23 - quick way i can reset that off token
140:25 - right authentication uh toke
140:29 - uh your auth token uh regen reset auth
140:33 - token
140:34 - okay yep all right
140:37 - so i've reset the auth token so the one
140:40 - that you just saw
140:41 - doesn't work anymore just so you know
140:45 - um i don't you need to start on the
140:47 - command line so
140:48 - um
140:51 - um and then i'm going to you don't see
140:54 - i'm gonna
140:55 - i'm gonna do it again
141:00 - i won't zoom into my
141:04 - um i won't zoom in this time
141:11 - no zooming so these are the steps i have
141:14 - this ngrok file i
141:15 - i um i then run this ngrok
141:18 - auth token to authenticate and then now
141:21 - i can i should be able to run the other
141:22 - ngrok commands which i'm going to do
141:27 - i'll do a tutorial about this at some
141:28 - point and then i can always just blur it
141:30 - out
141:30 - um if this works well um
141:34 - so let me go and sorry
141:38 - ngrok
141:44 - right all right so now i should be able
141:48 - to
141:50 - oh hold on
141:54 - okay i should be able to now use this
141:58 - command
141:58 - ngrok http 80
142:01 - and it's going to like run a server with
142:04 - some and this is going to
142:06 - send you into my computer oh my god this
142:09 - is very dangerous
142:14 - oh but this doesn't how's that going to
142:16 - run my node server i need to use
142:18 - ngrok from within like i'm not serving
142:20 - those files
142:23 - i want to expose
142:26 - can i integrate it into my node code
142:28 - this doesn't make any sense
142:32 - all right this is not going to work
142:33 - without i don't know how to do this
142:35 - right now
142:36 - right like for example there's nothing
142:39 - in this
142:41 - directory that's private but i'm just
142:43 - gonna go into public
142:46 - and if i type in uh uh
142:52 - ngrok http 80.
142:57 - oh whoops
143:00 - i guess i got to put it in my path
143:04 - will this do it
143:07 - so i'm running this server
143:11 - and if you go to this url right now
143:22 - oh make sure a web service is running on
143:24 - localhost 80. oh
143:26 - so it will actually work okay great but
143:28 - i want to do it on port 3000
143:30 - okay got it
143:40 - so i'm doing it on port 3000
143:45 - so if i go to this
143:49 - [Music]
143:54 - amazing you should all be able to see
143:56 - this if you go to this url
144:00 - oh that's wild okay so now oh i don't
144:03 - need the background color then because i
144:05 - actually have this
144:07 - uh working so i should take i'll i'll
144:09 - leave the background color why not
144:10 - so i'm while you're all hacking my whole
144:14 - system here i'm gonna go
144:17 - over to um
144:21 - my camera only layout
144:24 - and i am going to
144:28 - go open up a browser and
144:31 - i'm gonna say ngrok so i'm doing this in
144:35 - open broadcast studio
144:36 - i can actually show this to you sort of
144:40 - because i can go to here
144:44 - but you can't really see what i'm doing
144:45 - now so i'll just come back
144:47 - to here ngrok
144:56 - uh okay so i can use an n i can start
144:58 - ngrok from node itself
145:00 - so create new ngrok then um i need the
145:04 - to be what's the url 41
145:09 - b 8 e e
145:15 - 0 d 4
145:18 - d 8 dot n grock
145:21 - dot i o
145:28 - okay here we go
145:31 - um
145:35 - should have filtered better okay people
145:40 - i gotta fix my
145:45 - bad words could show up here thank you
145:47 - for
145:48 - uh telling me that filter
145:53 - elt um so i want to just use a regular
145:55 - expression that i'm only
145:57 - filtering for votes that are well i
145:58 - could filter
146:01 - in the server itself but i'm just going
146:03 - to filter here is
146:08 - a abcd
146:11 - test
146:17 - i think this is how
146:21 - um
146:24 - i think oh you don't see what i'm coding
146:26 - right now nope
146:29 - um
146:32 - i'll show you what i'm doing um
146:37 - what i'm trying to do is i'm saying
146:39 - filter by
146:41 - uh test a regular expression
146:46 - that it matches a b c or d
146:50 - um like
146:54 - start and end
146:57 - so it's only for
147:01 - and now because we can't have nice
147:04 - things
147:06 - let's see if that filter worked nope
147:09 - what's wrong with this regular
147:14 - expression
147:16 - i forget how regular expressions work
147:20 - um
147:28 - oops
147:31 - oh that's not a function
147:40 - okay that's how it works
147:56 - okay this is it
148:08 - i'm gonna make sure
148:16 - that it only is a valid one
148:20 - there we go filtered better people
148:23 - okay uh okay
148:26 - now back to here and let's see if i can
148:30 - refresh this
148:32 - ngrok how do i refresh
148:41 - so i refresh properties
148:44 - refresh there's got to be a way i
148:48 - i feel like i remember seeing in obs
148:50 - refresh there we go
148:55 - there we go okay so there's the poll
148:59 - and
149:07 - you can vote for your favorite option a
149:10 - b
149:10 - c or d vote people there's no interface
149:13 - for you to vote
149:14 - vote but this is it except it's over
149:16 - here
149:17 - this is my live polling application
149:20 - running
149:20 - on this laptop here for ngrok
149:24 - um i'm gonna vote i'm gonna do some
149:25 - voting to make sure it's updating
149:28 - unfortunately i have to vote manually
149:31 - oh my god there's by the way these are
149:34 - the messages that people um
149:36 - i can actually show these because nobody
149:38 - put anything bad
149:39 - um if i go back to here
149:43 - i might these are these are
149:46 - should have filtered better hello
149:48 - kittens foo potato hello people greeting
149:51 - from germany ddd so they're still in
149:52 - there i'm not actually filtering it and
149:54 - saving in the database
149:55 - but a is winning with 116 votes
149:58 - um we'll go back to here and i'm going
150:02 - to try let's try voting up
150:04 - d can everybody try voting up d for me
150:07 - and
150:11 - so i'm voting up d
150:15 - so this is great this is my live poll if
150:18 - now if i actually
150:19 - created an interface for it
150:23 - if i actually created an interface for
150:25 - it and
150:27 - let people have the url and all of that
150:29 - you could vote
150:30 - live on the coding trade but that will
150:32 - be
150:38 - next week on the coding trade because i
150:40 - have
150:41 - finished i gotta put it on the other
150:43 - side of me
150:45 - because i am not capable of um
150:49 - gesturing to my to my right so here it
150:53 - is the live pull
150:54 - you can see it's actually an overlay um
150:57 - and
150:58 - um so let let's go ahead and
151:01 - uh commit all this
151:07 - do i have chroma key set up on it
151:09 - already it's weird that that just worked
151:11 - um maybe i'll kill the ngrok now
151:16 - um let's see can we get a
151:20 - moving people let's get a moving let's
151:22 - just see if we can
151:23 - do this as a community let's see if we
151:25 - can get a to grow
151:28 - while i'm while i'm kind of finishing
151:30 - things up here
151:32 - closing a lot of stuff
151:40 - um
151:47 - i think it might have broken i'm getting
151:48 - a bunch of error messages
151:50 - but um
151:54 - this is pretty interesting to see i can
151:56 - see in real time through ngrok
151:59 - um what all the connections that are
152:03 - currently open and what people are doing
152:05 - if the stream goes down it's because
152:08 - it's the same internet connection yeah
152:10 - sorry for people are asking how to vote
152:12 - there's no interface for doing it or
152:14 - anything right now
152:15 - so um but let me
152:18 - um let me go ahead
152:22 - and um commit this code
152:27 - um i'm not let me add to
152:30 - uh get let me add the database to git
152:32 - ignore
152:35 - um because i don't know what's in there
152:42 - so um
152:51 - why is it still showing up
152:54 - did i misspell git ignore
152:59 - oh it's in public that's why
153:05 - um let's move that to the trash and just
153:07 - i want to create a
153:08 - get ignore file
153:11 - no not in public will can i move it yes
153:14 - move
153:16 - already exists oh oh i'm silly
153:20 - i already have one because for node
153:23 - modules right of course
153:29 - let's add that great
153:32 - perfect
153:35 - uh live polling
153:39 - work from stream
153:43 - and um this is what's known as a clicker
153:45 - by the way
153:47 - i don't know if anyone knows that
153:48 - reference um get push
153:50 - origin meme i'm still running it by the
153:53 - way
153:54 - we can check on it here a is winning now
153:56 - thank you everybody
153:58 - that's so cool this is really fun i'll
154:00 - be able to use this
154:01 - soon enough once i work on more of an
154:03 - interface and some other stuff for it
154:05 - and then i should actually also like i'm
154:08 - accepting community contributions to
154:09 - this and i'll just merge
154:10 - but i the reason why i didn't merge them
154:12 - when they came in is i meant to merge
154:14 - them or look through them on a live
154:15 - stream so that'll be next saturday it's
154:17 - 12 30 i really gotta go
154:19 - uh so did i push my code all right i'm
154:21 - gonna kill
154:23 - ngrok um should filter out with is not a
154:26 - number yeah
154:28 - um let me i'm gonna kill
154:31 - ngrok look at this we can see all the
154:32 - requests that are coming in
154:35 - wow is somebody trying to like ddos me
154:40 - because there's a lot coming in very
154:42 - very quickly
154:43 - um let's kill ngrok
154:48 - how do i kill it i'm pressing ctrl c is
154:51 - it dead
154:52 - if i close this tab yeah i think it's
154:55 - gone
154:56 - i don't know what all those errors are
154:58 - all right the server's down
155:00 - nobody should be able to connect anymore
155:03 - if i go back to
155:04 - here it's there but i assume
155:07 - it's just gonna be frozen with that
155:09 - right now
155:10 - all right everybody thank you for tuning
155:13 - in what is coming up
155:16 - so most recent first of all let me say a
155:20 - thank you again
155:26 - um it's just a lot of people using it
155:28 - okay uh thank you again
155:30 - to um lg the sponsor of today's
155:34 - coding train episode this monitor has
155:36 - really changed the way i'm able to
155:37 - work and live stream and keep track of
155:39 - everything going on
155:40 - um i encourage you to check out the
155:42 - links to this particular lg monitor and
155:43 - pick up one for yourself
155:45 - that's another way you could support the
155:47 - coding train um in the links in the
155:49 - video's description
155:50 - um other stuff that is happening in the
155:53 - world
155:54 - of coding train is um
155:57 - let me go to youtube uh the youtube
156:00 - channel could hold the coding train
156:02 - i recently released this video tutorial
156:06 - about
156:06 - github pages and there are two more that
156:09 - are coming out
156:11 - and i'll show you one of them uh
156:14 - not the tutorial but i'll just show you
156:15 - the code example the
156:17 - probably the next one to be released is
156:20 - looking
156:21 - at on the up the ml5 object detection
156:24 - model
156:25 - so i'll just run this um and what it
156:28 - does
156:29 - is if it would work
156:34 - huh oh no it's about to come alive it's
156:37 - just being slow
156:38 - um it it's using a pre-trained model to
156:41 - do object detection
156:42 - um if i hold up my phone it's gonna
156:46 - uh get that as a remote or a cell phone
156:49 - um and
156:52 - let's see does it recognize this bell
156:55 - no train whistle
157:00 - banana so i made a whole video about
157:02 - this particular model
157:04 - i actually should show you um
157:08 - in most of the video i actually just use
157:10 - a static image
157:11 - or really being slow today ml5 object
157:14 - detection here
157:17 - let's take a look at that oh what this
157:20 - is that i'm seeing over here
157:23 - um
157:30 - uh come on oh why is this not working
157:33 - there we go
157:38 - so you can see here the object got couch
157:40 - dog and cat that's gloria pickle and
157:43 - greta goose so anyway there's a video
157:44 - tutorial coming out about this model
157:46 - stay tuned for that
157:47 - um as well i've done something really
157:49 - fun that i hope when i can get this
157:51 - released people will
157:52 - use i created a um i wonder if i can
157:56 - actually even just pull this up
158:01 - so i created a sketch
158:06 - called zoom annotations
158:16 - and what this does is depending on
158:20 - it's it's it's trained for me in
158:23 - a different context but basically it
158:25 - creates this keyed set of
158:27 - pop-up animations that i'm able to
158:29 - overlay over
158:30 - um a zoom meeting and i in the video i i
158:34 - go through how that works so that you
158:36 - could raise your hand
158:37 - or give a thumbs up or a thumbs down and
158:40 - have these different annotations appear
158:42 - over your video image so stay tuned for
158:44 - that those are the things that are
158:45 - coming next
158:46 - um and i hope i really hope that people
158:48 - like play with this and make their own
158:50 - versions of it
158:51 - um it's gonna be a while like this this
158:53 - one is taking me some time to figure out
158:54 - how to like get the example together and
158:56 - the video
158:57 - added together to release but those are
158:59 - coming out soon
159:00 - so once again my process every friday
159:04 - i'm doing recording video tutorials the
159:06 - first one of which
159:07 - just came out here you can tune into
159:09 - those recording sessions by signing up
159:10 - to be a member

160:38 - somebody else
160:40 - um make a pull request to the coding
160:41 - train um but
160:43 - maybe not a spam one that would be a
160:44 - nice thing
160:46 - and i will see you next weekend next
160:48 - saturday 10 a.m every saturday except

Cleaned transcript:

so uh good morning everyone we will get started in a few minutes i am this is my test of my mic uh let me know how i'm sounding um a little pouring of the coffee sound happening right now getting myself set up got some exciting stuff to show and going to mute let me know in the chat this is do and then as soon my code so welcome to welcome to the passengers of the coding train we'll be getting started in just one moment but thank you for your support and membership me do hello happy side project saturday on the coding train it's me and yo together i've seen green which means my mic is on i see a picture of me i see chat happening i think i might have started a live stream with no technical problems uh it's not gonna last it's definitely not gonna last uh i have so many things that i'm working on and thinking about and trying to do and yet no plan at all for today other than to hang out with all of you and chat for a bit um let's start with our ceremonial reading of the random numbers to get warmed up uh we have a new member um i would love to know the proper pronunciation of moyne khan's name um khan thank you very much for your just showing a little leg look at that i am wearing pants they're called shorts here uh in these united states where i live um in the land of brooklyn new york i don't know what i'm talking about moyne 16473 and let's get us started here twenty two thousand four hundred and eighty one forty thousand two hundred and forty sixty two thousand two hundred and twenty three fifteen thousand two hundred and ninety three thousand three hundred and forty two thirty eight thousand six hundred and eighty one twenty eight thousand eight hundred eighty two ninety six thousand lost my place 180 80 315 76 806. thank you this has been random numbers with the coding train i'll see you again next saturday wouldn't that be great that's what i should just do just like a two minute live stream i don't even know if it was two minutes there's a very loud noise over there and you might think it was like a rabbit or a raccoon or some sort of strange creature who's made its way into the attic with me but no it's my cat i have two cats i don't know which one it is because i can't see it there's a huge mess in this attic where i set up this streaming equipment i pushed everything to the side book is going back the music is muting and uh where i want to start with is by thanking today's sponsor which i don't necessarily do right at the beginning but i've got to do today because today's sponsor is letting me or allowing me or facilitating me or giving me the opportunity to show you a little behind the scenes of the coding train today's coding train is sponsored by lg yes lg life's good uh i have a button a new button it says lg on my stream deck i'm gonna press it i'm a little bit afraid i don't have the setup where like it shows me what i'm gonna show you first let's just go right into it there it is this is my new lg ultra wide 34 inch monitor you can find links to this monitor in the video's description and this has totally been a game changer for me um what i'm showing you here is my sort of con like i'm over here by the way hello um i'm showing you my console for where what i look at when i'm always like looking in this direction while live streaming this is a new setup at home and over here you can see this is open broadcast studio where you've got the uh repeating recursive video inside video inside video uh forever pattern um where i can kind of monitor my mic level down here if i were to play some music oh what it's not working i don't know why the oh oh i don't have the laptop audio added oh look i'm going to show you i'm going to add it right now this is what i do audio source audio audio input capture add existing laptop sound this was a new uh there we go and so now i can see the laptop audio uh i've got my um by the way my stream deck over here where i can just mute that laptop audio really quickly but i want to just turn it off um and then over here i am monitoring the youtube chat so for example uh i see that uh marcos says whoa look at that real estate yeah 34 inches of water it's like it's like mind blowing i need two of these actually i it's like so much that i just want another one maybe lg will send me another one ah it's okay one thank you mwah thank you for this one monitor um and uh uh saying yay coding garden is alive which i'm not sure if that means coding guardians live is that coding garden live also at the same time oh my god what is the cat doing i gotta go get that cat in a second do you hear it you can hear that rustling right what is the cat gotten into oh my god um uh i think someone confused me for the coding garden or maybe cj is live at the same time all right so i'm reading the chat um have you connected your laptop to your monitor yes so i also use this for coding um and maybe i'll show you that midway through the live stream i have a um i put up my like browser window uh with the javascript console hold on hold on something's happening is the cat stuck no he's in a box it's okay it's entertaining for the for the viewers they can hear you you know um i forgot what i was talking about uh and no i'm not talking to you i'm talking to the millions of people of the internet i know i'm sorry um what is going on here uh one of my cats chewed through a mouse wire once called said both xp that's not good um but wait i was showing all the pieces of my console here so i have the chat oh right you're asking about coding with it so when i use it for coding which i will show you i put up like the javascript console my terminal window all the different pieces of things that i need to look at while i am working on stuff and then i actually then my laptop which is here which you can't easily see but i'll pull it up i usually actually keep my code on the laptop and this is just my secondary display for all the debugging i have like i'll put like the p5 reference over here but anyway this side should just show you so much room for roblox says unoriginal and yes this is actually the main problem uh with having this monitor this is the sole reason why my children decide they insist on using this workstation because they want to play roblox only on this monitor uh and so that kind of drives me a little bit crazy and then they start unplugging and moving these around i have to reset everything up again it's kind of a nightmare but they did make this beautiful lego and i can also um not yet a sponsor show you my technivore mocha master which i will now pour into my cup um and um what was i saying oh and then i wanted to show you the discord chat so this is what's going on if you would like to become a coding trained member that's one way you can support the coding train uh well anybody can join the discord but i'm looking at a um live chat of discord over here and also i can see my little graph here on youtube studio of the concurrent number of viewers it says here that 574 people are watching with a chat rate of 34 blah blah blah see this graph is going up come on people let's have that graph go up so um just to mention a few other things about the monitor uh it is 34 inches 21 by nine do that math uh ip uh wq hd ips display it's a 99 color gamut i don't even know how to pronounce that word but i think that just means basically you can see every color an hdr10 uh multitasking dual controller onscreen control amd freesync technology a threesided you can see this virtual borderless design there's basically no bezel or border here at all um and it has this uh wonderful uh a giant a height adjustable stand that you can tilt and uh move up and down which i'm afraid to do right now for like breaking my whole setup all right so thank you lg um you can find links to more about this monitor in the video's description and maybe i'll try to do some coding on it a little bit later back to me uh so how are you all doing the cat was taken away it's very sad um and i'm like now uh let's see uh teach us coding now please says gabriel wood what kind of coffee are you drinking if you could believe this i forgot the name of the brand but something organic and it says on the uh it says low acid because you know i'm i'm a very sensitive soul i have a weak constitution and uh i really have to wash my caffeine intake and my you know acidic intake i don't know if it makes a difference but all right stretch stretch stretch let's start with sharing some uh oh wait oh no that's the wrong music projects from you the community of the coding train thank you for being you you are for making your own creative coding projects and or sharing them with me on the codingtrain.com website which i will now maybe show to you ah here is my laptop i am in the corner with my green screen um i do have kind of an issue that i wanted to ask about let me just pause this for a second so because we've got this like nice little extra camera for today if i go back where i was showing you the monitor um i can also sort of move to the side here and you can see that's my green screen and i have these um by the way these are the lights that will blink these are phillips hue lights and they'll blink i have it set up to blink if someone joins as a member um and i thought i was like oh this brilliant idea i have which is to like put the lights around the green screen to fill it in so that there's no shadows but um one thing that i'm noticing and you can't really see it um but um with the sony alpha camera i have when i look at it without the chroma key maybe i'll show you that real fast so if i go here and i go to um i'm in camera only and i go to this thing and i go to properties and no no filters and i turn off the chroma key do you see that waviness over here that's like the frequency of the light the leds that don't match up with maybe the frequency of the camera oh my goodness topher has joined we're gonna have to say hello oh and there's the blinking so at least it's nice that you can see that right now um and we uh if i could press the button fast enough you might actually see it there you go um but um i would like to figure out how to clean that up a little bit or maybe i just shouldn't use these leds and something else for the sort of backfill of the green screen but i was curious if anybody has some advice on that let me put the filter back on uh close and back to the laptop oh no back to me where we will say welcome to topher jay who has been a supporter of the coding train for many many years we're always in there got a moderation thing we've communicated on many an occasion and now just today topher wanted to see that blinking and guess what topher for your membership with the coding train i blink my lights for you i gotta give you a random number too is somebody keeping track of these random numbers maybe people keep track of their own random numbers what if somebody has the same random number we should get shirts i'm a proud coding trade member my number is 21 121 there you go uh but i forgot what we were doing we were doing community project sharing time which is a thing that i like to do on saturdays to share the work of those of you who watch coding training video tutorials and contribute your contributions for example maybe you recently watched the marching squares uh cabana video and made something like oh i know unoriginal pun is watching like marching rays and if i click over here wait wait wait wait wait wait stop everybody hold hold this is wild okay let me see if i understand this the marching squares uh algorithm is one that looks for contours around um oh no you people you have to stop joining crosson mesh kawakkar thank you for joining the coding train with your membership you won the award of interrupting me while i was doing something very important by showing unoriginal puns wonderful community contribution but i thank you for your support and your membership i will blow my train whistle and maybe even someday you'll receive some stickers in the mail i would love to send you a baseball i got my smarter everyday baseball the other day and i forgot to bring it home i'm so sad because i have a place on the shelf it went to my work address and et cetera et cetera et cetera anyway i already lost this chat is too active and i've now lost it just says member this youtube interface oh there we go prasa mesh uh your random number is let's make this more dramatic your random number is this is a very long sound effect it's got seven more seconds what happens at the end i have no idea 88 771 this i better turn back over here to fulfill my destiny to become an ad man it's very sad that's kind of nice actually and and i'm very grateful for my uh well i don't know what the next part of that sentence is uh back to here okay no here so this if i understand it correctly is um the marching squares algorithm which you can see i don't know if this is using noise or just randomness created these contours and then the ray marching algorithm which uh emanates uh rays from this uh shining smiley face and hits the contours and stops it don't seem to be running rather slow i'm curious if that is true for everybody or if it is um just for me sometimes i feel like stuff runs super slow on my laptop when i'm streaming because i've got things all connected doing like a million different things oh and i forgot i'm not in the picture um today's mug by the way i have like a collection of mugs this is really embarrassing usually i show you my math mug let's see if this one will auto focus on it i clear castle which i actually got visiting high cure class just just just to say like it's not like i got this in the mail i was there and i picked up a mug years ago back when there was a world to move around in and now we just exist in floating in space with green screens talking to each other over the internet which i'm very again once grateful for this connection to the outside world that i have um from my attic um in brooklyn uh how's the audio by the way because i have the mic on original punch saying don't look at the code the mic is um pretty far from me today but i could move up closer to it and speak to you in a different kind of way i hope you all shut this off now by the way i think streaming really on saturday has definitely increased my numbers this is way more people than are usually watching um i will show you it here on my behind the scenes view 673 right now okay uh too many buttons all right now um you'd think that i would just bookmark the wheel that david snyder made but i can't manage to do that so let's go to codingtrainwebs let's also address something let us talk about hacktoberfest for a moment i don't know what to say about this um hacktoberfest i i believe it's put on by digitalocean yes presented by digitalocean is a monthlong um event digital event i guess it's a monthlong program where if you support some open source projects by contributing you will pick a limited edition tshirt or plan to treat well that's nice that they offer that option for sort of like making less stuff in the world than planting a tree instead um and i i think this is coming from a very good place it's i've enjoyed this program before i don't mean to be critical of it i am experiencing some difficulty and i would like to just speak to the community about this because it's creating a lot of work for um essentially what our volunt some volunteers who help maintain these repos um i do have um people who work for the coding train and as well and that's a tricky balance that i'm always trying to strike um but uh if i go to pull requests here and i'm gonna go to i believe this is the repo where we're seeing the most of this traffic let me move this over um let's go to closed um and we're going to see improved a bit improved docs minor edits improve docs improve dock modify docs update readme correction of typing say improve docs improve docs improve doc improve doct improve docs improve watch down docs improve docs there's a lot of work to and it's a lot of email notifications i get a notification for every single pull request i don't necessarily look at everyone or i don't get to it before somebody else does um and this is kind of a problem so um i don't know how um this can be addressed on a from the sort of open source community at large on a larger scale but at least in our small local community here i want to thank um violet graham many people who have been helping with this um and you can sort of see uh for example if i clicked on this one improved a bit we'll see that gypsy dangerous added invalid and closed this issue this is like work it's a significant amount of work to do um but i want to go over to the issues where thank you to violet craze they um created this issue to sort of help people think about a positive and productive way to contribute um and it's violet is also in the chat telling me and marcus is asking why are those invalid so let's go we'll look at one and see hopefully hopefully we marked it correctly we might be making mistakes because of the amount of noise and traffic um and okay which i like i have to say by moving my head up and down i gotta practice that more i was asking if i record i don't record the saturday live streams to disc maybe i should i don't have as powerful a computer i could always it's it's it's being archived through youtube which who knows if that will last for posterity and maybe i should keep my own track of that but um yeah let me i have to think about that but sorry all right wait wait wait bunch of things so uh profit match is saying you can add tags to the progress yeah so that the invalid tag is something we added let me go back to this um and by the way i'm gonna be here until about noon and once again i just i should be clear like i've really segmented out my tutorial making process which i have uh two new tutorials that i've recorded that are coming out soon and my live streaming process which is just like hanging out and kind of goofing off so there might not be a lot of anything happening today so all of you you maybe i can get this number down below 500 it seems like there shouldn't be this many people in the world who actually want to watch what this is right now so i encourage you to you know move along or put this on in the background and um you know i don't i don't have a plan i'm just kind of winging it here okay um let's look at one of these pull requests um that's marked as invalid um wait am i in the right place oh i need to go to the closed ones um we'll just go to this um first usually the one you can really tell by just called improved a bit um and if i click on this one um you can see that there hasn't nothing was there's nothing here in the pull request comment other than the template so this is our template um if i go here to files changed um i can go here and you can see there's just one little change tell me about how much you love blueberries what is this from it's one of my program with text tutorials it just changed it to how much do you love blueberries so there's nothing malicious really i think about this um and i probably should have been more thoughtful about like i don't mean to be calling out a single person and no i'm not showing their i their name was their username was shown and um i think they're probably their intentions are good in many ways and um but this kind of noise makes it hard to manage the community um so that's why it's marked as invalid because it's clearly to me it seems that it is a pull request with the intention of making a trivial change to be able to accumulate for pull requests for the hacktoberfest um thing so um but what i wanted to i wanted to be positive about this so uh i think you you you should participate um and contribute to open source and this um issue that um violet craze um they added is a a wonderful guide to how you can make a productive and positive pull request to the coding train and to be clear you will never be criticized well hopefully it's up to us to um live up to these ideals so you know please let us know if we're doing it but it is the coding trains desire me my desire and people who help participate and manage the community to never um yell at somebody or put them down or criticize their code this is an open inclusive welcoming space for you to try contributing open source you can get it wrong and we'll help you try to get it right and there is no right or wrong but um here are some things that you could do so for example i'm going to show you some community contributions if you made your own project based on one of the videos you can submit it to the coding train website through a pull request that's what this is under number one um this ten print for example i don't know if it's still true is the one is one of the videos that has had historically the most community contributions you can um all right hold on a second i gotta mute my maybe you can't hear bear with me for one second so all right i'm back uh sorry about that quick digression uh back here we are um so you can make something um and uh add your creation oh this is these are the steps to follow so these are the steps to follow um in terms of a nice way that you can contribute your own work um there okay sorry sorry about that um all right now um oh okay uh so where did i want to show community contributions but thank you to k weekman who um uh lifted a good question from the chat from uh mushi next and turtle joe players are you sure those are real people's names are you just making is this your question okay weak mom you just wanted to no okay um and violet is saying these are steps for making a community contribution have meaning to make some other issues with other suggestions but the those aren't there yet but this is these are helpful steps and i actually also have um uh i think if i search for community contribution uh coding train um i i'm pretty sure that yeah this particular video how to add your contribution to the coding grade website will also come up because i pretty much have a video for everything okay um and then there also is this other guide which has that video on it anyway okay where was i uh so the question from the chat is how much time did it take to learn javascript well i don't know if my answer to that question is obvious but i would say a lifetime i don't think there ever is a moment where you finish learning coding have learned it now i do it it is uh and certainly in my experience you know i started very late in life um well not relative to when most people start coding certainly now in terms of it being integrated into um or educating education systems but i have been doing it now for almost 20 years and i have to relearn it over and over again because it's a constantly moving target um but i know you asked specifically about javascript for me i can only really speak to my experience um i started i don't remember when it was but i should look back and find this but javascript i certainly didn't really program in until i would i want to say like 2015 maybe a little bit earlier than that um and i think i spent a year bef of sort of like figuring it out and i'm still definitely still figuring out but i don't know that i felt comfortable in javascript the language um for for at least a year and also like i don't know 80 percent of the 90 whatever the percentage is of things that people who work professionally uh developing for frontend and backend web stuff and other things in javascript no maybe they don't know 80 of the things that i know i don't know but like i don't know most of the like frameworks that people use i don't know how some of the latest yesterday i was trying someone was telling explain to me what axios is um and so um there's there's so much always to learn okay um all right so marcos is factchecking me said i believe you were already teaching javascript before okay i don't think so maybe maybe i was we'll have to look is there a way to connect a node.js that uses discord.js with a processing p5 sketch aloho um that is coming soon on the coding train all right i gotta move move along here let's get back to our community contributions we are going to spin the wheel which i can only ever find by scrolling down into issues to this one called real link did i bookmark it maybe i'll bookmark it and here thank you to gypsy dangerous for helping to create this wheel um by the way um i think this is a project now that i'm using it regularly we could uh could use some attention we could make some improvements to it um a we should you know something to do is to check to see if the data that it's drawing from is up to date that's a lot of work to do i don't know how to best manage that but um also i've mentioned like i like the idea of maybe some of the people's names populating instead of numbers but here we go let us spin the wheel i would say there is a high probability that we'll be looking at one of the gypsy dangerous projects uh i'm joking gypsy dangerous has uh submitted so many projects there's no this is not a rigged wheel here number 41 we're gonna take a look ah have i looked at this before i mean the problem is i've looked at so many of these i remember what i've looked at live or not um uh prime spiral phylotaxis contributed by sam lee so this is based off of the coding video phylotaxis um that the and if this is uh if i look at the orig i like to just sort of look at the original example which is here you can see this is the original example from that particular video and now you will all contribute to hacktoberfest with no spam pull requests only productive useful pull request yes i am hypnotizing you the open source community you will get your tshirt but you could also plant a tree all right did that work hopefully the internet has been fixed i fixed it everybody thank you all right what was i doing yes aha uh prime spiral phylotaxis oh and using um codepen so one of the things i always like to see is different code editors and platforms um perhaps this i would i get um this is also using looks like native canvas oh and d3 we can see here the code so this is really um wonderful to see i especially enjoy seeing people who take the concept and use it with a different environment and so this to me i believe is also known as the ulam spiral i don't know if i'm pronouncing that correctly i've been meaning to do a video about it in fact um at one point i had this conversation with um stand up maths matt parker about this spiral and i have like a nap i still have like i don't think i kept the napkin but i kept the photo of it it's like in my email like as an email reminder from like three years ago but uh the prime spiral is oh uh um the set of prime numbers devised by mathematician stanislaw ulam 1963. so i believe it is a uh way for sure somebody tell me if i'm right about this um that i think you can sort of like follow a spiral pattern and then a dot appear and sort of like as you're counting the steps a dot appears for a prime number and um you sort of can learn quite a bit about the density of prime numbers and a pattern that's kind of revealed by looking for this uh yeah so you can see here this is sort of like the spiral and then so this would be an awesome coding in the cabana coding challenge video um one thing i haven't really figured out now that i have my regular schedule is how to do the coding in the cabana videos i don't have an extra day of the week uh unfortunately so i again i could take a one of these saturdays off and try to record one um i had some ambitions there but anyway um thank you uh dombo um for your wonderful you can't really can you see the blinking lights you can see my face is kind of like blinking right um all right thank you for that uh sam lee let's look at one more community contribution because i talk so much and spend so much time and it's sort of hard for me to look at more than just two okay spinning the wheel the wheel and we have landed on i feel like it's good that they're numbers it fits with the random number you know we should create instead of a wheel we should have a book that just flips pages and picks a random one uh number six you selected nika cruchell random walker with colors okay so the original challenge is random walk um which is this one very simple algorithm um to move a dot randomly in four different directions and trace its path and if we go back here let's see what we see here from mika so a couple things i love about this uh this is wonderful thank you for sharing this oh sure first of all it's visualizing pi so i love this so one of the things that's interesting to me about the digits of pi is the sort of question around uh detectable is there a detectable pattern or no is what is the distribution of digits um is this visually distinguishable at all between a pure random walk um but an eye just looking at this just assumed here's a random walk larger steps and colors now i wonder here i believe the length it looks to me like the length of the step might be tied to the digit or the color i don't know but that would be an interesting thing to try right when you get one move just one pixel four move four pixels or maybe you pick the direction based on the number i don't know i i wonder how this was done each oh it says right down here read the manual folks each angle corresponds to a digit of pi so you could have the an angle that corresponds maybe a length um the color there's so many uh possible ways uh pi day is a while from now but that's that there's always wonderful possibilities to think about visualizing the digits mapping the numbers to various um parameters within a design system okay um thank you for these wonderful two community contributions um i do try to check them all out the community really enjoys them one thing that's wonderful for me especially also is and i'll just show you an example of this in my nyu class this week um we were looking at how to make your own pose classifier which i cover in this particular video and it was like a wonderful thing for me to be able to show like the students homework was basically to make their own version of this and i have um four uh uh or five just examples of things other people things have made um just right here for us to look at in class and look at look at the halo of the sun right around me right now it's a little sad how i'm always trying to like make myself giffable oh that's one thing i wanted to look at today was the um tenor uh gif tender.com tenor gif api all right let's figure out what we're doing today now it's 10 40. um i just named unoriginal punishing i name dropped matt parker i don't know i didn't mean to be doing that by the way matt parker is not who i think of when i hear the name matt parker because i know somebody else named matt parker who i talk to all the time actually i don't talk to all the time but i used to more often and i i should anyway what i'm talking about i'm getting a little clamped up here okay um what's next i think i might need some help here no no all right first of all let's log in here we go so uh oh wait we've got some we've got a problem this doesn't usually happen to me uh i have a very good connection here at home um where's that button here um i'm getting a message here uh right here it says youtube is not receiving enough video to maintain smooth streaming as such viewers will experience open widget so i click that stream health poor this has not happened to me uh recently um so hopefully you're all seeing this oh yeah you feel like 7.5 stream per second all right we're gonna try to address this shoot i i was concerned this would happen when i started streaming from home i do have uh an expensive you know i paid for like the highest bandwidth possible through the uh um theory of fiber line but one thing i think there's probably a lot of people in my house using the internet i'm gonna go to my wifi settings and give the this pc priority so we'll see if this uh helps um um i can also let's just see i'm gonna um i could also check my i have a mesh maybe one of them got unplugged um which maybe i'll go check when i take a break but hold on let me let me do the wifi priority thing and see if this helps so i'm going to wifi um let's see desktop windows device up um can i i don't want to pause it if i go to devices set priority device desk this must be the i have so many devices it's got to be the windows one that's the machine okay um for let's prioritize it for two hours uh check um i know i i i want to it looks fine oh wait and it's back it's back to excellent okay great so um i would like to run um uh an ethernet line uh up to the attic but i just don't i guess i could get like a super long cable and just like plug it like run it up the stairs and plug it in just on saturday mornings um but i did get an uh uh some new mesh base stations and i put one right up here and i so i the signal has been very good um but i guess that happens from time to time okay the warning is gone now um all right hopefully that will not come back so let's take a look at this so um ah this is something i wanna let's make a list um now just for a second here i had some things open that i don't want to open oh yeah well actually this list is fine but let's just make a new one uh all right sorry everybody this is silly what i'm doing where to come up with some possibilities i should work on the live poll app so that people could vote in real time i know simon will will want me to do that oh it got lower when i was using the filo taxes that's interesting uh where am i here okay so um i want to look at body picks 2.0 um i have made yesterday i recorded a this is done now i recorded a video tutorial on machine object detection models um so hopefully that'll get edited and released in the next week or so um um this this these are things i need to record as tutorials ah um i would like to uh download all code coding train captions that's something i want to work on because i want to train a model for that um these are things i want to do uh this is really a tutorial i want to record so these are all um um a tenor gif api something we could play with um i need to figure out um this question about fetch plus twitter or axios that's something i could work on today um and then um i want i don't think i'm gonna do this right now the everyday calendar is behind but i um behind the green screen for today but i want to um do serial um i want to do camera pixels over serial to everyday calendar so that's the thing i want to do and then there's the live poll uh application which is sort of like a little project that i'm trying to work on anything else um anything else that twitch has an integrated poll system i know what am i doing here oh youtube i cannot i cannot quit you youtube yes am i saying it wrong um it's actually the live poll application would be a perfect thing for me to work on briefly while showing you uh a coding setup like this so i might do that um in a bit this is weird okay um let's um this time this i can't do right now i feel like i'd have to unplug actually i could but it's so bright in here right now that i i should be i should work with the everyday calendar at night um i'm just looking at the chat to see if there's any uh everybody people seem to really like this poll application all right um these are four things five things that i really feel like would be worth taking a look at today um i think um this is yes the thing that i have for spinning okay here we go everyone oh i typed axis yes this should be axios you sure didn't autocorrect me or something okay oh interesting this is perfect actually because one of the reasons why i wanted to look at body pics uh was to figure out um if i could um use that particular machine learning model to control the everyday calendar um and so um i could do more more than one of these um some of these are going to be well famous last words an hour three hours later they're not that quick but um oh people are upset let's do a poll now i'm gonna work let me okay here's the give me 10 minutes um i have a timer on my watch i set it for 10 minutes okay i'm going to allow myself 10 minutes to look at body picks 2 and whenever the 10 minutes is up i stop i take my break um people are saying body pick sounds in nsfw are not safe for work don't worry it is very safe for work it is a machine learning mod have you ever been on a zoom call where you used a virtual background guess what i'm not saying it's using body picks but it's using a machine learning model that separates uh foreground from background or the sort of contours your silhouette the pixels of your body from the background and that's exactly what body picks does um so uh then um let me just look at that really quickly i'm just i'll show people people don't seem happy with this choice anecdotally i don't i give myself 10 minutes okay um so first of all um if i go to learn.ml5js.org um this is actually a particular machine learning model that is in ml5 if i click here under body pics and i scroll down and let's find just uh one of the oh you know what it's actually easier to do this i'm gonna go to examples um and i want to well let's look at this one that says image oh and actually whoops ah i'm the worst um let's go to the web editor once let's go to the one that says image um actually let's use the webcam because that's sort of the point of what i wanted to do uh webcam and i'm going to run it let's see what happens so this is what body pics does and you can see um it it allows you to create a mask um and you know of course i have a green screen here so that's giving me a lot of possibilities that i don't really need something like body picks for but if i were to uh have a much noisier background this particular machine learning model has been trained on segmented images images that have been labeled with people person body pixels versus uh background pixels so this is exact you know i'm not work at zoom i don't know how what they're using you know um exactly and and but zoom is a particular video call software that i use a lot right now and oh i have a video coming out about how to put a p5 p5.js sketch with a machine learning model into zoom oh i'm so excited about this i forgot about that gotta work on that this weekend um so but this is actually working quite well and this is what i was imagining using with the everyday calendar so if i could get with a machine learning model a very a clean or not it doesn't even have to be clean because it's so low i just want to get a silhouette from any generic video um oh but i was gonna do this with processing i don't know how we get body pics and processing that will be an interesting challenge um and um let's just let me just look up everyday calendar um so if you this is what it looks like it's simon yetches uh and so i worked on this last week to um to be able to control all of these different lights uh spots on the calendar individually and so um i could inconceivably walk up to it and see my reflection in it so to speak in real time that's what i want to do eventually now this particular ml5 example is using the original body pics machine learning model i believe this was trained and created by our researchers at google part of the tensorflow team and um that what was i saying here because i started looking at the chat and i forgot what i was saying ah there has been there is more recently a newer version body picks 2.0 which has not um which is not in ml5 yet but hopefully in a future release soon enough so i want to look up body pics 2.0 tensorflow um updated and where is gonna yeah so let's look at this one of these um blog posts i mean this has been oh updated so let's do this body picks 2.0 has been released and you can see here in this demonstration image that not only does it do image segmentation for your body uh you know foreground versus background it there's key points here as well as your body itself is segmented into different parts so try the new demo let's try that i just want to see if this runs a lot faster and it does so you can see this the performance of this is much faster i don't know if it's more accurate than um than what what i just showed you in ml5 but you can see this video the frame rate is very uh is very fluid and this demo is working very uh very well and i bet you if i switch it to one person um and then it can also try this other base model presumably um let's see what happens here um here's another base model with one person is this faster is this better i don't know so i wanted to try to get this working um but um i am i've already used up i have four minutes and 30 seconds left uh so i don't know four minutes yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm not talking to you um so um maybe i'll come back to this uh ten minutes sounds kind of short so simon maybe do a straw poll in the meantime ken maton is asking can we use ml5 in java in processing so this is a great question and so no in the sense that ml5 is a javascript library and it won't work just out of the box without you know any further work in processing but just about everything in ml5 is a layer on top of tensorflow.js and tensorflow.js is a port or a port is exactly the right word but is the javascript implementation of the larger tensorflow machine learning library from google which is written in c plus most people interface with it through python but there are java bindings this has been like a fantasy project of mine yeah that's welcome to my fantasy java bindings for tensorflow what a likewise um um to uh look into this uh tensorflow for java um and try to see if i can get this running and processing anybody wants to work on this um hit me up don't hit me i don't have to i don't unfortunately just i don't believe i uh i don't i don't think i can i have the the time for this right now um in that especially that all my teaching is um so much focused on um um javascript these days okay oh it's getting warm it's very warm up here in the attic the sun is shining all right let's um let me take a few minute break i'll put up a straw poll just out of curiosity and i'm going to take a short break when i come back i want to try i want to show you uh work how i work on a node web application with a sort of like separate monitor setup um so i'll show you that um briefly um thank you to lg for the sponsorship and for sending me this uh monitor um and so that'll be at least a little bit on the live poll application but let's um let me go to a straw poll oh i don't i think i like the other one better i don't know why uh maybe i don't i don't know what were my choices well so this by the way if you pick body picks it would be me actually just trying to write my own code this no one's going to want but this is this is the first step to an ai model that would speak like me suppose potentially you know assuming that the captions of my videos there's a correlation there tender gif api which i do want to make a video tutorial for figure out fetch this i have to do for um this is just like twitter api i'm just gonna call this twitter api uh live poll application and i mean i could put this on there i'll take down that green screen but i think i should leave that out okay um you know what should i allow mo i wonder if it would be more accurate if i allow multiple choices because if you have to only pick one is that really an accurate reflection of what the community is interested in um i don't know let's do a poll as to whether i should allow multiple choices or not i guess i won't allow multiple choices i'm gonna allow multiple choice no uh i hope somebody answered this question for me i can't believe it's been an hour uh i see unoriginal pun is typing i'll wait a minute um chinchya mathur is asking did you try out openai gpt too i don't have beta access to gpt so gpg3 um you might be asking what is gpt3 it's a a large language model that um allow multiple choices okay tetris make the list yeah tetris i could get started on i honestly would be happy to get started on that okay um let's create this poll all right so hopefully oh my timer is up perfect stop um hopefully uh somebody can put this poll into the chat you know sorry to everybody someone who's going to have to manually retype zxqq3v36w uh put that poll into the chat please um i will take a look at the results no votes wait what do i want um honestly for me i want to look at the twitter api although that might not be successful because i need that for my my class um i also um also this would be good to have because then i we could just use it all the time oh i i'm going to vote for them all i don't i don't know i'm not voting did somebody paste it in i'm still waiting to see it appear in the chat all right let me do it thank you to siobhan unfortunately you have to be there we go k weekman did it all right here we go uh results so will this show me in real time i will leave this up and i will be back oh i have to press refresh manually i will be back in just about five minutes so do do do so do do don't ah i am back i have an issue by the way first of all i just very warm up here so i got rid of my sweatshirt um i have an issue with my stream deck it often like starts to like just work really really slowly like for example i'm gonna press now the laptop only scene and there it finally appears and then i'm gonna press again the uh to put myself back and like i don't understand why it's it's usually when it's working it's instantaneous it's very responsive and i i've tried so many things reinstalling uninstalling i don't know if anybody's experienced this but if you use the elgato stream deck product let me know all right so it looks like the results are fairly clear and i think that's good um this is kind of like a learning project for me um kind of learning more about serverside programming learning more about networking i gotta refresh my knowledge and understanding of web sockets which i think i might want to use well that's not entirely necessary and then mostly while the reason why i'm doing this is because i want to work on more interactive um overlays for uh live streaming so and um that's something that by the way i don't think i'm gonna run this right now but i the the video that i'm going to release shows you how to create an overlay in a um video call so it actually will work with the video i use zoom platform um but it's it's i use open broadcast studio to create a virtual camera and then i can create a layout with overlays in open broadcast studio then i can train a machine learning model to recognize when i'm saying raising my hand and put like an animation of like i have a question in front of me or something like that this came from an idea that i referenced in the video from a twitter user cameron hunter um so anyway um that's also why i'm working on this because i like the idea of just overlays in general sort of augmenting a live video stream and so that's that's that's kind of the focus that i want to work on all right um i'm also going to use this as a sort of perfect confluence here as an opportunity again to sort of thank the sponsor lg who sent me this particular monitor that i'll talk about because i want to what i'm going to do is set up um my coding environment on this monitor now i have to do something a little bit odd to do that so the first thing and by the way you can find links to about this monitor in the video's description um the thing that i'm going to do unfortunately is the what's coming out of the laptop right now the hdmi cable that's coming out of the laptop is going into the streaming pc so i'm going to unplug that kind of dangerous here and plug it into the monitor so um i'm doing that right now so there it is then um i actually should have um one thing that's uh wonderful about the monitor is how just this is how like well it works for example how do i get back to that it's already giving me a message like oh you've connected a new external input and you want to use it i could have clicked yes has this nice button on the bottom i can just go over here to input and i can switch it oops um go over to input and i can switch up i believe i'm in hdmi one and i should see oh i can't see my streaming console anymore oh look at this it auto i don't know why but for whatever reason i've got the cozy coding um uh background can i change that change that so by the way i can't see anymore what i'm live streaming i guess i could go and look watch the live stream on my laptop wow my console is gone like am i still live streaming do you see it near me you could tell me but i don't know i guess you could um if you like i could look at the disc you know what i'm gonna do i've got um discord on my phone here so please codingtrain members if you could communicate with me in the coding train live chat um um i'm looking at that chat right here and let me know if i'm still live streaming and showing you anything that you can that useful so let's let's get a picture of gloria pickle uh i've got to find my mouse again this is crazy where's my mouse it's so much screen space do you see me do you see me i don't know where what's who's seeing me where uh all right um where's my mouse i gotta find my mouse it's so much screen space that i can't there it is uh which way is this way uh okay hold on this is really crazy that i can't find my mouse give me a second here um let me try unplugging it for a second here because i can get my mouse back on um this screen can plug it back in stream is still good okay please keep me um posted uh i'm looking for displays and i'm going to say arrangement okay that's perfect so i'm going to the right when i want my mouse to come over here there's my mouse and then i can go back to desktop and i'm going to bring my mouse over and i want to pick gloria there we go there's gloria pickle oh she is so cute all right so now i've got this picture of gloria pickle and now i'm going to start setting up my coding environment so first of all let me just um say uh quickly that this particular monitor um is um the lg ultra wide 34 inch um monitor um it has rgb 99 color gamut in hdr 10 multitasking dual controller on screen control amd freesync technology three side virtually borderless design and a tilt height adjustable stand and by the way it's really nice to play roblox on in addition to coding on so please check out the just the links to it in the video's description um all right so now what i'm going to do is i'm going to go to i term open that up and i'm going to bring that over here okay all right you're finally going to need to use the cursor trails is that still a thing all right try to keep your messages in the discord chat right now to like important things where i have to like fix the thing on the live stream because i cannot see my console right now um all right so that is so let's go to uh desktop you i don't you probably can't actually read what i'm doing so um live poll we're gonna go to the live poll app um then i am going to uh get a browser window i'm going to bring that over here this is what i like to do i have i can run um so and i can say let's let's look if i do index.js and i go to localhost 3000 i love you localhost 3000 we can see there's the live poll um and i can i can have so much screen real estate that i can have both the web app that i'm working on as well as sort of javascript console for errors right here um i can put this up here then what i will also often do uh while i'm coding is and i'm coming back to my monitor here i will go to like um have my references wait what here um i will have my reference uh up here so i'm typically this would be like the p5 reference potentially so this is how i like to have a setup so i have like node here mp5js.org and i might go on to the reference and then you know if i and and then of course there's the actual code and so the actual code itself i will um have on this laptop so i'm gonna um open up another tab here i'm going to say code i'm looking at the chat no one has said anything i can't see the youtube chat right now and i'm going to open up um this and basically what this allows even though i'm having all this trouble with my mouse right now as soon as i'm done and i have the code open basically um and actually a really good thing that i could do to improve this setup would be to um well actually i'm not going to do that right now so the nice thing that i could do here is just fix this um i can so if i'm going to make a change like right now i'm i want to change that to be blue and i'm going to add some a console log like console.log test um and i can just uh it's going to refresh it and i can see here ah there's my console logo is there an error i'm changing the code like i'm typing over here and then ah it's now yellow if i want to do stuff in terminal i can just do that over here and i'm able to do this without like moving the mouse around because i can just switch between windows very easily so i always keep the mouse and my code editor on this here but certainly if i were just using this monitor like it doesn't have it doesn't have to be a secondary monitor there's enough screen real estate that i could very easily just fit my um code editor uh in a panel here the terminal here so many possibilities so let's let's try to just um start thinking about how to work on this let me remind myself what is this live poll application so the idea is that i have a server well i have done nothing on this so i'm looking at the code right now there's a lot to work on and it's about 1120 now know how much further we'll get but the idea is that i want to run a server that anybody could look could go to a web page and the server is going to serve that web page and allow them to vote in one of four options then the server is going to keep track of all of the votes and then display them in real time on a web page and this web page i would then show as an overlay onto my um onto my live stream makes sense um let me go back to my i'm very disturbed by not having my live stream console so i just want to see that uh okay great so i'm back to my live stream console i don't know why it's detected a new device here and discord um this is really like i mean coding with a large monitor is awesome but having running a live stream on your own in an attic you don't know how i would do it without having all this screen real estate um and simon's pointing out you can't see the code which is why i'm going to switch back now to actually doing this from my laptop in the usual way i just wanted to show you that configuration which is incredibly convenient for working on a project all right so i'm going to switch the hdmi plug again i think you'll be able to see me do that i'm coming over here hello so i'm just taking this hdmi cable which was connected to my laptop and i am now plugging it into the capture computer for live streaming so that shouldn't change anything that you see it's going to change a lot of things for me um and um i've got my console back and i hopefully can switch back to this view yep and here we are and here's the code so and now everything that i open now now here's the thing this is why it's so great to have a secondary monitor um because now i have everything uh on one uh screen here so i have to sort of like alt tab between all the various things which i'm used to doing while i'm streaming it's no problem but they're all sort of in separate places okay so let's think about how we're gonna do this my children are arguing can you hear that argue with each other hopefully it doesn't get too intense all right so the main thing that i need to do i think first is to have some kind of database on the server that's keeping track of the votes and i like this particular node package called nedb or any db which is a very lightweight database so let's try i mean i could just use a json file frankly and that's what this is but let me install nedb and let me run this which i like to do whenever it tells me to and then let's go down to the code and see i want to uh acquire it require and also i use this in my intro to data and apis so i think i would like to find those those examples would be helpful um do i use it here data selfie app just just take a look at this for reference um yeah so this is what i do and then i create a data store and load the database so let's also do that and then i want to create us one route uh which is just like a vote route should i i think i could probably get away with it just being a get request but it should probably be a post when you vote should it be a post or a get does that matter so i get you know the words get and post what's that loud noise okay um all right let's see um let me think about this let's just work with a get request right now um called vote hey vote register to vote um and um i'm going to add in this exact thing so we're going to set up a route and i realize i'm kind of jumping a lot of you might not be familiar with anything that i'm doing that's a little bit what this side project saturday is um and um um i don't need any of this sorry i'm being distracted by lots of noises and i just want to get a parameter here um let's just do console.log is this how i do it request.params so i want to create a route a get request so get versus post an http request is a request that a client like you're on a web page you type in the server your google.com or whatever it is you're typing in you make a get request please give me the stuff a post request is like ah i'm going to send you some stuff and you could give me a reply but you can use a get with a get request you can sort of send information that is like a parameter to the get request so i think i'm going to use that right now um and then um respond no response dot send uh hello is this right so i think if i set up this route and i restart the server and maybe i should use nodemon um so nodemon or node monitor is a way to run a node um a node application where any time you change the code it will auto restart and so i want that to be a global module so i think if i say npm install g nodemon did that work and then i think i could say nodemon index.js so you can see here to restart it anytime enter rs watching paths watching extensions starting so now in theory if i did this you can see it restarted the server so i don't have to remember to do that sometimes i want to intentionally stop and start the server but this um so if i go to local host 3000 a vote i get hello friends um and now if i do uh no i want to use um maybe i should use those like reston routes so if i do vote slash a um if i do i think if i configure it like this choice then then is this what i do so this becomes i don't know the terms for this choice becomes like a variable basically and is it in request.params is that where i find it request params poll and then i think i could do console.log request prints uh choice i think this is how i do it so now um and so let's um i'm gonna do i'm gonna just send some json back um and i'm gonna send vote uh i'm gonna co i'm gonna get the choice and i'm going to say vote choice okay so now great so and whatever i put here i will get that back so i know that's being logged in the server now probably you know oh there's so many things to think about when you create a web application and i'm going to make one that all of you are going to be able to probably like destroy and hack and ruin very quickly so um but you know such is life so now in the database how do i add something to the database um this is the date insert so i can cr i can insert something but i don't want to i want to keep track of a k oh i almost want to just use my own json file i want to update update is what i want to do if it doesn't exist so wait i have a lot of control here over what's going on let's insert um so like if i say uh just for the sake of argument choice a is a zero like this is oh no no um this is so confusing like label is this what i want to do um it seems silly to use um i guess i want to make a poll object yeah maybe i should just make do this poll uh i don't need a separate entry for every choice every entry to the database is a particular poll that makes more sense so the poll has a 0 b 0 c let's just say it's gonna have four choices right now and then um database insert poll so if i do this there it is now i don't want to do that anymore i don't want to insert another one so let's take this out i just want to have one i have to think about how you insert a pole but now uh this is why i don't uh uh database and see what happens here great uh so and it should be that in the database is just this one poll hmm so i could have just do this without a database at first and just use persistent memory while running the node server but because i'm going to restart the node server so many times i need to save the votes like i want to like save and reload the votes so i probably need a separate interface for adding polls um and then which one i'm loading but this is just going to be the only uh poll and then i should give the poll a name like i should be able to look it up by a name maybe this is the unique key there's so much to think about here and i'm just trying to like skip 90 of those steps uh yes paul and simon is right the vote route should look like vote poll idea choice perfect thank you so let me do that um let me go back to i like this idea so i that was just my like quick way of adding something to the database and then so now this should be poll id choice let's try this and so now here i should be able to query from the database um where where where where where where how i query basic query means you're looking for documents whose fields match the ones you specify find planet solar i just want to find one with the i particular id so let's do this so so database find id is params oh response params poll id and it i can actually just do this right why why is my auto format doing that to me that seems insane all right fine can i make this um does this uh does any db support promises oh a dead simple promise wrapper has this been maintained two months ago i'll take that all right let's try this uh i like to use promises you'll see why in a second i like to use the async and await syntax now it's how i do everything find one is actually what i want to do maybe um so let's see npm install any db those are called promises i hope this works and now i should be able to switch to any db promises right um and then um now i should be able to say i should be able to make this function a sync function and say uh poll equals await database find ah no stop seriously what what setting do i have this is making me crazy does anybody know like how do i find quickly where that setting is it's like the line length setting maybe um and i need an equals here i'm gonna just have to i'll leave it for right now and then let's see if this works um so my server oh crashed database load database is not a function why not data store create oh do i do it this way there are no callbacks all right oh will this work whoops i oh i'm i'm so used to restarting the server myself line length okay let's see can i line length uh extensions text maxed i don't know i don't know how to find this setting if it's part of like something that i installed like beautify config is that what i'm using um and can i like add a user setting maybe somebody can tell me where this might be yes lint no must be beautify um can i how do i get the json oops yeah like something like this like editor line length now beautify beautify oh someone's going to tell me command shift p type settings.json prettier print with if you're using prettier am i using prettier i don't think so uh i can't recall uh print with no i know i could disable format on save i like it formatting it on save i just don't want a longer line length okay gotta go back to here somebody will tell me okay okay let's make sure this still works um let's go to here a 404 not found all right so i need to do the poll id which is insane that i have to like but i'm just going to do that let's just grab this put it uh vote slash this slash b okay uh cannot read property poll id of undefined um pull id let's just send back um uh response dot um params all right hopefully this is gonna work oh request oh did i have response up there why did i have that that's a mistake there we go why did i say so the request is the data coming in responses for things coming but going out let's see what happens here okay is the database still there yeah it's empty wait database find id oh do i have to say like underscore id that's weird all right let's just be there must find field equals true i guess i have to go back to the regular nedb docs to understand how this works um fine basic querying is finding by an id like is that not fine is that like a get or something in this it seems like i'm not supposed to do this because it's underscore but let's just do this um and here we go there we go okay well that works all right did anybody figure out my uh line length i don't know how you would figure it out i guess i would look under extensions like where where's exten is this extensions yeah i have beautify these are the things i have installed eslint and beautify settings uh extension settings config path to a file oh i can create a file js beautify rc beautify ignore um beautify line length vs code yes cool open extensions menu then click on extension change the line length extension settings change the line length yeah extension uh i don't understand um extension settings doesn't seem to be a lot of extensions huh tab size editor line length oh yeah but javascript format wrap line length is that what i would do but that's for that seems weird should i not use beautify where's cj when you need the coding garden is it what was it uh is i'm not looking here okay hold on oh pretty we'll always do this okay maximum line yeah dart this is crazy that this is what i'm stuck on it's 1140 formatter in js section okay all right command shift p format document command shift p uh format talking with configure default formatter i'm lost totally lost all right this is what i was looking for line i guess i could put this in js beautify like i guess do i need to do it in my own file just install printer just install prettier i thought cj uses beautify though i just took my settings from cj in the settings in the js section okay um text editor where do i find javascript uh javascript extensions eslint typescript i don't understand js ah no this is making me crazy settings editor control w side project to fix line length come on i really i really want to fix this just install come on people oh i'm gonna get this i'm gonna get you line length i've done this like so many times maybe i should use prettier um all right hold on vs code javascript line length that's obvious command to rewrap code to respect a preferred that's from 2000 maximum line length in your code prettier line break when curly brace okay cj uses prettier scroll down i'm sorry all right all right fine goodbye i uninstalled it prettier this is what i want do i want prettier eslint i don't know let's try this okay installed it now i've installed prettier why is there a setting for every single like language but no all right it's totally prettier didn't i prettier is installed settings so i think the settings the setting that i'm looking for is not a setting of the code formatter it's a vs code setting it uses old control shift p really gone off the rails here these extensions conflicts with eslint search for prettier in settings all right i don't think i need to restart it but let's restart it um i'm really off the rails i was making progress until i decided that i couldn't take it anymore ah okay i got rid of beautify and put in prettier and it's fine now all right great amazing all right who knows what happened but i'll take it i'll take it we can move on now okay so now what i want to do is update how do i update um i found the poll then um so let's make sure i'm doing this correctly um and i'll get back where am i here okay i get the poll back and then i want to whatever the vote is i want to say poll so we're going to say const vote equals request params choice so i should maybe i'll call this choice poll choice plus plus and then can i how do i update it then what i want to do is use update insert find update remove persistence update right that's what i want to do insert db.update query update options callback oh it's the same kind of finding query used with find and find one but it specifies how the document should be um oh so i can just update it and increase the number at the same time let's see if i do that so i should be able to say update um and then set um see any db increment count i don't want to auto increment the field in any db find sort limit exact this seems crazy there's got to be a way to sort of like update this one with oh increment there we go so it must be like this increment queried by the modifier distance 38 so maybe i can do this weight id increment choice um wait no no how do i i want it to rap i'm just kidding go to the next line [Laughter] i have the opposite problem now um increment this like with this let me just do this for a second if i do this no matter what i vote for it's going to increment a by one right let's see if this works oh error invalid code use i guess i need like a try catch to get a better error message we've got 10 minutes left in this live stream okay there's no special function for updating you don't need the separate plus plus it does it automatically um this is display like this will eventually require object dot keys poll for each uh pulling but people are um all right so increment a by one that's what i assume by looking at this documentation oh increment distance 38 maybe this doesn't mean increment i mean the thing is like i can easily just get it add one to it and then update the value maybe i should just do that i'm gonna do that right now uh um find one id right update id like is this would this work right and this is there's got to be a better way to do it but what i'm doing here is i'm saying give me the poll increment the count of the choice by one and then update the poll and then send it back let's see if this works um yeah so this works so i'm gonna i'm sure this could be fixed in one line what if i put something that's not there oh look at that it adds it so obviously i need some kind of protection there to not do that but that's fine um all right great okay so this is now voting route and then um i want to just do app.get votes and then this uh so this would also be the poll id and then you would get um where what am i doing here um await database find one response.send this is a lot of duplicate code but why not all right so then oops and this is putting this into a sync await function so i've got two routes now in the server one where i can vote and one for i can see the results so let's go back to the p5.js sketch and um i want to use uh fetch so let's do like a function called count votes and i'll say i'm going to get from the server uh yeah i know it's supposed to be a wait i was gonna add that in later stop fixing everything for me i'm writing the code not you uh and then oh okay and then um so now draw i'm going to uh do this do this okay so first we have and then we will count the votes and then in draw i'm going to get the choices are object.keys of the votes and then for every choice of choices and i think actually i'll use more traditional loop because i'm going to spread these out i am going to say uh rectangle well i got to fix this 10 um i uh i'm just gonna pick some arbitrary choices right now uh start at 20 pixels down spaced out by 20 pixels and the width is gonna end with 10 pixels high and the width will be the um votes choice dot just that count times two times ten and uh phil uh let's just make it zero uh no stroke and let's see if what this does so now if i go to here all right get localhost 3000 votes didn't work oh i need a i need a um an id so what's the id that i need uh oh my god what's going on here this is bad that's not what's supposed to happen i'm not updating it something is really wrong oh dude i did something terrible all right let's not worry about this right now oh i've done something bad i don't know how to use net database.db net any db apparently um but just for um just to get this to work for a second let's just see if this works assignment to constant variable at count votes choice is not defined let's sketch line 18. uh oh that's the thing in the array okay all right let's put um let's put uh fill uh text uh so let's do who let x equals 10 let y equal this uh let's put the text at uh of that choice at x comma y plus 20 plus 10 um and then this will start at x plus 20. whoops uh uh what's what's what happened here what did i do what did i mess up choice no that's right i just wanted to require is not defined i don't have require oh that it's auto adding some weird stuff for me that i don't want okay it's got the id there i got to work on this all right so in the chat has it brace style collapse preserve in line okay okay i'll get to that later um all right so this is the uh now i just want to have this be like live so i'm also going to do a set interval count votes and again maybe eventually i want to use web sockets but i'm just going to like every second maybe let's try like half a second let's count the votes so in theory if i were to take this and kind of put this page over here and i'm going to vote for b yeah look at that every time i vote in real time it's updating yes okay so that's kind of working uh it's about just about noon so i've made progress on this a very very slow crude progress i don't have an interface the database is not working let me see if i can at least fix the thing where i'm updating the database correctly does anybody have all right so let's start over here maybe i so did the server restart no okay so this is correct let's filter out id um that seems like i don't want to to to send that to display that so um isn't that like how does filter work oh i can't do anything anymore i'm like my brain is dead i have to end this live stream um filter uh to do better do something different than this uh all right so this should remove that every oh no i have to actually refresh the yeah there we go okay and i don't all right so all right so now i'm getting the live votes and it is coming from any db now if i were to vote it's counting it is it it's making separate entries so what am i doing wrong in instead of update all right so this is clearly wrong i'm finding it incrementing a value and then updating it filter value value does not equal id thank you all right so people are upset at my not actually using i'll actually do filter i just got kind of tired it's like this is easier uh i should probably filter it somewhere else but i can basically filter by another function so i take the element and i'm just looking as long as that element i filter out i say if it's not equal to id um this what i'm doing apparently that worked right i filter out any elements oh i keep all the elements where this is true so it's not equals yes okay um i could use a regular expression uses an append only format it should auto compact at some point really that's what super bunny the pen only behavior is built into any db it is working as expected they purposely don't do seeking overwriting oh chris manning is suggesting uh redis so is any db something i shouldn't use i'm happy to okay i've got the message now that it is using the append only format fine i don't know what um i i just want to use something simple at the beginning that like makes sense but what is redis um oops i never heard of that redis database npm this looks popular what is this a high performance node.js redis client i don't know what that redis okay what is redis what is redis open source inmemory data structure store uses a database cache and message broker it supports data structures such as strings hashes list sets this looks good um i like this this sounds like what i should use should i switch i've never used redis redis is for cache use firebase remote dictionary server a key value store uh it isn't file based try out low db i want something i guess actually this is silly because my realtime polling application i don't actually need to save it to a database i just thought like we could save polls and i maybe i should use a database and have a local one i'm now realizing that's kind of unnecessary i'm over engineering this is a small local json database powered by load upload i mean the way i want to do this is just write my own i was going to do this by just using writing my own json file i mean ultimately that's what i should do uh firebase suits this i don't want to use a database as a service for this um right now um that's probably silly i don't want to over engineer this i can always come back and do this later all right i'm gonna leave i'm gonna i'm gonna file this as an issue okay so i'm i'm looking for your feedback here um let's go to um because i have to wrap up um um database okay i don't actually need a database because i can just store the votes in memory for a real time poll but what if i want to restart the server and not lose the votes currently i'm using any db just as a simple beginner friendly database example please add your suggestions and thoughts to to this thread all right so people um you can go to the coding train live poll issues and comment there and i'll think about this for the next time since i have this working i just want to put this as an overlay so oh right i forgot that i was trying to do this on glitch all right so i'm gonna do this in a very crude way but it's gonna work um but how am i gonna get it so that people can actually vote even though you're all gonna like hack first of all let me do a mapping let me let me try to like keep things in check here so the first thing i want to do is normalize the values um so i'm sure i could do this with higher order array functions but i know the minimum is going to be zero uh max votes um so let me just do four let choice of choices let count equal votes choice um max votes equals whichever one is bigger which is math.max between count and max votes is that right and then console log max votes let's make sure this is working um not a number what why did that not work oh first of all i'm in p5 so i don't have to do math.max number for the first parameter what choice well how come that didn't work oh is it because i'm no i filtered out id oh those are the choices what what am i doing here no i filtered out id i thought do i have to set it oh i guess i have to well how come that worked down here weird i don't know what's going on oh because the width maybe this is so weird anyway it's working now okay so i have the maximum and then i want to um map the number of votes between zero and max votes to a width between zero and let's just say 100 so whichever so if i go here so as i continue to vote the number b is going up but it's just sort of normalizing them okay so that's what i wanted to do also to keep them normalized just as a percentage in case the votes go crazy um now one is not a is one log the count you need to do choices yes so that's um okay okay so excellent i'm gonna do something a little weird here you'll see in a second um just gonna make the background green because i'm gonna i'm gonna the way i'm gonna capture this is not the way that i intend to eventually but wait why there we go um and so actually instead of doing that i got to get rid of the autofill that it's doing that has nothing to do with let's add um how do i do this body background is that is that how css works there we go okay so what i'm going to do now could i if i'm this is localhost could i open and my pc is on the same local network can i open this webpage on the pc um serving this here i was gonna do this it's gonna show you um uh all right i'm just looking at the chat this is i'm i'm wrapping this up i want to get allow people to vote so i maybe i should deploy this to glitch let's you all break it but why not um so let's go to coding train live poll uh edit project i don't have a way to i need to figure out a way to sync my local development with glitch um yeah i just need the ip okay i'm wrapping up people by the way i'm i'm running 15 minutes behind um okay all right i definitely have to be done by 12 45. i mean i need to be done well before then i can use ngrok i'm afraid to use ngrok i do want to learn and if i use ngrok am i opening myself up to any like extreme risk i don't like glitch is not working all right i want to learn ngrok secure public urls for testing your chatbot all right what could go wrong what could possibly go wrong sign up i don't have it do i dare sign up with github or google um people in uh uh uh coding trained members trust trusted members tell me if i shouldn't use ngrok but i think i'm going to um brought the out saying don't use ngrok okay no what i want to do is i want people to be able i want to give a url the chat where people can vote uh without destroying i mean i could deploy this to like digital ocean or something i could also just demonstrate it and i'm the only person who can vote if only i had a live polling application that i could use uh you can just download it no need to sign up i'm i'm trusting prothmesh right now which is telling me not to use ngrok um oh local all right i'm gonna i'm gonna um so download this is so bad no a profit match i need to serve my node application so it's not about hosting the client all right i'm gonna go i'm gonna go for it if you all hack my house i'll be sad now how do i use it oh i have to i have to sign up fire it up i should learn how to use this what could go wrong ngrok is fine for testing okay all right i'm gonna sign up for this um but just not show my screen while i'm signing up for it um let's use i'll use my coding train google account or i probably should use github i hate like connecting these things but i'm just let's just use github um authorize ngrok private sure okay so i'm i'm there off okay so this is great my auth token is here so i'm not showing that i for once i'm not showing you my auth stroke token unzip path to ngrok i probably want it so i'm just i'm going to um just just give me a second i apologize for not showing you what i'm doing but it there's an auth token so i'll explain what i'm doing in a second oops and let's go desktop and grock into live poll i'm just going to put it on i'm just going to put it on the desktop right now i know sorry you can't see what i'm doing okay great i've got ungrock let's see if i can do my auth token auth token saved okay okay so now all right so let me just um i want to show you what i did without showing my auth token so let's see if i can just do something really quickly this is very hacky but i'm going to show you the steps that i did right now so basically i downloaded oh sorry i downloaded ngrok which is um as soon as i zoomed the little thing i put covering up my auth token all right i gotta there's gotta be a quick way i can reset that off token right authentication uh toke uh your auth token uh regen reset auth token okay yep all right so i've reset the auth token so the one that you just saw doesn't work anymore just so you know um i don't you need to start on the command line so um um and then i'm going to you don't see i'm gonna i'm gonna do it again i won't zoom into my um i won't zoom in this time no zooming so these are the steps i have this ngrok file i i um i then run this ngrok auth token to authenticate and then now i can i should be able to run the other ngrok commands which i'm going to do i'll do a tutorial about this at some point and then i can always just blur it out um if this works well um so let me go and sorry ngrok right all right so now i should be able to oh hold on okay i should be able to now use this command ngrok http 80 and it's going to like run a server with some and this is going to send you into my computer oh my god this is very dangerous oh but this doesn't how's that going to run my node server i need to use ngrok from within like i'm not serving those files i want to expose can i integrate it into my node code this doesn't make any sense all right this is not going to work without i don't know how to do this right now right like for example there's nothing in this directory that's private but i'm just gonna go into public and if i type in uh uh ngrok http 80. oh whoops i guess i got to put it in my path will this do it so i'm running this server and if you go to this url right now oh make sure a web service is running on localhost 80. oh so it will actually work okay great but i want to do it on port 3000 okay got it so i'm doing it on port 3000 so if i go to this amazing you should all be able to see this if you go to this url oh that's wild okay so now oh i don't need the background color then because i actually have this uh working so i should take i'll i'll leave the background color why not so i'm while you're all hacking my whole system here i'm gonna go over to um my camera only layout and i am going to go open up a browser and i'm gonna say ngrok so i'm doing this in open broadcast studio i can actually show this to you sort of because i can go to here but you can't really see what i'm doing now so i'll just come back to here ngrok uh okay so i can use an n i can start ngrok from node itself so create new ngrok then um i need the to be what's the url 41 b 8 e e 0 d 4 d 8 dot n grock dot i o okay here we go um should have filtered better okay people i gotta fix my bad words could show up here thank you for uh telling me that filter elt um so i want to just use a regular expression that i'm only filtering for votes that are well i could filter in the server itself but i'm just going to filter here is a abcd test i think this is how um i think oh you don't see what i'm coding right now nope um i'll show you what i'm doing um what i'm trying to do is i'm saying filter by uh test a regular expression that it matches a b c or d um like start and end so it's only for and now because we can't have nice things let's see if that filter worked nope what's wrong with this regular expression i forget how regular expressions work um oops oh that's not a function okay that's how it works okay this is it i'm gonna make sure that it only is a valid one there we go filtered better people okay uh okay now back to here and let's see if i can refresh this ngrok how do i refresh so i refresh properties refresh there's got to be a way i i feel like i remember seeing in obs refresh there we go there we go okay so there's the poll and you can vote for your favorite option a b c or d vote people there's no interface for you to vote vote but this is it except it's over here this is my live polling application running on this laptop here for ngrok um i'm gonna vote i'm gonna do some voting to make sure it's updating unfortunately i have to vote manually oh my god there's by the way these are the messages that people um i can actually show these because nobody put anything bad um if i go back to here i might these are these are should have filtered better hello kittens foo potato hello people greeting from germany ddd so they're still in there i'm not actually filtering it and saving in the database but a is winning with 116 votes um we'll go back to here and i'm going to try let's try voting up d can everybody try voting up d for me and so i'm voting up d so this is great this is my live poll if now if i actually created an interface for it if i actually created an interface for it and let people have the url and all of that you could vote live on the coding trade but that will be next week on the coding trade because i have finished i gotta put it on the other side of me because i am not capable of um gesturing to my to my right so here it is the live pull you can see it's actually an overlay um and um so let let's go ahead and uh commit all this do i have chroma key set up on it already it's weird that that just worked um maybe i'll kill the ngrok now um let's see can we get a moving people let's get a moving let's just see if we can do this as a community let's see if we can get a to grow while i'm while i'm kind of finishing things up here closing a lot of stuff um i think it might have broken i'm getting a bunch of error messages but um this is pretty interesting to see i can see in real time through ngrok um what all the connections that are currently open and what people are doing if the stream goes down it's because it's the same internet connection yeah sorry for people are asking how to vote there's no interface for doing it or anything right now so um but let me um let me go ahead and um commit this code um i'm not let me add to uh get let me add the database to git ignore um because i don't know what's in there so um why is it still showing up did i misspell git ignore oh it's in public that's why um let's move that to the trash and just i want to create a get ignore file no not in public will can i move it yes move already exists oh oh i'm silly i already have one because for node modules right of course let's add that great perfect uh live polling work from stream and um this is what's known as a clicker by the way i don't know if anyone knows that reference um get push origin meme i'm still running it by the way we can check on it here a is winning now thank you everybody that's so cool this is really fun i'll be able to use this soon enough once i work on more of an interface and some other stuff for it and then i should actually also like i'm accepting community contributions to this and i'll just merge but i the reason why i didn't merge them when they came in is i meant to merge them or look through them on a live stream so that'll be next saturday it's 12 30 i really gotta go uh so did i push my code all right i'm gonna kill ngrok um should filter out with is not a number yeah um let me i'm gonna kill ngrok look at this we can see all the requests that are coming in wow is somebody trying to like ddos me because there's a lot coming in very very quickly um let's kill ngrok how do i kill it i'm pressing ctrl c is it dead if i close this tab yeah i think it's gone i don't know what all those errors are all right the server's down nobody should be able to connect anymore if i go back to here it's there but i assume it's just gonna be frozen with that right now all right everybody thank you for tuning in what is coming up so most recent first of all let me say a thank you again um it's just a lot of people using it okay uh thank you again to um lg the sponsor of today's coding train episode this monitor has really changed the way i'm able to work and live stream and keep track of everything going on um i encourage you to check out the links to this particular lg monitor and pick up one for yourself that's another way you could support the coding train um in the links in the video's description um other stuff that is happening in the world of coding train is um let me go to youtube uh the youtube channel could hold the coding train i recently released this video tutorial about github pages and there are two more that are coming out and i'll show you one of them uh not the tutorial but i'll just show you the code example the probably the next one to be released is looking at on the up the ml5 object detection model so i'll just run this um and what it does is if it would work huh oh no it's about to come alive it's just being slow um it it's using a pretrained model to do object detection um if i hold up my phone it's gonna uh get that as a remote or a cell phone um and let's see does it recognize this bell no train whistle banana so i made a whole video about this particular model i actually should show you um in most of the video i actually just use a static image or really being slow today ml5 object detection here let's take a look at that oh what this is that i'm seeing over here um uh come on oh why is this not working there we go so you can see here the object got couch dog and cat that's gloria pickle and greta goose so anyway there's a video tutorial coming out about this model stay tuned for that um as well i've done something really fun that i hope when i can get this released people will use i created a um i wonder if i can actually even just pull this up so i created a sketch called zoom annotations and what this does is depending on it's it's it's trained for me in a different context but basically it creates this keyed set of popup animations that i'm able to overlay over um a zoom meeting and i in the video i i go through how that works so that you could raise your hand or give a thumbs up or a thumbs down and have these different annotations appear over your video image so stay tuned for that those are the things that are coming next um and i hope i really hope that people like play with this and make their own versions of it um it's gonna be a while like this this one is taking me some time to figure out how to like get the example together and the video added together to release but those are coming out soon so once again my process every friday i'm doing recording video tutorials the first one of which just came out here you can tune into those recording sessions by signing up to be a member but don't worry if you can't don't worry you know you won't miss anything the videos will all come out and then on saturdays i'm doing my side project saturdays that's what today was uh hopefully you'll um i'm getting a million text messages because i really gotta go uh lots of stuff is happening um so hopefully i'll see you on a future live stream maybe i'll try to like um um we'll do this polling more i want to work on the everyday calendar so many things i need to do so stay tuned thank you for watching i hope you enjoyed this live stream um what do i want to say i don't know um that's what i want to say i'm tired um i was just looking to see if there's any questions in the chat um tutu see you later lovely passengers uh uh my brain once if i go two and a half hours i can't put words in a sentence together anymore so i hope that you all have a nice weekend um and that you spend time in however you can with people virtually you stay safe you wear your mask um and you make something creative you do something nice for yourself you take care of yourself do something nice for somebody else um make a pull request to the coding train um but maybe not a spam one that would be a nice thing and i will see you next weekend next saturday 10 a.m every saturday except for when i change it which will be probably fairly often but um right now that's the plan for next saturday all right um i'm gonna put on some goodbye music um and kind of just say goodbye as always i always forget that this stop this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stock stop i just stopped um we're gonna get this live pulling thing really working sometime and i'll see you soon never forget this never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go it's look forward to cartesian coordination autotune and the internet will fix that for me sing it with me it's unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it kittens the kittens the kittens the kids i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effect all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes i really lose okay all right everyone this is me turning off the stream by the way you can go check out uh kobe uh twitch.tv plays things um that's what this message just came in here and now i go over here and i hit uh end the stream okay everybody and stream if anybody has any tips for me by the way to help with this to be able to use these leds but not have this weird effect would love to know and goodbye and stream here i'm clicking it
