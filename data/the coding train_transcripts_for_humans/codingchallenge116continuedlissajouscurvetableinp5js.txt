00:01 - - Hello, this is a quick
follow-up video from my
00:03 - Lissa Jous Coding
Challenge which you can see
00:05 - running here in a 400 X
400 window in processing.
00:08 - What I'm going to do in this video
00:09 - is take all this code,
copy in the P5 just web
00:13 - editor, and convert it all to JavaScript.
00:15 - Can I do that in just like 5 minutes,
00:16 - and get it running in
canvas and the browser
00:18 - so you can use that
code if you want to make
00:20 - a browser based version?
00:21 - Let's see.
00:22 - So this first thing I'm going to do is
00:23 - I'm literally just going to take all the
00:25 - code and copy/paste it.
00:26 - So I'm going to do copy,
00:28 - and then I'm going to come
over here I'm going to do
00:29 - paste, save.
00:31 - And then I'm also going to create
00:34 - right over here in this side bar
00:35 - I can do like Add File,
and I'm going to make a
00:39 - file called curve.js.
00:41 - And then I'm go into
00:42 - curve.js, come back to
processing, get my curve
00:45 - tab, and go over here and paste that in.
00:49 - So now I have both of
those, and then I also
00:52 - just want to go into index of html
00:54 - and make sure that both JavaScript files
00:57 - are referenced.
00:58 - So now I'm ready to start
00:59 - porting, and I'm going to do this in the
01:01 - most manual way possible. I could use
01:02 - regular expressions, or
clever find and replace,
01:04 - or write some code to convert it,
01:06 - but I'm going to do it kind
of one variable at a time.
01:08 - So write all the data types.
01:12 - This is just, ah, you know what?
01:14 - I have an idea.
01:16 - So I need to make a two-dimensional array
01:18 - in JavaScript, and it's
a little bit awkward.
01:20 - I remember I wrote a function once called:
01:22 - Make 2D array.
01:23 - This is somebody else's project.
01:25 - Minesweeper on code
pen, but look there's my
01:28 - Make 2D array function.
01:31 - So I'm going to close that.
01:32 - And I'm going to bring that into here.
01:34 - Just put it at the top.
01:37 - So now I have this Make
a 2D array function.
01:41 - I'm going to change the
order of the arguments.
01:43 - Columns, rows.
01:46 - Rows, columns.
01:48 - Ah!
01:49 - Hopefully that's not
01:50 - going to kill, going to
do anything terrible.
01:52 - So this is function.
01:54 - This is createCanvas.
01:56 - One thing that I need
to do if I'm doing any
01:58 - integer arithmetic, I've got to use floor.
02:02 - Floor, because I want to take, I have to
02:05 - manually take off the decimal plates.
02:08 - And then this is now:
make2Darray, rows, columns.
02:14 - This is let, Let.
02:18 - Okay, keep going down.
02:19 - Function, Let,
02:23 - Let,
02:24 - Let,
02:25 - Let,
02:26 - Let.
02:27 - The let song.
02:28 - The let song.
02:29 - Let, Let, Let, Let song.
02:32 - The let song.
02:34 - Let, Let, Let, The let song.
02:38 - The let song.
02:40 - Let, Let, Let.
02:42 - (laughter)
02:42 - You're watching somebody
sing the word, let,
02:45 - over and over again, and copy/paste let.
02:51 - Okay, so, I'm just going
to take this out for a
02:52 - second, because I don't
know how this saving
02:54 - is going to work.
02:55 - Now class!
02:56 - Oh thank goodness for Yessic's classes.
02:58 - What a lucky day.
02:59 - But this needs to change
to constructor, and
03:01 - now this dot.
03:03 - This dot.
03:04 - Never forget the this dot
03:05 - There's going to be a lot
of this dotting now in this.
03:08 - So I got to add this dot everywhere.
03:09 - This dot.
03:10 - This dot.
03:11 - This dot.
03:12 - This dot.
03:15 - This dot, this dot, this dot.
03:19 - Where did I miss it?
03:20 - I don't need void.
03:21 - I don't need void.
03:22 - I don't need void.
03:24 - I don't need void.
03:25 - Oh, I don't need float.
03:26 - I don't need float.
03:28 - Also, array list is not
a thing we care about.
03:31 - Brackets, just a plain old array.
03:33 - And then I don't need void.
03:36 - And then, this won't work,
03:37 - but I can say for let v of this.path.
03:42 - And then I feel like,
did I use add somewhere?
03:45 - Yeah, this has to be push.
03:47 - Clear?
03:48 - Is clear a JavaScript function?
03:49 - I guess we'll find out.
03:52 - Let me save, Run.
03:54 - Okay, make 2D array is not defined.
03:59 - Great job.
04:00 - Oh, 'cause I have capital letters there.
04:02 - Let's put that in here.
04:04 - No, no, no, don't reload the site.
04:06 - Just do this.
04:08 - P vector is not defined!
04:09 - Ah, Okay.
04:10 - So that's also another one that I forgot.
04:12 - This has to be createVector.
04:20 - And createVector.
04:22 - I think that should be good.
04:23 - And now, Oh, current is not defined.
04:28 - Huh, what is going on here?
04:30 - Oh, this dot current.
04:31 - This dot, this dot, this dot!
04:36 - Current is not defined, line 37.
04:38 - Also, this dot, this dot.
04:43 - There we go, look at that.
04:46 - Lissa drew a table in JavaScript.
04:49 - Let's see how it performs.
04:52 - So by the way, this URL
will be linked in the video.
04:56 - Let's try, I forget how I do this.
04:59 - But if I do, I think if I say createCanvas
05:04 - windowWidth?
05:05 - Is that what it is?
05:05 - NP5 windowWidth, windowHeight.
05:10 - That will give me the whole thing.
05:12 - There we go, and then if I do sketch,
05:15 - or file, should save, file,
05:19 - one more, share, full screen.
05:24 - Here we go.
05:25 - You know what?
05:26 - This is running faster.
05:27 - Crazily, I feel like
this is running faster.
05:30 - I should have just done this
in JavaScript the whole time.
05:33 - It looks, it's less like
weirdly pixelated too.
05:36 - Or maybe it is.
05:37 - So look at that.
05:38 - That's beautiful.
05:39 - View.
05:40 - I mean I'm sure you
05:41 - can't see this because of
the YouTube compression
05:46 - so let me just go back here, and make this
05:49 - something much bigger like 120.
05:53 - And let me, let me go view.
05:58 - Enter full screen.
05:59 - And refresh.
06:02 - Refresh.
06:03 - Did I not save?
06:04 - Save.
06:06 - Refresh.
06:07 - There we go.
06:07 - Now, here it is, your
JavaScript Lissa Jous Table.
06:11 - So if you prefer to work in JavaScript,
06:13 - you can take this code,
or remix it in the P5
06:16 - editor and some other
project, share it with me.
06:18 - This dot Lissa Jous.
06:20 - #This.LissaJous.
06:21 - And I look forward to
seeing what you guys make!
06:24 - Okay, goodbye.
06:24 - See what you all make.
06:25 - Goodbye.
06:26 - (Ding)
06:29 - Oh, wait a second, it broke.
06:33 - Stop.
06:34 - Stop the presses.
06:36 - Stop the presses.
06:38 - Clear is not a function.
06:42 - JavaScript array prototype.
06:47 - Let's look at what it is, what there is.
06:50 - I mean I could just set
it to another array,
06:52 - but is there like some
kind of just clear it?
06:55 - I mean splice all of it,
shift all of it, reverse
06:58 - reduce all of it.
06:59 - No, reduce is something else.
07:01 - I don't know what it
is, but I'm going to go
07:04 - over here, and I know you
can't see me right now,
07:07 - I mean you can't see the code right now,
07:08 - 'cause I've done something horrible.
07:10 - You know what?
07:11 - I have a new key command.
07:12 - Oh, nope, this one.
07:13 - Okay I'm not here anymore but
you're looking at the code.
07:18 - This is probably how I
should do all of my videos
07:20 - No one wants to look at me.
07:22 - What am I going to do
07:23 - Oh, reset, curve, reset.
07:31 - Where's reset?
07:32 - This.path equals, and here I come back.
07:36 - Haha I'm back!
07:37 - And now save, and now refresh.
07:41 - And here we go look.
07:42 - So I'm going to leave.
07:43 - I'm going to leave you
with the end of this video
07:45 - watching this beautiful
Lissa Jous pattern image.
07:49 - Goodbye, I'm still here.
07:52 - I'm still here, goodbye.
07:53 - Enjoy!
