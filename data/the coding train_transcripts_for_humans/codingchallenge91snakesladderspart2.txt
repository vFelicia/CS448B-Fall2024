00:00 - all right welcome to part 2 of my snakes
00:02 - and ladders challenge in this part where
00:05 - I really struggle I try to add snakes
00:08 - and ladders but strangely yeah I try to
00:10 - add snakes and ladders to the board and
00:12 - figure out a good way to organize that
00:14 - and there'll be one more third part
00:16 - after this second part too
00:17 - now what I need to do is start adding
00:20 - some snakes and ladders so let's just
00:24 - add now how should be the other I guess
00:28 - there's a how should I configure I could
00:29 - make them random let me make some manual
00:31 - ones so what I'm gonna do is manually
00:33 - override the board to make some snakes
00:36 - and ladders so what I'm going to do and
00:39 - I will put it back to ten by ten in a
00:43 - second but this is a little simpler for
00:44 - me so if I go into here in the sketch
00:47 - where I'm making the board after I'm
00:51 - done making the board what I could do is
00:54 - I could just say something like tiles
00:56 - index six dot next equals one so this
01:05 - would be in a four by four board zero
01:10 - one two three four five six
01:12 - this would be a snake that would go down
01:17 - - OH - I have one whatever but let's
01:19 - make it aa this is confusing because the
01:22 - numbers I put here are not starting with
01:24 - zero so but the array index will counted
01:28 - zero so but you get the idea
01:29 - it's in whatever the index is is going
01:31 - to point to the other one so a couple
01:33 - things one is what I think that I would
01:35 - like to do so let's do this index six
01:37 - the next is one which is actually the
01:39 - second tile what I would like to do is a
01:40 - little bit goofy as I could just I could
01:43 - also just say tiles index six dots snake
01:47 - equals true so I could give it a
01:49 - property like snake equals true but I
01:52 - could also just kind of figure this out
01:54 - right because in the tile itself when
01:56 - I'm about to draw it I could say if this
02:01 - dot next does not is does not equal to
02:06 - this dot index plus one right if it's
02:09 - not if the next tile is not the one
02:11 - right after it then it has to be a
02:13 - so what I want to do is draw I want to
02:16 - do a good thing I have that um my Center
02:20 - my C equals get this dot get Center and
02:28 - next see these are very awkward variable
02:32 - names equals oh I I don't have access to
02:37 - the global variable tiles here but I
02:40 - could pass it in so when I say show when
02:45 - I draw them all this is very weird what
02:48 - I'm doing here I probably would want to
02:50 - refactor this later do it some different
02:52 - way I'm gonna pass tiles of the global
02:53 - variable so I could get access to it
02:55 - that way but I like the idea of passing
02:56 - it in just to sort of for sanity's sake
02:59 - I could say tiles this next dot get
03:04 - Center and then I could draw a line
03:07 - let's say stroke wait for stroke 255
03:15 - line from where my C 0 my C 1 next C why
03:24 - am i making these weird blames my Center
03:28 - next Center my Center 0 my Center 1 next
03:35 - Center 0 next Center 1 okay there look
03:44 - there's my snake now here's the thing is
03:48 - it actually working is it actually
03:50 - causing it to go down there if it ever
03:52 - lands on there I think it is because
03:54 - it's always going to where the next
03:55 - thing is and I don't really like I want
03:57 - to make a more interesting looking snake
03:59 - so let's pick a different tile like 9
04:05 - how about 10
04:06 - so it's a loose diagonal there we go
04:08 - okay so now let's slow this down a
04:11 - little bit frame rate 10 boy very hard
04:20 - for me to see if this is working right
04:21 - is it actually going to the next spot oh
04:25 - I don't think I actually
04:27 - holder's go to the next pot I would just
04:28 - tell two plus plus so let's take a look
04:31 - at that when the player moves
04:35 - oh it just moves the spot up but it
04:37 - can't do that anymore it can't do that
04:39 - anymore it has to examine its spot Oh
04:43 - weird so what it really should do is so
04:47 - we've to have the tiles here oh this is
04:49 - getting very awkward this is a very
04:52 - awkward game I'm making it's gonna have
04:54 - the tiles here and what it's going to do
04:57 - is in the player object it's going to
05:02 - take its spot and move up by this number
05:07 - and then it's going to say oh yeah this
05:13 - is why it would be nice for it to
05:14 - actually have a boolean variable as to
05:16 - whether because it's it's the act of
05:18 - landing on it so I need to check
05:20 - something when I land on it whether it
05:21 - should move to the next thing so you
05:23 - know what here's what I'm gonna do this
05:25 - in a different way I got an idea I've
05:28 - got an idea what I'm gonna do is I'm
05:31 - gonna make each tile next is kind of
05:36 - unnecessary I don't know I'm not sure
05:37 - exactly why I have that in there anymore
05:39 - but I'm gonna say this dots snake equals
05:43 - zero and this dot ladder equals zero so
05:47 - they all have a snake and ladder of zero
05:50 - zero means well no it could be this in
05:54 - this case there can never be a snake
05:56 - that takes you all the way back to the
05:57 - first spot so I'll have a snake and
05:59 - ladder of negative one all right
06:01 - negative one means no snake no ladder I
06:03 - could say false or something but anyway
06:05 - I'm gonna do that then in the sketch I'm
06:10 - not gonna override the next I'm just
06:12 - gonna say it's snake is one so now when
06:16 - I am when I am rendering the tile
06:23 - instead of checking the next thing which
06:26 - is kind of nuts I'm going to say if this
06:28 - dot snake is greater than zero I'm gonna
06:31 - draw that like ah but the next oh yeah
06:34 - and then I just go to the I draw the
06:36 - line from it to this dot snake it's
06:39 - greater than negative one
06:40 - or and maybe the well I'm gonna do these
06:45 - total is this silly I'm gonna do these
06:46 - as two separate if statements if this
06:49 - dot latter is greater than one and I
06:53 - could obviously condense these into one
06:55 - statement which I will eventually at
06:56 - some point in my life if this that
06:58 - latter is greater than one boo-yeah I'm
07:03 - still doing this project what I was it's
07:04 - like five o'clock ass this dot Ladder is
07:07 - greater than one then
07:11 - the ladders will be black alright so now
07:16 - let's take a look at this so I've still
07:19 - got the snake in there now what happens
07:21 - when the player rolls if the tile is
07:28 - tiles index this dot spot if this dot
07:34 - spot snake oh you know what I could do I
07:38 - could have this snake be a negative
07:40 - number and the zero means there's
07:43 - nothing this would be better let's do it
07:47 - a different way I got a better idea
07:48 - so by definition what should we call it
07:51 - snake ladder it's a snake either a snake
07:52 - or a ladder the tile spot the spot is
07:55 - right is it a snake snake or ladder
07:58 - they're all equal to zero
08:00 - it's a snake or ladder if it's equal to
08:02 - zero and when I create it I'm gonna say
08:10 - the snake or ladder is like negative
08:14 - five meaning go back five spots this is
08:17 - so much better so much better even
08:19 - though my variable names snicker it's
08:20 - got a terrible so now what I can do is
08:23 - in the tile hmm when I'm drawing it if
08:28 - snake or ladder is not equal to zero
08:34 - right then I've got to draw a line from
08:38 - this index plus okay so thus this snake
08:46 - for ladder that's it's the difference
08:49 - between where I am where I'm currently
08:50 - going to go back to and then I draw that
08:52 - line
08:54 - and then I don't need this whole second
08:56 - nonsense thing and then of course in the
08:59 - player if it lands if this snake or
09:02 - ladder does not equal is not zero then
09:07 - this dot spot plus equals that goes back
09:11 - to wherever it goes
09:12 - dare I say I have this now all right
09:16 - cannot read property get center of
09:18 - undefined player dodged ass line twenty
09:21 - three current get center tiles this dot
09:25 - spot yet you know I'm getting a great
09:28 - comment in the chat from Dennis who
09:31 - writes I don't need this I don't need
09:37 - this if statement because if it's zero
09:40 - it's just not gonna change oh this is
09:43 - probably the problem I must have messed
09:47 - this up somehow so this plus equals
09:51 - snake or letter let's look at console
09:53 - dot log this dot spot this seems like
09:56 - it's the problem console dot log this
09:58 - snake or ladder it's probably my
10:00 - variable name it's the problem undefined
10:03 - so why is this undefined oh because it's
10:06 - not this it is the tile it is the tiles
10:10 - maker ladder of course the player is at
10:12 - a spot the tile is telling it where to
10:14 - go and by the way people were telling me
10:16 - this in the chat so I think I'm gonna
10:19 - try to feel confident that that's gonna
10:21 - fix it now and now get Center player
10:26 - twenty undefined no problem no problem o
10:29 - tile I didn't actually fix it weirdly
10:31 - enough okay let's try this again alright
10:36 - so oh you I see because the reason why I
10:39 - need a move is because I want to draw it
10:42 - there and then I want to draw it the
10:44 - next like I want to see it land there
10:46 - and see it go down like animation wise I
10:48 - kind of want to see it land there and go
10:49 - down okay
10:50 - first of all why did this happen player
10:51 - das line ten so if I got if I'm off the
10:56 - board here so what I what I do need to
10:59 - say is I do need this though if tile
11:02 - exists so as long as there is a tile
11:04 - there that'll fix that
11:07 - I could I kind of would like to at some
11:11 - point do something where it lands there
11:12 - and then animates going to the next step
11:14 - but I'm gonna like skip worrying about
11:17 - that right now I'm just going to this is
11:21 - working right you can see that it's
11:23 - taking me an average of about 12 now
11:25 - with this one little blip now what I can
11:27 - do so first of all I want those ladders
11:29 - to be a different color so what I'm
11:32 - gonna do here in the tile is if that
11:39 - this is going to be stroke or if this
11:42 - would actually work
11:43 - 255 I well I can do one of those what
11:46 - are those things call those fancy little
11:47 - if statements you do in one space here
11:50 - what is called again somebody tell me
11:52 - what's that what could I never remember
11:55 - that I don't use them I'm just gonna say
11:57 - I'm gonna do my own nice little way of
11:59 - doing this in a really ridiculous way if
12:02 - this maker ladder is less than zero then
12:05 - it's going to be that is a snake
12:07 - otherwise it is a ladder okay so let's
12:11 - look at this now what I'm going to do is
12:13 - I'm going to configure in this main
12:16 - sketch a couple more of these oh let's
12:20 - make it let's make it let's make it 10
12:23 - by 10 where do I do that again I change
12:27 - the resolution to 40 and now I've got a
12:31 - lot of stuff to work with I've got a
12:32 - hundred tiles so what I'm gonna do
12:35 - actually I'm gonna just pick make some
12:36 - randomly because I kind of wanna I don't
12:38 - want to figure it out so I'm gonna just
12:39 - may say let a equal 0 is less than 5 I'm
12:43 - gonna have five snakes and five ladders
12:49 - and I could so I'm gonna pick I'm gonna
12:56 - pick a random tile and I'm gonna say
12:59 - tile dot snakes or letter equals a
13:04 - random negative number between negative
13:07 - 10 and negative negative 1 this is tear
13:11 - down I could have a serious problem here
13:13 - but I'm not gonna worry about it just
13:14 - yet then
13:16 - I'm gonna do this between 1 and tendon
13:22 - actually it doesn't make sense for his
13:23 - ladder to go horizontally it's got to go
13:25 - on to a different row if I'm picking
13:28 - them randomly it doesn't make sense for
13:30 - any of the snakes to be in the first row
13:33 - and any of the ladders to be in the last
13:34 - row all right so I should probably
13:36 - account for that so I can't just pick a
13:40 - random tile like I want to do this well
13:43 - but I also want to do it quickly and not
13:45 - worry about it
13:46 - but let's let's be thoughtful about this
13:48 - so random I guess I have to pick an
13:51 - index so I want to pick there's a
13:54 - certain number of qov there's a certain
13:57 - number of columns so I can say I want to
14:01 - pick a random where am i doing that I
14:03 - want to pick a random index between for
14:09 - a snake it can't be in the bottom so it
14:12 - has to be the first one would be columns
14:15 - two tiles dot length so that's a random
14:19 - index and then that in debt that would
14:24 - get a random amount whoops what is that
14:27 - that would get a random negative number
14:30 - and it should be them by minimum it has
14:34 - to be the number right it's got to go be
14:36 - at least the number of kala good you
14:42 - know if it's kind of earlier in the
14:43 - thing it could point down I don't know I
14:46 - just make it in between columns and oh
14:51 - and then all the way back to oh the
14:54 - difference between what's the Mac okay
14:55 - let's figure this out this is worth
14:57 - doing nuts okay let's say I pick this
15:03 - here the only valid places that I would
15:07 - have a snake going to this would be the
15:09 - first one and this would be the last one
15:13 - so the range is between its index - well
15:24 - it depends on which torretta its index -
15:27 - oh there's got to be some nice man
15:29 - for this this is four by four the number
15:33 - of columns modulus - yeah yeah that's
15:36 - always going to be the case
15:37 - the number of columns not the number
15:41 - column that it's indexed module sorry
15:43 - sorry it's Index - its index modulus the
15:49 - number of columns so that's gonna get me
15:51 - at a minimum here and then the bottom is
15:55 - just you know I don't want anything to
15:57 - be able to go past so so that's where it
16:02 - can be oh oh so they I don't know I I
16:04 - don't need so I could just pick the
16:08 - range between index modulus columns
16:12 - that's - - that's the smallest amount
16:16 - and but not the smallest it's a bit
16:19 - largest amount in the case of negative
16:20 - numbers and then - all the way to the
16:23 - bottom would be itself
16:29 - itself - one itself - one index minus
16:32 - one so this should work but this is that
16:35 - okay I think there's a word for taking
16:38 - random ones so this is going to be a
16:41 - random number between what did I say it
16:45 - was between it's negative its index plus
16:52 - one I'm actually gonna just you know
16:54 - what I'm going to do this is so silly
16:56 - I'll just make this negative one this is
16:59 - gonna allow me to understand the range
17:00 - much more easily index modulus columns
17:04 - and then index minus one so that is that
17:10 - is for a snake and I don't feel like
17:14 - doing two of these so I'm just going to
17:16 - say I'm gonna I'm gonna do 10 and if I
17:23 - modulus 2 equals 0 then D I owe this is
17:29 - a I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna say
17:32 - let Direction equal 1 otherwise
17:34 - Direction equals negative 1 because the
17:36 - numbers should work out the same way in
17:37 - terms of going to the top no they don't
17:41 - work they don't
17:42 - work the same way in terms of going to
17:43 - the top because if I need to go to the
17:46 - top I've got to subtract the length not
17:48 - zero so there's a lot more options to go
17:50 - to the top designed the board I should
17:55 - just say I was gonna hard-code the
17:57 - numbers all right let's do this let's do
17:59 - this so this is going to be the rate
18:03 - let's just do some snakes let's just see
18:06 - if we get some snakes
18:07 - okay index is not defined sketch J s
18:09 - line forty oh what am I doing here I
18:13 - have to pick a random index whoa
18:19 - I lost completely lost where I was first
18:22 - I'm picking a random tile so first I
18:26 - want to pick a tile index which is a I
18:31 - had that in here already which is from
18:34 - the second row columns all the way to
18:37 - the end a random number or it's good
18:48 - okay it's gonna be okay everybody that's
18:50 - the index and then where I've got oh boy
18:56 - and that oh wait there are two lines of
18:58 - code there that's what's going on here
19:00 - and then oh my goodness this that
19:07 - particular tile is this random thing why
19:13 - why why is it Auto formatting this up
19:16 - here what have I done wrong random there
19:21 - we go okay so this is the index right
19:24 - I'm picking some random tile by the way
19:26 - I could pick the same tile twice which
19:29 - is a real problem I've got it I've got
19:30 - to deal with that this was a terrible
19:32 - idea
19:32 - oh my goodness a terrible idea then it's
19:35 - snakes or ladder number is some random
19:38 - amount a little bit back all the way to
19:40 - the bottom okay let's see this
19:42 - unexpected token line 43 because I have
19:46 - extra extra brackets okay all right I
19:50 - don't see doesn't look like it picked
19:53 - Danny
19:55 - okay well but it is or am I just not
19:59 - seeing them
20:00 - oh it's is it going down and wait so
20:02 - hold on so let's take a look at console
20:07 - dot log tiles index snakes or a ladder I
20:15 - should have thought about this okay so
20:20 - we got this one oh there's like I put in
20:23 - multiple variables sometimes I say snake
20:25 - or ladder is sometimes I say snakes or
20:27 - letters that is really bad okay so a
20:33 - snake or ladder I think that's what I
20:35 - meant to do I think that's the brothels
20:39 - there we go look look we've got two
20:42 - there there are three snakes one goes
20:45 - from here to there one goes from here to
20:47 - there and one goes from there to here
20:48 - right so we're having trouble getting to
20:51 - the top does it keeps wow it's really
20:54 - good at landing on that one oh it made
20:56 - it past it oh boy
20:58 - well this is exciting though it's
21:00 - actually kind of working all right so my
21:03 - design is horrific first of all one
21:06 - thing I really need to do is when I draw
21:08 - the tiles I need to say when I draw the
21:12 - rectangle I need to say no stroke those
21:16 - I don't make this is much more clear
21:18 - okay so a couple things I should do I'm
21:19 - not gonna
21:20 - I really should make it so I can't pick
21:21 - the same one twice but since I only made
21:23 - three that's not that big of a deal this
21:25 - is actually working
21:26 - Frank amazingly now I'm gonna go back to
21:29 - the sketch and let me pick three ladders
21:33 - so the ladders would be anywhere from
21:37 - right the ladders would be anywhere from
21:40 - the very top oh oh interesting no
21:47 - there's no ladder on the top anywhere
21:49 - from the second row all the way to the
21:51 - bottom so I need to pick an index that
21:54 - goes all the way from 0 to the length
21:57 - minus columns and then I'm going to go
22:01 - up a certain amount so if I were here
22:06 - I'm going to take
22:09 - this you know it's actually columns -
22:16 - index modulus columns oh no that's fine
22:21 - that's fine
22:22 - because yeah because I I want to know
22:24 - how many up to there so to always go to
22:26 - another row I'll take that instead I'll
22:29 - go up by this much and then the limit is
22:32 - I can only go up by you know - laughs
22:34 - maybe they the second-to-last spot okay
22:37 - so now I'm going to make some random
22:40 - ones where I'm going to pick a random
22:42 - index so I've got to go from the zero I
22:47 - did that already
22:48 - and then I could go up by columns
22:52 - - index mod columns and then all the way
22:57 - up to tiles lengths - where I am - one I
23:05 - think that makes sense all right so
23:07 - let's see now if I can get a bunch of
23:09 - ladders there there's a bunch of layers
23:10 - now interestingly enough because of the
23:12 - order I've drawing stuff the ladders get
23:14 - covered over so I should definitely fix
23:17 - that let's see here
23:20 - I've got it I should probably do a pass
23:23 - the tile let me do let me do let me do a
23:31 - this show function it will be by itself
23:34 - and then I'll do show snakes ladders and
23:38 - I'll do all this stuff in there so that
23:41 - I can do that afterwards oh okay
23:44 - so in the so I can do that as a separate
23:46 - loop and so here when I'm when I where
23:50 - am i showing all the tiles here can do
23:53 - this and then I can do tiles that show
23:56 - snakes ladders there we go now here's
24:03 - the thing the question is is this
24:06 - actually I don't can't tell if the
24:08 - ladders are working can anyone see if
24:10 - the ladders are working
24:15 - is it skipping stuff if it lands on a
24:17 - ladder yeah it did it just went up
24:20 - didn't it just go up there I'm pretty
24:22 - sure it did I'm pretty sure it did yeah
24:25 - and this is pretty bad where I'm you can
24:28 - get flee get some very unlucky things so
24:30 - interestingly enough right let's just
24:32 - for the sake of argument very quickly
24:34 - I'm gonna I'm gonna run fast again so
24:36 - I'm gonna go back to the sketch if you
24:38 - were really done here I'm gonna take out
24:39 - this slower framerate I'm gonna take out
24:42 - adding any snakes and ladders and I'm
24:45 - gonna run this really fast so the
24:49 - average should be and I by the way I
24:51 - should be allowed to roll us let's let's
24:52 - make it a six-sided die I don't know
24:54 - what what it actually is but let's look
24:56 - in the role let's say you can roll a 1
24:59 - through 6 which actually would be a 1
25:02 - through 7 if I'm flooring it I guess I
25:05 - could round it I could do 0 through 6
25:07 - and round it with a X to work no no
25:09 - because then I could get a 0 anyway so
25:11 - let's do this so that it can roll a bit
25:13 - more so we could see the average amount
25:16 - is around 30 does that make sense
25:20 - it's a hundred yeah I I'm gonna have to
25:23 - just assume that makes sense that an
25:25 - average it's gonna take about 30 rolls
25:28 - and it seemed to be doing a little bit
25:29 - better right now so now let's add in
25:31 - those snakes and ladders oh I look
25:36 - forward to all the much better versions
25:37 - you all make of this and there we go
25:40 - this looks terrible
25:42 - well those ladders are really helping
25:44 - out alright so that wraps up the second
25:46 - part there there's one more part you can
25:48 - check this video's description for a
25:49 - link to this last part so you might have
25:51 - noticed it's really hard to tell is this
25:52 - thing even working like what's going on
25:54 - so in the next part I try to think about
25:56 - the state of the game what's happening
25:58 - and what do I want to draw to indicate
26:00 - what's happened to give me a little bit
26:01 - of more of a debug view ultimately in
26:03 - the end you want to really animate for
26:05 - the user to understand and enjoy the
26:06 - game but I'm really just right now
26:08 - trying to get it to make sense for me so
26:10 - that's good what's gonna happen in the
26:11 - third part
26:15 - [Music]
26:20 - you

Cleaned transcript:

all right welcome to part 2 of my snakes and ladders challenge in this part where I really struggle I try to add snakes and ladders but strangely yeah I try to add snakes and ladders to the board and figure out a good way to organize that and there'll be one more third part after this second part too now what I need to do is start adding some snakes and ladders so let's just add now how should be the other I guess there's a how should I configure I could make them random let me make some manual ones so what I'm gonna do is manually override the board to make some snakes and ladders so what I'm going to do and I will put it back to ten by ten in a second but this is a little simpler for me so if I go into here in the sketch where I'm making the board after I'm done making the board what I could do is I could just say something like tiles index six dot next equals one so this would be in a four by four board zero one two three four five six this would be a snake that would go down OH I have one whatever but let's make it aa this is confusing because the numbers I put here are not starting with zero so but the array index will counted zero so but you get the idea it's in whatever the index is is going to point to the other one so a couple things one is what I think that I would like to do so let's do this index six the next is one which is actually the second tile what I would like to do is a little bit goofy as I could just I could also just say tiles index six dots snake equals true so I could give it a property like snake equals true but I could also just kind of figure this out right because in the tile itself when I'm about to draw it I could say if this dot next does not is does not equal to this dot index plus one right if it's not if the next tile is not the one right after it then it has to be a so what I want to do is draw I want to do a good thing I have that um my Center my C equals get this dot get Center and next see these are very awkward variable names equals oh I I don't have access to the global variable tiles here but I could pass it in so when I say show when I draw them all this is very weird what I'm doing here I probably would want to refactor this later do it some different way I'm gonna pass tiles of the global variable so I could get access to it that way but I like the idea of passing it in just to sort of for sanity's sake I could say tiles this next dot get Center and then I could draw a line let's say stroke wait for stroke 255 line from where my C 0 my C 1 next C why am i making these weird blames my Center next Center my Center 0 my Center 1 next Center 0 next Center 1 okay there look there's my snake now here's the thing is it actually working is it actually causing it to go down there if it ever lands on there I think it is because it's always going to where the next thing is and I don't really like I want to make a more interesting looking snake so let's pick a different tile like 9 how about 10 so it's a loose diagonal there we go okay so now let's slow this down a little bit frame rate 10 boy very hard for me to see if this is working right is it actually going to the next spot oh I don't think I actually holder's go to the next pot I would just tell two plus plus so let's take a look at that when the player moves oh it just moves the spot up but it can't do that anymore it can't do that anymore it has to examine its spot Oh weird so what it really should do is so we've to have the tiles here oh this is getting very awkward this is a very awkward game I'm making it's gonna have the tiles here and what it's going to do is in the player object it's going to take its spot and move up by this number and then it's going to say oh yeah this is why it would be nice for it to actually have a boolean variable as to whether because it's it's the act of landing on it so I need to check something when I land on it whether it should move to the next thing so you know what here's what I'm gonna do this in a different way I got an idea I've got an idea what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make each tile next is kind of unnecessary I don't know I'm not sure exactly why I have that in there anymore but I'm gonna say this dots snake equals zero and this dot ladder equals zero so they all have a snake and ladder of zero zero means well no it could be this in this case there can never be a snake that takes you all the way back to the first spot so I'll have a snake and ladder of negative one all right negative one means no snake no ladder I could say false or something but anyway I'm gonna do that then in the sketch I'm not gonna override the next I'm just gonna say it's snake is one so now when I am when I am rendering the tile instead of checking the next thing which is kind of nuts I'm going to say if this dot snake is greater than zero I'm gonna draw that like ah but the next oh yeah and then I just go to the I draw the line from it to this dot snake it's greater than negative one or and maybe the well I'm gonna do these total is this silly I'm gonna do these as two separate if statements if this dot latter is greater than one and I could obviously condense these into one statement which I will eventually at some point in my life if this that latter is greater than one booyeah I'm still doing this project what I was it's like five o'clock ass this dot Ladder is greater than one then the ladders will be black alright so now let's take a look at this so I've still got the snake in there now what happens when the player rolls if the tile is tiles index this dot spot if this dot spot snake oh you know what I could do I could have this snake be a negative number and the zero means there's nothing this would be better let's do it a different way I got a better idea so by definition what should we call it snake ladder it's a snake either a snake or a ladder the tile spot the spot is right is it a snake snake or ladder they're all equal to zero it's a snake or ladder if it's equal to zero and when I create it I'm gonna say the snake or ladder is like negative five meaning go back five spots this is so much better so much better even though my variable names snicker it's got a terrible so now what I can do is in the tile hmm when I'm drawing it if snake or ladder is not equal to zero right then I've got to draw a line from this index plus okay so thus this snake for ladder that's it's the difference between where I am where I'm currently going to go back to and then I draw that line and then I don't need this whole second nonsense thing and then of course in the player if it lands if this snake or ladder does not equal is not zero then this dot spot plus equals that goes back to wherever it goes dare I say I have this now all right cannot read property get center of undefined player dodged ass line twenty three current get center tiles this dot spot yet you know I'm getting a great comment in the chat from Dennis who writes I don't need this I don't need this if statement because if it's zero it's just not gonna change oh this is probably the problem I must have messed this up somehow so this plus equals snake or letter let's look at console dot log this dot spot this seems like it's the problem console dot log this snake or ladder it's probably my variable name it's the problem undefined so why is this undefined oh because it's not this it is the tile it is the tiles maker ladder of course the player is at a spot the tile is telling it where to go and by the way people were telling me this in the chat so I think I'm gonna try to feel confident that that's gonna fix it now and now get Center player twenty undefined no problem no problem o tile I didn't actually fix it weirdly enough okay let's try this again alright so oh you I see because the reason why I need a move is because I want to draw it there and then I want to draw it the next like I want to see it land there and see it go down like animation wise I kind of want to see it land there and go down okay first of all why did this happen player das line ten so if I got if I'm off the board here so what I what I do need to say is I do need this though if tile exists so as long as there is a tile there that'll fix that I could I kind of would like to at some point do something where it lands there and then animates going to the next step but I'm gonna like skip worrying about that right now I'm just going to this is working right you can see that it's taking me an average of about 12 now with this one little blip now what I can do so first of all I want those ladders to be a different color so what I'm gonna do here in the tile is if that this is going to be stroke or if this would actually work 255 I well I can do one of those what are those things call those fancy little if statements you do in one space here what is called again somebody tell me what's that what could I never remember that I don't use them I'm just gonna say I'm gonna do my own nice little way of doing this in a really ridiculous way if this maker ladder is less than zero then it's going to be that is a snake otherwise it is a ladder okay so let's look at this now what I'm going to do is I'm going to configure in this main sketch a couple more of these oh let's make it let's make it let's make it 10 by 10 where do I do that again I change the resolution to 40 and now I've got a lot of stuff to work with I've got a hundred tiles so what I'm gonna do actually I'm gonna just pick make some randomly because I kind of wanna I don't want to figure it out so I'm gonna just may say let a equal 0 is less than 5 I'm gonna have five snakes and five ladders and I could so I'm gonna pick I'm gonna pick a random tile and I'm gonna say tile dot snakes or letter equals a random negative number between negative 10 and negative negative 1 this is tear down I could have a serious problem here but I'm not gonna worry about it just yet then I'm gonna do this between 1 and tendon actually it doesn't make sense for his ladder to go horizontally it's got to go on to a different row if I'm picking them randomly it doesn't make sense for any of the snakes to be in the first row and any of the ladders to be in the last row all right so I should probably account for that so I can't just pick a random tile like I want to do this well but I also want to do it quickly and not worry about it but let's let's be thoughtful about this so random I guess I have to pick an index so I want to pick there's a certain number of qov there's a certain number of columns so I can say I want to pick a random where am i doing that I want to pick a random index between for a snake it can't be in the bottom so it has to be the first one would be columns two tiles dot length so that's a random index and then that in debt that would get a random amount whoops what is that that would get a random negative number and it should be them by minimum it has to be the number right it's got to go be at least the number of kala good you know if it's kind of earlier in the thing it could point down I don't know I just make it in between columns and oh and then all the way back to oh the difference between what's the Mac okay let's figure this out this is worth doing nuts okay let's say I pick this here the only valid places that I would have a snake going to this would be the first one and this would be the last one so the range is between its index well it depends on which torretta its index oh there's got to be some nice man for this this is four by four the number of columns modulus yeah yeah that's always going to be the case the number of columns not the number column that it's indexed module sorry sorry it's Index its index modulus the number of columns so that's gonna get me at a minimum here and then the bottom is just you know I don't want anything to be able to go past so so that's where it can be oh oh so they I don't know I I don't need so I could just pick the range between index modulus columns that's that's the smallest amount and but not the smallest it's a bit largest amount in the case of negative numbers and then all the way to the bottom would be itself itself one itself one index minus one so this should work but this is that okay I think there's a word for taking random ones so this is going to be a random number between what did I say it was between it's negative its index plus one I'm actually gonna just you know what I'm going to do this is so silly I'll just make this negative one this is gonna allow me to understand the range much more easily index modulus columns and then index minus one so that is that is for a snake and I don't feel like doing two of these so I'm just going to say I'm gonna I'm gonna do 10 and if I modulus 2 equals 0 then D I owe this is a I'm gonna I'm gonna say I'm gonna say let Direction equal 1 otherwise Direction equals negative 1 because the numbers should work out the same way in terms of going to the top no they don't work they don't work the same way in terms of going to the top because if I need to go to the top I've got to subtract the length not zero so there's a lot more options to go to the top designed the board I should just say I was gonna hardcode the numbers all right let's do this let's do this so this is going to be the rate let's just do some snakes let's just see if we get some snakes okay index is not defined sketch J s line forty oh what am I doing here I have to pick a random index whoa I lost completely lost where I was first I'm picking a random tile so first I want to pick a tile index which is a I had that in here already which is from the second row columns all the way to the end a random number or it's good okay it's gonna be okay everybody that's the index and then where I've got oh boy and that oh wait there are two lines of code there that's what's going on here and then oh my goodness this that particular tile is this random thing why why why is it Auto formatting this up here what have I done wrong random there we go okay so this is the index right I'm picking some random tile by the way I could pick the same tile twice which is a real problem I've got it I've got to deal with that this was a terrible idea oh my goodness a terrible idea then it's snakes or ladder number is some random amount a little bit back all the way to the bottom okay let's see this unexpected token line 43 because I have extra extra brackets okay all right I don't see doesn't look like it picked Danny okay well but it is or am I just not seeing them oh it's is it going down and wait so hold on so let's take a look at console dot log tiles index snakes or a ladder I should have thought about this okay so we got this one oh there's like I put in multiple variables sometimes I say snake or ladder is sometimes I say snakes or letters that is really bad okay so a snake or ladder I think that's what I meant to do I think that's the brothels there we go look look we've got two there there are three snakes one goes from here to there one goes from here to there and one goes from there to here right so we're having trouble getting to the top does it keeps wow it's really good at landing on that one oh it made it past it oh boy well this is exciting though it's actually kind of working all right so my design is horrific first of all one thing I really need to do is when I draw the tiles I need to say when I draw the rectangle I need to say no stroke those I don't make this is much more clear okay so a couple things I should do I'm not gonna I really should make it so I can't pick the same one twice but since I only made three that's not that big of a deal this is actually working Frank amazingly now I'm gonna go back to the sketch and let me pick three ladders so the ladders would be anywhere from right the ladders would be anywhere from the very top oh oh interesting no there's no ladder on the top anywhere from the second row all the way to the bottom so I need to pick an index that goes all the way from 0 to the length minus columns and then I'm going to go up a certain amount so if I were here I'm going to take this you know it's actually columns index modulus columns oh no that's fine that's fine because yeah because I I want to know how many up to there so to always go to another row I'll take that instead I'll go up by this much and then the limit is I can only go up by you know laughs maybe they the secondtolast spot okay so now I'm going to make some random ones where I'm going to pick a random index so I've got to go from the zero I did that already and then I could go up by columns index mod columns and then all the way up to tiles lengths where I am one I think that makes sense all right so let's see now if I can get a bunch of ladders there there's a bunch of layers now interestingly enough because of the order I've drawing stuff the ladders get covered over so I should definitely fix that let's see here I've got it I should probably do a pass the tile let me do let me do let me do a this show function it will be by itself and then I'll do show snakes ladders and I'll do all this stuff in there so that I can do that afterwards oh okay so in the so I can do that as a separate loop and so here when I'm when I where am i showing all the tiles here can do this and then I can do tiles that show snakes ladders there we go now here's the thing the question is is this actually I don't can't tell if the ladders are working can anyone see if the ladders are working is it skipping stuff if it lands on a ladder yeah it did it just went up didn't it just go up there I'm pretty sure it did I'm pretty sure it did yeah and this is pretty bad where I'm you can get flee get some very unlucky things so interestingly enough right let's just for the sake of argument very quickly I'm gonna I'm gonna run fast again so I'm gonna go back to the sketch if you were really done here I'm gonna take out this slower framerate I'm gonna take out adding any snakes and ladders and I'm gonna run this really fast so the average should be and I by the way I should be allowed to roll us let's let's make it a sixsided die I don't know what what it actually is but let's look in the role let's say you can roll a 1 through 6 which actually would be a 1 through 7 if I'm flooring it I guess I could round it I could do 0 through 6 and round it with a X to work no no because then I could get a 0 anyway so let's do this so that it can roll a bit more so we could see the average amount is around 30 does that make sense it's a hundred yeah I I'm gonna have to just assume that makes sense that an average it's gonna take about 30 rolls and it seemed to be doing a little bit better right now so now let's add in those snakes and ladders oh I look forward to all the much better versions you all make of this and there we go this looks terrible well those ladders are really helping out alright so that wraps up the second part there there's one more part you can check this video's description for a link to this last part so you might have noticed it's really hard to tell is this thing even working like what's going on so in the next part I try to think about the state of the game what's happening and what do I want to draw to indicate what's happened to give me a little bit of more of a debug view ultimately in the end you want to really animate for the user to understand and enjoy the game but I'm really just right now trying to get it to make sense for me so that's good what's gonna happen in the third part you
