00:00 - I'm very excited about this coding
00:02 - challenge this coding challenge is
00:04 - inspired by the book called 10 prints
00:06 - which is all about this line of code 10
00:10 - print chr dollar sign
00:12 - 205.50 m 1 go to 10 so this is a line of
00:17 - code for the commodore 64 and this book
00:19 - which is written by by a collaboration
00:23 - of many authors i'll put a link to
00:25 - information about this book the book is
00:26 - available for free as a PDF online I'm
00:28 - looking at the website right now and
00:31 - it's a beautiful book I have two copies
00:33 - of it downstairs I wish I had my one
00:35 - copy to hold up here right now but it
00:38 - really looks at the history of creative
00:40 - computing sort of through the lens of
00:42 - this one line of code for an old
00:43 - Commodore 64 computer so what does this
00:46 - line of code do so here's a nice youtube
00:48 - video I'll link to this as well I'm
00:50 - gonna make this full screen here where
00:51 - you can see it emulator now typing out
00:54 - this line of codes and let's see what we
00:56 - get
00:58 - run run it oh there we go look at this
01:00 - we get this interesting maze pattern so
01:02 - let me pause this for a second and let's
01:04 - try to figure out why is this happening
01:06 - so this is the basic programming
01:09 - language I think that's right that's
01:11 - actually one of the first programming
01:12 - languages I ever used when I was
01:14 - probably when I was in I think about
01:15 - third grade on an apple to see I think
01:17 - you remember back with basic programming
01:21 - language lines of code had a line number
01:23 - like the line 10 print says print
01:25 - something out to the screen to the
01:27 - is really just only a text console and
01:29 - then this is print the character either
01:32 - and I'm assuming here that the character
01:34 - 205 in ASCII code is a forward slash and
01:37 - the character 206 in ASCII code is a
01:40 - backward slash so randomly pick up would
01:43 - make this math problem between 2 or 5
01:46 - point 5 plus 1 I'm either gonna get 2 or
01:48 - 6 or 205 so print out either forward
01:51 - slash or back slash slash and then go to
01:52 - 10 so I want to recreate this and I'm
01:55 - not the there's examples already been
01:57 - made and processing I'm really just
01:59 - redoing what's already been done from
02:01 - the the publication of this book but I
02:03 - want to do it as a coding challenge and
02:04 - see what kind of creative possibilities
02:06 - emerge because you could diss system
02:09 - which has a shape Touche
02:11 - and probability think of what you could
02:14 - do if you change the way the probability
02:15 - works if you allow it to be controlled
02:17 - if you think about the shapes creatively
02:19 - now that we have canvas and the browser
02:21 - there's a lot of possibilities here
02:23 - so let me and again if I say anything
02:27 - wrong about the converse 64 basic and
02:30 - ASCII code
02:30 - oh sure somebody will correct me in the
02:32 - chat and then I'll come back at the end
02:33 - of this video and correct that ok so
02:35 - let's look let's I need to write a setup
02:38 - function and I'm gonna make a canvas
02:41 - that's 400 by 400 and I'm going to say
02:44 - background 0 just so we can see it
02:46 - easily and I'm going to go to the
02:48 - browser and I'm gonna unfold screen this
02:50 - and I'm gonna go here and now i have my
02:51 - canvas there we go
02:53 - so what do I want to do first let's
02:54 - figure out how do I draw a forward slash
02:59 - or a backward slash so I could draw it
03:02 - as a line line 0 0 10 10 this is I know
03:11 - that's like a backward slash like that
03:13 - right now I could say line now what do I
03:17 - want if I want to go from the bottom to
03:20 - the top like a forward slash I'm gonna
03:22 - go from 0 10 to 10 zero right forward
03:29 - slash now I've drawn them both there so
03:32 - now what I want to do is I want to say
03:33 - ah maybe how do i do probability so I've
03:39 - done this in a lot of videos and I'm
03:41 - just typing it out and I probably I so
03:43 - let's think about just type this out
03:44 - here this is a way of applying a
03:48 - probabilistic function
03:50 - I don't know so a good way to say it
03:51 - this is probability in my code because
03:53 - I'm gonna pick a random number between 0
03:55 - and 1 half the time it's gonna be
03:57 - greater than 0.5 half the time it's
03:59 - gonna be less than 0.5 so half the time
04:01 - we learn to draw a backward slash half
04:03 - the time I'm going to draw a forward
04:04 - slash now of course it's just doing this
04:08 - over and over again in the same space on
04:10 - top of each other so what I want to do
04:11 - is move forward as if I were a console
04:14 - printing out forward slash backward
04:15 - slash so what I need is some global
04:18 - variables like let X equal 0 let y equal
04:22 - 0 so I'm gonna draw these at X
04:25 - why X + 10 y + 10 I could use a
04:29 - translate or something but let me just
04:32 - do it with offsets at y plus 10 sorry
04:36 - and X + 10 + y so just to make sure it's
04:40 - still sort of the same thing but now
04:42 - what could I what do I need to do what
04:44 - if I increase X x equals x plus 10 so
04:49 - every frame I'm gonna move to the next
04:51 - spot there we go
04:53 - one line now it's hard to see that all
04:54 - the way across one line all the way
04:56 - across and uh I lost my train of thought
05:02 - oh you know what's important here I
05:04 - should think of the ten as some sort of
05:06 - like spate I'm gonna call that spacing
05:08 - so because we might want to change that
05:11 - so I should really use a variable for
05:13 - that and then if X gets to the end if
05:17 - it's greater than width I should reset X
05:20 - back to zero and have Y increased by
05:23 - spacing so let's look at that there we
05:27 - go I now have ten print in p5.js in the
05:32 - chat I just was told I left the ten here
05:34 - by accident so let me fix that so now
05:37 - here's the thing what's kind of amazing
05:39 - is that simple code created this
05:43 - suddenly quite elaborate beautiful maize
05:46 - pattern and I've you know thank you to
05:49 - the authors of the ten print book for
05:51 - inspiring me when the book came out to
05:54 - like really try this and use this in my
05:56 - teaching I often give this as an
05:58 - assignment to look at the book and try
06:00 - to like invent your own ten print design
06:02 - so how would you invent your own ten
06:04 - print design well what are the
06:06 - parameters of the system one thing is
06:07 - just the spacing so you know I can make
06:09 - space thing equal fifty and that's gonna
06:12 - change things quite a bit
06:13 - let me put it back at twenty just so we
06:16 - can sort of see it a little bit bigger
06:17 - and moves a little bit more quickly but
06:19 - one thing I could do is change the
06:20 - probability so what if I say you know
06:22 - what there's a 90% chance of drawing a
06:26 - backward slash or a forward slash I
06:28 - don't know which ones which a 10% of the
06:30 - other one now we get a pattern that has
06:33 - a certain quality to it because almost
06:34 - all the slashes are back slashes except
06:36 - for every once in a while
06:37 - forward-slash that probability could be
06:40 - adjusted with a slider over time I could
06:42 - also think about color you know the
06:44 - other thing here is like what if I just
06:46 - did something like draw a rectangle or
06:54 - not you know even just this idea of each
06:59 - cell on this grid either placing a
07:01 - rectangle there or not I've already got
07:03 - some type of generative comps so this is
07:06 - really what I guess what this is is this
07:07 - is an example of computational designer
07:09 - procedural design I have an algorithm
07:12 - that specifies the design you have Salda
07:14 - width wall drawings I'll try to put some
07:15 - linked links to information about the
07:18 - artist Sol LeWitt and his wall drawings
07:20 - is a nice example of this the rules are
07:22 - generating the design and that design
07:23 - could be the same every time but with
07:25 - probability it could be different every
07:26 - time so I hope I don't want to go much
07:29 - further with this and change too much
07:31 - more because I would like to see what
07:33 - you do and you could also think by the
07:36 - way you could other thing you could
07:37 - change is the way that I'm drawing this
07:39 - is I'm animating at one line at a time
07:40 - without changing the background but you
07:42 - could think about displaying it all at
07:44 - once or animating it in a different way
07:45 - from the center so there's a lot of
07:48 - possibilities there too so I hope that
07:50 - you will create your own 10 print design
07:52 - you will share it with me on Twitter or
07:55 - in the comments and then you can also
07:56 - submit it as a pull request to the
07:59 - readme file that's associated with this
08:00 - sketches code and I'll include a link to
08:02 - that also in this video's description so
08:05 - hold on one second did I mess anything
08:07 - up about my Commodore 64 and explaining
08:10 - the basic programming language important
08:12 - important correction it turns out that
08:15 - the Commodore 64 did not use the ASCII
08:17 - table as we know it today it has its own
08:20 - character set that's why because the
08:21 - ASCII code for a backslash is like 42 or
08:23 - 92 or 97 that's not that you I could
08:26 - look it up in an ASCII table but it
08:28 - doesn't match 205 and 206 so I did get
08:30 - that wrong in my earlier explanation I'm
08:32 - singing the chance the extended ASCII
08:33 - table so I didn't see any other
08:35 - Corrections I think I mostly got
08:36 - everything else right in this video and
08:38 - so please share with me your 10 print
08:40 - designs check out the book ten print
08:42 - thank the authors of the book for the
08:44 - great work that they did to talk about
08:47 - the history of this line of code and how
08:48 - it relates to creative
08:49 - code computing composing goodbye and
08:53 - I'll see you in another coding challenge
08:54 - Thanks

Cleaned transcript:

I'm very excited about this coding challenge this coding challenge is inspired by the book called 10 prints which is all about this line of code 10 print chr dollar sign 205.50 m 1 go to 10 so this is a line of code for the commodore 64 and this book which is written by by a collaboration of many authors i'll put a link to information about this book the book is available for free as a PDF online I'm looking at the website right now and it's a beautiful book I have two copies of it downstairs I wish I had my one copy to hold up here right now but it really looks at the history of creative computing sort of through the lens of this one line of code for an old Commodore 64 computer so what does this line of code do so here's a nice youtube video I'll link to this as well I'm gonna make this full screen here where you can see it emulator now typing out this line of codes and let's see what we get run run it oh there we go look at this we get this interesting maze pattern so let me pause this for a second and let's try to figure out why is this happening so this is the basic programming language I think that's right that's actually one of the first programming languages I ever

forward slash or back slash slash and then go to 10 so I want to recreate this and I'm not the there's examples already been made and processing I'm really just redoing what's already been done from

think of what you could do if you change the way the probability works if you allow it to be controlled if you think about the shapes creatively now that we have canvas and the browser there's a lot of possibilities here so let me and again if I say anything wrong about the converse 64 basic and ASCII code oh sure somebody will correct me in the chat and then I'll come back at the end of this video and correct that ok so let's look let's I need to write a setup function and I'm gonna make a canvas that's 400 by 400 and I'm going to say background 0 just so we can see it easily and I'm going to go to the browser and I'm gonna unfold screen this and I'm gonna go here and now i have my canvas there we go so what do I want to do first let's figure out how do I draw a forward slash or a backward slash so I could draw it as a line line 0 0 10 10 this is I know that's like a backward slash like that right now I could say line now what do I want if I want to go from the bottom to the top like a forward slash I'm gonna go from 0 10 to 10 zero right forward slash now I've drawn them both there so now what I want to do is I want to say ah maybe how do i do probability so I've done

to draw a backward slash half the time I'm going to draw a forward slash now of course it's just doing this over and over again in the same space on top of each other so what I want to do is move forward as if I were a console printing out forward slash backward slash so what I need is some global variables like let X equal 0 let y equal 0 so I'm gonna draw these at X why X + 10 y + 10 I could use a translate or something but let me just do it with offsets at y plus 10 sorry and X + 10 + y so just to make sure it's still sort of the same thing but now what could I what do I need to do what
