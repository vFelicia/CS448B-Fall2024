00:00 - hello I'm here I am here mostly to
00:03 - apologize please stop don't throw the
00:04 - tomatoes the green wall will have
00:07 - Tomatoes flats on them but I'm here just
00:09 - to give a quick update about the my
00:11 - machine learning videos that I have a
00:13 - playlist called ten neural networks -
00:16 - the nature of code I was making these
00:18 - videos over the summer then I had this
00:20 - moment where I was like riding along on
00:22 - a bicycle and I was thinking way too
00:23 - much about machine learning I had a bump
00:25 - fell over I broke my elbow I had surgery
00:29 - on it twice I lost a couple months of
00:31 - like being able to make content and then
00:33 - the fall started so unfortunately I was
00:36 - in the middle of this series I was at
00:39 - ten point seven I had made seven videos
00:41 - that's crazy and every time I upload a
00:43 - video now comments asking could I please
00:46 - continue that series and I am planning
00:48 - to continue it what I do here on the
00:51 - coding train is I make videos about
00:57 - stuff that I'm currently teaching at my
01:00 - full-time job here at New York
01:01 - University and currently what I'm
01:03 - teaching is an introduction to
01:04 - programming course and of course about
01:06 - text analysis so I am going to be making
01:09 - some videos about chatbots which is kind
01:11 - of adjacent to a machine learning can be
01:14 - a tool to drive a chatbot I'm also gonna
01:17 - make some videos about hopefully long
01:19 - term short long short term I can't
01:22 - remember I don't have long or short term
01:23 - memory but some of these recurrent
01:26 - neural networks for text generation and
01:28 - then I my hope is that I will be coming
01:29 - back to this playlist again after this
01:32 - semester is over or towards the end of
01:34 - the semester if I finished up some of
01:36 - the content so in the meantime I hope to
01:40 - continue to have some github
01:41 - repositories where I'm gonna be making
01:43 - some new examples so stay in touch with
01:45 - me on Twitter and I would recommend to
01:47 - you well as you've seen as a guest on my
01:50 - channel Suraj has a channel about deep
01:53 - learning and also this is a new video
01:54 - that just came out from one of my
01:56 - favorite channels three blue one Brown
01:59 - but what is a neural network deep
02:01 - learning part one so now we have an
02:03 - internet competition we'll deep learning
02:06 - part to come out before
02:11 - 10.8 the answer is almost a definite yes
02:15 - so please write all of your complaints
02:18 - in the comments here I'm going to read
02:19 - them I'm going to sit with some sort of
02:22 - like meditative cucumber eye mask thing
02:25 - on and I'm going to listen to all of
02:27 - your feedback about why I should do this
02:28 - right now instead of the other stuff
02:30 - that I'm doing now and then I will feel
02:32 - guilty for a while and then eventually
02:33 - these videos will come out okay so
02:35 - thanks for watching this short little
02:37 - video explanation and I'll see you soon
02:45 - [Music]
