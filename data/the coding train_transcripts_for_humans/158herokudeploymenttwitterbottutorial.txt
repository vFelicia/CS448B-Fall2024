With timestamps:

00:00 - hello in this video I am going to look
00:02 - at how to deploy your Bot written in
00:04 - node.js
00:05 - to uh a server and that server being one
00:07 - that runs on a service called Heroku so
00:10 - let's take a look at the pieces so you
00:11 - can see here I have my browser open to
00:14 - my test account A2Z ITP which uh I most
00:18 - recently just tweeted a bot tweeted a
00:20 - random number 39 and I have the code for
00:24 - that bot open right here you can see it
00:25 - in Sublime it's very simple it has a
00:27 - single function that tweets that random
00:29 - number number uh and then I also have my
00:33 - terminal open to that directory and I
00:35 - could just really quickly test to make
00:37 - sure that bot works the bot is starting
00:40 - it worked let's go back to the browser
00:42 - I'm going to hit refresh and we can see
00:44 - now I got random number four so
00:47 - everything is working the point is in
00:49 - this video is I want to say this bot
00:52 - that's running right over here I don't
00:54 - want to run it from my laptop I want it
00:56 - to run autonomously on a server
00:57 - somewhere that I can set it to go and
00:59 - never think about it again so let's
01:01 - tweet it again let's quit it um and look
01:04 - at how we can do that so the site that
01:06 - I'm the the service that I'm going to
01:07 - use in this particular video is Heroku
01:10 - so um you'll need an account so you know
01:13 - if you're watching this video and you
01:14 - don't have a Heroku account go to uh
01:17 - Heroku
01:18 - dcom Heroku spelled this way.com
01:24 - and you can see here I went there now
01:27 - now I'm already logged in so it went
01:29 - straight to my my dashboard and you can
01:32 - see that I have all these things already
01:34 - listed on my dashboard because
01:36 - apparently I've tried to make a variety
01:38 - of I've tried to do this a whole bunch
01:40 - of times test this test that delete soon
01:42 - Etc so what are these things these
01:44 - things are referred to as
01:47 - dinos I think that's right not dinos D
01:50 - NS dinos Dy NS like a dynamic thing
01:54 - that's running it's a process that
01:55 - you're running so what I need to do is
01:57 - create a dyo
02:00 - to run my bot so the very first thing
02:03 - that I'm going to do is go up here to
02:05 - this plus sign up in the top right and
02:08 - I'm going to say create new app so app
02:10 - is really what I'm doing I'm going to
02:12 - create an app I'm going to call it uh
02:15 - coding rainbow uh
02:18 - demo uh should only contain lowercase
02:21 - letters okay rainbow demo uh it is
02:25 - available I'm going to create
02:27 - it and it is now there so there's a
02:31 - whole bunch of things I need to do here
02:33 - and one of the things about using Heroku
02:37 - is Heroku is kind of its own animal it's
02:39 - not really an animal it's a web server
02:41 - but whatever it's it's its own it has
02:43 - its own way of doing things and the way
02:45 - that you send things to Heroku and get
02:47 - things back from Heroku is two ways one
02:50 - is you use git what is git oh boy if you
02:53 - don't know what git is stay tuned for my
02:55 - upcoming set of git and GitHub tutorials
02:57 - but for now if you don't know what git
02:59 - is is um you're going to be you'll still
03:02 - be able to follow this but you're just
03:03 - going to have to verbatim kind of
03:05 - copy I heard a
03:09 - noise there's a person somewhere nearby
03:12 - I have to keep going anyway okay um uh
03:15 - you can just sort of verbatim copy um
03:17 - some of these uh
03:21 - commands um okay so now I'm waving to
03:25 - somebody who uh it's my my neighbor Joe
03:28 - I love Joe he's a great CR
03:30 - uh he came and said hi the other day
03:32 - okay I got to keep going here so um so
03:34 - you can see here that on the Heroku page
03:37 - it's even giving you some sort of
03:38 - commands that you can follow we'll worry
03:40 - about that in a moment but we're missing
03:43 - one other aspect here the first thing
03:45 - that it's saying to do is saying Heroku
03:48 - login meaning log into your Heroku
03:50 - account from terminal somehow so if I go
03:53 - over here and I type in Heroku
03:56 - login it says command not found so one
03:59 - of the things you need in order to work
04:01 - with Heroku is a piece of software
04:04 - called the Heroku tool belt so I
04:06 - probably should have pre installed that
04:08 - but I'm just going to Google Heroku tool
04:11 - belt I'm going to click on the first
04:13 - thing that comes up and I'm going to
04:15 - download it and I think it's GNA this is
04:17 - going to happen quickly enough that I
04:19 - can just do this I'm going to install it
04:22 - continue continue
04:25 - install uh password and there there we
04:29 - go I'm installing it I do my installing
04:35 - dance I don't know I I didn't I like the
04:39 - weird thing about me doing this dance
04:40 - while this video is going I have a
04:42 - preview screen I'm like watching myself
04:44 - over here I supposed to just dancing to
04:46 - the camera that was very weird I will
04:47 - edit that out that no one that someone
04:50 - will make a weird gift out of that or
04:52 - something okay so now I should be able
04:54 - to go
04:55 - back and type in Heroku look at that oh
04:59 - install tool I didn't even know it was
05:00 - going to do that so maybe you have to do
05:03 - that I was about to just say Heroku log
05:05 - in but I just was typing Heroku to make
05:07 - sure it works apparently I have to do
05:08 - another dance because it's installing a
05:11 - bunch of stuff oh that was I don't have
05:14 - to dance okay so now we can see um I
05:17 - should be able to say Heroku login and
05:20 - it should ask for my credentials my
05:22 - account is under my email my password is
05:26 - [Music]
05:29 - I'm logged in so now that I'm logged in
05:32 - I can actually start to do things which
05:35 - would allow me to deploy uh from
05:37 - terminal here all the stuff for my bot
05:41 - to Heroku itself so let's go back
05:46 - now to this
05:49 - page and uh oh actually this page no
05:54 - this page sorry and we can see here now
06:00 - now that I've logged into Heroku the
06:02 - next thing I need to do is make my uh
06:08 - bot into a git repository again the what
06:12 - git is if you're not familiar with it is
06:14 - out of the scope of this particular
06:15 - video but it's a Version Control
06:19 - software and uh what it's going to allow
06:22 - me to do is once I turn it into a git
06:25 - repository meaning all the code for my
06:27 - bot is in this folder it's going to
06:29 - allow me to push that git repository to
06:32 - Heroku because everything that lives on
06:33 - Heroku is also a git repository so I'm
06:36 - going to be able to follow these
06:37 - commands the first thing I'm going to do
06:39 - is say get
06:40 - init get
06:43 - init and it initialized an empty git
06:46 - reposit now if you get if I type got by
06:49 - the way instead of git it's going to say
06:50 - got command not found if you get this
06:53 - error meaning git command not found this
06:56 - just means you need to download and
06:58 - install git so if I Google git the very
07:01 - first thing that comes up is this
07:03 - particular website
07:06 - g-.& I can just uh somewhere here uh H
07:10 - right right here I can download for Mac
07:12 - or for Windows or whatever it is you're
07:15 - so you can download and install git and
07:16 - and if if for some reason you didn't
07:18 - have that already okay now that I've
07:20 - done that the next command that I need
07:23 - to go to is this Heroku get remote- a so
07:29 - what what I'm doing is I'm saying I want
07:31 - my git repository this thing that lives
07:33 - on my computer I want it to be linked to
07:36 - a remote place that remote place far off
07:39 - in the distance is Heroku and I not just
07:42 - want to link it to Heroku but I want to
07:43 - link it to my app that's coding rainbow
07:46 - demo so I can just take exactly this
07:50 - here and I can type put that into
07:52 - terminal I see it over here on my
07:54 - preview screen and there we go it's all
07:57 - set now and
08:00 - then I can go here and I can say the
08:05 - next thing okay so the next set of
08:06 - commands here is now I actually want to
08:09 - send the stuff to Heroku the way that
08:12 - you send stuff to Heroku is with a
08:13 - command a git command called push in get
08:16 - push means send pull means receive so
08:20 - there's a there's there's a lot to
08:22 - there's a lot to this but I first thing
08:24 - I need to do is like add and commit and
08:26 - so I'm just going to follow these
08:27 - commands I someday this will link to my
08:29 - get tutorials which will explain all
08:31 - these commands so I'm going to say get
08:33 - add and then I'm just going to use
08:35 - exactly I'm going to say commit get
08:37 - commit D am make it better this I could
08:40 - put my own comment in here I'm going to
08:42 - say uh oh and you can't this needs to
08:44 - move like a little bit over here I'm
08:45 - going to say uh uh this is my
08:50 - bot and it did that and then I'm going
08:53 - to say get push Heroku
08:56 - Master get push Heroku Master which will
09:00 - send it so now it's sending it to Heroku
09:03 - and it's going to do all sorts of stuff
09:05 - to try to run
09:07 - it the thing is I missed some steps so
09:10 - these would have been the steps if I had
09:12 - a kind of traditional
09:14 - old-fashioned uh web application you
09:16 - know I made some sort of server it
09:18 - serves up web pages people log onto my
09:20 - server they see the web pages but that's
09:22 - not actually what I made I made this bot
09:24 - which is just this process that needs to
09:26 - run behind the scenes uh with no there's
09:29 - no web server there's no place there's
09:30 - no URL for anyone to go to I just want
09:32 - this thing to run on the server so I
09:34 - have over here I'm just want to make
09:36 - sure I get the syntax right my notes um
09:40 - and uh okay so in order to do this I'm
09:43 - missing a particular piece so first
09:47 - thing I want to do actually by the way I
09:49 - really should have practiced this in
09:50 - advance but this is fine so there's so
09:53 - let's here we are we' kind we've got
09:55 - okay what have we done so far we wrote
09:57 - the code for our bot we pushed it to
09:59 - Heroku and we and it even just sort of
10:01 - said verifying deploy done it didn't
10:03 - give me any error messages so let's
10:05 - actually go and look now I'm going to go
10:07 - back to uh my
10:09 - dashboard and I should see here I should
10:12 - be able to find oh yeah sorry whoops I
10:15 - should be able to find coding rainbow
10:17 - demo I'm going to click on that and
10:19 - we're going to see um it says sleeping
10:23 - so it's not really working it's not
10:25 - really doing anything yet the reason
10:27 - it's not doing anything yet is because
10:30 - it is listed as a web app I need to
10:34 - change this to be what's called a worker
10:37 - app and that's what I was talking about
10:38 - a worker is a web app is something that
10:40 - serves up web pages a worker is
10:42 - something that just works behind the
10:44 - scenes with its own process and that's
10:45 - what the bot is so in order to do that I
10:49 - need to go back to my code here and I
10:51 - actually need to create a new file so
10:53 - this is my folder with all the stuff and
10:56 - I need to create a new file and I need
10:58 - that file to be
11:01 - called I'm going to save it uh
11:04 - P file proc file this is the process
11:08 - file it's a configuration file that
11:10 - Heroku will look for to know what is it
11:13 - that this thing is supposed to do so I'm
11:15 - going to save that and in that file I'm
11:17 - going to say this thing is actually a
11:19 - worker not not a web application and it
11:23 - its job is to run node bot. js so I'm
11:28 - going to save save that in there and
11:30 - then I have got to go back and this is
11:33 - again um if you're unfamiliar with Git I
11:38 - here's the thing I need to I made some
11:40 - changes to my project now I need those
11:42 - changes to go onto Heroku those changes
11:45 - are only locally on my laptop so to do
11:47 - that I need to say get add dot this is
11:50 - adding my changes and I need to say
11:53 - commit which is giving a message to
11:55 - those which is adding the proc file you
11:59 - can following those this is the same
12:01 - things I did for the first one and then
12:02 - I can say get push Heroku Master this is
12:06 - sending it to Heroku Master Heroku is
12:10 - our
12:11 - Master uh and now that done it's
12:17 - finished uh as I do my little dance I
12:21 - have to wait for all this to finish
12:23 - launching verifying deploy Etc now I
12:27 - should be able to go here and hit
12:28 - refresh
12:31 - and I see now I see look at that it says
12:34 - worker node bot. js and this I want to
12:38 - turn off I need to hit edit I want to
12:40 - turn off the web the web process confirm
12:46 - and I want to turn on the worker one
12:50 - confirm and
12:53 - now as far as I
12:55 - know oh my goodness boy we we sent a lot
12:58 - of tweets
13:00 - um you can see now it's uh you can see
13:03 - it's it's running now so it was probably
13:05 - running it's interesting that it
13:07 - actually worked maybe earlier but now it
13:09 - should be running every 20 seconds it
13:11 - should um post a new tweet and we should
13:14 - be able to see this by the way uh if I
13:17 - back here say Heroku
13:19 - log uh oh what I meant log is not a
13:23 - command perhaps I meant logs and in fact
13:25 - yes I meant
13:27 - logs uh Heroku
13:31 - logs and you can see by the way this is
13:34 - running because there's two new
13:36 - tweets uh and here uh it
13:42 - worked right so
13:45 - um this is oh yeah so you can see by the
13:48 - way there's a bunch of things going on
13:51 - here because I let it run as a web thing
13:53 - the first time and the web thing has an
13:55 - error it's stopped but you can see the
13:57 - worker thing is just saying it worked it
13:59 - worked it worked so I don't know if 20
14:01 - seconds has passed but if I do this
14:04 - again look at the logs you can see the
14:06 - worker is still going so um I'm actually
14:09 - going to shut it off um because I have
14:11 - it set to like tweet every 20 seconds
14:13 - which is pretty often but you can see
14:15 - that this works so now my bot is
14:16 - deployed on Heroku and by the way free
14:19 - account free Heroku account um to to do
14:23 - this so um so you don't this you do not
14:25 - need a paid Heroku account to Simply run
14:28 - run a an app with a worker process so
14:31 - hopefully this was helpful to you this
14:32 - is about 15 minutes of the steps um what
14:35 - I'm going to do in the video's
14:38 - description is uh kind of paste links to
14:41 - all the pieces you need to download uh
14:44 - I'll have links to all the pieces you
14:45 - need to download I also have this thing
14:47 - that I ran through as a written tutorial
14:49 - so I will post a link to that as well um
14:52 - and uh but before I go away I'm just
14:55 - going to show you how I could shut it
14:56 - off if I want to so I could hit edit
14:58 - here I could turn this off and hit
15:00 - confirm so now my bot uh even though it
15:04 - did four more random numbers it should
15:06 - have stopped now and it won't do any
15:08 - more random numbers I've shut it off
15:10 - right now so uh that was that concludes
15:13 - our discussion of how to deploy your no
15:16 - Dutch ass bot to
15:19 - Heroku over here I'm going to

Cleaned transcript:

hello in this video I am going to look at how to deploy your Bot written in node.js to uh a server and that server being one that runs on a service called Heroku so let's take a look at the pieces so you can see here I have my browser open to my test account A2Z ITP which uh I most recently just tweeted a bot tweeted a random number 39 and I have the code for that bot open right here you can see it in Sublime it's very simple it has a single function that tweets that random number number uh and then I also have my terminal open to that directory and I could just really quickly test to make sure that bot works the bot is starting it worked let's go back to the browser I'm going to hit refresh and we can see now I got random number four so everything is working the point is in this video is I want to say this bot that's running right over here I don't want to run it from my laptop I want it to run autonomously on a server somewhere that I can set it to go and never think about it again so let's tweet it again let's quit it um and look at how we can do that so the site that I'm the the service that I'm going to use in this particular video is Heroku so um you'll need an account so you know if you're watching this video and you don't have a Heroku account go to uh Heroku dcom Heroku spelled this way.com and you can see here I went there now now I'm already logged in so it went straight to my my dashboard and you can see that I have all these things already listed on my dashboard because apparently I've tried to make a variety of I've tried to do this a whole bunch of times test this test that delete soon Etc so what are these things these things are referred to as dinos I think that's right not dinos D NS dinos Dy NS like a dynamic thing that's running it's a process that you're running so what I need to do is create a dyo to run my bot so the very first thing that I'm going to do is go up here to this plus sign up in the top right and I'm going to say create new app so app is really what I'm doing I'm going to create an app I'm going to call it uh coding rainbow uh demo uh should only contain lowercase letters okay rainbow demo uh it is available I'm going to create it and it is now there so there's a whole bunch of things I need to do here and one of the things about using Heroku is Heroku is kind of its own animal it's not really an animal it's a web server but whatever it's it's its own it has its own way of doing things and the way that you send things to Heroku and get things back from Heroku is two ways one is you use git what is

this but you're just going to have to verbatim kind of copy I heard a noise there's a person somewhere nearby I have to keep going anyway okay um uh you can just sort of verbatim copy um some of these uh commands um okay so now I'm waving to somebody who uh it's my my neighbor Joe I love Joe he's a great CR uh he came and said hi the other day okay I got to keep going here so um so you can see here that on the Heroku page it's even giving you some sort of commands that you can follow we'll worry about that in a moment but we're missing one other aspect here the first thing that it's saying to do

that comes up and I'm going to download it and I think it's GNA this is going to happen quickly enough that I can just do this I'm going to install it continue continue install uh password and there there we go I'm installing it I do my installing dance I don't know I I didn't I like the weird thing about me doing this dance while this video is going I have a preview screen I'm like watching myself over here I supposed to just dancing to the camera that was very weird I will edit that out that no one that someone will make a weird gift out of that or something okay so now I should be able to go back and type in Heroku look at that oh install tool I didn't even know it was going to do that so maybe you have to do that I was about to just say Heroku log in but I just was typing Heroku to make sure it works apparently I have to do another dance because it's installing a bunch of stuff oh that was I don't have to dance okay so now we can see um I should be able to say Heroku login and

you get if I type got by the way instead of git it's going to say got command not found if you get this error meaning git command not found this just means you need to download and install git so if I Google git the very first thing that comes up is this particular website g.& I can just uh somewhere here uh H right right here I can download for Mac or for Windows or whatever it is you're so you can download and install git and and if if for some reason you didn't have that already okay now that I've done that the next command that I need to go to is this Heroku get remote a so what what I'm doing is I'm saying I want my git repository this thing that lives on my computer I want it to be linked to a remote place that remote place far off in the distance is Heroku and I not just want to link it to Heroku but I want to link it to my app that's coding rainbow demo so I can just take exactly this here and I can type put that into terminal I see it over here on my preview screen and there we go it's all set now and then I can go here and I can say the next thing okay so the next set of commands here is now I actually want to send the stuff to Heroku the way that you send stuff to Heroku is with a command a git command called push in get push means send pull means receive so there's a there's there's a lot to there's a lot to this but I first thing I need to do is like add and commit and so I'm just going to follow these commands I someday this will link to my get tutorials which will explain all these commands so I'm going to say get add and then I'm just going to use exactly I'm going to say commit get commit D am make it better this I could put my own comment in here I'm going to say uh oh and you can't this needs to move like a little bit over here I'm going to say uh uh this is my bot and it did that and then I'm going to say get push Heroku Master get push Heroku Master which will send it so now it's sending it to Heroku and it's going to do all sorts of stuff to try to run it the thing is I missed some steps so these would have been the steps if I had a kind of traditional oldfashioned uh web application you know I made some sort of server it serves up web pages people log onto my server they see the web pages but that's not actually what I made I made this bot which is just this process that needs to run behind the scenes uh with no there's no web server there's no place there's no URL for anyone to go to I just want this thing to run on the server so I have over here I'm just want to make sure I get the syntax right my notes um and uh okay so in order to do this I'm missing a particular piece so first thing I want to do actually by the way I really should have practiced this in advance but this is fine so there's so let's here we are we' kind we've got okay what have we done so far we wrote the code for our bot we pushed it to Heroku and we and it even just sort of said verifying deploy done it didn't give me any error messages so let's actually go and look now I'm going to go back to uh my dashboard and I should see here I should be able to find oh yeah sorry whoops I should be able to find coding rainbow demo I'm going to click on that and we're going to see um it says sleeping so it's not really working it's not really doing anything yet the reason it's not doing anything yet is because it is listed as a web app I need to change this to be what's called a worker app and that's what I was talking about a worker is a web app is something that serves up web pages a worker is something that just works behind the scenes with its own process and that's what the bot is so in order to do that I need to go back to my code here and I actually need to create a new file so this is my folder with all the stuff and I need to create a new file and I need that file to be called I'm going to save it uh P file proc file this is the process file it's a configuration file that Heroku will look for to know what is it that this thing is supposed to do so I'm going to save that and in that file I'm going to say this thing is actually a worker not not a web application and it its job is to run node bot. js so I'm going to save save that in there and then I have got to go back and this is again um if you're unfamiliar with Git I here's the thing I need to I made some changes to my project now I need those changes to go onto Heroku those changes are only locally on my laptop so to do that I need to say get add dot this is adding my changes and I need to say commit which is giving a message to those which is adding the proc file you can following those this is the same things I did for the first one and then I can say get push Heroku Master this is sending it to Heroku Master Heroku is our Master uh and now that done it's finished uh as I do my little dance I have to wait for all this to finish launching verifying deploy Etc now I should be able to go here and hit refresh and I see now I see look at that it says worker node bot. js and this I want to turn off I need to hit edit I want to turn off the web the web process confirm and I want to turn on the worker one confirm and now as far as I know oh my goodness boy we we sent a lot of tweets um you can see now it's uh you can see it's it's running now so it was probably running it's interesting that it actually worked maybe earlier but now it should be running every 20 seconds it should um post a new tweet and we should be able to see this by the way uh if I back here say Heroku log uh oh what I meant log is not a command perhaps I meant logs and in fact yes I meant logs uh Heroku logs and you can see by the way this is running because there's two new tweets uh and here uh it worked right so um this is oh yeah so you can see by the way there's a bunch of things going on here because I let it run as a web thing the first time and the web thing has an error it's stopped but you can see the worker thing is just saying it worked it worked it worked so I don't know if 20 seconds has passed but if I do this again look at the logs you can see the worker is still going so um I'm actually going to shut it off um because I have it set to like tweet every 20 seconds which is pretty often but you can see that this works so now my bot is deployed on Heroku and by the way free account free Heroku account um to to do this so um so you don't this you do not need a paid Heroku account to Simply run run a an app with a worker process so hopefully this was helpful to you this is about 15 minutes of the steps um what I'm going to do in the video's description is uh kind of paste links to all the pieces you need to download uh I'll have links to all the pieces you need to download I also have this thing that I ran through as a written tutorial so I will post a link to that as well um and uh but before I go away I'm just going to show you how I could shut it off if I want to so I could hit edit here I could turn this off and hit confirm so now my bot uh even though it did four more random numbers it should have stopped now and it won't do any more random numbers I've shut it off right now so uh that was that concludes our discussion of how to deploy your no Dutch ass bot to Heroku over here I'm going to
