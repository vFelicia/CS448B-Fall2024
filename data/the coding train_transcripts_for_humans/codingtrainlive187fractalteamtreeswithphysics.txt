06:09 - hello and welcome to my life
06:12 - okay ah is this happening this is really
06:15 - happening right now hello and welcome to
06:17 - the coding train I'm looking in front of
06:19 - me and seeing a light on over here and
06:21 - three lights that I forgot to turn on
06:23 - and actually about thirty seconds ago I
06:25 - forgot to put the mic on just scrambling
06:27 - to put the mic on let me go turn those
06:28 - lights on enjoy some music Here I am
06:33 - turning on lights number two like number
06:39 - three
06:43 - oh it's brighter in here now lovely ha
06:51 - all right now I'm really here and I am
06:53 - wearing my fancy new team trees
06:57 - sweatshirt strangely enough these trees
06:59 - seem to be purple also I something
07:05 - strange is going on but if you would
07:06 - like to see what this sweatshirt really
07:07 - looks like I will come over here oh boy
07:09 - it's bright
07:11 - I thought I fixed the settings on this
07:14 - camera but yeah I apparently did not
07:17 - welcome if you're new here maybe you
07:20 - came for the trees this is the coding
07:24 - train where I a person has signed a
07:29 - contract to every time I say the word
07:30 - train I have to blow a ridiculous train
07:34 - whistle it's my lot in life but really I
07:37 - come here on Fridays and other days and
07:39 - sometimes not at all to livestream
07:42 - coding tutorials and coding challenges
07:44 - and fun creative projects to make with
07:46 - code and basically also waste a lot of
07:50 - time with a lot of nonsense if you're
07:52 - really more interested in just coding
07:56 - tutorials I might tell you to go refer
07:59 - to some of the videos my playlists which
08:00 - are on my channel which are in playlists
08:02 - and edited together a little bit more
08:03 - succinctly for learning to code but
08:06 - today I am here to do a special
08:09 - livestream as part of this YouTube
08:12 - fundraiser that's happening today called
08:14 - team trees any money donated as part of
08:18 - the fundraiser
08:18 - we'll go to the National Arbor
08:20 - Foundation the goal is to raise twenty
08:22 - million dollars every dollar goes to
08:24 - plant a tree there's lots of information
08:26 - about this online at teen trees and a
08:29 - special thank you to today's sponsor of
08:32 - the livestream brilliant odd org I will
08:36 - come back brilliant I works a wonderful
08:37 - website with lots of fun interactive
08:39 - challenges and learning puzzles and
08:40 - courses in the middle of the live stream
08:42 - I will do the today's daily challenge
08:44 - thank you for their sponsorship of
08:46 - today's live stream I am donating the
08:49 - brilliant sponsorship feed to the
08:51 - National Arbor foundation for today's
08:52 - live stream okay I said train whistle
08:56 - Simoniz fact-checking me and said I said
09:01 - train whistle but not did not blow the
09:02 - train whistle all right I will by the
09:08 - way I have a level in here now we can
09:11 - see if I am level don't break the level
09:17 - wait what happens if the level is more
09:19 - than one bubble in it now no it's back
09:21 - to one bubble hi Dan hey Dan Thank You
09:25 - TMC who donated five bucks I do see a
09:28 - quick notification pop-up when somebody
09:32 - donates but I don't see if I don't look
09:34 - quickly they seem to go away I should
09:36 - open up a page which shows me that
09:39 - Leonard gasps lured donated five euros I
09:43 - believe that's the unit of measurement
09:44 - to the National Arbor Day Foundation
09:46 - thank you very much
09:47 - ding and train with all and alle Babis
09:51 - writes hey Dan this is my first stream
09:54 - yay welcome Congrats on gaining a level
09:58 - dan what did I gain how did I gain a
10:01 - level what level did I gain I'm not sure
10:03 - what's going on all right so I'm pretty
10:08 - excited about what I'm going to code
10:10 - today and maybe I think it probably
10:12 - makes the most sense for me to just jump
10:14 - right into it I mean you know but in
10:19 - case you this is your first live stream
10:22 - and have never been here before I think
10:24 - I better just clue people in to what
10:26 - this channel really is like and often
10:29 - what I like to do is read
10:31 - helps me relax helps me get my mindset
10:33 - to think about coding and algorithms and
10:35 - all that stuff by reading from my
10:37 - favorite book a million random digits
10:41 - with a hundred thousand normal TV it's
10:42 - still looking for a first edition
10:45 - complete copy of this book hard to find
10:51 - sixty-four thousand one hundred
10:53 - sixty-one 3748 seventy three thousand
10:58 - twenty five doesn't feel like this is
11:00 - the right moment to read these numbers
11:03 - the one you have now the level the worst
11:16 - I'm so bad that I use corny sad trombone
11:19 - sound effects that literally what I have
11:22 - become in my life a person who wears a
11:26 - green sweatshirt that's see-through play
11:29 - sad trombone sounds live streaming on
11:32 - YouTube wow this is the part that I'm
11:34 - happy about actually reading random
11:35 - numbers ninety thousand eight hundred
11:39 - thirty five ninety one thousand eight
11:41 - hundred forty three fifty four thousand
11:44 - three hundred forty three twenty seven
11:46 - thousand eight hundred and ninety seven
11:47 - forty-three thousand eight hundred and
11:49 - sixty six twelve thousand eight hundred
11:52 - twelve fifty five thousand ninety three
11:55 - eighty seven thousand four hundred and
11:57 - eighty nine twenty eight thousand seven
11:59 - hundred and eighty-three forty-two
12:01 - thousand four hundred thirty four forty
12:04 - seven thousand nine hundred and seventy
12:06 - two indeed - three hundred - seven
12:10 - thousand six hundred sixty eight ninety
12:12 - three thousand four hundred and seventy
12:14 - seven ninety two thousand five hundred
12:16 - and forty eight fifty-five
12:18 - in 622 4338 66 thousand and twenty one
12:26 - fifty five thousand five hundred and
12:28 - fifty one ninety four thousand three
12:31 - hundred eighteen ninety three thousand
12:34 - three hundred and ninety one the music
12:40 - is very loud okay thanks for letting me
12:43 - oh yeah no it's at the same level it's
12:46 - always been maybe the lullaby sound is a
12:48 - little louder I will turn it down a
12:50 - little bit boy boink
12:56 - oh oh oh shamil and closer you asks
12:59 - what's the book about
13:00 - okay let me just write I think maybe you
13:02 - didn't get it so I better read another
13:04 - section fifty fifty thousand nine
13:07 - hundred fifty-six 77948 wente eight
13:15 - ninety five thousand four hundred and
13:17 - sixty nine random numbers six million I
13:24 - I'm gonna move lunch it's apparently
13:26 - first four hundred and twenty five
13:27 - people watching right now so I'm I'm
13:31 - kind of on a path and I have all these
13:35 - projects that I would like to and it by
13:38 - the way when I keep looking over here
13:39 - it's because I got multiple chaps and
13:40 - feeds and things telling me stuff about
13:42 - what's happening the live stream but I'm
13:44 - gonna focus on you the viewer and talk
13:46 - to you for a minute I have a lot of
13:48 - plans I have a lot of topics I want to
13:51 - attempt to cover and videos that to them
13:55 - because every week I'm distracted by
13:57 - some thing that I thought of or somebody
13:59 - told me about that I thought I would try
14:00 - and this is one of those weeks I'm I'm
14:04 - teaching a course called introduction to
14:05 - machine learning for the creative arts
14:06 - and most of that course does not have
14:09 - video tutorials associated with it and I
14:11 - really would like to get that up and
14:13 - running and fill that out but I'm here
14:16 - because I'm going to revisit something
14:18 - that I have wanted to do for years that
14:20 - I've never found the time to do and I'm
14:22 - going to do it as a coding challenge
14:24 - today for team trees for the team trees
14:27 - fundraiser so that is what I'm going to
14:31 - do is I'm
14:32 - to go back back in time two days of your
14:35 - a long long time ago all the way to
14:39 - coding challenge we're now on coding
14:40 - challenge number 152 which is kind of
14:43 - insane this is livestream number 187
14:46 - apparently I've been doing this for
14:48 - quite a while now just nuts but I'm
14:51 - gonna go all the way back scroll scroll
14:54 - but you're not getting seasick - coding
14:56 - challenge number 15 can I get there
14:59 - where am i 43 oh so many coding
15:01 - challenges coding challenge number one
15:03 - with starfield we're gonna find number
15:05 - 15 because that will form the basis of
15:09 - what I want to do so what I want to what
15:12 - I have already done everything I could
15:14 - possibly think of near something to do a
15:19 - tree pose is that like a yoga thing
15:24 - which is good I need to do more yoga to
15:28 - stretch so I have already done every
15:32 - possible algorithmic tree fractal thing
15:35 - that I could think of I have a coding
15:37 - challenge on just fractal trees with
15:39 - recursion making an object oriented to
15:41 - put some leaves at the end of the tree I
15:43 - did an l-system I did the like spacewalk
15:47 - that's not what it is space colonization
15:49 - algorithm I've done a bunch so many yes
15:52 - space colonization 3d fractal trees
15:55 - l-system I was like on a whole tree kick
15:57 - if only I had known this team trees we'd
16:00 - be planting trees here in 2019 I could
16:03 - have not done any of these I could just
16:04 - redo them today but I've done them
16:06 - before and so on David's reminding me
16:09 - yes I do want to show the RDP
16:11 - contributions I'm kind of getting to the
16:13 - community contributions thing so this is
16:17 - what I want to start with I want to
16:19 - start with making the object-oriented
16:22 - fractal trees because the thing that I
16:24 - said I definitely must have said in one
16:26 - of these videos is I would like to look
16:28 - at or I proposed this as a challenge to
16:30 - a viewer to add physics of the tree so
16:33 - you can draw the pattern of the tree
16:34 - recursively that's what's happening if I
16:39 - go here right we can just see this is a
16:42 - recursive tree and it's just unfurling
16:45 - all at once
16:46 - there's none of the information about
16:48 - the tree is retained it's just sort of
16:51 - like a stamp onto the canvas
16:53 - I could also oh we will here if I do
17:00 - this by this website oh no wrong way
17:02 - this website is awesome I could go to
17:06 - this one and this one I can't remember
17:08 - do I have it grow
17:09 - what's it broken is it broken oh no oh
17:13 - no I pressed I click so I could actually
17:17 - have the tree grow slowly over time and
17:19 - I could add some leaves that fall so
17:21 - this is actually now retaining
17:23 - information about the parts of the tree
17:25 - where they are and placing a shape at
17:28 - the end this is what I want to build on
17:30 - so this is what I need to maybe have the
17:33 - tree sway in the wind or something like
17:35 - that
17:35 - so that's what I'm going to do and
17:39 - there's some other tree challenges that
17:41 - do other things so what I thought I
17:44 - would do and this this one would be an
17:46 - interesting one to try as well but let's
17:49 - start with this one and what I wanted to
17:50 - do was look at some of the tree
17:52 - community contributions but since I
17:54 - recently released a coding challenge RDP
17:58 - Ramar Douglas poker algorithm you know
18:01 - it's a topic that everybody was just
18:02 - dying for me to do most but that I could
18:08 - maybe I should I would like to show
18:09 - those community contributions so let's
18:11 - start off with doing that if you are
18:14 - wondering how to submit your own
18:16 - community contribution there's an you
18:18 - this there's this link here and also see
18:21 - how you can do it for any coding
18:22 - challenge coding challenge number one
18:23 - from a long time ago you could do might
18:28 - not be able to wear this so much ole
18:29 - live stream there's a explanation of how
18:33 - it works here along with a video
18:35 - tutorial because that's the thing that I
18:36 - do apparently make video tutorials let's
18:39 - look at these community contributions
18:41 - that came in Raymer Drive this poker
18:43 - algorithm in 3d using p5.js let's take a
18:47 - look at that one wow that's wild so I
18:51 - think we're seeing it play out over time
18:53 - where the line line optimization or
18:57 - iterative line up to
18:58 - is may be called per make the leaves
19:01 - blow with wind perla noise so that's
19:04 - pretty interesting to see this 3d curve
19:07 - our path being iteratively simplified by
19:11 - removing excess points
19:12 - that's wonderful I'm kind of amazed at
19:15 - the WebGL engine in p5 works well enough
19:18 - for you to make something like this
19:20 - which is wonderful thank you for that
19:22 - let's take a look at this GPS route data
19:25 - swift for iPhone this is gonna take me
19:26 - to a YouTube video which might not be
19:28 - the easiest thing for me to just watch
19:29 - right now but why not so this is a swift
19:33 - app may be looking at a path and then
19:37 - yes so this is the this is definitely
19:39 - one of the applications of the algorithm
19:41 - which is to look at maybe look at geo
19:44 - geo data chart a path through lat/long
19:48 - points and then simplify that path by
19:51 - removing excess points that kind of
19:52 - thing that's pretty interesting
19:54 - no cancel I thought I had auto play off
19:55 - here hey look there's this live stream
19:58 - with five-o it's a fundraiser look at
20:00 - all this new stuff going on on YouTube
20:01 - today let's take a look at Oh seriously
20:05 - oh yes so this was actually pointed out
20:08 - in one of the comments that oh it would
20:11 - have made sense to combine RDP with your
20:13 - earlier for a drawing videos because you
20:17 - could kind of take the user drawn the
20:21 - user drawing from made from the mouse
20:23 - and optimized it and looks like David
20:26 - Schneider did the very this so let's
20:28 - take a look at this okay I'm gonna draw
20:30 - something I'm gonna draw a tree that's
20:34 - gonna be this is how trees look all
20:45 - right and so what are the interesting
20:48 - things about you doing this with I see
20:55 - your comment Nathan about my messing up
20:57 - with Auto play don't think I don't see
20:58 - it one of the nice thing one of the
21:01 - interesting things that's happening here
21:02 - is by reducing the points the speed of
21:05 - the fourier visualization is suddenly so
21:09 - fast because it's tied the actual
21:10 - rotation speed and the number
21:12 - of epicycles is tied to the number of
21:15 - points so maybe there's a way to massage
21:16 - that in some way too even with fewer
21:18 - points to slow it down or I'm not so
21:20 - sure but that would be something to
21:22 - consider I would say and then already
21:25 - piece scaling fidelity to plot y axis
21:27 - lines ok motifs art I don't know I don't
21:31 - think I looked at this one whoa does
21:35 - this have sound feels like it should
21:37 - have sound this should have sound I
21:42 - don't know what sound that should have
21:51 - news
21:53 - [Music]
21:59 - sometimes I just like lose myself with
22:02 - my thoughts while live-streaming it's
22:05 - they didn't fix the air and in fact when
22:08 - I walked in here it was 68 degrees which
22:11 - is way too cool but I was happy with
22:13 - that because the it gets warm as I'm in
22:14 - here for a while but the sweatshirt
22:16 - thing is making it feel quite quite all
22:24 - right
22:25 - synth Wave music yeah I agree
22:28 - thank you for this these are beautiful I
22:30 - can't tell you how much joy it brings me
22:33 - to see people's variations of the coding
22:35 - challenges and the coding examples and
22:37 - sharing them and I hope that I'm doing a
22:40 - the best job that I can in sharing those
22:42 - back with the community and allowing
22:44 - people to engage with each other and be
22:46 - creative so if you have ideas and things
22:48 - that I could think about to do a better
22:49 - job let me know I will also mention that
22:54 - I am taking steps to be better about
22:59 - having merging contributions and
23:04 - bringing in more people to work on the
23:06 - github repos I will note that if you're
23:09 - looking for something to get started
23:11 - with it's still technically hack tober
23:13 - fest if you still need to get some pull
23:14 - request for your features a pull request
23:18 - for your features I just started
23:21 - speaking words that make no sense if
23:22 - you're still looking to get a number of
23:25 - pull requests for your t-shirt
23:28 - oktoberfest t-shirt you could contribute
23:30 - to the coding train website and in
23:32 - particular i will note act adding
23:38 - backlog of guests tutorials even tagged
23:40 - hacked Oberer fest so violet craze they
23:44 - are working to help me keep the github
23:46 - repos up-to-date and managed and so I'm
23:50 - violet is there along with many other
23:52 - members of the community to help you out
23:54 - if you want to try contributing to the
23:56 - website one of the things that violet is
23:57 - looking at is what videos don't have a
24:00 - corresponding web page where people
24:02 - might want to share their versions even
24:04 - ones from years ago and so this is an
24:07 - issue that talks about how you can get
24:09 - involved with filling some of those in
24:10 - on the website if you're looking for
24:12 - or you know kind of getting started
24:14 - working with github and an open source
24:16 - project kind of thing and David says you
24:21 - forgot to remind me about the more
24:23 - contributions right oh thank you
24:25 - actually you didn't forget because you
24:28 - just reminded me and this is the last
24:30 - thing I'm gonna do before I start the
24:32 - coding challenge today a chrome uh tree
24:34 - yes I love that welcome to my chroma
24:39 - tree so what I want to say is if one
24:43 - thing you'll notice which is new on the
24:45 - website is you can also go definitely
24:50 - need like I don't have to cabana music
24:51 - that's yeah what's the Cabana music
24:55 - you've been using I should at least add
24:56 - that to my soundboard but probably this
24:58 - is the closest
25:01 - um you could go
25:04 - what I am I even saying I don't need to
25:09 - play music from my soundboard I am a
25:11 - very poor amateur ukulele player who
25:17 - happens to have a very out of tune
25:20 - ukulele that I forgot to tune before I
25:25 - started but we can go to the Cabana and
25:33 - if I go to the Cabana
25:34 - there is one compare the video from my
25:37 - series coding in the Cabana where I code
25:40 - a visualization of the more rows if you
25:42 - haven't seen this I don't know maybe you
25:44 - might enjoy it
25:44 - it's kind of fits with the team trees
25:46 - theme you can go check it out and now
25:49 - you can also because we have this page
25:51 - and maybe you have anyone who wants to
25:52 - contribute some ideas for how to make
25:54 - this look different more like you're in
25:56 - the Cabana you can now add your own
26:08 - versions and maybe soon I have a second
26:13 - coding the Cabana video coming out I
26:15 - should warn you all who hated the
26:17 - chalkboard that the chalkboard makes
26:20 - what we did much it did some excellent
26:24 - work to sort of reduce the amount of
26:26 - chalk sounds but the chalkboard will be
26:28 - no more one more time with the
26:30 - chalkboard you don't know what I'm
26:31 - talking about just go watch this video
26:32 - you'll know pretty quickly let's look at
26:35 - the Morrow's with UI
26:37 - ooh well so this is we can oh what does
26:42 - draw outline how cool I didn't even look
26:46 - at these somehow I missed these loop the
26:49 - drawing ooh
26:50 - loop n in D oh my god so many options
26:52 - this is totally fun you can change the
26:55 - color color picker I don't even know how
26:56 - to do that great work this is fun so you
26:59 - can try one of the thing about this is
27:01 - you can try different values for the
27:05 - variables that determine the more rows
27:07 - patterns let's try for you know 72 it's
27:15 - just fun to like see what happens with
27:18 - all these different values I mean
27:20 - algorithms and graphics it's like
27:23 - chocolate and peanut butter they just
27:26 - did so nice alright thank you for that
27:30 - David and oh wait once again so people
27:35 - people of the internet it's that I thank
27:38 - you to those of you who are so dedicated
27:40 - to the coding train and always are
27:41 - submitting your contributions but if
27:44 - you're out there and you're thinking
27:47 - good I don't know what I'm doing
27:49 - no please I I encourage you submit your
27:53 - version you made it it is beautiful
27:56 - don't be just just come and join and I
28:00 - would love to feature it on the coding
28:01 - train alright 3d more rows radius as 730
28:05 - more whoa okay wow that's kind of nuts
28:13 - and so I can do the same thing here well
28:16 - it whoa oh this is wild
28:22 - great work I love seeing this this is
28:24 - just with p5 WebGL amazing we should
28:27 - look at the code for this so how do you
28:29 - do this in p5 animated rows oh there
28:36 - must be like another JavaScript file
28:38 - I'll look at this on my own time logic
28:40 - ok I guess you can just use vertex begin
28:43 - shape vertex with XYZ points this did
28:46 - like years ago this didn't this didn't
28:48 - work amazing
28:50 - all right now let's go to Morrow's link
28:53 - to scroll this one I did see I remember
28:56 - it's quite lovely this is a code pen a
28:58 - rose by any other name let's do a nice
29:01 - dramatic reading of this oh Romeo will
29:05 - be aware for doubt Wow Romeo deny thy
29:07 - father and refuse thy name or if thou
29:10 - wilt not be but sworn my love and I'll
29:14 - no longer be a Capulet you can see why I
29:17 - failed after I mean I did actually draw
29:20 - but I would have failed and thus I'm a
29:24 - weird internet person who does coding
29:26 - tutorials
29:28 - shall I hear more or shall I speak at
29:31 - this tis but thy name that is my enemy
29:35 - thou art thyself though not a Montague
29:37 - this could also use some music it is nor
29:40 - hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any
29:43 - parts belonging to a man o be so other
29:46 - name
29:46 - look so I didn't even notice this as I'm
29:50 - scrolling this is animating I I'm sorry
29:58 - I shouldn't put the ridiculous music to
29:59 - it because it's quite beautiful so
30:01 - that's really interesting that this is
30:02 - like a know kind of a unique idea to
30:05 - have some sort of content a text scroll
30:08 - scrolling it and I'm have the animation
30:12 - for the scroll be some algorithmic or
30:15 - generative art what I love that all
30:17 - right I think we're ready now well let's
30:22 - go what I wanted to do is let's go back
30:23 - and look at maybe some of the city I
30:27 - sort of have a memory of maybe somebody
30:29 - doing a physics tree so let's look at
30:31 - both of these and see if there is one my
30:35 - version of object-oriented fractals
30:37 - creating a forest randomly ooh oh cool
30:42 - so look at this got to get up to 21
30:45 - million its interactive see see whoa
30:52 - sender version that's super nice let's
30:56 - go back to the original recursive tree
30:58 - Oh wrong one
31:00 - just cuz there might be more pink
31:05 - fractals for us look at these oh that's
31:09 - lovely look at this got some leaves on a
31:12 - pink fractal forest you had me at pink
31:14 - very nice fractal forest oh that's
31:21 - lovely
31:22 - good these beautiful scenes of fractal
31:24 - trees and dynamically customizable
31:27 - implementation in Java oh I'm always
31:32 - afraid to click on YouTube videos oh
31:34 - that's me oh this is me lots of people
31:37 - watch that video a - wait was that
31:40 - this is how did I know that was just in
31:45 - the github sorry this is May 30th 2016
31:51 - over three years ago look okay let me
31:57 - show you something
32:01 - brown just nice beep can you see can you
32:06 - see what's happened to me in three years
32:08 - can you see can you see that I am very
32:15 - distinguished I suppose okay oh boy
32:18 - that's really disturbing okay okay go
32:21 - away go away go away all right so let's
32:26 - get started by building upon the fractal
32:30 - trees object-oriented so I'm gonna go to
32:33 - the challenge I'm going to do let's try
33:20 - as always I always forget this
33:34 - [Music]
34:29 - alright I am back sorry about that
34:31 - everybody as always I always forget off
34:35 - this stop this stop so usually I use
34:45 - rechargeable batteries which is why I
34:47 - just put in the mic but there was
34:49 - somebody else had used that borrow the
34:51 - spike and had put batteries in it and so
34:53 - I was just letting those finish which I
34:55 - probably should have done knowing that I
34:57 - was gonna livestream but I don't know
34:58 - waste it so thus I guess you have not
35:02 - realized that I'm back soon enough
35:08 - [Music]
35:37 - [Music]
35:40 - all right so I've got the old challenge
35:44 - here running in the browser I've got my
35:46 - chrome developer tools open and I've got
35:51 - my code open here I'm not a hundred
35:53 - percent sure about this font size it
35:56 - seems a little small
35:57 - is it okay should I make it a little
36:01 - bigger
36:02 - did I change it and her font size let's
36:04 - just try like thirty two I feel like
36:06 - it's what I usually do that feels better
36:09 - to me it's so I'm gonna stick with that
36:12 - all right now before I start the college
36:16 - I'm gonna update this this was written
36:18 - so long ago down the tree for the paper
36:26 - to write the code on hmm then I typed
36:30 - var back in the day that was the way to
36:33 - name a variable so I'm gonna change this
36:35 - I know it should be Const I know it
36:37 - should be Const I'm just not a Const
36:40 - kind of person so I'm gonna change all
36:42 - these to let
36:51 - maybe I maybe I should be maybe I will
36:53 - become I'll Const person for today
36:55 - alright that looks good alright I'm
36:59 - gonna I want to update this for es6
37:01 - basically and here well now talk about
37:05 - ancient technology constructor function
37:10 - I'm gonna change these to es6 classes
37:14 - this is really exciting for you to watch
37:17 - I'm sure and we could probably write
37:23 - some interesting regular expression or
37:24 - script to automatically do this but what
37:28 - I'm doing is what's wrong what did I get
37:30 - wrong should like Auto format I guess
37:32 - it's just still these are the functions
37:39 - I'm gonna change these to let this is
37:43 - another function whoops just get rid of
37:49 - this
37:53 - okay there we go we've got the branch
37:56 - clap is now a class and control D multi
38:01 - select based on next occurrence yeah
38:03 - there's actually I think I saw some
38:06 - Visual Studio code plug-in or script
38:09 - that will actually update your old
38:11 - constructor function syntax to es6
38:13 - classes but you know I I find it
38:15 - soothing sometimes to do the manual
38:16 - tedium of like just changing everything
38:19 - changing a bearable a manually cut it so
38:21 - I'm a baby I'm like well it's very clear
38:26 - that I'm kind of a weirdo but I don't
38:29 - know maybe that's a very normal thing
38:30 - maybe you might find some peace in your
38:32 - life by there to worry about finding
38:34 - some script to automate stuff just
38:36 - really taking your time alright let's
38:39 - make sure this still works cool too much
38:42 - nonsense here hold on I'm gonna do this
38:47 - because I'm just gonna go grab I would
38:51 - like just to go grab this which is I
38:56 - don't need that I might use the Dom
38:59 - library I might use the sound library
39:01 - but I sort of feel like taking those off
39:03 - I've got version 9 and then I also need
39:06 - branch j/s and so now oh it's looking
39:13 - for style dot CSS which I'm not using
39:17 - all right so we're good and I have
39:21 - updated my code for EF yeah ethics
39:26 - mr. Maugham asks why is var bad bars not
39:31 - bad far I love you you were you were
39:34 - good
39:35 - I still use you sometimes I see you on
39:38 - code examples it makes me I feel
39:41 - something but var is a I would say
39:46 - somewhat deprecated way of declaring a
39:48 - variable and if you would like to know
39:50 - more about that may I suggest watching
39:52 - my video let versus var supposed to like
39:57 - fly in and and show you a little clip of
39:58 - it I don't understand why that doesn't
40:00 - happen if I don't have like some kind of
40:05 - just say it usually happens Oh
40:08 - live life okay boy it's been three my
40:14 - real I said I was gonna get started
40:15 - really quickly it's been 35 minutes okay
40:18 - but now I'm really gonna get started I
40:20 - think that I'm gonna make a couple more
40:22 - adjustments I don't feel like I need to
40:26 - step through built the tree each time in
40:31 - mousepressed so this is doing this is
40:38 - weird
40:39 - let me let me say we get rid of
40:42 - mousepressed and then let me see what
40:48 - happens here that's just gonna do the
40:50 - beginning of the tree but I want to do
40:53 - this some amount of times like this and
41:01 - then I think I'm gonna get rid of the
41:07 - leaves they're not really I mean the
41:09 - leaves would be an interesting thing to
41:10 - add back in but it's kind of not the
41:12 - point of what I'm doing so I'm gonna do
41:14 - n iterations there we go six let's see
41:19 - what it looks like with seven right you
41:21 - can see if I do 12 whoops here we go
41:28 - that's kind of nice all right so we see
41:29 - that this works happy little trees yeah
41:34 - you know I don't people make the boss
41:36 - raw Bob Rock pub boss raw a buzz Rob
41:39 - just got me boss Rob from now on people
41:43 - make the Bob Ross reference and I very
41:47 - much appreciate it I am a huge Bob Ross
41:50 - fan myself I don't know that it's so
41:53 - accurate Bob Ross is a was a is a
41:57 - soothing calming wonderful presence
42:01 - lots of artistic talent and
42:03 - thoughtfulness I think that I'm just
42:06 - hyper frenetic weirdo who's coding on
42:09 - YouTube it's kind of not the same thing
42:14 - world record beard
42:16 - it's Movember not yet almost Movember
42:19 - all right I think I don't want to have I
42:22 - like how it looks this way but I'm gonna
42:24 - reduce that coating train sponsored by
42:34 - brilliant water brilliant org okay
42:49 - okay so I think I'm ready to get started
42:53 - and I sort of feel like today might be a
42:58 - day of not editing this later into a
43:01 - coding challenge but I don't know why I
43:03 - think that but I think I'll act like it
43:05 - is because just in case this is just
43:08 - like these amazing we just have this
43:11 - like our a total perfect Zuma zone Zen
43:15 - happy tree making we might as well give
43:20 - ourselves the opportunity to make that
43:22 - into a nice little package that somebody
43:24 - could find more easily than watching
43:26 - this live stream nonsense okay all right
43:35 - um let's see what else we need I think
43:39 - we're good I should show you by the way
43:40 - just a tease something else that's
43:42 - coming soon on the coding train I have
43:43 - some more props I mean this is a little
43:45 - bit just this my if I might find this
43:46 - disturbing this strange unicorn but also
43:52 - it's just that it's got green oh my
43:55 - goodness this is really gonna be a
43:57 - problem nazia is not gonna like editing
44:00 - this whiteboard wonder just give me a
44:05 - second here I actually have a remote
44:15 - control app that's a chance that that's
44:19 - gonna allow me to fix this camera right
44:21 - now
44:21 - oh I'm still connected okay okay okay
44:24 - I'm going to I'm going to do something
44:28 - very exciting which I'm gonna control
44:30 - this camera from this remote control app
44:34 - and I think maybe what I want is to turn
44:37 - the ISO down is that better better I
44:44 - think that's better now okay
44:48 - I think that's the best thing
44:49 - unfortunately I still so I have these
44:52 - like Sony cameras and I'm having trouble
44:56 - with the white balance I'll show you
44:58 - right now it's on automatic white
45:00 - balance which makes the
45:01 - is a problem but I can't seem to figure
45:03 - out like this is like some of the other
45:05 - settings I think you know I don't think
45:06 - that's better
45:07 - warm white is that better these are like
45:10 - automatic settings I like this one
45:12 - that's like if it's cloudy yes so I'm
45:15 - just gonna or daylight which it's not in
45:18 - here I'm just gonna go back to auto all
45:20 - right turn it one more I said I think I
45:24 - did already so hopefully you can tell me
45:28 - I'm gonna leave it like this right now
45:32 - but the reason why I have so much
45:34 - trouble with these cameras cuz i have
45:36 - them mounted on the wall which means i
45:38 - can't see the menu i have a confidence
45:40 - monitor so I can see what it's seeing
45:43 - but because I want clean HDMI out I
45:45 - can't see the menu on the conference
45:47 - monitor one of these days I'll have a
45:49 - perfect at least they don't go to sleep
45:50 - after 30 minutes they'll go to sleep
45:51 - after they overheat Auto is fine okay
45:59 - here we go everybody
46:08 - one more ISO down that was at 510 all
46:12 - right I'll do one more ISO down
46:28 - okay think so it's that it's not 6:40
46:35 - right now 500 okay how's that I think
46:40 - it's gonna be good it's gonna have to be
46:41 - good enough I don't know how much I'm
46:42 - gonna use the whiteboard okay hopefully
46:51 - that helped all right we really like
46:55 - really got it you know I procrastinate
46:56 - because I'm afraid this is this is very
46:58 - much something that I have not done
47:00 - before and did not practice for this I
47:04 - have used I've made a fractal tree
47:06 - before and I've used the physics library
47:07 - that I intend to use which is toxic libs
47:10 - Jas let me open that up is there a CDN
47:17 - for it I just forgot but it's fine I'll
47:19 - download it if I need to and also let's
47:25 - see if I could find this a project that
47:26 - I want to reference is skittish tree by
47:29 - Martine Bravo I think this is it yeah
47:33 - skittish tree 2011 think there's a nice
47:38 - document let me add Martine Bravo's name
47:43 - here I feel like it was on this is from
47:46 - the spring show but there was a nice
47:49 - video of it I'm looking for it was made
47:56 - as a video installation
48:03 - I guess I'll just this will this will
48:05 - work Oh Paley Center this is what I'm
48:06 - looking for I want to show you this
48:10 - project
48:19 - so this is called skittish tree
48:22 - it's a project made by Martine Bravo and
48:27 - it's an interactive project where the
48:31 - tree kind of has physics and responds to
48:33 - you and you can see that it's like soar
48:35 - like adding appendages and being very
48:38 - skittish so this is kind of like what I
48:40 - hope to accomplish to create a tree
48:44 - structure that each connection is has a
48:48 - spring-like connection to it
48:52 - and I think it's responding to sound if
48:55 - I remember correctly this actually isn't
48:57 - the video I was looking for but that's
49:01 - fine there was an installation that was
49:03 - on of this project that was on like in a
49:06 - store window that's that's the memory of
49:08 - this video that had thank you ruts
49:11 - neighs 32 for donating to the National
49:13 - Arbor Day Foundation and it is time for
49:16 - us to finally make some trees here we go
49:23 - and maybe all right
49:34 - here we go so I'm going to act like this
49:37 - is gonna get edited later decoding
49:39 - challenge and maybe it will maybe it
49:40 - won't hello and welcome to a special
49:45 - team trees coding challenge in today's
49:47 - coding challenge well I guess I'm gonna
49:50 - say could you make the trunk thicker yes
49:53 - all these things are possible hold on
49:56 - just wait hello and welcome to a special
50:01 - team hello and welcome to a coding
50:09 - challenge this is a special coding
50:11 - challenge it is a fundraiser for the
50:13 - team trees initiative you can look at
50:16 - the find the donate button and make a
50:17 - donation to the National Arbor Day
50:19 - Foundation to plant the goal with the
50:21 - goal planning 20 million trees $1 per
50:23 - tree so please join me in this
50:25 - initiative and help plant a tree and for
50:27 - what I'm gonna do I've made a lot of
50:29 - coding challenges that have to do with
50:31 - algorithmic trees and plants and various
50:33 - things and this is from coding challenge
50:36 - number 15 object-oriented fractal tree
50:40 - this is the result of it I'm going to
50:42 - build upon this code and attempt to add
50:44 - physics to it so that the tree could
50:46 - sway and wobble in the wind I'm feeling
50:49 - this is gonna go terribly wrong and but
50:52 - maybe you'll learn something and be
50:53 - inspired to make your own algorithmic
50:55 - tree and to perhaps even better plant a
50:58 - tree or donate some money to help plant
51:00 - a tree the physics library that I'm
51:06 - going to use is called toxic libs Jas so
51:10 - toxic libs jess is actually a port of a
51:13 - library called toxic libs made by
51:15 - Carsten Schmidt aka Toxie it was a
51:19 - processing library that I used to use a
51:20 - lot and is featured in my nature of code
51:24 - book and this is a JavaScript version of
51:26 - it it has lots of features but the
51:28 - feature that I want to use from it is
51:30 - called verlet physics or valve alley
51:34 - rally
51:36 - physics what I'm looking for right here
51:39 - is 2d physics simulation can I click on
51:42 - that that's not a thing to click on so
51:44 - thank you too so
51:48 - toxic libs just - no toxic libs was
51:50 - originally written by Carsten Schmidt
51:51 - for processing
51:52 - I mentioned that and poured into
51:54 - JavaScript by Kyle Phillips haptic data
51:57 - on Twitter so say thank you to haptic
51:59 - data on Twitter how do I get it
52:03 - getting started is it is it it's
52:08 - available through NPM which means I
52:11 - should know how to do this but can I use
52:14 - like ol toxic lives okay oh that's
52:22 - examples the website yeah one package is
52:27 - this the library no that's this is the
52:32 - examples I mean I could just download it
52:35 - but I'm being stubborn toxic libs Jas
52:39 - there we go
52:42 - so there must be a way now somebody will
52:44 - tell me I can use that like uh none
52:47 - package.com slash something it'll just
52:50 - like automatically take me to it right
52:55 - this do it no no one will tell me nobody
53:02 - will tell me okay NPM wait I know how to
53:06 - do this ml five I can since ml five does
53:11 - this right it should work the same if I
53:16 - do unpackage comm slash well let's see
53:20 - toxic libs zero what was the version
53:26 - that was the latest zero point three
53:28 - point three zero point three point three
53:32 - and then it's probably just called let's
53:38 - see what happened so I do this in top
53:47 - right
53:49 - that doesn't help me version zero point
53:52 - three point three let's see
53:57 - cloud fair oh it's on cloud fair zero
54:01 - point one point three no but that seems
54:04 - like an old version I will try
54:12 - CD NJ s cloud fair okay bit ly / - OH -
54:25 - J - J M leoj89 es Mozart - many E's no
54:39 - just America want whomp bit ly bit ly /
54:49 - - j ml e OG want that doesn't work from
55:00 - terminal npm install' toxic lives plus j
55:04 - s oh this is going so well so far no I
55:12 - don't want to do npm install i'm
55:14 - avoiding doing npm install on purpose
55:16 - gosh darn it toxic lives dot j yes
55:23 - that's what I forgot
55:26 - No
55:31 - no just no dot seems weird though
55:41 - oh no but I want to do toxic lives yes
55:51 - jazz deliver ah there we go thank you
55:53 - violet saves the day
55:56 - Thank You violet w WJ s deliver dot-com
56:04 - slash package / NP m / toxic libs j s
56:11 - there we go and actually all I want is
56:15 - physics 2d I don't know that I need I
56:20 - don't need that I don't need you till in
56:23 - geometry so well okay this is helping me
56:29 - sort of how do I get a link I just want
56:34 - a link download I guess I could just
56:40 - download it I'm stubborn
56:42 - I refuse to download it it's hosted via
56:47 - a CDN different versions copy to
56:52 - clipboard copy URL oh I see
56:58 - great oh this is not this is not going
57:02 - well
57:02 - there's no built version of the package
57:05 - that's crazy but there's not one point
57:09 - 8k viewers what wait what's going on
57:14 - here I'm I'm not you know what I'm no
57:18 - longer to be stubborn why are all these
57:20 - people watching hello everybody welcome
57:24 - to the Kodi train thank you thank you
57:32 - I'm gonna coach stuff I swear I don't
57:35 - just sit here and
57:36 - read random numbers very sweaty very
57:40 - sweaty
57:40 - there's no built package it's okay
57:42 - everybody I know how to deal with this
57:48 - I'm gonna go to my nature of code
57:51 - examples where I keep a built version of
57:57 - the library which is here NFC examples
58:04 - p5.js libraries toxic libs
58:09 - do I have like a toxic libs helper thing
58:13 - let's see simple spring libraries toxic
58:17 - lips okay I'm just gonna use this I'm
58:21 - just gonna download this version of
58:22 - library I'm gonna have it local I have a
58:25 - built version look it's version zero
58:27 - point three point three Thank You Kyle
58:29 - Phillips apparently I've never had this
58:32 - many people watching the live stream
58:33 - before I'm kind of freaking out a little
58:36 - bit I'm gonna hit raw I think I should
58:40 - do like a probably a beginner tutorial
58:42 - or something not this fractal tree
58:46 - physics we're gonna make a new folder
58:48 - we're gonna call it libraries think I'm
58:50 - gonna get to the coding everybody I'm
58:52 - gonna do something I'm gonna be I'm
58:53 - gonna do meaningful stuff here I'm
58:54 - taking this very seriously all of a
58:56 - sudden I don't there's I made this toxic
59:01 - libs helper thing for the nature of code
59:03 - book where am I like I don't even
59:07 - remember where I was
59:10 - how's that how come that's gone I was on
59:12 - that page
59:16 - somebody must have like tweeted or
59:21 - something examples
59:24 - I don't think let me get that helper let
59:26 - me see what's in that helper thing so
59:28 - for the nature of codebook which for the
59:33 - examples I also made an extra file
59:35 - called toxic helper oh it doesn't really
59:38 - do anything you know what all it does is
59:40 - to make aliases to the classes I want to
59:43 - use so that every time I want to make
59:46 - like a gravity behavior or an attraction
59:48 - behavior I don't have to write toxic
59:49 - physics about 2d so this is actually
59:51 - useful so I will also save this and I
59:54 - will put this in libraries and then I
59:57 - can close all this stuff I can go back
60:01 - to the code and let's add these other
60:04 - libraries like I have like all bye
60:11 - notifications on do not disturb so I'm
60:14 - gonna go to toxic libs jf and what is it
60:19 - called toxic helper dot j s then I'm
60:24 - gonna hit refresh it doesn't find it
60:27 - because I made a folder called libraries
60:30 - so one of the unfortunate things about
60:32 - the way that I'm working right now is
60:34 - and if I were if I had a better setup I
60:37 - would probably do like a
60:38 - picture-in-picture type thing but I have
60:40 - to switch back and forth between the
60:42 - browser view and the code view it just
60:46 - lost like a hundred no surprise like a
60:49 - whole bunch of people came to me like
60:51 - somebody clearly told them like hey go
60:53 - check this out team trees National Art
60:55 - Day Foundation then everybody came like
60:59 - okay there's a very strange person just
61:01 - jabbering on and like searching for like
61:04 - a file that doesn't exist and just not
61:07 - refusing to give up that's me I also
61:10 - like to read from my book
61:13 - a million random digits with 100,000
61:19 - 100,000 normal deviates point negative
61:25 - 29 d2 0.60 2 also negative one point
61:29 - zero one seven point five zero nine
61:32 - point six six four point nine one seven
61:35 - point three one zero point one six okay
61:43 - everything's gonna be okay yeah I could
61:52 - have used that I could have just
61:53 - delivered those github links I know I
61:55 - know
61:55 - but I would have had to figure that out
61:57 - now would have taken me a while so where
61:59 - was I in this thing that's definitely
62:02 - getting edited later I went ahead and
62:09 - downloaded the files toxic lives and
62:12 - toxic helper KS those are built version
62:17 - toxic lives such as is a built version
62:20 - of the library that I'm using a local
62:22 - copy of and toxic helper KS is a
62:25 - JavaScript file that has toxic helper is
62:33 - a JavaScript file that I created for my
62:36 - examples from the nature of codebook
62:38 - that aliases some of the classes that I
62:40 - want to use from the toxic libs library
62:42 - so what is the next step here I have
62:45 - this code this code creates this idea of
62:48 - a branch a branch a branch is an object
62:55 - that has two points a and B and by
62:59 - definition a branch and I really did not
63:03 - draw this in a way that makes any sense
63:05 - a branch is an object that has two
63:11 - points a which is a vector X Y and B
63:14 - which is another vector X Y so this is B
63:17 - and this is a then I choose to draw a
63:20 - line between those two points after that
63:24 - each branch
63:26 - birth so to speak or to two branches
63:30 - that are connected from its point be it
63:32 - becomes the point a for those two new
63:34 - branches those get bees and so on and so
63:36 - forth this is the process of recursion
63:39 - this idea of a function in this case an
63:42 - object being defined according to itself
63:45 - a branch by definition is a line
63:48 - connected to two other branches and
63:50 - those two other branches by definition
63:51 - or lines connected to two other branches
63:53 - and those are lines connected to other
63:55 - branches and so on and so forth
63:56 - and by iterating over this list of
64:00 - branch objects and then drawing them in
64:02 - the window I have this particular
64:07 - pattern but it is a static pattern it is
64:15 - a static pattern it does not move it
64:17 - does not animate I have just basically
64:19 - calculated all of these points and drawn
64:21 - lines so what I want to attempt to do in
64:23 - this coding challenge is say in addition
64:27 - to a branch being a line between two
64:30 - points each point is going to be what's
64:33 - called a particle or in this case of Val
64:38 - a particle verlet particle 2d that's the
64:42 - technical term in the Toxic lives
64:44 - library so all of these are particles
64:46 - and this particular line is a spring
64:50 - connection so a spring is a you know as
64:54 - a entity of that that is a connection a
64:58 - joint what are some other words event an
65:00 - edge joint connection what's in matter
65:05 - da chance I could I could use matter Jas
65:07 - maybe I should have used matter Duchess
65:09 - yes whatever I'm using toxic limbs what
65:12 - not you the viewer will go make a
65:14 - version this would matter not chance
65:16 - after but it is a connection that has a
65:18 - bunch of properties like rest length at
65:23 - what what is its length at which it will
65:25 - come to rest right it um as well as a
65:28 - property called K the spring constant
65:31 - and that will by playing around with
65:34 - these values I'll get various amounts of
65:35 - springiness and elasticity to these
65:38 - connections
65:40 - alright alright so let's attempt to do
65:49 - this I don't remember how to do toxic
65:52 - libs
65:53 - wouldn't it be nice if there was like a
65:55 - tutorial for it somewhere nature of code
65:58 - calm read now physics library a toxic
66:03 - lives okay let's take a look here so the
66:14 - first thing that I need to do it looks
66:17 - like is make a physics world so I'm
66:21 - going to create a variable I'm going to
66:23 - call it physics and in setup I'm going
66:28 - to say physics equals new verlet physics
66:34 - 2d I think I need to say 2d like I can
66:39 - check by going into my libraries here
66:41 - verlet physics 2d so you can see this is
66:43 - what the helper does maybe this is a bad
66:45 - idea I don't know just puts these class
66:49 - names in the global space global
66:51 - namespace
66:52 - okay so I've made a physics world I can
66:57 - do things like set the world's bounds
66:59 - that might be a that's probably
67:00 - important for me to do let's do that why
67:04 - not so let's do this so and this I think
67:10 - this will still work I'm creating a
67:12 - rectangle that is defined by the canvas
67:15 - so the boundaries of this world are the
67:17 - canvas itself I'm not going to call
67:22 - physics update right now because I
67:24 - actually don't want to update the
67:26 - physics I just want to get the building
67:28 - blocks in place and slowly turn them on
67:31 - to see what happens so what I want to do
67:35 - is create a verlet particle 2d for every
67:40 - one of these points so how does this
67:43 - work how does my branch object work I
67:45 - have a beginning and an end
67:47 - so those when I make those
67:52 - they are I call create vector ah so what
67:58 - I'm doing to create the first the root
68:01 - of the tree we come back over here the
68:04 - root of the tree is a branch that
68:06 - connects these two starting points and
68:09 - right there there it is root equals
68:11 - branch between those two points I think
68:13 - what I want to do is change those points
68:16 - to make them verlet particles so instead
68:19 - of a plane p5 vector
68:22 - I'm gonna make them a verlet particle to
68:24 - D and a verlet particle to D now that's
68:29 - gonna break everything because all of
68:31 - the math and everything that I'm doing
68:32 - for the entire example depends on those
68:36 - two points being vectors P Phi vectors
68:40 - now there vernal at particles DD so I
68:42 - could like run the code and see where
68:44 - the first error I get is this dot set
68:46 - weight is not a function what so let's
68:51 - go do sketch jeaious line 13 what that's
68:56 - weird
68:58 - wait there's an error on this line Oh
69:03 - guess what I forgot I forgot the new
69:07 - keyword I am making an object I am
69:10 - calling the constructor of the Verla
69:12 - particle 2d class I must say nu nu nu
69:17 - now let me refresh again now this is
69:21 - good this is what I wanted to see happen
69:23 - derp da alt is not a function why is it
69:27 - not a function well what is derp what is
69:29 - mult so let's go look for branch J s
69:32 - line 21 and here interestingly enough it
69:36 - was fine with p5 Oh weird
69:41 - so this is very uncomfortable I think if
69:49 - I recall correctly I have something in
69:52 - my book that addresses what I want to
69:54 - talk about did not mean to be referring
69:56 - to this so much there was like a table
70:00 - like vector table thing
70:06 - that I know no all right I'm gonna not
70:11 - scroll forever and like drive you all
70:13 - insane let me let me talk about what's
70:18 - going on here
70:20 - so the original version that I wrote
70:25 - made use of something called a p5 vector
70:29 - and a p5 vector is a vector an entity
70:32 - with magnitude direction as an X
70:33 - component of Y component and it has a
70:35 - bunch of math operations and they're
70:37 - called things like add subtract multiply
70:41 - et cetera normalized I've lots of videos
70:44 - on this stuff I just made it instead of
70:46 - a p5 vector a verlan particle 2d a
70:48 - virulent particle 2d is actually an
70:51 - instance of something in toxic libs
70:53 - that's called a vex 2d guess what effect
70:56 - Judi is it's a simple vector but it's
70:59 - not p5 XP v vector it's toxic lives
71:02 - vector so my code will all still work
71:05 - just fine if I find the corresponding
71:09 - function in toxic lives that corresponds
71:12 - to things like multiply subtract add etc
71:15 - I kind of figure out where the
71:16 - documentation is because I think I got
71:18 - to look all this stuff up
71:27 - it looks like 800 viewers it's kind of
71:30 - hilarious it's still down and nuts that
71:32 - I have there's 1200 people watching here
71:34 - but alright so let me look what's the
71:37 - best place for me to look at the toxic
71:39 - lives documentation so is it on this
71:42 - website getting started toxic webs
71:47 - follows physics 2d I know how to find it
71:50 - differences from the original mmm github
71:55 - contributes rent bill I know where I
72:00 - think where I'm going to look I'm just
72:02 - going to go and look but toxic lives
72:05 - Javadoc this is crazy what I'm doing I
72:07 - probably should take a mulligan and go
72:11 - and use and go and use matter yes but
72:16 - I'm as you know me I'm stubborn so I'm
72:19 - in the jaw so this so I'm looking for
72:32 - this is the Java original Java libraries
72:35 - documentation and I'm just going to do
72:37 - the mental gymnastics to translate from
72:39 - that into JavaScript if you can enjoy
72:45 - [Music]
72:58 - okay it's okay everything's gonna be
73:00 - okay
73:00 - just go right past that back to D we can
73:04 - actually go to frames and then uh Boog
73:07 - that didn't work here we go
73:10 - I'm gonna look for ad so where where am
73:14 - I wearing my first P v vector dot sub so
73:17 - I think the equivalent of this will be
73:19 - this dot end
73:22 - dotsub this dot begin let's take a look
73:26 - at that sub so it subtracts vector V and
73:32 - returned the result as a new vector
73:35 - that's what I want so one of the things
73:36 - when working with these vectors it's a
73:38 - little bit tricky because sometimes you
73:40 - want to adjust the vector you're working
73:41 - with that's subtract self like subtract
73:44 - this from myself but toxic Libs when you
73:47 - call that sub it makes a new vector
73:49 - which is not al p v vector works very
73:51 - confusing I know that's okay
73:54 - now rotate this is just do that does it
73:58 - have a rotate function rotate all right
74:02 - I guess that works
74:05 - multiply I think it's just mu L I have a
74:08 - memory of it just being mu L scale is it
74:13 - called scale scale no whoa boat wait yes
74:21 - yes yes yes yes its scale
74:23 - cuz I'm not I'm not doing the dot
74:25 - product or vector multiplication I'm
74:27 - just taking a vector and multiplying it
74:29 - by a scale or a single number so if you
74:31 - think of a vector is this line
74:34 - represents the vector if I multiply it
74:36 - by two got that line if I multiply it by
74:39 - 0.5 I got that line and what the fractal
74:42 - code is actually doing is each branch is
74:44 - 2/3 the length of the previous one far
74:47 - so I'm scaling it by 0.67 scale new end
74:51 - is this dot and to add direction and
74:56 - then I make a new branch that should
74:58 - work that should be the same this is the
75:00 - recursion I branch out to make a new
75:03 - brand
75:05 - they only can make two branches I have
75:07 - branch a and branch B that is definitely
75:09 - an instance of but I'm just gonna keep
75:16 - going this is terrible that this is the
75:18 - faces will get code change that that
75:38 - looks good well I dare I say that's all
75:42 - I needed to do I got something wrong
75:54 - definitely got something wrong what did
75:56 - I get wrong
75:57 - looks like the scaling isn't working
75:59 - properly scale scale like I sort of feel
76:06 - like that's like if I comment this out
76:11 - same result what did I do wrong
76:15 - does it make a new scale self scale self
76:18 - scale self I bet you it's that I don't
76:21 - want to make a new vector that's scaled
76:23 - I want to scale myself there we go so I
76:29 - have now successfully recreated the
76:34 - fractal tree with berlet particles all
76:39 - right so interestingly enough those are
76:43 - all particles let's just test a little
76:46 - weird theory of mine if I think
76:50 - Berlet physics in toxic limbs will
76:52 - automatically add a default gravity it
76:55 - might not but I am going to oh this is
77:01 - weird I'm gonna take this out this is
77:02 - drawing a tree we're gonna definitely
77:04 - want to do some jittering and stuff I'm
77:06 - going to say physics dot update and what
77:09 - I expect to happen well what do you
77:11 - think is gonna happen if there's a
77:12 - default gravity and these are all just
77:15 - particles and
77:17 - online between them what's gonna happen
77:19 - give you a minute to think about it this
77:21 - is like how it works on brilliant org by
77:23 - the way you didn't like a puzzle I have
77:25 - to think about then you give the answer
77:30 - okay so the default gravity must not be
77:33 - there so let's add gravity and I believe
77:36 - the way that I do that is I say physics
77:39 - dot add I think I have to go back to the
77:41 - nature of code book to look this up yeah
77:47 - so let's do it like this so this is I
77:49 - can add a behavior to the world and I
77:51 - can add a gravity behavior and I can
77:54 - have a vector this is very confusing but
77:56 - there's like this is so what's happening
77:58 - here so the first thing I do is create a
77:59 - vector like say like zero negative 0.5
78:05 - or 0.5 which is like a vector that
78:07 - points down so this is the vector and I
78:10 - want to turn this into a gravity
78:11 - behavior meaning there's a force on
78:13 - everything pointing down and then we're
78:14 - to add that to the world meaning will PI
78:16 - that force to all of the particles
78:19 - so let's actually grab this code and go
78:25 - here just put that in here whoa no wrong
78:28 - code what a completely copy bases the
78:33 - wrong thing oh I'm not even in the right
78:37 - thing you know what the good news is oh
78:39 - there's no good news for you I'm just in
78:41 - the wrong camera I'll tell you about
78:42 - that later got some new recording
78:44 - systems all right so let me do this so
78:47 - I'm gonna add this here now I'm adding
78:49 - this gravity behavior and whoops you
78:56 - just I think I could give myself a
78:58 - little bit more room here to code yep
79:00 - I'm adding this gravity behavior now
79:02 - let's try this again
79:13 - [Music]
79:20 - to you to not have gravity gravity
79:23 - behavior 2d I don't think that's that
79:27 - doctor fine
79:29 - did I not save no hmm physics dot update
79:38 - physics dot update oh oh no no wait
79:43 - let's see mmm show no no mmm if you're
79:49 - adding to Berlet per branch will to ver
79:52 - let's be create so this is a great point
79:55 - I'm definitely gonna have to fix that
79:57 - update maybe needs a delta time maybe it
80:00 - does it does really particle - am I not
80:16 - what it could be that the physics is
80:18 - happening but I'm not drawing it
80:20 - correctly so I have like a secret no
80:26 - loop in there somewhere
80:27 - mmm very sad
80:30 - physics not bad behavior console dot log
80:35 - frame count let's just make sure the
80:37 - loop is happening the loop is happening
80:42 - all right let's be a little bit more
80:45 - debug e let's get rid of all these trees
80:49 - and let's let's just make a particle
80:53 - called PE
81:00 - and we'll put it in the middle of the
81:02 - window and then we will do this and draw
81:14 - it points
81:22 - all right so this is a good sign does it
81:27 - need at all the time I guess I could
81:29 - give it a delta time all right let's go
81:35 - look at my examples
81:37 - never hurts to look at an example where
81:53 - am I going this is not this is the book
81:55 - and one with the examples libraries
82:01 - toxic lives let's just look at this one
82:04 - [Music]
82:06 - so I did okay how do you know what it's
82:12 - weird that it's oh no hmm no I don't
82:18 - think mm-hmm
82:19 - I think I might know what the problem is
82:23 - I think I think I know what the problem
82:25 - is
82:26 - just hold on so I'm thinking but no but
82:30 - then I did it it's weird
82:35 - let's just look at the sketch really
82:39 - physical behavior set world's bounds
82:48 - does I mean couldn't really be that like
82:51 - adding the behavior first makes a
82:53 - difference Oh Oh weird you know what I
83:03 - have this suspicion I'm making a new
83:06 - Verla particle by passing in the X&Y I
83:13 - think toxic Libs wants me to do this why
83:16 - it worked anyway to draw in the right
83:18 - place no that doesn't seem to make a
83:23 - difference
83:24 - I'm just take more drastic measures in a
83:27 - second to make sure my example is
83:30 - actually working well let's make sure
83:33 - this example works let's go grab this
83:41 - repo which I'm sure I already have but
84:05 - okay so the gravity is definitely
84:07 - working in this example so gravity does
84:10 - work at trees to cons everybody's
84:25 - telling me everybody's telling me
84:26 - everybody's telling me everybody's
84:27 - telling me every oh sell me I know what
84:29 - it is everybody relax
84:31 - I got it got it if you make a particle
84:41 - the particle does not live in the world
84:44 - unless you put the particle in the world
84:46 - if you plant a tree if you put a seed in
84:50 - the ground if you do not water it I
84:52 - don't know what the right metaphor is
84:54 - here it's not really fitting but I do
84:56 - need to say physics dot add particle
85:00 - that particle and then goodbye goodbye
85:07 - all right so now what I was expecting to
85:10 - see let's take this out take this back
85:15 - out and the whiteboard camera just went
85:19 - off I don't know why probably because
85:20 - it's overheating put this back in and
85:27 - what I need to do whenever I make a
85:31 - branch whenever I make a branch I need
85:35 - to where do I make the particles
85:38 - interesting this is weird
85:48 - there is no do I never copy this is
85:54 - weird something weird is going on here
85:55 - in that I've only made this is the only
85:59 - place where I make the particle and then
86:06 - and then when I make a new branch oh
86:11 - this is a problem so I'm not this is
86:17 - weird
86:18 - I'm the particles are just pointing to
86:21 - each other I'm so confused no this is
86:26 - making a new particle I see the end is a
86:29 - new particle and the beginning is the
86:33 - same particle so this is actually
86:34 - correct
86:34 - this is making a new particle here so
86:37 - olan let's just one step at a time this
86:39 - is confusing because this looks like the
86:41 - only place I'm making a new particle but
86:43 - let me say physics dot add particle a
86:46 - and physics dot add particle B and P is
86:55 - not define cuz I don't need that anymore
86:59 - I'm gonna just take out the point one
87:01 - just let it do its default time step
87:04 - look at that so only it only fell right
87:07 - there because that's the only particle I
87:10 - added into the physics world so where
87:12 - are the other particles only other time
87:15 - I'm actually making a particle is in
87:17 - this new end the rest this is some
87:20 - vector math and the new branch gets a
87:23 - reference to its current end it doesn't
87:26 - actually make a new particle that's very
87:27 - important because I want everything to
87:29 - stay connected so this I've actually
87:31 - written the code in a thoughtful way
87:33 - where this will work properly all I need
87:35 - to do is say physics dot add particle
87:38 - new end and then right here
87:43 - physics dot add particle new end now
87:45 - let's see what happens okay I don't like
87:53 - that don't like that PETA add forces not
87:58 - a fun
87:59 - oh it's not a verlet particle this has
88:07 - made a Veck 2d so I need to say new ver
88:13 - let particle boy this was much more
88:16 - complicated than I imagined it would be
88:18 - apologies to everybody watching I need
88:21 - to wrap the end this is very confusing
88:24 - because what I toxic lives is using this
88:26 - this turned out to be a bit of a
88:28 - sophisticated coding challenge which
88:30 - requires quite a bit of facility and
88:34 - experience with object-oriented
88:36 - programming inheritance inheritance is a
88:38 - feature of object-oriented programming
88:40 - where objects can pull properties from
88:43 - other objects and so I made a Veck 2d
88:46 - that's not a ver let particle a ver let
88:48 - particle is a vector D but effect
88:50 - because it inherits from vector D but if
88:52 - vector D is not a ver let particle so
88:54 - because I made a vector D I need to make
88:56 - it a ver let particle and I can do the
88:58 - same thing here and now I can hit
89:03 - refresh and there we go that is the
89:07 - wierdest collapsing tree ever so the
89:12 - good news is this is not what I wanted
89:14 - to accomplish all you know just having a
89:17 - single gravity force they all fall in
89:19 - exactly the same rate I don't want it to
89:21 - fall I wanted to stay standing up so
89:24 - let's take out that gravity behavior
89:28 - right now and let's take a look I have
89:33 - my tree again let me also remove the
89:35 - number of iterations there's too much
89:37 - detail here maybe I want ultimately all
89:39 - that detail but right now it's too much
89:42 - and I'm about halfway through so I'm
89:44 - going to take a break
89:45 - to talk about brilliant the sponsor of
89:49 - today's livestream and also remind you
89:51 - about team trees kind of like the second
89:53 - sponsor we've got two sponsors today but
89:56 - what was I doing I took that out oh yeah
89:58 - no I wanted to change the number of
90:00 - iterations let's just go down to six so
90:03 - I want to work with the physics with
90:05 - fewer points and lines and then once
90:09 - that's working maybe I could add more
90:12 - so people are telling me about live
90:14 - server and I do know sometimes I do use
90:18 - live server though very rarely on a live
90:19 - stream but actually I'd like to
90:21 - explicitly refresh the browser because
90:24 - sometimes I don't want the change to be
90:26 - seen I want to change the code and talk
90:28 - about a little bit and then have it be
90:30 - seen so I like to have full control okay
90:40 - all right let me have a little water 6
90:48 - o'clock so I want to take a minute
91:01 - even the by the way in the last 40
91:03 - minutes I lost a thousand just kind of
91:09 - crazy hi Elias um I want to talk to you
91:13 - about brilliant org brilliant org is a
91:17 - website that I really enjoy using let me
91:24 - show you a bit about the homepage so
91:28 - becoming great at math science and
91:29 - computer science does not have to be
91:31 - dull hopefully that's something that
91:32 - you've discovered by watching this
91:34 - particular YouTube channel I mean I
91:37 - maybe I guess I think probably I'm not
91:39 - dull I have a lot of faults
91:41 - yeah I'm dull in many instances though
91:44 - you can find me irritating I suppose
91:46 - anyway moving on but brilliant
91:48 - it's a problem-solving website with a
91:50 - hands-on approach it has 60 interactive
91:53 - courses I like to really show you what
91:56 - just all of these courses are there's
91:59 - one the ones that I'm that are
92:00 - particularly most relevant although all
92:02 - of these are things you could really
92:04 - find as forming the basis of stuff that
92:07 - you might want to code but there's a
92:08 - computer science fundamentals course
92:11 - there's logic courses there's number
92:13 - theory a trigonometry oh boy you really
92:17 - need the trigonometry course if you're
92:20 - watching the coding train because they
92:21 - have being comfortable with sine and
92:23 - cosine and tangent those functions and
92:25 - polar coordinates
92:26 - is really necessary so brilliant is
92:30 - built for ambitious and curious people
92:32 - who want to excel at problem-solving and
92:34 - understand the world and one of the two
92:37 - things I love the most about brilliant
92:39 - there's many things that I do enjoy and
92:41 - if I come back to here for a second and
92:43 - just pull up the website is one is in in
92:48 - the courses and in the challenges are
92:50 - many ideas for me to try to code things
92:54 - and I having done 150 plus coding
92:57 - challenges I run out of ideas so there's
93:00 - so much content on brilliant that I can
93:02 - find lots of new ideas the other thing
93:03 - that I love is just if I have a little
93:06 - extra time on my hands I like to do
93:07 - these daily challenges and this one I
93:10 - looked at it earlier I didn't solve it
93:13 - although I think I have an idea of how
93:15 - to solve it let me hold on I'm my view
93:19 - is a little bit off and I think I can
93:21 - take this off right now as well so so
93:28 - this is today's challenge and by the way
93:29 - if you want to follow along with this go
93:31 - to brilliant org slash coding train you
93:33 - can sign up for free and you could do
93:35 - all the daily challenges for free right
93:37 - there on the website you can add your
93:39 - own answer you can add your own
93:40 - explanation if you want to unlock all of
93:42 - the courses you can sign up for a
93:44 - premium subscription and you can get a
93:45 - discount by going through that coding
93:48 - train link the first 200 people will get
93:49 - a 20% discount so what I like about this
93:52 - challenge is it's like a puzzle so this
93:54 - is a little but nice puzzle we got a
93:56 - grid here and I need everything in row
93:58 - zoom in on this a little bit more so I
94:00 - can point to it better I need everything
94:04 - in this top row to add up to six this
94:06 - first column to add up to four and so on
94:09 - and so forth and these are the numbers
94:11 - that I have to work with so I need to
94:12 - place them somewhere so if I'm going to
94:14 - solve something like this first I could
94:16 - just take around and try it that's
94:18 - that's probably the best way is like be
94:19 - like a well I put the three here well if
94:21 - I put a 3 here and I put a 2 here that's
94:24 - 708 and that's no good then I don't have
94:26 - to put a 1 here but look at this I just
94:28 - unlocked a little clue how to solve this
94:30 - I would have look for things that have
94:33 - only one possibility it's always a good
94:35 - way to start right here this column has
94:37 - to add up to sick
94:38 - and I've lost the chat so let me by
94:40 - sorry about this everybody wrong Mouse
94:42 - and pull the chat up so ah sorry folks
94:53 - go back to me come back to me
94:55 - puzzle grid so the only thing that can
94:57 - go there is a what how to put this one
94:59 - here so like oh come on well look let's
95:03 - reset I think I did something like weird
95:06 - there we go
95:07 - so you can see this lights up because
95:09 - I've had it add up to 6
95:11 - so what else only has one possibility so
95:13 - 2 plus 1 is 3 to get 7 I could do a
95:16 - bunch of different things I could do
95:18 - tutus I could do 1 into 3 there's a
95:21 - bunch of ways I could get 7 out of 3
95:22 - numbers here 2 to get 4 ok I can only
95:29 - put ones here and this is good because I
95:30 - got to use up my ones where the only
95:32 - possible thing here there's no way
95:33 - there's no zero so I can't put another
95:35 - to it 3 would get me to 5 so huh know
95:39 - why I'm having trouble there we go I
95:40 - just so what I like about this is I
95:42 - would love to actually you could make
95:44 - this in p5 so this could be a coding
95:46 - challenge like make a puzzle generator
95:48 - that has all I mean this is really hard
95:50 - to do all this drag-and-drop a nice
95:52 - little interface and haven't been to
95:53 - really hard to program this kind of
95:55 - stuff I would probably make a much you
95:57 - know like a more crude version of this
96:00 - it just has that is this thoughtful in
96:02 - terms of user interaction design but now
96:04 - now we're getting somewhere
96:05 - so is there are there other places where
96:07 - I only have one option by the way the
96:11 - reason why I'm looking at this is
96:12 - because the the question here is how
96:14 - many different ways can this puzzle
96:16 - puzzle be completed so thing is like how
96:18 - many solutions can I find knows anybody
96:21 - knows you can you can say alright and
96:26 - Simon is reminding me that the you do
96:28 - the daily challenges for free and
96:29 - actually the 7 latest daily challenges
96:31 - are for free but the you need the
96:33 - premium subscription for the archive of
96:35 - them Thank You Simon Simon is like my
96:37 - brilliant sponsor assistant
96:40 - appreciate that all right what else here
96:48 - this is nine okay I think I have to put
96:52 - to get nine
96:53 - I need a three and a two
96:57 - can I put those in any place so I could
97:00 - put them here so now I'm just like
97:03 - trying and then if this is seven I needs
97:07 - a 3 in a 2 and this is 5 a little no I
97:12 - just thing we're on aah so that doesn't
97:14 - work
97:15 - no no no no I'm fine was I just do three
97:19 - right because yeah a 1 goes here and a 1
97:23 - goes here yeah I did it I solved it so
97:26 - there's one solution there's at least
97:28 - one solution did this in sort of a weird
97:30 - way what happens where was I with this
97:44 - sure there's a scientific way of doing
97:46 - this let me go back to what this is
97:49 - where I was where I knew these are the
97:51 - only possibilities so what did what did
97:55 - I do next
97:56 - clearly forgot didn't I put like a three
98:00 - and a two ow
98:01 - camera I should turn the so apologies
98:06 - for this the camera I'm going to turn
98:08 - the fan on this nice fan to cool down
98:11 - the camera I can turn it back on the
98:16 - focus I might lose the focus let's see
98:22 - I think actually the focus stayed this
98:24 - time whatever I did on the camera keeps
98:27 - the focus which is good
98:28 - yeah I'm still in focus right I think so
98:31 - um everyone solve this I should just do
98:37 - these in advance it would make my life
98:38 - much easier bottom rows swap the two and
98:40 - the three people are telling me wait
98:44 - hold on okay
98:45 - oh hey that's what I was doing let's
98:46 - let's do it scientifically so let's say
98:49 - I put the 3 and the 2 here that's 9 so
98:52 - now I think there's probably only gonna
98:54 - be one way for me to do this my
98:56 - intuition tells me that because if I've
98:57 - got to get 9 I need so if I gotta get 7
99:02 - I need the the 3 plus 2 plus 2 what no I
99:10 - need the three in the one the only thing
99:12 - is I can put here the 3 and the one I
99:13 - can't put the 3 here the 3 has to go
99:16 - here the one has to go here ok and this
99:19 - is going to get me back to this solution
99:21 - and now the 1 has to go here and the 2
99:24 - has to go here okay well what no no no
99:28 - no no the 2 has to go wait so maybe
99:38 - there is no solution if I put the 3 in
99:41 - the 2 like this
99:43 - the focus is no good let's check I have
99:47 - a special way of focusing that looks
99:52 - pretty good actually
99:57 - it's a little bit off you're right and
99:59 - fix it a little bit
100:03 - [Music]
100:05 - wait okay that added up to nine so to
100:09 - get to five this has to be a three in a
100:12 - two and I can't put the three there
100:18 - because that would already be six okay
100:21 - so this has to be a two and this has to
100:24 - be a three no and this has to be a one
100:30 - so then that's four that's seven that's
100:36 - all right
100:37 - so that was a solution with the three on
100:40 - the right and the two there so let's
100:42 - take everything off two one one three
100:48 - three two and let's try putting the 3
100:51 - here and the 2 here now can I still get
100:54 - a solution I need a 2 and a 1 to get to
100:57 - 5 and to get to 7 I need a 3 and a 2 so
101:03 - the 3 can't go here so the 2 has to go
101:06 - here the 3 has to go here and then to
101:10 - get to 7 the 1 goes to get the 6 the 1
101:14 - goes here and then a 1 goes here
101:17 - yep okay there's definitely two
101:18 - solutions there's two solutions can I
101:25 - get an idol I think those were the only
101:27 - so I don't want to belabor this there's
101:30 - probably way to make this provable but
101:31 - I'm pretty sure that as I was solving it
101:34 - there was no way to go and there were no
101:37 - there was no like branch
101:38 - this is relates to trees because really
101:39 - what I'm doing is like or they're right
101:41 - here now they're more than one options I
101:43 - could take let's try them both maybe one
101:45 - hits a dead end but I think all the
101:47 - while though I had to put things in
101:49 - certain places so I think the answer is
101:51 - 2 I'm not going to hit submit just yet
101:54 - what I'm gonna do is I am going to take
101:58 - a little break you I would ask you to
102:03 - work on this sign up for billion org
102:06 - thank you for billion org for sponsoring
102:08 - the coding train as
102:10 - is a fundraiser for team trees I will be
102:13 - donating the sponsorship fee from
102:15 - brilliant
102:16 - to the net to the Arbor Foundation
102:18 - through the team trees initiative so
102:21 - thank you so much for being for for
102:23 - sponsoring the coding train so that I
102:24 - can participate in this fundraiser and
102:26 - give money as well so I'm gonna take a
102:29 - short break for like no more than five
102:32 - minutes let's see fact check me on this
102:35 - signup for brilliant org make a donation
102:39 - to T at team trees or go through the
102:41 - donate button that's part of the
102:42 - fundraiser and I'll be back to finish
102:43 - the coding challenge in about five
102:45 - minutes so I'm gonna mute my microphone
102:49 - [Music]
102:53 - I'm gonna move my microphone to make
102:55 - myself disappear and I'm gonna get some
102:57 - water take a little break and be back
103:00 - and refresh
103:03 - [Music]
103:13 - [Music]
103:19 - [Music]
103:52 - [Music]
103:58 - [Music]

106:24 - [Music]
106:53 - [Music]
107:03 - [Music]
108:10 - [Music]
108:17 - I'm gonna say once again coordinates
108:27 - [Music]
108:30 - can we justify warming the Cartesian
108:33 - coordinates
108:43 - [Music]
108:48 - auto-tuned and the internet will fix
108:51 - that
109:00 - coordinates
109:02 - [Music]
109:08 - coordinates
109:19 - [Music]
109:21 - as always I always forget
109:34 - [Music]
110:03 - [Music]
110:17 - this never forget this stop I'm gonna do
110:23 - this this dot this dot this star this
110:26 - star song never forget the Vista but
110:28 - somebody composed that song for me
111:31 - sorry everybody now you can hear me I
111:33 - was saying I took a little bit of a
111:35 - longer break than usual cuz I got very
111:37 - warm in here
111:38 - so I propped open the door and I turned
111:41 - all the lights out that's why it looks
111:42 - kind of dark in here
111:43 - so I'm going to turn the lights back on
111:47 - and everyone's saying muted no sound you
111:55 - will realize that I have fixed that in a
111:57 - second the lights are back on and
112:02 - putting this down here my keys in my
112:04 - pocket I am back and so here I am and I
112:13 - am here to give this a try so I was like
112:17 - keeping an eye on the chat and there
112:18 - were so many interesting things that
112:20 - people said about this puzzle how to
112:22 - solve it somebody said you could solve
112:23 - it with green and dissent which I have
112:26 - no idea how that would work but other
112:29 - people were talking about how you can
112:30 - use like a backtracking algorithm and
112:33 - you're absolutely right I didn't see a
112:34 - lot of people give me an answer so I'm
112:40 - just gonna hope that my answer like
112:42 - answer two is correct let's see
112:48 - we go correct alright so thank you so
112:56 - much - brilliant
112:58 - org tri brilliant for free at brilliant
113:01 - org slash coding train you can do the
113:03 - daily challenge you can post you can
113:05 - read about what actually what I really
113:07 - liked one of the things I love doing is
113:09 - there's always so many really
113:11 - interesting discussions about how to
113:13 - solve this stuff I mean just look at the
113:15 - time people put in to explaining
113:18 - different ways with screenshots and
113:20 - diagrams to solve these puzzles that is
113:22 - something that I really do love so I
113:23 - encourage you to put your own there
113:24 - sometimes I'll make a p5 sketch and
113:26 - paste it in that's something you could
113:27 - do and thank you to play org for
113:30 - sponsoring today's fundraiser for team
113:32 - trees the sponsorship 3 is being donated
113:36 - to the team trees fundraiser so if you
113:41 - feel so inclined you could make a
113:42 - donation as well all right I'm going to
113:47 - what am I doing here turn that off and
113:49 - close this window and we are back we are
113:54 - back to the coding challenges 6:20 have
113:57 - I been streaming for almost two hours I
113:59 - think this is gonna probably take if I'm
114:02 - being totally honest another hour but
114:04 - hopefully less hopefully less so I can
114:10 - close some of this other stuff here I'm
114:12 - gonna leave that opens I might need it
114:15 - and here we go
114:25 - was that 100k in an hour I so I can't
114:30 - actually see what the tally is nor can I
114:33 - see Wow many donations that have come in
114:36 - through this livestream can you see that
114:41 - maybe you can't maybe if I actually hold
114:43 - on if you'll feel humor me for a second
114:45 - I do have a dashboard here I used to
114:47 - keep try a second laptop you'll notice
114:50 - there's no second laptop anymore it
114:52 - doesn't even exist but I do have a
114:54 - monitor over here that I can look at
114:56 - where I'm running open broadcast studio
114:58 - and if I go over here I go to this
115:02 - dashboard mmm no I don't see anything so
115:08 - I'm afraid to press buttons here I still
115:11 - can't figure out what caused suddenly a
115:14 - thousand more people to join I when I
115:18 - was taking my break I like looked at my
115:20 - phone and started to check like Twitter
115:21 - or like but I didn't see any kind of
115:24 - notification or share or anything like
115:26 - that so but yeah David is saying the
115:32 - total tally is three hundred sixty-five
115:34 - thousand which is kind of amazing I mean
115:36 - I'm a tiny little morsel here I think
115:38 - there's there's many many channels or
115:41 - all releasing videos and participating
115:43 - this fundraiser today I believe it was
115:45 - its mr. beast who started this
115:47 - initiative I do have a little document
115:50 - that I have here for reference team
115:54 - trees started in May 2000 nineteen when
115:57 - the internet internet challenged mr.
116:00 - beast at rant plant 20 million trees to
116:02 - commemorate hitting the 20 million
116:03 - subscriber milestone fans then suggested
116:06 - he band together with a bunch of other
116:07 - youtubers blah blah blah and the
116:12 - donations are going to the Arbor Day
116:13 - Foundation
116:15 - they are the longest-running tree
116:18 - planting NGO with 47 years of experience
116:20 - and they have the same Charity Navigator
116:22 - rating as the American rate Red Cross
116:24 - the donations either through team trees
116:27 - or guts where I made my donation or the
116:29 - YouTube donate button or Arbor days team
116:32 - trees Facebook fundraiser
116:36 - are sent directly to the Arbor Day
116:38 - Foundation to fund tree planting $1
116:40 - plants one tree depending on your local
116:43 - laws it could be a tax-deductible
116:45 - donation and the trees will be planted
116:50 - in a variety of forests on public and
116:52 - private lands in areas of great need the
116:55 - goal is to plant trees on every
116:57 - continent not named Antarctica and their
116:59 - Arbor Day foundation's website can I get
117:01 - to that has a list I think I'm looking
117:04 - at different computer computer so I have
117:06 - a dog but I'm not going to read all this
117:07 - to you but if you have other questions
117:09 - please go to the team trees website and
117:15 - the team trees says it's 1.1 million
117:18 - maybe because more donations that come
117:20 - through the website itself all right so
117:24 - back to the coding so if anybody know
117:31 - I'm just out of because I'm you know you
117:33 - can't it's very hard to be a person who
117:35 - does YouTube livestream makes YouTube
117:37 - videos and not suffer from some amount
117:40 - of vanity and I suffer from a large
117:42 - amount of vanity probably if I'm being
117:44 - totally honest and I am quite curious
117:48 - holy I gotta lock see I'm gonna get to
117:50 - your question I am quite curious as to
117:54 - if whether there was some kind of
117:56 - mention about the coding train somewhere
117:58 - that's sent like a whole bunch of people
117:59 - that then promptly left and did any of
118:02 - you stay maybe you're still here from
118:04 - that then you never heard of the coding
118:05 - train and you're watching right now if
118:07 - so say in the chat so yah Twilio Loxy
118:10 - are you asking about this song this song
118:14 - is called Tori the dog and it is by a
118:19 - composer named Adam Blau Adam spelled ad
118:23 - AM and blouse spelled BL a you Adam
118:26 - isn't an old friend from college he is a
118:29 - film and television composer I believe
118:31 - he does the music for a lot of different
118:33 - things but most recently for the FX show
118:35 - you're the worst and this is a piece of
118:39 - music he wrote for something else that
118:41 - he lets me use Adam is the composer for
118:43 - Oh train theme song and so I think you
118:47 - could reach out to him on Twitter Adam
118:48 - Blau if I don't think this song is
118:50 - published anywhere I mean I have the mp3
118:52 - file of it right here that's it but
118:55 - maybe you can get in touch to make a
118:56 - mini version of it okay
119:02 - all right anyone anyone in the chat I'm
119:06 - curious are you here
119:07 - for the first time and not just this is
119:10 - your first live stream but you had never
119:13 - heard of the coding train before today
119:15 - I'm curious to hear from you
119:17 - what did you hear here where'd you hear
119:18 - about the coding train but that aside I
119:21 - am going to I still have the fan on I
119:27 - don't think it's causing too much of a
119:30 - noise problem so I'm going to move on
119:33 - yes everyone's putting on coding garden
119:36 - with CJ donated $100 to the National
119:40 - Arbor Day Foundation I mean if there
119:41 - ever was a channel that aligns with team
119:46 - trees in its philosophy and its design
119:51 - branding it's the coding garden I mean
119:54 - technically is a garden where you have a
119:56 - tree that's more of like a forest to you
119:58 - you might have to be the coding forest
120:00 - but you've got tree growing plants it's
120:05 - good and my small little and and you can
120:09 - see cut nobody knows how to use tree
120:11 - related emojis better than CJ and the
120:14 - coding gardens so please check out the
120:16 - coding garden many many other CJ streams
120:23 - quite often at least nowadays I'm just
120:25 - getting notifications almost every day
120:26 - there's all these kind of tutorials
120:28 - especially like back-end stuff that I
120:29 - don't do so much very thoughtful and
120:32 - organized tutorials okay
120:37 - in coding garden with CJ's in the chat
120:40 - I'm sure you could ask CJ of questions
120:42 - about the channel if you want no now
120:43 - press my to chew button and you will
120:46 - know how long the delay is because I
120:48 - just pressed it then and it appeared
120:52 - all right I'm procrastinating again I do
120:55 - want to go home it's Friday I'm kind of
120:57 - like a bit of a baseball nerd you know I
120:59 - don't know I think I'm Astros national
121:01 - about my team's but I'm excited to watch
121:05 - the World Series game is at 8 so I at
121:08 - least want to get home by then all right
121:14 - the next step that I want to try is not
121:18 - just have particles
121:20 - oh sorry everybody no signal let's turn
121:24 - this back on I'll see if the focus is
121:29 - okay should come alive in a second how's
121:34 - the focus on here it's probably this I
121:37 - think it's the same look good yeah it's
121:42 - fine okay instead of just having two
121:50 - particles and drawing a line to
121:52 - visualize the connection between those
121:54 - particles I won't you actually make a
121:56 - physics object that connects them and
121:59 - the kind of object I'm going to use is a
122:00 - spring so I've made many other video
122:04 - tutorial ins and many other I have at
122:06 - least one I've used toxic lip springs
122:08 - and a bunch of other video tutorials to
122:10 - do like a cloth simulation and other
122:12 - things that you could refer to but
122:14 - basically we've got a spongy elastic
122:16 - connection when I pull it I'm stretching
122:19 - it the force is going to go back in when
122:21 - I push it I'm compressing it and the
122:23 - force is gonna push it back out to its
122:25 - rest length
122:32 - so where do I want to add the spring I
122:35 - think it's going to be as simple as
122:39 - every time I make a branch I need to
122:41 - create a spring that connects the two
122:44 - particles this dot begin and this dot
122:46 - end
122:46 - so let me look at one of my old examples
122:49 - where I make a spring
123:09 - so this is some code that I pulled up
123:12 - from one of my nature of code examples
123:13 - where I make a string a spring a verlet
123:15 - spring 2d that connects two particles p1
123:18 - and p2
123:18 - it has a rest length the length at which
123:21 - it is at rest and then a strength or
123:24 - maybe that's the the number for K the
123:26 - spring constant I don't know exactly
123:28 - what it means that I can tune that
123:30 - number up and down to affect its
123:32 - elasticity we could probably look in the
123:34 - toxic lip stop documentation to read
123:36 - exactly what that means but we'll just
123:37 - tinker around so I think this should be
123:39 - let me actually just grab this I should
123:43 - be able to say make a spring connect
123:47 - this stop begin this dot end and the O
123:55 - what should the rest length be well the
124:00 - rest length should be the distance
124:02 - between the actual length of thus of the
124:05 - branch because I'm tree building the
124:07 - tree at rest and when I give it a little
124:09 - push maybe a little the branch is kind
124:10 - of I mean trees don't actually have
124:13 - Springs in them so I don't get me wrong
124:16 - this is not a realistic simulation
124:18 - I'm just trying out this idea to make it
124:20 - kind of to see what happens so it's a
124:27 - little bit unfortunate that when I make
124:29 - the branch I do have that distance yeah
124:35 - I think what I'm going to do is this is
124:39 - this is probably a little redundant and
124:41 - I could optimize later but I'm just
124:43 - gonna calculate the distance by saying
124:47 - the distance between this dot and X and
124:50 - why
125:01 - so I'm getting the distance between the
125:04 - beginning point of the end point and
125:06 - then that's the rest length and the
125:11 - spring constant I mean I'm just going to
125:13 - leave it at 0.01 since that was in one
125:16 - of my examples and then I want to say
125:18 - physics dot add spring spring so let's
125:25 - just see if this at least gives me no
125:27 - errors okay it works now here's the
125:36 - thing that's interesting what happens if
125:38 - I pull on one of them what if I just
125:42 - take one of these end points and I
125:45 - attach and I move it with the mouse so
125:49 - you can see in my example the way that I
125:51 - did this in my example is I'll like lock
125:54 - a particle I don't know that I need to
125:57 - do this but I can basically like
125:59 - override its XY position and set it to
126:01 - the mouse so if I go into drum you just
126:03 - copy this and I'll do like if mouse is
126:06 - pressed also I'm just to see if the
126:09 - physics is active I'm gonna write here
126:13 - so tree tree is an array that has all of
126:16 - the branches in it so let me just pull
126:19 - the very last one I could say can I say
126:24 - pop but that's gonna actually take it
126:26 - out of the array I'm just gonna access
126:28 - it by tree length minus 1 so that's the
126:31 - like last this is the last particle in
126:35 - the tree and I can say last dot lock if
126:42 - the mouse is pressed
126:51 - let me do exactly this set it to the
126:54 - mouse and unlock it okay here we go
126:57 - this is gonna be a little bit nuts I
126:59 - really have no idea what's gonna happen
127:01 - which one do we think it is is it down
127:03 - here or is it like over here let's a
127:06 - little last not lock is not a function
127:08 - oh it's a branch it's a branch that's an
127:14 - array of branches I want to take the
127:16 - particle that's at the end tree dot
127:19 - length dot end the particle is what I
127:22 - want to lock and there we go three with
127:42 - physics actually that's pretty cool
127:50 - all right mm I had a dampening force no
127:58 - actually I honestly have no idea what to
127:59 - do next I mean I want to lock the
128:02 - alright here's here's something I
128:03 - actually want to do let's lock the root
128:10 - so let's say a dot lock that very first
128:15 - particle should never move let's just
128:17 - try that right so there we go so that's
128:24 - kind of interesting if the tree has no
128:27 - structure to it whatsoever but it's kind
128:35 - of this is kind of fun how can I make
128:39 - this feel more tree like I mean like
128:40 - should I put gravity back in I need like
128:44 - some kind of dampening I need to like
128:47 - sort of hold itself up I kind of have an
128:50 - idea and I should mention that a lot of
128:53 - this is coming from that skittish coming
128:55 - in case this gets edited later say a lot
128:58 - of my ideas are inspired by a project by
129:01 - Martine Bravo called skittish tree that
129:04 - he worked on while he was a student here
129:05 - at ITP where I teach and I'm and if I
129:11 - recall correctly one of the things he
129:12 - did with that project was connect some
129:15 - of the end points to the top with
129:19 - Springs to hold up the tree but not draw
129:23 - those Springs so that's something I
129:24 - could try
129:26 - you could try and limit the rotation of
129:29 - the joints put name o negative gravity
129:32 - is such a smart idea why I didn't think
129:34 - of that I love this idea let's try that
129:37 - let's put the gravity behavior in for a
129:41 - second and just see what happens that's
129:44 - kind of fun look at that tree falling
129:48 - down
129:48 - all right let's this is by the way
129:52 - whoever sent a thousand people here
129:54 - maybe now is a good time to send us
129:56 - because I think this is kind of the
129:58 - interesting part to try to get this tree
129:59 - to do something let's make the gravity
130:01 - much weaker and go in the opposite
130:04 - direction okay ah look at that so this
130:09 - is actually in a way already what I sort
130:12 - of wanted to see the tree is kind of
130:14 - almost like swaying in the wind just by
130:17 - the nature of the spring forces and this
130:20 - sort of force that's pushing up one
130:24 - thing that I think would be really
130:25 - effective here is that you can add just
130:28 - like there's a global gravity behavior
130:30 - you can add an attraction behavior to
130:33 - the particles meaning they can attract
130:35 - each other and who had a negative one
130:37 - they can repel each other so if all the
130:39 - particles have a slight repulsion force
130:41 - then it won't allow them to get too
130:43 - close to each other so let me try adding
130:45 - that so when I create a particle a
130:49 - branch and and possibly would make sense
130:55 - for me to in many ways to lock both of
130:58 - these I mean what am i making is it a
131:01 - tree like that's now like the trunk is
131:04 - like really locked in place I don't know
131:05 - if that's a meaningful improvement but
131:08 - let me try adding let me try adding this
131:14 - attraction behavior so if I go to the
131:15 - branch object
131:16 - maile this jitter
131:18 - it's not being used let's take that out
131:21 - the branch is where I create the spring
131:24 - out of these two verlet particles so I
131:27 - think I could also say let repulsion
131:31 - equals new attraction behavior I
131:36 - honestly have no idea just speculate a
131:39 - new vet oh and I think I just give it a
131:41 - strength yeah
131:43 - wait let me look this up let me go back
131:45 - to the documentation and let me try to
131:48 - find let me go to where's the physics
132:00 - one I'm in core okay good I want to go
132:06 - into verlet physics attraction behavior
132:08 - oh I give it oh I give it the particle I
132:17 - don't add the behavior I there's so many
132:24 - things like there's a jitter parameter
132:25 - radius and strength okay I think what I
132:30 - do is I create a new attraction behavior
132:33 - I put it on the particle like this dot
132:37 - begin I give it a radius let's just say
132:43 - like 40 and a strength negative 1 so
132:49 - let's let's say repulsion 1 and
132:53 - repulsion 2 is on the end now do I have
132:58 - to add those I must say physics add
133:00 - behavior right
133:14 - repulsion one repulsion - let's see if
133:17 - this does what I think it's gonna do
133:21 - yeah so it definitely does what I think
133:24 - it's gonna do but it's a little bit nuts
133:26 - and actually the repulsion behavior the
133:31 - radius and maybe strength should be
133:34 - dependent on its its level in the tree
133:40 - right so if we think about this fractal
133:42 - tree for a second
134:01 - if I were to draw what I'm doing right
134:05 - particle particle particle particle
134:08 - particle particle particle particle and
134:15 - I connect all these lines this is I bet
134:22 - something up weird what did I just do
134:28 - here this is basically what I've got so
134:36 - the each one of these particles has a
134:39 - sort of cone of repulsion and you can
134:43 - see that cone or that's not really a
134:45 - code it's a circle a circle repulsion
134:46 - should probably be smaller as it's
134:48 - getting further up the tree so that it
134:51 - sort of keeps its structure I mean again
134:53 - this is nothing to do with actual trees
134:55 - I'm just messing around with Springs and
134:58 - particles and having some fun but at
135:00 - least for the idea that I'm happening to
135:02 - create this sort of like simulated
135:03 - physics tree swaying in the wind I
135:06 - haven't even added any wind like some
135:07 - Pearlie noise or something this this I
135:10 - think would be a way to start so if I
135:16 - come back to this this is the variable
135:19 - that I'm talking about so I do I know
135:21 - about this distance so what if I just
135:25 - use that literal distance like I
135:27 - probably should use maybe like half the
135:29 - distance because it's a radius let's say
135:31 - half the distance
135:38 - acting a little bit crazy so I think
135:41 - this yeah skittish tree it's not
135:50 - maintaining its structure but it is kind
135:52 - of this crazy creepy crawly thing that I
135:54 - kind of love I think also this strength
135:56 - is kind of meaningful here like I could
135:59 - make it much weaker the interestingly
136:04 - enough the gravity is now so strong that
136:08 - what if I actually take out what if I
136:13 - don't have that negative gravity
136:17 - behavior like this is just the tree and
136:21 - this is actually in many ways I'm
136:23 - creating an example of a force directed
136:26 - graph aleck Moss is suggesting only put
136:29 - the repulsion force on the last particle
136:32 - on the end oh that's interesting
136:35 - right that's a meaningful idea adding
136:38 - that's yes that's actually a very
136:40 - important idea I think I'm duplicating
136:42 - because the end becomes the beginning of
136:45 - the next one I should only do one
136:47 - repulsion force that is a very good
136:52 - point yeah so this is more logical sort
137:00 - of whatever logic is assigned here what
137:07 - if I make it even weaker what if I make
137:10 - these Springs stronger yeah this this
137:14 - part here is really the issue like the
137:16 - branches start to like cross over
137:19 - strength of the branch should scale
137:22 - further out from the first branch should
137:23 - be ah yes so that's also true like I
137:27 - should this spring force like let's just
137:28 - say I make the spring force a 1 does
137:30 - that make it completely what's the word
137:33 - inelastic or elastic I'm gonna remember
137:34 - which is which but as if it's a metal
137:37 - rod there can't be springy so there's
137:43 - still the repulsion is an issue I mean
137:45 - issue bug or feature sunlight say
137:49 - feature there but this string
137:53 - and I could also do like I could say
137:57 - make it like 1/4 the radius yeah so this
138:03 - is kind of interesting so now what if I
138:05 - were to say let me make that
138:08 - oh the spring force of the repulsion
138:13 - force strength of the branch should
138:15 - scale further out from the first branch
138:17 - the weaker it should be the strength of
138:21 - the spring force or the repulsion force
138:25 - that could try either of those
138:32 - I kind of liked it when it was crazier
138:34 - to be perfectly honest I really like
138:39 - this idea of holding the tree up
138:41 - actually and then putting the gravity
138:42 - down because for example let's just put
138:44 - the gravity down again oh I'm not oops
138:51 - that's the wrong that's not a repulsion
138:52 - force it's an attraction force sorry
138:56 - meet a very weak oh oh no right I always
139:00 - forget the gravity is here if I put the
139:07 - gravity pointing down again
139:09 - the whole tree falls what if I every
139:12 - single very very last end point the last
139:16 - end points so for example where do i how
139:23 - do I find those so when n is 6 right if
139:36 - n let me just see if N equals 6 N equals
139:48 - 5 is the last one right
139:58 - just create a create a holder
140:10 - it's at the top
140:28 - I'm gonna take the branches in two
140:30 - separate variables and I'm going to make
140:36 - a spring
140:47 - at spring equals new
140:58 - a holder and a we're the rest length of
141:15 - a rest length of that distance and a
141:18 - strength of one and I want not a a dot
141:25 - end
141:37 - and let's do that twice
141:53 - and let's where did I just go there and
141:56 - that's it what am i doing I just need a
142:00 - little bit more room for my code physics
142:09 - add spring this is a ridiculous idea
142:21 - intermediate value is not a constructor
142:27 - whoa what is going on here hmm well what
142:40 - I guess I should probably draw these
142:43 - Springs
142:54 - you could apply forces using your
142:57 - forward kinematics code feels like that
143:01 - API is weird it should default to the
143:03 - distance between the two points given
143:06 - its rest length these are very good
143:08 - ideas I think I might leave this as an
143:11 - exercise to the viewer when n is 5 if
143:16 - it's makes 2 new branches make a spring
143:24 - between holder and the end and holders
143:28 - like this weird but they have arbitrary
143:34 - particle that I stuck oh oh I forgot to
143:39 - lock it in place
143:40 - I wonder yeah see now if only I could
143:48 - draw what it's doing so I think what
143:52 - would make more sense is for me to this
143:55 - is this is getting really ridiculous is
144:01 - to like have it hold itself up from not
144:09 - width but the end X point so like it's
144:13 - like there's like I'm building a little
144:14 - marionette I should really draw all
144:16 - these and then this is terrible
144:35 - [Music]
144:45 - pretty sure this is now gonna have each
144:48 - of them just to diagram what I'm doing
144:50 - it really helped for me to draw what I'm
144:52 - doing is if this is the top I'm putting
144:55 - something like right here that you don't
144:59 - see that like holds them off so I'm
145:05 - gonna like hold the tree up which is
145:07 - kind of ridiculous holder is not defined
145:15 - hold your wand holder on holder too old
145:17 - or too old or too old or too holders not
145:24 - too fast older one Oh everyone older too
145:28 - you should make the springs weaker so
145:31 - that they aren't metal rods
145:32 - oh maybe good point oh there's like the
145:36 - minimum and maximum I forgot about that
145:40 - there I'm holding the tree up do I even
145:47 - have the gravity pulling it down that's
145:48 - just perfect this is exactly what I was
145:50 - going for it let's just I'm curious what
146:00 - happens when these holder Springs are
146:03 - weaker
146:09 - really it doesn't make sense like they
146:11 - should be like come it would be a much
146:14 - more a much better way of doing this
146:15 - would be to kind of like attach them
146:18 - more like this I think some sort of like
146:21 - radial pattern probably but that was an
146:27 - interesting experiment but I think I'm
146:29 - gonna go back comment this out oops I'm
146:34 - gonna go back to the version that I have
146:36 - with negative gravity a repulsion force
146:46 - that is a factor the radius is a factor
146:49 - of the distance the length of the branch
146:52 - and the strength is in the negative
146:54 - direction and the spring force is much
147:00 - springier and let's see what we get here
147:05 - so this I like this brings me happiness
147:10 - now let's try to add I'm just curious
147:14 - let's add some is there a way to add
147:18 - dampening there must be I know there's
147:22 - there's the constraint function which
147:26 - would be good is there a dampening thing
147:28 - like particle behavior are these
147:39 - constraint oh there's all these
147:42 - constraint things there's minimum
147:44 - distance Springs that's probably
147:49 - something I should be using
147:52 - there's constraints
147:58 - I'm getting kind of kind of tired no
148:02 - what did a long time here Oh what Simon
148:05 - somebody said let's go attach them to
148:06 - their initial position with zero length
148:08 - Springs Oh fascinating idea whoa I like
148:14 - that idea
148:14 - add horizontal force proportional to the
148:17 - distance from the center of the screen
148:19 - yeah
148:20 - so many things I could try here and like
148:24 - you should all try these ideas maybe I
148:26 - can make a list of these ideas to talk
148:28 - about at the end I think I just want to
148:30 - make this kind of go crazy because I
148:31 - need to wrap this up but you're getting
148:34 - to see the challenge here so I want to
148:36 - what I wanted to Dilys do it I wanted to
148:39 - see if I could put some dampening I mean
148:43 - I know how to do this manually does
148:51 - toxic lives have inherent dampening from
148:54 - 3 months ago I did not expect to see a
148:57 - forum poster of 3 months ago this does
149:02 - not have an answer can I login can I
149:09 - reply to this oh this is the old forum
149:12 - so it's not from three months ago sorry
149:14 - this is from a very long time ago this
149:16 - is the archive of the old for forum so I
149:18 - can't reply to that oh look the nature
149:22 - of code calm maybe if I read that book
149:26 - it'll explain to me that would be nice
149:29 - lesson 5 default friction or dampening
149:39 - [Music]
149:53 - yeah
149:58 - J Myron Wow I remember that library this
150:01 - is from 2013 this discussion really like
150:05 - blasts from the past year what about
150:12 - friction
150:18 - no friction ah maybe watch this YouTube
150:25 - tutorial from 2015 it'll explain it to
150:28 - me I'm gonna give up on that I mean I
150:37 - could I could calculate a dampening
150:42 - force it's the angle which is what
150:47 - should be spring that's a very good
150:49 - point all right I have to stop here and
150:51 - offer suggestions for the community to
150:53 - do more fun stuff so couple things I I'm
151:02 - pretty happy with what this is doing
151:04 - it's not a realistic tree but it's sort
151:07 - of pleasant and interesting I bet you if
151:08 - you kind of we're thoughtful about how
151:11 - you draw this you might create some kind
151:13 - of like alien plant life creature it
151:15 - almost feels like more underwater ish
151:17 - like this is like an underwater plant so
151:20 - let me try to add a few more things to
151:21 - this number one is let me at least add
151:23 - it so that the branches are thicker I'm
151:25 - at the bottom and thinner at the top so
151:28 - that could be done by I could add a
151:32 - level variable here and this would have
151:36 - been useful for a lot of other things
151:38 - and every time I make a branch I give it
151:44 - its level so the root is level zero and
151:47 - a branch a branch B actually I could
151:51 - just give it the N here but I think I'll
151:55 - have the branch that it calculate the
151:58 - next level itself so the branch when it
152:01 - makes a new branch right here should say
152:06 - this dot level plus one and also right
152:11 - here this dot level plus one now when I
152:15 - draw it I can say stroke weight and
152:20 - let's just let me just say level for a
152:22 - second so that you see this is gonna
152:23 - work in the wrong way oh this dot level
152:33 - right so now we see it's thicker towards
152:36 - the top which is actually more like lab
152:39 - underwater creature plant like which I
152:41 - also quite enjoy but let's invert it so
152:47 - let's map this dot so let's say total
152:54 - levels equals six right now which goes
152:59 - here and then let's map this dot level
153:03 - which goes from zero to total levels and
153:05 - the stroke let's have the stroke weight
153:08 - go from 12 down to one and I'm missing a
153:15 - parenthesis somewhere I need another
153:17 - parenthesis here oh that is nice okay
153:21 - so already I'm enjoying this quite a bit
153:23 - boy it's kind of creepy could I maybe
153:29 - twelve to one is like too much and it
153:31 - probably should have an exponential or
153:33 - logarithmic some other scale it's linear
153:35 - right now
153:36 - let's do like eight yeah so it's a
153:39 - little less extreme and also let's try
153:42 - let's have like let's just push it to
153:45 - let's push it to eleven you need eleven
153:50 - this goes to eleven this fractal tree oh
153:53 - oh hold on hold on hold on everybody
153:57 - stop the chat spectral piano is giving
154:00 - me a good suggestion but here we go
154:09 - it's nice but it's not it can it not
154:12 - calculate the physics hello very om it's
154:16 - kind of like almost pi so too many
154:18 - levels too many levels Mozart let's try
154:21 - 10 still too slow 9
154:30 - yeah we're getting 30 frames per second
154:32 - now with 9 so what was that scale
154:36 - velocity yes so I could dampen the
154:40 - velocity of each particle that's a small
154:42 - idea I'm not the words coming out of my
154:47 - mouth make no sense that's a good idea
154:53 - also I think that radius is getting way
154:56 - too small now I want the radius to be
154:59 - bigger
155:07 - so let's keep that radius bigger as I
155:11 - want them I want more and I want the
155:14 - frame rate to be faster so I'm gonna put
155:19 - it at eight there we go
155:23 - so okay this is good what was the
155:28 - logarithmic scale that someone suggested
155:30 - I'm gonna scroll back up in the chat
155:31 - wasn't that long ago where was it where
155:39 - was it
155:40 - scrolling scrolling ah I use spectral
155:43 - praiano writes I use 16 divided by log
155:47 - level plus 2 for this thickness so a
155:49 - logarithmic scale is an excellent idea
155:51 - here that's going to I think work nicely
156:01 - and if my brain if I wasn't so brain
156:03 - dead explain it where do I do the stroke
156:06 - wait here it is stroke weight equals 16
156:11 - divided equally divided by log of this
156:16 - dot level plus 2 I don't want that to be
156:18 - 0 and let's see how this goes let's try
156:29 - logarithmic scale what's
156:38 - yeah I like this it's nice and I think I
156:40 - could even kind of go down yeah so
156:44 - that's really nice it's a I like the
156:47 - scale of this all right so we're getting
156:50 - our trees I'm surprised that it doesn't
156:56 - fan out more and I I think it would make
157:02 - sense of +1 here hello what happened to
157:05 - that oh plus two because I have a zero
157:07 - level that makes sense
157:08 - okay color so many things that could
157:13 - happen here maybe increase the strength
157:16 - of the repulsion force says Simon
157:18 - excellent idea because guess what I want
157:21 - it to go a little crazier there we go
157:25 - there you go yes
157:27 - dance tree dance oh I could have it
157:34 - respond to it looks like it's responding
157:50 - to sound that's what the crane bees let
157:56 - me just do one more thing and why one
157:59 - more thing I mean like probably ten more
158:00 - things but let me add some wind into the
158:04 - system so I only get one gravity
158:07 - behavior do I even does this even really
158:11 - matter let's take out the gravity
158:12 - behavior for a second I think what I
158:17 - could do I have an idea
158:20 - so without the gravity behavior it's
158:22 - it's not for standing up as consistently
158:26 - very weird it's also a little I feel
158:29 - like I shouldn't lock the second
158:31 - particle like it's weird that that with
158:33 - this whole thing that really doesn't
158:35 - make sense
158:35 - so let's not lock the second particle
158:37 - anymore can I just out of curiosity if I
158:43 - make a global variable called GB for
158:48 - gravity behavior
158:50 - and I and I say GB is that gravity
158:56 - behavior and I adjust its values like if
159:02 - I say function mousepressed gb x equals
159:09 - zero gb y equals zero when i click the
159:13 - mouse does that disable the gravity oh I
159:17 - forgot that I have that thing where I
159:20 - also can like drag one of them around I
159:23 - can't tell I think it did disable the
159:26 - gravity but it's too hard to tell
159:27 - let's take this out I don't think it
159:35 - disabled the gravity
159:36 - I think the gravity is still there I
159:41 - wanted to like just adjust that behavior
159:45 - over time oh I don't have the chance to
159:50 - looking at the logarithmic scale thing
159:51 - in the chat the spring should go from B
159:56 - to the a of the previous branch I think
159:58 - I'm doing that by definition of the way
160:00 - that I'm creating the springs the N
160:05 - branches definitely get tangled which is
160:08 - kind of interesting look at that
160:16 - um how do I hold on let's be sure about
160:20 - this way hold on console.log chibi Oh
160:31 - force oh there we go
160:33 - scaled force there's a force in a scale
160:36 - force maybe I can yeah X&Y don't do
160:38 - anything what if I were to say I forgot
160:45 - that I'm in JavaScript I just look at
160:46 - the objects maybe I need to affect the
160:55 - scaled force I mean I'm probably not
160:57 - supposed to do this was it called scaled
161:01 - force yeah there we go so I don't think
161:08 - this is the proper way to affect the
161:13 - behavior but it'll work for right now so
161:17 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say let's
161:20 - always have the gravities scaled force
161:24 - Why Why is never gonna change but I'm
161:27 - gonna make the X and I probably should
161:30 - use open simplex noise and refer to my
161:32 - other videos about on blue simplex noise
161:36 - that's when it flies in later during the
161:38 - when this never gets edited this is very
161:40 - much like the neuro Revolution cars but
161:43 - feeling it's never gonna get edited
161:47 - noise but X offset equals zero X offset
161:59 - plus equals 0.02 noise X offset and
162:05 - we're going to map that value which goes
162:07 - between zero and one to between negative
162:10 - two and two so let's just see what
162:13 - happens here if there's this so the
162:15 - gravity this global force which is
162:18 - really not gravity but it's just a force
162:20 - always pointing up that's also going to
162:22 - go left and right from time to time
162:23 - let's see what happens
162:28 - it's a little bit too strong you can
162:36 - imagine an interaction where like I blow
162:37 - into the microphone and it does that
162:40 - it's kind of crazy I love this I really
162:43 - like this project let's go from like
162:45 - point one to zero point one yeah so
162:50 - there we go
162:51 - here is my tree swaying in the wind with
162:57 - physics let's go back let's just tune
163:08 - this a little bit I think these are way
163:10 - too strong let's make the it half as
163:14 - strong let's let the springs be much
163:17 - looser I think this is going to be nicer
163:20 - there we go there we go
163:36 - that's let's have a couple more little
163:41 - tuning things let's make this even
163:46 - weaker and let's change it less often
163:51 - and let's have the gravity force
163:56 - actually be well let's we can set it
163:59 - here let's set the Y we could also make
164:07 - this could be noisy as well I have an
164:11 - idea we'll just take a different we'll
164:14 - still go from like a different place in
164:16 - the noise space so it's different values
164:17 - and we'll map that which goes between
164:20 - zero and one which is silly I could just
164:22 - we could just take that noise value I
164:25 - don't need map for this because I want
164:27 - it to just go always negative and but
164:30 - have it be kind of weak
164:33 - so if sometimes it'll kind of go it'll
164:36 - go down to zero let's try this whoops
164:40 - scaled force all right I think I have
164:46 - finished this project
164:48 - yes I'm oka gonnna saying how about a
164:51 - Springs each joint which pulls them back
164:52 - to its original location repeat idea
164:59 - relaxing music here it's kind of
165:12 - appropriate
165:21 - there we go there's a white man
165:28 - hold on hold on hold on let's make this
165:34 - we're gonna I'm gonna give we're gonna
165:36 - do some relaxing tree fundraising here
165:39 - how do I do that thing where there I got
165:43 - it I got it I got it
165:43 - just hold on for a second
165:48 - [Music]
166:06 - [Music]
166:13 - [Music]
166:20 - [Music]
166:42 - [Music]
166:52 - [Music]
166:58 - [Music]
167:04 - all right everybody take a minute bring
167:11 - everybody from the internet here we are
167:14 - going to enjoy some nice relaxing music
167:19 - and a physics tree
167:25 - [Music]
168:48 - [Music]
169:30 - you don't like my default music from
169:35 - YouTube's free library that it's like
169:38 - somehow I have over here yeah first of
169:41 - all it doesn't respond to the music so I
169:44 - really think it should oh I have not
169:50 - gone Edward to ask me if I check out
169:51 - this exhibit yet I really have got to I
169:55 - really should can you share the code
169:56 - please so I definitely will share the
169:58 - code I suppose I could right now create
170:03 - a repo really quickly but I don't know
170:07 - that I'm ready like you know this this
170:10 - makes sense for it to be a community
170:11 - project you could create Springs between
170:16 - the particles on the same level to keep
170:19 - the branches separate that is such a
170:21 - good idea so there's so many good ideas
170:24 - being suggested and what I would like to
170:27 - say I mean I I've hit three hours now
170:29 - and I think that's about my limit but I
170:33 - would encourage you to to create your
170:38 - own version of this I will before I
170:40 - leave I'll upload the code somewhere so
170:41 - you could build off of it and remove the
170:46 - bounding box yeah the bounding box is
170:48 - sort of unnecessary here so let's do a
170:50 - few last things how do I let's do a few
170:54 - last things the bounding box is very
170:57 - unnecessary they should let let the tree
171:01 - be free fly tree fly like the wind like
171:06 - the Perlin noise not really wind so easy
171:10 - to listen to the microphone so it got
171:13 - rid of the sound library how do I get
171:16 - out of this full screen
171:27 - let's get the sound library back this is
171:29 - my fancy technique no shoot did I get it
171:41 - it's the worst I'm completely lost my
171:44 - mind I'm like so brain-dead spent a long
171:47 - week
171:47 - is that the sound library excellent I
171:50 - think I just say I can just make a
171:53 - variable called Mike and then I can say
171:56 - let Mike equals p5 audio in and then can
172:04 - I just get like the level there's more
172:11 - to it than this can't be this simple
172:26 - ooh whoops and it should be new p5
172:29 - audio-in all right that's not how it
172:37 - works
172:38 - Oh Mike dot start close
172:44 - I am definitely listening so let's go
172:47 - look at the examples oh I mean I want to
172:58 - look at examples
173:05 - sound sound Mike threshold input start
173:11 - get level new p5 audio and oh you know
173:15 - what it might be
173:26 - let's try listening on mousepressed
173:40 - oh wait a sec I have a feeling that the
173:44 - audio input is like tied to something
173:49 - else sound input no it's the built-in
173:53 - microphone
174:10 - can in fact work and put new p5 audio in
174:16 - and put get level huh what did I do
174:22 - wrong
174:32 - by missing
174:46 - what am I missing
175:09 - weird
175:22 - make Mike global I did I mean I was not
175:27 - putting the Mike dot start and setup
175:29 - because there's the weird issue well
175:32 - hold on let's try this there's a weird
175:37 - thing with Chrome where it doesn't want
175:40 - to let you listen without user
175:42 - interaction so that's why I was putting
175:44 - it in mousepressed just to kind of get
175:46 - around that and then I could say like if
175:52 - Mike
176:04 - I know but it works here
176:13 - [Music]
176:18 - watch me delete all my code and lose it
176:22 - all how confident am i okay hold on but
176:28 - this is in another file now this is just
176:36 - that example weird okay good
176:43 - so something is going on where it's not
176:47 - working let me let me show the warnings
176:49 - I have the warnings filtered out how do
176:54 - I were to filter things
177:06 - custom levels there it is this is what I
177:11 - was worried about audio context was not
177:16 - allowed to start so that's why I was
177:24 - here gonna say
177:52 - so it's not working in for an audio
177:58 - stream huh
178:08 - well that's good it's definitely
178:14 - something to do with
178:30 - oops
178:39 - how do I see the how do I look at the
178:46 - JavaScript console in Firefox I have
178:54 - completely little run out of steam I
178:56 - don't know why I decided to try to do
178:57 - this
179:11 - Oh allow
179:15 - and here we go you usually would ask me
179:17 - to allow it some preferences web
179:24 - developer
179:29 - web console there we go I'm getting some
179:34 - values
179:53 - whoops no no
180:03 - how do I make this bigger well alright
180:08 - so now what I was going to do
180:22 - just get the volume and then have this
180:27 - kind of be tied to that because
180:33 - definitely gonna be exactly what I
180:35 - wanted to do come back Oh interesting
181:06 - something is going weird with the audio
181:08 - stream alright this didn't happen I'm
181:18 - done I have to go home I can't be here
181:24 - anymore close this close this
181:33 - while he was not defined when I have
181:38 - that ass forgot what I had
182:02 - this is never getting edited into some
182:05 - kind of like 30 minute coding challenge
182:07 - but in the off chance that it does I
182:11 - will record a little end and I will just
182:13 - consider this my prompt to you from the
182:15 - livestream thank you for thank you for
182:19 - watching this coding challenge that was
182:22 - a bit of a mess but I ended up making
182:24 - this strange wiggly sea creature
182:26 - hopefully you learned something about
182:28 - the way that a fractal works
182:30 - object-oriented programming works and
182:32 - physics libraries work I guess I would
182:35 - open it up to you or what are some ways
182:37 - that you could actually make this feel
182:39 - much more tree-like in terms of giving
182:41 - it a much more stable structure or
182:43 - perhaps go in the opposite direction and
182:46 - make it even more frenetic or feel more
182:48 - creature or seaweed or underwater like
182:50 - maybe it could respond to some kind of
182:52 - interaction like sound you could do so
182:54 - much more with color you you could
182:57 - change the way you're drawing the tree
182:59 - or the design of the branches so many
183:01 - possibilities if you make your own
183:03 - wiggly wobbly fractal tree with physics
183:07 - please share it with me at the coding
183:09 - Drang calm on the page associated with
183:12 - this coding challenge and I will see you
183:13 - in future videos and I would love ya
183:17 - share it with me and I will see you next
183:21 - time on the coda train
183:22 - I had point five not point two okay try
183:31 - recording an intro okay Simon good point
183:42 - what you're about to watch okay hello
183:45 - and welcome to a coding challenge what
183:47 - you're about to watch is an edited down
183:49 - version of what I spent well over two
183:52 - hours programming which is this this is
183:56 - for the YouTube fundraiser team trees go
184:00 - to team trees or to donate or use the
184:03 - donate button that's associated with
184:04 - this video I really set out to try to
184:07 - make a tree swaying in the wind and I
184:09 - ended up with this crazy like flying
184:12 - around that's completely gone now sea
184:16 - creature more like or I don't know what
184:18 - it is here comes back hi tree just
184:20 - spinning around in circles and so I'm
184:23 - going to show you just about all the
184:25 - pieces of the code that I wrote to do
184:26 - this with a lot of the debugging and
184:28 - extra tangents cut out of course you
184:30 - could always back go back and watch the
184:31 - full livestream but please maybe you
184:35 - could make a version of this that's a
184:37 - little less insane or that's more insane
184:39 - and share it with me at the coding trade
184:41 - calm plant a tree every dollar goes to
184:46 - planting a tree i've do brain dead to
184:56 - make this opener let me just let me just
185:00 - look here at team trees okay
185:09 - any donations that you make through this
185:11 - from this video any donations that you
185:14 - make either a team tree org or the
185:16 - YouTube donate button or Arbor days team
185:19 - trees I'm not gonna forget on Facebook
185:21 - any donations you make either going by
185:23 - going directly to team trees org or with
185:26 - the donate button that you see with this
185:27 - video are sent directly to the Arbor Day
185:30 - Foundation to fund tree planting $1
185:32 - plants one tree you could read more
185:35 - about the team trees fundraiser by by
185:38 - checking out the links in this video's
185:40 - description so enjoy this insanity of me
185:42 - attempting to make a tree and ending up
185:45 - with this my friend my weekly Wiggly
185:47 - friend and I will see you at the end
185:50 - where I come back and try to summarize
185:52 - this very poorly probably goodbye
185:57 - alright everyone I'm gonna try to I you
186:02 - know this little the fundraisers were
186:04 - probably going on for a while but and
186:09 - I'm I'm done I'm done for today
186:14 - choo choo I pressed the choo-choo button
186:17 - I play my little outro music and see if
186:21 - there are just a few questions that I
186:23 - could answer before I go I just want to
186:27 - check my messages for a second
186:28 - [Music]
186:35 - so I'm very much hope I have a bunch of
186:39 - videos that I've recorded that are in
186:41 - the hopper so to speak that I haven't
186:43 - released yet
186:44 - so those I will be so stay tuned there's
186:48 - obviously edited stuff that's come from
186:49 - previous live streams but there are some
186:52 - new there's a new content coming
186:54 - out in particular set of videos or come
186:56 - out on November 6 that you won't have
186:59 - seen the live stream we ship out let's
187:03 - all say it's good to powder for sale a
187:06 - bloop boo boo boo paella false a lot
187:09 - more fluff I'll say a Tele blur but I'll
187:13 - put the phone say can I do it dance
187:17 - [Music]
187:31 - [Music]
187:40 - background is overpowering my friend she
187:43 - turned it down sorry that it's so loud
187:46 - couldn't you have used apply force just
187:49 - like with the snow with a random single
187:51 - direction wind yes I could have I don't
187:55 - know why I got stuck on like just give
187:57 - everything the same force
188:08 - what's your
188:20 - all right thanks everybody I see some
188:24 - interesting comments
188:25 - Lonnie writes I've been blocked hmm I
188:28 - don't block like on is it can you block
188:30 - people on YouTube I'm not sure exactly
188:32 - what happened there but I will I can
188:35 - check into that cringe yes I agree
188:39 - portably what's your favorite thing
188:42 - besides teaching
188:44 - [Music]
188:53 - yeah no I've seen common so I don't
188:55 - think you're blocked my favorite thing
188:57 - besides teaching hanging out I only have
189:01 - cheese the answers to that like I know
189:07 - I'm not French this song it's much
189:12 - longer than I remember I would have just
189:19 - passed a few sine waves for the tree
189:21 - points these are all really good ideas
189:23 - none of which did I try yes go to sleep
189:26 - Jory go to sleep I'm leaving to go to
189:27 - sleep in just a minute here I'll play
189:30 - you out with a diss song how fast you
189:35 - need to drive psycho fly to catch the
189:37 - game what time is the game start what
189:39 - time is it now oh I can get home I
189:41 - actually can get home within 20 minutes
189:43 - from here
189:45 - so yeah I'll be able to catch that World
189:46 - Series game ok thank you all I don't
189:53 - know sometimes I and these streams that
189:55 - think that all my time and energy is
189:58 - going into the right place sometimes I
190:00 - think what's become of me but I I hope
190:04 - oh let me upload this code so I don't I
190:09 - don't have a point of view right now as
190:11 - I mean and I will violate to is helping
190:17 - me manage a lot of the github repos we
190:21 - can put our heads together and think
190:22 - about this and there's many other
190:24 - members and patrons who do a lot of this
190:26 - work as well but let me just at least
190:29 - put the code somewhere that you could
190:30 - see by making a new repo because I do
190:36 - like the idea of having a community team
190:39 - trees project you know one idea that I
190:41 - had which I did that look those like
190:43 - cloud designs a bunch of years ago for
190:45 - processing Community Day and everybody
190:47 - could make a cloud design and then we
190:48 - could make a forest of 20 million coding
190:51 - train trees oh there's some interesting
190:52 - ideas here but let me just do this right
190:55 - now a code from team trees livestream so
191:01 - at a minimum I'm just gonna make a
191:04 - readme
191:05 - that the code from today will be here on
191:09 - YouTube github and this can be like so
191:18 - much more needs to be here to make it a
191:21 - thoughtful useable thing but adding code
191:24 - from today but at least for those of you
191:28 - who want to try to start to work with
191:33 - what I did you can grab it from here
191:36 - right now at github slash coding trained
191:39 - team trees get tube alright bye
191:46 - everybody I'm gonna switch you over to
191:49 - the team trees logo you can still hear
191:52 - me I'm gonna play you out with the
191:55 - Perlin noise song actual random itself
192:06 - those numbers aren't related at all you
192:09 - pick like I'm picking random numbers
192:10 - between 0 and 10 9 - 7 6 - but with
192:20 - curly noise I might pick numbers like
192:21 - this 2 3 4 3 4 5 6
193:05 - Perley noise that is totally noise this
193:08 - is Hurley noise that is Hurley noises
193:09 - this is Hurley noise that entirly know
193:11 - so this is Hurley noise that is her
193:13 - pearling know her Perlin noise that is
193:14 - Hurley more this is Hurley noise that
193:16 - it's Hurley no this is this is Hurley
193:17 - noise that in Perley no so this is
193:19 - Hurley noise that is hurly-burly noise
193:38 - pick numbers like this
193:54 - this is like Perlin noise performance
193:58 - goodbye everybody
194:00 - choo-choo

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to my life okay ah is this happening this is really happening right now hello and welcome to the coding train I'm looking in front of me and seeing a light on over here and three lights that I forgot to turn on and actually about thirty seconds ago I forgot to put the mic on just scrambling to put the mic on let me go turn those lights on enjoy some music Here I am turning on lights number two like number three oh it's brighter in here now lovely ha all right now I'm really here and I am wearing my fancy new team trees sweatshirt strangely enough these trees seem to be purple also I something strange is going on but if you would like to see what this sweatshirt really looks like I will come over here oh boy it's bright I thought I fixed the settings on this camera but yeah I apparently did not welcome if you're new here maybe you came for the trees this is the coding train where I a person has signed a contract to every time I say the word train I have to blow a ridiculous train whistle it's my lot in life but really I come here on Fridays and other days and sometimes not at all to livestream coding tutorials and coding challenges and fun creative projects to make with code and basically also waste a lot of time with a lot of nonsense if you're really more interested in just coding tutorials I might tell you to go refer to some of the videos my playlists which are on my channel which are in playlists and edited together a little bit more succinctly for learning to code but today I am here to do a special livestream as part of this YouTube fundraiser that's happening today called team trees any money donated as part of the fundraiser we'll go to the National Arbor Foundation the goal is to raise twenty million dollars every dollar goes to plant a tree there's lots of information about this online at teen trees and a special thank you to today's sponsor of the livestream brilliant odd org I will come back brilliant I works a wonderful website with lots of fun interactive challenges and learning puzzles and courses in the middle of the live stream I will do the today's daily challenge thank you for their sponsorship of today's live stream I am donating the brilliant sponsorship feed to the National Arbor foundation for today's live stream okay I said train whistle Simoniz factchecking me and said I said train whistle but not did not blow the train whistle all right I will by the way I have a level in here now we can see if I am level don't break the level wait what happens if the level is more than one bubble in it now no it's back to one bubble hi Dan hey Dan Thank You TMC who donated five bucks I do see a quick notification popup when somebody donates but I don't see if I don't look quickly they seem to go away I should open up a page which shows me that Leonard gasps lured donated five euros I believe that's the unit of measurement to the National Arbor Day Foundation thank you very much ding and train with all and alle Babis writes hey Dan this is my first stream yay welcome Congrats on gaining a level dan what did I gain how did I gain a level what level did I gain I'm not sure what's going on all right so I'm pretty excited about what I'm going to code today and maybe I think it probably makes the most sense for me to just jump right into it I mean you know but in case you this is your first live stream and have never been here before I think I better just clue people in to what this channel really is like and often what I like to do is read helps me relax helps me get my mindset to think about coding and algorithms and all that stuff by reading from my favorite book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal TV it's still looking for a first edition complete copy of this book hard to find sixtyfour thousand one hundred sixtyone 3748 seventy three thousand twenty five doesn't feel like this is the right moment to read these numbers the one you have now the level the worst I'm so bad that I use corny sad trombone sound effects that literally what I have become in my life a person who wears a green sweatshirt that's seethrough play sad trombone sounds live streaming on YouTube wow this is the part that I'm happy about actually reading random numbers ninety thousand eight hundred thirty five ninety one thousand eight hundred forty three fifty four thousand three hundred forty three twenty seven thousand eight hundred and ninety seven fortythree thousand eight hundred and sixty six twelve thousand eight hundred twelve fifty five thousand ninety three eighty seven thousand four hundred and eighty nine twenty eight thousand seven hundred and eightythree fortytwo thousand four hundred thirty four forty seven thousand nine hundred and seventy two indeed three hundred seven thousand six hundred sixty eight ninety three thousand four hundred and seventy seven ninety two thousand five hundred and forty eight fiftyfive in 622 4338 66 thousand and twenty one fifty five thousand five hundred and fifty one ninety four thousand three hundred eighteen ninety three thousand three hundred and ninety one the music is very loud okay thanks for letting me oh yeah no it's at the same level it's always been maybe the lullaby sound is a little louder I will turn it down a little bit boy boink oh oh oh shamil and closer you asks what's the book about okay let me just write I think maybe you didn't get it so I better read another section fifty fifty thousand nine hundred fiftysix 77948 wente eight ninety five thousand four hundred and sixty nine random numbers six million I I'm gonna move lunch it's apparently first four hundred and twenty five people watching right now so I'm I'm kind of on a path and I have all these projects that I would like to and it by the way when I keep looking over here it's because I got multiple chaps and feeds and things telling me stuff about what's happening the live stream but I'm gonna focus on you the viewer and talk to you for a minute I have a lot of plans I have a lot of topics I want to attempt to cover and videos that to them because every week I'm distracted by some thing that I thought of or somebody told me about that I thought I would try and this is one of those weeks I'm I'm teaching a course called introduction to machine learning for the creative arts and most of that course does not have video tutorials associated with it and I really would like to get that up and running and fill that out but I'm here because I'm going to revisit something that I have wanted to do for years that I've never found the time to do and I'm going to do it as a coding challenge today for team trees for the team trees fundraiser so that is what I'm going to do is I'm to go back back in time two days of your a long long time ago all the way to coding challenge we're now on coding challenge number 152 which is kind of insane this is livestream number 187 apparently I've been doing this for quite a while now just nuts but I'm gonna go all the way back scroll scroll but you're not getting seasick coding challenge number 15 can I get there where am i 43 oh so many coding challenges coding challenge number one with starfield we're gonna find number 15 because that will form the basis of what I want to do so what I want to what I have already done everything I could possibly think of near something to do a tree pose is that like a yoga thing which is good I need to do more yoga to stretch so I have already done every possible algorithmic tree fractal thing that I could think of I have a coding challenge on just fractal trees with recursion making an object oriented to put some leaves at the end of the tree I did an lsystem I did the like spacewalk that's not what it is space colonization algorithm I've done a bunch so many yes space colonization 3d fractal trees lsystem I was like on a whole tree kick if only I had known this team trees we'd be planting trees here in 2019 I could have not done any of these I could just redo them today but I've done them before and so on David's reminding me yes I do want to show the RDP contributions I'm kind of getting to the community contributions thing so this is what I want to start with I want to start with making the objectoriented fractal trees because the thing that I said I definitely must have said in one of these videos is I would like to look at or I proposed this as a challenge to a viewer to add physics of the tree so you can draw the pattern of the tree recursively that's what's happening if I go here right we can just see this is a recursive tree and it's just unfurling all at once there's none of the information about the tree is retained it's just sort of like a stamp onto the canvas I could also oh we will here if I do this by this website oh no wrong way this website is awesome I could go to this one and this one I can't remember do I have it grow what's it broken is it broken oh no oh no I pressed I click so I could actually have the tree grow slowly over time and I could add some leaves that fall so this is actually now retaining information about the parts of the tree where they are and placing a shape at the end this is what I want to build on so this is what I need to maybe have the tree sway in the wind or something like that so that's what I'm going to do and there's some other tree challenges that do other things so what I thought I would do and this this one would be an interesting one to try as well but let's start with this one and what I wanted to do was look at some of the tree community contributions but since I recently released a coding challenge RDP Ramar Douglas poker algorithm you know it's a topic that everybody was just dying for me to do most but that I could maybe I should I would like to show those community contributions so let's start off with doing that if you are wondering how to submit your own community contribution there's an you this there's this link here and also see how you can do it for any coding challenge coding challenge number one from a long time ago you could do might not be able to wear this so much ole live stream there's a explanation of how it works here along with a video tutorial because that's the thing that I do apparently make video tutorials let's look at these community contributions that came in Raymer Drive this poker algorithm in 3d using p5.js let's take a look at that one wow that's wild so I think we're seeing it play out over time where the line line optimization or iterative line up to is may be called per make the leaves blow with wind perla noise so that's pretty interesting to see this 3d curve our path being iteratively simplified by removing excess points that's wonderful I'm kind of amazed at the WebGL engine in p5 works well enough for you to make something like this which is wonderful thank you for that let's take a look at this GPS route data swift for iPhone this is gonna take me to a YouTube video which might not be the easiest thing for me to just watch right now but why not so this is a swift app may be looking at a path and then yes so this is the this is definitely one of the applications of the algorithm which is to look at maybe look at geo geo data chart a path through lat/long points and then simplify that path by removing excess points that kind of thing that's pretty interesting no cancel I thought I had auto play off here hey look there's this live stream with fiveo it's a fundraiser look at all this new stuff going on on YouTube today let's take a look at Oh seriously oh yes so this was actually pointed out in one of the comments that oh it would have made sense to combine RDP with your earlier for a drawing videos because you could kind of take the user drawn the user drawing from made from the mouse and optimized it and looks like David Schneider did the very this so let's take a look at this okay I'm gonna draw something I'm gonna draw a tree that's gonna be this is how trees look all right and so what are the interesting things about you doing this with I see your comment Nathan about my messing up with Auto play don't think I don't see it one of the nice thing one of the interesting things that's happening here is by reducing the points the speed of the fourier visualization is suddenly so fast because it's tied the actual rotation speed and the number of epicycles is tied to the number of points so maybe there's a way to massage that in some way too even with fewer points to slow it down or I'm not so sure but that would be something to consider I would say and then already piece scaling fidelity to plot y axis lines ok motifs art I don't know I don't think I looked at this one whoa does this have sound feels like it should have sound this should have sound I don't know what sound that should have news sometimes I just like lose myself with my thoughts while livestreaming it's they didn't fix the air and in fact when I walked in here it was 68 degrees which is way too cool but I was happy with that because the it gets warm as I'm in here for a while but the sweatshirt thing is making it feel quite quite all right synth Wave music yeah I agree thank you for this these are beautiful I can't tell you how much joy it brings me to see people's variations of the coding challenges and the coding examples and sharing them and I hope that I'm doing a the best job that I can in sharing those back with the community and allowing people to engage with each other and be creative so if you have ideas and things that I could think about to do a better job let me know I will also mention that I am taking steps to be better about having merging contributions and bringing in more people to work on the github repos I will note that if you're looking for something to get started with it's still technically hack tober fest if you still need to get some pull request for your features a pull request for your features I just started speaking words that make no sense if you're still looking to get a number of pull requests for your tshirt oktoberfest tshirt you could contribute to the coding train website and in particular i will note act adding backlog of guests tutorials even tagged hacked Oberer fest so violet craze they are working to help me keep the github repos uptodate and managed and so I'm violet is there along with many other members of the community to help you out if you want to try contributing to the website one of the things that violet is looking at is what videos don't have a corresponding web page where people might want to share their versions even ones from years ago and so this is an issue that talks about how you can get involved with filling some of those in on the website if you're looking for or you know kind of getting started working with github and an open source project kind of thing and David says you forgot to remind me about the more contributions right oh thank you actually you didn't forget because you just reminded me and this is the last thing I'm gonna do before I start the coding challenge today a chrome uh tree yes I love that welcome to my chroma tree so what I want to say is if one thing you'll notice which is new on the website is you can also go definitely need like I don't have to cabana music that's yeah what's the Cabana music you've been using I should at least add that to my soundboard but probably this is the closest um you could go what I am I even saying I don't need to play music from my soundboard I am a very poor amateur ukulele player who happens to have a very out of tune ukulele that I forgot to tune before I started but we can go to the Cabana and if I go to the Cabana there is one compare the video from my series coding in the Cabana where I code a visualization of the more rows if you haven't seen this I don't know maybe you might enjoy it it's kind of fits with the team trees theme you can go check it out and now you can also because we have this page and maybe you have anyone who wants to contribute some ideas for how to make this look different more like you're in the Cabana you can now add your own versions and maybe soon I have a second coding the Cabana video coming out I should warn you all who hated the chalkboard that the chalkboard makes what we did much it did some excellent work to sort of reduce the amount of chalk sounds but the chalkboard will be no more one more time with the chalkboard you don't know what I'm talking about just go watch this video you'll know pretty quickly let's look at the Morrow's with UI ooh well so this is we can oh what does draw outline how cool I didn't even look at these somehow I missed these loop the drawing ooh loop n in D oh my god so many options this is totally fun you can change the color color picker I don't even know how to do that great work this is fun so you can try one of the thing about this is you can try different values for the variables that determine the more rows patterns let's try for you know 72 it's just fun to like see what happens with all these different values I mean algorithms and graphics it's like chocolate and peanut butter they just did so nice alright thank you for that David and oh wait once again so people people of the internet it's that I thank you to those of you who are so dedicated to the coding train and always are submitting your contributions but if you're out there and you're thinking good I don't know what I'm doing no please I I encourage you submit your version you made it it is beautiful don't be just just come and join and I would love to feature it on the coding train alright 3d more rows radius as 730 more whoa okay wow that's kind of nuts and so I can do the same thing here well it whoa oh this is wild great work I love seeing this this is just with p5 WebGL amazing we should look at the code for this so how do you do this in p5 animated rows oh there must be like another JavaScript file I'll look at this on my own time logic ok I guess you can just use vertex begin shape vertex with XYZ points this did like years ago this didn't this didn't work amazing all right now let's go to Morrow's link to scroll this one I did see I remember it's quite lovely this is a code pen a rose by any other name let's do a nice dramatic reading of this oh Romeo will be aware for doubt Wow Romeo deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love and I'll no longer be a Capulet you can see why I failed after I mean I did actually draw but I would have failed and thus I'm a weird internet person who does coding tutorials shall I hear more or shall I speak at this tis but thy name that is my enemy thou art thyself though not a Montague this could also use some music it is nor hand nor foot nor arm nor face nor any parts belonging to a man o be so other name look so I didn't even notice this as I'm scrolling this is animating I I'm sorry I shouldn't put the ridiculous music to it because it's quite beautiful so that's really interesting that this is like a know kind of a unique idea to have some sort of content a text scroll scrolling it and I'm have the animation for the scroll be some algorithmic or generative art what I love that all right I think we're ready now well let's go what I wanted to do is let's go back and look at maybe some of the city I sort of have a memory of maybe somebody doing a physics tree so let's look at both of these and see if there is one my version of objectoriented fractals creating a forest randomly ooh oh cool so look at this got to get up to 21 million its interactive see see whoa sender version that's super nice let's go back to the original recursive tree Oh wrong one just cuz there might be more pink fractals for us look at these oh that's lovely look at this got some leaves on a pink fractal forest you had me at pink very nice fractal forest oh that's lovely good these beautiful scenes of fractal trees and dynamically customizable implementation in Java oh I'm always afraid to click on YouTube videos oh that's me oh this is me lots of people watch that video a wait was that this is how did I know that was just in the github sorry this is May 30th 2016 over three years ago look okay let me show you something brown just nice beep can you see can you see what's happened to me in three years can you see can you see that I am very distinguished I suppose okay oh boy that's really disturbing okay okay go away go away go away all right so let's get started by building upon the fractal trees objectoriented so I'm gonna go to the challenge I'm going to do let's try as always I always forget this alright I am back sorry about that everybody as always I always forget off this stop this stop so usually I use rechargeable batteries which is why I just put in the mic but there was somebody else had used that borrow the spike and had put batteries in it and so I was just letting those finish which I probably should have done knowing that I was gonna livestream but I don't know waste it so thus I guess you have not realized that I'm back soon enough all right so I've got the old challenge here running in the browser I've got my chrome developer tools open and I've got my code open here I'm not a hundred percent sure about this font size it seems a little small is it okay should I make it a little bigger did I change it and her font size let's just try like thirty two I feel like it's what I usually do that feels better to me it's so I'm gonna stick with that all right now before I start the college I'm gonna update this this was written so long ago down the tree for the paper to write the code on hmm then I typed var back in the day that was the way to name a variable so I'm gonna change this I know it should be Const I know it should be Const I'm just not a Const kind of person so I'm gonna change all these to let maybe I maybe I should be maybe I will become I'll Const person for today alright that looks good alright I'm gonna I want to update this for es6 basically and here well now talk about ancient technology constructor function I'm gonna change these to es6 classes this is really exciting for you to watch I'm sure and we could probably write some interesting regular expression or script to automatically do this but what I'm doing is what's wrong what did I get wrong should like Auto format I guess it's just still these are the functions I'm gonna change these to let this is another function whoops just get rid of this okay there we go we've got the branch clap is now a class and control D multi select based on next occurrence yeah there's actually I think I saw some Visual Studio code plugin or script that will actually update your old constructor function syntax to es6 classes but you know I I find it soothing sometimes to do the manual tedium of like just changing everything changing a bearable a manually cut it so I'm a baby I'm like well it's very clear that I'm kind of a weirdo but I don't know maybe that's a very normal thing maybe you might find some peace in your life by there to worry about finding some script to automate stuff just really taking your time alright let's make sure this still works cool too much nonsense here hold on I'm gonna do this because I'm just gonna go grab I would like just to go grab this which is I don't need that I might use the Dom library I might use the sound library but I sort of feel like taking those off I've got version 9 and then I also need branch j/s and so now oh it's looking for style dot CSS which I'm not using all right so we're good and I have updated my code for EF yeah ethics mr. Maugham asks why is var bad bars not bad far I love you you were you were good I still use you sometimes I see you on code examples it makes me I feel something but var is a I would say somewhat deprecated way of declaring a variable and if you would like to know more about that may I suggest watching my video let versus var supposed to like fly in and and show you a little clip of it I don't understand why that doesn't happen if I don't have like some kind of just say it usually happens Oh live life okay boy it's been three my real I said I was gonna get started really quickly it's been 35 minutes okay but now I'm really gonna get started I think that I'm gonna make a couple more adjustments I don't feel like I need to step through built the tree each time in mousepressed so this is doing this is weird let me let me say we get rid of mousepressed and then let me see what happens here that's just gonna do the beginning of the tree but I want to do this some amount of times like this and then I think I'm gonna get rid of the leaves they're not really I mean the leaves would be an interesting thing to add back in but it's kind of not the point of what I'm doing so I'm gonna do n iterations there we go six let's see what it looks like with seven right you can see if I do 12 whoops here we go that's kind of nice all right so we see that this works happy little trees yeah you know I don't people make the boss raw Bob Rock pub boss raw a buzz Rob just got me boss Rob from now on people make the Bob Ross reference and I very much appreciate it I am a huge Bob Ross fan myself I don't know that it's so accurate Bob Ross is a was a is a soothing calming wonderful presence lots of artistic talent and thoughtfulness I think that I'm just hyper frenetic weirdo who's coding on YouTube it's kind of not the same thing world record beard it's Movember not yet almost Movember all right I think I don't want to have I like how it looks this way but I'm gonna reduce that coating train sponsored by brilliant water brilliant org okay okay so I think I'm ready to get started and I sort of feel like today might be a day of not editing this later into a coding challenge but I don't know why I think that but I think I'll act like it is because just in case this is just like these amazing we just have this like our a total perfect Zuma zone Zen happy tree making we might as well give ourselves the opportunity to make that into a nice little package that somebody could find more easily than watching this live stream nonsense okay all right um let's see what else we need I think we're good I should show you by the way just a tease something else that's coming soon on the coding train I have some more props I mean this is a little bit just this my if I might find this disturbing this strange unicorn but also it's just that it's got green oh my goodness this is really gonna be a problem nazia is not gonna like editing this whiteboard wonder just give me a second here I actually have a remote control app that's a chance that that's gonna allow me to fix this camera right now oh I'm still connected okay okay okay I'm going to I'm going to do something very exciting which I'm gonna control this camera from this remote control app and I think maybe what I want is to turn the ISO down is that better better I think that's better now okay I think that's the best thing unfortunately I still so I have these like Sony cameras and I'm having trouble with the white balance I'll show you right now it's on automatic white balance which makes the is a problem but I can't seem to figure out like this is like some of the other settings I think you know I don't think that's better warm white is that better these are like automatic settings I like this one that's like if it's cloudy yes so I'm just gonna or daylight which it's not in here I'm just gonna go back to auto all right turn it one more I said I think I did already so hopefully you can tell me I'm gonna leave it like this right now but the reason why I have so much trouble with these cameras cuz i have them mounted on the wall which means i can't see the menu i have a confidence monitor so I can see what it's seeing but because I want clean HDMI out I can't see the menu on the conference monitor one of these days I'll have a perfect at least they don't go to sleep after 30 minutes they'll go to sleep after they overheat Auto is fine okay here we go everybody one more ISO down that was at 510 all right I'll do one more ISO down okay think so it's that it's not 640 right now 500 okay how's that I think it's gonna be good it's gonna have to be good enough I don't know how much I'm gonna use the whiteboard okay hopefully that helped all right we really like really got it you know I procrastinate because I'm afraid this is this is very much something that I have not done before and did not practice for this I have used I've made a fractal tree before and I've used the physics library that I intend to use which is toxic libs Jas let me open that up is there a CDN for it I just forgot but it's fine I'll download it if I need to and also let's see if I could find this a project that I want to reference is skittish tree by Martine Bravo I think this is it yeah skittish tree 2011 think there's a nice document let me add Martine Bravo's name here I feel like it was on this is from the spring show but there was a nice video of it I'm looking for it was made as a video installation I guess I'll just this will this will work Oh Paley Center this is what I'm looking for I want to show you this project so this is called skittish tree it's a project made by Martine Bravo and it's an interactive project where the tree kind of has physics and responds to you and you can see that it's like soar like adding appendages and being very skittish so this is kind of like what I hope to accomplish to create a tree structure that each connection is has a springlike connection to it and I think it's responding to sound if I remember correctly this actually isn't the video I was looking for but that's fine there was an installation that was on of this project that was on like in a store window that's that's the memory of this video that had thank you ruts neighs 32 for donating to the National Arbor Day Foundation and it is time for us to finally make some trees here we go and maybe all right here we go so I'm going to act like this is gonna get edited later decoding challenge and maybe it will maybe it won't hello and welcome to a special team trees coding challenge in today's coding challenge well I guess I'm gonna say could you make the trunk thicker yes all these things are possible hold on just wait hello and welcome to a special team hello and welcome to a coding challenge this is a special coding challenge it is a fundraiser for the team trees initiative you can look at the find the donate button and make a donation to the National Arbor Day Foundation to plant the goal with the goal planning 20 million trees $1 per tree so please join me in this initiative and help plant a tree and for what I'm gonna do I've made a lot of coding challenges that have to do with algorithmic trees and plants and various things and this is from coding challenge number 15 objectoriented fractal tree this is the result of it I'm going to build upon this code and attempt to add physics to it so that the tree could sway and wobble in the wind I'm feeling this is gonna go terribly wrong and but maybe you'll learn something and be inspired to make your own algorithmic tree and to perhaps even better plant a tree or donate some money to help plant a tree the physics library that I'm going to use is called toxic libs Jas so toxic libs jess is actually a port of a library called toxic libs made by Carsten Schmidt aka Toxie it was a processing library that I used to use a lot and is featured in my nature of code book and this is a JavaScript version of it it has lots of features but the feature that I want to use from it is called verlet physics or valve alley rally physics what I'm looking for right here is 2d physics simulation can I click on that that's not a thing to click on so thank you too so toxic libs just no toxic libs was originally written by Carsten Schmidt for processing I mentioned that and poured into JavaScript by Kyle Phillips haptic data on Twitter so say thank you to haptic data on Twitter how do I get it getting started is it is it it's available through NPM which means I should know how to do this but can I use like ol toxic lives okay oh that's examples the website yeah one package is this the library no that's this is the examples I mean I could just download it but I'm being stubborn toxic libs Jas there we go so there must be a way now somebody will tell me I can use that like uh none package.com slash something it'll just like automatically take me to it right this do it no no one will tell me nobody will tell me okay NPM wait I know how to do this ml five I can since ml five does this right it should work the same if I do unpackage comm slash well let's see toxic libs zero what was the version that was the latest zero point three point three zero point three point three and then it's probably just called let's see what happened so I do this in top right that doesn't help me version zero point three point three let's see cloud fair oh it's on cloud fair zero point one point three no but that seems like an old version I will try CD NJ s cloud fair okay bit ly / OH J J M leoj89 es Mozart many E's no just America want whomp bit ly bit ly / j ml e OG want that doesn't work from terminal npm install' toxic lives plus j s oh this is going so well so far no I don't want to do npm install i'm avoiding doing npm install on purpose gosh darn it toxic lives dot j yes that's what I forgot No no just no dot seems weird though oh no but I want to do toxic lives yes jazz deliver ah there we go thank you violet saves the day Thank You violet w WJ s deliver dotcom slash package / NP m / toxic libs j s there we go and actually all I want is physics 2d I don't know that I need I don't need that I don't need you till in geometry so well okay this is helping me sort of how do I get a link I just want a link download I guess I could just download it I'm stubborn I refuse to download it it's hosted via a CDN different versions copy to clipboard copy URL oh I see great oh this is not this is not going well there's no built version of the package that's crazy but there's not one point 8k viewers what wait what's going on here I'm I'm not you know what I'm no longer to be stubborn why are all these people watching hello everybody welcome to the Kodi train thank you thank you I'm gonna coach stuff I swear I don't just sit here and read random numbers very sweaty very sweaty there's no built package it's okay everybody I know how to deal with this I'm gonna go to my nature of code examples where I keep a built version of the library which is here NFC examples p5.js libraries toxic libs do I have like a toxic libs helper thing let's see simple spring libraries toxic lips okay I'm just gonna use this I'm just gonna download this version of library I'm gonna have it local I have a built version look it's version zero point three point three Thank You Kyle Phillips apparently I've never had this many people watching the live stream before I'm kind of freaking out a little bit I'm gonna hit raw I think I should do like a probably a beginner tutorial or something not this fractal tree physics we're gonna make a new folder we're gonna call it libraries think I'm gonna get to the coding everybody I'm gonna do something I'm gonna be I'm gonna do meaningful stuff here I'm taking this very seriously all of a sudden I don't there's I made this toxic libs helper thing for the nature of code book where am I like I don't even remember where I was how's that how come that's gone I was on that page somebody must have like tweeted or something examples I don't think let me get that helper let me see what's in that helper thing so for the nature of codebook which for the examples I also made an extra file called toxic helper oh it doesn't really do anything you know what all it does is to make aliases to the classes I want to use so that every time I want to make like a gravity behavior or an attraction behavior I don't have to write toxic physics about 2d so this is actually useful so I will also save this and I will put this in libraries and then I can close all this stuff I can go back to the code and let's add these other libraries like I have like all bye notifications on do not disturb so I'm gonna go to toxic libs jf and what is it called toxic helper dot j s then I'm gonna hit refresh it doesn't find it because I made a folder called libraries so one of the unfortunate things about the way that I'm working right now is and if I were if I had a better setup I would probably do like a pictureinpicture type thing but I have to switch back and forth between the browser view and the code view it just lost like a hundred no surprise like a whole bunch of people came to me like somebody clearly told them like hey go check this out team trees National Art Day Foundation then everybody came like okay there's a very strange person just jabbering on and like searching for like a file that doesn't exist and just not refusing to give up that's me I also like to read from my book a million random digits with 100,000 100,000 normal deviates point negative 29 d2 0.60 2 also negative one point zero one seven point five zero nine point six six four point nine one seven point three one zero point one six okay everything's gonna be okay yeah I could have used that I could have just delivered those github links I know I know but I would have had to figure that out now would have taken me a while so where was I in this thing that's definitely getting edited later I went ahead and downloaded the files toxic lives and toxic helper KS those are built version toxic lives such as is a built version of the library that I'm using a local copy of and toxic helper KS is a JavaScript file that has toxic helper is a JavaScript file that I created for my examples from the nature of codebook that aliases some of the classes that I want to use from the toxic libs library so what is the next step here I have this code this code creates this idea of a branch a branch a branch is an object that has two points a and B and by definition a branch and I really did not draw this in a way that makes any sense a branch is an object that has two points a which is a vector X Y and B which is another vector X Y so this is B and this is a then I choose to draw a line between those two points after that each branch birth so to speak or to two branches that are connected from its point be it becomes the point a for those two new branches those get bees and so on and so forth this is the process of recursion this idea of a function in this case an object being defined according to itself a branch by definition is a line connected to two other branches and those two other branches by definition or lines connected to two other branches and those are lines connected to other branches and so on and so forth and by iterating over this list of branch objects and then drawing them in the window I have this particular pattern but it is a static pattern it is a static pattern it does not move it does not animate I have just basically calculated all of these points and drawn lines so what I want to attempt to do in this coding challenge is say in addition to a branch being a line between two points each point is going to be what's called a particle or in this case of Val a particle verlet particle 2d that's the technical term in the Toxic lives library so all of these are particles and this particular line is a spring connection so a spring is a you know as a entity of that that is a connection a joint what are some other words event an edge joint connection what's in matter da chance I could I could use matter Jas maybe I should have used matter Duchess yes whatever I'm using toxic limbs what not you the viewer will go make a version this would matter not chance after but it is a connection that has a bunch of properties like rest length at what what is its length at which it will come to rest right it um as well as a property called K the spring constant and that will by playing around with these values I'll get various amounts of springiness and elasticity to these connections alright alright so let's attempt to do this I don't remember how to do toxic libs wouldn't it be nice if there was like a tutorial for it somewhere nature of code calm read now physics library a toxic lives okay let's take a look here so the first thing that I need to do it looks like is make a physics world so I'm going to create a variable I'm going to call it physics and in setup I'm going to say physics equals new verlet physics 2d I think I need to say 2d like I can check by going into my libraries here verlet physics 2d so you can see this is what the helper does maybe this is a bad idea I don't know just puts these class names in the global space global namespace okay so I've made a physics world I can do things like set the world's bounds that might be a that's probably important for me to do let's do that why not so let's do this so and this I think this will still work I'm creating a rectangle that is defined by the canvas so the boundaries of this world are the canvas itself I'm not going to call physics update right now because I actually don't want to update the physics I just want to get the building blocks in place and slowly turn them on to see what happens so what I want to do is create a verlet particle 2d for every one of these points so how does this work how does my branch object work I have a beginning and an end so those when I make those they are I call create vector ah so what I'm doing to create the first the root of the tree we come back over here the root of the tree is a branch that connects these two starting points and right there there it is root equals branch between those two points I think what I want to do is change those points to make them verlet particles so instead of a plane p5 vector I'm gonna make them a verlet particle to D and a verlet particle to D now that's gonna break everything because all of the math and everything that I'm doing for the entire example depends on those two points being vectors P Phi vectors now there vernal at particles DD so I could like run the code and see where the first error I get is this dot set weight is not a function what so let's go do sketch jeaious line 13 what that's weird wait there's an error on this line Oh guess what I forgot I forgot the new keyword I am making an object I am calling the constructor of the Verla particle 2d class I must say nu nu nu now let me refresh again now this is good this is what I wanted to see happen derp da alt is not a function why is it not a function well what is derp what is mult so let's go look for branch J s line 21 and here interestingly enough it was fine with p5 Oh weird so this is very uncomfortable I think if I recall correctly I have something in my book that addresses what I want to talk about did not mean to be referring to this so much there was like a table like vector table thing that I know no all right I'm gonna not scroll forever and like drive you all insane let me let me talk about what's going on here so the original version that I wrote made use of something called a p5 vector and a p5 vector is a vector an entity with magnitude direction as an X component of Y component and it has a bunch of math operations and they're called things like add subtract multiply et cetera normalized I've lots of videos on this stuff I just made it instead of a p5 vector a verlan particle 2d a virulent particle 2d is actually an instance of something in toxic libs that's called a vex 2d guess what effect Judi is it's a simple vector but it's not p5 XP v vector it's toxic lives vector so my code will all still work just fine if I find the corresponding function in toxic lives that corresponds to things like multiply subtract add etc I kind of figure out where the documentation is because I think I got to look all this stuff up it looks like 800 viewers it's kind of hilarious it's still down and nuts that I have there's 1200 people watching here but alright so let me look what's the best place for me to look at the toxic lives documentation so is it on this website getting started toxic webs follows physics 2d I know how to find it differences from the original mmm github contributes rent bill I know where I think where I'm going to look I'm just going to go and look but toxic lives Javadoc this is crazy what I'm doing I probably should take a mulligan and go and use and go and use matter yes but I'm as you know me I'm stubborn so I'm in the jaw so this so I'm looking for this is the Java original Java libraries documentation and I'm just going to do the mental gymnastics to translate from that into JavaScript if you can enjoy okay it's okay everything's gonna be okay just go right past that back to D we can actually go to frames and then uh Boog that didn't work here we go I'm gonna look for ad so where where am I wearing my first P v vector dot sub so I think the equivalent of this will be this dot end dotsub this dot begin let's take a look at that sub so it subtracts vector V and returned the result as a new vector that's what I want so one of the things when working with these vectors it's a little bit tricky because sometimes you want to adjust the vector you're working with that's subtract self like subtract this from myself but toxic Libs when you call that sub it makes a new vector which is not al p v vector works very confusing I know that's okay now rotate this is just do that does it have a rotate function rotate all right I guess that works multiply I think it's just mu L I have a memory of it just being mu L scale is it called scale scale no whoa boat wait yes yes yes yes yes its scale cuz I'm not I'm not doing the dot product or vector multiplication I'm just taking a vector and multiplying it by a scale or a single number so if you think of a vector is this line represents the vector if I multiply it by two got that line if I multiply it by 0.5 I got that line and what the fractal code is actually doing is each branch is 2/3 the length of the previous one far so I'm scaling it by 0.67 scale new end is this dot and to add direction and then I make a new branch that should work that should be the same this is the recursion I branch out to make a new brand they only can make two branches I have branch a and branch B that is definitely an instance of but I'm just gonna keep going this is terrible that this is the faces will get code change that that looks good well I dare I say that's all I needed to do I got something wrong definitely got something wrong what did I get wrong looks like the scaling isn't working properly scale scale like I sort of feel like that's like if I comment this out same result what did I do wrong does it make a new scale self scale self scale self I bet you it's that I don't want to make a new vector that's scaled I want to scale myself there we go so I have now successfully recreated the fractal tree with berlet particles all right so interestingly enough those are all particles let's just test a little weird theory of mine if I think Berlet physics in toxic limbs will automatically add a default gravity it might not but I am going to oh this is weird I'm gonna take this out this is drawing a tree we're gonna definitely want to do some jittering and stuff I'm going to say physics dot update and what I expect to happen well what do you think is gonna happen if there's a default gravity and these are all just particles and online between them what's gonna happen give you a minute to think about it this is like how it works on brilliant org by the way you didn't like a puzzle I have to think about then you give the answer okay so the default gravity must not be there so let's add gravity and I believe the way that I do that is I say physics dot add I think I have to go back to the nature of code book to look this up yeah so let's do it like this so this is I can add a behavior to the world and I can add a gravity behavior and I can have a vector this is very confusing but there's like this is so what's happening here so the first thing I do is create a vector like say like zero negative 0.5 or 0.5 which is like a vector that points down so this is the vector and I want to turn this into a gravity behavior meaning there's a force on everything pointing down and then we're to add that to the world meaning will PI that force to all of the particles so let's actually grab this code and go here just put that in here whoa no wrong code what a completely copy bases the wrong thing oh I'm not even in the right thing you know what the good news is oh there's no good news for you I'm just in the wrong camera I'll tell you about that later got some new recording systems all right so let me do this so I'm gonna add this here now I'm adding this gravity behavior and whoops you just I think I could give myself a little bit more room here to code yep I'm adding this gravity behavior now let's try this again to you to not have gravity gravity behavior 2d I don't think that's that doctor fine did I not save no hmm physics dot update physics dot update oh oh no no wait let's see mmm show no no mmm if you're adding to Berlet per branch will to ver let's be create so this is a great point I'm definitely gonna have to fix that update maybe needs a delta time maybe it does it does really particle am I not what it could be that the physics is happening but I'm not drawing it correctly so I have like a secret no loop in there somewhere mmm very sad physics not bad behavior console dot log frame count let's just make sure the loop is happening the loop is happening all right let's be a little bit more debug e let's get rid of all these trees and let's let's just make a particle called PE and we'll put it in the middle of the window and then we will do this and draw it points all right so this is a good sign does it need at all the time I guess I could give it a delta time all right let's go look at my examples never hurts to look at an example where am I going this is not this is the book and one with the examples libraries toxic lives let's just look at this one so I did okay how do you know what it's weird that it's oh no hmm no I don't think mmhmm I think I might know what the problem is I think I think I know what the problem is just hold on so I'm thinking but no but then I did it it's weird let's just look at the sketch really physical behavior set world's bounds does I mean couldn't really be that like adding the behavior first makes a difference Oh Oh weird you know what I have this suspicion I'm making a new Verla particle by passing in the X&Y I think toxic Libs wants me to do this why it worked anyway to draw in the right place no that doesn't seem to make a difference I'm just take more drastic measures in a second to make sure my example is actually working well let's make sure this example works let's go grab this repo which I'm sure I already have but okay so the gravity is definitely working in this example so gravity does work at trees to cons everybody's telling me everybody's telling me everybody's telling me everybody's telling me every oh sell me I know what it is everybody relax I got it got it if you make a particle the particle does not live in the world unless you put the particle in the world if you plant a tree if you put a seed in the ground if you do not water it I don't know what the right metaphor is here it's not really fitting but I do need to say physics dot add particle that particle and then goodbye goodbye all right so now what I was expecting to see let's take this out take this back out and the whiteboard camera just went off I don't know why probably because it's overheating put this back in and what I need to do whenever I make a branch whenever I make a branch I need to where do I make the particles interesting this is weird there is no do I never copy this is weird something weird is going on here in that I've only made this is the only place where I make the particle and then and then when I make a new branch oh this is a problem so I'm not this is weird I'm the particles are just pointing to each other I'm so confused no this is making a new particle I see the end is a new particle and the beginning is the same particle so this is actually correct this is making a new particle here so olan let's just one step at a time this is confusing because this looks like the only place I'm making a new particle but let me say physics dot add particle a and physics dot add particle B and P is not define cuz I don't need that anymore I'm gonna just take out the point one just let it do its default time step look at that so only it only fell right there because that's the only particle I added into the physics world so where are the other particles only other time I'm actually making a particle is in this new end the rest this is some vector math and the new branch gets a reference to its current end it doesn't actually make a new particle that's very important because I want everything to stay connected so this I've actually written the code in a thoughtful way where this will work properly all I need to do is say physics dot add particle new end and then right here physics dot add particle new end now let's see what happens okay I don't like that don't like that PETA add forces not a fun oh it's not a verlet particle this has made a Veck 2d so I need to say new ver let particle boy this was much more complicated than I imagined it would be apologies to everybody watching I need to wrap the end this is very confusing because what I toxic lives is using this this turned out to be a bit of a sophisticated coding challenge which requires quite a bit of facility and experience with objectoriented programming inheritance inheritance is a feature of objectoriented programming where objects can pull properties from other objects and so I made a Veck 2d that's not a ver let particle a ver let particle is a vector D but effect because it inherits from vector D but if vector D is not a ver let particle so because I made a vector D I need to make it a ver let particle and I can do the same thing here and now I can hit refresh and there we go that is the wierdest collapsing tree ever so the good news is this is not what I wanted to accomplish all you know just having a single gravity force they all fall in exactly the same rate I don't want it to fall I wanted to stay standing up so let's take out that gravity behavior right now and let's take a look I have my tree again let me also remove the number of iterations there's too much detail here maybe I want ultimately all that detail but right now it's too much and I'm about halfway through so I'm going to take a break to talk about brilliant the sponsor of today's livestream and also remind you about team trees kind of like the second sponsor we've got two sponsors today but what was I doing I took that out oh yeah no I wanted to change the number of iterations let's just go down to six so I want to work with the physics with fewer points and lines and then once that's working maybe I could add more so people are telling me about live server and I do know sometimes I do use live server though very rarely on a live stream but actually I'd like to explicitly refresh the browser because sometimes I don't want the change to be seen I want to change the code and talk about a little bit and then have it be seen so I like to have full control okay all right let me have a little water 6 o'clock so I want to take a minute even the by the way in the last 40 minutes I lost a thousand just kind of crazy hi Elias um I want to talk to you about brilliant org brilliant org is a website that I really enjoy using let me show you a bit about the homepage so becoming great at math science and computer science does not have to be dull hopefully that's something that you've discovered by watching this particular YouTube channel I mean I maybe I guess I think probably I'm not dull I have a lot of faults yeah I'm dull in many instances though you can find me irritating I suppose anyway moving on but brilliant it's a problemsolving website with a handson approach it has 60 interactive courses I like to really show you what just all of these courses are there's one the ones that I'm that are particularly most relevant although all of these are things you could really find as forming the basis of stuff that you might want to code but there's a computer science fundamentals course there's logic courses there's number theory a trigonometry oh boy you really need the trigonometry course if you're watching the coding train because they have being comfortable with sine and cosine and tangent those functions and polar coordinates is really necessary so brilliant is built for ambitious and curious people who want to excel at problemsolving and understand the world and one of the two things I love the most about brilliant there's many things that I do enjoy and if I come back to here for a second and just pull up the website is one is in in the courses and in the challenges are many ideas for me to try to code things and I having done 150 plus coding challenges I run out of ideas so there's so much content on brilliant that I can find lots of new ideas the other thing that I love is just if I have a little extra time on my hands I like to do these daily challenges and this one I looked at it earlier I didn't solve it although I think I have an idea of how to solve it let me hold on I'm my view is a little bit off and I think I can take this off right now as well so so this is today's challenge and by the way if you want to follow along with this go to brilliant org slash coding train you can sign up for free and you could do all the daily challenges for free right there on the website you can add your own answer you can add your own explanation if you want to unlock all of the courses you can sign up for a premium subscription and you can get a discount by going through that coding train link the first 200 people will get a 20% discount so what I like about this challenge is it's like a puzzle so this is a little but nice puzzle we got a grid here and I need everything in row zoom in on this a little bit more so I can point to it better I need everything in this top row to add up to six this first column to add up to four and so on and so forth and these are the numbers that I have to work with so I need to place them somewhere so if I'm going to solve something like this first I could just take around and try it that's that's probably the best way is like be like a well I put the three here well if I put a 3 here and I put a 2 here that's 708 and that's no good then I don't have to put a 1 here but look at this I just unlocked a little clue how to solve this I would have look for things that have only one possibility it's always a good way to start right here this column has to add up to sick and I've lost the chat so let me by sorry about this everybody wrong Mouse and pull the chat up so ah sorry folks go back to me come back to me puzzle grid so the only thing that can go there is a what how to put this one here so like oh come on well look let's reset I think I did something like weird there we go so you can see this lights up because I've had it add up to 6 so what else only has one possibility so 2 plus 1 is 3 to get 7 I could do a bunch of different things I could do tutus I could do 1 into 3 there's a bunch of ways I could get 7 out of 3 numbers here 2 to get 4 ok I can only put ones here and this is good because I got to use up my ones where the only possible thing here there's no way there's no zero so I can't put another to it 3 would get me to 5 so huh know why I'm having trouble there we go I just so what I like about this is I would love to actually you could make this in p5 so this could be a coding challenge like make a puzzle generator that has all I mean this is really hard to do all this draganddrop a nice little interface and haven't been to really hard to program this kind of stuff I would probably make a much you know like a more crude version of this it just has that is this thoughtful in terms of user interaction design but now now we're getting somewhere so is there are there other places where I only have one option by the way the reason why I'm looking at this is because the the question here is how many different ways can this puzzle puzzle be completed so thing is like how many solutions can I find knows anybody knows you can you can say alright and Simon is reminding me that the you do the daily challenges for free and actually the 7 latest daily challenges are for free but the you need the premium subscription for the archive of them Thank You Simon Simon is like my brilliant sponsor assistant appreciate that all right what else here this is nine okay I think I have to put to get nine I need a three and a two can I put those in any place so I could put them here so now I'm just like trying and then if this is seven I needs a 3 in a 2 and this is 5 a little no I just thing we're on aah so that doesn't work no no no no I'm fine was I just do three right because yeah a 1 goes here and a 1 goes here yeah I did it I solved it so there's one solution there's at least one solution did this in sort of a weird way what happens where was I with this sure there's a scientific way of doing this let me go back to what this is where I was where I knew these are the only possibilities so what did what did I do next clearly forgot didn't I put like a three and a two ow camera I should turn the so apologies for this the camera I'm going to turn the fan on this nice fan to cool down the camera I can turn it back on the focus I might lose the focus let's see I think actually the focus stayed this time whatever I did on the camera keeps the focus which is good yeah I'm still in focus right I think so um everyone solve this I should just do these in advance it would make my life much easier bottom rows swap the two and the three people are telling me wait hold on okay oh hey that's what I was doing let's let's do it scientifically so let's say I put the 3 and the 2 here that's 9 so now I think there's probably only gonna be one way for me to do this my intuition tells me that because if I've got to get 9 I need so if I gotta get 7 I need the the 3 plus 2 plus 2 what no I need the three in the one the only thing is I can put here the 3 and the one I can't put the 3 here the 3 has to go here the one has to go here ok and this is going to get me back to this solution and now the 1 has to go here and the 2 has to go here okay well what no no no no no the 2 has to go wait so maybe there is no solution if I put the 3 in the 2 like this the focus is no good let's check I have a special way of focusing that looks pretty good actually it's a little bit off you're right and fix it a little bit wait okay that added up to nine so to get to five this has to be a three in a two and I can't put the three there because that would already be six okay so this has to be a two and this has to be a three no and this has to be a one so then that's four that's seven that's all right so that was a solution with the three on the right and the two there so let's take everything off two one one three three two and let's try putting the 3 here and the 2 here now can I still get a solution I need a 2 and a 1 to get to 5 and to get to 7 I need a 3 and a 2 so the 3 can't go here so the 2 has to go here the 3 has to go here and then to get to 7 the 1 goes to get the 6 the 1 goes here and then a 1 goes here yep okay there's definitely two solutions there's two solutions can I get an idol I think those were the only so I don't want to belabor this there's probably way to make this provable but I'm pretty sure that as I was solving it there was no way to go and there were no there was no like branch this is relates to trees because really what I'm doing is like or they're right here now they're more than one options I could take let's try them both maybe one hits a dead end but I think all the while though I had to put things in certain places so I think the answer is 2 I'm not going to hit submit just yet what I'm gonna do is I am going to take a little break you I would ask you to work on this sign up for billion org thank you for billion org for sponsoring the coding train as is a fundraiser for team trees I will be donating the sponsorship fee from brilliant to the net to the Arbor Foundation through the team trees initiative so thank you so much for being for for sponsoring the coding train so that I can participate in this fundraiser and give money as well so I'm gonna take a short break for like no more than five minutes let's see fact check me on this signup for brilliant org make a donation to T at team trees or go through the donate button that's part of the fundraiser and I'll be back to finish the coding challenge in about five minutes so I'm gonna mute my microphone I'm gonna move my microphone to make myself disappear and I'm gonna get some water take a little break and be back and refresh I'm gonna say once again coordinates can we justify warming the Cartesian coordinates autotuned and the internet will fix that coordinates coordinates as always I always forget this never forget this stop I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this star this star song never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me sorry everybody now you can hear me I was saying I took a little bit of a longer break than usual cuz I got very warm in here so I propped open the door and I turned all the lights out that's why it looks kind of dark in here so I'm going to turn the lights back on and everyone's saying muted no sound you will realize that I have fixed that in a second the lights are back on and putting this down here my keys in my pocket I am back and so here I am and I am here to give this a try so I was like keeping an eye on the chat and there were so many interesting things that people said about this puzzle how to solve it somebody said you could solve it with green and dissent which I have no idea how that would work but other people were talking about how you can use like a backtracking algorithm and you're absolutely right I didn't see a lot of people give me an answer so I'm just gonna hope that my answer like answer two is correct let's see we go correct alright so thank you so much brilliant org tri brilliant for free at brilliant org slash coding train you can do the daily challenge you can post you can read about what actually what I really liked one of the things I love doing is there's always so many really interesting discussions about how to solve this stuff I mean just look at the time people put in to explaining different ways with screenshots and diagrams to solve these puzzles that is something that I really do love so I encourage you to put your own there sometimes I'll make a p5 sketch and paste it in that's something you could do and thank you to play org for sponsoring today's fundraiser for team trees the sponsorship 3 is being donated to the team trees fundraiser so if you feel so inclined you could make a donation as well all right I'm going to what am I doing here turn that off and close this window and we are back we are back to the coding challenges 620 have I been streaming for almost two hours I think this is gonna probably take if I'm being totally honest another hour but hopefully less hopefully less so I can close some of this other stuff here I'm gonna leave that opens I might need it and here we go was that 100k in an hour I so I can't actually see what the tally is nor can I see Wow many donations that have come in through this livestream can you see that maybe you can't maybe if I actually hold on if you'll feel humor me for a second I do have a dashboard here I used to keep try a second laptop you'll notice there's no second laptop anymore it doesn't even exist but I do have a monitor over here that I can look at where I'm running open broadcast studio and if I go over here I go to this dashboard mmm no I don't see anything so I'm afraid to press buttons here I still can't figure out what caused suddenly a thousand more people to join I when I was taking my break I like looked at my phone and started to check like Twitter or like but I didn't see any kind of notification or share or anything like that so but yeah David is saying the total tally is three hundred sixtyfive thousand which is kind of amazing I mean I'm a tiny little morsel here I think there's there's many many channels or all releasing videos and participating this fundraiser today I believe it was its mr. beast who started this initiative I do have a little document that I have here for reference team trees started in May 2000 nineteen when the internet internet challenged mr. beast at rant plant 20 million trees to commemorate hitting the 20 million subscriber milestone fans then suggested he band together with a bunch of other youtubers blah blah blah and the donations are going to the Arbor Day Foundation they are the longestrunning tree planting NGO with 47 years of experience and they have the same Charity Navigator rating as the American rate Red Cross the donations either through team trees or guts where I made my donation or the YouTube donate button or Arbor days team trees Facebook fundraiser are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree planting $1 plants one tree depending on your local laws it could be a taxdeductible donation and the trees will be planted in a variety of forests on public and private lands in areas of great need the goal is to plant trees on every continent not named Antarctica and their Arbor Day foundation's website can I get to that has a list I think I'm looking at different computer computer so I have a dog but I'm not going to read all this to you but if you have other questions please go to the team trees website and the team trees says it's 1.1 million maybe because more donations that come through the website itself all right so back to the coding so if anybody know I'm just out of because I'm you know you can't it's very hard to be a person who does YouTube livestream makes YouTube videos and not suffer from some amount of vanity and I suffer from a large amount of vanity probably if I'm being totally honest and I am quite curious holy I gotta lock see I'm gonna get to your question I am quite curious as to if whether there was some kind of mention about the coding train somewhere that's sent like a whole bunch of people that then promptly left and did any of you stay maybe you're still here from that then you never heard of the coding train and you're watching right now if so say in the chat so yah Twilio Loxy are you asking about this song this song is called Tori the dog and it is by a composer named Adam Blau Adam spelled ad AM and blouse spelled BL a you Adam isn't an old friend from college he is a film and television composer I believe he does the music for a lot of different things but most recently for the FX show you're the worst and this is a piece of music he wrote for something else that he lets me use Adam is the composer for Oh train theme song and so I think you could reach out to him on Twitter Adam Blau if I don't think this song is published anywhere I mean I have the mp3 file of it right here that's it but maybe you can get in touch to make a mini version of it okay all right anyone anyone in the chat I'm curious are you here for the first time and not just this is your first live stream but you had never heard of the coding train before today I'm curious to hear from you what did you hear here where'd you hear about the coding train but that aside I am going to I still have the fan on I don't think it's causing too much of a noise problem so I'm going to move on yes everyone's putting on coding garden with CJ donated $100 to the National Arbor Day Foundation I mean if there ever was a channel that aligns with team trees in its philosophy and its design branding it's the coding garden I mean technically is a garden where you have a tree that's more of like a forest to you you might have to be the coding forest but you've got tree growing plants it's good and my small little and and you can see cut nobody knows how to use tree related emojis better than CJ and the coding gardens so please check out the coding garden many many other CJ streams quite often at least nowadays I'm just getting notifications almost every day there's all these kind of tutorials especially like backend stuff that I don't do so much very thoughtful and organized tutorials okay in coding garden with CJ's in the chat I'm sure you could ask CJ of questions about the channel if you want no now press my to chew button and you will know how long the delay is because I just pressed it then and it appeared all right I'm procrastinating again I do want to go home it's Friday I'm kind of like a bit of a baseball nerd you know I don't know I think I'm Astros national about my team's but I'm excited to watch the World Series game is at 8 so I at least want to get home by then all right the next step that I want to try is not just have particles oh sorry everybody no signal let's turn this back on I'll see if the focus is okay should come alive in a second how's the focus on here it's probably this I think it's the same look good yeah it's fine okay instead of just having two particles and drawing a line to visualize the connection between those particles I won't you actually make a physics object that connects them and the kind of object I'm going to use is a spring so I've made many other video tutorial ins and many other I have at least one I've used toxic lip springs and a bunch of other video tutorials to do like a cloth simulation and other things that you could refer to but basically we've got a spongy elastic connection when I pull it I'm stretching it the force is going to go back in when I push it I'm compressing it and the force is gonna push it back out to its rest length so where do I want to add the spring I think it's going to be as simple as every time I make a branch I need to create a spring that connects the two particles this dot begin and this dot end so let me look at one of my old examples where I make a spring so this is some code that I pulled up from one of my nature of code examples where I make a string a spring a verlet spring 2d that connects two particles p1 and p2 it has a rest length the length at which it is at rest and then a strength or maybe that's the the number for K the spring constant I don't know exactly what it means that I can tune that number up and down to affect its elasticity we could probably look in the toxic lip stop documentation to read exactly what that means but we'll just tinker around so I think this should be let me actually just grab this I should be able to say make a spring connect this stop begin this dot end and the O what should the rest length be well the rest length should be the distance between the actual length of thus of the branch because I'm tree building the tree at rest and when I give it a little push maybe a little the branch is kind of I mean trees don't actually have Springs in them so I don't get me wrong this is not a realistic simulation I'm just trying out this idea to make it kind of to see what happens so it's a little bit unfortunate that when I make the branch I do have that distance yeah I think what I'm going to do is this is this is probably a little redundant and I could optimize later but I'm just gonna calculate the distance by saying the distance between this dot and X and why so I'm getting the distance between the beginning point of the end point and then that's the rest length and the spring constant I mean I'm just going to leave it at 0.01 since that was in one of my examples and then I want to say physics dot add spring spring so let's just see if this at least gives me no errors okay it works now here's the thing that's interesting what happens if I pull on one of them what if I just take one of these end points and I attach and I move it with the mouse so you can see in my example the way that I did this in my example is I'll like lock a particle I don't know that I need to do this but I can basically like override its XY position and set it to the mouse so if I go into drum you just copy this and I'll do like if mouse is pressed also I'm just to see if the physics is active I'm gonna write here so tree tree is an array that has all of the branches in it so let me just pull the very last one I could say can I say pop but that's gonna actually take it out of the array I'm just gonna access it by tree length minus 1 so that's the like last this is the last particle in the tree and I can say last dot lock if the mouse is pressed let me do exactly this set it to the mouse and unlock it okay here we go this is gonna be a little bit nuts I really have no idea what's gonna happen which one do we think it is is it down here or is it like over here let's a little last not lock is not a function oh it's a branch it's a branch that's an array of branches I want to take the particle that's at the end tree dot length dot end the particle is what I want to lock and there we go three with physics actually that's pretty cool all right mm I had a dampening force no actually I honestly have no idea what to do next I mean I want to lock the alright here's here's something I actually want to do let's lock the root so let's say a dot lock that very first particle should never move let's just try that right so there we go so that's kind of interesting if the tree has no structure to it whatsoever but it's kind of this is kind of fun how can I make this feel more tree like I mean like should I put gravity back in I need like some kind of dampening I need to like sort of hold itself up I kind of have an idea and I should mention that a lot of this is coming from that skittish coming in case this gets edited later say a lot of my ideas are inspired by a project by Martine Bravo called skittish tree that he worked on while he was a student here at ITP where I teach and I'm and if I recall correctly one of the things he did with that project was connect some of the end points to the top with Springs to hold up the tree but not draw those Springs so that's something I could try you could try and limit the rotation of the joints put name o negative gravity is such a smart idea why I didn't think of that I love this idea let's try that let's put the gravity behavior in for a second and just see what happens that's kind of fun look at that tree falling down all right let's this is by the way whoever sent a thousand people here maybe now is a good time to send us because I think this is kind of the interesting part to try to get this tree to do something let's make the gravity much weaker and go in the opposite direction okay ah look at that so this is actually in a way already what I sort of wanted to see the tree is kind of almost like swaying in the wind just by the nature of the spring forces and this sort of force that's pushing up one thing that I think would be really effective here is that you can add just like there's a global gravity behavior you can add an attraction behavior to the particles meaning they can attract each other and who had a negative one they can repel each other so if all the particles have a slight repulsion force then it won't allow them to get too close to each other so let me try adding that so when I create a particle a branch and and possibly would make sense for me to in many ways to lock both of these I mean what am i making is it a tree like that's now like the trunk is like really locked in place I don't know if that's a meaningful improvement but let me try adding let me try adding this attraction behavior so if I go to the branch object maile this jitter it's not being used let's take that out the branch is where I create the spring out of these two verlet particles so I think I could also say let repulsion equals new attraction behavior I honestly have no idea just speculate a new vet oh and I think I just give it a strength yeah wait let me look this up let me go back to the documentation and let me try to find let me go to where's the physics one I'm in core okay good I want to go into verlet physics attraction behavior oh I give it oh I give it the particle I don't add the behavior I there's so many things like there's a jitter parameter radius and strength okay I think what I do is I create a new attraction behavior I put it on the particle like this dot begin I give it a radius let's just say like 40 and a strength negative 1 so let's let's say repulsion 1 and repulsion 2 is on the end now do I have to add those I must say physics add behavior right repulsion one repulsion let's see if this does what I think it's gonna do yeah so it definitely does what I think it's gonna do but it's a little bit nuts and actually the repulsion behavior the radius and maybe strength should be dependent on its its level in the tree right so if we think about this fractal tree for a second if I were to draw what I'm doing right particle particle particle particle particle particle particle particle and I connect all these lines this is I bet something up weird what did I just do here this is basically what I've got so the each one of these particles has a sort of cone of repulsion and you can see that cone or that's not really a code it's a circle a circle repulsion should probably be smaller as it's getting further up the tree so that it sort of keeps its structure I mean again this is nothing to do with actual trees I'm just messing around with Springs and particles and having some fun but at least for the idea that I'm happening to create this sort of like simulated physics tree swaying in the wind I haven't even added any wind like some Pearlie noise or something this this I think would be a way to start so if I come back to this this is the variable that I'm talking about so I do I know about this distance so what if I just use that literal distance like I probably should use maybe like half the distance because it's a radius let's say half the distance acting a little bit crazy so I think this yeah skittish tree it's not maintaining its structure but it is kind of this crazy creepy crawly thing that I kind of love I think also this strength is kind of meaningful here like I could make it much weaker the interestingly enough the gravity is now so strong that what if I actually take out what if I don't have that negative gravity behavior like this is just the tree and this is actually in many ways I'm creating an example of a force directed graph aleck Moss is suggesting only put the repulsion force on the last particle on the end oh that's interesting right that's a meaningful idea adding that's yes that's actually a very important idea I think I'm duplicating because the end becomes the beginning of the next one I should only do one repulsion force that is a very good point yeah so this is more logical sort of whatever logic is assigned here what if I make it even weaker what if I make these Springs stronger yeah this this part here is really the issue like the branches start to like cross over strength of the branch should scale further out from the first branch should be ah yes so that's also true like I should this spring force like let's just say I make the spring force a 1 does that make it completely what's the word inelastic or elastic I'm gonna remember which is which but as if it's a metal rod there can't be springy so there's still the repulsion is an issue I mean issue bug or feature sunlight say feature there but this string and I could also do like I could say make it like 1/4 the radius yeah so this is kind of interesting so now what if I were to say let me make that oh the spring force of the repulsion force strength of the branch should scale further out from the first branch the weaker it should be the strength of the spring force or the repulsion force that could try either of those I kind of liked it when it was crazier to be perfectly honest I really like this idea of holding the tree up actually and then putting the gravity down because for example let's just put the gravity down again oh I'm not oops that's the wrong that's not a repulsion force it's an attraction force sorry meet a very weak oh oh no right I always forget the gravity is here if I put the gravity pointing down again the whole tree falls what if I every single very very last end point the last end points so for example where do i how do I find those so when n is 6 right if n let me just see if N equals 6 N equals 5 is the last one right just create a create a holder it's at the top I'm gonna take the branches in two separate variables and I'm going to make a spring at spring equals new a holder and a we're the rest length of a rest length of that distance and a strength of one and I want not a a dot end and let's do that twice and let's where did I just go there and that's it what am i doing I just need a little bit more room for my code physics add spring this is a ridiculous idea intermediate value is not a constructor whoa what is going on here hmm well what I guess I should probably draw these Springs you could apply forces using your forward kinematics code feels like that API is weird it should default to the distance between the two points given its rest length these are very good ideas I think I might leave this as an exercise to the viewer when n is 5 if it's makes 2 new branches make a spring between holder and the end and holders like this weird but they have arbitrary particle that I stuck oh oh I forgot to lock it in place I wonder yeah see now if only I could draw what it's doing so I think what would make more sense is for me to this is this is getting really ridiculous is to like have it hold itself up from not width but the end X point so like it's like there's like I'm building a little marionette I should really draw all these and then this is terrible pretty sure this is now gonna have each of them just to diagram what I'm doing it really helped for me to draw what I'm doing is if this is the top I'm putting something like right here that you don't see that like holds them off so I'm gonna like hold the tree up which is kind of ridiculous holder is not defined hold your wand holder on holder too old or too old or too old or too holders not too fast older one Oh everyone older too you should make the springs weaker so that they aren't metal rods oh maybe good point oh there's like the minimum and maximum I forgot about that there I'm holding the tree up do I even have the gravity pulling it down that's just perfect this is exactly what I was going for it let's just I'm curious what happens when these holder Springs are weaker really it doesn't make sense like they should be like come it would be a much more a much better way of doing this would be to kind of like attach them more like this I think some sort of like radial pattern probably but that was an interesting experiment but I think I'm gonna go back comment this out oops I'm gonna go back to the version that I have with negative gravity a repulsion force that is a factor the radius is a factor of the distance the length of the branch and the strength is in the negative direction and the spring force is much springier and let's see what we get here so this I like this brings me happiness now let's try to add I'm just curious let's add some is there a way to add dampening there must be I know there's there's the constraint function which would be good is there a dampening thing like particle behavior are these constraint oh there's all these constraint things there's minimum distance Springs that's probably something I should be using there's constraints I'm getting kind of kind of tired no what did a long time here Oh what Simon somebody said let's go attach them to their initial position with zero length Springs Oh fascinating idea whoa I like that idea add horizontal force proportional to the distance from the center of the screen yeah so many things I could try here and like you should all try these ideas maybe I can make a list of these ideas to talk about at the end I think I just want to make this kind of go crazy because I need to wrap this up but you're getting to see the challenge here so I want to what I wanted to Dilys do it I wanted to see if I could put some dampening I mean I know how to do this manually does toxic lives have inherent dampening from 3 months ago I did not expect to see a forum poster of 3 months ago this does not have an answer can I login can I reply to this oh this is the old forum so it's not from three months ago sorry this is from a very long time ago this is the archive of the old for forum so I can't reply to that oh look the nature of code calm maybe if I read that book it'll explain to me that would be nice lesson 5 default friction or dampening yeah J Myron Wow I remember that library this is from 2013 this discussion really like blasts from the past year what about friction no friction ah maybe watch this YouTube tutorial from 2015 it'll explain it to me I'm gonna give up on that I mean I could I could calculate a dampening force it's the angle which is what should be spring that's a very good point all right I have to stop here and offer suggestions for the community to do more fun stuff so couple things I I'm pretty happy with what this is doing it's not a realistic tree but it's sort of pleasant and interesting I bet you if you kind of we're thoughtful about how you draw this you might create some kind of like alien plant life creature it almost feels like more underwater ish like this is like an underwater plant so let me try to add a few more things to this number one is let me at least add it so that the branches are thicker I'm at the bottom and thinner at the top so that could be done by I could add a level variable here and this would have been useful for a lot of other things and every time I make a branch I give it its level so the root is level zero and a branch a branch B actually I could just give it the N here but I think I'll have the branch that it calculate the next level itself so the branch when it makes a new branch right here should say this dot level plus one and also right here this dot level plus one now when I draw it I can say stroke weight and let's just let me just say level for a second so that you see this is gonna work in the wrong way oh this dot level right so now we see it's thicker towards the top which is actually more like lab underwater creature plant like which I also quite enjoy but let's invert it so let's map this dot so let's say total levels equals six right now which goes here and then let's map this dot level which goes from zero to total levels and the stroke let's have the stroke weight go from 12 down to one and I'm missing a parenthesis somewhere I need another parenthesis here oh that is nice okay so already I'm enjoying this quite a bit boy it's kind of creepy could I maybe twelve to one is like too much and it probably should have an exponential or logarithmic some other scale it's linear right now let's do like eight yeah so it's a little less extreme and also let's try let's have like let's just push it to let's push it to eleven you need eleven this goes to eleven this fractal tree oh oh hold on hold on hold on everybody stop the chat spectral piano is giving me a good suggestion but here we go it's nice but it's not it can it not calculate the physics hello very om it's kind of like almost pi so too many levels too many levels Mozart let's try 10 still too slow 9 yeah we're getting 30 frames per second now with 9 so what was that scale velocity yes so I could dampen the velocity of each particle that's a small idea I'm not the words coming out of my mouth make no sense that's a good idea also I think that radius is getting way too small now I want the radius to be bigger so let's keep that radius bigger as I want them I want more and I want the frame rate to be faster so I'm gonna put it at eight there we go so okay this is good what was the logarithmic scale that someone suggested I'm gonna scroll back up in the chat wasn't that long ago where was it where was it scrolling scrolling ah I use spectral praiano writes I use 16 divided by log level plus 2 for this thickness so a logarithmic scale is an excellent idea here that's going to I think work nicely and if my brain if I wasn't so brain dead explain it where do I do the stroke wait here it is stroke weight equals 16 divided equally divided by log of this dot level plus 2 I don't want that to be 0 and let's see how this goes let's try logarithmic scale what's yeah I like this it's nice and I think I could even kind of go down yeah so that's really nice it's a I like the scale of this all right so we're getting our trees I'm surprised that it doesn't fan out more and I I think it would make sense of +1 here hello what happened to that oh plus two because I have a zero level that makes sense okay color so many things that could happen here maybe increase the strength of the repulsion force says Simon excellent idea because guess what I want it to go a little crazier there we go there you go yes dance tree dance oh I could have it respond to it looks like it's responding to sound that's what the crane bees let me just do one more thing and why one more thing I mean like probably ten more things but let me add some wind into the system so I only get one gravity behavior do I even does this even really matter let's take out the gravity behavior for a second I think what I could do I have an idea so without the gravity behavior it's it's not for standing up as consistently very weird it's also a little I feel like I shouldn't lock the second particle like it's weird that that with this whole thing that really doesn't make sense so let's not lock the second particle anymore can I just out of curiosity if I make a global variable called GB for gravity behavior and I and I say GB is that gravity behavior and I adjust its values like if I say function mousepressed gb x equals zero gb y equals zero when i click the mouse does that disable the gravity oh I forgot that I have that thing where I also can like drag one of them around I can't tell I think it did disable the gravity but it's too hard to tell let's take this out I don't think it disabled the gravity I think the gravity is still there I wanted to like just adjust that behavior over time oh I don't have the chance to looking at the logarithmic scale thing in the chat the spring should go from B to the a of the previous branch I think I'm doing that by definition of the way that I'm creating the springs the N branches definitely get tangled which is kind of interesting look at that um how do I hold on let's be sure about this way hold on console.log chibi Oh force oh there we go scaled force there's a force in a scale force maybe I can yeah X&Y don't do anything what if I were to say I forgot that I'm in JavaScript I just look at the objects maybe I need to affect the scaled force I mean I'm probably not supposed to do this was it called scaled force yeah there we go so I don't think this is the proper way to affect the behavior but it'll work for right now so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say let's always have the gravities scaled force Why Why is never gonna change but I'm gonna make the X and I probably should use open simplex noise and refer to my other videos about on blue simplex noise that's when it flies in later during the when this never gets edited this is very much like the neuro Revolution cars but feeling it's never gonna get edited noise but X offset equals zero X offset plus equals 0.02 noise X offset and we're going to map that value which goes between zero and one to between negative two and two so let's just see what happens here if there's this so the gravity this global force which is really not gravity but it's just a force always pointing up that's also going to go left and right from time to time let's see what happens it's a little bit too strong you can imagine an interaction where like I blow into the microphone and it does that it's kind of crazy I love this I really like this project let's go from like point one to zero point one yeah so there we go here is my tree swaying in the wind with physics let's go back let's just tune this a little bit I think these are way too strong let's make the it half as strong let's let the springs be much looser I think this is going to be nicer there we go there we go that's let's have a couple more little tuning things let's make this even weaker and let's change it less often and let's have the gravity force actually be well let's we can set it here let's set the Y we could also make this could be noisy as well I have an idea we'll just take a different we'll still go from like a different place in the noise space so it's different values and we'll map that which goes between zero and one which is silly I could just we could just take that noise value I don't need map for this because I want it to just go always negative and but have it be kind of weak so if sometimes it'll kind of go it'll go down to zero let's try this whoops scaled force all right I think I have finished this project yes I'm oka gonnna saying how about a Springs each joint which pulls them back to its original location repeat idea relaxing music here it's kind of appropriate there we go there's a white man hold on hold on hold on let's make this we're gonna I'm gonna give we're gonna do some relaxing tree fundraising here how do I do that thing where there I got it I got it I got it just hold on for a second all right everybody take a minute bring everybody from the internet here we are going to enjoy some nice relaxing music and a physics tree you don't like my default music from YouTube's free library that it's like somehow I have over here yeah first of all it doesn't respond to the music so I really think it should oh I have not gone Edward to ask me if I check out this exhibit yet I really have got to I really should can you share the code please so I definitely will share the code I suppose I could right now create a repo really quickly but I don't know that I'm ready like you know this this makes sense for it to be a community project you could create Springs between the particles on the same level to keep the branches separate that is such a good idea so there's so many good ideas being suggested and what I would like to say I mean I I've hit three hours now and I think that's about my limit but I would encourage you to to create your own version of this I will before I leave I'll upload the code somewhere so you could build off of it and remove the bounding box yeah the bounding box is sort of unnecessary here so let's do a few last things how do I let's do a few last things the bounding box is very unnecessary they should let let the tree be free fly tree fly like the wind like the Perlin noise not really wind so easy to listen to the microphone so it got rid of the sound library how do I get out of this full screen let's get the sound library back this is my fancy technique no shoot did I get it it's the worst I'm completely lost my mind I'm like so braindead spent a long week is that the sound library excellent I think I just say I can just make a variable called Mike and then I can say let Mike equals p5 audio in and then can I just get like the level there's more to it than this can't be this simple ooh whoops and it should be new p5 audioin all right that's not how it works Oh Mike dot start close I am definitely listening so let's go look at the examples oh I mean I want to look at examples sound sound Mike threshold input start get level new p5 audio and oh you know what it might be let's try listening on mousepressed oh wait a sec I have a feeling that the audio input is like tied to something else sound input no it's the builtin microphone can in fact work and put new p5 audio in and put get level huh what did I do wrong by missing what am I missing weird make Mike global I did I mean I was not putting the Mike dot start and setup because there's the weird issue well hold on let's try this there's a weird thing with Chrome where it doesn't want to let you listen without user interaction so that's why I was putting it in mousepressed just to kind of get around that and then I could say like if Mike I know but it works here watch me delete all my code and lose it all how confident am i okay hold on but this is in another file now this is just that example weird okay good so something is going on where it's not working let me let me show the warnings I have the warnings filtered out how do I were to filter things custom levels there it is this is what I was worried about audio context was not allowed to start so that's why I was here gonna say so it's not working in for an audio stream huh well that's good it's definitely something to do with oops how do I see the how do I look at the JavaScript console in Firefox I have completely little run out of steam I don't know why I decided to try to do this Oh allow and here we go you usually would ask me to allow it some preferences web developer web console there we go I'm getting some values whoops no no how do I make this bigger well alright so now what I was going to do just get the volume and then have this kind of be tied to that because definitely gonna be exactly what I wanted to do come back Oh interesting something is going weird with the audio stream alright this didn't happen I'm done I have to go home I can't be here anymore close this close this while he was not defined when I have that ass forgot what I had this is never getting edited into some kind of like 30 minute coding challenge but in the off chance that it does I will record a little end and I will just consider this my prompt to you from the livestream thank you for thank you for watching this coding challenge that was a bit of a mess but I ended up making this strange wiggly sea creature hopefully you learned something about the way that a fractal works objectoriented programming works and physics libraries work I guess I would open it up to you or what are some ways that you could actually make this feel much more treelike in terms of giving it a much more stable structure or perhaps go in the opposite direction and make it even more frenetic or feel more creature or seaweed or underwater like maybe it could respond to some kind of interaction like sound you could do so much more with color you you could change the way you're drawing the tree or the design of the branches so many possibilities if you make your own wiggly wobbly fractal tree with physics please share it with me at the coding Drang calm on the page associated with this coding challenge and I will see you in future videos and I would love ya share it with me and I will see you next time on the coda train I had point five not point two okay try recording an intro okay Simon good point what you're about to watch okay hello and welcome to a coding challenge what you're about to watch is an edited down version of what I spent well over two hours programming which is this this is for the YouTube fundraiser team trees go to team trees or to donate or use the donate button that's associated with this video I really set out to try to make a tree swaying in the wind and I ended up with this crazy like flying around that's completely gone now sea creature more like or I don't know what it is here comes back hi tree just spinning around in circles and so I'm going to show you just about all the pieces of the code that I wrote to do this with a lot of the debugging and extra tangents cut out of course you could always back go back and watch the full livestream but please maybe you could make a version of this that's a little less insane or that's more insane and share it with me at the coding trade calm plant a tree every dollar goes to planting a tree i've do brain dead to make this opener let me just let me just look here at team trees okay any donations that you make through this from this video any donations that you make either a team tree org or the YouTube donate button or Arbor days team trees I'm not gonna forget on Facebook any donations you make either going by going directly to team trees org or with the donate button that you see with this video are sent directly to the Arbor Day Foundation to fund tree planting $1 plants one tree you could read more about the team trees fundraiser by by checking out the links in this video's description so enjoy this insanity of me attempting to make a tree and ending up with this my friend my weekly Wiggly friend and I will see you at the end where I come back and try to summarize this very poorly probably goodbye alright everyone I'm gonna try to I you know this little the fundraisers were probably going on for a while but and I'm I'm done I'm done for today choo choo I pressed the choochoo button I play my little outro music and see if there are just a few questions that I could answer before I go I just want to check my messages for a second so I'm very much hope I have a bunch of videos that I've recorded that are in the hopper so to speak that I haven't released yet so those I will be so stay tuned there's obviously edited stuff that's come from previous live streams but there are some new there's a new content coming out in particular set of videos or come out on November 6 that you won't have seen the live stream we ship out let's all say it's good to powder for sale a bloop boo boo boo paella false a lot more fluff I'll say a Tele blur but I'll put the phone say can I do it dance background is overpowering my friend she turned it down sorry that it's so loud couldn't you have used apply force just like with the snow with a random single direction wind yes I could have I don't know why I got stuck on like just give everything the same force what's your all right thanks everybody I see some interesting comments Lonnie writes I've been blocked hmm I don't block like on is it can you block people on YouTube I'm not sure exactly what happened there but I will I can check into that cringe yes I agree portably what's your favorite thing besides teaching yeah no I've seen common so I don't think you're blocked my favorite thing besides teaching hanging out I only have cheese the answers to that like I know I'm not French this song it's much longer than I remember I would have just passed a few sine waves for the tree points these are all really good ideas none of which did I try yes go to sleep Jory go to sleep I'm leaving to go to sleep in just a minute here I'll play you out with a diss song how fast you need to drive psycho fly to catch the game what time is the game start what time is it now oh I can get home I actually can get home within 20 minutes from here so yeah I'll be able to catch that World Series game ok thank you all I don't know sometimes I and these streams that think that all my time and energy is going into the right place sometimes I think what's become of me but I I hope oh let me upload this code so I don't I don't have a point of view right now as I mean and I will violate to is helping me manage a lot of the github repos we can put our heads together and think about this and there's many other members and patrons who do a lot of this work as well but let me just at least put the code somewhere that you could see by making a new repo because I do like the idea of having a community team trees project you know one idea that I had which I did that look those like cloud designs a bunch of years ago for processing Community Day and everybody could make a cloud design and then we could make a forest of 20 million coding train trees oh there's some interesting ideas here but let me just do this right now a code from team trees livestream so at a minimum I'm just gonna make a readme that the code from today will be here on YouTube github and this can be like so much more needs to be here to make it a thoughtful useable thing but adding code from today but at least for those of you who want to try to start to work with what I did you can grab it from here right now at github slash coding trained team trees get tube alright bye everybody I'm gonna switch you over to the team trees logo you can still hear me I'm gonna play you out with the Perlin noise song actual random itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between 0 and 10 9 7 6 but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this 2 3 4 3 4 5 6 Perley noise that is totally noise this is Hurley noise that is Hurley noises this is Hurley noise that entirly know so this is Hurley noise that is her pearling know her Perlin noise that is Hurley more this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise that in Perley no so this is Hurley noise that is hurlyburly noise pick numbers like this this is like Perlin noise performance goodbye everybody choochoo
