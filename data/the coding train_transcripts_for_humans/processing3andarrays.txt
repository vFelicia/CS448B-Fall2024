00:00 - every video begins with hello I think I
00:03 - am streaming so I had the window open
00:05 - here
00:08 - because to get some cool air in here but
00:10 - now there's an ambulance hopefully not
00:12 - coming for me although uh sometimes I
00:15 - just wish that an ambulance would come
00:16 - and take me away calgan or calgan would
00:20 - come and take me away I don't know what
00:21 - I'm talking about I'm just over here
00:22 - looking at myself so I'm here doing a
00:24 - live stream um I have this habit that if
00:28 - somebody asks me to make a video about
00:30 - something I'm like really okay I'll go
00:32 - make it so uh um I'm going to make a
00:36 - video today about arrays and I'm going
00:38 - to use processing three which I'm so
00:41 - thrilled to use because I'm making all
00:44 - these uh JavaScript videos and
00:46 - processing 3 just came out and
00:47 - processing 3 has all these like nice
00:48 - features it's so Comfort comforting and
00:50 - such a happy place for me to just be
00:52 - using processing uh so I'm glad to be
00:55 - doing that um I don't have a second
00:56 - laptop here right now but in a minute
00:58 - I'm gonna pop open the um the YouTube uh
01:03 - stream page and look at the chat you'll
01:04 - actually seeing it behind me uh and so
01:07 - first let me know if you can see okay
01:09 - can you read this font oops uh can you
01:12 - read that font can you hear the audio
01:15 - fine and uh over here I'm also going to
01:18 - uh use this whiteboard uh and I feel
01:22 - like I have a smaller area now I guess
01:24 - it's what it always is uh and so uh
01:27 - hopefully you can see that okay which I
01:28 - think you can hi okay so I'm going to
01:32 - check the chat now I'm going to pull up
01:35 - up this YouTube page and see that there
01:38 - are a couple people who said hello
01:41 - doesn't seem like there's anybody here
01:42 - now but the stream Health oh um sorry I
01:45 - forgot to press the button here I am uh
01:48 - and there I am by the way this shirt has
01:50 - green in it so I'm like a little bit
01:52 - see-through today can you see like if I
01:55 - walk over I don't know I don't know what
01:56 - I'm doing anymore okay so uh loud and
01:58 - clear and looking good thank you po
02:02 - town uh all right so you can also you're
02:04 - welcome to ask questions and I will uh
02:06 - answer those questions but I'm going to
02:08 - go ahead and uh start this uh video
02:11 - recording so this is like the live
02:12 - stream which is like the raw footage
02:14 - which gets automatically uploaded to
02:16 - YouTube and what I do is I hit a button
02:17 - at a certain point and record I say
02:20 - every video starts with I think I'm
02:21 - streaming and then starts with this
02:23 - elaborate
02:24 - explanation uh okay so I'm minimizing
02:27 - the chat now so I'm not going to see for
02:30 - about uh 10 minutes um but after I do
02:33 - this quick lesson about arrays uh I'll
02:36 - come back and check the chat I have like
02:37 - a half an hour or so so this only be
02:39 - about 10 or 15 minutes I'm anticipating
02:41 - and then I'll be able to take any
02:43 - questions about anything uh not just
02:46 - arrays so I'm going to leave this open
02:49 - and I'm going to uh put the camera over
02:52 - here uh and I'm going to come over here
02:54 - in a second and start talking about
02:57 - arrays boy Java processing that's right
03:00 - right okay oh you know what I need to do
03:04 - I need to tie my shoe it's untied I will
03:07 - trip I will
03:10 - fall this is me live streaming tying my
03:14 - shoe
03:16 - okay here's my pen oh the smiley face
03:20 - I'll leave it there okay here we go and
03:24 - three two
03:27 - one hello this is a video whoops
03:31 - I will not hurtt myself too much
03:33 - throughout the course of this video let
03:34 - me let I'm not just going to start again
03:37 - hello this is a video about arrays in
03:41 - Java SL processing in fact and I'm going
03:44 - to use processing 3 which is a my new
03:48 - song my new album processing 3 coming
03:50 - out I don't know many years from now and
03:52 - I'm not making videos about programming
03:54 - but making albums about singing about
03:55 - programming okay so uh what is an array
03:59 - why do you want use one how does it work
04:01 - and what kinds of things can you do with
04:02 - it um that's the topic of this video so
04:05 - perhaps you're familiar with this idea
04:07 - of a
04:08 - variable int num equals 7 so you have a
04:15 - variable the name is num the type is int
04:18 - integer and the value is seven but what
04:21 - if you want to have a whole bunch of
04:23 - numbers you want to have number one and
04:25 - number two and number three and number
04:26 - four you'd have to make all these
04:28 - variables well array is essentially a
04:31 - way in a single variable of having a
04:33 - list of values and those things can be
04:35 - numbers or pieces of text it could be an
04:38 - array of images there a list of anything
04:41 - that's a piece of data in a program you
04:43 - can have a list of that thing and it you
04:45 - know aside there's an aside here I'm not
04:47 - going to talk about objects in this
04:48 - video but arrays and objects is a
04:50 - particularly powerful thing link below
04:52 - that I will make sure to add to videos
04:54 - about arrays and objects okay so how do
04:56 - you make this
04:58 - list well with a variable you always
05:01 - need a name and a type so with an array
05:03 - an array is a variable but it's a list
05:05 - of you know uh I I think of a variable
05:08 - as a single value and array as like a
05:10 - list of
05:11 - values anyway so with the array which
05:15 - I'll call
05:16 - nums you also need to give it a name
05:19 - nums and a type integer but you add this
05:22 - extra bit of syntax square bracket
05:25 - square bracket square bracket so look on
05:27 - your keyboard now find the square
05:29 - bracket if you haven't used them before
05:31 - you're going to need them a lot with
05:32 - arrays so now I have an array of numbers
05:35 - and I can initialize it instead of as a
05:38 - single value I can use curly bracket 7
05:43 - comma 5 comma -32 comma 90 so now you
05:47 - can see I have an array of 1 two three
05:51 - four values so I'm going to go start a
05:53 - sketch and add this oops come over here
05:56 - and start a sketch and add this so I'm
05:58 - going to say at the top
06:00 - int uh nums equals uh and I'm going to
06:04 - make them like 30 for uh 40 10 uh five
06:09 - arbitrary numbers and you can see here
06:11 - there we go that's the Syntax for an
06:13 - array now there are other ways you can
06:15 - initialize an array you can use a loop
06:17 - I'm going to get to that in a little bit
06:19 - this is just one way to start off this
06:21 - list of values so now the comes the
06:26 - question over here if I wanted to use
06:29 - the Val let's say I wanted to use that
06:31 - value
06:33 - num so to draw an ellipse at 100 comma
06:37 - 50 and with a size
06:41 - num so I wanted to use this particular
06:45 - value to be the size of a circle I just
06:48 - take that variable and I put it in the
06:49 - width and height arguments of the
06:51 - ellipse function so how what if I want
06:53 - to use this one or this one or this one
06:55 - some value from this list from this
06:58 - array
07:00 - ellipse 100 comma 50 H
07:05 - nums what huh I mean I know the answer
07:08 - to this I don't know why I'm pretending
07:10 - like I have to figure this out the issue
07:12 - is this is a single value so you can put
07:14 - it right here it needs to be a single
07:15 - value here I need to address one of
07:17 - these particular values and the way that
07:19 - I do that is with an index an index is
07:22 - an address into the array it's like
07:24 - counting the array you can say like
07:25 - here's number one number two number
07:27 - three number four ah except I've got a
07:29 - problem here I mean actually I have a I
07:32 - am this makes me very happy but it's a
07:35 - weird thing how you count with arrays in
07:38 - programming you could think of this as
07:40 - having four elements this the first
07:42 - element the second element what I've
07:44 - told you is accurate however counting
07:47 - with arrays this is technically index
07:50 - zero so when you're counting the
07:52 - elements of the array you start with
07:53 - zero not with one so this is element
07:56 - zero this is element one this is element
07:59 - two and this is element three the index
08:03 - values go from 0 to three with a total
08:06 - of four elements so to individually
08:09 - address one of these nums index 3 once
08:13 - again the square brackets square
08:16 - brackets are just the syntax of arrays
08:18 - I'm going to have an array and now I'm
08:20 - addressing not the third element right
08:22 - index number three which is technically
08:24 - the fourth element and
08:27 - now if you look look at this this line
08:31 - of code will draw a circle of size seven
08:34 - and this line of code will draw a circle
08:36 - of size 90 if I change this to one I'll
08:39 - get five if I change it to zero I'll get
08:41 - seven so that's piece number one let's
08:44 - go and add that here into this
08:46 - program uh and so now I'm going to say
08:49 - void setup I'm going to say size uh
08:53 - 4400 and I'm going to in
08:57 - draw I'm going to say backround ground
09:00 - Zer and Phill to 55 and then I'm going
09:03 - to say
09:04 - ellipse at you know uh 100 comma 200
09:09 - nums index one
09:12 - nums index
09:15 - one so let me Zoom back out here and run
09:19 - this code and look at the result and you
09:22 - can see here T I'm doing like singing
09:25 - today I don't know why uh that's not
09:28 - really singing saying J but whatever um
09:31 - the uh the the size of that circle is
09:35 - what 30 40 0 is 30 1 is 40 the size is
09:40 - 40 let's see it get a little bit quite
09:42 - if I change this to nums index
09:46 - two now look at that I've got a tiny one
09:50 - now there's a few things I could add to
09:53 - this and I'm not sure which direction to
09:55 - go in but I'm going to go in a certain
09:57 - direction this is the direction I'm
09:58 - going in right now
10:00 - now let's let's draw a circle with all
10:04 - of those so there are four elements uh 0
10:08 - 1 2
10:10 - 3 0 1 two 3 H now let's draw them a
10:15 - little bit spaced out at 100 200 300 400
10:21 - and I'll make the size uh 500 now look
10:24 - at this and let's make these numbers a
10:26 - little bit bigger uh 50 uh
10:31 - 92 so you can see what's going on here
10:34 - if we Zoom the screen in a little bit
10:36 - just to look at all of this I've got
10:38 - four circles at different X values 100
10:40 - 200 300 400 each circle is pulling its
10:43 - width and height from that array index
10:46 - zero index one index two index three so
10:49 - this is working pretty this is a nice
10:50 - idea and I talking about this for seven
10:53 - minutes but this and this works well
10:56 - like this is sort of like helping us
10:57 - instead of having four separate
10:59 - variables I have a single variable with
11:01 - a list of four items but I still have to
11:02 - have four lines of code down here which
11:04 - is kind of ridiculous right I mean it's
11:07 - not ridiculous but it's it's it's the
11:09 - problem comes up what if I have a 100
11:11 - values in that array what if I have 200
11:13 - values in that array I don't want to
11:14 - have 200 lines of code however you'll
11:17 - notice there's a kind of logic here
11:19 - start with zero go to one go to two go
11:21 - to three this is kind of counting do you
11:24 - remember I don't know where you've come
11:26 - from or why you're watching and if
11:28 - there's enough l in here if you but
11:30 - anyway uh do you remember there was a
11:33 - time where you hopefully probably
11:35 - learned about a for Loop and if you
11:36 - didn't I will link you to a video about
11:39 - a for Loop below where you wrote
11:42 - something like this or I I've done this
11:43 - many times four in I equal z i is less
11:48 - than 4 I
11:50 - ++ now if this is like a terrible pen if
11:54 - I were to put oh much better print line
11:58 - I right in here this Loop would run and
12:01 - first it would print out the value of
12:04 - zero then zero go up by one it would
12:05 - print out the value one then Z would go
12:07 - up by two and this and then it would
12:09 - print out the value two and then up by
12:11 - one it would print out the value three
12:12 - we get we' get 0 1 2 3 then I would be
12:16 - four four is not less than four the loop
12:18 - would exit so notice how a four Loop is
12:20 - a structure that can be used to count a
12:22 - variable from zero up to some limit like
12:25 - four well this is exactly the structure
12:28 - that we need over here so if I come back
12:31 - to this code and I say 4 in I equal 0 I
12:36 - is less than 4
12:40 - i++ and then I grab this I take this
12:44 - line of code and put it
12:45 - here well now couldn't I replace that
12:50 - index zero with
12:54 - I so this Loop and let me give myself a
12:58 - little more space here
12:59 - this Loop you can comment this out this
13:03 - Loop is now doing the job of what this
13:06 - code did before instead of manually
13:09 - having to type 0 one2 3 this Loop uses I
13:12 - to do nums I nums zero num nums one nums
13:15 - two nums three now let's run this and
13:17 - see what
13:19 - happens okay so that worked but it looks
13:23 - wrong why does it look wrong ah all the
13:26 - circles are at Value 100 and and I
13:29 - wanted the circles to be at 100 200 300
13:31 - 400
13:33 - well over here remember the loop is
13:36 - counting i 0 1 2 3 what happens if I
13:39 - multiply each of those numbers by
13:41 - 100 times 100 time 100 time 100 I get
13:46 - zero I get 100 I get 200 I get 300 oh
13:50 - but I wanted 100 200 300 400 I know why
13:53 - don't I just add 100 to each of
13:56 - these so you can see another thing we
13:58 - can do I might be the index into the
14:01 - array 0 1 2 3 but we can also apply some
14:04 - math to I to do other interesting things
14:06 - like here instead of now saying 100 what
14:10 - if I were to say I * 100 that gives me
14:14 - 01 100 there you are 0o 100 200 300 and
14:18 - then what if I add 100 to that then I
14:20 - have 100 200 300 400 so let's now run
14:24 - this and we have exactly what we had
14:27 - before with albeit
14:29 - only these values now one thing I should
14:32 - mention two things I should mention
14:33 - three 50 things I should mention but you
14:36 - know this has been going on for 11
14:38 - minutes uh it's going to be a little bit
14:39 - of a longer video because I think I'm
14:40 - going to try to cover you know just sort
14:42 - of all the array stuff just in this
14:43 - video but there's a couple things I
14:45 - should mention one is I don't love that
14:46 - I have the number four there it's sort
14:47 - of hard-coded value what if I were to
14:50 - add more values to the array I still
14:51 - would only Loop through four of them so
14:53 - one thing you can do with an array is
14:56 - nums do length uh let me just turn off
15:00 - the code completion um so nums do length
15:04 - dynamically resolves to the length of
15:06 - the array so if I were to add another
15:08 - one you know uh SE uh
15:14 - 75 you can see I've added an extra Val
15:17 - an extra number which got me an extra
15:19 - Circle and now it's looping through the
15:21 - entire aray it's always using the length
15:23 - and you know I could space them out a
15:25 - little bit less like let's space them
15:27 - out just by 50
15:30 - so we can see ah now they're kind of
15:31 - crowded together aha but what what was
15:34 - the other thing I want to show here well
15:35 - this is one way to initialize an array I
15:38 - just give it some hard-coded numbers in
15:39 - between those curly brackets however
15:42 - what I might actually like to do more
15:44 - often and I'm trying to think of where
15:46 - to do this
15:47 - is give the array initial values that
15:51 - maybe are random so let's say there were
15:53 - uh uh eight
15:56 - values and I want to say nums index I
16:00 - equals int random somewhere between 10
16:02 - and 100 so this is this is
16:06 - code that is filling the array with a
16:09 - random number Loop starting from zero
16:12 - all the way up to eight pick a random
16:13 - number between 0 and 100 and add put
16:15 - that in the array but a funny thing
16:17 - about arrays is that you uh you have to
16:22 - specify in advance the size you want
16:26 - that array to be now there are ways
16:28 - around this and ways of expanding
16:29 - Contracting an array and I have other
16:31 - videos that cover that but for the
16:32 - purpose of this discussion right now the
16:34 - array is a has a fixed length so we saw
16:38 - that one way to get that fixed length is
16:40 - to just manually type in the values but
16:43 - what if you don't know the values in
16:44 - advance you just want to know how many
16:46 - things should be in there well the
16:48 - Syntax for doing that is a little bit
16:49 - goofy
16:50 - looking but in if you're not filling it
16:53 - manually between the curly brackets what
16:55 - you need to say is you want a new
16:59 - integer array with like a hundred spots
17:03 - in it so this is your number to make up
17:05 - so this seems very redundant I'm having
17:08 - an integer array called nums which is a
17:10 - new integer array with 100 spots in it
17:12 - but two things are going on here this is
17:14 - declaring your intention to have an
17:16 - array and this is actually creating the
17:18 - array allocating the space in the
17:20 - computer's memory to store 100 values so
17:23 - if I come back over
17:24 - here uh I can change I I can change this
17:29 - top code here to say new
17:32 - int8 I want eight spots nums do length
17:36 - and let's just clean up how we're
17:37 - drawing this I'm going to say uh no fill
17:41 - and stroke 255 so we can kind of see and
17:44 - let's make them a little thicker I don't
17:45 - know this is very silly but stroke
17:47 - weight four uh so the point of what I
17:49 - wanted to show you is that
17:53 - now you can see here every time I run
17:57 - this sketch I'm going to get a new
17:59 - result every time I'm going to
18:02 - create an array with eight spots every
18:05 - time I'm going to fill that array with
18:06 - eight random numbers and then uh I'm
18:09 - going to always Loop through that array
18:11 - and draw a circle using each element
18:13 - from the array so here we go run it
18:16 - again just to see oh look at those
18:19 - differently sized circles run it again
18:21 - look at those differently sized circles
18:22 - so for you um you know I might think of
18:26 - a couple exercises here to try number
18:29 - one is what if your array instead of
18:33 - having numbers in it maybe maybe you
18:36 - know about strings maybe you don't but
18:39 - what if you made an array with strings
18:43 - in
18:44 - it hello my friend right this is an
18:48 - array with three strings three sequences
18:50 - of characters so could you display every
18:54 - time you run the sketch a random one of
18:56 - those strings in the center of the
18:58 - canvas window or could you do something
19:00 - as you click the mouse you see one
19:02 - message one at a time how would you do
19:04 - that so those are two interesting
19:05 - exercises to try this particular
19:07 - scenario that I've made here I'm looping
19:10 - through the entire array each time but
19:12 - what if you just want to use one number
19:14 - one at a time or one string one at a
19:16 - time that's another that's one thing you
19:17 - can look at the other thing that I think
19:19 - is crucial to mention is that one reason
19:21 - to learn this is that the all the stuff
19:25 - in the window that you're seeing here is
19:29 - an array of pixels an array of colors so
19:32 - underneath the
19:34 - hood uh of a processing sketch of of an
19:37 - image that you might load or an image
19:39 - you might get from a camera all the
19:41 - colors of that image are stored in one
19:43 - giant array and you can Loop through
19:45 - that entire array to read all those
19:47 - colors and manipulate those colors so
19:48 - I'll also include a link below to online
19:50 - tutorial um and some other videos about
19:53 - images and pixels that you can look at
19:54 - that this will give you kind of the
19:55 - foundation for okay so hopefully um this
19:59 - video was helpful and you saw a little
20:00 - bit of processing three and some nice
20:02 - circles and a strangely colored shirt
20:04 - that does it really blend in with the
20:06 - background yes see look you can see the
20:08 - background nobody cares about that but
20:10 - it's interesting to me and I'm going to
20:11 - say goodbye now before that camera shuts
20:13 - off
20:17 - goodbye uh okay the live stream might
20:19 - still be going I don't know if anybody's
20:21 - watching or has any questions I'm going
20:23 - to pull that up am I still here I
20:26 - am uh 10:52
20:29 - uh if you have um any
20:31 - questions uh uh 10 people are watching
20:33 - that's interesting if you have any
20:35 - questions let me know right now uh I've
20:37 - got about 10 more minutes before I've
20:39 - off to um uh class with human beings as
20:44 - opposed to this thing that I do with
20:46 - lights and cameras and sunlight outside
20:49 - there's a window there so I can see that
20:51 - the world is there not just this Cave of
20:54 - talking about code and processing um any
20:57 - questions I will how far behind how how
21:00 - far lag is the stream I'm going to do
21:03 - this so I'll see how long that takes to
21:05 - get to me hitting my head
21:08 - one
21:09 - two it would be nice if I could get the
21:12 - lag I wonder actually here under stream
21:14 - options if I had colle oh uh yeah low
21:16 - latency I have that
21:18 - selected um maybe I should play an ad
21:20 - while I'm waiting that's what I'll
21:22 - do play ad watch this everybody oh you
21:24 - can't see
21:26 - that okay I'm going to click this play
21:28 - ad button and I will probably make three
21:30 - cents but I'm curious about it okay and
21:34 - uh while you're while while the ad is
21:36 - playing you can ask
21:43 - questions keep on oh it's telling me
21:46 - based on some complex criteria some of
21:48 - your viewers will see an ad are you one
21:50 - of those viewers uh keep on streaming
21:53 - I'm waiting to see if anybody has any
21:54 - questions otherwise I'm going to just
21:56 - head out of here
22:00 - uh let me make sure that recorded I'll
22:01 - come over here I'm just checking while
22:03 - I'm
22:04 - waiting uh yeah looks like it
22:07 - did and there's a video
22:10 - there you can
22:13 - see
22:15 - uh
22:16 - great uh okay
22:19 - uh thank you that's nice uh night thank
22:22 - you nice feedback so I'm going to do a
22:25 - much um I'm going to do let me just
22:27 - close this I'm going I'm going to do a
22:29 - much longer stream I can't see myself
22:31 - anymore over here I'm going to do a much
22:33 - longer stream on Thursday and possibly
22:34 - Friday I've got a long list of videos
22:36 - I'm getting to about Dom manipulation
22:38 - and
22:38 - JavaScript and data and apis uh I also
22:43 - really would like to do a whole bunch
22:44 - more videos that use processing
22:47 - especially I I did make a video about
22:48 - the new features of processing 3 but um
22:50 - there's some topics that I've never
22:52 - gotten a chance to look at in a video so
22:54 - hopefully I'll get to that as well I'm
22:55 - going to do one last check to the chat
22:57 - to see if anybody has any questions then
22:59 - I'm going to turn off the
23:02 - stream uh great okay I don't see any
23:05 - questions here uh thanks for watching
23:08 - all all of you and uh this will happen
23:12 - again soon talk to you
23:14 - later you can ask just questions in the
23:17 - comments so

Cleaned transcript:

every video begins with hello I think I am streaming so I had the window open here because to get some cool air in here but now there's an ambulance hopefully not coming for me although uh sometimes I just wish that an ambulance would come and take me away calgan or calgan would come and take me away I don't know what I'm talking about I'm just over here looking at myself so I'm here doing a live stream um I have this habit that if somebody asks me to make a video about something I'm like really okay I'll go make it so uh um I'm going to make a video today about arrays and I'm going to use processing three which I'm so thrilled to use because I'm making all these uh JavaScript videos and processing 3 just came out and processing 3 has all these like nice features it's so Comfort comforting and such a happy place for me to just be using processing uh so I'm glad to be doing that um I don't have a second laptop here right now but in a minute I'm gonna pop open the um the YouTube uh stream page and look at the chat you'll actually seeing it behind me uh and so first let me know if you can see okay can you read this font oops uh can you read that font can you hear the audio fine and uh over here I'm also going to uh use this whiteboard uh and I feel like I have a smaller area now I guess it's what it always is uh and so uh hopefully you can see that okay which I think you can hi okay so I'm going to check the chat now I'm going to pull up up this YouTube page and see that there are a couple people who said hello doesn't seem like there's anybody here now but the stream Health oh um sorry I forgot to press the button here I am uh and there I am by the way this shirt has green in it so I'm like a little bit seethrough today can you see like if I walk over I don't know I don't know what I'm doing anymore okay so uh loud and clear and looking good thank you po town uh all right so you can also you're welcome to ask questions and I will uh answer those questions but I'm going to go ahead and uh start this uh video recording so this is like the live stream which is like the raw footage which gets automatically uploaded to YouTube and what I do is I hit a button at a certain point and record I say every video starts with I think I'm streaming and then starts with this elaborate explanation uh okay so I'm minimizing the chat now so I'm not going to see for about uh 10 minutes um but after I do this quick lesson about arrays uh I'll come back and check the chat I have like a half an hour or so so this only be about 10 or 15 minutes I'm anticipating and then I'll be able to take any questions about anything uh not just arrays so I'm going to leave this open and I'm going to uh put the camera over here uh and I'm going to come over here in a second and start talking about arrays boy Java processing that's right right okay oh you know what I need to do I need to tie my shoe it's untied I will trip I will fall this is me live streaming tying my shoe okay here's my pen oh the smiley face I'll leave it there okay here we go and three two one hello this is a video whoops I will not hurtt myself too much throughout the course of this video let me let I'm not just going to start again hello this is a video about arrays in Java SL processing in fact and I'm going to use processing 3 which is a my new song my new album processing 3 coming out I don't know many years from now and I'm not making videos about programming but making albums about singing about programming okay so uh what is an array why do you want use one how does it work and what kinds of things can you do with it um that's the topic of this video so perhaps you're familiar with this idea of a variable int num equals 7 so you have a variable the name is num the type is int integer and the value is seven but what if you want to have a whole bunch of numbers you want to have number one and number two and number three and number four you'd have to make all these variables well array is essentially a way in a single variable of having a list of values and those things can be numbers or pieces of text it could be an array of images there a list of anything that's a piece of data in a program you can have a list of that thing and it you know aside there's an aside here I'm not going to talk about objects in this video but arrays and objects is a particularly powerful thing link below that I will make sure to add to videos about arrays and objects okay so how do you make this list well with a variable you always need a name and a type so with an array an array is a variable but it's a list of you know uh I I think of a variable as a single value and array as like a list of values anyway so with the array which I'll call nums you also need to give it a name nums and a type integer but you add this extra bit of syntax square bracket square bracket square bracket so look on your keyboard now find the square bracket if you haven't used them before you're going to need them a lot with arrays so now I have an array of numbers and I can initialize it instead of as a single value I can use curly bracket 7 comma 5 comma 32 comma 90 so now you can see I have an array of 1 two three four values so I'm going to go start a sketch and add this oops come over here and start a sketch and add this so I'm going to say at the top int uh nums equals uh and I'm going to make them like 30 for uh 40 10 uh five arbitrary numbers and you can see here there we go that's the Syntax for an array now there are other ways you can initialize an array you can use a loop I'm going to get to that in a little bit this is just one way to start off this list of values so now the comes the question over here if I wanted to use the Val let's say I wanted to use that value num so to draw an ellipse at 100 comma 50 and with a size num so I wanted to use this particular value to be the size of a circle I just take that variable and I put it in the width and height arguments of the ellipse function so how what if I want to use this one or this one or this one some value from this list from this array ellipse 100 comma 50 H nums what huh I mean I know the answer to this I don't know why I'm pretending like I have to figure this out the issue is this is a single value so you can put it right here it needs to be a single value here I need to address one of these particular values and the way that I do that is with an index an index is an address into the array it's like counting the array you can say like here's number one number two number three number four ah except I've got a problem here I mean actually I have a I am this makes me very happy but it's a weird thing how you count with arrays in programming you could think of this as having four elements this the first element the second element what I've told you is accurate however counting with arrays this is technically index zero so when you're counting the elements of the array you start with zero not with one so this is element zero this is element one this is element two and this is element three the index values go from 0 to three with a total of four elements so to individually address one of these nums index 3 once again the square brackets square brackets are just the syntax of arrays I'm going to have an array and now I'm addressing not the third element right index number three which is technically the fourth element and now if you look look at this this line of code will draw a circle of size seven and this line of code will draw a circle of size 90 if I change this to one I'll get five if I change it to zero I'll get seven so that's piece number one let's go and add that here into this program uh and so now I'm going to say void setup I'm going to say size uh 4400 and I'm going to in draw I'm going to say backround ground Zer and Phill to 55 and then I'm going to say ellipse at you know uh 100 comma 200 nums index one nums index one so let me Zoom back out here and run this code and look at the result and you can see here T I'm doing like singing today I don't know why uh that's not really singing saying J but whatever um the uh the the size of that circle is what 30 40 0 is 30 1 is 40 the size is 40 let's see it get a little bit quite if I change this to nums index two now look at that I've got a tiny one now there's a few things I could add to this and I'm not sure which direction to go in but I'm going to go in a certain direction this is the direction I'm going in right now now let's let's draw a circle with all of those so there are four elements uh 0 1 2 3 0 1 two 3 H now let's draw them a little bit spaced out at 100 200 300 400 and I'll make the size uh 500 now look at this and let's make these numbers a little bit bigger uh 50 uh 92 so you can see what's going on here if we Zoom the screen in a little bit just to look at all of this I've got four circles at different X values 100 200 300 400 each circle is pulling its width and height from that array index zero index one index two index three so this is working pretty this is a nice idea and I talking about this for seven minutes but this and this works well like this is sort of like helping us instead of having four separate variables I have a single variable with a list of four items but I still have to have four lines of code down here which is kind of ridiculous right I mean it's not ridiculous but it's it's it's the problem comes up what if I have a 100 values in that array what if I have 200 values in that array I don't want to have 200 lines of code however you'll notice there's a kind of logic here start with zero go to one go to two go to three this is kind of counting do you remember I don't know where you've come from or why you're watching and if there's enough l in here if you but anyway uh do you remember there was a time where you hopefully probably learned about a for Loop and if you didn't I will link you to a video about a for Loop below where you wrote something like this or I I've done this many times four in I equal z i is less than 4 I ++ now if this is like a terrible pen if I were to put oh much better print line I right in here this Loop would run and first it would print out the value of zero then zero go up by one it would print out the value one then Z would go up by two and this and then it would print out the value two and then up by one it would print out the value three we get we' get 0 1 2 3 then I would be four four is not less than four the loop would exit so notice how a four Loop is a structure that can be used to count a variable from zero up to some limit like four well this is exactly the structure that we need over here so if I come back to this code and I say 4 in I equal 0 I is less than 4 i++ and then I grab this I take this line of code and put it here well now couldn't I replace that index zero with I so this Loop and let me give myself a little more space here this Loop you can comment this out this Loop is now doing the job of what this code did before instead of manually having to type 0 one2 3 this Loop uses I to do nums I nums zero num nums one nums two nums three now let's run this and see what happens okay so that worked but it looks wrong why does it look wrong ah all the circles are at Value 100 and and I wanted the circles to be at 100 200 300 400 well over here remember the loop is counting i 0 1 2 3 what happens if I multiply each of those numbers by 100 times 100 time 100 time 100 I get zero I get 100 I get 200 I get 300 oh but I wanted 100 200 300 400 I know why don't I just add 100 to each of these so you can see another thing we can do I might be the index into the array 0 1 2 3 but we can also apply some math to I to do other interesting things like here instead of now saying 100 what if I were to say I * 100 that gives me 01 100 there you are 0o 100 200 300 and then what if I add 100 to that then I have 100 200 300 400 so let's now run this and we have exactly what we had before with albeit only these values now one thing I should mention two things I should mention three 50 things I should mention but you know this has been going on for 11 minutes uh it's going to be a little bit of a longer video because I think I'm going to try to cover you know just sort of all the array stuff just in this video but there's a couple things I should mention one is I don't love that I have the number four there it's sort of hardcoded value what if I were to add more values to the array I still would only Loop through four of them so one thing you can do with an array is nums do length uh let me just turn off the code completion um so nums do length dynamically resolves to the length of the array so if I were to add another one you know uh SE uh 75 you can see I've added an extra Val an extra number which got me an extra Circle and now it's looping through the entire aray it's always using the length and you know I could space them out a little bit less like let's space them out just by 50 so we can see ah now they're kind of crowded together aha but what what was the other thing I want to show here well this is one way to initialize an array I just give it some hardcoded numbers in between those curly brackets however what I might actually like to do more often and I'm trying to think of where to do this is give the array initial values that maybe are random so let's say there were uh uh eight values and I want to say nums index I equals int random somewhere between 10 and 100 so this is this is code that is filling the array with a random number Loop starting from zero all the way up to eight pick a random number between 0 and 100 and add put that in the array but a funny thing about arrays is that you uh you have to specify in advance the size you want that array to be now there are ways around this and ways of expanding Contracting an array and I have other videos that cover that but for the purpose of this discussion right now the array is a has a fixed length so we saw that one way to get that fixed length is to just manually type in the values but what if you don't know the values in advance you just want to know how many things should be in there well the Syntax for doing that is a little bit goofy looking but in if you're not filling it manually between the curly brackets what you need to say is you want a new integer array with like a hundred spots in it so this is your number to make up so this seems very redundant I'm having an integer array called nums which is a new integer array with 100 spots in it but two things are going on here this is declaring your intention to have an array and this is actually creating the array allocating the space in the computer's memory to store 100 values so if I come back over here uh I can change I I can change this top code here to say new int8 I want eight spots nums do length and let's just clean up how we're drawing this I'm going to say uh no fill and stroke 255 so we can kind of see and let's make them a little thicker I don't know this is very silly but stroke weight four uh so the point of what I wanted to show you is that now you can see here every time I run this sketch I'm going to get a new result every time I'm going to create an array with eight spots every time I'm going to fill that array with eight random numbers and then uh I'm going to always Loop through that array and draw a circle using each element from the array so here we go run it again just to see oh look at those differently sized circles run it again look at those differently sized circles so for you um you know I might think of a couple exercises here to try number one is what if your array instead of having numbers in it maybe maybe you know about strings maybe you don't but what if you made an array with strings in it hello my friend right this is an array with three strings three sequences of characters so could you display every time you run the sketch a random one of those strings in the center of the canvas window or could you do something as you click the mouse you see one message one at a time how would you do that so those are two interesting exercises to try this particular scenario that I've made here I'm looping through the entire array each time but what if you just want to use one number one at a time or one string one at a time that's another that's one thing you can look at the other thing that I think is crucial to mention is that one reason to learn this is that the all the stuff in the window that you're seeing here is an array of pixels an array of colors so underneath the hood uh of a processing sketch of of an image that you might load or an image you might get from a camera all the colors of that image are stored in one giant array and you can Loop through that entire array to read all those colors and manipulate those colors so I'll also include a link below to online tutorial um and some other videos about images and pixels that you can look at that this will give you kind of the foundation for okay so hopefully um this video was helpful and you saw a little bit of processing three and some nice circles and a strangely colored shirt that does it really blend in with the background yes see look you can see the background nobody cares about that but it's interesting to me and I'm going to say goodbye now before that camera shuts off goodbye uh okay the live stream might still be going I don't know if anybody's watching or has any questions I'm going to pull that up am I still here I am uh 1052 uh if you have um any questions uh uh 10 people are watching that's interesting if you have any questions let me know right now uh I've got about 10 more minutes before I've off to um uh class with human beings as opposed to this thing that I do with lights and cameras and sunlight outside there's a window there so I can see that the world is there not just this Cave of talking about code and processing um any questions I will how far behind how how far lag is the stream I'm going to do this so I'll see how long that takes to get to me hitting my head one two it would be nice if I could get the lag I wonder actually here under stream options if I had colle oh uh yeah low latency I have that selected um maybe I should play an ad while I'm waiting that's what I'll do play ad watch this everybody oh you can't see that okay I'm going to click this play ad button and I will probably make three cents but I'm curious about it okay and uh while you're while while the ad is playing you can ask questions keep on oh it's telling me based on some complex criteria some of your viewers will see an ad are you one of those viewers uh keep on streaming I'm waiting to see if anybody has any questions otherwise I'm going to just head out of here uh let me make sure that recorded I'll come over here I'm just checking while I'm waiting uh yeah looks like it did and there's a video there you can see uh great uh okay uh thank you that's nice uh night thank you nice feedback so I'm going to do a much um I'm going to do let me just close this I'm going I'm going to do a much longer stream I can't see myself anymore over here I'm going to do a much longer stream on Thursday and possibly Friday I've got a long list of videos I'm getting to about Dom manipulation and JavaScript and data and apis uh I also really would like to do a whole bunch more videos that use processing especially I I did make a video about the new features of processing 3 but um there's some topics that I've never gotten a chance to look at in a video so hopefully I'll get to that as well I'm going to do one last check to the chat to see if anybody has any questions then I'm going to turn off the stream uh great okay I don't see any questions here uh thanks for watching all all of you and uh this will happen again soon talk to you later you can ask just questions in the comments so
