With timestamps:

00:00 - ok so where where where is your head at
00:03 - I'm not really sure but maybe now you have a
sense of
00:06 - okay I kinda get what programming is
00:08 - I've gotta write instructions with a
specific syntax
00:11 - and I could choose all these different
languages and all these different
00:14 - environments for different kinds of
applications and
00:15 - for different operating system and for
different hardware but here
00:19 - we're going to use Processing. what
advantages does
00:24 - processing give us what kinds of things
can we make with processing what is the
00:28 - lens that we're gonna look through
00:30 - to learn the fundamental concepts a
programming this is key
00:33 - we're not I'm not it's not my intention
here for you
00:36 - to learn processing it's my intention
for you to learn
00:40 - the fundamental tools of computation
we're going to use processing as the
00:45 - environment to learn those tools
00:46 - but those tools those concepts will go
across
00:49 - any programming language environment
that you choose to use in the future
00:52 - so why- as I said processing we- it's a thing
we download
00:56 - we can open it- one of the first things
you might do yourself
01:00 - and I'll kinda do this for you is take a
look through the examples
01:03 - so you can see here there's a little
window that you can pop up
01:06 - that has examples
01:07 - and you can kinda look through look
these basics and some of these basic things
01:10 - will give you a sense of
01:11 - what is processing doing. you can learn about
color, you can learn about form,
01:15 - you can learn about math
01:16 - so if for example I just go here and
lets say we wanna learn about hue
01:20 - with processing I can run this
particular example
01:24 - and you can see that what it's doing
here is as I move the mouse back and
01:27 - forth across the screen
01:28 - its changing the hue of the color that
I'm drawing
01:32 - so there's a range of examples and you'll
notice these examples, generally speaking
01:37 - have a visual design component so
01:40 - if you're interested in design, animation,
01:43 - images, creative applications of
software,
01:47 - processing is a good environment to
explore ideas in that area
01:51 - Umm another thing and I'm just
gonna kinda give you a quick range
01:54 - as you look through you might start to
look through a lot the examples
01:58 - under topics:
01:59 - and one of the ones that's sure dear to
my heart that you might look at is OK
02:03 - simulate so there's a lot of nice
examples we can look at
02:07 - this idea on what- of simulating
02:10 - physics elements through processing 
you can see there are some circles on the screen
02:14 - as I click them and move them 
with the mouse
02:16 - - my head is always- clearly this is very poorly
02:18 - what I'm doing here. Umm they there they
have this
02:22 - spring-like motion so one of the nice
things about processing is there's a-
02:25 - when you downloaded it, there's a wide range
examples and to get a sense of
02:29 - what can I do, what are some ideas of
things I might try to make: you could
02:32 - you could spend a whole day just
clicking through
02:34 - and running all of the examples
02:36 - Umm the other thing that I would just
mention is that processing
02:39 - has a in addition to the sort of 2d drawing
engine which allows you to draw
02:44 - simple and and kinda complex shapes and
animations in 2d
02:47 - you can do a lot of stuff in three
dimensions as well
02:51 - I guess I'll just open up this one
called Planets
02:54 - and we can see here's a nice- Whoo this is
beautiful! I'm going to have to use this
02:59 - for something,
03:00 - but here we can see, err this err, nice
03:03 - little demonstration of how you can do
3d rendering in processing as well
03:07 - err
03:08 - and you can see, you can do, all sorts of different 
kinds of camera stuff, lighting stuff, textures:
03:15 - all things that you might find in a 
3D computer graphics environment
03:18 - that' what you can do
03:19 - and you can do with the processing
environment as well so
03:22 - this is- I just closed everything
03:24 - that is the examples- the other thing, it's
just something else I really want to
03:29 - mention about processing
03:31 - so okay so here's something I kinda should
have might have wanted to mention,
03:35 - we have this
03:36 - a show like crazy list of all these
programming languages that I was kinda
03:41 - saying aaah,
03:42 - okay, so here we're using processing and
one thing you might think it's like
03:45 - oh is it just
03:46 - processing, it like this toy environment
that I can kind of just do a little like experimental
03:50 - ideas in buit can't really make
03:52 - a a large-scale projects with; so one of
the things that I like about processing is
03:57 - both its ability to allow you to
03:59 - get started very quickly and learn the
basics but also you can build fairly
04:02 - large scale sophisticated projects in it
04:05 - and one of the reasons for this is, is that you
aren't learning the processing language-
04:09 - yes you're using the oppressing environment
04:10 - yes there is a a set of processing
functions
04:14 - that are that are that are needed for
processing itself but really the language a
04:18 - that you're writing
04:19 - code in is Java, now Java is probably about right
now, and I refer to the era that we live in,
04:23 - 2013, it's probably like the least cool
thing you can learn like
04:27 - it's much cooler to learn JavaScript or
ruby and and there's lots of great stuff
04:31 - you can do; i mean
04:32 - javascript is especially on the web
now and, erm canvas and webGL
04:36 - all this amazing stuff that I also encourage
you to learn but
04:39 - there is an advantage to using Java or
the fact that processing is built on top of
04:45 - Java, er, you know Java is kinda
04:46 - in many ways I i've heard this said
about Java err
04:50 - something silly, but, it's not the best
04:53 - language for anything but it does
04:56 - everything, so if there's anything you're
thinking about doing,
05:00 - if you are you wanna like read your email
05:02 - into your processing program and
then draw little bubbles on the screen
05:05 - for every email you've received
05:06 - or you want to connect to the Microsoft
Kinect
05:09 - or you want to use err this physical
piece of this hardware
05:12 - you want to use the sensor
05:14 - erm, you can really do just about anything
you'll find a java library out there
05:19 - for just about anything so processing
because it's built on Java
05:22 - is incredibly extendable through
libraries
05:26 - now what are these libraries and you can
see I'm into
05:30 - if I go back to that examples window erm,
05:34 - looking through those examples topics I could go 
down to start to look at
05:37 - you want to use the libraries
05:40 - one which i'll just demonstrate really
briefly to you right now is video
05:42 - so under capturei'm gonna look at er, one of these
05:45 - examples; gonna run this mirror example
05:49 - and I think this will work
05:53 - err, its effect we should edit
05:56 - it's taking a minute or so here we can
see a look what's interesting is this is
06:00 - a green screen so you can see the green
wall in the actual camera
06:02 - so the camera here is reading my image
so processing can connect to pieces of
06:07 - hardware through libraries, can connect to
your camera
06:09 - and what this example is doing is it's
taking every single pixel from a regular
06:13 - good old-fashioned image
06:15 - and instead of drawing that pixel as a
06:17 - a a- drawing that pixel as a rectangle on
the screen rotated according to the
06:23 - brightness or something
06:24 - so you can see that we can create this
abstract visualization of the data
06:28 - the color data that's coming in from a
camera this is, err, something we'll
06:32 - explore in great detail
06:33 - in a future video how to write these
kinda examples how to capture images
06:38 - how to read pixels, how to draw stuff based on
those pixels; so
06:42 - be- the video library is something that
comes with processing when you download it
06:46 - but processing itself has a huge, has a
large community of people making
06:50 - libraries and I downloaded one an
arbitrary one
06:54 - called the Yahoo weather library we can
tell, just open up this example
06:57 - erm, this library allows you to connect
07:01 - to Yahoo- Yahoo weather data
07:04 - and you can see here that this processing
sketch
07:07 - has grabbed the weather information from
the city of berlin, it's fair, the wind
07:11 - direction is three
07:12 - 10 which must maybe is a err, angle!
07:16 - and, erm, and the wind speed is a eight
kilometers kilo-
07:21 - kilometers- I became French, so
kilometers per hour
07:24 - so you can see then this others these
particles these dots that are drawn on the screen
07:29 - that are moving according to that wind
direction: so
07:31 - connecting to data sources there if you
have an idea for something and processing
07:36 - doesn't do it
07:36 - if you can write the Java code for that
you can make it into a library and you
07:42 - can do it in processing so
07:44 - the processing is tremendously extendable
through all sorts of libraries,
07:47 - if you want to get a sense
07:48 - up what the available libraries are for
you, er,
07:51 - if we go back to the processing website
waa- and go to libraries
07:55 - you can see there is a nice list of tons
and tons
07:59 - libraries and you can also get them,
which I-I- this is err,
08:03 - through, err, through this library
manager that comes with
08:08 - processing software itself so we can go
through this list of
08:12 - libraries and if I want this library
which is
08:15 - a lightweight library for creating
animations and trans-
08:18 - transitions I can click Install and it will
install that library I can use it
08:22 - in my code- okay! so this is kinda
08:25 - at least a little bit of, erm, me getting
started showing you-
08:29 - okay! here's the process development
environment. here are
08:33 - some the examples, here some libraries, here's
the kind of things that can do
08:37 - and next thing I wanna kinda briefly
look at
08:40 - is just a quick range of some projects
08:42 - that have been made with processing to
get you thinking about
08:45 - looking at erm, larger-scale
installations and animations and and
08:50 - things that people are doing
08:51 - the first project I'm going to show you
what's called Chronograph by Casey Reas, one of the
08:55 - creators of processing and
08:57 - Tal Rosner, I apologize if I've
pronounced the name
08:59 - here incorrectly, erm, this is a project
09:03 - which I'll skip to the end
here to just show you this
09:06 - time-lapse. you can see this is a projection
piece
09:09 - that's projected onto the side of this
building which is
09:13 - New World Center in Miami Florida for
the New World Symphony so
09:16 - this is the time lapse of the piece
running, this is showing it more quickly but
09:19 - you can see this idea of
09:20 - abstract visuals projected on the side
of the building
09:23 - this is all generative, procedural this is
a piece of software
09:27 - that generates this content
09:28 - that's projected on the side of a building,
this is something that's done a lot with
09:31 - Processing, erm, I, a
09:35 - I teach a class here at ITP where the
students create work
09:38 - for a large video wall
09:39 - erm, here are a couple of examples of projects.
there, this is a project called Beluga
09:44 - I'm skipping the sound but this was a
dance performance and
09:47 - you can see that there are these dancers
that are moving and jumping on tramp-
09:52 - trampolines. this a hundred twenty foot
wide video wall, it's about
09:55 - twelve feet high and the visuals,
regenerative. this
10:00 - seascape and they responded to the
movement's of these dancers who were
10:04 - bouncing up and down
10:05 - on trampolines. so this was actually, er, it's
using processing but there are three
10:09 - separate computers running three
processing sketches
10:11 - each controlling a section of the video
wall so even these types of
10:15 - large-scale 3d
10:16 - performance graphics for performance are
made with processing; another example
10:20 - of this for the same space; this is a
project called replica
10:24 - which here
10:28 - there was a dancer live in the space
with the camera pointed at her
10:32 - and her image was then a projected onto
the wall
10:35 - and manipulated with a bit- series of
different kinds
10:38 - of time-based effects and there's music,
the dancer
10:42 - and all happening in real time; all
happening live
10:49 - okay I'm realizing I'm forgetting to mention
people's names but
10:52 - I will- erm, there'll be links below where you can
find out the- the wonderful people who
10:56 - made some of these projects so
10:57 - another thing that processing is used a lot
for is for
11:01 - motion graphics. this is a great project
by Molly Schwartz where she did an animation
11:05 - about eels; now err, called err, Bellyful of Eels; 
if you look at this a lot of this
11:09 - is done with After Effects,
11:11 - err, but here in in in this particular part of
the
11:13 - the err, animation, these eels that are
actually swimming through this
11:18 - underwater pipe sewer like space; those 
were actually made in processing
11:23 - rendered out from processing
11:25 - and incorporated into a larger animation
project and
11:27 - there are lots of wonderful examples
music videos that have been made
11:31 - with Processing
11:33 - or different types of elements that
you wouldn't want to
11:36 - hand animate, that need an algorithmic, generative process to,
11:40 - whether it's behaviors or repetition,
11:43 - were done with code, with Processing
11:45 - okay another, another co-
11:52 - like popular use of processing is for
data visualization
11:55 - a I'll show you a well-known project by
Jer Thorpe
11:59 - This here is a visualization it's grabbing
12:02 - data from Twitter and looking for people
who said, you know
12:06 - who are very excited about the fact that-
just landed in Hawaii, for example
12:10 - so anyone who posted 'just landed Hawaii'
if it was me- I wish I would have gone to Hawaii,
12:14 - I've never been there-
12:15 - but erm, my home location on Twitter will
be New York
12:19 - Jere - the project parses out
12:22 - the locations New York and Hawaii and the time
that the tweet was posted
12:26 - and draws a, this kinda arc path from
12:30 - the original location to the landing location so
its a visualization of people posting on Twitter
12:35 - about their flight and you can see
different views there's this kind of
12:39 - like horizontal view now
12:40 - it's spinning around, all this is done through
code
12:43 - through an algorithmic process to
visualize this data
12:46 - and you can see kinda
12:47 - ah, well you can't really see that but
ah,
12:49 - up here at the top left um this timescale
showing where we are and
12:55 - this er, ah where we are in time. so this is a
a great use of processing and it looks like oh
13:00 - my goodness this very like complicated
crazy 3d- how I could ever possibly
13:04 - learn how to do this;
13:05 - we're going to start with some very basic
things like how to draw a circle how to
13:09 - move a circle
13:10 - this is really just doing that also is
just lots of circles,
13:14 - a little bit of 3d, the- what's happening with
those circles is controlled by data
13:18 - so all this stuff is possible through
learning the
13:21 - foundations of programming and a a
little bit about how to draw- do stuff
13:26 - with computer graphics as well.
13:27 - ah, so I'll I'll- this is a great
project by Mary Wong
13:32 - if you're interested a lot of
13:33 - wonderful work is being done with
processing to create physical so if you
13:37 - want to print design
13:38 - I would a checking out the work of Rune Matthiesen
and err,
13:41 - course he teaches call Printing Code,
there's a tremendous suite of examples of
13:45 - using computation
13:45 - to generate print designs, err, this is a
project that Mary
13:50 - Huang made to create a, err, fashion designed
13:54 - through, through a generative process so you
can see here, the mouse
13:58 - - this is a Processing sketch running-
14:00 - with the mouse able to draw over the
figure of the human form
14:04 - and that and that what the mouse is
drawing is that
14:07 - a mated to geometry, which is used to
generate the,
14:12 - the design for a dress and Mary actually
created these dresses and
14:15 - physically fabricated them and wore them
as well and so
14:18 - a lot of stuff can be is being done
processing in terms of, erm
14:22 - take a look at the work at nervous
system,
14:24 - I'll include a link to that as well
14:26 - for making jewelry designs you can print
stuff- you can generate stuff for a
14:30 - maker bot with processing to do 3d
printing
14:32 - this is something that you could
explore a as an application
14:36 - that you might
14:37 - an idea you might do throughout if
you're following along
14:40 - with all these videos
14:41 - also doing- a creating a
14:44 - a physical computing interfaces; this
is a project
14:46 - called the mud tub um which
14:50 - kinda answers that question what's the
thing that you might want to get
14:54 - least near your computer- a big pile mud,
this is by Tom Gerhard,
14:59 - on and so this is also kind of interesting to
say like
15:03 - what you're learning here might not might not need
15:08 - to make something that has this really
obvious practical like-
15:11 - I wanna make an app, and I wanna like sell
billions of them become a
15:14 - zillionaire which actually is
15:16 - would be nice, but you know anyway
there's more to life than
15:19 - selling your apps, but err, this you can
see here
15:23 - there's a projection on this tub of mud
which is
15:25 - the graphics that's being output
15:27 - is done through processing and
processing is reading
15:29 - the sensors that are coming back in um
from the mud
15:34 - err, there's actually sensors underneath
the mud that's measuring the weight of the
15:37 - mud at any
15:38 - point which allows the the software to
read the topology essentially of the mud
15:42 - and you can see the mud becomes this
controller where
15:45 - you with your hands you can kind bounce
this ball around if I
15:48 - kinda skip to the end here you can see you
can kinda play this
15:52 - game here on a separate screen by
pressing on the mud
15:56 - so this idea of making your own physical
computing device
15:59 - your own interface a tub of mud;
another great example of this
16:03 - is err the scrollable project; I'll just
show you err
16:07 - this is by Filippo Vanucci and you can
see here is his processing
16:10 - ah, shoot!
16:12 - which I think, here is his processing
sketch which
16:17 - if you look at it, makes this nice ink
effect
16:20 - so he's created this a sketch
16:23 - and if I click around here you can see
it draws a bunch of dots and it makes this
16:27 - animation that has this ink like quality to it
16:29 - so what did he use this process sketch
for? he used it to project onto paper
16:34 - and he built sensors to measure how
16:38 - what that paper's doing. this will become
much more obvious when I show you it in a
16:41 - project called scrollables.
16:42 - and you can see these are these devices
that you can scroll the paper and I'll
16:47 - just skip ahead here
16:48 - by scrolling back and forth you can
control and animation so of course we're
16:52 - all familiar with touchscreens
16:54 - a but here we had this physical device
16:57 - which has real tactile tangible quality. because
real paper that you're scrolling and you
17:02 - can see as you scroll back and forth
17:03 - you can play for example the game pong
and this ink effect was created through
17:07 - an algorithm in processing and/or a
17:09 - and control through the physical
interface so
17:13 - you know this is very very, err, a really
really quick and dirty kind of- I don't
17:19 - know if I missed anything
17:20 - key that I wanted to show you really kinda
quick and dirty,
17:22 - just quick range of projects that
17:24 - were made in Processing. I would also
encourage you to
17:26 - on the processing website at
17:32 - to go take a look at the exhibition so
if you look at the exhibition link
17:35 - there is a ton of projects that you
can see historically you can actually go
17:40 - it's
17:41 - and you can actually go all the way back
if on the bottom here
17:44 - oh boy,
17:48 - this is getting awkward - at the bottom
here if you click on
17:51 - number one you can actually see stuff
that was posted for the process exhibition
17:55 - from
17:55 - over 10 years ago
17:56 - so this is there's a if you want to kind
of get a sense that the landscape of
18:00 - what this processing do what are the
kinds of things that I'm going to learn
18:04 - you could walk yourself through the examples
you can look at a bunch of projects that
18:08 - are made with processing but
18:09 - ultimately the rest of these videos are going
to very
18:12 - slowly by slowly piece by piece walk you
through the fundamentals of programming
18:17 - through a whole lot of graphic examples
and processing and that will help you
18:21 - generate ideas
18:22 - and things that you want that you might
wanna make and that
18:24 - really well hopefully one more
introductory video to make
18:28 - and that is a video where I'm just going to
talk through kind of the table of contents
18:32 - everything we're gonna go through you
could call it a syllabus if you want to
18:35 - but I'm kind
18:36 - of afraid to do that. so I'm gonna kind of just
give you a quick overview I think this
18:40 - I'm kinda having a problem with this is
that in the last one to a bit too long
18:43 - so
18:44 - and give you a quick overview all the
fundamentals are going to learn
18:47 - and then we're just gonna dive right in and

ok so where where where is your head at I'm not really sure but maybe now you have a sense of okay I kinda get what programming is I've gotta write instructions with a specific syntax and I could choose all these different languages and all these different environments for different kinds of applications and for different operating system and for different hardware but here we're going to use Processing. what advantages does processing give us what kinds of things can we make with processing what is the lens that we're gonna look through to learn the fundamental concepts a programming this is key we're not I'm not it's not my intention here for you to learn processing it's my intention for you to learn the fundamental tools of computation we're going to use processing as the environment to learn those tools but those tools those concepts will go across any programming language environment that you choose to use in the future so why as I said processing we it's a thing we download we can open it one of the first things you might do yourself and I'll kinda do this for you is take a look through the examples so you can see here there's a little window that you can pop up that has examples and you can kinda look through look these basics and some of these basic things will give you a sense of what is processing doing. you can learn about color, you can learn about form, you can learn about math so if for example I just go here and lets say we wanna learn about hue with processing I can run this particular example and you can see that what it's doing here is as I move the mouse back and forth across the screen its changing the hue of the color that I'm drawing so there's a range of examples and you'll notice these examples, generally speaking have a visual design component so if you're interested in design, animation, images, creative applications of software, processing is a good environment to explore ideas in that area Umm another thing and I'm just gonna kinda give you a quick range as you look through you might start to look through a lot the examples under topics and one of the ones that's sure dear to my heart that you might look at is OK simulate so there's a lot of nice examples we can look at this idea on what of simulating physics elements through processing you can see there are some circles on the screen as I click them and move them with the mouse my head is always clearly this is very poorly what I'm doing here. Umm they there they have this springlike motion so one of the nice things about processing is there's a when you downloaded it, there's a wide range examples and to get a sense of what can I do, what are some ideas of things I might try to make you could you could spend a whole day just clicking through and running all of the examples Umm the other thing that I would just mention is that processing has a in addition to the sort of 2d drawing engine which allows you to draw simple and and kinda complex shapes and animations in 2d you can do a lot of stuff in three dimensions as well I guess I'll just open up this one called Planets and we can see here's a nice Whoo this is beautiful! I'm going to have to use this for something, but here we can see, err this err, nice little demonstration of how you can do 3d rendering in processing as well err and you can see, you can do, all sorts of different kinds of camera stuff, lighting stuff, textures all things that you might find in a 3D computer graphics environment that' what you can do and you can do with the processing environment as well so this is I just closed everything that is the examples the other thing, it's just something else I really want to mention about processing so okay so here's something I kinda should have might have wanted to mention, we have this a show like crazy list of all these programming languages that I was kinda saying aaah, okay, so here we're using processing and one thing you might think it's like oh is it just processing, it like this toy environment that I can kind of just do a little like experimental ideas in buit can't really make a a largescale projects with; so one of the things that I like about processing is both its ability to allow you to get started very quickly and learn the basics but also you can build fairly large scale sophisticated projects in it and one of the reasons for this is, is that you aren't learning the processing language yes you're using the oppressing environment yes there is a a set of processing functions that are that are that are needed for processing itself but really the language a that you're writing code in is Java, now Java is probably about right now, and I refer to the era that we live in, 2013, it's probably like the least cool thing you can learn like it's much cooler to learn JavaScript or ruby and and there's lots of great stuff you can do; i mean javascript is especially on the web now and, erm canvas and webGL all this amazing stuff that I also encourage you to learn but there is an advantage to using Java or the fact that processing is built on top of Java, er, you know Java is kinda in many ways I i've heard this said about Java err something silly, but, it's not the best language for anything but it does everything, so if there's anything you're thinking about doing, if you are you wanna like read your email into your processing program and then draw little bubbles on the screen for every email you've received or you want to connect to the Microsoft Kinect or you want to use err this physical piece of this hardware you want to use the sensor erm, you can really do just about anything you'll find a java library out there for just about anything so processing because it's built on Java is incredibly extendable through libraries now what are these libraries and you can see I'm into if I go back to that examples window erm, looking through those examples topics I could go down to start to look at you want to use the libraries one which i'll just demonstrate really briefly to you right now is video so under capturei'm gonna look at er, one of these examples; gonna run this mirror example and I think this will work err, its effect we should edit it's taking a minute or so here we can see a look what's interesting is this is a green screen so you can see the green wall in the actual camera so the camera here is reading my image so processing can connect to pieces of hardware through libraries, can connect to your camera and what this example is doing is it's taking every single pixel from a regular good oldfashioned image and instead of drawing that pixel as a a a drawing that pixel as a rectangle on the screen rotated according to the brightness or something so you can see that we can create this abstract visualization of the data the color data that's coming in from a camera this is, err, something we'll explore in great detail in a future video how to write these kinda examples how to capture images how to read pixels, how to draw stuff based on those pixels; so be the video library is something that comes with processing when you download it but processing itself has a huge, has a large community of people making libraries and I downloaded one an arbitrary one called the Yahoo weather library we can tell, just open up this example erm, this library allows you to connect to Yahoo Yahoo weather data and you can see here that this processing sketch has grabbed the weather information from the city of berlin, it's fair, the wind direction is three 10 which must maybe is a err, angle! and, erm, and the wind speed is a eight kilometers kilo kilometers I became French, so kilometers per hour so you can see then this others these particles these dots that are drawn on the screen that are moving according to that wind direction so connecting to data sources there if you have an idea for something and processing doesn't do it if you can write the Java code for that you can make it into a library and you can do it in processing so the processing is tremendously extendable through all sorts of libraries, if you want to get a sense up what the available libraries are for you, er, if we go back to the processing website waa and go to libraries you can see there is a nice list of tons and tons libraries and you can also get them, which II this is err, through, err, through this library manager that comes with processing software itself so we can go through this list of libraries and if I want this library which is a lightweight library for creating animations and trans transitions I can click Install and it will install that library I can use it in my code okay! so this is kinda at least a little bit of, erm, me getting started showing you okay! here's the process development environment. here are some the examples, here some libraries, here's the kind of things that can do and next thing I wanna kinda briefly look at is just a quick range of some projects that have been made with processing to get you thinking about looking at erm, largerscale installations and animations and and things that people are doing the first project I'm going to show you what's called Chronograph by Casey Reas, one of the creators of processing and Tal Rosner, I apologize if I've pronounced the name here incorrectly, erm, this is a project which I'll skip to the end here to just show you this timelapse. you can see this is a projection piece that's projected onto the side of this building which is New World Center in Miami Florida for the New World Symphony so this is the time lapse of the piece running, this is showing it more quickly but you can see this idea of abstract visuals projected on the side of the building this is all generative, procedural this is a piece of software that generates this content that's projected on the side of a building, this is something that's done a lot with Processing, erm, I, a I teach a class here at ITP where the students create work for a large video wall erm, here are a couple of examples of projects. there, this is a project called Beluga I'm skipping the sound but this was a dance performance and you can see that there are these dancers that are moving and jumping on tramp trampolines. this a hundred twenty foot wide video wall, it's about twelve feet high and the visuals, regenerative. this seascape and they responded to the movement's of these dancers who were bouncing up and down on trampolines. so this was actually, er, it's using processing but there are three separate computers running three processing sketches each controlling a section of the video wall so even these types of largescale 3d performance graphics for performance are made with processing; another example of this for the same space; this is a project called replica which here there was a dancer live in the space with the camera pointed at her and her image was then a projected onto the wall and manipulated with a bit series of different kinds of timebased effects and there's music, the dancer and all happening in real time; all happening live okay I'm realizing I'm forgetting to mention people's names but I will erm, there'll be links below where you can find out the the wonderful people who made some of these projects so another thing that processing is used a lot for is for motion graphics. this is a great project by Molly Schwartz where she did an animation about eels; now err, called err, Bellyful of Eels; if you look at this a lot of this is done with After Effects, err, but here in in in this particular part of the the err, animation, these eels that are actually swimming through this underwater pipe sewer like space; those were actually made in processing rendered out from processing and incorporated into a larger animation project and there are lots of wonderful examples music videos that have been made with Processing or different types of elements that you wouldn't want to hand animate, that need an algorithmic, generative process to, whether it's behaviors or repetition, were done with code, with Processing okay another, another co like popular use of processing is for data visualization a I'll show you a wellknown project by Jer Thorpe This here is a visualization it's grabbing data from Twitter and looking for people who said, you know who are very excited about the fact that just landed in Hawaii, for example so anyone who posted 'just landed Hawaii' if it was me I wish I would have gone to Hawaii, I've never been there but erm, my home location on Twitter will be New York Jere the project parses out the locations New York and Hawaii and the time that the tweet was posted and draws a, this kinda arc path from the original location to the landing location so its a visualization of people posting on Twitter about their flight and you can see different views there's this kind of like horizontal view now it's spinning around, all this is done through code through an algorithmic process to visualize this data and you can see kinda ah, well you can't really see that but ah, up here at the top left um this timescale showing where we are and this er, ah where we are in time. so this is a a great use of processing and it looks like oh my goodness this very like complicated crazy 3d how I could ever possibly learn how to do this; we're going to start with some very basic things like how to draw a circle how to move a circle this is really just doing that also is just lots of circles, a little bit of 3d, the what's happening with those circles is controlled by data so all this stuff is possible through learning the foundations of programming and a a little bit about how to draw do stuff with computer graphics as well. ah, so I'll I'll this is a great project by Mary Wong if you're interested a lot of wonderful work is being done with processing to create physical so if you want to print design I would a checking out the work of Rune Matthiesen and err, course he teaches call Printing Code, there's a tremendous suite of examples of using computation to generate print designs, err, this is a project that Mary Huang made to create a, err, fashion designed through, through a generative process so you can see here, the mouse this is a Processing sketch running with the mouse able to draw over the figure of the human form and that and that what the mouse is drawing is that a mated to geometry, which is used to generate the, the design for a dress and Mary actually created these dresses and physically fabricated them and wore them as well and so a lot of stuff can be is being done processing in terms of, erm take a look at the work at nervous system, I'll include a link to that as well for making jewelry designs you can print stuff you can generate stuff for a maker bot with processing to do 3d printing this is something that you could explore a as an application that you might an idea you might do throughout if you're following along with all these videos also doing a creating a a physical computing interfaces; this is a project called the mud tub um which kinda answers that question what's the thing that you might want to get least near your computer a big pile mud, this is by Tom Gerhard, on and so this is also kind of interesting to say like what you're learning here might not might not need to make something that has this really obvious practical like I wanna make an app, and I wanna like sell billions of them become a zillionaire which actually is would be nice, but you know anyway there's more to life than selling your apps, but err, this you can see here there's a projection on this tub of mud which is the graphics that's being output is done through processing and processing is reading the sensors that are coming back in um from the mud err, there's actually sensors underneath the mud that's measuring the weight of the mud at any point which allows the the software to read the topology essentially of the mud and you can see the mud becomes this controller where you with your hands you can kind bounce this ball around if I kinda skip to the end here you can see you can kinda play this game here on a separate screen by pressing on the mud so this idea of making your own physical computing device your own interface a tub of mud; another great example of this is err the scrollable project; I'll just show you err this is by Filippo Vanucci and you can see here is his processing ah, shoot! which I think, here is his processing sketch which if you look at it, makes this nice ink effect so he's created this a sketch and if I click around here you can see it draws a bunch of dots and it makes this animation that has this ink like quality to it so what did he use this process sketch for? he used it to project onto paper and he built sensors to measure how what that paper's doing. this will become much more obvious when I show you it in a project called scrollables. and you can see these are these devices that you can scroll the paper and I'll just skip ahead here by scrolling back and forth you can control and animation so of course we're all familiar with touchscreens a but here we had this physical device which has real tactile tangible quality. because real paper that you're scrolling and you can see as you scroll back and forth you can play for example the game pong and this ink effect was created through an algorithm in processing and/or a and control through the physical interface so you know this is very very, err, a really really quick and dirty kind of I don't know if I missed anything key that I wanted to show you really kinda quick and dirty, just quick range of projects that were made in Processing. I would also encourage you to on the processing website at to go take a look at the exhibition so if you look at the exhibition link there is a ton of projects that you can see historically you can actually go it's and you can actually go all the way back if on the bottom here oh boy, this is getting awkward at the bottom here if you click on number one you can actually see stuff that was posted for the process exhibition from over 10 years ago so this is there's a if you want to kind of get a sense that the landscape of what this processing do what are the kinds of things that I'm going to learn you could walk yourself through the examples you can look at a bunch of projects that are made with processing but ultimately the rest of these videos are going to very slowly by slowly piece by piece walk you through the fundamentals of programming through a whole lot of graphic examples and processing and that will help you generate ideas and things that you want that you might wanna make and that really well hopefully one more introductory video to make and that is a video where I'm just going to talk through kind of the table of contents everything we're gonna go through you could call it a syllabus if you want to but I'm kind of afraid to do that. so I'm gonna kind of just give you a quick overview I think this I'm kinda having a problem with this is that in the last one to a bit too long so and give you a quick overview all the fundamentals are going to learn and then we're just gonna dive right in and get started
