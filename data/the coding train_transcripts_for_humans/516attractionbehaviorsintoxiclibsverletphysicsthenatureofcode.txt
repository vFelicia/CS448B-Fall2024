00:01 - okay this is our last video about toxic
00:04 - libs Verla physics course that's a huge
00:06 - topic and there's probably more things
00:07 - to fill in that we can get to later
00:09 - something today but here in this video
00:11 - it's me short sweet to the point we're
00:12 - gonna demonstrate something super
00:14 - powerful but quite elegantly simple in
00:17 - toxic libs
00:18 - the attraction behavior so one of the
00:20 - things you can do in toxic libs is make
00:23 - an object called an attraction behavior
00:26 - attraction behavior and we'll call it a
00:29 - B equals a new attraction behavior it's
00:37 - a lot of stuff to write and it just
00:39 - takes three arguments 1 2 3 so what are
00:44 - those three arguments first of all what
00:45 - does this even do I mean come on here so
00:48 - let's say we have a verlan physics world
00:50 - and it has a bunch of particles to it
00:53 - what we're saying is we want to assign
00:54 - this particle and attraction behavior we
00:57 - want to say that this particle is
00:58 - attractive meaning any other particle in
01:02 - the world will experience a force that
01:04 - pulls that particle towards it it so
01:07 - there so seems like a simple concept but
01:10 - remember when you have lots and lots of
01:13 - particles to calculate every force
01:15 - between every single one it's kind of a
01:16 - complex task we could have a thousand
01:18 - particles we make a whole bunch of them
01:20 - attractive and a whole bunch and them
01:21 - not with different degrees of attraction
01:23 - and a negative by the way attraction is
01:25 - a repulsive as a repulsion there's a lot
01:27 - that we can do here so how do we make a
01:30 - particle attractive well first we have
01:32 - to create the attraction behavior and
01:34 - that attraction behavior is going to get
01:35 - assigned to a particle object how is it
01:37 - assigned we have to pass in as the first
01:40 - argument is which particle which
01:45 - particle is the one that is going to
01:47 - experience this attraction behavior I
01:51 - think that's right yeah
01:55 - yeah yeah yeah that's right ok sorry I
01:57 - got confused for a second what is the
01:59 - second the the second argue and the
02:02 - second argument I will call the radius
02:04 - of attraction so one of the nice things
02:07 - about these behaviors is they can oh
02:10 - they can we can constrain when they be
02:13 - enabled so we can say only particles
02:16 - within this particular radius will
02:19 - experience that attraction force so this
02:21 - particle will and this particle will and
02:22 - this particle won't and this particle
02:24 - won't this is very powerful because we
02:26 - can make something very very attractive
02:27 - only when things are very close to it or
02:29 - very prevent well that actually very
02:30 - very repulsive only when things are
02:32 - really close to it or very very
02:33 - attractive when things are very far away
02:34 - from it there's a lot that we can do
02:36 - there so that radius of attraction
02:38 - that's a floating point something like
02:40 - 100 pixels and the last thing that we
02:42 - want to do is this strength so the
02:46 - strength of it is how strong is that
02:48 - attraction I mean what's the range for
02:50 - that I don't know negative infinity to
02:52 - positive infinity probably some
02:53 - reasonable numbers between like negative
02:55 - 5 and 5 or you know probably going to
02:57 - work well for the types of systems
02:58 - you're building but the important thing
03:00 - to realize is this can be positive or
03:02 - negative so we don't need attraction
03:05 - behaviors and repulsion behaviors we
03:07 - just have attraction behaviors but when
03:10 - something is and has a negative
03:12 - attraction it is repulsive and I don't
03:15 - think that as a qualitative judgment
03:17 - that it's not nice to look at it could
03:19 - be a very beautiful particle that's just
03:20 - has a repulsion associated with it but
03:23 - the Pelin talking about one thing that's
03:24 - interesting about this by the way that I
03:26 - should just point out before we look at
03:27 - the example is we did say that toxic
03:29 - lips does not have collisions does not
03:32 - have collision geometry but there are
03:34 - ways that we can make things we can make
03:38 - a we can approximate collisions with
03:40 - with without geometry and one of the
03:42 - ways we can do that is with a very very
03:45 - very strong repulsive behavior that gets
03:48 - enabled within a small radius so you can
03:51 - imagine this particle coming along this
03:53 - way and once it gets very very near it
03:55 - shoots out because it's repelled by that
03:58 - particle and if this one also repels
04:00 - that one they shoot out in opposite
04:01 - directions it will appear as if those
04:03 - particles have come together and bounced
04:05 - off of each other we're not checking the
04:07 - a geometry we're not doing a kind of
04:08 - rotation of the velocity pool cue balls
04:11 - billiard simulation but we're gonna get
04:13 - something very very similar and that's
04:15 - something you might try to do as a
04:16 - little exercise for yourself by the way
04:18 - this is a guessed too much of an aside
04:20 - but I'm just gonna mention it one of the
04:21 - really innovative things that that Nokia
04:23 - friends example that I showed it by
04:26 - carsten schmidt does is if you have
04:27 - strangely-shaped geometry one thing you
04:31 - could do is as they get near each other
04:33 - you could create a bunch of spring
04:35 - connections that suddenly get added and
04:38 - connected between those objects and s
04:39 - object come in those Springs contract
04:41 - and then push it away and then you
04:42 - delete those Springs so that's another
04:44 - way really that's kind of an advanced
04:46 - technique to figure that out but quite
04:48 - possible if you know all of these
04:50 - vertices there's no reason why you
04:52 - couldn't connect a bunch of vertices to
04:53 - another objects vertices that are
04:55 - particles with Springs so anyway there
04:57 - are ways of getting collision like
04:59 - things to happen in toxic lips I'm I'm
05:01 - speaking in generalities here let's go
05:02 - back to that attraction and an
05:05 - attraction behavior so if we come over
05:07 - here to this particular example I'm
05:09 - going to run it and we're going to see a
05:11 - couple things about this example number
05:13 - one all of the objects are attracted to
05:17 - this Center object called the attractor
05:19 - and you can see as I move it around they
05:21 - follow it this has an attraction
05:22 - behavior all of those particles
05:24 - themselves have repulsion behaviors you
05:27 - can see that's why they're not
05:28 - overlapping or coming in they're kind of
05:30 - like self-organizing into this nicely
05:32 - spaced out system because they don't
05:34 - want to get in within a certain distance
05:35 - of each other so just briefly I'm going
05:39 - to take out that repulsion behavior just
05:42 - so we can see what this looks like this
05:43 - is yet another I think we've done this
05:45 - like you know three times now we did
05:47 - attraction with with a formula for
05:50 - gravitational attraction we've added
05:51 - that into box 2d and now here we have it
05:55 - here in toxic libs we get it for free by
05:57 - just saying hey this attractor is a
06:00 - particle object and here look physics
06:02 - dot add behavior new attraction behavior
06:05 - and let's look at this let's go
06:07 - backwards point one is the strength with
06:10 - is the radius of attraction so anything
06:14 - within the entire screen we just use the
06:16 - width of the window anything on the
06:17 - screen is attracted this particle and
06:18 - then the particle is this oh boy so this
06:22 - is a little moment of confusion let's go
06:24 - back over here and say I erased that but
06:27 - we can get it back right let's we're
06:29 - gonna make this look this is gonna make
06:31 - so much sense to us when we look at this
06:33 - it's gonna be a really nice moment okay
06:35 - if we're making this attraction behavior
06:41 - we're making a new attraction behavior
06:43 - and the first thing we have to put in
06:45 - there is which particle is going to be
06:47 - assigned that attraction behavior okay
06:48 - so let's make a particle particle p1 is
06:52 - a new particle and hey that's the
06:55 - particle that should experiencing and
06:57 - here's the width and here's the strength
06:58 - the radius and the strength right this
07:00 - is how we might normally write it and
07:02 - there are plenty of examples where you
07:04 - will write it this way make the
07:05 - attraction behavior assign it to that
07:07 - particle p1 but something strange is
07:09 - going on in this example no pun intended
07:11 - I've got the word this there
07:13 - what is this class attractor extends
07:16 - particle four vertel a particle to D if
07:18 - you ever have done anything in Java
07:20 - before you might have encountered the
07:22 - word this this is kind of like saying me
07:24 - it's this like self-referential
07:26 - introspective thoughtful way of saying
07:28 - Who am I at this moment Who am I at this
07:30 - moment I'm an attractor this particular
07:33 - attractor whatever attractor has just
07:34 - been made that's the one that should get
07:36 - this that's the one that should get this
07:38 - attraction behavior so in other words if
07:41 - we have a class I'm gonna to call fish
07:45 - right we made up our own fish class and
07:48 - there we're making a new attraction
07:50 - behavior and I'm just gonna kind of
07:52 - scribble this out right that's where we
07:54 - put this in what that means is this
07:57 - particular fish the object that we're in
08:00 - we're in the fish class this fish gets a
08:03 - sign that attraction behavior this of
08:04 - course only works if fish extends verlet
08:08 - particle right because we need the only
08:14 - types of things that can be assigned an
08:15 - attraction behavior are valid particles
08:17 - so we either make the particle and
08:19 - assign it or we or we're in the class
08:22 - and we sign it to the object that's
08:24 - currently being made at that time this
08:26 - particular object so you know this is
08:28 - the kind of this is the kind of stuff
08:29 - that's confusing and awkward and weird
08:31 - but you know hopefully that makes some
08:33 - sense to you and and and the thing to
08:35 - just remember is this is another word
08:36 - for like a me Who am I know that else
08:39 - okay so we're back over here and we can
08:41 - see we're adding the attraction behavior
08:43 - with 0.1 we run this we can see
08:45 - everything is attracted now if we go
08:47 - back to particle we could say ah we're
08:49 - doing the same thing attraction behavior
08:51 - to
08:52 - particle R times 4 so R is the size of
08:55 - the circle we're saying anything that
08:57 - comes with it actually R is the radius
09:00 - of the circle that width is the diameter
09:01 - R times 2 but anything that comes within
09:03 - the radius of the circle times 4 it's
09:05 - going to experience this repulsion force
09:07 - which is gonna be pretty strong at
09:09 - negative 1 and one thing I just want to
09:11 - show you if I take this out and say R
09:12 - times just not R times 4 and we kind of
09:16 - let it stabilize a little bit you can
09:19 - see that these circles are allowed to
09:21 - come much closer together now they're
09:23 - still repelled by each other a little
09:25 - bit and if I say something like R times
09:28 - 10 which would be much more extreme
09:30 - right those circles really don't want to
09:33 - get near each other and you can see how
09:35 - that repulsion force is very very strong
09:37 - and they're kind of staying spread out
09:39 - so how we tune those forces is the
09:41 - attraction force stronger is the
09:42 - repulsive force stronger a great
09:44 - exercise by the way I think to try and
09:46 - I'm gonna mention this that you could do
09:48 - is create a system here's an exercise
09:52 - for you
09:52 - this is my assigned exercise to like do
09:59 - it someday but is create a particle it
10:02 - has two attraction behaviors a very very
10:05 - strong repulsion behavior with a small
10:08 - radius and a slightly weaker attraction
10:12 - behavior with a large radius this means
10:14 - that any particle that wanders in will
10:16 - start to be attracted will come on in
10:18 - and when it gets too close it will be
10:19 - repelled and you might get this
10:21 - interesting thing where particles kind
10:23 - of come in repel come in repel so it's
10:25 - kind of it that's something you might
10:26 - try as an experiment can you make a
10:28 - report of an both a repulsion and an
10:30 - attraction force obviously with
10:32 - different radii and different strengths
10:34 - okay so hopefully this helps you a
10:37 - little bit I encourage you to also take
10:39 - a look I think I mentioned this already
10:40 - but there is a wonderful example I'm
10:45 - just gonna pull it up under you can see
10:47 - it if you go to contributed library
10:48 - examples called attraction 2d this is a
10:51 - wonderful example which I encourage you
10:53 - to look at also which demonstrates
10:55 - attraction and repulsion forces here a
10:57 - whole lot of particles all with
10:58 - repulsion forces pouring into this
11:00 - Berlet physics world that has gravity
11:02 - and as I move
11:03 - the mouse it creates an attraction force
11:05 - and you get this kind of fluid like
11:07 - behavior well really really simple
11:09 - example is just particles with
11:10 - attraction behaviors and it's really
11:12 - nice that you can kind of do this stuff
11:14 - so easily with toxic lives and a lot
11:15 - that you can do here with this stuff
11:16 - okay great I hope you enjoyed this
11:19 - series of videos about toxic lives and
11:21 - stay tuned in the next set of videos we
11:24 - will will come back and talk about
11:25 - steering behaviors we're going to go
11:27 - back to actually not using any physics
11:28 - libraries for a little while to look at
11:30 - that kind of details of steering
11:32 - libraries and then of course if you want
11:33 - to you can add all those steering forces
11:35 - into box D and toxic libs examples as
11:38 - well thank you and see you later

Cleaned transcript:

okay this is our last video about toxic libs Verla physics course that's a huge topic and there's probably more things to fill in that we can get to later something today but here in this video it's me short sweet to the point we're gonna demonstrate something super powerful but quite elegantly simple in toxic libs the attraction behavior so one of the things you can do in toxic libs is make an object called an attraction behavior attraction behavior and we'll call it a B equals a new attraction behavior it's a lot of stuff to write and it just takes three arguments 1 2 3 so what are those three arguments first of all what does this even do I mean come on here so let's say we have a verlan physics world and it has a bunch of particles to it what we're saying is we want to assign this particle and attraction behavior we want to say that this particle is attractive meaning any other particle in the world will experience a force that pulls that particle towards it it so there so seems like a simple concept but remember when you have lots and lots of particles to calculate every force between every single one it's kind of a complex task we could have a thousand particles we make a whole bunch of them attractive and a whole bunch and them not with different degrees of attraction and a negative by the way attraction is a repulsive as a repulsion there's a lot that we can do here so how do we make a particle attractive well first we have to create the attraction behavior and that attraction behavior is going to get assigned to a particle object how is it assigned we have to pass in as the first argument is which particle which particle is the one that is going to experience this attraction behavior I think that's right yeah yeah yeah yeah that's right ok sorry I got confused for a second what is the second the the second argue and the second argument I will call the radius of attraction so one of the nice things about these behaviors is they can oh they can we can constrain when they be enabled so we can say only particles within this particular radius will experience that attraction force so this particle will and this particle will and this particle won't and this particle won't this is very powerful because we can make something very very attractive only when things are very close to it or very prevent well that actually very very repulsive only when things are really close to it or very very attractive when things are very far away from it there's a lot that we can do there so that radius of attraction that's a floating point something like 100 pixels and the last thing that we want to do is this strength so the strength of it is how strong is that attraction I mean what's the range for that I don't know negative infinity to positive infinity probably some reasonable numbers between like negative 5 and 5 or you know probably going to work well for the types of systems you're building but the important thing to realize is this can be positive or negative so we don't need attraction behaviors and repulsion behaviors we just have attraction behaviors but when something is and has a negative attraction it is repulsive and I don't think that as a qualitative judgment that it's not nice to look at it could be a very beautiful particle that's just has a repulsion associated with it but the Pelin talking about one thing that's interesting about this by the way that I should just point out before we look at the example is we did say that toxic lips does not have collisions does not have collision geometry but there are ways that we can make things we can make a we can approximate collisions with with without geometry and one of the ways we can do that is with a very very very strong repulsive behavior that gets enabled within a small radius so you can imagine this particle coming along this way and once it gets very very near it shoots out because it's repelled by that particle and if this one also repels that one they shoot out in opposite directions it will appear as if those particles have come together and bounced off of each other we're not checking the a geometry we're not doing a kind of rotation of the velocity pool cue balls billiard simulation but we're gonna get something very very similar and that's something you might try to do as a little exercise for yourself by the way this is a guessed too much of an aside but I'm just gonna mention it one of the really innovative things that that Nokia friends example that I showed it by carsten schmidt does is if you have strangelyshaped geometry one

because we need the only types of things that can be assigned an attraction behavior are valid particles so we either make the particle and assign it or we or we're in the class and we sign it to the object that's currently being made at that time this particular object so you know this is the kind of this is the kind of stuff that's confusing and awkward and weird but you know hopefully that makes some sense to you and and and the thing to just remember is this is another word for like a me Who am I know that else okay so we're back over here and we can see we're adding the attraction behavior with 0.1 we run this we can see everything is attracted now if we go back to particle we could say ah we're doing the same thing attraction behavior to particle R times 4 so R is the size of the circle we're saying anything that comes with it actually R is the radius of the circle that width is the diameter R times 2 but anything that comes within the radius of the circle times 4 it's going to experience this repulsion force which is gonna be pretty strong at negative 1 and one thing I just want to show you if I take this out and say R times just not R times 4 and we kind of let it

be much more extreme right those circles really don't want to get near each other and you can see how that repulsion force is very very strong and they're kind of staying spread out so how we tune those forces is the attraction force stronger is the repulsive force stronger a great exercise by the way I think to try and I'm gonna mention this that you could do is create a system here's an

you want to you can add all those steering forces into box D and toxic libs examples as well thank you and see you later
