00:00 - hello welcome to another programming
00:02 - from A to Z set of videos and this is
00:06 - the first video in a series of videos
00:08 - all about regular
00:12 - Expressions um Regular Expressions
00:14 - actually I mean I don't know if you
00:16 - should be like me but they are something
00:18 - that I just absolutely adore um they are
00:21 - just fun little puzzle strange things
00:23 - that you can do to just expand your mind
00:26 - and you'll find so many if you look
00:28 - around and look for regular expression
00:30 - games you'll probably find tons of games
00:32 - people are making on the internet where
00:33 - you try to like solve things with
00:34 - regular expressions and I encourage you
00:36 - to make your own but I don't want to go
00:37 - off too long about that what I want to
00:39 - do in this video is simply talk to you
00:41 - about what a regular expression is and
00:45 - in fact what's interesting about this
00:46 - topic is this topic really stands alone
00:49 - regular Expressions have nothing to do
00:51 - with JavaScript well not they have
00:52 - nothing to do but they they aren't
00:54 - inherently something that only has to do
00:55 - with JavaScript or python or Pearl or
00:58 - Java or C++ or even programming
01:00 - whatsoever and in fact a lot of what I'm
01:03 - going to show you
01:04 - today uh is how to use regular
01:06 - Expressions just as a tool for yourself
01:08 - in a text editor for writing or find and
01:11 - replace and that sort of thing um and
01:13 - you can see so here's the the downside
01:14 - of regular Expressions the downside of
01:17 - regular Expressions is that's what they
01:19 - look like so they're possibly one of the
01:22 - most cryptic strange looking things that
01:24 - you could ever possibly create with
01:27 - strings of characters and this is in
01:29 - fact a regular expression that is
01:31 - searching for phone numbers and you can
01:32 - see here that magical regular expression
01:35 - has found these three phone numbers in
01:37 - this particular piece of text which
01:39 - leads me to the discussion of what a
01:41 - regular expression actually is I don't
01:44 - know why I'm coming over here but I am
01:46 - okay um a regular expression is a
01:49 - sequence of characters that
01:52 - defines a
01:55 - search
01:57 - pattern in a search pattern for text so
02:01 - it actually comes you know if you look
02:03 - at the history of why these regular
02:04 - expression things exist read about this
02:06 - on Wikipedia you'll find that it comes
02:08 - from the mathematical concept of regular
02:10 - sets sort of an interesting side note
02:13 - but here really what what I want to show
02:15 - you how to use them is how to define a
02:17 - search pattern in a body of text so
02:20 - let's let's talk about what this means
02:22 - exactly uh
02:25 - hello this is coding
02:31 - rainbow right here is
02:34 - text okay now I want to define a search
02:38 - pattern to search inside this
02:46 - text here is a regular expression often
02:50 - referred to as reex for short regular
02:53 - expression this is a valid regular
02:55 - expression it is a pattern the pattern
02:57 - is as follows capital R followed by
03:01 - lowercase a followed by lowercase I
03:05 - followed by lowercase n followed by
03:06 - lower case b followed by lowercase o
03:08 - followed by lowercase w and you might
03:09 - think it absurd that I went through that
03:11 - whole thing but this is exactly how you
03:12 - need to think of regular Expressions you
03:14 - need to look at that sequence of
03:15 - characters and translate what each
03:18 - character means and in this case each
03:20 - one of these characters is what's known
03:22 - as a literal character
03:24 - meaning the pattern is the pattern that
03:27 - I'm searching for is literally the
03:29 - character capital r followed by
03:32 - literally the lowercase
03:34 - a so you could imagine what would happen
03:36 - if I go over to um uh I I'm not going to
03:40 - go over there if I go over to text
03:41 - editor I hit command F I'm searching in
03:43 - the text I type in Rainbow it'll
03:45 - highlight for me every time rainbow
03:46 - appears now this is unto itself not
03:49 - super powerful yet when you add the
03:53 - addition of this idea of something
03:55 - called a meta
03:58 - character a meta character meaning a
04:02 - character that does not indicate a
04:05 - single literal character but a character
04:07 - that indicates some type of more
04:10 - generalized pattern for example I could
04:13 - say I want to match the capital letter r
04:17 - followed by any possible vowel followed
04:20 - by the any possible vowel followed by
04:22 - any possible consonant followed by any
04:25 - possible uppercase character followed by
04:27 - any digit followed by any Whit space you
04:30 - can imagine how you can start to create
04:32 - more and more generic patterns that
04:34 - would multip that would match different
04:36 - kinds of text so let's think about this
04:40 - a little bit more I'm going to come back
04:41 - over here for a second and point out
04:43 - let's think about the phone number
04:45 - example I think it's a useful example to
04:47 - start with imagine you had a huge text
04:51 - you you got access to this massive text
04:53 - and you want to publish it but it has
04:55 - lots of private phone numbers in it and
04:57 - so what you ultimately want to do is
04:58 - redact the phone numbers so you need a
05:01 - way of searching throughout the text for
05:02 - every phone number but you can't say
05:04 - literally I want to search for n the
05:07 - actual numbers you have to say I want to
05:08 - search for something like I want to
05:10 - search for three numbers followed by
05:12 - either a dash or a DOT followed by three
05:14 - numbers followed by either a dash or a
05:15 - DOT followed by four numbers oh and it's
05:17 - possible the first three numbers could
05:19 - have parentheses around them and this by
05:21 - the way is exactly what this particular
05:23 - regular expression is doing so let's go
05:25 - back and unpack this a little bit more
05:27 - and let me show you what what some what
05:30 - some meta characters are so I want to
05:31 - keep a running list of meta characters
05:34 - um and I think I'm just kind of in this
05:36 - video I'm just sort of introducing the
05:38 - topic and I'm going to talk about this
05:40 - uh uh phone number example and in the
05:42 - next video I'm going to kind of start to
05:44 - go through the pieces of regular
05:46 - Expressions a little more one by one so
05:48 - I might jump around a little bit here
05:49 - then I'm going to go through them one by
05:50 - one I think that's going to work okay um
05:53 - so let's think about the phone number
05:55 - example so um my the text that I'm
05:57 - looking
05:58 - in
06:00 - has this in it 917 555 1 2 3 4 and
06:08 - 646 1867
06:11 - 5309 okay so how do I I want to create
06:14 - now a pattern that will match these so
06:17 - what could I say and let's make a
06:19 - list of meta characters over
06:23 - here the first thing I want to match is
06:26 - any digit so guess what back
06:30 - back SL d means any digit 0 through
06:34 - 9 back SL D followed by back SL D
06:38 - followed by backd followed by what
06:42 - now in this case it's always followed by
06:45 - a dash so
06:48 - Dash let's erase this so this is meta
06:52 - character meta character meta character
06:54 - literal character back SLT back SLT back
06:57 - SLT uh Das back SL D back SL D back SL D
07:01 - backd so this means search for any text
07:05 - that matches three digits followed by a
07:08 - dash followed by three digits followed
07:11 - by a dash followed by four digits so now
07:13 - what I want to do is actually show you
07:15 - this running in the wild so one of the
07:18 - things you can do in most text editors
07:20 - so for example the atom text editor the
07:23 - Sublime Text Editor a lot of things
07:25 - tools that you might use have when you
07:27 - do the command f for find there's often
07:30 - a little button there that allows you to
07:31 - search by regular expression so let's
07:34 - look at that so I'm going to come back
07:36 - over here and I'm GNA delete this we'll
07:39 - make this happen later I'm gonna do this
07:42 - so pretend I'm like this pretend I'm
07:44 - like this I am like this uh pretend that
07:47 - that other stuff didn't exist a moment
07:48 - ago and now what I'm going to do is do
07:50 - command F so normally I might do
07:52 - something like this okay type in phone
07:54 - and you can see it highlighted phone for
07:56 - me and I realized this text down here is
07:58 - very very small I'm going to try to zoom
07:59 - into it when I remember but it's it's um
08:02 - Adam doesn't I can't seem to figure out
08:03 - a way to make that text bigger um so I
08:06 - could also search for
08:07 - 91755 five and you can see I'm searching
08:10 - literally for this particular phone
08:12 - number now what I said is I could do SL
08:17 - DDD now look at this notice this just
08:20 - looks like this is actually looking for
08:21 - literally SL
08:23 - DDD in order to enable regular
08:25 - Expressions I need to go all the way
08:28 - over here
08:30 - see this button and it says use Rex so
08:33 - that button enables regular expressions
08:35 - in the search and incidentally why is it
08:39 - dot star so two more meta characters dot
08:43 - means any character I've got the wrong
08:47 - whiteboard marker again and star is
08:51 - what's known as a quantifier and again
08:53 - I'm going to go through this stuff in
08:54 - sequence meaning zero or more so this
08:59 - Dot star which you've probably seen like
09:01 - oh I want to look for all of my files
09:04 - called rainbow dostar that means it
09:06 - could be rainbow cat.png or Rainbo
09:09 - happiness. jpg or rainbow essay. dooc
09:13 - right any file right
09:17 - rainbow dostar this is often referred to
09:20 - as a wild card and it is in fact it
09:24 - comes from regular Expressions this is a
09:25 - regular expression it means I want to
09:27 - match rainbow followed by any number of
09:30 - any characters Wild Card anything zero
09:32 - or more anything this matches absolutely
09:35 - everything in the known universe this
09:37 - regular expression matches the Universe
09:40 - um okay so that's where that comes from
09:43 - back over to here we can see here dot
09:45 - star so now I'm using regular
09:46 - Expressions as soon as I do that and I
09:48 - come back over here can I come back over
09:51 - here
09:52 - oops oh I have to enable it you can see
09:55 - this is now highlighted so regular the
09:58 - uh syntax highlighting will happen for
09:59 - you and you could see that it has now
10:01 - matched all of these groups of three
10:04 - characters now notice how it's still
10:06 - matching let's say I only want to match
10:07 - groupings of three numbers notice how
10:10 - it's um matching 53 0 with the nine
10:15 - afterward so what could I do here I
10:16 - could say oh well I only want to match
10:18 - three numbers followed by a
10:21 - dash so you can see here now I'm
10:23 - matching only three numbers followed by
10:24 - a dash I could say a dash or or followed
10:27 - by anything okay well that's not really
10:30 - right so I'm going to have to over the
10:32 - course of the next few videos I'm going
10:33 - to show you all of the pieces of things
10:35 - that are part of a regular expression
10:37 - and create a bunch of different
10:38 - scenarios and examples to show you a
10:41 - bunch of examples of regular expressions
10:43 - and by the end you should have a sense
10:45 - of how they work then I'm going to show
10:48 - you how to use these regular expressions
10:49 - in code in JavaScript specifically and
10:52 - do a couple coding challenges around
10:53 - text manipulation with those regular
10:55 - Expressions okay so hope this gave you
10:57 - the basic idea and how to use them in
10:58 - atom and I'll be seeing you in future
11:00 - regular expression videos maybe okay
11:03 - thanks for
11:08 - [Music]
11:13 - watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to another programming from A to Z set of videos and this is the first video in a series of videos all about regular Expressions um Regular Expressions actually I mean I don't know if you should be like me but they are something that I just absolutely adore um they are just fun little puzzle strange things that you can do to just expand your mind and you'll find so many if you look around and look for regular expression games you'll probably find tons of games people are making on the internet where you try to like solve things with regular expressions and I encourage you to

this topic really stands alone regular Expressions have nothing to do with JavaScript well not they have nothing to do but they they aren't inherently something that only has to do with JavaScript or python or Pearl or Java or C++ or even programming whatsoever and in fact a lot of what I'm going to show you today uh is how to use regular Expressions just as a tool for yourself in a text editor for writing or find and replace and that sort of thing um and you can see so here's the the downside of regular Expressions the downside of regular Expressions is that's what they look like so they're

you can see here that magical regular expression has found these three phone numbers in this particular piece of text which leads me to the discussion of what a regular expression actually is I don't

I'm going to kind of start to go through the pieces of regular Expressions a little more one by one so I might jump around a little bit here then I'm going to go through them one by one I think that's going to work okay um so let's think about the phone number example so um my the text that I'm looking in has this in it 917 555 1 2 3 4 and 646 1867 5309 okay so how do I I want to create now a pattern that will match these so what could I say and let's make a list of meta characters over here the first thing I want to match is any digit so guess what back back SL d means any digit 0 through 9 back SL D followed by back SL D followed by backd followed by what now in this case it's always followed by a dash so Dash let's erase this so this is meta character meta character meta character literal character back SLT back SLT back SLT uh Das back SL D back SL D back SL D backd so this means search for any text that matches three digits followed by a dash followed by three digits followed by a dash followed by four digits so now what I want to do is actually show you this running in the wild so one of the things you can do in most text editors so for example the atom text editor the
