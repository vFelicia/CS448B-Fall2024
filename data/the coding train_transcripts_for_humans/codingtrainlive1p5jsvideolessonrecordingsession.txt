With timestamps:

00:05 - oh wait wait
00:23 - ah I think I might be there
00:40 - aha okay look that's me a few minutes
00:44 - ago whoa
00:48 - inception oh wow this is crazy now it's
00:54 - gonna be me pointing to me a few minutes
00:55 - ago should switch to the other camera
00:58 - for a second okay I'm over here I'm
00:59 - alive I don't know if anyone's watching
01:02 - yep can you hear me
01:14 - working now live on YouTube okay just
01:20 - posting this to Twitter okay um boy I'm
01:26 - on a delay so you're like seeing me way
01:29 - after me talking
01:32 - oops I left okay yeah okay closing this
01:43 - so I don't know how can I see if there's
01:47 - anybody here watching yes you can hear
01:53 - me that's great
01:59 - okay so I'm here I don't know if anyone
02:02 - I'm gonna record some videos I'm gonna
02:04 - minimize this boy it's quite a delay I
02:08 - should I definitely need to minimize the
02:12 - latency thing and on my list I've been
02:16 - making videos hold on
02:18 - over here I've been making videos I have
02:20 - a list over here and then the video that
02:24 - I intend to make right now is on the map
02:30 - function this thing that you're watching
02:33 - if you're watching is like the raw
02:35 - footage so I'm gonna make mistakes trip
02:38 - slobber do weird things by accident I've
02:42 - got a button here so I can switch over
02:43 - here now I'm in front of the code editor
02:46 - so what I'm doing is I'm getting ready
02:48 - so this is the example that I think I'm
02:50 - gonna make the video using and what I'm
02:52 - going to show is how to use the map
02:54 - function to have the background color
02:56 - change as the mouse moves left to right
03:00 - this is a particularly useful thing to
03:01 - do in programming graphics thingies so
03:06 - I'm gonna take a little water and I'm
03:12 - not I don't have the YouTube chat view
03:16 - up right now
03:17 - I could pull it up which will look weird
03:19 - because you're gonna see me looking at
03:21 - it watching now stats 5 watching now 5 5
03:27 - both people and what I'm gonna do is I'm
03:34 - gonna check the comments here and there
03:37 - you'll have feedback and that sort of
03:39 - thing ok look at this crazy like triple
03:43 - view thing okay so I'm gonna minimize
03:46 - that and I've got this again and about
03:50 - to start recording the actual thing
03:53 - let's see if this works okay I'm like
03:57 - lost my phone I was doing this on
03:59 - periscope yesterday which was kind of
04:01 - useful but I couldn't stream the actual
04:03 - full feed so I'm gonna stream the actual
04:06 - see you now okay here we go but-but-but
04:13 - the math function that's what this video
04:17 - is going to be about okay and three two
04:20 - one
04:22 - recording hi in this video I would like
04:29 - to look at something in p5.js called nap
04:34 - this is a function that is incredibly
04:37 - useful and it's a nice it's just a nice
04:40 - moment now if you're watching these
04:41 - videos in sequence but you don't need to
04:43 - because this video is really only about
04:44 - the map function but if you're watching
04:46 - them in sequence it's sort of a nice
04:47 - moment just figure it out too tough
04:48 - about variables I've got things stored
04:51 - in variables that are numbers and
04:52 - sometimes it's incredibly common that
04:55 - you have a number that comes in a given
04:58 - range the exact scenario that I'm gonna
05:01 - use here oh you know I forgot to turn
05:03 - the air conditioning truly messes with
05:05 - the sound you know there's this life
05:11 - going on you think I'm done making your
05:12 - video and nothing's ever gonna go wrong
05:14 - but life happens and this video is just
05:17 - always gonna have this weird moment
05:18 - where I turn the air conditioning off
05:19 - you know I'm just gonna start over it
05:23 - doesn't need to have that okay so I'm
05:26 - going to start over I'm going to erase
05:29 - this and come over here and I'm gonna
05:33 - hit stop I'm gonna see now that I'm
05:36 - taking a little posture I'm gonna check
05:37 - YouTube and there are three people
05:40 - watching so my retention it's really
05:42 - good what's up to five at up to three so
05:46 - basically I'm talking to myself except
05:48 - for the people who might actually be
05:49 - watching okay so now I am going to start
05:56 - over the thing is it's there's so much
06:00 - of a delay here by the time you see this
06:02 - I'm actually gonna have already started
06:04 - the video and I would like to see if
06:05 - people have comments you know as I stop
06:07 - and start so there's a setting in the
06:09 - YouTube stream where it like optimized
06:11 - for low latency which is clearly
06:13 - something I'm gonna have to do the next
06:14 - time I turn
06:15 - on okay now I need to start over
06:25 - hi so this video is about something in
06:28 - p5 yes and that something is the NAP
06:32 - function so a couple things one is if
06:38 - you've been watching these videos in
06:39 - sequence but you don't necessarily need
06:41 - to have been doing because this video is
06:43 - just about one singular thing but this
06:45 - is kind of a good time just learn about
06:47 - variables got a whole lot of numbers
06:49 - flipping around your code to kind of get
06:52 - that stuff under control and figure out
06:53 - a kind of a useful thing a very common
06:55 - thing scenario that comes up so the map
06:57 - function is going to solve a particular
06:58 - problem that I'm gonna demonstrate in a
07:00 - moment but before I even get to that
07:02 - what am I even talking about the NAP
07:04 - function what did this that the other I
07:13 - think I think I got high so this video
07:22 - that I'm making is about a function in
07:25 - p5.js called map so there's a very
07:30 - common scenario that comes up over and
07:33 - over and over again in programming
07:36 - graphics programming interaction working
07:39 - with data there's so many places that
07:41 - this scenario comes up comes up and so
07:43 - this particular function map is a nice
07:47 - resolution to this problem and let me
07:49 - give you a simple version of this
07:51 - problem so let's say we have a canvas
07:55 - and the canvas has a background color
08:00 - and what you want is for that background
08:04 - color to sometimes be black and
08:07 - sometimes be white so when it's black
08:11 - the color that you should put in the
08:14 - background function is zero when it is
08:21 - white the color you should put in the
08:23 - background function is 255 so we can say
08:27 - to
08:28 - the range for the background function
08:31 - that I want in this particular program
08:33 - is a number between 0 and 255 so really
08:37 - a variable might go here like call it co
08:40 - l and co l should have a range between 0
08:44 - and 255 now how do I want that value to
08:47 - be chosen when should it be black and
08:49 - when should it be white what I would
08:51 - like is when the mouse pointer is at
08:54 - this side of the screen I want the
08:56 - background to be black and when the
08:58 - mouse pointer is at this side of the
08:59 - screen I want the background to be white
09:02 - so I would like to create a scenario
09:04 - where I move the mouse left and right
09:07 - left and right and I see the background
09:08 - shift from black all the way to Y down
09:11 - to gray darker gray down to black etc so
09:15 - this is what we want to program now
09:18 - let's say this canvas has dimensions of
09:21 - 600 by 400
09:24 - so mouse X is a variable if you've been
09:27 - watching these videos in sequence which
09:28 - you don't need to have been to watch
09:30 - this particular video mouse X is so sort
09:32 - of recent new phenomenon that I just
09:35 - talked about in a previous video so if
09:38 - the these are the dimensions of the
09:40 - canvas we know that Mouse X has a range
09:42 - that goes between 0 and 600 so we now
09:48 - want the background color to have a rate
09:53 - of sorry we want to lost my train of
09:56 - thought there
09:56 - so the house has a range between 0 and
09:58 - 600 and the background color we want to
10:00 - have a range between 0 and 255 so we
10:03 - need to take this value with this range
10:06 - and what we want to do map it to this
10:10 - range when Mouse x equals 0 background
10:13 - color equals 0 when mouse x equals 600
10:16 - background color equals 255 let's kind
10:18 - of like start doing that a little bit
10:20 - for a moment without the map function at
10:22 - all okay so here's the program I'm going
10:26 - to actually simplify this for a second
10:29 - var color equals 0 I'm gonna say
10:33 - background color and
10:36 - you can see this so we could see here
10:37 - here I'm running this program this
10:39 - ellipse is being drawn where the mouse
10:41 - is so we can see and the background is
10:42 - being colored according that variable
10:44 - but the background color is not changing
10:45 - because I set it equal to zero and I
10:47 - never changed it so now I could try to
10:50 - do some math like I could just say color
10:52 - equals Mouse X like why not that's
10:55 - pretty good whatever the value of Mouse
10:57 - X is set the background color to that so
10:59 - let's see what happens I'm gonna run
11:01 - this look it's working it's changing but
11:04 - it's already white why because as soon
11:06 - as I get to pixel 255 that's the full
11:11 - whiteness so I'm not getting this
11:13 - perfect mapping it's kind of like
11:17 - working but it's not exactly right so I
11:18 - could be approximate I could say okay
11:20 - well let's the canvas is 600 pixels wide
11:23 - why don't I / - that's pretty good
11:26 - 601 a sex is / - that's getting me
11:30 - pretty close it actually kind of looks
11:32 - like it's working on that you know we
11:35 - kind of solved the problem but here's
11:36 - the thing
11:37 - this problem that we have just sort of
11:39 - barely solved over there
11:41 - this is a very simplistic view of it but
11:44 - there's lots of times where you have a
11:45 - sensor like data coming in from some
11:47 - sensor and the range is between you know
11:49 - 321 and 1,057 and then you want to map
11:53 - that range to some other set of values
11:57 - and actually that other set of values
11:59 - has a range between 20 and 35 and the
12:01 - math is a little bit trickier or perhaps
12:03 - you want to take a value that goes
12:04 - between 0 and 200 and invert that and
12:07 - map that between 200 down to 0 so
12:09 - there's lots of more complex scenarios
12:11 - the map function is a general function
12:15 - that will take any range and map a value
12:18 - inside that range to a new value in any
12:20 - other range so let's take a look how
12:25 - that works in this context
12:30 - so there's first of all what I mean by
12:34 - function so already you know about
12:37 - hopefully you know about calling
12:39 - functions in p5 right you might have
12:41 - done this line is a function that takes
12:46 - four arguments one two three four and
12:49 - what is it - it draws a line from you
12:52 - know a point one hundred one hundred
12:53 - fifty fifty done so map it's the same
12:57 - thing it's a function that takes some
12:59 - amount of arguments it's actually going
13:01 - to be five arguments I better give
13:04 - myself more room here I can see that
13:07 - you're not gonna be able see this okay
13:09 - map it takes five arguments one two
13:13 - three four okay so this seems like oh
13:19 - boy five arguments that's terrifying but
13:21 - it's actually it's not so bad so
13:23 - remember I have a range that goes
13:27 - between zero and six hundred this is the
13:30 - range we know that Mouse X is and I want
13:34 - to map this range to arrange between 0
13:37 - and 255 which is what I want to assign
13:40 - to my variable color so the arguments
13:45 - that map requires are the following
13:47 - what is the minimum and maximum of my
13:51 - current range 0 to 600 what is the
13:57 - minimum and maximum of my new range 0 to
14:02 - 255 and what is the value that has this
14:06 - range and which I want to map to the new
14:09 - range well in this case it's Mouse X so
14:12 - I want to map Mouse X which I know has
14:16 - this range that's the X values and I
14:19 - want to map it to this range between 0
14:21 - to 55 for the purpose of color and then
14:23 - when I map it what do I do with it I
14:25 - want to take the result of that mapping
14:28 - and set it equal assign the result to my
14:31 - variable color so this is what's
14:33 - actually something quite new about this
14:35 - map function the line function doesn't
14:38 - do any it performs a task
14:41 - line it draws a line in the canvas it's
14:44 - well whatever you know the computer
14:45 - draws a line on the canvas the math
14:47 - function actually performs a calculation
14:48 - and answers a question it resolves to a
14:52 - single number so I can use that number
14:54 - and assign it back to this variable okay
14:57 - so this is kind of a new concept let's
14:59 - go try to do it in this program so right
15:03 - instead of my goofy like math here Mouse
15:07 - X divided by two what I want to do now
15:10 - is use that map function so I'm gonna go
15:12 - over here I'm gonna say map Mouse X
15:15 - which has a range between 0 and 600 oops
15:19 - I guess I better zoom back out and that
15:22 - give me a new value within a new range
15:24 - between 0 and 255
15:26 - so here Mouse X between 0 and 600 give
15:30 - me a range in 0 to 255 and assign that
15:32 - to this variable color which I'm then
15:34 - going to use in background and watch
15:36 - this we can see all the way perfectly
15:39 - white at pixels 600 perfectly back black
15:41 - at pixel zero let's have a little more
15:44 -  with this 5 is all relative of
15:47 - course let's give ourselves two more
15:50 - variables so I'm gonna make a variable R
15:57 - and B R for red B for blue and what I'm
16:01 - going to do is I'm going to set the red
16:03 - value equal to that mapping so you can
16:07 - see now right blue is that 255 red is
16:12 - that zero and red R is getting that
16:15 - mapping with Mouse X so as I move to the
16:18 - right I get more pink and purple all the
16:21 - way back more blue and here's something
16:23 - interesting I could do with map
16:25 - let's also map the blue value but
16:29 - instead of saying when the mouse is at 0
16:33 - the blue is at 0 and the mouse is at 600
16:36 - the blue is at 255 let's do the reverse
16:38 - let's say when the mouse is at 0 we have
16:41 - 255 blue and when the mouse is all the
16:44 - way on the other side we have 0 blue so
16:46 - we can also invert that range which is
16:48 - great that map will
16:49 - that for us and all the way we could see
16:54 - I give all the way red all the way blue
16:56 - it in the middle I've got red and blue
16:58 - together so you know and also by the way
17:00 - well you know if you're thinking of so
17:02 - you might take this exercise maybe add
17:05 - mouse Y to it try to map announce why
17:07 - there's all sorts of possible things you
17:09 - can do with this so hopefully that gives
17:10 - you a bit of a sense of the map function
17:13 - and that you found that useful possibly
17:17 - came to stop this oops okay I'm still
17:22 - live streaming YouTube let's see if
17:26 - anybody's there fourteen people okay so
17:35 - I'm waiting till the video the stream
17:39 - catches up to where I am in real time
17:40 - I'm gonna drink some water and then
17:48 - perhaps anybody have some comments if
17:52 - this is useful
17:56 - I guess what I'm gonna do in the next
17:58 - video I'm going to record something
18:02 - about the random function I think this
18:06 - is the thing in between when I record I
18:08 - like to I don't know act silly I guess
18:12 - but this is now I don't know recorded
18:13 - for posterity
18:14 - uh hey I don't know how I know you from
18:20 - github Yannick uh I don't know how to
18:22 - pronounce her name I'm embarrassed so
18:24 - you could type in the chat a phonetic
18:25 - version Joshua Davis hello
18:28 - Boff XP it's nice to have some people
18:32 - watching this is really terrible though
18:36 - that the chat is way behind where I am
18:38 - in real-time
18:39 - again I'm gonna have to fix I know I'm
18:41 - just keep repeating myself so anyone
18:42 - have any comments about that video
18:44 - questions yeah it's totally totally and
18:52 - because I'm going to I'm gonna record
18:55 - books I'm a record a new one about
18:58 - random stop the rent stop random
19:03 - know what that means John yeah Johnny in
19:07 - English okay thank you
19:12 - okay well okay so I think I'm just gonna
19:15 - get started
19:16 - cuz this is this this isn't really
19:17 - working as live interaction which is
19:19 - unfortunate I guess I could quit the
19:21 - stream and like reset the settings to
19:23 - try to get it more in sync but I think
19:25 - I'll just I'm gonna record more this
19:26 - afternoon and when I start another live
19:28 - stream oh look I can create this wave
19:31 - thing except it's very severely delayed
19:34 - hello in there okay it's okay
19:40 - everything's gonna be okay don't worry
19:43 - you're gonna make these videos and you
19:45 - won't go totally insane being in a room
19:48 - by yourself talking to yourself on
19:50 - YouTube or something all right
19:55 - great okay so I was trying to do finish
19:59 - these up before noon and so I'm gonna go
20:03 - onto the next one
20:05 - okay okay so I got to minimize this I
20:11 - look at my Twitter you guys can now see
20:15 - that too okay and I minimized that
20:17 - random okay so what do I want to do with
20:20 - random I don't know yet we will just
20:26 - have to figure it out you know what I'm
20:32 - going to do this
20:37 - I don't know I'm gonna do yet I'll
20:39 - figure it out okay uh you drink a little
20:42 - this coffee let me do a couple jumping
20:50 - jacks some of these and then I'm gonna
20:55 - get ready to press record make sure this
21:00 - video uh I should erase this Wow I know
21:07 - what I need to do
21:08 - I had a painting program you know I
21:14 - haven't been good at saving these let's
21:17 - see what this is but this might actually
21:20 - be it perfect
21:22 - okay so we'll do random with this I
21:29 - think could work yeah okay oh I forgot
21:36 - okay sorry I forgot to switch the camera
21:39 - okay here we go there we go here we go
21:43 - here we go
21:45 - and now record
21:54 - start over okay so if you just started
22:01 - learning programming you're using p5 GS
22:04 - you're living in the world typing you're
22:06 - thinking about colors I gotta start over
22:08 - and what I'm talkin about
22:18 - so you've come to this point where
22:21 - you've got some basics down you've got a
22:23 - canvas you're drawing some stuff got
22:25 - colors hopefully you also went outside
22:28 - enjoyed some sunshine at some point and
22:31 - now you're ready for something a little
22:32 - bit more so a good thing I think to sort
22:34 - of start playing around with when you're
22:36 - working with graphics and interaction
22:38 - and just trying to make things move and
22:40 - happen on the screen really what you
22:43 - need to eat is conditional logic and
22:45 - that's gonna be the topic of my next
22:46 - video but before I get to that something
22:49 - that will let you sprinkle on a little
22:50 - more excitement onto your p5 sketches is
22:53 - the function random you know so what
23:00 - does random do for you random will give
23:03 - you a random number so up until now
23:07 - we've most of the examples have done
23:08 - things like here's a color 255 comma 30
23:13 - comma 60 and and in a lot of cases it's
23:16 - nice to pick from a particular color
23:17 - palette for whatever reason but perhaps
23:19 - you want a random color or you want to
23:20 - put a whole lot of circles randomly on
23:22 - the screen or if you think about the
23:24 - painting program that I started with in
23:26 - a couple videos ago maybe every time you
23:28 - click the mouse you're painting with a
23:30 - new random color every time you press a
23:32 - key and the background erases you've got
23:35 - a new random background so ah ah the
23:38 - camera turned off that's good because I
23:39 - hated what I was doing anyway
23:42 - so I got a start over which is just fine
23:46 - just fine by me hit stop the live stream
23:52 - has all of this in it this is quite
23:56 - ridiculous but it works okay uh okay
24:01 - let's start over and drink some water
24:07 - and press record if I press record I'll
24:15 - start recording okay so this is the last
24:20 - video I'm making in this or a little
24:21 - section about variables and you're
24:24 - limited in what you could do so far I've
24:26 - been playing around we've had that map
24:27 - function if you watched the previous
24:28 - video which was kind of an exciting
24:30 - moment now I'm gonna make something it
24:33 - to be honest we've just got a screen
24:34 - with some colors and shapes on it and
24:36 - eventually your creative energy will
24:39 - shine through it's video is gonna happen
24:45 - I swear so here we are this is the last
24:52 - video in this little section about
24:54 - variables in p5.js and before I go I'm
24:57 - not going anywhere because all I do is
24:58 - stay in this room and make videos before
25:00 - before I go on to the next topic which
25:02 - is conditional logic which will really
25:04 - unlock a lot of creative possibilities
25:05 - for you I want to give you one last tool
25:07 - that'll hopefully make things a little
25:10 - bit more exciting in your life and that
25:14 - is the random function so the random
25:16 - function so we we you and me together
25:21 - I've been doing a lot of stuff like this
25:24 - VAR x equals 50 this is well and good
25:28 - and because X is a variable and 50 is a
25:32 - perfectly fine number and I'm happy with
25:34 - my rectangle at pixel 50 but there might
25:37 - be a time where you want the whole point
25:40 - of doing this programming thing is to
25:41 - have systems of logic rules to generate
25:45 - behaviors and graphics and designs it's
25:48 - not really about like let me pick my
25:50 - five favorite numbers and set those
25:52 - variables for those numbers so there's a
25:53 - lot more to it but a first step in that
25:55 - direction so we could at least say
25:56 - here's the rule whenever my program runs
25:59 - the circle will appear at a random X
26:02 - location so instead of saying bar x
26:05 - equals 50 I could say something like var
26:08 - x equals random and random is a function
26:12 - just like any other function line
26:15 - ellipse fill stroke it
26:19 - acquire some arguments to define how
26:22 - that function will behave and random if
26:25 - you watch the previous video is just
26:26 - like the map function and if you recall
26:29 - or if you didn't watch it the difference
26:31 - is when you say line a line is drawn on
26:34 - the screen the line function performs
26:36 - the task when you say random a task is
26:39 - performed picking a random number but
26:41 - that function resolves to it evaluates
26:44 - to that number and you can take that
26:45 - number what it resolves to and assign it
26:50 - back to something a variable value in
26:52 - this case so if I say zero comma 50 I'm
26:56 - kind of at the edge of the semicolon
26:58 - there the parameters the arguments that
27:00 - random takes are a minimum and a maximum
27:04 - and random will give you a number in
27:08 - between zero and fifty one thing that's
27:11 - important here to realize which is a
27:14 - small little distinction is that here
27:17 - are some numbers you might get to 2170
27:21 - look at 73 it's about 50 42 but I will
27:26 - mention you probably won't ever get
27:28 - these I mean we could get these numbers
27:29 - we're likely gonna get numbers like this
27:32 - right it's giving you actually what is
27:35 - sometimes referred to as floating-point
27:36 - numbers or decimal numbers so in this
27:39 - case it doesn't really matter p5 can
27:41 - handle that if you get the number 50
27:43 - point three four five six seven it knows
27:44 - to just draw something at pixel 50 but
27:48 - there's other cases where we might need
27:49 - to do a little something more with that
27:50 - I probably shouldn't even mention this
27:52 - because it's like a little unnecessary
27:53 - point of confusion but I've already
27:55 - started recording this video like 5
27:57 - times so I'm going for it okay
27:59 - so let's actually start messing around
28:01 - with this and see what happens okay so I
28:04 - have a sketch here actually I'm gonna
28:07 - start a new one I know I'm gonna say
28:10 - file new project and I'm gonna call this
28:15 - dots and what I would like to do is have
28:20 - some variables and I'm you know I'm
28:22 - gonna use objects since we learned about
28:24 - this I covered those in a previous video
28:26 - so I have a point
28:29 - and I'm also gonna have a color let's
28:37 - see how I'm doing here with my having
28:39 - just learned JavaScript syntax so you
28:42 - can see I'm setting up a couple
28:43 - variables I want to have a point that
28:46 - has an X and oo I my finger disappeared
28:48 - the point that has an x and a y I want
28:50 - to have a color with an R a G and a B
28:52 - because my plan for all this is first
28:56 - and setup obviously to create a canvas
28:58 - let's make it a nice small size and then
29:02 - in Drew and then what I'm gonna do is
29:03 - I'm gonna I'm gonna set a background I'm
29:05 - gonna set it in set up cuz I'm gonna
29:06 - just just backgrounds just happen once
29:08 - and then in the lips I'm going to draw
29:11 - the ellipse at point x comma point y
29:15 - it's gonna be a small lips and I'm gonna
29:18 - fill it at color are color dot G color
29:22 - dot B so I can zoom back out here and we
29:28 - can see we should be able to run this
29:30 - sketch now hit run okay problem with
29:35 - scope what happened look at this
29:39 - interesting ellipse is receiving an
29:40 - empty variable in spot number one two if
29:45 - this is not intentional color dot R
29:47 - color dot B I could put some semicolons
29:53 - here what did I miss
29:59 - RGB help help look at this what am I
30:11 - doing here
30:11 - Oh ellipse no it's ellipse it's got oh
30:14 - look some crazy stuff has happened here
30:16 - some horrible stuff this video is a
30:19 - disaster I'm gonna fix it I'm gonna cut
30:24 - this out if I remember to point comma X
30:30 - 100 Y is 50 point X point y
30:34 - oh it's alright let's let's do some
30:36 - things first when we have these kind of
30:38 - problems this is a useful point let's
30:42 - just comment out the offending lines of
30:45 - code it's save and hit run okay no
30:48 - errors anymore let's let's comment back
30:51 - in fill you can figure out what's going
30:53 - on
30:54 - still no errors let's draw an ellipse
30:56 - the old-fashioned way and let's see if
31:02 - this works okay that seems good now
31:05 - what's wrong with my point X and point y
31:07 - let's try this just point comma X let's
31:12 - run it again empty variable in spot one
31:16 - you know wonder if point let's call it
31:20 - spot if there's something wrong with
31:22 - using point yeah huh this interesting
31:29 - I'm gonna have to look into that so I
31:33 - don't know if point must be some keyword
31:34 - that's doing oh oh I've done something
31:37 - horrible boy wow this is great this is
31:40 - great okay I know what's happened I know
31:42 - what's happened this is great okay so so
31:48 - here's the thing what would I just do
31:51 - let's think of some functions in p5 I
31:54 - know I'm off on like this horrible
31:56 - tangent now for another five minutes but
31:58 - some functions in pi5 are like line a
32:02 - rectangle for drawing a rectangle
32:03 - ellipse for drawing an ellipse what if
32:07 - you want to draw a point on the screen
32:08 - huh well what's that function again
32:10 - point so point is like a kind of an
32:15 - important thing in p5 that's meant for
32:17 - something highly specific drawing a
32:20 - point so if I try to make up a variable
32:24 - called point I've completely overridden
32:27 - the existing point function and you know
32:31 - what I didn't actually override it
32:33 - because p5 then overrode my variable
32:35 - because things are happening in weird
32:36 - orders and strange ways so that didn't
32:39 - work he was trying to like use the point
32:41 - function as the place to draw the point
32:43 - and everything exploded I got a weird
32:45 - error message so that might be something
32:48 - that
32:48 - p5 could handle with a friendlier
32:50 - message and maybe after this video is
32:52 - over someone will file a github issue
32:54 - maybe that person will be me but let's
32:55 - go back and we solve it but hopefully
32:57 - you saw this the steps of debugging of
33:00 - like everything was like exploding and
33:02 - going wrong and just if you can't take a
33:03 - deep breath calm down convert some stuff
33:06 - out start putting it back in slowly see
33:09 - where things go wrong we've gotten a bit
33:10 - further but now we're back I'm back this
33:14 - video still only at 8 minutes which is
33:16 - totally reasonable and we're going to
33:19 - I'm going to go back and change this to
33:21 - spot and I'm gonna say spot X spot comma
33:25 - Y and I'm going to run it and you can
33:29 - see there we go I have the circle and
33:31 - I'm gonna move this over here being
33:33 - drawn excuse me I I'm like what this -
33:38 - give me a little more space I have the
33:40 - circle being drawn at 100 comma 50 where
33:44 - the spot is with this particular color
33:46 - so what happens we start to add some
33:48 - randomness here so one thing I could do
33:51 - first remember draw looping over and
33:53 - over and over again so what if I just
33:56 - say spot x equals random between 0 and
33:59 - 600 this is another thing it's worth
34:01 - mentioning I want I have a random spot
34:03 - anywhere between 0 and the width of that
34:05 - canvas the width of that canvas is 600
34:08 - so I could write the number 600 there
34:11 - there does happen to be a built-in
34:13 - variable in p5 that knows just
34:15 - dynamically what the width of the window
34:17 - is and this is useful to use because if
34:19 - I use that variable width here instead
34:21 - of typing 600 if I later change the size
34:24 - and create canvas I don't have to change
34:26 - it elsewhere in my code so I'm gonna do
34:27 - that and I'm also gonna say spot dot y
34:30 - is random 0 - height so now let's run
34:34 - this program and look I just get spots
34:37 - all over the place spot spot spots all
34:39 - with a nice red color but perhaps what I
34:42 - want is to say color dot R equals random
34:47 - between like I'm gonna 100 and 255 color
34:50 - G is always zero color dot B is random
34:54 - between you know
34:57 - 101 90 I'm just picking like random
35:00 - arbitrary ranges here and now we might
35:02 - see look I've got a nice variation of
35:05 - random purplish-pinkish DOS and I could
35:08 - even say add a little bit of alpha here
35:11 - and run this again and you can see I
35:15 - have a nice little like pointillist and
35:18 - you can actually one thing you're
35:19 - noticing here if you look really close
35:20 - there's a little black outlines because
35:22 - I didn't turn off the stroke so what I'm
35:25 - going to do now is say no stroke and
35:27 - stop and start and there they just look
35:31 - at this beautiful all these nice little
35:33 - dots layering there's a nice little
35:35 - pointillist thing so you could take this
35:38 - much farther you can make random sizes
35:40 - you can map the random ranges based on
35:43 - like where like if the dots appear on
35:45 - the left they're more greenish if
35:46 - they're on the right they're more
35:47 - blueish so there's so much you could do
35:49 - try to see maybe try to create a random
35:53 - painting here you could use other shapes
35:55 - besides just circles that sort of thing
35:57 - that sort of says an exercise you could
35:59 - try I also might return to this
36:01 - particular program if you remember this
36:04 - we worked on just a little bit of a
36:05 - painting program where you move the
36:08 - mouse around and as you move the mouse
36:10 - around you paint something and so what
36:14 - if you could every time you write now
36:15 - your time you click the mouse it erases
36:17 - the background what if you go every time
36:19 - you click the mouse you get a random
36:20 - background color or as you move the
36:23 - mouse the color changes randomly so
36:26 - there's lots of thinked interesting
36:28 - possibilities there it can make this
36:29 - painting program a bit more
36:30 - sophisticated ok so that is the end of
36:33 - this video and I think this wraps up my
36:36 - section of videos on variables and I'm
36:38 - gonna keep that weird little thing that
36:41 - that happened that I think was a good
36:43 - good moment for today ok see you later
36:52 - now I'm gonna go back to YouTube how do
36:57 - I get back to YouTube Here I am I think
37:06 - YouTube is recording it so it will be
37:11 - saved also I am recording the VIP like I
37:18 - am seperately recording the finished
37:24 - videos anybody have any feedback on that
37:29 - all you fourteen people watch it boy I
37:34 - mean not that I expect there would be
37:36 - more so I guess I'm gonna take a I'm
37:41 - kind of got some momentum here I think
37:43 - I'm gonna though I feel like this is
37:45 - this finishes up this section I'm gonna
37:46 - I'm gonna stop this broadcast so the um
37:50 - and but I have this idea of recording
37:54 - some videos about git and github which I
37:56 - might do at some point today but I need
37:58 - to work on uploading all this stuff so
38:00 - I'm gonna stop this session say goodbye
38:03 - to you lovely fourteen people who are
38:06 - watching thank you very much and I don't
38:12 - know that's it and then I'm gonna come
38:14 - back later today probably I'm kind of
38:17 - addicted to making these videos I have
38:18 - someone there some emails and some other
38:20 - stuff anybody have any other comments
38:22 - they want to add except you won't hear
38:24 - me say this for 30 seconds
38:31 - I'm waiting 30 seconds see what he has
38:33 - in the last comments I would see how far
38:36 - behind I am because if I clap how long
38:40 - shall I clap one one thousand two one
38:41 - thousand three one thousand four one
38:43 - thousand five one thousand six one
38:45 - thousand seven one thousand eight one
38:46 - thousand 1,010 1,011 1,012 1031 I'm is
38:58 - my clapping I do have a video on Perlin
39:02 - noise let me find it Perlin noise video
39:05 - Schiffman I have a bunch of them this
39:09 - bears are on Vimeo they're also on
39:10 - YouTube if you care here is the YouTube
39:11 - one so I will paste it here yeah I will
39:18 - yeah I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna always this
39:21 - now that this works I'm gonna always
39:22 - stream these recording sessions you know
39:24 - as long as people can stomach watching
39:26 - or though I guess you don't have to
39:27 - obviously and then I will I'll always
39:31 - just post a Twitter I guess when I'm
39:33 - doing that okay I gotta turn this off
39:35 - stream is ending signing off thank you

Cleaned transcript:

oh wait wait ah I think I might be there aha okay look that's me a few minutes ago whoa inception oh wow this is crazy now it's gonna be me pointing to me a few minutes ago should switch to the other camera for a second okay I'm over here I'm alive I don't know if anyone's watching yep can you hear me working now live on YouTube okay just posting this to Twitter okay um boy I'm on a delay so you're like seeing me way after me talking oops I left okay yeah okay closing this so I don't know how can I see if there's anybody here watching yes you can hear me that's great okay so I'm here I don't know if anyone I'm gonna record some videos I'm gonna minimize this boy it's quite a delay I should I definitely need to minimize the latency thing and on my list I've been making videos hold on over here I've been making videos I have a list over here and then the video that I intend to make right now is on the map function this thing that you're watching if you're watching is like the raw footage so I'm gonna make mistakes trip slobber do weird things by accident I've got a button here so I can switch over here now I'm in front of the code editor so what I'm doing is I'm getting ready so this is the example that I think I'm gonna make the video using and what I'm going to show is how to use the map function to have the background color change as the mouse moves left to right this is a particularly useful thing to do in programming graphics thingies so I'm gonna take a little water and I'm not I don't have the YouTube chat view up right now I could pull it up which will look weird because you're gonna see me looking at it watching now stats 5 watching now 5 5 both people and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna check the comments here and there you'll have feedback and that sort of thing ok look at this crazy like triple view thing okay so I'm gonna minimize that and I've got this again and about to start recording the actual thing let's see if this works okay I'm like lost my phone I was doing this on periscope yesterday which was kind of useful but I couldn't stream the actual full feed so I'm gonna stream the actual see you now okay here we go butbutbut the math function that's what this video is going to be about okay and three two one recording hi in this video I would like to look at something in p5.js called nap this is a function that is incredibly useful and it's a nice it's just a nice moment now if you're watching these videos in sequence but you don't need to because this video is really only about the map function but if you're watching them in sequence it's sort of a nice moment just figure it out too tough about variables I've got things stored in variables that are numbers and sometimes it's incredibly common that you have a number that comes in a given range the exact scenario that I'm gonna use here oh you know I forgot to turn the air conditioning truly messes with the sound you know there's this life going on you think I'm done making your video and nothing's ever gonna go wrong but life happens and this video is just always gonna have this weird moment where I turn the air conditioning off you know I'm just gonna start over it doesn't need to have that okay so I'm going to start over I'm going to erase this and come over here and I'm gonna hit stop I'm gonna see now that I'm taking a little posture I'm gonna check YouTube and there are three people watching so my retention it's really good what's up to five at up to three so basically I'm talking to myself except for the people who might actually be watching okay so now I am going to start over the thing is it's there's so much of a delay here by the time you see this I'm actually gonna have already started the video and I would like to see if people have comments you know as I stop and start so there's a setting in the YouTube stream where it like optimized for low latency which is clearly something I'm gonna have to do the next time I turn on okay now I need to start over hi so this video is about something in p5 yes and that something is the NAP function so a couple things one is if you've been watching these videos in sequence but you don't necessarily need to have been doing because this video is just about one singular thing but this is kind of a good time just learn about variables got a whole lot of numbers flipping around your code to kind of get that stuff under control and figure out a kind of a useful thing a very common thing scenario that comes up so the map function is going to solve a particular problem that I'm gonna demonstrate in a moment but before I even get to that what am I even talking about the NAP function what did this that the other I think I think I got high so this video that I'm making is about a function in p5.js called map so there's a very common scenario that comes up over and over and over again in programming graphics programming interaction working with data there's so many places that this scenario comes up comes up and so this particular function map is a nice resolution to this problem and let me give you a simple version of this problem so let's say we have a canvas and the canvas has a background color and what you want is for that background color to sometimes be black and sometimes be white so when it's black the color that you should put in the background function is zero when it is white the color you should put in the background function is 255 so we can say to the range for the background function that I want in this particular program is a number between 0 and 255 so really a variable might go here like call it co l and co l should have a range between 0 and 255 now how do I want that value to be chosen when should it be black and when should it be white what I would like is when the mouse pointer is at this side of the screen I want the background to be black and when the mouse pointer is at this side of the screen I want the background to be white so I would like to create a scenario where I move the mouse left and right left and right and I see the background shift from black all the way to Y down to gray darker gray down to black etc so this is what we want to program now let's say this canvas has dimensions of 600 by 400 so mouse X is a variable if you've been watching these videos in sequence which you don't need to have been to watch this particular video mouse X is so sort of recent new phenomenon that I just talked about in a previous video so if the these are the dimensions of the canvas we know that Mouse X has a range that goes between 0 and 600 so we now want the background color to have a rate of sorry we want to lost my train of thought there so the house has a range between 0 and 600 and the background color we want to have a range between 0 and 255 so we need to take this value with this range and what we want to do map it to this range when Mouse x equals 0 background color equals 0 when mouse x equals 600 background color equals 255 let's kind of like start doing that a little bit for a moment without the map function at all okay so here's the program I'm going to actually simplify this for a second var color equals 0 I'm gonna say background color and you can see this so we could see here here I'm running this program this ellipse is being drawn where the mouse is so we can see and the background is being colored according that variable but the background color is not changing because I set it equal to zero and I never changed it so now I could try to do some math like I could just say color equals Mouse X like why not that's pretty good whatever the value of Mouse X is set the background color to that so let's see what happens I'm gonna run this look it's working it's changing but it's already white why because as soon as I get to pixel 255 that's the full whiteness so I'm not getting this perfect mapping it's kind of like working but it's not exactly right so I could be approximate I could say okay well let's the canvas is 600 pixels wide why don't I / that's pretty good 601 a sex is / that's getting me pretty close it actually kind of looks like it's working on that you know we kind of solved the problem but here's the thing this problem that we have just sort of barely solved over there this is a very simplistic view of it but there's lots of times where you have a sensor like data coming in from some sensor and the range is between you know 321 and 1,057 and then you want to map that range to some other set of values and actually that other set of values has a range between 20 and 35 and the math is a little bit trickier or perhaps you want to take a value that goes between 0 and 200 and invert that and map that between 200 down to 0 so there's lots of more complex scenarios the map function is a general function that will take any range and map a value inside that range to a new value in any other range so let's take a look how that works in this context so there's first of all what I mean by function so already you know about hopefully you know about calling functions in p5 right you might have done this line is a function that takes four arguments one two three four and what is it it draws a line from you know a point one hundred one hundred fifty fifty done so map it's the same thing it's a function that takes some amount of arguments it's actually going to be five arguments I better give myself more room here I can see that you're not gonna be able see this okay map it takes five arguments one two three four okay so this seems like oh boy five arguments that's terrifying but it's actually it's not so bad so remember I have a range that goes between zero and six hundred this is the range we know that Mouse X is and I want to map this range to arrange between 0 and 255 which is what I want to assign to my variable color so the arguments that map requires are the following what is the minimum and maximum of my current range 0 to 600 what is the minimum and maximum of my new range 0 to 255 and what is the value that has this range and which I want to map to the new range well in this case it's Mouse X so I want to map Mouse X which I know has this range that's the X values and I want to map it to this range between 0 to 55 for the purpose of color and then when I map it what do I do with it I want to take the result of that mapping and set it equal assign the result to my variable color so this is what's actually something quite new about this map function the line function doesn't do any it performs a task line it draws a line in the canvas it's well whatever you know the computer draws a line on the canvas the math function actually performs a calculation and answers a question it resolves to a single number so I can use that number and assign it back to this variable okay so this is kind of a new concept let's go try to do it in this program so right instead of my goofy like math here Mouse X divided by two what I want to do now is use that map function so I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna say map Mouse X which has a range between 0 and 600 oops I guess I better zoom back out and that give me a new value within a new range between 0 and 255 so here Mouse X between 0 and 600 give me a range in 0 to 255 and assign that to this variable color which I'm then going to use in background and watch this we can see all the way perfectly white at pixels 600 perfectly back black at pixel zero let's have a little more with this 5 is all relative of course let's give ourselves two more variables so I'm gonna make a variable R and B R for red B for blue and what I'm going to do is I'm going to set the red value equal to that mapping so you can see now right blue is that 255 red is that zero and red R is getting that mapping with Mouse X so as I move to the right I get more pink and purple all the way back more blue and here's something interesting I could do with map let's also map the blue value but instead of saying when the mouse is at 0 the blue is at 0 and the mouse is at 600 the blue is at 255 let's do the reverse let's say when the mouse is at 0 we have 255 blue and when the mouse is all the way on the other side we have 0 blue so we can also invert that range which is great that map will that for us and all the way we could see I give all the way red all the way blue it in the middle I've got red and blue together so you know and also by the way well you know if you're thinking of so you might take this exercise maybe add mouse Y to it try to map announce why there's all sorts of possible things you can do with this so hopefully that gives you a bit of a sense of the map function and that you found that useful possibly came to stop this oops okay I'm still live streaming YouTube let's see if anybody's there fourteen people okay so I'm waiting till the video the stream catches up to where I am in real time I'm gonna drink some water and then perhaps anybody have some comments if this is useful I guess what I'm gonna do in the next video I'm going to record something about the random function I think this is the thing in between when I record I like to I don't know act silly I guess but this is now I don't know recorded for posterity uh hey I don't know how I know you from github Yannick uh I don't know how to pronounce her name I'm embarrassed so you could type in the chat a phonetic version Joshua Davis hello Boff XP it's nice to have some people watching this is really terrible though that the chat is way behind where I am in realtime again I'm gonna have to fix I know I'm just keep repeating myself so anyone have any comments about that video questions yeah it's totally totally and because I'm going to I'm gonna record books I'm a record a new one about random stop the rent stop random know what that means John yeah Johnny in English okay thank you okay well okay so I think I'm just gonna get started cuz this is this this isn't really working as live interaction which is unfortunate I guess I could quit the stream and like reset the settings to try to get it more in sync but I think I'll just I'm gonna record more this afternoon and when I start another live stream oh look I can create this wave thing except it's very severely delayed hello in there okay it's okay everything's gonna be okay don't worry you're gonna make these videos and you won't go totally insane being in a room by yourself talking to yourself on YouTube or something all right great okay so I was trying to do finish these up before noon and so I'm gonna go onto the next one okay okay so I got to minimize this I look at my Twitter you guys can now see that too okay and I minimized that random okay so what do I want to do with random I don't know yet we will just have to figure it out you know what I'm going to do this I don't know I'm gonna do yet I'll figure it out okay uh you drink a little this coffee let me do a couple jumping jacks some of these and then I'm gonna get ready to press record make sure this video uh I should erase this Wow I know what I need to do I had a painting program you know I haven't been good at saving these let's see what this is but this might actually be it perfect okay so we'll do random with this I think could work yeah okay oh I forgot okay sorry I forgot to switch the camera okay here we go there we go here we go here we go and now record start over okay so if you just started learning programming you're using p5 GS you're living in the world typing you're thinking about colors I gotta start over and what I'm talkin about so you've come to this point where you've got some basics down you've got a canvas you're drawing some stuff got colors hopefully you also went outside enjoyed some sunshine at some point and now you're ready for something a little bit more so a good thing I think to sort of start playing around with when you're working with graphics and interaction and just trying to make things move and happen on the screen really what you need to eat is conditional logic and that's gonna be the topic of my next video but before I get to that something that will let you sprinkle on a little more excitement onto your p5 sketches is the function random you know so what does random do for you random will give you a random number so up until now we've most of the examples have done things like here's a color 255 comma 30 comma 60 and and in a lot of cases it's nice to pick from a particular color palette for whatever reason but perhaps you want a random color or you want to put a whole lot of circles randomly on the screen or if you think about the painting program that I started with in a couple videos ago maybe every time you click the mouse you're painting with a new random color every time you press a key and the background erases you've got a new random background so ah ah the camera turned off that's good because I hated what I was doing anyway so I got a start over which is just fine just fine by me hit stop the live stream has all of this in it this is quite ridiculous but it works okay uh okay let's start over and drink some water and press record if I press record I'll start recording okay so this is the last video I'm making in this or a little section about variables and you're limited in what you could do so far I've been playing around we've had that map function if you watched the previous video which was kind of an exciting moment now I'm gonna make something it to be honest we've just got a screen with some colors and shapes on it and eventually your creative energy will shine through it's video is gonna happen I swear so here we are this is the last video in this little section about variables in p5.js and before I go I'm not going anywhere because all I do is stay in this room and make videos before before I go on to the next topic which is conditional logic which will really unlock a lot of creative possibilities for you I want to give you one last tool that'll hopefully make things a little bit more exciting in your life and that is the random function so the random function so we we you and me together I've been doing a lot of stuff like this VAR x equals 50 this is well and good and because X is a variable and 50 is a perfectly fine number and I'm happy with my rectangle at pixel 50 but there might be a time where you want the whole point of doing this programming thing is to have systems of logic rules to generate behaviors and graphics and designs it's not really about like let me pick my five favorite numbers and set those variables for those numbers so there's a lot more to it but a first step in that direction so we could at least say here's the rule whenever my program runs the circle will appear at a random X location so instead of saying bar x equals 50 I could say something like var x equals random and random is a function just like any other function line ellipse fill stroke it acquire some arguments to define how that function will behave and random if you watch the previous video is just like the map function and if you recall or if you didn't watch it the difference is when you say line a line is drawn on the screen the line function performs the task when you say random a task is performed picking a random number but that function resolves to it evaluates to that number and you can take that number what it resolves to and assign it back to something a variable value in this case so if I say zero comma 50 I'm kind of at the edge of the semicolon there the parameters the arguments that random takes are a minimum and a maximum and random will give you a number in between zero and fifty one thing that's important here to realize which is a small little distinction is that here are some numbers you might get to 2170 look at 73 it's about 50 42 but I will mention you probably won't ever get these I mean we could get these numbers we're likely gonna get numbers like this right it's giving you actually what is sometimes referred to as floatingpoint numbers or decimal numbers so in this case it doesn't really matter p5 can handle that if you get the number 50 point three four five six seven it knows to just draw something at pixel 50 but there's other cases where we might need to do a little something more with that I probably shouldn't even mention this because it's like a little unnecessary point of confusion but I've already started recording this video like 5 times so I'm going for it okay so let's actually start messing around with this and see what happens okay so I have a sketch here actually I'm gonna start a new one I know I'm gonna say file new project and I'm gonna call this dots and what I would like to do is have some variables and I'm you know I'm gonna use objects since we learned about this I covered those in a previous video so I have a point and I'm also gonna have a color let's see how I'm doing here with my having just learned JavaScript syntax so you can see I'm setting up a couple variables I want to have a point that has an X and oo I my finger disappeared the point that has an x and a y I want to have a color with an R a G and a B because my plan for all this is first and setup obviously to create a canvas let's make it a nice small size and then in Drew and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna I'm gonna set a background I'm gonna set it in set up cuz I'm gonna just just backgrounds just happen once and then in the lips I'm going to draw the ellipse at point x comma point y it's gonna be a small lips and I'm gonna fill it at color are color dot G color dot B so I can zoom back out here and we can see we should be able to run this sketch now hit run okay problem with scope what happened look at this interesting ellipse is receiving an empty variable in spot number one two if this is not intentional color dot R color dot B I could put some semicolons here what did I miss RGB help help look at this what am I doing here Oh ellipse no it's ellipse it's got oh look some crazy stuff has happened here some horrible stuff this video is a disaster I'm gonna fix it I'm gonna cut this out if I remember to point comma X 100 Y is 50 point X point y oh it's alright let's let's do some things first when we have these kind of problems this is a useful point let's just comment out the offending lines of code it's save and hit run okay no errors anymore let's let's comment back in fill you can figure out what's going on still no errors let's draw an ellipse the oldfashioned way and let's see if this works okay that seems good now what's wrong with my point X and point y let's try this just point comma X let's run it again empty variable in spot one you know wonder if point let's call it spot if there's something wrong with using point yeah huh this interesting I'm gonna have to look into that so I don't know if point must be some keyword that's doing oh oh I've done something horrible boy wow this is great this is great okay I know what's happened I know what's happened this is great okay so so here's the thing what would I just do let's think of some functions in p5 I know I'm off on like this horrible tangent now for another five minutes but some functions in pi5 are like line a rectangle for drawing a rectangle ellipse for drawing an ellipse what if you want to draw a point on the screen huh well what's that function again point so point is like a kind of an important thing in p5 that's meant for something highly specific drawing a point so if I try to make up a variable called point I've completely overridden the existing point function and you know what I didn't actually override it because p5 then overrode my variable because things are happening in weird orders and strange ways so that didn't work he was trying to like use the point function as the place to draw the point and everything exploded I got a weird error message so that might be something that p5 could handle with a friendlier message and maybe after this video is over someone will file a github issue maybe that person will be me but let's go back and we solve it but hopefully you saw this the steps of debugging of like everything was like exploding and going wrong and just if you can't take a deep breath calm down convert some stuff out start putting it back in slowly see where things go wrong we've gotten a bit further but now we're back I'm back this video still only at 8 minutes which is totally reasonable and we're going to I'm going to go back and change this to spot and I'm gonna say spot X spot comma Y and I'm going to run it and you can see there we go I have the circle and I'm gonna move this over here being drawn excuse me I I'm like what this give me a little more space I have the circle being drawn at 100 comma 50 where the spot is with this particular color so what happens we start to add some randomness here so one thing I could do first remember draw looping over and over and over again so what if I just say spot x equals random between 0 and 600 this is another thing it's worth mentioning I want I have a random spot anywhere between 0 and the width of that canvas the width of that canvas is 600 so I could write the number 600 there there does happen to be a builtin variable in p5 that knows just dynamically what the width of the window is and this is useful to use because if I use that variable width here instead of typing 600 if I later change the size and create canvas I don't have to change it elsewhere in my code so I'm gonna do that and I'm also gonna say spot dot y is random 0 height so now let's run this program and look I just get spots all over the place spot spot spots all with a nice red color but perhaps what I want is to say color dot R equals random between like I'm gonna 100 and 255 color G is always zero color dot B is random between you know 101 90 I'm just picking like random arbitrary ranges here and now we might see look I've got a nice variation of random purplishpinkish DOS and I could even say add a little bit of alpha here and run this again and you can see I have a nice little like pointillist and you can actually one thing you're noticing here if you look really close there's a little black outlines because I didn't turn off the stroke so what I'm going to do now is say no stroke and stop and start and there they just look at this beautiful all these nice little dots layering there's a nice little pointillist thing so you could take this much farther you can make random sizes you can map the random ranges based on like where like if the dots appear on the left they're more greenish if they're on the right they're more blueish so there's so much you could do try to see maybe try to create a random painting here you could use other shapes besides just circles that sort of thing that sort of says an exercise you could try I also might return to this particular program if you remember this we worked on just a little bit of a painting program where you move the mouse around and as you move the mouse around you paint something and so what if you could every time you write now your time you click the mouse it erases the background what if you go every time you click the mouse you get a random background color or as you move the mouse the color changes randomly so there's lots of thinked interesting possibilities there it can make this painting program a bit more sophisticated ok so that is the end of this video and I think this wraps up my section of videos on variables and I'm gonna keep that weird little thing that that happened that I think was a good good moment for today ok see you later now I'm gonna go back to YouTube how do I get back to YouTube Here I am I think YouTube is recording it so it will be saved also I am recording the VIP like I am seperately recording the finished videos anybody have any feedback on that all you fourteen people watch it boy I mean not that I expect there would be more so I guess I'm gonna take a I'm kind of got some momentum here I think I'm gonna though I feel like this is this finishes up this section I'm gonna I'm gonna stop this broadcast so the um and but I have this idea of recording some videos about git and github which I might do at some point today but I need to work on uploading all this stuff so I'm gonna stop this session say goodbye to you lovely fourteen people who are watching thank you very much and I don't know that's it and then I'm gonna come back later today probably I'm kind of addicted to making these videos I have someone there some emails and some other stuff anybody have any other comments they want to add except you won't hear me say this for 30 seconds I'm waiting 30 seconds see what he has in the last comments I would see how far behind I am because if I clap how long shall I clap one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand four one thousand five one thousand six one thousand seven one thousand eight one thousand 1,010 1,011 1,012 1031 I'm is my clapping I do have a video on Perlin noise let me find it Perlin noise video Schiffman I have a bunch of them this bears are on Vimeo they're also on YouTube if you care here is the YouTube one so I will paste it here yeah I will yeah I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna always this now that this works I'm gonna always stream these recording sessions you know as long as people can stomach watching or though I guess you don't have to obviously and then I will I'll always just post a Twitter I guess when I'm doing that okay I gotta turn this off stream is ending signing off thank you
