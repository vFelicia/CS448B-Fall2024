00:00 - - Hello, welcome to a video that
at this present time doesn't exist,
00:07 - but when you are watching this video,
00:09 - right there, to the right of 9: Genetic Algorithms
00:13 - will be the number 10,
00:14 - and it will say next  to that, Neural Networks.
00:16 - So I am embarking on a journey
to learn about neural networks:
00:21 - what they are, how you program them,
00:24 - what's the kind of math
and stuff you need to know
00:27 - to make them work, and then what kinds of creative
00:30 - and experimental outcomes can you have.
00:34 - Now, it should be said that there are lots
00:38 - and lots of machine learning libraries out there.
00:41 - There are lots of examples
and resources for doing this.
00:45 - I want to--
00:47 - Hold on, I'm still talking.
00:49 - I don't know where--
Where did I put that book?
00:51 - Ah, it's over here.
00:53 - I want to reference this book,
00:55 - Make Your Own Neural Network by Tariq Rashid,
00:58 - which I used to develop a lot of the materials
01:01 - that I will be presenting to you
01:02 - and developing during this series of videos.
01:06 - And I should also say that, you know--
01:09 - And this book, this book has all sorts--
01:14 - has how to program your own neural network
01:16 - from scratch and without even knowing anything
01:18 - about programming in Python,
01:19 - because, as I might have said earlier today,
01:21 - any reasonable person would start
and make a video tutorial series
01:26 - about programming a neural network
from scratch in Python,
01:29 - but I don't really--
01:31 - I'm not very reasonable or logical,
01:33 - and I just constantly make mistakes with everything.
01:36 - And here's a mistake that I'm going to make.
01:38 - I'm going to do all this in JavaScript.
01:40 - And the reason for doing that
01:41 - is to have everything run in the browser,
01:44 - on the web, and also really for me
to learn about how to do this stuff.
01:47 - So I am going to build a set--
01:51 - I'm going to build a simple
neural network library in JavaScript,
01:55 - not to make something efficient,
not to make something robust,
01:59 - but to learn about the mechanics
of how all this stuff works,
02:03 - because, ultimately--
and you might want to
02:05 - just enjoy your summer, or maybe
you're watching this during the winter,
02:10 - and get outside and do something else
02:12 - and not watch these videos
and just skip ahead to later,
02:15 - because I'm going to do a bunch
of coding challenges and projects
02:18 - that involve that neural network library
and also other neural network libraries,
02:23 - namely something called TensorFlow, in future videos.
02:27 - But these first videos of building
the neural network library,
02:30 - which I will do over a series,
02:33 - really just for me to learn
how to do this stuff.
02:35 - And if you want to watch and sort of
02:37 - give me some good feedback
and see if you can follow along
02:40 - and improve on what I'm doing
02:42 - and help me with it,
that would be great.
02:44 - So, okay, what-- what--
02:47 - Hello, am I just rambling here?
02:49 - I am. But why are we here?
02:51 - So I'm going to go--
02:54 - So the Nature of Code materials in this video
02:56 - sits in the Nature of Code playlist
02:58 - is all about looking at things in nature,
03:02 - in our physical world,
03:04 - and trying to unpack those things
03:06 - and understand the algorithms behind those things,
03:08 - and see if we can convert those things,
03:10 - those algorithms, into code--
03:11 - Ah, this is like going--
it's like autoplaying. (laughs)
03:15 - How do I stop that?
03:17 - ..and turning those things into software
to make animations and creative projects.
03:25 - Why not look at something really
interesting in nature: the brain?
03:31 - So this is kind of a loose diagram of this idea
03:34 - of an actual biological neural network.
03:37 - Apparently, I have one here--
03:40 - I'm struggling quite a bit these days--
03:43 - where there are these entities called neurons,
03:46 - and they're connected to other neurons.
03:47 - And there's a lot of, you know, mystery to this
03:50 - and a lot of recent research [inaudible] neuroscience.
03:54 - What I am focused on in this series of videos
03:58 - is what kinds of computational systems can be built,
04:02 - inspired by the actual biological neural network,
04:06 - biological brain, and made into something
04:09 - called an artificial neural network?
04:12 - And what kinds of applications
and outcomes can we create?
04:17 - So what is the analog?
04:19 - What is the neuron in our code?
04:23 - How does it receive inputs?
How does it generate outputs?
04:28 - So my brain does this.
04:29 - It receives all these inputs
from light in the room
04:32 - that travel through my retina
and into the brain and the signals
04:35 - then produce outputs that allow me
to catch something or read some words.
04:40 - How can that process be simulated in software?
04:44 - And what types of outcomes can we generate?
04:47 - And the very first thing that I'm going to do
04:50 - is look at the simplest possible neural network,
04:55 - a net--
It's not even a network at all.
04:57 - It has one neuron, a processor neuron,
05:00 - that receives two inputs and generates an output.
05:03 - And that's called a perceptron.
05:05 - So if you look at the next videos in this playlist,
05:07 - I am going to build, in Processing,
05:10 - a perceptron example just to show the mechanics
05:14 - of how this works and to produce some trivial example
05:17 - that doesn't necessarily have a very powerful outcome,
05:20 - but gives us--
Because if we can build
05:22 - and understand how this single neuron
05:24 - receives inputs, processes those,
and generates an output,
05:28 - then we can start to connect those together
05:32 - to create more sophisticated systems
05:34 - that can begin to generate outputs based on--
05:38 - more complex outputs based on more complex inputs.
05:40 - And this is kind of--
05:42 - sits right there in the world of machine learning,
05:46 - this idea of I have some data
that I want to make sense of.
05:50 - That data is an input to a machine learning algorithm.
05:53 - That algorithm is going to generate an output.
05:56 - So maybe the data is an image.
05:58 - The machine learning algorithm
is going to guess is it a cat or a dog?
06:01 - Or maybe that input is the specs of the house,
06:04 - you know, square footage, number of bedrooms,
06:08 - etc., etc., and this machine learning system
06:11 - is going to generate an output: a predicted price.
06:13 - So there are lots of other machine learning algorithms
06:16 - besides just neural network based ones,
06:19 - and I do have another videos series
that cover some of those,
06:22 - but ultimately I want to learn
how a neural network works,
06:25 - so I can place it right there
and start to make sense of data,
06:29 - and generate outputs from it.
06:30 - So if you want to continue along,
06:32 - the way this video series will work,
06:35 - first there'll be a perceptron,
which is this thing.
06:38 - Then I'm going to talk--
after the perceptron's done,
06:41 - I'm going to talk about what the limitations
06:42 - of the perceptrons are and why it is
06:45 - that if we can create a multi-layered perceptron,
06:48 - meaning many of these perceptrons
all connected to each other,
06:51 - what we can start to build
and create afterwards.
06:54 - So that's my rambling introduction
06:57 - that apparently you just watched,
07:00 - because-- I mean, maybe
no one will ever watch this,
07:04 - but probably somebody will.
07:06 - And I'll see you. Follow along.
07:08 - I look forward to your feedback.
I hope this goes okay.
07:12 - That's a pretty good goal.
Just okay is fine.
07:15 - And I'll see you in these
future videos as I keep going.
07:17 - Thanks for watching.
07:19 - (upbeat music)
