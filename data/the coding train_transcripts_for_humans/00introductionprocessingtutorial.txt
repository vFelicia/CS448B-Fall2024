00:05 - Hello!
00:09 - Aaaawk, so awkward
00:10 - because it's very hard to begin these things but we're just gonna go right in
00:13 - and we're going to begin
00:15 - Hello my name is Dan. Perhaps you watched a video that I’ve been in before or perhaps you haven’t
00:19 - I don't know how you got here but you're here, I'm here, you're here,
00:23 - we're here together, there's a wall here, I can write on it
00:26 - there’s gonna be a computer over there. why are we here?
00:29 - Have you ever wanted to learn programming? have you never even tried to learn programming?
00:35 - have you never written a line of code
00:37 - before in your life? you have no idea what it means
00:39 - to program to write code to create your own software?
00:43 - do you want to break free from the bonds
00:45 - of the tools that other people have made for you?
00:49 - do you want to write your own, to build your own software?
00:51 - make your own things from scratch
00:53 - on the computer? If so …
00:55 - this sounds like a sales pitch but really there's nothing to sell here, you could just leave
01:00 - at any moment
01:01 - but if so you're in the right place! this is a video series
01:05 - that is going to teach you how to program
01:08 - your computer. Now how, what kinds of, what programming language you use,
01:14 - what environment you use,
01:14 - what it is you want to make, is a huge giant [Rhwaah]
01:17 - mess of stuff. We're gonna do things in a simple way,
01:22 - I'm gonna talk a lot more about this something called Processing, I'm just going to talk
01:26 - to you
01:27 - I'm going to draw diagrams, I will demonstrate for you
01:30 - code examples on this computer over here
01:33 - it's all going to be in video. now
01:36 - you might have some questions like: oh, I get it, I heard about these things
01:41 - kinda like a MOOC, I don't know how to pronounce it, is this a MOOC?
01:45 - it's not a MOOC, could be a MOOC, you could make it a MOOC
01:49 - but MOOCs are a little bit scary. this is just some videos
01:53 - to help you learn. I hope you might find, you might do this on your own
01:57 - you might use these in the conference, to supplement a class you're taking
02:00 - you might be a teacher of some other people and want to use these videos in
02:04 - your course
02:05 - I don't know but I would like them to be helpful however you think
02:09 - they might be helpful! so the other thing you might ask is
02:13 - this seems a little weird just talking and drawing diagrams. you know I hear about all these
02:17 - new fancy interactive online learning
02:20 - test quizzing and I can … You know that those things are great
02:23 - and I would like to ultimately incorporate
02:26 - some stuff where you could easily look at the code while I'm
02:30 - demonstrating it, trying things out. the Khan Academy is doing some fantastic stuff
02:35 - John Resig and
02:36 - the CS courses, I highly recommend them, they’re doing a lot of similar stuff
02:39 - I'm just kinda doing what I know which is drawing to a whiteboard
02:43 - and using this computing machine
02:47 - to type out examples. they will all be available for you to download
02:51 - there's even a book that I will hesitate to show you that you could use to follow
02:55 - along
02:56 - I'm also going to do some live
02:59 - online live events where I am
03:03 - gonna take calls and answers questions which is another …
03:06 - I kinda digress here but that's gonna happen too so
03:09 - that's really, I made some notes over here and I
03:13 - this is a so far I’ve only been talking for three minutes, this is my intro video
03:16 - but so if you really just want to get into the meat of the stuff you can skip ahead
03:21 - I don't know, I will link to it, I don't know the video number yet
0:03:24.826,1193:02:47.295
cause I haven't made it yet
03:25 - but there's a video you can just jump to which is hey
03:28 - let's start, let’s write our first line of code, let's see how everything works
03:31 - but I'm going to have a few more videos just kinda talk
03:35 - a little more about who I am, what I imagine you might use this for,
03:38 - what is programming in perhaps a kind of general question, what our programming
03:41 - languages is, what you might use that I'm using, why am I using this one versus that one
03:45 - wooo … everything's gonna be okay, I think so
03:48 - so I'm just gonna have a few more introductory videos, I’ll show you I hopefully
03:52 - make one where I’ll
03:53 - show you a bunch of your project that are kinda that you might think of as
03:57 - possible outcomes or that relate to the kinds of things were going to be doing
04:00 - in this
04:00 - a video series so there's a bunch more intro videos that i'm gonna make, they’ll be
04:01 - short five-minute videos that you can watch, but at any point
04:07 - you could just stopped completely and go out, you know chess is a fun game
04:12 - uhm, I don't know
04:15 - put a basketball is nice, music, learning to play the violin
04:19 - I did that for a while, it was very enjoyable because it's something else
04:23 - or if or you can jump ahead, argh, this turned off
04:26 - I have a
04:30 - camera turning off problem, or you could jump ahead and kinda get to the point
04:33 - where you think you’re ready to go to
04:35 - okay hopefully it's going to be fine that’s the end of this video
