00:01 - hi so what I want to look at in this
00:02 - video is two other elements that you can
00:05 - add to a page for additional
00:06 - interactivity so uh the previous video I
00:09 - started talking about this idea of a
00:10 - call back you have a button and you
00:13 - attach a function to that
00:16 - button and the code is executed only
00:19 - when you click on the button via uh the
00:22 - mous Pressed event call back so let's
00:24 - look at two other pieces of of two other
00:26 - interactive elements you can add to the
00:28 - page and how what other events might be
00:30 - associated with those elements and some
00:32 - other things you might be able to do
00:33 - that'll just make things more
00:34 - interesting for you
00:36 - so hopefully I'm not going to like knock
00:39 - this light over and start a fire and
00:41 - there was a siren earlier and you know
00:43 - the fire department will come but
00:45 - everything's okay still for right now
00:46 - okay so the two elements are let's start
00:48 - with a
00:49 - slider so a slider is something that
00:51 - looks like this my beautiful drawing of
00:53 - a slider you can slide this value slide
00:56 - this little dot back and forth and
00:58 - hopefully control something on the page
01:00 - making something larger making something
01:02 - smaller making something more blue less
01:03 - blue how does that work so the P5
01:06 - function for adding a slider to a page
01:09 - this is create
01:12 - slider
01:14 - now there's a few things to mention
01:16 - about this number one this is the
01:20 - default HTML slider element so it's what
01:24 - you get for free in the browser a
01:25 - slider's just there if you want to have
01:28 - your own kind of slider that looks
01:29 - custom if you want to make your slider
01:31 - along a sine wave there's all sorts of
01:33 - crazy things you can do in canvas and
01:34 - drawing and we've sort of seen that but
01:36 - right now we just going to work with the
01:37 - default slider you get for free the
01:39 - other thing I want to mention is you can
01:41 - of course add the slider by writing the
01:44 - HTML tags into the htl source itself and
01:47 - there might be good reasons for doing
01:48 - that but for Simplicity right now I'm
01:50 - kind of focusing on JavaScript and I
01:51 - want to just add the slider using Create
01:53 - slider just like I said create button
01:56 - now what does a slider need a slider
01:59 - needs three three values to start it
02:01 - needs a minimum what is the value that
02:04 - the slider should output when it SL when
02:07 - you slide all the way to the left what
02:10 - is the maximum when you slide all the
02:12 - way to the right and what is what I
02:14 - would say the starting
02:16 - value so let's say that I want to use
02:19 - the slider to control the size of a
02:22 - circle and I want the circle size to be
02:24 - between 10 and 100 and I want it to
02:27 - start at 47 so create slider with a
02:31 - minimum with a maximum and with a
02:35 - starting value so let's add that to the
02:39 - page I'm going to come over here and um
02:42 - we can see I already have a button and
02:44 - now I'm going to add a slider create
02:46 - slider with a minimum a maximum and a
02:51 - starting value so we should see now that
02:54 - there is also a slider on the Page by
02:56 - the way one thing I did which is kind of
02:58 - silly is was bothered me that the button
03:00 - was showing up to the right of the
03:02 - canvas later I will show you all sorts
03:05 - of other ways through CSS and styling to
03:07 - control the layout of the page but right
03:11 - now uh as a quick sort of trick is I
03:14 - just added a parag an empty paragraph
03:16 - between the canvas and the button and
03:18 - you can see how I did that in the code
03:19 - right here so I made the canvas I made
03:22 - an empty paragraph and then I put the
03:24 - button you can see the slider is showing
03:25 - up to the right of the button if I added
03:27 - another empty paragraph it would show up
03:28 - below you know whether it was that's a
03:30 - good idea or a bad idea I'm sure lots of
03:32 - people will tell me that that was a
03:33 - terrible idea but you know what it works
03:35 - it's fine okay so now the slider is
03:38 - there I can move it around nothing is
03:40 - happening but you notice also I could
03:42 - change this like if I say the starting
03:44 - value is five you can see look the
03:46 - slider position started over here if I
03:49 - say the starting value is
03:51 - 86 the
03:53 - slider position starts over here so you
03:56 - can control that starting value by uh
03:59 - changing the number hard-coded in the
04:01 - code so how do you get the value out of
04:04 - the slider and the way that you get the
04:06 - value out of the slider is a function
04:08 - called value so this is another function
04:12 - that we're adding that I'm that that I'm
04:14 - this is another function that I'm
04:15 - telling you about that is part of HTML
04:17 - elements so far we've only seen
04:20 - position which absolute position is an
04:23 - element on the page I've shown you HTML
04:26 - the HTML function which changes the
04:28 - content of the element what's the text
04:29 - in the element and now you're seeing
04:31 - another one value which pulls out the
04:33 - value now value is not necessarily
04:35 - relevant for a lot of other uh for for
04:38 - all elements but s value is relevant for
04:41 - a slider because you need to know the
04:42 - current value of the
04:44 - slider so let's say where where might I
04:47 - use this ah so first of all what did I
04:50 - forget I just made the slider but if I
04:53 - want to pull the value if I want to
04:54 - position it change its content pull out
04:56 - the value I need a variable to call that
04:58 - function on so I need to add a variable
05:01 - slider here then I can say slider equals
05:04 - create slider and now anywhere in the
05:06 - code I could access its value so I want
05:09 - to change this to a
05:11 - circle and you can see there's a circle
05:13 - and I'm going to say slider.
05:17 - value in here in slider. val now you
05:21 - might ask the question is don't I want
05:24 - an event like I want to have an event
05:27 - fire I want to handle the event anytime
05:30 - the user moves the slider and this is
05:32 - something you actually can do and I I'll
05:34 - show that to you hopefully in this video
05:36 - in a little bit later but I've done a
05:37 - little bit of a trick here remember draw
05:39 - this animation Loop is just cycling over
05:42 - and over again draw draw draw loop loop
05:44 - loop so what I can do instead of
05:45 - handling the event I could just say
05:47 - while I'm drawing that Circle every time
05:49 - I draw the circle access the value of
05:52 - the slider for the size of the circle
05:53 - and you can see here now that I move the
05:55 - slider you can see the the size of that
05:58 - circle is changing so this is yet
06:00 - another thing you can add to your code
06:02 - you can have a button here now I have a
06:05 - button that handles an event I have a
06:08 - slider where I'm pulling the value
06:10 - continuously and draw and so I'm
06:12 - essentially building a little interface
06:13 - to control the canvas so this is kind of
06:16 - what I think you can start doing now if
06:18 - you've learned a bit about programming
06:20 - and you're making these little pictures
06:21 - the animations what might you get out of
06:23 - building a simple interface controlling
06:25 - things in the code with a button
06:26 - controlling things in the code with a
06:28 - slider and even more so let's look at
06:30 - one more
06:32 - element a text input
06:36 - field and this is where I'm going to get
06:38 - to some other
06:40 - events which I think are useful to see
06:43 - uh I'm erasing all
06:46 - this so a text input field is a box
06:50 - where a user can type in text like their
06:53 - name so you might say like
06:55 - Name
06:57 - colon an empty Fields so how would you
07:01 - how do you get this on the page create
07:06 - input the create input function creates
07:09 - a text input field on the page so let's
07:12 - add
07:14 - that over here I'm going to add that
07:16 - under slider and you know what I'm going
07:18 - to just be smarter about this and just
07:21 - add a variable input equals create input
07:25 - now let's put something in here in the
07:27 - quotes here name type your name let's
07:31 - run that and see what
07:32 - happens now notice interestingly enough
07:36 - I can populate that text input field in
07:39 - advance by passing an argument to the
07:42 - create input function so whatever right
07:44 - and this is this is sort of a a key
07:46 - piece of information here I'm having
07:48 - trouble with my layout of my window here
07:50 - but you can see that creating different
07:52 - elements requires different arguments a
07:55 - button the text goes inside the button a
07:58 - slider needs a minimum maximum starting
08:00 - value a text input field needs text to
08:03 - start in that input field if I wanted it
08:04 - to be blank I could just take this out
08:08 - and start it with an empty string and
08:10 - you can see that text input field is
08:11 - blank but I'll give it like you know I'm
08:13 - going to write test name you know I'll
08:15 - put that type your name back in here and
08:17 - you can see there it is so
08:19 - now how do I get what the current text
08:23 - is in that box um how do I get that into
08:28 - um How do I access that well guess
08:32 - what I erased it but I wrote down here
08:35 - before the value function the value
08:37 - function pulls out the current value of
08:40 - the slider the numeric value of where
08:42 - the slider is the value function pulls
08:45 - out the current value also of a text
08:47 - input box so this is a sort of important
08:50 - function if I have a an element a text
08:53 - input field a slider and I want to know
08:55 - its current value this P5 Dom Library
08:58 - function value will give me access to
09:00 - that so I can do something like uh here
09:04 - in canvas there is a text function I'm
09:07 - going to say text uh uh let's just test
09:11 - that this works hello uh 10 comma 20 and
09:16 - I'm going to run this and you can see
09:18 - there it is the word hello is on the
09:20 - canvas but now what if I were to say
09:24 - instead input. value so just like I'm
09:28 - using the slide 's value to draw a to
09:31 - set the size of a circle I'm going use
09:33 - the text inputs value to set text that
09:35 - I'm drawing on the
09:38 - canvas so look at this oh look at this
09:40 - it says type your name and now here
09:43 - Daniel schiffman wow this is amazing
09:48 - whatever I type so this is pretty great
09:51 - so you can dynamically access what's in
09:54 - the box through the value function and
09:56 - control to the canvas now I think we
09:58 - better I think we should do something
09:59 - different here so this is great you can
10:01 - see how the all three of these elements
10:03 - work a button click on the button make
10:05 - an event happen click on the slider use
10:08 - the variable use the value of the slider
10:10 - in a variable to control something in
10:12 - the code Type some stuff here change
10:14 - what appears on this in the canvas but I
10:17 - want to do something different what I
10:19 - want to do now is I'm going to go back
10:22 - to this paragraph element and I'm going
10:24 - to say D um your
10:27 - name now look at this this what I want
10:30 - to see is when I'm typing here when I
10:33 - hit
10:34 - enter I want to
10:36 - see that the sorry this paragraph
10:39 - changed to my name okay so what I want
10:42 - to do is not just control something in
10:44 - the canvas I want to control another
10:46 - HTML element from and I'm I'm kind of
10:48 - gone to M my 10-minute Mark here but
10:50 - maybe you're still watching I want to
10:52 - control another element uh uh from from
10:56 - that text input field so let's think
10:58 - about how that works
11:00 - so a quick way that I could do it um
11:03 - sorry we've we've already sort of seen
11:06 - this so let me just come back here and
11:08 - say uh name p and I'm going to say this
11:11 - is name p and in draw I could say
11:16 - name p. HTML input. Val so this is right
11:23 - here right this text function draws text
11:26 - to the canvas this HTML function changes
11:28 - the text of an HTML element to that
11:30 - value so now if I run this you can see
11:34 - here that you know whatever I type here
11:37 - changes in this element but I'm actually
11:40 - only
11:41 - using the uh the fact that draw is
11:44 - looping so actually I think I'm going to
11:46 - stop this and do a I'm going to just
11:48 - continue this discussion in the next
11:50 - video because I think we could look at
11:51 - the difference between um how some of
11:53 - these other events are handled uh we
11:56 - look at a selection of other events um
11:59 - and so I'm going to do that in the next
12:00 - video um but uh uh if so if you're if
12:03 - you're watching this video and stopping
12:04 - here right now what I might suggest that
12:06 - you do is try adding a slider a bunch of
12:09 - Sliders try adding a text field see can
12:12 - you make the can you make the the this
12:14 - text update in the canvas only when you
12:16 - click like a submit button so how what
12:18 - kind of interplay can you have between
12:20 - buttons sliders text fields and Dom
12:23 - elements and in the next video I want to
12:25 - look at other events besides just Mouse
12:27 - press that might be associated with
12:29 - these uh elements okay I'm going to hit
12:32 - uh stop

Cleaned transcript:

hi so what I want to look at in this video is two other elements that you can add to a page for additional interactivity so uh the previous video I started talking about this idea of a call back you have a button and you attach a function to that button and the code is executed only when you click on the button via uh the mous Pressed event call back so let's look at two other pieces of of two other interactive elements you can add to the page and how what other events might be associated with those elements and some other things you might be able to do that'll just make things more interesting for you so hopefully I'm not going to like knock this light over and start a fire and there was a siren earlier and you know the fire department will come but everything's okay still for right now okay so the two elements are let's start with a slider so a slider is something that looks like this my beautiful drawing of a slider you can slide this value slide this little dot back and forth and hopefully control something on the page making something larger making something smaller making something more blue less blue how does that work so the P5 function for adding a slider to a page this is create slider now there's a few things to mention about this number one this is the default HTML slider element so it's what you get for free in the browser a slider's just there if you want to have your own kind of slider that looks custom if you want to make your slider along a sine wave there's all sorts of crazy things you can do in canvas and drawing and we've sort of seen that but right now we just going to work with the default slider you get for free the other thing I want to mention is you can of course add the slider by writing the HTML tags into the htl source itself and there might be good reasons for doing that but for Simplicity right now I'm kind of focusing on JavaScript and I want to just add the slider using Create slider just like I said create button now what does a slider need a slider needs three three values to start it needs a minimum what is the value that the slider should output when it SL when you slide all the way to the left what is the maximum when you slide all the way to the right and what is what I would say the starting value so let's say that I want to use the slider to control the size of a circle and I want the circle size to be between 10 and 100 and I want it to start at 47 so create slider with a minimum with a maximum and with a starting value so let's add that to the page I'm going to come over here and um we can see I already have a button and now I'm going to add a slider create slider with a minimum a maximum and a starting value so we should see now that there is also a slider on the Page by the way one thing I did which is kind of silly is was bothered me that the button was showing up to the right of the canvas later I will show you all sorts of other ways through CSS and styling to control the layout of the page but right now uh as a quick sort of trick is I just added a parag an empty paragraph between the canvas and the button and you can see how I did that in the code right here so I made the canvas I made an empty paragraph and then I put the button you can see the slider is showing up to the right of the button if I added another empty paragraph it would show up below you know whether it was that's a good idea or a bad idea I'm sure lots of people will tell me that that was a terrible idea but you know what it works it's fine okay so now the slider is there I can move it around nothing is happening but you notice also I could change this like if I say the starting value is five you can see look the slider position started over here if I say the starting value is 86 the slider position starts over here so you can control that starting value by uh changing the number hardcoded in the code so how do you get the value out of the slider and the way that you get the value out of the slider is a function called value so this is another function that we're adding that I'm that that I'm this is another function that I'm telling you about that is part of HTML elements so far we've only seen position which absolute position is an element on the page I've shown you HTML the HTML function which changes the content of the element what's the text in the element and now you're seeing another one value which pulls out the value now value is not necessarily relevant for a lot of other uh for for all elements but s value is relevant for a slider because you need to know the current value of the slider so let's say where where might I use this ah so first of all what did I forget I just made the slider but if I want to pull the value if I want to position it change its content pull out the value I need a variable to call that function on so I need to add a variable slider here then I can say slider equals create slider and now anywhere in the code I could access its value so I want to change this to a circle and you can see there's a circle and I'm going to say slider. value in here in slider. val now you might ask the question is don't I want an event like I want to have an event fire I want to handle the event anytime the user moves the slider and this is something you actually can do and I I'll show that to you hopefully in this video in a little bit later but I've done a little bit of a trick here remember draw this animation Loop is just cycling over and over again draw draw draw loop loop loop so what I can do instead of handling the event I could just say while I'm drawing that Circle every time I draw the circle access the value of the slider for the size of the circle and you can see here now that I move the slider you can see the the size of that circle is changing so this is yet another thing you can add to your code you can have a button here now I have a button that handles an event I have a slider where I'm pulling the value continuously and draw and so I'm essentially building a little interface to control the canvas so this is kind of what I think you can start doing now if you've learned a bit about programming and you're making these little pictures the animations what might you get out of building a simple interface controlling things in the code with a button controlling things in the code with a slider and even more so let's look at one more element a text input field and this is where I'm going to get to some other events which I think are useful to see uh I'm erasing all this so a text input field is a box where a user can type in text like their name so you might say like Name colon an empty Fields so how would you how do you get this on the page create input the create input function creates a text input field on the page so let's add that over here I'm going to add that under slider and you know what I'm going to just be smarter about this and just add a variable input equals create input now let's put something in here in the quotes here name type your name let's run that and see what happens now notice interestingly enough I can populate that text input field in advance by passing an argument to the create input function so whatever right and this is this is sort of a a key piece of information here I'm having trouble with my layout of my window here but you can see that creating different elements requires different arguments a button the text goes inside the button a slider needs a minimum maximum starting value a text input field needs text to start in that input field if I wanted it to be blank I could just take this out and start it with an empty string and you can see that text input field is blank but I'll give it like you know I'm going to write test name you know I'll put that type your name back in here and you can see there it is so now how do I get what the current text is in that box um how do I get that into um How do I access that well guess what I erased it but I wrote down here before the value function the value function pulls out the current value of the slider the numeric value of where the slider is the value function pulls out the current value also of a text input box so this is a sort of important function if I have a an element a text input field a slider and I want to know its current value this P5 Dom Library function value will give me access to that so I can do something like uh here in canvas there is a text function I'm going to say text uh uh let's just test that this works hello uh 10 comma 20 and I'm going to run this and you can see there it is the word hello is on the canvas but now what if I were to say instead input. value so just like I'm using the slide 's value to draw a to set the size of a circle I'm going use the text inputs value to set text that I'm drawing on the canvas so look at this oh look at this it says type your name and now here Daniel schiffman wow this is amazing whatever I type so this is pretty great so you can dynamically access what's in the box through the value function and control to the canvas now I think we better I think we should do something different here so this is great you can see how the all three of these elements work a button click on the button make an event happen click on the slider use the variable use the value of the slider in a variable to control something in the code Type some stuff here change what appears on this in the canvas but I want to do something different what I want to do now is I'm going to go back to this paragraph element and I'm going to say D um your name now look at this this what I want to see is when I'm typing here when I hit enter I want to see that the sorry this paragraph changed to my name okay so what I want to do is not just control something in the canvas I want to control another HTML element from and I'm I'm kind of gone to M my 10minute Mark here but maybe you're still watching I want to control another element uh uh from from that text input field so let's think about how that works so a quick way that I could do it um sorry we've we've already sort of seen this so let me just come back here and say uh name p and I'm going to say this is name p and in draw I could say name p. HTML input. Val so this is right here right this text function draws text to the canvas this HTML function changes the text of an HTML element to that value so now if I run this you can see here that you know whatever I type here changes in this element but I'm actually only using the uh the fact that draw is looping so actually I think I'm going to stop this and do a I'm going to just continue this discussion in the next video because I think we could look at the difference between um how some of these other events are handled uh we look at a selection of other events um and so I'm going to do that in the next video um but uh uh if so if you're if you're watching this video and stopping here right now what I might suggest that you do is try adding a slider a bunch of Sliders try adding a text field see can you make the can you make the the this text update in the canvas only when you click like a submit button so how what kind of interplay can you have between buttons sliders text fields and Dom elements and in the next video I want to look at other events besides just Mouse press that might be associated with these uh elements okay I'm going to hit uh stop
