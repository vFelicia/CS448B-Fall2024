00:00 - okay so this video I'm kind of sneaking
00:03 - in it's like a huge topic and so
00:06 - particularly excited about this one I
00:07 - think this is going to make if you're if
00:09 - you're kind of following along here this
00:10 - is going to majorly change the way you
00:12 - might approach building certain kind of
00:14 - quick sketches in JavaScript and in p5
00:17 - so let's take a look at the scenario
00:20 - it's like a little tight in a way it's
00:22 - like a small change I'm going to make to
00:24 - this particular sketch than the show you
00:26 - in a moment but it's a major leap
00:27 - forward conceptually in terms of how you
00:30 - think about and build sketches now this
00:32 - is certainly I'm a like way too much
00:34 - exposition here but this almost
00:36 - definitely needs many follow ups but
00:38 - let's see how far I get in this video
00:40 - and see what happens from there since
00:43 - I'm really just in a room talking myself
00:45 - but at some point I will hear from
00:47 - people who are watching this okay so
00:49 - let's look at this example so this is a
00:51 - variation of the bouncing ball sketch
00:53 - that I showed in a previous video I
00:55 - simplified it a little bit this is now a
00:57 - bubble it's an object it has just an X
01:01 - and a Y and then the program is modular
01:04 - monetized into two functions a move and
01:06 - a display function the move function
01:09 - adjust the x and a y by the random value
01:12 - and you can see here that it's kind of
01:14 - just like jittering randomly and then
01:16 - the display function down here just
01:17 - draws the circle so this is what we've
01:20 - got a bubble object and a move in a
01:21 - display function the leap forward that I
01:24 - want to make here is I want the code
01:26 - ultimately to not look like this in draw
01:30 - but I want it to look like this bubble
01:33 - move bubble dot display so right now
01:37 - this bubble is just some data it's just
01:40 - the XY location but I want to think of
01:43 - the bubble as a kind of more than just
01:45 - some data that bubble is an object that
01:48 - has an x and a y and it also has
01:50 - functionality it can know how to display
01:52 - itself you can know how to move itself
01:54 - and this will open up a lot of
01:55 - possibilities for example eventually
01:57 - we'll see how you might just release
01:59 - like a thousand of these bubble objects
02:01 - onto the screen all at once so how do we
02:04 - define the function how do we start how
02:06 - do we define this object so not only
02:08 - does it have a bubble X and a bubble Y
02:11 - but that this move
02:12 - function is somehow a part of the bubble
02:14 - object so let's I'm going to diagram
02:16 - some syntax here so okay so this is the
02:20 - syntax for the object VAR bubble equals
02:25 - open curly bracket close curly bracket X
02:29 - which is a filled aura it's really like
02:34 - a variable inside of the bubble object X
02:37 - :
02:38 - I think I was 200 comma Y : 150 and
02:44 - again an object contained in java script
02:47 - contains what's known as name value or
02:50 - sometimes referred to as key value pairs
02:52 - this is the name X this is the value 200
02:55 - and this really behaves just like a
02:58 - variable does it's kind of like this
02:59 - list of variables that's inside this
03:01 - other variable called bubble so the
03:03 - secret magic wonderful thing about
03:05 - javascript is that these don't have to
03:09 - just be values they can be functions so
03:12 - what would happen if I said okay here
03:15 - this name value pair is not named value
03:20 - it is name value but that value is a
03:21 - function so the name is display and the
03:24 - value is function so syntax is kind of
03:30 - hopefully when I type this out it will
03:32 - look a little neater than this but you
03:34 - can see name value name function so this
03:37 - looks different right normally we would
03:41 - say you know function display like this
03:46 - but here just like normally we would say
03:49 - var X instead of saying var X its X
03:52 - colon instead of saying function display
03:54 - its display colon function now sort of
03:58 - unfortunate truth is there's lots of
04:00 - other ways that you can write and define
04:02 - functions in JavaScript and some of
04:04 - those will come up later as well but for
04:06 - the moment now we're seeing one new way
04:08 - this bubble has an X and a Y and a
04:11 - display function so what happens that
04:15 - we've got to fill in the code here
04:16 - inside for this function I want to draw
04:19 - an ellipse the question is where do I
04:22 - want to draw that ellipse I want to
04:24 - at this X and this why did that by
04:29 - accident but I realized I'm sort of
04:30 - doing it on purpose
04:31 - so the we this is the one of the
04:32 - weirdest things it's going to take some
04:34 - time to get used to and hopefully some
04:37 - follow-up videos I make will clarify
04:39 - this new term I'm like having this like
04:44 - thing go in my brain because I'm saying
04:45 - this new term and the term is actually
04:47 - this like the word this that's what
04:49 - getting to so in order to refer back to
04:51 - this X and this why you can't say x and
04:54 - y here these X and y if there were an x
04:57 - and y here would be it would be looking
04:59 - for some global variables summer you
05:00 - need to in order to refer to the
05:02 - specific X that's part of this object
05:05 - this is a keyword that refers to this
05:08 - particular bubble so this dot X comma
05:12 - this dot Y and this is like one of the
05:14 - biggest gotchas so to speak in job
05:16 - scream it's so easy to forget and then
05:18 - you might have like 20 comma Tori so
05:20 - might be so easy to forget this kind of
05:22 - thing so now that you've said this
05:25 - bubble with an X and a Y and a display
05:27 - function which does this draws this
05:29 - ellipse head fits X abyss Y then we can
05:33 - start to write things like bubble dot
05:36 - display when you execute bubble dot
05:39 - display it's going to look up this
05:40 - function execute this code and look for
05:43 - the what these values are here in these
05:45 - particular variables okay so let's try
05:47 - to make that happen here hopefully I got
05:50 - this right so now I'm going to say a
05:53 - display function and actually I could
05:58 - just go and grab exactly this code that
06:00 - we had here I'm going to delete this and
06:04 - bring it up here and the difference now
06:07 - of course is that here I have an X which
06:10 - is 300 or Y just you under display which
06:12 - is a function which does all this right
06:14 - I'm inside the object so there's no
06:17 - reason for me to refer to the objects
06:19 - variable name all I could just say this
06:22 - this particular object that I'm inside
06:24 - right now then the next name value pair
06:28 - comma move which is also a function and
06:33 - I'm going to grab this code
06:37 - and again this dot X this Y this dot X
06:43 - this dot Y so now we see this entire
06:47 - object here the bubble object this is
06:50 - this is like now we have this thing this
06:53 - it's it's not it's like this collection
06:55 - of stuff it's data I could add colors to
06:57 - it I could add size so I could and other
06:59 - functions to it I have this bubble fun
07:03 - bubble object has both data and
07:05 - functionality so now here in draw I can
07:08 - say things like bubble move and bubble
07:10 - dot display now I wonder why display is
07:12 - syntax highlighted there it's not part
07:14 - of p5 it must be display must be some
07:17 - other keyword in JavaScript so I wonder
07:19 - if that's a little bit dangerous for me
07:20 - to use it but I think it'll be ok so
07:22 - let's run this program we have exactly
07:24 - the same program it works just fine and
07:28 - also uh this might also be actually I'm
07:32 - not going to do this next I'm not sure
07:33 - how the b5j has editor works so anyway
07:36 - you know I've actually never like this
07:38 - is like the first time I tried doing
07:40 - this object stuff in JavaScript in this
07:42 - way at least explaining it so I'm not
07:44 - sure how that was but this is just the
07:45 - first first step and so you know if you
07:49 - had to have a second one of these you'd
07:51 - still you'd have to essentially
07:52 - duplicate all this code so that might be
07:55 - something that you try right now
07:56 - actually try making an object like this
07:59 - like this particular one this bubble
08:01 - maybe you know copy this code and add a
08:04 - color to it add another function to it
08:07 - maybe a function that do something if it
08:09 - like reaches the edge of the screen or
08:11 - something although with this randomness
08:12 - it might take a while so see what else
08:14 - you can add to it see if you can make
08:16 - one program that has two objects in it
08:18 - and then at some point I'm going to make
08:21 - a video that's going to look at
08:22 - something called an array which allows
08:24 - you to have a list of variables and one
08:26 - thing you can do very convenient with
08:27 - the rise of a list of objects and
08:29 - there's more there's a lot more you to
08:31 - get to in terms of how these objects are
08:33 - made and stored but I'm rambling now so
08:35 - hopefully this helps a little bit and
08:36 - let me know what you think and I'm going
08:38 - to hit stop now
08:43 - I've really hitting stop this is
08:44 - actually a short video for such a big
08:46 - job

Cleaned transcript:

okay so this video I'm kind of sneaking in it's like a huge topic and so particularly excited about this one I think this is going to make if you're if you're kind of following along here this is going to majorly change the way you might approach building certain kind of quick sketches in JavaScript and in p5 so let's take a look at the scenario it's like a little tight in a way it's like a
