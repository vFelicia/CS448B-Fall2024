With timestamps:

00:01 - OK, here I am.
00:02 - So in this video, I'm going to
talk to you about code comments
00:06 - and how you can write
comments in your code
00:08 - for just you or your friend
and the human beings who
00:10 - are looking at your code to
read, or actually, to like
00:13 - quickly disable and re-enable
certain lines of code,
00:16 - all sorts of exciting things
you could do with code comments.
00:18 - I'm going to show you how to
do that in the p5 web editor,
00:21 - but this is a universal concept.
00:23 - Any programming
language or environment
00:24 - that you choose to
work in will have
00:26 - a feature of a way of
writing stuff in your code
00:29 - that is ignored by
the computer that's
00:31 - executing the instructions
and is just there for you
00:36 - to review if you like.
00:37 - Take a break for a
year and you come back
00:38 - and remind yourself
of something,
00:39 - so let's look at that.
00:41 - So anything that I write into
the p5 web editor with a slash
00:46 - slash, immediately,
that line becomes
00:50 - what's known as a comment.
00:52 - So let's look.
00:52 - Like what if I were
to write something--
00:55 - OK, so this is the green
rectangle in the center.
01:00 - So the idea of a code comment--
and you can see that it is
01:03 - highlighted, it is gray,
it does not have the syntax
01:06 - highlighting of the executed--
01:07 - this means that
when the computer
01:09 - is executing the instructions.
01:10 - And I never
explicitly said this,
01:12 - but it's important-- line
by line, one after another,
01:17 - it ignores this.
01:18 - That is just there for me
the human being to read.
01:21 - So this can be useful.
01:22 - If you were doing
a self-portrait,
01:25 - you might say, like, this is
where I'm worked on my nose.
01:28 - And this is where-- this is
the code for drawing my chin.
01:31 - And this is the code
for drawing my ears.
01:33 - And you don't even have
to do it as a sentence.
01:35 - So I could just say, like,
you know, red, red circle.
01:39 - You might also write a note
to yourself like later,
01:42 - I want to make this
circle animate.
01:45 - And actually, a convention
inserting this to write TODO,
01:47 - but that doesn't mean anything.
01:49 - But so, there's all
sorts of things you could
01:51 - write in the code comment.
01:52 - So I encourage you,
easier said than done,
01:55 - and I don't necessarily
follow my own advice,
01:57 - but I encourage you to get
in the habit of writing
02:00 - code comments.
02:00 - Your future self will thank you.
02:03 - It's certainly something
that as a teacher
02:05 - I try to do as much as
possible, because I want
02:07 - to explain the code in line
so people can-- looking at it,
02:10 - can follow what certain
pieces are doing.
02:12 - And typically, I put
the comment that's
02:14 - describing what's
happening after it.
02:17 - OK, so that's how
code comments work.
02:19 - But there's another
sort of neat trick
02:21 - to code comments that
I'm not mentioning.
02:24 - Before, when I was
showing you, what
02:26 - if I wanted to use
noStroke instead of stroke?
02:29 - What I actually did
was I deleted stroke,
02:32 - and then wrote
noStroke in there.
02:34 - And I was able to sort
of like undo my way back.
02:36 - But often, what I want to do--
and I'm going to do that right
02:39 - now--
02:40 - often what I want
to do is say like,
02:41 - let me quickly
disable the stroke.
02:44 - And then show you noStroke.
02:47 - So here I'm kind of
saving what I had before,
02:51 - because I might want
to re-enable it.
02:53 - And then, and adding
in something new.
02:56 - And then now, if I want
to put the stroke back,
02:58 - I can delete that and I
can delete the slash slash,
03:01 - and now the stroke is back.
03:03 - So and, I can even
do things like,
03:05 - I can like highlight
this whole section
03:07 - and I can say command
slash and the whole thing
03:10 - is like commented out.
03:11 - I could say command slash again,
and the whole thing comes back.
03:14 - So this is a really
just useful technique
03:16 - while you're working to kind
of speed up your workflow.
03:18 - You can kind of leave
some stuff in your code
03:20 - that you don't want to
see, but you might want
03:22 - to pull back, come back later.
03:23 - And you'll sort of figure
out how to manage this best.
03:26 - But the primary
reason for comments
03:28 - is to add things in your
code about what you're doing.
03:33 - And this could be
for teaching or could
03:35 - be notes to your future self.
03:37 - And I might say
that things that you
03:38 - might want to consider doing
is, you know, code, example,
03:43 - by Daniel Shiffman.
03:45 - You can do things like this.
03:46 - The Coding Train, maybe
you put like a URL in here.
03:50 - Like this is the kind of thing
maybe you have some information
03:53 - like, and it's what your license
is, like please share and use.
03:58 - You know, there's-- technically,
you can add a software license
04:01 - that's part of the comments.
04:02 - And I don't want to get too
far down that whole like just
04:04 - explain to people what
they can use it for,
04:06 - but this is the kind of
thing that you can also
04:08 - use code comments
for to put something
04:10 - at the top that's kind of
announcing what it is, credits.
04:14 - And usually, I would do
things like this code is based
04:18 - on everything I learned from
Lauren McCarthy and Cassie
04:27 - Tarakajian, creator
of the editor.
04:31 - You know, I would
really often like--
04:33 - I'm always crediting
where I got my-- or got--
04:36 - because much about coding is
finding examples and changing
04:39 - something in the example,
learning to code is doing that.
04:42 - And so I always like
to try to give credit.
04:44 - You know sometimes
they're saying,
04:44 - is there a legal
requirement to give credit?
04:46 - With p5, everything
is open source
04:48 - and licensed in such a way that
all the examples that you do
04:52 - are not required under any
legal anything to give credit.
04:56 - But it's nice to give
credit when you can.
04:58 - I always try to.
04:58 - And if I forget to, if you
see something I've made
05:00 - and I forgot to give
credit, please let me
05:02 - know so I can add it.
05:03 - OK.
05:05 - OK, there's some more stuff.
05:06 - There's other fancier
ways you can add comments,
05:08 - but I'm not going to
go into that right now.
05:11 - I'm just noticing in the chat.
05:12 - So you know, all in good time.
05:15 - I can't get to everything
in every video.
05:16 - So that's code comments.
05:19 - You are ready.
05:20 - If you are taking this
somehow as a course,
05:22 - this would kind of be the
end of the first module.
05:25 - You've learned a
little bit about what
05:27 - p5 is, what JavaScript is,
how to sign up for an editor
05:30 - account, how to draw
shapes, how to set colors,
05:34 - and how to read error
messages and add comments.
05:37 - So make a sketch,
save it, share it,
05:40 - share it with me in the
comments, share it on Twitter.
05:43 - Let's talk about ways that
we can share these things
05:46 - with each other
and I look forward
05:48 - to seeing what you make.
05:50 - And if you continue
watching this series,
05:53 - the next step that
is to come is going
05:55 - to show you about how to animate
the stuff and interact with it
05:58 - with the mouse.
05:59 - OK, I will see you soon, and
hope you enjoyed these videos.
