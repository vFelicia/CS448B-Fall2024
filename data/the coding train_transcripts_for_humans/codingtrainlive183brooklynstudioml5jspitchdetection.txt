With timestamps:

00:00 - I think I'm live but I don't actually
00:06 - know hello and welcome to the coding
00:11 - train oh I do have my whistle it's so
00:15 - nice to see you maybe you don't see me
00:17 - maybe I'm doing this hello thing and I'm
00:19 - just doing it to myself because I don't
00:21 - see anybody in the chat saying that they
00:24 - see me yet I do see open broadcast
00:26 - studio over here streaming I do see
00:28 - myself in a confidence monitor I feel
00:31 - confident today I have a confidence
00:32 - monitor I am new confident Dan oh you do
00:35 - see me yay oh that's interesting my
00:39 - stream dekha is not hooked up properly
00:42 - observer so I this new tool I have so
00:44 - many things to say I don't even know
00:45 - maybe you've never watched before you
00:46 - have no idea where you are I'm very very
00:49 - excitable there's like new notifications
00:53 - thing I just got like a message I was by
00:56 - the way if you tagged me now in slack a
00:58 - little message pops up on this screen
01:00 - that I have over here that's kind of
01:01 - cool
01:02 - I didn't do that on purpose it just
01:03 - happens but I have this like Elgato
01:06 - stream deck not a sponsor but could be a
01:09 - sponsor and supposedly when I press this
01:12 - button it's going to oh did worked
01:16 - dude in the attitude in the chat by the
01:22 - way this a little bit more volume okay
01:24 - okay this I can probably do this I can
01:28 - probably handle a little more volume a
01:31 - little bit afraid to turn it up because
01:33 - all signs point to being plenty yes
01:36 - Marcos it does work your message popped
01:39 - up here on the screen
01:41 - hmm all right a little more Vaughn I
01:44 - have it all the way up oh I know where I
01:48 - can turn it up I have by the way all new
01:49 - equipment new lights I really want to
01:52 - show you something this is what I'm the
01:53 - most proud of this hold on a second this
01:57 - is very I have to show you this I have
01:59 - this'll just take a second I don't have
02:01 - it set to like there we go
02:02 - what is this why it's on there okay here
02:04 - we go look at this I mean come on look
02:08 - at this green screen there's a little
02:12 - bit of shadowing but there
02:13 - these new lights coming from all sides
02:14 - very little shadowing you know I almost
02:17 - want to just do the whole livestream
02:18 - like this that's just too wonderful okay
02:25 - I better turn that back on though I
02:27 - think that's probably the best plan all
02:30 - right let's turn this back on chroma
02:32 - keying myself out is my slack in dark
02:36 - mode I have no idea um I don't think it
02:40 - is I just installed this III I don't
02:42 - even know where to begin
02:43 - this is I should have thought about what
02:45 - I was gonna do oh no now it does tell me
02:50 - my stream deck has come online and it
02:51 - tells me how many people are watching
02:52 - all right this is gonna shock you I have
02:54 - another button I could press I'm a
02:55 - little bit afraid to press it so this is
02:58 - what I really have not completed yet the
03:01 - other side first I don't know why this
03:02 - is so dark looks kind of dark I don't
03:05 - know what the quality is interesting
03:06 - thing is I have this camera on autofocus
03:08 - so I can walk up here and I could talk
03:11 - to you like this this is me streaming to
03:14 - you talking to you saying hello welcome
03:16 - to the coding training all of my facial
03:18 - imperfections please enjoy the gray in
03:21 - the beard all right that was weird but
03:31 - okay back I probably should set the
03:33 - focus to this whiteboard I do have
03:44 - smarter surfaces magnetic whiteboard
03:47 - wallpaper on the wall but it needs
03:55 - something called vinyl on over vinyl
03:58 - adhesive which I don't have so I'll be
04:01 - going to some hardware store ordering
04:04 - something then I will get that and then
04:10 - I'll be putting that on the wall so that
04:13 - I can do some white boarding I mean I
04:15 - can move this out of the way you can see
04:17 - the wall I mean I'm tempted to just
04:21 - start drawing on the wall because why
04:24 - not
04:25 - but I'm gonna put the white it's
04:26 - magnetic too so I can hang stuff up but
04:29 - for today I just have this rolling white
04:32 - board and I can do things like draw well
04:42 - this this this marker is terrible
04:47 - I can draw a kitty cat by the way can I
04:50 - just plug something I probably shouldn't
04:52 - do this oh I shouldn't reveal I
04:54 - shouldn't reveal but I have an Instagram
04:55 - you should follow it's on my Instagram I
04:57 - have new cats the cats evidence' gram
04:59 - right now there are four kittens living
05:01 - in my house two of them are about to be
05:03 - adopted so I will just have to but if
05:05 - you want to follow them on Instagram
05:06 - it's mango and goose those aren't there
05:09 - those are the middle names mango and
05:10 - goose this is what people tuned in for
05:12 - it right for me to talk about my cat
05:13 - cats the gram do remember how there was
05:20 - this thing on the internet called the
05:22 - coding train and you would learn how to
05:23 - code and there was this friendly person
05:25 - who would come and teach you concepts
05:27 - and you would make creative projects it
05:29 - went away and it came back and then
05:31 - there was just like a totally insane
05:33 - person showing you about their new
05:35 - white-walled enclosed room with no
05:38 - windows and very bright LEDs shining on
05:41 - me boof I hope you can hear me still I
05:44 - haven't even bothered to check the chat
05:45 - or anything uh I've seen how the chat
05:49 - says seeing Dan's facial hair in 1080p
05:52 - definitely made my day
05:53 - guess what if you thought that was good
05:55 - I I'm sure I could get this up to 4k
05:58 - suited because these cameras the new
06:00 - cameras I have do 4k I am NOT I don't
06:03 - believe I'm capturing 4k I'm certainly
06:05 - not live streaming in 4k maybe try
06:08 - looking at the camera a little more yeah
06:10 - needs to move so here's the problem
06:13 - everybody's telling me to move the
06:14 - lights to the ceiling I would like to
06:17 - say that I could do that
06:18 - there's a real problem this is me
06:21 - touching the ceiling it's a very low
06:24 - ceiling it's just like a couple feet
06:25 - above my head there is no grid it's this
06:30 - this is not an ideal space I might move
06:33 - all this equipment again because the
06:34 - lights should definitely be on the
06:35 - ceiling
06:37 - but my sound is good when your face
06:42 - isn't close to the camera that was weird
06:44 - I don't know what that means
06:47 - oh by the way I have this crazy like
06:48 - noise-canceling thing on so people were
06:50 - telling me that maybe this is too much
06:52 - let's just do a little debugging of that
06:54 - for a second just so you the larger
06:56 - audience can help me with this oh yeah
06:58 - you know it's really sad it's really sad
07:01 - I have something to announce I don't
07:04 - have any so it's a fight
07:05 - I can't let me see hold on maybe maybe
07:08 - just maybe uh three percent
07:11 - I've been charging this tablet which has
07:15 - my sound effects on it for like the last
07:17 - 45 minutes and it never came alive and
07:21 - it finally just came alive and it's at
07:22 - 3% so let me give it a couple more
07:24 - minutes and then we can have our music
07:26 - again I was gonna do a drum roll I don't
07:30 - know actually let's wait and see has it
07:31 - been 30 minutes yet I don't think these
07:33 - cameras are going to go to sleep
07:35 - I don't know that I've tested this I
07:37 - really don't think they're gonna go to
07:38 - sleep
07:39 - people're tell me to look at the camera
07:40 - more so I always have looked directly at
07:43 - the camera right now I'm looking
07:45 - directly at the camera I don't know if
07:46 - this is effective but actually what I do
07:48 - with this new setup I have these
07:50 - confidence monitors I find myself
07:52 - looking at those but maybe if I'm
07:54 - looking at the confidence monitor it
07:55 - doesn't really feel like I'm looking at
07:57 - you like if I would walk over here and
08:00 - say and unfortunately this is not on
08:02 - auto focus so you just have to live with
08:04 - my blurry face you know when you stream
08:13 - in a room by yourself it causes you to
08:15 - do strange things that you would never
08:16 - ordinarily do in front of other people
08:18 - or maybe that's just me most people
08:19 - would not do that
08:21 - strange things currently seven minutes
08:24 - your audio levels are consistently six
08:26 - to ten decibels too low alright so the
08:28 - wonderful thing is that I have a full
08:31 - focus right 4x4 audio interface which
08:35 - this lav mic is going into I need to do
08:37 - another sort of tour of this studio and
08:39 - explain all the equipment it's a lot of
08:41 - this it's the same principle but
08:42 - different stuff so I am going to come
08:46 - over here and I'm going to pump up the
08:47 - volume
08:49 - I'm gonna need Christian Slater for this
08:52 - but I think I can handle it okay I just
08:56 - pumped up the volume a little bit didn't
08:58 - do it scientifically I just turned a
09:00 - dial who doesn't even have any numbers
09:02 - to like tell me whether I'm in an 8 or 9
09:04 - or an 11 but I think it's there when
09:11 - you're at your desk it looks fine when
09:13 - you look at the confidence monitor when
09:14 - at the whiteboard is a little more
09:16 - jarring somehow that's interesting let's
09:18 - try that again
09:19 - tell me if the volume is better oh it's
09:21 - gonna talk to you about the noise
09:22 - canceling I have going on okay let's see
09:27 - so what you're saying to me is when I'm
09:30 - over here and I'm looking at the
09:33 - confidence monitor it's kind of jarring
09:36 - but if I look at you at the camera look
09:38 - at you I'm looking at you looking
09:45 - directly into the camera this feels more
09:46 - like we're friends we're here we're
09:49 - gonna code all that sort of stuff
09:50 - yes No so you tell me all right so um
09:57 - what's going on today so first of all
09:59 - this I don't this is not I would say
10:01 - this is this is not the season premiere
10:03 - I feel like I might need to go to a
10:04 - seasons model because my life is
10:06 - entirely built around academic semesters
10:08 - and I was thinking of having like a fall
10:11 - season and the spring season and then a
10:13 - summer season and then a break so I
10:15 - might I'm thinking about doing something
10:16 - like that because even though my hiatus
10:19 - was much too long this summer in in the
10:23 - end it was almost a full it was possibly
10:25 - over two months so I don't don't intend
10:29 - to have a hiatus that long from
10:31 - live-streaming
10:32 - but I do think each summer like taking a
10:34 - month break is I'm just doing so and so
10:40 - I'm that's not really the important
10:42 - thing right now I'm just looking at the
10:44 - chat to tell me everything is perfect no
10:47 - improvement is needed the monitor care
10:49 - louder you know people are talking if
10:53 - the whiteboard is reflective don't worry
10:54 - about that I'm going to I have Matt the
10:57 - wall covering that I'm going to this is
10:59 - just a very temporary thing the wall
11:00 - covering
11:02 - we'll be Matt is Matt so we won't be too
11:07 - reflective I'm best at the sound delay
11:10 - oh the sound blaze gone so interestingly
11:12 - what I one thing I want to just show you
11:14 - sound is absolutely good enough thank
11:16 - you Peter
11:17 - what's nice about this too when I get
11:19 - these pop-up messages from slack is it
11:21 - has a little face so I see a little face
11:23 - hi
11:24 - thanks Peter alright let's let me go
11:30 - here I just want to show you one other
11:31 - feature that I have here David Cohen is
11:35 - asking are you on Twitch no no no I mean
11:41 - I could be it's a thing I have the
11:44 - technological capability to do but for
11:46 - whatever reason I stream on YouTube
11:47 - YouTube streaming person thing I don't
11:51 - know not on twitch at the moment okay so
11:55 - let me go to this is the thing I want to
11:57 - show you audio advanced audio properties
12:00 - no that's not what I want to show you
12:03 - filters okay I'm going to demonstrate
12:05 - something to you at the moment right so
12:09 - this room in addition to the ceiling
12:11 - being right there
12:13 - this room has some very loud ventilation
12:16 - incidentally if you're wondering what's
12:17 - behind me right over here is a bathroom
12:20 - anybody in there
12:22 - if I have to go which I often do the
12:24 - fight stream for like three or four
12:26 - hours it won't be very far away which is
12:29 - nice on the other side I think it's a
12:30 - shirt shop so there might be some loud
12:33 - noises simply not soundproof in here and
12:35 - there's a very loud ventilation sound
12:37 - it's not that bad but it's a if I were
12:40 - trying to record you know a you know
12:42 - those were like a fully room or trying
12:44 - to record a podcast would be a problem I
12:45 - think with a lav mic and live streaming
12:47 - the the buzz the hum from the
12:50 - ventilation isn't a huge issue but you
12:53 - don't hear it right now because I have
12:54 - OBS an open broadcaster do you have
12:56 - noise suppression on so I'm going to
12:58 - turn that off for a second so now you
13:02 - should be hearing
13:08 - I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat now
13:12 - you should be hearing the sound of the
13:14 - hum now I was monitoring myself on a
13:17 - headphone on a Helen a headphone this is
13:19 - a headphone this is headphones now I can
13:23 - hear myself it's a little bit weird cuz
13:25 - there's a slight lag and I hear that hum
13:29 - i'm gonna click noise suppression and
13:34 - it's gone so i like this without the
13:38 - noise but people the other i did a test
13:40 - livestream with a smaller non public
13:43 - audience and some of the people said to
13:44 - me is a little creepy how silent it is
13:47 - so there is a suppression level variable
13:49 - that i can play with
13:51 - but i couldn't really make it do
13:52 - anything i'm gonna do something with it
13:53 - right now so I am going to way better
14:00 - without the noise canceling so that's
14:03 - your voice is much clearer alright this
14:04 - is gonna be our first ever and also
14:08 - something's weird about the color right
14:10 - doesn't the color of this background
14:11 - look different than what it used to be
14:13 - or am I just crazy because I have a
14:14 - different monitor over here so many
14:16 - things let's do our little
14:19 - strawpoll exercise for the first time
14:25 - straw pull just try this one
14:32 - noise suppression yes and I like it I
14:43 - like the quiet no it's too quiet alright
14:49 - so this is going to be the pole I'm
14:51 - gonna hit create pole and this is the
14:55 - URL if somebody could oblige and place
14:58 - this URL in the if someone could place
15:04 - this URL in the chat thank you
15:09 - and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
15:11 - let you hear this again so I'm gonna
15:13 - talk throughout the whole thing and then
15:15 - I'm also gonna do it and do it and Simon
15:18 - is pointing out to me there's also a
15:20 - noise
15:21 - option that one I tried and it causes a
15:23 - lot of like clicking and going in and
15:25 - out so that one really didn't work very
15:26 - well the colors are a bit off the window
15:29 - is not white right is that but no wait
15:36 - it's weird
15:37 - is that my like setting oh you know what
15:41 - it might be is there like a display
15:43 - color settings or something like I
15:46 - thought what it was was night the thing
15:48 - that's called like no not this that like
15:56 - night vision thing on iOS is not iOS
16:00 - with Mac OS which is somewhere in Energy
16:05 - Saver where is that is there a setting
16:10 - where so we hold on let me do the sound
16:22 - thing first there's like a setting there
16:24 - must be like a color setting thing which
16:26 - I don't know why I'm staring at this as
16:27 - if I'm gonna find it let me do the noise
16:29 - thing okay
16:31 - all right here comes the noise the noise
16:36 - suppression is on noise suppression is
16:39 - on the noise suppression is on the noise
16:42 - suppression is on the noise suppression
16:44 - is on the noise suppression is off the
16:47 - noise suppression is off the noise
16:49 - suppression is off the noise suppression
16:52 - is off the noise suppression is on the
16:55 - noise suppression is on the noise
16:58 - suppression is on these pretzels are
17:02 - making me lose suppressed notes this
17:05 - noise suppression is making me thirsty
17:07 - that would have been better
17:08 - the noise suppression is on the noise
17:11 - suppression is on north suppression is
17:15 - off the noise suppression is off you
17:21 - need the link somebody post the link
17:23 - display night shift tab yeah oh so I
17:27 - wasn't the right place yes but night
17:29 - shift is off so there must be some other
17:31 - kind of color this is what I'm looking
17:32 - for display color
17:35 - ah do you think this is the issue on
17:41 - definitely honest better oh I'm gonna
17:44 - books ah alright I the syllables are
17:53 - clear off there's a middle ground to
17:56 - have the noise suppression I agree I
17:58 - don't know how to set it I can't find
18:00 - the middle ground I want to find the
18:02 - middle I live in the middle I'm all
18:04 - about the middle alright hold on let's
18:10 - try other color profiles could this
18:11 - possibly whoops ah look did that do
18:18 - something there's nobody there's really
18:22 - nobody who has admin privileges in the
18:24 - chat to post that link there we go thank
18:27 - you okay week Mon Nathan growl is going
18:35 - to help me okay I'm ready I'm here I'm
18:38 - following your instructions I'm at your
18:41 - command people tell me what color
18:43 - profile to use hi Gaelic that's so nice
18:46 - I'm so glad to hear that you started
18:48 - programming from watching this channel
18:52 - no no I found the night show people are
18:55 - yeah I forget that you're in the past I
18:57 - am in the future you're in the past oh
18:59 - wait let's see if I can get my sound
19:01 - effects going oh I'm only at 6% after
19:07 - all of that time charging okay it's true
19:11 - tone so I'm supposed to select true tone
19:15 - I don't know how computers work I don't
19:17 - see an option called true tone calibrate
19:20 - what do I do
19:23 - no I don't want built-in retina I want
19:25 - this ah Pro capture no wonder
19:29 - true tone what do i do what do i do it's
19:33 - a color LCD color match so do anything
19:36 - did that do something turn off true tone
19:43 - [Music]
19:53 - there's where we're going to I turn off
19:55 - true tone I don't know how to do that
19:57 - open profile all right let me get my
20:04 - sound going somebody will tell me turn
20:06 - off true to know how completely
20:10 - incompetent I have a master's degree and
20:13 - interactive telecommunications I can't
20:18 - even find the charger charger ah here it
20:23 - is I have a charger I have a USB C 2
20:27 - lightning charger display display tab
20:32 - uncheck true tone okay thank you NIT eh
20:36 - display display uncheck display display
20:43 - tab display display tab I see no
20:48 - unchecking true tone oh there it is but
20:52 - this is for the retina display it
20:54 - shouldn't affect the output to the
20:56 - capture oh I guess I did it do Apple RGB
21:02 - 1998 is that better turn the computer
21:12 - off him at haunt again two tabs to the
21:16 - left yes I can't tell if it change did
21:19 - it change I'm sorry for those of you are
21:22 - here for the coding well there will be
21:25 - some coding today but it's I'm haven't
21:29 - even been a half an hour you oh no no no
21:32 - no no no no no no no no I do not not new
21:40 - message color is better now okay great
21:43 - what did it the true tone or the Adobe
21:47 - RGB who knows
21:50 - let's check the straw poll
21:56 - hmm so more people are voting for the no
22:00 - noise suppression I don't know how new
22:03 - oh I'm sorry
22:03 - pronounced Nidhi didn't help me did I
22:08 - say it wrong nighty sorry I don't know
22:10 - how to pronounce 1998 and true tone off
22:12 - is too white oh no like this like
22:22 - live-streaming settings by committee is
22:24 - a really bad idea but hold on I'm over
22:29 - here trying to get some music playing so
22:32 - give me a minute here
22:34 - 1998 seems more old-fashioned rap I'm
22:36 - gonna I'm gonna put that back i I do
22:40 - like the idea of being like an
22:41 - old-fashioned
22:42 - retro live streaming let's go back to
22:47 - color sync utility I did not need that
22:49 - okay System Preferences displays your
22:57 - turn is off oh I see automatically adapt
23:01 - display make colors appear consistent in
23:03 - different ambient lighting conditions
23:04 - got it so let's go back to house this
23:10 - regular Apple RGB or whatever it was on
23:13 - it was like HD how about this HD 709 a
23:23 - meaty haha mailed it to - does that work
23:33 - makes me so happy
23:35 - it's so sad I have this Elgato stream
23:37 - deck and I've only used four buttons so
23:39 - far so eventually I'll get some more
23:41 - come on here we go let's get to not now
23:45 - I don't need to verify don't want to
23:46 - verify anything just give me my music
23:52 - okay I don't hear it do you hear it whoa
23:54 - super loud coming in super loud coming
23:57 - in alright everybody now
24:03 - what I used to use for this is something
24:05 - called loopback whoops yeah yeah yeah
24:10 - it's a little little behind-the-scenes
24:12 - magic here there we go
24:15 - [Music]
24:51 - [Music]
25:05 - wait we have 30 minutes yet switch over
25:38 - here yeah you don't
25:40 - music is gone you need to add the music
25:42 - to this shot why is it so dark
25:46 - am I crazy is this like really dark oh
25:49 - the cameras like Auto stuff I need to
25:53 - put the camera on manual left is much
25:58 - louder this gyms bonus a little weird
26:02 - okay well so one thing
26:05 - [Music]
26:11 - do you know what that's my fault
26:15 - I actually have separate control it's
26:18 - gonna be too loud sorry buddy
26:20 - [Music]
26:27 - request from Michael Michelle underneath
26:32 - the pronunciation help for this time is
26:55 - it better now the weird thing is the mic
27:10 - is picking it up so much so I just turn
27:15 - the mic off this is the audio without
27:18 - getting it from the mic
27:40 - this dog this dog the start that this
27:42 - stock song never forget the best on but
27:45 - somebody composed that song for me so
27:55 - almost inaudible like when you say was
28:03 - almost inaudible it's always almost
28:04 - inaudible now I or when I when I mute my
28:07 - microphone it's inaudible this is really
28:13 - good for me to be biking all this Oh the
28:18 - laptop mike is the laptop Mike oh you
28:22 - mean I don't know laptop Mike so I don't
28:29 - understand what people are telling me no
28:32 - to sound inputs right now are this Mike
28:35 - and the the music is inaudible is the
28:41 - music inaudible right now oh now I'm
28:51 - throwing it
28:56 - [Music]
29:10 - stop this stop this I have to remind
29:22 - everybody that it's very very you know
29:24 - I'm just an idiot to this because I can
29:27 - actually monitor it
29:46 - [Music]
29:58 - [Music]
30:15 - [Music]
30:33 - [Music]
30:37 - to get hot where's my air conditioning a
30:42 - we too loud but better than before I
30:45 - have very fine control over this audio
30:48 - [Music]
31:05 - [Music]
31:33 - hey it's coating garden with CJ here
31:36 - okay
31:37 - hi Cody garden with CJ alright beam your
31:40 - name is CJ I don't have to refer to you
31:42 - as Cody garden with CJ but it says on my
31:45 - screen love your icon a little plant
31:51 - alright I think I'm done with my good
31:53 - down I think I'm it's as good as it's
31:56 - gonna be we got it I got to do something
31:57 - else
31:59 - got some color got a computer alright so
32:10 - welcome everyone to the coding dream I
32:15 - am your host Daniel chief Mon and I am
32:22 - here to read to you from my book a
32:29 - million random digits with 100,000
32:34 - normal deviates because what we need in
32:38 - this world in these turbulent times is a
32:41 - way of relaxing a meditative experience
32:44 - a way to connect with each other and for
32:46 - me very strangely it happens to be
32:49 - reading random numbers seventy one
32:54 - thousand three hundred eighteen
32:57 - 68,000 876 53,000 986 1289 fifty-eight
33:06 - thousand nine hundred and thirty-four
33:08 - seven it was seven to seven ninety five
33:13 - twenty seven thousand five hundred and
33:16 - thirty seven twenty-three thousand three
33:19 - hundred and fifty three twenty one
33:23 - thousand five hundred and twenty five
33:25 - six thousand one hundred and fifty five
33:28 - fifteen thousand one hundred forty six
33:31 - thirty seven thousand four hundred and
33:34 - seventy eight maybe a thousand five
33:38 - hundred sixty six thirty six thousand
33:42 - eight hundred and eighty-three
33:43 - twenty-six thousand nine hundred and
33:45 - sixty-seven so what this is is a youtube
33:56 - channel where I oh I have to interrupt
33:59 - myself again oh this is I'm the worst
34:01 - because oddly enough to switch to the
34:04 - other camera for some reason I have this
34:07 - like it was doing some cleaning and
34:08 - various things that have this perfectly
34:11 - green little towel which I could use to
34:13 - like erase the whiteboard but I'm gonna
34:14 - get a dirty so I just really feel like I
34:18 - need to walk into the other scene
34:21 - wearing it
34:27 - [Music]
34:40 - also what's gonna be fun is I will show
34:44 - you this very very strange mysterious
34:48 - can of paint what is going on with this
34:51 - weird can of paint you know what's going
34:56 - on it it's got green on it that's the
34:59 - actual paint I painted that whiteboard
35:02 - okay so I was saying is this is a
35:04 - YouTube channel where every week and I
35:07 - think it's gonna be Friday's for the
35:09 - foreseeable foreseeable future I think
35:14 - that I'm gonna alternate between doing
35:16 - live streams that are in the morning my
35:20 - time which would be about 9:00 a.m. my
35:22 - time eastern time you can do your math
35:24 - as to where you are and 5:00 p.m.
35:28 - Eastern Time so today was a 5:00 p.m.
35:31 - Eastern time today I heard from a lot of
35:33 - you that like it's midnight my time it's
35:34 - 1:00 a.m. my time I'm gonna stay up to
35:36 - watch you know get some sleep take care
35:38 - of yourself
35:39 - it's much of your health and your your
35:41 - sleep and your is much more important
35:43 - than coding and me and YouTube and all
35:46 - that nonsense but to the extent that I
35:48 - can alternate different times to help
35:50 - people with different parts of the world
35:51 - catch the live streams I'm happy to do
35:54 - so and it works well with my schedule
35:55 - because sometimes I have something the
35:56 - morning sometimes there's something in
35:57 - the evening I do feel a little bit like
35:58 - Friday at 5:00 p.m. is not the best time
36:01 - for the live stream I have a very busy
36:03 - week if you haven't watched before I
36:05 - happen to have this strange full-time
36:07 - job where I work at New York University
36:08 - it's actually where I am right now
36:10 - I'm at the new building in Brooklyn
36:14 - so in this building on the floor where I
36:16 - am is a program called ITP interactive
36:19 - telecommunications program I would pull
36:20 - up all these websites or slides but do
36:23 - that there's also an undergraduate major
36:25 - called ima or Interactive Media Arts
36:27 - downstairs for me is the inter
36:29 - integrated digital media program from
36:31 - the Tannen School of Engineering
36:32 - upstairs is the Clive Davis Center for
36:36 - recorded music remove recorded music
36:38 - Department one floor up is the NYU game
36:41 - Center did you know let's see if there
36:43 - live right now this would be amazing if
36:45 - they were
36:46 - they don't think they are NYU game game
36:51 - I can type game Center live YouTube here
36:57 - we go
36:58 - this should get us where's the live
37:02 - streams oh there we go so they were life
37:05 - looks like it was live stream yesterday
37:06 - come on people
37:07 - oh you can't see this watch the game
37:09 - Center live we can help them out here um
37:14 - so anyway check out that anyway you gave
37:20 - centers here I'm hoping to do more some
37:23 - stuff with them maybe invite some guests
37:25 - go upstairs I don't know we'd love to
37:26 - collaborate with them as well
37:29 - elsewhere in this building I believe
37:31 - there's a computer science department
37:33 - there's some engineering departments
37:34 - there's something called cusp which is
37:36 - the Center for urban studies and
37:37 - planning
37:38 - I believe lots of stuff in this building
37:39 - it's very exciting I love being in
37:41 - Brooklyn I live in Brooklyn and so
37:45 - there's a lot of convenience now it took
37:48 - me a long time to get back up and
37:50 - running with this equipment in this room
37:52 - so hopefully I'm gonna be here now for
37:54 - you know until the middle of December
37:56 - every single week I have some ideas and
38:00 - other things that I might try to do with
38:01 - the channel a little surprises hopefully
38:03 - plan which I will speak to but what I
38:05 - wanted to use today for beyond what I
38:11 - wanted to use today for beyond just kind
38:13 - of testing the equipment and getting
38:14 - back in the habit of doing this is to
38:16 - say like it's hard like I didn't really
38:19 - feel like doing this again today I mean
38:21 - I hate to admit that because this is one
38:23 - of the things that I enjoy in my life
38:25 - the most and the community that's around
38:28 - and the people that I've met and the
38:29 - people who leave comments and watch the
38:31 - videos and create all these amazing
38:33 - things that I never imagined to be
38:34 - possible from these videos but you get
38:36 - kind of out of the habit and I was like
38:37 - I just want to go home like play with
38:39 - kittens I have kittens I mean I there
38:42 - are four kittens living in my house
38:45 - right now it's a little bit nutso and we
38:48 - need to those other two kids are being
38:49 - adopted I think two is the right number
38:50 - I mentioned on Instagram you can follow
38:52 - some of mango and goose
38:55 - fill up that Instagram come on that's so
39:00 - but I'm now that I'm doing it I feel
39:03 - really good and excited I feel like
39:05 - there's a lot more work to do i i'm i
39:08 - don't want to livestream with a lot of
39:10 - the you know there's a lot of nice
39:12 - inside jokes in terms of the
39:13 - imperfections and things that don't work
39:15 - and the camera shutting off but i would
39:16 - like to have a bit more of a
39:18 - professional operation mostly just to
39:20 - have a higher quality content so there
39:25 - so that's what's happening the channel
39:27 - is meant to be for a beginner i have if
39:29 - you've never watched before which i
39:31 - don't know if it's so many of you i have
39:34 - a thank you k weak bond for posting him
39:37 - to the gents awesome i have what am I
39:44 - trying to say sorry i thought of the
39:48 - kittens again when i lost my train whoa
39:52 - that was loud of thought does it say to
39:56 - - yeah that's funny because when i press
40:01 - the button you see the choo choo and
40:03 - then a little later i press the button
40:05 - whatever so what i want to one of the
40:11 - things i want to use today for is to get
40:13 - organized
40:14 - i have a lot of new stuff that i'm
40:17 - planning stuff that's coming together
40:18 - but it's taken longer to come together
40:20 - so i actually even though this
40:22 - whiteboard is a little bit janky for
40:24 - today i'm going to use it to make a list
40:28 - of things that I want to accomplish this
40:33 - fall and through December in terms of
40:36 - content on this channel and then I
40:38 - really want to try to stick to that or
40:39 - use it as kind of guide a checklist so
40:42 - to speak and you guys can help keep me
40:44 - you all of you watching can keep me
40:47 - honest in terms of what I'm getting to
40:49 - and not getting to so I'm gonna first
40:51 - I'm just gonna brainstorm let me first
40:52 - figure out which marker works but I
40:54 - could type this up so I could make this
40:56 - a type list but I feel like doing this
40:59 - on the whiteboard and then we will write
41:01 - it down ah look at that this is a much
41:03 - better marker I don't know why what's
41:04 - the difference I'm going to come up
41:06 - close to you and show you
41:08 - as far as I can tell there's no
41:09 - difference between these markers they're
41:11 - the same but this one works and this one
41:13 - doesn't okay so things that I want to
41:19 - accomplish this fall so there's like
41:24 - leftover stuff I better call it leftover
41:28 - tic-tac-toe minimax
41:33 - I remember this was left dangling can
41:36 - you see this at all yeah you can kind of
41:39 - see that it's not the greatest the
41:46 - something I gotta do something more with
41:48 - the Rubik's Cube I don't know what
41:51 - that's gonna be definitely have to do
41:55 - something more let's talk about machine
41:59 - learning so that's another topic I want
42:04 - to do something called a latent space
42:08 - walk space walk that's definitely
42:12 - something I want to do I probably will
42:15 - use runway for that a runway m/l that's
42:20 - something I definitely want to do I want
42:23 - to spend some time on the ml5 this is
42:26 - not a thing that exists on the internet
42:28 - right now but I have a version of this
42:31 - new I tweeted this out so a little bit I
42:33 - apologize for the glare this is a new
42:37 - function in ml 5 called neural network
42:39 - that allows you to train a model from
42:42 - that from scratch you basically what
42:44 - allows you to do is you if you have a
42:45 - data set if it's in a JSON format or a
42:48 - CSV format you can load it in ml 5 will
42:52 - create a neural network architecture for
42:54 - you based on just some heuristics making
42:56 - some best guesses and then you can train
42:57 - a model and use it so that's something I
42:59 - absolutely want to do there are probably
43:06 - like so this this is what's off the top
43:10 - of my head so let me take a look at the
43:12 - chat right now and see if anything has
43:15 - come in by the way I'm getting much
43:19 - better at solving the Rubik's Cube I
43:21 - didn't actually brings
43:22 - in this summer fry birthday my kids
43:25 - bought me everything by four you know
43:27 - whatever my family bought me a nine by
43:29 - nine Rubik's Cube which I spend quite a
43:30 - bit of time it took me about most of the
43:32 - day to solve it but I could solve it now
43:33 - that was a lot of fun okay tree data
43:39 - structure that's a hint I Claire p5 Jess
43:46 - that would be good let me come back over
43:48 - here for a second so the other so where
43:51 - do you find ah yes so thank you Simon
43:55 - brought something up which I'm gonna put
43:57 - so I'm gonna put that under J s topics
44:04 - like these are really just like
44:05 - programming topics um so let's call that
44:09 - generator function this is something
44:12 - that I've been meaning to look at and
44:14 - maybe talk about at some point over here
44:17 - I should write challenges so this will
44:20 - be like new challenges and again this
44:23 - isn't like these are the things I'm
44:25 - gonna do this semester this fall winter
44:27 - and nothing's gonna change I just want
44:29 - to have a little bit of a plan and
44:30 - something to work with so that I'm kind
44:33 - of keeping track of the larger picture
44:35 - and getting a sense of like what people
44:36 - are interested in tree for the minimax
44:39 - yes so okay so let me see what else
44:48 - don't forget n dimensions all right so n
44:56 - dimensions okay yeah people are asking
45:03 - for oh you doesn't change automatically
45:05 - people are mentioning reinforcement
45:08 - learning that I that I'm very interested
45:12 - in I hesitate to write that down right
45:14 - now because it's a bit more of the
45:17 - purview of what I plan to do this spring
45:19 - I mean I make a year behind at this
45:21 - point and where I wanted to be with that
45:23 - so I kind of want to put that there but
45:25 - I don't I'm not super ready to commit to
45:28 - that right now okay WebGL and shaders
45:34 - Oh P something that I would like to also
45:37 - have as a general topic if I'm sort of
45:41 - thinking of topics is like open source
45:44 - so I think I could do more with git and
45:49 - github but I probably need to detail
45:51 - that a bit better okay so a bit harder
45:59 - for me to use this stream deck but I do
46:01 - enjoy it okay so a couple things one let
46:05 - me you know most of you I think who are
46:07 - watching or familiar with the channel
46:09 - I'm getting the sense but they're
46:10 - probably people have never watched
46:11 - before so if you're looking for to sort
46:15 - of learn about the coding train you know
46:18 - use two first stops one could just be
46:20 - the channel homepage but also the coding
46:23 - train website itself and this is where
46:26 - you'll find some of the categories of
46:27 - the kind of content that I make
46:29 - so there's coding challenges which are
46:31 - really just you know one-off videos I
46:33 - want to do more computational geometry
46:35 - hello so many things you can see these
46:37 - here so these are them and you know if
46:41 - you see it's a wide variety of topics
46:42 - relating to algorithms and drawing in
46:45 - various things well I really have made a
46:47 - lot of content it's kind of a big thing
46:51 - Oktoberfest
46:52 - thank you for mentioning that so maybe
46:55 - we can do I can plan to do something
46:57 - around
46:59 - Oktoberfest write that down over here a
47:06 - functional on Oh Opie stuff so what am I
47:09 - missing from the sort of yeah so I think
47:13 - I need a more specific suggestion than
47:15 - that but that is something an automated
47:17 - switch for they can't write you yeah
47:19 - yeah I probably should do that I don't
47:22 - know okay then there are tutorials I
47:28 - mean do I need to what I might like to
47:31 - redo some of these beginner ones that
47:34 - are quite out of date but I guess I'm
47:37 - gonna hold off on that right now
47:39 - alright so let's go look at so another
47:42 - place where I kind of compile things
47:44 - that I'm interested in I had people
47:46 - suggest is
47:48 - this github reap positive repository
47:51 - called a rainbow topics I really keep
47:53 - meeting to change the names of these
47:55 - repos to be like Train themes they're
47:57 - like be like stations or stops or
47:59 - something like that but when we were
48:01 - this other when I was when I would we
48:03 - when this was a different channel with
48:05 - another name back in the day it was
48:07 - called rainbow topics I just can't bring
48:09 - myself to change it so let's look at
48:13 - this so one thing I'm gonna do is
48:14 - sometimes when I'm interested in
48:16 - something I like assign it to myself so
48:19 - let me look at that first
48:22 - okay autoencoders uh-huh well this I did
48:26 - ah yes
48:29 - marching squares marching cubes
48:31 - absolutely want to do that let's write
48:36 - that here marching squares cubes that's
48:44 - one it and the reason why I'm making
48:45 - this list I have another sort of plan
48:51 - now already P and this is a little bit
48:57 - our DP algorithm is something I really
49:02 - want to do toothpick I did toothpicks oh
49:08 - you know I'm not really standing in the
49:10 - place where I'm kind of like off my
49:12 - because I'm usually over here and then I
49:16 - have more room here not really fully
49:19 - used to this layout yet Fibonacci spiral
49:22 - part four of nerve evolution what was
49:24 - that water ripples I mean I have to go
49:28 - through all these yeah I think I did
49:30 - this ah Bora Rose is definitely
49:32 - happening but I have a plan for that so
49:34 - I don't but I'll put that put that on
49:36 - the board
49:44 - I did pull the roses but a more roses a
49:46 - slightly different thing flocking
49:48 - challenge I did wait are these no
49:51 - they're the only opens Wow we really got
49:53 - to go through these k-means clustering
49:54 - yeah I do want to do that tree that tic
49:58 - tac toe I did no more no more fluid
50:01 - simulation please Alam spiral oh this is
50:05 - patron recommended ASCII art generator
50:07 - that's kind of like a fun one I don't
50:11 - know how I would do that something
50:16 - around like ASCII art let's do that so
50:26 - David is telling me oh and David could
50:30 - you a Voronoi yes actually um JavaScript
50:35 - promises okay well so many so many
50:37 - things are coming in hold on hold on
50:39 - when it is high what are they dying
50:40 - everybody Voronoi I died I'm afraid of
50:44 - that but it is something that goes on
50:46 - the list I think I need can I just
50:50 - please right now just put de Launay
50:51 - triangulation and then if I can manage
50:54 - to do that the next step then then you
50:57 - can tell me to do Voronoi I need to
50:59 - build up to it okay so the other okay we
51:07 - hold on David had said something
51:08 - procedurally generated textures yeah
51:13 - what did I mean by that I so apparently
51:15 - in a video I said that I wanted to
51:19 - generate do procedurally generated
51:21 - textures I think I'll need to like go
51:23 - back dive back into that tic-tac-toe ai
51:27 - yes a wire world cellular automata to
51:30 - C++ yeah okay interesting all right so
51:32 - um now let me look at another so the
51:41 - course that I'm actually teaching where
51:43 - I need to make some videos to go along
51:45 - with it
51:45 - github.com slash Schiffman no no it's in
51:49 - the ml 5 organization under
51:54 - intro to ml arts ima oh how come I'm not
51:58 - signed in I guess I won't worry about
51:59 - that right now so I'm gonna look at this
52:01 - syllabus because I want to make videos
52:04 - for all of these things so I've made
52:06 - videos about image classification I've
52:08 - made videos about transfer learning I'm
52:11 - gonna be making a video it goes under
52:13 - the ml list but I'm not ready to it's
52:16 - happening for sure but I'm not ready to
52:18 - announce it yet but it has to do with so
52:20 - I'll be coming to that pre-trained
52:23 - models physical interactions so I think
52:26 - that I want to do so another topic is
52:32 - image segmentation models in ml 5 so
52:41 - that's at the moment that's you net I
52:44 - guess I'm you net and there's another
52:49 - one body pics
52:51 - so those are two I mean that I would
52:54 - even do today you might have you know
52:56 - I'm kind of like I feel like I'm here
52:58 - till 7:00 so another a little over an
53:00 - hour but I have some other things I
53:01 - think I might do today but that's that
53:05 - goes on that list there I've already got
53:10 - the ml 5 neural network data collection
53:13 - model training data collection model
53:15 - training convolutional neural networks
53:18 - what the heck did I mean by that oh dear
53:22 - oh not I don't know what happen I don't
53:27 - know what I'm doing with that so on the
53:28 - syllabus I don't know what's happening
53:30 - with that recurrent neural networks I do
53:33 - want to do more with so let me go back
53:38 - here so I want to do I want to do I want
53:47 - to do interactive sketch RNN I have a
53:49 - sketch or an end video but I want to do
53:52 - interactive sketch are an N and that is
53:56 - going to relate directly to doing RDP so
54:00 - I need to do our DP to go along with
54:03 - that
54:06 - I'm gonna move this open-source thing
54:08 - somewhere else because the machine
54:09 - learning list is going to get long so
54:15 - open-source what did I have right now we
54:18 - you really just had to do something for
54:20 - hack tober fest I wrote git and github
54:22 - but I actually feel like I need I don't
54:25 - want to put general things on here I do
54:27 - that too much like I want like specific
54:29 - video topics so like generator function
54:32 - is a specific video topic soak a week -
54:38 - suggesting explaining how filters and
54:40 - pooling layers work yeah I would like to
54:43 - do a video on that
54:44 - I'm waiting into the territory of where
54:48 - ml5 kind of like hides and obscures
54:51 - those things but I'm gonna talk about it
54:53 - in my class at NYU so I don't know let's
54:56 - I'm gonna table that okay data
55:02 - collection in a Python environment
55:03 - trading and uh magenta let's put that on
55:06 - the list this is not my strength but I'm
55:10 - gonna try to do something with did I
55:13 - make a video and sound classification I
55:14 - did but I'm gonna do like a maybe a
55:16 - melody generator RNN so I wanted to do
55:22 - something with that run more stuff with
55:30 - runway I'm gonna do like yeah I mean
55:33 - this interactive image synthesis so
55:36 - that's also a thing that I want to do I
55:38 - did a few videos like I've done videos
55:40 - on this already but I haven't really
55:43 - done the videos on this so I'm gonna do
55:46 - interactive image synthesis for sure
55:50 - which is another basically image
55:53 - segmentation but in the other direction
55:54 - so I'm gonna say image I know that
55:59 - segmentation but like in the other
56:01 - direction so interactive image synthesis
56:06 - so and I should emphasize that for these
56:10 - topics I'm really using higher-level
56:13 - tools so I'm using ml 5 and I'm using
56:16 - runway which is why I'm not sure what
56:18 - to put about like CNN on here
56:21 - convolutional neural network because I
56:23 - don't think that what I'm gonna do or
56:25 - have the time for or the the ability to
56:28 - really this semester is like program a
56:32 - convolutional neural network from
56:34 - scratch but I could use tensor flow ji
56:36 - you know what we're putting them putting
56:39 - that on there CN n because even if I
56:44 - don't do it in my course at a minimum I
56:46 - could talk about what a convolutional
56:48 - layer is and go through it and then make
56:51 - a convolutional neural network in
56:53 - tension flow DJ s that's a topic I feel
56:55 - confident in so these are all my ml
56:58 - topics these are some challenges that I
57:00 - want to do what are ones that are like
57:03 - highly requested Tetris thinking of game
57:07 - things that people are always asking me
57:09 - to do so oh so this is what I'm going to
57:11 - do next
57:15 - so Simon is asking doesn't melody
57:18 - generate or go under the challenge list
57:20 - probably but I'm not worried right now
57:22 - I'm not worrying about where the video
57:24 - is actually gonna live I'm just trying
57:25 - to organize the topics so yeah I might
57:27 - make it a coding challenge like melody
57:29 - generator but it's still with so we'll
57:32 - see okay so the other thing the other
57:34 - way that I look for these topics is by
57:37 - going to I'm gonna clear my filter that
57:42 - our assignment it's gonna look at the
57:44 - open issues Atari breakout I've never
57:49 - done Opeth because I had a guest meaning
57:52 - she do breakout but you know people
57:54 - would enjoy seeing me do it so that's a
57:56 - great one we add that there oh you know
58:03 - what's left over
58:04 - here's another left over neuro steering
58:07 - don't call it so that live stream never
58:11 - got edited into a condensed video which
58:14 - I think would have value for people
58:15 - because right now the only way to look
58:17 - at my explanation and demonstration of
58:21 - that is to watch like two or three hours
58:22 - which maybe some people actually want to
58:24 - do but I would like to make a shorter
58:26 - video out of that
58:30 - then this is what I like to do ah neat
58:33 - neat yes so neat memory game with
58:36 - numbers that sounds like fun
58:39 - let me sort this by most thumbs up so
58:47 - this is another way that I sort this by
58:51 - most thumbs up so we've got a bunch of
58:53 - these already storm hydrology simulator
58:56 - wait when did this appear I don't even
58:58 - remember seeing this oh wait I think I
59:05 - know this channel oh my goodness totally
59:10 - missed this totally miss this what I
59:16 - totally miss I totally want to do this
59:22 - okay oh my god I better login so I can
59:28 - reply to this where's my phone needs a
59:36 - two-factor this baby
59:45 - getting tweets from people asking to
59:47 - post my cats to Twitter oh yes I'll post
59:50 - my cats to Twitter
59:51 - don't you worry oh no I got to get some
59:53 - code here Authenticator plugging my
59:58 - stickers yeah 946 this is probably is
60:03 - this insecure for me like doing this
60:05 - live I don't think it matters it's gonna
60:07 - regenerate itself okay I don't know how
60:11 - did I miss this oh here by the way
60:42 - frequently is this is oh that member
60:49 - joining Joe Paris gets a choo-choo this
60:51 - by the way is basically just sums up
60:55 - everything I think this if people could
60:57 - just like screenshots his I feel like
61:00 - this like just summarizes my entire life
61:02 - right here and I would just use all of
61:06 - them oh it didn't even I forgot how to
61:14 - do it that's so weird
61:16 - I was like oh it's just like being slow
61:18 - whatever there we go
61:24 - [Music]
61:30 - [Music]
61:36 - store but be very very careful about
61:55 - doing these emojis correctly there we go
61:58 - good enough good enough okay well I've
62:04 - lost a lot of viewers could work
62:05 - Schiffman ah a new member thank you
62:10 - thank you to Joe Paris for joining us a
62:13 - new member I'll talk about the
62:14 - membership stuff in a minute okay going
62:18 - back
62:18 - nope going oh here okay computer vision
62:22 - fluid dynamics 3d water physics computer
62:25 - craft Turtles Oh bro Noi electron I
62:29 - totally will happily do that so that
62:32 - goes under J s topics or open source
62:36 - let's put it here electron tetris pi day
62:45 - github tires in convert Karman vortex
62:49 - street and that looks terrifying tariffs
62:53 - oh no no we're fluid stuff help that
63:02 - marching cubes oh oh I like this this is
63:15 - awesome
63:18 - Collatz conjecture like that
63:28 - so I have by the way I have a whole new
63:30 - way I'm gonna pick challenges that I've
63:32 - just thought of it like kind of a sort
63:34 - of thing about it today so and those are
63:39 - two David Wright's those are two things
63:41 - I saw in rainbow topics I'm not sure
63:42 - what that's referring to another new
63:44 - member candle hitokiri no all right so I
63:56 - think this is I'm just doing this one
63:58 - page hexagonal grid what's this exactly
64:07 - yeah I think this could actually be
64:10 - really good and Oh red blobs games is
64:14 - like one of my favorite websites and
64:18 - this is looks like some very helpful
64:20 - information that I could probably follow
64:22 - I'm looking for there we go look at that
64:24 - yeah let's do that
64:26 - so that's also a coding challenge so
64:29 - this is good cuz I've got I'm at the
64:35 - bottom of the whiteboard here there's
64:36 - another new member with a Cyrillic name
64:40 - Russian name I believe that I cannot
64:42 - pronounce one two three four five six
64:47 - seven eight nine so this is a good these
64:49 - are things I need to get to that I did
64:51 - before I mean I'm sure there are more
64:53 - things but let me talk about now Oh
64:58 - nightbot yes I've so many people have
65:02 - recommended nightbot to me I don't know
65:05 - I don't know if that's like I think let
65:06 - me I guess I guess I can make another
65:09 - category here I've kind of out of room
65:11 - but which is stream improvements let's
65:15 - brainstorm some of these right now so
65:19 - nightbot what else oh I want to do more
65:29 - with the stream deck I guess I'll just
65:33 - put things here if they come up all
65:34 - right
65:35 - Oh pac-man and whirly noise yep
65:41 - so I'm a little bit afraid to do pac-man
65:44 - but I'll put it on the list I'm very
65:47 - afraid to do whirly noise but we
65:49 - shouldn't live in fear of these topics
65:51 - there we go all right so I think I want
65:55 - to do some coding today
65:58 - [Music]
65:59 - so let me just talk about some kind of
66:03 - administrative stuff in terms of my
66:06 - plans so I am revamping not
66:12 - significantly the membership slash
66:15 - patron program I haven't I'm not fully
66:20 - decided about any stuff and a huge thank
66:22 - you to psy who has come on board as a
66:25 - coding trained community manager has
66:26 - been thinking through a lot of this
66:27 - stuff communicating with those of you
66:29 - who have joined helping you make sure
66:30 - you get your stuff in the mail if you
66:33 - have questions about being a patron or a
66:36 - member or if you are one and you haven't
66:38 - received something that you were
66:40 - promised please reach out directly to
66:42 - psy you can do that in the slack channel
66:45 - through a direct message if you don't
66:47 - have a slack invite then you should
66:49 - reach out to info at the coding train
66:51 - comm or sigh that's CY at the coding
66:55 - train comm David I do want to showcase
66:58 - contributions yes David do you think you
67:01 - could make me like a bitly link or
67:03 - something like that because that way I
67:04 - can just get to that document you made
67:06 - very quickly so Nathan go to bed and
67:10 - don't worry that not all the livestreams
67:14 - won't all be at this time this is just
67:15 - this week I'm going to definitely do
67:17 - some earlier in the day okay so one of
67:24 - the main things that I'm changing about
67:26 - being a patron or a member is I don't
67:28 - think that were male people signed books
67:31 - anymore I would love to be able to get
67:33 - people signed books so I'm trying to
67:34 - think of a new gift and I'm working with
67:38 - standard so if you're not familiar with
67:41 - a standard they are a company that does
67:44 - a lot of different services for
67:46 - different YouTube creators oh you can't
67:48 - see me I've been in the wrong screen for
67:51 - like the longest time
67:55 - there I am over there camera bot is a
67:59 - must
67:59 - yeah okay stream improvements camera bot
68:14 - so I'm hoping to launch a new
68:18 - merchandise store with standard helping
68:21 - me design some stuff and then also have
68:24 - a special like gift that would go to
68:27 - patrons and members only and hopefully I
68:30 - can't I don't know I the spirit of what
68:33 - I'm doing I would like to send this gift
68:35 - out to everyone so even if you joined
68:37 - like however many years ago but that
68:40 - would most likely anyway I'm still
68:42 - figuring that out but will the thing
68:44 - that I'm changing is that I'm going to
68:46 - YouTube membership platform and people
68:48 - are joining through YouTube there are
68:50 - two ways that you currently can support
68:57 - the coding train one is through patreon
68:59 - and one is through YouTube membership
69:01 - YouTube membership doesn't have levels
69:03 - right now and patreon does and so I
69:06 - think I'm going to add those levels to
69:07 - YouTube's membership and then there are
69:10 - certain things that YouTube's membership
69:12 - allows me to do for example have YouTube
69:15 - member only live streams and you get
69:17 - little I mean emojis and because that's
69:23 - what people that sort of things so I'm
69:26 - conflicted I'm not choosing to shut down
69:29 - patreon yet but I might recommend if you
69:33 - want the full suite of benefits to join
69:36 - through you to youtube memberships
69:38 - anyway and I'm happy to answer questions
69:40 - about that or talk about that more at a
69:42 - later date so sarcasm as a service wrote
69:53 - joined up just in time to get my sign
69:55 - book I hope that doesn't mean you joined
69:57 - today you know here's the reason why I
70:01 - can't send the sign books I'll tell you
70:03 - why I can't figure out a way to do it
70:06 - that doesn't cost
70:08 - more than $50 to ship a book
70:09 - internationally it's also a tremendous
70:11 - amount of work and get behind and people
70:13 - who they get late they get lost in the
70:15 - mail so it just doesn't seem very
70:19 - sustainable and I don't even know if
70:21 - it's a thing that people want that much
70:23 - so I if you have ideas or thoughts about
70:26 - the various types of things that people
70:29 - are interested in and benefits I mean
70:31 - mostly I don't wanna spend too much time
70:33 - on this because mostly I'm here just
70:35 - doing this YouTube livestream thing it's
70:37 - nice to have this community of people
70:39 - who are part of the member program it's
70:41 - sort of like it there's many benefits to
70:44 - that beyond just like you know some
70:46 - funding for the channel that allows me
70:48 - to do various things and hire people to
70:50 - work on projects and like sort of keep
70:52 - myself motivated to be honest but that's
70:56 - not my my highest priority but I do want
70:59 - to make it something that is sustainable
71:01 - and meaningful for people who are
71:02 - joining but you're not gonna miss
71:04 - anything by not joining you will not
71:06 - miss anything
71:08 - all the content that I do will always
71:11 - just be on the channel or you know on
71:13 - github and that sort of thing there's no
71:14 - a premium content okay so and some
71:21 - people are asking about the member only
71:23 - live streams so the member only live
71:25 - streams are typically live streams where
71:28 - I'm testing out an idea or doing an
71:31 - offline recording session of something
71:34 - that I'm gonna publish as a recorded
71:35 - video so the only thing you might miss
71:38 - if you don't catch a member only live
71:40 - stream is a little bit of behind the
71:42 - scenes sort of chatter and flourish like
71:44 - really if I'm trying to figure out I'm
71:46 - Nathan I think I saw a message about
71:48 - helping me tune the audio settings like
71:50 - that I would do in a member only live
71:52 - stream well as much as you all might
71:54 - have enjoyed me for a half an hour
71:55 - trying to do a whole lot of audio
71:59 - testing okay discord server has been
72:04 - suggested I yeah yeah where's that
72:08 - discord I am very open to that I feel
72:15 - like I'm out of my element here as like
72:17 - an old fogey not that old of a foggy
72:21 - fogey nonetheless and I don't know right
72:25 - now the ways that the community
72:28 - communicates are git and github for all
72:32 - of the sort of code examples and
72:34 - suggesting topics
72:36 - sorry github is not get and github
72:38 - github is the website where I keep all
72:40 - the source code and there's the issues
72:43 - for topic suggestions a better system
72:45 - for topics you suggestions it's
72:46 - definitely needed and wanted but that's
72:48 - the system right now there's YouTube
72:52 - YouTube comments I used to read I still
72:55 - intend to read every single comment I'm
72:56 - like two months behind I kind of like
72:58 - popped in and out but I just like lost
73:01 - the ability to keep up with it
73:03 - but that's the place where there's
73:05 - community happening YouTube comments
73:07 - aren't my favorite place in the world
73:08 - you the people that I hear from seem to
73:11 - be wonderful people and I'm very lucky
73:13 - and privileged to have thoughtful
73:16 - comments and I think you know there's
73:18 - there's lots of reasons for that that
73:21 - are unfortunate that not everybody is so
73:23 - lucky to be able to and not be harassed
73:25 - online as but so that's one place so
73:30 - we've established github YouTube you
73:33 - know there's social media I'm not a huge
73:35 - I'm not super active on Twitter but
73:37 - that's where you'll find me the
73:39 - Instagram is run by psy we have a
73:41 - Facebook need to do some more with that
73:42 - so there's also that the member
73:45 - community where is really a place to
73:47 - like ask coding questions share cat
73:49 - pictures and just kind of like enjoy
73:51 - each other's company has been a slack
73:53 - channel but you know it's not
73:56 - sustainable for me to pay for slack
73:58 - because it's around five dollars per
74:00 - person and if someone's joined for five
74:02 - dollars like it doesn't even pay for
74:05 - itself so some people have suggested
74:09 - discord and maybe there's me I think
74:11 - there's an unofficial discord there's a
74:12 - reddit so that's me I'm really open to
74:14 - and maybe we can have some more
74:16 - discussion about that in what is
74:18 - currently the existing slack Channel
74:20 - okay I did spin up a whole Mastodon
74:24 - instance when I was on a Mastodon kick
74:26 - it was about a year ago but I let it as
74:29 - many things happen on the internet I
74:31 - just let it fall away
74:32 - that's that okay all right could you
74:37 - please do a video you have videos on map
74:39 - and reduce how about a video on ma nodes
74:41 - and transducers New York's video on the
74:44 - wavefunction alright so here's the thing
74:47 - what I would like oh I thought of
74:50 - another coding challenge I don't have
74:52 - room on the board anyway I might even
74:53 - just do it today I'm tired I gotta do
74:57 - some coding before I go so again this
74:59 - was my practice get back into the swing
75:01 - of things I have some other so I have
75:05 - some other things that I'm hoping to do
75:06 - some a new kind of video that I'm gonna
75:08 - try to do on the channel but I almost
75:09 - think too much about it before I do it
75:11 - pipe I shot a pilot and it was like a
75:15 - total mess so I'm gonna reshoot that
75:17 - pilot and see how that goes it's a video
75:21 - that I could kind of video that I can do
75:22 - when I'm not here at NYU that I can
75:24 - actually do from home so that's that's
75:26 - coming let's see if it's not alone be a
75:28 - livestream thing David Schneider asked
75:32 - is there a way to pledge more than five
75:33 - dollars a month with YouTube memberships
75:35 - I thought I was mentioning this and I
75:36 - think I lost my train of thought and
75:40 - didn't get there so David you really you
75:43 - can get my attention without doing a
75:44 - super chat but thank you very much so
75:51 - yes so YouTube memberships has multi
75:54 - tiered levels
75:55 - I just haven't put them in yet so I'm
75:57 - working with psy to do that and if in an
75:59 - ideal world those would be up as of next
76:02 - week
76:02 - so but that's that's that's the go I'm
76:05 - gonna have equivalent levels on YouTube
76:08 - and patreon and I would just remove the
76:10 - patreon but whenever I say I'm gonna do
76:12 - that
76:12 - I hear from above at your Villa sites
76:13 - please don't do that I just like using
76:14 - patreon as a platform so I see no reason
76:16 - not to keep it open but it's a platform
76:19 - that I'm less invested in paying
76:22 - attention to I mean there's a lot of
76:24 - downsides of doing everything on YouTube
76:26 - so I have mixed feelings about that but
76:28 - I think I'll get some benefits from the
76:31 - YouTube channel knowing who the members
76:32 - are but who knows
76:34 - welcome to I'm getting all these new
76:36 - members welcome to a new member
76:37 - bilal shot hello and thank you very much
76:41 - okay I believe people are joining when
76:43 - I've done absolutely nothing but talk
76:45 - for
76:45 - what is now an hour in 20 minutes geez
76:49 - Louise I need a little break I don't
76:54 - have any of my by the way I'm seeking
77:01 - seeking an animator with a special love
77:05 - for unicorns and rainbow like aesthetics
77:07 - who might like to work on some
77:09 - interstitial animations that I can play
77:11 - during live streams like about to start
77:14 - on a break and technical difficulties
77:16 - reach out I guess right now on Twitter
77:19 - if it send me a link to like your reel
77:21 - or portfolio or something I'm looking to
77:23 - hire somebody to do that kind of work
77:26 - okay
77:30 - [Music]
77:37 - [Music]
77:59 - that's not promising I wanted to see if
78:02 - this example worked as I was thinking of
78:04 - using it I was thinking of trying to do
78:11 - I since I you call a lien out of tune
78:13 - and the ukulele tuner I have doesn't
78:14 - have a battery I was thinking why did
78:37 - that not work
78:45 - I'm handed taping here let's see is
78:47 - there a pitch detection example here
78:50 - let's try the piano pitch detection
78:53 - let's close this there we go
79:02 - [Music]
79:09 - this was a coding challenge I was
79:12 - thinking of doing today can anyone tell
79:15 - me if I'm getting anything remotely
79:16 - accurate that I could actually use yeah
79:26 - I think I could do this if it works it
79:28 - works all right
79:36 - so that's one thing I could do before I
79:37 - go the other thing is here so I happen
79:40 - to listen to I don't know if I should
79:41 - admit this I mean I actually don't mind
79:44 - admitting this but I happen to listen to
79:46 - a podcast you know I had a wheel a
79:49 - spinning wheel quite a long time ago
79:51 - right you've seen me do this right where
79:53 - I will go and I go to this like I think
79:56 - it's like Schiffman github do slash
80:00 - randomizer I think is where it lives and
80:03 - I've done this and I'll take my list of
80:06 - coding challenge ideas like marching
80:08 - squares RDP more rows and like ASCII art
80:17 - right if I take that list and I put it
80:21 - here into this randomizer and I go to
80:23 - spin I get this nice wheel which I think
80:28 - I can grab and I can I thought I could
80:31 - spin it or I could press this button
80:33 - spin the wheel and then it picks one
80:36 - randomly and I have you kahlil's a
80:38 - little flat and I would then oh sorry
80:46 - let me do that again sorry I started
80:47 - looking at the chat
80:50 - so I used to do this and I would have a
80:53 - bunch of options and then it would pick
80:55 - one and I would then try to do that as
80:58 - the coding challenge and work fell off I
81:07 - wasn't sure what the pic I'd like put
81:08 - this away and today I was been listening
81:10 - to this podcast where the podcast has a
81:14 - wheel I've never seen it because I'm
81:17 - just listening to the podcast but they
81:18 - spin it I think there's a website
81:19 - actually where they have the wheel I
81:20 - think it's called it's called rob and a
81:22 - Kiva a podcast like that look it up
81:25 - maybe we can build them like some
81:27 - software tool for their wheel if they
81:29 - don't think they already have one but at
81:31 - the end of each podcast they spin the
81:33 - wheel for the topic for the next one and
81:36 - it occurred to me that that's the
81:38 - missing piece for me and they have like
81:41 - a wheel they have a wheel waiting room
81:43 - they have rejected ideas so I feel like
81:45 - what I did today was my little exercise
81:47 - of like things that could make it on to
81:50 - the wheel like this is a list of topics
81:53 - that if I spun the wheel and it landed
81:56 - on one I could be willing to commit to
81:58 - doing it the following week so in other
82:01 - words instead of like having this list
82:03 - and being surprised by the topic I would
82:05 - pick it in advance I'm not saying that I
82:09 - would I'm and so I would do somewhere in
82:11 - between like going and programming the
82:13 - whole thing like all week and then just
82:15 - coming in coding it live and no
82:17 - preparation whatsoever I think that no
82:19 - preparation whatsoever gets me into a
82:21 - little bit of trouble with some of these
82:23 - topics like for example Delauney
82:25 - triangulation no preparation whatsoever
82:27 - is totally fine for me for like ASCII
82:29 - art probably for the Mara Rose you can
82:32 - potentially break out some of these but
82:34 - some of these that require some research
82:36 - and thinking so I would do a little bit
82:38 - of research and thinking and reading and
82:40 - prepare not code but I prepare little
82:43 - materials and then I would come and do
82:45 - it as a coding challenge so what I
82:47 - proposed I was gonna do this I think I
82:49 - don't have time I was actually gonna do
82:50 - a coding job today which was like
82:52 - program a wheel spinner and then we as a
82:55 - community could like make it and I would
82:57 - have several different JSON files that
82:59 - would be
83:01 - and maybe I should do this actually that
83:03 - would be like the wheel topics the wheel
83:05 - waiting room and there could be certain
83:06 - things like we could get really crazy
83:09 - with this where there's like one thing
83:11 - on the wheel is like actually a separate
83:13 - pick something random out like it could
83:15 - be there could be like a game spot so
83:17 - maybe there's like a larger spot that
83:18 - just gains and then when it lands on
83:20 - games I would pick a you know ping-pong
83:22 - ball out of a bucket that I don't know
83:24 - what the next metaphor is or the next
83:27 - visual like that I would pick you know
83:29 - breakout Tetris or pac-man or whatever
83:32 - so and then and I don't know that I
83:35 - would do a wheel spin every single week
83:37 - because some coding challenges would
83:40 - require a full live stream some coding
83:42 - challenges can be done to 15 to 20
83:44 - minutes hahaha and then other weeks I
83:48 - really want to be going through my con
83:51 - and machine learning content for my
83:52 - course so it's gonna be hard to balance
83:54 - all of this but that's kind of my plan
83:57 - right now and if I can get this other
84:00 - way that making videos off the ground
84:02 - I might actually mostly do the coding
84:04 - challenges through that mechanism which
84:07 - is a way of doing a little home studio
84:09 - that I'm sort of setting up it's
84:11 - currently there's no electricity in it
84:13 - little little T's are there for you so I
84:16 - think live streaming will be kind of an
84:17 - issue but you know I can record a video
84:20 - with the extent that my battery will
84:23 - last it sounds very ominous I know but
84:25 - you'll see you'll see coming soon all
84:30 - right so I don't know what people think
84:33 - about this is Dan who is sighs so sighs
84:36 - spelled CY and they are the community
84:40 - manager for the coding train working on
84:42 - social media and communication with the
84:46 - patrons and members and helping me set
84:48 - up this new merchandise store and also
84:51 - special rewards for patrons okay
84:55 - all right so ah thank you perfect timing
85:01 - the list to the contributions thank you
85:06 - David the chiming couldn't be more
85:08 - impeccable bit dot ly
85:14 - to an m4 KY q TMC writes spinning wheel
85:20 - is lazy I'm not sure I fully understand
85:23 - that I'm not sure if like you mean like
85:26 - I should do something more interesting
85:27 - than a wheel spin but no I actually
85:29 - would love to have a big physical wheel
85:31 - that's what I really want I'm not good
85:33 - at making physical things
85:36 - well this work did I type this in
85:38 - correctly awesome so um thank you I'm
85:41 - David Schneider a member coding trained
85:44 - member who prepared this so in the time
85:47 - people have been submitting
85:49 - contributions to the website and by the
85:51 - way coding trained community
85:57 - contributions there if you don't know
86:03 - what I'm talking about or how to do that
86:04 - you can find this video which is only 12
86:07 - minutes long which is shocking for me
86:09 - which is describes how to go through the
86:14 - process of submitting your contribution
86:15 - to the coding training website oh I know
86:16 - what I'm going to use the wheel for
86:18 - right now
86:18 - this is perfect oh this is great okay
86:21 - hold on I've got a plan 6:30 this is not
86:27 - a plan that can be accomplished in 30
86:29 - minutes but this is what I'm thinking
86:32 - I'm going to do a coding challenge which
86:36 - is make a spinning wheel yeah yeah I
86:37 - know it could be like a bingo machine
86:38 - I'll get to that
86:42 - and then I'll spin the wheel to pick a
86:46 - number and show some community
86:50 - contributions and then I'll try to make
86:52 - a ukulele tuner and yes I'll go set the
86:55 - point of the ukulele tuner would be to
86:56 - have a visual a visual to show you that
86:58 - you know this is a note I want it to be
87:00 - this is how far off I am okay
87:09 - [Music]
87:21 - okay
87:27 - so how do I want to do this I have this
87:34 - already as the thing I could also just
87:36 - use random org to pick a random number
87:38 - say the wheelspin is a little bit crazy
87:40 - because there's 78 so a so a bingo
87:43 - machine would be better the wheel needs
87:47 - to make a spinning wheel noise
87:48 - definitely definitely does how did how
87:56 - to approach this right now I need to
88:03 - think
88:05 - [Music]
88:17 - I'm not gonna read them okay it's just
88:20 - gonna fix up treating them to myself is
88:25 - it weird that I'm not reading them out
88:26 - loud now I'm not even thinking cuz I'm
88:28 - thinking about how it's weird they're
88:29 - not reading them out loud
88:29 - I did the Plinko machine before which
88:39 - kind of works for this I like the idea
88:42 - of a bucket full of compart five for
88:46 - your blinker challenge with numbers yeah
88:49 - Simon and I think alike
88:52 - prize wheel an Amazon fairly cheap bingo
88:55 - machines too but they're more spending
88:57 - money is no object for me if I could get
88:59 - myself a bingo machine whatsoever I will
89:04 - spend all of my patreon money on a bingo
89:08 - machine for sure that is not a not even
89:13 - a question
89:15 - you have to read them out loud okay good
89:18 - point all right what if I did one of
89:26 - those um prices right things right now
89:30 - well welcome to member Luke Finch where
89:33 - you like to pull down the big thing and
89:35 - it like spins around I could do that
89:40 - probably in processing see this is why I
89:46 - need a plan I can't just come here and
89:49 - expect to come up with the idea in my
89:51 - mind
89:52 - spin the wheel bingo spin wheel pling
89:55 - pling Co Co - dice rolling oh that's an
90:00 - interesting idea
90:01 - dice rolling that sounds like a very
90:03 - elaborate physics simulation though
90:06 - that's not within my realm of
90:08 - possibility right now can I just gonna
90:10 - do the ukulele tuner let's do the
90:12 - ukulele tuner let's let's do the ukulele
90:17 - tuner so by the way all of you who are
90:19 - joining actually a very curious question
90:22 - when you join as a Youtube member in
90:24 - theory are supposed to be taken to a
90:26 - screen that has a little like welcome
90:27 - message with a link to a Google for
90:29 - did that happen if not please email CY
90:34 - at the coding train calm okay don't
90:38 - think you have time to make something
90:40 - tonight I know I could do a spinning
90:43 - wheel I feel like that's like a quick
90:45 - thing it's like everybody always wonders
90:46 - how our quirks nice beginner-friendly
90:48 - coding challenge we're gonna make a
90:49 - spinning wheel an ad so what I can put I
90:53 - could divide it into 78 little slices
90:56 - right or I could pick random numbers
90:59 - another way it's sorry K week - actually
91:07 - I believe it's not coding train com
91:09 - I don't think I have coding train comm
91:14 - coding train comm is listed for sale so
91:25 - I would totally spend $1,000 on a bingo
91:27 - machine but I'm not spending it on a
91:29 - domain name that's just ridiculous
91:32 - give me a break duh the dye is very
91:39 - important it makes it sound important I
91:40 - am the coding train I'm not coding drink
91:43 - I am the coding train what are people in
91:45 - the hallway can just hear me you just
91:47 - hear me in the hallway probably it's
91:50 - gonna say choo choo in the chat you know
91:52 - that I'm gonna do it okay um all right
91:55 - it was pretty fluffy okay once for tens
92:00 - and ones for you the wheel snowflake
92:08 - emoji I'm trying understand what that
92:10 - means I'm definitely a snowflake if you
92:15 - pre chose the value reverse simulated
92:17 - the wheel Luke your math is missing an
92:24 - important piece of there's a certain
92:26 - percentage which is mine
92:30 - I'm listening from the hallway John
92:32 - Walthall your name has a hall in it
92:37 - that's believable but I'm gonna need a
92:39 - little proof but need you to knock on
92:41 - the door
92:42 - if you're in the hallway but I need you
92:44 - to knock on the door okay this sitting
92:52 - around trying to decide is no good we're
92:54 - gonna make a ukulele tuner and see how
92:56 - that goes
93:11 - no no crap is it look at my password
93:20 - manager I can't remember how come I'm
93:22 - not logged in anymore
93:23 - oh wait it was like trying to dashlane
93:25 - me in right oh but I don't know what
93:27 - that is okay what am I looking for
93:42 - yes my password manager
94:01 - really
94:08 - hmm
94:13 - all right I guess I forgot my password
94:18 - uh I can only assume this is the email I
94:22 - used does it send it
94:33 - see how unprepared I am now I'm gonna
94:36 - look at my email this is ridiculous okay
94:40 - I got an email reset my password oh I
94:50 - remember what I made it now because I
94:53 - didn't actually like do it with my
94:55 - password manager
95:07 - [Music]
95:32 - [Music]
95:59 - and this should be good enough okay I am
96:12 - going to do a coding challenge how's the
96:15 - focus am I out of focus is this okay
96:19 - what do I have - I have the noise thing
96:22 - on I'm gonna turn that off because if
96:26 - this gets edited into a coding challenge
96:29 - it's off okay then then we can always no
96:35 - run like a noise suppression thing after
96:37 - the fact okay I'm also gonna need I
96:47 - remember like when I first by the way
96:48 - this is the second attempt at this long
96:50 - time ago and it totally didn't work at
96:52 - all but there was like a frequency to
96:55 - piano note like Wiki Wikipedia page I
96:57 - think I looked at piano key frequencies
97:00 - which I'm going to need and there's like
97:04 - a formula for it but I can also just
97:07 - look up the actual frequency here great
97:15 - so this is what I'm looking for the
97:18 - ukulele would be which the ukulele is
97:23 - ukelele notes are no I want the notes
97:31 - for the strings
97:36 - it's gonna give me a nice yeah
97:41 - AEC G and this is gonna probably be like
97:44 - a four is that right someone's got to
97:48 - know this where's that 440 that's what
97:54 - I'm guessing uh okay all right focus is
98:04 - good okay thanks everybody by the way
98:07 - just another little plug coating garden
98:10 - with CJ has had a ton of content I did I
98:13 - get notifications on fication boyfriend
98:15 - using something called like feather J s
98:17 - I've never even heard of that go check
98:19 - out the coding garden with CJ I've been
98:22 - not live streaming forever and but
98:23 - there's so much happening on the
98:25 - Internet okay
98:31 - [Music]
98:51 - [Music]
99:00 - just try to think of what's a good
99:01 - opening for this coding challenge
99:06 - hello and welcome to a coding train
99:09 - coding challenge this is my first kind
99:10 - of challenge in this new coding trade
99:12 - studio oh my goodness but my ukulele is
99:16 - very out of tune and I actually have a
99:18 - ukulele tuner but the battery's dead
99:22 - so I thought here we are let's see if we
99:24 - can make a ukulele tuner in the browser
99:29 - using p5 GS and ml 5 j s voice just got
99:37 - lost right so
99:47 - Oh editing is a wonderful thing to do
99:54 - this I'm going to use ml 5gs library
99:56 - which is a machine learning library that
99:58 - I've used in tutorials and various other
100:00 - coding challenges it's built on top of
100:02 - tensorflow GIS and it is friendly it is
100:07 - I would start the whole thing over this
100:10 - is just like the old days
100:11 - I get to do this as many times as I want
100:15 - see this is a paintbrush which was used
100:20 - to paint this wall behind me hello and
100:33 - welcome to a coda challenge oh that is
100:36 - terribly out of tune this coding
100:37 - challenge is making a ukulele tuner and
100:40 - it is the first coding challenge that
100:42 - I'm doing here in this new coding train
100:44 - studio I like it better the first time
100:55 - to 12th root of 2 to the power of the
100:59 - number of half-steps yes yes I can
101:02 - barely play a guitar all right here we
101:04 - go last time no more breaks no more
101:06 - stops
101:07 - this is ridiculous that I do this I have
101:09 - to not do this anymore this is my new
101:10 - year's the new studio resolution is no
101:13 - second takes editing is fine
101:16 - editing is fine just no second takes
101:21 - [Music]
101:25 - hi oh hello that was loud hello and
101:30 - welcome to a coding challenge from the
101:32 - coding train it sounds better than the
101:37 - other room I'm glad to hear that there's
101:39 - no echo in here and I actually have
101:41 - carpeting that I'm planning to put down
101:42 - which isn't put down yet but once it is
101:44 - it will be okay I'm back with a coding
101:50 - challenge oh and my ukulele is very out
101:53 - of tune I'm in a new studio the tuning
101:56 - of the ukulele did not last in the move
101:57 - to the new studio and the battery and my
102:00 - Glalie tuner is dead you don't need to
102:02 - know all this information so I thought
102:04 - what's a better opportunity than to do
102:06 - at coding Johnson I've been wanting to
102:07 - do for a while which is make a ukulele
102:10 - tuner that would work in the browser and
102:11 - so to do that I am going to use some
102:16 - JavaScript libraries that I use in a lot
102:18 - of different videos one is ml5 j s ml
102:21 - five is a machine learning library built
102:23 - on top of tensorflow JS it has a lot of
102:26 - pre trained models in it one of which is
102:28 - a pitch detection model I think I could
102:29 - use that to to the ukulele I hope we'll
102:32 - see how well it works and then I'm also
102:34 - going to use p5.js
102:36 - and this is the p5 GS web editor I'm
102:38 - gonna try programming the whole thing
102:39 - right here in the browser and see what
102:42 - happens so what do I need to do so I
102:45 - guess the first thing that I should do
102:48 - is import the ml 5 library so I'm gonna
102:51 - go to getting started oh look at this
102:54 - actually the easiest way for me to do
102:56 - this is just click on this link which
102:58 - makes a p5 web better sketch with the ml
103:00 - 5 just library added so I'm gonna do
103:03 - that and I'm gonna go back over here and
103:06 - I'm gonna click over here and then over
103:08 - here and I'm gonna hit save I'm gonna
103:09 - run it and make sure it's happening
103:11 - there it is so ml 5 has now been loaded
103:14 - we can see the version is zero point
103:15 - three point zero since there are zero
103:17 - point three point one I think there's a
103:18 - slightly newer release let's check that
103:21 - out who knows you're probably watching
103:22 - this when sometime in the future where
103:24 - we don't keep track of open source
103:26 - software by numbers anymore this is
103:29 - release rainbow
103:41 - but yes my suspicion was right there's
103:44 - actually a version zero point three
103:47 - point one so let me go and update that
103:51 - by changing it here hiding the point one
103:54 - this is very important that this is in
103:56 - this coding challenge you must learn to
103:58 - update your amplify version when you are
104:00 - making a ukulele tuner and then I'm
104:02 - gonna I don't need this console log
104:04 - anymore although I guess I could try it
104:05 - one more time just to sort of see there
104:07 - we go
104:07 - and for a minute just because I'm kind
104:13 - of standing in front of stuff and I
104:14 - don't have it set up - I'm planning to
104:19 - record everything with these separate
104:21 - green and separate background but I'm
104:23 - not ready to do that just yet so I'm
104:25 - just going to do a screen recording so I
104:26 - have that just in case at some point
104:29 - match up if Ed 'its is together needs to
104:31 - take me out of this
104:33 - so I'm now recording the screen okay
104:42 - thanks Marcos all right all right where
104:48 - was I so now that I have my p5 sketch
104:57 - here I can go back to the ml 5 website
104:59 - I'm gonna go to reference and here we
105:02 - can see one of the things about ml 5 is
105:04 - all of the different functions that are
105:05 - in ml 5 are separated by media category
105:08 - there's this other category called
105:09 - helpers and boy do I have some videos
105:11 - coming up about that for you someday
105:13 - soon I'm gonna go to sound and I'm gonna
105:15 - look at this pitch detection one so
105:17 - here's the documentation time out hold
105:22 - on a second what
105:31 - just curious when I there's a little
105:35 - there's a mistake here I just realized I
105:37 - think everyone I had the pitch detection
105:39 - one going oh I have to upload the model
105:48 - that's crazy so that's a mistake the
105:51 - model isn't hosted all right let's see
105:57 - here I didn't realize this was gonna be
105:59 - a little extra layer of complexity I
106:02 - need to figure this out before I go any
106:06 - further
106:08 - [Music]
106:15 - here it is here it is okay great
106:24 - so let me just
106:32 - I don't know how big this is so let me
106:33 - just download the oh you can't see I'm
106:35 - really not standing in the right place
106:37 - the camera I need to do something about
106:40 - the where everything is this should
106:43 - actually I think I should be putting the
106:45 - sounds on the other side of me but it's
106:49 - not really easy for me to do that right
106:51 - now
106:53 - I'll leave that here
106:57 - I'm downloading this huge thing this is
107:00 - ridiculous it's at 38% so I can plug
107:03 - this right now see I'm just so out of
107:09 - practice here there we go this is what I
107:15 - wanted to do the stream deck can be over
107:20 - here oh you know I'm such an idiot
107:25 - I could just move the desk over and like
107:29 - there's no room to the right of the
107:31 - computer for anything yeah
107:34 - how about moving the desk dum-dum
107:46 - okay hold on everybody now I have my
107:53 - sound effects and my stream deck and I'm
107:56 - standing over here and I'm more to the
107:58 - side I'm bigger than I used to be people
108:01 - told me when I was doing a test that I
108:03 - was too small but now I think I'm too
108:05 - big okay okay
108:50 - okay
108:52 - to this download
109:41 - okay sorry everyone I think I am back to
109:45 - what I was doing it's very confusing the
109:55 - camera is like a little bit there we go
109:56 - ah I think this works for me now I'm
109:59 - like I just have to angle myself a
110:00 - little bit okay but it's the desk now
110:04 - and the whiteboard camera shot good
110:06 - question
110:07 - no it is not the whiteboard camera shot
110:12 - does not start until right about here
110:14 - which if I go back is you know pretty
110:20 - far off okay should I just start the
110:25 - whole thing over I should definitely
110:26 - start the whole thing over right yes
110:27 - right exactly that's what I think - I'm
110:31 - so glad we agree on this
110:54 - okay here we go
110:58 - yeah I really would like to have a
111:00 - roaming camera in this room because then
111:03 - I could then I could I could like show
111:11 - you the stuff in the room but another
111:13 - time okay I think it was better to have
111:32 - this up
111:41 - non FFT pitch finder revisit yeah
111:43 - there's there's many other ways to do
111:45 - pitch detection but whatever I'm gonna
111:46 - do it this way oh my you clearly is very
111:55 - out of tune what luck this happens to be
111:57 - the make a ukulele tuner coding
111:59 - challenge what a coincidence I'm here in
112:02 - my new studio located it's not my studio
112:05 - but it is a studio it's in Brooklyn at
112:08 - New York University and I'm doing my
112:09 - first coding challenge from here um I I
112:12 - don't really know what makes sense that
112:13 - I just like if this is a moment to do
112:15 - some sort of particular coding challenge
112:17 - I don't know I'm just gonna do go to the
112:19 - ukulele because the tuner I have the
112:21 - batteries broken my ears not so good so
112:23 - we'll see if this works I'm gonna use
112:25 - the ML v JS library this is a JavaScript
112:28 - library that I'm lucky enough to
112:30 - participate in its development and I try
112:32 - to make tutorials with so this works
112:34 - well it has a pre trained model for
112:37 - pitch detection which I'll talk about in
112:38 - a moment and then I'm also going to use
112:41 - the p5 web editors a little tricky to do
112:44 - this in the p5 web editor because it
112:45 - could involve I'm going to upload a
112:47 - bunch of stuff but the good news is I
112:49 - already have the ml 5 library right here
112:53 - all you need to do if you want if you're
112:55 - in the p5 web editor at editor dot p5.js
112:57 - dot org
112:59 - if you go to the ml 5 website under
113:02 - getting started you'll see that all you
113:05 - need to do is either add this script tag
113:07 - or even better you can see that here
113:11 - where is that where is it where is it
113:13 - where is it there it is sorry should
113:16 - just started with this all you need to
113:17 - do is click on this link which will open
113:20 - a web app a sketch in the p5 web editor
113:22 - with the ml 5 library already important
113:24 - ok
113:24 - so we're there I could make sure this is
113:27 - working by saying something like you
113:29 - know console.log ml v dot version I'm
113:33 - going to hit run and I see the version
113:36 - down here so I've got ml 5 going now
113:39 - what do I need to do next so if I go to
113:42 - the ml 5 website I'm going to go to a
113:44 - reference and in reference I can see
113:46 - that the various functionality of ml 5
113:48 - is divided into different categories
113:50 - based on media and what I definitely
113:52 - want to do is look at sound here
113:53 - I want to find a sound model and lo lo
113:57 - and behold there is a model called pitch
113:58 - detection now I should mention that
114:00 - there are ways of analyzing a sound for
114:05 - pitch but you don't need machine
114:07 - learning for I'm you can do FFT analysis
114:09 - and look at the different various
114:11 - amplitudes of different frequencies and
114:13 - pick the one that's left there's a
114:14 - variety of ways in people much smarter
114:16 - who know much more about sound could
114:18 - tell you how to do that and I'm sure you
114:20 - can find other tutorials but I'm here I
114:21 - want to try to use the ml 5 library but
114:24 - this really begs the question like well
114:25 - how is this working you said something
114:27 - about pre trained model so ml 5 is comes
114:31 - with a certain model known as crepe I
114:34 - don't know if that's how you pronounce
114:35 - that I like to say clip which is a
114:38 - convolutional representation for a pitch
114:41 - estimation or clip I like fruit little
114:45 - banana maybe a little Nutella it's kind
114:47 - of good I don't know it's too much for
114:49 - me then to tell us this is about pitch
114:51 - detection and so you can read a lot more
114:55 - about this particular model and what
114:58 - data was used to train it which is
115:00 - always a question you should ask when
115:01 - you're using someone's pre trained model
115:03 - because there's a lot of things that go
115:04 - wrong or right or be problematic
115:07 - potentially about a model based on the
115:08 - data it was trained and this paper
115:11 - describes that in more detail you can
115:13 - even run this demo in the browser I'll
115:15 - do it right now
115:17 - let me not allowed I don't know why it's
115:21 - not allowing my microphone oh here we go
115:22 - let me tweak yeah yeah I'm gonna always
115:26 - allow and I'm gonna hit refresh I'm
115:34 - gonna click here to start the demo I
115:39 - cannot do anything
115:47 - [Music]
115:50 - well this this is really a fail
115:55 - all right let's skip that let's not you
115:59 - oldest about a big magic yo I'm not
116:01 - starting over again you could click on
116:04 - this link over here to see a demo of it
116:06 - in the browser but we're gonna do this
116:08 - in ml 5 and thank you a big THANK YOU to
116:11 - Hannah Davis who actually did the
116:13 - porting of this model into ml 5 and I'll
116:16 - include some links to her work in this
116:17 - video's description ok so here I am on
116:21 - the ml 5 documentation page and it looks
116:24 - a little bit like yeah what's going on
116:26 - here so I need to create a pitch object
116:29 - and there's some sort of like string dot
116:32 - slash model what's that audio context
116:35 - mic stream model loaded slot stuff I
116:37 - need to figure out here well the first
116:39 - thing I want to figure out is all right
116:44 - well I see I should now I'm looking over
116:46 - here and I see the chat and real cygnus
116:49 - is asking what's just asking not
116:50 - criticizing didn't he use this little
116:52 - while ago and it didn't go over well yes
116:53 - and have I done
116:55 - how am i taking the time to check to see
116:57 - if it would go well this time no but
116:59 - here we go I think it's gonna work
117:00 - because the bugs that I found last time
117:02 - got fixed we'll see the first thing I
117:07 - want to tackle here is what this dot
117:09 - model is so a lot of times when using ml
117:12 - 5 it's going to load the model files
117:15 - from a URL and you might actually put
117:17 - the URL into your code or ml 5 might
117:20 - just know the URL automatically it's
117:22 - saved on a Google server or some other
117:24 - server and ml 5 it's saved on github and
117:27 - like pointed to by ml 5 in this case
117:29 - this is a case where I actually need to
117:31 - have the model files with my code this
117:34 - was probably gonna change just by making
117:36 - this video i browse we probably should
117:37 - host a version of the creped model that
117:39 - you could access through ml 5 more
117:41 - easily but luckily if I go to the ml 5
117:46 - data and models github repo where I am
117:50 - right here github.com / ml 5 j s I can
117:53 - navigate to models pitch detection CREP
117:56 - and these are all the model files so
117:58 - this is very typical of any pre-trained
118:00 - machine learning model they'll be a JSON
118:02 - file the
118:03 - is essentially the file that describes
118:06 - the model oh this is the neural network
118:09 - architecture these are all the pieces of
118:10 - it I could actually even click in this
118:12 - and start to like look at it you can see
118:14 - it's the model topology what it's using
118:16 - various things like that we you know
118:18 - investigate this more on your own and
118:20 - then there's all these other files which
118:23 - are the actual weights the numbers the
118:25 - sort of secret sauce of the model after
118:27 - it's been trained all of those little
118:28 - parameters of the neural network are all
118:30 - stored in all these files now I've
118:31 - actually downloaded all of these already
118:34 - and you can see them they're right here
118:36 - in a folder on the desktop here so what
118:38 - I want to do right now is add all of
118:40 - them to the p5 web editor let's see how
118:42 - that goes normal I've really only worked
118:44 - with like uploading like little media
118:46 - files and sound files but I think this
118:48 - is gonna work so I'm gonna go here I'm
118:49 - gonna create a new chart for you to see
118:51 - this but I'm gonna create a new folder
118:53 - and I'm gonna call this crops up and
118:58 - then I'm gonna do add file and I'm
119:01 - hoping that I could just select all of
119:03 - these and drag them here oh oh whoa I'm
119:18 - not plugged in anymore
119:27 - you can't upload files of this type that
119:30 - is definitely a problem so how did that
119:35 - other oh I have a feeling that the way
119:45 - this was uploaded was like through a
119:46 - secret backdoor to the web editor will
119:52 - that work no no don't I have a better
119:54 - idea no better idea better idea so the
119:59 - fact that they're here
120:01 - sorry here means that I can turn this
120:04 - into a J s deliver right because J s
120:09 - deliver and github work together no this
120:14 - is not where I want to look don't you
120:16 - love how everything always goes wrong
120:19 - there's a way to turn any github repo
120:22 - into a CDN like this so I should be able
120:29 - to do j s liver github ml v j s repo
120:48 - ml5 data and models and then just the
120:55 - path so if I do pitch detection crepe
121:02 - model JSON to see pitch detection crepe
121:10 - model JSON
121:23 - yes whatever reason the lighting in here
121:25 - of share life is pointing out my gray
121:28 - hair the old lighting used to really
121:30 - like obscure the gray of my hair I don't
121:32 - know why but it's looked much more
121:34 - visible in here you know it's it's
121:36 - distinguished package size exceeded the
121:40 - configurate limit of 50 megabytes try
121:45 - what but the model dot JSON file isn't
121:49 - 50 megabytes is it it's 16 kilobytes
121:52 - these are tiny files doesn't make any
121:55 - sense oh the whole I forgot models okay
122:05 - thank you
122:08 - Thank You Simon models I think right
122:11 - here right yeah boom all right now let's
122:15 - see just curious I'm gonna grab the
122:23 - example
122:31 - I'm sure this is once again I could just
122:36 - do this like locally and then oh are you
122:43 - serious says it loaded the model trouble
122:49 - believing it no it didn't load I got an
122:54 - error hold on
123:03 - yeah 4:03 what's in error 403
123:17 - I mean it's not gonna work it doesn't
123:21 - host it like this does it huh did that
123:29 - actually work
123:38 - oh wow that works
123:41 - oh great so I could just use the URL to
123:46 - it Oh silly me
123:48 - I'm going to back up here okay okay
124:05 - okay I think this is couple have no
124:08 - viewers left thank you for sticking with
124:10 - me in this we're gonna get there okay
124:22 - where am i where am i where am i it's
124:27 - here so if I go back to add file I'm
124:39 - just gonna do this again to like cuz
124:41 - this is where I left off
124:57 - so I forgot that the web editor
125:00 - currently only supports certain file
125:02 - types like JSON or CSV or a JPEG image
125:08 - files sound files so these model files
125:10 - that include all the weights that can't
125:12 - be uploaded to the web editor that's
125:13 - something that might change in the
125:14 - future but luckily I can actually I can
125:20 - actually just point to the model files
125:22 - that are on github itself so this
125:25 - particular URL right here where all
125:28 - these model files are stored there's
125:31 - actually a way to turn any file that's
125:35 - sitting on github
125:37 - into a URL that you can load like from
125:39 - from a content delivery network and so a
125:42 - way of doing if this is a nice blog post
125:44 - that I found on go make things calm that
125:47 - just shows this base URL so I can always
125:51 - access files through this URL cdnas
125:55 - deliver net /gh for github and then the
125:58 - path to the username the repo and the
126:00 - path to the files so I actually have
126:02 - done that right here I'm gonna hit
126:04 - refresh and you can see look this is
126:07 - that model dot JSON file and now I can
126:10 - actually look and see oh it's all of the
126:12 - configuration information about this
126:14 - particular model and I can grab this and
126:17 - I can put this into my code so let me
126:20 - close this I'm gonna go to the top I'm
126:22 - gonna say Const model URL equals and I'm
126:26 - gonna paste that in there so now and
126:28 - then I actually want just the path
126:30 - because I want the model to load all the
126:32 - files so I'm going to then remove model
126:35 - JSON and this is the path to the CREP
126:38 - model and I can go ahead and just delete
126:40 - this from here this folder it's gone I
126:43 - guess I need to also delete the files
126:45 - one at a time let me do that and now I
126:49 - am ready to start putting in some code
126:51 - so I'm going to make a variable called
126:54 - pitch detector let's just call it pitch
126:57 - I'm gonna say pitch equals ml five pitch
127:00 - detection let me give myself some more
127:02 - space
127:04 - pitch detection I'm going to go back to
127:08 - the reference page and these are the
127:11 - things that I need to load so let me
127:13 - copy paste these are the parameters that
127:15 - I need to pass in name is here
127:32 - Oh
127:42 - I'm sitting here wondering why I have an
127:44 - error and of course if I declare a
127:46 - variable as a contest I can't just have
127:49 - it not equal anything and then assign it
127:51 - later so this is gonna have to be let
127:52 - and I'm gonna make a lot of people angry
127:54 - right now by making everything let just
127:56 - to sort of like simplify things and now
127:59 - I have the I've now created a pitch
128:04 - detection object now what I want is to
128:07 - give it a bunch of arguments to create
128:10 - itself one of which is the model itself
128:13 - so this is no longer a local directory
128:16 - of files I'm going to say model URL I
128:20 - need to get this audio context in Mike's
128:23 - stream let me come back to that but I
128:25 - also need a model loaded function so
128:28 - that I know that the model has been
128:32 - loaded I can't type there we go
128:40 - all right so audio context and Mike
128:43 - stream what are those things well let's
128:45 - hope the documentation tells us audio
128:48 - context the browser audio context to use
128:51 - hmm
128:53 - stream media stream the media stream to
128:56 - use I'm a little bit lost to be honest
129:00 - but can I get some more information you
129:02 - know what I think we might do here is
129:04 - let's just look at the example so the
129:06 - example here if I look at the example
129:08 - code it's showing that ah perfect so an
129:11 - audio context I could just get by saying
129:14 - get audio context perfect so this
129:17 - happens to be something that's built
129:18 - into JavaScript it's part of the Web
129:20 - Audio API I would assume and I'm sure
129:23 - somebody in the chatter or somebody will
129:25 - leave a comment to explain what this is
129:27 - a little bit more but I'm just gonna go
129:29 - ahead and put it in here I'm gonna say
129:31 - audio context equals get audio context
129:36 - and then for the mic stream this is
129:40 - actually me connecting to the built-in
129:43 - microphone or potentially I could
129:45 - specify a different microphone and that
129:47 - I'm going to connect by using the p5
129:49 - sound library so I can make a variable
129:52 - called mic and then I could say mic
129:54 - equals
129:54 - p5 audio-in I believe is the function so
129:59 - this is the function this is part of p5
130:01 - sound KS which incidentally is a library
130:04 - that I have accessing here in index.html
130:07 - look at this I am on such an old version
130:10 - of p5 let's update this stuff I think
130:13 - the current version is 9.0 so while I'm
130:16 - here I'm gonna update that go back to
130:19 - here and then I think I can get this mic
130:22 - stream from the p5 mic object I'll just
130:25 - look it up here Mike dot stream perfect
130:29 - so this p5 audio and I need to say Mike
130:31 - dot start start pitch Mars I don't see
130:37 - any function Oh aah Oh interesting look
130:39 - at this so I wasn't paying close
130:41 - attention I didn't really I didn't
130:44 - really think what I'm doing because it's
130:45 - I got to do two things here I need to
130:48 - load them I need to access the
130:49 - microphone and I need to load the model
130:52 - when I load the model I want to connect
130:54 - it to the microphone and maybe I need to
130:55 - think about the sequence going on here
130:57 - because as you know if you've done
130:59 - programming or watched a kodi train
131:01 - video before things in JavaScript have
131:03 - an asynchronously so maybe I don't need
131:05 - to do it this way that's in the example
131:06 - but I probably do let's try to do it not
131:09 - the way that's in the example and see if
131:10 - it works
131:10 - it's probably gonna break without being
131:12 - thoughtful about the order so I'm just
131:14 - gonna say Mike dot stream right now then
131:18 - I'm gonna say Mike dot start and I'm
131:20 - gonna have a callback like listening and
131:24 - then I'll write a function called
131:27 - listening and I'll say console.log
131:31 - listen I'm gonna take off this auto
131:33 - refresh because it's doing crazy stuff
131:35 - listening
131:41 - okay here we go so let me uncaught
131:43 - syntax error invalid or unexpected token
131:45 - line 20 what I don't see any invalid
131:48 - token lying Ted listening
131:52 - can I read property start of undefined
131:54 - there we go so this is an issue cannot
132:03 - read property start of undefined why is
132:06 - the mic undefined let's go back to the
132:10 - example new new I forgot to say new so
132:17 - the new keyword is very important when
132:20 - you are calling a constructor to create
132:22 - an object you're required to say new
132:26 - there's something really interesting
132:27 - that's going on here which is that I
132:29 - need the new here new p5 audio in but
132:35 - how come I'm not saying new ml5 pitch
132:37 - detection Oh do you know why it's
132:40 - because people like to do things in
132:42 - different ways this is actually a little
132:44 - bit more standard from what I understand
132:46 - in the world of JavaScript this is not
132:48 - actually calling an object constructor a
132:51 - little clue to that is the lowercase P
132:53 - right there this is calling a function
132:55 - that's part of the ml 5 library the
132:57 - function itself calls an object
133:00 - constructor but you actually don't bend
133:02 - and the new happens in there but our
133:04 - interface to it as the user of the
133:06 - library we just called a pitch detection
133:08 - function that's why I have sometimes I
133:10 - say these are the list of functions in
133:12 - p5 instead of like the LEAs or the list
133:14 - of objects or classes but this is
133:16 - actually calling the p5 audio-in
133:17 - constructor all right let's see if that
133:21 - fixed things
133:23 - all right listening model loaded that's
133:26 - promising
133:26 - so it was happy it seems to be happy
133:29 - with the order that I'm doing things in
133:31 - now right the order of the example is to
133:34 - make sure the mic has started and then
133:36 - load the model but this doesn't seem so
133:38 - upset maybe it's going to work
133:44 - okay and it's in pausing for a second to
133:49 - think about what I'm doing next okay so
133:57 - what's the next step well what I want to
133:59 - do just from just to get this working is
134:02 - that the pitch is going to come in as a
134:04 - real number a frequency value so I just
134:06 - want to draw that frequency value in the
134:08 - canvas so how do I get it presumably
134:11 - there's some callback there's a callback
134:13 - model loaded but I need to actually tell
134:16 - it to listen so let's go back to the I
134:18 - could look at the example but let's look
134:19 - at the documentation pitch get pitch and
134:22 - here's a callback so this is what I want
134:24 - to do this is like the function that I
134:27 - call to ask for a pitch and then when it
134:31 - hears something it console logs it so I
134:34 - should be able to do this in the model
134:36 - loaded function I'm gonna say pitch get
134:39 - pitch and then I'm gonna write a
134:40 - function called got pitch because I'm
134:42 - trying to do this in a very long-winded
134:44 - highly descriptive way where I now have
134:47 - a separate function called got pitch and
134:50 - then it receives an argument like
134:52 - frequency and I'm going to actually draw
134:55 - that well no let's just console.log it
134:57 - console.log frequency okay
135:01 - let's run this bottle loaded because I
135:09 - make some eyes all right here we go la
135:14 - pitch frequency it is not working at all
135:25 - well I got an error could not fail to XD
135:31 - all right this is not working because it
135:34 - failed to execute create media stream
135:38 - source on the audio context parameter
135:40 - one is not of type media stream I have a
135:44 - feeling that this is the problem right I
135:47 - did things out of the order now is the
135:50 - problem assuming the order is the
135:51 - problem so I need to make sure the
135:53 - microphone is ready before I start
135:55 - trying to load them on
135:56 - so in this sense let's try to re let's
136:00 - try to redo this order so Mike audio in
136:05 - Mic start listening once I am listening
136:10 - then I will load the model then once the
136:14 - model is loaded I will call get pitch
136:17 - got pitch if I look at the documentation
136:20 - get pitch oh oh oh wah-wah-wah I forgot
136:27 - something else really important I can
136:29 - never remember this I don't know why ml
136:32 - 5 functions callbacks are all written
136:35 - with this style known as error first
136:37 - callbacks so you must include two
136:41 - arguments the first one is the error
136:44 - this enforces you to think about error
136:46 - handling which is the thing I don't
136:47 - really think about but at least a low
136:50 - five is trying to get me to do it and I
136:52 - should try to be I should be an error
136:54 - checking kind of person so this should
136:56 - have error frequency and I could do a
136:59 - little error handling like I could say
137:01 - if if error console dot error error
137:09 - otherwise console dot log the frequency
137:13 - and I'm now actually realizing that
137:16 - there's a slight inconsistency in the
137:18 - way that the pitch detection model works
137:20 - in ml five one of the things that is all
137:23 - of the other features of ml five do is
137:25 - they return an object so maybe it gives
137:27 - you an object that has the value you're
137:29 - looking for a confidence score so
137:31 - probably the raw frequency shouldn't be
137:33 - in there it should be an object maybe it
137:35 - actually already is and I'm wrong about
137:36 - that let's try running this one more
137:38 - time oh no I like that I'm seeing
137:44 - something nah do we have an error
138:01 - the terror that the debtor let that all
138:06 - right so what's going on here frequency
138:11 - is no and only did it once do I have to
138:14 - continue to call get the pitch it
138:17 - doesn't do it continuously I think that
138:20 - might be it
138:21 - let's look at the example
138:33 - so this is promising and that something
138:36 - came out did the air come out know if it
138:38 - was an error that came out it would have
138:40 - been read because console dot error will
138:42 - print something to the console that's
138:43 - read so frequency came out but frequency
138:46 - came out as null that's fine it detected
138:48 - no frequency I wasn't making a sound and
138:51 - it's not checking anymore the reason why
138:53 - it's not checking anymore is it doesn't
138:55 - know to keep checking I have to
138:56 - explicitly ask it to keep checking so I
138:59 - say give me the pitch and then once it's
139:02 - got the pitch it logs it and then I say
139:07 - give me that pitch again so this is a
139:09 - little bit of like a way of kind of
139:11 - calling this recursively this is the
139:13 - kind of recursion cuz it's not exactly
139:15 - it's a loop really so let me let me run
139:18 - this there we go so when it detects a
139:23 - frequency it console logs it and let's
139:26 - see higher frequency frequency so now I
139:38 - don't want to just see this in the
139:39 - console anymore I want to create a
139:42 - variable I'm gonna call it freak and I'm
139:46 - gonna I'm gonna set it to zero just so
139:50 - it has some value to start with and then
139:53 - here I'm going to say whenever I get a
139:56 - frequency sorry what's that got pitched
140:02 - oh right here I'm gonna say if I don't
140:05 - want to give it a sign it null so I'm
140:07 - gonna say if frequency freak equals
140:11 - frequency I might want to account for
140:14 - null in a better way and then now in the
140:16 - draw function which is quite unnecessary
140:19 - but I'm gonna do this anyway I am going
140:21 - to now say whoops give me some space
140:25 - under here I'm now going to say
140:28 - text-align:center
140:32 - text 3 quick C I'm gonna put width / 2
140:37 - height divided by 2 and let's say let's
140:41 - do text align Center center so it
140:43 - centers in both horizontally and
140:45 - vertically
140:46 - I'm gonna say a fill to 55 and
140:48 - texas-sized like 64 and then I'm gonna
140:51 - say frequency to fixed too so I want to
140:54 - see two decimal places and now let's run
140:57 - this okay hey let's grab the ukulele so
141:12 - the ukulele notes are a ECG is that
141:17 - right
141:17 - AEC G so this should be an a this should
141:23 - be 440 if I'm right so there's a there's
141:25 - math that you can do this with but I can
141:28 - also just look it up here yeah right
141:30 - there look at that even it's even
141:31 - highlighted
141:32 - I guess it's highlighted cuz it's like a
141:35 - four so this is the frequency I want so
141:37 - let's just say I just wanted to I'm
141:39 - gonna just tune the a string then maybe
141:42 - I'll like do the rest but kind of like
141:44 - speed up the video or something for you
141:45 - so I'm gonna tune the a string people in
141:49 - the chat are pointing out that I could
141:50 - also just use a tone generator that's
141:52 - probably a smart idea let me do that
141:54 - right now just to see that it works so
141:59 - hold on a second let me find that URL
142:20 - I wonder if it's not able to pick that
142:22 - up
142:25 - Oh 4:40
142:40 - [Music]
142:45 - yes about rapid mouths yeah so I think
142:48 - it's I know the mic is not picking up
142:50 - from the speaker and I wonder why that
142:52 - is
143:02 - it's getting it now why was it not
143:10 - getting it at 4:40
143:13 - [Music]
143:24 - sorry if this is driving everybody's
143:26 - ears nuts oh you can't hear this that
143:30 - well I'm not piping the audio out let's
143:41 - go over here it's pretty good not
143:51 - perfect all right let me let me watch
144:03 - your ears everybody lower your volume
144:05 - I'm gonna send the pitch out through the
144:09 - multi output device so lower your lower
144:12 - hear volume for a second here comes is
144:16 - that manageable for you to listen to I
144:19 - know you can hear it but now I'm
144:20 - actually sending it out oh no I'm not
144:22 - yeah yeah I'm sending it out through the
144:25 - laptop audio itself is that bad or good
144:40 - there we go perfect where did that ad
144:47 - was that bad I see I see one comment Oh
144:50 - God
145:03 - so I could turn it way down so I'm gonna
145:09 - turn it way down it was it just fine
145:14 - before so I'm turning this way down now
145:20 - and I'm gonna try it again
145:27 - Oh barely register at all
145:34 - [Music]
145:47 - should I just have done it with just
145:49 - picking it up for my mic is that better
145:53 - what's 7:30 it was fine before so I'm
145:59 - overthinking this
146:00 - so guess what everybody I'm not gonna
146:03 - send it out I'm just gonna send it out
146:05 - through the speakers and let my mic get
146:08 - it and you know what we could always was
146:10 - better with just the mic okay great so
146:12 - never mind okay
146:26 - so now it should now let me just make
146:28 - sure yeah okay all right I'm gonna do it
146:35 - I'm gonna do it just with the mic okay
146:40 - all right so thank you to Alka in the
146:42 - chat who suggested this online tone
146:44 - generator I'll include a link to that
146:46 - also in the video's description I'm just
146:48 - going to play it and as I do this slider
146:51 - we can see the pitch is pretty much the
146:55 - pitch detection is matching I mean I'm
146:56 - talking which is messing it up is
146:58 - matching the tone that is generating
147:02 - now you'll notice it's not perfect right
147:04 - this is a machine learning model that's
147:06 - been trained on some data set of sounds
147:08 - and then it's making a guess a
147:09 - prediction of what it thinks it is this
147:11 - is not a 100% accurate analysis that you
147:15 - could probably do mathematically
147:16 - especially with a pure tone but this is
147:18 - an approximation that would hopefully
147:19 - work with a variety of different kinds
147:22 - of sounds that might be harder to
147:23 - analyze and pull out that exact pitch
147:25 - also no idea what I'm talking about when
147:27 - it comes to sound I'm just trying to get
147:29 - this to work all right so now what I
147:31 - want to do is I want to make some kind
147:33 - of like visual indicator so I think what
147:35 - would be useful here is for me to draw
147:39 - maybe I should draw some type of
147:42 - rectangle that is big when I'm Way off
147:44 - or smaller or maybe it's when I'm above
147:47 - the pitch I'm drawing it to the right
147:48 - when I'm below I'm drawing it to left
147:50 - some type of and I'm sure you hopefully
147:52 - will make a version of this which are
147:53 - much nicer more thoughtful interface but
147:56 - to do this I think all I would need to
147:58 - do is say let's difference equal I want
148:02 - this frequency what that frequency is
148:05 - minus 440 so right now I'm just tuning
148:08 - for a I'm just tuning the a string so
148:11 - then I want to draw let's do rect mode
148:16 - actually let's not do rec mode center
148:19 - let's draw a rectangle I'm going to make
148:23 - it white for right now I'm going to say
148:28 - its position is what's the size of the
148:30 - canvas 200 200 4 and 400 so I'm going to
148:33 - say it's a 200 comma 50 let's move the
148:36 - text way down and then so I'm gonna move
148:42 - this like down here and then I'm going
148:45 - to make the width of it
148:46 - difference I'm just going to multiply it
148:48 - by 10 just to scale it and have the
148:50 - height be 50 so let me just try this for
148:52 - a second and let me play the tone oh
148:59 - whoops
149:02 - so this is actually where the nice thing
149:04 - is if I give it a negative width it
149:06 - seems to draw it
149:10 - as a negative it draws the rectangle in
149:12 - the opposite direction I don't actually
149:13 - have to flip it so the question is I
149:15 - think times 10 is actually quite a bit
149:17 - so let's actually not multiply it by
149:20 - anything let's think about what are
149:21 - these differences like it's 500 that
149:23 - makes sense a 60 60 pixels is pretty
149:25 - reasonable so let's get the ukulele now
149:28 - or actually let's let me still use the
149:30 - tone so let me make it let me set it to
149:37 - a four let me play it so I'm not seeing
149:42 - any rectangle
149:44 - there's a little rectangle
149:47 - there we go I mean talking messes it up
149:51 - because it gets a different pitch of my
149:52 - voice but I could also do something
149:54 - right now it could be a little bit more
149:55 - thoughtful about this and I could map I
149:59 - could say let amount equals map the
150:04 - difference between if it's between like
150:06 - a hundred it's off by like a hundred and
150:09 - a hundred to a value between zero and
150:12 - one and the reason why I'm doing this is
150:15 - I could use the function lerp color so
150:18 - let me say I have the color red which is
150:20 - to 5500 and I have the color green which
150:24 - is 0 255 0 and what I want to do is when
150:29 - it's all the way I want to get the
150:33 - actual I want I want to have the actual
150:35 - color the lerp color solar color gives
150:40 - me a linear interpolation between two
150:42 - colors like red and green oh this is
150:45 - actually not what I want to do I want it
150:48 - to be green when it's in the center so
150:50 - actually I want to map the absolute
150:53 - value of the difference
150:54 - I want to map the absolute value of the
150:57 - difference and those are this is much
150:58 - easier now between zero and a hundred
151:00 - and I want to then when it's zero it's
151:05 - perfectly green when it's a hundred it's
151:10 - red and I don't know if this is going to
151:12 - actually look right and but let's do
151:17 - let's try it
151:21 - [Music]
151:25 - so we can see here now if I try to tune
151:29 - the good ukulele let's make this an a4
151:49 - again that kind of works now the gig 100
152:14 - is way too small
152:16 - says Simon
152:29 - I should through the chat it makes me
152:40 - want to cry
152:44 - alright let's um let's let's um let's
152:56 - make this a little bit fancier all right
153:05 - I need a bubble shift the bubble to the
153:11 - center yeah so this interface is
153:13 - terrible and there are definitely better
153:16 - ways I can do this a dial would actually
153:19 - make a lot more sense I mean I should
153:20 - use a dial like rotating a dial from
153:25 - left to right
153:25 - a slider shifting the bubble yeah
153:36 - when exact Green is zero with ya you
153:43 - don't even see it
153:46 - yeah so alright so this interface as
153:54 - many people that are pointing out its
153:55 - pretty terrible I don't know what I was
153:57 - thinking I know much better interface
153:59 - would be like a dial I encourage you to
154:00 - try to make that um let me at least do
154:02 - like something that moves back and forth
154:04 - so what I want to actually do is always
154:06 - draw this rectangle for example I don't
154:08 - want the size of the rectangle to have
154:10 - anything to do with the difference so
154:12 - for example I can change this to like
154:15 - rect mode Center and then I can draw
154:18 - this rectangle like 200 pixels wide so
154:21 - now there's always a rectangle there and
154:24 - then what would make more sense for me
154:26 - to do is to draw a circle that appears
154:30 - in the rectangle like 200 but at an
154:34 - exposition so let me just put one in the
154:36 - middle that's like 50 like a circle
154:40 - that's size 50 so that's sitting there
154:42 - in the middle and now I can have this
154:43 - circle move back and forth the
154:45 - exposition can be like plus the
154:47 - difference so for example so the
154:54 - difference I guess divided by some
154:57 - amount for right now and again I want to
155:03 - be much more thoughtful about how I'm
155:04 - doing this but I guess I'll use the I'll
155:11 - use the tone generator
155:19 - [Music]
155:24 - so this value 100 is a way off let's try
155:28 - making this like 400 oh what am i what's
155:36 - going on here
155:36 - oh it's to hold on yeah I want to make
155:46 - it smaller yeah
155:53 - [Music]
156:03 - it will stop here people are sending me
156:06 - images in the chat of tuners yes I've
156:09 - seen those a dial with an arrow would be
156:13 - good if you send me pictures in the chat
156:15 - it's like I have everything font
156:16 - everything built up so big I can't see
156:18 - anything anymore I can barely see the
156:20 - picture so generally speaking it's not
156:22 - super helpful the circle should change
156:25 - color when it's bang on the lerp color
156:28 - is really weird I agree I thought the
156:31 - lerp color would be such a good idea
156:33 - it's not log scale would be better I
156:39 - pick there's a lot of better ideas
156:53 - I'm trying to think of what's a simple
157:09 - yeah let's not use lerp color
157:11 - I think the lerp color was an
157:13 - interesting idea and you know really
157:16 - just having like dials that like fill in
157:18 - or low there's just so many nicer ways
157:20 - of doing this people are sending me
157:23 - pictures of like tuners and how they
157:25 - work should then CJ is writing the chat
157:27 - should the max value in the map be
157:29 - related to the width of the rectangle
157:30 - yeah that would make sense right so if I
157:36 - if the width of the rectangle is but I'm
157:42 - dividing difference by ten so like a way
157:48 - to do this a little bit more with a
157:51 - little bit more care would be to take
157:55 - this divide it by ten there have this be
157:59 - the like half the width of the rectangle
158:02 - I think which the width oregano is 200
158:04 - to make this 100 and then just have that
158:07 - also be the offset so if I do that but
158:22 - the alert color is just really weird and
158:24 - doesn't make any sense
158:27 - it's really like not a good interface
158:30 - this lobe color thing at all so I think
158:34 - what I'm going to do is actually just
158:37 - make a much simpler interface where I am
158:42 - going to have this circle move back and
158:46 - forth I'm not actually going to change
158:48 - the color of the rectangle I'm going to
158:50 - kind of do it the opposite way I'm going
158:52 - to comment this out have the rectangle
158:59 - be white I'm going to make the circle
159:03 - red and then I'm gonna say if the
159:08 - difference is less than 2
159:21 - Phil 0 255 0 and let's make it less than
159:24 - 1
159:25 - let's try to really tune this thing and
159:30 - I'm going to also draw it I'm gonna
159:35 - scale the drawing by 10 ok all right so
159:38 - now and let's draw a line this is
159:51 - terrible I'm so bad at interfaces I
159:55 - shouldn't be allowed to do any of this
159:57 - I'm gonna draw a line at 200 sorry at 0
160:07 - at 200 comma 0 to 200 comma 200 and
160:14 - let's let's draw that line here and say
160:20 - let's have the rectangle be have some
160:24 - alpha to it let's say stroke one hundred
160:27 - and Stroke wait for and then I'll get
160:38 - rid of the stroke here and
160:44 - all right so now why is it green Oh cuz
160:49 - it hasn't gotten a frequency yet I got
160:53 - to give it a frequency I'm tuning it
161:01 - getting tuning it getting closer oh no
161:05 - no it can't be less gotta be absolute
161:08 - value gotta be absolute value and we're
161:12 - gonna map I got a great idea now now
161:15 - we're going to map so we can do things
161:27 - like this now
161:35 - [Music]
161:46 - do I need logarithmic scale why isn't
161:48 - why is the alpha of this rectangle not
161:52 - changing yeah
162:09 - [Music]
162:17 - [Music]
162:19 - I thought if the difference is a hundred
162:25 - the Alpha is zero
162:28 - we're losing my mind
162:30 - what oh no I didn't rerun the sketch oh
162:37 - oh yeah I didn't
162:40 - [Music]
162:50 - [Music]
162:53 - I have an I have a crazy idea
162:57 - I gotta stop doing this okay so
163:11 - why is there Oh cuz that's I keep
163:15 - thinking that I'm hitting this button is
163:17 - rerunning this sketch there we go okay
163:21 - so right now and this should really be I
163:25 - feel like this shouldn't be an ellipse
163:27 - it should be a rectangle
163:30 - I should really turn on the auto refresh
163:32 - now cuz that'll it should be a rectangle
163:36 - that is that is at this location and
163:45 - then it is like five pixels wide and six
163:48 - fifty pixels high and it should be ten
163:54 - pixels wide and 75 pixels high and this
164:00 - should be stroke weight one there we go
164:04 - okay here's my interface I worked very
164:08 - hard on this I am now going to play a
164:11 - tone and I'm going to try to tune it
164:14 - [Music]
164:21 - and then when you get there and I'm
164:24 - gonna let myself be within three
164:27 - frequency values I'm going to say also
164:32 - this Auto refresh was a terrible idea
164:36 - Phil 0-255 zero okay ready
164:45 - that's tunas ukelele five is way too
165:04 - much let's have the threshold be one
165:19 - [Music]
165:39 - there's my ukulele tuner you can see
165:42 - [Music]
165:44 - that is not the right note so so many
165:50 - things need to be thought first of all
165:51 - if that does not sound right this is
165:54 - gonna be a much better way of tuning it
166:04 - [Music]
166:07 - better than I thought
166:09 - [Music]
166:11 - all right
166:21 - now really quickly what I want to do is
166:26 - actually allow myself in this one sketch
166:30 - to tune all four of the strings and I
166:33 - really should be stop this video right
166:36 - now and not go any further but I would
166:38 - like to do this there's so much that
166:40 - needs to be and you will do that you
166:46 - will also make a version of this with an
166:48 - interface that looks like an actual
166:50 - thoughtful tuner is this playing the
166:53 - whole song or no it's just like us these
166:59 - so let's let's make an array of the
167:04 - notes so I'm gonna make an array so I'm
167:09 - gonna say notes equals and I'm going to
167:12 - create a bunch of objects for objects
167:18 - and each object is going to have the
167:26 - note and the frequency and the note for
167:30 - example is a and the frequency is 440 so
167:38 - I don't know why I did all that work
167:39 - when I just want to do this so there are
167:42 - four strings on the ukulele there's a e
167:47 - C and G so let's look up those
167:50 - frequencies the e is e it should be a
167:59 - efore which is this 329 623 C is I think
168:07 - it is going to be is it middle C I'm
168:11 - pretty sure it is
168:13 - 261 six two five six and then the G is
168:19 - actually G 4 I believe I don't know if
168:24 - they're 100% right about this
168:26 - so now the thing that I want to do is I
168:30 - want to find out what am i tuning
168:32 - against so first of all this is this is
168:35 - horrific I cannot bear this code that I
168:38 - have written so let's at least make this
168:39 - a little bit better let's make a
168:47 - variable called threshold and again I
168:50 - should do like a mapping or whatever
168:51 - let's make that threshold one and I will
168:55 - at least put that there so we know and
168:58 - again it's ridiculous that I have these
169:00 - if statement in two places but that'll
169:02 - be fine but the first thing that I need
169:04 - to do is actually figure out which note
169:07 - am I trying to compare it to and I want
169:09 - to automatically do that so I don't know
169:12 - actually which string I'm playing less I
169:13 - did some kind of like crazy computer
169:15 - vision thing but I'm just going to like
169:16 - find the note that it's closest to and
169:18 - tune against that so what I want to do
169:21 - here is I'm going to loop through all of
169:27 - the notes and I'm going to find the
169:31 - closest note is an index like zero and
169:39 - so and then I'm just gonna say negative
169:42 - one right now and then the record the
169:46 - record difference is I'm going to start
169:49 - with infinity and then I'm gonna say the
169:55 - it I'm gonna say the difference is notes
169:59 - index i dot frequency the actual
170:03 - frequency minus that if and I'm sure I
170:08 - could use reduce or some kind of fancy
170:10 - higher order array function but let me
170:12 - just do it this way if the difference is
170:15 - less than the record difference then the
170:19 - closest note is I and then once I've
170:29 - done that I have the closest note so now
170:33 - and let me just keep that difference oh
170:36 - I have it in record disc difference so
170:38 - difference equals
170:40 - record difference and it's not less than
170:44 - its absolute value sorry gotta have that
170:46 - absolute value in there always gotta
170:47 - have that absolute value in there and
170:49 - then the the actual note itself can I
170:55 - use this variable name is the notes
170:58 - index closest note I mean I could have
171:01 - just I don't have to save the index I
171:03 - could have saved the object but yeah let
171:05 - me save the object notes index I know
171:08 - it's index I don't need to save the
171:10 - index and that's closest note and then
171:13 - what I'm doing is I'm showing the value
171:17 - and then I want to draw instead of where
171:21 - I'm drawing this value right here I
171:24 - actually want to just put the note on
171:26 - the screen as well which would be where
171:28 - do I do that
171:29 - where do I actually draw that difference
171:31 - oh the text is up here so I'm going to
171:34 - make this much smaller and then I'm also
171:39 - going to write here say I'm going to say
171:44 - text size 64 I'm going to say closest
171:51 - note note and this I'm gonna place like
171:56 - 150 pixels up and this 50 pixels up
171:58 - let's see what that does
171:59 - great so now I should be able to tune
172:05 - all of the strings so it should detect
172:07 - here
172:18 - so why is it not giving me any
172:21 - information we're gonna have to debug
172:23 - this first of all okay let me look at
172:31 - this
172:36 - so let me console.log oh let me just
172:48 - make this no console.log oh you know
172:55 - what I didn't do
172:56 - I'm missing like a super obvious thing I
172:59 - forgot to set the record difference
173:02 - equal to that difference well duh okay
173:06 - here we go so my a is pretty - okay what
173:32 - I'm at a console log record difference
173:39 - and closest note
173:54 - [Music]
174:18 - for worst let's put the absolute value
174:22 - here and then I won't make this mistake
174:26 - if the difference right I need this this
174:29 - has to be the absolute value as well
174:30 - that's a roughly a problem all right
174:33 - here we go everybody I think this is
174:34 - good now I really need some finer grain
174:48 - [Music]
174:58 - this is really
175:01 - [Music]
175:22 - I need the negative difference oh I need
175:36 - it here
175:39 - okay everybody everything's gonna be
175:42 - fine so when I'm getting the record I
175:49 - want the smallest one but then when I
175:52 - use it down here you know if it's
175:54 - negative or not is kind of important
175:56 - right no I'm using the absolute value
175:58 - everywhere oh except for drawing where
176:01 - it is all right
176:37 - how about this how about that huh huh
176:41 - how about that if the absolute value of
176:43 - the difference is less than the absolute
176:44 - value the record difference then the
176:45 - record ref is different but I see the
176:47 - negative for use down here I would like
177:11 - to be able to see more movement so where
177:14 - is this divided by ten give me a break
177:16 - divide yourself by two people whoops
177:30 - wrong string
177:35 - [Music]
178:04 - it's not really into what did I do wrong
178:09 - by G is wrong this is the wrong G
178:15 - [Music]
178:49 - I'm trying there any last things I could
178:51 - do to improve this I could do slurp
178:58 - using lerp never hurts no sound fro
179:55 - there's no sound from the soundboard oh
179:57 - you weren't hearing that Oh cuz I turn
180:01 - it all the way down well
180:17 - alright is this good
180:20 - can I be done
180:28 - [Music]
180:35 - [Music]
180:44 - [Music]
180:52 - save sketch okay this has been my first
181:13 - coding challenge in the new coding
181:15 - terrain studio over here at New York
181:18 - University in Brooklyn I made a ukulele
181:21 - tuner it has the worst-ever interface
181:23 - for ukulele tuner but I do think there
181:26 - are some nuggets in here it's nice to
181:28 - see how that pitch detection model works
181:29 - I would love it if you made your own
181:32 - version of this you could go to the
181:34 - coding train com find the page for this
181:37 - coding challenge look at the
181:39 - instructions to submit your own actually
181:40 - a video tutorial for how to do that if
181:42 - you make your own ukulele tuner and you
181:44 - put it on the web I will tune this
181:46 - ukulele with it in my next live stream
181:49 - so thank you very much for watching and
181:51 - I will see you in a future coding
181:53 - challenge goodbye I don't like the tiny
181:59 - needle moment movement personally I
182:02 - don't like it at all either it's awful
182:09 - we'll see if matsya can work some kind
182:11 - of magic to edit this let me check my
182:14 - phone I've been doing this for three
182:16 - hours apparently hold on
182:33 - this is texting my family was wondering
182:36 - what I am I said I'll be done by 7:00 so
182:47 - thanks everybody
182:50 - somebody help me remember this list
182:54 - there's 371 of you watching which is 300
182:58 - less than started oh that's weird
183:02 - that's very weird
183:04 - this camera did this camera go to sleep
183:07 - or did a cable go loose weird
183:15 - ah I wonder if that camera went to sleep
183:20 - this camera yeah it's way I'm looking at
183:23 - the confidence monitor which is not
183:25 - looking at the camera this is me looking
183:26 - at the ever thank you for watching I'm
183:30 - really I'm the wrong height I stand back
183:33 - here thank you so much for watching this
183:35 - live stream um I didn't get to show any
183:37 - other community contributions I really
183:39 - think I have to end now though I'll be
183:41 - back next Friday at a minimum I'll be
183:43 - back next Friday I have this whole list
183:46 - of things if anyone wants to help work
183:49 - on the wheel let's start a new repo in I
183:55 - mean I have that like wheel spinning
183:57 - thing but I want to start over and I
183:59 - want to make a wheels should do the
184:02 - wheel spin right now right what what am
184:04 - I gonna do next week I should do the
184:06 - wheel spin right I mean I actually do
184:08 - what I said I was gonna do right if I'm
184:11 - gonna do one of these next week uh-huh
184:13 - if I'm gonna do one of these next week I
184:16 - should do one of these next week should
184:17 - do what I say I'm gonna do I scaled it
184:27 - if is this a quick fix instead of what
184:31 - would be the next previous string oh
184:32 - okay yeah
184:46 - all right
184:49 - is that a like thing that I could my
184:53 - brain is totally dead so marching
184:55 - squares are TP more I'm not gonna put
185:01 - more rows on there because I'm well
185:03 - actually I'll put it on there if it
185:04 - lands on it then good planning it ASCII
185:08 - art de Launay I don't think I spelled
185:15 - that right Tetris oh my god please no
185:19 - breakout Collatz conjecture heck oh
185:29 - please hexagonal grid I would love to do
185:31 - that next week that's not such a good
185:33 - idea
185:33 - pac-man no whirly noise No oh my god
185:37 - okay okay everyone
185:49 - I am going to spin this wheel and
185:56 - whatever it comes up on is what I have
186:00 - to to in my livestream next week just
186:04 - I'm gonna take one Mulligan I so first
186:08 - of all I think I should I'm not gonna do
186:09 - it right now but I think I should get
186:10 - like a veto so like one time between now
186:13 - and the end of 2019 if it lands on
186:15 - something and I want to veto it I could
186:16 - spin again
186:17 - we could come up with some other goofy
186:19 - rules let's just spin it
186:44 - [Music]
186:55 - next week on the county train whatever
187:02 - this is I'll see you next week where I
187:09 - will be doing the Collatz conjecture I
187:11 - will read up on what that is I will look
187:13 - at the issue thank you to whoever
187:14 - submitted that I'm sorry David thank you
187:17 - so much for preparing that list I'm I
187:19 - would love it if people let me just at
187:22 - least let me show one community
187:23 - contribution because it spent so much
187:24 - time working on that and I've already
187:27 - like lost it contributions random org
187:32 - this should allow me to pick a random
187:33 - number right numbers integer generator I
187:38 - want to get a number between 2 and 78
187:46 - inclusive one random number between 2
187:53 - and 78 both inclusive and get the number
187:57 - here we go I know you can't see this 41
188:03 - okay so today before I go I'm gonna look
188:06 - at one oh and cybers has telling me to
188:10 - watch the number file awesome okay I'll
188:12 - watch that one community contribution
188:16 - hung the spreadsheet number 41 let's see
188:19 - whose it is it is by it was sentiment
188:23 - analysis by Lee ima papa
188:28 - it's a link on code pen with 41 Y Lee I
188:34 - am a Papa submitted a bunch of things
188:36 - we're gonna look at this one and we were
188:39 - gonna check it out oh look at this which
188:42 - some kind of like sentiment analysis
188:57 - should I press this button what does it
189:02 - do is that the is this the analysis I'm
189:09 - getting Vito please
189:17 - typing happy happy happy joy joy oh when
189:21 - I got it three okay so it's this is
189:23 - sentient analysis with the bag-of-words
189:25 - technique where it's looking at words
189:28 - that it knows are associated with a
189:30 - positive or negative sentiment probably
189:32 - adding up the score together and I love
189:34 - that we see the score here I love this
189:35 - little animation of like now calculate
189:37 - it and then that the result is given
189:39 - with an emoji which is really awesome
189:41 - excellent work thank you for this
189:42 - community contribution I hope they'll
189:44 - look at more of these in future live
189:45 - streams and I will now take you out with
189:48 - my goodbye song and I'll be back I'm
189:52 - gonna do more next week than just that
189:54 - that's just the coding challenge
189:56 - hopefully next week I'm going to come
189:58 - and maybe do something else from one of
190:02 - these other topics or and I probably
190:04 - should have put the leftover stuff the
190:06 - tic-tac-toe minimax should have
190:08 - definitely been on that list so we got
190:09 - to build ourselves a better wheel one
190:13 - that adds like a wheel waiting room
190:14 - perhaps even if like topics and like
190:17 - this sort of core topics I don't know I
190:18 - don't know how to do it yet we'll figure
190:19 - it out
190:22 - [Music]
190:27 - well it's good to be back I have to say
190:29 - enjoyed this I'm exhausted
190:32 - they need to be the weekend which
190:34 - thankfully it is and I'll see you all
190:37 - next Friday
190:39 - I'm stay tuned like if you subscribe and
190:43 - click the bell and all that nonsense
190:44 - you'll get a notification when I
190:45 - schedule a live stream but we'll see
190:52 - [Music]
190:56 - wheel that you can load a CSV too so
190:59 - that would work it doesn't have to be a
191:00 - JSON file CSV would be fine which so we
191:05 - could have like a Google sheet even
191:06 - that's just like keeping track of all
191:07 - this stuff
191:08 - [Music]
191:14 - how people enjoyed this today I don't
191:16 - know I mean it's good that I did this
191:19 - again we'll see if this could be edited
191:23 - into a coding challenge video that
191:29 - interface was horrifically bad for me I
191:32 - would like the chance to like not do
191:34 - live streaming to try to like
191:36 - suppressing my ideas out somebody won't
191:38 - make something all beautiful you always
191:41 - do internet always do follow mango and
191:44 - goose on Instagram those are my cat's
191:46 - I don't do the Instagram the cat's do
191:50 - the Instagram Ryan says great stream
191:54 - thanks that's nice of you
191:55 - um I actually don't have a way of I
191:58 - don't I don't have not set up local
192:00 - storage that is a great suggestion
192:06 - I'm gonna go over here and add that to
192:09 - the JavaScript topics local storage I
192:14 - don't think this was the marker I was
192:15 - using because it's not the good one but
192:17 - that's something that definitely should
192:18 - go on the list of things I want to
192:19 - accomplish this fall
192:30 - [Music]
192:33 - all right so I'm going to go over here
192:38 - where I have a YouTube streaming control
192:41 - room where I can shut down the stream
192:48 - but first can you go back to open
192:51 - broadcast studio and I'm gonna click
192:54 - stop streaming bye everybody
192:57 - I will see you next week or sooner or
192:59 - later or who knows I really have no idea
193:01 - goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

I think I'm live but I don't actually know hello and welcome to the coding train oh I do have my whistle it's so nice to see you maybe you don't see me maybe I'm doing this hello thing and I'm just doing it to myself because I don't see anybody in the chat saying that they see me yet I do see open broadcast studio over here streaming I do see myself in a confidence monitor I feel confident today I have a confidence monitor I am new confident Dan oh you do see me yay oh that's interesting my stream dekha is not hooked up properly observer so I this new tool I have so many things to say I don't even know maybe you've never watched before you have no idea where you are I'm very very excitable there's like new notifications thing I just got like a message I was by the way if you tagged me now in slack a little message pops up on this screen that I have over here that's kind of cool I didn't do that on purpose it just happens but I have this like Elgato stream deck not a sponsor but could be a sponsor and supposedly when I press this button it's going to oh did worked dude in the attitude in the chat by the way this a little bit more volume okay okay this I can probably do this I can probably handle a little more volume a little bit afraid to turn it up because all signs point to being plenty yes Marcos it does work your message popped up here on the screen hmm all right a little more Vaughn I have it all the way up oh I know where I can turn it up I have by the way all new equipment new lights I really want to show you something this is what I'm the most proud of this hold on a second this is very I have to show you this I have this'll just take a second I don't have it set to like there we go what is this why it's on there okay here we go look at this I mean come on look at this green screen there's a little bit of shadowing but there these new lights coming from all sides very little shadowing you know I almost want to just do the whole livestream like this that's just too wonderful okay I better turn that back on though I think that's probably the best plan all right let's turn this back on chroma keying myself out is my slack in dark mode I have no idea um I don't think it is I just installed this III I don't even know where to begin this is I should have thought about what I was gonna do oh no now it does tell me my stream deck has come online and it tells me how many people are watching all right this is gonna shock you I have another button I could press I'm a little bit afraid to press it so this is what I really have not completed yet the other side first I don't know why this is so dark looks kind of dark I don't know what the quality is interesting thing is I have this camera on autofocus so I can walk up here and I could talk to you like this this is me streaming to you talking to you saying hello welcome to the coding training all of my facial imperfections please enjoy the gray in the beard all right that was weird but okay back I probably should set the focus to this whiteboard I do have smarter surfaces magnetic whiteboard wallpaper on the wall but it needs something called vinyl on over vinyl adhesive which I don't have so I'll be going to some hardware store ordering something then I will get that and then I'll be putting that on the wall so that I can do some white boarding I mean I can move this out of the way you can see the wall I mean I'm tempted to just start drawing on the wall because why not but I'm gonna put the white it's magnetic too so I can hang stuff up but for today I just have this rolling white board and I can do things like draw well this this this marker is terrible I can draw a kitty cat by the way can I just plug something I probably shouldn't do this oh I shouldn't reveal I shouldn't reveal but I have an Instagram you should follow it's on my Instagram I have new cats the cats evidence' gram right now there are four kittens living in my house two of them are about to be adopted so I will just have to but if you want to follow them on Instagram it's mango and goose those aren't there those are the middle names mango and goose this is what people tuned in for it right for me to talk about my cat cats the gram do remember how there was this thing on the internet called the coding train and you would learn how to code and there was this friendly person who would come and teach you concepts and you would make creative projects it went away and it came back and then there was just like a totally insane person showing you about their new whitewalled enclosed room with no windows and very bright LEDs shining on me boof I hope you can hear me still I haven't even bothered to check the chat or anything uh I've seen how the chat says seeing Dan's facial hair in 1080p definitely made my day guess what if you thought that was good I I'm sure I could get this up to 4k suited because these cameras the new cameras I have do 4k I am NOT I don't believe I'm capturing 4k I'm certainly not live streaming in 4k maybe try looking at the camera a little more yeah needs to move so here's the problem everybody's telling me to move the lights to the ceiling I would like to say that I could do that there's a real problem this is me touching the ceiling it's a very low ceiling it's just like a couple feet above my head there is no grid it's this this is not an ideal space I might move all this equipment again because the lights should definitely be on the ceiling but my sound is good when your face isn't close to the camera that was weird I don't know what that means oh by the way I have this crazy like noisecanceling thing on so people were telling me that maybe this is too much let's just do a little debugging of that for a second just so you the larger audience can help me with this oh yeah you know it's really sad it's really sad I have something to announce I don't have any so it's a fight I can't let me see hold on maybe maybe just maybe uh three percent I've been charging this tablet which has my sound effects on it for like the last 45 minutes and it never came alive and it finally just came alive and it's at 3% so let me give it a couple more minutes and then we can have our music again I was gonna do a drum roll I don't know actually let's wait and see has it been 30 minutes yet I don't think these cameras are going to go to sleep I don't know that I've tested this I really don't think they're gonna go to sleep people're tell me to look at the camera more so I always have looked directly at the camera right now I'm looking directly at the camera I don't know if this is effective but actually what I do with this new setup I have these confidence monitors I find myself looking at those but maybe if I'm looking at the confidence monitor it doesn't really feel like I'm looking at you like if I would walk over here and say and unfortunately this is not on auto focus so you just have to live with my blurry face you know when you stream in a room by yourself it causes you to do strange things that you would never ordinarily do in front of other people or maybe that's just me most people would not do that strange things currently seven minutes your audio levels are consistently six to ten decibels too low alright so the wonderful thing is that I have a full focus right 4x4 audio interface which this lav mic is going into I need to do another sort of tour of this studio and explain all the equipment it's a lot of this it's the same principle but different stuff so I am going to come over here and I'm going to pump up the volume I'm gonna need Christian Slater for this but I think I can handle it okay I just pumped up the volume a little bit didn't do it scientifically I just turned a dial who doesn't even have any numbers to like tell me whether I'm in an 8 or 9 or an 11 but I think it's there when you're at your desk it looks fine when you look at the confidence monitor when at the whiteboard is a little more jarring somehow that's interesting let's try that again tell me if the volume is better oh it's gonna talk to you about the noise canceling I have going on okay let's see so what you're saying to me is when I'm over here and I'm looking at the confidence monitor it's kind of jarring but if I look at you at the camera look at you I'm looking at you looking directly into the camera this feels more like we're friends we're here we're gonna code all that sort of stuff yes No so you tell me all right so um what's going on today so first of all this I don't this is not I would say this is this is not the season premiere I feel like I might need to go to a seasons model because my life is entirely built around academic semesters and I was thinking of having like a fall season and the spring season and then a summer season and then a break so I might I'm thinking about doing something like that because even though my hiatus was much too long this summer in in the end it was almost a full it was possibly over two months so I don't don't intend to have a hiatus that long from livestreaming but I do think each summer like taking a month break is I'm just doing so and so I'm that's not really the important thing right now I'm just looking at the chat to tell me everything is perfect no improvement is needed the monitor care louder you know people are talking if the whiteboard is reflective don't worry about that I'm going to I have Matt the wall covering that I'm going to this is just a very temporary thing the wall covering we'll be Matt is Matt so we won't be too reflective I'm best at the sound delay oh the sound blaze gone so interestingly what I one thing I want to just show you sound is absolutely good enough thank you Peter what's nice about this too when I get these popup messages from slack is it has a little face so I see a little face hi thanks Peter alright let's let me go here I just want to show you one other feature that I have here David Cohen is asking are you on Twitch no no no I mean I could be it's a thing I have the technological capability to do but for whatever reason I stream on YouTube YouTube streaming person thing I don't know not on twitch at the moment okay so let me go to this is the thing I want to show you audio advanced audio properties no that's not what I want to show you filters okay I'm going to demonstrate something to you at the moment right so this room in addition to the ceiling being right there this room has some very loud ventilation incidentally if you're wondering what's behind me right over here is a bathroom anybody in there if I have to go which I often do the fight stream for like three or four hours it won't be very far away which is nice on the other side I think it's a shirt shop so there might be some loud noises simply not soundproof in here and there's a very loud ventilation sound it's not that bad but it's a if I were trying to record you know a you know those were like a fully room or trying to record a podcast would be a problem I think with a lav mic and live streaming the the buzz the hum from the ventilation isn't a huge issue but you don't hear it right now because I have OBS an open broadcaster do you have noise suppression on so I'm going to turn that off for a second so now you should be hearing I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat now you should be hearing the sound of the hum now I was monitoring myself on a headphone on a Helen a headphone this is a headphone this is headphones now I can hear myself it's a little bit weird cuz there's a slight lag and I hear that hum i'm gonna click noise suppression and it's gone so i like this without the noise but people the other i did a test livestream with a smaller non public audience and some of the people said to me is a little creepy how silent it is so there is a suppression level variable that i can play with but i couldn't really make it do anything i'm gonna do something with it right now so I am going to way better without the noise canceling so that's your voice is much clearer alright this is gonna be our first ever and also something's weird about the color right doesn't the color of this background look different than what it used to be or am I just crazy because I have a different monitor over here so many things let's do our little strawpoll exercise for the first time straw pull just try this one noise suppression yes and I like it I like the quiet no it's too quiet alright so this is going to be the pole I'm gonna hit create pole and this is the URL if somebody could oblige and place this URL in the if someone could place this URL in the chat thank you and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna let you hear this again so I'm gonna talk throughout the whole thing and then I'm also gonna do it and do it and Simon is pointing out to me there's also a noise option that one I tried and it causes a lot of like clicking and going in and out so that one really didn't work very well the colors are a bit off the window is not white right is that but no wait it's weird is that my like setting oh you know what it might be is there like a display color settings or something like I thought what it was was night the thing that's called like no not this that like night vision thing on iOS is not iOS with Mac OS which is somewhere in Energy Saver where is that is there a setting where so we hold on let me do the sound thing first there's like a setting there must be like a color setting thing which I don't know why I'm staring at this as if I'm gonna find it let me do the noise thing okay all right here comes the noise the noise suppression is on noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is off the noise suppression is off the noise suppression is off the noise suppression is off the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on these pretzels are making me lose suppressed notes this noise suppression is making me thirsty that would have been better the noise suppression is on the noise suppression is on north suppression is off the noise suppression is off you need the link somebody post the link display night shift tab yeah oh so I wasn't the right place yes but night shift is off so there must be some other kind of color this is what I'm looking for display color ah do you think this is the issue on definitely honest better oh I'm gonna books ah alright I the syllables are clear off there's a middle ground to have the noise suppression I agree I don't know how to set it I can't find the middle ground I want to find the middle I live in the middle I'm all about the middle alright hold on let's try other color profiles could this possibly whoops ah look did that do something there's nobody there's really nobody who has admin privileges in the chat to post that link there we go thank you okay week Mon Nathan growl is going to help me okay I'm ready I'm here I'm following your instructions I'm at your command people tell me what color profile to use hi Gaelic that's so nice I'm so glad to hear that you started programming from watching this channel no no I found the night show people are yeah I forget that you're in the past I am in the future you're in the past oh wait let's see if I can get my sound effects going oh I'm only at 6% after all of that time charging okay it's true tone so I'm supposed to select true tone I don't know how computers work I don't see an option called true tone calibrate what do I do no I don't want builtin retina I want this ah Pro capture no wonder true tone what do i do what do i do it's a color LCD color match so do anything did that do something turn off true tone there's where we're going to I turn off true tone I don't know how to do that open profile all right let me get my sound going somebody will tell me turn off true to know how completely incompetent I have a master's degree and interactive telecommunications I can't even find the charger charger ah here it is I have a charger I have a USB C 2 lightning charger display display tab uncheck true tone okay thank you NIT eh display display uncheck display display tab display display tab I see no unchecking true tone oh there it is but this is for the retina display it shouldn't affect the output to the capture oh I guess I did it do Apple RGB 1998 is that better turn the computer off him at haunt again two tabs to the left yes I can't tell if it change did it change I'm sorry for those of you are here for the coding well there will be some coding today but it's I'm haven't even been a half an hour you oh no no no no no no no no no no no I do not not new message color is better now okay great what did it the true tone or the Adobe RGB who knows let's check the straw poll hmm so more people are voting for the no noise suppression I don't know how new oh I'm sorry pronounced Nidhi didn't help me did I say it wrong nighty sorry I don't know how to pronounce 1998 and true tone off is too white oh no like this like livestreaming settings by committee is a really bad idea but hold on I'm over here trying to get some music playing so give me a minute here 1998 seems more oldfashioned rap I'm gonna I'm gonna put that back i I do like the idea of being like an oldfashioned retro live streaming let's go back to color sync utility I did not need that okay System Preferences displays your turn is off oh I see automatically adapt display make colors appear consistent in different ambient lighting conditions got it so let's go back to house this regular Apple RGB or whatever it was on it was like HD how about this HD 709 a meaty haha mailed it to does that work makes me so happy it's so sad I have this Elgato stream deck and I've only used four buttons so far so eventually I'll get some more come on here we go let's get to not now I don't need to verify don't want to verify anything just give me my music okay I don't hear it do you hear it whoa super loud coming in super loud coming in alright everybody now what I used to use for this is something called loopback whoops yeah yeah yeah it's a little little behindthescenes magic here there we go wait we have 30 minutes yet switch over here yeah you don't music is gone you need to add the music to this shot why is it so dark am I crazy is this like really dark oh the cameras like Auto stuff I need to put the camera on manual left is much louder this gyms bonus a little weird okay well so one thing do you know what that's my fault I actually have separate control it's gonna be too loud sorry buddy request from Michael Michelle underneath the pronunciation help for this time is it better now the weird thing is the mic is picking it up so much so I just turn the mic off this is the audio without getting it from the mic this dog this dog the start that this stock song never forget the best on but somebody composed that song for me so almost inaudible like when you say was almost inaudible it's always almost inaudible now I or when I when I mute my microphone it's inaudible this is really good for me to be biking all this Oh the laptop mike is the laptop Mike oh you mean I don't know laptop Mike so I don't understand what people are telling me no to sound inputs right now are this Mike and the the music is inaudible is the music inaudible right now oh now I'm throwing it stop this stop this I have to remind everybody that it's very very you know I'm just an idiot to this because I can actually monitor it to get hot where's my air conditioning a we too loud but better than before I have very fine control over this audio hey it's coating garden with CJ here okay hi Cody garden with CJ alright beam your name is CJ I don't have to refer to you as Cody garden with CJ but it says on my screen love your icon a little plant alright I think I'm done with my good down I think I'm it's as good as it's gonna be we got it I got to do something else got some color got a computer alright so welcome everyone to the coding dream I am your host Daniel chief Mon and I am here to read to you from my book a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates because what we need in this world in these turbulent times is a way of relaxing a meditative experience a way to connect with each other and for me very strangely it happens to be reading random numbers seventy one thousand three hundred eighteen 68,000 876 53,000 986 1289 fiftyeight thousand nine hundred and thirtyfour seven it was seven to seven ninety five twenty seven thousand five hundred and thirty seven twentythree thousand three hundred and fifty three twenty one thousand five hundred and twenty five six thousand one hundred and fifty five fifteen thousand one hundred forty six thirty seven thousand four hundred and seventy eight maybe a thousand five hundred sixty six thirty six thousand eight hundred and eightythree twentysix thousand nine hundred and sixtyseven so what this is is a youtube channel where I oh I have to interrupt myself again oh this is I'm the worst because oddly enough to switch to the other camera for some reason I have this like it was doing some cleaning and various things that have this perfectly green little towel which I could use to like erase the whiteboard but I'm gonna get a dirty so I just really feel like I need to walk into the other scene wearing it also what's gonna be fun is I will show you this very very strange mysterious can of paint what is going on with this weird can of paint you know what's going on it it's got green on it that's the actual paint I painted that whiteboard okay so I was saying is this is a YouTube channel where every week and I think it's gonna be Friday's for the foreseeable foreseeable future I think that I'm gonna alternate between doing live streams that are in the morning my time which would be about 900 a.m. my time eastern time you can do your math as to where you are and 500 p.m. Eastern Time so today was a 500 p.m. Eastern time today I heard from a lot of you that like it's midnight my time it's 100 a.m. my time I'm gonna stay up to watch you know get some sleep take care of yourself it's much of your health and your your sleep and your is much more important than coding and me and YouTube and all that nonsense but to the extent that I can alternate different times to help people with different parts of the world catch the live streams I'm happy to do so and it works well with my schedule because sometimes I have something the morning sometimes there's something in the evening I do feel a little bit like Friday at 500 p.m. is not the best time for the live stream I have a very busy week if you haven't watched before I happen to have this strange fulltime job where I work at New York University it's actually where I am right now I'm at the new building in Brooklyn so in this building on the floor where I am is a program called ITP interactive telecommunications program I would pull up all these websites or slides but do that there's also an undergraduate major called ima or Interactive Media Arts downstairs for me is the inter integrated digital media program from the Tannen School of Engineering upstairs is the Clive Davis Center for recorded music remove recorded music Department one floor up is the NYU game Center did you know let's see if there live right now this would be amazing if they were they don't think they are NYU game game I can type game Center live YouTube here we go this should get us where's the live streams oh there we go so they were life looks like it was live stream yesterday come on people oh you can't see this watch the game Center live we can help them out here um so anyway check out that anyway you gave centers here I'm hoping to do more some stuff with them maybe invite some guests go upstairs I don't know we'd love to collaborate with them as well elsewhere in this building I believe there's a computer science department there's some engineering departments there's something called cusp which is the Center for urban studies and planning I believe lots of stuff in this building it's very exciting I love being in Brooklyn I live in Brooklyn and so there's a lot of convenience now it took me a long time to get back up and running with this equipment in this room so hopefully I'm gonna be here now for you know until the middle of December every single week I have some ideas and other things that I might try to do with the channel a little surprises hopefully plan which I will speak to but what I wanted to use today for beyond what I wanted to use today for beyond just kind of testing the equipment and getting back in the habit of doing this is to say like it's hard like I didn't really feel like doing this again today I mean I hate to admit that because this is one of the things that I enjoy in my life the most and the community that's around and the people that I've met and the people who leave comments and watch the videos and create all these amazing things that I never imagined to be possible from these videos but you get kind of out of the habit and I was like I just want to go home like play with kittens I have kittens I mean I there are four kittens living in my house right now it's a little bit nutso and we need to those other two kids are being adopted I think two is the right number I mentioned on Instagram you can follow some of mango and goose fill up that Instagram come on that's so but I'm now that I'm doing it I feel really good and excited I feel like there's a lot more work to do i i'm i don't want to livestream with a lot of the you know there's a lot of nice inside jokes in terms of the imperfections and things that don't work and the camera shutting off but i would like to have a bit more of a professional operation mostly just to have a higher quality content so there so that's what's happening the channel is meant to be for a beginner i have if you've never watched before which i don't know if it's so many of you i have a thank you k weak bond for posting him to the gents awesome i have what am I trying to say sorry i thought of the kittens again when i lost my train whoa that was loud of thought does it say to yeah that's funny because when i press the button you see the choo choo and then a little later i press the button whatever so what i want to one of the things i want to use today for is to get organized i have a lot of new stuff that i'm planning stuff that's coming together but it's taken longer to come together so i actually even though this whiteboard is a little bit janky for today i'm going to use it to make a list of things that I want to accomplish this fall and through December in terms of content on this channel and then I really want to try to stick to that or use it as kind of guide a checklist so to speak and you guys can help keep me you all of you watching can keep me honest in terms of what I'm getting to and not getting to so I'm gonna first I'm just gonna brainstorm let me first figure out which marker works but I could type this up so I could make this a type list but I feel like doing this on the whiteboard and then we will write it down ah look at that this is a much better marker I don't know why what's the difference I'm going to come up close to you and show you as far as I can tell there's no difference between these markers they're the same but this one works and this one doesn't okay so things that I want to accomplish this fall so there's like leftover stuff I better call it leftover tictactoe minimax I remember this was left dangling can you see this at all yeah you can kind of see that it's not the greatest the something I gotta do something more with the Rubik's Cube I don't know what that's gonna be definitely have to do something more let's talk about machine learning so that's another topic I want to do something called a latent space walk space walk that's definitely something I want to do I probably will use runway for that a runway m/l that's something I definitely want to do I want to spend some time on the ml5 this is not a thing that exists on the internet right now but I have a version of this new I tweeted this out so a little bit I apologize for the glare this is a new function in ml 5 called neural network that allows you to train a model from that from scratch you basically what allows you to do is you if you have a data set if it's in a JSON format or a CSV format you can load it in ml 5 will create a neural network architecture for you based on just some heuristics making some best guesses and then you can train a model and use it so that's something I absolutely want to do there are probably like so this this is what's off the top of my head so let me take a look at the chat right now and see if anything has come in by the way I'm getting much better at solving the Rubik's Cube I didn't actually brings in this summer fry birthday my kids bought me everything by four you know whatever my family bought me a nine by nine Rubik's Cube which I spend quite a bit of time it took me about most of the day to solve it but I could solve it now that was a lot of fun okay tree data structure that's a hint I Claire p5 Jess that would be good let me come back over here for a second so the other so where do you find ah yes so thank you Simon brought something up which I'm gonna put so I'm gonna put that under J s topics like these are really just like programming topics um so let's call that generator function this is something that I've been meaning to look at and maybe talk about at some point over here I should write challenges so this will be like new challenges and again this isn't like these are the things I'm gonna do this semester this fall winter and nothing's gonna change I just want to have a little bit of a plan and something to work with so that I'm kind of keeping track of the larger picture and getting a sense of like what people are interested in tree for the minimax yes so okay so let me see what else don't forget n dimensions all right so n dimensions okay yeah people are asking for oh you doesn't change automatically people are mentioning reinforcement learning that I that I'm very interested in I hesitate to write that down right now because it's a bit more of the purview of what I plan to do this spring I mean I make a year behind at this point and where I wanted to be with that so I kind of want to put that there but I don't I'm not super ready to commit to that right now okay WebGL and shaders Oh P something that I would like to also have as a general topic if I'm sort of thinking of topics is like open source so I think I could do more with git and github but I probably need to detail that a bit better okay so a bit harder for me to use this stream deck but I do enjoy it okay so a couple things one let me you know most of you I think who are watching or familiar with the channel I'm getting the sense but they're probably people have never watched before so if you're looking for to sort of learn about the coding train you know use two first stops one could just be the channel homepage but also the coding train website itself and this is where you'll find some of the categories of the kind of content that I make so there's coding challenges which are really just you know oneoff videos I want to do more computational geometry hello so many things you can see these here so these are them and you know if you see it's a wide variety of topics relating to algorithms and drawing in various things well I really have made a lot of content it's kind of a big thing Oktoberfest thank you for mentioning that so maybe we can do I can plan to do something around Oktoberfest write that down over here a functional on Oh Opie stuff so what am I missing from the sort of yeah so I think I need a more specific suggestion than that but that is something an automated switch for they can't write you yeah yeah I probably should do that I don't know okay then there are tutorials I mean do I need to what I might like to redo some of these beginner ones that are quite out of date but I guess I'm gonna hold off on that right now alright so let's go look at so another place where I kind of compile things that I'm interested in I had people suggest is this github reap positive repository called a rainbow topics I really keep meeting to change the names of these repos to be like Train themes they're like be like stations or stops or something like that but when we were this other when I was when I would we when this was a different channel with another name back in the day it was called rainbow topics I just can't bring myself to change it so let's look at this so one thing I'm gonna do is sometimes when I'm interested in something I like assign it to myself so let me look at that first okay autoencoders uhhuh well this I did ah yes marching squares marching cubes absolutely want to do that let's write that here marching squares cubes that's one it and the reason why I'm making this list I have another sort of plan now already P and this is a little bit our DP algorithm is something I really want to do toothpick I did toothpicks oh you know I'm not really standing in the place where I'm kind of like off my because I'm usually over here and then I have more room here not really fully used to this layout yet Fibonacci spiral part four of nerve evolution what was that water ripples I mean I have to go through all these yeah I think I did this ah Bora Rose is definitely happening but I have a plan for that so I don't but I'll put that put that on the board I did pull the roses but a more roses a slightly different thing flocking challenge I did wait are these no they're the only opens Wow we really got to go through these kmeans clustering yeah I do want to do that tree that tic tac toe I did no more no more fluid simulation please Alam spiral oh this is patron recommended ASCII art generator that's kind of like a fun one I don't know how I would do that something around like ASCII art let's do that so David is telling me oh and David could you a Voronoi yes actually um JavaScript promises okay well so many so many things are coming in hold on hold on when it is high what are they dying everybody Voronoi I died I'm afraid of that but it is something that goes on the list I think I need can I just please right now just put de Launay triangulation and then if I can manage to do that the next step then then you can tell me to do Voronoi I need to build up to it okay so the other okay we hold on David had said something procedurally generated textures yeah what did I mean by that I so apparently in a video I said that I wanted to generate do procedurally generated textures I think I'll need to like go back dive back into that tictactoe ai yes a wire world cellular automata to C++ yeah okay interesting all right so um now let me look at another so the course that I'm actually teaching where I need to make some videos to go along with it github.com slash Schiffman no no it's in the ml 5 organization under intro to ml arts ima oh how come I'm not signed in I guess I won't worry about that right now so I'm gonna look at this syllabus because I want to make videos for all of these things so I've made videos about image classification I've made videos about transfer learning I'm gonna be making a video it goes under the ml list but I'm not ready to it's happening for sure but I'm not ready to announce it yet but it has to do with so I'll be coming to that pretrained models physical interactions so I think that I want to do so another topic is image segmentation models in ml 5 so that's at the moment that's you net I guess I'm you net and there's another one body pics so those are two I mean that I would even do today you might have you know I'm kind of like I feel like I'm here till 700 so another a little over an hour but I have some other things I think I might do today but that's that goes on that list there I've already got the ml 5 neural network data collection model training data collection model training convolutional neural networks what the heck did I mean by that oh dear oh not I don't know what happen I don't know what I'm doing with that so on the syllabus I don't know what's happening with that recurrent neural networks I do want to do more with so let me go back here so I want to do I want to do I want to do interactive sketch RNN I have a sketch or an end video but I want to do interactive sketch are an N and that is going to relate directly to doing RDP so I need to do our DP to go along with that I'm gonna move this opensource thing somewhere else because the machine learning list is going to get long so opensource what did I have right now we you really just had to do something for hack tober fest I wrote git and github but I actually feel like I need I don't want to put general things on here I do that too much like I want like specific video topics so like generator function is a specific video topic soak a week suggesting explaining how filters and pooling layers work yeah I would like to do a video on that I'm waiting into the territory of where ml5 kind of like hides and obscures those things but I'm gonna talk about it in my class at NYU so I don't know let's I'm gonna table that okay data collection in a Python environment trading and uh magenta let's put that on the list this is not my strength but I'm gonna try to do something with did I make a video and sound classification I did but I'm gonna do like a maybe a melody generator RNN so I wanted to do something with that run more stuff with runway I'm gonna do like yeah I mean this interactive image synthesis so that's also a thing that I want to do I did a few videos like I've done videos on this already but I haven't really done the videos on this so I'm gonna do interactive image synthesis for sure which is another basically image segmentation but in the other direction so I'm gonna say image I know that segmentation but like in the other direction so interactive image synthesis so and I should emphasize that for these topics I'm really using higherlevel tools so I'm using ml 5 and I'm using runway which is why I'm not sure what to put about like CNN on here convolutional neural network because I don't think that what I'm gonna do or have the time for or the the ability to really this semester is like program a convolutional neural network from scratch but I could use tensor flow ji you know what we're putting them putting that on there CN n because even if I don't do it in my course at a minimum I could talk about what a convolutional layer is and go through it and then make a convolutional neural network in tension flow DJ s that's a topic I feel confident in so these are all my ml topics these are some challenges that I want to do what are ones that are like highly requested Tetris thinking of game things that people are always asking me to do so oh so this is what I'm going to do next so Simon is asking doesn't melody generate or go under the challenge list probably but I'm not worried right now I'm not worrying about where the video is actually gonna live I'm just trying to organize the topics so yeah I might make it a coding challenge like melody generator but it's still with so we'll see okay so the other thing the other way that I look for these topics is by going to I'm gonna clear my filter that our assignment it's gonna look at the open issues Atari breakout I've never done Opeth because I had a guest meaning she do breakout but you know people would enjoy seeing me do it so that's a great one we add that there oh you know what's left over here's another left over neuro steering don't call it so that live stream never got edited into a condensed video which I think would have value for people because right now the only way to look at my explanation and demonstration of that is to watch like two or three hours which maybe some people actually want to do but I would like to make a shorter video out of that then this is what I like to do ah neat neat yes so neat memory game with numbers that sounds like fun let me sort this by most thumbs up so this is another way that I sort this by most thumbs up so we've got a bunch of these already storm hydrology simulator wait when did this appear I don't even remember seeing this oh wait I think I know this channel oh my goodness totally missed this totally miss this what I totally miss I totally want to do this okay oh my god I better login so I can reply to this where's my phone needs a twofactor this baby getting tweets from people asking to post my cats to Twitter oh yes I'll post my cats to Twitter don't you worry oh no I got to get some code here Authenticator plugging my stickers yeah 946 this is probably is this insecure for me like doing this live I don't think it matters it's gonna regenerate itself okay I don't know how did I miss this oh here by the way frequently is this is oh that member joining Joe Paris gets a choochoo this by the way is basically just sums up everything I think this if people could just like screenshots his I feel like this like just summarizes my entire life right here and I would just use all of them oh it didn't even I forgot how to do it that's so weird I was like oh it's just like being slow whatever there we go store but be very very careful about doing these emojis correctly there we go good enough good enough okay well I've lost a lot of viewers could work Schiffman ah a new member thank you thank you to Joe Paris for joining us a new member I'll talk about the membership stuff in a minute okay going back nope going oh here okay computer vision fluid dynamics 3d water physics computer craft Turtles Oh bro Noi electron I totally will happily do that so that goes under J s topics or open source let's put it here electron tetris pi day github tires in convert Karman vortex street and that looks terrifying tariffs oh no no we're fluid stuff help that marching cubes oh oh I like this this is awesome Collatz conjecture like that so I have by the way I have a whole new way I'm gonna pick challenges that I've just thought of it like kind of a sort of thing about it today so and those are two David Wright's those are two things I saw in rainbow topics I'm not sure what that's referring to another new member candle hitokiri no all right so I think this is I'm just doing this one page hexagonal grid what's this exactly yeah I think this could actually be really good and Oh red blobs games is like one of my favorite websites and this is looks like some very helpful information that I could probably follow I'm looking for there we go look at that yeah let's do that so that's also a coding challenge so this is good cuz I've got I'm at the bottom of the whiteboard here there's another new member with a Cyrillic name Russian name I believe that I cannot pronounce one two three four five six seven eight nine so this is a good these are things I need to get to that I did before I mean I'm sure there are more things but let me talk about now Oh nightbot yes I've so many people have recommended nightbot to me I don't know I don't know if that's like I think let me I guess I guess I can make another category here I've kind of out of room but which is stream improvements let's brainstorm some of these right now so nightbot what else oh I want to do more with the stream deck I guess I'll just put things here if they come up all right Oh pacman and whirly noise yep so I'm a little bit afraid to do pacman but I'll put it on the list I'm very afraid to do whirly noise but we shouldn't live in fear of these topics there we go all right so I think I want to do some coding today so let me just talk about some kind of administrative stuff in terms of my plans so I am revamping not significantly the membership slash patron program I haven't I'm not fully decided about any stuff and a huge thank you to psy who has come on board as a coding trained community manager has been thinking through a lot of this stuff communicating with those of you who have joined helping you make sure you get your stuff in the mail if you have questions about being a patron or a member or if you are one and you haven't received something that you were promised please reach out directly to psy you can do that in the slack channel through a direct message if you don't have a slack invite then you should reach out to info at the coding train comm or sigh that's CY at the coding train comm David I do want to showcase contributions yes David do you think you could make me like a bitly link or something like that because that way I can just get to that document you made very quickly so Nathan go to bed and don't worry that not all the livestreams won't all be at this time this is just this week I'm going to definitely do some earlier in the day okay so one of the main things that I'm changing about being a patron or a member is I don't think that were male people signed books anymore I would love to be able to get people signed books so I'm trying to think of a new gift and I'm working with standard so if you're not familiar with a standard they are a company that does a lot of different services for different YouTube creators oh you can't see me I've been in the wrong screen for like the longest time there I am over there camera bot is a must yeah okay stream improvements camera bot so I'm hoping to launch a new merchandise store with standard helping me design some stuff and then also have a special like gift that would go to patrons and members only and hopefully I can't I don't know I the spirit of what I'm doing I would like to send this gift out to everyone so even if you joined like however many years ago but that would most likely anyway I'm still figuring that out but will the thing that I'm changing is that I'm going to YouTube membership platform and people are joining through YouTube there are two ways that you currently can support the coding train one is through patreon and one is through YouTube membership YouTube membership doesn't have levels right now and patreon does and so I think I'm going to add those levels to YouTube's membership and then there are certain things that YouTube's membership allows me to do for example have YouTube member only live streams and you get little I mean emojis and because that's what people that sort of things so I'm conflicted I'm not choosing to shut down patreon yet but I might recommend if you want the full suite of benefits to join through you to youtube memberships anyway and I'm happy to answer questions about that or talk about that more at a later date so sarcasm as a service wrote joined up just in time to get my sign book I hope that doesn't mean you joined today you know here's the reason why I can't send the sign books I'll tell you why I can't figure out a way to do it that doesn't cost more than $50 to ship a book internationally it's also a tremendous amount of work and get behind and people who they get late they get lost in the mail so it just doesn't seem very sustainable and I don't even know if it's a thing that people want that much so I if you have ideas or thoughts about the various types of things that people are interested in and benefits I mean mostly I don't wanna spend too much time on this because mostly I'm here just doing this YouTube livestream thing it's nice to have this community of people who are part of the member program it's sort of like it there's many benefits to that beyond just like you know some funding for the channel that allows me to do various things and hire people to work on projects and like sort of keep myself motivated to be honest but that's not my my highest priority but I do want to make it something that is sustainable and meaningful for people who are joining but you're not gonna miss anything by not joining you will not miss anything all the content that I do will always just be on the channel or you know on github and that sort of thing there's no a premium content okay so and some people are asking about the member only live streams so the member only live streams are typically live streams where I'm testing out an idea or doing an offline recording session of something that I'm gonna publish as a recorded video so the only thing you might miss if you don't catch a member only live stream is a little bit of behind the scenes sort of chatter and flourish like really if I'm trying to figure out I'm Nathan I think I saw a message about helping me tune the audio settings like that I would do in a member only live stream well as much as you all might have enjoyed me for a half an hour trying to do a whole lot of audio testing okay discord server has been suggested I yeah yeah where's that discord I am very open to that I feel like I'm out of my element here as like an old fogey not that old of a foggy fogey nonetheless and I don't know right now the ways that the community communicates are git and github for all of the sort of code examples and suggesting topics sorry github is not get and github github is the website where I keep all the source code and there's the issues for topic suggestions a better system for topics you suggestions it's definitely needed and wanted but that's the system right now there's YouTube YouTube comments I used to read I still intend to read every single comment I'm like two months behind I kind of like popped in and out but I just like lost the ability to keep up with it but that's the place where there's community happening YouTube comments aren't my favorite place in the world you the people that I hear from seem to be wonderful people and I'm very lucky and privileged to have thoughtful comments and I think you know there's there's lots of reasons for that that are unfortunate that not everybody is so lucky to be able to and not be harassed online as but so that's one place so we've established github YouTube you know there's social media I'm not a huge I'm not super active on Twitter but that's where you'll find me the Instagram is run by psy we have a Facebook need to do some more with that so there's also that the member community where is really a place to like ask coding questions share cat pictures and just kind of like enjoy each other's company has been a slack channel but you know it's not sustainable for me to pay for slack because it's around five dollars per person and if someone's joined for five dollars like it doesn't even pay for itself so some people have suggested discord and maybe there's me I think there's an unofficial discord there's a reddit so that's me I'm really open to and maybe we can have some more discussion about that in what is currently the existing slack Channel okay I did spin up a whole Mastodon instance when I was on a Mastodon kick it was about a year ago but I let it as many things happen on the internet I just let it fall away that's that okay all right could you please do a video you have videos on map and reduce how about a video on ma nodes and transducers New York's video on the wavefunction alright so here's the thing what I would like oh I thought of another coding challenge I don't have room on the board anyway I might even just do it today I'm tired I gotta do some coding before I go so again this was my practice get back into the swing of things I have some other so I have some other things that I'm hoping to do some a new kind of video that I'm gonna try to do on the channel but I almost think too much about it before I do it pipe I shot a pilot and it was like a total mess so I'm gonna reshoot that pilot and see how that goes it's a video that I could kind of video that I can do when I'm not here at NYU that I can actually do from home so that's that's coming let's see if it's not alone be a livestream thing David Schneider asked is there a way to pledge more than five dollars a month with YouTube memberships I thought I was mentioning this and I think I lost my train of thought and didn't get there so David you really you can get my attention without doing a super chat but thank you very much so yes so YouTube memberships has multi tiered levels I just haven't put them in yet so I'm working with psy to do that and if in an ideal world those would be up as of next week so but that's that's that's the go I'm gonna have equivalent levels on YouTube and patreon and I would just remove the patreon but whenever I say I'm gonna do that I hear from above at your Villa sites please don't do that I just like using patreon as a platform so I see no reason not to keep it open but it's a platform that I'm less invested in paying attention to I mean there's a lot of downsides of doing everything on YouTube so I have mixed feelings about that but I think I'll get some benefits from the YouTube channel knowing who the members are but who knows welcome to I'm getting all these new members welcome to a new member bilal shot hello and thank you very much okay I believe people are joining when I've done absolutely nothing but talk for what is now an hour in 20 minutes geez Louise I need a little break I don't have any of my by the way I'm seeking seeking an animator with a special love for unicorns and rainbow like aesthetics who might like to work on some interstitial animations that I can play during live streams like about to start on a break and technical difficulties reach out I guess right now on Twitter if it send me a link to like your reel or portfolio or something I'm looking to hire somebody to do that kind of work okay that's not promising I wanted to see if this example worked as I was thinking of using it I was thinking of trying to do I since I you call a lien out of tune and the ukulele tuner I have doesn't have a battery I was thinking why did that not work I'm handed taping here let's see is there a pitch detection example here let's try the piano pitch detection let's close this there we go this was a coding challenge I was thinking of doing today can anyone tell me if I'm getting anything remotely accurate that I could actually use yeah I think I could do this if it works it works all right so that's one thing I could do before I go the other thing is here so I happen to listen to I don't know if I should admit this I mean I actually don't mind admitting this but I happen to listen to a podcast you know I had a wheel a spinning wheel quite a long time ago right you've seen me do this right where I will go and I go to this like I think it's like Schiffman github do slash randomizer I think is where it lives and I've done this and I'll take my list of coding challenge ideas like marching squares RDP more rows and like ASCII art right if I take that list and I put it here into this randomizer and I go to spin I get this nice wheel which I think I can grab and I can I thought I could spin it or I could press this button spin the wheel and then it picks one randomly and I have you kahlil's a little flat and I would then oh sorry let me do that again sorry I started looking at the chat so I used to do this and I would have a bunch of options and then it would pick one and I would then try to do that as the coding challenge and work fell off I wasn't sure what the pic I'd like put this away and today I was been listening to this podcast where the podcast has a wheel I've never seen it because I'm just listening to the podcast but they spin it I think there's a website actually where they have the wheel I think it's called it's called rob and a Kiva a podcast like that look it up maybe we can build them like some software tool for their wheel if they don't think they already have one but at the end of each podcast they spin the wheel for the topic for the next one and it occurred to me that that's the missing piece for me and they have like a wheel they have a wheel waiting room they have rejected ideas so I feel like what I did today was my little exercise of like things that could make it on to the wheel like this is a list of topics that if I spun the wheel and it landed on one I could be willing to commit to doing it the following week so in other words instead of like having this list and being surprised by the topic I would pick it in advance I'm not saying that I would I'm and so I would do somewhere in between like going and programming the whole thing like all week and then just coming in coding it live and no preparation whatsoever I think that no preparation whatsoever gets me into a little bit of trouble with some of these topics like for example Delauney triangulation no preparation whatsoever is totally fine for me for like ASCII art probably for the Mara Rose you can potentially break out some of these but some of these that require some research and thinking so I would do a little bit of research and thinking and reading and prepare not code but I prepare little materials and then I would come and do it as a coding challenge so what I proposed I was gonna do this I think I don't have time I was actually gonna do a coding job today which was like program a wheel spinner and then we as a community could like make it and I would have several different JSON files that would be and maybe I should do this actually that would be like the wheel topics the wheel waiting room and there could be certain things like we could get really crazy with this where there's like one thing on the wheel is like actually a separate pick something random out like it could be there could be like a game spot so maybe there's like a larger spot that just gains and then when it lands on games I would pick a you know pingpong ball out of a bucket that I don't know what the next metaphor is or the next visual like that I would pick you know breakout Tetris or pacman or whatever so and then and I don't know that I would do a wheel spin every single week because some coding challenges would require a full live stream some coding challenges can be done to 15 to 20 minutes hahaha and then other weeks I really want to be going through my con and machine learning content for my course so it's gonna be hard to balance all of this but that's kind of my plan right now and if I can get this other way that making videos off the ground I might actually mostly do the coding challenges through that mechanism which is a way of doing a little home studio that I'm sort of setting up it's currently there's no electricity in it little little T's are there for you so I think live streaming will be kind of an issue but you know I can record a video with the extent that my battery will last it sounds very ominous I know but you'll see you'll see coming soon all right so I don't know what people think about this is Dan who is sighs so sighs spelled CY and they are the community manager for the coding train working on social media and communication with the patrons and members and helping me set up this new merchandise store and also special rewards for patrons okay all right so ah thank you perfect timing the list to the contributions thank you David the chiming couldn't be more impeccable bit dot ly to an m4 KY q TMC writes spinning wheel is lazy I'm not sure I fully understand that I'm not sure if like you mean like I should do something more interesting than a wheel spin but no I actually would love to have a big physical wheel that's what I really want I'm not good at making physical things well this work did I type this in correctly awesome so um thank you I'm David Schneider a member coding trained member who prepared this so in the time people have been submitting contributions to the website and by the way coding trained community contributions there if you don't know what I'm talking about or how to do that you can find this video which is only 12 minutes long which is shocking for me which is describes how to go through the process of submitting your contribution to the coding training website oh I know what I'm going to use the wheel for right now this is perfect oh this is great okay hold on I've got a plan 630 this is not a plan that can be accomplished in 30 minutes but this is what I'm thinking I'm going to do a coding challenge which is make a spinning wheel yeah yeah I know it could be like a bingo machine I'll get to that and then I'll spin the wheel to pick a number and show some community contributions and then I'll try to make a ukulele tuner and yes I'll go set the point of the ukulele tuner would be to have a visual a visual to show you that you know this is a note I want it to be this is how far off I am okay okay so how do I want to do this I have this already as the thing I could also just use random org to pick a random number say the wheelspin is a little bit crazy because there's 78 so a so a bingo machine would be better the wheel needs to make a spinning wheel noise definitely definitely does how did how to approach this right now I need to think I'm not gonna read them okay it's just gonna fix up treating them to myself is it weird that I'm not reading them out loud now I'm not even thinking cuz I'm thinking about how it's weird they're not reading them out loud I did the Plinko machine before which kind of works for this I like the idea of a bucket full of compart five for your blinker challenge with numbers yeah Simon and I think alike prize wheel an Amazon fairly cheap bingo machines too but they're more spending money is no object for me if I could get myself a bingo machine whatsoever I will spend all of my patreon money on a bingo machine for sure that is not a not even a question you have to read them out loud okay good point all right what if I did one of those um prices right things right now well welcome to member Luke Finch where you like to pull down the big thing and it like spins around I could do that probably in processing see this is why I need a plan I can't just come here and expect to come up with the idea in my mind spin the wheel bingo spin wheel pling pling Co Co dice rolling oh that's an interesting idea dice rolling that sounds like a very elaborate physics simulation though that's not within my realm of possibility right now can I just gonna do the ukulele tuner let's do the ukulele tuner let's let's do the ukulele tuner so by the way all of you who are joining actually a very curious question when you join as a Youtube member in theory are supposed to be taken to a screen that has a little like welcome message with a link to a Google for did that happen if not please email CY at the coding train calm okay don't think you have time to make something tonight I know I could do a spinning wheel I feel like that's like a quick thing it's like everybody always wonders how our quirks nice beginnerfriendly coding challenge we're gonna make a spinning wheel an ad so what I can put I could divide it into 78 little slices right or I could pick random numbers another way it's sorry K week actually I believe it's not coding train com I don't think I have coding train comm coding train comm is listed for sale so I would totally spend $1,000 on a bingo machine but I'm not spending it on a domain name that's just ridiculous give me a break duh the dye is very important it makes it sound important I am the coding train I'm not coding drink I am the coding train what are people in the hallway can just hear me you just hear me in the hallway probably it's gonna say choo choo in the chat you know that I'm gonna do it okay um all right it was pretty fluffy okay once for tens and ones for you the wheel snowflake emoji I'm trying understand what that means I'm definitely a snowflake if you pre chose the value reverse simulated the wheel Luke your math is missing an important piece of there's a certain percentage which is mine I'm listening from the hallway John Walthall your name has a hall in it that's believable but I'm gonna need a little proof but need you to knock on the door if you're in the hallway but I need you to knock on the door okay this sitting around trying to decide is no good we're gonna make a ukulele tuner and see how that goes no no crap is it look at my password manager I can't remember how come I'm not logged in anymore oh wait it was like trying to dashlane me in right oh but I don't know what that is okay what am I looking for yes my password manager really hmm all right I guess I forgot my password uh I can only assume this is the email I used does it send it see how unprepared I am now I'm gonna look at my email this is ridiculous okay I got an email reset my password oh I remember what I made it now because I didn't actually like do it with my password manager and this should be good enough okay I am going to do a coding challenge how's the focus am I out of focus is this okay what do I have I have the noise thing on I'm gonna turn that off because if this gets edited into a coding challenge it's off okay then then we can always no run like a noise suppression thing after the fact okay I'm also gonna need I remember like when I first by the way this is the second attempt at this long time ago and it totally didn't work at all but there was like a frequency to piano note like Wiki Wikipedia page I think I looked at piano key frequencies which I'm going to need and there's like a formula for it but I can also just look up the actual frequency here great so this is what I'm looking for the ukulele would be which the ukulele is ukelele notes are no I want the notes for the strings it's gonna give me a nice yeah AEC G and this is gonna probably be like a four is that right someone's got to know this where's that 440 that's what I'm guessing uh okay all right focus is good okay thanks everybody by the way just another little plug coating garden with CJ has had a ton of content I did I get notifications on fication boyfriend using something called like feather J s I've never even heard of that go check out the coding garden with CJ I've been not live streaming forever and but there's so much happening on the Internet okay just try to think of what's a good opening for this coding challenge hello and welcome to a coding train coding challenge this is my first kind of challenge in this new coding trade studio oh my goodness but my ukulele is very out of tune and I actually have a ukulele tuner but the battery's dead so I thought here we are let's see if we can make a ukulele tuner in the browser using p5 GS and ml 5 j s voice just got lost right so Oh editing is a wonderful thing to do this I'm going to use ml 5gs library which is a machine learning library that I've used in tutorials and various other coding challenges it's built on top of tensorflow GIS and it is friendly it is I would start the whole thing over this is just like the old days I get to do this as many times as I want see this is a paintbrush which was used to paint this wall behind me hello and welcome to a coda challenge oh that is terribly out of tune this coding challenge is making a ukulele tuner and it is the first coding challenge that I'm doing here in this new coding train studio I like it better the first time to 12th root of 2 to the power of the number of halfsteps yes yes I can barely play a guitar all right here we go last time no more breaks no more stops this is ridiculous that I do this I have to not do this anymore this is my new year's the new studio resolution is no second takes editing is fine editing is fine just no second takes hi oh hello that was loud hello and welcome to a coding challenge from the coding train it sounds better than the other room I'm glad to hear that there's no echo in here and I actually have carpeting that I'm planning to put down which isn't put down yet but once it is it will be okay I'm back with a coding challenge oh and my ukulele is very out of tune I'm in a new studio the tuning of the ukulele did not last in the move to the new studio and the battery and my Glalie tuner is dead you don't need to know all this information so I thought what's a better opportunity than to do at coding Johnson I've been wanting to do for a while which is make a ukulele tuner that would work in the browser and so to do that I am going to use some JavaScript libraries that I use in a lot of different videos one is ml5 j s ml five is a machine learning library built on top of tensorflow JS it has a lot of pre trained models in it one of which is a pitch detection model I think I could use that to to the ukulele I hope we'll see how well it works and then I'm also going to use p5.js and this is the p5 GS web editor I'm gonna try programming the whole thing right here in the browser and see what happens so what do I need to do so I guess the first thing that I should do is import the ml 5 library so I'm gonna go to getting started oh look at this actually the easiest way for me to do this is just click on this link which makes a p5 web better sketch with the ml 5 just library added so I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna go back over here and I'm gonna click over here and then over here and I'm gonna hit save I'm gonna run it and make sure it's happening there it is so ml 5 has now been loaded we can see the version is zero point three point zero since there are zero point three point one I think there's a slightly newer release let's check that out who knows you're probably watching this when sometime in the future where we don't keep track of open source software by numbers anymore this is release rainbow but yes my suspicion was right there's actually a version zero point three point one so let me go and update that by changing it here hiding the point one this is very important that this is in this coding challenge you must learn to update your amplify version when you are making a ukulele tuner and then I'm gonna I don't need this console log anymore although I guess I could try it one more time just to sort of see there we go and for a minute just because I'm kind of standing in front of stuff and I don't have it set up I'm planning to record everything with these separate green and separate background but I'm not ready to do that just yet so I'm just going to do a screen recording so I have that just in case at some point match up if Ed 'its is together needs to take me out of this so I'm now recording the screen okay thanks Marcos all right all right where was I so now that I have my p5 sketch here I can go back to the ml 5 website I'm gonna go to reference and here we can see one of the things about ml 5 is all of the different functions that are in ml 5 are separated by media category there's this other category called helpers and boy do I have some videos coming up about that for you someday soon I'm gonna go to sound and I'm gonna look at this pitch detection one so here's the documentation time out hold on a second what just curious when I there's a little there's a mistake here I just realized I think everyone I had the pitch detection one going oh I have to upload the model that's crazy so that's a mistake the model isn't hosted all right let's see here I didn't realize this was gonna be a little extra layer of complexity I need to figure this out before I go any further here it is here it is okay great so let me just I don't know how big this is so let me just download the oh you can't see I'm really not standing in the right place the camera I need to do something about the where everything is this should actually I think I should be putting the sounds on the other side of me but it's not really easy for me to do that right now I'll leave that here I'm downloading this huge thing this is ridiculous it's at 38% so I can plug this right now see I'm just so out of practice here there we go this is what I wanted to do the stream deck can be over here oh you know I'm such an idiot I could just move the desk over and like there's no room to the right of the computer for anything yeah how about moving the desk dumdum okay hold on everybody now I have my sound effects and my stream deck and I'm standing over here and I'm more to the side I'm bigger than I used to be people told me when I was doing a test that I was too small but now I think I'm too big okay okay okay to this download okay sorry everyone I think I am back to what I was doing it's very confusing the camera is like a little bit there we go ah I think this works for me now I'm like I just have to angle myself a little bit okay but it's the desk now and the whiteboard camera shot good question no it is not the whiteboard camera shot does not start until right about here which if I go back is you know pretty far off okay should I just start the whole thing over I should definitely start the whole thing over right yes right exactly that's what I think I'm so glad we agree on this okay here we go yeah I really would like to have a roaming camera in this room because then I could then I could I could like show you the stuff in the room but another time okay I think it was better to have this up non FFT pitch finder revisit yeah there's there's many other ways to do pitch detection but whatever I'm gonna do it this way oh my you clearly is very out of tune what luck this happens to be the make a ukulele tuner coding challenge what a coincidence I'm here in my new studio located it's not my studio but it is a studio it's in Brooklyn at New York University and I'm doing my first coding challenge from here um I I don't really know what makes sense that I just like if this is a moment to do some sort of particular coding challenge I don't know I'm just gonna do go to the ukulele because the tuner I have the batteries broken my ears not so good so we'll see if this works I'm gonna use the ML v JS library this is a JavaScript library that I'm lucky enough to participate in its development and I try to make tutorials with so this works well it has a pre trained model for pitch detection which I'll talk about in a moment and then I'm also going to use the p5 web editors a little tricky to do this in the p5 web editor because it could involve I'm going to upload a bunch of stuff but the good news is I already have the ml 5 library right here all you need to do if you want if you're in the p5 web editor at editor dot p5.js dot org if you go to the ml 5 website under getting started you'll see that all you need to do is either add this script tag or even better you can see that here where is that where is it where is it where is it there it is sorry should just started with this all you need to do is click on this link which will open a web app a sketch in the p5 web editor with the ml 5 library already important ok so we're there I could make sure this is working by saying something like you know console.log ml v dot version I'm going to hit run and I see the version down here so I've got ml 5 going now what do I need to do next so if I go to the ml 5 website I'm going to go to a reference and in reference I can see that the various functionality of ml 5 is divided into different categories based on media and what I definitely want to do is look at sound here I want to find a sound model and lo lo and behold there is a model called pitch detection now I should mention that there are ways of analyzing a sound for pitch but you don't need machine learning for I'm you can do FFT analysis and look at the different various amplitudes of different frequencies and pick the one that's left there's a variety of ways in people much smarter who know much more about sound could tell you how to do that and I'm sure you can find other tutorials but I'm here I want to try to use the ml 5 library but this really begs the question like well how is this working you said something about pre trained model so ml 5 is comes with a certain model known as crepe I don't know if that's how you pronounce that I like to say clip which is a convolutional representation for a pitch estimation or clip I like fruit little banana maybe a little Nutella it's kind of good I don't know it's too much for me then to tell us this is about pitch detection and so you can read a lot more about this particular model and what data was used to train it which is always a question you should ask when you're using someone's pre trained model because there's a lot of things that go wrong or right or be problematic potentially about a model based on the data it was trained and this paper describes that in more detail you can even run this demo in the browser I'll do it right now let me not allowed I don't know why it's not allowing my microphone oh here we go let me tweak yeah yeah I'm gonna always allow and I'm gonna hit refresh I'm gonna click here to start the demo I cannot do anything well this this is really a fail all right let's skip that let's not you oldest about a big magic yo I'm not starting over again you could click on this link over here to see a demo of it in the browser but we're gonna do this in ml 5 and thank you a big THANK YOU to Hannah Davis who actually did the porting of this model into ml 5 and I'll include some links to her work in this video's description ok so here I am on the ml 5 documentation page and it looks a little bit like yeah what's going on here so I need to create a pitch object and there's some sort of like string dot slash model what's that audio context mic stream model loaded slot stuff I need to figure out here well the first thing I want to figure out is all right well I see I should now I'm looking over here and I see the chat and real cygnus is asking what's just asking not criticizing didn't he use this little while ago and it didn't go over well yes and have I done how am i taking the time to check to see if it would go well this time no but here we go I think it's gonna work because the bugs that I found last time got fixed we'll see the first thing I want to tackle here is what this dot model is so a lot of times when using ml 5 it's going to load the model files from a URL and you might actually put the URL into your code or ml 5 might just know the URL automatically it's saved on a Google server or some other server and ml 5 it's saved on github and like pointed to by ml 5 in this case this is a case where I actually need to have the model files with my code this was probably gonna change just by making this video i browse we probably should host a version of the creped model that you could access through ml 5 more easily but luckily if I go to the ml 5 data and models github repo where I am right here github.com / ml 5 j s I can navigate to models pitch detection CREP and these are all the model files so this is very typical of any pretrained machine learning model they'll be a JSON file the is essentially the file that describes the model oh this is the neural network architecture these are all the pieces of it I could actually even click in this and start to like look at it you can see it's the model topology what it's using various things like that we you know investigate this more on your own and then there's all these other files which are the actual weights the numbers the sort of secret sauce of the model after it's been trained all of those little parameters of the neural network are all stored in all these files now I've actually downloaded all of these already and you can see them they're right here in a folder on the desktop here so what I want to do right now is add all of them to the p5 web editor let's see how that goes normal I've really only worked with like uploading like little media files and sound files but I think this is gonna work so I'm gonna go here I'm gonna create a new chart for you to see this but I'm gonna create a new folder and I'm gonna call this crops up and then I'm gonna do add file and I'm hoping that I could just select all of these and drag them here oh oh whoa I'm not plugged in anymore you can't upload files of this type that is definitely a problem so how did that other oh I have a feeling that the way this was uploaded was like through a secret backdoor to the web editor will that work no no don't I have a better idea no better idea better idea so the fact that they're here sorry here means that I can turn this into a J s deliver right because J s deliver and github work together no this is not where I want to look don't you love how everything always goes wrong there's a way to turn any github repo into a CDN like this so I should be able to do j s liver github ml v j s repo ml5 data and models and then just the path so if I do pitch detection crepe model JSON to see pitch detection crepe model JSON yes whatever reason the lighting in here of share life is pointing out my gray hair the old lighting used to really like obscure the gray of my hair I don't know why but it's looked much more visible in here you know it's it's distinguished package size exceeded the configurate limit of 50 megabytes try what but the model dot JSON file isn't 50 megabytes is it it's 16 kilobytes these are tiny files doesn't make any sense oh the whole I forgot models okay thank you Thank You Simon models I think right here right yeah boom all right now let's see just curious I'm gonna grab the example I'm sure this is once again I could just do this like locally and then oh are you serious says it loaded the model trouble believing it no it didn't load I got an error hold on yeah 403 what's in error 403 I mean it's not gonna work it doesn't host it like this does it huh did that actually work oh wow that works oh great so I could just use the URL to it Oh silly me I'm going to back up here okay okay okay I think this is couple have no viewers left thank you for sticking with me in this we're gonna get there okay where am i where am i where am i it's here so if I go back to add file I'm just gonna do this again to like cuz this is where I left off so I forgot that the web editor currently only supports certain file types like JSON or CSV or a JPEG image files sound files so these model files that include all the weights that can't be uploaded to the web editor that's something that might change in the future but luckily I can actually I can actually just point to the model files that are on github itself so this particular URL right here where all these model files are stored there's actually a way to turn any file that's sitting on github into a URL that you can load like from from a content delivery network and so a way of doing if this is a nice blog post that I found on go make things calm that just shows this base URL so I can always access files through this URL cdnas deliver net /gh for github and then the path to the username the repo and the path to the files so I actually have done that right here I'm gonna hit refresh and you can see look this is that model dot JSON file and now I can actually look and see oh it's all of the configuration information about this particular model and I can grab this and I can put this into my code so let me close this I'm gonna go to the top I'm gonna say Const model URL equals and I'm gonna paste that in there so now and then I actually want just the path because I want the model to load all the files so I'm going to then remove model JSON and this is the path to the CREP model and I can go ahead and just delete this from here this folder it's gone I guess I need to also delete the files one at a time let me do that and now I am ready to start putting in some code so I'm going to make a variable called pitch detector let's just call it pitch I'm gonna say pitch equals ml five pitch detection let me give myself some more space pitch detection I'm going to go back to the reference page and these are the things that I need to load so let me copy paste these are the parameters that I need to pass in name is here Oh I'm sitting here wondering why I have an error and of course if I declare a variable as a contest I can't just have it not equal anything and then assign it later so this is gonna have to be let and I'm gonna make a lot of people angry right now by making everything let just to sort of like simplify things and now I have the I've now created a pitch detection object now what I want is to give it a bunch of arguments to create itself one of which is the model itself so this is no longer a local directory of files I'm going to say model URL I need to get this audio context in Mike's stream let me come back to that but I also need a model loaded function so that I know that the model has been loaded I can't type there we go all right so audio context and Mike stream what are those things well let's hope the documentation tells us audio context the browser audio context to use hmm stream media stream the media stream to use I'm a little bit lost to be honest but can I get some more information you know what I think we might do here is let's just look at the example so the example here if I look at the example code it's showing that ah perfect so an audio context I could just get by saying get audio context perfect so this happens to be something that's built into JavaScript it's part of the Web Audio API I would assume and I'm sure somebody in the chatter or somebody will leave a comment to explain what this is a little bit more but I'm just gonna go ahead and put it in here I'm gonna say audio context equals get audio context and then for the mic stream this is actually me connecting to the builtin microphone or potentially I could specify a different microphone and that I'm going to connect by using the p5 sound library so I can make a variable called mic and then I could say mic equals p5 audioin I believe is the function so this is the function this is part of p5 sound KS which incidentally is a library that I have accessing here in index.html look at this I am on such an old version of p5 let's update this stuff I think the current version is 9.0 so while I'm here I'm gonna update that go back to here and then I think I can get this mic stream from the p5 mic object I'll just look it up here Mike dot stream perfect so this p5 audio and I need to say Mike dot start start pitch Mars I don't see any function Oh aah Oh interesting look at this so I wasn't paying close attention I didn't really I didn't really think what I'm doing because it's I got to do two things here I need to load them I need to access the microphone and I need to load the model when I load the model I want to connect it to the microphone and maybe I need to think about the sequence going on here because as you know if you've done programming or watched a kodi train video before things in JavaScript have an asynchronously so maybe I don't need to do it this way that's in the example but I probably do let's try to do it not the way that's in the example and see if it works it's probably gonna break without being thoughtful about the order so I'm just gonna say Mike dot stream right now then I'm gonna say Mike dot start and I'm gonna have a callback like listening and then I'll write a function called listening and I'll say console.log listen I'm gonna take off this auto refresh because it's doing crazy stuff listening okay here we go so let me uncaught syntax error invalid or unexpected token line 20 what I don't see any invalid token lying Ted listening can I read property start of undefined there we go so this is an issue cannot read property start of undefined why is the mic undefined let's go back to the example new new I forgot to say new so the new keyword is very important when you are calling a constructor to create an object you're required to say new there's something really interesting that's going on here which is that I need the new here new p5 audio in but how come I'm not saying new ml5 pitch detection Oh do you know why it's because people like to do things in different ways this is actually a little bit more standard from what I understand in the world of JavaScript this is not actually calling an object constructor a little clue to that is the lowercase P right there this is calling a function that's part of the ml 5 library the function itself calls an object constructor but you actually don't bend and the new happens in there but our interface to it as the user of the library we just called a pitch detection function that's why I have sometimes I say these are the list of functions in p5 instead of like the LEAs or the list of objects or classes but this is actually calling the p5 audioin constructor all right let's see if that fixed things all right listening model loaded that's promising so it was happy it seems to be happy with the order that I'm doing things in now right the order of the example is to make sure the mic has started and then load the model but this doesn't seem so upset maybe it's going to work okay and it's in pausing for a second to think about what I'm doing next okay so what's the next step well what I want to do just from just to get this working is that the pitch is going to come in as a real number a frequency value so I just want to draw that frequency value in the canvas so how do I get it presumably there's some callback there's a callback model loaded but I need to actually tell it to listen so let's go back to the I could look at the example but let's look at the documentation pitch get pitch and here's a callback so this is what I want to do this is like the function that I call to ask for a pitch and then when it hears something it console logs it so I should be able to do this in the model loaded function I'm gonna say pitch get pitch and then I'm gonna write a function called got pitch because I'm trying to do this in a very longwinded highly descriptive way where I now have a separate function called got pitch and then it receives an argument like frequency and I'm going to actually draw that well no let's just console.log it console.log frequency okay let's run this bottle loaded because I make some eyes all right here we go la pitch frequency it is not working at all well I got an error could not fail to XD all right this is not working because it failed to execute create media stream source on the audio context parameter one is not of type media stream I have a feeling that this is the problem right I did things out of the order now is the problem assuming the order is the problem so I need to make sure the microphone is ready before I start trying to load them on so in this sense let's try to re let's try to redo this order so Mike audio in Mic start listening once I am listening then I will load the model then once the model is loaded I will call get pitch got pitch if I look at the documentation get pitch oh oh oh wahwahwah I forgot something else really important I can never remember this I don't know why ml 5 functions callbacks are all written with this style known as error first callbacks so you must include two arguments the first one is the error this enforces you to think about error handling which is the thing I don't really think about but at least a low five is trying to get me to do it and I should try to be I should be an error checking kind of person so this should have error frequency and I could do a little error handling like I could say if if error console dot error error otherwise console dot log the frequency and I'm now actually realizing that there's a slight inconsistency in the way that the pitch detection model works in ml five one of the things that is all of the other features of ml five do is they return an object so maybe it gives you an object that has the value you're looking for a confidence score so probably the raw frequency shouldn't be in there it should be an object maybe it actually already is and I'm wrong about that let's try running this one more time oh no I like that I'm seeing something nah do we have an error the terror that the debtor let that all right so what's going on here frequency is no and only did it once do I have to continue to call get the pitch it doesn't do it continuously I think that might be it let's look at the example so this is promising and that something came out did the air come out know if it was an error that came out it would have been read because console dot error will print something to the console that's read so frequency came out but frequency came out as null that's fine it detected no frequency I wasn't making a sound and it's not checking anymore the reason why it's not checking anymore is it doesn't know to keep checking I have to explicitly ask it to keep checking so I say give me the pitch and then once it's got the pitch it logs it and then I say give me that pitch again so this is a little bit of like a way of kind of calling this recursively this is the kind of recursion cuz it's not exactly it's a loop really so let me let me run this there we go so when it detects a frequency it console logs it and let's see higher frequency frequency so now I don't want to just see this in the console anymore I want to create a variable I'm gonna call it freak and I'm gonna I'm gonna set it to zero just so it has some value to start with and then here I'm going to say whenever I get a frequency sorry what's that got pitched oh right here I'm gonna say if I don't want to give it a sign it null so I'm gonna say if frequency freak equals frequency I might want to account for null in a better way and then now in the draw function which is quite unnecessary but I'm gonna do this anyway I am going to now say whoops give me some space under here I'm now going to say textaligncenter text 3 quick C I'm gonna put width / 2 height divided by 2 and let's say let's do text align Center center so it centers in both horizontally and vertically I'm gonna say a fill to 55 and texassized like 64 and then I'm gonna say frequency to fixed too so I want to see two decimal places and now let's run this okay hey let's grab the ukulele so the ukulele notes are a ECG is that right AEC G so this should be an a this should be 440 if I'm right so there's a there's math that you can do this with but I can also just look it up here yeah right there look at that even it's even highlighted I guess it's highlighted cuz it's like a four so this is the frequency I want so let's just say I just wanted to I'm gonna just tune the a string then maybe I'll like do the rest but kind of like speed up the video or something for you so I'm gonna tune the a string people in the chat are pointing out that I could also just use a tone generator that's probably a smart idea let me do that right now just to see that it works so hold on a second let me find that URL I wonder if it's not able to pick that up Oh 440 yes about rapid mouths yeah so I think it's I know the mic is not picking up from the speaker and I wonder why that is it's getting it now why was it not getting it at 440 sorry if this is driving everybody's ears nuts oh you can't hear this that well I'm not piping the audio out let's go over here it's pretty good not perfect all right let me let me watch your ears everybody lower your volume I'm gonna send the pitch out through the multi output device so lower your lower hear volume for a second here comes is that manageable for you to listen to I know you can hear it but now I'm actually sending it out oh no I'm not yeah yeah I'm sending it out through the laptop audio itself is that bad or good there we go perfect where did that ad was that bad I see I see one comment Oh God so I could turn it way down so I'm gonna turn it way down it was it just fine before so I'm turning this way down now and I'm gonna try it again Oh barely register at all should I just have done it with just picking it up for my mic is that better what's 730 it was fine before so I'm overthinking this so guess what everybody I'm not gonna send it out I'm just gonna send it out through the speakers and let my mic get it and you know what we could always was better with just the mic okay great so never mind okay so now it should now let me just make sure yeah okay all right I'm gonna do it I'm gonna do it just with the mic okay all right so thank you to Alka in the chat who suggested this online tone generator I'll include a link to that also in the video's description I'm just going to play it and as I do this slider we can see the pitch is pretty much the pitch detection is matching I mean I'm talking which is messing it up is matching the tone that is generating now you'll notice it's not perfect right this is a machine learning model that's been trained on some data set of sounds and then it's making a guess a prediction of what it thinks it is this is not a 100% accurate analysis that you could probably do mathematically especially with a pure tone but this is an approximation that would hopefully work with a variety of different kinds of sounds that might be harder to analyze and pull out that exact pitch also no idea what I'm talking about when it comes to sound I'm just trying to get this to work all right so now what I want to do is I want to make some kind of like visual indicator so I think what would be useful here is for me to draw maybe I should draw some type of rectangle that is big when I'm Way off or smaller or maybe it's when I'm above the pitch I'm drawing it to the right when I'm below I'm drawing it to left some type of and I'm sure you hopefully will make a version of this which are much nicer more thoughtful interface but to do this I think all I would need to do is say let's difference equal I want this frequency what that frequency is minus 440 so right now I'm just tuning for a I'm just tuning the a string so then I want to draw let's do rect mode actually let's not do rec mode center let's draw a rectangle I'm going to make it white for right now I'm going to say its position is what's the size of the canvas 200 200 4 and 400 so I'm going to say it's a 200 comma 50 let's move the text way down and then so I'm gonna move this like down here and then I'm going to make the width of it difference I'm just going to multiply it by 10 just to scale it and have the height be 50 so let me just try this for a second and let me play the tone oh whoops so this is actually where the nice thing is if I give it a negative width it seems to draw it as a negative it draws the rectangle in the opposite direction I don't actually have to flip it so the question is I think times 10 is actually quite a bit so let's actually not multiply it by anything let's think about what are these differences like it's 500 that makes sense a 60 60 pixels is pretty reasonable so let's get the ukulele now or actually let's let me still use the tone so let me make it let me set it to a four let me play it so I'm not seeing any rectangle there's a little rectangle there we go I mean talking messes it up because it gets a different pitch of my voice but I could also do something right now it could be a little bit more thoughtful about this and I could map I could say let amount equals map the difference between if it's between like a hundred it's off by like a hundred and a hundred to a value between zero and one and the reason why I'm doing this is I could use the function lerp color so let me say I have the color red which is to 5500 and I have the color green which is 0 255 0 and what I want to do is when it's all the way I want to get the actual I want I want to have the actual color the lerp color solar color gives me a linear interpolation between two colors like red and green oh this is actually not what I want to do I want it to be green when it's in the center so actually I want to map the absolute value of the difference I want to map the absolute value of the difference and those are this is much easier now between zero and a hundred and I want to then when it's zero it's perfectly green when it's a hundred it's red and I don't know if this is going to actually look right and but let's do let's try it so we can see here now if I try to tune the good ukulele let's make this an a4 again that kind of works now the gig 100 is way too small says Simon I should through the chat it makes me want to cry alright let's um let's let's um let's make this a little bit fancier all right I need a bubble shift the bubble to the center yeah so this interface is terrible and there are definitely better ways I can do this a dial would actually make a lot more sense I mean I should use a dial like rotating a dial from left to right a slider shifting the bubble yeah when exact Green is zero with ya you don't even see it yeah so alright so this interface as many people that are pointing out its pretty terrible I don't know what I was thinking I know much better interface would be like a dial I encourage you to try to make that um let me at least do like something that moves back and forth so what I want to actually do is always draw this rectangle for example I don't want the size of the rectangle to have anything to do with the difference so for example I can change this to like rect mode Center and then I can draw this rectangle like 200 pixels wide so now there's always a rectangle there and then what would make more sense for me to do is to draw a circle that appears in the rectangle like 200 but at an exposition so let me just put one in the middle that's like 50 like a circle that's size 50 so that's sitting there in the middle and now I can have this circle move back and forth the exposition can be like plus the difference so for example so the difference I guess divided by some amount for right now and again I want to be much more thoughtful about how I'm doing this but I guess I'll use the I'll use the tone generator so this value 100 is a way off let's try making this like 400 oh what am i what's going on here oh it's to hold on yeah I want to make it smaller yeah it will stop here people are sending me images in the chat of tuners yes I've seen those a dial with an arrow would be good if you send me pictures in the chat it's like I have everything font everything built up so big I can't see anything anymore I can barely see the picture so generally speaking it's not super helpful the circle should change color when it's bang on the lerp color is really weird I agree I thought the lerp color would be such a good idea it's not log scale would be better I pick there's a lot of better ideas I'm trying to think of what's a simple yeah let's not use lerp color I think the lerp color was an interesting idea and you know really just having like dials that like fill in or low there's just so many nicer ways of doing this people are sending me pictures of like tuners and how they work should then CJ is writing the chat should the max value in the map be related to the width of the rectangle yeah that would make sense right so if I if the width of the rectangle is but I'm dividing difference by ten so like a way to do this a little bit more with a little bit more care would be to take this divide it by ten there have this be the like half the width of the rectangle I think which the width oregano is 200 to make this 100 and then just have that also be the offset so if I do that but the alert color is just really weird and doesn't make any sense it's really like not a good interface this lobe color thing at all so I think what I'm going to do is actually just make a much simpler interface where I am going to have this circle move back and forth I'm not actually going to change the color of the rectangle I'm going to kind of do it the opposite way I'm going to comment this out have the rectangle be white I'm going to make the circle red and then I'm gonna say if the difference is less than 2 Phil 0 255 0 and let's make it less than 1 let's try to really tune this thing and I'm going to also draw it I'm gonna scale the drawing by 10 ok all right so now and let's draw a line this is terrible I'm so bad at interfaces I shouldn't be allowed to do any of this I'm gonna draw a line at 200 sorry at 0 at 200 comma 0 to 200 comma 200 and let's let's draw that line here and say let's have the rectangle be have some alpha to it let's say stroke one hundred and Stroke wait for and then I'll get rid of the stroke here and all right so now why is it green Oh cuz it hasn't gotten a frequency yet I got to give it a frequency I'm tuning it getting tuning it getting closer oh no no it can't be less gotta be absolute value gotta be absolute value and we're gonna map I got a great idea now now we're going to map so we can do things like this now do I need logarithmic scale why isn't why is the alpha of this rectangle not changing yeah I thought if the difference is a hundred the Alpha is zero we're losing my mind what oh no I didn't rerun the sketch oh oh yeah I didn't I have an I have a crazy idea I gotta stop doing this okay so why is there Oh cuz that's I keep thinking that I'm hitting this button is rerunning this sketch there we go okay so right now and this should really be I feel like this shouldn't be an ellipse it should be a rectangle I should really turn on the auto refresh now cuz that'll it should be a rectangle that is that is at this location and then it is like five pixels wide and six fifty pixels high and it should be ten pixels wide and 75 pixels high and this should be stroke weight one there we go okay here's my interface I worked very hard on this I am now going to play a tone and I'm going to try to tune it and then when you get there and I'm gonna let myself be within three frequency values I'm going to say also this Auto refresh was a terrible idea Phil 0255 zero okay ready that's tunas ukelele five is way too much let's have the threshold be one there's my ukulele tuner you can see that is not the right note so so many things need to be thought first of all if that does not sound right this is gonna be a much better way of tuning it better than I thought all right now really quickly what I want to do is actually allow myself in this one sketch to tune all four of the strings and I really should be stop this video right now and not go any further but I would like to do this there's so much that needs to be and you will do that you will also make a version of this with an interface that looks like an actual thoughtful tuner is this playing the whole song or no it's just like us these so let's let's make an array of the notes so I'm gonna make an array so I'm gonna say notes equals and I'm going to create a bunch of objects for objects and each object is going to have the note and the frequency and the note for example is a and the frequency is 440 so I don't know why I did all that work when I just want to do this so there are four strings on the ukulele there's a e C and G so let's look up those frequencies the e is e it should be a efore which is this 329 623 C is I think it is going to be is it middle C I'm pretty sure it is 261 six two five six and then the G is actually G 4 I believe I don't know if they're 100% right about this so now the thing that I want to do is I want to find out what am i tuning against so first of all this is this is horrific I cannot bear this code that I have written so let's at least make this a little bit better let's make a variable called threshold and again I should do like a mapping or whatever let's make that threshold one and I will at least put that there so we know and again it's ridiculous that I have these if statement in two places but that'll be fine but the first thing that I need to do is actually figure out which note am I trying to compare it to and I want to automatically do that so I don't know actually which string I'm playing less I did some kind of like crazy computer vision thing but I'm just going to like find the note that it's closest to and tune against that so what I want to do here is I'm going to loop through all of the notes and I'm going to find the closest note is an index like zero and so and then I'm just gonna say negative one right now and then the record the record difference is I'm going to start with infinity and then I'm gonna say the it I'm gonna say the difference is notes index i dot frequency the actual frequency minus that if and I'm sure I could use reduce or some kind of fancy higher order array function but let me just do it this way if the difference is less than the record difference then the closest note is I and then once I've done that I have the closest note so now and let me just keep that difference oh I have it in record disc difference so difference equals record difference and it's not less than its absolute value sorry gotta have that absolute value in there always gotta have that absolute value in there and then the the actual note itself can I use this variable name is the notes index closest note I mean I could have just I don't have to save the index I could have saved the object but yeah let me save the object notes index I know it's index I don't need to save the index and that's closest note and then what I'm doing is I'm showing the value and then I want to draw instead of where I'm drawing this value right here I actually want to just put the note on the screen as well which would be where do I do that where do I actually draw that difference oh the text is up here so I'm going to make this much smaller and then I'm also going to write here say I'm going to say text size 64 I'm going to say closest note note and this I'm gonna place like 150 pixels up and this 50 pixels up let's see what that does great so now I should be able to tune all of the strings so it should detect here so why is it not giving me any information we're gonna have to debug this first of all okay let me look at this so let me console.log oh let me just make this no console.log oh you know what I didn't do I'm missing like a super obvious thing I forgot to set the record difference equal to that difference well duh okay here we go so my a is pretty okay what I'm at a console log record difference and closest note for worst let's put the absolute value here and then I won't make this mistake if the difference right I need this this has to be the absolute value as well that's a roughly a problem all right here we go everybody I think this is good now I really need some finer grain this is really I need the negative difference oh I need it here okay everybody everything's gonna be fine so when I'm getting the record I want the smallest one but then when I use it down here you know if it's negative or not is kind of important right no I'm using the absolute value everywhere oh except for drawing where it is all right how about this how about that huh huh how about that if the absolute value of the difference is less than the absolute value the record difference then the record ref is different but I see the negative for use down here I would like to be able to see more movement so where is this divided by ten give me a break divide yourself by two people whoops wrong string it's not really into what did I do wrong by G is wrong this is the wrong G I'm trying there any last things I could do to improve this I could do slurp using lerp never hurts no sound fro there's no sound from the soundboard oh you weren't hearing that Oh cuz I turn it all the way down well alright is this good can I be done save sketch okay this has been my first coding challenge in the new coding terrain studio over here at New York University in Brooklyn I made a ukulele tuner it has the worstever interface for ukulele tuner but I do think there are some nuggets in here it's nice to see how that pitch detection model works I would love it if you made your own version of this you could go to the coding train com find the page for this coding challenge look at the instructions to submit your own actually a video tutorial for how to do that if you make your own ukulele tuner and you put it on the web I will tune this ukulele with it in my next live stream so thank you very much for watching and I will see you in a future coding challenge goodbye I don't like the tiny needle moment movement personally I don't like it at all either it's awful we'll see if matsya can work some kind of magic to edit this let me check my phone I've been doing this for three hours apparently hold on this is texting my family was wondering what I am I said I'll be done by 700 so thanks everybody somebody help me remember this list there's 371 of you watching which is 300 less than started oh that's weird that's very weird this camera did this camera go to sleep or did a cable go loose weird ah I wonder if that camera went to sleep this camera yeah it's way I'm looking at the confidence monitor which is not looking at the camera this is me looking at the ever thank you for watching I'm really I'm the wrong height I stand back here thank you so much for watching this live stream um I didn't get to show any other community contributions I really think I have to end now though I'll be back next Friday at a minimum I'll be back next Friday I have this whole list of things if anyone wants to help work on the wheel let's start a new repo in I mean I have that like wheel spinning thing but I want to start over and I want to make a wheels should do the wheel spin right now right what what am I gonna do next week I should do the wheel spin right I mean I actually do what I said I was gonna do right if I'm gonna do one of these next week uhhuh if I'm gonna do one of these next week I should do one of these next week should do what I say I'm gonna do I scaled it if is this a quick fix instead of what would be the next previous string oh okay yeah all right is that a like thing that I could my brain is totally dead so marching squares are TP more I'm not gonna put more rows on there because I'm well actually I'll put it on there if it lands on it then good planning it ASCII art de Launay I don't think I spelled that right Tetris oh my god please no breakout Collatz conjecture heck oh please hexagonal grid I would love to do that next week that's not such a good idea pacman no whirly noise No oh my god okay okay everyone I am going to spin this wheel and whatever it comes up on is what I have to to in my livestream next week just I'm gonna take one Mulligan I so first of all I think I should I'm not gonna do it right now but I think I should get like a veto so like one time between now and the end of 2019 if it lands on something and I want to veto it I could spin again we could come up with some other goofy rules let's just spin it next week on the county train whatever this is I'll see you next week where I will be doing the Collatz conjecture I will read up on what that is I will look at the issue thank you to whoever submitted that I'm sorry David thank you so much for preparing that list I'm I would love it if people let me just at least let me show one community contribution because it spent so much time working on that and I've already like lost it contributions random org this should allow me to pick a random number right numbers integer generator I want to get a number between 2 and 78 inclusive one random number between 2 and 78 both inclusive and get the number here we go I know you can't see this 41 okay so today before I go I'm gonna look at one oh and cybers has telling me to watch the number file awesome okay I'll watch that one community contribution hung the spreadsheet number 41 let's see whose it is it is by it was sentiment analysis by Lee ima papa it's a link on code pen with 41 Y Lee I am a Papa submitted a bunch of things we're gonna look at this one and we were gonna check it out oh look at this which some kind of like sentiment analysis should I press this button what does it do is that the is this the analysis I'm getting Vito please typing happy happy happy joy joy oh when I got it three okay so it's this is sentient analysis with the bagofwords technique where it's looking at words that it knows are associated with a positive or negative sentiment probably adding up the score together and I love that we see the score here I love this little animation of like now calculate it and then that the result is given with an emoji which is really awesome excellent work thank you for this community contribution I hope they'll look at more of these in future live streams and I will now take you out with my goodbye song and I'll be back I'm gonna do more next week than just that that's just the coding challenge hopefully next week I'm going to come and maybe do something else from one of these other topics or and I probably should have put the leftover stuff the tictactoe minimax should have definitely been on that list so we got to build ourselves a better wheel one that adds like a wheel waiting room perhaps even if like topics and like this sort of core topics I don't know I don't know how to do it yet we'll figure it out well it's good to be back I have to say enjoyed this I'm exhausted they need to be the weekend which thankfully it is and I'll see you all next Friday I'm stay tuned like if you subscribe and click the bell and all that nonsense you'll get a notification when I schedule a live stream but we'll see wheel that you can load a CSV too so that would work it doesn't have to be a JSON file CSV would be fine which so we could have like a Google sheet even that's just like keeping track of all this stuff how people enjoyed this today I don't know I mean it's good that I did this again we'll see if this could be edited into a coding challenge video that interface was horrifically bad for me I would like the chance to like not do live streaming to try to like suppressing my ideas out somebody won't make something all beautiful you always do internet always do follow mango and goose on Instagram those are my cat's I don't do the Instagram the cat's do the Instagram Ryan says great stream thanks that's nice of you um I actually don't have a way of I don't I don't have not set up local storage that is a great suggestion I'm gonna go over here and add that to the JavaScript topics local storage I don't think this was the marker I was using because it's not the good one but that's something that definitely should go on the list of things I want to accomplish this fall all right so I'm going to go over here where I have a YouTube streaming control room where I can shut down the stream but first can you go back to open broadcast studio and I'm gonna click stop streaming bye everybody I will see you next week or sooner or later or who knows I really have no idea goodbye
