00:00 - Welcome back to the second video
of chapter 4 particle systems.
00:03 - Here, I'm going to
take the example
00:05 - that I created in the
previous video and package
00:09 - everything that has to do
with that shower of particles
00:11 - into a class itself.
00:13 - So not only will there
be particle objects,
00:16 - but there will be
system objects,
00:18 - or maybe I'll call
them emitters.
00:19 - So we could also think of this
as like a particle emitter.
00:21 - It just is a shower of particles
from one particular x-y
00:26 - position in the canvas.
00:27 - The first step, I'm going to
create a class called emitter,
00:31 - put it in a separate
JavaScript file.
00:36 - And the only properties
that the emitter has
00:39 - is the x-y location from
which it will emit particles.
00:42 - That should probably
be a vector.
00:47 - I need to make sure
I add that JavaScript
00:49 - file to my HTML file.
00:52 - So position is clearly not the
only property for the emitter.
00:55 - What needs to be in there?
00:57 - Think about this for a second.
00:59 - Pause the video.
01:00 - [CLOCK TICKING]
01:02 - [DING]
01:03 - All right, maybe
you were thinking
01:04 - what I'm thinking, which
is the particles array.
01:08 - The emitter the
object that keeps
01:10 - track of all of the particles.
01:12 - A particle object is
a single particle.
01:14 - An emitter or a system class
keeps track of all of them.
01:17 - The reason why I'm
saying system also
01:19 - is if you look at the
Nature of Code book,
01:21 - I think I used the word
system to describe what I'm
01:23 - describing here as an emitter.
01:25 - So instead of this global
variable particles,
01:29 - I have an array inside of
the emitter class itself.
01:32 - Then maybe in the emitter, I'll
also have a separate update
01:34 - and show function.
01:36 - Could be one function, but let's
make these into two functions
01:39 - where I take this
for loop and go
01:42 - through all of the
particles, but I
01:46 - guess I'm saying I want to
show the particles separately,
01:53 - so I take show out of update
and have only show in the show
01:58 - function.
01:59 - I don't know.
02:00 - Two functions, one
function, I let you decide.
02:02 - There's no right
answer to this, how
02:03 - you want to organize the code.
02:04 - I think there's also a question
of whether this gravity
02:07 - variable should be just
here inside of the update
02:10 - function or a global
variable or passed in.
02:13 - Maybe I'd want an apply
force for the emitter itself
02:16 - to apply forces to
the emitter, but there
02:18 - are lots of ways you
could organize this code.
02:20 - I'm going to leave it
like this for right now.
02:23 - Oh, and of course,
I've forgotten
02:24 - that I need to say this dot
everywhere now that this
02:27 - is a particles property
of the emitter class.
02:31 - [MUSIC - DANIEL SHIFFMAN, "THIS
 DOT SONG"] This dot, this dot,
02:34 - this dot, this dot song.
02:35 - Going back to the
sketch, I can now
02:38 - say I can have a
variable called emitter.
02:42 - And then, oh, I have to figure
out how to add particles.
02:45 - Let me comment that
out for right now.
02:47 - But I can just say emitter
dot show, emitter dot update.
02:52 - All of the stuff that
used to be here in draw
02:55 - is now in the
emitter class itself.
02:58 - Undefi-- oh, I made a
classic error, which is I
03:02 - redeclared the
emitter with let here
03:05 - in setup, which makes it
a local variable to setup,
03:07 - so the global variable
emitter is undefined.
03:10 - That is a very common mistake.
03:12 - Let me take that out.
03:13 - And still, have an error.
03:16 - Oh, and I made another mistake.
03:18 - I spelled it wrong.
03:20 - OK, no errors, but I
don't see any particles.
03:22 - This is because I need to
figure out how to add particles
03:26 - to the emitter.
03:27 - Again, there's so
many different ways
03:29 - I could choose to
implement this.
03:30 - I think what I'll do right
now is take this for loop,
03:35 - go into the emitter class,
add a function called emit,
03:40 - add particle, let's call it add
particle, let's call it emit.
03:46 - Oh, I could do
something fun here
03:47 - where the number of
particles I want to emit
03:50 - is an argument to that function.
03:54 - And then, the new
particle shouldn't
03:55 - be hardcoded at this initial
position 200 comma 20,
03:59 - it should be launched at
the position of the emitter.
04:05 - Now that I have
that emit function,
04:07 - go back to the sketch,
emitter, emit five particles,
04:12 - and I think this should
be, when I hit run,
04:14 - this should be
exactly what I had
04:16 - at the end of the
previous video,
04:18 - just with all of the
particle system stuff
04:20 - wrapped into an emitter object.
04:24 - Particles is not defined.
04:25 - I have a feeling I forgot
the "this dot" again.
04:28 - Absolutely.
04:32 - And there we go.
04:33 - Now I'm ready to, instead
of just having one emitter,
04:38 - have many emitters.
04:40 - So a particle
system, an emitter,
04:44 - is a system of particles.
04:46 - And now I have a
system of emitters,
04:48 - and that could be a particle.
04:49 - This could go on
forever, nested systems.
04:51 - But I'm just going to
do it one level more,
04:54 - an array of emitters.
04:58 - First emitter, emitters index
0 to be that emitter, and then
05:02 - loop through them all.
05:05 - Same sketch, but now that
single emitter is in the array.
05:09 - Now watch this.
05:11 - I'm going to add the mouse
press function, which
05:14 - is very exciting.
05:17 - Instead of emitters
index 0, I'll
05:19 - say emitters dot push, so add
a new object to the array.
05:24 - What do I want to add?
05:25 - A new emitter.
05:29 - And guess where
I want to add it?
05:31 - Not at the hardcoded
values 200 comma 20,
05:34 - but how about I add
at mouse x, mouse y.
05:37 - No particle systems, no
emitters, click the mouse,
05:40 - there's one.
05:41 - Click the mouse,
there's another.
05:42 - Click one, there's mouse.
05:44 - Click the mouse,
there's another.
05:45 - Look at this, particle
emitters right here in P5.JS.
05:49 - Just one additional step from
a single array of particles
05:53 - to make it a class
to wrap that array,
05:55 - and we've got multiple
ones that launch
05:57 - every time I click the mouse.
05:58 - Let's think about some
things you could try.
06:00 - Here's a great exercise,
not the easiest one,
06:02 - but I think it
would be fun to try.
06:04 - Go back to the gravitational
attraction example
06:07 - from Chapter 3, the one where
I use triangles and pointed
06:11 - all of the mover
objects in the direction
06:14 - that they were moving.
06:15 - Those could be
still mover objects,
06:17 - but inside each
one of them, they
06:18 - could have an emitter
object, and they
06:20 - emit particles streaming
out from behind them
06:23 - as they move
throughout the canvas.
06:24 - A simpler exercise might just
be to have a particle emitter
06:27 - that's following the mouse.
06:28 - You could give that a try,
as well as just play around
06:31 - with how could I have these
be different colors, each one
06:35 - being a different color.
06:36 - How could I launch them in an
automatic way like fireworks?
06:39 - So many possibilities.
06:41 - What's coming next?
06:42 - So at least right
now, at the moment
06:43 - that I'm recording this video,
who knows what the future will
06:46 - bring, the next video in
the Nature of Code playlist
06:48 - will be one that I
recorded a couple of years
06:50 - ago about the concept
of inheritance.
06:52 - What if I wanted to have
different kinds of particles?
06:56 - Maybe they all
have the same core
06:59 - idea of position, velocity,
acceleration, and lifespan,
07:03 - but they look different,
they behave differently.
07:05 - I don't want to continually
make new classes with all
07:08 - the same properties, copying and
pasting my code over and over
07:11 - again.
07:11 - Inheritance is a mechanism by
which an object in JavaScript
07:16 - can inherit its properties
from another object.
07:20 - Or, in this case, to be
more specific about it,
07:22 - I can write a class that
extends another class.
07:26 - So I go through all of
that in a lot of detail
07:28 - in the next video, along with
this concept of polymorphism,
07:30 - which really deals
with how then, I
07:32 - have these objects of
different types in one array.
07:35 - So take a look at those
videos if you so choose.
07:39 - And that will allow
you to do more
07:42 - with this idea of different
kinds of particles within one
07:45 - particle system itself.
07:47 - I look forward to
seeing what you
07:48 - make from this
system of systems,
07:50 - whether the concepts of
inheritance and polymorphism
07:52 - add to your creativity in some
interesting and exciting way.
07:57 - And I will come back
and do a couple more
07:59 - extra little tidbits
about particle systems
08:02 - after those two videos
in the playlist.
08:04 - See you there.

[CLOCK TICKING] [DING] All right, maybe you were thinking what I'm thinking, which is the particles array. The emitter the object that keeps track of all of the particles.
