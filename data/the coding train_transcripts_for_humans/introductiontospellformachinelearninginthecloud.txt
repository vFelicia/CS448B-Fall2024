00:00 - (bell rings)
00:01 - - Hello, welcome to a new video series.
00:04 - I'm very excited about this video series
00:06 - 'cause I'm going to show
you how to write some code.
00:08 - I always show you how to
write code, well, not always,
00:09 - but typically I show
you how to write code,
00:11 - and then I run the code
on this computer here.
00:13 - And what I'm going to show
you is how to write code here
00:15 - and have it run somewhere else.
00:17 - And this can be very useful
for a lot of reasons.
00:19 - One of the main reasons these
days you might want to do that
00:23 - is to run your code on
a more powerful computer
00:26 - that can do some kind
of machine learning task
00:28 - that might take all night,
00:30 - and you can just be playing your
00:32 - whatever other video game
00:33 - and checking your email
00:35 - while that's going
00:35 - and get the results when it's done.
00:37 - And I'm going to show you how to do this
00:38 - with a particular platform called Spell.
00:40 - And this video is sponsored by Spell.
00:44 - So I'm going to do a couple things.
00:45 - I'm going to talk about what is Spell.
00:47 - I'm going to show you how to use it
00:48 - and I'm going to run a simple example
00:50 - with just one little Python script
00:52 - that I make on this computer,
00:54 - run it over there and see the results.
00:56 - Then look in this video's description,
00:59 - there will be links to two upcoming
01:01 - live streams with two guests.
01:03 - First, Nabil Hassein is going to come
01:06 - and show you how to train an LSTM,
01:09 - Long Short-Term Memory network.
01:11 - It's a special kind of
neural network model
01:13 - that's useful for working with sequences,
01:16 - and in particular you could generate text
01:18 - as a sequence of characters with it.
01:19 - So we're going to look at
01:20 - how to train an LSTM
model using spell.run,
01:23 - and then have that model
that you've trained
01:25 - work with, say, the ML5
TensorFlow.js library,
01:30 - an ML5 or a TensorFlow.js library.
01:33 - Then Yining Shi,
01:34 - who has previously appeared
01:35 - on The Coding Train
01:36 - in the Brick Breaker Tutorial,
01:37 - she's going to come and show you
01:39 - some stuff about working with images,
01:40 - maybe we'll do style transfer,
01:41 - maybe we'll do Pix 2 Pix, maybe both.
01:44 - And so she'll come and show
you how to train a model
01:46 - for those concepts and
execute that on Spell,
01:51 - and then also work with that
with the ML5.js library.
01:55 - So you could check the video's description
01:57 - for the times of both those live streams.
01:59 - You can tune in live
and ask your questions,
02:01 - or simply watch if the live
streams have already happened
02:04 - and you're watching this
video, just click the link,
02:06 - and you'll be able to
watch it right there.
02:07 - Okay wonderful.
02:08 - Alright so first,
02:09 - let's talk about what is Spell.
02:13 - So I've talked about the idea of
02:15 - client side programming
02:16 - and server side programming,
02:18 - and this is sort of a similar thing
02:20 - in the sense that we do
have a client computer,
02:24 - my laptop which is like The Coding Train,
02:27 - then there is this service
which is called Spell,
02:32 - if I could spell Spell,
that would be good,
02:35 - which has lots and lots of computers
02:38 - sitting there somewhere in the cloud.
02:41 - They have computers with
different CPUs, GPUs,
02:44 - and I'll kind of get to that
02:45 - as we go through all this material.
02:47 - So typically if I'm talking
about client server,
02:50 - I might be saying you
program your website,
02:52 - then you upload your
website to some server
02:54 - and then other people
can access your website.
02:56 - This is different.
02:57 - What we're talking about is
02:59 - allowing these computers to act as
03:02 - a cloud computing resource essentially
03:05 - that you can write a script,
03:07 - so maybe you have this Python script,
03:09 - you set up your entire Python
environment on your computer,
03:12 - the Python script works with
it and you can just say,
03:16 - with typing in just the instruction,
03:18 - spell run my script.py.
03:23 - This will get sent to a particular server,
03:26 - one that you've requested,
03:28 - the kind of server you've requested,
03:29 - you're not requesting a specific computer,
03:30 - you're requesting the kind
of computer, I want this GPU.
03:34 - GPU by the way means
Graphics Processing Unit,
03:37 - and that typically is a powerful processor
03:39 - that's really useful with
machine learning models.
03:43 - So you're going to request a
particular kind of computer.
03:45 - It's going to run it, it might finish,
03:47 - it might generate some files,
03:48 - like maybe it's going to say,
03:49 - hey here's your poem,
03:51 - or here's your image.
03:54 - And then you could request
03:55 - to ask for the results back.
03:57 - And if that task takes hours or even days
04:01 - which is not crazy at all in the world
04:03 - of running machine learning models,
04:05 - you can send it, close your computer,
04:08 - check, go to the library,
04:10 - get on the computer there,
04:11 - go to the Spell website,
04:12 - see what the progress is,
04:13 - go to sleep, wake up, check the progress,
04:15 - did I get a notification?
04:16 - All sorts of things are
possible when it's done.
04:18 - So this is exactly what
I want to show you.
04:21 - And in case you're following along,
04:22 - this is my kind of mental
list of all the pieces,
04:24 - a little outline of what I'm showing.
04:26 - So really all I've done so far
04:27 - is talk about what is Spell.
04:29 - The next thing I want
to do is install Spell.
04:31 - Okay so the first thing that I want to do
04:33 - is just go right to the spell.run website.
04:36 - I'll link to it in this
video's description,
04:37 - but it's pretty easy to type
it in right to your browser.
04:41 - The next thing you're going
to want to do is click Sign Up
04:43 - and sign up for an account
with your email address,
04:45 - name and email.
04:46 - I already have done that so
I'm just going to log in.
04:50 - You pause this video and
sign up for an account
04:52 - if you want to follow along.
04:54 - And then I'm now logged in,
04:55 - and you'll notice I'm
getting this message,
04:58 - Spell is offering a $100 GPU credit,
05:01 - meaning you can use their
GPU machines for free
05:04 - up to what would normally cost $100.
05:07 - You'll have to enter a credit card
05:09 - on the billing page
05:10 - to unlock that feature,
05:11 - and afterwards there's a charge per hour
05:13 - using the resources.
05:15 - I will note that they have
05:16 - a good notification system set up
05:18 - so you can set it up to warn you
05:19 - whenever you're down to this much,
05:20 - so you should never see
05:21 - any unexpected charges on your card.
05:24 - Okay so once you're signed up,
05:27 - the first thing you
want to do is type this,
05:30 - pip install spell.
05:32 - That is now where do you type that?
05:35 - So one thing I should mention
05:36 - is there are couple prerequisites
05:38 - for this following along this tutorial.
05:41 - One is you're going to need
to have a Python environment.
05:44 - Most computers kind of
come with Python installed
05:46 - or you can install it,
05:47 - and I'll link to a few resources
05:49 - for installing Python.
05:50 - I'm using a particular tool
05:51 - in this video called virtualenv,
05:54 - virtual environment,
05:55 - that lets me create a Python environment
05:57 - that I can kind of like
turn on and turn off.
05:59 - Useful.
06:00 - You're also going to need
to know something about Git,
06:03 - how Git works in order to work with Spell.
06:06 - And I will also link,
06:07 - I mean I have a video tutorial series
06:08 - about Git and GitHub as well
06:10 - which I will link to you,
06:11 - but those are prerequisites.
06:12 - Once you have a Python environment set up,
06:15 - you should be able to go
to any terminal, console,
06:19 - application that you're
using and type in pip,
06:22 - Python package something
rather install spell.
06:25 - So I'm going to go to, I'm using iTerm,
06:27 - and you can see that I'm on the Desktop,
06:29 - and this spell-demo, this is a message
06:32 - that's showing to me that's
part of virtual environment,
06:34 - so I have my spell.demo
virtual environment set up,
06:37 - and so I can just write pip install spell,
06:40 - and then I can wait, dot dot,
dot dot, oh, that was so fast,
06:44 - and it is installed.
06:45 - And I know it's installed
because now if I type spell,
06:49 - we can see that it's,
something is happening.
06:51 - Normally if I would just
type spell into the console,
06:53 - into the terminal, it would
say I don't know what that is.
06:56 - Okay the next thing I want
to do is actually log in.
07:01 - So what I've done, actually
let me say something,
07:03 - what I've done is I've installed,
07:05 - I just have to come over
here just to write this down,
07:07 - a command line interface.
07:10 - So how do you control Spell?
07:13 - There are two ways to control Spell.
07:15 - One is through their web browser interface
07:17 - which I will show you at some point.
07:19 - Another is through a
command line interface,
07:21 - meaning you can type in commands
07:23 - on the command line on your computer
07:25 - to interface with Spell and control it.
07:29 - And every command is
going to start with spell.
07:31 - And now I'm going to say spell login.
07:34 - And I'm going to put in my username,
07:36 - and I'm going to put in
my password, sillyunicorn.
07:42 - And there it is, it says, Hello, danshiff!
07:43 - So I know that I am logged in now.
07:46 - And I can also do things
like, say, spell whoami,
07:49 - just to check like who did I log in as?
07:51 - And you can see, okay,
there's my username,
07:53 - you can all email me now at
daniel@thecodingtrain.com,
07:55 - and you can see when my account
was created, June 1st 2001,
07:59 - and my last log in was 10 seconds ago
08:02 - 'cause I log in a lot apparently.
08:04 - Alright so we have Spell working.
08:05 - This is actually pretty easy.
08:07 - Now I can do stuff.
08:09 - So I could type spell,
08:10 - anything that I can run
on the command line,
08:13 - for example I could type echo Choo! Choo!
08:18 - Echo is a command
08:21 - for the computer to echo back to me
08:23 - whatever I type after echo.
08:24 - So now if I want this
command echo Choo! Choo!
08:28 - to not run on my computer
but to run on Spell,
08:32 - all I have to do is say
spell run echo Choo! Choo!
08:37 - And here we go.
08:40 - Now it's going to take longer.
08:41 - Oh whoa, oh so first of all, ah,
08:44 - this is very important,
08:45 - I'm very glad that this happened,
08:46 - because I meant to mention this.
08:48 - Spell, as I was saying,
08:50 - you need to know something about Git
08:51 - which is version control software.
08:53 - Spell is designed to work
best when you run commands
08:58 - from within a directory
that is a Git repository.
09:01 - At the moment I don't
need to worry about that.
09:03 - I'm just trying to say Choo! Choo!
09:06 - So I'm just going to say continue anyway.
09:08 - And then of course in a moment,
09:09 - I'm going to run the commands
from a Git repository.
09:12 - So you could see it's
casting spell number nine.
09:14 - This is the ninth time
09:15 - I've ever tried to run something on Spell.
09:17 - A machine request is done, it's building,
09:19 - it ran, it's that Choo! Choo!
09:22 - It's saving, pushing,
09:23 - total run time five seconds, complete.
09:26 - So here's the thing.
09:27 - This took almost six seconds to run,
09:30 - whereas if I just did this,
09:31 - it happens in milliseconds.
09:33 - There is overhead in
communicating with the server,
09:35 - requesting a machine, sending the command,
09:39 - running the command,
getting the message back,
09:41 - but all that overhead is totally worth it
09:43 - when you have to run something
09:44 - that you need a powerful GPU
09:46 - that doesn't exist on your laptop
09:48 - or that just is going to take,
09:49 - it doesn't matter if
you're adding five seconds
09:51 - if it's going to take five hours.
09:52 - So next step, let's actually
have it run some code.
09:57 - So I have already,
09:58 - I'm in a directory called
Coding-Train-Spell-Demo.
10:02 - And this is code band.py.
10:06 - It's a Python script.
10:07 - I actually wrote a Python script sort of.
10:10 - This is borrowed from a
tutorial from Allison Parrish,
10:12 - and I will link to that in
the video's description.
10:16 - But this, what this does
is it loads a JSON file,
10:20 - this is important because
I want to show you
10:21 - something about loading data,
10:24 - it loads a JSON file with some data in it,
10:26 - it picks some random stuff out,
10:28 - and then it spits that stuff
back out to a text file.
10:32 - So for example, if I just
were to say python band.p,
10:37 - this is me running the
Python script on this laptop,
10:41 - what it does is it picks a
set of random instruments
10:44 - and shows them to you.
10:45 - We run them through again,
10:46 - it picks 10 random
instruments and there you go.
10:48 - It's my random band, the randoms.
10:51 - And it's also in a file
called theband.txt.
10:55 - It wrote it out to a file.
10:57 - Well, I'm not suggesting
10:58 - that this particular code
11:00 - is anything interesting.
11:03 - This shows you the
machine learning process
11:06 - if you're going to use
this for machine learning.
11:07 - You don't have, you can
run any code on Spell,
11:09 - and there might be other things,
11:10 - but the thing that I'm
going to show you with,
11:12 - that we're going to show you
11:13 - in future live streams with guests,
11:14 - LSTM, style transfer,
11:16 - the idea is that
11:17 - you're going to load in some data,
11:19 - crunch the numbers for a very long time,
11:22 - and then spit out a result,
11:23 - and that's exactly what this is doing,
11:25 - loading a JSON file,
11:27 - running over sort of an algorithm,
11:28 - and writing out a text file.
11:29 - So maybe that output is going to be
11:30 - a model file or an
image or something else,
11:32 - but all the same stuff will apply.
11:35 - It's time to run span.py
now on Spell, not locally.
11:40 - So I'm going to ask the Spell
server to run that Python script.
11:43 - So all I have to do is type spell run,
11:46 - and then the same as that command
11:48 - that I would have typed anyway,
11:50 - python band.py.
11:53 - Now here's the thing,
11:54 - this is going to work very fluidly
11:56 - because I am in a directory
11:58 - that happens to be a Git repository.
12:00 - Spell knows how to transfer
files back and forth using Git,
12:05 - how to look at your last commit method
12:07 - and have that be as
something that's noted,
12:09 - at what time did you run this.
12:10 - So all of that,
12:11 - if you have your script
12:13 - inside of a Git repository,
12:14 - things are going to work really nicely.
12:17 - And you could see that I have my terminal
12:19 - configured in such a way
to show me information
12:22 - about what branch I'm on
and into my Git repository.
12:24 - And I have a separate video
12:25 - that kind of shows how I'm doing that
12:27 - which I'll link to in
the video's description.
12:29 - Okay I'm going to press
Enter and run this.
12:32 - Okay so here we are.
12:34 - It's casting spell number 11.
12:37 - It was spell number nine before
12:39 - because I did something
12:40 - that I made a mistake with number 10.
12:42 - It got edited out.
12:44 - Okay, so you could see it's building it,
12:45 - it's running it, it's done,
12:47 - it's printed out the output,
12:49 - saving, done, and run
number 11 is complete.
12:53 - Now that it's finished,
12:54 - I want to be able to look at the results.
12:55 - I want to see the results
of whatever algorithm I ran.
12:59 - I can see it here 'cause I had
it kind of console logged it,
13:02 - but I want that file, that
file is not on my computer.
13:04 - Remember I ran the code
on Spell's computers,
13:07 - so I need to get that file.
13:08 - And there's two different
ways you can do it.
13:10 - So one way you can do it
13:11 - is actually just by going to the browser.
13:13 - So here I am logged in to Spell.
13:15 - I'm going to go here and click Runs.
13:17 - There's also this idea of Workspaces,
13:19 - but Runs is where I can see
13:21 - all the different things
13:22 - that I have done recently,
13:23 - and I want to find one number 11.
13:25 - So I'm going to click on Runs,
13:27 - and I'm going to click
on run number 11 here.
13:30 - And here we could see, look,
this is actually what ran,
13:32 - spell run, now I didn't type this in,
13:34 - I didn't request a CPU machine,
13:38 - the default is the basic CPU machine,
13:40 - meaning no special fancy
graphics processing units.
13:44 - And this is actually free.
13:46 - So the basic computer,
13:47 - it's not going to do anything much better
13:49 - than I could do already on
my laptop but that is free.
13:52 - And then you can see python band.py.
13:56 - There's information that's sort of
13:57 - log of what happened is here.
13:59 - And then right here, look at this,
14:01 - theband.txt, that was the output,
14:04 - and I can just click Download,
14:08 - and there it is.
14:10 - I've already done this in practice.
14:12 - And you can see there it is,
14:13 - that's the results.
14:14 - So in a way (bell rings) we're done.
14:16 - Like I'm going to show you more things,
14:18 - but this is the basic idea of Spell.
14:22 - I wrote some code,
14:24 - I have an environment
configured on my computer,
14:27 - I don't want to have to do,
14:28 - I want to run it somewhere else
14:29 - but I don't want to have to do
14:30 - a lot of work setting
up another environment,
14:31 - Spell is going to be able to
duplicate your environment
14:34 - and run your code very easily by using Git
14:37 - and other things that it
knows how to integrate with.
14:40 - So this is really wonderful
14:41 - that I have this like web interface
14:43 - and I can see what happened,
14:44 - I can click through my runs,
14:45 - I can see band.txt,
14:47 - I can just download it really easily.
14:49 - But most of the time
14:50 - you're going to want to just
14:51 - continue all of your workflow
14:53 - through that command line interface,
14:55 - and in fact you can download the file
14:57 - and do a lot of other things
14:58 - from the command line interface.
14:59 - I'm going to show you
a couple more commands,
15:01 - and then I'm also going to show you
15:02 - where you find all the documentation
for all those commands.
15:05 - I actually don't have
these things memorized,
15:06 - you shouldn't have them either memorized,
15:08 - it's all about looking up
15:09 - and reading through the documentation.
15:11 - Okay so let me go back to the terminal.
15:13 - So one thing I'm just in the Desktop now.
15:15 - I don't have to be in my project folder
15:18 - to interface with Spell.
15:19 - If I'm running the code,
15:20 - I want to be in the project folder,
15:22 - but if I just want a file,
15:23 - I could say something like
15:25 - spell, cp for copy, runs,
15:30 - and then I need to specify which run.
15:31 - Now the number of the run is
the most important thing, /11.
15:35 - It was run number 11 I remember that.
15:37 - And so it's going to say copied one file.
15:40 - I can actually go to the Desktop now,
15:43 - and we should see that there it is,
15:46 - there's this file, the band.txt,
15:48 - and there once again is the band
15:51 - that came out of that particular run.
15:53 - Let's just really quickly do this again
15:55 - to see how everything changes.
15:57 - I'm going to run it one more time.
16:00 - (soft upbeat music)
16:04 - Okay, run number 12 completed.
16:06 - You could see it's a different band,
16:08 - fiddle all the way to oboe.
16:10 - So I could just go back
to Desktop and say hey,
16:13 - give me now the file from run 12,
16:16 - and then I could just go to the Desktop,
16:18 - and we can say, right,
fiddle down to oboe,
16:20 - the new file has come in and replaced it.
16:22 - It's up to me to manage my file system
16:24 - if I want to like rename the other one,
16:26 - keep that one, that sort of thing.
16:27 - But all of this has been saved,
16:29 - I can just go quickly back
16:31 - and grab the file for
number 11 now if I wanted.
16:32 - It's all there on the
Spell server for you.
16:35 - So the next thing I want to
show you which is pretty typical
16:39 - of working with a machine
learning algorithm
16:41 - is that your data might
be a big set of images
16:44 - or a lot of text files,
16:46 - that's not going to be something
16:47 - that's part of your Git repo.
16:49 - Your code and your algorithm is all there,
16:51 - but the actual data is something
16:52 - that you want to treat separately.
16:54 - And this is where you want to use
16:56 - two important commands, right?
16:58 - So before, I just had
my instruments.JSON file
17:01 - right there in the repo so my
Python code could pull it up,
17:04 - but if I want to just have
my code running on Spell,
17:07 - but try with different data files,
17:10 - I'm going to need to upload the file,
17:13 - so I'm going to use spell upload.
17:15 - And then what I want to make sure is that,
17:18 - that's uploading it to Spell,
17:19 - but there's another
concept here of mounting.
17:22 - So if I have a whole set of uploads,
17:24 - I want to mount a particular one,
17:27 - meaning I want it to be available
17:29 - for this particular run.
17:30 - So let's look at how that works.
17:34 - To show you how that works,
17:34 - I've modified the code to have it
17:37 - just pull from any text file.
17:40 - So when I run, when I
now say python band.py,
17:44 - I have to give it a data file.
17:46 - So I can say data.json.
17:47 - And data.json is not part
of my Git repository,
17:50 - it's just a data file.
17:52 - So what I want to do first is actually say
17:54 - spell upload data.json.
17:59 - Enter a name for the upload.
18:01 - Ah, so actually it's important
that I reference a name
18:05 - because I want to like organize my stuff
18:08 - in a way that I can remember later.
18:10 - So now it's going to
tell me let's call it,
18:14 - let's just call it a demo,
18:16 - maybe I want to call it,
18:17 - actually let me call it like json_bands,
18:22 - like band or band,
18:23 - I'll call it bands or instruments.
18:24 - (laughing)
18:25 - Let's call it instruments.
18:28 - Okay so now you can see it's uploading it
18:30 - to uploading instruments.
18:31 - Let's go to the Spell website.
18:34 - And when I look at the website,
18:35 - I can now go to Resources,
18:36 - and we're going to see here,
18:37 - look at this, under uploads, instruments,
18:40 - there's my resource, data.json.
18:43 - So now I need to make sure
18:44 - this resource is available, right?
18:46 - Like is it available just by default?
18:50 - Now I can say spell run
18:52 - python band.py data.json,
18:58 - and it's going to run it.
18:59 - Casting spell number 14,
19:02 - building machine, running, running,
19:04 - ah, it couldn't find the file.
19:06 - See, it threw an error, open file name,
19:09 - it couldn't find this file
that I want, data.json.
19:11 - To add that file, for it to be available
19:14 - as part of the run,
19:16 - it needs to be mounted.
19:17 - And this can be done
actually by just modifying
19:20 - with an argument the spell run command.
19:23 - So in other words I want to say spell run,
19:26 - and all this time I should have been
19:29 - putting the command in quotes
19:30 - 'cause it's going to like
keep it together as a unit.
19:33 - So I can say python band.py data.json,
19:39 - and then -m, and now the path to that,
19:43 - and the path to that is what?
19:45 - uploads, what did I call it?
19:48 - instruments I think,
19:50 - instruments/data.json.
19:53 - So if I had a bunch of
different instruments files,
19:56 - I could run it just by picking the one
19:58 - that I want to mount
for this particular run.
20:00 - So let's give this a try,
20:01 - and this is a very common thing, this -m,
20:03 - there's lots of other dash this,
20:05 - dash that, dash this,
20:07 - so that I can modify,
20:08 - I can request a GPU or
I can ask it do this.
20:11 - So I'll look at that
20:12 - when I show you the documentation.
20:13 - Okay let's give it a try.
20:17 - Oh we're in number 15,
this is so exciting.
20:19 - Machine requested, mounting,
20:21 - run is mounting, run is
running, there we go.
20:24 - So we can see it worked.
20:26 - Now it used that file.
20:27 - Oh that's wonderful.
20:29 - I've kind of finished.
20:30 - I mean there's so much more,
20:31 - and as I said there's going to be
20:33 - two upcoming live streams.
20:35 - We're showing practical
machine learning examples
20:37 - that you could stay tune for or watch
20:39 - if you're watching this
sometime in the future
20:41 - when those have already happened.
20:42 - But I do want to mention
a couple other things.
20:44 - So let's actually let's
run this on a GPU, why not?
20:47 - Let's make use of a powerful GPU.
20:49 - I've got $100 in credit.
20:52 - So let's go here and see,
20:56 - how do you find out all
the things you can do?
20:59 - The main thing you want to go to
21:01 - is here under Documentation.
21:02 - So I'm going to click Documentation.
21:04 - There's a Quickstart guide.
21:05 - Essentially the Quickstart guide
21:07 - is what is in this video.
21:08 - No more as succinct fact fashion.
21:11 - There's some Core Concepts,
21:12 - there's Guides for particular examples
21:14 - like style transfer already,
21:16 - translating text, recognizing numbers.
21:18 - I encourage you to look at those.
21:19 - But what I'm really
concerned with right now
21:22 - is this Command Line
Interface Documentation.
21:25 - That's what I really want to look at.
21:27 - So I'm going to go there and you can see
21:29 - this is all the stuff that
I've been showing you,
21:31 - spell whoami, spell upload, spell stop,
21:35 - spell ps, this is a really useful one.
21:38 - So spell ps display all
user runs and their details.
21:42 - Because one thing by
the way you should know,
21:44 - you might sort of think like,
oh I'm going to just run this,
21:48 - and then like, oh no, I
didn't mean to do that,
21:50 - let me quickly hit Control + Z.
21:52 - Well, guess what I just did?
21:54 - I stopped viewing logs with Control + Z.
21:56 - That didn't actually stopped the process.
21:58 - If I want to stop the process,
22:00 - I've got to actually
use probably spell.stop.
22:03 - And spell.stop, I can
stop a particular RUN_ID
22:07 - if it's like taking forever
and it has a mistake in it.
22:09 - That one probably already
finished 'cause I was talking,
22:12 - but I could say spell -ps.
22:16 - Oh sorry, just spell ps, no dash.
22:19 - And now this is everything
I've ever done basically.
22:23 - You could see back like when
I first was doing this thing,
22:25 - I was running some test spell test.
22:26 - It's always telling me the
machine type, what the thing was.
22:30 - This is a little bit awkward
to look at because of,
22:32 - it'll look really nice on your computer
22:33 - especially when you
have like a smaller font
22:36 - and like it's all nice.
22:37 - It'll look something
nice like this (laughs)
22:40 - but I have like a big
font so you can see it,
22:42 - and I don't know I'm like,
my computer has gone crazy.
22:45 - But this is the kind of thing
that you want to look how to do.
22:48 - So the one thing that you're
going to want to really see is
22:51 - I'm looking for, oh, spell.run,
22:55 - and now the arguments for it.
22:57 - So we could see that -m was for mounting,
23:00 - and then also, ah, this is
really important, --pip,
23:05 - this is if a certain dependency that,
23:08 - my project was just like a simple one
23:09 - so it didn't really need any dependency,
23:12 - but this is important so
that when Spell runs it,
23:14 - it uses the same Python
packages that you're running.
23:17 - And by the way Spell also
supports other environments.
23:20 - I'm using Python 'cause
the future examples
23:22 - and a lot of machine learning
examples run through Python.
23:26 - But you know me, I don't
really know Python,
23:29 - and maybe I'll come back and
show you with JavaScript thing,
23:31 - with node, all these other environment,
23:32 - other environments are
supported on Spell as well,
23:35 - but here's the important
one, --machine-type or -t.
23:39 - And you can see these are
the different machine types.
23:42 - Probably the further you get to the right
23:44 - is kind of the bigger the one.
23:46 - And you're going to want to
look through the Spell website
23:48 - for more documentation
on each one of these.
23:52 - But let's just pick one for fun.
23:55 - Let's try a v100.
23:56 - I feel like that's kind of like
23:57 - a reasonable GPU that's not too crazy.
24:00 - To run it on the GPU,
24:02 - I'm going to do exactly what I did before,
24:04 - spell run python band.py
24:08 - data.json -m,
24:10 - argument for mounting
24:12 - that data.json file,
24:14 - and then also I need another argument, -t.
24:19 - - t is for --machine,
24:22 - it's to select the machine,
24:23 - I'm going to pick v100
24:25 - which is a machine that has a GPU
24:27 - that I'm excited to try.
24:29 - And now I'm going to hit Enter,
24:31 - and we're going to run it on the GPU.
24:32 - Okay, let's go.
24:34 - Okay so here's the thing.
24:37 - I am running this code now
24:39 - on a machine that has a powerful GPU,
24:41 - but I'm not actually making use
24:43 - of any of the code libraries
24:44 - that would actually make use of the GPU,
24:45 - so technically this is really
going to be the same thing.
24:48 - And it already finished.
24:49 - But when we get to the next tutorials
24:51 - that are going to come in the future,
24:53 - looking at LSTMs, and
style transfer, Pix 2 Pix,
24:56 - those will really make use
of a machine with a CPU.
24:59 - Okay it finished, it took
seven seconds, there we go.
25:03 - Alright so that's going to wrap things up.
25:05 - I hope that you enjoyed this tutorial.
25:07 - I hope you learned a little bit about
25:08 - what it means to use a
cloud computing resource
25:11 - to run code that you're writing
25:14 - on this computer or somewhere else,
25:15 - you could do it in Python
25:16 - and in other environments as well
25:18 - that are supported by Spell.
25:21 - Thank you so much to Spell
25:22 - for the opportunity to do these tutorials.
25:25 - I really appreciate it.
25:26 - I've had a lot of fun
25:27 - playing around with the platform
25:28 - and hope to use it again
in future projects.
25:30 - So go over to the website,
spell.run, give it a try.
25:34 - Ask your questions in the Comment.
25:36 - Look in the video's description
25:37 - for two links to the
upcoming live streams,
25:40 - or if those have already happened,
25:41 - those links will be
replaced with the archive
25:43 - of those live streams as well.
25:45 - So I can't wait to see what you make,
25:48 - how it works for you,
25:49 - what kind of things I forgot to talk about
25:50 - that I get to answer in the Comments.
25:52 - And I'll see you again
someday on The Coding Train.
25:55 - (whistling)
25:56 - Choo Choo!
25:57 - (upbeat music)

Cleaned transcript:

(bell rings) Hello, welcome to a new video series. I'm very excited about this video series 'cause I'm going to show you how to write some code. I always show you how to write code, well, not always, but typically I show you how to write code, and then I run the code on this computer here. And what I'm going to show you is how to write code here and have it run somewhere else. And this can be very useful for a lot of reasons. One of the main reasons these days you might want to do that is to run your code on a more powerful computer that can do some kind of machine learning task that might take all night, and you can just be playing your whatever other video game and checking your email while that's going and get the results when it's done. And I'm going to show you how to do this with a particular platform called Spell. And this video is sponsored by Spell. So I'm going to do a couple things. I'm going to talk about what is Spell. I'm going to show you how to use it and I'm going to run a simple example with just one little Python script that I make on this computer, run it over there and see the results. Then look in this video's description, there will be links to two upcoming live streams with two guests. First, Nabil Hassein is going to come and show you how to train an LSTM, Long ShortTerm Memory network. It's a special kind of neural network model that's useful for working with sequences, and in particular you could generate text as a sequence of characters with it. So we're going to look at how to train an LSTM model using spell.run, and then have that model that you've trained work with, say, the ML5 TensorFlow.js library, an ML5 or a TensorFlow.js library. Then Yining Shi, who has previously appeared on The Coding Train in the Brick Breaker Tutorial, she's going to come and show you some stuff about working with images, maybe we'll do style transfer, maybe we'll do Pix 2 Pix, maybe both. And so she'll come and show you how to train a model for those concepts and execute that on Spell, and then also work with that with the ML5.js library. So you could check the video's description for the times of both those live streams. You can tune in live and ask your questions, or simply watch if the live streams have already happened and you're watching this video, just click the link, and you'll be able to watch it right there. Okay wonderful. Alright so first, let's talk about what is Spell. So I've talked about the idea of client side programming and server side programming, and this is sort of a similar thing in the sense that we do have a client computer, my laptop which is like The Coding Train, then there is this service which is called Spell, if I could spell Spell, that would be good, which has lots and lots of computers sitting there somewhere in the cloud. They have computers with different CPUs, GPUs, and I'll kind of get to that as we go through all this material. So typically if I'm talking about client server, I might be saying you program your website, then you upload your website to some server and then other people can access your website. This is different. What we're talking about is allowing these computers to act as a cloud computing resource essentially that you can write a script, so maybe you have this Python script, you set up your entire Python environment on your computer, the Python script works with it and you can just say, with typing in just the instruction, spell run my script.py. This will get sent to a particular server, one that you've requested, the kind of server you've requested, you're not requesting a specific computer, you're requesting the kind of computer, I want this GPU. GPU by the way means Graphics Processing Unit, and that typically is a powerful processor that's really useful with machine learning models. So you're going to request a particular kind of computer. It's going to run it, it might finish, it might generate some files, like maybe it's going to say, hey here's your poem, or here's your image. And then you could request to ask for the results back. And if that task takes hours or even days which is not crazy at all in the world of running machine learning models, you can send it, close your computer, check, go to the library, get on the computer there, go to the Spell website, see what the progress is, go to sleep, wake up, check the progress, did I get a notification? All sorts of things are possible when it's done. So this is exactly what I want to show you. And in case you're following along, this is my kind of mental list of all the pieces, a little outline of what I'm showing. So really all I've done so far is talk about what is Spell. The next thing I want to do is install Spell. Okay so the first thing that I want to do is just go right to the spell.run website. I'll link to it in this video's description, but it's pretty easy to type it in right to your browser. The next thing you're going to want to do is click Sign Up and sign up for an account with your email address, name and email. I already have done that so I'm just going to log in. You pause this video and sign up for an account if you want to follow along. And then I'm now logged in, and you'll notice I'm getting this message, Spell is offering a $100 GPU credit, meaning you can use their GPU machines for free up to what would normally cost $100. You'll have to enter a credit card on the billing page to unlock that feature, and afterwards there's a charge per hour using the resources. I will note that they have a good notification system set up so you can set it up to warn you whenever you're down to this much, so you should never see any unexpected charges on your card. Okay so once you're signed up, the first thing you want to do is type this, pip install spell. That is now where do you type that? So one thing I should mention is there are couple prerequisites for this following along this tutorial. One is you're going to need to have a Python environment. Most computers kind of come with Python installed or you can install it, and I'll link to a few resources for installing Python. I'm using a particular tool in this video called virtualenv, virtual environment, that lets me create a Python environment that I can kind of like turn on and turn off. Useful. You're also going to need to know something about Git, how Git works in order to work with Spell. And I will also link, I mean I have a video tutorial series about Git and GitHub as well which I will link to you, but those are prerequisites. Once you have a Python environment set up, you should be able to go to any terminal, console, application that you're using and type in pip, Python package something rather install spell. So I'm going to go to, I'm using iTerm, and you can see that I'm on the Desktop, and this spelldemo, this is a message that's showing to me that's part of virtual environment, so I have my spell.demo virtual environment set up, and so I can just write pip install spell, and then I can wait, dot dot, dot dot, oh, that was so fast, and it is installed. And I know it's installed because now if I type spell, we can see that it's, something is happening. Normally if I would just type spell into the console, into the terminal, it would say I don't know what that is. Okay the next thing I want to do is actually log in. So what I've done, actually let me say something, what I've done is I've installed, I just have to come over here just to write this down, a command line interface. So how do you control Spell? There are two ways to control Spell. One is through their web browser interface which I will show you at some point. Another is through a command line interface, meaning you can type in commands on the command line on your computer to interface with Spell and control it. And every command is going to start with spell. And now I'm going to say spell login. And I'm going to put in my username, and I'm going to put in my password, sillyunicorn. And there it is, it says, Hello, danshiff! So I know that I am logged in now. And I can also do things like, say, spell whoami, just to check like who did I log in as? And you can see, okay, there's my username, you can all email me now at daniel@thecodingtrain.com, and you can see when my account was created, June 1st 2001, and my last log in was 10 seconds ago 'cause I log in a lot apparently. Alright so we have Spell working. This is actually pretty easy. Now I can do stuff. So I could type spell, anything that I can run on the command line, for example I could type echo Choo! Choo! Echo is a command for the computer to echo back to me whatever I type after echo. So now if I want this command echo Choo! Choo! to not run on my computer but to run on Spell, all I have to do is say spell run echo Choo! Choo! And here we go. Now it's going to take longer. Oh whoa, oh so first of all, ah, this is very important, I'm very glad that this happened, because I meant to mention this. Spell, as I was saying, you need to know something about Git which is version control software. Spell is designed to work best when you run commands from within a directory that is a Git repository. At the moment I don't need to worry about that. I'm just trying to say Choo! Choo! So I'm just going to say continue anyway. And then of course in a moment, I'm going to run the commands from a Git repository. So you could see it's casting spell number nine. This is the ninth time I've ever tried to run something on Spell. A machine request is done, it's building, it ran, it's that Choo! Choo! It's saving, pushing, total run time five seconds, complete. So here's the thing. This took almost six seconds to run, whereas if I just did this, it happens in milliseconds. There is overhead in communicating with the server, requesting a machine, sending the command, running the command, getting the message back, but all that overhead is totally worth it when you have to run something that you need a powerful GPU that doesn't exist on your laptop or that just is going to take, it doesn't matter if you're adding five seconds if it's going to take five hours. So next step, let's actually have it run some code. So I have already, I'm in a directory called CodingTrainSpellDemo. And this is code band.py. It's a Python script. I actually wrote a Python script sort of. This is borrowed from a tutorial from Allison Parrish, and I will link to that in the video's description. But this, what this does is it loads a JSON file, this is important because I want to show you something about loading data, it loads a JSON file with some data in it, it picks some random stuff out, and then it spits that stuff back out to a text file. So for example, if I just were to say python band.p, this is me running the Python script on this laptop, what it does is it picks a set of random instruments and shows them to you. We run them through again, it picks 10 random instruments and there you go. It's my random band, the randoms. And it's also in a file called theband.txt. It wrote it out to a file. Well, I'm not suggesting that this particular code is anything interesting. This shows you the machine learning process if you're going to use this for machine learning. You don't have, you can run any code on Spell, and there might be other things, but the thing that I'm going to show you with, that we're going to show you in future live streams with guests, LSTM, style transfer, the idea is that you're going to load in some data, crunch the numbers for a very long time, and then spit out a result, and that's exactly what this is doing, loading a JSON file, running over sort of an algorithm, and writing out a text file. So maybe that output is going to be a model file or an image or something else, but all the same stuff will apply. It's time to run span.py now on Spell, not locally. So I'm going to ask the Spell server to run that Python script. So all I have to do is type spell run, and then the same as that command that I would have typed anyway, python band.py. Now here's the thing, this is going to work very fluidly because I am in a directory that happens to be a Git repository. Spell knows how to transfer files back and forth using Git, how to look at your last commit method and have that be as something that's noted, at what time did you run this. So all of that, if you have your script inside of a Git repository, things are going to work really nicely. And you could see that I have my terminal configured in such a way to show me information about what branch I'm on and into my Git repository. And I have a separate video that kind of shows how I'm doing that which I'll link to in the video's description. Okay I'm going to press Enter and run this. Okay so here we are. It's casting spell number 11. It was spell number nine before because I did something that I made a mistake with number 10. It got edited out. Okay, so you could see it's building it, it's running it, it's done, it's printed out the output, saving, done, and run number 11 is complete. Now that it's finished, I want to be able to look at the results. I want to see the results of whatever algorithm I ran. I can see it here 'cause I had it kind of console logged it, but I want that file, that file is not on my computer. Remember I ran the code on Spell's computers, so I need to get that file. And there's two different ways you can do it. So one way you can do it is actually just by going to the browser. So here I am logged in to Spell. I'm going to go here and click Runs. There's also this idea of Workspaces, but Runs is where I can see all the different things that I have done recently, and I want to find one number 11. So I'm going to click on Runs, and I'm going to click on run number 11 here. And here we could see, look, this is actually what ran, spell run, now I didn't type this in, I didn't request a CPU machine, the default is the basic CPU machine, meaning no special fancy graphics processing units. And this is actually free. So the basic computer, it's not going to do anything much better than I could do already on my laptop but that is free. And then you can see python band.py. There's information that's sort of log of what happened is here. And then right here, look at this, theband.txt, that was the output, and I can just click Download, and there it is. I've already done this in practice. And you can see there it is, that's the results. So in a way (bell rings) we're done. Like I'm going to show you more things, but this is the basic idea of Spell. I wrote some code, I have an environment configured on my computer, I don't want to have to do, I want to run it somewhere else but I don't want to have to do a lot of work setting up another environment, Spell is going to be able to duplicate your environment and run your code very easily by using Git and other things that it knows how to integrate with. So this is really wonderful that I have this like web interface and I can see what happened, I can click through my runs, I can see band.txt, I can just download it really easily. But most of the time you're going to want to just continue all of your workflow through that command line interface, and in fact you can download the file and do a lot of other things from the command line interface. I'm going to show you a couple more commands, and then I'm also going to show you where you find all the documentation for all those commands. I actually don't have these things memorized, you shouldn't have them either memorized, it's all about looking up and reading through the documentation. Okay so let me go back to the terminal. So one thing I'm just in the Desktop now. I don't have to be in my project folder to interface with Spell. If I'm running the code, I want to be in the project folder, but if I just want a file, I could say something like spell, cp for copy, runs, and then I need to specify which run. Now the number of the run is the most important thing, /11. It was run number 11 I remember that. And so it's going to say copied one file. I can actually go to the Desktop now, and we should see that there it is, there's this file, the band.txt, and there once again is the band that came out of that particular run. Let's just really quickly do this again to see how everything changes. I'm going to run it one more time. (soft upbeat music) Okay, run number 12 completed. You could see it's a different band, fiddle all the way to oboe. So I could just go back to Desktop and say hey, give me now the file from run 12, and then I could just go to the Desktop, and we can say, right, fiddle down to oboe, the new file has come in and replaced it. It's up to me to manage my file system if I want to like rename the other one, keep that one, that sort of thing. But all of this has been saved, I can just go quickly back and grab the file for number 11 now if I wanted. It's all there on the Spell server for you. So the next thing I want to show you which is pretty typical of working with a machine learning algorithm is that your data might be a big set of images or a lot of text files, that's not going to be something that's part of your Git repo. Your code and your algorithm is all there, but the actual data is something that you want to treat separately. And this is where you want to use two important commands, right? So before, I just had my instruments.JSON file right there in the repo so my Python code could pull it up, but if I want to just have my code running on Spell, but try with different data files, I'm going to need to upload the file, so I'm going to use spell upload. And then what I want to make sure is that, that's uploading it to Spell, but there's another concept here of mounting. So if I have a whole set of uploads, I want to mount a particular one, meaning I want it to be available for this particular run. So let's look at how that works. To show you how that works, I've modified the code to have it just pull from any text file. So when I run, when I now say python band.py, I have to give it a data file. So I can say data.json. And data.json is not part of my Git repository, it's just a data file. So what I want to do first is actually say spell upload data.json. Enter a name for the upload. Ah, so actually it's important that I reference a name because I want to like organize my stuff in a way that I can remember later. So now it's going to tell me let's call it, let's just call it a demo, maybe I want to call it, actually let me call it like json_bands, like band or band, I'll call it bands or instruments. (laughing) Let's call it instruments. Okay so now you can see it's uploading it to uploading instruments. Let's go to the Spell website. And when I look at the website, I can now go to Resources, and we're going to see here, look at this, under uploads, instruments, there's my resource, data.json. So now I need to make sure this resource is available, right? Like is it available just by default? Now I can say spell run python band.py data.json, and it's going to run it. Casting spell number 14, building machine, running, running, ah, it couldn't find the file. See, it threw an error, open file name, it couldn't find this file that I want, data.json. To add that file, for it to be available as part of the run, it needs to be mounted. And this can be done actually by just modifying with an argument the spell run command. So in other words I want to say spell run, and all this time I should have been putting the command in quotes 'cause it's going to like keep it together as a unit. So I can say python band.py data.json, and then m, and now the path to that, and the path to that is what? uploads, what did I call it? instruments I think, instruments/data.json. So if I had a bunch of different instruments files, I could run it just by picking the one that I want to mount for this particular run. So let's give this a try, and this is a very common thing, this m, there's lots of other dash this, dash that, dash this, so that I can modify, I can request a GPU or I can ask it do this. So I'll look at that when I show you the documentation. Okay let's give it a try. Oh we're in number 15, this is so exciting. Machine requested, mounting, run is mounting, run is running, there we go. So we can see it worked. Now it used that file. Oh that's wonderful. I've kind of finished. I mean there's so much more, and as I said there's going to be two upcoming live streams. We're showing practical machine learning examples that you could stay tune for or watch if you're watching this sometime in the future when those have already happened. But I do want to mention a couple other things. So let's actually let's run this on a GPU, why not? Let's make use of a powerful GPU. I've got $100 in credit. So let's go here and see, how do you find out all the things you can do? The main thing you want to go to is here under Documentation. So I'm going to click Documentation. There's a Quickstart guide. Essentially the Quickstart guide is what is in this video. No more as succinct fact fashion. There's some Core Concepts, there's Guides for particular examples like style transfer already, translating text, recognizing numbers. I encourage you to look at those. But what I'm really concerned with right now is this Command Line Interface Documentation. That's what I really want to look at. So I'm going to go there and you can see this is all the stuff that I've been showing you, spell whoami, spell upload, spell stop, spell ps, this is a really useful one. So spell ps display all user runs and their details. Because one thing by the way you should know, you might sort of think like, oh I'm going to just run this, and then like, oh no, I didn't mean to do that, let me quickly hit Control + Z. Well, guess what I just did? I stopped viewing logs with Control + Z. That didn't actually stopped the process. If I want to stop the process, I've got to actually use probably spell.stop. And spell.stop, I can stop a particular RUN_ID if it's like taking forever and it has a mistake in it. That one probably already finished 'cause I was talking, but I could say spell ps. Oh sorry, just spell ps, no dash. And now this is everything I've ever done basically. You could see back like when I first was doing this thing, I was running some test spell test. It's always telling me the machine type, what the thing was. This is a little bit awkward to look at because of, it'll look really nice on your computer especially when you have like a smaller font and like it's all nice. It'll look something nice like this (laughs) but I have like a big font so you can see it, and I don't know I'm like, my computer has gone crazy. But this is the kind of thing that you want to look how to do. So the one thing that you're going to want to really see is I'm looking for, oh, spell.run, and now the arguments for it. So we could see that m was for mounting, and then also, ah, this is really important, pip, this is if a certain dependency that, my project was just like a simple one so it didn't really need any dependency, but this is important so that when Spell runs it, it uses the same Python packages that you're running. And by the way Spell also supports other environments. I'm using Python 'cause the future examples and a lot of machine learning examples run through Python. But you know me, I don't really know Python, and maybe I'll come back and show you with JavaScript thing, with node, all these other environment, other environments are supported on Spell as well, but here's the important one, machinetype or t. And you can see these are the different machine types. Probably the further you get to the right is kind of the bigger the one. And you're going to want to look through the Spell website for more documentation on each one of these. But let's just pick one for fun. Let's try a v100. I feel like that's kind of like a reasonable GPU that's not too crazy. To run it on the GPU, I'm going to do exactly what I did before, spell run python band.py data.json m, argument for mounting that data.json file, and then also I need another argument, t. t is for machine, it's to select the machine, I'm going to pick v100 which is a machine that has a GPU that I'm excited to try. And now I'm going to hit Enter, and we're going to run it on the GPU. Okay, let's go. Okay so here's the thing. I am running this code now on a machine that has a powerful GPU, but I'm not actually making use of any of the code libraries that would actually make use of the GPU, so technically this is really going to be the same thing. And it already finished. But when we get to the next tutorials that are going to come in the future, looking at LSTMs, and style transfer, Pix 2 Pix, those will really make use of a machine with a CPU. Okay it finished, it took seven seconds, there we go. Alright so that's going to wrap things up. I hope that you enjoyed this tutorial. I hope you learned a little bit about what it means to use a cloud computing resource to run code that you're writing on this computer or somewhere else, you could do it in Python and in other environments as well that are supported by Spell. Thank you so much to Spell for the opportunity to do these tutorials. I really appreciate it. I've had a lot of fun playing around with the platform and hope to use it again in future projects. So go over to the website, spell.run, give it a try. Ask your questions in the Comment. Look in the video's description for two links to the upcoming live streams, or if those have already happened, those links will be replaced with the archive of those live streams as well. So I can't wait to see what you make, how it works for you, what kind of things I forgot to talk about that I get to answer in the Comments. And I'll see you again someday on The Coding Train. (whistling) Choo Choo! (upbeat music)
