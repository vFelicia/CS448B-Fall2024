00:00 - hello in this video I'm going to take
00:02 - this example which is currently I called
00:05 - a brightness mirror where each pixel of
00:07 - the image is drawn as a rectangle
00:09 - brighter pixels bigger rectangle darker
00:11 - picture smaller rectangle I'm going to
00:13 - turn this example into what I'll call
00:16 - the check box mirror so instead of
00:18 - drawing to an html5 canvas based on a
00:22 - video source or an image source I want
00:24 - to create Dom elements checkboxes that
00:26 - get checked or unchecked based on the
00:28 - brightness of a pixel and incidentally
00:31 - while doing this we're going to look at
00:32 - an image processing effect called a
00:34 - threshold in effect so I'm just going to
00:36 - dive right in
00:37 - if you into this code example which was
00:40 - covered in the previous video which you
00:42 - could go back and watch if you haven't
00:43 - but I'm going to dive right in and start
00:44 - making it so let's go over to the code
00:46 - and the main thing the main sort of
00:49 - piece here in the code is that for every
00:51 - pixel I'm getting a brightness value
00:53 - that brightness value is the red plus
00:56 - the green plus the blue divided by 3 the
00:58 - average of the red green and blue
00:59 - components of the color so a threshold
01:01 - effect is an effect where you say ah
01:04 - there is a given threshold 127 any pixel
01:08 - that is a brightness over 127 I want to
01:11 - do something any pixel editor brightness
01:13 - less than 1 in 21:27 I want to do
01:15 - something else typically I might assign
01:17 - the pixel value for anything over 127 to
01:20 - white and anything less than 127 to
01:22 - black so let's do something like that I
01:25 - can say if bright is greater than
01:28 - threshold fill 255 so just anything
01:33 - above 127 make it 255 anything below
01:38 - 21:27 make it 0 now I could set pixels
01:40 - but since I'm doing drawing stuff I'm
01:42 - not going to bother with setting pixels
01:44 - I'm just going to go I don't need to do
01:45 - this mapping anymore to a size of a
01:47 - rectangle I'm just going to go right
01:49 - down get rid of this fill and just draw
01:52 - a rectangle at the full size that is
01:56 - either white or black based on that
01:59 - threshold so let me zoom back out let me
02:01 - refresh this and we should see now you
02:05 - can sort it now you see exactly what I'm
02:06 - talking about
02:07 - each rectangle in the screen is all is
02:10 - either white or back and you can see how
02:12 - it's white are
02:13 - white or black and you can see how I'm
02:14 - getting the sort of contours of the
02:16 - video almost like a silhouette a
02:17 - low-resolution silhouette with this
02:19 - threshold effect now one thing about it
02:22 - you'll notice if I go back to this
02:23 - example that I hard-coded a threshold
02:25 - value of 127 what would probably be more
02:28 - useful is to have a slider so you could
02:31 - adjust that threshold you based on you
02:33 - know whatever this sort of existing
02:34 - video is so let's actually do that so
02:37 - one thing I'm going to do is I'm going
02:38 - to make a variable called slider in p5
02:41 - an easy way to place a slider in the
02:43 - browser is with the create slider
02:44 - function of course there's a zillion
02:45 - other ways you can get a slider there
02:47 - but this is just one I'm going to say
02:49 - slider equals create slider and when you
02:51 - make a slider you need three values the
02:54 - minimum value for the slider the maximum
02:55 - value of the slider and where that
02:57 - slider starts so zero is the minimum 255
03:00 - is the maximum and we'll start it right
03:02 - there in the middle at 127 so if I go
03:06 - back and refresh you can see there's a
03:08 - slider down here now that I can move
03:09 - around the issue is I want to take the
03:12 - value of that slider and I want to I
03:15 - want to assign it to the threshold and
03:17 - that's actually a really easy thing for
03:18 - me to do right now because here I said
03:21 - threshold equals 127 all I have to do
03:23 - now to change that is say
03:24 - threshold equals slider dot value the
03:27 - value of the slider is the threshold
03:29 - sometimes code it just reads like
03:31 - language in its own sort of way if you
03:34 - read it backwards so now if I hit
03:36 - refresh you can see here there's the
03:40 - image I'm trying to look at the camera
03:41 - look at this but as I slide it up you
03:44 - can see that threshold is changing and
03:46 - you can see now with a lower threshold
03:47 - all of the pixels that are rather bright
03:50 - behind me are getting white and actually
03:53 - only my shirt which is kind of dark it's
03:55 - my hair which is kind of dark and you
03:57 - can see this is what the actual video is
03:59 - right all those dark pixels are getting
04:01 - assigned a black a black value so I kind
04:06 - of want to remember what this value is
04:08 - so I can actually just here in the
04:10 - console type slider dot value to see 77
04:13 - I kind of like this as a threshold value
04:15 - so I'm going to now I'm going to go and
04:17 - change the slider to start at 77 of
04:20 - course I can still adjust it but now
04:22 - each time I hit refresh it'll just start
04:25 - right at
04:26 - seven okay so now we have this threshold
04:29 - effect the thing that I want to do is I
04:32 - want to take each of these rectangles
04:35 - that I'm drawing in this canvas and not
04:37 - have it be a canvas with shapes and
04:39 - colors that I'm drawing I want to
04:41 - actually make Dom elements checkbox' Dom
04:43 - elements so let's look at how we do that
04:46 - if I go back to the code here I'm
04:50 - recording this yes okay just checking if
04:52 - I go back to the code see how I said
04:54 - create slider there's also a p5 function
04:57 - called create checkbox I'm just going to
04:59 - toss that into setup and you can see
05:02 - look there's a checkbox now there's a
05:03 - checkbox there now what I want to do is
05:05 - I want to make a lot of checkboxes in
05:08 - fact I want a checkbox for every single
05:10 - pixel in the video so I need a loop to
05:12 - make checkbox after checkbox after
05:14 - checkbox so I'm going to go back to the
05:15 - code and I'm going to say now what
05:17 - should I loop through how many checkbox
05:20 - design do I need well I need one for
05:22 - every X and every Y pixel so I need as
05:24 - many checkboxes as the width and the
05:26 - height width times the height of that
05:28 - video source how is going to draw a
05:31 - diagram but I think you're with me so
05:33 - one thing that I think would be useful
05:35 - is actually to just keep track of
05:37 - variables for the grid so what we've got
05:40 - here is going to have this whiteboard I
05:42 - insist on using it so in other words I
05:44 - want a checkbox and there's a certain
05:47 - number of columns right and a certain
05:50 - number of rows and those map to the
05:53 - width and height of the video so what I
05:56 - think would be useful is to have
05:57 - variables called columns and rows so I
05:59 - could just keep track of that number
06:01 - throughout my code because I'm gonna
06:03 - need to use it at a bunch of different
06:04 - places so what is columns the number of
06:09 - columns is the width of the canvas but
06:12 - the canvas is going to go away so I'm
06:15 - going to say 640 in fact it's funny how
06:18 - I could I could actually just sort of
06:20 - interestingly enough you know I just
06:23 - realized these should be actually a
06:25 - hard-coded value so let's think about
06:27 - what is a 640 divided by 16 you know I
06:30 - could probably do that math in my head
06:32 - but I got a console here 40 so let's say
06:34 - we're going to have 40 columns and 30
06:37 - rows it's kind of a reasonable number of
06:39 - boxes so so my video definitely needs to
06:43 - be the size of columns rose and I don't
06:48 - need to worry about all of that math
06:51 - anymore of scale of canvas because the
06:53 - canvas is going to go away I'm going to
06:54 - leave it there right now because it's
06:55 - useful to have it there as a reference
06:56 - so now what I need to do is I need to
06:59 - say for every column and for every row
07:16 - create a check box and that's not done
07:22 - there we go so now look at this look at
07:25 - all those check boxes so I now have a
07:28 - check box in the browser page for every
07:31 - single pixel but they're not really
07:32 - organized through by any logic right
07:33 - they're just all next to each other
07:35 - right and so I need them to maintain the
07:38 - same grid right I need to have exactly
07:41 - the number of check boxes in the first
07:42 - first row the second row the third row
07:44 - so I need to figure out some way of
07:46 - doing that
07:46 - so one way of doing that I knew I had a
07:48 - use for this whiteboard is that let's
07:54 - say I have I have this web page right
07:56 - this is the browser and what's happening
08:00 - when I call create checkbox is it just
08:02 - sticks of checkbox in the page then it
08:04 - sticks another one then 600 I'm doing
08:06 - that millions if not millions of times
08:07 - 40 times 30 times you can do the math
08:09 - right and it just keeps doing that it
08:11 - gets the edge of the page it wraps the
08:12 - next one what I want to actually do I
08:14 - think is establish a div a div being a
08:19 - container a box an area in the web page
08:22 - maybe I'll call that div mirror and I
08:25 - want to be able to always put the check
08:27 - boxes in that div that way I could
08:29 - control some style of the div its width
08:31 - and height its position on the page all
08:33 - of that sort of stuff
08:34 - so I think it would be useful to put a
08:36 - div now I could say creative because p5
08:40 - has a function creative to put a div in
08:42 - the page but I think this might be a
08:43 - moment where it's actually easier to
08:45 - just dig into the HTML itself so I've
08:47 - gone to the index.html file that's
08:49 - associated with this particular sketch
08:51 - and I'm actually just in the body right
08:54 - here I'm going to add a div and I'm
08:56 - going to say div id equals whoo let's
08:59 - zoom didn't weigh too much ID equals
09:02 - mirror so I the ID is very important I
09:08 - need to give that div an ID so I know
09:10 - how to reference it from my JavaScript
09:12 - code for my p5.js code so I want to put
09:14 - all the checkboxes into that particular
09:16 - div so let's do that
09:19 - whoops let's go back to sorry I need to
09:21 - go back to the JavaScript code and I
09:23 - need to I'm just going to I need to
09:25 - assign a variable to that checkbox take
09:28 - that bot that checkbox I may put it in a
09:30 - variable say box parent mirror and the
09:34 - parent function what it does it's a this
09:36 - Dom element you've just made put it
09:38 - inside that div so that div the mirror
09:41 - div becomes the parent to those
09:42 - checkboxes and if I run this now you can
09:46 - see they're there now you'll notice
09:47 - thing they're above because the canvas
09:48 - and everything else gets created after
09:51 - that particular div now what this allows
09:53 - me to do if I go back to the HTML file
09:56 - is add some styling for that div so
09:59 - pound or hash mirror this is CSS yeah we
10:03 - refer you to my CSS tutorial videos but
10:05 - I can do some things like say width and
10:09 - I'm going to make it a fixed width of
10:10 - 800 pixels I think I kind of worked this
10:11 - out earlier today I think that's going
10:13 - to work about right you know trial and
10:15 - error will probably get me that number
10:16 - and also just so I can see it for a
10:18 - moment I'm going to give it a background
10:19 - color like something kind of light just
10:22 - so we can see that that div is there I'm
10:24 - gonna hit refresh now you can see that
10:27 - that's the container essentially the box
10:30 - the div and all the check boxes are
10:32 - there and you can see it has a little
10:33 - bit of a background color now notice
10:35 - this didn't really work out I didn't get
10:37 - the exact number of width to like make
10:39 - sure that the make that sure the check
10:43 - boxes
10:43 - wrap appropriately but I'm gonna I'm
10:45 - going to actually do something to like
10:47 - 100% be right about this so in the
10:50 - sketch I'm looking at every single
10:54 - column in every single row and what I
10:56 - want to do is when I get to the end of a
10:58 - row I want to add a line break an HTML
11:01 - line break so the check boxes then go on
11:03 - to the next
11:04 - right I want to do you know 40 check
11:07 - boxes and then put a line break I came
11:11 - over here and I didn't change look I'm
11:12 - over here now sorry I want to put 40
11:14 - check boxes then do a line break and
11:18 - then do the next 40 check boxes okay so
11:22 - where do I do that in this loop I need
11:24 - to put a line break
11:25 - well incidentally I actually have my
11:26 - loop this is one of the few times where
11:28 - whether the X's on the outside or the
11:31 - X's on the inside is quite important
11:33 - right because what I need to be doing is
11:35 - I need to be saying first do the first
11:38 - row then all the x's then do the second
11:41 - row then on the X's so Y needs to be on
11:43 - the outside I have to do all the X's for
11:46 - every Y so I've actually got it fixed
11:48 - this and put Y on the outside and then
11:55 - what I can do is after I do a whole set
11:57 - of X's I can say a line break equals
12:04 - create div I'll just make a div with a
12:06 - line break in it and then also put
12:10 - parent that to what the mirror so now
12:15 - I'm guaranteeing that after every row of
12:19 - check boxes I get a line break so now
12:21 - let's run that oh that doesn't look
12:25 - right
12:26 - uh you know what let's try using create
12:30 - span I think the div has a lot of stuff
12:34 - it's not like in line so let's let's use
12:37 - creates man yeah that's better I knew I
12:39 - have this something so I'm trying to put
12:41 - something in there that doesn't have any
12:42 - padding or line break around it already
12:44 - and a span element allows me to that you
12:47 - could see at 800 pixels was about right
12:49 - for this particular area I could have
12:50 - you know maybe it's 750 or whatever but
12:52 - now I can also get rid of that I don't
12:55 - need to see the background color anymore
12:58 - that was just sort of for debugging I
13:00 - can take that out and we can see now I
13:02 - have a perfect grid of checkboxes the
13:06 - exact number for every single pixel in
13:08 - that source video and you can see here
13:11 - you know I can check them and uncheck
13:12 - them but that's not what I want to
13:14 - happen I want to maybe check the dark
13:17 - once and uncheck the light ones so how
13:21 - do I do that well first of all I need to
13:23 - have a way of referring to those
13:25 - checkboxes like I made them all and I
13:28 - put them on the page but I didn't store
13:29 - anything so I need an array I need to
13:31 - keep track of all those Dom elements
13:33 - over time how am I doing here
13:36 - 13 minutes let's try to make this under
13:37 - 15 minutes it's not going to be okay so
13:41 - I make an array called boxes and what
13:45 - I'm going to do is for every checkbox
13:46 - that I make I'm going to put that
13:49 - checkbox in the array so I make an empty
13:51 - array and I'm storing them all so I now
13:53 - have this big array if i refresh the
13:56 - page and I go over here the console and
13:59 - take a look you can see I have an array
14:00 - with 1200 check boxes in it gives 40
14:03 - times 30 is 1200 1200 pixels 1200 check
14:07 - boxes there's a lot of them they're all
14:09 - p5 elements okay and you can there's all
14:12 - sorts of stuff associated with that so
14:13 - now how do I check or uncheck them so
14:17 - right here where I was saying with my
14:20 - threat threshold effect I was previously
14:22 - saying if the brightness is greater than
14:24 - a given threshold fill white otherwise
14:27 - fill black instead what I want to do is
14:29 - I want to say something like check o
14:31 - boxes index checked false boxes index
14:40 - checked true so what I want to do is I
14:45 - want to uncheck the bright ones check
14:49 - the dark ones and this is a p5 function
14:51 - the check function is a way of
14:52 - dynamically checking or unchecking a
14:54 - check box with code if you don't give an
14:57 - argument it just gives you returns you
14:58 - whether it's checked or unchecked which
14:59 - is usually what you use a check box for
15:01 - okay but this index isn't exactly right
15:04 - remember because the index was this
15:06 - thing where I was trying to look up a
15:08 - pixel and the pixels are like RGB so I
15:10 - need my own index this index of looking
15:13 - up the pixels is different than the
15:15 - index into that array of of check boxes
15:18 - unfortunately so I'm going to make a new
15:21 - variable I'm going to call that a check
15:25 - index and it is equal to
15:30 - x plus y times the number of columns and
15:36 - then I'm going to use that checked index
15:39 - so there we go what I'm doing is it's
15:42 - I'm doing both actually to get rid of
15:44 - the rectangle in a second but instead of
15:46 - ultimately instead of drawing rectangles
15:48 - based on pixels I'm checking it
15:50 - unchecking check boxes and I have an
15:52 - array of pixels that I have to look up
15:54 - the color one way using the X plus y
15:57 - times for a whole nonsense and I have to
16:00 - look up in the check box array a
16:01 - different way because there are not
16:03 - there's not an RGB and alpha for each
16:05 - check box or just one check box I had to
16:07 - say this to myself because it's very
16:09 - confusing okay let's take a look now hit
16:12 - refresh and we can see here
16:14 - come on video there it is so you can see
16:17 - that right there I am I'm going to
16:18 - high-five myself again that's not really
16:20 - working but you can see my face here in
16:24 - check boxes can zoom in a little bit you
16:26 - can see those check boxes are going up
16:29 - and down based on my face here and what
16:32 - I'm looking at amar okay
16:33 - it was exciting it works sorry I wasn't
16:34 - sure where that was going to happen so
16:36 - what I want to do now is just get rid of
16:38 - I'm going to say instead of create
16:40 - canvas I'm going to say no canvas and
16:42 - I'm going to get rid of load pixels
16:45 - which doesn't need to be in there and I
16:47 - don't need background anymore
16:49 - there's no canvas I don't need these
16:52 - fills anymore I just want to simplify
16:54 - this I don't need this anymore and now
16:56 - if we run this again we should see just
17:00 - the check box mirror on the page and you
17:03 - can see here I can play with that
17:04 - threshold still you can see based on
17:06 - what I do with the threshold we get
17:09 - different sort of effects and there it
17:11 - is the dumb check box up load it
17:15 - refreshing it because I like that value
17:16 - of seventy-seven the Dom check box
17:19 - mirror so I don't know so one somebody
17:22 - had in a comment really said oh wouldn't
17:23 - radio buttons be better maybe you'll get
17:25 - a better effect you know I would
17:27 - encourage you can you do something weird
17:28 - with like sliders make just regular divs
17:30 - text on the page
17:31 - what kind of I would love to see
17:34 - people's Frankenstein creations of Dom
17:36 - elements of visualizing image data with
17:39 - no canvas and no pixels no drawing just
17:41 - manipulating
17:42 - elements themselves so give that a try
17:44 - tweet me or write in the comments if you
17:46 - make something I would love to see how
17:47 - it turns out thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello in this video I'm going to take this example which is currently I called a brightness mirror where each pixel of the image is drawn as a rectangle brighter pixels bigger rectangle darker picture smaller rectangle I'm going to turn this example into what I'll call the check box mirror so instead of drawing to an html5 canvas based on a video source or an image source I want to create Dom elements checkboxes that get checked or unchecked based on the brightness of a pixel and incidentally while doing this we're going to look at an image processing effect called a threshold in effect so I'm just going to dive right in if you into this code example which was covered in the previous video which you could go back and watch if you haven't but I'm going to dive right in and start making it so let's go over to the code and the main thing the main sort of piece here in the code is that for every pixel I'm getting a brightness value that brightness value is the red plus the green plus the blue divided by 3 the average of the red green and blue components of the color so a threshold effect is an effect where you say ah there is a given threshold 127 any pixel that is a brightness over 127 I want to do something any pixel editor brightness less than 1 in 2127 I want to do something else typically I might assign the pixel value for anything over 127 to white and anything less than 127 to black so let's do something like that I can say if bright is greater than threshold fill 255 so just anything above 127 make it 255 anything below 2127 make it 0 now I could set pixels but since I'm doing drawing stuff I'm not going to bother with setting pixels I'm just going to go I don't need to do this mapping anymore to a size of a rectangle I'm just going to go right down get rid of this fill and just draw a rectangle at the full size that is either white or black based on that threshold so let me zoom back out let me refresh this and we should see now you can sort it now you see exactly what I'm talking about each rectangle in the screen is all is either white or back and you can see how it's white are white or black and you can see how I'm getting the sort of contours of the video almost like a silhouette a lowresolution silhouette with this threshold effect now one thing about it you'll notice if I go back to this example that I hardcoded a threshold value of 127 what would probably be more useful is to have a slider so you could adjust that threshold you based on you know whatever this sort of existing video is so let's actually do that so one thing I'm going to do is I'm going to make a variable called slider in p5 an easy way to place a slider in the browser is with the create slider function of course there's a zillion other ways you can get a slider there but this is just one I'm going to say slider equals create slider and when you make a slider you need three values the minimum value for the slider the maximum value of the slider and where that slider starts so zero is the minimum 255 is the maximum and we'll start it right there in the middle at 127 so if I go back and refresh you can see there's a slider down here now that I can move around the issue is I want to take the value of that slider and I want to I want to assign it to the threshold and that's actually a really easy thing for me to do right now because here I said threshold equals 127 all I have to do now to change that is say threshold equals slider dot value the value of the slider is the threshold sometimes code it just reads like language in its own sort of way if you read it backwards so now if I hit refresh you can see here there's the image I'm trying to look at the camera look at this but as I slide it up you can see that threshold is changing and you can see now with a lower threshold all of the pixels that are rather bright behind me are getting white and actually only my shirt which is kind of dark it's my hair which is kind of dark and you can see this is what the actual video is right all those dark pixels are getting assigned a black a black value so I kind of want to remember what this value is so I can actually just here in the console type slider dot value to see 77 I kind of like this as a threshold value so I'm going to now I'm going to go and change the slider to start at 77 of course I can still adjust it but now each time I hit refresh it'll just start right at seven okay so now we have this threshold effect the thing that I want to do is I want to take each of these rectangles that I'm drawing in this canvas and not have it be a canvas with shapes and colors that I'm drawing I want to actually make Dom elements checkbox' Dom elements so let's look at how we do that if I go back to the code here I'm recording this yes okay just checking if I go back to the code see how I said create slider there's also a p5 function called create checkbox I'm just going to toss that into setup and you can see look there's a checkbox now there's a checkbox there now what I want to do is I want to make a lot of checkboxes in fact I want a checkbox for every single pixel in the video so I need a loop to make checkbox after checkbox after checkbox so I'm going to go back to the code and I'm going to say now what should I loop through how many checkbox design do I need well I need one for every X and every Y pixel so I need as many checkboxes as the width and the height width times the height of that video source how is going to draw a diagram but I think you're with me so one thing that I think would be useful is actually to just keep track of variables for the grid so what we've got here is going to have this whiteboard I insist on using it so in other words I want a checkbox and there's a certain number of columns right and a certain number of rows and those map to the width and height of the video so what I think would be useful is to have variables called columns and rows so I could just keep track of that number throughout my code because I'm gonna need to use it at a bunch of different places so what is columns the number of columns is the width of the canvas but the canvas is going to go away so I'm going to say 640 in fact it's funny how I could I could actually just sort of interestingly enough you know I just realized these should be actually a hardcoded value so let's think about what is a 640 divided by 16 you know I could probably do that math in my head but I got a console here 40 so let's say we're going to have 40 columns and 30 rows it's kind of a reasonable number of boxes so so my video definitely needs to be the size of columns rose and I don't need to worry about all of that math anymore of scale of canvas because the canvas is going to go away I'm going to leave it there right now because it's useful to have it there as a reference so now what I need to do is I need to say for every column and for every row create a check box and that's not done there we go so now look at this look at all those check boxes so I now have a check box in the browser page for every single pixel but they're not really organized through by any logic right they're just all next to each other right and so I need them to maintain the same grid right I need to have exactly the number of check boxes in the first first row the second row the third row so I need to figure out some way of doing that so one way of doing that I knew I had a use for this whiteboard is that let's say I have I have this web page right this is the browser and what's happening when I call create checkbox is it just sticks of checkbox in the page then it sticks another one then 600 I'm doing that millions if not millions of times 40 times 30 times you can do the math right and it just keeps doing that it gets the edge of the page it wraps the next one what I want to actually do I think is establish a div a div being a container a box an area in the web page maybe I'll call that div mirror and I want to be able to always put the check boxes in that div that way I could control some style of the div its width and height its position on the page all of that sort of stuff so I think it would be useful to put a div now I could say creative because p5 has a function creative to put a div in the page but I think this might be a moment where it's actually easier to just dig into the HTML itself so I've gone to the index.html file that's associated with this particular sketch and I'm actually just in the body right here I'm going to add a div and I'm going to say div id equals whoo let's zoom didn't weigh too much ID equals mirror so I the ID is very important I need to give that div an ID so I know how to reference it from my JavaScript code for my p5.js code so I want to put all the checkboxes into that particular div so let's do that whoops let's go back to sorry I need to go back to the JavaScript code and I need to I'm just going to I need to assign a variable to that checkbox take that bot that checkbox I may put it in a variable say box parent mirror and the parent function what it does it's a this Dom element you've just made put it inside that div so that div the mirror div becomes the parent to those checkboxes and if I run this now you can see they're there now you'll notice thing they're above because the canvas and everything else gets created after that particular div now what this allows me to do if I go back to the HTML file is add some styling for that div so pound or hash mirror this is CSS yeah we refer you to my CSS tutorial videos but I can do some things like say width and I'm going to make it a fixed width of 800 pixels I think I kind of worked this out earlier today I think that's going to work about right you know trial and error will probably get me that number and also just so I can see it for a moment I'm going to give it a background color like something kind of light just so we can see that that div is there I'm gonna hit refresh now you can see that that's the container essentially the box the div and all the check boxes are there and you can see it has a little bit of a background color now notice this didn't really work out I didn't get the exact number of width to like make sure that the make that sure the check boxes wrap appropriately but I'm gonna I'm going to actually do something to like 100% be right about this so in the sketch I'm looking at every single column in every single row and what I want to do is when I get to the end of a row I want to add a line break an HTML line break so the check boxes then go on to the next right I want to do you know 40 check boxes and then put a line break I came over here and I didn't change look I'm over here now sorry I want to put 40 check boxes then do a line break and then do the next 40 check boxes okay so where do I do that in this loop I need to put a line break well incidentally I actually have my loop this is one of the few times where whether the X's on the outside or the X's on the inside is quite important right because what I need to be doing is I need to be saying first do the first row then all the x's then do the second row then on the X's so Y needs to be on the outside I have to do all the X's for every Y so I've actually got it fixed this and put Y on the outside and then what I can do is after I do a whole set of X's I can say a line break equals create div I'll just make a div with a line break in it and then also put parent that to what the mirror so now I'm guaranteeing that after every row of check boxes I get a line break so now let's run that oh that doesn't look right uh you know what let's try using create span I think the div has a lot of stuff it's not like in line so let's let's use creates man yeah that's better I knew I have this something so I'm trying to put something in there that doesn't have any padding or line break around it already and a span element allows me to that you could see at 800 pixels was about right for this particular area I could have you know maybe it's 750 or whatever but now I can also get rid of that I don't need to see the background color anymore that was just sort of for debugging I can take that out and we can see now I have a perfect grid of checkboxes the exact number for every single pixel in that source video and you can see here you know I can check them and uncheck them but that's not what I want to happen I want to maybe check the dark once and uncheck the light ones so how do I do that well first of all I need to have a way of referring to those checkboxes like I made them all and I put them on the page but I didn't store anything so I need an array I need to keep track of all those Dom elements over time how am I doing here 13 minutes let's try to make this under 15 minutes it's not going to be okay so I make an array called boxes and what I'm going to do is for every checkbox that I make I'm going to put that checkbox in the array so I make an empty array and I'm storing them all so I now have this big array if i refresh the page and I go over here the console and take a look you can see I have an array with 1200 check boxes in it gives 40 times 30 is 1200 1200 pixels 1200 check boxes there's a lot of them they're all p5 elements okay and you can there's all sorts of stuff associated with that so now how do I check or uncheck them so right here where I was saying with my threat threshold effect I was previously saying if the brightness is greater than a given threshold fill white otherwise fill black instead what I want to do is I want to say something like check o boxes index checked false boxes index checked true so what I want to do is I want to uncheck the bright ones check the dark ones and this is a p5 function the check function is a way of dynamically checking or unchecking a check box with code if you don't give an argument it just gives you returns you whether it's checked or unchecked which is usually what you use a check box for okay but this index isn't exactly right remember because the index was this thing where I was trying to look up a pixel and the pixels are like RGB so I need my own index this index of looking up the pixels is different than the index into that array of of check boxes unfortunately so I'm going to make a new variable I'm going to call that a check index and it is equal to x plus y times the number of columns and then I'm going to use that checked index so there we go what I'm doing is it's I'm doing both actually to get rid of the rectangle in a second but instead of ultimately instead of drawing rectangles based on pixels I'm checking it unchecking check boxes and I have an array of pixels that I have to look up the color one way using the X plus y times for a whole nonsense and I have to look up in the check box array a different way because there are not there's not an RGB and alpha for each check box or just one check box I had to say this to myself because it's very confusing okay let's take a look now hit refresh and we can see here come on video there it is so you can see that right there I am I'm going to highfive myself again that's not really working but you can see my face here in check boxes can zoom in a little bit you can see those check boxes are going up and down based on my face here and what I'm looking at amar okay it was exciting it works sorry I wasn't sure where that was going to happen so what I want to do now is just get rid of I'm going to say instead of create canvas I'm going to say no canvas and I'm going to get rid of load pixels which doesn't need to be in there and I don't need background anymore there's no canvas I don't need these fills anymore I just want to simplify this I don't need this anymore and now if we run this again we should see just the check box mirror on the page and you can see here I can play with that threshold still you can see based on what I do with the threshold we get different sort of effects and there it is the dumb check box up load it refreshing it because I like that value of seventyseven the Dom check box mirror so I don't know so one somebody had in a comment really said oh wouldn't radio buttons be better maybe you'll get a better effect you know I would encourage you can you do something weird with like sliders make just regular divs text on the page what kind of I would love to see people's Frankenstein creations of Dom elements of visualizing image data with no canvas and no pixels no drawing just manipulating elements themselves so give that a try tweet me or write in the comments if you make something I would love to see how it turns out thanks for watching
