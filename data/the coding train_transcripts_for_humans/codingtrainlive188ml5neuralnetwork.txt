05:27 - good morning happy Saturday it's like
05:30 - this like the old days in Saturday
05:32 - morning when everyone would wake up and
05:34 - gather around the television tube not
05:37 - the youtube and watch cartoons and now
05:41 - you're all here gathered around the
05:43 - YouTube and watching the coding trade
05:47 - it's very weird to be here on a Saturday
05:50 - especially in the morning I don't think
05:52 - I've ever struck I probably streamed on
05:54 - a Saturday before I don't know that i've
05:56 - streamed on a Saturday morning before
05:57 - this isn't a particularly great time I
06:00 - mean there's something about this time
06:01 - it's actually quite nice I feel sort of
06:03 - relaxed in a bit at ease
06:06 - and kind of very glad to be here but
06:08 - also you know the weekend is the weekend
06:10 - and there's lots of family stuff and
06:12 - other things going on so I don't know
06:13 - that I'll be making a habit of this but
06:19 - here we are nonetheless welcome it's so
06:23 - nice to see so many people here I don't
06:25 - actually see you but I feel your
06:26 - presence I feel more calm today for some
06:30 - strange reason maybe it's because I read
06:32 - the marathon last weekend and and I have
06:37 - a very particular topic that I want to
06:39 - focus on today just quickly before I go
06:44 - that topic I want to just thank the
06:46 - sponsors today for Saturday's coding
06:49 - train livestream which are - Lane and
06:51 - Linode so if you go to - Lane comm slash
06:55 - coding train or Leno dot-com slash
06:58 - coding train you can find out about both
06:59 - of these web services - Lane 4 as a
07:01 - password manager and Lou node as a cloud
07:04 - server and I'll come back in the middle
07:06 - of the livestream and talk to you a bit
07:08 - more about the sponsors and show you
07:10 - some clips and things features that they
07:12 - have and tell you about the coupon codes
07:14 - okay so the console.log hello world says
07:23 - Cybertron hello
07:25 - Cybertron it is but still a bit low and
07:29 - Nathan in the chat is way so nathan is a
07:34 - very loyal viewer who has
07:37 - really been getting at me to do some
07:40 - upgrading of the audio equipment that I
07:43 - have is actually quite good I believe I
07:46 - have a lav mic here actually have a
07:48 - shotgun mic over there that I don't use
07:50 - but what I really need to do is some
07:54 - fine-tuning of the audio there I use a
07:56 - piece of software called open broadcast
07:58 - studio we actually check I don't believe
08:00 - I'm recording anything to disk right now
08:02 - I'm gonna add that it's right here I'm
08:04 - gonna hit start recording and the focus
08:07 - is also down a point you know I I'm out
08:09 - of I'm not of practice here it's
08:12 - Saturday morning and I'm just like
08:14 - what's going on I should be at home
08:16 - having brunch and putting my reading a
08:20 - nice magazine or book and listening to
08:23 - some jazz music on the radio I'm gonna
08:28 - use this not a sponsor but favorite one
08:33 - of my favorite products called the elko
08:35 - stream deck which is by tool for
08:38 - focusing because I put it over there and
08:40 - then I walk over to the camera and I
08:44 - focus on it there we go I think that's
08:50 - problem is my eyesight it's actually
08:52 - quite bad so I can't even see good
08:59 - enough I think that's better
09:04 - alright so one thing I want to mention
09:06 - today if you have been paying attention
09:09 - to the coding terrain YouTube channel
09:11 - you would be aware of this but if you're
09:14 - not if you go to the coding train comm
09:17 - /tm for teachable machine will take you
09:22 - to a web page which has three videos
09:26 - that I actually two videos that I
09:28 - released this week and one that's still
09:30 - sitting on the channel as unlisted other
09:33 - people are asking for the audio to be a
09:35 - little bit louder I'm always afraid to
09:37 - turn it up because I'm just worried
09:40 - about it peaking but everybody is
09:42 - telling me that it could be louder so
09:44 - let's let me go I have a little dial
09:47 - here's this little dial I see it here
09:50 - it's call
09:51 - it says gain on it it's on this audio
09:53 - interface it's blinking green and if I
09:56 - just turn it a little bit to the right
09:58 - I have now made myself a little bit
10:00 - louder I think and I see it's in the
10:03 - yellow but not in the red the problem is
10:05 - like it's very excited sometimes going
10:09 - into the red but a teachable machine is
10:13 - a project from Google Creative Lab that
10:18 - I referred to in a lot of my ml 5 je s
10:22 - videos and but they released a new
10:25 - version of it if I go to teachable
10:28 - machine with google.com I will be on
10:31 - this webpage and it is a fast and easy
10:36 - way to create machine learning models
10:37 - for your sites apps and more no
10:38 - expertise or coding required and you can
10:42 - see that so base I'm not going to go
10:44 - through this right now because I have
10:45 - three videos that go through it in quite
10:48 - a bit of detail but I encourage you to
10:51 - check out the video about it there they
10:54 - actually have their own tutorials that
10:56 - you can watch that are much more
10:58 - succinct and it's like insane as mine so
11:02 - I don't know what your preference is but
11:04 - if you just want to learn how it works I
11:05 - would definitely recommend you watch
11:07 - theirs instead of mine if you want to
11:08 - watch somebody embarrass themselves for
11:10 - 15 or 20 minutes then you can watch mine
11:12 - there's some wonderful projects and what
11:15 - I what I'm excited one things I'm very
11:16 - excited about is how they've integrated
11:19 - the teachable machine machine learning
11:22 - models with all these other libraries
11:25 - and frameworks in particular the p5.js
11:27 - library with the ml5 library so I don't
11:32 - want to go through this now it really
11:35 - relates to what I do want to do in this
11:37 - session which is a look at a particular
11:41 - feature of the ml 5 library that it also
11:45 - deals with training a model but I would
11:48 - encourage you to check out my videos and
11:51 - in particular I would really love to see
11:55 - what people make with this I mean I love
11:58 - that for everything but I'm particularly
12:00 - curious as to whether this method
12:04 - Oh G of working this interface in the
12:06 - browser that allows you to train a model
12:08 - and then download that model or export
12:10 - or upload that model to work with say
12:11 - p5.js and ml5 if that's something that
12:15 - inspires people to make creative work
12:18 - and so for all any of these videos if
12:21 - you click on this to the tutorial button
12:23 - and there's actually the one of them has
12:26 - you'll see there's this area called
12:28 - community contributions and I want to
12:30 - see your community contributions here so
12:32 - badly so please and because I would like
12:37 - to come back and look at some of them
12:38 - and play with them on a future video
12:40 - there was one so I think if I go to them
12:42 - maybe the snake game yes so Mika crucial
12:47 - who has been a wonderful supporter of
12:50 - the channel in contributions on github
12:53 - thank you so much for you adding a lot
12:55 - of stuff to the website and things that
12:57 - I really appreciate that if this is the
12:59 - only community contribution that I know
13:01 - of so let's try it and what's one of the
13:05 - things that's really interesting about
13:06 - this system is if you train the models
13:11 - say using your webcam it's going to
13:14 - learn the context of what your webcam is
13:17 - looking at so let's say you train it to
13:19 - recognize a banana versus an orange
13:22 - would that still work when I look at it
13:25 - here in this context with the green
13:26 - screen behind me all right so I am Here
13:30 - I am loading there we go so I think the
13:33 - idea here is that I'm supposed to play
13:35 - rock-paper-scissors with the computer
13:38 - hmm I guess the computer is just winning
13:42 - oh no I want I guess it's actually
13:45 - detecting that I did scissors or I'm
13:46 - gonna do paper it detected my paper
13:50 - that's awesome of course I lost paper
13:53 - again I win let's see you does it detect
13:55 - rock
14:06 - there we go thinks that scissors thinks
14:11 - that's paper so what a couple things I
14:17 - would say here is that interaction
14:19 - design wise just as a little critique
14:21 - here I'm kind of confused so what I
14:24 - think I understand is that's what the
14:26 - computer is picking and that's what I'm
14:28 - picking but what I'm but what I'm really
14:30 - confused here is about the timing so I
14:32 - feel there's this like ready but I feel
14:35 - like what might be helpful is some sort
14:37 - of like countdown timer like get into
14:39 - position you know because when you play
14:41 - it one way to play the game is rock
14:43 - paper scissors or says shoot like that
14:45 - kind of thing so I wonder if there's
14:47 - some kind of way that it could step me
14:50 - through the process a bit more and maybe
14:53 - the visual language of this being bigger
14:55 - is meaningful and the I could be emojis
14:58 - is like what's the computer versus me or
15:00 - also I think quite effective
15:02 - but something about the difference in
15:04 - sizes and the placement I like that the
15:07 - video is there but kind of faded into
15:09 - the background that's kind of I think a
15:11 - nice idea but I think there may be there
15:13 - could be some other ways to think about
15:16 - how to do the interface I also am really
15:18 - lost in finding myself because I think
15:20 - this is cropped and I would I would
15:22 - always I would mirror the video because
15:24 - it just makes interacting with things
15:25 - much easier because oh no it is mirrored
15:27 - it is mirrored it's definitely mirrored
15:30 - I just was oh I see maybe it's doing
15:32 - that on purpose so that if I put so that
15:34 - there we go I see this is what it wants
15:36 - me to do so maybe there could be it
15:38 - could there could be a bit of a stage
15:39 - where it lets you kind of get set and it
15:42 - seems there's a moment also where it's
15:43 - like freezing and not that's find that
15:46 - very distracting so I kind of want to
15:48 - see it always great so I want to see
15:51 - more of these Oh me cos in the chat the
15:55 - timer is the pink bar at the top okay
16:02 - got it
16:06 - I see I see
16:10 - ah and Simon is saying that there have
16:14 - been a bunch of community contributions
16:16 - from the interactive drawing video so
16:18 - maybe I will
16:19 - let's let's go let's go take a quick
16:21 - peek at that
16:22 - Oh one thing I need to do so I have this
16:27 - iPad here where I can play and the cold
16:30 - left conjecture okay okay everybody
16:32 - settle down settle down
16:35 - it only has 2% battery left so I'm going
16:38 - to unplug over here so I won't have any
16:41 - music for a little while let me let this
16:43 - charge up but it'll charge up by
16:46 - hopefully the time that I need that
16:48 - music all right let's check out what
16:50 - else is happening on the channel here
16:52 - there's the interactive drawing was one
16:55 - of our recent video that I can take a
16:57 - look at and also the koloff's conjecture
17:01 - I haven't had the time to do another one
17:03 - of these Cabana videos which I'm very
17:04 - sad about ironically I probably would
17:07 - have done one this morning but what's
17:09 - been coming here to do this live stream
17:11 - but too many things to do okay
17:15 - I don't see any community contributions
17:16 - for this one yet I'm shocked I'm shocked
17:19 - I'm shocked after community contribution
17:21 - for this video let's check out the
17:24 - coalesced conjecture they definitely
17:25 - have been a bunch whoa there's a lot
17:27 - amazing let me just do a quick click
17:31 - through I'm just gonna open them all up
17:33 - this one for some reason doesn't have a
17:35 - link let's let's open that this is
17:37 - probably a bad idea what I'm doing
17:39 - let's let's just let's just look through
17:42 - these okay of course
17:45 - mwah little rainbow koloff's conjecture
17:49 - visualization got to love that this is
17:51 - by a sequential chaos now we've got one
17:55 - that is by Alvaro ko looks pretty
17:58 - similar to mine but there's probably
18:00 - something different here that I'm not
18:02 - aware of let's see if it says growing
18:05 - visualization oh no no if this this is
18:08 - not similar than mine I made a version
18:09 - of this like this myself just to make a
18:11 - gif to post on Twitter but this one is
18:13 - actually animating it I forgot that my
18:15 - video tutorial doesn't animate it so
18:17 - that's wonderful thank you for that
18:18 - um koloff's tree refresh Oh sad where's
18:26 - the tree
18:27 - [Music]
18:29 - why is it showing me all this nonsense
18:31 - okay so I'm not sure what's happening
18:33 - with this one we can click on looking at
18:36 - the code and try running it here so I
18:38 - have to click I probably have to click
18:39 - or something nope
18:42 - so I'm not sure what's going on here
18:44 - Donna we let me know I'm happy to try
18:47 - showing it again this is a coal lots
18:53 - visualization from a spectral flame
18:55 - added code for animated and static
18:58 - drawing so one thing I certainly
18:59 - recommend if you can let's see is to add
19:03 - a readme file with like a gif animation
19:05 - or a screen shot that scroll down the
19:08 - page says Simon let me go back to that
19:11 - one the coal Lots growing tree okay
19:14 - let's go back to uh it was just it was
19:22 - just taking up a lot of space there it
19:24 - is another growing one and I like the
19:25 - color selection here the green this is a
19:27 - good team trees if you have a major team
19:29 - trees donation please go ahead and do
19:32 - that oh here's a really night look at
19:35 - this one I like this from super Rimbaud
19:40 - this is kholat sunray sun sunrise from
19:44 - anuraag Hazra this is quite lovely this
19:48 - was I saw this on Twitter and a lot of
19:51 - people had sort of fun names for this
19:53 - kind of supernovae I like design and I
19:55 - like this use of dat GUI here looks like
19:58 - I could probably try changing various
20:02 - parameters and I don't know if oh and
20:05 - then if I click I guess it will it'll
20:07 - it'll every time I click it'll reset and
20:09 - rerun with these new parameters I really
20:15 - want to do some more prints printing of
20:17 - these and make some so that's our
20:21 - plotter stuff I kind of come back to
20:22 - that today this is lovely okay
20:30 - Kolak Swede this is interesting
20:33 - again another processing one there's
20:36 - this now I really want to kind of run
20:38 - this so I've tried like I guess I guess
20:42 - to run one that's in processing I have
20:44 - to just download it and now if I'm gonna
20:46 - do this I should also go back to
20:48 - spectral flames because it's only fair a
20:56 - lot of stuff in this downloads directory
20:58 - but since there's a fish I got to know
21:00 - what this fish is oh look at that I love
21:09 - this so I love this I think what I love
21:12 - about this which surprises me in a way
21:14 - is using I suppose this Co Lots
21:16 - conjecture visualization in scene so you
21:20 - could imagine this being a 2-d game that
21:24 - you're playing whether you're moving of
21:25 - drop bump you know what you're the fish
21:27 - and you're controlling the fish and the
21:28 - fish has to eat or swim or whatever but
21:30 - well the while those you know the trees
21:33 - at the seaweed at the bottom was all
21:35 - coming from the coal lots conjecture
21:39 - okay let's Oh Kolak my seat REE
21:44 - I guess so this looks like maybe it just
21:46 - picks a different angle and a color
21:48 - skiing each time which is really really
21:51 - nice so nice to see these on these
21:54 - variations another rainbow one Thank You
21:58 - Louis still a all and we're seeing this
22:00 - also on code pen so it's nice to see
22:02 - people try different code editors and
22:04 - frameworks Eric rovol it posted
22:09 - something about trying a 60-degree angle
22:12 - and it looks like the image I'm seeing
22:14 - over here on my slack chat screen is
22:16 - showing a very like hexagonal pattern
22:18 - which is nice I don't know if that's
22:19 - gonna show up another one here garrulous
22:25 - - bye Diplo focus oh wait I think I made
22:28 - everything tiny there we go whoo I like
22:29 - this I like I like this idea of these
22:31 - sort of like - lines here
22:34 - spectral flame we're going to try that
22:36 - let's try spectral flame
22:43 - let's cure this here up let's get rid of
22:48 - this here and
22:55 - try this nope that's the other one not
23:01 - this one there we go
23:04 - ooh I like this I like the layering of
23:07 - this now what's different I guess it's
23:10 - doing huge sections at once and then
23:12 - varying the color and kind of blending
23:14 - it it's quite oh wow this is quite
23:19 - enjoyable needs some use this needs full
23:23 - screen in music I just let you enjoy
23:27 - this for a minute
23:47 - oh I still have my mic on I thought I'd
23:52 - muted my mic I was thinking a break
23:54 - there give myself a break
23:56 - so does immunity my mic probably her me
23:59 - some tea over there okay I'm back
24:04 - hello this is lovely ah beautiful just
24:08 - beautiful okay
24:12 - refresh the repo oh look at this here's
24:20 - a nice read me
24:22 - I'm solicited okay the version of
24:24 - numberphile uses the angle of pi divided
24:27 - by 13 to the right and pi divided by 20
24:29 - to the left they have these long lines
24:32 - with bumps on the underside of them okay
24:34 - I think if I'm right spectral flame
24:37 - maybe you also commented in the actual
24:40 - YouTube video somebody wrote a really
24:41 - excellent commentary about somewhere
24:43 - that I did read it was on Twitter or in
24:45 - the YouTube video or maybe it was oh
24:47 - maybe this was the conversation we had
24:49 - on github but and maybe it was spectral
24:53 - flame apologies if it was somebody else
24:55 - who really did it sort of deep dive in
24:57 - figuring out what were the properties of
24:59 - the visualization from the numberphile
25:01 - video and how those were different from
25:03 - the ones that I that the version that I
25:06 - created and it looks like there's a
25:07 - really nice explanation of that here and
25:09 - played around with some more and got
25:11 - this colorful artwork and equals it so
25:14 - it's hard to read five million change
25:17 - the color plow to include all colors Wow
25:20 - look at that that is quite something
25:28 - technique Collins is asking where can I
25:33 - get the documentation for the quick-draw
25:35 - project so I'm not sure exactly what
25:38 - you're referring to but if you're
25:40 - referring to the actual quick-draw
25:43 - dataset that is also from Google
25:47 - Creative Lab and there's a github repo
25:49 - that has all of the documentation of the
25:51 - quick-draw dataset if you're looking for
25:54 - information related to my video tutorial
25:57 - that makes use of a
25:59 - machine learning model called sketch RNN
26:00 - which was trained on the quick-draw
26:03 - dataset then you can find that at the
26:08 - coding train comm if I go to this the
26:11 - challenge page and typically I mean
26:13 - sometimes things are missing here and if
26:15 - they are you can file an issue or
26:16 - actually submit the link but all of the
26:19 - relevant links related to the material
26:21 - that I use should show up here other
26:23 - videos that are related to show up here
26:25 - and then community contributions but if
26:27 - you're looking for the code you can find
26:29 - that here and a lot of time my goal is
26:31 - to always have JavaScript code
26:32 - processing code and a link to the
26:34 - version running in the web editor but
26:36 - this one has no processing code because
26:38 - I don't currently have a Java
26:43 - I didn't there's not an easy way to
26:47 - bring the sketch RNN model into Java
26:49 - I'm definitely possible but it's not
26:51 - something that I've spent some time
26:53 - doing
26:54 - I added this overlay thing I know there
27:00 - haven't been any new members or anything
27:01 - joining yet I'm just curious if
27:03 - something's gonna pop up will it Cody
27:07 - train will ask DT six will you try Q
27:10 - learning in the near future so I would
27:12 - answer yes to that question if we could
27:14 - take the word near out it's really it's
27:16 - a little bit's I'm having a tough time
27:19 - I'm just definitely doing a lot and
27:22 - making content and I made this list I
27:25 - definitely don't have it Simon probably
27:27 - has it handy somewhere at the beginning
27:29 - of the semester of kind of the things
27:30 - that I wanted to do this semester I've
27:32 - gotten to very few of them I haven't
27:33 - gotten to some of them but I got a very
27:35 - few of them a q-learning is on my list
27:38 - of things that I would like to tackle
27:39 - it's not something that I have a lot of
27:41 - experience with a researcher here at NYU
27:45 - named Aiden Nelson has made a bunch of
27:47 - q-learning examples with p5 I can try to
27:50 - find those and and and Link those
27:53 - contain well they look like that overlay
27:57 - works I would have to refund you your
27:59 - money thank you oh oh that's sad what do
28:03 - what I need to do to get that to work
28:07 - well
28:13 - there we go thanks Simon is now sharing
28:15 - with you me on my list
28:16 - I wonder if there's an easy way for me
28:18 - to pull that up on screen but and Dan
28:27 - man asks are you going to make videos
28:29 - about our making our personal teachable
28:31 - machine framework ah okay we will let me
28:33 - cover this and then some people are
28:34 - asking about whether the teacher low
28:35 - machine sorry this was not a call to ask
28:37 - people to give super chats I apologize I
28:40 - didn't I was not really my intention
28:42 - thank you very generous of you and it's
28:45 - very much appreciated and I thought I
28:48 - had a little overlay they thought people
28:49 - thumbs up for their messages but
28:51 - apparently that didn't work so I forgot
28:56 - about the questions let me this o it so
29:00 - many good questions I'm trying to try to
29:03 - try to answer these
29:04 - okay I'm gonna I'm gonna actually scroll
29:06 - the chat which will stop it
29:07 - automatically scrolling okay are you
29:10 - going to make videos about making our
29:11 - personal teachable machine framework so
29:16 - so I actually have well look at all what
29:24 - an interesting that this pops up this
29:28 - weird what I'm looking for is the
29:32 - YouTube playlist but it's kind of
29:34 - interesting I guess from the ML this
29:40 - this is what this is the link I'm
29:41 - looking for us apologies oh I want the
29:44 - playlist though oh the Internet is a
29:50 - rough place why don't I have this
29:56 - playlist linked in an obvious place
29:58 - let's try with the chances on like one
30:03 - of these probably not
30:07 - website working on the website
30:11 - [Music]
30:15 - ah an issue to github so I can pull up
30:18 - thank you that's an excellent way of
30:19 - doing this I have a lot of content but I
30:22 - guess I have to go do I have to do what
30:24 - I didn't want to do which is actually
30:27 - just go to my channel how are there 447
30:31 - people watching this right now and look
30:34 - for playlists oh my god you know it's
30:42 - bad when I can't even look at this
30:44 - private liked videos mmm I want that to
30:47 - show up I'm naughty I need anything else
30:48 - oh I'm logged into my like main account
30:50 - it's not my intention oh oh god this is
30:55 - this is not going well
30:58 - created playlists what I'm looking for
31:02 - is it's gonna happen for me
31:17 - the question was are you going to make
31:19 - videos about making our own personal
31:21 - teachable oisin framework if you want to
31:23 - do that you can do that with the
31:27 - discussion in my ml 5 video about
31:30 - transfer learning with the feature
31:31 - extractor and then running your own
31:33 - feature extractor classification example
31:35 - this is basically a bit more that's that
31:39 - in terms of the tactical material that
31:42 - you would need to actually create the
31:45 - training interface and control the
31:47 - training process yourself more closely
31:50 - so sorry that took me a long time to
31:52 - pull that up and what I want to do today
31:54 - is actually add make content to go
31:58 - through a bunch of examples in this live
31:59 - session that will get edited it down
32:01 - into videos that will end up in this
32:03 - playlist about training a neural network
32:05 - model all right so the other questions
32:09 - were the teachable machine experts are
32:11 - currently broken is that being looked
32:12 - into I don't know I do know that there
32:15 - is a sort a little bit of a source of
32:17 - confusion a bunch of people posted that
32:19 - they had an error like a fetch error and
32:22 - maybe I can just touch on that really
32:26 - briefly
32:28 - so if I were let's just pretend for a
32:32 - second that I just trained a model and I
32:34 - went here to export model there's no
32:39 - model train so you're going to get once
32:41 - you've gone through this whole process
32:42 - you're going to get a URL that's here
32:45 - and then you're going to see here you're
32:48 - also going to see a code snippet what's
32:50 - confusing is the URL that teachable
32:54 - machine gives you does not include it's
32:56 - just the path to the all the model file
32:59 - excuse me but it does not include model
33:03 - JSON which ml5 expects so if you were
33:07 - copying and pasting yeah thanks thanks I
33:10 - can I can tell if you're copying and
33:13 - pasting this code the URL that you have
33:15 - for the model that gets stored in a
33:17 - variable and then you have to append
33:19 - modeled up JSON for it I was seeing
33:20 - people have that error there is a
33:27 - YouTube problem with emotes on streams
33:29 - spamming like 10 emotes can get your
33:31 - Google account suspended alright so
33:36 - those were some questions that I wanted
33:37 - to answer I think I better get started
33:38 - with some content it's already 11
33:40 - o'clock and I'm going to do my sponsor
33:44 - segment at around 10:30 11:30 you know
33:46 - travel back in time so someone keep me
33:50 - on track here and I think this is gonna
33:54 - go until 12:00 or 12:30 I mean at this
33:57 - point most likely 12:30 okay how's that
34:01 - let me see how my oh and let's go to the
34:06 - let's since I asked for it let's pull up
34:12 - what github.com slash website what is
34:15 - wrong with me coding train slash web
34:20 - site issues and to-do list okay oh wow
34:30 - let's just take it let's do a little
34:32 - accounting here uh RDP done Mauro's done
34:39 - colas conjecture
34:43 - tick tock nope nope none of these none
34:46 - of these done we could add by the way
34:48 - team trees edited version I don't know
34:52 - if it makes sense to edit that into
34:53 - something that's sort of a discussion
34:54 - avid Mattia ah so this is what I'm going
34:58 - to do today
34:58 - excellent I sort of did this I sort of
35:02 - did this but I chain of drew making the
35:05 - video tutorial we discovered a lot of
35:06 - problems with library to change so I
35:08 - need to redo this tutorial I did this I
35:11 - haven't done any of these I'm done any
35:13 - of these hoc tober festers over
35:15 - streaming improvements nightbot it says
35:19 - Nike bot this should say nightbot I
35:20 - believe discord and then 2020 so this is
35:24 - stuff for 2020 okay all right so this is
35:28 - good I'm not doing terribly the latent
35:30 - space stuff I'm really excited to do
35:32 - with runway ml so I have some plans for
35:34 - that this I definitely want to do this
35:37 - is a collaboration with a youtube
35:39 - channel called practical engineering so
35:41 - I need to get back to practical
35:42 - engineering about that and today's topic
35:45 - will be this I don't think there'll be a
35:46 - coding challenge today I'm looking at
35:48 - this but today I think today this is
35:57 - today ml 5 neural network ok so let me
36:05 - let's see how my the charge is going
36:08 - with this
36:17 - 6% boy that really didn't do very good I
36:20 - guess I could try to get it keep it
36:21 - plugged in I have anything that this
36:35 - could connect to not really there's no
36:44 - plug
36:48 - [Music]
36:55 - [Music]
37:03 - [Music]
37:34 - [Music]
37:40 - [Music]
37:52 - [Music]
37:53 - just looking at my notes from my class
37:57 - Singh where
38:00 - [Music]
38:07 - okay I think I'm gonna do this stuff so
38:15 - in case you're wondering what I'm
38:17 - looking at I'm teaching a course at NYU
38:20 - this semester called introduction to
38:23 - machine learning for the arts and I've
38:25 - been preparing a lot of material and
38:27 - doing a lot of teaching in the course
38:29 - about it I haven't been able to keep up
38:30 - my plan was to be making the videos for
38:34 - the course all semester long and yeah
38:36 - and to some extent I've been doing that
38:37 - but I got way behind so I'm kind of
38:39 - going back to remind myself what I did
38:41 - in class and sort of deciding how to how
38:45 - that is going to feed into what I want
38:48 - to show in this particular set of videos
38:52 - and so I think I think I'm ready to go
38:57 - and the other thing I want to do well
39:00 - I've up one upgrade I've made to my
39:02 - recording a system is that I have a way
39:13 - and I'm about to turn this on of
39:15 - recording all the different feeds to
39:18 - disk separately green-screen
39:20 - the laptop screen and the whiteboard and
39:23 - so this if I'm going to edit if when I
39:26 - say I
39:26 - if matsya who does the is the video
39:29 - editor for the coding train is going to
39:30 - edit all this stuff together it's
39:33 - actually really helpful to have all
39:34 - these separate things in case we want to
39:36 - like add some more content and fix them
39:38 - things up okay so I'm just looking in
39:40 - this set that so I should so I need to
39:42 - record output shoot sorry give me a
39:48 - second here apologies to everyone that
39:50 - I'm doing this during the stream but
39:52 - okay so output two is the whiteboard
40:00 - output three is the green screen output
40:03 - 4 is the laptop and so if I go to my
40:06 - multi quarter and I say I want two three
40:09 - and four
40:12 - now I'm gonna start recording and I'm
40:17 - recording everything okay all right so
40:27 - I'm trying to think of how I want to go
40:29 - about this as the nice thing vote so
40:33 - this is good and bad the good news is I
40:36 - have more possibilities for creating
40:39 - higher-quality edited versions of the
40:42 - livestream later because I now have the
40:46 - capability to even if I'm showing you
40:48 - things and talking about stuff during
40:49 - the livestream I can replace the
40:51 - background with different content or
40:55 - more zoomed in and highlighted content
40:57 - or even like other animations and other
40:59 - things so I could mention something not
41:01 - even show it and then show it later so
41:03 - that's the good news the bad news for
41:04 - you is that I don't want to fall in the
41:06 - trap of then just not ever showing
41:07 - anything in the live stream and I don't
41:10 - want to also make the process of editing
41:12 - and putting together the videos so
41:13 - onerous that it becomes so slow I'm also
41:15 - like getting a lot of feedback from my
41:17 - monitor so let me just mute this okay
41:20 - great okay so what I'm going to talk
41:30 - about today is and the ml5 neural
41:35 - network class
41:47 - hello and welcome to another beginner's
41:49 - guide to machine learning with ml5 jazz
41:52 - video in this video I am going to look
41:56 - at a piece of functionality in the ml 5
41:58 - library called it just heard a weird
42:01 - noise outside the room I also hate that
42:04 - this light reflects in my glasses I hear
42:07 - by the way I don't have any buddies from
42:08 - the film industry but I hear that often
42:12 - actors or performers in films will get
42:15 - these special non-reflective like lenses
42:17 - glasses because this is a common issue
42:20 - obviously if I had the lights above me
42:22 - or something
42:23 - that could also get around this issue or
42:25 - but so is that a thing cuz I'll go and
42:28 - buy those you could go get new I need
42:30 - new glasses anyway I need a new
42:31 - prescription Oh
42:37 - spectral piano is off I suppose ok
42:40 - whirly noise I really want to do that
42:41 - whirling noise stuff also should add to
42:44 - this list the not tomorrow's the other
42:50 - the star roads maybe okay hello and
42:57 - welcome to another beginner's guide to
42:58 - machine learning video tutorial with ml
43:01 - 5 yes very excited about this one
43:03 - typically excited about the video just
43:05 - like me but this one I'm particularly
43:07 - excited about because I'm gonna look at
43:09 - something that has recently arrived in
43:11 - the ml 5 jazz library so first of all
43:13 - used version zero point four point two
43:15 - or more recent version perhaps but
43:17 - that's the version I'll be using in this
43:18 - video and I'm gonna look at this
43:20 - functionality in the ml 5 library called
43:22 - ml 5 neural network it is a function in
43:26 - ml 5 that creates a empty or blank so to
43:30 - speak neural network most everything
43:32 - that I've showed you in this video
43:34 - series so far has involved loading a
43:37 - pre-trained model so a neural network
43:39 - architecture that's already been trained
43:42 - with some data and in this video I want
43:45 - to look at making an empty a blank slate
43:48 - configure your neural network collecting
43:51 - data training the model and doing
43:54 - inference
43:55 - and the context that I want to look at
43:57 - that is with real-time interactive data
44:00 - so I'm going to come back and maybe use
44:01 - some more traditional data sets there's
44:04 - a data set that I that that's on the ml5
44:06 - examples with the Titanic survival data
44:08 - set I have the data set for my color
44:10 - classifier series so I'll come back and
44:13 - show you some examples of those as well
44:15 - but in this first video I just want to
44:17 - do something very generic which is
44:19 - create a blank neural network use mouse
44:22 - clicks to Train it and then then move
44:26 - the mouse around for it to make guesses
44:28 - or predictions and that might sound like
44:29 - a weird thing to do and hopefully it'll
44:31 - start to make sense as I build the code
44:34 - and step through all the processes
44:36 - alright so that was my beginning opening
44:38 - discussion I did exactly what I thought
44:40 - is sort of a problem which is that I
44:41 - didn't show you anything like I didn't
44:43 - like clicking browse around the website
44:45 - and find the stuff but I do want to add
44:46 - that in later we'll see how that works
44:49 - all right I do see that there is a
44:54 - suggestion about the audio context in
44:56 - JavaScript it won't be happening today I
44:58 - appreciate everyone's enthusiasm and
45:00 - wanting to have their idea shown or
45:02 - talked about but I'm on a particular
45:04 - path and I'm just doing the topic that
45:05 - I'm doing in the absolutely
45:07 - computational geometry is on my list
45:10 - anti-reflective coatings applied on
45:13 - their glasses I thought I had that but I
45:15 - will get it I'm gonna go get new glasses
45:17 - it's another thing for my upgrading
45:20 - light how bad is the reflection right
45:21 - now cuz there is a way that I can turn
45:23 - the light away for me and if you've
45:25 - walked the teachable machine series the
45:28 - third video has the light turned away
45:31 - from me and it doesn't reflect but then
45:32 - I also have this weird shadow on my face
45:34 - I don't know all right so I'm gonna go
45:41 - to this page ooh
45:45 - so this shouldn't say come currently in
45:47 - development cuz it's definitely here I'm
45:49 - just gonna sort of scroll it down oh I
45:57 - was gonna I want to talk about Rebecca
45:58 - fie brink and wek inator so let me talk
46:07 - about that
46:07 - [Music]
46:12 - and
46:14 - [Music]
46:38 - all right the reflection doesn't bother
46:42 - at all okay so I also want to highlight
46:54 - for you the weka Nader project which is
46:56 - a free open-source piece of software
46:58 - created by Rebecca free break in 2009
47:00 - for training machine learning models and
47:03 - I would especially encourage you to
47:06 - watch
47:07 - Rebecca free Brinks talk from the IO
47:09 - conference in 2018 where she talks about
47:12 - creativity and inclusion in machine
47:14 - learning and goes through some
47:15 - demonstrations of with Weka Nader and
47:18 - processing and other pieces of software
47:20 - so a lot of the work that I'm doing with
47:22 - ml 5 is is entirely based on recreations
47:28 - of many of the example demonstrations
47:31 - that Rebecca fie brink made and has done
47:34 - research about for years and years with
47:36 - the Weka Nader project so in fact the
47:38 - examples that I'm going to make in this
47:40 - video and the next one and the next
47:41 - follow-ups are direct ports in a way of
47:44 - some of the original Weka Nader and
47:45 - processing examples but I'm gonna do it
47:48 - all in javascript in the browser with p5
47:50 - and the ML 5gs library think what I'll
48:00 - say also is
48:02 - [Music]
48:09 - and there's also a fairly lengthy
48:17 - history of creative artists using
48:19 - real-time training machine learning
48:21 - models in real time please let me say
48:24 - that again there's also a long there's
48:33 - also a fairly lengthy history of
48:35 - creative artists training machine
48:38 - learning models in real time to control
48:40 - musical instruments of performance a
48:43 - visual art piece and I would encourage
48:45 - you to check out some of these projects
48:47 - Martlet by michelle and a guy from the
48:49 - water spy and hedge this is not a
48:51 - faraman by guillermo Montesinos in sofia
48:54 - Suazo and the AI conductor by under a
48:56 - stress card that I will link to in this
48:58 - video's description for inspiration and
49:00 - ideas okay so now though
49:25 - let's see here
49:36 - let me just quickly go to the getting
49:41 - started copy this I just want to get the
49:45 - library in the p5 Sketch
49:55 - okay there we go um and how am I on time
50:01 - 11:20 all right c'est la vie
50:07 - am I like I don't think this camera is
50:11 - particularly level but it's fine right
50:14 - you can oh let me check the focus at
50:15 - least how's this whiteboard shot can you
50:22 - see that how's the focus I can't tell if
50:25 - I should if I should I'm afraid to touch
50:26 - this camera it's very loosely mounted to
50:28 - the wall I can make it a little sharper
50:32 - I think that's better I think I just
50:37 - improved it okay I shouldn't well
50:40 - nevermind
50:54 - yes I'm going to definitely refer to my
50:56 - former explanations about neural
50:58 - networks in general thank you Peter
51:01 - okay our guide for figuring out how to
51:12 - write the code is going to be the ML v
51:14 - website and there's a page on the ML v
51:16 - website for the neural network function
51:19 - but before I start diving to the code
51:21 - let's take a minute to talk about what a
51:24 - neural network is now by no means am I
51:29 - going to be comprehensive about this at
51:30 - this moment in fact I'm going to give
51:32 - you a very zoomed out high-level
51:33 - overview and I would refer you to the
51:35 - three blue one brown video series what
51:37 - is a neural network which is one of the
51:39 - most excellent videos on the Internet to
51:41 - just quick to succinctly explain in
51:43 - great depth what a neural network is and
51:45 - I have gone through many different
51:48 - playlists I guess I should be doing this
51:51 - in front of the green screen case I want
51:53 - to show any of this stuff oh yeah just
51:56 - do it over here what you're gonna say
51:57 - this again now by no means am I going to
52:02 - give you a comprehensive explanation now
52:07 - by no means in this video am i going to
52:10 - do a comprehensive deep dive into what a
52:12 - neural network is and how to code one
52:14 - from scratch I will refer you to many
52:17 - other wonderful resources where you
52:19 - could do that deep dive starting with
52:20 - the three blue one brown video what is a
52:23 - neural network and some of the
52:24 - subsequent ones I have also have a 10 to
52:27 - 15 part video series where I build a
52:29 - neural network from scratch in
52:31 - JavaScript based on a particular book
52:33 - called make your own neural network that
52:35 - is in Python I have other videos where
52:38 - that our guides around machine learning
52:40 - concepts where I talk about different
52:41 - kinds of neural networks so I will link
52:44 - to all of those in this video's
52:45 - description but here I'm gonna use the
52:48 - white board over here just to give you a
52:50 - very zoomed out high-level overview of
52:53 - what I'm talking about so a machine
52:55 - learning system in the most basic sense
52:57 - involves inputs and outputs
53:04 - you know a classic example of a data
53:07 - science approach to machine learning
53:09 - might be we want to have some sort of
53:12 - machine learning model that can predict
53:16 - the price of a house based on some set
53:19 - of factors so it might be the inputs in
53:22 - this case might be the number of
53:23 - bedrooms and the the LAT latitude and
53:27 - longitude of where it is in the world
53:29 - and the number of square the square
53:31 - footage or square meters the size of
53:33 - that house those inputs would be fed
53:35 - into the machine learning model and the
53:37 - output would be a number a price on this
53:41 - by the way is called a regression which
53:44 - sounds like a sort of terrifying term
53:46 - and oh I have to be a PhD in statistics
53:50 - to understand regression but what I mean
53:52 - in this case a regression is the output
53:54 - is some continuous number it's a price
54:00 - it could be zero it could be a hundred
54:02 - it could be it
54:02 - 1.5 million it's some number which is
54:05 - different than the output being a
54:07 - classification meaning it is a one of
54:13 - several categories it's a cat or a dog
54:16 - or a turtle or its Class A or Class B or
54:20 - Class C so if you've watched my recent
54:23 - teachable machine video series about
54:25 - training an image classifier a sound
54:27 - classifier all of those examples are
54:29 - classification outputs the output that
54:32 - you get is a set of confidence scores
54:35 - and categories
54:44 - interestingly enough I started with this
54:47 - discussion saying I was going to give
54:49 - you a high-level overview of what a
54:50 - neural network is and I haven't even
54:52 - begun that because I started talking
54:54 - about a high-level overview of the
54:56 - machine learning pipeline the process
54:58 - and so in a way that's what this video
55:00 - is also about and the way that I think
55:03 - might be an effective is an an effective
55:08 - way that I might be able to demonstrate
55:09 - this to you is to kind is to find the
55:12 - most drop dead simple almost trivial
55:15 - scenario to show you all of those pieces
55:21 - let me
55:33 - yeah this is just the corner of the room
55:36 - for people who are asking why boy I
55:39 - something about the whiteboard today
55:41 - very hard to race
55:43 - I need a whiteboard cleaning system
55:57 - this barker is pretty bad also it's just
56:00 - this one's better yeah this one's better
56:16 - so I will get to talk you about what a
56:19 - neural network is but for the moment I'm
56:21 - actually going to like stick with the
56:23 - sort of full pipeline of a machine
56:25 - learning project should really start
56:29 - this whole thing over don't like my
56:31 - explanation but whatever let's just keep
56:43 - going all right I'm thinking I know
56:46 - exactly what I want to do but I'm just
56:48 - kind of confused about this roundabout
56:50 - way that I'm doing this so let's say for
56:59 - a moment that the goal that I have is to
57:03 - train a machine learning model to use my
57:08 - body as the input so maybe how I'm
57:10 - moving my arms and legs and head that
57:12 - will be the input and the output would
57:14 - be a musical instrument a note that's
57:16 - being played so I could somehow play
57:19 - different notes based on how I move my
57:21 - body this is this is a scenario that has
57:24 - been this is a scenario that Rebecca
57:28 - fibrin covers in great detail in her
57:31 - course about machine learning and Weka
57:33 - nader
57:34 - i forget what it's called machine
57:42 - learning for artists and musicians this
57:45 - is this is an area that's covered in
57:47 - great detail and Rebecca fie brings
57:48 - course machine learning for artists and
57:51 - creators what musicians know what that's
57:54 - called
57:58 - the worst artists and musicians yeah
58:07 - okay I know you can't see it but I'm
58:09 - recording it this is an area that's
58:13 - covered in great detail in Rebecca
58:15 - Phoebe brings course machine learning
58:17 - for artists and musicians
58:22 - a very simple one way that I might boil
58:30 - this idea down into its very simplest
58:33 - version is think about a 2d canvas and
58:36 - it's very convenient that I'm using p5
58:38 - because that's the thing that exists in
58:39 - p5.js I have a 2d canvas and what I'm
58:43 - going to do is I'm going to say there's
58:45 - a mouse in that canvas and the mouse is
58:48 - going to move around the canvas and
58:50 - based on where it is it will play a
58:51 - particular note now of course I could do
58:54 - this with if statements very easily and
58:56 - what what's the thing that the Kyle
59:00 - McDonald quote Kyle McDonald I think I
59:05 - actually put it in my syllabus somewhere
59:18 - it's in this talk weird intelligence
59:24 - interested in nice where some people
59:29 - have something this is a really good
59:35 - talk by the way great quote that I want
59:45 - to reference I guess I guess I missed it
60:09 - I'm not gonna find it I'm gonna give up
60:18 - okay where is that from shoot anybody
60:25 - know what I'm talking about
60:26 - cuz I would like to reference it let me
60:30 - give me one second to look for this Kyle
60:34 - McDonald what is machine learning
60:44 - and this is what I'm looking for in this
60:50 - medium article I really like this
60:54 - explanation
61:13 - I don't think I'm going to find us I'm
61:14 - just gonna have to say it my own words
61:16 - instead of quoting Kyle maybe it was
61:24 - actually might actually have been a
61:33 - discussion here
61:44 - hold on I know Kyle
61:56 - oh it's this one it's this talk maybe
62:08 - or not okay I give up sorry everybody
62:12 - so many things around the world to look
62:15 - at okay I give up I give up sorry I'm
62:19 - wasting way too much time go back to the
62:24 - if-statement thing now of course I could
62:32 - program this same idea with an
62:34 - if-statement but this is really what it
62:36 - means to work with machine learning
62:38 - instead of programming the rules
62:40 - explicitly into code what I'm going to
62:43 - do is give the code a whole bunch of
62:46 - examples and have it learn those rules
62:48 - so I want to demonstrate that process in
62:51 - a scenario where it's very obvious how
62:53 - it's working so that then we can build
62:55 - on that into much more complex scenarios
62:57 - where we're more sophisticated problems
63:01 - could be or I guess really I'm just
63:04 - saying we could build on that into much
63:06 - more complex scenarios okay so the steps
63:10 - are collect data to train model then
63:22 - three I guess we can call this
63:26 - prediction so we could that's also
63:29 - sometimes referred to as inference
63:30 - that's really when we're deploying the
63:32 - model we're making use of the model
63:39 - right here this is my representation of
63:42 - the model I'm totally not talking about
63:46 - what a neural network is
64:02 - so in this case if I want to start with
64:05 - a classification problem and I will show
64:07 - you demonstrations of classification and
64:08 - regression I'm going to have two inputs
64:13 - input 1 and input 2 often refer to as
64:17 - X's in a sort of machine learning
64:19 - context those inputs are going to go in
64:22 - to this machine learning model the
64:25 - output is going to be one of let's say
64:28 - three different categories so I'm going
64:31 - to have three outputs notes like a B
64:37 - well let's actually play a C major scale
64:44 - the worst eraser ever
64:55 - C D and E so two inputs and in this case
65:03 - three outputs
65:14 - a diagram is the weirdest-looking thing
65:16 - ever ate the way it looks it is 11:30
65:23 - says David okay I'm gonna get through
65:25 - I'm gonna get through this explanation
65:27 - then I'll take a short break before I
65:29 - start with the coding
65:47 - I feel like I'm not actually there's no
65:50 - reason for me to explain I'm so I'm
65:57 - really lost in like where I am in the
66:00 - world of like what people who will be
66:02 - coming to watch this will have seen
66:03 - before what makes sense to explain and
66:04 - not explain but I'm gonna just keep
66:07 - pushing forward okay
66:39 - my diagram looks a little bit weird so
66:42 - I'm gonna fix it up for a second
67:03 - this is like the craziest thing okay
67:21 - so I have two inputs input zero input
67:23 - one and three outputs C D or E
67:45 - now all this time I've just been putting
67:48 - the word the no now all this time I've
67:51 - just been putting the letters ml in here
67:53 - for machine learning or maybe referring
67:55 - to this as a model because in truth
67:57 - other things other kinds of algorithms
68:00 - other types of ideas beyond a neural
68:02 - network could slot in here but the ml 5
68:06 - generic blank machine learning model
68:09 - that you can train is a neural network 1
68:11 - so if I were to try to zoom into this
68:14 - for a moment what I would actually see
68:16 - is something that looks something like
68:20 - this
68:36 - right that was to accept well this is
68:47 - gonna be a really nice sped up moment
69:08 - a neural network is an interconnected
69:15 - set of nodes where that and at least a
69:18 - feed-forward multi-layered perceptron
69:20 - which is what this is is we're all is a
69:26 - network where all of the data flows in
69:28 - one direction the inputs come in here
69:31 - they get processed by well the inputs
69:33 - come the inputs come in here the inputs
69:38 - come in here and get fed into what's
69:40 - known as a hidden layer they get
69:43 - processed by something called an
69:45 - activation function and then they go out
69:48 - of the hidden layer into the output
69:50 - layer so this is really a two layer
69:52 - network it has inputs and then two
69:55 - layers a hidden layer and an output
69:56 - later and a hidden layer and an output
70:00 - layer and all of these connections have
70:02 - weights to them and they're like little
70:03 - dials that you can twist and turn to
70:06 - process the information in different
70:08 - ways
70:31 - this is my zoomed in diagram of really
70:36 - what's going on in here a neural network
70:38 - is a network of neurons
70:41 - multi-ball t-this is a technically this
70:45 - is a feed-forward multi-layer perceptron
70:47 - because the inputs which are represented
70:50 - right here get fed through these
70:53 - connections they're weighted connections
70:55 - and get added up all together and arrive
70:57 - in this layer which is known as the
70:59 - hidden layer and there can be multiple
71:02 - hidden layers and different kinds of
71:04 - hidden layers but that data is summed
71:06 - and processed through a mathematical
71:08 - function called an activation function
71:10 - and then fed out of the hidden layer and
71:12 - into the output layer and the output
71:16 - layer after all of the hidden outputs
71:18 - are summed and passed through an
71:20 - activation function we get a set of
71:22 - numbers out and those numbers might look
71:24 - like this
71:25 - point two point seven point one meaning
71:29 - there's a two percent likelihood that
71:31 - this was category C a 70 percent
71:33 - likelihood that this was category D and
71:35 - a 110 percent likelihood that this was
71:38 - category e so there's a lot more details
71:41 - of what's going on in here and I
71:43 - certainly once again would refer you to
71:44 - the various things that I'll link in
71:46 - this video's description but the idea is
71:48 - that but the idea is that a neural
71:54 - network is that process that is a neural
71:57 - network is a kind of machine learning
71:58 - model that can be trained all of these
72:01 - weights can be adjusted so that but the
72:06 - idea here is that a neural network the
72:09 - idea here is that a neural network is a
72:11 - machine learning model that can be
72:12 - trained it can be shown a lot of
72:14 - examples of inputs with their correct
72:17 - corresponding outputs and it can tune
72:19 - all of the weights of all these
72:21 - connections so that when it later gets
72:23 - new data it can make appropriate
72:25 - predictions this is everything that the
72:28 - ml5 library will take care of for you
72:31 - and for us we're going to really just be
72:33 - working with the inputs and the outputs
72:35 - collecting our training
72:37 - data training the model and predicting
72:39 - outputs thank you thank you all right
72:52 - finally she cut to the point messed up
72:57 - the percentage what did I say 2% and I
73:00 - say 2% a 20% chance of being a 20%
73:10 - chance of being category C a 70% chance
73:13 - of being category D or a 10% chance of
73:16 - being category E okay alright um thank
73:29 - you everybody for your patient
73:30 - I said 7% oh my god it's only getting
73:40 - worse
73:42 - [Music]
73:44 - okay
73:49 - [Music]
73:57 - just checking my phones 11:45 it's gotta
74:01 - move quicker here all right so I'm
74:06 - willing to take a minute or two to thank
74:10 - whoops hold on
74:12 - where are the sponsors of today's coding
74:14 - train come on and so I am going to start
74:30 - with - Lane so first of all if you go to
74:33 - - Lang comm slash coding train that is
74:36 - the link you'll want to use to check out
74:39 - - Lane so here's the thing if you are
74:43 - concerned at all about staying safe
74:45 - online one of the things you really want
74:48 - to have in your tool set is a password
74:50 - manager I could not possibly live
74:52 - without a password manager and in fact
74:55 - if I come back here to my screen right
74:58 - here and if I were to say you know if I
75:00 - were to log out of the web editor and
75:02 - just open it up and feel like I need to
75:05 - log back in as you'll see here I can log
75:08 - into my password manager - Lane which
75:11 - will then pull up my password for the
75:15 - web editor and get me logged in
75:16 - instantly so it's the kind of thing
75:17 - that's like a real pain on the internet
75:19 - is to memorize and keep track of all
75:21 - your passwords in a secure way and one
75:24 - of the ways you really wanted to wanted
75:27 - one of the things you really want to do
75:28 - is have a different randomly generated
75:30 - password for everything that you log
75:32 - into and it's really hard to do that
75:34 - without a password manager so the when
75:39 - when you create a - Lane account you get
75:40 - a single master password it's never
75:42 - transmitted over the internet not even
75:44 - two - Lane and not to their servers and
75:46 - when you generate a long and complex
75:48 - password for a new website in - Lane
75:50 - it's bundled up encrypted using your
75:52 - master password that only you know so um
75:55 - you can see here just a whole lot of
75:58 - quick demonstrations of like logging in
76:00 - there's generating a password
76:02 - one of the things I really also use that
76:05 - I find really super useful is just like
76:06 - having all of my like shipping
76:07 - information and credit card information
76:09 - driver's life Social Security numbers
76:11 - stuff all saved in this very secure
76:13 - method that I can just quickly have so
76:16 - if you want to try it out
76:20 - you can sign up for free for you get a
76:23 - free 30-day trial of dashlane premium at
76:27 - dashlane comm slash coding train and
76:30 - then also if you purchase the the
76:33 - premium account you'll get a discount
76:36 - from the through through the coding
76:38 - train as well so now in addition to a
76:41 - password manager one of the things that
76:43 - I need very very often is a web server
76:47 - and so a new service that I've been
76:51 - experimenting with and looking at is 'la
76:55 - node so whether you're working on a
76:58 - personal project are managing your
77:00 - enterprise's infrastructure I don't know
77:01 - if you'd I don't manage an enterprise's
77:03 - infrastructure maybe you to Lou node has
77:06 - the pricing support and scale you need
77:08 - to take your project to the next level
77:10 - they've got ten data centers world word
77:12 - worldwide and they're launching an 11th
77:15 - in Sydney Australia soon so here's the
77:18 - thing you as a member as a viewer of the
77:22 - coding train can get a lenôtre count
77:24 - with $20 in credit today by going to
77:28 - Linode comm slash coding train so you'll
77:32 - get access to asset native SSD storage a
77:35 - 40 gigabyte network and an
77:37 - industry-leading revamp cloud manager
77:40 - which is built on an open-source single
77:42 - page app Cloud Leno comm so you get root
77:45 - access to your server you're gonna see
77:47 - this right now this is the kind of thing
77:48 - so like I my Twitter bot series you
77:50 - could use Leno to like spin up your
77:52 - Twitter bot you could do all sorts of
77:55 - things
77:55 - it has 1-click installs for WordPress
77:57 - the lamp stack you can have a Minecraft
77:59 - game server all that kind of stuff so
78:01 - just to quickly show you if you go to a
78:06 - Leno
78:08 - coding train you'll get a nice welcome
78:12 - message for where the $20 credit for a
78:15 - news
78:15 - drivers from the coding train and you
78:18 - can give this service a try out and let
78:22 - me know how it goes I'd be very curious
78:24 - to hear the other thing I do want to
78:26 - mention that the node let me know is
78:28 - there also hiring so if you go to
78:30 - lynda.com slash careers if you're if
78:34 - you're a viewer of the coding train you
78:35 - probably have some of the skills that
78:37 - they're looking for in terms of their
78:39 - hiring as well so feel free to check out
78:42 - their careers apply for a job and tell
78:44 - them that the coding train sent you so
78:46 - I'm going to take just a couple minute
78:47 - break to get a drink of water and my
78:50 - iPad
78:51 - oh no we created went down so I don't
78:53 - have music to play and so I would
78:56 - encourage you to go if you have a few
78:57 - minutes to try signing up at - Lang comm
78:59 - slash coding train and Linode comm slash
79:03 - coding training both of those links are
79:04 - in this video's description with also a
79:07 - pin comment that has those links as well
79:09 - and I'll be right back to finish writing
79:11 - my code in about five minutes they don't
79:15 - have any music to play but I'm gonna
79:16 - mute my microphone so silence meditate
82:08 - okay I'm back I
82:10 - little break sorry for this silence in
82:13 - the break i am i i'm gonna charge this
82:17 - ipad up so that i can please have the
82:20 - music our very sound effects for later i
82:22 - can't put the charger it's so weird
82:24 - like how did a second of going oh there
82:27 - it is a longer cable really go a long
82:35 - way right about now but what can I do
82:38 - alright I'm still muted no no no okay
82:42 - yeah no I'm not muted anymore okay thank
82:45 - you
82:46 - it's jus alright so I've got a little
82:54 - time on a finish making this example I
82:56 - want to make two examples so we'll see
83:00 - how this goes
83:00 - alright
83:13 - I'm just looking at the documentation
83:15 - yeah okay
83:23 - ooh I like this okay okay
83:36 - this needs a semicolon all right I'm
83:54 - going to finally write some code in this
83:56 - particular tutorial now that I'm hey now
83:59 - that I've gotten through that
84:00 - explanation I'm here to write some code
84:02 - and all right oh let's take him in here
84:13 - Dan man asks and thank you coma Borachio
84:17 - and I I'm so sad that you're I I thought
84:20 - I set something up that if somebody does
84:22 - like a super chat message River will
84:23 - like appear as an overlay but I really
84:25 - do it right but Dan mass where can get
84:27 - one of these so guess what I it's taking
84:30 - me forever to do this and it's a very
84:32 - disappointing to me how long it's taking
84:33 - me to do this but it is happening I'm
84:35 - about to relaunch the members program on
84:38 - YouTube and make a bunch of changes and
84:40 - I will be laser etching custom coding
84:44 - training train whistles which I will be
84:47 - sending out to new members so anybody
84:51 - who's an existing member right now will
84:52 - get one I'm gonna send one to everyone
84:53 - whether you're joined a while ago look
84:55 - not everyone sorry anyone at the $10
84:57 - higher because it is kind of big it's
85:00 - going there's gonna be a significant
85:01 - expense with buying these not that
85:04 - significant about buying them laser
85:05 - etching them and shipping them so I
85:07 - haven't figured out all the level stuff
85:09 - but that is something that I will be
85:11 - sending out I have some new stickers I
85:14 - have like a member only exclusive it's
85:15 - not a thing I'm gonna sell it's gonna be
85:17 - an exclusive coding train laser-etched a
85:21 - train whistle I'm gonna learn how to use
85:23 - the laser printer by golly to do that
85:25 - all right
85:26 - I like how Bruno writes in the edited
85:29 - version I may be 50 seconds into the
85:30 - video I'm like an hour and a half into
85:32 - here okay that was Japanese yen yes all
85:37 - right so that's coming I mean I think
85:40 - that I'm gonna have that I would say in
85:42 - early 2020 Jan you mean that's my guess
85:47 - so anyway lots more launching a new
85:51 - store I've mentioned this before about
85:53 - huge thank you to standard TV which is a
85:56 - company that works with a lot of
86:00 - wonderful other YouTube channels and you
86:04 - can find all of the creator stores here
86:06 - and I'm hopefully going to be here soon
86:08 - they helped me with the sponsorships and
86:11 - they also have a service called nebula
86:14 - that you should definitely check out and
86:17 - there was something else about standard
86:18 - they don't want to say oh the these
86:21 - thumbnails which I am absolutely in love
86:24 - with were created by Simon who's a
86:26 - designer who works with standard TV so
86:30 - anyway right goodies for the patreon
86:32 - subs yet um so David's kick I don't want
86:35 - to I gotta get back to coding and stuff
86:36 - and I don't want to but my my plan I I
86:38 - know that you want to stay through
86:40 - patreon which is absolutely fine
86:42 - I'm not going to delete the patreon but
86:44 - all any goodies that our YouTube members
86:47 - the goodies will be the same for YouTube
86:50 - members or patreon subscribers but I
86:52 - there are a few things that YouTube will
86:54 - allow me to do in terms of member only
86:56 - stuff that if you're on patreon you
86:58 - won't be able to get access to but in
87:00 - terms of mailing something or any other
87:01 - rewards like invitation to slack or
87:03 - discord or whatever use that's and I did
87:05 - get github sponsorships unlocked so I
87:07 - might have I might make github
87:09 - sponsorships the preferred alternative
87:11 - to YouTube memberships if you don't want
87:13 - to if you don't want to but I'll be
87:17 - giving part of your funding money to
87:18 - Google which frankly you are if you sign
87:20 - up through YouTube membership they take
87:21 - quite a large percentage you know in my
87:24 - mind it's a reasonable percentage it's
87:25 - I'm getting getting a good service here
87:27 - but okay to the code how I got a login
87:37 - shoot here's my dashlane ad I'm logging
87:46 - in through dashlane which is logging me
87:47 - into the web editor and yeah I want to I
87:50 - want to leave this page okay
88:02 - I'm starting with a p5 okay now that
88:08 - I've gotten through that explanation I'm
88:09 - I really want to just write some code
88:11 - and show you how this all works so I'm
88:13 - starting with a p5 sketch that also is
88:15 - referencing the ml 5 library zero point
88:17 - four point two as of today but that's
88:21 - not the important part
88:22 - I want to go back to my JavaScript file
88:24 - and I have that here so what is the code
88:27 - that I want to write so I want to make a
88:30 - variable called model so I'm gonna call
88:32 - it you could call it neural network or
88:34 - machine learning classifier thingy I'm
88:36 - gonna call it model and my model is
88:41 - going to be a new ml 5 neural network so
88:45 - this is neural network as a function you
88:47 - can call in the ml 5 library that
88:49 - creates an empty version of what is
88:53 - right here and it's up to us to
88:55 - configure the inputs and the outputs so
88:59 - one thing and the way that you can do
89:01 - there's a variety of ways you can do
89:02 - that but I'm going to show you how to do
89:04 - that by creating a variable called
89:06 - options which is just a JavaScript
89:08 - object that has the configuration for
89:10 - the neural network and then the options
89:13 - gets passed in when you create the
89:15 - neural network so the things that I want
89:17 - to do is I want to give it a certain
89:19 - number of inputs in this case to a
89:22 - certain number of outputs in this case 3
89:25 - and then also I want to tell it what
89:28 - kind of task I want it to do
89:30 - a classification super chat from Martin
89:38 - W Thank You ma team trees says epic
89:46 - picks team trees super chat from I
89:48 - understand thank you I want those
89:51 - overlays off to figure that out for the
89:53 - next time incidentally if how do I know
90:02 - this is what I type in here if I go to
90:05 - whoops not processing if I go to the
90:10 - neural network documentation page on the
90:13 - ml 5 website all of this is
90:15 - documented here and probably what's most
90:17 - useful is right here to show you this is
90:20 - exactly what I've done the number of
90:22 - inputs the number of outputs and then oh
90:24 - it says type I thought this is task
90:27 - I think it's task just say type that's
90:35 - weird let me look at the examples I kind
90:38 - of think it should be task could be type
90:44 - [Music]
90:59 - tasks I think I'm pretty sure it's tasks
91:03 - I think that's a I think that's an error
91:08 - in the documentation as my memory is
91:12 - that it's tasks
91:26 - so I'm gonna leave it as that summers
91:40 - incidentally and I'll cover this in a
91:42 - future video if your data is something
91:46 - that's in a file you've already
91:47 - collected it maybe it's in a JSON file
91:49 - or a comma separated values file a CSV
91:52 - file you can actually load that file as
91:55 - part of what the neural network and it
91:58 - will use that file to train the neural
92:00 - network but I'll come back to that in a
92:02 - future example where I'll show you a
92:04 - scenario where that makes sense in this
92:06 - case there is no data yet I'm going to
92:07 - collect the data in my p5.js sketch
92:10 - itself in addition to another way that
92:17 - another way that I can also create the
92:19 - neural network is instead of just
92:22 - specifying there are two inputs and
92:24 - three outputs I can also give names to
92:27 - the inputs this isn't something that a
92:29 - neural network needs or even uses but
92:31 - it's a way that's very useful as a
92:33 - programmer creating the neural network
92:35 - for me to keep track of what's going on
92:37 - to name my inputs and name my outputs so
92:39 - that's actually the way that I want to
92:41 - do it in this particular example so I'm
92:46 - going to change the number of inputs to
92:49 - an array of names and the outputs what I
92:55 - say I'm going to do the note C D and E
93:06 - so this now is what it looks like
93:10 - with the inputs named I instead of
93:12 - saying - I'm gonna give an array with
93:15 - two strings in it instead of saying
93:16 - three I'm gonna give it an array with
93:18 - three strings in it so many super chats
93:25 - going on I will try to come back and
93:28 - thank them or I need a way of keeping
93:31 - track of them good job keep it up says
93:33 - Igor Thank You Igor and there was also
93:35 - one from I understand Thank You Nathan
93:39 - for being me Manuel super chat alright
93:49 - where are we now in terms of these steps
93:52 - we're in the collect data step I want to
93:56 - collect data
94:03 - to do that I'm going to make an array
94:05 - I'll call it a training data and every
94:20 - time I press the mouse I will collect a
94:23 - data point so I'm gonna create I'm gonna
94:26 - create a variable called a sample a
94:28 - sample meaning like one data record one
94:32 - instance one sort of slice of the data
94:34 - and it's going to have an x value which
94:37 - is going to be Mouse X a Y value oh wait
94:42 - a second this is not how it works is it
94:51 - how does this work if
95:04 - I guess I sail a ball I'm doing
95:07 - classification and you just call it
95:08 - label
95:22 - like when you're doing classification
95:24 - with oh no let me look at the
95:28 - documentation
95:37 - oh no that's how it works there unless I
95:48 - don't actually give it the number that's
95:53 - weird it's funny we went around in
95:56 - circles with this and I think I'm
95:59 - forgetting how it works
96:09 - because I did the examples that I made
96:11 - didn't use classification does it keep
96:14 - it figures out the number of labels
96:16 - doesn't make any sense
96:22 - hold on let me let me go to my examples
96:27 - from my class because I have this
96:30 - example and here yeah this is what this
96:41 - is the example that I'm intending to
96:42 - build
96:58 - I can't use the computer why is this not
97:04 - chained there we go
97:24 - so what I want to do is change this to
97:26 - okay pretty sure we added this support
97:29 - here sorry everybody
97:40 - figuring this out stuff is hard now
97:45 - getting started copy to clipboard okay
97:52 - sketch
98:04 - let's see what happens
98:16 - X is what I'm doing is
98:35 - this doesn't make any sense how this
98:37 - would work with classification
98:47 - can I just do this maybe if I just do
98:50 - this right oh I'm gonna try it like this
98:54 - and see oh no let me see if this works
99:08 - so I give it a bunch of A's change it to
99:11 - be give it a bunch of bees train hey bee
99:21 - oh so this is working so that's how it
99:26 - works you just give it the all right
99:29 - great
99:29 - so it works the way it's gonna work the
99:31 - way I want it to work fine I just had to
99:35 - understand what I was doing
99:46 - okay
100:02 - sample with an X that is Mouse x and a y
100:06 - that's Mouse Y then I also need a target
100:10 - a target is because I'm collecting
100:17 - training data I need to not just only
100:19 - collect the inputs and actually maybe
100:22 - actually mmm you know what I'm gonna I'm
100:33 - gonna change it like this actually let
100:35 - me call this inputs because this is
100:37 - really what I'm doing I'm collecting
100:39 - what the inputs should be for this
100:41 - training data so the inputs are X is
100:45 - Mouse X Y is Mouse Y and then the output
100:49 - I also need to have the output which is
100:51 - some particular note that should be
100:54 - associated with this x and y but I'm
100:56 - gonna actually call that a target
100:58 - because it's this is training data so in
101:01 - the end oh boy why did this go off oh
101:09 - dear this camera is so off
101:19 - in the end I want in the end I want the
101:26 - neural network to guess the note for me
101:28 - but I have to give it some examples of
101:30 - what I want so in this case let's just
101:34 - say it's going to be C and then I can
101:39 - add this data to the model so I'm gonna
101:42 - say model add data the inputs associated
101:46 - with this particular target then just so
101:52 - I can see what's going on I think I
101:55 - should save all of this training data
102:15 - I guess I don't need to save it I should
102:19 - just draw it here do you wanna
102:33 - that's the way that's going to make
102:35 - sense
102:46 - yeah
102:49 - oh I could do can I do that like object
102:51 - Street destructuring thing I want to
102:59 - save all the data so I'm going to use
103:01 - that array that I created earlier and
103:03 - say training data dot push and I'll make
103:06 - a new object that has the inputs and the
103:09 - target in it
103:22 - and then in the draw loop I can loop
103:25 - through everything
103:45 - and visualize the data onto the canvas
104:12 - drawing a circle and then also drawing
104:15 - the category for that and then also
104:19 - drawing the class associated with that
104:21 - circle inside the circle
104:50 - let's run this and see if it works great
104:55 - so as I click around we're seeing all
104:58 - these data points that all have an XY
105:00 - associated with them and a label
105:03 - associated with them in this case
105:04 - hard-coded as C input provided is not
105:11 - supporter does not match your output
105:13 - label specifications now I am getting an
105:16 - error here which says that input
105:17 - provided is not supported or does not
105:19 - match your output label specifications
105:22 - so I think I've made a mistake here let
105:24 - me see if I can figure out what that is
105:32 - do we say 1215
105:39 - [Music]
105:48 - in both outlets yeah
105:55 - where did I just like pulled up an
105:59 - example yeah this worked what's
106:12 - different
106:27 - is it really type and not tasks that we
106:32 - did a change to type no this is using oh
106:38 - yeah hold on
106:40 - duplicate let me see let me save this
106:51 - reference neural network no no no
106:57 - getting started copy this worked right
107:12 - and data
107:25 - oh I know what the problem is I know
107:29 - what the problem is and I know what the
107:32 - problem is the target has to be in an
107:37 - array because there can be multiple in
107:40 - many cases there's multiple outputs
107:50 - all right aha I have found the error of
107:57 - my ways very common mistake in this case
108:00 - my target is the string see the category
108:04 - see I want to play ultimately I want to
108:07 - hear the note see played but in many
108:11 - cases there could be multiple especially
108:14 - in a regression problem sorry in many
108:17 - cases and you'll see this in future
108:20 - examples that I'll demonstrate there
108:21 - could be multiple outputs whether it's
108:24 - multiple categories or multiple numbers
108:25 - there's lots of possibilities here
108:27 - and so just the the outputs themselves
108:32 - [Music]
108:34 - yeah it really should be there should be
108:36 - a different way of doing this need to be
108:38 - but this is the way it is right now the
108:40 - outputs themselves need to be in an
108:42 - array so I needed to put this bracket
108:45 - here a round target because I'm taking
108:48 - the category C and that individual class
108:53 - in an array with one thing in it is the
108:55 - actual target that I want to give to
108:57 - this particular model so let me run this
108:59 - again and see if that error goes away I
109:01 - don't see that error anymore now I need
109:04 - some method by which I select what the
109:09 - training label is and so I'm going to
109:12 - create a variable called target label
109:15 - set that equal to C I'm going to have a
109:21 - function called key pressed and I'm
109:23 - going to say training label equals the
109:27 - key that was pressed a console.log a
109:30 - training label so I'm going to just do a
109:32 - quick and dirty interface which is
109:34 - really no interface to have the label
109:36 - set by when I press the key and I'm not
109:39 - doing any error checking to make sure
109:41 - I'm just doing C D or e only but all
109:43 - that could come you could add that and
109:55 - and then the target should be that
109:58 - training label itself and let me run
110:01 - this now whoops
110:03 - training label sorry target label not
110:09 - training label CCC letting press D no
110:14 - that didn't work
110:15 - Oh
110:18 - training label it's called target label
110:29 - and let me just make sure it's uppercase
110:34 - to be consistent si si si si si si si si
110:52 - ddddd e so I now have collected my data
111:18 - what is the next step the next step is
111:22 - train the model and luckily for us this
111:27 - is a very easy step for us to accomplish
111:30 - simply by calling a function in the m l5
111:34 - neural network library called train and
111:40 - yes it is a train I'm going to add an
111:56 - extra function here that the next I'm
111:58 - going to check if the key happens to be
112:00 - pressed as T now I am going to call
112:13 - model train now when I train the model I
112:17 - also have some options that I can that I
112:21 - can specify and there are a variety of
112:25 - things and I could sort of come back and
112:27 - talk about some of these terms and how
112:29 - they affect the process maybe in one of
112:31 - my subsequent videos but for right now
112:33 - I'm going to just talk about one
112:35 - particular term and that term is epochs
112:39 - so I'm gonna say epochs 10 I'm gonna
112:43 - train it based on these options and I'll
112:45 - come back and say so what is he box so
112:51 - what is he pox look at this summit oh
112:55 - something's control how did that get in
112:58 - there oh because I'm like typing keys
113:03 - all the time and then I click the mouse
113:16 - I should validate it but whatever shoot
113:24 - I just want to
113:35 - CDE
113:36 - [Music]
113:48 - all of these data points are going to be
113:51 - fed into the model as part of the
113:53 - training process one at a time the
113:58 - inputs along with the target the inputs
114:01 - get fed in the model makes a guess if
114:03 - it's gotten it correct moves on to the
114:05 - next one it feeds the inputs in the
114:07 - model makes a guess if it's gotten it
114:09 - incorrect adjusts all of these dials all
114:12 - over the place these weights of the
114:14 - neural network towards the error to try
114:16 - to correct that error and then starts
114:18 - over again it's feeding in all the data
114:21 - one at a time so what is an epoch an
114:25 - epoch is one cycle through every single
114:29 - data point fed into the model so maybe
114:33 - there's 35 here if I have 10 epochs I'm
114:37 - feeding in all 35 data points and of
114:42 - course the camera is overheating it's
114:44 - really not that hot in here and this fan
114:47 - on move the air around a little bit nuts
114:52 - not the coding train if the cameras
114:54 - don't just shut off every once in a
114:57 - while
115:14 - so if there are 35 of XY target trios so
115:19 - to speak then and I do 10 a pox
115:23 - then it's doing all 35 of those 10 times
115:26 - or 350 training cycles through the
115:29 - neural network itself now interestingly
115:31 - enough and this is built into ml 5 it
115:34 - shuffles the order all of these randomly
115:37 - because I collected all the C's than all
115:40 - the DS and then all of the ease and the
115:42 - model wouldn't trained very well if it
115:44 - didn't do that but that's something
115:45 - that's built into ml 5 itself so I've
115:53 - set the epochs
116:00 - I've set I've set the epochs and now the
116:03 - train function and tell ya it's gonna
116:05 - take some time and actually has multiple
116:08 - callbacks associated with it then go to
116:12 - the page
116:31 - where does they send an error I guess
116:33 - who knows okay
116:46 - okay
116:56 - there's a while training callback and
117:00 - this is a function and event that's
117:02 - triggered this isn't a function and
117:06 - event that's triggered every at the end
117:09 - of every epoch and then there's a
117:11 - finished training callback and this is
117:14 - triggered just once when the training
117:22 - process is complete let me write those
117:24 - functions while training finished
117:37 - training in finish training I'm just
117:40 - gonna add a console log
117:49 - and the wild training callback will be
117:51 - sent two arguments one argument is what
117:55 - epoch are we on and the other argument
117:57 - is a value called loss now ultimately I
118:01 - only need the while training callback if
118:03 - I want to sort of debug what's happening
118:05 - during the training process so for
118:08 - actually for a moment I'm just gonna
118:10 - console.log the epoch and I'm also going
118:14 - to add another property up here in the
118:17 - original options which I'm going to set
118:19 - as debug true because often when you're
118:25 - training a machine learning model you
118:27 - want to see a visualization of the
118:29 - training process and how it's going and
118:31 - there is a particular library called TF
118:34 - viz so ml 5 is built on top of
118:36 - tensorflow Jas and there is a
118:38 - visualization library associated with
118:40 - tensorflow Jas that will draw graphs and
118:43 - different things about the training
118:44 - process so setting debug to true will
118:47 - make that happen automatically and I'll
118:48 - show you exactly what I mean in a moment
119:02 - it's possible that I forgotten something
119:04 - but I think I have all the pieces here I
119:06 - have my options which I want to train
119:08 - over 10 a pox I have a wild training
119:10 - callback where I could just see every
119:12 - Bock well epoch one at a time in the
119:15 - console and it'll tell me when I'm done
119:17 - and I've turned debug on so I should see
119:19 - a visualization so let me move my screen
119:21 - around so that I can see all this stuff
119:27 - collect my data
119:45 - and now for the moment of truth I'm
119:47 - gonna press the T key and as soon as I
119:50 - press that the training process should
119:52 - start I should see the epochs being
119:54 - logged here and a visualization over
119:55 - there let's see what happens oh oh I
120:07 - forgot some steps I forgot some steps
120:22 - I thought this would work anyway
120:37 - I thought we fixed it so that it would
120:40 - work just like finished immediately so
120:53 - there is there's an important function
120:58 - which I was going to demonstrate
121:12 - okay yeah it's supposed to work without
121:15 - this I don't know why it didn't that's
121:29 - annoying I thought it works without this
121:36 - let me see here is there if I don't want
121:43 - to normalize the data is there like yeah
121:49 - that's weird
121:52 - so it's supposed to work
121:56 - 12:30 oi
122:21 - yeah weird so we had fixed it I thought
122:26 - so that you don't I was going to talk
122:27 - about how normalizing is an important
122:29 - thing but I guess I'll just
122:35 - [Music]
122:40 - hmm that's weird because I I remember
122:43 - going through the source and we added
122:44 - something that if you don't normalize it
122:46 - it will finish preparing the data but
122:50 - all right
123:04 - unfortunately I missed an important step
123:06 - and I meant to talk about this
123:07 - afterwards but I think I need to talk
123:09 - about it now so one of the things that's
123:12 - very typical of working with a machine
123:14 - learning model in particular neural
123:16 - network in particular a neural network
123:19 - based machine learning model one of the
123:23 - things that's very important about
123:25 - working with a machine learning model in
123:26 - particular a neural network based
123:28 - machine learning model is the fact that
123:31 - data should be normalized before it's
123:34 - fed in as inputs into the system and
123:37 - what do I mean by normalized what I mean
123:39 - by normalize is take any arbitrary data
123:42 - look and squish it or squash it or
123:45 - standardize it for all the values to fit
123:48 - between some well-defined range so in
123:51 - this case if I have this canvas and
123:54 - everything in the canvas is an XY point
123:58 - oh you can't see that in this case if I
124:09 - have a canvas and everything is an x and
124:12 - y point in the canvas I'm getting values
124:15 - like 100 pixels by 100 pixels but I want
124:18 - to normalize those pixel values into a
124:20 - number between 0 and 1 so if the width
124:23 - is 400 of the canvas all I need to do is
124:26 - divide by 400 but ml5 has a utility in
124:30 - it that will normalize the data for you
124:32 - we'll just look at it examine it find
124:34 - the minimum the maximum and squish
124:35 - everything down to a value between 0 and
124:37 - 1 and to do that all I need to do is add
124:44 - one more line of code right when I'm
124:46 - finished collecting the data are right
124:47 - before I'm out to train the model and
124:48 - say model dot normalized data let's give
124:57 - this a try again I'm gonna collect data
125:14 - now I'm really going to train the model
125:21 - and it's totally not working what have I
125:26 - done wrong here all right
125:40 - this is a fail
125:58 - this would have been much easier if I
125:59 - hadn't bothered this would have been a
126:07 - better way to demonstrate it I guess
126:09 - this should work no wait
126:33 - target label is this
126:43 - what's going on
126:50 - inputs to outputs three classification
126:55 - debug oh the way I'm drawing it is
127:04 - different
127:09 - [Music]
127:48 - why is everything always so hard well
127:56 - that's promising
127:59 - is it just like okay that's good I am 10
128:05 - epochs is not enough
128:39 - should get like a really really low loss
129:17 - let's try this example basically the
129:21 - same example
129:49 - I really need to I mean I wanted to
129:52 - demonstrate how I could save and just
129:53 - reload the data so I don't have to do
129:55 - this each time because it's kind of
129:57 - ridiculous what I'm doing here why is
130:00 - this like not
130:09 - yeah this is what I expected to see
130:17 - so this is working a hundred epochs
130:29 - why did I mess up
130:38 - X Mouse X mouse Y XY
130:57 - semicolon line 18 I don't think that's
131:00 - the problem all right let's see here
131:25 - try to make this very distinct how many
131:29 - epochs did I put in there 100
131:41 - a lot more data you really should be
131:44 - able to do this with very little data
131:47 - especially with a lot of epochs
131:57 - here we go okay there we go
132:01 - so amazingly it just need it's just so
132:09 - little data I guess it needs a lot of
132:10 - epochs and I should have gave me an even
132:18 - more cuz it's just so little data
132:27 - [Music]
132:31 - although I guess I could probably mess
132:34 - with the learning rate I think it's
132:38 - called learning rate I'm just curious
132:39 - maybe I'm point to five these are the
132:48 - defaults but as soon as I do
132:49 - classification No
132:58 - just curious hold on let me save the I'm
133:04 - gonna actually save the data well you
133:11 - know what I'm actually just gonna I'm
133:13 - gonna leave it
133:29 - let me try this again with many many
133:32 - more epochs I'm realizing it's just very
133:34 - very little data so in order to make it
133:36 - seem like it's a lot more data I can
133:37 - just increase the number of epochs and
133:39 - I'm gonna collect some data yet again
133:42 - I'm gonna show you how you can save the
133:43 - data to reload it so you don't have to
133:45 - keep collecting it over and over again
133:46 - if you're trying to debug your model
133:47 - very important thing but I'm just gonna
133:49 - collect it again
134:23 - press train
134:38 - and very good so what I'm seeing is
134:44 - exactly one of what I want to see I want
134:47 - to see this graph of a line that's going
134:49 - down and down and down and down and down
134:52 - as low as it can go done and and we can
135:08 - see here in the console these are all
135:10 - the epochs it got up to epoch 199 and
135:13 - then said done so what is it graphing
135:16 - over there
135:38 - Oh scammer has gone off
135:53 - it's graphing a very particular it's
135:57 - graphing a very important property
135:59 - that's part of its graphing something
136:06 - called loss now we could actually look
136:09 - you might recall at we could actually
136:12 - look we could actually look right here
136:20 - in the wild training function at the
136:23 - actual loss value itself what the loss
136:28 - is I like lost my I think once I get to
136:34 - hours day and I like lose my ability to
136:35 - do this let me start this whole lost
136:39 - explanation in thank you Simon that's
136:43 - gonna be useful in a moment if I could
136:44 - ever get to it it's the graph is of the
136:53 - loss loss is a particular value a
136:56 - measure a metric of the training process
136:59 - it's a summation of how many mistakes
137:01 - it's making as those trained as the
137:05 - training data is fed through the neural
137:06 - network so we're again remember the
137:08 - training process is take a particular
137:10 - data point feed it through the network
137:12 - it's going to make a guess
137:14 - compare the guess to the correct answer
137:15 - if it's the correct answer guess what
137:18 - the loss is zero the error is zero if
137:20 - it's not it's going to be far or close
137:22 - to that error and by accumulating all of
137:27 - the errors over one Epoque that value is
137:30 - summarized in loss so as we can see as
137:32 - it's training over time the loss starts
137:36 - up at like a value of one point one and
137:38 - it gets in actually we can see here in
137:40 - the graph at the very end we were down
137:42 - to a loss of zero point zero seven
137:45 - thirty four to six which is a pretty
137:46 - good loss anytime you see a value lower
137:49 - than 0.1 in these kinds of scenarios
137:50 - it's doing particularly well and you
137:53 - could see the graph is starting to level
137:55 - off maybe I could have eat out a little
137:57 - bit lower loss by giving it more epochs
138:00 - but most likely that was good enough
138:05 - okay
138:19 - whoops
138:29 - finally in this rather lengthy tutorial
138:32 - video we are ready for the last stage
138:34 - prediction I have trained the model and
138:38 - now it's time for me to give it new data
138:41 - new XY coordinates and have it guess a
138:45 - music a note CDR e based on that
138:48 - coordinate and you may have noticed that
138:51 - as I was trading the model the data that
138:54 - I was giving it happened to be very
138:56 - distinct I wanted to learn that when my
138:59 - mouse is over in this corner play the
139:00 - notes see when my mouse is in that
139:02 - corner played D and towards the bottom
139:04 - play E but if I were to experiment with
139:06 - this a lot it would be very interesting
139:08 - to train the model with a variety of a
139:14 - variety of distributions of how I
139:16 - collect this training dataset
139:31 - one thing I want to do here an important
139:37 - feature to this example that I think I
139:38 - want to add now is having a sort of
139:41 - state so what is the state and I'm going
139:43 - to say the state at the beginning is
139:46 - collection and so in this case that's
139:57 - going to affect what happens you're
140:02 - distracting me with your sharing of
140:03 - YouTube videos in the slack channel I'm
140:09 - gonna use that state to determine what
140:12 - should happen in the mousepressed
140:14 - function so if the state is collection
140:27 - if the state is collection and training
140:30 - data otherwise if the state is
140:35 - prediction make a guess so I need to add
140:44 - the code for making a guess in a moment
140:46 - but let's figure out how I'm going to
140:48 - sort of track this state over the course
140:50 - of the program and I look forward to all
140:52 - of you who changed this to do a switch
140:54 - statement and show that with me at the
140:55 - competence so as soon as I press the key
141:01 - T the state should be training and then
141:09 - once I'm finished training the state
141:12 - should be prediction
141:30 - at the prediction stage I want to do the
141:34 - same thing I want to take the inputs and
141:37 - send them into the neural network but
141:39 - this time I'm not giving in a target
141:41 - there is no target I just want the
141:43 - neural networks prediction or guess and
141:45 - in this case because it's a
141:46 - classification problem I want its
141:49 - classification I want you and in this
141:58 - case because it's a classification
141:59 - problem so prediction is the label I'm
142:04 - gonna say model dot and in this case
142:09 - because it's a classification problem my
142:11 - prediction is actually classify I'm
142:13 - asking the model to classify so I'm
142:15 - going to say classify these inputs send
142:19 - those inputs into the model and when
142:22 - you're finished give me a result back in
142:26 - a callback so write the got results
142:32 - function the got result function can
142:39 - take multiple arguments error or results
142:44 - if there's an error do nothing
142:58 - otherwise right now let me just take a
143:01 - look at the results
143:14 - this is really nuts that I've got to
143:16 - collect the data every time I do it I'm
143:18 - definitely gonna have to find a way
143:19 - around that which I have one I will
143:21 - demonstrate that soon but I'm just going
143:23 - to collect it again
143:48 - training the model mm-hmm mom loss you
143:52 - can do it
144:10 - now we are ready
144:13 - oh it Hardy I already it's just
144:15 - registering all my mouse clicks so I
144:16 - should probably constrain it to only
144:19 - registering the mouse clicks on the
144:20 - canvas but I'm gonna click up here I'm
144:23 - in the trim in the prediction stage I'm
144:25 - gonna click in the top left and if I
144:26 - click on the top left around the cluster
144:28 - of the notes see I should see that the
144:31 - highest confidence score classification
144:34 - that gives me back is the category C
144:37 - click and it's this one here the second
144:41 - one object 0 look at this nice I'm so
144:45 - glad this worked 98% confidence that
144:49 - that click registers a label of C let me
144:53 - click over here 86 percent confidence
145:00 - the label e so the results that come
145:04 - back in the results variable in the gut
145:07 - result function R this is the same as
145:10 - every other nullify function that I've
145:12 - demonstrated to you an ordered list of
145:14 - the labels sorted by confidence score so
145:18 - there's only there's always three
145:19 - possibilities each with a confidence
145:21 - score and it's always going to put in
145:22 - the array the highest confidence first
145:34 - just I'm just Chad because I'm over time
145:36 - I'm checking my phone here okay no
145:42 - emergency messages this example is
145:53 - ultimately finished I mean there's been
145:56 - no thoughtfulness to the interface here
145:58 - or why it is you might want to make
146:00 - something like this this is really a bit
146:02 - of my hello world introduction to that
146:05 - neural network function in ml v itself
146:08 - however to make this feel at least like
146:11 - something that has some application to
146:14 - it I want to add the feature that
146:17 - whenever I'm creating the training data
146:19 - it plays the musical note as I click and
146:21 - then when it's in the prediction stage
146:23 - it once again plays its guess as a
146:26 - musical note when I click so I'm not
146:29 - going to I'm gonna sort I'm not going to
146:30 - show you all the details of how the this
146:33 - is coded here I'm going to go grab code
146:36 - from one of my examples that uses the p5
146:38 - sound library and an oscillator and the
146:41 - envelope class to play a musical note
146:44 - and then I'm gonna put that in this code
146:46 - and demonstrate it to you so if I go to
146:55 - let's see question is what's the chance
147:03 - that I could find this code the sound p5
147:07 - jazz sound envelope sound envelope this
147:11 - is what I want
147:20 - this is the code on github for my sound
147:23 - envelope tutorial so I'll link to that
147:26 - particular video if you want to watch it
147:28 - but I'm just gonna start grabbing this
147:29 - code and putting it in my ml 5 neural
147:33 - network example
148:39 - so where where's the mouse
148:54 - Oh ha ha I'm adding it to the wrong
148:56 - example I added it to the other example
149:00 - let me close this wrong example goofball
149:14 - it's like why does this look so
149:15 - different
149:54 - let me actually capture this sound
150:00 - [Music]
150:08 - now you're getting the sound I think I
150:16 - want this this doesn't really sound what
150:18 - is it attack decay sustain just you I
150:37 - don't know I wanted to sound more like a
150:44 - piano notes somebody could give me some
150:46 - set range 1.2 to zero what does that do
150:54 - whatever someone could give me some
150:56 - better numbers to put in here but now I
151:00 - want C D or E so I need to get those
151:04 - frequencies
151:40 - yeah that's a good idea Simon I will do
151:42 - that also
152:00 - I'm waiting for like some good ASD our
152:03 - Valley is to do the next part on my
152:10 - other side okay I know I don't really
152:11 - need it to sound like a piano
152:13 - I just just sounds kind of like I want
152:33 - it to be a quick note this is what I
152:43 - want
152:47 - yes well that's the decay I guess I
153:10 - should just go back to whatever I had it
153:12 - for my example
153:29 - perfect alright this is not important to
153:37 - this tutorial so I'm just going to move
153:38 - on now that I've added an envelope and
153:46 - an oscillator I just call the play
153:48 - function every time I click the mouse
153:50 - and you can hear a note being played
153:56 - but I want to play a see a D or an e so
153:59 - I need to get the exact frequencies for
154:01 - those particular notes that I want to
154:03 - play I can grab them from this Wikipedia
154:08 - page for piano notes and I'll get middle
154:13 - C d4 and e4 I'm going to make an object
154:22 - that just has those values
155:00 - and so this is my lookup table based on
155:04 - whatever category it is I want to set
155:06 - the wave to that particular frequency
155:19 - so right before I play the envelope wave
155:22 - frequency frequencies based on the
155:27 - target let's see if this works
155:37 - [Music]
155:45 - and now it's playing CD or e based on
155:48 - when I click
156:07 - now I can pull the note which is the
156:16 - label associated with the first result
156:19 - since then sorted it's a sorted list and
156:22 - I can and I can set the frequency based
156:33 - on that note and play the envelope again
156:36 - and probably it would be good for me to
156:38 - also draw it but I'm gonna I'll leave
156:41 - that to you to make a much nicer
156:43 - interface for this and I'm just gonna
156:45 - finish this off by collecting the data
156:48 - one more time and then having it play
156:51 - the notes as I click around and this
156:53 - time maybe I'll give it a bit more of an
156:56 - odd this time maybe I will give it a bit
157:02 - more of a less obvious or for uniformly
157:05 - distinct spatial arrangement of the
157:09 - training data
157:16 - here we go training data time
157:18 - [Music]
157:46 - there's my data train the model I don't
157:58 - know if that control that got in there
157:59 - it's gonna break it we'll find out train
158:02 - the model
158:33 - we're started reading the chat now I
158:35 - just saw his read that don't over fit
158:37 - yeah and now let's see what happens
158:43 - wait huh
158:50 - Oh what did I forget
158:57 - do I have an error because of that weird
158:59 - Oh freak was not defined oh no oh no oh
159:04 - this was it all that work and I forgot
159:09 - the S there let me fix that and do it
159:13 - again Oh Oh p5 OOP OOP I didn't realize
159:21 - this but it's actually called I should
159:23 - call it p5 envelope not env
159:37 - [Music]
159:57 - [Music]
160:10 - train the model
160:36 - I finished training and now in theory it
160:40 - should do prediction
160:50 - we zoom in so you can see this a little
160:52 - better
160:58 - look it's even giving me a c-note here
161:00 - that's its best prediction based on all
161:02 - the C's up there
161:04 - be really interesting to visualize the
161:07 - the every sort of like what the value
161:10 - would be for every pixel that's
161:11 - something you should do as an exercise
161:13 - [Music]
161:21 - so imagine even though this is kind of
161:24 - an obvious and almost trivial scenario
161:26 - imagine if you were using your hands to
161:31 - and maybe you had a sari now this is an
161:36 - obvious and somewhat trivial scenario
161:38 - but imagine expanding on this imagine
161:40 - having many more notes imagine having
161:43 - the input to not just be a single mouse
161:45 - click but perhaps an XY of your tracking
161:48 - your hand maybe with the pose net
161:50 - feature of ML 5 maybe you're tracking
161:51 - two hands so actually training the model
161:54 - to learn based on four inputs your
161:56 - entire pose I'm gonna get to that so and
161:58 - then you have a lot more notes than just
162:01 - three you could imagine how you could
162:03 - expand this to start playing a musical
162:05 - instrument based on how you move your
162:07 - body and this is the sort of seeds of
162:09 - that idea in this very basic example
162:16 - there are a lot of missing pieces to
162:19 - this example and so the two things that
162:21 - I well it's really three things the
162:23 - things that I want to demonstrate and
162:24 - I'll do a follow-up video where I will
162:26 - add these features in is one I would
162:29 - really like to be able to a save the
162:31 - model I train so I could just load it
162:32 - back in and another sketch I want to go
162:34 - through training it again that's quite
162:36 - possible to do I also might want to just
162:38 - save the dataset like maybe I don't want
162:40 - to save the model but I want to save the
162:41 - data set because I want to try training
162:42 - it again but with slightly different
162:44 - parameters I don't really showed you
162:46 - what are the kinds of hyper parameters
162:48 - you can change for training the model
162:49 - but there are some so I want to show you
162:51 - saving the data saving the model and
162:53 - also what if I wanted to make this
162:55 - regression instead so right now it is
162:58 - always playing a very specific note only
163:02 - one of three possible notes but what if
163:05 - what I wanted to do when I clicked over
163:07 - here I wanted to hear an interpolation
163:10 - of what it sort of guess would be in
163:12 - this case kind of like somewhere between
163:13 - C and D probably I'm about halfway in
163:17 - between those clusters so how could what
163:20 - note would it play if it was returning
163:22 - an actual floating-point frequency value
163:25 - and this actually would be very easy for
163:27 - me to adjust this example mostly all I
163:30 - need to do is change this term from
163:31 - classification regression and then
163:33 - change the way I read the output
163:34 - it but I'm gonna still do that in a
163:37 - separate video follow-up that will come
163:39 - after this maybe try that on your own
163:40 - and then see what happens in the video
163:42 - that I it might not be released right
163:44 - now if you're the times you're watching
163:45 - this but hopefully it is alright thanks
163:47 - for watching and I'll see you in the
163:48 - next ml 5gs beginner's guide to machine
163:51 - learning video oh okay boy that took me
163:58 - all this time just a date-like make this
164:01 - one video tutorial
164:02 - I don't know I'm kidding this is this I
164:05 - don't know what that what what this sort
164:07 - of general audiences of you all of you
164:09 - according to my stream deck here 382 if
164:12 - you're watching if this was illuminating
164:15 - or interesting at all I would be
164:19 - certainly be curious for feedback I
164:23 - wonder
164:39 - so I think I probably got ahead out I'm
164:41 - about 45 minutes later I do kind of want
164:45 - to like I would love to just like
164:47 - rapid-fire fill in those next few steps
164:50 - but I don't know that I really have time
164:52 - for that is there are there any
164:54 - questions I could answer that anybody
164:56 - has okay good I'll be your giving you're
165:03 - giving me nice feedback which I
165:05 - appreciate epic picks is oh yeah so if
165:10 - you want this is the nice thing is you
165:14 - can get this example right now so if you
165:18 - want to run this particular example it's
165:20 - at this URL maybe somebody could maybe
165:24 - somebody could pay post that into the
165:29 - chat sorry somebody who has chat
165:32 - privileges could do that oh can I do
165:34 - that no not easily
165:44 - do I have red in my beard no but I have
165:46 - gray could you do this with the makey
165:49 - makey yes that would be a wonderful
165:51 - thing to think about what other kinds of
165:52 - inputs could you have that are like
165:54 - sensor inputs so I think I don't know
166:01 - when I'll be back next oh I couldn't
166:02 - easily wear next Friday I have a guest
166:04 - coming and the guest I should just say
166:07 - who it is Shirley woo who is a data
166:09 - visualization artist she's gonna do a d3
166:11 - tutorial so maybe I can find some time
166:14 - before next Friday to come back and
166:16 - finish doing finish doing the this
166:21 - example so a fluke asked a great
166:26 - question what is this building towards
166:28 - like what does this have to do going
166:30 - Thank You solar line or Nathan for
166:31 - posting the link to the code so I'm
166:34 - building towards maybe something that
166:36 - would be a musical instrument that you
166:39 - play with your body so ultimately the
166:42 - example that I want to make is I'm
166:44 - taking I'm the training data is I'm
166:48 - collecting different poses like when I
166:49 - stand like this it's the musical notes
166:51 - see when I stand like this it's a
166:53 - musical note D when I stand like this
166:55 - it's the musical note e and so then I
166:59 - want to I want to play a song by doing
167:02 - this that's what I'm building towards
167:03 - actually alright umm oh I don't have I
167:12 - can plug back I this iPad is charging a
167:14 - little bit
167:22 - and I'm not now
167:28 - come on iPad this is very important that
167:32 - I have music to play as I go leave why
167:36 - is this I think I used to be able to do
167:38 - this stuff much faster so harsh I'll ask
167:48 - I'm doing a master's thesis on ml and I
167:50 - need some help may I mail you so I get a
167:52 - lot of email and I very much appreciate
167:57 - all the emails I get and I I actually I
167:59 - do read them all I it's very hard for me
168:01 - to answer coding questions I try to
168:03 - prioritize I mean the sort of students
168:07 - who are students at NYU who are taking
168:09 - classes and then we also have if you're
168:11 - a member a slack channel where people
168:13 - can get help with questions you welcome
168:15 - to email me if but I don't I don't have
168:18 - a good system I would recommend more
168:19 - posting on a forum maybe we could create
168:21 - maybe the coding train discord that sort
168:26 - of stuff so close to 1 million I know at
168:28 - this pace I think I'll hit mean who
168:31 - knows maybe it will go down from here
168:33 - but I think I would hit 1 million
168:35 - subscribers in about 4 or 5 months so I
168:39 - should plan something special for that
168:44 - ok so I was trying to get this to play
168:48 - my I don't know why it won't but that's
168:51 - like home everything's messed up right
168:53 - now with my tablet here I can't get it I
168:56 - just wanted to play my oh I should read
168:59 - you some random members
169:03 - I'll read some random numbers 2.06 770
169:11 - 4831
169:13 - Oh quick today's today's coding train
169:17 - which surely was brought to you by -

Cleaned transcript:

Sound Check 1 2 3 how's my audio everybody good morning happy Saturday it's like this like the old days in Saturday morning when everyone would wake up and gather around the television tube not the youtube and watch cartoons and now you're all here gathered around the YouTube and watching the coding trade it's very weird to be here on a Saturday especially in the morning I don't think I've ever struck I probably streamed on a Saturday before I don't know that i've streamed on a Saturday morning before this isn't a particularly great time I mean there's something about this time it's actually quite nice I feel sort of relaxed in a bit at ease and kind of very glad to be here but also you know the weekend is the weekend and there's lots of family stuff and other things going on so I don't know that I'll be making a habit of this but here we are nonetheless welcome it's so nice to see so many people here I don't actually see you but I feel your presence I feel more calm today for some strange reason maybe it's because I read the marathon last weekend and and I have a very particular topic that I want to focus on today just quickly before I go that topic I want to just thank the sponsors today for Saturday's coding train livestream which are Lane and Linode so if you go to Lane comm slash coding train or Leno dotcom slash coding train you can find out about both of these web services Lane 4 as a password manager and Lou node as a cloud server and I'll come back in the middle of the livestream and talk to you a bit more about the sponsors and show you some clips and things features that they have and tell you about the coupon codes okay so the console.log hello world says Cybertron hello Cybertron it is but still a bit low and Nathan in the chat is way so nathan is a very loyal viewer who has really been getting at me to do some upgrading of the audio equipment that I have is actually quite good I believe I have a lav mic here actually have a shotgun mic over there that I don't use but what I really need to do is some finetuning of the audio there I use a piece of software called open broadcast studio we actually check I don't believe I'm recording anything to disk right now I'm gonna add that it's right here I'm gonna hit start recording and the focus is also down a point you know I I'm out of I'm not of practice here it's Saturday morning and I'm just like what's going on I should be at home having brunch and putting my reading a nice magazine or book and listening to some jazz music on the radio I'm gonna use this not a sponsor but favorite one of my favorite products called the elko stream deck which is by tool for focusing because I put it over there and then I walk over to the camera and I focus on it there we go I think that's problem is my eyesight it's actually quite bad so I can't even see good enough I think that's better alright so one thing I want to mention today if you have been paying attention to the coding terrain YouTube channel you would be aware of this but if you're not if you go to the coding train comm /tm for teachable machine will take you to a web page which has three videos that I actually two videos that I released this week and one that's still sitting on the channel as unlisted other people are asking for the audio to be a little bit louder I'm always afraid to turn it up because I'm just worried about it peaking but everybody is telling me that it could be louder so let's let me go I have a little dial here's this little dial I see it here it's call it says gain on it it's on this audio interface it's blinking green and if I just turn it a little bit to the right I have now made myself a little bit louder I think and I see it's in the yellow but not in the red the problem is like it's very excited sometimes going into the red but a teachable machine is a project from Google Creative Lab that I referred to in a lot of my ml 5 je s videos and but they released a new version of it if I go to teachable machine with google.com I will be on this webpage and it is a fast and easy way to create machine learning models for your sites apps and more no expertise or coding required and you can see that so base I'm not going to go through this right now because I have three videos that go through it in quite a bit of detail but I encourage you to check out the video about it there they actually have their own tutorials that you can watch that are much more succinct and it's like insane as mine so I don't know what your preference is but if you just want to learn how it works I would definitely recommend you watch theirs instead of mine if you want to watch somebody embarrass themselves for 15 or 20 minutes then you can watch mine there's some wonderful projects and what I what I'm excited one things I'm very excited about is how they've integrated the teachable machine machine learning models with all these other libraries and frameworks in particular the p5.js library with the ml5 library so I don't want to go through this now it really relates to what I do want to do in this session which is a look at a particular feature of the ml 5 library that it also deals with training a model but I would encourage you to check out my videos and in particular I would really love to see what people make with this I mean I love that for everything but I'm particularly curious as to whether this method Oh G of working this interface in the browser that allows you to train a model and then download that model or export or upload that model to work with say p5.js and ml5 if that's something that inspires people to make creative work and so for all any of these videos if you click on this to the tutorial button and there's actually the one of them has you'll see there's this area called community contributions and I want to see your community contributions here so badly so please and because I would like to come back and look at some of them and play with them on a future video there was one so I think if I go to them maybe the snake game yes so Mika crucial who has been a wonderful supporter of the channel in contributions on github thank you so much for you adding a lot of stuff to the website and things that I really appreciate that if this is the only community contribution that I know of so let's try it and what's one of the things that's really interesting about this system is if you train the models say using your webcam it's going to learn the context of what your webcam is looking at so let's say you train it to recognize a banana versus an orange would that still work when I look at it here in this context with the green screen behind me all right so I am Here I am loading there we go so I think the idea here is that I'm supposed to play rockpaperscissors with the computer hmm I guess the computer is just winning oh no I want I guess it's actually detecting that I did scissors or I'm gonna do paper it detected my paper that's awesome of course I lost paper again I win let's see you does it detect rock there we go thinks that scissors thinks that's paper so what a couple things I would say here is that interaction design wise just as a little critique here I'm kind of confused so what I think I understand is that's what the computer is picking and that's what I'm picking but what I'm but what I'm really confused here is about the timing so I feel there's this like ready but I feel like what might be helpful is some sort of like countdown timer like get into position you know because when you play it one way to play the game is rock paper scissors or says shoot like that kind of thing so I wonder if there's some kind of way that it could step me through the process a bit more and maybe the visual language of this being bigger is meaningful and the I could be emojis is like what's the computer versus me or also I think quite effective but something about the difference in sizes and the placement I like that the video is there but kind of faded into the background that's kind of I think a nice idea but I think there may be there could be some other ways to think about how to do the interface I also am really lost in finding myself because I think this is cropped and I would I would always I would mirror the video because it just makes interacting with things much easier because oh no it is mirrored it is mirrored it's definitely mirrored I just was oh I see maybe it's doing that on purpose so that if I put so that there we go I see this is what it wants me to do so maybe there could be it could there could be a bit of a stage where it lets you kind of get set and it seems there's a moment also where it's like freezing and not that's find that very distracting so I kind of want to see it always great so I want to see more of these Oh me cos in the chat the timer is the pink bar at the top okay got it I see I see ah and Simon is saying that there have been a bunch of community contributions from the interactive drawing video so maybe I will let's let's go let's go take a quick peek at that Oh one thing I need to do so I have this iPad here where I can play and the cold left conjecture okay okay everybody settle down settle down it only has 2% battery left so I'm going to unplug over here so I won't have any music for a little while let me let this charge up but it'll charge up by hopefully the time that I need that music all right let's check out what else is happening on the channel here there's the interactive drawing was one of our recent video that I can take a look at and also the koloff's conjecture I haven't had the time to do another one of these Cabana videos which I'm very sad about ironically I probably would have done one this morning but what's been coming here to do this live stream but too many things to do okay I don't see any community contributions for this one yet I'm shocked I'm shocked I'm shocked after community contribution for this video let's check out the coalesced conjecture they definitely have been a bunch whoa there's a lot amazing let me just do a quick click through I'm just gonna open them all up this one for some reason doesn't have a link let's let's open that this is probably a bad idea what I'm doing let's let's just let's just look through these okay of course mwah little rainbow koloff's conjecture visualization got to love that this is by a sequential chaos now we've got one that is by Alvaro ko looks pretty similar to mine but there's probably something different here that I'm not aware of let's see if it says growing visualization oh no no if this this is not similar than mine I made a version of this like this myself just to make a gif to post on Twitter but this one is actually animating it I forgot that my video tutorial doesn't animate it so that's wonderful thank you for that um koloff's tree refresh Oh sad where's the tree why is it showing me all this nonsense okay so I'm not sure what's happening with this one we can click on looking at the code and try running it here so I have to click I probably have to click or something nope so I'm not sure what's going on here Donna we let me know I'm happy to try showing it again this is a coal lots visualization from a spectral flame added code for animated and static drawing so one thing I certainly recommend if you can let's see is to add a readme file with like a gif animation or a screen shot that scroll down the page says Simon let me go back to that one the coal Lots growing tree okay let's go back to uh it was just it was just taking up a lot of space there it is another growing one and I like the color selection here the green this is a good team trees if you have a major team trees donation please go ahead and do that oh here's a really night look at this one I like this from super Rimbaud this is kholat sunray sun sunrise from anuraag Hazra this is quite lovely this was I saw this on Twitter and a lot of people had sort of fun names for this kind of supernovae I like design and I like this use of dat GUI here looks like I could probably try changing various parameters and I don't know if oh and then if I click I guess it will it'll it'll every time I click it'll reset and rerun with these new parameters I really want to do some more prints printing of these and make some so that's our plotter stuff I kind of come back to that today this is lovely okay Kolak Swede this is interesting again another processing one there's this now I really want to kind of run this so I've tried like I guess I guess to run one that's in processing I have to just download it and now if I'm gonna do this I should also go back to spectral flames because it's only fair a lot of stuff in this downloads directory but since there's a fish I got to know what this fish is oh look at that I love this so I love this I think what I love about this which surprises me in a way is using I suppose this Co Lots conjecture visualization in scene so you could imagine this being a 2d game that you're playing whether you're moving of drop bump you know what you're the fish and you're controlling the fish and the fish has to eat or swim or whatever but well the while those you know the trees at the seaweed at the bottom was all coming from the coal lots conjecture okay let's Oh Kolak my seat REE I guess so this looks like maybe it just picks a different angle and a color skiing each time which is really really nice so nice to see these on these variations another rainbow one Thank You Louis still a all and we're seeing this also on code pen so it's nice to see people try different code editors and frameworks Eric rovol it posted something about trying a 60degree angle and it looks like the image I'm seeing over here on my slack chat screen is showing a very like hexagonal pattern which is nice I don't know if that's gonna show up another one here garrulous bye Diplo focus oh wait I think I made everything tiny there we go whoo I like this I like I like this idea of these sort of like lines here spectral flame we're going to try that let's try spectral flame let's cure this here up let's get rid of this here and try this nope that's the other one not this one there we go ooh I like this I like the layering of this now what's different I guess it's doing huge sections at once and then varying the color and kind of blending it it's quite oh wow this is quite enjoyable needs some use this needs full screen in music I just let you enjoy this for a minute oh I still have my mic on I thought I'd muted my mic I was thinking a break there give myself a break so does immunity my mic probably her me some tea over there okay I'm back hello this is lovely ah beautiful just beautiful okay refresh the repo oh look at this here's a nice read me I'm solicited okay the version of numberphile uses the angle of pi divided by 13 to the right and pi divided by 20 to the left they have these long lines with bumps on the underside of them okay I think if I'm right spectral flame maybe you also commented in the actual YouTube video somebody wrote a really excellent commentary about somewhere that I did read it was on Twitter or in the YouTube video or maybe it was oh maybe this was the conversation we had on github but and maybe it was spectral flame apologies if it was somebody else who really did it sort of deep dive in figuring out what were the properties of the visualization from the numberphile video and how those were different from the ones that I that the version that I created and it looks like there's a really nice explanation of that here and played around with some more and got this colorful artwork and equals it so it's hard to read five million change the color plow to include all colors Wow look at that that is quite something technique Collins is asking where can I get the documentation for the quickdraw project so I'm not sure exactly what you're referring to but if you're referring to the actual quickdraw dataset that is also from Google Creative Lab and there's a github repo that has all of the documentation of the quickdraw dataset if you're looking for information related to my video tutorial that makes use of a machine learning model called sketch RNN which was trained on the quickdraw dataset then you can find that at the coding train comm if I go to this the challenge page and typically I mean sometimes things are missing here and if they are you can file an issue or actually submit the link but all of the relevant links related to the material that I use should show up here other videos that are related to show up here and then community contributions but if you're looking for the code you can find that here and a lot of time my goal is to always have JavaScript code processing code and a link to the version running in the web editor but this one has no processing code because I don't currently have a Java I didn't there's not an easy way to bring the sketch RNN model into Java I'm definitely possible but it's not something that I've spent some time doing I added this overlay thing I know there haven't been any new members or anything joining yet I'm just curious if something's gonna pop up will it Cody train will ask DT six will you try Q learning in the near future so I would answer yes to that question if we could take the word near out it's really it's a little bit's I'm having a tough time I'm just definitely doing a lot and making content and I made this list I definitely don't have it Simon probably has it handy somewhere at the beginning of the semester of kind of the things that I wanted to do this semester I've gotten to very few of them I haven't gotten to some of them but I got a very few of them a qlearning is on my list of things that I would like to tackle it's not something that I have a lot of experience with a researcher here at NYU named Aiden Nelson has made a bunch of qlearning examples with p5 I can try to find those and and and Link those contain well they look like that overlay works I would have to refund you your money thank you oh oh that's sad what do what I need to do to get that to work well there we go thanks Simon is now sharing with you me on my list I wonder if there's an easy way for me to pull that up on screen but and Dan man asks are you going to make videos about our making our personal teachable machine framework ah okay we will let me cover this and then some people are asking about whether the teacher low machine sorry this was not a call to ask people to give super chats I apologize I didn't I was not really my intention thank you very generous of you and it's very much appreciated and I thought I had a little overlay they thought people thumbs up for their messages but apparently that didn't work so I forgot about the questions let me this o it so many good questions I'm trying to try to try to answer these okay I'm gonna I'm gonna actually scroll the chat which will stop it automatically scrolling okay are you going to make videos about making our personal teachable machine framework so so I actually have well look at all what an interesting that this pops up this weird what I'm looking for is the YouTube playlist but it's kind of interesting I guess from the ML this this is what this is the link I'm looking for us apologies oh I want the playlist though oh the Internet is a rough place why don't I have this playlist linked in an obvious place let's try with the chances on like one of these probably not website working on the website ah an issue to github so I can pull up thank you that's an excellent way of doing this I have a lot of content but I guess I have to go do I have to do what I didn't want to do which is actually just go to my channel how are there 447 people watching this right now and look for playlists oh my god you know it's bad when I can't even look at this private liked videos mmm I want that to show up I'm naughty I need anything else oh I'm logged into my like main account it's not my intention oh oh god this is this is not going well created playlists what I'm looking for is it's gonna happen for me the question was are you going to make videos about making our own personal teachable oisin framework if you want to do that you can do that with the discussion in my ml 5 video about transfer learning with the feature extractor and then running your own feature extractor classification example this is basically a bit more that's that in terms of the tactical material that you would need to actually create the training interface and control the training process yourself more closely so sorry that took me a long time to pull that up and what I want to do today is actually add make content to go through a bunch of examples in this live session that will get edited it down into videos that will end up in this playlist about training a neural network model all right so the other questions were the teachable machine experts are currently broken is that being looked into I don't know I do know that there is a sort a little bit of a source of confusion a bunch of people posted that they had an error like a fetch error and maybe I can just touch on that really briefly so if I were let's just pretend for a second that I just trained a model and I went here to export model there's no model train so you're going to get once you've gone through this whole process you're going to get a URL that's here and then you're going to see here you're also going to see a code snippet what's confusing is the URL that teachable machine gives you does not include it's just the path to the all the model file excuse me but it does not include model JSON which ml5 expects so if you were copying and pasting yeah thanks thanks I can I can tell if you're copying and pasting this code the URL that you have for the model that gets stored in a variable and then you have to append modeled up JSON for it I was seeing people have that error there is a YouTube problem with emotes on streams spamming like 10 emotes can get your Google account suspended alright so those were some questions that I wanted to answer I think I better get started with some content it's already 11 o'clock and I'm going to do my sponsor segment at around 1030 1130 you know travel back in time so someone keep me on track here and I think this is gonna go until 1200 or 1230 I mean at this point most likely 1230 okay how's that let me see how my oh and let's go to the let's since I asked for it let's pull up what github.com slash website what is wrong with me coding train slash web site issues and todo list okay oh wow let's just take it let's do a little accounting here uh RDP done Mauro's done colas conjecture tick tock nope nope none of these none of these done we could add by the way team trees edited version I don't know if it makes sense to edit that into something that's sort of a discussion avid Mattia ah so this is what I'm going to do today excellent I sort of did this I sort of did this but I chain of drew making the video tutorial we discovered a lot of problems with library to change so I need to redo this tutorial I did this I haven't done any of these I'm done any of these hoc tober festers over streaming improvements nightbot it says Nike bot this should say nightbot I believe discord and then 2020 so this is stuff for 2020 okay all right so this is good I'm not doing terribly the latent space stuff I'm really excited to do with runway ml so I have some plans for that this I definitely want to do this is a collaboration with a youtube channel called practical engineering so I need to get back to practical engineering about that and today's topic will be this I don't think there'll be a coding challenge today I'm looking at this but today I think today this is today ml 5 neural network ok so let me let's see how my the charge is going with this 6% boy that really didn't do very good I guess I could try to get it keep it plugged in I have anything that this could connect to not really there's no plug just looking at my notes from my class Singh where okay I think I'm gonna do this stuff so in case you're wondering what I'm looking at I'm teaching a course at NYU this semester called introduction to machine learning for the arts and I've been preparing a lot of material and doing a lot of teaching in the course about it I haven't been able to keep up my plan was to be making the videos for the course all semester long and yeah and to some extent I've been doing that but I got way behind so I'm kind of going back to remind myself what I did in class and sort of deciding how to how that is going to feed into what I want to show in this particular set of videos and so I think I think I'm ready to go and the other thing I want to do well I've up one upgrade I've made to my recording a system is that I have a way and I'm about to turn this on of recording all the different feeds to disk separately greenscreen the laptop screen and the whiteboard and so this if I'm going to edit if when I say I if matsya who does the is the video editor for the coding train is going to edit all this stuff together it's actually really helpful to have all these separate things in case we want to like add some more content and fix them things up okay so I'm just looking in this set that so I should so I need to record output shoot sorry give me a second here apologies to everyone that I'm doing this during the stream but okay so output two is the whiteboard output three is the green screen output 4 is the laptop and so if I go to my multi quarter and I say I want two three and four now I'm gonna start recording and I'm recording everything okay all right so I'm trying to think of how I want to go about this as the nice thing vote so this is good and bad the good news is I have more possibilities for creating higherquality edited versions of the livestream later because I now have the capability to even if I'm showing you things and talking about stuff during the livestream I can replace the background with different content or more zoomed in and highlighted content or even like other animations and other things so I could mention something not even show it and then show it later so that's the good news the bad news for you is that I don't want to fall in the trap of then just not ever showing anything in the live stream and I don't want to also make the process of editing and putting together the videos so onerous that it becomes so slow I'm also like getting a lot of feedback from my monitor so let me just mute this okay great okay so what I'm going to talk about today is and the ml5 neural network class hello and welcome to another beginner's guide to machine learning with ml5 jazz video in this video I am going to look at a piece of functionality in the ml 5 library called it just heard a weird noise outside the room I also hate that this light reflects in my glasses I hear by the way I don't have any buddies from the film industry but I hear that often actors or performers in films will get these special nonreflective like lenses glasses because this is a common issue obviously if I had the lights above me or something that could also get around this issue or but so is that a thing cuz I'll go and buy those you could go get new I need new glasses anyway I need a new prescription Oh spectral piano is off I suppose ok whirly noise I really want to do that whirling noise stuff also should add to this list the not tomorrow's the other the star roads maybe okay hello and welcome to another beginner's guide to machine learning video tutorial with ml 5 yes very excited about this one typically excited about the video just like me but this one I'm particularly excited about because I'm gonna look at something that has recently arrived in the ml 5 jazz library so first of all used version zero point four point two or more recent version perhaps but that's the version I'll be using in this video and I'm gonna look at this functionality in the ml 5 library called ml 5 neural network it is a function in ml 5 that creates a empty or blank so to speak neural network most everything that I've showed you in this video series so far has involved loading a pretrained model so a neural network architecture that's already been trained with some data and in this video I want to look at making an empty a blank slate configure your neural network collecting data training the model and doing inference and the context that I want to look at that is with realtime interactive data so I'm going to come back and maybe use some more traditional data sets there's a data set that I that that's on the ml5 examples with the Titanic survival data set I have the data set for my color classifier series so I'll come back and show you some examples of those as well but in this first video I just want to do something very generic which is create a blank neural network use mouse clicks to Train it and then then move the mouse around for it to make guesses or predictions and that might sound like a weird thing to do and hopefully it'll start to make sense as I build the code and step through all the processes alright so that was my beginning opening discussion I did exactly what I thought is sort of a problem which is that I didn't show you anything like I didn't like clicking browse around the website and find the stuff but I do want to add that in later we'll see how that works all right I do see that there is a suggestion about the audio context in JavaScript it won't be happening today I appreciate everyone's enthusiasm and wanting to have their idea shown or talked about but I'm on a particular path and I'm just doing the topic that I'm doing in the absolutely computational geometry is on my list antireflective coatings applied on their glasses I thought I had that but I will get it I'm gonna go get new glasses it's another thing for my upgrading light how bad is the reflection right now cuz there is a way that I can turn the light away for me and if you've walked the teachable machine series the third video has the light turned away from me and it doesn't reflect but then I also have this weird shadow on my face I don't know all right so I'm gonna go to this page ooh so this shouldn't say come currently in development cuz it's definitely here I'm just gonna sort of scroll it down oh I was gonna I want to talk about Rebecca fie brink and wek inator so let me talk about that and all right the reflection doesn't bother at all okay so I also want to highlight for you the weka Nader project which is a free opensource piece of software created by Rebecca free break in 2009 for training machine learning models and I would especially encourage you to watch Rebecca free Brinks talk from the IO conference in 2018 where she talks about creativity and inclusion in machine learning and goes through some demonstrations of with Weka Nader and processing and other pieces of software so a lot of the work that I'm doing with ml 5 is is entirely based on recreations of many of the example demonstrations that Rebecca fie brink made and has done research about for years and years with the Weka Nader project so in fact the examples that I'm going to make in this video and the next one and the next followups are direct ports in a way of some of the original Weka Nader and processing examples but I'm gonna do it all in javascript in the browser with p5 and the ML 5gs library think what I'll say also is and there's also a fairly lengthy history of creative artists using realtime training machine learning models in real time please let me say that again there's also a long there's also a fairly lengthy history of creative artists training machine learning models in real time to control musical instruments of performance a visual art piece and I would encourage you to check out some of these projects Martlet by michelle and a guy from the water spy and hedge this is not a faraman by guillermo Montesinos in sofia Suazo and the AI conductor by under a stress card that I will link to in this video's description for inspiration and ideas okay so now though let's see here let me just quickly go to the getting started copy this I just want to get the library in the p5 Sketch okay there we go um and how am I on time 1120 all right c'est la vie am I like I don't think this camera is particularly level but it's fine right you can oh let me check the focus at least how's this whiteboard shot can you see that how's the focus I can't tell if I should if I should I'm afraid to touch this camera it's very loosely mounted to the wall I can make it a little sharper I think that's better I think I just improved it okay I shouldn't well nevermind yes I'm going to definitely refer to my former explanations about neural networks in general thank you Peter okay our guide for figuring out how to write the code is going to be the ML v website and there's a page on the ML v website for the neural network function but before I start diving to the code let's take a minute to talk about what a neural network is now by no means am I going to be comprehensive about this at this moment in fact I'm going to give you a very zoomed out highlevel overview and I would refer you to the three blue one brown video series what is a neural network which is one of the most excellent videos on the Internet to just quick to succinctly explain in great depth what a neural network is and I have gone through many different playlists I guess I should be doing this in front of the green screen case I want to show any of this stuff oh yeah just do it over here what you're gonna say this again now by no means am I going to give you a comprehensive explanation now by no means in this video am i going to do a comprehensive deep dive into what a neural network is and how to code one from scratch I will refer you to many other wonderful resources where you could do that deep dive starting with the three blue one brown video what is a neural network and some of the subsequent ones I have also have a 10 to 15 part video series where I build a neural network from scratch in JavaScript based on a particular book called make your own neural network that is in Python I have other videos where that our guides around machine learning concepts where I talk about different kinds of neural networks so I will link to all of those in this video's description but here I'm gonna use the white board over here just to give you a very zoomed out highlevel overview of what I'm talking about so a machine learning system in the most basic sense involves inputs and outputs you know a classic example of a data science approach to machine learning might be we want to have some sort of machine learning model that can predict the price of a house based on some set of factors so it might be the inputs in this case might be the number of bedrooms and the the LAT latitude and longitude of where it is in the world and the number of square the square footage or square meters the size of that house those inputs would be fed into the machine learning model and the output would be a number a price on this by the way is called a regression which sounds like a sort of terrifying term and oh I have to be a PhD in statistics to understand regression but what I mean in this case a regression is the output is some continuous number it's a price it could be zero it could be a hundred it could be it 1.5 million it's some number which is different than the output being a classification meaning it is a one of several categories it's a cat or a dog or a turtle or its Class A or Class B or Class C so if you've watched my recent teachable machine video series about training an image classifier a sound classifier all of those examples are classification outputs the output that you get is a set of confidence scores and categories interestingly enough I started with this discussion saying I was going to give you a highlevel overview of what a neural network is and I haven't even begun that because I started talking about a highlevel overview of the machine learning pipeline the process and so in a way that's what this video is also about and the way that I think might be an effective is an an effective way that I might be able to demonstrate this to you is to kind is to find the most drop dead simple almost trivial scenario to show you all of those pieces let me yeah this is just the corner of the room for people who are asking why boy I something about the whiteboard today very hard to race I need a whiteboard cleaning system this barker is pretty bad also it's just this one's better yeah this one's better so I will get to talk you about what a neural network is but for the moment I'm actually going to like stick with the sort of full pipeline of a machine learning project should really start this whole thing over don't like my explanation but whatever let's just keep going all right I'm thinking I know exactly what I want to do but I'm just kind of confused about this roundabout way that I'm doing this so let's say for a moment that the goal that I have is to train a machine learning model to use my body as the input so maybe how I'm moving my arms and legs and head that will be the input and the output would be a musical instrument a note that's being played so I could somehow play different notes based on how I move my body this is this is a scenario that has been this is a scenario that Rebecca fibrin covers in great detail in her course about machine learning and Weka nader i forget what it's called machine learning for artists and musicians this is this is an area that's covered in great detail and Rebecca fie brings course machine learning for artists and creators what musicians know what that's called the worst artists and musicians yeah okay I know you can't see it but I'm recording it this is an area that's covered in great detail in Rebecca Phoebe brings course machine learning for artists and musicians a very simple one way that I might boil this idea down into its very simplest version is think about a 2d canvas and it's very convenient that I'm using p5 because that's the thing that exists in p5.js I have a 2d canvas and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say there's a mouse in that canvas and the mouse is going to move around the canvas and based on where it is it will play a particular note now of course I could do this with if statements very easily and what what's the thing that the Kyle McDonald quote Kyle McDonald I think I actually put it in my syllabus somewhere it's in this talk weird intelligence interested in nice where some people have something this is a really good talk by the way great quote that I want to reference I guess I guess I missed it I'm not gonna find it I'm gonna give up okay where is that from shoot anybody know what I'm talking about cuz I would like to reference it let me give me one second to look for this Kyle McDonald what is machine learning and this is what I'm looking for in this medium article I really like this explanation I don't think I'm going to find us I'm just gonna have to say it my own words instead of quoting Kyle maybe it was actually might actually have been a discussion here hold on I know Kyle oh it's this one it's this talk maybe or not okay I give up sorry everybody so many things around the world to look at okay I give up I give up sorry I'm wasting way too much time go back to the ifstatement thing now of course I could program this same idea with an ifstatement but this is really what it means to work with machine learning instead of programming the rules explicitly into code what I'm going to do is give the code a whole bunch of examples and have it learn those rules so I want to demonstrate that process in a scenario where it's very obvious how it's working so that then we can build on that into much more complex scenarios where we're more sophisticated problems could be or I guess really I'm just saying we could build on that into much more complex scenarios okay so the steps are collect data to train model then three I guess we can call this prediction so we could that's also sometimes referred to as inference that's really when we're deploying the model we're making use of the model right here this is my representation of the model I'm totally not talking about what a neural network is so in this case if I want to start with a classification problem and I will show you demonstrations of classification and regression I'm going to have two inputs input 1 and input 2 often refer to as X's in a sort of machine learning context those inputs are going to go in to this machine learning model the output is going to be one of let's say three different categories so I'm going to have three outputs notes like a B well let's actually play a C major scale the worst eraser ever C D and E so two inputs and in this case three outputs a diagram is the weirdestlooking thing ever ate the way it looks it is 1130 says David okay I'm gonna get through I'm gonna get through this explanation then I'll take a short break before I start with the coding I feel like I'm not actually there's no reason for me to explain I'm so I'm really lost in like where I am in the world of like what people who will be coming to watch this will have seen before what makes sense to explain and not explain but I'm gonna just keep pushing forward okay my diagram looks a little bit weird so I'm gonna fix it up for a second this is like the craziest thing okay so I have two inputs input zero input one and three outputs C D or E now all this time I've just been putting the word the no now all this time I've just been putting the letters ml in here for machine learning or maybe referring to this as a model because in truth other things other kinds of algorithms other types of ideas beyond a neural network could slot in here but the ml 5 generic blank machine learning model that you can train is a neural network 1 so if I were to try to zoom into this for a moment what I would actually see is something that looks something like this right that was to accept well this is gonna be a really nice sped up moment a neural network is an interconnected set of nodes where that and at least a feedforward multilayered perceptron which is what this is is we're all is a network where all of the data flows in one direction the inputs come in here they get processed by well the inputs come the inputs come in here the inputs come in here and get fed into what's known as a hidden layer they get processed by something called an activation function and then they go out of the hidden layer into the output layer so this is really a two layer network it has inputs and then two layers a hidden layer and an output later and a hidden layer and an output layer and all of these connections have weights to them and they're like little dials that you can twist and turn to process the information in different ways this is my zoomed in diagram of really what's going on in here a neural network is a network of neurons multiball tthis is a technically this is a feedforward multilayer perceptron because the inputs which are represented right here get fed through these connections they're weighted connections and get added up all together and arrive in this layer which is known as the hidden layer and there can be multiple hidden layers and different kinds of hidden layers but that data is summed and processed through a mathematical function called an activation function and then fed out of the hidden layer and into the output layer and the output layer after all of the hidden outputs are summed and passed through an activation function we get a set of numbers out and those numbers might look like this point two point seven point one meaning there's a two percent likelihood that this was category C a 70 percent likelihood that this was category D and a 110 percent likelihood that this was category e so there's a lot more details of what's going on in here and I certainly once again would refer you to the various things that I'll link in this video's description but the idea is that but the idea is that a neural network is that process that is a neural network is a kind of machine learning model that can be trained all of these weights can be adjusted so that but the idea here is that a neural network the idea here is that a neural network is a machine learning model that can be trained it can be shown a lot of examples of inputs with their correct corresponding outputs and it can tune all of the weights of all these connections so that when it later gets new data it can make appropriate predictions this is everything that the ml5 library will take care of for you and for us we're going to really just be working with the inputs and the outputs collecting our training data training the model and predicting outputs thank you thank you all right finally she cut to the point messed up the percentage what did I say 2% and I say 2% a 20% chance of being a 20% chance of being category C a 70% chance of being category D or a 10% chance of being category E okay alright um thank you everybody for your patient I said 7% oh my god it's only getting worse okay just checking my phones 1145 it's gotta move quicker here all right so I'm willing to take a minute or two to thank whoops hold on where are the sponsors of today's coding train come on and so I am going to start with Lane so first of all if you go to Lang comm slash coding train that is the link you'll want to use to check out Lane so here's the thing if you are concerned at all about staying safe online one of the things you really want to have in your tool set is a password manager I could not possibly live without a password manager and in fact if I come back here to my screen right here and if I were to say you know if I were to log out of the web editor and just open it up and feel like I need to log back in as you'll see here I can log into my password manager Lane which will then pull up my password for the web editor and get me logged in instantly so it's the kind of thing that's like a real pain on the internet is to memorize and keep track of all your passwords in a secure way and one of the ways you really wanted to wanted one of the things you really want to do is have a different randomly generated password for everything that you log into and it's really hard to do that without a password manager so the when when you create a Lane account you get a single master password it's never transmitted over the internet not even two Lane and not to their servers and when you generate a long and complex password for a new website in Lane it's bundled up encrypted using your master password that only you know so um you can see here just a whole lot of quick demonstrations of like logging in there's generating a password one of the things I really also use that I find really super useful is just like having all of my like shipping information and credit card information driver's life Social Security numbers stuff all saved in this very secure method that I can just quickly have so if you want to try it out you can sign up for free for you get a free 30day trial of dashlane premium at dashlane comm slash coding train and then also if you purchase the the premium account you'll get a discount from the through through the coding train as well so now in addition to a password manager one of the things that I need very very often is a web server and so a new service that I've been experimenting with and looking at is 'la node so whether you're working on a personal project are managing your enterprise's infrastructure I don't know if you'd I don't manage an enterprise's infrastructure maybe you to Lou node has the pricing support and scale you need to take your project to the next level they've got ten data centers world word worldwide and they're launching an 11th in Sydney Australia soon so here's the thing you as a member as a viewer of the coding train can get a lenôtre count with $20 in credit today by going to Linode comm slash coding train so you'll get access to asset native SSD storage a 40 gigabyte network and an industryleading revamp cloud manager which is built on an opensource single page app Cloud Leno comm so you get root access to your server you're gonna see this right now this is the kind of thing so like I my Twitter bot series you could use Leno to like spin up your Twitter bot you could do all sorts of things it has 1click installs for WordPress the lamp stack you can have a Minecraft game server all that kind of stuff so just to quickly show you if you go to a Leno coding train you'll get a nice welcome message for where the $20 credit for a news drivers from the coding train and you can give this service a try out and let me know how it goes I'd be very curious to hear the other thing I do want to mention that the node let me know is there also hiring so if you go to lynda.com slash careers if you're if you're a viewer of the coding train you probably have some of the skills that they're looking for in terms of their hiring as well so feel free to check out their careers apply for a job and tell them that the coding train sent you so I'm going to take just a couple minute break to get a drink of water and my iPad oh no we created went down so I don't have music to play and so I would encourage you to go if you have a few minutes to try signing up at Lang comm slash coding train and Linode comm slash coding training both of those links are in this video's description with also a pin comment that has those links as well and I'll be right back to finish writing my code in about five minutes they don't have any music to play but I'm gonna mute my microphone so silence meditate okay I'm back I little break sorry for this silence in the break i am i i'm gonna charge this ipad up so that i can please have the music our very sound effects for later i can't put the charger it's so weird like how did a second of going oh there it is a longer cable really go a long way right about now but what can I do alright I'm still muted no no no okay yeah no I'm not muted anymore okay thank you it's jus alright so I've got a little time on a finish making this example I want to make two examples so we'll see how this goes alright I'm just looking at the documentation yeah okay ooh I like this okay okay this needs a semicolon all right I'm going to finally write some code in this particular tutorial now that I'm hey now that I've gotten through that explanation I'm here to write some code and all right oh let's take him in here Dan man asks and thank you coma Borachio and I I'm so sad that you're I I thought I set something up that if somebody does like a super chat message River will like appear as an overlay but I really do it right but Dan mass where can get one of these so guess what I it's taking me forever to do this and it's a very disappointing to me how long it's taking me to do this but it is happening I'm about to relaunch the members program on YouTube and make a bunch of changes and I will be laser etching custom coding training train whistles which I will be sending out to new members so anybody who's an existing member right now will get one I'm gonna send one to everyone whether you're joined a while ago look not everyone sorry anyone at the $10 higher because it is kind of big it's going there's gonna be a significant expense with buying these not that significant about buying them laser etching them and shipping them so I haven't figured out all the level stuff but that is something that I will be sending out I have some new stickers I have like a member only exclusive it's not a thing I'm gonna sell it's gonna be an exclusive coding train laseretched a train whistle I'm gonna learn how to use the laser printer by golly to do that all right I like how Bruno writes in the edited version I may be 50 seconds into the video I'm like an hour and a half into here okay that was Japanese yen yes all right so that's coming I mean I think that I'm gonna have that I would say in early 2020 Jan you mean that's my guess so anyway lots more launching a new store I've mentioned this before about huge thank you to standard TV which is a company that works with a lot of wonderful other YouTube channels and you can find all of the creator stores here and I'm hopefully going to be here soon they helped me with the sponsorships and they also have a service called nebula that you should definitely check out and there was something else about standard they don't want to say oh the these thumbnails which I am absolutely in love with were created by Simon who's a designer who works with standard TV so anyway right goodies for the patreon subs yet um so David's kick I don't want to I gotta get back to coding and stuff and I don't want to but my my plan I I know that you want to stay through patreon which is absolutely fine I'm not going to delete the patreon but all any goodies that our YouTube members the goodies will be the same for YouTube members or patreon subscribers but I there are a few things that YouTube will allow me to do in terms of member only stuff that if you're on patreon you won't be able to get access to but in terms of mailing something or any other rewards like invitation to slack or discord or whatever use that's and I did get github sponsorships unlocked so I might have I might make github sponsorships the preferred alternative to YouTube memberships if you don't want to if you don't want to but I'll be giving part of your funding money to Google which frankly you are if you sign up through YouTube membership they take quite a large percentage you know in my mind it's a reasonable percentage it's I'm getting getting a good service here but okay to the code how I got a login shoot here's my dashlane ad I'm logging in through dashlane which is logging me into the web editor and yeah I want to I want to leave this page okay I'm starting with a p5 okay now that I've gotten through that explanation I'm I really want to just write some code and show you how this all works so I'm starting with a p5 sketch that also is referencing the ml 5 library zero point four point two as of today but that's not the important part I want to go back to my JavaScript file and I have that here so what is the code that I want to write so I want to make a variable called model so I'm gonna call it you could call it neural network or machine learning classifier thingy I'm gonna call it model and my model is going to be a new ml 5 neural network so this is neural network as a function you can call in the ml 5 library that creates an empty version of what is right here and it's up to us to configure the inputs and the outputs so one thing and the way that you can do there's a variety of ways you can do that but I'm going to show you how to do that by creating a variable called options which is just a JavaScript object that has the configuration for the neural network and then the options gets passed in when you create the neural network so the things that I want to do is I want to give it a certain number of inputs in this case to a certain number of outputs in this case 3 and then also I want to tell it what kind of task I want it to do a classification super chat from Martin W Thank You ma team trees says epic picks team trees super chat from I understand thank you I want those overlays off to figure that out for the next time incidentally if how do I know this is what I type in here if I go to whoops not processing if I go to the neural network documentation page on the ml 5 website all of this is documented here and probably what's most useful is right here to show you this is exactly what I've done the number of inputs the number of outputs and then oh it says type I thought this is task I think it's task just say type that's weird let me look at the examples I kind of think it should be task could be type tasks I think I'm pretty sure it's tasks I think that's a I think that's an error in the documentation as my memory is that it's tasks so I'm gonna leave it as that summers incidentally and I'll cover this in a future video if your data is something that's in a file you've already collected it maybe it's in a JSON file or a comma separated values file a CSV file you can actually load that file as part of what the neural network and it will use that file to train the neural network but I'll come back to that in a future example where I'll show you a scenario where that makes sense in this case there is no data yet I'm going to collect the data in my p5.js sketch itself in addition to another way that another way that I can also create the neural network is instead of just specifying there are two inputs and three outputs I can also give names to the inputs this isn't something that a neural network needs or even uses but it's a way that's very useful as a programmer creating the neural network for me to keep track of what's going on to name my inputs and name my outputs so that's actually the way that I want to do it in this particular example so I'm going to change the number of inputs to an array of names and the outputs what I say I'm going to do the note C D and E so this now is what it looks like with the inputs named I instead of saying I'm gonna give an array with two strings in it instead of saying three I'm gonna give it an array with three strings in it so many super chats going on I will try to come back and thank them or I need a way of keeping track of them good job keep it up says Igor Thank You Igor and there was also one from I understand Thank You Nathan for being me Manuel super chat alright where are we now in terms of these steps we're in the collect data step I want to collect data to do that I'm going to make an array I'll call it a training data and every time I press the mouse I will collect a data point so I'm gonna create I'm gonna create a variable called a sample a sample meaning like one data record one instance one sort of slice of the data and it's going to have an x value which is going to be Mouse X a Y value oh wait a second this is not how it works is it how does this work if I guess I sail a ball I'm doing classification and you just call it label like when you're doing classification with oh no let me look at the documentation oh no that's how it works there unless I don't actually give it the number that's weird it's funny we went around in circles with this and I think I'm forgetting how it works because I did the examples that I made didn't use classification does it keep it figures out the number of labels doesn't make any sense hold on let me let me go to my examples from my class because I have this example and here yeah this is what this is the example that I'm intending to build I can't use the computer why is this not chained there we go so what I want to do is change this to okay pretty sure we added this support here sorry everybody figuring this out stuff is hard now getting started copy to clipboard okay sketch let's see what happens X is what I'm doing is this doesn't make any sense how this would work with classification can I just do this maybe if I just do this right oh I'm gonna try it like this and see oh no let me see if this works so I give it a bunch of A's change it to be give it a bunch of bees train hey bee oh so this is working so that's how it works you just give it the all right great so it works the way it's gonna work the way I want it to work fine I just had to understand what I was doing okay sample with an X that is Mouse x and a y that's Mouse Y then I also need a target a target is because I'm collecting training data I need to not just only collect the inputs and actually maybe actually mmm you know what I'm gonna I'm gonna change it like this actually let me call this inputs because this is really what I'm doing I'm collecting what the inputs should be for this training data so the inputs are X is Mouse X Y is Mouse Y and then the output I also need to have the output which is some particular note that should be associated with this x and y but I'm gonna actually call that a target because it's this is training data so in the end oh boy why did this go off oh dear this camera is so off in the end I want in the end I want the neural network to guess the note for me but I have to give it some examples of what I want so in this case let's just say it's going to be C and then I can add this data to the model so I'm gonna say model add data the inputs associated with this particular target then just so I can see what's going on I think I should save all of this training data I guess I don't need to save it I should just draw it here do you wanna that's the way that's going to make sense yeah oh I could do can I do that like object Street destructuring thing I want to save all the data so I'm going to use that array that I created earlier and say training data dot push and I'll make a new object that has the inputs and the target in it and then in the draw loop I can loop through everything and visualize the data onto the canvas drawing a circle and then also drawing the category for that and then also drawing the class associated with that circle inside the circle let's run this and see if it works great so as I click around we're seeing all these data points that all have an XY associated with them and a label associated with them in this case hardcoded as C input provided is not supporter does not match your output label specifications now I am getting an error here which says that input provided is not supported or does not match your output label specifications so I think I've made a mistake here let me see if I can figure out what that is do we say 1215 in both outlets yeah where did I just like pulled up an example yeah this worked what's different is it really type and not tasks that we did a change to type no this is using oh yeah hold on duplicate let me see let me save this reference neural network no no no getting started copy this worked right and data oh I know what the problem is I know what the problem is and I know what the problem is the target has to be in an array because there can be multiple in many cases there's multiple outputs all right aha I have found the error of my ways very common mistake in this case my target is the string see the category see I want to play ultimately I want to hear the note see played but in many cases there could be multiple especially in a regression problem sorry in many cases and you'll see this in future examples that I'll demonstrate there could be multiple outputs whether it's multiple categories or multiple numbers there's lots of possibilities here and so just the the outputs themselves yeah it really should be there should be a different way of doing this need to be but this is the way it is right now the outputs themselves need to be in an array so I needed to put this bracket here a round target because I'm taking the category C and that individual class in an array with one thing in it is the actual target that I want to give to this particular model so let me run this again and see if that error goes away I don't see that error anymore now I need some method by which I select what the training label is and so I'm going to create a variable called target label set that equal to C I'm going to have a function called key pressed and I'm going to say training label equals the key that was pressed a console.log a training label so I'm going to just do a quick and dirty interface which is really no interface to have the label set by when I press the key and I'm not doing any error checking to make sure I'm just doing C D or e only but all that could come you could add that and and then the target should be that training label itself and let me run this now whoops training label sorry target label not training label CCC letting press D no that didn't work Oh training label it's called target label and let me just make sure it's uppercase to be consistent si si si si si si si si ddddd e so I now have collected my data what is the next step the next step is train the model and luckily for us this is a very easy step for us to accomplish simply by calling a function in the m l5 neural network library called train and yes it is a train I'm going to add an extra function here that the next I'm going to check if the key happens to be pressed as T now I am going to call model train now when I train the model I also have some options that I can that I can specify and there are a variety of things and I could sort of come back and talk about some of these terms and how they affect the process maybe in one of my subsequent videos but for right now I'm going to just talk about one particular term and that term is epochs so I'm gonna say epochs 10 I'm gonna train it based on these options and I'll come back and say so what is he box so what is he pox look at this summit oh something's control how did that get in there oh because I'm like typing keys all the time and then I click the mouse I should validate it but whatever shoot I just want to CDE all of these data points are going to be fed into the model as part of the training process one at a time the inputs along with the target the inputs get fed in the model makes a guess if it's gotten it correct moves on to the next one it feeds the inputs in the model makes a guess if it's gotten it incorrect adjusts all of these dials all over the place these weights of the neural network towards the error to try to correct that error and then starts over again it's feeding in all the data one at a time so what is an epoch an epoch is one cycle through every single data point fed into the model so maybe there's 35 here if I have 10 epochs I'm feeding in all 35 data points and of course the camera is overheating it's really not that hot in here and this fan on move the air around a little bit nuts not the coding train if the cameras don't just shut off every once in a while so if there are 35 of XY target trios so to speak then and I do 10 a pox then it's doing all 35 of those 10 times or 350 training cycles through the neural network itself now interestingly enough and this is built into ml 5 it shuffles the order all of these randomly because I collected all the C's than all the DS and then all of the ease and the model wouldn't trained very well if it didn't do that but that's something that's built into ml 5 itself so I've set the epochs I've set I've set the epochs and now the train function and tell ya it's gonna take some time and actually has multiple callbacks associated with it then go to the page where does they send an error I guess who knows okay okay there's a while training callback and this is a function and event that's triggered this isn't a function and event that's triggered every at the end of every epoch and then there's a finished training callback and this is triggered just once when the training process is complete let me write those functions while training finished training in finish training I'm just gonna add a console log and the wild training callback will be sent two arguments one argument is what epoch are we on and the other argument is a value called loss now ultimately I only need the while training callback if I want to sort of debug what's happening during the training process so for actually for a moment I'm just gonna console.log the epoch and I'm also going to add another property up here in the original options which I'm going to set as debug true because often when you're training a machine learning model you want to see a visualization of the training process and how it's going and there is a particular library called TF viz so ml 5 is built on top of tensorflow Jas and there is a visualization library associated with tensorflow Jas that will draw graphs and different things about the training process so setting debug to true will make that happen automatically and I'll show you exactly what I mean in a moment it's possible that I forgotten something but I think I have all the pieces here I have my options which I want to train over 10 a pox I have a wild training callback where I could just see every Bock well epoch one at a time in the console and it'll tell me when I'm done and I've turned debug on so I should see a visualization so let me move my screen around so that I can see all this stuff collect my data and now for the moment of truth I'm gonna press the T key and as soon as I press that the training process should start I should see the epochs being logged here and a visualization over there let's see what happens oh oh I forgot some steps I forgot some steps I thought this would work anyway I thought we fixed it so that it would work just like finished immediately so there is there's an important function which I was going to demonstrate okay yeah it's supposed to work without this I don't know why it didn't that's annoying I thought it works without this let me see here is there if I don't want to normalize the data is there like yeah that's weird so it's supposed to work 1230 oi yeah weird so we had fixed it I thought so that you don't I was going to talk about how normalizing is an important thing but I guess I'll just hmm that's weird because I I remember going through the source and we added something that if you don't normalize it it will finish preparing the data but all right unfortunately I missed an important step and I meant to talk about this afterwards but I think I need to talk about it now so one of the things that's very typical of working with a machine learning model in particular neural network in particular a neural network based machine learning model one of the things that's very important about working with a machine learning model in particular a neural network based machine learning model is the fact that data should be normalized before it's fed in as inputs into the system and what do I mean by normalized what I mean by normalize is take any arbitrary data look and squish it or squash it or standardize it for all the values to fit between some welldefined range so in this case if I have this canvas and everything in the canvas is an XY point oh you can't see that in this case if I have a canvas and everything is an x and y point in the canvas I'm getting values like 100 pixels by 100 pixels but I want to normalize those pixel values into a number between 0 and 1 so if the width is 400 of the canvas all I need to do is divide by 400 but ml5 has a utility in it that will normalize the data for you we'll just look at it examine it find the minimum the maximum and squish everything down to a value between 0 and 1 and to do that all I need to do is add one more line of code right when I'm finished collecting the data are right before I'm out to train the model and say model dot normalized data let's give this a try again I'm gonna collect data now I'm really going to train the model and it's totally not working what have I done wrong here all right this is a fail this would have been much easier if I hadn't bothered this would have been a better way to demonstrate it I guess this should work no wait target label is this what's going on inputs to outputs three classification debug oh the way I'm drawing it is different why is everything always so hard well that's promising is it just like okay that's good I am 10 epochs is not enough should get like a really really low loss let's try this example basically the same example I really need to I mean I wanted to demonstrate how I could save and just reload the data so I don't have to do this each time because it's kind of ridiculous what I'm doing here why is this like not yeah this is what I expected to see so this is working a hundred epochs why did I mess up X Mouse X mouse Y XY semicolon line 18 I don't think that's the problem all right let's see here try to make this very distinct how many epochs did I put in there 100 a lot more data you really should be able to do this with very little data especially with a lot of epochs here we go okay there we go so amazingly it just need it's just so little data I guess it needs a lot of epochs and I should have gave me an even more cuz it's just so little data although I guess I could probably mess with the learning rate I think it's called learning rate I'm just curious maybe I'm point to five these are the defaults but as soon as I do classification No just curious hold on let me save the I'm gonna actually save the data well you know what I'm actually just gonna I'm gonna leave it let me try this again with many many more epochs I'm realizing it's just very very little data so in order to make it seem like it's a lot more data I can just increase the number of epochs and I'm gonna collect some data yet again I'm gonna show you how you can save the data to reload it so you don't have to keep collecting it over and over again if you're trying to debug your model very important thing but I'm just gonna collect it again press train and very good so what I'm seeing is exactly one of what I want to see I want to see this graph of a line that's going down and down and down and down and down as low as it can go done and and we can see here in the console these are all the epochs it got up to epoch 199 and then said done so what is it graphing over there Oh scammer has gone off it's graphing a very particular it's graphing a very important property that's part of its graphing something called loss now we could actually look you might recall at we could actually look we could actually look right here in the wild training function at the actual loss value itself what the loss is I like lost my I think once I get to hours day and I like lose my ability to do this let me start this whole lost explanation in thank you Simon that's gonna be useful in a moment if I could ever get to it it's the graph is of the loss loss is a particular value a measure a metric of the training process it's a summation of how many mistakes it's making as those trained as the training data is fed through the neural network so we're again remember the training process is take a particular data point feed it through the network it's going to make a guess compare the guess to the correct answer if it's the correct answer guess what the loss is zero the error is zero if it's not it's going to be far or close to that error and by accumulating all of the errors over one Epoque that value is summarized in loss so as we can see as it's training over time the loss starts up at like a value of one point one and it gets in actually we can see here in the graph at the very end we were down to a loss of zero point zero seven thirty four to six which is a pretty good loss anytime you see a value lower than 0.1 in these kinds of scenarios it's doing particularly well and you could see the graph is starting to level off maybe I could have eat out a little bit lower loss by giving it more epochs but most likely that was good enough okay whoops finally in this rather lengthy tutorial video we are ready for the last stage prediction I have trained the model and now it's time for me to give it new data new XY coordinates and have it guess a music a note CDR e based on that coordinate and you may have noticed that as I was trading the model the data that I was giving it happened to be very distinct I wanted to learn that when my mouse is over in this corner play the notes see when my mouse is in that corner played D and towards the bottom play E but if I were to experiment with this a lot it would be very interesting to train the model with a variety of a variety of distributions of how I collect this training dataset one thing I want to do here an important feature to this example that I think I want to add now is having a sort of state so what is the state and I'm going to say the state at the beginning is collection and so in this case that's going to affect what happens you're distracting me with your sharing of YouTube videos in the slack channel I'm gonna use that state to determine what should happen in the mousepressed function so if the state is collection if the state is collection and training data otherwise if the state is prediction make a guess so I need to add the code for making a guess in a moment but let's figure out how I'm going to sort of track this state over the course of the program and I look forward to all of you who changed this to do a switch statement and show that with me at the competence so as soon as I press the key T the state should be training and then once I'm finished training the state should be prediction at the prediction stage I want to do the same thing I want to take the inputs and send them into the neural network but this time I'm not giving in a target there is no target I just want the neural networks prediction or guess and in this case because it's a classification problem I want its classification I want you and in this case because it's a classification problem so prediction is the label I'm gonna say model dot and in this case because it's a classification problem my prediction is actually classify I'm asking the model to classify so I'm going to say classify these inputs send those inputs into the model and when you're finished give me a result back in a callback so write the got results function the got result function can take multiple arguments error or results if there's an error do nothing otherwise right now let me just take a look at the results this is really nuts that I've got to collect the data every time I do it I'm definitely gonna have to find a way around that which I have one I will demonstrate that soon but I'm just going to collect it again training the model mmhmm mom loss you can do it now we are ready oh it Hardy I already it's just registering all my mouse clicks so I should probably constrain it to only registering the mouse clicks on the canvas but I'm gonna click up here I'm in the trim in the prediction stage I'm gonna click in the top left and if I click on the top left around the cluster of the notes see I should see that the highest confidence score classification that gives me back is the category C click and it's this one here the second one object 0 look at this nice I'm so glad this worked 98% confidence that that click registers a label of C let me click over here 86 percent confidence the label e so the results that come back in the results variable in the gut result function R this is the same as every other nullify function that I've demonstrated to you an ordered list of the labels sorted by confidence score so there's only there's always three possibilities each with a confidence score and it's always going to put in the array the highest confidence first just I'm just Chad because I'm over time I'm checking my phone here okay no emergency messages this example is ultimately finished I mean there's been no thoughtfulness to the interface here or why it is you might want to make something like this this is really a bit of my hello world introduction to that neural network function in ml v itself however to make this feel at least like something that has some application to it I want to add the feature that whenever I'm creating the training data it plays the musical note as I click and then when it's in the prediction stage it once again plays its guess as a musical note when I click so I'm not going to I'm gonna sort I'm not going to show you all the details of how the this is coded here I'm going to go grab code from one of my examples that uses the p5 sound library and an oscillator and the envelope class to play a musical note and then I'm gonna put that in this code and demonstrate it to you so if I go to let's see question is what's the chance that I could find this code the sound p5 jazz sound envelope sound envelope this is what I want this is the code on github for my sound envelope tutorial so I'll link to that particular video if you want to watch it but I'm just gonna start grabbing this code and putting it in my ml 5 neural network example so where where's the mouse Oh ha ha I'm adding it to the wrong example I added it to the other example let me close this wrong example goofball it's like why does this look so different let me actually capture this sound now you're getting the sound I think I want this this doesn't really sound what is it attack decay sustain just you I don't know I wanted to sound more like a piano notes somebody could give me some set range 1.2 to zero what does that do whatever someone could give me some better numbers to put in here but now I want C D or E so I need to get those frequencies yeah that's a good idea Simon I will do that also I'm waiting for like some good ASD our Valley is to do the next part on my other side okay I know I don't really need it to sound like a piano I just just sounds kind of like I want it to be a quick note this is what I want yes well that's the decay I guess I should just go back to whatever I had it for my example perfect alright this is not important to this tutorial so I'm just going to move on now that I've added an envelope and an oscillator I just call the play function every time I click the mouse and you can hear a note being played but I want to play a see a D or an e so I need to get the exact frequencies for those particular notes that I want to play I can grab them from this Wikipedia page for piano notes and I'll get middle C d4 and e4 I'm going to make an object that just has those values and so this is my lookup table based on whatever category it is I want to set the wave to that particular frequency so right before I play the envelope wave frequency frequencies based on the target let's see if this works and now it's playing CD or e based on when I click now I can pull the note which is the label associated with the first result since then sorted it's a sorted list and I can and I can set the frequency based on that note and play the envelope again and probably it would be good for me to also draw it but I'm gonna I'll leave that to you to make a much nicer interface for this and I'm just gonna finish this off by collecting the data one more time and then having it play the notes as I click around and this time maybe I'll give it a bit more of an odd this time maybe I will give it a bit more of a less obvious or for uniformly distinct spatial arrangement of the training data here we go training data time there's my data train the model I don't know if that control that got in there it's gonna break it we'll find out train the model we're started reading the chat now I just saw his read that don't over fit yeah and now let's see what happens wait huh Oh what did I forget do I have an error because of that weird Oh freak was not defined oh no oh no oh this was it all that work and I forgot the S there let me fix that and do it again Oh Oh p5 OOP OOP I didn't realize this but it's actually called I should call it p5 envelope not env train the model I finished training and now in theory it should do prediction we zoom in so you can see this a little better look it's even giving me a cnote here that's its best prediction based on all the C's up there be really interesting to visualize the the every sort of like what the value would be for every pixel that's something you should do as an exercise so imagine even though this is kind of an obvious and almost trivial scenario imagine if you were using your hands to and maybe you had a sari now this is an obvious and somewhat trivial scenario but imagine expanding on this imagine having many more notes imagine having the input to not just be a single mouse click but perhaps an XY of your tracking your hand maybe with the pose net feature of ML 5 maybe you're tracking two hands so actually training the model to learn based on four inputs your entire pose I'm gonna get to that so and then you have a lot more notes than just three you could imagine how you could expand this to start playing a musical instrument based on how you move your body and this is the sort of seeds of that idea in this very basic example there are a lot of missing pieces to this example and so the two things that I well it's really three things the things that I want to demonstrate and I'll do a followup video where I will add these features in is one I would really like to be able to a save the model I train so I could just load it back in and another sketch I want to go through training it again that's quite possible to do I also might want to just save the dataset like maybe I don't want to save the model but I want to save the data set because I want to try training it again but with slightly different parameters I don't really showed you what are the kinds of hyper parameters you can change for training the model but there are some so I want to show you saving the data saving the model and also what if I wanted to make this regression instead so right now it is always playing a very specific note only one of three possible notes but what if what I wanted to do when I clicked over here I wanted to hear an interpolation of what it sort of guess would be in this case kind of like somewhere between C and D probably I'm about halfway in between those clusters so how could what note would it play if it was returning an actual floatingpoint frequency value and this actually would be very easy for me to adjust this example mostly all I need to do is change this term from classification regression and then change the way I read the output it but I'm gonna still do that in a separate video followup that will come after this maybe try that on your own and then see what happens in the video that I it might not be released right now if you're the times you're watching this but hopefully it is alright thanks for watching and I'll see you in the next ml 5gs beginner's guide to machine learning video oh okay boy that took me all this time just a datelike make this one video tutorial I don't know I'm kidding this is this I don't know what that what what this sort of general audiences of you all of you according to my stream deck here 382 if you're watching if this was illuminating or interesting at all I would be certainly be curious for feedback I wonder so I think I probably got ahead out I'm about 45 minutes later I do kind of want to like I would love to just like rapidfire fill in those next few steps but I don't know that I really have time for that is there are there any questions I could answer that anybody has okay good I'll be your giving you're giving me nice feedback which I appreciate epic picks is oh yeah so if you want this is the nice thing is you can get this example right now so if you want to run this particular example it's at this URL maybe somebody could maybe somebody could pay post that into the chat sorry somebody who has chat privileges could do that oh can I do that no not easily do I have red in my beard no but I have gray could you do this with the makey makey yes that would be a wonderful thing to think about what other kinds of inputs could you have that are like sensor inputs so I think I don't know when I'll be back next oh I couldn't easily wear next Friday I have a guest coming and the guest I should just say who it is Shirley woo who is a data visualization artist she's gonna do a d3 tutorial so maybe I can find some time before next Friday to come back and finish doing finish doing the this example so a fluke asked a great question what is this building towards like what does this have to do going Thank You solar line or Nathan for posting the link to the code so I'm building towards maybe something that would be a musical instrument that you play with your body so ultimately the example that I want to make is I'm taking I'm the training data is I'm collecting different poses like when I stand like this it's the musical notes see when I stand like this it's a musical note D when I stand like this it's the musical note e and so then I want to I want to play a song by doing this that's what I'm building towards actually alright umm oh I don't have I can plug back I this iPad is charging a little bit and I'm not now come on iPad this is very important that I have music to play as I go leave why is this I think I used to be able to do this stuff much faster so harsh I'll ask I'm doing a master's thesis on ml and I need some help may I mail you so I get a lot of email and I very much appreciate all the emails I get and I I actually I do read them all I it's very hard for me to answer coding questions I try to prioritize I mean the sort of students who are students at NYU who are taking classes and then we also have if you're a member a slack channel where people can get help with questions you welcome to email me if but I don't I don't have a good system I would recommend more posting on a forum maybe we could create maybe the coding train discord that sort of stuff so close to 1 million I know at this pace I think I'll hit mean who knows maybe it will go down from here but I think I would hit 1 million subscribers in about 4 or 5 months so I should plan something special for that ok so I was trying to get this to play my I don't know why it won't but that's like home everything's messed up right now with my tablet here I can't get it I just wanted to play my oh I should read you some random members I'll read some random numbers 2.06 770 4831 Oh quick today's today's coding train which surely was brought to you by Lane link calm slash coding train and Linode Lenovo lynda.com slash coding train you can get a free month from lame and you can get a free $20 in credit from you know I'm as well as a discount with Lane but also today's coding train is brought to you by the random numbers seventy four thousand
