00:06 - hello good evening
00:08 - happy Friday it is me on time dare I say
00:12 - did I possibly could I possibly have
00:15 - actually hit the start button maybe
00:18 - thirty seconds early I'm checking the
00:20 - chat I don't even know if I'm
00:23 - live-streaming nobody's even said hello
00:25 - to me yeah I'm gonna go on as if I am
00:27 - and then I will feel foolish later when
00:29 - it turns out that no one has seen
00:31 - anything that I've said right now okay
00:34 - so I don't know if you are somewhere in
00:37 - the world where you could be watching
00:38 - this this live stream of the lunar
00:42 - eclipse I would suggest that you
00:44 - probably turn off watching me right now
00:47 - and go outside I don't know but whatever
00:49 - the appropriate way to watch this is
00:51 - please go and do that I guess this is an
00:54 - image from the Bereket Observatory I do
00:56 - not know where that is in the world
00:58 - somebody I'm sure will inform me rather
01:02 - quickly uh Bruno asks by the way
01:05 - Schiffman did you adjust the green
01:07 - screen filter back why yes I did I did
01:09 - adjust the green screen back and I
01:11 - thought to myself this morning
01:13 - let me not we're even though that's my
01:15 - new favorite shirt it's like blue it's
01:17 - got a flamingo on it I decide to put on
01:23 - this shirt which is you know admittedly
01:25 - my second favorite second favorite shirt
01:27 - due to the flowery nature of it but
01:31 - looking over here in my preview monitor
01:32 - where I see myself I'm a little bit
01:35 - worried about the video compression
01:37 - YouTube compression algorithm thing and
01:40 - it's possible I am I am safe I am
01:43 - wearing a safe as you know I am the kind
01:46 - of person who wears a t-shirt under the
01:48 - shirt that has been firmly established
01:51 - but I am wearing a t-shirt that can be
01:54 - shown on video today this is in fact a
01:56 - google Summer of Code 2017 t-shirt ah
02:00 - wait a second I am also well-prepared
02:03 - today with a few other we were talk
02:05 - about wardrobe let's see if this cameras
02:08 - working good this camera's organized
02:09 - something really I mean
02:11 - shocking this is like shocking you know
02:15 - sit down sit down right now if you're
02:17 - standing actually standing is probably a
02:19 - good thing
02:20 - stretching is good don't sit for too
02:22 - long don't Stanford alum move around a
02:23 - lot that's my advice in general but now
02:26 - you might want to sit down something
02:29 - insane I have never done this before
02:32 - never worn this before on a live stream
02:39 - shorts I'm wearing shorts it is very hot
02:43 - in York City actually if you are in New
02:45 - York City right now I'm gonna go out I
02:47 - mean I don't think you can hear it in
02:48 - here unfortunately I was in the hallway
02:50 - a moment ago this massive Thunder
02:53 - there's I got like the alerts on my
02:54 - phone flash flood warning so they're
02:57 - safe let's see if we can see how the
02:58 - storm is right now you can't you can you
03:01 - can hopefully hear my audio and I open
03:04 - this window for a second to give you
03:05 - some audio of the storm know about this
03:07 - window yes okay I'm not gonna be able
03:14 - open these windows you can't hear there
03:15 - was like incredible thunder anyway so
03:21 - yes
03:22 - Schwartz was saying uh yeah alright so
03:29 - oh yes heat wave heat wave some of your
03:33 - experience in quite a heat wave it's
03:34 - pretty it's not it's not a super heat
03:36 - wave here in New York but it is quite
03:36 - warm or though now it is pouring pouring
03:38 - pouring pouring rain okay so how are you
03:47 - lunar eclipse I'll put the lunar eclipse
03:50 - away you know I'm tempted to do the
03:52 - whole thing and the rocket launch thing
03:54 - and I make myself small and I'm standing
03:56 - on top of the lunar thing and blah blah
03:57 - blah but I think I I shall put it away
04:00 - for now I was gonna talk about red burns
04:03 - I have some things open you know oh
04:12 - right
04:13 - also all the things I've read to talk
04:16 - about I am here with my space Mellon I
04:20 - went to a different shop II
04:23 - that's spelled sh oppe which is the way
04:26 - I like to spell shop e where I purchased
04:30 - some of this delicious magic space melon
04:36 - this trick is getting really old or any
04:40 - good soothing cool it's a low acid hmm
04:56 - wonderful wonderful what what am I here
05:00 - I forgot Wow go to drain I was a very
05:05 - pathetic cream was all
05:17 - okay I'm a timpani sound effect
05:20 - apparently it's 27 seconds long I can
05:23 - barely hear it
05:25 - no no you can hear it you can turn it up
05:30 - much louder now it eventually gets to
05:34 - the end by coding train so coding train
05:44 - is a weekly and at the moment Friday
05:46 - evening probably next Friday evening as
05:48 - well New York City time that is YouTube
05:50 - livestream where I do I waste a lot of
05:54 - time and sometimes do so okay today I
05:58 - have a exciting JavaScript library
06:01 - project that I am planning to spend most
06:02 - of today's livestream talking about is
06:04 - called ml5 I have definitely talked
06:06 - about it before I have an idea for a
06:10 - coding challenge okay I would like to do
06:13 - but first I must thank our sponsor
06:15 - Cody crane is sponsored by water you
06:20 - know in that melon that low that high pH
06:24 - that low acid melon that you were
06:26 - crunching on and you was so delicious
06:29 - you're just like chewing up and
06:31 - swallowing it stuck in your throat
06:36 - well that's when water that's when you
06:39 - need reach for your water water it is
06:42 - liquid and when you drink it it helps do
06:49 - it helps to wash that piece of melon
06:52 - down okay you know these are the things
07:06 - I you know I should really prepare for
07:11 - these live streams which I don't I
07:13 - really should but I don't
07:15 - but even so I really want to get some
07:18 - new sound effects alright 94-degree i'm
07:22 - gonna look at the check oh we got a new
07:23 - sponsor that means I wonder if my family
07:26 - is at home that means the lights flash
07:29 - let me be I'll get a text message let's
07:31 - see welcome cryptic Thank You cryptic
07:36 - for sponsoring the channel better hurry
07:39 - before the power goes out ritually so I
07:42 - am in a large institutional building and
07:47 - I have never known the power to go out
07:49 - here of course it did back during
07:51 - hurricane sandy you know which was quite
07:53 - an extreme storm in New York City power
07:56 - goes out you'll know because there's
07:59 - nothing about what I'm doing that does
08:02 - not need power is that the right double
08:05 - negative it all needs power the moment
08:07 - the power goes out this live stream land
08:09 - and then I'll get to go home early on a
08:12 - Friday this is a special weekend for me
08:15 - let's see if anybody in the chat can
08:18 - figure out Oh Simon sorry I'm so easily
08:20 - distracted this is a problem with me and
08:22 - my life streaming but Simon just I
08:24 - assume that's a photo that Simon just
08:26 - took posted in the sponsor patreon
08:29 - actually YouTube's changing the name
08:30 - sponsor to member soon select channel
08:33 - that's a wonderful photo of Eclipse I
08:37 - wish I was there to see it I hope that
08:39 - all of you especially in Europe who are
08:40 - having heat waves and lack of rain you
08:43 - get some water soon I don't think it
08:46 - goes that direction exactly but try to
08:49 - I'm gonna try to send the rain to you
08:50 - from here all right so um I'm just
08:57 - checking the chat for a minute all right
09:00 - so I wonder if there's any new people
09:02 - here today if there's anybody new here
09:04 - sure you left already here after all my
09:09 - nonsense but the this stream is I'm
09:13 - hoping will be really well suited for
09:15 - total beginners I'm I'm doing things
09:17 - I've done things a little bit backwards
09:19 - because I'm learning stuff and trying
09:21 - different things so I am with were
09:25 - looking at ml 5 as a library I am sort
09:28 - of going but going back in time I've
09:31 - done a lot of videos and tutorials that
09:35 - goes all the way in depth but someone in
09:38 - depth into machine learning topics such
09:41 - as neural networks and even lower
09:43 - level machine learning libraries like
09:44 - tensorflow j/s and that's helped me
09:48 - hopefully build a background of
09:51 - knowledge to be able to do what I want
09:54 - to do today which is present a very
09:57 - beginner friendly machine learning
09:58 - library that lives on the surface hiding
10:02 - a lot of the lower level details it has
10:05 - its pros and it's cons of course but
10:07 - with the idea that anybody who watches
10:10 - the tutorials that I produce today could
10:13 - be a beginner and completely new to
10:16 - machine learning and follow along and to
10:19 - the extent that anybody ever learned to
10:20 - anything and watching me learn something
10:22 - so that's my that's my main goal for
10:25 - today I think I will start with that I
10:27 - have a coding challenge that I would
10:29 - like to do which is animated sprite I
10:32 - don't even think it's letting anybody
10:32 - ever suggested it came up in a meeting I
10:35 - was having yesterday and it was a I made
10:38 - an example of this years ago and I it it
10:40 - kind of comes kind of comes up a lot so
10:42 - that'll be useful to make a video about
10:43 - it so
10:48 - toothless des I guess I I'm just all
10:52 - about though sponsor you can sponsor the
10:57 - coding that's the official coding great
11:00 - sponsor scheme song
11:01 - toothless des asks how to become a
11:05 - sponsor it's like a YouTube thing you
11:06 - have to pay but you don't have to please
11:09 - no one is under any obligation
11:12 - whatsoever nobody nobody guessed the
11:20 - special quality of this weekend I'll
11:23 - reveal it at the end of the livestream I
11:29 - think this is what's going on oh the
11:33 - coffee is attacking me and by the way I
11:36 - know I do not normally drink coffee on a
11:38 - Friday evening this is a one-time thing
11:42 - some three liked a light bit of coffee
11:46 - Wow a lot of unsweetened almond milk in
11:49 - there organic not made from scratch you
11:53 - know you can make your own almond milk
11:55 - very easily
11:56 - you go to the grocery store it's their
11:58 - really expensive they put all this stuff
11:59 - in it
11:59 - do you know what you need to make almond
12:01 - milk almonds and Wow what's synergy go
12:07 - to cream brought to you by water hmm
12:11 - okay uh-oh
12:14 - Austen fish asks is it the anniversary
12:16 - of your bike accident that is a great
12:19 - guess it is not the bike accident I had
12:22 - last summer which left me with this
12:23 - beautiful scar on my elbow and the
12:26 - inability to straighten my right arm all
12:29 - the way and like all sorts of
12:32 - interesting titanium stuff that's in
12:33 - here that was I believe June 27th good
12:37 - guess though all right so it's been an
12:43 - Irish Coffee no but there will be I like
12:46 - to have that often I might be happening
12:52 - after the livestream if I can make it
12:53 - home torrential flooding of New York
12:57 - City Rostow asks first weekend in the
13:00 - new apartment
13:01 - nope good guess good guess I did move
13:03 - not the first week in the new apartment
13:05 - but good guess good guess
13:07 - good guess alright so let's see here I
13:10 - guess what I'm going to do now is ah
13:16 - Phobos gaming asked I should say is
13:19 - there a way to access the slack channel
13:20 - without paying anything
13:22 - iiiiit pains me and even read that
13:24 - question I did have the option I suppose
13:26 - of not seeing or pretending I didn't see
13:27 - it I did see it and Boas game II got it
13:33 - right by the way yes
13:36 - Phobos gaming did get it correct that is
13:38 - the correct answer pup I was answering
13:40 - Phobos gaming I feel like you know very
13:43 - very good very good good guess I was
13:52 - answering this slack channel thing at
13:54 - the moment the system that I have it's
13:56 - not the best is that the way I'm a
14:00 - funding some of the work that I'm doing
14:02 - as well as creating a smaller community
14:06 - to discuss topics and ask questions is
14:09 - through crowdfunding there are some
14:12 - plenty of unofficial not on the future
14:14 - but are plenty of ways to write comments
14:16 - or join conversation so on Twitter I'm
14:18 - gonna set up a discord I believe for the
14:20 - coding train and I'm open to suggestions
14:23 - and ideas because I do not love the idea
14:26 - of having this sort of like closed
14:27 - community but that's the way it is at
14:30 - the moment as the Sun in the background
14:34 - got a name asks Python plus plus
14:37 - thank you for your super chat donation
14:42 - and by the way when I look on my monitor
14:46 - over there and I move my arm like this
14:48 - the flower shirt starts to like flicker
14:51 - like crazy but maybe you don't actually
14:53 - see that in the livestream Simon writes
14:59 - I'm actually watching this live stream
15:01 - outside to watch the lunar eclipse I
15:03 - hope Simon that your eyes are mostly
15:07 - focused on the lunar eclipse cuz I don't
15:08 - I will be live-streaming again next week
15:10 - you know maybe I won't wear this shirt
15:12 - it's exciting also this is being
15:14 - recorded you can watch it later and the
15:16 - lunar eclipse is really a once in a
15:18 - hopefully not a once in a lifetime is it
15:20 - I don't know one night
15:24 - okay so Karim asks what do we need
15:27 - there was that super chat question did I
15:29 - answer it as the Sun background got a
15:31 - name no it does not but I do want to
15:33 - make that into mochi for sponsors is
15:35 - there uh there was a good question there
15:40 - it was something about what do you need
15:42 - okay so if you're gonna follow along
15:44 - live with me today you're going to need
15:47 - you know you could go and look at my
15:49 - workflow video I know my workflows a
15:51 - little out of date and you can register
15:53 - your complaints at the office of IDE
15:57 - complaints it's down the streets lower
16:00 - Manhattan next to the courthouse but if
16:07 - you're gonna follow along I will explain
16:11 - in the video tutorial what you need but
16:14 - just to give you in advance you're gonna
16:15 - want to text editor you're probably
16:17 - going to want to run a local server on
16:20 - your computer
16:21 - a lot of text editors will come with a
16:23 - local server I have been using the node
16:26 - local a node local server more recently
16:29 - and then you will need a browser and
16:33 - everything else is and then you'll
16:35 - probably want to grab one of my recent
16:38 - code examples it just has like the p5
16:40 - library imported into it
16:42 - you know if you just take any of my
16:43 - coding challenges and kind of like the
16:45 - recommend one from last week that's what
16:47 - I want to do forgot about that the
16:48 - recommend one from last week down grab
16:51 - that code open it up delete the leak out
16:54 - of the stuff from sketch guess you'll be
16:56 - ready to go okay so actually so before I
16:59 - get started with ml5 j/s let's go to
17:02 - twitter.com slash hashtag coding
17:06 - recommend this one didn't catch fire so
17:08 - to speak like others have but we can see
17:11 - some versions that people made this one
17:15 - by ACT Nellis drost was also inspired by
17:19 - the same number file video so created
17:21 - this last month so this is actually a
17:23 - lot of people made their own
17:24 - visualizations of the number sequence
17:25 - before I even did I love this sort of
17:28 - like the 3d quality of this the spiral
17:30 - nature that's beautiful as requested
17:34 - right to mark oh here is the best
17:38 - version I imagined
17:39 - I believe it's beautiful I would agree I
17:41 - think it's beautiful and we can see here
17:45 - this is one of the the challenges that I
17:46 - pose to the viewer to animate the arcs
17:49 - themselves so you can see this has been
17:51 - successfully done so the arcs don't just
17:53 - stamp on there but they animate this is
17:57 - mine this is from model Madeline
18:01 - Dahlberg let's click on the link and go
18:05 - look here 100 open processing org
18:08 - wonderful site to do your code and click
18:10 - on the screen then enter it enter a
18:12 - number so let's do seven great and so it
18:17 - looks like what this is you can enter a
18:19 - number we see the number sequence and we
18:21 - see the how much is there so what
18:23 - happens if I were to enter something
18:25 - really really big like 1000 Wow cool
18:30 - so I guess that's actually that's 1000
18:33 - numbers is
18:34 - there's a murder if there's a maximum
18:36 - could that doesn't seem like one
18:38 - thousand number is it that maybe it goes
18:39 - up to 1000 that's the highest number but
18:42 - anyway I love the interactivity of this
18:44 - great work Madeline
18:47 - now I'm going to look at this I like
18:50 - these that just like try a different
18:51 - visual idea some straight lines from
18:55 - Earth on Twitter audio-visual and
18:58 - c-major okay we've got a listen to this
19:02 - okay I don't know how well you can hear
19:04 - that it's nice so I assume here the
19:13 - difference between what I did first of
19:15 - all in terms of thinking about how to
19:16 - design the quality of the sound in terms
19:18 - of the configuration of the envelope
19:20 - also there's actually applying C major
19:23 - scale here I'm gonna get some more
19:25 - slightly more musical quality out of it
19:28 - audio-visual representation
19:32 - I should really hook up the sound it'll
19:36 - just take me a second don't know why I'm
19:37 - being so if I go here and then I click
19:40 - on multi output device the sound goes
19:42 - through this is nice I like being able
19:47 - to see the things I like about this
19:48 - I love being let's see the number I love
19:50 - seeing like where the where we are in
19:54 - the sequence you know mine was kind of
19:55 - interesting in how it was like scaling
19:57 - automatically but I do love I like that
20:04 - it's fixed here as well this is really
20:07 - nice great work by Tom fedley a learned
20:12 - a new name today recommen the coding
20:16 - recommend challenge here's one I've met
20:18 - some nice use of color this is actually
20:21 - really nice one of the things that's a
20:22 - sort of failing of mine is that it looks
20:25 - like there's so many circles because the
20:27 - the arcs get so close to each other on
20:30 - the top and the bottom but if you alter
20:32 - the color you can see the more spiral
20:34 - nature of it so that's a nice that's
20:36 - nice work and then there's this one from
20:39 - Ahmad and I like this I like being able
20:42 - to see the number line like so including
20:44 - the number line actually there
20:46 - is a nice visual addition to this I
20:48 - think great work everybody so in
20:51 - addition you can still post your your
20:55 - versions of the recommend
20:56 - coding challenge to hashtag coding
20:58 - recommen on twitter you can tag me at
21:00 - Schiffman it helps me find it I don't
21:03 - necessarily just check the hashtag but
21:04 - also I will let's see I think there's at
21:06 - least one if I go to the coding train
21:09 - comm and then I go to coding challenges
21:12 - and right here to recommend sequence and
21:15 - I go here this is also a place you know
21:20 - that Twitter stuff is sort of nice and
21:21 - in theory it might be there you know
21:25 - still next week but this is a place
21:27 - where you can also add your own
21:29 - community contribution through a pull
21:31 - request on github there are some
21:33 - instructions here if you if you click on
21:36 - see how we can see one and what's nice
21:38 - about this is you can include your
21:40 - source code plus plus information about
21:42 - you and your version so let's look at
21:44 - animated arc and here we go and this one
21:48 - I love this what beautiful round of
21:52 - applause for putting it on code pen so
21:57 - it's nice to see this on code pen and
22:00 - this really is we've got this animated
22:03 - animated arc there it's wonderful
22:06 - wonderful work everybody okay so this is
22:09 - one of things I enjoy the most one thing
22:11 - I really enjoy about my week is getting
22:12 - to check out the versions of things that
22:14 - people make for what I made okay I think
22:20 - now we are ready for ml5 j/s I must have
22:28 - a piece of melon I'm going to
22:31 - investigate the chat for a minute
22:33 - oh there's Joss SEC W is in the chat I
22:37 - apologize if I'm mispronouncing your
22:39 - name if anybody wants to phonetically
22:42 - spell it for me
22:48 - that would be helpful burgerbob is
22:51 - asking what about changing your workflow
22:53 - in this stream you know I shout out to
22:55 - Austin from the patron group who has
22:58 - really been soaked
22:59 - mind in understanding because he's made
23:03 - many good points about things that I
23:05 - could do to upgrade my workflow to make
23:07 - things not just well Makela make things
23:10 - easier for me and I'm kind of have a bit
23:13 - of a mental block with this stuff and I
23:16 - tend to not get to it
23:17 - I don't I keep me honest folks viewers
23:21 - out there let's see if I can schedule a
23:24 - specific live stream dedicated only to
23:27 - that sometime before the start of the
23:30 - fall semester which is the day after
23:32 - Labor Day here in New York City in Labor
23:36 - Day holiday in the United States
23:37 - I can't September fourth fifth something
23:39 - like that so bug me about it tweet me
23:43 - call YouTube comment me I think I need
23:46 - to I think the only way I'm gonna do it
23:47 - is if I schedule it as a specific
23:50 - dedicated livestream otherwise it's just
23:52 - gonna be the thing at them I would say
23:53 - like oh yeah I'm gonna get to that today
23:54 - but first let me do these things I'll
23:56 - never get to it it'll be at the bottom
23:57 - of the list
23:59 - our Simon is writing artist color in the
24:02 - gaps of the pattern and then it becomes
24:03 - more colorful yes so um if you watch the
24:06 - numberphile video there is a particular
24:08 - artist who has made kind of coloring
24:11 - pages out of the recommend number
24:13 - sequence and filled in and they're
24:15 - beautiful I encourage you to go check
24:16 - that out and it's interesting to think
24:18 - is there a way to do that with through
24:22 - processing or html5 canvas and p5 would
24:24 - be an interesting challenge although I
24:25 - love the hand-drawn quality of that
24:28 - stuff okay
24:29 - processing 3.4 released that's another
24:32 - thing that's worth let's let's take a
24:33 - look where do we find where are those
24:37 - release notes so there is a new
24:41 - processing and I just think it's worth
24:43 - showing this because I think if I go
24:46 - here I think the release notes let's go
24:50 - to releases
24:52 - yes they're here so this is something by
24:56 - the way if you're not in the habit of
24:58 - reading if you're like a processing user
25:00 - and you're really interested in what's
25:02 - new what's fixed following the
25:03 - development of it I highly recommend
25:05 - always reading these release notes
25:07 - whenever and a version like three point
25:09 - four
25:10 - means more significant changes than just
25:13 - going from like three point three point
25:15 - seven to three point three point eight
25:16 - this has to do with something called
25:18 - semantic versioning it's a numbering
25:20 - system you know if it was version 4.0
25:22 - we'd all be you know opening bottles of
25:25 - champagne and shooting confetti cannons
25:27 - into the air and just like dancing like
25:31 - it's like we're so whatever dancing II
25:35 - but yeah this is just uh and it was like
25:38 - what three point three point eight from
25:40 - people improving for at seven we would
25:41 - enjoy but three point for coding train
25:45 - whistle for processing three point four
25:48 - all right huge batch of bug fixes and
25:51 - updates a bunch of things for Windows
25:54 - better handling in the contributions
25:56 - manager for sites that use HTTP I think
25:59 - actually this broke I I think some of my
26:02 - libraries and example bundles are broken
26:05 - currently because of that maybe they've
26:06 - been fixed or I need to do something
26:08 - alternate error message on Windows do
26:13 - features it's possible to make your own
26:15 - a theme file for processing whoa that is
26:21 - cool that is really cool copy the theme
26:26 - dot txt file from inside the processing
26:29 - folder to your sketchbook and edit away
26:31 - for instance to make a dark theme
26:33 - there's this link here which I would
26:34 - love to go look at I've got I want to
26:36 - just do all this stuff today but I well
26:37 - it's possible to copy the text of the
26:40 - status bar that's wonderful that's super
26:43 - useful py de as a supported extension so
26:47 - double clicking Python sketches will
26:48 - launch the PDE Wow they add added added
26:52 - double and long versions of the data
26:55 - classes
26:56 - [Music]
27:07 - internal sort fix the welcome dialog
27:12 - redesign the rename window I can want to
27:15 - look at all this stuff
27:15 - rewrite request image now uses a new
27:19 - version Java updated the copyright and
27:23 - year and launched an about string and
27:25 - then here we go give go hi otherwise
27:29 - known as Gottfried a hand because there
27:35 - are a lot of new things in the Raspberry
27:37 - Pi version process guess what I have I
27:40 - have a I have a project I really want to
27:43 - do sorry I can't figure out the camera
27:48 - went off and it relates to what Ava Ava
27:54 - and the chat just asked will you ever do
27:57 - any some Arduino stuff I do want to do
27:59 - some Raspberry Pi stuff and one of the
28:01 - things I really want to do is I moved to
28:03 - a new apartment and one of the ways that
28:06 - I can't well when I was taking my son to
28:08 - camp we were there were like two buses
28:11 - we could take but you had to go like you
28:14 - couldn't go to one stop and wait for
28:15 - both of them and the MC has this like
28:17 - bus time app so I can like check and see
28:19 - where the buses are we could say oh this
28:20 - one's here this one's here so we could
28:23 - kind of like figure out which bus to go
28:24 - to but if you actually just go to like
28:26 - the bus station are now in the subways
28:28 - they have things like boards that show
28:30 - the next train the time I would like to
28:31 - build one of those for my apartment that
28:33 - just like I can configure it just these
28:35 - two bus routes and these two subway
28:37 - routes I want to see like when all the
28:39 - next trains on the next buses are in
28:40 - order in one display and I so the one
28:43 - thing I don't know I should have checked
28:45 - this before mentioning it is does the
28:47 - MTA provide that real-time data through
28:50 - an API I know that they published the
28:52 - schedules but the schedules is very
28:54 - different than the actual real-time data
28:55 - see I don't publish that real-time data
28:57 - I think through an official API I think
29:00 - I can't make this project but if they do
29:01 - I certainly can and I would the reason
29:04 - why I was thinking this is like me
29:05 - dipping a toe into physical computing
29:06 - because I would love to just make a
29:07 - little um you know get one of those
29:09 - inexpensive I assume they're inexpensive
29:11 - like
29:11 - led well I know those things are called
29:15 - those displays that just show like a
29:18 - certain number of characters and there's
29:20 - little grids of little dots there's a
29:23 - name probably let me get one of those
29:24 - Flipboard things wouldn't that be
29:26 - amazing to build a Flipboard but that's
29:28 - that's way that's there I there's no
29:29 - chance I'm ever gonna manage to do that
29:32 - so melon goggles right Stan I don't
29:38 - really mean but you have been streaming
29:40 - for 30 minutes without telling us
29:41 - anything about the actual subject okay
29:43 - that's a very good point I mean I did
29:50 - mention what the topic was going to be
29:53 - so 7 segment display right sausage so
29:57 - much stuff is going on I can't process
29:58 - all this now I'm getting information
30:00 - about how to pronounce ah oh my god okay
30:09 - I can't play that right now that is no
30:12 - good that's no good
30:13 - ml5 all right all right people are so
30:16 - excited about MFO let's do it
30:19 - apologies so I you know you you're yeah
30:22 - okay so just see me like a couple
30:24 - minutes I'm gonna do ml5 next oh I'm
30:35 - gonna cycle the cameras
30:48 - you know I have to say if you really
30:50 - yeah I might recommend waiting for the
30:52 - edited version of the videos but a lot
30:55 - of you are here and you came I did
30:57 - advertise this as ml5 so let be let me
31:01 - get that going all right so let's think
31:06 - about this it's a good if I prepared
31:10 - wouldn't it be good if I prepare it I
31:12 - think I can I have a bit in my head what
31:14 - I want to talk so this is good so I'm
31:18 - just gonna begin hello welcome to a
31:31 - playlist of videos about machine
31:33 - learning this is a playlist of videos
31:35 - about machine learning for hopefully you
31:38 - who are you maybe you could be anybody
31:41 - you could be like watching this in the
31:43 - year twenty sixty seven from your
31:46 - recliner self-driving quadcopter and
31:51 - you've you've taken your brain out of
31:53 - these sawing hello welcome to a new
32:10 - playlist of videos this is a playlist I
32:12 - mean you know hopefully there's a bunch
32:13 - of videos in this playlist because I'm
32:15 - just starting to record them now so they
32:17 - don't exist yet but this is about
32:18 - machine learning and it is for the total
32:21 - beginner now there are some caveats here
32:23 - I suppose to that but I really wanted to
32:25 - make something you don't have to have
32:26 - watched any other videos about machine
32:28 - learning on my channel I have others
32:29 - that go more in depth and use different
32:31 - tools this is really meant if you're
32:32 - starting it's totally new to you you
32:34 - heard you've heard the words machine
32:37 - learning you type them into some search
32:41 - bar and have some how you landed here
32:44 - watching from the future leaning back
32:46 - you're you've taken your brain out for
32:48 - its afternoon thawing and you're
32:51 - gelatinous couch is comfortably
32:54 - supporting your skillet skeletal a
32:59 - anyway the point is you're here I'm here
33:01 - hello so I'm going to be using for the
33:05 - set of tutorials a pretty new JavaScript
33:08 - library called ml five the purpose of
33:10 - this first video in the series is really
33:12 - just to talk about two things what is
33:14 - machine learning
33:15 - what is ml five so the one caveat I
33:18 - would say possibly to being a beginner
33:20 - here is that you probably want to have
33:23 - some knowledge and experience with
33:25 - coding itself now that isn't to say that
33:27 - you aren't if you don't you're welcome
33:29 - here please watch I will point you to
33:31 - other videos that can help you fill in
33:34 - some missing gaps but I'm going to
33:35 - assume a little bit of knowledge about
33:36 - programming particularly in JavaScript
33:39 - and I'm also going to be making fairly
33:41 - heavy use of another JavaScript library
33:43 - called p5 so if p5 is new to you I'll
33:46 - refer you to some other p5 tutorials I
33:48 - will but that's going to be a larger
33:51 - large piece of how I build various
33:53 - examples throughout all these videos
33:57 - pause for a second I paid that brain
34:03 - joke before apparently it's like a thing
34:05 - that's always like floating in my head I
34:07 - mean I know it yeah okay wait wait this
34:12 - is the part I was gonna yeah everybody I
34:16 - know exactly what I want to do to talk
34:19 - about ml 5 but I actually like I
34:24 - realized I don't really have in my head
34:26 - prepared a really nice extinct 10,000
34:34 - steps you see that animation you can it
34:38 - goes the way there you go
34:40 - definition of machine learning guess
34:42 - what I would consider his inputs outputs
34:49 - making sense of date a computer to
34:53 - perform a task to learn to perform a
34:55 - task
34:56 - give me your one set in the chat give me
35:01 - your one sentence definition of machine
35:04 - learning you know what I've actually I
35:09 - should just go to my
35:15 - where is that I had such momentum I
35:18 - should never pause from the content
35:21 - where am I going what am I looking for
35:35 - either some notes that I made yeah looks
35:41 - right field of study this is the classic
35:44 - definition Arthur Samuels machine make
35:53 - machines to learn make computers do my
35:55 - homework what does a neural network so
36:01 - interesting to see everybody's telling
36:03 - machines have do stuff that you don't do
36:04 - it yourself yeah that's actually good
36:07 - that's a good idea
36:08 - a form of artificial perms then to learn
36:10 - on its own yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah
36:13 - these are all great wow these are really
36:15 - good self learning a ID to make it tough
36:17 - go the best ball
36:27 - all right so I'm gonna try to explain it
36:30 - in my own words now just give me a
36:41 - second here replying to messages all
36:49 - right
36:57 - so before I get into what is ml5 which
37:00 - is really the core the probably the core
37:03 - component of this video let's just take
37:06 - a moment to ask ourselves the question
37:08 - what is machine learning
37:10 - here's the thing it's my hope that just
37:13 - I don't need to define that right now
37:15 - because the point of this set of
37:17 - tutorials is to kind of explore that
37:19 - question all along what is machine
37:22 - learning but we need a place to start
37:24 - from and so one thing that's I think
37:28 - important to realize and is that there
37:32 - are a lot of terms that you might have
37:34 - heard one thing that's I think one thing
37:41 - that I think is important to note is
37:42 - that there are a lot of there's a lot of
37:44 - terminology machine learning artificial
37:46 - intelligence deep learning neural
37:47 - networks support vector machines etc I
37:50 - could keep going what are all these
37:51 - things means some are algorithms some
37:53 - are topics of research and so I think
37:58 - I'm really struggling with this really
38:07 - struggling with this go back to it
38:09 - always this is this is the stuff that
38:12 - had the hardest time with because I'm so
38:14 - petrified of saying something like sort
38:18 - of revealing myself like really dumb no
38:21 - idea what I'm talking about which has
38:22 - already been revealed many times ok so
38:26 - before I start talking to you about what
38:28 - is ml5 which is really what I'm here to
38:32 - do let's just ask ourselves a question
38:33 - you know first ones called ml 5 ml for
38:36 - machine learning what is machine
38:37 - learning now there are a lot of lots of
38:39 - terminology out there machine learning
38:41 - deep learning artificial intelligence
38:43 - neural networks the list goes on and on
38:45 - and hopefully the definition that
38:48 - whatever I say to you right now doesn't
38:50 - really matter
38:50 - because we're going to sort of explore
38:52 - this topic of machine learning and all
38:54 - these other other all this other
38:56 - terminology throughout these videos but
38:58 - I think one thing to realize about
38:59 - machine learning you think of this idea
39:01 - of artificial intelligence computers
39:03 - robots taking over the world and they've
39:05 - learned their own language and they're
39:06 - defeating our but you know really what
39:10 - comes down to it brass tacks so to speak
39:13 - machine learning is examining some data
39:16 - a whole lot of numbers and trying to
39:20 - make sense of that data and teaching a
39:22 - computer basically to learn patterns
39:26 - that we can present that's really a and
39:28 - we're not talking about something called
39:29 - supervised learning Europe or even more
39:31 - terminology supervised learning where
39:33 - I'm gonna get I'm gonna get into all
39:34 - that and I've gotten into some of that
39:35 - in other videos you know it'd be good to
39:39 - look at
39:58 - so I just pulled up some notes that I
40:01 - made for a course about artificial
40:04 - intelligence and and and at NYU here and
40:08 - this is sort of the classic definition
40:11 - of machine learning from 1959
40:15 - Arthur Samuels a field of study that
40:18 - gives computers the ability to learn
40:20 - without being explicitly programmed and
40:22 - so let's think about that for a second
40:25 - this is actually useful and I'm gonna
40:27 - get into ml5 in a second but just just a
40:29 - little bit longer right
40:32 - I might say something like the most
40:36 - simplistic sense I could write a program
40:39 - that has a specific algorithm that says
40:43 - if Mouse X is greater than so let's say
40:50 - this this window has a width between
40:51 - zero and four hundred if Mouse X is
40:54 - greater than 200 then that is the right
40:59 - side can you see this yes greater than
41:03 - 200 is the right side else if Mouse X is
41:07 - less than 200 or just else that's the
41:09 - left side this is me providing the
41:13 - computer so to speak I've written a
41:15 - program with some intelligence it knows
41:17 - how to tell if a point is on the right
41:20 - side or the left side of the window I
41:22 - have written the algorithm for that well
41:24 - machine learning is about teaching a
41:27 - system to understand a data without
41:32 - explicitly writing your own algorithm
41:34 - this might be the most trivial
41:35 - simplistic algorithm ever but the way I
41:39 - would do machine learning is I would say
41:41 - hey machine learning system I'm going to
41:46 - give you lots of information like 350 is
41:49 - on the right side and 301 is on the
41:52 - right side and 212 is on the right side
41:54 - and 273 is on the right side and 100 is
41:57 - on the left side and 97 is on the left
42:00 - side and 24 is on the left side and 198
42:03 - is on the left side I'm creating a data
42:05 - set and I'm just gonna say here's a lot
42:07 - of stuff I'm not gonna
42:08 - how to don't I'm not gonna give you some
42:10 - specific hard-coded algorithm to know
42:12 - what's on the right or the left I'm just
42:14 - going to create a data set it's going to
42:16 - have a lot of information in it and the
42:18 - machine is going to learn the patterns
42:21 - in that data learn how to make some kind
42:24 - of prediction that's a key word here the
42:27 - prediction being is this point on the
42:29 - right are left based on that data this
42:31 - is the essence of machine learning
42:33 - teaching a computer to perform a task
42:37 - without explicitly programming the
42:40 - algorithm for that task now there's a
42:43 - little convoluted cuz aren't we
42:44 - programming the machine learning
42:45 - algorithm and a sort of program but this
42:48 - is the conceptual idea okay let's see
43:01 - [Music]
43:04 - alright oops wrong camera alright so
43:08 - let's see here mmm
43:12 - okay all right
43:19 - [Music]
43:25 - Siraj who knows probably more about this
43:30 - than i do is in the chat hello Sirach
43:34 - okay so let's see here how do anybody
43:41 - want to like offer any like significant
43:42 - complaints about that sort of like
43:44 - introductory idea i am all ears
43:49 - I'm looking for my eraser I can't find
43:54 - it because I didn't teach erase it all
43:55 - right all right this is the thing when a
44:03 - lot of the stuff that I've done during
44:06 - the heat during this during the semester
44:09 - like when NYU is actually in session I I
44:16 - usually like will teach some sessions
44:18 - during the day or the day before and
44:21 - then come in
44:22 - the YouTube videos so I've had a sense
44:23 - to sort of like try to explain some
44:25 - stuff and have gotten some feedback
44:26 - people ask questions and I feel like I
44:29 - sort of have a little bit more on my
44:31 - feet under me I think that's probably
44:33 - not true I'm probably just as what's
44:40 - let's leave it at that and I'm gonna
44:43 - move on to where I'm a little bit more
44:44 - comfortable just talking about what is
44:45 - ml 5 y a melon goggles makes a really
44:49 - good point somebody I just think if I
44:52 - can only remember these things when I'm
44:53 - here I guess I could go to amazon.com
44:55 - and buy a cloth right now melon goggle
44:58 - says I should buy a cloth what should I
45:02 - look for for a cloth someone just tweet
45:07 - me a link to like a cloth I should get
45:10 - I'll buy it just can't remember it right
45:13 - now all right all right okay whoops
45:18 - I lost the chat here okay all right
45:28 - alright alright alright here we go
45:40 - there we go okay so now that we've sort
45:47 - of vague terms it's best that I could
45:50 - covered very high-level Brooke okay so
45:58 - now that we as best as I could
46:00 - made some definition created a
46:03 - definition of machine learning one that
46:04 - the least we can start with and I'm sure
46:06 - I'll hear from you in the comments let's
46:08 - talk about what is ml five so before I
46:10 - talk about what is ml five I want to
46:11 - just mention someone to you red burns
46:13 - who is the founder of the program where
46:15 - I currently teach called ITP red burns
46:19 - is a huge was a huge source of
46:21 - inspiration she was a mentor to me and I
46:23 - wanted to start say I wanted to read a
46:25 - few quotes and we actually have a whole
46:26 - book of red burns quotes but these I
46:28 - think these quotes are really important
46:30 - and they are the kind of driving
46:32 - principles behind a lot of the work that
46:33 - I do but in particular a lot of the
46:36 - reasons and behind the ml5 project so
46:40 - technology is not enough consider the
46:45 - technology I should really move the
46:47 - mouse technology is not enough consider
46:52 - the technology as a tool which in itself
46:55 - could do nothing treat the technology as
46:58 - something that everyone on the team
46:59 - could learn understand and explore
47:02 - freely so this is really important don't
47:08 - believe the hype that expectant people
47:10 - say but it's easy to get caught up in
47:13 - the shining technology stuff but we have
47:16 - to remember that without human beings
47:21 - here on this planet what's the point so
47:24 - while I'm really interested and I get
47:26 - lost in my like interest in just sort of
47:27 - numbers and algorithms and patterns and
47:29 - things like that that's I think a core
47:32 - value that I want to make sure I stay
47:34 - grounded to throughout any time that I'm
47:36 - looking at algorithms and thinking about
47:38 - how to how to use technology how to
47:40 - teach technology how to make use of it
47:41 - so this is actually from an article from
47:45 - the ITP journal adjacent there will be a
47:46 - link to this in this video's description
47:48 - which describes sort of the background
47:51 - about the Machine ml5 project itself at
47:54 - the
47:55 - the end of this video I want to talk
47:56 - about various people who made
47:57 - contributions which I have here on this
47:59 - links I will do that but but but let's
48:01 - talk about what is ml5 so in order to
48:04 - kind of figure out what ml5 is I'm going
48:08 - to try to make some diagrams this is
48:13 - gonna be great I can feel it right now
48:15 - so I'm gonna put ml 5 right here in the
48:18 - center now an important component of
48:22 - this discussion is a library called
48:26 - p5.js another really important component
48:31 - of this discussion I'm gonna put it up
48:33 - here is a library called tensorflow yes
48:37 - and oh boy oh boy
48:41 - another really important part of this
48:44 - discussion is just the library
48:47 - tensorflow itself as well as you know
48:50 - maybe sort of this thing called Kerris
48:52 - which i might refer to so first of all
48:55 - what is ml 5 j s ml 5 GS itself is just
48:59 - a JavaScript library it is a library of
49:07 - functions that you can call from your
49:09 - own JavaScript code so again I mentioned
49:12 - that I'm gonna rely heavily on p5 p5 is
49:16 - also just a JavaScript library p5 is a
49:18 - little bit of a special JavaScript
49:21 - library make a little heart there couple
49:24 - stars because it is really I it doesn't
49:28 - necessarily conform to the standard
49:30 - patterns you might find in other
49:32 - JavaScript libraries it makes a lot of
49:34 - decisions to be as friendly and
49:35 - welcoming and well-suited for a beginner
49:38 - as it can be so one of things you could
49:39 - do in regular in p5 is you can write a
49:42 - function called set up and any code that
49:48 - you put in set up executes the moment
49:51 - the program starts you can write a
49:53 - function called draw and any code that
49:57 - you put in draw happens in a loop over
50:00 - and over again this is this standard
50:02 - kind of design pattern for writing a
50:04 - program that generates an animation
50:08 - like a game or a piece of interactive
50:09 - art so what I'm saying here is that my
50:12 - examples that I'm going to show you in
50:13 - these video tutorials are using p5.js
50:16 - almost that's like it did the base
50:17 - starting point and then I am also going
50:20 - to import the ml5 library so I need to
50:23 - import both of these libraries and I'll
50:27 - show you how to do that in the in the
50:29 - HTML file which is something you'll see
50:31 - in the code examples and once I have the
50:34 - ml5 library I can start to do things
50:36 - like this ml 5 image classifier and then
50:41 - so this is a function setup is something
50:45 - that sort of specific to p5 draw is
50:48 - something specific to p5 and then image
50:51 - classifier well we kind of know it's
50:53 - specific to ml 5 because I had to write
50:55 - ml five dot image classifier so this is
50:57 - one thing a little bit attached which is
51:01 - no surprise if you watched my videos
51:03 - before but a lot of JavaScript libraries
51:06 - are namespace meaning if I'm going to
51:07 - call a function like the image
51:09 - classification function I've got to say
51:10 - that name the library dot that function
51:13 - name so image classification this is one
51:15 - of the common tasks of common machine
51:18 - learning tasks right I'm gonna say hey
51:21 - machine learning here are some images of
51:23 - kitty-cats here are some images of puppy
51:26 - dogs learn about them so and we're gonna
51:29 - see how you could do that exact kind of
51:31 - tasks with ml 5 itself ok so this is the
51:34 - basic idea
51:36 - now why did why am I talking about this
51:41 - so here's the thing if you just were
51:44 - wandering around the streets of I don't
51:46 - know Venice Italy I thought of that
51:49 - there are dance streets there no it's
51:51 - all like oh my god that's crazy
51:54 - you're you're paddling through the
51:57 - canals of Venice Italy and you go to the
52:01 - little canoe sound that got no the boat
52:03 - next to and you say do you know how to
52:05 - do machine learning
52:07 - I'm a probably oh you just go use a
52:09 - thing called tensorflow now this is
52:11 - possible they say something like oh you
52:12 - just go use this other thing called like
52:14 - pite or something else but there are
52:18 - many
52:19 - many examples of library's most open
52:23 - source libraries that have a lot of
52:25 - functionality for common machine
52:27 - learning tasks one of the most well
52:29 - known ones of those is called tensorflow
52:32 - this is a project from Google it is open
52:36 - source and most of the time if you were
52:40 - using it you would be writing code in
52:42 - the Python programming language well in
52:45 - my tutorials I'll be writing code in the
52:47 - JavaScript programming languages
52:49 - programming language not in Python well
52:52 - amazingly there happens to be this other
52:55 - thing called tensorflow TAS also
52:59 - developed by Google researchers I will
53:01 - include a lot of information about how
53:03 - you can find out more information about
53:04 - Tesla just and the creative potential
53:06 - address in the video description but
53:08 - this is a version of tensorflow written
53:12 - in JavaScript down truth tensorflow it's
53:15 - really rotten C++ code so even when you
53:18 - write your code in Python it's just like
53:19 - running other stuff that's C++ but
53:22 - that's not the case with tetra fluro
53:23 - Chet touch your floor digest is
53:24 - everything's happening in JavaScript and
53:26 - ml 5 an N and you could go and just use
53:30 - tensorflow digest directly to do your
53:32 - machine learning stuff and I have some
53:34 - video tutorials that talk about that but
53:36 - ml 5 is a project that actually wrap
53:40 - that is a layer it includes tensorflow
53:43 - digest so ml 5 is a library where
53:46 - additional functions were added on top
53:49 - of tensorflow TAS to make certain tasks
53:52 - easier and in truth this is a low-level
53:55 - library meaning if you were to use it
53:57 - directly you have to really worry about
53:59 - things like memory management and uh and
54:03 - it's kind of stuff you know it's
54:06 - interesting you can do it but if you're
54:09 - just getting started and want to learn
54:11 - the basics of machine learning and
54:12 - experimented play this is going to be in
54:15 - your way it's gonna make things take
54:16 - longer and so ml 5 is going is a let's
54:19 - goal is to make a lot of the things that
54:22 - you're doing tensorflow digest a bit
54:24 - easier and more accessible ok pause for
54:30 - a second I went on way too long
54:41 - there's a lot of links I love how
54:44 - there's all these the links for the
54:46 - cloth in the chat I'll come back to
54:49 - those later I Dan unfortunately I don't
54:55 - have a good concise I will be doing a
54:57 - live stream also next Friday probably
54:58 - the same exact time and but you have to
55:05 - subscribe to the channel and click the
55:07 - alerts thing that's the best way to know
55:08 - when I'm doing a live stream because
55:09 - you'll get a notification when I
55:10 - schedule it
55:12 - yo yo soy in the chat asks memory
55:15 - management on J s WTF well actually it
55:21 - doesn't seem strange but because a a
55:23 - tension flow at GS is it's actually
55:26 - manipulating data on the GPU directly
55:29 - you have to create these things called
55:32 - tensors and then you have to deallocate
55:34 - the memory when you're done with them
55:36 - and you can watch my other videos about
55:37 - that if you're interested ok ok alright
55:52 - okay so here's the other thing that I
55:55 - really want to discuss there are three I
56:01 - would say I'm gonna give you I'm gonna
56:02 - talk about three components of the
56:04 - fields of machine learning right now
56:08 - there are particular machine learning
56:11 - algorithms one example of that is
56:14 - something that you might have heard of
56:15 - called a neural network this is an
56:18 - algorithm to perform a machine learning
56:20 - task there are many other examples of
56:24 - algorithms there are also there's
56:27 - something known as machine learning
56:28 - models and in particular there's this
56:32 - idea of a pre trained model okay so I
56:37 - want to talk about that in a second and
56:39 - then of course we have this idea of data
56:43 - and data sets so I'm going to circle
56:47 - this here for a moment I'm going to put
56:50 - my stars next to it because this is
56:54 - essentially where we will begin you and
56:58 - me and the people from the future who
57:00 - are watching this video or they'll have
57:02 - time traveled into the paths I don't
57:04 - know whatever this is where we're gonna
57:06 - begin now most machine a lot of machine
57:09 - learning tutorials will start with
57:11 - something like AI now we will look at
57:12 - linear regression it's kind of similar
57:14 - to that thing where I was like I had
57:15 - that line in the middle of the window or
57:16 - the points on the right or the left and
57:18 - we're gonna do linear growth and
57:21 - statistical components of machine
57:23 - learning algorithms but one of the
57:27 - things that is happening in the world
57:30 - today the reason why I'm hoping that
57:32 - this video tutorial and this ml5 library
57:35 - is important and useful is that our
57:37 - lives are increasingly being governed by
57:44 - pre trained models corporations train
57:47 - models to perform a particular task to
57:49 - recognize your face to turn the words
57:52 - you're speaking into text there are
57:56 - questionable as many questionably
57:58 - ethical applications of this there are
58:01 - also fun artistic and playful
58:03 - applications of this so one of the ways
58:05 - to get started as a beginner to machine
58:07 - learning is actually not to learn all
58:10 - the math and learn how to train all your
58:11 - own machine learning systems but to
58:14 - actually make use of some pre trained
58:16 - models that are out there for example
58:18 - the thing that I'll start with in the
58:20 - next video is a model called mobile net
58:22 - this is a model that's been trained to
58:26 - recognize the content of images but
58:28 - there are lots of images that I could
58:29 - show to that model that it will have no
58:31 - knowledge about and other ones that will
58:33 - have wierdly have a incredibly obscure
58:35 - detailed knowledge about why is that
58:38 - well what was the data that was used to
58:40 - train that model what was the algorithm
58:42 - what algorithm is that model using these
58:45 - are the critical important questions
58:47 - that we of citizens of this world
58:50 - increasingly governed and controlled by
58:52 - software need to feel confident and
58:54 - capable of asking and so by taking the
58:58 - get by friendly and accessible or
59:00 - approachable ways of being able to
59:03 - experiment with pre trained models this
59:05 - is a good place to start so this is
59:07 - where the video tutorial series will
59:09 - start and later as I go forward I will
59:14 - also hopefully look at what does it mean
59:17 - to create your own data set what does it
59:19 - mean to use a particular algorithm with
59:22 - your own data to make your own model and
59:24 - save that model so this is pretty much
59:27 - the overview and the machine learning is
59:29 - the thing have to do with numbers it has
59:32 - to do with and and the thing we're going
59:35 - to start with this something called
59:35 - supervised learning really so the idea
59:38 - of we're training a system to learn from
59:41 - existing known data so that it can work
59:43 - with new data and that will I don't know
59:53 - what I was just talking about there
59:57 - look at that crazy diagram alright so
60:07 - machine learning is a thing you the
60:10 - thing people are talking about we want
60:12 - to get some experience playing around of
60:14 - it experimenting with it understanding
60:17 - what it is we're going to use this ml5
60:19 - library I'm gonna show you how to import
60:21 - it I'm going to show you how to import
60:23 - it into a p5.js sketch and I'm gonna
60:25 - show you how to start to use pre trained
60:27 - models and we're gonna look at what
60:29 - those models do well what they don't do
60:31 - well where do they come from why do they
60:33 - exist where do they come from and why do
60:40 - they exist okay so actually before I go
60:42 - let's look at a couple more things and
60:45 - by the way when I say go you can just
60:47 - click Next I'll be in the next video or
60:50 - you could go to something else but okay
60:52 - coming over here oh shoot sorry I
61:05 - shouldn't read the chat okay alright so
61:11 - I encourage you before you watch the
61:13 - next video what I would encourage you to
61:14 - do is actually just click around the ml5
61:16 - website I probably would have made sense
61:18 - for me to do that's like I kind of
61:20 - overview that would make sense but
61:22 - really what I want to look at here just
61:23 - really quickly as these examples and
61:26 - there's a bunch of examples here and I'm
61:28 - gonna I'm gonna talk about all these
61:29 - different terms what's a classifier
61:31 - what's what's regression what's an LS TM
61:34 - what style transfer but the bunch of
61:37 - these used there are there's a bunch of
61:39 - pre train models already supported and
61:41 - this is where I'll start with in the
61:42 - video tutorials we're gonna look at pre
61:44 - chain models for image classification
61:45 - I'm gonna look at pre train models for
61:49 - generating text for a style transfer for
61:53 - something called pics two pics pose net
61:56 - pose and is amazing let me just I got
62:01 - distracted by the super chat because I
62:03 - don't know what I like so I see I see
62:06 - this like large number kind of freaked
62:08 - out Thank You Valerie but I threw some
62:12 - currency where it's a reasonable
62:13 - reasonable amount okay
62:15 - would love to hear your talks about
62:17 - genetic algorithm and reinforcement
62:18 - learning q-learning yeah I would love to
62:21 - hear that too
62:22 - I'll see if I can get to that eventually
62:25 - we come back and do this part over again
62:43 - so all right so you know I would
62:46 - encourage you actually before you watch
62:47 - the next video if you're continuing to
62:48 - watch these videos to just check out the
62:51 - end map go to ml5 jazz org I don't
62:53 - encourage you to click on there's lots
62:55 - of stuff to read about here but I
62:56 - encourage you to click on examples and
62:58 - go down and just try all of these so you
63:00 - can see there's some pre-trained models
63:02 - that I'm going to use them to do a
63:03 - tutorial basically about each one of
63:05 - these notably like I mentioned one
63:07 - called pose net which actually can take
63:08 - an image and estimate your pose meaning
63:12 - where your hands where your shoulders
63:13 - where your eyes you know where your hips
63:15 - I might be getting that somewhat wrong
63:17 - there but that's a pre trade model just
63:20 - like a pre trade model learns how to
63:22 - recognize the content of an image here's
63:25 - a pre train model that looks how do I
63:27 - figure out where the human body is in a
63:29 - particular image so we're be looking at
63:32 - those I encourage you to just sort of
63:33 - click around here I also want to just
63:35 - quickly go to this Twitter thread that I
63:37 - posted just to kind of give a little bit
63:40 - of a background and pretty good credit
63:42 - because ml5 jess is not a life here that
63:45 - I created it's a it's a project
63:46 - certainly that I have worked on but it
63:48 - came from many many other people so
63:50 - first I'll mention ITP NYU that's not
63:53 - the right Twitter handle for ITP NYU
63:55 - Boyd I really botched that isn't it well
63:59 - this is a little bit of an aside yeah
64:02 - it's ITV underscore NYU ITP NYU it
64:10 - correct with her Antal okay so first
64:14 - thing to mention is and I did talk about
64:15 - this that ml5 jazz is a layer on top of
64:18 - tensorflow gotcha so all of the heavy
64:20 - lifting behind this
64:21 - really comes from this library which was
64:24 - a prod many people are working on in
64:26 - contributing this library at Google and
64:27 - otherwise but the project was initiated
64:29 - by Nikhil and Daniel researchers at
64:31 - Google the development was funded by
64:34 - with the support of the Google Pig
64:36 - mixture group the Google big picture
64:39 - group and people plus AI research
64:41 - initiative which is led by Martin
64:43 - Wattenberg
64:43 - and Fernanda Viegas and they've done a
64:49 - lot of wonderful projects about
64:51 - visualization and machine learning the
64:54 - style and approach of our library really
64:57 - comes from the processing foundation I
65:01 - mentioned the relationship I guess I
65:02 - meant to say like the reason why the
65:04 - five is here is because of the sort of
65:08 - symbiotic relationship with p5 we've
65:12 - made sure the ml 5 library you
65:14 - absolutely do not need to use p5 with it
65:17 - but it is fully compatible with p5 and
65:20 - the spirit of p5 I think in in its
65:22 - welcoming and inclusive a sensibility is
65:28 - a present in the ml 5 library and so
65:32 - thank you to p5 we've used the 5 there
65:35 - ok
65:40 - Cristobal Valenzuela Valenzuela who is
65:44 - also the creator of Runway I'm out which
65:45 - you should definitely check out started
65:47 - this project at ITP by creating a few
65:49 - examples with the deep largest library
65:52 - which is what tends to flow which is
65:54 - what became tensorflow DJ yes
65:57 - Yanina has done amazing work on porting
66:00 - style transfer meaning she and and pics
66:03 - to pix models into ml 5 this is what's
66:05 - really wonderful pikachu edge-to-edge
66:08 - pikachu i yunying hopefully will either
66:11 - be making her own videos that will point
66:13 - you to all have her and as a guest to go
66:14 - over some of these amana davis has done
66:19 - a lot of work around data collection and
66:21 - responsible data collection that i
66:22 - encourage you to read about and find on
66:24 - the ml5 website through an artist
66:26 - residency Nikita wait a second
66:31 - tonight I might live did I just have
66:33 - like so many mistakes in this
66:35 - I don't know why did I say Huggins her
66:39 - name is Nikita Higgins at ITP right ITP
66:43 - residents sorry I'm like losing my mind
66:46 - I didn't rest I had so many mistakes in
66:49 - my eye hold on just give me a second
66:54 - here I'm just looking at my email here
66:57 - well how do I know it's Huggins it's
67:02 - hungins I'm right I'm totally right I
67:04 - just look losing my mind it's late on a
67:06 - Friday I never get you know okay great
67:11 - Nikita Huggins a resident research at
67:14 - ITP really did a ton of work a project
67:17 - management work vital important work in
67:20 - shepherding the library through many
67:22 - different stages the ml5 logo on the
67:26 - website is designed by Alejandro Hey hey
67:30 - Eun Kwang also gave lots of support to
67:33 - that Dan Ovid actually ported the
67:36 - PostNet model to tension flow digested
67:39 - ml5 Jess I'll be showing this in some
67:41 - video tutorials in the future and the a
67:43 - J's ITP adjacent journal which I did
67:45 - mention also thank you to Stephanie
67:47 - Colton who did all the editing for that
67:49 - article and I encourage you if you
67:50 - really want to read more about the
67:51 - background instead of listening to me
67:53 - ramble you can check that out we had a
67:55 - lot of guest artists who came to visit
67:57 - us and give us a lots of inspiration and
67:59 - ideas throughout the process and then so
68:03 - many organizations allowed us to do some
68:05 - of the first experimental workshops
68:07 - school for poetic computation Eyebeam
68:09 - creative coding fest ITP camp and yeah
68:14 - and there have been many other
68:15 - contributors that you can find if you go
68:18 - to ml v j s dot org and you click on
68:23 - code and browse the github repositories
68:26 - and see all the wonderful people have
68:27 - contributed so this has been my
68:30 - introduction to ml v the library itself
68:33 - and guess what you made it through this
68:36 - video congratulations because in all the
68:39 - rest of the videos I'm really just going
68:41 - to be coding and talking you through how
68:43 - to make certain examples how they work
68:44 - and what the piece is opposed
68:45 - samples are so thanks for watching this
68:47 - first video and I'll see you in the next
68:50 - one which the first thing I'm gonna do
68:51 - is just make a simple image
68:53 - classification example using the mobile
68:55 - net model see you there maybe alright
69:05 - alright alright I did my best I don't
69:12 - know about this did my best I did my
69:24 - best I look at my email now it's the
69:26 - worst day ever it's so distracting oh
69:28 - let me go back to the slack channel
69:32 - [Music]
69:33 - there's something showing through from
69:36 - your computer with the green paper on it
69:37 - oh yeah this never works not better I'm
69:42 - gonna see it okay
69:56 - all right so I'm gonna have what time is
69:59 - it 6:00 o'clock this could be worse I
70:01 - only started like an hour ago
70:03 - well hopefully I'm wrong the Train sound
70:13 - is being requested I have this sorry
70:26 - it's the Train all right
70:50 - let me think about this okay so I'm
71:00 - going to get this image of me how do I
71:07 - set the I definitely want SafeSearch on
71:10 - how do I set it there's a way for me to
71:15 - set it so that it's like all images that
71:18 - I can use I mean the Wikipedia one I
71:20 - think will be fine
71:20 - let me go here and then
71:41 - Oh interesting let's see what happens
71:43 - here mm let's see here sorry I'm looking
71:51 - for some images to use usually when I do
71:57 - image search I feel like there's a way
72:00 - to specify under tools tools there we go
72:04 - usage rights labeled for reuse we go
72:08 - there we go this one I'm looking for
72:20 - okay
72:22 - well where'd I saved the other one did I
72:24 - not save it
72:25 - no I didn't okay okay so one thing
73:01 - so let's just see here my suspicion here
73:04 - uh-huh so interesting enough this is a
73:06 - puffin and what it thinks it is is an
73:09 - oyster catcher and it has a kind of a
73:12 - little bit of sort of low confidence
73:15 - level this is a toucan and it's a toucan
73:18 - where the confidence of 99.99 percent so
73:21 - my question to you watching this and I'm
73:24 - going to repeat this in a second is why
73:27 - does it know this one and not this one
73:31 - and what I'm going to do it's our github
73:42 - code and a5 library under source maybe
73:51 - utils imagenet classes
74:09 - okay
74:25 - then I'm going to figure out what I need
74:31 - here so I have this I have this I have
74:35 - this what was I looking for here is
74:38 - mobile net and image net this is what I
74:52 - wanted okay no I feel like there used to
74:55 - be this webpage that I would go to when
74:57 - I was like researching image net I feel
75:00 - like it was very different than this
75:04 - yeah I don't know
75:12 - okay
75:29 - okay
75:37 - okay
75:46 - we're gonna have to chat here okay
75:53 - why is there often a redundancy with it
75:55 - as a single word in two separate words
75:57 - that's a good question Alka I mean the
75:59 - I'm just going to show this is these are
76:01 - the literal categories okay
76:08 - so the other thing I want to do is just
76:11 - do see if I can find
76:28 - find I'm getting text from home that
76:34 - somebody just sponsored because the
76:37 - lights are flashing welcome underscore
76:40 - underscore thank you underscore
76:42 - underscore you're like Prince this is
76:45 - what I'm looking for
77:00 - that did not work what am i doing save
77:04 - image as
77:14 - here let's try this wall clock I love
77:23 - that okay wonderful
77:24 - and I don't know let's see here all
77:40 - these look at this weirdo this will work
77:59 - snorkel there we go okay so this is
78:01 - exactly what I want to demonstrate okay
78:14 - okay
78:37 - hello welcome to the first code tutorial
78:41 - that I am ever making I did make this
78:43 - kind of like long-winded rambling
78:45 - introduction to what ml5 library is
78:47 - itself but in this video I'm actually
78:48 - going to make a code example that does
78:51 - image classification so this is going to
78:53 - be our hello world hello to machine
78:56 - learning first start one of the easiest
78:59 - things you can do with the ml5 library
79:01 - it and it involves this is very key a
79:04 - pre trained model so this isn't this is
79:06 - not this is not where everyone starts
79:08 - and tutorials about machine learning a
79:10 - lot of Stroh's about machine learning
79:11 - start with like I said in the previous
79:13 - video linear regression in the math and
79:15 - training this and and we're just going
79:17 - to use a pre trained model somebody else
79:19 - made a machine learning model that knows
79:22 - how to recognize the contents of images
79:24 - and ml5 they open sourced it and ml5 is
79:27 - providing us access to it within
79:29 - javascript to use for the p5 library so
79:31 - i'm gonna write the code for this and
79:33 - talk about how it works but let's first
79:34 - actually if you just even want to just
79:36 - play around with this model to start
79:38 - with you can do this right here on the
79:39 - ml5 home page so right here you can see
79:41 - this image of a macaw and guess what the
79:44 - mobile net model labeled this image as a
79:46 - macaw with a confidence oh this must be
79:52 - the best artists machine learning model
79:54 - ever it's like magic it just knows
79:56 - everything and in fact I can grab this
79:58 - toucan and I can drag it in here look at
80:00 - this it's a toucan with a confidence is
80:05 - so smart so smart I can't believe the
80:07 - mobile net model is amazing now let's
80:09 - get this puffin in here it's got to know
80:11 - how to puffin ISM look at this the
80:13 - mobile net model labeled this as an
80:15 - oyster catcher and it's confidence is
80:17 - kind of low huh so what's going on here
80:20 - why is it not saying puffin that's
80:23 - clearly a puppet well first of all guess
80:25 - what a pre trained model for image
80:28 - classification forget about accuracy has
80:33 - a fixed number of even things in the
80:35 - world that knows about and one of the
80:38 - things that's really important if you're
80:39 - working with something like a pre
80:41 - trained model is actually to know what's
80:42 - in that set now
80:44 - it's not the most easy thing to find but
80:47 - right here on the ml5 github there's
80:49 - actually this page of JavaScript code
80:52 - that shows all the things that the
80:55 - mobile net model happens to know about
80:57 - in fact there are 1,000 classes and you
81:01 - could see like this is crazy it knows
81:03 - about a beagle and a bloodhound and a
81:04 - black and a English Foxhound
81:06 - it's like trained to know obscure dog
81:10 - breeds but if I look for puffins it's
81:14 - nowhere to be found
81:15 - boy stur catcher however is in there and
81:17 - if I were to look like what does an
81:19 - oyster catcher look like it kind of
81:23 - makes sense that's the thing it knows
81:25 - about that's closest to puffins so if
81:28 - your project is all about puffins you're
81:32 - not out of luck and I will show you ways
81:34 - to train with your own trade data to
81:36 - retrain a pre trained model but right
81:38 - now we're at this starting point so
81:40 - birds
81:41 - aside that's sort of you know it happens
81:43 - to know a lot about birds it happens to
81:44 - know a lot about dogs but let's just say
81:46 - for the sake of argument
81:48 - I'm gonna now give it this coding train
81:49 - logo it thinks that's a wall clock and
81:53 - it has kind of a low confidence and that
81:54 - I don't know maybe because of what's
81:57 - here the sort of flat nature of it yeah
81:59 - I could give it an image of myself it
82:01 - thinks I'm a snorkel which strangely is
82:04 - probably quite accurate I'm kind of
82:06 - snorkel like in more weights than
82:08 - whatever maybe I'm just that's too weird
82:11 - but the point is it actually knows
82:13 - nothing about people and it knows
82:14 - nothing about a lot of things that exist
82:17 - in our world who made these decisions
82:20 - what's in the preacher why are these
82:22 - classes written this way and and what
82:24 - was it even trained with so first let's
82:26 - talk about supervised learning I'm gonna
82:31 - race the white board do my magic erase
82:35 - the white board thing that I like to do
82:37 - I said I was gonna write code I will
82:55 - buddy Kenny buddy estimate to me after
82:59 - editing how long do you think that first
83:03 - intro to the ml5 video actually is and
83:07 - did I go did I go to if I went like get
83:11 - lost in my leg I want to talk about the
83:13 - technical stuff know if I went in the
83:15 - right directions with that
83:30 - okay
83:42 - okay so let's talk about for a second
83:45 - supervised learning what is supervised
83:47 - learning so image classification what's
83:48 - happening with image classification so
83:50 - the stage that were we're going to do in
83:52 - our code we're really just going to do
83:54 - the prediction stage so the prediction
83:57 - stage we have this pre trained mobile
84:00 - net model the model expects some input
84:04 - and it expects that input to be an image
84:08 - so that's the input to the model then
84:11 - the model generates an output and that
84:13 - output is a list of labels you know cat
84:17 - dog puffins etc and confidence scores
84:23 - you know 98% well I guess the the do the
84:27 - scores all add up to 100% I think I
84:30 - should just 90 percent six percent two
84:34 - percent etc okay so this is the stage
84:37 - that we're doing but how did we even
84:40 - gather we get to the point where we
84:41 - could do this ourselves somebody else
84:44 - had to prepare this mobile net model for
84:47 - us and the preparation of it is with a
84:51 - strategy known as supervised learning so
84:55 - supervised learning involves a it
84:57 - involves a training data set so maybe
85:04 - there is a data set it's almost like you
85:07 - can think of it like a spreadsheet right
85:09 - it has image and label so maybe this is
85:15 - the file name like image one dot jpg and
85:18 - it's a puffin except puffins down and
85:21 - move on that image to JPEG it's a cat
85:24 - right there's this big database and how
85:28 - the data is formatted and cleaned and
85:31 - all that stuff there's lots took that
85:34 - goes into that but essentially there's a
85:35 - big database oh I wrote off the I
85:38 - totally wrote way off the frame again
85:44 - all right all right all right all right
85:47 - it's out of frame come back to them and
85:49 - I'm gonna go back to the supervised
85:50 - learning thing where's my
85:53 - I have these lines showing me where the
85:58 - top is apparently their way in the wrong
86:02 - place
86:15 - so where's the actual top out there oh
86:20 - that's crazy crazy talk okay
86:24 - can you see that line nobody got it
86:27 - about right
86:43 - so somebody had to do this with the
86:45 - process known as supervised learning and
86:50 - write this down they're supervised
86:51 - learning so supervised learning involves
86:56 - a data set and this is often referred to
87:00 - as a labeled data set meaning and you
87:02 - can think of it as a spreadsheet a table
87:05 - a table of images and labels essentially
87:12 - there's two columns here one columns is
87:14 - a lot of examples of inputs and the
87:16 - other column is a lot of examples on
87:18 - outputs so I might have you know cat dot
87:21 - jpg oh and not a cat and then I might
87:24 - have you know kitten dot jpg and that's
87:27 - also a cat and I'm you know I have
87:30 - puffin dot jpg and that's a puffin so
87:34 - the idea here is that there is this
87:35 - existing training data set this is a
87:38 - training data set okay the data set is
87:43 - used to train the mobile net model it
87:45 - just says over and over again here's
87:48 - this image here's its label here's this
87:50 - image this here's this label and the
87:52 - process of how that works
87:53 - involves you know looking at the error
87:56 - they tried that
87:56 - the model tries to make a guess is does
87:59 - it get it wrong says it knows the right
88:00 - answer it can change its settings to try
88:02 - to get the right answer the next time
88:03 - this is the process once that finishes
88:06 - there's usually the model is tested with
88:09 - some other images that weren't used in
88:11 - the training set and then it's a paper
88:13 - is written about it it's published or it
88:15 - might be something that a company sort
88:17 - of owns and keeps keeps closed down it
88:20 - doesn't provide access to MIT uses it in
88:22 - their own proprietary software mobile
88:24 - that is one that is public so the
88:27 - important question for us to ask is
88:29 - we're going to use this pre-trained
88:30 - model and we're going to start trying to
88:33 - understand why it's giving us certain
88:34 - results and what is it good at what is
88:36 - it not good at is we need to know what
88:38 - was that training set in this case the
88:41 - training set is a database of images
88:45 - called imagenet so let's come back to
88:47 - the computer for a second we can go here
88:51 - to the image that looks
88:54 - to do that I guess that's fine no I
88:55 - don't want to do that sorry hold on
88:59 - I specifically made this smaller
89:13 - we can come back to the computer sorry
89:17 - oops we can look at the we can look at
89:21 - the image net website and look at this
89:23 - image net is a database of almost 15
89:27 - million images and that seems pretty
89:28 - good right in a machine learning system
89:31 - for it to do a good job in the
89:33 - supervised learning process it means a
89:35 - lot of data if we just have 10 images
89:37 - it's not gonna be able to do very much
89:39 - there's some tricky things we can do
89:40 - late that I'll show you later with small
89:42 - data sets but in general we need a large
89:44 - a zip so that seems like a good thing
89:45 - but one thing you have to realize like
89:47 - what are the motivations of this data
89:49 - set where are the images coming from
89:50 - well most of you know the this data set
89:54 - was really put together for research
89:57 - into image classification and in order
90:01 - to do that it needs to use well images
90:03 - that are like in the public domain that
90:04 - it can give access to and frankly almost
90:07 - all of you know it's very likely that if
90:10 - you do a google search for any of these
90:12 - so any of the let me just do this really
90:14 - quickly so I go back to the labels let's
90:16 - look for King penguin okay so I'm gonna
90:19 - do a search for King penguin I'm gonna
90:21 - go to images I'm going to grab this
90:24 - image I'm gonna do save image as I'm
90:27 - gonna save it to the desktop as penguin
90:29 - I'm gonna go back to ml5 and then I'm
90:32 - going to go here and say look a hundred
90:35 - percent you know why it's a hundred
90:37 - percent
90:37 - I am almost sure that that image is in I
90:41 - mean I'm not sure about this but going
90:42 - look that's probably in image net so a
90:45 - lot of these sort of like things that
90:46 - come up in a first search result that
90:48 - are in the public domain for Wikipedia
90:49 - they're actually in that image so it's
90:53 - going to work really well with something
90:55 - like that versus the image of a puffin
90:56 - that's not in the database doesn't even
90:58 - know about it so maybe if we could find
90:59 - an image of a penguin that's not in the
91:02 - database image that database it probably
91:04 - would guess it as a penguin but we
91:05 - wouldn't necessarily see that much of a
91:07 - confidence maybe if we had a zoomed out
91:09 - picture with a lot more background noise
91:11 - something anything you could try that
91:12 - super interesting is to just download
91:14 - this image and like draw over it or
91:16 - change a couple pixels what happens to
91:18 - the image classification afterwards all
91:19 - these things you could try and better
91:21 - yet you can try them by writing your own
91:24 - code so I think it's time
91:26 - and on and on for drew long enough about
91:28 - what this model is last thing I
91:30 - mentioned is if you really want to dive
91:32 - deeply into the mobile net model there
91:33 - is a whole paper written about it
91:35 - there's a github repository I'll link to
91:36 - all that stuff I encourage you to
91:38 - research this stuff and to think about
91:41 - it to ask questions and to be critical
91:42 - what are the motivations behind it the
91:44 - creation of a model what data was used
91:47 - in that model and what where might you
91:50 - want to use it or not use it okay so all
91:53 - that aside let's actually write some
91:55 - code to use the model now so I'm
91:57 - actually not ready to do that so this is
91:59 - gonna be an edit point so let me go to
92:13 - the desktop make a directory climb go
92:20 - five videos I'm going to go into it what
92:27 - do I do
92:27 - bundle and then image classification did
92:34 - that work oh my god losing my mind no P
92:40 - five G - B I know I put it in quotes I'm
92:44 - like losing my mind I forgot I used this
92:46 - P five manager thing okay actually hold
92:54 - on a sec
93:01 - so I'm just setting up my workflow stuff
93:04 - which I will talk about in a second
93:16 - [Music]
93:24 - image classification index this is all
93:29 - good I don't need a libraries folder now
93:39 - something I forgot about I just want to
93:40 - check real quick before I make this
93:43 - video let me let's do a quick little
93:44 - test here and then I'm gonna have to
93:47 - back up so 27 I don't recall
93:53 - so let me just make sure before I go
93:56 - into this stuff that click on get
93:59 - started yep I'm gonna grab this put it
94:05 - in here I'm going to take all these
94:11 - images I'm gonna grab these ridiculous
94:16 - images I'm gonna make a folder called
94:21 - images put them in there I just I can't
94:26 - remember whether it works yet with load
94:30 - image or if I I just want to test the
94:35 - code real quick before I do the tutorial
94:37 - I'm gonna say load image somebody by the
94:39 - way give me a heads up when it's like
94:41 - seven o'clock I should maybe do that
94:43 - animation coding challenge just have a
94:45 - little variety load image images what
94:52 - did I have puffins whoops puffin dot jpg
95:00 - and then I want to just say image image
95:03 - zero zero so let's just make sure this
95:06 - works that's a large image of a puffin
95:15 - okay that's what's guy okay and then
95:30 - let's just see
95:33 - I just want to before I do the tutorial
95:48 - I want to make sure I know what I'm
95:49 - doing mobile gnat model ready I think
95:54 - that's only to do and then model ready
96:02 - let me just see console dot log already
96:08 - apologies to you live stream viewers
96:10 - because I'm kind of ignoring you right
96:11 - now I realize but I want to make sure
96:15 - that this works this is not right let's
96:18 - look at the documentation probably well
96:28 - I did that right already
96:31 - mobile net
96:41 - oh oh it's just slow I forgot it
96:44 - actually takes quite it's got to
96:45 - download the lot mount model from the
96:47 - cloud I just wasn't patient enough and
96:49 - then I want to stay a classifier
96:54 - classify image I got results this is how
97:07 - I do it error results console.log
97:13 - results I'm going to do all this again
97:15 - in the tutorial and talk it through okay
97:20 - classifiers not defined because not
97:25 - global I don't really want to put it up
97:27 - here but I'm going to oh what just
97:34 - happened my connection is oh look the
97:38 - connection is being all screwy okay
97:48 - get results SE I got results got results
97:56 - last attempt everybody classified click
98:05 - classify is not a function okay
98:12 - classify a classifier predict I thought
98:18 - we'd change it to classify which is fine
98:21 - but I had this memory of changing it to
98:23 - classify that's fine though yes if that
98:31 - didn't work
98:33 - pixels cannot be null this is fine I'm
98:38 - gonna do it the other way I just I
98:40 - really want I want it to work with this
98:48 - is the thing we need to fix yeah so I
98:55 - had a suspicion that this wasn't going
98:57 - to work I will do this
99:07 - just want to make sure this works create
99:14 - image yeah okay so it worked so this is
99:22 - sorry for me experimenting with this so
99:25 - what I'm what I was doing here is that
99:27 - p5 allows you to load images in two
99:30 - different ways there's the load image
99:32 - function which will actually load just
99:35 - the data if it image there's I thought
99:39 - do I have to say like but or there's the
99:41 - create image function makes an image Dom
99:43 - element so but it apparently it's only
99:54 - work with the Dom element thing okay so
99:55 - I'm ready to go I forgot what I was
99:59 - doing when I can I get rid of this file
100:06 - so annoying
100:19 - okay
100:36 - okay
100:40 - all right so we're ready now to start
100:43 - writing some code so what I'm starting
100:45 - with is very little I have a file called
100:49 - it's a text file called sketch j/s and
100:51 - it has some JavaScript code in it it's
100:55 - assuming the p5 library and I have
100:57 - already in fact oh shoot
100:59 - gotta start this over again sorry okay
101:09 - we're ready to write the code now I'm
101:11 - what I'm starting with is one javascript
101:14 - file with a little bit of code in it
101:15 - again I mentioned I'm using the p5
101:17 - library the p5 library supports a setup
101:20 - function which executes when the web
101:22 - page loads create canvas makes a canvas
101:24 - and now I color the background with the
101:26 - color 0 which is black and if I go into
101:29 - the browser I am able to see the results
101:32 - of this code because I also happen to be
101:34 - running a local server using it a node
101:37 - server package now there are so many
101:40 - ways that you can run a web page that's
101:44 - running JavaScript and you could use
101:45 - code pen or open processing or something
101:49 - new that's gonna be coming out soon
101:50 - which is a p5 editor that you could use
101:52 - online that when it comes out all week
101:54 - do it in the video description but for
101:56 - right now I'm going to use my workflow
101:58 - of having my own text editor on my
101:59 - computer and the p5 libraries imported
102:04 - in the HTML file so here's the HTML file
102:07 - the only thing is it's doing right now
102:09 - is it's referencing the p5 library and
102:12 - something called the p5 Dom library
102:13 - which I need for some of the things I
102:15 - want to do and then also of course my
102:17 - own sketch jas I have a video where I
102:20 - kind of go through my entire workflow in
102:22 - more detailed steps I will also link to
102:24 - that in this video's description now
102:27 - that that's settled though I can
102:28 - actually start to use ml 5 so how do I
102:30 - use ml 5 so right here I'm on the ml 5
102:32 - home page the first place I should go is
102:34 - just click on this big get started
102:35 - button so I'm gonna click on that and I
102:37 - totally clicked around to the wrong
102:38 - place let's try that again I'm gonna
102:43 - click on the get started button and I'm
102:45 - gonna go right down here and I look at
102:47 - this this is what I need now I can
102:50 - download the ml
102:52 - five javascript library file itself and
102:54 - included on my computer and I might want
102:56 - to do that if I'm gonna work offline but
102:58 - I prefer to just reference this
103:00 - particular URL in a script tag and this
103:04 - is at the time of this recording this is
103:07 - the current version of the ml five
103:08 - library zero point one point one now by
103:11 - the time you're watching this it might
103:13 - be like seven point eight point six if
103:15 - that's the case this video probably
103:17 - means absolutely nothing whatsoever but
103:19 - if it's relatively close to that version
103:21 - hopefully this video is still helpful to
103:23 - you all right now will not make my joke
103:26 - about your brain being inside of the
103:27 - gelatinous thawing machine thing in this
103:30 - video I made it so many times it's not
103:33 - even address even funny okay I'm so I'm
103:35 - gonna put that in here I'm just gonna go
103:37 - back to my web page and I'm gonna
103:39 - refresh it's still working okay good
103:42 - so now we have the ml five library
103:44 - imported and we can start calling ml
103:46 - five functions so one thing I might
103:47 - actually do is just go back to the ml
103:50 - five website whoops sorry we're just
103:52 - here and click on examples and I could
103:55 - go down to image classification and I
103:57 - could start kind of looking at this code
103:59 - and copy pasting some stuff I'm gonna
104:01 - kind of type it out and I have some of
104:03 - this in my head so I can just type it
104:05 - out but more importantly probably
104:07 - there's there are these examples which
104:09 - you can use to get started but you might
104:11 - also suggest like just having the
104:12 - webpage open to the reference page for a
104:15 - particular feature so again I want to
104:17 - have videos that go through all of these
104:18 - features but let's go through the image
104:21 - classifier one I'm gonna click on that
104:23 - okay so now this is the documentation
104:26 - there's a little bit of an example here
104:28 - and there's some information about the
104:30 - syntax and if I get confused I can refer
104:33 - back to that but since I know some of
104:35 - this having done this before I'm gonna
104:37 - just start writing directly into sketch
104:39 - j/s itself okay so the first thing that
104:43 - I need to do is I need to create an
104:45 - image classifier itself so I'm gonna
104:47 - make a variable and I'm gonna call it
104:49 - classifier and actually you don't I'm
104:51 - gonna call it mobile net because I want
104:53 - to remind myself that this is not magic
104:55 - that this is using a very specific
104:57 - pre-trained model called mobile net so
104:59 - I'm gonna call my variable mobile net
105:00 - then I'm going to say mobile net equals
105:04 - and
105:05 - five dot image classifier so this is a
105:08 - function that generates an image
105:09 - classification object it's going to be
105:11 - stored in that variable mobile net and
105:13 - now it needs some arguments so what goes
105:16 - in there now the truth of the matter is
105:19 - there might be a variety of things you
105:22 - can put it there at the time of this
105:23 - recording there's really only one option
105:25 - which is the mobile net model so I'm
105:28 - telling ml five that I want to make a
105:31 - image classifier in the first argument
105:33 - I'm giving it as a string with the name
105:35 - of the model now in theory as much as an
105:38 - alive supports additional pre-trained
105:40 - model I might get to type something in
105:41 - here like a unicorn classifier like
105:45 - maybe it classifies all different kinds
105:46 - of unicorns mobile net and then I need
105:49 - something else really important I need a
105:51 - callback deep breath deep breath deep
105:54 - breath deep breath okay so wait I got to
105:57 - stop for a second oh the ml five library
106:01 - supports callbacks which is what I'm
106:03 - going to use in these video tutorials
106:04 - and something called promises I have if
106:07 - you don't know what a jobs are get
106:08 - promises I will refer you to my playlist
106:10 - about JavaScript promises and you might
106:12 - look at some the documentation but if
106:14 - you're someone who already uses
106:15 - JavaScript promises is it another way of
106:17 - handling asynchronous events that's
106:19 - slightly different but very similar to
106:21 - callbacks that's something you can go
106:23 - and do on your own do on your own or
106:25 - I'll make some videos about that too
106:26 - but right now I'm going to use the
106:27 - callback methodology so in the idea here
106:30 - is I type in the name of a function I
106:32 - could also put an anonymous function in
106:33 - there called model ready and I'm gonna
106:36 - write I'm just gonna put that function
106:38 - up here in the global space because
106:40 - that's gonna be very simple and I'm just
106:43 - gonna say console dot log model is ready
106:48 - exclamation point so the idea here is I
106:50 - am now creating an image classifier with
106:52 - a mobile net model it's gonna take some
106:54 - time for it to load that model this is
106:56 - not a small thing now it's called mobile
106:58 - net because it's actually a tiny model
107:00 - that can even run on like mobile phones
107:01 - so this code would work well even in a
107:04 - mobile browser but even the tiniest
107:07 - model is something that's got some size
107:09 - to it it's gonna take a little while to
107:11 - load so let's go see how long go over
107:14 - here into here I'm gonna hit refresh
107:19 - model is ready so I know it was a few
107:21 - seconds you can see now one thing that
107:23 - sitter is like where did it load the
107:25 - model from does the ml5 library have a
107:28 - copy of it loaded that well actually no
107:30 - so one thing that's important here is a
107:33 - lot of the pre train models this is
107:35 - going to be different but a lot of the
107:36 - pre train models that you might make use
107:38 - of in ml5 are actually loaded from the
107:41 - cloud meaning some underground bunker
107:43 - servers were the model file is stored so
107:47 - and the this I believe it's coming from
107:50 - a Google server so if you're not
107:53 - connected to the Internet this example
107:54 - won't even run there probably you know
107:56 - at some point I'll be nice to support
107:57 - ways of running a mobile net model
107:59 - offline it is certainly technically
108:00 - possible but the ml5 library not all of
108:02 - the examples but this example in
108:04 - particular requires you to be online
108:06 - okay so the model is ready so now what
108:09 - can I do
108:10 - I can classify an image okay whoo this
108:13 - is fun for me
108:15 - alright so let's see I already have in
108:19 - this directory a bunch of those images
108:22 - that I was experimenting with so let's
108:24 - just use for example the puffin since
108:26 - that's our example we should see I
108:29 - shouldn't know that was going to happen
108:41 - let's let's start by using the puffin
108:44 - since that's one that we worked with
108:45 - earlier you know I personally I'd like
108:47 - to expect I like to use in my examples
108:49 - stuff that doesn't work because it's it
108:53 - leads you to ask questions and stuff
108:55 - just works it kind of feels like it can
108:57 - start to feel like magic and you can you
108:59 - know it's important to think about why
109:00 - stuff and how stuff is working okay so
109:02 - what I'm gonna do in setup I'm gonna
109:05 - make a variable called pufn pufn pufn
109:08 - and I'm gonna say puffin equals create
109:11 - IMG now this is a particular function in
109:15 - the p5 library right this is now like
109:18 - create canvas sp5 create images p5 this
109:21 - makes a Dom element an image element on
109:24 - the webpage that is that image so if I
109:28 - were to reload this page you're gonna
109:30 - see okay uh it's in the directory images
109:32 - so I need to include that there you're
109:35 - gonna see there it is down there now I
109:37 - can do things like if I wanted to have
109:39 - this all happen in my canvas I could say
109:41 - puffin dot hide and then I can actually
109:44 - say image puffin and this won't work but
109:47 - it'll be interesting to think why for a
109:49 - second and I want to draw the puffin
109:51 - into canvas the reason why it didn't
109:52 - work is once again things don't happen
109:56 - in JavaScript instantaneously so it's
109:58 - got it's gonna take some time to create
110:00 - that image I'm going to I could give
110:02 - that a call back it's called like image
110:05 - ready this is a lot of this stuff is
110:06 - unnecessary to the example I'm building
110:08 - but just to demonstrate the idea and
110:11 - then now I'm going to draw the image
110:13 - into the canvas ah but that image is
110:16 - really like a big size so I could resize
110:18 - it or I could just like force it to be
110:20 - the size of the canvas and there we go
110:22 - so I now have a p5 canvas displaying my
110:25 - puppet image and the model is ready so
110:28 - now once the model is ready what can I
110:31 - do
110:31 - I can classify the image I can try to
110:34 - ask mobile net what's in it and the way
110:36 - I do that is with a function called
110:38 - predict so you'll see different names
110:41 - for different functions in the ml5
110:42 - library predict will come up often you
110:45 - might change to classify by the time you
110:47 - watch this video but I think it's called
110:48 - predict right now of ml5 I'm going to
110:52 - say mobile net dot predict puffin
110:57 - meaning I want mobile net to give me a
111:00 - prediction of what it thinks the content
111:02 - of the puffin image is and then guess
111:05 - what that takes some time it doesn't
111:07 - happen instantaneously so I need yet
111:09 - again another callback and I'm gonna
111:11 - give it a callback called got results
111:13 - and again I could do this with a promise
111:14 - if that's something that you're more
111:16 - comfortable with but I'm going to do
111:17 - with callback and then I'm gonna write
111:19 - this function called got results you've
111:22 - used p5 before this is very similar to
111:26 - like load JSON oh I want to load the
111:28 - date I want to load the data from this
111:31 - JSON file and then you usually have you
111:34 - know an argument to the callback which
111:35 - has the stuff in it the stuff that you
111:37 - want is filled that argument but here's
111:40 - something that ml5 works with error
111:43 - first callbacks this is a Java Script
111:45 - pattern where when you write the
111:47 - callback you always must include as the
111:50 - first argument and error argument an
111:53 - error variable meaning it's for the
111:56 - library is forcing you to check for
111:57 - errors so in this case I might want to
111:59 - say something like if error whoops
112:01 - not a new promise console and by the way
112:05 - I could say console dot log but I can
112:07 - actually say console dot error error and
112:08 - then otherwise console dot log the
112:12 - results so this is a little bit of extra
112:14 - error handling if something went wrong
112:16 - in the prediction process hopefully I
112:17 - would see that there otherwise I'm going
112:19 - to see the results all right let's see
112:24 - if this works
112:28 - [Music]
112:34 - and here we go
112:37 - boy stur catcher and we can see these
112:39 - probability is 75 that is crazy so this
112:42 - is really interesting to me
112:44 - this got 75% then it also thought it was
112:47 - albatross and Drake different
112:50 - probabilities now why a 45% 11% why why
112:54 - is this different than what I got with
112:56 - the oyster catcher in
112:58 - the homepage of ml5 2's I don't know the
113:01 - answer to that I don't have to think
113:03 - about that it's a different probability
113:06 - but nonetheless I'm getting a pretty
113:07 - similar result nice to do with like
113:08 - versions of something and that the
113:10 - homepage is running a different version
113:11 - of something but we can see this is the
113:13 - idea now what I could easily what I
113:15 - could do is I could go and I could say
113:17 - all right let me get the the label is
113:21 - results this by the way is an array with
113:25 - three objects in it so I could say I
113:27 - want to get the first object index zero
113:31 - and I want to get the class name right
113:34 - object zero dot class name that's the
113:37 - label and then I'm just gonna draw them
113:39 - and say fill zero text size 100 no
113:45 - social sixty-four I don't know and then
113:47 - I'm gonna say text label and I'll say
113:52 - ten and like you know height minus fifty
113:55 - or something I don't know I'm just
113:57 - putting it arbitrarily somewhere on the
113:59 - page on the canvas so let's run this
114:02 - again we can see unloaded and then it
114:07 - says moister catcher right there how
114:09 - thrilling we have now run the motet
114:12 - model got the prediction for our image
114:14 - and there it is of course I could also
114:16 - do something like create a Dom element
114:19 - for the label I could also I could also
114:23 - get like the probability by saying
114:26 - equals results index zero dot and what
114:29 - was it called class name probability is
114:32 - the net other probability and I don't
114:36 - know if I spelled that right and I could
114:37 - create two Dom elements using Create P
114:41 - and we could run this one more time
114:44 - and now we're gonna see that stuff down
114:47 - here it's very very small probability is
114:50 - not defined probability probability Oh
114:55 - prob uh I named my variable prob because
115:01 - I got a lot of probs okay
115:05 - so we can see here there's the
115:07 - probability so you know this is the
115:08 - basics now you see you could actually
115:11 - just go and use this in
115:12 - right now one thing I have a couple
115:15 - ideas for you number one is make a
115:16 - little interface try several images can
115:18 - you make one where you can actually drag
115:20 - and drop your own image like it does on
115:21 - ml5 homepage
115:23 - could you make something where you draw
115:24 - on the canvas and it's trying to
115:25 - classify what you're drawing another
115:27 - thing you could try is can you get it to
115:29 - classify what the webcam is is seeing
115:32 - and guess what that's what I'm gonna do
115:33 - in the next video so there's so many
115:35 - more things you could do with this but
115:36 - this is the basic idea try your own
115:39 - version of this experiment play around
115:40 - try a lot of different images but in the
115:42 - next video I am going to basically take
115:44 - this exact example but hook it up to the
115:47 - live webcam feed and we can see it sort
115:49 - of classify images from the webcam in
115:51 - real time all right I'm gonna and so if
115:54 - I'm doing this as a live stream right
115:56 - now if you're watching this recorder
115:57 - that's recorded but I'm gonna check to
115:59 - see any questions and I'll answer those
116:00 - also to beginning the next video okay
116:02 - see you soon okay so sorry mine
116:14 - this is what happens after a live stream
116:15 - for like two hours my nose starts to get
116:17 - itchy I can't explain it it's like a
116:19 - nervous tic I got one more piece of
116:21 - melon
116:38 - so I think what I want to do is I'm
116:42 - going to do the video thing and then I
116:45 - want to try to do my coding challenge
116:46 - which is the animated sprite thing and
116:51 - then I think I'll be done for today how
116:54 - do you feel about that is that okay why
116:57 - okay I haven't really been following the
117:03 - chat
117:03 - does anybody have any important
117:04 - questions my colors are out of range for
117:09 - that syntax you need to use promises I
117:12 - don't know looking for any questions la
117:18 - conciencia asks when do you upload this
117:21 - video so it sort of depends but the live
117:24 - stream archive will be available as soon
117:26 - as this finishes at the same URL that
117:28 - you're at right now
117:28 - but the edited version of the videos
117:31 - will come out sometime next week
117:32 - probably is your hair brown well I
117:37 - always say my hair is gray but if we
117:40 - used to be Brown
117:42 - yeah important question is it two hours
117:45 - cold coffee that would be the answer
117:47 - that would be yes alright alright
117:55 - Rustom is asking can you use JavaScript
117:57 - inheritance
117:58 - today I've act I don't know if I took
118:00 - get requests final bit on Twitter or in
118:02 - a comment earlier today I don't I don't
118:04 - think I have time to look at JavaScript
118:05 - inheritance today but that is something
118:07 - I would like to cover at some point in
118:08 - the future image ratio is different
118:13 - interesting will I use 3jf in a future
118:19 - video I mean in theory anything is
118:22 - possible I can dream alright okay so
118:26 - thanks for these questions it's almost
118:28 - 7:00 see the super chats did I miss some
118:31 - super chats let me click here no that's
118:33 - for sending one top chat
118:36 - no I don't know how to see the super
118:38 - chats if I missed any important super
118:41 - chat questions I would be happy to
118:43 - answer them and of course I have heard
118:46 - of mr. doob okay I just want to check
118:56 - something real quick okay I've been on
119:08 - for two hours the stream status is good
119:11 - it's just interesting that I I'm just
119:13 - I'm noticing that I have this whole
119:15 - interface for like analytics while the
119:21 - stream is running and it's kind of
119:23 - curious that I can just check it
119:24 - sometimes by the average this is a good
119:27 - time the average view duration of the
119:29 - live stream is 12 minutes and 42 seconds
119:31 - so if you've been here the whole time
119:33 - thank you you're a your I appreciate it
119:37 - okay all right so let me go back to the
119:46 - chat I don't know we're getting some
119:50 - messages here I missed a lot of stuff in
119:54 - the slack channel chat so if there's
119:56 - anything super important goodnight to
119:58 - those of you who are going to sleep
119:59 - because it's like really late at night
120:01 - for you I've got another hour before I
120:04 - really have to go I mean I'd love to go
120:06 - but I'm gonna try to get through what I
120:08 - said is gonna get to it through okay so
120:10 - let's take a moment to do some
120:13 - stretching
120:27 - I'm doing some stretching over here I
120:32 - put on my weight at this waiting music
120:34 - for a second
121:11 - okay all right everybody
121:19 - what's that ready to him this weekend
121:21 - anything fun do you call it the pickle
121:25 - or the floss this is a constant
121:26 - discussion in my household is it the
121:28 - pickle or the floss which I clearly
121:31 - cannot do all right
121:46 - hello I am back to do another video
121:50 - about image classification with ml5 and
121:52 - in this video I'm going to take that's a
121:54 - puppet by the way not an oyster catcher
121:56 - I talked a lot about why it says oyster
121:59 - catcher not puffin but anyway I am now
122:01 - going to do a good classification but
122:04 - instead of seeing our good friend the
122:06 - puffin we're going to see I don't know
122:09 - if it's our good friend or not probably
122:11 - just me whatever is in the webcam of
122:14 - this computer Thank You barbone de Luci
122:23 - appreciate it
122:32 - hello back I'm here to do another video
122:36 - using the ml 5 javascript library a
122:39 - library beginner-friendly library about
122:41 - machine learning I'm gonna use again the
122:43 - same pre-trained model called mobile
122:45 - debt that I talked about way too much
122:46 - about in the previous video but instead
122:50 - of attempting to classify this image as
122:52 - a puffin which the model failed to it
122:54 - thinks it's an oyster catcher which is
122:55 - not an unreasonable guess I am going to
122:59 - attempt to classify images coming
123:01 - straight in in real time from the web
123:03 - camera so this would actually not take
123:05 - us very long frankly cuz I've mostly
123:07 - written all the code for it so pause I
123:13 - realize I've gotta be smarter about this
123:16 - and I want to now make another copy of
123:19 - it call it video classification because
123:23 - I'm going to change the code but I'm
123:24 - gonna want to have it I'm gonna go back
123:28 - and refresh and then go to video
123:29 - classification says that and I'm going
123:35 - to close this and this okay so the first
123:45 - thing I'm gonna do is instead of create
123:49 - image right here in setup I am going to
123:54 - say create capture video then I'm also
124:04 - going to add the draw function because
124:06 - right now unlike with the image we're
124:09 - just loading one image and then I was
124:10 - just drawing it once I need to have a
124:12 - loop that happens over and over again
124:14 - because what I want to see is the image
124:17 - of the video over and over again now
124:19 - again I don't have to draw the video
124:21 - into canvas I could just have the video
124:24 - element appear on the page itself but I
124:27 - like using the canvas just for sort of
124:29 - like it's kind of lead you to the water
124:32 - when the water is the place where you
124:34 - can draw your own stuff and be creative
124:35 - in the canvas so I like that I don't
124:38 - know if that made any sense but I this
124:42 - is what happens after two hours I
124:44 - I just I lose all ability to have any
124:49 - let me just start this whole thing over
124:51 - one more time for no real reason
124:58 - no reason other than my own neuroses I
125:01 - apologize to those of you who are
125:02 - watching this in real-time
125:04 - this must be super annoying I don't even
125:10 - remember where I left off okay so the
125:16 - first thing I want to change in the code
125:18 - it to turn it into video is I want to go
125:20 - and look at where I created the image so
125:22 - I said Puffin equals create image I had
125:25 - just this static image now what I want
125:27 - to do is I want to use the p5 function
125:29 - called create capture and instead of
125:33 - pointing to I can't spell today instead
125:35 - if I've can't spell every day instead of
125:37 - pointing to an image file the argument
125:40 - that I give the create capture function
125:41 - is just the constant video video means I
125:45 - want to create a video capture it's
125:47 - gonna default to the default camera it's
125:50 - connected to the computer so just to be
125:52 - sure about this I'm going to comment out
125:54 - puffin dot hide I'm gonna change this
125:56 - I'm gonna get rid of this which has to
125:58 - do with drawing the image I'm going to
126:02 - get rid of the predict comment that out
126:05 - and I'm gonna change this variable to
126:06 - video so the only thing that I should
126:07 - see right now is I should see the video
126:11 - appearing on the page so let's run this
126:16 - first it's asking me permission it wants
126:19 - to use my camera I'm gonna say allow and
126:22 - then there it is there's be okay
126:30 - so there it is now here's the thing I
126:34 - could just use the video element there
126:36 - and it's fine but I have this like thing
126:40 - that I'm obsess over and I feel as
126:41 - important what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
126:43 - hide the video it's this is on is
126:45 - there's nothing to do with the
126:46 - machine-learning image classification
126:48 - aspect but I feel like you might have a
126:50 - chance to express yourself to be more
126:52 - creative instead of just using the
126:54 - default Dom element if you actually draw
126:56 - the video
126:57 - to the canvas itself this might allow
126:59 - you to do things like draw on top of it
127:01 - and another type of stuff so there we go
127:03 - now I have the video in the actual
127:05 - canvas and I'm hiding the the video Dom
127:08 - element now all I need to do is go where
127:12 - did I do this I want to uh uh where did
127:17 - I call predict I called predict as soon
127:19 - as the model was ready well you know
127:20 - what guess what I'm gonna do that again
127:21 - and I'm gonna put video in here and I'm
127:25 - gonna get rid of this create peace stuff
127:27 - because I don't want to mess with that
127:32 - right now but the got results function
127:34 - can remain the same so as soon as the
127:36 - models ready it's going to get the
127:38 - results and it's gonna draw what it
127:40 - thinks the label is right there in the
127:42 - array okay there's a video oh so okay we
127:48 - got an error this is so good that we got
127:50 - this air because the errors you get when
127:52 - you use like ml5 they're really scary
127:55 - error math back and WebGL right pixels
127:58 - pixels cannot be no I mean that sort of
128:00 - makes sense to us okay so one of the
128:02 - things that I didn't mention in my
128:03 - introduction to ml five is I don't have
128:06 - that diagram anymore but ml five being
128:08 - built on top of tensorflow tjs
128:10 - tensorflow Jas he's doing all of the
128:12 - math using something called WebGL which
128:16 - is a 3d renderer for the browser and
128:19 - there's an interesting story as to why
128:21 - all those pieces fit together in this
128:22 - way which I could talk about another
128:24 - time but this is why you see these error
128:26 - messages quite often that have to do
128:27 - with like math back and WebGL so let's
128:30 - see what did I what did I get wrong
128:32 - mobile net dot predict video got results
128:35 - that video video equals create capture
128:38 - video hide I you know what guess what I
128:42 - don't actually I completely forgot
128:46 - something important that I wanted to
128:48 - show you how I kind of want to fix this
128:49 - because this really should work I'm
128:56 - thinking here I'm just pause verse I got
128:59 - why did this not work
129:10 - interesting hold on I have a weird sort
129:12 - of I just humor me for a second
129:29 - hmm
129:33 - make sure that hiding it isn't the
129:35 - problem I wonder if this is an ml5 bug
129:39 - this is not actually the way to do it I
129:41 - forgot the way to do it and I'm gonna
129:42 - change the way I'm doing it but I'm just
129:44 - gonna nope
129:48 - yeah I don't this should work but I'm
129:52 - not going to worry about that right now
130:04 - I guess I could just ignore the fact
130:07 - that I trying to think if I need to go
130:17 - back in the video because this error I
130:19 - mean I like that I got that error but
130:22 - the problem is now I can't fix it I'm
130:28 - gonna have to oh wait hold on I'm
130:31 - getting some messages in ml5 slack
130:42 - that's something else
130:48 - yeah okay now this is this is unrelated
130:50 - unrelated I'll look at that later
130:52 - thought maybe somebody was messaging me
130:54 - in a different place go back to here I
131:01 - don't want to let let yeah where's the
131:04 - stack trace T okay all right you know
131:08 - what
131:10 - I'm gonna back up before - before I got
131:14 - that error right I was a little it was
131:20 - right about I'm gonna back up much yeah
131:23 - so I don't know why that didn't work but
131:26 - I'm gonna do it a different way which I
131:30 - think well let me just make sure it
131:32 - works the different way I'm gonna do it
131:47 - yeah so the way this this way worked so
131:51 - I don't know why that didn't work it
131:52 - should have but I'm gonna choose that's
131:56 - not the way the example is written and
131:57 - I'm gonna choose to do it the way the
132:00 - examples written I'll have to revisit
132:01 - that if somebody wants to explore that a
132:03 - little bit and file an issue on the ml 5
132:06 - - library github repo that would be
132:10 - helpful
132:11 - ok so sorry about this mention this
132:13 - might be hard to edit but I need to
132:17 - figure out now when to call the predict
132:18 - function and so in theory I should just
132:20 - call the predict function right here
132:22 - with the video but here's one of the
132:23 - nice things about ml 5 since ml 5 knows
132:26 - about things like hey you might want to
132:29 - do this with that continuously running
132:31 - video I can actually when I create the
132:34 - image class I'm gonna pop its I'm gonna
132:38 - take that this out of here sorry I'm
132:40 - gonna take video out of the dot predict
132:42 - function and actually the way to do this
132:44 - is when I create this image classifier I
132:46 - can actually say I want the mobile net
132:49 - model to act continuously on the video
132:54 - so I want to like hook those things up
132:56 - together so I can actually insert the
132:58 - video the P 5 video element right there
133:00 - into the into the image classifier
133:02 - function and then I can just call
133:05 - predict without any particular I mean I
133:07 - could always say predict on this
133:08 - specific image but now the video is just
133:11 - linked to that image classifier and I
133:13 - could just call predict so now if I run
133:17 - this oh shoot how do i how do I make
133:23 - this
133:32 - so now if I run this I'm gonna refresh
133:35 - it there go think we should see there I
133:40 - am I am a poncho or a cardigan are I'm
133:45 - often considered chainmail once again
133:47 - we're seeing the failings of the image
133:51 - the the mobile net model in this
133:53 - particular case now the thing is it just
133:55 - did it once right it just called predict
133:58 - the moment the model is ready but guess
134:00 - what what if how do I call it
134:02 - continuously well you know what once it
134:05 - calls predict and it got the results why
134:07 - not just ask it to do it again so if
134:09 - there was a mistake maybe I want to not
134:12 - move on but if it works I'm gonna get
134:14 - rid of the create P stuff here and get
134:16 - rid of the probability just for right
134:17 - now I can just do this so what I'm doing
134:22 - here is this is like a work this is
134:24 - essentially like a loop another loop
134:26 - that's happening when the model is ready
134:28 - that's when I can start predicting then
134:31 - once I've got the results I've got the
134:33 - results draw them and then show me the
134:36 - next one oh but guess what
134:37 - that's weird it didn't actually show up
134:39 - so this is actually a big problem so I'm
134:42 - gonna run this again we're gonna well
134:43 - hopefully this will work it's going to
134:45 - it so weirdly this is working I don't
134:49 - like that this is working let's see this
134:51 - is something that generally tends to get
134:52 - correctly kneepad really water bottle
134:58 - okay
134:58 - so but I this this worked by accident
135:03 - the fact that I'm seeing the text there
135:05 - I probably shouldn't draw in multiple
135:08 - places what would make more sense for me
135:10 - to do is make a global variable called
135:13 - label and then just oh and then have
135:16 - this and have that set initially to an
135:19 - empty string and then this drawing of
135:22 - the label should actually be right here
135:25 - in draw itself so let's try this again
135:28 - let's make it a little smaller and let's
135:31 - try one more time and here we go let's
135:35 - see what types of things that can
135:36 - classify and you know what I should this
135:44 - is you know so I'd have to
135:46 - more thoughtful about the design here so
135:48 - let's do this
135:49 - let's make the canvas a little bit
135:54 - taller and of course I could just write
135:56 - it into an HTML element but just for
135:59 - simplicity let's see here let's see if
136:08 - this does the trick I just drew you know
136:15 - that's a little bit better he meant to I
136:17 - should make the canvas a bit taller I
136:21 - don't know why I was so stingy
136:24 - there okay so what I'm trying to do is
136:29 - just draw a little area there we go okay
136:32 - so now and and honestly I probably
136:35 - should take out this console dot log
136:38 - these console dot log scan really slow
136:41 - things down and I'm gonna do this again
136:44 - last time here we go all right poncho Oh
136:49 - like let's see spatula
136:54 - it's pretty good spatula okay doesn't
136:58 - recognize a bell magnetic compass what
137:03 - about a train whistle a matchstick
137:06 - that's pretty good does it recognize a
137:09 - book broccoli what about a marker
137:14 - paintbrush I could be here I want to do
137:16 - this all day long
137:17 - this video is gonna be like 17 hours
137:20 - long pill bottle kneepad water tower I
137:26 - think the green background is kind of it
137:28 - likely confusing it what else do I got
137:30 - in this room oh let's see
137:33 - a cornea and piano accordion so you can
137:41 - see as long as it's something that's in
137:43 - there right if it's been trained on that
137:46 - particular you know if I just happen to
137:48 - have a chihuahua with me I probably
137:50 - could get it to recognize that Chihuahua
137:51 - so this is a fun thing that you can now
137:53 - play with you could make your own
137:55 - project about you know
137:58 - you know there's a Google made a project
138:01 - like this called ASCAP emoji scavenger
138:04 - hunt where you had to like find certain
138:05 - things get the image classifier to
138:07 - recognize it so there's all sorts of
138:10 - course it used some custom training
138:11 - there to make that work for particular
138:13 - objects but so I think there's a lot of
138:15 - possibilities of things you could
138:16 - explore here but now you can really have
138:18 - your hands in there play with the code
138:20 - visualize things draw stuff you know and
138:24 - really experiment with what is the
138:26 - mobile net model what works well what
138:27 - doesn't work well and you know the net
138:30 - one of the things that I really want to
138:31 - show you how to do which I will do in a
138:33 - future video in this series is use the
138:36 - mobile net model only as a starting
138:38 - point so the mobile net model is a
138:39 - starting point but I can then to tree
138:42 - train it with some custom images and
138:44 - some new labels so by golly I could get
138:46 - that mobile net model to recognize
138:48 - puffins if I wanted it to so thanks for
138:52 - tuning in it's not a thing you say do
138:55 - you tune into videos I don't know it's a
138:57 - live stream if you're watching this now
138:58 - thanks for watching okay and stay tuned
139:01 - I'm just gonna keep going through and
139:02 - show you more features of the ml 5
139:05 - library what should I do next I don't
139:10 - know I think I might do I'm not sure yet
139:19 - watching the description will say next
139:23 - video what's the error because I used
139:36 - the puffin okay let me just check so I'm
139:38 - gonna saying something interesting which
139:39 - I'm curious about I'm going to take this
139:41 - out of here then I'm gonna put it back
139:45 - here this should do exactly the same
139:46 - thing it's just the shorthand to put the
139:52 - video in the constructor no I don't know
139:57 - why that doesn't work so this is
140:00 - supposed to work from I should work with
140:03 - the video you can manually pass in the
140:06 - element or you can give it you know if
140:09 - there's a video element you can give it
140:10 - to the
140:10 - instructor so I don't know why that
140:11 - didn't work all right I got time for
140:24 - this coding challenge all right I saw it
140:39 - okay so this I think concludes my
140:46 - introduction to the ml 5 library I I
140:49 - don't know I don't know hopefully it was
140:57 - it give me your feedback I mean it was
140:59 - anybody watching this tote like the the
141:02 - intended audience knows a little bit of
141:04 - JavaScript maybe use p5 never did a
141:07 - machine learning before do you feel like
141:10 - you're on your way to something maybe
141:23 - speaking of which can you cover
141:25 - convolutional nets yes so that's
141:27 - actually what I was gonna do next in my
141:29 - tensor flow GS series so let me think
141:32 - about this for a second
141:34 - I'm just you well look I'm live now so
141:41 - if I go I don't know where this is gonna
141:43 - live so this is the these are like the
141:49 - these are sort of like the non ml 5
141:52 - machine learning playlist that I have
141:56 - and Afonso writes I thought it people
142:01 - are complicated Wow
142:03 - yes that's a good that's a good bit of
142:05 - feedback there these are these are the
142:09 - more complicated ones so it doesn't make
142:11 - sense for this playlist to be in here I
142:14 - think this playlist is just going to be
142:15 - actually I think it's gonna just be a
142:17 - new playlist and it'll be called
142:20 - exactly this ml 5ks a beginner's guide
142:26 - to machine learning in the browser great
142:34 - ok all right so now let's do a coding
142:42 - challenge let's go into the weekend
142:44 - let's go get our evening herbal tea or
142:48 - beer or kale wheatgrass smoothie
142:53 - whatever helps us to just feel like
142:55 - we're at home more relaxed it's time for
142:59 - the weekend we're gonna get there I'm
143:01 - gonna get there but I'm gonna do a
143:02 - coding challenge first you're gonna have
143:04 - to give me a few minutes to get myself
143:05 - reoriented for that
143:07 - [Music]
143:17 - [Music]
143:45 - so hold on I just got a sever a second
143:48 - so kayo asked can you do some machine
143:52 - learning tutorial for beginners that are
143:53 - having the first contact with it and
143:57 - brach back asked the question so that
144:00 - was the point of today I done I can't
144:04 - say that I did it successfully but right
144:06 - now there will be three edited video
144:09 - tutorials that come out of this which
144:11 - are intended for people who's with the
144:14 - first contact with machine learning now
144:16 - so that you can start with Bracke Bracke
144:18 - asks another question which is where
144:20 - should I start learning about machine
144:21 - learning on the coding train channel
144:23 - until those videos come up this is a bit
144:26 - hard to find whoops I need a better way
144:28 - of organizing all this this is the
144:32 - perennial thing but right now if I go to
144:34 - youtube.com slash the coding train
144:37 - scroll down and go to this one here
144:41 - neural networks and machine learning
144:43 - click here and now I would say you could
144:49 - you could start with you can technically
144:52 - skip session 1 & 2 if you want and just
144:55 - start with session 3 which is basically
144:58 - [Music]
145:00 - an intro to the idea of machine learning
145:03 - and you can see with me a bunch of
145:06 - different algorithms and more of the
145:07 - math behind it so and then I'm talking
145:09 - an intro to neural networks then I make
145:12 - a doodle classifier then I look at
145:14 - tensorflow J yes I make a color
145:16 - classifier and then there's this neuro
145:17 - evolution thing which links back to Gen
145:19 - I got so this is what there's a lot of
145:21 - material here so this is where you would
145:23 - want to start ml 5 is in parallel to
145:26 - this without a lot of the lower level
145:29 - details so yeah ok alright so now let me
145:43 - the coding coding challenge here I need
145:51 - to open up terminal again
146:04 - animated sprite okay tonight is that
146:10 - right I don't know what I I know why
146:13 - forgot its G - B okay and I made it
146:20 - sprite now I can go here I can close the
146:32 - ml5 stuff I can delete the libraries
146:36 - here and I can let's go back to 640 480
146:54 - and
146:55 - [Music]
147:04 - okay
147:08 - all right so I think I'm ready for the
147:10 - coding challenge all right
147:19 - oh wait wait wait where is the I got to
147:24 - do something here downloads I got to get
147:30 - the animation that I'm going to use
147:33 - which is this and actually I'm pretty
147:46 - sure I just need to fix something here
147:50 - [Music]
148:03 - and nowhere I'll explain everything
148:07 - a minute just getting myself organized
148:10 - JSON format or just want to make sure
148:13 - this JSON is right yep okay so I think
148:19 - I'm in good shape here that's the horse
148:22 - animation and great alright
148:46 - so this is the last thing I'm gonna do
148:49 - today it's uh it's I'm gonna do a coding
148:56 - challenge to make a variable-speed
148:59 - animated sprite that duplicates itself
149:01 - something like that and this is an
149:06 - example that I made I guess I will I
149:08 - don't know why I'm talking about this
149:09 - now but this was from 2011 this is like
149:14 - this is a processing example
149:40 - all right the weekend is coming I see it
149:44 - in front of me okay I'm ready that was
150:15 - bound to happen eventually okay got a
150:17 - cycle the cameras what's the chance let
150:22 - me see I should probably erase the
150:24 - whiteboard because I might want to use
150:25 - it so apologies
150:50 - you know it's really sad sometimes I
150:53 - feel like for the livestreams I should
150:55 - just play whatever music I want and just
150:57 - let the YouTube copyright overlords just
151:05 - monetize the videos because I just want
151:08 - to play interesting fun music maybe I
151:13 - can eventually make a lot more had some
151:17 - time could compose some more original
151:20 - coding train music or get more
151:22 - submissions from people I mean I I
151:26 - wouldn't play the videos in the park
151:29 - deep music in the parts that we're
151:30 - becoming the edited videos
152:02 - don't mind me I'm just here everything a
152:05 - whiteboard and you're watching whoo it's
152:09 - hot it's getting warm I wonder if it's
152:10 - still raining let's open the door just
152:12 - for a second I don't think it's like I
152:24 - can't even my watch it's 7:30
152:28 - on a Friday evening I wish I could like
152:32 - make the camera like a roaming camera
152:35 - and then I could like go out into the
152:37 - hallway I'm just looking to see if it's
152:39 - raining still doesn't it looks like
152:42 - maybe the rain stopped
152:54 - all right
153:04 - hello welcome to a coding challenge in
153:08 - this coding challenge I am going to make
153:10 - an animated sprite this is actually a
153:14 - page on my website I have a website yes
153:16 - thank you very much with an example that
153:19 - I made
153:20 - apparently seven years ago you can
153:22 - download the code for this it's made in
153:24 - processing and it is loading a sequence
153:29 - of images and playing those images in
153:31 - sequence in multiple places at different
153:33 - speeds to create this running person
153:37 - thing across the screen so I'm going to
153:39 - try to do something similar I'm gonna do
153:40 - it at p5 so I'm gonna look at what does
153:42 - it mean to load a sprite sheet what is a
153:45 - sprite sheet even to chop up that sprite
153:49 - sheet into lots of little images and
153:51 - then to play those images as a sequence
153:52 - and make an animated sprite class that
153:55 - you can use and this is a very common
153:57 - technique used in games and all sorts of
153:59 - other stuff so let's get started down
154:02 - thank you - hold on a sec oh wait thank
154:11 - you - thank you - dragon z p who
154:19 - suggested that i use this wonderful
154:21 - image sequence of a running horse which
154:24 - comes from open game art org this is
154:27 - under a Creative Commons license
154:29 - so I need to attribute it it which I'm
154:33 - doing right now
154:34 - hello I'm using this but I can so you
154:36 - can find a lot of free and open art that
154:40 - you can use here so I'm gonna use this
154:42 - if you if I were to click here and just
154:45 - download the assets we would see that it
154:47 - would actually come as separate images
154:48 - which I find to be very nice because I
154:51 - like to load them one at a time but
154:53 - what's actually often done and more
154:55 - efficient is to actually and I have this
154:58 - right here to load a single image so
155:01 - this is what's known as a sprite sheet a
155:03 - sprite sheet is a single image that has
155:06 - each frame of an animation for that
155:09 - sprite why is it called a sprite in the
155:11 - first place pause
155:28 - I'm looking for a sprite in animation
155:33 - sprite computer graphics
155:39 - why is it called the sprite
155:46 - Spray
155:49 - our key games oh I cannot find it the
155:58 - term sprite huh
156:09 - ah here we go look at this
156:23 - look at this in the category of you
156:27 - learned something new every day
156:28 - the term sprite was first used in the
156:30 - graphic sense by one of the definers of
156:33 - the Texas Instruments 99 18 a video
156:36 - display processor I'll let you continue
156:37 - to read this interesting Wikipedia page
156:40 - about the history of sprites but the way
156:42 - that we think of sprites today and in
156:45 - particular a sprite sheet today is
156:47 - multiple frames of an animation within a
156:50 - single image and this here is a PNG
156:52 - image so it has transparency so if I
156:55 - were to go I should just go to the
156:56 - desktop and open this up you can see it
156:58 - right here here it is again so what is
157:01 - it that I want to do what I want to do
157:03 - is load this image I want to get each
157:07 - frame out of it and then I want to show
157:10 - them one at a time in sequence so this
157:12 - is not necessary but again thank you to
157:15 - dragon who submitted this also sent me a
157:20 - JSON file so this is actually quite
157:22 - convenient this is a JSON file that
157:25 - actually has the information about where
157:28 - each frame of the sprite is in that
157:30 - image it has its XY knits width and
157:32 - height now it turns out this is really
157:33 - just a grid so I could probably just do
157:35 - this mathematically very easy easily but
157:38 - this is sort of nice that I can maybe
157:39 - load this in so let's get started with
157:41 - this right now
157:42 - so first thing I want to do is I am
157:44 - going to write a preload function I'm
157:46 - using again the p5 library and preload
157:49 - allows me to load media assets before
157:51 - the program begins sort of save me from
157:53 - callbacks and promises and that sort of
157:55 - stuff
157:55 - which is useful but I don't need that
157:57 - right now so I'm gonna say let sprite
158:00 - sheet be the variable for the image and
158:04 - let sprite data be the variable for the
158:08 - data so I'm gonna say sprite data equals
158:11 - load JSON and what was that called it's
158:15 - called
158:15 - a horse JSON and I've done something
158:19 - horrible here and then I'm gonna say
158:21 - sprite sheet equals load image horse dot
158:28 - PNG just to make sure everything's
158:30 - working let's draw the sprite sheet to
158:35 - the canvas
158:36 - and in setup lets console dot log the
158:40 - sprite data so this is the first step I
158:42 - and again this is a bit of over this is
158:45 - this is a lot of extra stuff like you
158:47 - know I could just load a bunch of images
158:49 - alright only sou me the JSON file but
158:51 - this is nice I like it I like it
158:52 - ok so let's go back whoops
158:56 - and of course everything's gone wrong so
159:00 - it couldn't get horse JSON and it
159:02 - couldn't get horse to PNG why because
159:04 - it's in a folder
159:06 - I always forget this I put it in a
159:08 - folder called horse so I need to add the
159:12 - directory path to the images there we go
159:15 - so we can see this came in so I
159:18 - definitely have the data there right I
159:21 - have the position and the native of each
159:23 - element and then why don't I see ah so
159:27 - I'm trying to draw the image and I
159:29 - completely forgot if I'm going to draw
159:30 - the image I've got to say where to draw
159:32 - the image and I'm gonna draw it at 0-0
159:36 - there we go Oh timeout for a second I'm
159:44 - getting text messages ok this is
159:47 - important I have to
160:14 - hold on hold on everybody
160:17 - just give pologize bear with me this is
160:20 - this is a something something I need to
160:23 - just deal with when it's uh okay okay
160:28 - hopefully I'm gonna be able to finish up
160:31 - here soon okay
160:41 - okay all right
160:44 - read the comments Dan read the comments
160:50 - what comments all right all right okay
160:58 - all right I don't know what's going on
161:01 - in the chat but there we go okay okay so
161:10 - next step what I want to do now is I
161:13 - don't want to just display the entire
161:15 - sprite sheet I want to display each
161:18 - piece of it one at a time so let me go
161:21 - and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
161:22 - create a variable and I'm gonna say let
161:24 - animation equal an array so the array is
161:28 - going to be each frame an image for each
161:30 - frame of the animation so assuming I
161:32 - have that data I can see if I look at
161:35 - the JSON file right once again all of
161:39 - the all of the data is in a JSON array
161:43 - called frames so I'm going to say sorry
161:46 - back into the code I'm gonna say let
161:49 - frames equal sprite data dot frames I
161:56 - don't that's totally necessary for let I
161:58 - equals 0 I is less than frames dot
162:00 - length I plus plus and then I'm gonna
162:04 - get sorry I'm gonna look at the JSON
162:06 - again and now for each one I want to
162:08 - know about the position this X Y width
162:10 - and height is what's important to me I'm
162:13 - having trouble so I want to say let
162:16 - pause equal frames index I position and
162:20 - then now pause has all of the stuff in
162:24 - it for grabbing a particular image so
162:25 - watch but I'm gonna say let image equal
162:29 - sprite sheet and I'm gonna use a
162:33 - function called get so get is a function
162:36 - in the p5 library that allows you to get
162:40 - part of an image I could get a single
162:42 - pixel I could get the whole image I
162:43 - could get a section of it and in this
162:45 - case what I want is this section of the
162:49 - image the X and y with a particular
162:51 - width and height
162:53 - then what I want to do is just put that
162:56 - into that array so now this is really
163:00 - all I want to do is loop through every
163:02 - frame grab it out of the spreadsheet now
163:04 - again a convention might be this is one
163:07 - way of doing it which I which arguably
163:09 - might not be the quote-unquote best or
163:11 - most efficient way you can actually just
163:12 - leave everything in a sprite sheet and
163:14 - later I could just be like when it's
163:15 - time to draw stuff I could pull stuff
163:17 - out but I'm choosing to in setup just
163:19 - pull out the sections of the image and
163:21 - I'm gonna console.log that array now and
163:25 - we can see I have an array with seven
163:27 - images in it so now if I were to say
163:31 - draw image animation index zero that's
163:38 - all I see is that one if I were to say
163:40 - draw animation index two I see that one
163:44 - so this is working and guess what
163:45 - animation frame count what and then
163:49 - can't read a property width of undefined
163:52 - so you saw it for a second there and
163:54 - then it went away why did it go away
163:56 - well it went away because there's only
163:59 - seven images there so I could say
164:01 - modulus the animation dot length now
164:05 - somebody who I got this great YouTube
164:07 - comment the other day saying that I'm
164:09 - saying modulus and modulo incorrectly I
164:11 - don't remember what it was time out for
164:14 - a second
164:18 - where was that I'm gonna find that
164:19 - comment where was that comment hold on
164:29 - I got to find that comment comments
164:57 - sorry it wasn't that long ago so I'm
164:59 - just scrolling through I'm gonna find it
165:03 - this is obviously incredibly high
165:06 - priority
165:16 - oh come on how I'm gonna find it it's
165:22 - not that long ago I just saw it earlier
165:24 - today I guess I could search there's a
165:29 - thing where you could search let me do
165:31 - this search I'm so silly search comments
165:36 - much search there it is
165:42 - okay this was on recommence sequence
165:45 - part 2 ok let's find this comment
166:01 - oops
166:14 - okay I found in the comment the operator
166:17 - is called modulo and the number
166:19 - following it is called the modulus okay
166:21 - and goal on Levin came on the Kody
166:24 - training to the guest video about that
166:25 - operation but what this operation does
166:27 - for me in the code right now the modulo
166:29 - operation is it gives me a modulus value
166:32 - that's always between 0 and the end of
166:35 - the array so it's the remainder of
166:37 - division so this frame count modulo
166:40 - animation dot length watch what this
166:43 - does now I see that animation repeating
166:46 - and look at that look at it it's the
166:48 - horse it's just running and running and
166:50 - running and running and running great so
166:52 - I've completed part one when I'm gonna
166:55 - kiss keep going this is one video of
166:56 - this coding challenge I've got the
166:59 - animation playing it out but here's the
167:02 - thing what I want to do now is I need to
167:05 - figure out some way of encapsulating the
167:07 - idea of this animation into an object so
167:11 - I could then make many of them so what
167:14 - I'm gonna do to do that and I think what
167:16 - I want to do I think I want to make a
167:18 - new JavaScript file I'm gonna call it
167:20 - sprite j/s and I am going to in index of
167:26 - HTML I need to make sure that I refer to
167:28 - it and then in sprite j/s I'm gonna make
167:33 - a class called sprite and then when I
167:36 - create this what what when I create the
167:38 - sprite with a constructor I want to give
167:41 - it a few things I wanted to have a speed
167:43 - and I wanted to have it I'm gonna give
167:46 - it like an animation so basically that
167:49 - animation will be the sequence of images
167:52 - that's supposed to play and then it's
167:55 - also going to have a speed which is like
167:58 - how fast does it play it through so the
168:02 - idea here being that now I can say let
168:07 - me just do a variable called horse and
168:11 - I'm gonna say horse equals a new sprite
168:15 - with these frames of animation and a
168:18 - speed of 1 and
168:22 - here I'm gonna say horse show and maybe
168:29 - I just want to say something like horse
168:32 - dot animate so like our next frame or
168:37 - something I don't know what what makes
168:38 - the most sense but I'll just call it
168:39 - animate right now and I'll put it after
168:41 - so this means if the idea of this sprite
168:43 - if I want to show it and animate it in
168:45 - the sprite class I need a show function
168:48 - and I need an animate function now if
168:54 - I'm gonna have a show function that's
168:58 - basically going to be exactly this but
169:03 - the point here is that I want to get
169:05 - away from using frame count and so what
169:10 - I want is to have another variable that
169:12 - just keeps track of the index like where
169:15 - am I in the animation so I can use that
169:17 - instead of frame count this dot index
169:20 - and this by the way has to be this dot
169:22 - animation dot length and this has to be
169:24 - this dot animation I like and you know
169:26 - it would be really nice to have a length
169:28 - variable I think cuz I'm gonna probably
169:31 - need that a lot so let's just make it
169:35 - that just like makes the code a little
169:37 - bit nicer to look at alright so this
169:40 - should work and then in animation I just
169:42 - say this dot index plus plus or plus
169:46 - equal this speed so the idea here is
169:49 - speed is controlling the speed of the
169:52 - animation so I've basically taken the
169:54 - idea I've created an object that has
169:56 - stored in it an array of images
169:59 - that's the animation it has the length
170:01 - of that array it has speed how fast
170:03 - roads cycle through them and where is it
170:05 - currently so now if we run this and I've
170:10 - got some error here sprite digest line
170:12 - ten this dot animation this dot index so
170:16 - let's just let's just look at some stuff
170:20 - here to see what's going on
170:22 - Oh animation is one oh I put things in
170:26 - the wrong order ah this is a very common
170:29 - programming error look at this I wasn't
170:32 - doing this quickly and in here say horse
170:34 - equals new sprite
170:36 - animation comma one so add the image
170:39 - sequences first then speed number is
170:42 - second and in here I put the speed first
170:46 - and the animation second so I got to
170:50 - reverse those order so that they match
170:51 - and then there we go
170:54 - we're fine now so I've got to where I
170:56 - was before but the interesting thing
170:59 - here is that now guess what this sprite
171:04 - can have an X and it can have a Y and so
171:14 - it could be basically I could be drawing
171:18 - it at this dot X this not Y so then when
171:24 - I create it I could say I wanted at one
171:26 - hundred 100 comma 1 now it's there this
171:33 - leads me to be able to say okay now I
171:37 - want to have horses I want to have a
171:39 - bunch of horses I'm going to say for let
171:42 - I equals 0 I is less than 5 I plus plus
171:49 - horses index I is a new sprite at 0
171:53 - comma I times 50 and then I want to say
172:00 - for I'm going to use a for of loop let
172:03 - horse of horses and I'm going to go
172:09 - through all those and show and animate
172:11 - all of them so now look at this I've got
172:14 - a whole bunch there they're all right
172:16 - there together maybe I want to just
172:18 - space them out a little more I could be
172:19 - thoughtful about the math of this oops I
172:24 - must not have saved there we go so this
172:27 - is good enough for right now I've got a
172:29 - whole I've got a bunch of them but look
172:31 - it now here's the thing what if I don't
172:34 - want them all to be matched up at the
172:36 - exact same speed what if I were to say
172:41 - let's make the speeds random so let's
172:45 - make the speeds random somewhere between
172:48 - 0.1
172:50 - and one point I think that's actually
172:52 - the fastest speed that that number one
172:55 - so let's do that what happens all right
172:57 - I immediately get an error what is the
173:00 - error that I get it cannot read property
173:03 - with Ubuntu fine spray Tijs line 12
173:05 - well the issue here is by definition if
173:09 - I go to sprite KS line 12 look at this
173:13 - this dot index modulus this dot length
173:17 - this works just fine if the index is
173:20 - zero one two three four five if it's a
173:22 - whole number if it's a whole number it
173:25 - can apply the modulo so I said it wrong
173:27 - again operation and it gets another hole
173:30 - number which is an index into an array
173:32 - arrays only have whole number indices
173:35 - but if I start saying plus 0.2 or point
173:38 - three I'm gonna get these numbers that
173:39 - aren't valid indices into an array well
173:42 - this is actually quite fixable and let's
173:44 - just do this let index equal floor so
173:49 - all I need to do is floor this dot index
173:52 - before I apply modulo and then I can put
173:55 - that in here right so floor is an
173:58 - operation that just eliminates the
174:00 - decimal point I want the index itself to
174:03 - go up slowly by a decimal point but I
174:05 - only want to show you know I have fewer
174:07 - frames I want to show the same frame a
174:09 - bunch of times so it's if it's point two
174:12 - it's gonna take five frames for it to
174:14 - get all the way up to the next whole
174:16 - number if it's point one it's going to
174:18 - take ten frames so this should do the
174:20 - trick now and we can see look at this
174:22 - they're all going at different speeds
174:25 - and they're running in place I might as
174:29 - well have them move now right so why not
174:32 - also have them move this dot X plus
174:35 - equal this dot speed and maybe the speed
174:41 - that they're running doesn't really feel
174:42 - right so even though it's the speed of
174:44 - going through the index I probably
174:45 - should increase that my scale of like
174:48 - five let's try that this looks a bit
174:52 - more realistic now I have it looks like
174:55 - they're sort of moving at speed and then
174:57 - I could obviously do something like if
174:59 - this dot X is greater than
175:02 - with then I want to say is this dot x
175:05 - equals negative I want to kind of put
175:08 - them off the screen negative this dot
175:12 - animation index 0 dot with so I'm just
175:16 - pulling I know that might make sense for
175:18 - me to make that a variable like this dot
175:21 - W equal this dot animation index 0 you
175:25 - know this is assuming all the images
175:27 - have the same width and that way I could
175:29 - just say put it off screen here so let's
175:31 - run this one more time and guess what
175:34 - I now have I believe a recreation of
175:37 - that example that I made where I have a
175:39 - bunch of horses all moving at different
175:41 - speeds through the animation and you
175:45 - know now the world is my digitally
175:49 - simulated virtual reality Easter so to
175:51 - speak and then I could I could grab any
175:54 - sequence of images I could have
175:56 - different sprites have different image
175:57 - sequences I could start designing the
175:58 - background I could have them you know I
176:01 - could apply physics to the way that the
176:02 - the X Y position moves around the screen
176:05 - I could start having collisions the
176:06 - point is that anything that you've
176:08 - anything that I've made in all my nature
176:10 - of code or other coding challenges that
176:12 - have an object moving around the screen
176:14 - the simple games this would allow me to
176:17 - have an animated sprite and I might even
176:19 - further want to encapsulate the idea of
176:22 - a sprite oh this would be a great place
176:24 - for me to talk about inheritance so I
176:27 - could then make other objects that
176:30 - extend that's an inheritance term sprite
176:33 - so I could make horses that are animated
176:35 - sprites or frogs they're animated
176:37 - sprites or puffins and puppet doesn't
176:39 - really do it so I could that's okay I'm
176:42 - a little bit off the of the rails here
176:43 - in my discussion let's think about this
176:45 - what could you do know what thing is
176:47 - what would happen if I gave it a
176:49 - negative speed I think mine would break
176:51 - so this is a little challenge to you
176:53 - could you make this work with negative
176:58 - speeds right it breaks so this example
177:01 - that I made doesn't support going
177:04 - through the animation backwards so try
177:07 - to add that could you make something
177:09 - like this that has different animations
177:12 - for each op so there's maybe five things
177:14 - but they're differ
177:15 - and each one has its own animation
177:17 - sequence could you do that so could you
177:19 - design your own sprite sheet so don't
177:21 - even do any code make your own sprite
177:23 - sheet and run it with this code exactly
177:25 - so there's so many things you could do
177:26 - please share with me I've been the
177:31 - comments on Twitter or at the link to
177:33 - the coding challenge URL in this video's
177:37 - description there's a way you can submit
177:38 - any versions that you make on your own
177:40 - thanks for watching this coding
177:43 - challenge animated sprite
177:57 - what did I owe ya slower
178:01 - add a rotation to it and incrementing by
178:04 - any integer will be too fast all right I
178:06 - think I think I'm good I think I'm done
178:12 - sorry I have to go home so I so but I
178:18 - will see did I miss anything super
178:20 - important there or was this challenge
178:26 - good enough for right now thank you
178:30 - everybody for tuning in I'm good
178:34 - everybody says I'm fine great so one
178:36 - thing I need to do is before I leave
178:39 - I've got a upload the code I'm gonna hit
178:43 - to stop recording I'm not gonna stop
178:46 - streaming just because I want this to go
178:49 - to disk all right is it possible to use
178:55 - ml5 with no task moto that's a good
178:59 - question it's definitely possible use
179:00 - tensorflow yes with node and I don't
179:03 - know about MF I don't know that I don't
179:04 - believe we're supporting that yet but
179:06 - that's a really good question okay so
179:13 - next week I don't know my schedule for
179:16 - next week Friday evenings have been
179:19 - working late in the afternoon I've been
179:20 - working pretty well for me so I might
179:22 - expect that to be the time next week I
179:24 - would love to squeeze one more to live
179:28 - streams in next week it might only be
179:30 - one would love to squeeze in two so
179:33 - because I'm actually going away again
179:36 - for a few weeks so I'm gone for about
179:40 - three weeks of August so August well
179:42 - things will really slow down I have been
179:46 - doing an accounting of my live streams
179:47 - to make sure it like again with the with
179:51 - the crowdfunding stuff my commitment is
179:53 - to four live streams a month and some
179:55 - months I end up doing more in some
179:57 - months less like I said look over it
179:58 - over the period of a year but I this is
180:01 - my second live stream of July I'll
180:03 - certainly get one more in next week's
180:04 - which will be three in August I might
180:06 - only have to
180:08 - but I pretty sure that I've done a lot
180:10 - more in jus in in May and June and I can
180:13 - also catch up and walk in September so
180:14 - anytime anybody feels like I'm not to be
180:16 - enough you know let me know
180:18 - again the complaints office for is down
180:22 - the street in lower Manhattan near the
180:23 - courthouse apparently and yeah so thanks
180:32 - for I don't I don't have anything else
180:33 - to say I would love to hear your
180:35 - feedback on ml5 wanting to hear from
180:38 - things that you make I am going to go
180:41 - only night but I did get a new sponsor
180:43 - and you know this is the undressed tiger
180:48 - thank you so much for the sponsorship la
180:51 - I appreciate it so sponsors you need to
180:55 - look in the community tab and they're
180:57 - our sponsor only posts there that have a
180:59 - link to a Google Form so enter your
181:01 - information in that Google form I will
181:03 - mail you stickers and you will also get
181:05 - an invitation to the slack channel and I
181:12 - am doing another mailing hopefully of
181:14 - stickers oh why it's just an email about
181:17 - that hopefully next week although if you
181:20 - sponsor today I don't know if I'm gonna
181:21 - get you into that mailing because I've
181:23 - already sort of put together but anyway
181:24 - I don't know what's happy with that but
181:26 - you'll get an invitation to slack
181:27 - channel and you'll be able to ask there
181:29 - so I thank you Andreas for sponsoring
181:32 - it's very much appreciated I am looking
181:36 - for a volunteer to design spa emojis for
181:41 - the SATs for the sponsors to use that's
181:44 - like a YouTube feature and icons for
181:47 - that like right now it's like the circle
181:49 - with these two lines I guess it's
181:50 - supposed to be like an S but anybody
181:52 - wants to volunteer to help design more
181:54 - emojis and icons just let me know in the
181:58 - slack channel or on Twitter at Schiffman
182:00 - you just send them to me I will upload
182:02 - them into the system alright so that's
182:09 - that thank you everybody for watching it
182:13 - is so appreciative I'm excited to be
182:15 - going once again on another machine
182:17 - learning journey with the ml5 library
182:19 - doing more coding challenges Oh little
182:21 - foreshadow
182:22 - I this is my this is the coding
182:25 - challenge I'm working on this is one I
182:26 - actually have to prepare for I've been
182:28 - like obsessed with this idea of like
182:30 - visualizing for D and then 5d and 6d
182:33 - there's a wonderful video Lee s.o.s this
182:39 - is not gonna be right that I watched the
182:40 - other day no let's do tesseract yeah
182:46 - this video understanding 4d the
182:48 - tesseract by lay I Oh SOS this is a
182:51 - great video I highly recommend this is a
182:52 - nice one too I watched both of these but
182:56 - I'm but I need to figure out I think I'm
182:58 - gonna do this in processing in P 3d and
183:00 - I want to do actual like the rotation
183:04 - the matrix math for rotations and so I
183:07 - think I need to make a couple video
183:09 - tutorials about that I need to kind of
183:10 - like figure that out a little bit so
183:12 - that's coming soon to a YouTube channel
183:15 - near you coding challenge 4d rotation
183:18 - hypercube tesseract would then be
183:21 - challenged to the viewer to do a 5d one
183:24 - alright thanks everybody and I will see
183:30 - you next next week at least once maybe
183:33 - twice subscribe and click the alarm bell
183:36 - if you want a notification it will show
183:40 - up when I scheduled on YouTube I usually
183:43 - do try to do that 24 hours in advance
183:45 - but it'll be one day next week okay
183:47 - goodbye
183:47 - I'm gonna hit the stop streaming button
183:49 - which is over here and then I'm gonna go
183:52 - home and begin the weekend please enjoy
183:53 - your warm cold caffeinated alcoholic non
183:59 - CAF decaffeinated non alcoholic beverage
184:01 - of choice relax take some deep breaths
184:03 - look outside at a view read a book get
184:07 - away from code for a little while and
184:09 - come back to it when you're feeling
184:10 - refreshed
184:11 - I need like a catchphrase I'm supposed
184:14 - to have a catchphrase this is my
184:15 - catchphrase - where do i click stop the
184:22 - livestream oh here it is I'm now
184:24 - clicking the stop streaming button
184:25 - goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hello good evening happy Friday it is me on time dare I say did I possibly could I possibly have actually hit the start button maybe thirty seconds early I'm checking the chat I don't even know if I'm livestreaming nobody's even said hello to me yeah I'm gonna go on as if I am and then I will feel foolish later when it turns out that no one has seen anything that I've said right now okay so I don't know if you are somewhere in the world where you could be watching this this live stream of the lunar eclipse I would suggest that you probably turn off watching me right now and go outside I don't know but whatever the appropriate way to watch this is please go and do that I guess this is an image from the Bereket Observatory I do not know where that is in the world somebody I'm sure will inform me rather quickly uh Bruno asks by the way Schiffman did you adjust the green screen filter back why yes I did I did adjust the green screen back and I thought to myself this morning let me not we're even though that's my new favorite shirt it's like blue it's got a flamingo on it I decide to put on this shirt which is you know admittedly my second favorite second favorite shirt due to the flowery nature of it but looking over here in my preview monitor where I see myself I'm a little bit worried about the video compression YouTube compression algorithm thing and it's possible I am I am safe I am wearing a safe as you know I am the kind of person who wears a tshirt under the shirt that has been firmly established but I am wearing a tshirt that can be shown on video today this is in fact a google Summer of Code 2017 tshirt ah wait a second I am also wellprepared today with a few other we were talk about wardrobe let's see if this cameras working good this camera's organized something really I mean shocking this is like shocking you know sit down sit down right now if you're standing actually standing is probably a good thing stretching is good don't sit for too long don't Stanford alum move around a lot that's my advice in general but now you might want to sit down something insane I have never done this before never worn this before on a live stream shorts I'm wearing shorts it is very hot in York City actually if you are in New York City right now I'm gonna go out I mean I don't think you can hear it in here unfortunately I was in the hallway a moment ago this massive Thunder there's I got like the alerts on my phone flash flood warning so they're safe let's see if we can see how the storm is right now you can't you can you can hopefully hear my audio and I open this window for a second to give you some audio of the storm know about this window yes okay I'm not gonna be able open these windows you can't hear there was like incredible thunder anyway so yes Schwartz was saying uh yeah alright so oh yes heat wave heat wave some of your experience in quite a heat wave it's pretty it's not it's not a super heat wave here in New York but it is quite warm or though now it is pouring pouring pouring pouring rain okay so how are you lunar eclipse I'll put the lunar eclipse away you know I'm tempted to do the whole thing and the rocket launch thing and I make myself small and I'm standing on top of the lunar thing and blah blah blah but I think I I shall put it away for now I was gonna talk about red burns I have some things open you know oh right also all the things I've read to talk about I am here with my space Mellon I went to a different shop II that's spelled sh oppe which is the way I like to spell shop e where I purchased some of this delicious magic space melon this trick is getting really old or any good soothing cool it's a low acid hmm wonderful wonderful what what am I here I forgot Wow go to drain I was a very pathetic cream was all okay I'm a timpani sound effect apparently it's 27 seconds long I can barely hear it no no you can hear it you can turn it up much louder now it eventually gets to the end by coding train so coding train is a weekly and at the moment Friday evening probably next Friday evening as well New York City time that is YouTube livestream where I do I waste a lot of time and sometimes do so okay today I have a exciting JavaScript library project that I am planning to spend most of today's livestream talking about is called ml5 I have definitely talked about it before I have an idea for a coding challenge okay I would like to do but first I must thank our sponsor Cody crane is sponsored by water you know in that melon that low that high pH that low acid melon that you were crunching on and you was so delicious you're just like chewing up and swallowing it stuck in your throat well that's when water that's when you need reach for your water water it is liquid and when you drink it it helps do it helps to wash that piece of melon down okay you know these are the things I you know I should really prepare for these live streams which I don't I really should but I don't but even so I really want to get some new sound effects alright 94degree i'm gonna look at the check oh we got a new sponsor that means I wonder if my family is at home that means the lights flash let me be I'll get a text message let's see welcome cryptic Thank You cryptic for sponsoring the channel better hurry before the power goes out ritually so I am in a large institutional building and I have never known the power to go out here of course it did back during hurricane sandy you know which was quite an extreme storm in New York City power goes out you'll know because there's nothing about what I'm doing that does not need power is that the right double negative it all needs power the moment the power goes out this live stream land and then I'll get to go home early on a Friday this is a special weekend for me let's see if anybody in the chat can figure out Oh Simon sorry I'm so easily distracted this is a problem with me and my life streaming but Simon just I assume that's a photo that Simon just took posted in the sponsor patreon actually YouTube's changing the name sponsor to member soon select channel that's a wonderful photo of Eclipse I wish I was there to see it I hope that all of you especially in Europe who are having heat waves and lack of rain you get some water soon I don't think it goes that direction exactly but try to I'm gonna try to send the rain to you from here all right so um I'm just checking the chat for a minute all right so I wonder if there's any new people here today if there's anybody new here sure you left already here after all my nonsense but the this stream is I'm hoping will be really well suited for total beginners I'm I'm doing things I've done things a little bit backwards because I'm learning stuff and trying different things so I am with were looking at ml 5 as a library I am sort of going but going back in time I've done a lot of videos and tutorials that goes all the way in depth but someone in depth into machine learning topics such as neural networks and even lower level machine learning libraries like tensorflow j/s and that's helped me hopefully build a background of knowledge to be able to do what I want to do today which is present a very beginner friendly machine learning library that lives on the surface hiding a lot of the lower level details it has its pros and it's cons of course but with the idea that anybody who watches the tutorials that I produce today could be a beginner and completely new to machine learning and follow along and to the extent that anybody ever learned to anything and watching me learn something so that's my that's my main goal for today I think I will start with that I have a coding challenge that I would like to do which is animated sprite I don't even think it's letting anybody ever suggested it came up in a meeting I was having yesterday and it was a I made an example of this years ago and I it it kind of comes kind of comes up a lot so that'll be useful to make a video about it so toothless des I guess I I'm just all about though sponsor you can sponsor the coding that's the official coding great sponsor scheme song toothless des asks how to become a sponsor it's like a YouTube thing you have to pay but you don't have to please no one is under any obligation whatsoever nobody nobody guessed the special quality of this weekend I'll reveal it at the end of the livestream I think this is what's going on oh the coffee is attacking me and by the way I know I do not normally drink coffee on a Friday evening this is a onetime thing some three liked a light bit of coffee Wow a lot of unsweetened almond milk in there organic not made from scratch you know you can make your own almond milk very easily you go to the grocery store it's their really expensive they put all this stuff in it do you know what you need to make almond milk almonds and Wow what's synergy go to cream brought to you by water hmm okay uhoh Austen fish asks is it the anniversary of your bike accident that is a great guess it is not the bike accident I had last summer which left me with this beautiful scar on my elbow and the inability to straighten my right arm all the way and like all sorts of interesting titanium stuff that's in here that was I believe June 27th good guess though all right so it's been an Irish Coffee no but there will be I like to have that often I might be happening after the livestream if I can make it home torrential flooding of New York City Rostow asks first weekend in the new apartment nope good guess good guess I did move not the first week in the new apartment but good guess good guess good guess alright so let's see here I guess what I'm going to do now is ah Phobos gaming asked I should say is there a way to access the slack channel without paying anything iiiiit pains me and even read that question I did have the option I suppose of not seeing or pretending I didn't see it I did see it and Boas game II got it right by the way yes Phobos gaming did get it correct that is the correct answer pup I was answering Phobos gaming I feel like you know very very good very good good guess I was answering this slack channel thing at the moment the system that I have it's not the best is that the way I'm a funding some of the work that I'm doing as well as creating a smaller community to discuss topics and ask questions is through crowdfunding there are some plenty of unofficial not on the future but are plenty of ways to write comments or join conversation so on Twitter I'm gonna set up a discord I believe for the coding train and I'm open to suggestions and ideas because I do not love the idea of having this sort of like closed community but that's the way it is at the moment as the Sun in the background got a name asks Python plus plus thank you for your super chat donation and by the way when I look on my monitor over there and I move my arm like this the flower shirt starts to like flicker like crazy but maybe you don't actually see that in the livestream Simon writes I'm actually watching this live stream outside to watch the lunar eclipse I hope Simon that your eyes are mostly focused on the lunar eclipse cuz I don't I will be livestreaming again next week you know maybe I won't wear this shirt it's exciting also this is being recorded you can watch it later and the lunar eclipse is really a once in a hopefully not a once in a lifetime is it I don't know one night okay so Karim asks what do we need there was that super chat question did I answer it as the Sun background got a name no it does not but I do want to make that into mochi for sponsors is there uh there was a good question there it was something about what do you need okay so if you're gonna follow along live with me today you're going to need you know you could go and look at my workflow video I know my workflows a little out of date and you can register your complaints at the office of IDE complaints it's down the streets lower Manhattan next to the courthouse but if you're gonna follow along I will explain in the video tutorial what you need but just to give you in advance you're gonna want to text editor you're probably going to want to run a local server on your computer a lot of text editors will come with a local server I have been using the node local a node local server more recently and then you will need a browser and everything else is and then you'll probably want to grab one of my recent code examples it just has like the p5 library imported into it you know if you just take any of my coding challenges and kind of like the recommend one from last week that's what I want to do forgot about that the recommend one from last week down grab that code open it up delete the leak out of the stuff from sketch guess you'll be ready to go okay so actually so before I get started with ml5 j/s let's go to twitter.com slash hashtag coding recommend this one didn't catch fire so to speak like others have but we can see some versions that people made this one by ACT Nellis drost was also inspired by the same number file video so created this last month so this is actually a lot of people made their own visualizations of the number sequence before I even did I love this sort of like the 3d quality of this the spiral nature that's beautiful as requested right to mark oh here is the best version I imagined I believe it's beautiful I would agree I think it's beautiful and we can see here this is one of the the challenges that I pose to the viewer to animate the arcs themselves so you can see this has been successfully done so the arcs don't just stamp on there but they animate this is mine this is from model Madeline Dahlberg let's click on the link and go look here 100 open processing org wonderful site to do your code and click on the screen then enter it enter a number so let's do seven great and so it looks like what this is you can enter a number we see the number sequence and we see the how much is there so what happens if I were to enter something really really big like 1000 Wow cool so I guess that's actually that's 1000 numbers is there's a murder if there's a maximum could that doesn't seem like one thousand number is it that maybe it goes up to 1000 that's the highest number but anyway I love the interactivity of this great work Madeline now I'm going to look at this I like these that just like try a different visual idea some straight lines from Earth on Twitter audiovisual and cmajor okay we've got a listen to this okay I don't know how well you can hear that it's nice so I assume here the difference between what I did first of all in terms of thinking about how to design the quality of the sound in terms of the configuration of the envelope also there's actually applying C major scale here I'm gonna get some more slightly more musical quality out of it audiovisual representation I should really hook up the sound it'll just take me a second don't know why I'm being so if I go here and then I click on multi output device the sound goes through this is nice I like being able to see the things I like about this I love being let's see the number I love seeing like where the where we are in the sequence you know mine was kind of interesting in how it was like scaling automatically but I do love I like that it's fixed here as well this is really nice great work by Tom fedley a learned a new name today recommen the coding recommend challenge here's one I've met some nice use of color this is actually really nice one of the things that's a sort of failing of mine is that it looks like there's so many circles because the the arcs get so close to each other on the top and the bottom but if you alter the color you can see the more spiral nature of it so that's a nice that's nice work and then there's this one from Ahmad and I like this I like being able to see the number line like so including the number line actually there is a nice visual addition to this I think great work everybody so in addition you can still post your your versions of the recommend coding challenge to hashtag coding recommen on twitter you can tag me at Schiffman it helps me find it I don't necessarily just check the hashtag but also I will let's see I think there's at least one if I go to the coding train comm and then I go to coding challenges and right here to recommend sequence and I go here this is also a place you know that Twitter stuff is sort of nice and in theory it might be there you know still next week but this is a place where you can also add your own community contribution through a pull request on github there are some instructions here if you if you click on see how we can see one and what's nice about this is you can include your source code plus plus information about you and your version so let's look at animated arc and here we go and this one I love this what beautiful round of applause for putting it on code pen so it's nice to see this on code pen and this really is we've got this animated animated arc there it's wonderful wonderful work everybody okay so this is one of things I enjoy the most one thing I really enjoy about my week is getting to check out the versions of things that people make for what I made okay I think now we are ready for ml5 j/s I must have a piece of melon I'm going to investigate the chat for a minute oh there's Joss SEC W is in the chat I apologize if I'm mispronouncing your name if anybody wants to phonetically spell it for me that would be helpful burgerbob is asking what about changing your workflow in this stream you know I shout out to Austin from the patron group who has really been soaked mind in understanding because he's made many good points about things that I could do to upgrade my workflow to make things not just well Makela make things easier for me and I'm kind of have a bit of a mental block with this stuff and I tend to not get to it I don't I keep me honest folks viewers out there let's see if I can schedule a specific live stream dedicated only to that sometime before the start of the fall semester which is the day after Labor Day here in New York City in Labor Day holiday in the United States I can't September fourth fifth something like that so bug me about it tweet me call YouTube comment me I think I need to I think the only way I'm gonna do it is if I schedule it as a specific dedicated livestream otherwise it's just gonna be the thing at them I would say like oh yeah I'm gonna get to that today but first let me do these things I'll never get to it it'll be at the bottom of the list our Simon is writing artist color in the gaps of the pattern and then it becomes more colorful yes so um if you watch the numberphile video there is a particular artist who has made kind of coloring pages out of the recommend number sequence and filled in and they're beautiful I encourage you to go check that out and it's interesting to think is there a way to do that with through processing or html5 canvas and p5 would be an interesting challenge although I love the handdrawn quality of that stuff okay processing 3.4 released that's another thing that's worth let's let's take a look where do we find where are those release notes so there is a new processing and I just think it's worth showing this because I think if I go here I think the release notes let's go to releases yes they're here so this is something by the way if you're not in the habit of reading if you're like a processing user and you're really interested in what's new what's fixed following the development of it I highly recommend always reading these release notes whenever and a version like three point four means more significant changes than just going from like three point three point seven to three point three point eight this has to do with something called semantic versioning it's a numbering system you know if it was version 4.0 we'd all be you know opening bottles of champagne and shooting confetti cannons into the air and just like dancing like it's like we're so whatever dancing II but yeah this is just uh and it was like what three point three point eight from people improving for at seven we would enjoy but three point for coding train whistle for processing three point four all right huge batch of bug fixes and updates a bunch of things for Windows better handling in the contributions manager for sites that use HTTP I think actually this broke I I think some of my libraries and example bundles are broken currently because of that maybe they've been fixed or I need to do something alternate error message on Windows do features it's possible to make your own a theme file for processing whoa that is cool that is really cool copy the theme dot txt file from inside the processing folder to your sketchbook and edit away for instance to make a dark theme there's this link here which I would love to go look at I've got I want to just do all this stuff today but I well it's possible to copy the text of the status bar that's wonderful that's super useful py de as a supported extension so double clicking Python sketches will launch the PDE Wow they add added added double and long versions of the data classes internal sort fix the welcome dialog redesign the rename window I can want to look at all this stuff rewrite request image now uses a new version Java updated the copyright and year and launched an about string and then here we go give go hi otherwise known as Gottfried a hand because there are a lot of new things in the Raspberry Pi version process guess what I have I have a I have a project I really want to do sorry I can't figure out the camera went off and it relates to what Ava Ava and the chat just asked will you ever do any some Arduino stuff I do want to do some Raspberry Pi stuff and one of the things I really want to do is I moved to a new apartment and one of the ways that I can't well when I was taking my son to camp we were there were like two buses we could take but you had to go like you couldn't go to one stop and wait for both of them and the MC has this like bus time app so I can like check and see where the buses are we could say oh this one's here this one's here so we could kind of like figure out which bus to go to but if you actually just go to like the bus station are now in the subways they have things like boards that show the next train the time I would like to build one of those for my apartment that just like I can configure it just these two bus routes and these two subway routes I want to see like when all the next trains on the next buses are in order in one display and I so the one thing I don't know I should have checked this before mentioning it is does the MTA provide that realtime data through an API I know that they published the schedules but the schedules is very different than the actual realtime data see I don't publish that realtime data I think through an official API I think I can't make this project but if they do I certainly can and I would the reason why I was thinking this is like me dipping a toe into physical computing because I would love to just make a little um you know get one of those inexpensive I assume they're inexpensive like led well I know those things are called those displays that just show like a certain number of characters and there's little grids of little dots there's a name probably let me get one of those Flipboard things wouldn't that be amazing to build a Flipboard but that's that's way that's there I there's no chance I'm ever gonna manage to do that so melon goggles right Stan I don't really mean but you have been streaming for 30 minutes without telling us anything about the actual subject okay that's a very good point I mean I did mention what the topic was going to be so 7 segment display right sausage so much stuff is going on I can't process all this now I'm getting information about how to pronounce ah oh my god okay I can't play that right now that is no good that's no good ml5 all right all right people are so excited about MFO let's do it apologies so I you know you you're yeah okay so just see me like a couple minutes I'm gonna do ml5 next oh I'm gonna cycle the cameras you know I have to say if you really yeah I might recommend waiting for the edited version of the videos but a lot of you are here and you came I did advertise this as ml5 so let be let me get that going all right so let's think about this it's a good if I prepared wouldn't it be good if I prepare it I think I can I have a bit in my head what I want to talk so this is good so I'm just gonna begin hello welcome to a playlist of videos about machine learning this is a playlist of videos about machine learning for hopefully you who are you maybe you could be anybody you could be like watching this in the year twenty sixty seven from your recliner selfdriving quadcopter and you've you've taken your brain out of these sawing hello welcome to a new playlist of videos this is a playlist I mean you know hopefully there's a bunch of videos in this playlist because I'm just starting to record them now so they don't exist yet but this is about machine learning and it is for the total beginner now there are some caveats here I suppose to that but I really wanted to make something you don't have to have watched any other videos about machine learning on my channel I have others that go more in depth and use different tools this is really meant if you're starting it's totally new to you you heard you've heard the words machine learning you type them into some search bar and have some how you landed here watching from the future leaning back you're you've taken your brain out for its afternoon thawing and you're gelatinous couch is comfortably supporting your skillet skeletal a anyway the point is you're here I'm here hello so I'm going to be using for the set of tutorials a pretty new JavaScript library called ml five the purpose of this first video in the series is really just to talk about two things what is machine learning what is ml five so the one caveat I would say possibly to being a beginner here is that you probably want to have some knowledge and experience with coding itself now that isn't to say that you aren't if you don't you're welcome here please watch I will point you to other videos that can help you fill in some missing gaps but I'm going to assume a little bit of knowledge about programming particularly in JavaScript and I'm also going to be making fairly heavy use of another JavaScript library called p5 so if p5 is new to you I'll refer you to some other p5 tutorials I will but that's going to be a larger large piece of how I build various examples throughout all these videos pause for a second I paid that brain joke before apparently it's like a thing that's always like floating in my head I mean I know it yeah okay wait wait this is the part I was gonna yeah everybody I know exactly what I want to do to talk about ml 5 but I actually like I realized I don't really have in my head prepared a really nice extinct 10,000 steps you see that animation you can it goes the way there you go definition of machine learning guess what I would consider his inputs outputs making sense of date a computer to perform a task to learn to perform a task give me your one set in the chat give me your one sentence definition of machine learning you know what I've actually I should just go to my where is that I had such momentum I should never pause from the content where am I going what am I looking for either some notes that I made yeah looks right field of study this is the classic definition Arthur Samuels machine make machines to learn make computers do my homework what does a neural network so interesting to see everybody's telling machines have do stuff that you don't do it yourself yeah that's actually good that's a good idea a form of artificial perms then to learn on its own yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah these are all great wow these are really good self learning a ID to make it tough go the best ball all right so I'm gonna try to explain it in my own words now just give me a second here replying to messages all right so before I get into what is ml5 which is really the core the probably the core component of this video let's just take a moment to ask ourselves the question what is machine learning here's the thing it's my hope that just I don't need to define that right now because the point of this set of tutorials is to kind of explore that question all along what is machine learning but we need a place to start from and so one thing that's I think important to realize and is that there are a lot of terms that you might have heard one thing that's I think one thing that I think is important to note is that there are a lot of there's a lot of terminology machine learning artificial intelligence deep learning neural networks support vector machines etc I could keep going what are all these things means some are algorithms some are topics of research and so I think I'm really struggling with this really struggling with this go back to it always this is this is the stuff that had the hardest time with because I'm so petrified of saying something like sort of revealing myself like really dumb no idea what I'm talking about which has already been revealed many times ok so before I start talking to you about what is ml5 which is really what I'm here to do let's just ask ourselves a question you know first ones called ml 5 ml for machine learning what is machine learning now there are a lot of lots of terminology out there machine learning deep learning artificial intelligence neural networks the list goes on and on and hopefully the definition that whatever I say to you right now doesn't really matter because we're going to sort of explore this topic of machine learning and all these other other all this other terminology throughout these videos but I think one thing to realize about machine learning you think of this idea of artificial intelligence computers robots taking over the world and they've learned their own language and they're defeating our but you know really what comes down to it brass tacks so to speak machine learning is examining some data a whole lot of numbers and trying to make sense of that data and teaching a computer basically to learn patterns that we can present that's really a and we're not talking about something called supervised learning Europe or even more terminology supervised learning where I'm gonna get I'm gonna get into all that and I've gotten into some of that in other videos you know it'd be good to look at so I just pulled up some notes that I made for a course about artificial intelligence and and and at NYU here and this is sort of the classic definition of machine learning from 1959 Arthur Samuels a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed and so let's think about that for a second this is actually useful and I'm gonna get into ml5 in a second but just just a little bit longer right I might say something like the most simplistic sense I could write a program that has a specific algorithm that says if Mouse X is greater than so let's say this this window has a width between zero and four hundred if Mouse X is greater than 200 then that is the right side can you see this yes greater than 200 is the right side else if Mouse X is less than 200 or just else that's the left side this is me providing the computer so to speak I've written a program with some intelligence it knows how to tell if a point is on the right side or the left side of the window I have written the algorithm for that well machine learning is about teaching a system to understand a data without explicitly writing your own algorithm this might be the most trivial simplistic algorithm ever but the way I would do machine learning is I would say hey machine learning system I'm going to give you lots of information like 350 is on the right side and 301 is on the right side and 212 is on the right side and 273 is on the right side and 100 is on the left side and 97 is on the left side and 24 is on the left side and 198 is on the left side I'm creating a data set and I'm just gonna say here's a lot of stuff I'm not gonna how to don't I'm not gonna give you some specific hardcoded algorithm to know what's on the right or the left I'm just going to create a data set it's going to have a lot of information in it and the machine is going to learn the patterns in that data learn how to make some kind of prediction that's a key word here the prediction being is this point on the right are left based on that data this is the essence of machine learning teaching a computer to perform a task without explicitly programming the algorithm for that task now there's a little convoluted cuz aren't we programming the machine learning algorithm and a sort of program but this is the conceptual idea okay let's see alright oops wrong camera alright so let's see here mmm okay all right Siraj who knows probably more about this than i do is in the chat hello Sirach okay so let's see here how do anybody want to like offer any like significant complaints about that sort of like introductory idea i am all ears I'm looking for my eraser I can't find it because I didn't teach erase it all right all right this is the thing when a lot of the stuff that I've done during the heat during this during the semester like when NYU is actually in session I I usually like will teach some sessions during the day or the day before and then come in the YouTube videos so I've had a sense to sort of like try to explain some stuff and have gotten some feedback people ask questions and I feel like I sort of have a little bit more on my feet under me I think that's probably not true I'm probably just as what's let's leave it at that and I'm gonna move on to where I'm a little bit more comfortable just talking about what is ml 5 y a melon goggles makes a really good point somebody I just think if I can only remember these things when I'm here I guess I could go to amazon.com and buy a cloth right now melon goggle says I should buy a cloth what should I look for for a cloth someone just tweet me a link to like a cloth I should get I'll buy it just can't remember it right now all right all right okay whoops I lost the chat here okay all right alright alright alright here we go there we go okay so now that we've sort of vague terms it's best that I could covered very highlevel Brooke okay so now that we as best as I could made some definition created a definition of machine learning one that the least we can start with and I'm sure I'll hear from you in the comments let's talk about what is ml five so before I talk about what is ml five I want to just mention someone to you red burns who is the founder of the program where I currently teach called ITP red burns is a huge was a huge source of inspiration she was a mentor to me and I wanted to start say I wanted to read a few quotes and we actually have a whole book of red burns quotes but these I think these quotes are really important and they are the kind of driving principles behind a lot of the work that I do but in particular a lot of the reasons and behind the ml5 project so technology is not enough consider the technology I should really move the mouse technology is not enough consider the technology as a tool which in itself could do nothing treat the technology as something that everyone on the team could learn understand and explore freely so this is really important don't believe the hype that expectant people say but it's easy to get caught up in the shining technology stuff but we have to remember that without human beings here on this planet what's the point so while I'm really interested and I get lost in my like interest in just sort of numbers and algorithms and patterns and things like that that's I think a core value that I want to make sure I stay grounded to throughout any time that I'm looking at algorithms and thinking about how to how to use technology how to teach technology how to make use of it so this is actually from an article from the ITP journal adjacent there will be a link to this in this video's description which describes sort of the background about the Machine ml5 project itself at the the end of this video I want to talk about various people who made contributions which I have here on this links I will do that but but but let's talk about what is ml5 so in order to kind of figure out what ml5 is I'm going to try to make some diagrams this is gonna be great I can feel it right now so I'm gonna put ml 5 right here in the center now an important component of this discussion is a library called p5.js another really important component of this discussion I'm gonna put it up here is a library called tensorflow yes and oh boy oh boy another really important part of this discussion is just the library tensorflow itself as well as you know maybe sort of this thing called Kerris which i might refer to so first of all what is ml 5 j s ml 5 GS itself is just a JavaScript library it is a library of functions that you can call from your own JavaScript code so again I mentioned that I'm gonna rely heavily on p5 p5 is also just a JavaScript library p5 is a little bit of a special JavaScript library make a little heart there couple stars because it is really I it doesn't necessarily conform to the standard patterns you might find in other JavaScript libraries it makes a lot of decisions to be as friendly and welcoming and wellsuited for a beginner as it can be so one of things you could do in regular in p5 is you can write a function called set up and any code that you put in set up executes the moment the program starts you can write a function called draw and any code that you put in draw happens in a loop over and over again this is this standard kind of design pattern for writing a program that generates an animation like a game or a piece of interactive art so what I'm saying here is that my examples that I'm going to show you in these video tutorials are using p5.js almost that's like it did the base starting point and then I am also going to import the ml5 library so I need to import both of these libraries and I'll show you how to do that in the in the HTML file which is something you'll see in the code examples and once I have the ml5 library I can start to do things like this ml 5 image classifier and then so this is a function setup is something that sort of specific to p5 draw is something specific to p5 and then image classifier well we kind of know it's specific to ml 5 because I had to write ml five dot image classifier so this is one thing a little bit attached which is no surprise if you watched my videos before but a lot of JavaScript libraries are namespace meaning if I'm going to call a function like the image classification function I've got to say that name the library dot that function name so image classification this is one of the common tasks of common machine learning tasks right I'm gonna say hey machine learning here are some images of kittycats here are some images of puppy dogs learn about them so and we're gonna see how you could do that exact kind of tasks with ml 5 itself ok so this is the basic idea now why did why am I talking about this so here's the thing if you just were wandering around the streets of I don't know Venice Italy I thought of that there are dance streets there no it's all like oh my god that's crazy you're you're paddling through the canals of Venice Italy and you go to the little canoe sound that got no the boat next to and you say do you know how to do machine learning I'm a probably oh you just go use a thing called tensorflow now this is possible they say something like oh you just go use this other thing called like pite or something else but there are many many examples of library's most open source libraries that have a lot of functionality for common machine learning tasks one of the most well known ones of those is called tensorflow this is a project from Google it is open source and most of the time if you were using it you would be writing code in the Python programming language well in my tutorials I'll be writing code in the JavaScript programming languages programming language not in Python well amazingly there happens to be this other thing called tensorflow TAS also developed by Google researchers I will include a lot of information about how you can find out more information about Tesla just and the creative potential address in the video description but this is a version of tensorflow written in JavaScript down truth tensorflow it's really rotten C++ code so even when you write your code in Python it's just like running other stuff that's C++ but that's not the case with tetra fluro Chet touch your floor digest is everything's happening in JavaScript and ml 5 an N and you could go and just use tensorflow digest directly to do your machine learning stuff and I have some video tutorials that talk about that but ml 5 is a project that actually wrap that is a layer it includes tensorflow digest so ml 5 is a library where additional functions were added on top of tensorflow TAS to make certain tasks easier and in truth this is a lowlevel library meaning if you were to use it directly you have to really worry about things like memory management and uh and it's kind of stuff you know it's interesting you can do it but if you're just getting started and want to learn the basics of machine learning and experimented play this is going to be in your way it's gonna make things take longer and so ml 5 is going is a let's goal is to make a lot of the things that you're doing tensorflow digest a bit easier and more accessible ok pause for a second I went on way too long there's a lot of links I love how there's all these the links for the cloth in the chat I'll come back to those later I Dan unfortunately I don't have a good concise I will be doing a live stream also next Friday probably the same exact time and but you have to subscribe to the channel and click the alerts thing that's the best way to know when I'm doing a live stream because you'll get a notification when I schedule it yo yo soy in the chat asks memory management on J s WTF well actually it doesn't seem strange but because a a tension flow at GS is it's actually manipulating data on the GPU directly you have to create these things called tensors and then you have to deallocate the memory when you're done with them and you can watch my other videos about that if you're interested ok ok alright okay so here's the other thing that I really want to discuss there are three I would say I'm gonna give you I'm gonna talk about three components of the fields of machine learning right now there are particular machine learning algorithms one example of that is something that you might have heard of called a neural network this is an algorithm to perform a machine learning task there are many other examples of algorithms there are also there's something known as machine learning models and in particular there's this idea of a pre trained model okay so I want to talk about that in a second and then of course we have this idea of data and data sets so I'm going to circle this here for a moment I'm going to put my stars next to it because this is essentially where we will begin you and me and the people from the future who are watching this video or they'll have time traveled into the paths I don't know whatever this is where we're gonna begin now most machine a lot of machine learning tutorials will start with something like AI now we will look at linear regression it's kind of similar to that thing where I was like I had that line in the middle of the window or the points on the right or the left and we're gonna do linear growth and statistical components of machine learning algorithms but one of the things that is happening in the world today the reason why I'm hoping that this video tutorial and this ml5 library is important and useful is that our lives are increasingly being governed by pre trained models corporations train models to perform a particular task to recognize your face to turn the words you're speaking into text there are questionable as many questionably ethical applications of this there are also fun artistic and playful applications of this so one of the ways to get started as a beginner to machine learning is actually not to learn all the math and learn how to train all your own machine learning systems but to actually make use of some pre trained models that are out there for example the thing that I'll start with in the next video is a model called mobile net this is a model that's been trained to recognize the content of images but there are lots of images that I could show to that model that it will have no knowledge about and other ones that will have wierdly have a incredibly obscure detailed knowledge about why is that well what was the data that was used to train that model what was the algorithm what algorithm is that model using these are the critical important questions that we of citizens of this world increasingly governed and controlled by software need to feel confident and capable of asking and so by taking the get by friendly and accessible or approachable ways of being able to experiment with pre trained models this is a good place to start so this is where the video tutorial series will start and later as I go forward I will also hopefully look at what does it mean to create your own data set what does it mean to use a particular algorithm with your own data to make your own model and save that model so this is pretty much the overview and the machine learning is the thing have to do with numbers it has to do with and and the thing we're going to start with this something called supervised learning really so the idea of we're training a system to learn from existing known data so that it can work with new data and that will I don't know what I was just talking about there look at that crazy diagram alright so machine learning is a thing you the thing people are talking about we want to get some experience playing around of it experimenting with it understanding what it is we're going to use this ml5 library I'm gonna show you how to import it I'm going to show you how to import it into a p5.js sketch and I'm gonna show you how to start to use pre trained models and we're gonna look at what those models do well what they don't do well where do they come from why do they exist where do they come from and why do they exist okay so actually before I go let's look at a couple more things and by the way when I say go you can just click Next I'll be in the next video or you could go to something else but okay coming over here oh shoot sorry I shouldn't read the chat okay alright so I encourage you before you watch the next video what I would encourage you to do is actually just click around the ml5 website I probably would have made sense for me to do that's like I kind of overview that would make sense but really what I want to look at here just really quickly as these examples and there's a bunch of examples here and I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about all these different terms what's a classifier what's what's regression what's an LS TM what style transfer but the bunch of these used there are there's a bunch of pre train models already supported and this is where I'll start with in the video tutorials we're gonna look at pre chain models for image classification I'm gonna look at pre train models for generating text for a style transfer for something called pics two pics pose net pose and is amazing let me just I got distracted by the super chat because I don't know what I like so I see I see this like large number kind of freaked out Thank You Valerie but I threw some currency where it's a reasonable reasonable amount okay would love to hear your talks about genetic algorithm and reinforcement learning qlearning yeah I would love to hear that too I'll see if I can get to that eventually we come back and do this part over again so all right so you know I would encourage you actually before you watch the next video if you're continuing to watch these videos to just check out the end map go to ml5 jazz org I don't encourage you to click on there's lots of stuff to read about here but I encourage you to click on examples and go down and just try all of these so you can see there's some pretrained models that I'm going to use them to do a tutorial basically about each one of these notably like I mentioned one called pose net which actually can take an image and estimate your pose meaning where your hands where your shoulders where your eyes you know where your hips I might be getting that somewhat wrong there but that's a pre trade model just like a pre trade model learns how to recognize the content of an image here's a pre train model that looks how do I figure out where the human body is in a particular image so we're be looking at those I encourage you to just sort of click around here I also want to just quickly go to this Twitter thread that I posted just to kind of give a little bit of a background and pretty good credit because ml5 jess is not a life here that I created it's a it's a project certainly that I have worked on but it came from many many other people so first I'll mention ITP NYU that's not the right Twitter handle for ITP NYU Boyd I really botched that isn't it well this is a little bit of an aside yeah it's ITV underscore NYU ITP NYU it correct with her Antal okay so first thing to mention is and I did talk about this that ml5 jazz is a layer on top of tensorflow gotcha so all of the heavy lifting behind this really comes from this library which was a prod many people are working on in contributing this library at Google and otherwise but the project was initiated by Nikhil and Daniel researchers at Google the development was funded by with the support of the Google Pig mixture group the Google big picture group and people plus AI research initiative which is led by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda Viegas and they've done a lot of wonderful projects about visualization and machine learning the style and approach of our library really comes from the processing foundation I mentioned the relationship I guess I meant to say like the reason why the five is here is because of the sort of symbiotic relationship with p5 we've made sure the ml 5 library you absolutely do not need to use p5 with it but it is fully compatible with p5 and the spirit of p5 I think in in its welcoming and inclusive a sensibility is a present in the ml 5 library and so thank you to p5 we've used the 5 there ok Cristobal Valenzuela Valenzuela who is also the creator of Runway I'm out which you should definitely check out started this project at ITP by creating a few examples with the deep largest library which is what tends to flow which is what became tensorflow DJ yes Yanina has done amazing work on porting style transfer meaning she and and pics to pix models into ml 5 this is what's really wonderful pikachu edgetoedge pikachu i yunying hopefully will either be making her own videos that will point you to all have her and as a guest to go over some of these amana davis has done a lot of work around data collection and responsible data collection that i encourage you to read about and find on the ml5 website through an artist residency Nikita wait a second tonight I might live did I just have like so many mistakes in this I don't know why did I say Huggins her name is Nikita Higgins at ITP right ITP residents sorry I'm like losing my mind I didn't rest I had so many mistakes in my eye hold on just give me a second here I'm just looking at my email here well how do I know it's Huggins it's hungins I'm right I'm totally right I just look losing my mind it's late on a Friday I never get you know okay great Nikita Huggins a resident research at ITP really did a ton of work a project management work vital important work in shepherding the library through many different stages the ml5 logo on the website is designed by Alejandro Hey hey Eun Kwang also gave lots of support to that Dan Ovid actually ported the PostNet model to tension flow digested ml5 Jess I'll be showing this in some video tutorials in the future and the a J's ITP adjacent journal which I did mention also thank you to Stephanie Colton who did all the editing for that article and I encourage you if you really want to read more about the background instead of listening to me ramble you can check that out we had a lot of guest artists who came to visit us and give us a lots of inspiration and ideas throughout the process and then so many organizations allowed us to do some of the first experimental workshops school for poetic computation Eyebeam creative coding fest ITP camp and yeah and there have been many other contributors that you can find if you go to ml v j s dot org and you click on code and browse the github repositories and see all the wonderful people have contributed so this has been my introduction to ml v the library itself and guess what you made it through this video congratulations because in all the rest of the videos I'm really just going to be coding and talking you through how to make certain examples how they work and what the piece is opposed samples are so thanks for watching this first video and I'll see you in the next one which the first thing I'm gonna do is just make a simple image classification example using the mobile net model see you there maybe alright alright alright I did my best I don't know about this did my best I did my best I look at my email now it's the worst day ever it's so distracting oh let me go back to the slack channel there's something showing through from your computer with the green paper on it oh yeah this never works not better I'm gonna see it okay all right so I'm gonna have what time is it 600 o'clock this could be worse I only started like an hour ago well hopefully I'm wrong the Train sound is being requested I have this sorry it's the Train all right let me think about this okay so I'm going to get this image of me how do I set the I definitely want SafeSearch on how do I set it there's a way for me to set it so that it's like all images that I can use I mean the Wikipedia one I think will be fine let me go here and then Oh interesting let's see what happens here mm let's see here sorry I'm looking for some images to use usually when I do image search I feel like there's a way to specify under tools tools there we go usage rights labeled for reuse we go there we go this one I'm looking for okay well where'd I saved the other one did I not save it no I didn't okay okay so one thing so let's just see here my suspicion here uhhuh so interesting enough this is a puffin and what it thinks it is is an oyster catcher and it has a kind of a little bit of sort of low confidence level this is a toucan and it's a toucan where the confidence of 99.99 percent so my question to you watching this and I'm going to repeat this in a second is why does it know this one and not this one and what I'm going to do it's our github code and a5 library under source maybe utils imagenet classes okay then I'm going to figure out what I need here so I have this I have this I have this what was I looking for here is mobile net and image net this is what I wanted okay no I feel like there used to be this webpage that I would go to when I was like researching image net I feel like it was very different than this yeah I don't know okay okay okay we're gonna have to chat here okay why is there often a redundancy with it as a single word in two separate words that's a good question Alka I mean the I'm just going to show this is these are the literal categories okay so the other thing I want to do is just do see if I can find find I'm getting text from home that somebody just sponsored because the lights are flashing welcome underscore underscore thank you underscore underscore you're like Prince this is what I'm looking for that did not work what am i doing save image as here let's try this wall clock I love that okay wonderful and I don't know let's see here all these look at this weirdo this will work snorkel there we go okay so this is exactly what I want to demonstrate okay okay hello welcome to the first code tutorial that I am ever making I did make this kind of like longwinded rambling introduction to what ml5 library is itself but in this video I'm actually going to make a code example that does image classification so this is going to be our hello world hello to machine learning first start one of the easiest things you can do with the ml5 library it and it involves this is very key a pre trained model so this isn't this is not this is not where everyone starts and tutorials about machine learning a lot of Stroh's about machine learning start with like I said in the previous video linear regression in the math and training this and and we're just going to use a pre trained model somebody else made a machine learning model that knows how to recognize the contents of images and ml5 they open sourced it and ml5 is providing us access to it within javascript to use for the p5 library so i'm gonna write the code for this and talk about how it works but let's first actually if you just even want to just play around with this model to start with you can do this right here on the ml5 home page so right here you can see this image of a macaw and guess what the mobile net model labeled this image as a macaw with a confidence oh this must be the best artists machine learning model ever it's like magic it just knows everything and in fact I can grab this toucan and I can drag it in here look at this it's a toucan with a confidence is so smart so smart I can't believe the mobile net model is amazing now let's get this puffin in here it's got to know how to puffin ISM look at this the mobile net model labeled this as an oyster catcher and it's confidence is kind of low huh so what's going on here why is it not saying puffin that's clearly a puppet well first of all guess what a pre trained model for image classification forget about accuracy has a fixed number of even things in the world that knows about and one of the things that's really important if you're working with something like a pre trained model is actually to know what's in that set now it's not the most easy thing to find but right here on the ml5 github there's actually this page of JavaScript code that shows all the things that the mobile net model happens to know about in fact there are 1,000 classes and you could see like this is crazy it knows about a beagle and a bloodhound and a black and a English Foxhound it's like trained to know obscure dog breeds but if I look for puffins it's nowhere to be found boy stur catcher however is in there and if I were to look like what does an oyster catcher look like it kind of makes sense that's the thing it knows about that's closest to puffins so if your project is all about puffins you're not out of luck and I will show you ways to train with your own trade data to retrain a pre trained model but right now we're at this starting point so birds aside that's sort of you know it happens to know a lot about birds it happens to know a lot about dogs but let's just say for the sake of argument I'm gonna now give it this coding train logo it thinks that's a wall clock and it has kind of a low confidence and that I don't know maybe because of what's here the sort of flat nature of it yeah I could give it an image of myself it thinks I'm a snorkel which strangely is probably quite accurate I'm kind of snorkel like in more weights than whatever maybe I'm just that's too weird but the point is it actually knows nothing about people and it knows nothing about a lot of things that exist in our world who made these decisions what's in the preacher why are these classes written this way and and what was it even trained with so first let's talk about supervised learning I'm gonna race the white board do my magic erase the white board thing that I like to do I said I was gonna write code I will buddy Kenny buddy estimate to me after editing how long do you think that first intro to the ml5 video actually is and did I go did I go to if I went like get lost in my leg I want to talk about the technical stuff know if I went in the right directions with that okay okay so let's talk about for a second supervised learning what is supervised learning so image classification what's happening with image classification so the stage that were we're going to do in our code we're really just going to do the prediction stage so the prediction stage we have this pre trained mobile net model the model expects some input and it expects that input to be an image so that's the input to the model then the model generates an output and that output is a list of labels you know cat dog puffins etc and confidence scores you know 98% well I guess the the do the scores all add up to 100% I think I should just 90 percent six percent two percent etc okay so this is the stage that we're doing but how did we even gather we get to the point where we could do this ourselves somebody else had to prepare this mobile net model for us and the preparation of it is with a strategy known as supervised learning so supervised learning involves a it involves a training data set so maybe there is a data set it's almost like you can think of it like a spreadsheet right it has image and label so maybe this is the file name like image one dot jpg and it's a puffin except puffins down and move on that image to JPEG it's a cat right there's this big database and how the data is formatted and cleaned and all that stuff there's lots took that goes into that but essentially there's a big database oh I wrote off the I totally wrote way off the frame again all right all right all right all right it's out of frame come back to them and I'm gonna go back to the supervised learning thing where's my I have these lines showing me where the top is apparently their way in the wrong place so where's the actual top out there oh that's crazy crazy talk okay can you see that line nobody got it about right so somebody had to do this with the process known as supervised learning and write this down they're supervised learning so supervised learning involves a data set and this is often referred to as a labeled data set meaning and you can think of it as a spreadsheet a table a table of images and labels essentially there's two columns here one columns is a lot of examples of inputs and the other column is a lot of examples on outputs so I might have you know cat dot jpg oh and not a cat and then I might have you know kitten dot jpg and that's also a cat and I'm you know I have puffin dot jpg and that's a puffin so the idea here is that there is this existing training data set this is a training data set okay the data set is used to train the mobile net model it just says over and over again here's this image here's its label here's this image this here's this label and the process of how that works involves you know looking at the error they tried that the model tries to make a guess is does it get it wrong says it knows the right answer it can change its settings to try to get the right answer the next time this is the process once that finishes there's usually the model is tested with some other images that weren't used in the training set and then it's a paper is written about it it's published or it might be something that a company sort of owns and keeps keeps closed down it doesn't provide access to MIT uses it in their own proprietary software mobile that is one that is public so the important question for us to ask is we're going to use this pretrained model and we're going to start trying to understand why it's giving us certain results and what is it good at what is it not good at is we need to know what was that training set in this case the training set is a database of images called imagenet so let's come back to the computer for a second we can go here to the image that looks to do that I guess that's fine no I don't want to do that sorry hold on I specifically made this smaller we can come back to the computer sorry oops we can look at the we can look at the image net website and look at this image net is a database of almost 15 million images and that seems pretty good right in a machine learning system for it to do a good job in the supervised learning process it means a lot of data if we just have 10 images it's not gonna be able to do very much there's some tricky things we can do late that I'll show you later with small data sets but in general we need a large a zip so that seems like a good thing but one thing you have to realize like what are the motivations of this data set where are the images coming from well most of you know the this data set was really put together for research into image classification and in order to do that it needs to use well images that are like in the public domain that it can give access to and frankly almost all of you know it's very likely that if you do a google search for any of these so any of the let me just do this really quickly so I go back to the labels let's look for King penguin okay so I'm gonna do a search for King penguin I'm gonna go to images I'm going to grab this image I'm gonna do save image as I'm gonna save it to the desktop as penguin I'm gonna go back to ml5 and then I'm going to go here and say look a hundred percent you know why it's a hundred percent I am almost sure that that image is in I mean I'm not sure about this but going look that's probably in image net so a lot of these sort of like things that come up in a first search result that are in the public domain for Wikipedia they're actually in that image so it's going to work really well with something like that versus the image of a puffin that's not in the database doesn't even know about it so maybe if we could find an image of a penguin that's not in the database image that database it probably would guess it as a penguin but we wouldn't necessarily see that much of a confidence maybe if we had a zoomed out picture with a lot more background noise something anything you could try that super interesting is to just download this image and like draw over it or change a couple pixels what happens to the image classification afterwards all these things you could try and better yet you can try them by writing your own code so I think it's time and on and on for drew long enough about what this model is last thing I mentioned is if you really want to dive deeply into the mobile net model there is a whole paper written about it there's a github repository I'll link to all that stuff I encourage you to research this stuff and to think about it to ask questions and to be critical what are the motivations behind it the creation of a model what data was used in that model and what where might you want to use it or not use it okay so all that aside let's actually write some code to use the model now so I'm actually not ready to do that so this is gonna be an edit point so let me go to the desktop make a directory climb go five videos I'm going to go into it what do I do bundle and then image classification did that work oh my god losing my mind no P five G B I know I put it in quotes I'm like losing my mind I forgot I used this P five manager thing okay actually hold on a sec so I'm just setting up my workflow stuff which I will talk about in a second image classification index this is all good I don't need a libraries folder now something I forgot about I just want to check real quick before I make this video let me let's do a quick little test here and then I'm gonna have to back up so 27 I don't recall so let me just make sure before I go into this stuff that click on get started yep I'm gonna grab this put it in here I'm going to take all these images I'm gonna grab these ridiculous images I'm gonna make a folder called images put them in there I just I can't remember whether it works yet with load image or if I I just want to test the code real quick before I do the tutorial I'm gonna say load image somebody by the way give me a heads up when it's like seven o'clock I should maybe do that animation coding challenge just have a little variety load image images what did I have puffins whoops puffin dot jpg and then I want to just say image image zero zero so let's just make sure this works that's a large image of a puffin okay that's what's guy okay and then let's just see I just want to before I do the tutorial I want to make sure I know what I'm doing mobile gnat model ready I think that's only to do and then model ready let me just see console dot log already apologies to you live stream viewers because I'm kind of ignoring you right now I realize but I want to make sure that this works this is not right let's look at the documentation probably well I did that right already mobile net oh oh it's just slow I forgot it actually takes quite it's got to download the lot mount model from the cloud I just wasn't patient enough and then I want to stay a classifier classify image I got results this is how I do it error results console.log results I'm going to do all this again in the tutorial and talk it through okay classifiers not defined because not global I don't really want to put it up here but I'm going to oh what just happened my connection is oh look the connection is being all screwy okay get results SE I got results got results last attempt everybody classified click classify is not a function okay classify a classifier predict I thought we'd change it to classify which is fine but I had this memory of changing it to classify that's fine though yes if that didn't work pixels cannot be null this is fine I'm gonna do it the other way I just I really want I want it to work with this is the thing we need to fix yeah so I had a suspicion that this wasn't going to work I will do this just want to make sure this works create image yeah okay so it worked so this is sorry for me experimenting with this so what I'm what I was doing here is that p5 allows you to load images in two different ways there's the load image function which will actually load just the data if it image there's I thought do I have to say like but or there's the create image function makes an image Dom element so but it apparently it's only work with the Dom element thing okay so I'm ready to go I forgot what I was doing when I can I get rid of this file so annoying okay okay all right so we're ready now to start writing some code so what I'm starting with is very little I have a file called it's a text file called sketch j/s and it has some JavaScript code in it it's assuming the p5 library and I have already in fact oh shoot gotta start this over again sorry okay we're ready to write the code now I'm what I'm starting with is one javascript file with a little bit of code in it again I mentioned I'm using the p5 library the p5 library supports a setup function which executes when the web page loads create canvas makes a canvas and now I color the background with the color 0 which is black and if I go into the browser I am able to see the results of this code because I also happen to be running a local server using it a node server package now there are so many ways that you can run a web page that's running JavaScript and you could use code pen or open processing or something new that's gonna be coming out soon which is a p5 editor that you could use online that when it comes out all week do it in the video description but for right now I'm going to use my workflow of having my own text editor on my computer and the p5 libraries imported in the HTML file so here's the HTML file the only thing is it's doing right now is it's referencing the p5 library and something called the p5 Dom library which I need for some of the things I want to do and then also of course my own sketch jas I have a video where I kind of go through my entire workflow in more detailed steps I will also link to that in this video's description now that that's settled though I can actually start to use ml 5 so how do I use ml 5 so right here I'm on the ml 5 home page the first place I should go is just click on this big get started button so I'm gonna click on that and I totally clicked around to the wrong place let's try that again I'm gonna click on the get started button and I'm gonna go right down here and I look at this this is what I need now I can download the ml five javascript library file itself and included on my computer and I might want to do that if I'm gonna work offline but I prefer to just reference this particular URL in a script tag and this is at the time of this recording this is the current version of the ml five library zero point one point one now by the time you're watching this it might be like seven point eight point six if that's the case this video probably means absolutely nothing whatsoever but if it's relatively close to that version hopefully this video is still helpful to you all right now will not make my joke about your brain being inside of the gelatinous thawing machine thing in this video I made it so many times it's not even address even funny okay I'm so I'm gonna put that in here I'm just gonna go back to my web page and I'm gonna refresh it's still working okay good so now we have the ml five library imported and we can start calling ml five functions so one thing I might actually do is just go back to the ml five website whoops sorry we're just here and click on examples and I could go down to image classification and I could start kind of looking at this code and copy pasting some stuff I'm gonna kind of type it out and I have some of this in my head so I can just type it out but more importantly probably there's there are these examples which you can use to get started but you might also suggest like just having the webpage open to the reference page for a particular feature so again I want to have videos that go through all of these features but let's go through the image classifier one I'm gonna click on that okay so now this is the documentation there's a little bit of an example here and there's some information about the syntax and if I get confused I can refer back to that but since I know some of this having done this before I'm gonna just start writing directly into sketch j/s itself okay so the first thing that I need to do is I need to create an image classifier itself so I'm gonna make a variable and I'm gonna call it classifier and actually you don't I'm gonna call it mobile net because I want to remind myself that this is not magic that this is using a very specific pretrained model called mobile net so I'm gonna call my variable mobile net then I'm going to say mobile net equals and five dot image classifier so this is a function that generates an image classification object it's going to be stored in that variable mobile net and now it needs some arguments so what goes in there now the truth of the matter is there might be a variety of things you can put it there at the time of this recording there's really only one option which is the mobile net model so I'm telling ml five that I want to make a image classifier in the first argument I'm giving it as a string with the name of the model now in theory as much as an alive supports additional pretrained model I might get to type something in here like a unicorn classifier like maybe it classifies all different kinds of unicorns mobile net and then I need something else really important I need a callback deep breath deep breath deep breath deep breath okay so wait I got to stop for a second oh the ml five library supports callbacks which is what I'm going to use in these video tutorials and something called promises I have if you don't know what a jobs are get promises I will refer you to my playlist about JavaScript promises and you might look at some the documentation but if you're someone who already uses JavaScript promises is it another way of handling asynchronous events that's slightly different but very similar to callbacks that's something you can go and do on your own do on your own or I'll make some videos about that too but right now I'm going to use the callback methodology so in the idea here is I type in the name of a function I could also put an anonymous function in there called model ready and I'm gonna write I'm just gonna put that function up here in the global space because that's gonna be very simple and I'm just gonna say console dot log model is ready exclamation point so the idea here is I am now creating an image classifier with a mobile net model it's gonna take some time for it to load that model this is not a small thing now it's called mobile net because it's actually a tiny model that can even run on like mobile phones so this code would work well even in a mobile browser but even the tiniest model is something that's got some size to it it's gonna take a little while to load so let's go see how long go over here into here I'm gonna hit refresh model is ready so I know it was a few seconds you can see now one thing that sitter is like where did it load the model from does the ml5 library have a copy of it loaded that well actually no so one thing that's important here is a lot of the pre train models this is going to be different but a lot of the pre train models that you might make use of in ml5 are actually loaded from the cloud meaning some underground bunker servers were the model file is stored so and the this I believe it's coming from a Google server so if you're not connected to the Internet this example won't even run there probably you know at some point I'll be nice to support ways of running a mobile net model offline it is certainly technically possible but the ml5 library not all of the examples but this example in particular requires you to be online okay so the model is ready so now what can I do I can classify an image okay whoo this is fun for me alright so let's see I already have in this directory a bunch of those images that I was experimenting with so let's just use for example the puffin since that's our example we should see I shouldn't know that was going to happen let's let's start by using the puffin since that's one that we worked with earlier you know I personally I'd like to expect I like to use in my examples stuff that doesn't work because it's it leads you to ask questions and stuff just works it kind of feels like it can start to feel like magic and you can you know it's important to think about why stuff and how stuff is working okay so what I'm gonna do in setup I'm gonna make a variable called pufn pufn pufn and I'm gonna say puffin equals create IMG now this is a particular function in the p5 library right this is now like create canvas sp5 create images p5 this makes a Dom element an image element on the webpage that is that image so if I were to reload this page you're gonna see okay uh it's in the directory images so I need to include that there you're gonna see there it is down there now I can do things like if I wanted to have this all happen in my canvas I could say puffin dot hide and then I can actually say image puffin and this won't work but it'll be interesting to think why for a second and I want to draw the puffin into canvas the reason why it didn't work is once again things don't happen in JavaScript instantaneously so it's got it's gonna take some time to create that image I'm going to I could give that a call back it's called like image ready this is a lot of this stuff is unnecessary to the example I'm building but just to demonstrate the idea and then now I'm going to draw the image into the canvas ah but that image is really like a big size so I could resize it or I could just like force it to be the size of the canvas and there we go so I now have a p5 canvas displaying my puppet image and the model is ready so now once the model is ready what can I do I can classify the image I can try to ask mobile net what's in it and the way I do that is with a function called predict so you'll see different names for different functions in the ml5 library predict will come up often you might change to classify by the time you watch this video but I think it's called predict right now of ml5 I'm going to say mobile net dot predict puffin meaning I want mobile net to give me a prediction of what it thinks the content of the puffin image is and then guess what that takes some time it doesn't happen instantaneously so I need yet again another callback and I'm gonna give it a callback called got results and again I could do this with a promise if that's something that you're more comfortable with but I'm going to do with callback and then I'm gonna write this function called got results you've used p5 before this is very similar to like load JSON oh I want to load the date I want to load the data from this JSON file and then you usually have you know an argument to the callback which has the stuff in it the stuff that you want is filled that argument but here's something that ml5 works with error first callbacks this is a Java Script pattern where when you write the callback you always must include as the first argument and error argument an error variable meaning it's for the library is forcing you to check for errors so in this case I might want to say something like if error whoops not a new promise console and by the way I could say console dot log but I can actually say console dot error error and then otherwise console dot log the results so this is a little bit of extra error handling if something went wrong in the prediction process hopefully I would see that there otherwise I'm going to see the results all right let's see if this works and here we go boy stur catcher and we can see these probability is 75 that is crazy so this is really interesting to me this got 75% then it also thought it was albatross and Drake different probabilities now why a 45% 11% why why is this different than what I got with the oyster catcher in the homepage of ml5 2's I don't know the answer to that I don't have to think about that it's a different probability but nonetheless I'm getting a pretty similar result nice to do with like versions of something and that the homepage is running a different version of something but we can see this is the idea now what I could easily what I could do is I could go and I could say all right let me get the the label is results this by the way is an array with three objects in it so I could say I want to get the first object index zero and I want to get the class name right object zero dot class name that's the label and then I'm just gonna draw them and say fill zero text size 100 no social sixtyfour I don't know and then I'm gonna say text label and I'll say ten and like you know height minus fifty or something I don't know I'm just putting it arbitrarily somewhere on the page on the canvas so let's run this again we can see unloaded and then it says moister catcher right there how thrilling we have now run the motet model got the prediction for our image and there it is of course I could also do something like create a Dom element for the label I could also I could also get like the probability by saying equals results index zero dot and what was it called class name probability is the net other probability and I don't know if I spelled that right and I could create two Dom elements using Create P and we could run this one more time and now we're gonna see that stuff down here it's very very small probability is not defined probability probability Oh prob uh I named my variable prob because I got a lot of probs okay so we can see here there's the probability so you know this is the basics now you see you could actually just go and use this in right now one thing I have a couple ideas for you number one is make a little interface try several images can you make one where you can actually drag and drop your own image like it does on ml5 homepage could you make something where you draw on the canvas and it's trying to classify what you're drawing another thing you could try is can you get it to classify what the webcam is is seeing and guess what that's what I'm gonna do in the next video so there's so many more things you could do with this but this is the basic idea try your own version of this experiment play around try a lot of different images but in the next video I am going to basically take this exact example but hook it up to the live webcam feed and we can see it sort of classify images from the webcam in real time all right I'm gonna and so if I'm doing this as a live stream right now if you're watching this recorder that's recorded but I'm gonna check to see any questions and I'll answer those also to beginning the next video okay see you soon okay so sorry mine this is what happens after a live stream for like two hours my nose starts to get itchy I can't explain it it's like a nervous tic I got one more piece of melon so I think what I want to do is I'm going to do the video thing and then I want to try to do my coding challenge which is the animated sprite thing and then I think I'll be done for today how do you feel about that is that okay why okay I haven't really been following the chat does anybody have any important questions my colors are out of range for that syntax you need to use promises I don't know looking for any questions la conciencia asks when do you upload this video so it sort of depends but the live stream archive will be available as soon as this finishes at the same URL that you're at right now but the edited version of the videos will come out sometime next week probably is your hair brown well I always say my hair is gray but if we used to be Brown yeah important question is it two hours cold coffee that would be the answer that would be yes alright alright Rustom is asking can you use JavaScript inheritance today I've act I don't know if I took get requests final bit on Twitter or in a comment earlier today I don't I don't think I have time to look at JavaScript inheritance today but that is something I would like to cover at some point in the future image ratio is different interesting will I use 3jf in a future video I mean in theory anything is possible I can dream alright okay so thanks for these questions it's almost 700 see the super chats did I miss some super chats let me click here no that's for sending one top chat no I don't know how to see the super chats if I missed any important super chat questions I would be happy to answer them and of course I have heard of mr. doob okay I just want to check something real quick okay I've been on for two hours the stream status is good it's just interesting that I I'm just I'm noticing that I have this whole interface for like analytics while the stream is running and it's kind of curious that I can just check it sometimes by the average this is a good time the average view duration of the live stream is 12 minutes and 42 seconds so if you've been here the whole time thank you you're a your I appreciate it okay all right so let me go back to the chat I don't know we're getting some messages here I missed a lot of stuff in the slack channel chat so if there's anything super important goodnight to those of you who are going to sleep because it's like really late at night for you I've got another hour before I really have to go I mean I'd love to go but I'm gonna try to get through what I said is gonna get to it through okay so let's take a moment to do some stretching I'm doing some stretching over here I put on my weight at this waiting music for a second okay all right everybody what's that ready to him this weekend anything fun do you call it the pickle or the floss this is a constant discussion in my household is it the pickle or the floss which I clearly cannot do all right hello I am back to do another video about image classification with ml5 and in this video I'm going to take that's a puppet by the way not an oyster catcher I talked a lot about why it says oyster catcher not puffin but anyway I am now going to do a good classification but instead of seeing our good friend the puffin we're going to see I don't know if it's our good friend or not probably just me whatever is in the webcam of this computer Thank You barbone de Luci appreciate it hello back I'm here to do another video using the ml 5 javascript library a library beginnerfriendly library about machine learning I'm gonna use again the same pretrained model called mobile debt that I talked about way too much about in the previous video but instead of attempting to classify this image as a puffin which the model failed to it thinks it's an oyster catcher which is not an unreasonable guess I am going to attempt to classify images coming straight in in real time from the web camera so this would actually not take us very long frankly cuz I've mostly written all the code for it so pause I realize I've gotta be smarter about this and I want to now make another copy of it call it video classification because I'm going to change the code but I'm gonna want to have it I'm gonna go back and refresh and then go to video classification says that and I'm going to close this and this okay so the first thing I'm gonna do is instead of create image right here in setup I am going to say create capture video then I'm also going to add the draw function because right now unlike with the image we're just loading one image and then I was just drawing it once I need to have a loop that happens over and over again because what I want to see is the image of the video over and over again now again I don't have to draw the video into canvas I could just have the video element appear on the page itself but I like using the canvas just for sort of like it's kind of lead you to the water when the water is the place where you can draw your own stuff and be creative in the canvas so I like that I don't know if that made any sense but I this is what happens after two hours I I just I lose all ability to have any let me just start this whole thing over one more time for no real reason no reason other than my own neuroses I apologize to those of you who are watching this in realtime this must be super annoying I don't even remember where I left off okay so the first thing I want to change in the code it to turn it into video is I want to go and look at where I created the image so I said Puffin equals create image I had just this static image now what I want to do is I want to use the p5 function called create capture and instead of pointing to I can't spell today instead if I've can't spell every day instead of pointing to an image file the argument that I give the create capture function is just the constant video video means I want to create a video capture it's gonna default to the default camera it's connected to the computer so just to be sure about this I'm going to comment out puffin dot hide I'm gonna change this I'm gonna get rid of this which has to do with drawing the image I'm going to get rid of the predict comment that out and I'm gonna change this variable to video so the only thing that I should see right now is I should see the video appearing on the page so let's run this first it's asking me permission it wants to use my camera I'm gonna say allow and then there it is there's be okay so there it is now here's the thing I could just use the video element there and it's fine but I have this like thing that I'm obsess over and I feel as important what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hide the video it's this is on is there's nothing to do with the machinelearning image classification aspect but I feel like you might have a chance to express yourself to be more creative instead of just using the default Dom element if you actually draw the video to the canvas itself this might allow you to do things like draw on top of it and another type of stuff so there we go now I have the video in the actual canvas and I'm hiding the the video Dom element now all I need to do is go where did I do this I want to uh uh where did I call predict I called predict as soon as the model was ready well you know what guess what I'm gonna do that again and I'm gonna put video in here and I'm gonna get rid of this create peace stuff because I don't want to mess with that right now but the got results function can remain the same so as soon as the models ready it's going to get the results and it's gonna draw what it thinks the label is right there in the array okay there's a video oh so okay we got an error this is so good that we got this air because the errors you get when you use like ml5 they're really scary error math back and WebGL right pixels pixels cannot be no I mean that sort of makes sense to us okay so one of the things that I didn't mention in my introduction to ml five is I don't have that diagram anymore but ml five being built on top of tensorflow tjs tensorflow Jas he's doing all of the math using something called WebGL which is a 3d renderer for the browser and there's an interesting story as to why all those pieces fit together in this way which I could talk about another time but this is why you see these error messages quite often that have to do with like math back and WebGL so let's see what did I what did I get wrong mobile net dot predict video got results that video video equals create capture video hide I you know what guess what I don't actually I completely forgot something important that I wanted to show you how I kind of want to fix this because this really should work I'm thinking here I'm just pause verse I got why did this not work interesting hold on I have a weird sort of I just humor me for a second hmm make sure that hiding it isn't the problem I wonder if this is an ml5 bug this is not actually the way to do it I forgot the way to do it and I'm gonna change the way I'm doing it but I'm just gonna nope yeah I don't this should work but I'm not going to worry about that right now I guess I could just ignore the fact that I trying to think if I need to go back in the video because this error I mean I like that I got that error but the problem is now I can't fix it I'm gonna have to oh wait hold on I'm getting some messages in ml5 slack that's something else yeah okay now this is this is unrelated unrelated I'll look at that later thought maybe somebody was messaging me in a different place go back to here I don't want to let let yeah where's the stack trace T okay all right you know what I'm gonna back up before before I got that error right I was a little it was right about I'm gonna back up much yeah so I don't know why that didn't work but I'm gonna do it a different way which I think well let me just make sure it works the different way I'm gonna do it yeah so the way this this way worked so I don't know why that didn't work it should have but I'm gonna choose that's not the way the example is written and I'm gonna choose to do it the way the examples written I'll have to revisit that if somebody wants to explore that a little bit and file an issue on the ml 5 library github repo that would be helpful ok so sorry about this mention this might be hard to edit but I need to figure out now when to call the predict function and so in theory I should just call the predict function right here with the video but here's one of the nice things about ml 5 since ml 5 knows about things like hey you might want to do this with that continuously running video I can actually when I create the image class I'm gonna pop its I'm gonna take that this out of here sorry I'm gonna take video out of the dot predict function and actually the way to do this is when I create this image classifier I can actually say I want the mobile net model to act continuously on the video so I want to like hook those things up together so I can actually insert the video the P 5 video element right there into the into the image classifier function and then I can just call predict without any particular I mean I could always say predict on this specific image but now the video is just linked to that image classifier and I could just call predict so now if I run this oh shoot how do i how do I make this so now if I run this I'm gonna refresh it there go think we should see there I am I am a poncho or a cardigan are I'm often considered chainmail once again we're seeing the failings of the image the the mobile net model in this particular case now the thing is it just did it once right it just called predict the moment the model is ready but guess what what if how do I call it continuously well you know what once it calls predict and it got the results why not just ask it to do it again so if there was a mistake maybe I want to not move on but if it works I'm gonna get rid of the create P stuff here and get rid of the probability just for right now I can just do this so what I'm doing here is this is like a work this is essentially like a loop another loop that's happening when the model is ready that's when I can start predicting then once I've got the results I've got the results draw them and then show me the next one oh but guess what that's weird it didn't actually show up so this is actually a big problem so I'm gonna run this again we're gonna well hopefully this will work it's going to it so weirdly this is working I don't like that this is working let's see this is something that generally tends to get correctly kneepad really water bottle okay so but I this this worked by accident the fact that I'm seeing the text there I probably shouldn't draw in multiple places what would make more sense for me to do is make a global variable called label and then just oh and then have this and have that set initially to an empty string and then this drawing of the label should actually be right here in draw itself so let's try this again let's make it a little smaller and let's try one more time and here we go let's see what types of things that can classify and you know what I should this is you know so I'd have to more thoughtful about the design here so let's do this let's make the canvas a little bit taller and of course I could just write it into an HTML element but just for simplicity let's see here let's see if this does the trick I just drew you know that's a little bit better he meant to I should make the canvas a bit taller I don't know why I was so stingy there okay so what I'm trying to do is just draw a little area there we go okay so now and and honestly I probably should take out this console dot log these console dot log scan really slow things down and I'm gonna do this again last time here we go all right poncho Oh like let's see spatula it's pretty good spatula okay doesn't recognize a bell magnetic compass what about a train whistle a matchstick that's pretty good does it recognize a book broccoli what about a marker paintbrush I could be here I want to do this all day long this video is gonna be like 17 hours long pill bottle kneepad water tower I think the green background is kind of it likely confusing it what else do I got in this room oh let's see a cornea and piano accordion so you can see as long as it's something that's in there right if it's been trained on that particular you know if I just happen to have a chihuahua with me I probably could get it to recognize that Chihuahua so this is a fun thing that you can now play with you could make your own project about you know you know there's a Google made a project like this called ASCAP emoji scavenger hunt where you had to like find certain things get the image classifier to recognize it so there's all sorts of course it used some custom training there to make that work for particular objects but so I think there's a lot of possibilities of things you could explore here but now you can really have your hands in there play with the code visualize things draw stuff you know and really experiment with what is the mobile net model what works well what doesn't work well and you know the net one of the things that I really want to show you how to do which I will do in a future video in this series is use the mobile net model only as a starting point so the mobile net model is a starting point but I can then to tree train it with some custom images and some new labels so by golly I could get that mobile net model to recognize puffins if I wanted it to so thanks for tuning in it's not a thing you say do you tune into videos I don't know it's a live stream if you're watching this now thanks for watching okay and stay tuned I'm just gonna keep going through and show you more features of the ml 5 library what should I do next I don't know I think I might do I'm not sure yet watching the description will say next video what's the error because I used the puffin okay let me just check so I'm gonna saying something interesting which I'm curious about I'm going to take this out of here then I'm gonna put it back here this should do exactly the same thing it's just the shorthand to put the video in the constructor no I don't know why that doesn't work so this is supposed to work from I should work with the video you can manually pass in the element or you can give it you know if there's a video element you can give it to the instructor so I don't know why that didn't work all right I got time for this coding challenge all right I saw it okay so this I think concludes my introduction to the ml 5 library I I don't know I don't know hopefully it was it give me your feedback I mean it was anybody watching this tote like the the intended audience knows a little bit of JavaScript maybe use p5 never did a machine learning before do you feel like you're on your way to something maybe speaking of which can you cover convolutional nets yes so that's actually what I was gonna do next in my tensor flow GS series so let me think about this for a second I'm just you well look I'm live now so if I go I don't know where this is gonna live so this is the these are like the these are sort of like the non ml 5 machine learning playlist that I have and Afonso writes I thought it people are complicated Wow yes that's a good that's a good bit of feedback there these are these are the more complicated ones so it doesn't make sense for this playlist to be in here I think this playlist is just going to be actually I think it's gonna just be a new playlist and it'll be called exactly this ml 5ks a beginner's guide to machine learning in the browser great ok all right so now let's do a coding challenge let's go into the weekend let's go get our evening herbal tea or beer or kale wheatgrass smoothie whatever helps us to just feel like we're at home more relaxed it's time for the weekend we're gonna get there I'm gonna get there but I'm gonna do a coding challenge first you're gonna have to give me a few minutes to get myself reoriented for that so hold on I just got a sever a second so kayo asked can you do some machine learning tutorial for beginners that are having the first contact with it and brach back asked the question so that was the point of today I done I can't say that I did it successfully but right now there will be three edited video tutorials that come out of this which are intended for people who's with the first contact with machine learning now so that you can start with Bracke Bracke asks another question which is where should I start learning about machine learning on the coding train channel until those videos come up this is a bit hard to find whoops I need a better way of organizing all this this is the perennial thing but right now if I go to youtube.com slash the coding train scroll down and go to this one here neural networks and machine learning click here and now I would say you could you could start with you can technically skip session 1 & 2 if you want and just start with session 3 which is basically an intro to the idea of machine learning and you can see with me a bunch of different algorithms and more of the math behind it so and then I'm talking an intro to neural networks then I make a doodle classifier then I look at tensorflow J yes I make a color classifier and then there's this neuro evolution thing which links back to Gen I got so this is what there's a lot of material here so this is where you would want to start ml 5 is in parallel to this without a lot of the lower level details so yeah ok alright so now let me the coding coding challenge here I need to open up terminal again animated sprite okay tonight is that right I don't know what I I know why forgot its G B okay and I made it sprite now I can go here I can close the ml5 stuff I can delete the libraries here and I can let's go back to 640 480 and okay all right so I think I'm ready for the coding challenge all right oh wait wait wait where is the I got to do something here downloads I got to get the animation that I'm going to use which is this and actually I'm pretty sure I just need to fix something here and nowhere I'll explain everything a minute just getting myself organized JSON format or just want to make sure this JSON is right yep okay so I think I'm in good shape here that's the horse animation and great alright so this is the last thing I'm gonna do today it's uh it's I'm gonna do a coding challenge to make a variablespeed animated sprite that duplicates itself something like that and this is an example that I made I guess I will I don't know why I'm talking about this now but this was from 2011 this is like this is a processing example all right the weekend is coming I see it in front of me okay I'm ready that was bound to happen eventually okay got a cycle the cameras what's the chance let me see I should probably erase the whiteboard because I might want to use it so apologies you know it's really sad sometimes I feel like for the livestreams I should just play whatever music I want and just let the YouTube copyright overlords just monetize the videos because I just want to play interesting fun music maybe I can eventually make a lot more had some time could compose some more original coding train music or get more submissions from people I mean I I wouldn't play the videos in the park deep music in the parts that we're becoming the edited videos don't mind me I'm just here everything a whiteboard and you're watching whoo it's hot it's getting warm I wonder if it's still raining let's open the door just for a second I don't think it's like I can't even my watch it's 730 on a Friday evening I wish I could like make the camera like a roaming camera and then I could like go out into the hallway I'm just looking to see if it's raining still doesn't it looks like maybe the rain stopped all right hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to make an animated sprite this is actually a page on my website I have a website yes thank you very much with an example that I made apparently seven years ago you can download the code for this it's made in processing and it is loading a sequence of images and playing those images in sequence in multiple places at different speeds to create this running person thing across the screen so I'm going to try to do something similar I'm gonna do it at p5 so I'm gonna look at what does it mean to load a sprite sheet what is a sprite sheet even to chop up that sprite sheet into lots of little images and then to play those images as a sequence and make an animated sprite class that you can use and this is a very common technique used in games and all sorts of other stuff so let's get started down thank you hold on a sec oh wait thank you thank you dragon z p who suggested that i use this wonderful image sequence of a running horse which comes from open game art org this is under a Creative Commons license so I need to attribute it it which I'm doing right now hello I'm using this but I can so you can find a lot of free and open art that you can use here so I'm gonna use this if you if I were to click here and just download the assets we would see that it would actually come as separate images which I find to be very nice because I like to load them one at a time but what's actually often done and more efficient is to actually and I have this right here to load a single image so this is what's known as a sprite sheet a sprite sheet is a single image that has each frame of an animation for that sprite why is it called a sprite in the first place pause I'm looking for a sprite in animation sprite computer graphics why is it called the sprite Spray our key games oh I cannot find it the term sprite huh ah here we go look at this look at this in the category of you learned something new every day the term sprite was first used in the graphic sense by one of the definers of the Texas Instruments 99 18 a video display processor I'll let you continue to read this interesting Wikipedia page about the history of sprites but the way that we think of sprites today and in particular a sprite sheet today is multiple frames of an animation within a single image and this here is a PNG image so it has transparency so if I were to go I should just go to the desktop and open this up you can see it right here here it is again so what is it that I want to do what I want to do is load this image I want to get each frame out of it and then I want to show them one at a time in sequence so this is not necessary but again thank you to dragon who submitted this also sent me a JSON file so this is actually quite convenient this is a JSON file that actually has the information about where each frame of the sprite is in that image it has its XY knits width and height now it turns out this is really just a grid so I could probably just do this mathematically very easy easily but this is sort of nice that I can maybe load this in so let's get started with this right now so first thing I want to do is I am going to write a preload function I'm using again the p5 library and preload allows me to load media assets before the program begins sort of save me from callbacks and promises and that sort of stuff which is useful but I don't need that right now so I'm gonna say let sprite sheet be the variable for the image and let sprite data be the variable for the data so I'm gonna say sprite data equals load JSON and what was that called it's called a horse JSON and I've done something horrible here and then I'm gonna say sprite sheet equals load image horse dot PNG just to make sure everything's working let's draw the sprite sheet to the canvas and in setup lets console dot log the sprite data so this is the first step I and again this is a bit of over this is this is a lot of extra stuff like you know I could just load a bunch of images alright only sou me the JSON file but this is nice I like it I like it ok so let's go back whoops and of course everything's gone wrong so it couldn't get horse JSON and it couldn't get horse to PNG why because it's in a folder I always forget this I put it in a folder called horse so I need to add the directory path to the images there we go so we can see this came in so I definitely have the data there right I have the position and the native of each element and then why don't I see ah so I'm trying to draw the image and I completely forgot if I'm going to draw the image I've got to say where to draw the image and I'm gonna draw it at 00 there we go Oh timeout for a second I'm getting text messages ok this is important I have to hold on hold on everybody just give pologize bear with me this is this is a something something I need to just deal with when it's uh okay okay hopefully I'm gonna be able to finish up here soon okay okay all right read the comments Dan read the comments what comments all right all right okay all right I don't know what's going on in the chat but there we go okay okay so next step what I want to do now is I don't want to just display the entire sprite sheet I want to display each piece of it one at a time so let me go and what I'm going to do is I'm going to create a variable and I'm gonna say let animation equal an array so the array is going to be each frame an image for each frame of the animation so assuming I have that data I can see if I look at the JSON file right once again all of the all of the data is in a JSON array called frames so I'm going to say sorry back into the code I'm gonna say let frames equal sprite data dot frames I don't that's totally necessary for let I equals 0 I is less than frames dot length I plus plus and then I'm gonna get sorry I'm gonna look at the JSON again and now for each one I want to know about the position this X Y width and height is what's important to me I'm having trouble so I want to say let pause equal frames index I position and then now pause has all of the stuff in it for grabbing a particular image so watch but I'm gonna say let image equal sprite sheet and I'm gonna use a function called get so get is a function in the p5 library that allows you to get part of an image I could get a single pixel I could get the whole image I could get a section of it and in this case what I want is this section of the image the X and y with a particular width and height then what I want to do is just put that into that array so now this is really all I want to do is loop through every frame grab it out of the spreadsheet now again a convention might be this is one way of doing it which I which arguably might not be the quoteunquote best or most efficient way you can actually just leave everything in a sprite sheet and later I could just be like when it's time to draw stuff I could pull stuff out but I'm choosing to in setup just pull out the sections of the image and I'm gonna console.log that array now and we can see I have an array with seven images in it so now if I were to say draw image animation index zero that's all I see is that one if I were to say draw animation index two I see that one so this is working and guess what animation frame count what and then can't read a property width of undefined so you saw it for a second there and then it went away why did it go away well it went away because there's only seven images there so I could say modulus the animation dot length now somebody who I got this great YouTube comment the other day saying that I'm saying modulus and modulo incorrectly I don't remember what it was time out for a second where was that I'm gonna find that comment where was that comment hold on I got to find that comment comments sorry it wasn't that long ago so I'm just scrolling through I'm gonna find it this is obviously incredibly high priority oh come on how I'm gonna find it it's not that long ago I just saw it earlier today I guess I could search there's a thing where you could search let me do this search I'm so silly search comments much search there it is okay this was on recommence sequence part 2 ok let's find this comment oops okay I found in the comment the operator is called modulo and the number following it is called the modulus okay and goal on Levin came on the Kody training to the guest video about that operation but what this operation does for me in the code right now the modulo operation is it gives me a modulus value that's always between 0 and the end of the array so it's the remainder of division so this frame count modulo animation dot length watch what this does now I see that animation repeating and look at that look at it it's the horse it's just running and running and running and running and running great so I've completed part one when I'm gonna kiss keep going this is one video of this coding challenge I've got the animation playing it out but here's the thing what I want to do now is I need to figure out some way of encapsulating the idea of this animation into an object so I could then make many of them so what I'm gonna do to do that and I think what I want to do I think I want to make a new JavaScript file I'm gonna call it sprite j/s and I am going to in index of HTML I need to make sure that I refer to it and then in sprite j/s I'm gonna make a class called sprite and then when I create this what what when I create the sprite with a constructor I want to give it a few things I wanted to have a speed and I wanted to have it I'm gonna give it like an animation so basically that animation will be the sequence of images that's supposed to play and then it's also going to have a speed which is like how fast does it play it through so the idea here being that now I can say let me just do a variable called horse and I'm gonna say horse equals a new sprite with these frames of animation and a speed of 1 and here I'm gonna say horse show and maybe I just want to say something like horse dot animate so like our next frame or something I don't know what what makes the most sense but I'll just call it animate right now and I'll put it after so this means if the idea of this sprite if I want to show it and animate it in the sprite class I need a show function and I need an animate function now if I'm gonna have a show function that's basically going to be exactly this but the point here is that I want to get away from using frame count and so what I want is to have another variable that just keeps track of the index like where am I in the animation so I can use that instead of frame count this dot index and this by the way has to be this dot animation dot length and this has to be this dot animation I like and you know it would be really nice to have a length variable I think cuz I'm gonna probably need that a lot so let's just make it that just like makes the code a little bit nicer to look at alright so this should work and then in animation I just say this dot index plus plus or plus equal this speed so the idea here is speed is controlling the speed of the animation so I've basically taken the idea I've created an object that has stored in it an array of images that's the animation it has the length of that array it has speed how fast roads cycle through them and where is it currently so now if we run this and I've got some error here sprite digest line ten this dot animation this dot index so let's just let's just look at some stuff here to see what's going on Oh animation is one oh I put things in the wrong order ah this is a very common programming error look at this I wasn't doing this quickly and in here say horse equals new sprite animation comma one so add the image sequences first then speed number is second and in here I put the speed first and the animation second so I got to reverse those order so that they match and then there we go we're fine now so I've got to where I was before but the interesting thing here is that now guess what this sprite can have an X and it can have a Y and so it could be basically I could be drawing it at this dot X this not Y so then when I create it I could say I wanted at one hundred 100 comma 1 now it's there this leads me to be able to say okay now I want to have horses I want to have a bunch of horses I'm going to say for let I equals 0 I is less than 5 I plus plus horses index I is a new sprite at 0 comma I times 50 and then I want to say for I'm going to use a for of loop let horse of horses and I'm going to go through all those and show and animate all of them so now look at this I've got a whole bunch there they're all right there together maybe I want to just space them out a little more I could be thoughtful about the math of this oops I must not have saved there we go so this is good enough for right now I've got a whole I've got a bunch of them but look it now here's the thing what if I don't want them all to be matched up at the exact same speed what if I were to say let's make the speeds random so let's make the speeds random somewhere between 0.1 and one point I think that's actually the fastest speed that that number one so let's do that what happens all right I immediately get an error what is the error that I get it cannot read property with Ubuntu fine spray Tijs line 12 well the issue here is by definition if I go to sprite KS line 12 look at this this dot index modulus this dot length this works just fine if the index is zero one two three four five if it's a whole number if it's a whole number it can apply the modulo so I said it wrong again operation and it gets another hole number which is an index into an array arrays only have whole number indices but if I start saying plus 0.2 or point three I'm gonna get these numbers that aren't valid indices into an array well this is actually quite fixable and let's just do this let index equal floor so all I need to do is floor this dot index before I apply modulo and then I can put that in here right so floor is an operation that just eliminates the decimal point I want the index itself to go up slowly by a decimal point but I only want to show you know I have fewer frames I want to show the same frame a bunch of times so it's if it's point two it's gonna take five frames for it to get all the way up to the next whole number if it's point one it's going to take ten frames so this should do the trick now and we can see look at this they're all going at different speeds and they're running in place I might as well have them move now right so why not also have them move this dot X plus equal this dot speed and maybe the speed that they're running doesn't really feel right so even though it's the speed of going through the index I probably should increase that my scale of like five let's try that this looks a bit more realistic now I have it looks like they're sort of moving at speed and then I could obviously do something like if this dot X is greater than with then I want to say is this dot x equals negative I want to kind of put them off the screen negative this dot animation index 0 dot with so I'm just pulling I know that might make sense for me to make that a variable like this dot W equal this dot animation index 0 you know this is assuming all the images have the same width and that way I could just say put it off screen here so let's run this one more time and guess what I now have I believe a recreation of that example that I made where I have a bunch of horses all moving at different speeds through the animation and you know now the world is my digitally simulated virtual reality Easter so to speak and then I could I could grab any sequence of images I could have different sprites have different image sequences I could start designing the background I could have them you know I could apply physics to the way that the the X Y position moves around the screen I could start having collisions the point is that anything that you've anything that I've made in all my nature of code or other coding challenges that have an object moving around the screen the simple games this would allow me to have an animated sprite and I might even further want to encapsulate the idea of a sprite oh this would be a great place for me to talk about inheritance so I could then make other objects that extend that's an inheritance term sprite so I could make horses that are animated sprites or frogs they're animated sprites or puffins and puppet doesn't really do it so I could that's okay I'm a little bit off the of the rails here in my discussion let's think about this what could you do know what thing is what would happen if I gave it a negative speed I think mine would break so this is a little challenge to you could you make this work with negative speeds right it breaks so this example that I made doesn't support going through the animation backwards so try to add that could you make something like this that has different animations for each op so there's maybe five things but they're differ and each one has its own animation sequence could you do that so could you design your own sprite sheet so don't even do any code make your own sprite sheet and run it with this code exactly so there's so many things you could do please share with me I've been the comments on Twitter or at the link to the coding challenge URL in this video's description there's a way you can submit any versions that you make on your own thanks for watching this coding challenge animated sprite what did I owe ya slower add a rotation to it and incrementing by any integer will be too fast all right I think I think I'm good I think I'm done sorry I have to go home so I so but I will see did I miss anything super important there or was this challenge good enough for right now thank you everybody for tuning in I'm good everybody says I'm fine great so one thing I need to do is before I leave I've got a upload the code I'm gonna hit to stop recording I'm not gonna stop streaming just because I want this to go to disk all right is it possible to use ml5 with no task moto that's a good question it's definitely possible use tensorflow yes with node and I don't know about MF I don't know that I don't believe we're supporting that yet but that's a really good question okay so next week I don't know my schedule for next week Friday evenings have been working late in the afternoon I've been working pretty well for me so I might expect that to be the time next week I would love to squeeze one more to live streams in next week it might only be one would love to squeeze in two so because I'm actually going away again for a few weeks so I'm gone for about three weeks of August so August well things will really slow down I have been doing an accounting of my live streams to make sure it like again with the with the crowdfunding stuff my commitment is to four live streams a month and some months I end up doing more in some months less like I said look over it over the period of a year but I this is my second live stream of July I'll certainly get one more in next week's which will be three in August I might only have to but I pretty sure that I've done a lot more in jus in in May and June and I can also catch up and walk in September so anytime anybody feels like I'm not to be enough you know let me know again the complaints office for is down the street in lower Manhattan near the courthouse apparently and yeah so thanks for I don't I don't have anything else to say I would love to hear your feedback on ml5 wanting to hear from things that you make I am going to go only night but I did get a new sponsor and you know this is the undressed tiger thank you so much for the sponsorship la I appreciate it so sponsors you need to look in the community tab and they're our sponsor only posts there that have a link to a Google Form so enter your information in that Google form I will mail you stickers and you will also get an invitation to the slack channel and I am doing another mailing hopefully of stickers oh why it's just an email about that hopefully next week although if you sponsor today I don't know if I'm gonna get you into that mailing because I've already sort of put together but anyway I don't know what's happy with that but you'll get an invitation to slack channel and you'll be able to ask there so I thank you Andreas for sponsoring it's very much appreciated I am looking for a volunteer to design spa emojis for the SATs for the sponsors to use that's like a YouTube feature and icons for that like right now it's like the circle with these two lines I guess it's supposed to be like an S but anybody wants to volunteer to help design more emojis and icons just let me know in the slack channel or on Twitter at Schiffman you just send them to me I will upload them into the system alright so that's that thank you everybody for watching it is so appreciative I'm excited to be going once again on another machine learning journey with the ml5 library doing more coding challenges Oh little foreshadow I this is my this is the coding challenge I'm working on this is one I actually have to prepare for I've been like obsessed with this idea of like visualizing for D and then 5d and 6d there's a wonderful video Lee s.o.s this is not gonna be right that I watched the other day no let's do tesseract yeah this video understanding 4d the tesseract by lay I Oh SOS this is a great video I highly recommend this is a nice one too I watched both of these but I'm but I need to figure out I think I'm gonna do this in processing in P 3d and I want to do actual like the rotation the matrix math for rotations and so I think I need to make a couple video tutorials about that I need to kind of like figure that out a little bit so that's coming soon to a YouTube channel near you coding challenge 4d rotation hypercube tesseract would then be challenged to the viewer to do a 5d one alright thanks everybody and I will see you next next week at least once maybe twice subscribe and click the alarm bell if you want a notification it will show up when I scheduled on YouTube I usually do try to do that 24 hours in advance but it'll be one day next week okay goodbye I'm gonna hit the stop streaming button which is over here and then I'm gonna go home and begin the weekend please enjoy your warm cold caffeinated alcoholic non CAF decaffeinated non alcoholic beverage of choice relax take some deep breaths look outside at a view read a book get away from code for a little while and come back to it when you're feeling refreshed I need like a catchphrase I'm supposed to have a catchphrase this is my catchphrase where do i click stop the livestream oh here it is I'm now clicking the stop streaming button goodbye
