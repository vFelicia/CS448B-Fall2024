00:00 - hello in this video where should I stand
00:03 - what do you think in this video I'm
00:05 - going to look at how to work on your p5
00:08 - GS sketch or really any HTML Javascript
00:11 - CSS combo thingamabob outside of in any
00:16 - old text editor by running a local
00:19 - server on your laptop now what does that
00:21 - mean actually I'm going to use the
00:22 - whiteboard for a second so let's just
00:24 - think about the internet as the web and
00:26 - all that stuff for a second so you are
00:28 - making a web page and you have a laptop
00:32 - and to make your web page you're maybe
00:34 - editing an HTML file maybe you have a
00:37 - CSS file maybe you have a JavaScript
00:38 - file and you're editing all these files
00:40 - they're just plain text files and you're
00:43 - editing them in some text editor so the
00:46 - text editor I'm going to use happens to
00:48 - be one called sublime but you can use
00:50 - any text editor list of text editors I
00:54 - would say now if I could think of them
00:56 - but you put some in the comments and you
00:59 - can write some in the comments your
01:00 - favorite put your favorite text editor
01:01 - in the contents so what I'm going to use
01:03 - sublime text so you're editing these
01:05 - files now one of the things I'm going to
01:07 - show you is that you know another thing
01:09 - that you're going to run on your laptop
01:11 - is a thing called a browser and your
01:15 - browser actually has the ability just to
01:17 - open those files so you could ask your
01:19 - browser open the HTML file and you're
01:21 - going to see that the result of that
01:23 - file in the browser are going to fix the
01:25 - mic here mad magic edit so if you open
01:30 - those files from the browser you're
01:32 - going to see the result of those files
01:33 - in the browser now let's think of what's
01:35 - your ultimate goal here the ultimately
01:38 - the idea that probably is that you have
01:40 - a server server and you have your server
01:45 - hosting some website you know
01:47 - website.com
01:48 - and ultimately what you're going to do
01:50 - is you're going to take your files and
01:52 - put them on a server so that other
01:54 - people on their laptops and computers or
01:57 - phones or whatever it is can connect and
01:59 - look at your files so by opening the
02:03 - file by opening the HTML file from the
02:06 - browser you aren't actually doing what
02:09 - the web server itself will do which will
02:11 - ultimately
02:12 - serve up the files so that other people
02:13 - can request them so a better and in fact
02:16 - a lot of things won't work if you just
02:18 - open those files so yeah okay I used to
02:23 - keep going that get start over and erase
02:26 - all this so so ultimately what you want
02:31 - to do is run by the way like the you
02:33 - know the YouTube makes these charts you
02:35 - could look at these charts where you see
02:37 - people drop off and stop watching your
02:39 - video and just about everybody stops
02:40 - with a few of you are remaining but I
02:43 - keep going with this so what you
02:45 - ultimately want to do is run something
02:47 - which I'll call a local server so if you
02:50 - run a local web server on this machine
02:52 - you are more accurately simulating what
02:54 - will happen when you eventually upload
02:56 - your files to a server and everything
02:59 - will look and work and function
03:00 - correctly
03:01 - so this is what I want to show you in
03:02 - this video how do you edit your files
03:06 - with the text editor run a local server
03:08 - so that you can see the result in the
03:10 - file of those files in your browser and
03:12 - accurately simulate the environment that
03:14 - will eventually exist when you publish
03:16 - your stuff to the world and become the
03:20 - person who publishes their son for the
03:21 - world there we go okay so let's go back
03:23 - to the computer now and take a look at
03:25 - this so this is actually the p5 desktop
03:27 - editor which you may or may not have
03:29 - used actually does all this for you it's
03:32 - a text editor you hit this Run button
03:34 - and it spawns a local server it opens a
03:37 - little browser which shows your page but
03:39 - what I'm going to do actually is I'm
03:40 - going to just quit out of it and I'm
03:44 - going to show you that if I go to my
03:46 - computer's desktop I don't know if you
03:49 - can't really see this and I go here I
03:51 - was actually I made I there's a folder
03:53 - called test sketch and in this folder
03:56 - are the files associated with my sketch
04:00 - there's an HTML file a JavaScript file
04:03 - and a folder called libraries that
04:04 - libraries folder is where the p5.js
04:06 - library itself exists so what I want to
04:09 - do is now I have something I have a text
04:12 - editor called sublime text you can
04:13 - google it you can find it you can use
04:14 - any text editor you want and what I want
04:16 - to do is look at those files in sublime
04:19 - text one way I can do that is actually
04:21 - just take this and drag it in and now
04:23 - you can see here that
04:25 - that I have now have I'm now browsing
04:27 - and looking at those files and if I
04:29 - wanted to edit my code I could look at
04:31 - it right here and now I can edit the
04:32 - code I can actually make the font a
04:34 - little bit bigger and you can see here
04:37 - I'm editing my code now let me make the
04:40 - next point if I just go back here and
04:43 - click on this HTML file I have no idea
04:45 - what's going to happen it's going to
04:46 - open it in some default browser it might
04:47 - be Safari it might be Chrome if I open
04:50 - it it opened it in chrome and you can
04:51 - see it's working it's actually running
04:53 - but look what's happening up here it's
04:56 - opening it from the file path file users
05:00 - processing desktops test sketch so while
05:03 - this works there are a lot of things
05:06 - that won't work when you're opening it
05:09 - just from the file path itself that only
05:12 - work if you're using a local server
05:14 - running a local server certain things
05:16 - like loading an image file into your
05:18 - sketch for example won't work so while
05:20 - this is okay as a solution a quick and
05:23 - dirty test I personally would recommend
05:25 - never doing it this way instead you want
05:27 - to run a local server so there happens
05:29 - to be this wiki on github under the
05:33 - p5.js wiki which has a bunch of
05:36 - different instructions of different ways
05:37 - you can run a local server on different
05:40 - operating systems Windows Linux Mac
05:42 - Apache but about the thing that I'm
05:44 - going to use which I think is the
05:45 - simplest is you I'm since I'm on a Mac
05:49 - and a Mac's come with Python installed I
05:52 - can just run a Python local server from
05:54 - any directory I want so what I'm going
05:57 - to do the way I'm going to do this is by
05:59 - running terminal so if you don't know
06:01 - where terminal is it's in the you know
06:03 - applications utilities there's an
06:05 - application called terminal when you run
06:07 - it it looks something like this this is
06:09 - giving you console command line access
06:12 - to your computer and I can type various
06:14 - things like if I type PWD that stands
06:16 - for a print working directory and you
06:19 - can see I'm in user slash processing and
06:22 - if I just type CD that means change
06:24 - directory and if I type desktop I want
06:26 - to change to the desktop and now if I
06:28 - type P PWD I can see I've been users
06:33 - processing desktop other things I can do
06:34 - is I can hit the up arrow the up arrow
06:36 - goes to my most recent command
06:38 - see it again and now if I'm on the
06:41 - desktop I can run a local server from
06:43 - here and I can say Python - em simple
06:47 - HTTP server so this just happens to be a
06:49 - command that I have memorized but I'm
06:52 - saying I want to run a Python program
06:54 - that's built into the Macintosh it's
06:56 - called simple HTTP server I forget what
06:58 - the - M stands for somebody will tell me
07:00 - in the comments I hit enter and you can
07:03 - see uh serving HTTP on 0 0 0 port 8000
07:08 - what this means is my this computer is
07:10 - now running a web server where is the
07:13 - web server running it's running on
07:14 - localhost and another way of saying
07:16 - local host is 0.0.0.0
07:18 - so that's the IP address the Internet
07:21 - Protocol address the address the numeric
07:23 - address of a computer on the internet
07:25 - and those numbers can become rather
07:26 - important but for us right now we can
07:28 - just think of it as localhost port 8000
07:31 - being the port that other people can
07:32 - connect to who are the other people
07:34 - there me so I am the other person and
07:37 - what I want to do now is go up here
07:39 - right and instead of accessing my sketch
07:42 - from file what I want to do is say HTTP
07:48 - localhost now you can see I've done this
07:50 - before on this computer so it's already
07:52 - like pre filling it in but I want to go
07:54 - to localhost colon port 8000 localhost
07:57 - colon port 8000 I hit enter now you
08:01 - don't actually see my sketch because
08:03 - actually I would I now see is a view of
08:05 - everything on the desktop so you can see
08:08 - I have a bunch of other things like I
08:09 - was doing this photo booth p5 demo which
08:15 - has this snap button which allows me to
08:18 - take so this is something I'm going to
08:19 - make a tutorial about in a minute
08:20 - another video to watch your video a few
08:22 - videos from now you'll find this one but
08:24 - you can see I'm sort of browsing this is
08:26 - the minimum miss spanning tree example
08:28 - so I have a bunch of folders with
08:30 - sketches I'm sort of serving up that
08:32 - hold on my whole desktop which I can
08:34 - choose to do or not to do but what I'm
08:36 - looking for is test sketch this is the
08:38 - one and they can make it bigger in
08:40 - chrome by shift command plus so now I
08:43 - see the sketch running and I could go
08:47 - back to the code and I could say hey let
08:48 - me change the background to 100
08:50 - hit save tab over to Chrome hit refresh
08:53 - and you can see now I have the new
08:54 - sketch running so this is another way of
08:57 - working outside of some all-in-one
09:00 - editor environment text editor local
09:03 - server browser but missing piece let's
09:07 - say in draw the draw loop I want to
09:11 - debug the value of X so I'm going to say
09:15 - console dot log X now I could have said
09:18 - print line X print line is a p5 specific
09:21 - function that prints something to the
09:23 - console console dot log is the sort of
09:25 - native JavaScript version of that
09:27 - function basically the same thing but if
09:30 - I put that in there and I go back and
09:32 - hit refresh where is it I don't see it
09:35 - no log no console so in Chrome I can use
09:39 - something called the chrome developer
09:41 - tools are you excited you shouldn't be
09:45 - how maybe you are maybe you should be I
09:46 - don't know so where do you get those
09:48 - view up here under view developer
09:52 - developer tools but I want to go
09:54 - straight to the JavaScript console the
09:56 - developer tools are this massive thing
09:59 - and as all sorts of inspect this look at
10:01 - that HTML CSS style this magic this all
10:04 - I really care about is the JavaScript
10:06 - console right now I want to see things
10:08 - that are console dot log so I'm going to
10:11 - select JavaScript console and it's going
10:14 - to appear now it won't necessarily look
10:16 - like this on your computer you're
10:18 - probably going to see it at the bottom
10:20 - you're probably going to see it a lot
10:21 - smaller but what I've done you know you
10:25 - can you can there's various ways you can
10:27 - like move it around and change the font
10:29 - size you know I want it to be kind of
10:31 - rather big so I can for a tutorial you
10:35 - can see it so what's nice here is you
10:38 - can see there's the result and it's
10:39 - showing me these each one of these
10:41 - things is printing from sketch J's line
10:43 - number eight so if I go over here and
10:45 - see line number eight console dot log X
10:48 - so that's great now you can also comment
10:50 - this out and refresh the sketch one of
10:53 - the wonderful things about the Chrome
10:54 - JavaScript console is that it is
10:57 - interactive what do I mean by that I can
11:00 - actually type in the value X
11:02 - the variable X which is a variable in my
11:04 - program hit enter and it's going to show
11:06 - me the current value of X so I can kind
11:08 - of live debug as the program's running I
11:11 - can do other things like I could say x
11:13 - equals 50 it's getting to the other side
11:16 - of the screen hit enter it you can see
11:17 - that I actually changed on the fly the
11:19 - value of that variable and it moved I
11:21 - can do other things like what if I said
11:23 - no loop no loop is a function in p5 that
11:26 - turns off draw and suddenly it stops
11:30 - looping I can say loop I can do things
11:35 - like just call other functions like if I
11:37 - say create P hello
11:39 - create P is a p5 function that creates a
11:42 - paragraph Dom element and there you go
11:45 - hello is right there it's also showing
11:47 - me what's in that Dom element and
11:49 - there's so there's a lot more to this
11:50 - and all as I make other tutorials that
11:52 - use the chrome developer console you'll
11:55 - see more and more about it so this has
11:57 - been about 10 minutes hopefully this
11:59 - helped you make sense of the world it's
12:03 - a very hard world to make sense of these
12:05 - days and this probably doesn't help make
12:07 - sense of the world but it makes sense of
12:09 - a small part of the world the local
12:11 - server on your laptop of the chrome
12:13 - developer tools I'm sure you have
12:15 - questions and I will answer them somehow
12:20 - in a way I don't know how yet but in in
12:23 - the comments of this video or in another
12:25 - video and I look forward to seeing you
12:28 - in the next video maybe maybe maybe not
12:31 - ok thanks very much I'm gonna hit stop

Cleaned transcript:

hello in this video where should I stand what do you think in this video I'm going to look at how to work on your p5 GS sketch or really any HTML Javascript CSS combo thingamabob outside of in any old text editor by running a local server on your laptop now what does that mean actually I'm going to use the whiteboard for a second so let's just think about the internet as the web and all that stuff for a second so you are making a web page and you have a laptop and to make your web page you're maybe editing an HTML file maybe you have a CSS file maybe you have a JavaScript file and you're editing all these files they're just plain text files and you're editing them in some text editor so the text editor I'm going to use happens to be one called sublime but you can use any text editor list of text editors I would say now if I could think of them but you put some in the comments and you can write some in the comments your favorite put your favorite text editor in the contents so what I'm going to use sublime text so you're editing these files now one of the things I'm going to show you is that you know another thing that you're going to run on your laptop is a thing called a browser and your browser actually has the ability just to open those files so you could ask your browser open the HTML file and you're going to see that the result of that file in the browser are going to fix the mic here mad magic edit so if you open those files from the browser you're going to see the result of those files in the browser now let's think of what's your ultimate goal here the ultimately the idea that probably is that you have a server server and you have your server hosting some website you know website.com and ultimately what you're going to do is you're going to take your files and put them on a server so that other people on their laptops and computers or phones or whatever it is can connect and look at your files so by opening the file by opening the HTML file from the browser you aren't actually doing what the web server itself will do which will ultimately serve up the files so that other people can request them so a better and in fact a lot of things won't work if you just open those files so yeah okay I used to keep going that get start over and erase all this so so ultimately what you want to do is run by the way like the you know the YouTube makes these charts you could look at these charts where you see people drop off and stop watching your video and just about everybody stops with a few of you are remaining but I keep going with this so what you ultimately want to do is run something which I'll call a local server so if you run a local web server on this machine you are more accurately simulating what will happen when you eventually upload your files to a server and everything will look and work and function correctly so this is what I want to show you in this video how do you edit your files with the text editor run a local server so that you can see the result in the file of those files in your browser and accurately simulate the environment that will eventually exist when you publish your stuff to the world and become the person who publishes their son for the world there we go okay so let's go back to the computer now and take a look at this so this is actually the p5 desktop editor which you may or may not have used actually does all this for you it's a text editor you hit this Run button and it spawns a local server it opens a little browser which shows your page but what I'm going to do actually is I'm going to just quit out of it and I'm going to show you that if I go to my computer's desktop I don't know if you can't really see this and I go here I was actually I made I there's a folder called test sketch and in this folder are the files associated with my sketch there's an HTML file a JavaScript file and a folder called libraries that libraries folder is where the p5.js library itself exists so what I want to do is now I have something I have a text editor called sublime text you can google it you can find it you can use any text editor you want and what I want to do is look at those files in sublime text one way I can do that is actually just take this and drag it in and now you can see here that that I have now have I'm now browsing and looking at those files and if I wanted to edit my code I could look at it right here and now I can edit the code I can actually make the font a little bit bigger and you can see here I'm editing my code now let me make the next point if I just go back here and click on this HTML file I have no idea what's going to happen it's going to open it in some default browser it might be Safari it might be Chrome if I open it it opened it in chrome and you can see it's working it's actually running but look what's happening up here it's opening it from the file path file users processing desktops test sketch so while this works there are a lot of things that won't work when you're opening it just from the file path itself that only work if you're using a local server running a local server certain things like loading an image file into your sketch for example won't work so while this is okay as a solution a quick and dirty test I personally would recommend never doing it this way instead you want to run a local server so there happens to be this wiki on github under the p5.js wiki which has a bunch of different instructions of different ways you can run a local server on different operating systems Windows

PWD I can see I've been users processing desktop other things I can do is I can hit the up arrow the up arrow goes to my most recent command see it again and now if I'm on the desktop I can run a local server from here and I can say Python em simple HTTP server so this just happens to be a command that I have memorized but I'm saying I want to run a Python program that's built into the Macintosh it's called simple HTTP server I forget what the M stands for somebody will tell me in the comments I hit enter and you can see uh serving HTTP on 0 0 0 port 8000 what this means is my this

editor environment text editor local server browser but missing piece let's say in draw the draw loop I want to debug the value of X so I'm going to say console dot log X now I could have said print line X print line is a p5 specific function that prints something to the console console dot log is the sort of native JavaScript version of that function basically the same thing but if I put that in there and I go back and hit refresh where is it I don't see it no log no console so in Chrome I can use something called the chrome developer tools are you excited you shouldn't be how maybe you are maybe you should be I don't know so where do you get those view up here under view developer developer tools but I want to go straight to the JavaScript console the developer tools are this massive thing and as all sorts of inspect this look at that HTML CSS style this magic this all I really care about is the JavaScript console right now I want to see things that are console dot log so I'm going to select JavaScript console and it's going to appear now it won't necessarily look like this on your computer you're probably going to see it at the bottom you're probably going to see it a lot
