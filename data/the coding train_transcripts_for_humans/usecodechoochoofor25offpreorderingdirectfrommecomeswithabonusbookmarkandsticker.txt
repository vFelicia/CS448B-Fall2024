00:02 - book called the nature of code the
00:05 - question I started with in my mind is
00:07 - what are the things that exist in the
00:09 - natural world that are beautiful
00:12 - surprising complex and how can those
00:15 - things be simulated with code this book
00:18 - is for someone who just learned to code
00:20 - especially if you just learned creative
00:22 - coding with processing or p5js and you
00:25 - want to explore a little bit further
00:27 - maybe you've been intimidated by
00:29 - different algorithms that you see you
00:30 - want to dabble in concepts of machine
00:32 - learning but I would just love to see
00:34 - what you're making with the book um in
00:36 - particular the coding Train website has
00:39 - a whole set of video tutorials that go
00:41 - along with the topics in the book and
00:43 - each one of those tutorials on its page
00:46 - has something called the passenger
00:47 - showcase where you can submit your own
00:49 - creative variations of the examples in
00:51 - the nature of code share them with me
00:53 - and share them with other visitors to
00:54 - the website as well
