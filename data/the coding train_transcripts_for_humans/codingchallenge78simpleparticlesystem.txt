00:00 - hello welcome to another coding
00:02 - challenge in this coding challenge I'm
00:03 - gonna try to very in a very simple way
00:05 - in a quick way
00:06 - program a simple particle system that
00:09 - resembles something like smoke so I'm
00:12 - gonna do this probably in a way that has
00:14 - very little visual interesting quality
00:16 - to it whatsoever and it's my hope much
00:18 - like with my recent entrant and
00:19 - recursion coding challenges that I see a
00:22 - wide variety of clever beautiful remixes
00:25 - of this simple idea and what kind of
00:27 - beautiful particle system ideas can you
00:29 - make out of what I make so let me just
00:31 - start by making it so what I'm gonna do
00:33 - the idea of the particle system by the
00:35 - way is creating something out of many
00:38 - particle things that's like the worst
00:42 - ever definition of a particle system but
00:45 - incidentally the term particle system
00:47 - was coined for originally for the movie
00:51 - the Wrath of Khan
00:52 - the effect the Genesis effect there's a
00:55 - effect where like this thing gets shot
00:57 - at a planet that doesn't have anything
00:58 - on it and kind of planet kind of catches
01:00 - fire and then all of a sudden it's all
01:01 - green and life is there and so anyway I
01:03 - think it's William T Reeves there's a
01:05 - paper I'll link to all that the history
01:08 - of particle systems in this video's
01:09 - description but let but the idea is I
01:12 - want to make and I'm gonna do this as a
01:14 - class so I just recently started using
01:17 - es6 and I made a bunch of tutorials
01:19 - about classes and objects and I'm going
01:20 - to use that technique in this video so
01:24 - I'm gonna make a class anytime I make a
01:25 - class I need to make a constructor and
01:28 - this particle now I could use if you
01:30 - look at my nature of code videos I use
01:32 - this thing called a P vector that's in
01:34 - processing in p5 there's something
01:36 - called a p5 vector but I'm gonna stay
01:38 - simple here and I'm just gonna make this
01:40 - X just an X a separate X which will be
01:45 - 300 and this dot Y which will be 3 380
01:50 - so the reason why I'm doing this is I
01:53 - want my particles to in this idea like
01:55 - you know I could do anything but I want
01:57 - them all to start at the bottom and kind
01:59 - of come up word and fade out which will
02:01 - hopefully give me a somewhat smoke or
02:03 - fire like effect it probably will not
02:05 - look like that at all but that you're
02:07 - gonna you're gonna modify it and make
02:08 - something much better ok so I want a
02:11 - function called show
02:13 - for each object and in in show I'm just
02:15 - gonna you know like loading images and
02:17 - using textures to draw the particles
02:18 - would be a nice technique to create more
02:21 - interesting visual effects but I'm just
02:22 - going to draw them as circles this dot X
02:25 - this dot Y and I'm going to give this
02:27 - I'm gonna have it be a diameter of 16
02:30 - and I don't if the width and height are
02:31 - eco I can just use one I'm gonna say
02:32 - fill and I'm gonna give it some alpha
02:35 - and I'm gonna I'm gonna say stroke 255
02:38 - just so I can see it really well now and
02:40 - so the Alpha will be like 10 so now
02:43 - let's just try making a single particle
02:46 - I'll just call it P P equals new
02:49 - particle and P dot show so let's run
02:56 - this there we go there's that particle
02:59 - now I does it is a little bigger so
03:00 - there's this is it I have one particle
03:02 - there it is at the bottom good so now
03:06 - what I want to do is obviously I'm gonna
03:07 - need many of them so I'm gonna change
03:08 - this to be an array and what I'm
03:11 - actually going to do is I'm gonna say in
03:14 - draw let P is equal a new particle and
03:18 - then I'm gonna say particles dot push P
03:22 - so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna use
03:24 - the push function which adds an object
03:26 - to the array and let me put this in
03:28 - setup now just for the sake of argument
03:30 - so I'm going to put one particle in the
03:32 - array so that now if I write a for loop
03:35 - that's in you know Q they're complaining
03:39 - about not a for each loop where I
03:42 - iterate over the array using a counter
03:44 - variable like eye and say particles
03:46 - index where how do I get up there
03:48 - particles index I dot show now I kind of
03:52 - have the same program this should be the
03:54 - same I should see just that one particle
03:56 - I created it and set up I added to the
03:59 - array and I'm showing it same exact
04:02 - program but now let's make that particle
04:04 - move so let's write a function called
04:07 - update let's give this particle
04:11 - variables like VX and V Y and I'm gonna
04:15 - give it an initial random like I'm gonna
04:17 - give its random V X for velocity so I
04:20 - need a speed or way that it changes
04:22 - along the x-axis and a y-axis so using
04:24 - p5 vector could be help
04:25 - here and if anyone wants to do a port of
04:27 - this with p5 vector you're welcome to
04:30 - and then I'm going to give it a random
04:31 - velocity going upward so what would that
04:34 - be upward is negative so something like
04:36 - between like negative 5 and negative 1
04:40 - so an update I'm now going to say this
04:43 - dot X plus equals this dot DX this dot y
04:46 - plus equals this dot dy so the idea here
04:49 - is that I'm going to change the location
04:53 - by some random amount and so I can now
04:55 - for all those particles I can say update
05:01 - you can think there goes it goes up so I
05:04 - actually now I'm realizing a couple
05:06 - things here but what I want to do right
05:07 - is instead of just having one particle
05:10 - I mean how Lin do I want to add
05:12 - particles do I want to start with a
05:13 - burst of them so I add a hundred and set
05:15 - up so I want to have them once every 5
05:16 - seconds so I add some sort of timer
05:18 - there's so many different ways but let's
05:20 - try for the sake of argument just adding
05:23 - one new particle every time through draw
05:26 - so I'm getting somewhere this is kind of
05:29 - you know perhaps somewhat like the idea
05:32 - smoke doesn't really look like smoke but
05:34 - I've got a particle system here so
05:36 - things that I would want to do and then
05:39 - way I could stop here and I could say
05:41 - hey you make this more creative and
05:42 - interesting but I'm missing some key
05:45 - features that I really need to have here
05:47 - so first of all one thing that I want to
05:49 - try doing is I want to give these
05:51 - particles a transparency so let's
05:54 - actually give them a variable called
05:55 - alpha and we'll start it at 255 and I'm
05:58 - gonna use this variable here in its fill
06:01 - this dot alpha and in update I'm gonna
06:06 - say this dot alpha - equal 1 or - - or
06:11 - something so each one will fade out I
06:13 - don't know
06:14 - - equal 5 let's have them fade out
06:16 - pretty fast so it's gonna lose some
06:19 - alpha with each frame so you can see
06:22 - there this is going to hopefully help me
06:23 - have something a bit more like smoke and
06:25 - thus trochus is there so I'm still
06:28 - seeing them all so what I want to do is
06:31 - let's actually take out the outline
06:33 - color
06:38 - we can see okay how did I do oh let's
06:42 - roast a marshmallow by the white
06:45 - circular fire delicious okay so actually
06:49 - in a way I'm kind of done but there's
06:51 - there's some more things I should really
06:53 - think about here number one is hmm after
06:56 - I run this for a while it's gonna start
06:59 - really being really really slow for
07:01 - example particles I could look in the
07:04 - console here particles dot length
07:05 - there's eight hundred thirty particles
07:07 - right now but I don't need eight hundred
07:10 - thirty particles right and if I look at
07:12 - it now there's a thousand fifty
07:14 - particles I'm adding new particles every
07:16 - frame but I'm never getting rid of them
07:18 - so I want to make sure that I remove
07:21 - particles so there's a different ways I
07:23 - could do this I think one way that I'm
07:25 - gonna try to do this is I'm going to
07:27 - remove the particles when their alpha
07:29 - becomes less than zero so one way to do
07:34 - that is with the splice function and so
07:39 - if I come back to this main loop I could
07:42 - say if so one thing I might add I'm
07:44 - gonna say if particles index I is to
07:48 - delete another kind of function that's
07:50 - kind of a weird name I want this
07:52 - function to delete to tell me true or
07:54 - false whether I should delete it it's
07:55 - like a question to delete delete'
07:57 - finished maybe I'll just call it like
07:59 - finished then I want to remove this
08:03 - particle so let's write that function
08:06 - first so I'm gonna call this function
08:08 - finished and basically I'm just gonna
08:12 - return this dot alpha less than zero so
08:17 - it's a little bit weird like I'm just
08:18 - writing return the results of this dot
08:21 - alpha less than 0 so this not alpha is
08:23 - less than when it's less than zero this
08:26 - will evaluate to true or it will
08:27 - evaluate to false so this function is
08:29 - either gonna return true or false and
08:31 - it's true when alpha when it's faded out
08:33 - I don't want to display it anymore
08:34 - so let's actually put that stroke back
08:37 - just so we can see it and then let me
08:42 - how do I remove a particle why I could
08:45 - actually say particles dot splice I
08:47 - comma one so I happen to know this
08:49 - already but this splice function is a
08:51 - that removes an element from the array
08:53 - at position I and just that one element
08:56 - so now look at this you can see them
09:00 - getting removed now something weird is
09:02 - happening you see this like weird like
09:03 - flickery like thing so there's a little
09:05 - bit of an issue I've I've covered this
09:07 - in so many different videos I'm not sure
09:10 - if I should cover it here just point to
09:11 - it but I'm gonna I think I will covered
09:13 - here really briefly huh so there's other
09:15 - ways around this and in many ways if I
09:17 - took out the stroke I wouldn't have this
09:19 - problem visually but what's happening
09:22 - here is if I have an array that has a
09:24 - bunch of spots in it and I call these
09:26 - like peep a particle a particle B
09:29 - particle C particle D particle E and
09:33 - these are in spots 0 1 2 3 4 well what
09:39 - happens is if I'm iterating over this if
09:42 - I'm saying check spot zero should I
09:45 - delete it nope
09:47 - check spot 1 should I delete it nope
09:50 - check spot - should I delete it let's
09:53 - say yes I should delete it so I delete
09:55 - this one and now I have the array looks
09:57 - like this it has instead of having 1 2 3
10:00 - 4 5 it has 1 2 3 4 things in it PA PB PD
10:06 - and PE 0 1 2 3 so the next one I should
10:14 - check is number 3 right which is the
10:16 - last one notice what happened I was here
10:18 - so these shifted over and then I went to
10:20 - the next one which actually I ended up
10:22 - skipping PD so so this could be a
10:26 - problem and a way that I could do this
10:27 - is just go backwards because I'm going
10:29 - backwards I check this when I check this
10:30 - one then I check this one if I remove it
10:32 - these shift over it doesn't matter I'm
10:33 - not affecting the beginning of the array
10:35 - and in some ways this is less of an of
10:38 - an important issue right here but it is
10:40 - this is the thing you need to be
10:42 - thinking about if you're using a counter
10:43 - and iterating over the right like if
10:45 - ideally we're on adding stuff to the
10:46 - array that's also really gonna be a
10:48 - problem cuz I'll never get to the end
10:49 - and I'll be stuck in an infinite loop so
10:51 - here's a way around that I'm gonna start
10:53 - at the end of the array particles length
10:55 - minus 1 then I'm going to say greater
10:59 - than I'm gonna go down to 0 and say I -
11:01 - - just gonna go in the array backwards
11:04 - now you can see was the stuff fades out
11:07 - it disappears there's no more weird
11:09 - flickering there's a little weird that
11:10 - they just disappear suddenly but this is
11:13 - mostly just because of the fact that
11:15 - they have this stroke on them
11:17 - now I'm only removing them when I can't
11:20 - see them so now if I look at particles
11:23 - dot length is only 51 particles and I
11:28 - run this for another few seconds while
11:29 - I'm talking and there's still only 51
11:31 - and there's still only 51 so the timing
11:33 - is working out such that there's only
11:34 - ever going to be 51 so how could I make
11:37 - this look more like smoke well one thing
11:40 - that might be important to play with is
11:41 - how many particles do I want to add each
11:45 - frame so this is now five particles per
11:51 - frame whoops and oh sorry this needs to
11:56 - be inside the loop so you can see here
12:00 - you know does this look more like smoke
12:02 - left like smoke but so that's one
12:04 - parameter here that's important to work
12:07 - on but here is really what I think is
12:09 - important number one is oh I didn't even
12:10 - add any acceleration so like adding some
12:14 - type of acceleration so I'm not gonna do
12:16 - this in this video but this is what you
12:18 - want to think about what's a different
12:20 - way that you could pick initial
12:21 - velocities should those velocities
12:23 - change over time what are you actually
12:25 - are using color what shape are you
12:27 - drawing do the size of those circles
12:29 - vary are you can you make it feel like
12:32 - something that's not smoke or fire but
12:34 - more like a confetti bursts or something
12:36 - fireworks I have another coding
12:37 - challenge where I do fireworks which is
12:39 - pretty similar to so there's a lot of
12:41 - possible things you could do and so I'm
12:43 - gonna end this here with this code and I
12:46 - won't look forward to a thousand
12:48 - particle flower systems blooming please
12:51 - share them with me hashtag on Twitter
12:55 - particle train particle trade particle
12:58 - train particle train no what's that song
13:01 - particle it's particle man it's the day
13:03 - might be done the particle train is good
13:05 - so hashtag particle train on Twitter I
13:08 - would love to see little gifts and
13:09 - animations of all your particle systems
13:11 - that you make share your code and I look
13:13 - forward to seeing you in my next coding
13:16 - challenge
13:22 - [Music]
13:29 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to another coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm gonna try to very in a very simple way in a quick way program a simple particle system that resembles something like smoke so I'm gonna do this probably in a way that has very little visual interesting quality to it whatsoever and it's my hope much like with my recent entrant and recursion coding challenges that I see a wide variety of clever beautiful remixes of this simple idea and what kind of beautiful particle system ideas can you make out of what I make so let me just start by making it so what I'm gonna do the idea of the particle system by the way is creating something out of many particle things that's like the worst ever definition of a particle system but incidentally the term particle system was coined for originally for the movie the Wrath of Khan the effect the Genesis effect there's a effect where like this thing gets shot at a planet that doesn't have anything on it and kind of planet kind of catches fire and then all of a sudden it's all green and life is there and so anyway I think it's William T Reeves there's a paper I'll link to all that the history of particle systems in this video's description but let but the idea is I want to make and I'm gonna do this as a class so I just recently started using es6 and I made a bunch of tutorials about classes and objects and I'm going to use that technique in this video so I'm gonna make a class anytime I make a class I need to make a constructor and this particle now I could use if you look at my nature of code videos I use this thing called a P vector that's in processing in p5 there's something called a p5 vector but I'm gonna stay simple here and I'm just gonna make this X just an X a separate X which will be 300 and this dot Y which will be 3 380 so the reason why I'm doing this is I want my particles to in this idea like you know I could do anything but I want them all to start at the bottom and kind of come up word and fade out which will hopefully give me a somewhat smoke or fire like effect it probably will not look like that at all but that you're gonna you're gonna modify it and make something much better ok so I want a function called show for each object and in in show I'm just gonna you know like loading images and using textures to draw the particles would be a nice technique to create more interesting visual effects but I'm just going to draw them as circles this dot X this dot Y and I'm going to give this I'm gonna have it be a diameter of 16 and I don't if the width and height are eco I can just use one I'm gonna say fill and I'm gonna give it some alpha and I'm gonna I'm gonna say stroke 255 just so I can see it really well now and so the Alpha will be like 10 so now let's just try making a single particle I'll just call it P P equals new particle and P dot show so let's run this there we go there's that particle now I does it is a little bigger so there's this is it I have one particle there it is at the bottom good so now what I want to do is obviously I'm gonna need many of them so I'm gonna change this to be an array and what I'm actually going to do is I'm gonna say in draw let P is equal a new particle and then I'm gonna say particles dot push P so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna use the push function which adds an object to the array and let me put this in setup now just for the sake of argument so I'm going to put one particle in the array so that now if I write a for loop that's in you know Q they're complaining about not a for each loop where I iterate over the array using a counter variable like eye and say particles index where how do I get up there particles index I dot show now I kind of have the same program this should be the same I should see just that one particle I created it and set up I added to the array and I'm showing it same exact program but now let's make that particle move so let's write a function called update let's give this particle variables like VX and V Y and I'm gonna give it an initial random like I'm gonna give its random V X for velocity so I need a speed or way that it changes along the xaxis and a yaxis so using p5 vector could be help here and if anyone wants to do a port of this with p5 vector you're welcome to and then I'm going to give it a random velocity going upward so what would that be upward is negative so something like between like negative 5 and negative 1 so an update I'm now going to say this dot X plus equals this dot DX this dot y plus equals this dot dy so the idea here is that I'm going to change the location by some random amount and so I can now for all those particles I can say update you can think there goes it goes up so I actually now I'm realizing a couple things here but what I want to do right is instead of just having one particle I mean how Lin do I want to add particles do I want to start with a burst of them so I add a hundred and set up so I want to have them once every 5 seconds so I add some sort of timer there's so many different ways but let's try for the sake of argument just adding one new particle every time through draw so I'm getting somewhere this is kind of you know perhaps somewhat like the idea smoke doesn't really look like smoke but I've got a particle system here so things that I would want to do and then way I could stop here and I could say hey you make this more creative and interesting but I'm missing some key features that I really need to have here so first of all one thing that I want to try doing is I want to give these particles a transparency so let's actually give them a variable called alpha and we'll start it at 255 and I'm gonna use this variable here in its fill this dot alpha and in update I'm gonna say this dot alpha equal 1 or or something so each one will fade out I don't know equal 5 let's have them fade out pretty fast so it's gonna lose some alpha with each frame so you can see there this is going to hopefully help me have something a bit more like smoke and thus trochus is there so I'm still seeing them all so what I want to do is let's actually take out the outline color we can see okay how did I do oh let's roast a marshmallow by the white circular fire delicious okay so actually in a way I'm kind of done but there's there's some more things I should really think about here number one is hmm after I run this for a while it's gonna start really being really really slow for example particles I could look in the console here particles dot length there's eight hundred thirty

another kind of function that's kind of a weird name I want this function to delete to tell me true or false whether I should delete it it's like a question to delete delete' finished maybe I'll just call it like finished then I want to remove this particle so let's write that function first so I'm gonna call this function finished and basically I'm just gonna return this dot alpha less than zero so it's a little bit weird like I'm just writing return the results of this dot alpha less than 0 so this not alpha is less than when it's less than zero this will evaluate to true or it will evaluate to false so this function is either gonna return true or false and it's true when alpha when it's faded out I don't want to display it anymore so let's actually put that stroke back just so we can see it and then let me how do I remove a particle why I could actually say particles dot splice I comma one so I happen to know this already but this splice function is a that removes an element from the array at position I and just that one element so now look at this you can see them getting removed now something weird is happening you see this like weird like flickery like thing so there's a little

ways around this and in many ways if I took out the stroke I wouldn't have this problem visually but what's happening here is if I have an array that has a bunch of spots in it and I call these like peep a particle a particle B particle C particle D particle E and these are in spots 0 1 2 3 4 well what happens is if I'm iterating over this if I'm saying check spot zero should I delete it nope check spot 1 should I delete it nope check spot should I delete it let's say yes I should delete it so I delete this one and now I have the array looks like this it has instead of having 1 2 3 4 5 it

thing you need to be thinking about if you're using a counter and iterating over the right like if ideally we're on adding stuff to the array that's also really gonna be a problem cuz I'll never get to the end and I'll be stuck in an infinite loop so here's a way around that I'm gonna start at the end of the array particles length minus 1 then I'm going to say greater than I'm gonna go down to 0 and say I just gonna go in the array backwards now you can see was the stuff fades out it disappears there's no more weird flickering there's a little weird that they just disappear suddenly but this is mostly just because of the fact that they have this stroke on them now I'm only removing them when I can't see them so now if I look at particles dot length is only 51 particles and I run this for another few seconds while I'm talking and there's still only 51 and there's still only 51 so the timing is working out such that there's only ever going to be 51 so how could I make this look more like smoke well one thing that might be important to play with is how many particles do I want to add each frame so this is now five particles per frame whoops and oh sorry this needs to be inside the loop so you can see here you know does this look more like smoke left like smoke but so that's one parameter here that's important to work on but here is really what I think is important number one is oh I didn't even add any acceleration so like adding some type of acceleration so I'm not gonna do this in this video but this is what you want to think about what's a different way that you could pick initial velocities should those velocities change over time what are you actually are using color what shape are you drawing do the size of those circles vary are you can you make it feel like something that's not smoke or fire but more like a confetti bursts or something fireworks I have another coding challenge where I do fireworks which is pretty similar to so there's a lot of possible things you could do and so I'm gonna end this here with this code and I won't look forward to a thousand particle flower systems blooming please share them with me hashtag on Twitter particle train particle trade particle train particle train no what's that song particle it's particle man it's the day might be done the particle train is good so hashtag particle train on Twitter I would love to see little gifts and animations of all your particle systems that you make share your code and I look forward to seeing you in my next coding challenge you
