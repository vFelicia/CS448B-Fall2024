00:00 - I'm very excited about this video I
00:02 - don't know if this is gonna be helpful
00:04 - or make any sense
00:05 - maybe you're watching it maybe you're
00:06 - not I mean you are watching it well
00:08 - here's what I'm gonna do this I'm gonna
00:10 - try to have a new series to put that's
00:11 - in a playlist don't know series about
00:13 - finding bugs and open source projects
00:15 - and contributing and helping to fix
00:17 - those bugs like how do we do that and
00:18 - this is going to be a heart this is a
00:20 - high degree of difficulty one so I'm not
00:22 - starting with something simple and this
00:24 - will probably fail but I'm gonna do my
00:25 - best so I just did a whole set of
00:28 - tutorials about WebGL and one of the
00:30 - thin p5 one of the things I noticed with
00:33 - help from the viewing audience is that
00:35 - if I put two point lights in the scene
00:37 - here's a point light that's red that's
00:39 - on the right side of the canvas here's a
00:42 - point light that's blue that's on the
00:44 - left side RGB X Y Z and then I have a
00:47 - sphere with ambient material that will
00:49 - reflect that light what do I actually
00:51 - see I only see a blue light on the left
00:54 - now this is using p5 version zero point
00:58 - five point one six so let's just let's
01:04 - just be sure about this so I'm going to
01:05 - take this point light and put it second
01:07 - now you can see only the red point light
01:10 - what I want to see and I'm going to show
01:12 - you this really quickly I'm gonna go to
01:13 - my index of HTML file and I'm gonna
01:15 - switch I'm gonna talk about how I'm
01:16 - doing this i'ma switch versions of the
01:18 - library this isn't working
01:20 - this isn't working with version zero
01:22 - point five point seven so somewhere in
01:24 - between zero point five point seven and
01:26 - zero point five point one six this
01:28 - feature broke this is I feel like I want
01:31 - some like cool Oh didn't didn't didn't
01:33 - paying pants the hurts themes fun music
01:35 - to play because we're gonna do some
01:36 - detective work now how can we find this
01:38 - so first of all how did I switch between
01:40 - the libraries so quickly so one thing
01:42 - you might notice about this particular
01:44 - bit of code you can ignore this kittens
01:46 - folder but I actually have the p5.js
01:49 - library here locally and that is the
01:53 - current though the current as of the
01:54 - time of recording this video version of
01:56 - the library and in this and you can see
01:59 - here in my HTML file I'm referencing
02:01 - that particular local p5.js file now
02:06 - it's now commented out I could commented
02:08 - back in what I decided to do it's really
02:10 - eat much easier is that I could use
02:12 - something called
02:12 - CDN which is stands for content delivery
02:15 - network and if I search for CDN p5.js
02:19 - what I'll get is this particular website
02:23 - C D and J Escom and it has hosted
02:27 - versions of the library that I can
02:29 - reference in from my HTML file and I can
02:31 - get the links for any old version now
02:34 - one of the ways I'm going to do this
02:36 - right now is I'm just gonna go here I'm
02:38 - gonna put 16 in here and I could just we
02:41 - could do this all day right I'm gonna go
02:43 - back sorry to the sketch hit refresh
02:45 - it's broken so I could say 0.15 still
02:52 - broke it point 1 4 still up it's working
02:55 - in 0.5 point one four so for some reason
02:58 - I went all the way back to zero point
02:59 - five point seven when I was doing my
03:01 - session but now I can see it actually
03:03 - works in 0.5 0.5 0.14
03:07 - so what does this mean time for me to go
03:09 - to github so the p5.js project is an
03:11 - open source project on github it's a
03:13 - complex open source project with many
03:16 - files and many developer tool like
03:18 - workflow like crazy things or some
03:20 - documentation that's pretty good there's
03:21 - some documentation that could be better
03:23 - that we're working on that people are
03:24 - contributing to but let's just go right
03:26 - now to the github repository so one of
03:30 - the things this is the URL github.com
03:32 - slash processing p5.js one thing you
03:35 - should do is you should go click on
03:37 - contributors and just meditate for a
03:40 - minute and thank all these wonderful
03:41 - people who are putting in all these work
03:43 - and and I could say Karen just to
03:45 - highlight some people Karen paying to
03:47 - the in terms of WebGL Karen Peng
03:49 - indefinite and I think if we come down
03:52 - and and find also kate Hollenbach right
03:56 - here and I don't know it's Stahl Jia's
03:58 - Oh mind if Matthew did a lot of work in
04:00 - yeah here's a me I am Samia coding
04:02 - trained viewer so there's a lot of
04:03 - people on here
04:04 - I'm thang I'm just referencing some of
04:06 - the people who have done a lot of that
04:07 - WebGL work so something I can do now
04:10 - next is I could just go back here to
04:12 - commits now here's the thing I can sit
04:16 - here and look and look and look and look
04:17 - and look and look and try to find it
04:19 - look at look at dates and commits but I
04:22 - kind of there's got to be a way I can
04:23 - search for where this particular commit
04:26 - habit
04:27 - so let's go to to try to search what
04:30 - happened with zero point five point one
04:31 - five let's go to releases so we can see
04:34 - here zero point five point one six zero
04:37 - point five point one four hey where's
04:39 - point one five that's weird I don't know
04:45 - what I'm missing here so normally you
04:47 - would think there'd be a one five and oh
04:48 - yeah anyway I don't know maybe in my
04:50 - mind the math of my mind is just so we
04:53 - can see these are all the commits 628
04:56 - commits since this release so we would
04:58 - think that in these commits one of these
05:02 - one of these would have broken that
05:04 - point light now something that I could
05:06 - do first of all is I think an easier
05:08 - path towards finding us though might be
05:09 - where is the source code for point light
05:12 - itself okay that was a weird edit point
05:16 - if this video ever exists but I went
05:18 - down many different rabbit holes to try
05:20 - to find the bug and you might have seen
05:22 - some of that happening and what you
05:23 - watched up until now but this was pretty
05:26 - much a case where I my skill level I
05:28 - cannot fix this bug there's a couple of
05:30 - reasons one I don't have all day yeah I
05:33 - gotta go have some dinner too is I don't
05:36 - really know how the WebGL system works I
05:38 - wasn't one of the ones who designed it
05:40 - and I won't be able to investigate that
05:42 - fully right now and and three like this
05:46 - is a case where it wasn't like a small
05:48 - bit of code change that broke that I
05:51 - could look at reverting over the summer
05:53 - between version zero point five point
05:55 - one four and zero point five point one
05:57 - six all a lot of WebGL was kind of
06:00 - rewritten and structurally so so much
06:03 - changed and I think it's less a case of
06:05 - like if this thing broke and more of
06:07 - WebGL was rewritten in a new way and
06:10 - some things aren't working anymore so
06:11 - let's let the next step could be filing
06:14 - a github issue that's as helpful as
06:16 - possible so let's do that together here
06:19 - in this video so I'm going to go back to
06:21 - the p5.js repository and I'm going to go
06:26 - to issues and I'm going to first thing
06:29 - you should always do is I should look to
06:31 - see if there's already an issue so I'm
06:33 - going to search for point light point
06:38 - light not working that's October 9th
06:40 - that's
06:41 - interesting issue with positioning point
06:43 - lights so this could actually be this
06:46 - could actually be our issue let's take a
06:48 - look so this seems to be describing
06:54 - something different and look we should
06:56 - aspire to have such a well-written issue
07:00 - I asked Point Luke should you use
07:02 - real-world could rather than a
07:03 - normalized direction like directional
07:05 - light so this seems to be something
07:07 - different this seems to be an issue with
07:10 - and also this is using a previous
07:13 - version of p5 so I'm going to not worry
07:15 - about that so this I don't think is our
07:19 - issue although it might be related and
07:22 - positioning point lights so this I think
07:26 - is also a similar issue and so this way
07:32 - is probably worth referencing these two
07:34 - issues and then I just want to look at
07:38 - so let me save this here let me save
07:41 - these two issues and let me look
07:44 - what else could I look for lights yeah
07:50 - issues so I don't think there's anything
07:53 - else related to the light so I to this
07:55 - issue so I think we can file an issue so
07:57 - I'm gonna write a new issue now what I'm
08:00 - gonna say multiple point lights or
08:06 - directional lights not working I know
08:13 - maybe that's I don't love this title
08:14 - maybe somebody can think of something
08:15 - better now this is helpful I'm going to
08:18 - this can be this what so this is like a
08:22 - helpful guide so what I'm gonna do is
08:24 - instead of this I'm going to say I'm
08:27 - gonna leave some of this in here I'm
08:29 - gonna say found a bug and the most
08:33 - appropriate area is WebGL and which
08:39 - platform so this is using desktop and p5
08:48 - just version we are using zero point
08:51 - five point one six web browser
08:54 - is a chrome and I'm gonna say about
08:59 - Chrome and I'm gonna put this in there
09:06 - be really diligent about this and I'm
09:12 - going to say operating system Mac Mac OS
09:18 - X and my operating system is ten point
09:22 - eleven point six ten point eleven point
09:26 - six and now I'm going to take out these
09:30 - comments and I'm now I want to describe
09:33 - how do i reproduce this bug so the
09:40 - following code in the following simple
09:49 - example which positions two point lights
09:53 - one on the left one on on the right only
09:58 - the last point light is illuminated is
10:04 - active is seen is I selected mobile
10:08 - sorry thank you is the platform is wrong
10:13 - I got it I got it though is one on the
10:17 - left one on the right only that is
10:19 - activated is active so one now I want to
10:23 - add some code so one thing you can do is
10:25 - well you want to add a block of code you
10:27 - add it in between these backticks and
10:29 - you can actually say the language and I
10:31 - can now go to the sketch which is my
10:36 - code here and I could and I can get rid
10:40 - of this and just this so I'm gonna add
10:45 - this here so now I'm going to put this
10:46 - here the other thing I could do to be
10:49 - really kind of crazy is I could add some
10:53 - screenshots so I'm just say this is with
10:58 - the red light second so now I'm going to
11:05 - go to I'm over doing it just for effect
11:07 - here
11:08 - which you know that some of this may be
11:10 - unnecessary so so I'm going to take a
11:16 - little screen shot of this and then I'm
11:20 - gonna say and now I'm going to do the
11:22 - blue light second and I'm gonna do this
11:33 - and I'm gonna say back to my issue
11:41 - follow it with the red light second ie
11:50 - and I'm gonna take these two here and
11:58 - then I'm going to upload that image that
12:00 - screenshot which should be on the
12:02 - desktop of this one and that's the red
12:05 - light second with the blue light second
12:13 - and I'm going to take this screenshot
12:17 - and I'm gonna put the code in there the
12:27 - the this bug appeared somewhere between
12:35 - zero point five point one four and zero
12:38 - point five point one six using zero
12:42 - point five point one for the you both
12:46 - lights are active so now I'm going to go
12:50 - back to my code and I'm going to switch
12:53 - to zero point five point one four which
12:58 - I think that's what I'm doing here I'm
13:00 - going to run the sketch again I have too
13:06 - many things open and I'm going to
13:09 - screenshot this and I'm going to add
13:13 - that to this issue
13:19 - and then I'm gonna grab this one and put
13:22 - this here I'm also going to write the
13:26 - same bug exists for directional light
13:36 - this may be related to and then so I'm
13:40 - writing here this may be related to and
13:43 - so remember had these issues two two
13:46 - five one so I want to reference those
13:49 - other issues by their number two two
13:52 - five one that's an issue that I think
13:53 - might be related and what's the other
13:58 - one one six two two then I'm gonna say
14:07 - this issue was filed by the viewers of
14:12 - the coding train live okay so now the
14:17 - next thing I can do is I can check my
14:19 - work so I can go over here to preview
14:23 - and we can see here whoops so I've got
14:26 - some weird mistakes here which is it got
14:28 - like some spaces here so I found a bug
14:34 - WebGL p5 GS version web browser
14:37 - operating system in the following simple
14:39 - example which positions to point lights
14:41 - one on the left one on the right only
14:42 - the last point light is active I don't
14:46 - like the way that sounds
14:47 - only the the the the second call to
14:54 - point light the second call to point
14:56 - light overrides the first rather than
15:00 - adding a new light that makes more sense
15:03 - I think so the second call to point
15:05 - light overrides the first rather than
15:07 - adding a new light so here's the code
15:10 - with the red lights I know these are
15:12 - huge these images that's fine though I
15:15 - guess and then with the blue second
15:18 - light this bug appeared using 0.5 on
15:21 - both lights are active the same bug
15:22 - exists for directional light and this
15:24 - may be related this okay calling all
15:28 - viewers I think this issue is done does
15:32 - anybody
15:33 - have any suggestions anything that I
15:35 - missed or anything that would be helpful
15:37 - here adding a point light overwrites the
15:41 - previous one yeah ii call it a point
15:44 - light and let's call that let's make
15:46 - this a function and you can use a single
15:49 - backtick overwrites the first rather
15:52 - than adding a new light
15:53 - so Austin is saying that I should have
15:56 - checked if the issue was closed and
15:58 - reported in a previous version too I
16:00 - should I'm tired now so please if
16:04 - somebody finds something else that's
16:06 - relevant that it was open and closed
16:07 - please add that as a comment to this
16:08 - issue only the final light source is
16:13 - rendered okay I like that only final
16:18 - light source point light directional
16:23 - light is rendered do we like this better
16:29 - I think this might be better let's let's
16:34 - use the camel case for these since
16:36 - they're the function names to someone
16:38 - saying there's a 2 2 5 7 issue is that
16:41 - what I said already one thing that I
16:43 - should mention that I should have also
16:45 - done a search for is that there have
16:47 - been 382 commits since October 11th and
16:50 - 0.5 point 1 6 is from October 11th so
16:54 - one of these could have actually fixed
16:55 - it and I'm not going to see that fix so
16:57 - I should search through also the closed
17:00 - issues I couldn't find anything and a
17:02 - very kind viewer has actually checked
17:04 - that the current version of p5 even from
17:07 - github that's not that's newer than 0.5
17:09 - point one six isn't working so I think
17:13 - this issue is ready to be filed now I
17:15 - should do a follow-up video somebody
17:17 - remind me of this to show you how do you
17:19 - really check that how do you build and
17:21 - use p5 GS from they'll get hub
17:25 - repository how do you have the most
17:26 - recent version that includes includes
17:28 - fixes following the most recent release
17:30 - that would be worth looking at at some
17:31 - point in this new series I have about
17:34 - how to work with open source projects on
17:35 - github hopefully better than I can do
17:39 - because I'm apparently not very good at
17:41 - this but I'm trying my best so let's go
17:42 - back to that issue and I want sort of me
17:44 - to close all my tabs I definitely should
17:46 - so are
17:47 - final title is only the final light
17:52 - source point light directional light is
17:56 - rendered
18:04 - and this is all the code these are the
18:07 - different screenshots I think is ready
18:09 - to go I don't know about the title I'm
18:12 - still not so sure about the title but
18:14 - this is gonna have to be yeah there
18:16 - isn't there could be Knightly build oh
18:17 - there's too much too much gray we'll
18:18 - talk about this up in another video okay
18:20 - Matthew if you could salvage this you
18:22 - are a genius I'm gonna submit this issue
18:25 - this is very exciting
18:27 - oh now I don't think you have the
18:31 - permissions to do this but because I am
18:33 - an owner of this repository I can
18:36 - actually tag it with WebGL so I'm gonna
18:38 - do that and I'm gonna do submit yeah
18:49 - alright thank you everybody good night
18:53 - good night good night thank you thank
18:54 - you thank you very much thank you very
18:55 - much thank you thank you thank you oh
18:57 - it's so well just as I had imagined
19:04 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

I'm very excited about this video I don't know if this is gonna be helpful or make any sense maybe you're watching it maybe you're not I mean you are watching it well here's what I'm gonna do this I'm gonna try to have a new series to put that's in a playlist don't know series about finding bugs and open source projects and contributing and helping to fix those bugs like how do we do that and this is going to be a heart this is a high degree of difficulty one so I'm not starting with something simple and this will probably fail but I'm gonna do my best so I just did a whole set of tutorials about WebGL and one of the thin p5 one of the things I noticed with help from the viewing audience is that if I put two point lights in the scene here's a point light that's red that's on the right side of the canvas here's a point light that's blue that's on the left side RGB X Y Z and then I have a sphere with ambient material that will reflect that light what do I actually see I only see a blue light on the left now this is using p5 version zero point five point one six so let's just let's just be sure about this so I'm going to take this point light and put it second now you can see only the red point light what I want to see and I'm going to show you this really quickly I'm gonna go to my index of HTML file and I'm gonna switch I'm gonna talk about how I'm doing this i'ma switch versions of the library this isn't working this isn't working with version zero point five point seven so somewhere in between zero point five point seven and zero point five point one six this feature broke this is I feel like I want some like cool Oh didn't didn't didn't paying pants the hurts themes fun music to play because we're gonna do some detective work now how can we find this so first of all how did I switch between the libraries so quickly so one thing you might notice about this particular bit of code you can ignore this kittens folder but I actually have the p5.js library here locally and that is the current though the current as of the time of recording this video version of the library and in this and you can see here in my HTML file I'm referencing that particular local p5.js file now it's now commented out I could commented back in what I decided to do it's really eat much easier is that I could use something called CDN which is stands for content delivery network and if I search for CDN p5.js what I'll get is this particular website C D and J Escom and it has hosted versions of the library that I can reference in from my HTML file and I can get the links for any old version now one of the ways I'm going to do this right now is I'm just gonna go here I'm gonna put 16 in here and I could just we could do this all day right I'm gonna go back sorry to the sketch hit refresh it's broken so I could say 0.15 still broke it point 1 4 still up it's working in 0.5 point one four so for some reason I went all the way back to zero point five point seven when I was doing my session but now I can see it actually works in 0.5 0.5 0.14 so what does this mean time for me to go to github so the p5.js project is an open source project on github it's a complex open source project with many files and many developer tool like workflow like crazy things or some documentation that's pretty good there's some documentation that could be better that we're working on that people are contributing to but let's just go right now to the github repository so one of the things this is the URL github.com slash processing p5.js one thing you should do is you

next is I could just go back here to commits now here's the thing I can sit here and look and look and look and look and look and look and try to find it look at look at dates and commits but I kind of there's got to be a way I can search for where this particular commit habit so let's go to to try to search what happened with zero point five point one five let's go to releases so we can see here zero point five point one six zero point five point one four hey where's point one five that's weird I don't know what I'm missing here so normally you would think there'd be a one five and oh yeah

that was a weird edit point if this video ever exists but I went down many different rabbit holes to try to find the bug and you might have seen some of that happening and what you watched up until now but this was pretty much a case where I my skill level I cannot fix this bug there's a couple of reasons one I don't have all day yeah I gotta go have some dinner too is I don't really know how the WebGL system works I wasn't one of the ones who designed it and I won't be able to investigate that fully right now and and three like this is a case where it wasn't like a small bit of code change that broke that I could look at reverting over the summer between version zero point five point one four and zero point five point one six all a lot of WebGL was kind of rewritten and structurally so so much changed and I think it's less a case of like if this thing broke and more of WebGL was rewritten in a new way and some things aren't working anymore so let's let the next step could be filing a github issue that's as helpful as possible so let's do that together here in this video so I'm going to go back to the p5.js repository and I'm going to go to issues and I'm going to first thing you should always do is I should look to see if there's already an issue so I'm going to search for point light point light not working that's October 9th that's interesting issue with positioning point lights so this could actually be this could actually be our issue let's take a look so this seems to be describing something different and look we should aspire to have such a wellwritten issue I asked Point Luke should you use realworld could rather than a normalized direction like directional light so this seems to be something different this seems to be an issue with and also this is using a previous version of p5 so I'm going to not worry about that so this I don't think is our issue although it might be related and positioning point lights so this I think is also a similar issue and so this way is probably worth referencing these two issues and then I just want to look at so let me save this here let me save these two issues and let me look what else could I look for lights yeah issues so I don't think there's anything else related to the light so I to this issue so I think we can file an issue so I'm gonna write a new issue now what I'm gonna say multiple point lights or directional lights not working I know maybe that's I don't love this title maybe somebody can think of something better now this is helpful I'm going to this can be this what so this is like a helpful guide so what I'm gonna do is instead of this I'm going to say I'm gonna leave some of this in here I'm gonna say found a bug and the most appropriate area is WebGL and which platform so this is using desktop and p5 just version we are using zero point five point one six web browser is a chrome and I'm gonna say about Chrome and I'm gonna put this in there be really diligent about this and I'm going to say operating system Mac Mac OS X and my operating system is ten point eleven point six ten point eleven point six and now I'm going to take out these comments and I'm now I want to describe how do i reproduce this bug so the following code in the following simple example which positions two point lights one on the left one on on the right only the last point light is illuminated is active is seen is I selected mobile sorry thank you is the platform is wrong I got it I got it though is one on the left one on the right only that is activated is active so one now I want to add some code so one thing you can do is well you want to add a block of code you add it in between these backticks and you can actually say the language and I can now go to the sketch which is my code here and I could and I can get rid of this and just this so I'm gonna add this here so now I'm going to put this here the other thing I could do to be really kind of crazy is I could add some screenshots so I'm just say this is with the red light second so now I'm going to go to I'm over doing it just for effect here which you know that some of this may be unnecessary so so I'm going to take a little screen shot of this and then I'm gonna say and now I'm going to do the blue light second and I'm gonna do this and I'm gonna say back to my issue follow it with the red light second ie and I'm gonna take these two here and then I'm going to upload that image that screenshot which should be on the desktop of this one and that's the red light second with the blue light second and I'm going to take this screenshot and I'm gonna put the code in there the the this bug appeared somewhere between zero point five point one four and zero point five point one six using zero point five point one for the you both lights are active so now I'm going to go back to my code and I'm going to switch to zero point five point one four which I think that's what I'm doing here I'm going to run the sketch again I have too many things open and I'm going to screenshot this and I'm going to add that to this issue and then I'm gonna grab this one and put this here I'm also going to write the same bug exists for directional light this may be related to and then so I'm writing here this may be related to and so remember had these issues two two five one so I want to reference those other issues by their number two two five one that's an issue that I think might be related and what's the other one one six two two then I'm gonna say this issue was filed by the viewers of the coding train live okay so now the next thing I can do is I can check my work so I can go over here to preview and we can see here whoops so I've got some weird mistakes here which is it got like some spaces here so I found a bug WebGL p5 GS version web browser operating system in the following simple example which positions to point lights one on the left one on the right only the last point light is active I don't like the way that sounds only the the the the second call to point light the second call to point light overrides the first rather than adding a new light that makes more sense I think so the second call to point light overrides the first rather than adding a new light so here's the code with the red lights I know these are huge these images that's fine though I guess and then with the blue second light this bug appeared using 0.5 on both lights are active the same bug exists for directional light and this may be related this okay calling all viewers I think this issue is done does anybody have any suggestions anything that I missed or anything that would be helpful here adding a point light overwrites the previous one yeah ii call it a point light and let's call that let's make this a function and you can use a single backtick overwrites the first rather than adding a new light so Austin is saying that I should have checked if the issue was closed and reported in a previous version too I should I'm tired now so please if somebody finds something else that's relevant that it was open and closed please add that as a comment to this issue only the final light source is rendered okay I like that only final light source point light directional light is rendered do we like this better I think this might be better let's let's use the camel case for these since they're the function names to someone saying there's a 2 2 5 7 issue is that what I said already one thing that I should mention that I should have also done a search for is that there have been 382 commits since October 11th and 0.5 point 1 6 is from October 11th so one of these could have actually fixed it and I'm not going to see that fix so I should search through also the closed issues I couldn't find anything and a very kind viewer has actually checked that the current version of p5 even from github that's not that's newer than 0.5 point one six isn't working so I think this issue is ready to be filed now I should do a followup video somebody remind me of this to show you how do you really check that how do you build and use p5 GS from they'll get hub repository how do you have the most recent version that includes includes fixes following the most recent release that would be worth looking at at some point in this new series I have about how to work with open source projects on github hopefully better than I can do because I'm apparently not very good at this but I'm trying my best so let's go back to that issue and I want sort of me to close all my tabs I definitely should so are final title is only the final light source point light directional light is rendered and this is all the code these are the different screenshots I think is ready to go I don't know about the title I'm still not so sure about the title but this is gonna have to be yeah there isn't there could be Knightly build oh there's too much too much gray we'll talk about this up in another video okay Matthew if you could salvage this you are a genius I'm gonna submit this issue this is very exciting oh now I don't think you have the permissions to do this but because I am an owner of this repository I can actually tag it with WebGL so I'm gonna do that and I'm gonna do submit yeah alright thank you everybody good night good night good night thank you thank you thank you very much thank you very much thank you thank you thank you oh it's so well just as I had imagined
