With timestamps:

00:02 - hello I'm really out of practice with it
00:07 - it's me
00:09 - mostly working subin formed band
00:12 - shipment person things here live on
00:16 - Fridays
00:18 - every Friday although I haven't been
00:20 - here since sometime before June 27 I am
00:27 - seeing some comments in the chat saying
00:29 - audio good video good I'm going to lower
00:32 - my background music let's Tori the dog
00:37 - by Adam Blau and so playing in the
00:41 - background I'm here I'm back I'm seeing
00:45 - a chat going I I don't even know what to
00:47 - say let's see so what's going on here
00:50 - thank you for tuning in my name is Dan
00:52 - I forgot how to pronounce my last name
00:54 - it's something like Schiffman and I
00:59 - attempt when I'm not falling off of a
01:02 - bicycle to be here once a week every
01:05 - Friday doing some creative coding fun
01:08 - times on the Internet now I don't want
01:12 - to
01:12 - I could easily by accident spend the
01:15 - next two hours talking about all of the
01:18 - different exciting and intriguing and
01:20 - fascinating medical experiences I've
01:22 - been through in the last two months I
01:23 - think I will come back if anybody is
01:25 - actually interested in some of that
01:27 - stuff just to kind of like fill in some
01:30 - of those gaps maybe towards the end of
01:31 - the livestream I can answer some
01:32 - questions to just talk about what's
01:34 - going on I am wearing a compression
01:36 - sleeve
01:36 - there's no cast here my elbow does move
01:39 - I did break my elbow I did also break
01:41 - this wrist but I I also had my funny
01:44 - bone removed or actually moved so this
01:46 - is important because I don't know that I
01:49 - was ever any funny at all
01:50 - but something might be off so there is
01:53 - no funny bone you might actually know
01:55 - it's not a bone it's something called
01:56 - the older nerve which is a nerve that
01:58 - passes around the back of your elbow and
02:01 - it can get aggravated or entrapped and
02:03 - this is what happened to me after the
02:05 - accident as a separate complication
02:07 - where I lost now see I'm doing it I'm
02:08 - talking about the whole thing but I
02:10 - think I lost complete feeling in these
02:11 - two fingers and use of this
02:13 - and so anyway my older nerve was moved
02:15 - from here now to here so I can like get
02:19 - the funny bone sensation oh that
02:21 - actually worked if I tap right there
02:23 - it's really weird okay I can also do the
02:28 - robot very well because I don't have
02:29 - full range of motion yeah if I'm doing a
02:31 - lot of physical therapy I will come back
02:32 - to and answer questions about this huh
02:34 - okay
02:36 - this is not a medical stream why levae
02:39 - who is in the chat okay wait where's my
02:42 - water I'm a little bit late because I
02:45 - don't have any coffee or any tea today I
02:47 - usually the other thing is I'm very weak
02:49 - but I can open this so I did teach three
02:52 - classes this week live in person here at
02:55 - New York University that gave me the
02:58 - confidence to come back and I am now
03:00 - making a commitment to be here every
03:04 - Friday there will be some Fridays that I
03:06 - will miss so actually one of the first
03:08 - things I want to mention ads are coming
03:10 - up in this computer I have a lot of
03:11 - things that I want to talk about a lot
03:14 - being too maybe more than that but one
03:17 - of the things I want to just start with
03:18 - is I'm saying I'm gonna be here every
03:20 - Friday I haven't said a runner time it's
03:22 - so important you know any when you like
03:24 - read things about how'd it be a content
03:26 - creator and to that what's the year 2017
03:30 - you know you must establish you know
03:32 - build an audience how do you market but
03:33 - I blah blah blah blah or not a drink of
03:34 - this stuff but I am told
03:36 - it's really good to establish a regular
03:38 - weekly time of which I have never been
03:40 - able to do in the last I think have I
03:42 - been doing this two years I think so
03:46 - will soar here okay I can't do this it's
03:48 - very uncomfortable okay okay okay so I'm
03:54 - doing the thing where I say okay okay
03:55 - all the time again anyway there's a lot
03:59 - of people here I'm being told I'm gonna
04:01 - just check it's a little bit vain for me
04:03 - to check but I'm a little bit curious
04:05 - no yeah okay Mon this computer in my I
04:10 - have to turn the audio off on this
04:11 - computer and I can't see how many people
04:13 - here oh there's 500 people here that's a
04:14 - great number that's perfectly but though
04:16 - that's a regular perfectly reasonable
04:18 - normal number okay I got to go back here
04:20 - to this chat alright so I would like to
04:23 - establish a regular time
04:26 - and if I go to twitter.com slash
04:29 - Schiffman I put up recently a poll I
04:36 - thought oh yeah here we go so if you
04:40 - this is the link to it so if you want to
04:43 - go to straw poll com hopefully somebody
04:45 - can just who has privileges can paste
04:47 - this in the chat straw poll comm /yp III
04:52 - z RW see nice URL you can I'm just
04:57 - trying to get a sense of what's best for
04:59 - people but honestly I might do a
05:01 - different time every Friday so just stay
05:03 - tuned Friday morning I'll usually post
05:05 - the time or I'll tweet about it on
05:06 - Thursday if you're looking for the time
05:07 - but it's definitely this semester is
05:09 - going to be Friday's I have a I could
05:11 - tell you about all my schedule Monday
05:12 - Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and I know
05:14 - once a while I like to do a surprise
05:15 - extra bonus livestream I had all these
05:18 - people lined up not all I had three or
05:20 - four people lined up to do guest spots
05:22 - in August and when I was healing and
05:24 - thought I would be able to come back and
05:25 - then I had this extra complication ahead
05:27 - of another surgery so that all fell
05:29 - apart but hopefully I'll get some of
05:30 - those guest spots coming in those will
05:32 - be other times during the week as well
05:34 - or just videos that will appear on your
05:35 - feet if they're not live streamed okay
05:37 - so you can come here and let's just
05:38 - check the results out of curiosity looks
05:40 - like people like the for the most part
05:42 - like the later time but we'll see okay
05:45 - so if I do every Friday there are a
05:47 - couple Friday's where I might not be
05:49 - here one of which I really want to
05:50 - highlight and mention really excited to
05:52 - tell you about something called
05:54 - processing Community Day this is an
05:57 - event for people to gather in person
06:00 - really for the first time processing as
06:02 - a project has been around since 2001
06:05 - I've talked about this before started by
06:08 - Casey Reis and Ben fry at the MIT Media
06:10 - Lab in fact processing the first
06:12 - processing Community Day will be at the
06:14 - MIT Media Lab on October 21st in Boston
06:17 - I will be there and you can purchase a
06:21 - ticket if you are able to come here at
06:24 - this website the website is de
06:26 - processing gorg and when I say purchase
06:28 - a ticket it's very reasonably priced at
06:31 - and you click here at I think it's $15
06:35 - but anyway you can find it yourself
06:39 - and some things that I want to mention
06:41 - about it I in theory I'm going to do it
06:44 - live this is live but live in person
06:47 - coding Train episode I don't have no
06:50 - idea what that's going to be Ben Frey
06:53 - Casey Ari Lauren McCarthy and Casey
06:55 - Reese will be there Eva Diaz will be
06:58 - there fathom information design will be
07:00 - there johanna head busted it harry all
07:03 - sorts of wonderful people you can apply
07:05 - to give a lightning talk if you're
07:07 - interested and I should mention that
07:09 - they enjoy who is the founder of the
07:13 - school for poetic one of the co-founder
07:15 - of the school report a computation that
07:16 - I've talked about that I've recorded
07:17 - many videos at is organizing is that is
07:22 - a his organ is the organiser of
07:24 - processing Community Day so if you I
07:26 - would highly encourage you to check out
07:28 - his medium post where he wrote about the
07:30 - kind of ideas behind Community Day and
07:33 - what it's about so I could go on and on
07:34 - and on about this but I wanted to
07:37 - mention it mention it ok any questions
07:44 - oh yeah whoops oh so I forgot thank you
07:47 - somebody I think I got to turn this off
07:49 - I don't know where you were to see it
07:52 - now if I click on here no that's send a
07:55 - super chat where do I look at it here
07:57 - okay hold on
07:58 - ah super chat okay Thank You Jamie
08:02 - Nichols so I forgot I meant to turn this
08:04 - off guy was sort of curious about it to
08:07 - u n-- in the chasey in the chat did that
08:10 - okay hold on am i back
08:12 - I can't tell I'm waiting for somebody to
08:14 - see I'm gonna I'm not gonna do anything
08:18 - till I know we're back okay I saw
08:19 - somebody say we're back okay so
08:21 - hopefully I don't know what's gonna
08:22 - happen here if this is gonna end up
08:23 - getting chopped up into a million I this
08:25 - always seems to happen whenever I'm not
08:28 - using the computer and stuff for a while
08:29 - it comes back and I the fact that it
08:32 - crashed just now and actually it crashed
08:33 - on me when I was getting set up a couple
08:35 - times I was just like let's not worry
08:37 - about I restarted the computer the fact
08:39 - that it crashed on me not just now I
08:40 - have a little bit of a worry that that's
08:42 - gonna do that again so if the street I'm
08:45 - gonna be here till live stream until uh
08:47 - somewhere between 5:30 and 6:00 p.m.
08:50 - that's Eastern time so an hour hour and
08:52 - a half to two hours
08:54 - and so if I disappear I'm not ending it
08:56 - until then I'll say when I'm saying
08:58 - goodbye so apologies for that okay so
09:02 - what I talked about processing Community
09:04 - Day and so that's one of the that that's
09:11 - one of the Friday's I won't be live
09:12 - online there's a loud drumbeat you guys
09:18 - can't hear that can you there's like
09:22 - cheering there's like a film class going
09:24 - on in the room right behind me here they
09:26 - finish at 5:15 it'll quiet down then
09:29 - okay so that's one thing I wanted to
09:32 - mention now I was talking about this
09:33 - super chat which I left on my accident I
09:35 - was experimenting with it but III think
09:37 - I probably will turn that off at some
09:39 - point if I can because if you're
09:40 - interested in supporting the work that
09:42 - I'm doing and the coding training again
09:44 - you should always first consider
09:47 - supporting the processing foundation and
09:49 - you can go to now I'm hearing feedback
09:51 - but hopefully that's not me now a
09:55 - processing foundation support alright
10:02 - trying again I'm now what I just did is
10:08 - I launched an older version of the
10:09 - Wirecast software one of these days I'm
10:11 - gonna switch to open broadcast studio
10:13 - there's actually a new version Wirecast
10:14 - to 8 maybe I'll consider getting that I
10:16 - really do like the Wirecast software
10:17 - it's worked great for me but apparently
10:19 - it's not working like it knows that I am
10:21 - like I crap now it's like I feel you're
10:25 - crashed pain and I am also going to in
10:27 - solidarity crash over and over again get
10:31 - my nerve compressed and open up mine
10:34 - anyway so so if you are interested so I
10:41 - was saying please consider supporting
10:43 - the processing foundation by being a
10:45 - pressing foundation member and if you
10:48 - also feel so inclined you can support
10:51 - what I'm doing here via patreon patreon
10:53 - comm slash the coding train there's a
10:57 - reason why I was mentioning that super
11:00 - chance oh my god okay another thing I
11:02 - would like to mention I teach at a
11:06 - program
11:07 - called ITP this is the ITP website ITP
11:12 - is a two-year graduate program here at
11:14 - Tisch School of the Arts New York
11:16 - University in New York City guess what
11:19 - apparently starting in fall yeah 2018
11:24 - it's like next year the undergraduate
11:28 - BFA version of ITP called Interactive
11:32 - Media Arts ima because we like that an
11:36 - acronym acronyms we'll be accepting its
11:38 - inaugural class so I will be
11:40 - participating in this I don't know
11:43 - there's a lot of information I could
11:45 - attempt to give you but mostly what I
11:49 - want to say is that if you are
11:51 - interested you should go to ITP NYU edu
11:58 - slash I am I know we have a lot of
12:00 - younger viewers here who are maybe in
12:01 - high school even and might be looking
12:03 - for and here is a place where you can
12:05 - find out information about applying and
12:06 - there's going to be a Facebook open
12:10 - house on Monday
12:12 - how do I find that I know let's see
12:15 - about apply I mean okay so I'm gonna
12:17 - find out information about that and
12:20 - whenever this video becomes published
12:22 - and archived later I will put a link to
12:26 - how you can find the Facebook live I I'm
12:28 - assuming it's just at like Facebook /
12:31 - ITP underscore ima or ima underscore NYU
12:35 - or something this is a terrible idea for
12:39 - me to try to like a Google look at that
12:41 - and now the camera went off see
12:43 - everything is just run just as poorly as
12:46 - it used to be I'll find that I'll find
12:49 - that link later somebody can find the
12:51 - Facebook livestream okay people are
12:55 - being very impatient that I'm not coding
12:58 - hey have you ever watched the Kotick
13:00 - train before and this is on the train
13:02 - oh not so much on the coding I guess I
13:08 - don't know what's the train so I will
13:09 - get to coding I definitely will it's oh
13:11 - this iPad is not charging okay
13:17 - all right everything's working okay so
13:24 - what should we do about coding today I
13:27 - think those were the main things that I
13:29 - wanted to talk about that don't have to
13:31 - do with coding so let's talk about what
13:34 - I'm a little bit out of sorts and get my
13:37 - water it's always important on the
13:41 - coding train to do your physical therapy
13:46 - wrist exercises elbow exercises and oh
13:53 - thank you Dominic force from the chat
13:55 - just posted ITP Facebook page and
13:58 - there's actually some open houses in
14:00 - person if you're in the New York area
14:01 - that come a visit - okay so I was if you
14:08 - recall last time I was here you know the
14:12 - universe really does not want me to try
14:16 - to talk about I'm afraid to say it can I
14:22 - say it's just like machine learning
14:24 - first of all do you think this shirt is
14:25 - a problem like am I gonna cause YouTube
14:27 - compression issues which is with the
14:29 - shirt I think that you know the first
14:33 - time I mentioned machine learning on
14:35 - this channel the fire alarm went off and
14:37 - I had to evacuate the building and the
14:40 - second time I mentioned machine learning
14:44 - or no not the second time but once I got
14:46 - like a few machine learning videos I
14:48 - started on that I had this like bike
14:49 - accident broke my elbow and then I had
14:50 - to take two months off at least maybe
14:57 - gonna wait until next week so I if I go
15:01 - to my channel
15:04 - let me turn I'll play this off that's
15:08 - not going to um and I look here at like
15:10 - kind of recent uploads you'll see this
15:15 - is where this is what I was doing most
15:17 - recently there's some nonsense extra
15:20 - like videos about the bike accident or
15:22 - whatever but I did an introduction to
15:25 - neural networks I started talking about
15:27 - about perceptrons
15:31 - and multi-layer perceptrons started to
15:34 - do a little bit of matrix math and my
15:36 - goal is to build github.com / Schiffman
15:42 - neural network p5 a little toy does this
15:47 - work I love this stuff was broken last
15:49 - time I checked this is kind of working
15:51 - maybe it's working yeah so a little toy
15:54 - and I gotta change this we got to use
15:56 - that what's that there's all these new
15:57 - and missed replacements like fashion or
16:01 - cartoon characters something I got to
16:03 - get one of those so so a little toy
16:08 - neural network - to learn how the bits
16:14 - and pieces of neural networks work what
16:16 - is what is all the terminology what are
16:18 - they for how do they work how you code
16:19 - one from scratch I feel like that's an
16:22 - interesting and enjoyable experience for
16:24 - me and possibly for you the viewer and
16:26 - I'm going to continue that and we'll
16:28 - have a little librarian people can build
16:29 - things from it and a lot of what I want
16:31 - to use it for is actually to combine the
16:34 - neural network stuff with genetic
16:36 - algorithms and involve agents that can
16:39 - play little simple games or perform
16:40 - certain tasks so that's a goal that's
16:42 - going to happen barring any other thing
16:46 - that I can't anticipate that's gonna
16:47 - that's something I'm really going to
16:48 - focus on this fall September October
16:51 - November December I also want to spend
16:56 - some time there is I want to mention
16:58 - there's a new project called deep
17:00 - learning is and I kind of want to just
17:03 - find it on github which is a project
17:08 - from a Google research group I and so I
17:12 - want to use deep learn jas and combine
17:16 - that with p5 to make some more
17:18 - sophisticated examples and
17:19 - demonstrations where I don't have work
17:21 - you know that I can rely on a lower
17:23 - level library to handle all the guts of
17:26 - the machine learning for me and I can
17:28 - just make applications so um okay on my
17:31 - live streaming all right I don't
17:34 - remember what the last thing I said was
17:36 - but apparently I really got his talk
17:39 - talk
17:39 - about machine learning yeah I think I
17:49 - took to live East arted the computer
17:51 - hopeful hoping hoping that would help
17:53 - and I'm a little bit paranoid that
17:55 - that's now gonna have caused it's loud
17:57 - thinks now this is a new live stream and
17:59 - I have two separate video archives and
18:01 - poor Matthew who helps me with doing
18:05 - editing and managing the channel is
18:06 - gonna have to try to fix that I need
18:08 - like a code word it's not machine
18:11 - learning it's unicorn kittens I don't
18:16 - know that's not any good so I was saying
18:21 - that the low level stuff ready yeah so I
18:28 - was saying that I don't have the smarts
18:31 - or the time to develop something as
18:33 - sophisticated as deep learn Jes so you
18:36 - know I do have some examples that I've
18:37 - done with tensorflow and Python that I
18:38 - might do as well but this is where I'm
18:40 - this is the trajectory I'm going on I
18:42 - got to get off this topic okay here's
18:45 - the other announcement for this fall oh
18:49 - this camera is off I'm going to start
18:55 - hmm am I here ah I am going to start
19:03 - using something called I cannot reach
19:09 - this high but I can reach up there II I
19:13 - can write on the board's very exciting
19:16 - es6 what is es6 you might be wondering
19:21 - well yes 6 I was about to say is the new
19:26 - version of JavaScript but it's kind of
19:28 - absurd because yes 6 actually is a
19:31 - shorthand for is it II see M a
19:39 - 2015 and as I did the math earlier I
19:43 - worked this out it's been a lot of time
19:45 - all day trying to figure this out that
19:47 - is from two years ago
19:50 - [Music]
19:54 - it's very hard to like get back into the
19:58 - get back into the moment okay so es6
20:02 - ECMAScript 2015 let's find out what ECMA
20:05 - stands for somebody I'm sure knows this
20:12 - and I know you aren't seeing me right
20:14 - now ECM a it stands for somebody tell me
20:24 - what it stands for ECMA international
20:30 - european computer Manufacturers
20:34 - Association
20:37 - it's a standards organization so this is
20:40 - what I was talking about like two hours
20:42 - ago if you're watching this in the
20:43 - archive there's probably a jump cut
20:44 - where I couldn't get anything to work
20:45 - for like two hours etc etc and now what
20:49 - I was talking about was how this fall I
20:51 - want to start using the new which is not
20:55 - so new because from 2013 and now I
20:57 - remember the last thing I was saying was
20:58 - how it takes a while for a lot of these
21:02 - new specifications to be adopted because
21:04 - a lot of browsers don't support them
21:06 - immediately but it's time and then
21:09 - programmers what they have to do is if
21:11 - you're using syntax from es6 and you're
21:14 - expecting people to use your website
21:15 - from an older browser you need to run
21:17 - something I think it's called like Babel
21:19 - which is something special that you can
21:22 - have there in the background to
21:24 - translate your es6 syntax into the older
21:27 - more compatible syntax and then everyone
21:30 - just feels really sad and wants to lay
21:32 - down and take a nap we're not gonna lay
21:36 - down and take a nap no we are not going
21:39 - to take a nap we are gonna bite through
21:41 - this but I'm gonna use the assist 6
21:43 - syntax and I'm gonna say you know just
21:46 - use Chrome Firefox a recent browser
21:48 - let's go look up what it's supported by
21:51 - let's just see if we can find that I'm
21:54 - sure there's a nice chart or something
21:58 - [Music]
22:01 - oops browser support simon is writing in
22:11 - the chat that constant let our popular
22:13 - and I have to say Simon I think you are
22:15 - up past your foot very late wherever you
22:18 - are right now so this is like showing
22:22 - everything where is composed I don't
22:27 - want to look at this
22:28 - so desktop browser compatibility tables
22:34 - for es6 so I'll let you I'll let you
22:37 - look at that before the point of what
22:41 - I'm saying here is that I don't really
22:43 - want to worry about that what I want to
22:46 - do is start using some of the features
22:47 - that I find useful and the two main
22:49 - features that I'm going to start with
22:52 - apologies for that
22:56 - two main features I'm going to start
22:58 - with our let which is a new way of
23:02 - declaring a variable very similar to how
23:05 - one might declare a variable with the
23:07 - keyword var that's really exciting I
23:11 - mean this is gonna make an entire video
23:13 - tutorial about let in es6 okay hold on
23:16 - start this we're gonna edit this into a
23:18 - video tutorial welcome to a video about
23:23 - es6 and let instead of typing var type
23:28 - let good finished that's the end of
23:33 - video okay I don't know if we really
23:36 - will edit that and publish that as its
23:37 - own thing but I'm tempted to so there's
23:40 - more to say about that than that but I'm
23:42 - going to talk about that at some point
23:44 - and then I'm going to talk about the
23:47 - class what it means to write a class in
23:50 - es6 this is gonna be so exciting because
23:54 - it's going to help us through the pain
23:57 - of the constructor function this is me
24:00 - talking and doing physical therapy at
24:02 - the same time it's gonna help us through
24:06 - the pain of all that constructor
24:08 - function stuff and it's gonna make doing
24:09 - object
24:09 - to programming in JavaScript hopefully a
24:11 - little nicer syntax wise so let's solve
24:15 - a particular problem which I will dig
24:17 - into the details about and then there's
24:20 - also something called Const you know we
24:23 - just maybe I'll use it someday not right
24:25 - now okay so that's I'm gonna come to so
24:27 - what should I do what what do we have
24:29 - time for today by the way somebody in
24:33 - the chat just wrote anyone else from
24:34 - Hungary and I'm like ate lunch an early
24:38 - lunch was kind of a small lunch it was
24:40 - just little egg salad and a yogurt very
24:44 - hungry and I read that from anyone else
24:46 - hungry I was like there was what
24:50 - somebody ordered I don't really eat I'm
24:52 - not like tomatoes a little little rough
24:54 - on my throat and acid so don't don't do
24:56 - this but somebody once ordered a pizza
24:57 - while I was streaming live send it to me
24:59 - it was very very funny and I gave it to
25:01 - the students here Oh arrow functions K
25:04 - week mine asks about arrow functions so
25:07 - I will also this fall talked about arrow
25:11 - functions
25:12 - I have something to admit I don't
25:16 - understand this at all read some
25:19 - articles a couple people explained it to
25:21 - me I will look work through it and
25:24 - hopefully help it will make sense to me
25:26 - maybe it'll make sense to you you will
25:27 - help me I'll help you I don't know how
25:28 - that's gonna happen but this is a big
25:30 - question mark for me I know that fun fun
25:33 - function which is a great YouTube
25:35 - channel has a bunch of videos about es6
25:38 - features just watch videos things like
25:41 - know I mean that's actually I will watch
25:45 - those videos but I won't just read like
25:47 - write down the script and then say it
25:49 - again in my own voice
25:50 - that wouldn't be pointless but I will
25:53 - say it again in my own style with my own
25:55 - thoughts and if you really want to know
25:57 - the correct information you should watch
25:59 - fun fun function alright
26:01 - that's es6 let's do a coding challenge
26:05 - and by the way Austen fish in the chat
26:08 - is writing arrow functions are
26:10 - essentially one-line functions where the
26:12 - body of the function is implicitly
26:14 - returned there you go that makes sense
26:16 - to you all right
26:18 - and silence says that arrow functions
26:20 - are popular also
26:22 - okay so I'm starting to reach my limit
26:27 - of what I can manage to do I don't know
26:29 - if I should bother to get the music
26:31 - working because the music right now is
26:34 - not working
26:35 - I could I could play the music but it's
26:37 - gonna be very very loud and a little
26:38 - afraid to do that to your ears but I
26:40 - could do this
26:44 - is that really loud so me it's not that
26:47 - loud
26:51 - okay tell me if those sound effects were
26:54 - like really way too loud or if this is
26:59 - too loud as always I always forget the
27:00 - diss stop this stop okay what I want to
27:10 - see is in the YouTube chat in the slack
27:14 - chat the post can't adjust the volume
27:18 - levels in post they're not being
27:19 - recorded separately I want everyone to
27:23 - throw out some coding challenge ideas
27:25 - well either all they do is spin the
27:27 - wheel or a straw poll because I could do
27:31 - the straw poll coding challenge so what
27:34 - I actually what I wanted to okay
27:37 - this is what I want to do I'm gonna do
27:40 - what I said I was gonna do so I'm
27:42 - teaching again this course called
27:44 - programming from A to Z I've renamed the
27:46 - YouTube playlists for our thanks to
27:48 - Matt's suggestion programming with text
27:52 - because programming from A to Z sounds
27:54 - like oh this is a beginner level course
27:56 - this course is actually a quite advanced
27:57 - course I will this semester get to
28:02 - where's that sound effect wait
28:07 - Chrome extension going tap in Chrome
28:11 - extensions but it's the only thing that
28:17 - I have all of those they have video
28:18 - tutorials for all of these topics I'm
28:19 - going to add things like word to Veck
28:21 - I'm gonna do word Tyvek I'm gonna do
28:24 - something about recurrent neural
28:26 - networks and generating text so I also
28:28 - am going to add a bunch of tutorials
28:29 - about things that I haven't done up
28:32 - making an Alexa skill so there's a bunch
28:34 - of things that I'm adding to the course
28:36 - if you want to start from the beginning
28:37 - there's a playlist and things will get
28:39 - added k week Minh suggests a quaternion
28:42 - Chrome extension
28:45 - yeah Chrome extensions okay so but what
28:48 - I want to do is in this first week one
28:52 - of the things that I talked about is
28:55 - creating i'm scrolling like a crazy
28:58 - person here the homework assignment for
29:00 - the first week for my course would just
29:02 - started here at
29:02 - whyyou is to make a text
29:05 - nasha machine and you could make up your
29:09 - own what is how can you make an
29:11 - algorithm to retrieved to take text from
29:15 - a source something somebody typed in a
29:17 - text file that's loaded a Twitter feed
29:19 - it's something like that and create new
29:21 - text out of that that could be poetry
29:24 - that could be experimental in any number
29:28 - of ways so some examples of this
29:30 - historically are cut out machines from
29:35 - The Beat artist writer William Burroughs
29:41 - raise your poetry which i think is from
29:43 - the french writing collective Weibo if
29:46 - I'm saying that correctly the N + 7
29:49 - technique is one of my favorite things
29:51 - let's look at this page I just don't
29:53 - know the historical origins of n + 7 so
29:57 - what n + 7 does Oh it's also from Aleppo
30:01 - so the idea of n + 7 and the writer
30:04 - takes a poem already in existence and
30:06 - substitutes each of the poems
30:08 - substantive nouns with the noun
30:11 - appearing 7 nouns away in the dictionary
30:14 - so so this is like the N + 7 ruled a
30:19 - Wallace Stevens poem the Snowman what
30:21 - must have a miniature of wisdom to
30:23 - regard the fruit and the boulders of the
30:25 - pinions crusted with soap so that's one
30:30 - thing and then the die a stick technique
30:33 - which I've talked about in a video and I
30:34 - made a whole video about so there's also
30:37 - something called the flesh index which
30:39 - is something that I talked about in this
30:40 - course and has a little tutorial here
30:42 - about readability score the flesh index
30:45 - being a readability score what is the
30:46 - reading level is this that what kind of
30:48 - children's book is it a kind of
30:50 - newspaper article is it like a PhD
30:52 - thesis what's the reading level and you
30:54 - can kind of intuit think like well maybe
30:56 - articles that have longer sentences with
30:59 - words with more with more syllables
31:01 - those are higher reading levels versus
31:06 - something like with short sentences with
31:09 - one or two syllable words it's a lower
31:10 - reading level lower flesh index course
31:12 - so here are some options
31:16 - an eraser I talked about I didn't
31:18 - actually say what that was but an eraser
31:20 - is a kind of and this actually this is
31:23 - really useful for learning about Dom
31:25 - manipulation because if you have a I
31:26 - think I have some videos that do stuff
31:28 - like this but if you have a big body of
31:30 - text a challenge is how can you treat
31:32 - each word separately through JavaScript
31:36 - so like even though it looks like to the
31:38 - reader like it's one paragraph tag each
31:40 - character or each word is a separate
31:42 - span perhaps so that you can modify its
31:45 - color or its behavior so erasure n plus
31:49 - 7 oops n plus 7 I've no idea how I would
31:52 - do that I would need some kind of
31:53 - machine readable dictionary I could use
31:54 - like word Nick or word net erasure yes
31:58 - it's time to discover a little something
32:02 - to make like is that by the way after
32:08 - that whole sore throat is lots of like
32:10 - let me not go through the sore throat
32:12 - Fiasco from last year and you know knock
32:14 - on wood no more medical issues ok n plus
32:18 - 7 erasure n plus 7 what was the other
32:22 - one I've no memory anymore I just lose
32:25 - this page
32:26 - well I index there was another one racer
32:30 - n plus 7 die astok o cut-ups I could do
32:33 - a william burroughs cut up so it's
32:34 - probably like a not one of the less
32:36 - interesting ones let me see if there's
32:39 - any other yeah people wanted me to do
32:41 - games Angry Birds so yeah I'm gonna do
32:48 - something with text today that's what's
32:50 - gonna happen although honestly the game
32:52 - would be simpler so let's do one of
32:54 - these erase your n + 7 flesh cut ups so
32:58 - I'm going to say Creepo I'm gonna do all
33:03 - these a JavaScript as a web page and
33:05 - here is the straw poll the straw poll
33:13 - you URL Z WBFF CSP if somebody who has
33:17 - privileges can post this in the chat I
33:20 - will play you some music as always I
33:23 - always forget to this stop it stop it
33:25 - stop this duck
33:30 - [Music]
33:55 - [Music]
34:08 - [Music]
34:13 - is a type of poetry where the first
34:16 - blast or other letters in a line spell
34:19 - out a particular word or phrase like
34:21 - resist perhaps the most common and
34:24 - simple form of an acrostic poem is where
34:26 - the first letters of each line spell out
34:27 - a word or phrase that way this would be
34:30 - an interesting thing to program for sure
34:31 - it's not on my straw poll though whoops
34:36 - let's view the results people are really
34:39 - interested in the eraser which is good
34:41 - let me just show you what the because
34:43 - I've made an example I mean I actually I
34:46 - would have to build it so I'm gonna go
34:50 - to the example just to see it cuz it
34:51 - does present an interesting challenge
34:54 - and I'm gonna go find my examples here's
34:59 - the erasure poetry machine so so this is
35:04 - what it does what it does is you can see
35:07 - here I can hover over any word and
35:10 - highlight it and you have to excuse my
35:12 - poor graphic design abilities and I can
35:16 - click on it to erase it so I can do an
35:18 - irate it now obviously I could pick and
35:20 - like erase a whole bunch of things
35:21 - randomly I could have a slider that's
35:23 - what percentage of things to erase but
35:25 - this is kind of interesting how do you
35:26 - handle these interactions how it's not
35:27 - actually erased I just changed the color
35:29 - to white so it doesn't actually show up
35:31 - but interestingly enough keep spacing I
35:36 - could erase things
35:39 - and actually not keep that keep them
35:41 - there so that's a kind of interesting so
35:43 - this would be something that's
35:44 - interesting too to try and would
35:46 - demonstrate certainly a bunch of Dom
35:48 - manipulation techniques so I'm happy to
35:50 - try this now
35:50 - if you're not so interested to go back
35:52 - and vote for something else refresh
35:54 - results n plus seven is taken the lead
35:58 - whoa
35:59 - do we need a runoff people are not
36:01 - interested in the flesh our cut-offs
36:03 - acrostic was an interesting idea so
36:05 - let's let's uh I have a procrastination
36:09 - problem it's like six o'clock when I
36:10 - said I was going to leave but I'm gonna
36:11 - do a cocoa tin challenge today I'm not
36:17 - looking for sympathy it's just like a
36:19 - involuntary reaction okay so what I'm
36:23 - gonna do we're gonna do a run off may
36:25 - hit refresh one more time we're gonna
36:27 - add a cross stick n plus seven is really
36:29 - winning we are going to make a new straw
36:32 - poll and I'm going to say run off I'm
36:40 - gonna say n plus seven erasure right
36:44 - those were the two for the runoff and
36:46 - now an acrostic and again an acrostic is
36:49 - I showed it already so I'm free you know
36:53 - create the ball and the reason why I
36:57 - like the across because I actually don't
36:58 - have an example that does that so I
37:00 - think that's kind of an interesting idea
37:02 - wy4 to z ad three this is the URL straw
37:06 - poll calm I'm gonna give this the amount
37:09 - of time it takes this song it's one
37:13 - minute and eight seconds this way you
37:15 - have one minute in eight seconds stop
37:17 - stop
37:19 - [Music]
37:32 - [Music]
37:40 - [Music]
37:53 - 26 seconds
37:55 - we are waited should we see look at the
37:58 - middle again Boetticher curious rustic
38:03 - is winning by quite a bit that's
38:05 - interesting we've got 10 seconds left to
38:09 - vote I'm gonna do this stuff this dot
38:13 - this dot this is what I love about the
38:15 - across never forget the bits dot but
38:17 - somebody composed that song for me okay
38:20 - we're gonna remember refresh the results
38:21 - in five four three two one and acrostic
38:27 - is the winner acrostic we are going to
38:31 - program a coding town for that across
38:33 - again here's what I love about this what
38:35 - I want the acrostic and let me uh let's
38:39 - go back to here what I like about this
38:44 - Oh Oh interesting I think I'm gonna do
38:46 - it where the first letter so this is
38:48 - interesting that you could do it with a
38:49 - letter in the middle but to keep things
38:50 - simple I'm gonna do it with the first
38:53 - letter now what I'm going to do is I'm
38:56 - going to allow the user to enter in a
38:58 - text input a word and then the poem will
39:02 - generate with that word now here's the
39:05 - thing how do I get it to sound like
39:10 - language or sentences like do I just I
39:13 - think actually hmm what's an API I think
39:17 - the word Nick API let's look at word
39:20 - Nick for a second so I feel like using
39:22 - the word Nick API would be perfect for
39:24 - this so let's go look at that for a
39:27 - second
39:31 - because I think it gives me more than so
39:34 - what I want to do is boy haven't I have
39:38 - an API key already so I can find that
39:41 - somewhere in my stuff but where is that
39:44 - Docs I guess I'm looking for if I look
39:49 - up a word how do I ask search so search
40:03 - is what I probably want to give me words
40:04 - and start with a certain letter by the
40:06 - way I would love to take lank and the
40:11 - chat is saying please allow more time
40:13 - for the voting as we can't copy paste
40:15 - the URL in order to vote okay I will do
40:18 - that next time I apologize for that I'm
40:20 - kind of just being a goofball about this
40:21 - stuff I hope nobody was like really put
40:23 - out by the voting I will check it again
40:25 - it's still the same result but so I
40:29 - really like the word Nick API someone is
40:31 - saying use the dictionary API what I
40:33 - need are some suggestions in particular
40:35 - if you're a patron and in the slack
40:36 - Channel that would be great of how how
40:39 - to search for a particular word that
40:44 - starts with a certain letter so query is
40:46 - like what if I just do query a and do
40:51 - try it out so yeah now I get words that
40:59 - start with the letter A so I can
41:01 - definitely use the words search in Word
41:05 - Nick and I can do things like I can do
41:12 - things like oh but I can have it use it
41:16 - in a sentence I can have it use I can
41:19 - use the use it in a sentence and then
41:20 - position it for the acrostic so that
41:23 - that letter is highlighted maybe but I
41:25 - could do things like you know it had at
41:28 - least has to be like a five letter word
41:29 - like I'm changing the minimum length now
41:33 - and so now if I try it again I'm only
41:36 - getting five letter words I could do
41:38 - things like maximum corpus count like I
41:42 - could use words that aren't used that
41:43 - frequently so
41:44 - what if I said 50 between one here's
41:49 - only one time and fifty times I think
41:51 - that would probably be in try it out now
41:53 - I'm gonna get words like apparel Aang
41:55 - I don't even out go neurotic a borin see
41:58 - so this is expert so this is kind of
42:00 - interesting so I can definitely use I
42:04 - should so I will bold the first I can
42:06 - definitely use this to get some
42:09 - interesting words the question so maybe
42:12 - what I'm going to start with actually
42:13 - and and I'll leave this as an exercise
42:15 - I'm gonna do a simple conan challenge
42:17 - the simple coding challenge unless
42:19 - somebody has a better idea
42:22 - woop IP is in the chat I meant to say
42:26 - this actually earlier the first this is
42:27 - the first thing I don't meant to say
42:28 - then I don't know if we have any viewers
42:30 - in Florida or in the Caribbean that are
42:31 - even in Houston I'm just you know just
42:34 - want to say be safe everybody who's in
42:36 - there's paths of these hurricanes I
42:38 - don't know if any will any will come up
42:40 - and hit this far up I'm in New York or
42:41 - the east coast but okay I definitely can
42:44 - search by part of speech so I could do
42:47 - something like noun verb noun or
42:49 - something like that but I think what I'm
42:51 - going to do to simplify things is I'm
42:53 - gonna make an acrostic which is just a
42:56 - list of words bolding the first letter
42:59 - so the poem it's just going to be some
43:00 - strange words and then I think as an
43:03 - exercise for people watching the video
43:04 - the thing that they could expand on this
43:06 - would be to expand on this could be to
43:11 - like actually make the it more poem like
43:14 - think of a creative way to make it
43:16 - actually be lines of poetry the spacing
43:18 - of the poetry what other what else
43:20 - whatever link I use will of course I
43:23 - will share okay so so here we go
43:29 - let's get set up as always though as
43:38 - always
43:40 - okay so what do I need
43:43 - first please bear with me because it is
43:46 - now 6 p.m. and I was going to be late
43:48 - getting home so I would like to just
43:54 - check and make sure I have no emergency
43:56 - messages alka one of our viewers I know
44:17 - he's doing ok ok so I'm ready yes I need
44:48 - to get set up
44:51 - what I need is your neck website and I
44:57 - leave this acrostic poem no wonder it's
45:00 - just the good a directory too loud sorry
45:29 - too quiet
45:33 - better I am going to go to the finder
45:41 - here I'm going to I don't know a p5.js
45:54 - example this will work
45:57 - I should really use that p5 manager tool
46:01 - it's a node tool it's really awesome
46:04 - I'm gonna use that something to remind
46:05 - you next time and I'm going to reach
46:06 - change this to be called acrostic
46:12 - and then I'm gonna open up Adam still
46:21 - quieter people want the music quieter
46:24 - [Music]
46:32 - open your cross stick am I too loud put
46:58 - in the title acrostic and then I'm going
47:11 - to go to the test
47:17 - go to acrostic run a server good code so
47:25 - guess what
47:26 - [Music]
47:27 - nothing has changed here on the coding
47:31 - train in today's episode of the coding
47:35 - train I spent two hours rambling then
47:38 - having technical difficulty and didn't
47:40 - actually code until two hours into the
47:42 - livestream I should not do them okay
47:46 - let's open up the console vehicle is not
47:52 - just fine let's get rid of this
48:00 - it's got p5 okay so let's look at I need
48:03 - to get the most recent p5.js which is
48:12 - what a nice new version 0.54 let's
48:16 - update our p5.js here so this is the Dom
48:21 - library which I also need and now what I
48:27 - need is also p5.js I don't think I'm
48:30 - gonna use any sound
48:33 - so let me add that as well this this
48:36 - stuff will not go into the coding
48:38 - challenge this is just Cree getting
48:42 - ready ah it's so close I hit copy
48:48 - instead of paste backs there we go
48:50 - [Music]
48:53 - okay we are just about ready some girls
48:58 - and networks please okay all right
49:06 - function set up console dot log acrostic
49:12 - let's just see that things are working
49:16 - things are working and I lost those let
49:24 - me open up this we are so ready for this
49:30 - we are so ready for this who's ready for
49:32 - this okay
49:44 - my stomach is now devouring itself I
49:48 - think though all this moving around is
49:50 - probably good for my elbow okay
49:57 - hey you Ning is this thickening who is
50:02 - going to be appearing in a guest video
50:03 - soon was actually watching this I'm
50:05 - sorry that I haven't gotten back to you
50:06 - I just have been behind in everything
50:08 - but it's my intention to I'm trying to
50:10 - scroll back into the chat but hi inning
50:12 - if you're the yuning that will be
50:14 - appearing in a guest video soon okay
50:17 - everyone wants me to get started let's
50:20 - let me press the button on the camera
50:24 - let me do you think what's the chance
50:28 - that I'm gonna need the whiteboard
50:29 - during this coding challenge and I can't
50:31 - even find an eraser so even if I I guess
50:34 - I could use this tissue oh no here's my
50:36 - race no that's not the eraser you can't
50:39 - see me here but I'm going to Oh
50:42 - these cameras like changed how they
50:45 - worked one thing that I can't really do
50:51 - is erase because my arm is so weak still
50:55 - from that accident and all the time
50:57 - being in the cast and the splint and
50:59 - healing I can't like with this hand I
51:02 - could I could do it my left hand there's
51:04 - a solution I can't like put pressure and
51:06 - this tissue like does not really erase
51:08 - this stuff I can't really put pressure
51:18 - on a surface push down this is very
51:23 - silly I'm doing here wasting this time
51:25 - trying to erase this whiteboard but I'm
51:32 - doing it nonetheless okay good enough
51:41 - all right here we go
51:50 - you know I kind of want to have like a
51:53 - big moment because I have done a Cody
51:54 - challenge in like two months
51:55 - but boy this is like my fan is whirring
52:00 - like crazy but there's really no point
52:03 - in me doing that because someday all
52:05 - these videos will just exist in the
52:06 - library as if there was never any time
52:08 - involved at all and here we go ADA is
52:12 - here in the chat welcome ADA who used to
52:14 - live apparently in a different state
52:16 - compared to where she lives right now
52:18 - okay here we go um by the way I don't
52:24 - know if anybody is a moderator there's a
52:26 - new thing oh good somebody's already
52:27 - fixing that somebody's already doing
52:28 - that I have a new like protection in the
52:30 - chat against I turned on a YouTube like
52:33 - chat Auto moderation okay
52:35 - stop it I know what you want me to do
52:41 - you really want me just to read some
52:43 - random digits don't you you haven't
52:45 - waited two and a half hours for me to
52:47 - actually code something just to have you
52:48 - read some random digits have you eight
52:55 - thousand eight hundred seven thirty
52:59 - thousand I love torturing you I just
53:21 - really really do I was like what are the
53:25 - greatest moments of my life just right
53:27 - now because I know how much nobody
53:29 - wanted me to do that
53:31 - [Music]
53:34 - hello welcome to another coding
53:37 - challenge this is a coding challenge as
53:39 - part of my programming with text stuff
53:41 - and I'm going to attempt to do something
53:43 - that I actually didn't I knew about this
53:45 - before but I forgotten about it someone
53:46 - in the chat during one of my live
53:47 - streams mentioned it so I'm going to
53:49 - attempt in this video to program what's
53:52 - called an acrostic
53:57 - I want it to tell like time that with
53:59 - the zoom thing but that didn't really
54:00 - work so what is an acrostic an acrostic
54:02 - is a poem or other form of writing in
54:05 - which the first letter or syllable
54:07 - interesting enough of each line spells
54:09 - out a word message or the alphabet so
54:12 - what I want to do and I'm going to just
54:13 - come over to the whiteboard to explain
54:15 - this is like if we have a certain word
54:17 - like mango I can't believe I didn't use
54:22 - rainbow or blueberry blueberry rainbow
54:24 - or unicorn but then I want to have a
54:27 - poem where the first sentence is like my
54:31 - beautiful flower always smells nice and
54:39 - oh that's fine oh it starts I have no
54:51 - ability to be creative and think with
54:54 - words it's just not with a baby you will
54:56 - do something better and plus we're gonna
54:57 - ask the computer do this anyway so now I
54:59 - think there's a lot of interesting
55:00 - questions about this what I want to do
55:02 - is create a web page that has a text
55:05 - input box so the user could type in a
55:08 - word and then get the acrostic coming
55:10 - down now across it can be a lot of
55:11 - things it can we can work with syllables
55:13 - the the actual like letter could appear
55:16 - in the middle of each sentence it could
55:17 - be highlighted there's so many stylish
55:19 - interesting things you can do but I'm
55:20 - gonna try to do something really simple
55:21 - I'm just gonna create a little pom as
55:24 - one word per line and each word starts
55:26 - with that letter now it's not it seems
55:27 - like it's not a lot but I think we're
55:29 - gonna get some good JavaScript HTML Dom
55:32 - manipulation stuff maybe I'll use the
55:35 - word Nick API to find words that start
55:37 - with a certain letter and then
55:38 - you after watching this video can
55:40 - improve on this and make a more creative
55:42 - version that does something more
55:43 - stylistic visual animates are actually
55:46 - has think about ways that you might use
55:47 - oh I could have done something like a
55:49 - Markov chain I this Markov chain videos
55:52 - to like generate the text that starts
55:54 - with a given letter some kind of white
55:56 - there's a word I'm not allowed to say
55:57 - anymore because it makes everything
55:58 - crash its rhymes with machine burning
56:03 - but I can't say it's the topic that
56:06 - shall not be named but you could use
56:09 - that to like some kind of it rhymes with
56:12 - maccer n't rural wet work anyway onto
56:20 - the coatings I took too much time code
56:23 - already so it says in the chat it is
56:25 - time now to code and so here's a
56:27 - Wikipedia page for an acrostic we can
56:29 - see one that is here from 1850 and you
56:33 - can read more about it now I'm in the
56:34 - wrong place let's redo that at point
56:39 - format yeah thank you about yeah let's
56:42 - get to coding being told to code so you
56:45 - could read more about acrostics here
56:47 - obviously on the wikipedia page you can
56:48 - see a nice example here and i already
56:50 - have open the word Nick
56:53 - developer API because I thought a while
56:55 - ago that I was going to use this so
56:56 - let's get started the first thing we
56:58 - need to do and I've got some code here
57:01 - there's nothing in this what I want to
57:03 - do is first at least add I'm gonna
57:05 - acrostic a header in the HTML page then
57:10 - I want to make a little paragraph and I
57:11 - want to make what do you call this thing
57:13 - input word list do it I I can't even
57:21 - remember I I haven't coded in so long I
57:23 - don't even remember what this stuff is
57:24 - but hopefully this is gonna be right
57:26 - let's look at our web page now there we
57:30 - go so the idea here is that I type in a
57:32 - word like mango or a unicorn who would
57:35 - be cool actually if it's constantly
57:37 - generating the acrostic as you're typing
57:39 - so it's like actually generating with
57:41 - each letter each letter your delete but
57:42 - let's not do that on the fly let's have
57:44 - a submit button and let's add a button
57:47 - and say submit button so
57:51 - we have the submit button the idea here
57:54 - is that I'm gonna say unicorn and I'm
57:57 - gonna hit submit
57:58 - and I'm gonna see my across the carrier
58:00 - that's very hard for you to see this
58:01 - tiny tiny tiny tiny stuff but now you
58:03 - can see that it's bigger okay so we've
58:04 - got the web page and of course you as
58:06 - the viewer of this video can make it
58:08 - much more beautiful and interesting
58:09 - interactive web page that gets the word
58:11 - in a different way but this is where
58:13 - I'll start next what I need to do is oh
58:18 - you know what be interests we could use
58:19 - a kit well we're not gonna use canvas
58:21 - I'm using the p5.js library as I often
58:23 - do but I'm not gonna use canvas so I'm
58:26 - gonna say it's for any kind of like
58:27 - drawing or animation but you might want
58:29 - to I'm gonna say new canvas no campus no
58:37 - it's like oh that's very not very nice I
58:39 - like say yes whenever possible I like to
58:42 - say yes if you can say yes say yes what
58:45 - is this crazy do you guys see what's
58:46 - going on here the like there's some kind
58:49 - of like goes to the Machine like that's
58:52 - really weird what is going on okay I'm
58:55 - just gonna live with that I'm gonna live
58:57 - with the weird flickering maybe somebody
58:58 - can tell me what it is another oh whoa I
59:02 - can't live with it anymore - timeout
59:12 - what is going on I'm gonna quit Adam
59:14 - this is okay so we're gonna edit this
59:15 - out I guess that's why and I might I'll
59:22 - just move to sublime people or time use
59:23 - a visual studio I don't know I I just
59:25 - haven't use it before what everyone says
59:26 - they love it let's open this back up and
59:33 - Adams not open well I'm just gonna give
59:35 - it a quick try and if Adam breaks it
59:39 - should actually reopen it oh wow it like
59:45 - deleted what I had what did I have
59:56 - this is what I had right okay oh it's
60:00 - doing it again what is it doing
60:07 - whoa is it my is it my computer and
60:12 - keyboard is it Adam let's not use Adam
60:16 - let's switch over to sublime once again
60:25 - nothing there
60:36 - what do they have no canvas oh it's not
60:42 - doing my Auto well it's fine I'm gonna
60:45 - have to live with this
60:54 - houses font-size okay you know I like
61:02 - whenever possible I like to use
61:03 - something that's open source and free
61:05 - and sublime is you can use it for free
61:07 - it's I do actually have purchased a
61:08 - license to sublime remember I purchased
61:11 - it or I have a license to purchase from
61:12 - NYU I think I purchased one like a long
61:14 - time ago but I probably don't have it on
61:17 - this computer so it's probably going to
61:22 - they're gonna like yell at me and saying
61:24 - it to pay for a visual studio code is
61:26 - also open source says Nick Nick okay
61:30 - all right edit point over I'm back and
61:35 - using sublime text because there was a
61:38 - monster in my computer a little mouse or
61:41 - something running around and doing
61:43 - something with Adam so I'll come back to
61:44 - Adam another time but we've got to get
61:45 - this code written so I'm gonna go back
61:47 - here and run this and we can see things
61:49 - are still going it's hard for me to
61:53 - scratch my ear I'm doing it okay so now
61:57 - what what do I need to do so the first
61:59 - thing I need to do is I need to get
62:01 - whatever the user enters so I need to
62:06 - have access to when the user hits the
62:08 - button and then I need to have access to
62:11 - what's in the text input when the user
62:12 - hits the button I'm gonna do something a
62:14 - little bit weird this is gonna be weird
62:16 - oh wait didn't it didn't syntax
62:20 - highlight that for me no no I can't go
62:24 - on my iPad battery died
62:31 - it's not gonna syntax highlight for me
62:33 - the new es6 feature I'm gonna use I
62:35 - cannot I cannot I cannot do it
62:44 - people are people are saying all sorts
62:46 - of things okay so my phone is ringing
62:56 - people like Visual Studio there's like
62:59 - totally a ghost in the computer here
63:00 - hold on what serenity now with deeds
63:12 - it's also getting really hot in here
63:16 - Visual Studio should we go for it
63:24 - download Visual Studio for Mac what do I
63:26 - want I just want community right oh wait
63:31 - no no this looks too fancy for me rich
63:38 - IDE advanced I don't want that search
63:43 - versus code Visual Studio code thank you
63:48 - so this is what I want let's try this
64:15 - liking it so far
64:26 - oh it looks pretty open desktop acrostic
64:33 - I don't want to get rid of the welcome
64:39 - sketch touch a yes will that is tiny
64:42 - oh no how can I increase that's making
64:49 - it bigger but I don't want this really
64:50 - to be bigger how do I increase the font
64:54 - size here editor font size there we go
65:00 - 24 let's try that oh do I need to edit
65:10 - no do I need to put it in here oh yeah
65:14 - editor font size yeah little little
65:20 - extra 24 this needs a comma probably
65:28 - there we go and then let's change the
65:32 - zoom level to 1 and then so this looks
65:37 - good that looks kind of small so let's
65:46 - go to 48 it's double it way too big
65:52 - apparently I don't have any intuition
65:53 - for font sizes
66:00 - how's that still a little big 32 well
66:04 - they just 32 28 okay this good well now
66:09 - it looks kind of small it's fine yeah
66:15 - okay okay I think I'm ready now
66:26 - and what's it doing here
66:35 - does it like know something why is my
66:43 - browser going crazy okay there we go
66:50 - all right huh anybody actually still
66:56 - here oh my god this is how does that
67:06 - okay so can I just get a quick reality
67:12 - check on this font size how does the
67:14 - font size look a little bit bigger I
67:17 - kind of want to make it a little bigger
67:19 - please especially in the patron group in
67:22 - the slack channel if you could let me
67:23 - know you had the icon in the top left
67:25 - clicked okay okay fine font is fine fine
67:30 - fine ever it's it's fine okay
67:32 - okay so Adam was going crazy I am now
67:35 - trying for the first time ever Visual
67:37 - Studio code which is an open source code
67:39 - editor I think by from Microsoft anyway
67:42 - you could look that up on your own I'm
67:43 - gonna give that a try and save this file
67:45 - I'm gonna hit and things are still
67:47 - working so what do I need to do I first
67:49 - need to get access to when a user clicks
67:52 - the button and when they click the
67:54 - button
67:54 - what word they've typed in okay so what
67:57 - is that okay I'm gonna do something
68:00 - really crazy for the first time ever on
68:02 - my youtube channel net button equals
68:07 - select submit so there's a couple things
68:11 - now I made a video
68:14 - tutorial about this new keyword in
68:17 - JavaScript yes six version of JavaScript
68:20 - called let I'll summarize it for you
68:21 - instead of far type left now I'll get
68:24 - I'm gonna make another video which I
68:25 - will put a link to in the description of
68:26 - this video when I make it to talk about
68:28 - what is let and why much you use instead
68:31 - of bar but right now let is bar bar is
68:32 - let far as let let this bar bars let let
68:35 - the smart
68:35 - okay but what I'm doing is I want to
68:37 - select that's a mid button now this is a
68:41 - hash our pound submit means I need that
68:44 - submit button to actually have an ID
68:49 - submit and I want the input to have an
68:53 - idea call that word let me just call it
68:55 - a word input and I'm gonna call this
69:02 - submit button just to be overly verbose
69:04 - so now I'm gonna select submit button
69:08 - and I'm gonna say let input equals
69:14 - select there's so much autocomplete bug
69:18 - not in this text there's word input I
69:21 - might have to turn that off at some
69:22 - point but okay so now I have my two
69:24 - elements that are on the HTML page that
69:26 - I can start to get information from for
69:28 - example when I press the button on the
69:32 - mouse I want to make an acrostic so I'm
69:37 - gonna write a function make a cross make
69:40 - make acrostic so this here in case
69:44 - you're wondering when I this is p5.js
69:47 - sent a function in p5 stages it's yes
69:50 - when I press the mouse on the button
69:51 - call the function make acrostic here's
69:53 - the function make acrostic the first
69:55 - thing I just want to do is say let word
69:58 - equals word input dot value there we go
70:02 - so I am getting whatever somebody typed
70:05 - in and I'm going to console dot log word
70:09 - now I'm gonna hit refresh and here we go
70:12 - oh my sound effect board died that's my
70:15 - rainbow submit o word input dot value is
70:21 - not a function hmm so what did I get
70:24 - wrong select
70:28 - word ah I called my variable input and
70:32 - the ID was word input so that's just
70:35 - supposed to be input there's a mistake
70:37 - that I made good for me I'm gonna type
70:42 - in rainbow again hit submit and there we
70:45 - go and now what they going to do to make
70:47 - development a little bit easier is I'm
70:49 - just going to in the HTML I'm going to
70:52 - say a value equals rainbow so that way
70:56 - when I load the page up it actually just
71:00 - fills in rainbow for me and I'm going to
71:03 - do something else when I load the page
71:05 - up I'm actually just going to call the
71:08 - function make acrostics I don't even
71:10 - have to my arms are still sore it's a
71:13 - long story
71:13 - probably other videos about that but
71:15 - that's why I don't have to press the
71:16 - button every time I load the page I
71:18 - could just hit refresh and it's running
71:21 - that acrostic function so now we're set
71:23 - up but now comes the actual harder part
71:27 - what I need to do is look at the each
71:29 - letter one at a time and start a new
71:32 - line of a poem with that letter so how
71:35 - do I iterate over each character of a
71:38 - string that's not so not something I
71:41 - could definitely manage a VAR oh no no
71:43 - no call the emergency es6 train for nut
71:51 - i equals zero I is less than word dot
71:55 - length i plus plus now I'm going to say
72:00 - mm what should I do
72:02 - let's make a div for each one I don't
72:04 - know there's lots of different ways I
72:07 - could think about creating each line I'm
72:09 - gonna just do it as a div creative word
72:12 - car at O so word yeah car at I so now if
72:21 - I do this we can see there is a good
72:24 - circle I can move this over here so I'm
72:25 - not standing in front of it there is the
72:27 - beginning is my acrostic rainbow if I
72:31 - type in mango mango mango so really all
72:37 - I've done so far is have a text input
72:39 - field of button
72:41 - I could then look at each letter one at
72:43 - a time and put them on a separate line
72:45 - because each one is a separate div okay
72:49 - now I'm gonna have to be a little bit
72:50 - clever probably about how I organized
72:52 - these lines and all that sort of thing
72:53 - but now here's what I want to do instead
72:56 - of just putting the letter what I want
72:59 - to do is go and make write a line of
73:03 - poetry that starts with that letter and
73:05 - again instead of a line of poetry I'm
73:07 - just gonna have one word that starts
73:08 - with that letter so how do I get a word
73:10 - that starts with that letter
73:11 - well there's any number of ways I could
73:14 - do that I could try it out write some
73:15 - algorithm to make up a word I could load
73:16 - a text file and sort all the words in
73:18 - that text file in some kind of
73:21 - associative array dictionary JavaScript
73:23 - object thing that keeps track of every
73:25 - word by letter and I've done that in
73:26 - other videos and that actually would be
73:28 - a good you should try that I'm gonna use
73:30 - the word Nick API word Nick is a API
73:35 - application programming interface a
73:37 - thing that your application can
73:38 - interface with via programming that's
73:41 - one way to think about it that has a lot
73:43 - of information about words it's like a
73:45 - big dictionary with lots of information
73:46 - that words and I can if I go to develop
73:49 - or word Nick comm and I go to Doc's I
73:52 - can start to look at what are some of
73:53 - the things that I can ask word Nick one
73:56 - of the things that I can ask word Nick
73:58 - is give me sub words and one of the ways
74:03 - I can ask for some words is by searching
74:06 - and one of the ways I can search is by
74:09 - search any words that start with a
74:11 - certain letter so I'm going to ask for
74:14 - words start with the letter R I'm going
74:18 - to I could say like only now so things
74:21 - could be interesting there this is
74:24 - interesting corpus count corpus count is
74:27 - a part of the word Nick API where to
74:29 - keeps this big corpus of lots of I think
74:31 - articles and books and things I could
74:34 - say well how common is the word likethe
74:36 - would have a really high corpus count
74:39 - but fractional would have a lower corpus
74:46 - cowboy I really can't think of anything
74:47 - so I kind of actually want to have rare
74:49 - words I think it'll be more interesting
74:51 - so I'm gonna say someone a corpus count
74:52 - between one and
74:54 - five dictionaries maybe a little bit
74:56 - different I don't have to read the
74:57 - documentation and minimum length let's
75:00 - not get one letter words let's at least
75:02 - have a six letter word and no maximum
75:05 - length and I don't really need to get
75:08 - ten words I'll just take whatever is
75:10 - first and I'm gonna now click try it out
75:13 - and I can see here I've got for our
75:17 - reiterate I don't know why it gave me a
75:20 - first search result with the letter R
75:22 - now if I do it again it doesn't seem to
75:26 - be random actually so maybe I do
75:29 - actually want giving it to me in some
75:31 - order or maybe they're just so let me
75:33 - ask for ten and now I can get a bunch so
75:36 - I think I'm going to ask for a bunch and
75:38 - pick one randomly reproval rattlin
75:40 - road-book rootage red beets these are
75:44 - some great words and I can also by the
75:47 - way start to do all sorts of things like
75:49 - then ask word Nik for a sentence that
75:51 - uses that word and information about the
75:53 - etymology of that word probably but I'm
75:54 - gonna leave that again those are
75:56 - exercises that you could use to further
75:58 - expand on this so how do I actually get
76:01 - this well look this request URL and I
76:04 - have a whole set of video tutorials
76:05 - about working with api's and request
76:07 - URLs and how you do this you can go back
76:09 - and review those I'll link to that in
76:11 - this video's description but all we need
76:12 - to know for this video is this request
76:14 - URL I'm gonna grab it I am going to copy
76:18 - it and I'm going to put it in my code I
76:21 - am going to say let URL equal this and I
76:27 - think it's wrapping the text so we're
76:30 - looking at this but the thing is I
76:31 - actually don't want it this is the thing
76:33 - that I want to change I want to make
76:36 - this same request but for different
76:37 - letters I'm gonna do something kind of
76:39 - silly let url 1 equal all the stuff in
76:44 - this URL up to here and then I'm going
76:47 - to say let URL to equal all the rest of
76:51 - it and by the way I need an API key so I
76:56 - really should go and sign up for an API
76:59 - key and I have one and I might pause
77:01 - this and at this video in a second to
77:03 - put what a working one in there but when
77:05 - I used
77:06 - word mix website it gave me a temporary
77:08 - API key just so I could like play around
77:10 - and learn how to use it so I'm gonna see
77:12 - if that still works so this is now the
77:15 - second part of the URL and so now when I
77:19 - make for each one of these what I need
77:22 - to do whoo oh boy there's gonna be some
77:24 - tricky stuff here always tricky stuff
77:26 - let's just let's take a break from this
77:30 - algorithm for a second and just at the
77:31 - beginning let's say load JSON so load
77:38 - JSON is a function that allows me to
77:41 - load some data from a API call a URL and
77:46 - I'm going to load the first half of the
77:50 - URL plus the letter R plus the second
77:55 - half of the URL I'm just going you are
77:56 - now because what I want to do is this
77:58 - needs to eventually become dynamic like
78:00 - I need to get different letters yes okay
78:11 - okay okay let's edit that out perhaps so
78:16 - then when I load the data from the API I
78:20 - need to write a callback function to
78:22 - tell me when that's ready so I'm gonna
78:24 - write this function I'm gonna say data
78:27 - got data okay so now I'm gonna say got
78:32 - data and what I'm going to do with is
78:35 - I'm gonna write a function I'm gonna
78:38 - call it got data I'm gonna get some data
78:41 - and I'm just gonna say console log data
78:44 - so I just want to see now that this
78:46 - works with word mnek it's gonna go back
78:50 - to here and I'm gonna hit refresh oh I
78:53 - have an error sketch digest lying to
78:57 - what's wrong here oh there's like an
78:59 - extra R here for no reason
79:03 - okay look total results 2308 search
79:09 - results here all the words are I don't
79:11 - know why R is 1 I guess it always gives
79:13 - you that first re-entry red-lit and
79:15 - great so I got that and I got 10
79:18 - there are two thousand three hundred and
79:20 - eight possibilities so I should probably
79:22 - maybe I shouldn't give it a limit if I
79:25 - take the limit out maybe I'll just get
79:28 - all of them and I can pick a random one
79:30 - there might be a better way to do this
79:31 - there's probably a way for me to ask for
79:33 - a random one through the the way I form
79:36 - the query but let's do this anyway so
79:41 - now I got it soul only gave me ten I
79:44 - wonder if 10 is the maximum but I'll
79:47 - come back to that later maybe somebody
79:49 - in the chat will will tell me how to do
79:51 - this later I'm just going to get 10 and
79:53 - pick a random one okay so we know that
79:55 - works how's the thing I need to do this
79:59 - I need to do this load the JSON for
80:03 - every letter what is every letter it is
80:13 - var oh god oh no mark let letter equal
80:18 - word car at I create a div with that
80:23 - letter pause so I'm somebody you skip in
80:33 - the URL skip the first one the single
80:35 - letter that's a good idea and I could
80:37 - also use skip to a move to a different
80:38 - point but I don't know that I'd have to
80:40 - ask for the total first which is kind of
80:41 - overly complicated create ok I'm back
80:47 - then I want to create a div with that
80:51 - letter and then I want to load the JSON
80:53 - instead up the hard-coded R value
80:55 - don't want to load the JSON with the
80:57 - letter so let's see how this goes and
81:00 - let's be a little let's be simpler here
81:03 - let's go to index of HTML and let's have
81:05 - it just do it for Bo Bo W let's just use
81:08 - it to it for 3 letters so look at this I
81:12 - got results now here's the thing did I
81:15 - get them in the order bo w this one is o
81:23 - so I got o first then I got W and ice
81:29 - can only assume the last one is
81:31 - be so here's the thing this is really
81:34 - key when working with api's and making
81:37 - multiple API calls everything in Java is
81:40 - asynchronous meaning you don't your the
81:43 - code is going to execute at some point
81:45 - later whenever the API has happened to
81:47 - return and that could happen in any
81:48 - given order no matter what order your
81:50 - ask for things in so I could do
81:52 - something where I asked for them ask for
81:55 - B and only when I get the results back
81:57 - then ask for o and only when I get the
81:59 - results at back then ask for W that's
82:01 - one option another option which I think
82:04 - I might like better is to instead keep
82:09 - track of what I'm asking for when it
82:11 - comes back just check what it was and
82:13 - then use that so this I think is what
82:15 - I'm gonna do
82:17 - oh and somebody in the chat is now
82:21 - telling me by the way so let's fix this
82:24 - that put the limit back I don't know
82:30 - where I guess I could put that anywhere
82:31 - so I'm gonna put it here and make the
82:34 - limit equal to negative one so if I make
82:37 - the limit equal to negative one maybe
82:39 - I'll get everything let's see I Scott
82:45 - still only got eleven I think it may be
82:47 - it just maxes out at that whatever edit
82:50 - that out maybe I did that wrong we'll
82:58 - just edit that out of the final video
82:59 - thing since that didn't work Simon is
83:03 - suggesting that I call it data received
83:05 - I like shorter name Scott data is a bit
83:07 - of a I can see how that can be a problem
83:09 - though oh look at this why did I what
83:12 - just happened here did I hit undo weird
83:17 - must've hit undo by accident maybe I
83:21 - didn't hold on a sec anyway I've been up
83:25 - ten seems to me max I'm not gonna worry
83:27 - about it to get rid of the first letter
83:29 - makes skip equal one alright actually
83:34 - one thing I should add to this is say
83:37 - skip equals one because what we note I
83:40 - noticed you that and thank you to the
83:41 - chat for helping with this word nick is
83:43 - always returning just the
83:44 - the letters the first result which I
83:46 - might actually want to use to know which
83:48 - one came back but whatever I'm gonna put
83:50 - skip equal one so that I don't get it
83:51 - right now okay so now here's the thing
83:56 - let's make sure this still works
83:58 - okay got three results bo w now what I
84:03 - need to do is I want to keep track of
84:07 - this particular div so if I make this
84:10 - div let div equals create div then what
84:16 - I want to do is when this comes back I
84:20 - want to feed in the got data function
84:24 - which is up here and I'm gonna move this
84:25 - down now I'm gonna move this and just
84:29 - put it here so I can see it more clearly
84:31 - I want got data to know about this
84:35 - particular div and somehow say like div
84:37 - HTML and then uh you know something so I
84:41 - have to something out of the data
84:43 - so first let's get the date got data
84:45 - function to pick a random word so if I
84:48 - look at the actual data it's in a
84:51 - property called search results and it is
84:54 - a that's an array and I need to pick a
84:57 - random one so I'm gonna say VAR options
85:00 - equals data search results let let this
85:07 - is really really hard habit to break
85:08 - then I'm gonna say var let word equals
85:15 - random options so something nice that p5
85:18 - does for you is with the random function
85:20 - you can pass it an array and I'll just
85:22 - pick a random one out of it and then
85:23 - console dot log word so now if I hit
85:26 - refresh here mmm interesting I didn't do
85:34 - that crow okay word okay so it's picking
85:37 - that is not an array of words it's an
85:40 - array of object each object has three
85:42 - properties one of which is actually the
85:44 - work the property of words so I'm gonna
85:46 - call this a selection and then let and
85:50 - then I'm going to say console.log
85:51 - selection dot word so now when i refresh
85:54 - this I get three words let's get rid of
85:57 - it's saying we don't need console dot
86:01 - log acrostic and it's confusing that
86:03 - it's console logging bow let's get rid
86:06 - of that so I'm getting wob I should get
86:10 - three different words each time some
86:12 - really interesting weird words that I've
86:13 - never heard of before okay
86:15 - oblige event wolf tap barely okay so now
86:20 - we've got our words but I want those
86:23 - words to know which did to go into so
86:27 - they go in the right order and then
86:28 - eventually we want to highlight the
86:29 - character and I you might need spans who
86:31 - knows what I'm gonna need but let's
86:32 - let's try this okay but I really haven't
86:38 - coded for like two months this is crazy
86:39 - okay I think what I need is a closure so
86:44 - what I want to do is I'm gonna say pick
86:47 - word and I'm gonna say div and then I'm
86:52 - gonna pass it the URL so I'm gonna write
86:54 - a separate function called pick word and
86:58 - I'm gonna pass that function the div and
87:01 - the URL which sort of lets me pair those
87:04 - two things together and they can always
87:06 - live together so that when the URL gets
87:09 - back gives back data it can go with the
87:11 - div bear with me and I have a couple
87:13 - videos about closures and doing this
87:15 - I'll reference those in this video's
87:16 - description so now I can take this load
87:19 - I can basically rename I could write a
87:21 - new function called pick word and what
87:27 - does it need it needs a div and maybe
87:31 - that shouldn't be added should be like
87:32 - an element it I might not need to be a
87:33 - div later and it needs a URL so now I
87:38 - can what I can do how do i okay timeout
87:41 - how do I Auto format in Visual Studio
87:47 - right the ride spirals is making a good
87:50 - point in the chat that just passed the
87:52 - letter and let the URL work out here
87:53 - that's a good point I'm gonna make that
87:55 - correction does anybody know yeah I also
87:59 - could look at the first letter of the
88:00 - word that comes back but does anybody
88:02 - know how I oughta format in Visual
88:04 - Studio alt
88:13 - maybe I actually that's not working ctrl
88:16 - shift F do I have to like select it
88:19 - that did it okay whatever all right
88:23 - a great comment came from the chat which
88:28 - it probably makes more sense for this
88:30 - pic word function actually to include
88:33 - the letter to just receive the letter
88:35 - and have this work of the URL formation
88:40 - happen in the pic word function so I'm
88:42 - going to change that and then I'm gonna
88:44 - say let URL equal this and then I'm
88:48 - gonna say load JSON from the URL got
88:53 - data this is what I had before however
88:57 - what's new now is that the callback is
89:01 - enclosed is in a closure is enclosed
89:03 - inside this outer function so that
89:05 - instead of console logging selection dot
89:08 - word I can say div dot HTML it's that
89:12 - specific div that came into the picard
89:14 - function div dot HTML selection word so
89:20 - now here we go Val neo obscene or
89:24 - whimsical this breckel spores whimsical
89:28 - miss and I can try doing rainbow oops oh
89:32 - wait a second ah Oh No Oh interesting
89:35 - ooh I love that what's kind of fun about
89:37 - that is it was sort of accidental let's
89:39 - take out now the thing that does it
89:41 - automatically so I don't want to like
89:43 - have it do it automatically and it's
89:46 - kind of interesting to do it with a
89:47 - longer word so let's go back to my hold
89:51 - on I lost my here we go let's go back to
89:56 - putting in rainbow here now I actually
90:01 - have to submit take a look here do you
90:04 - see how it filled it in slowly because
90:05 - all those are having asynchronously it
90:07 - put me those letters there immediately
90:09 - now if I didn't want it to do that I
90:11 - could actually just create those divs as
90:16 - empty so I could create an empty div
90:21 - with no content
90:23 - so then I might see them fill in but I
90:26 - wouldn't see them fill in I mean you
90:28 - know I could retrieve I there's so many
90:30 - ways I could animate this or do it
90:31 - differently so here's the thing this is
90:34 - my acrostic coding challenge finished
90:37 - we're gonna read this poem road-book i
90:40 - gret is prop nick knocked it blue compa
90:43 - Diceman Obachan wire rod here's what I
90:46 - would like any of you who are watching
90:48 - or interested to try to do share with me
90:50 - at Schiffman on twitter in the comments
90:52 - next time I do a live stream I'll share
90:54 - some of your results this code will get
90:56 - posted looking visitorship for the code
90:58 - but a couple things do this so that the
91:00 - first letter is highlighted how can you
91:03 - make the first letter bold or
91:04 - capitalized and highlight it in some way
91:06 - how could you make this more poetic so
91:09 - that you get a full sentence here and it
91:10 - reads more like a poem and another thing
91:12 - you might think of as what if the
91:14 - acrostic isn't so simple and I'm gonna
91:16 - just Google acrostic for a second
91:19 - because I know an example will come up
91:21 - if I do this images maybe where the the
91:28 - letters don't necessarily have to be the
91:29 - first letter so how were you create
91:31 - something and line it up like this and I
91:33 - could always come back and do a part two
91:35 - to this coding challenge if people are
91:36 - really interested but I'm gonna leave
91:38 - yeah I think I better close this window
91:39 - before I get something I don't want to
91:41 - see but this is the basic idea
91:44 - I get user input a word I know when the
91:47 - users hit the button I look at each
91:49 - letter individually I go out to an API
91:52 - but I could have used other data sources
91:54 - look up my Markov chain stuff to
91:56 - generate a context-free grammar maybe
91:58 - parts of speech tagging read attach as
92:01 - tutorials are lots of other my
92:02 - programming with text tutorials to think
92:04 - about ways you can make this more poetic
92:06 - visualize it in a different way and that
92:08 - sort of thing I'm being told them to
92:10 - chat that maybe the max limit for the
92:12 - word Nick API is 125 oh and there's a
92:15 - bug when I hit submit multiple times
92:16 - it's not really a bug it just does it
92:18 - again so that's something you could fix
92:20 - you can have it erase went there before
92:22 - or put a nice break in between them or
92:24 - something like that okay thank you very
92:27 - much
92:28 - I this is going to be irrelevant in the
92:30 - future when we're all just like brains
92:32 - floating in some sort of goo but this
92:35 - has been the first coding challenge I've
92:36 - done after all
92:37 - one time after I had a broken elbow
92:39 - accident and it's great to be back thank
92:41 - you for watching so I probably was a
92:43 - little off my game here if you're
92:44 - actually still watching this and thank
92:46 - you and I appreciate it
92:48 - see you on the next coding train alright
92:53 - everyone I did it I did a livestream
92:57 - I got Wirecast to work again I made a
93:00 - coding challenge it's not my favorite
93:02 - probably did my best
93:04 - let me see if I can at least yes Simon
93:07 - Tiger is is so the IDS of the divs and
93:12 - all of that
93:13 - definitely oh look my I'm trying to get
93:15 - my iPad music thing to come back so it's
93:18 - almost 7 o'clock this was not a very
93:21 - long livestream because there was an
93:23 - hour and a half of me with technical
93:24 - difficulties but I have been up here for
93:27 - three hours
93:29 - and it's been a long week let me since a
93:33 - lot of you probably weren't here at the
93:34 - beginning I want to mention a couple
93:36 - things I want to mention again date
93:40 - processing org if you ever go back and
93:42 - watch this whole livestream I talked
93:44 - about in a bit at the beginning I'm
93:45 - gonna be there doing a live in-person
93:46 - coding train episode I don't know what
93:49 - that means exactly and I also want to
93:51 - mention once again if you are a high
93:53 - school student or know of a high school
93:55 - student or friends with a high school
93:57 - student or have a child who's a high
94:00 - school students or an older sibling who
94:02 - is a high school student
94:03 - check out ITP NYU edu slash ima this is
94:08 - a new program starting at NYU where I
94:11 - teach called interactive media arts
94:13 - there's going to be a Facebook live
94:14 - stream about it where you can ask
94:15 - questions on Monday and you can tweet me
94:19 - at Schiffman if you have questions about
94:20 - and up put you in touch you can also
94:22 - tweet at ITP underscore actually you can
94:25 - tweet at ima underscore NYU so what I
94:30 - would love is anybody's interested go to
94:33 - the Facebook live tweeted ima underscore
94:35 - NYU and say you heard about ima through
94:38 - the coding train that'll make me really
94:39 - happy it makes me like I'm doing a good
94:41 - job here at my job at your University
94:46 - okay so treats for those of you who are
94:49 - still here at the end
94:51 - let's see here oh okay I need to make
94:54 - bear with me for a second
95:01 - okay I was just trying to do something
95:05 - as like an extra thing at the end I was
95:09 - quick to say one of the things I'm
95:11 - interested in so I'm doing physical
95:12 - therapy with this elbow and the thing
95:15 - that I'm doing is getting range of
95:16 - motion back so you can see and I'm
95:18 - actually pretty tight right now if I use
95:20 - a heating pad and do a lot of stretching
95:22 - I will get quite a bit further I'm gonna
95:25 - be doing this for the next few months
95:26 - one of the things that I hate that you
95:28 - do at the physical therapy office is I
95:33 - can't tell if things are working I'm
95:35 - gonna just go to the slack Channel is
95:37 - that they measure so one of the things I
95:40 - was thinking about is developing a
95:41 - physical therapy application that
95:43 - measures the angle I don't know if this
95:45 - is useful or not if you could do
95:46 - something with an accelerometer probably
95:48 - but with computer vision so but just
95:51 - record a short video of me stretching my
95:54 - arm and since I have the sleeve on it
96:00 - it's high contrast you could probably
96:03 - use computer vision to calculate this
96:06 - angle of the elbow and the same thing
96:09 - you know for going out this would be you
96:13 - know this is zero degrees and this is
96:15 - it's probably like 25 degrees right now
96:18 - I can get it to 15 with stretching I
96:20 - have this like device that I can where
96:22 - it can be able to sleep it yet but it's
96:24 - a device that stretches out your arm
96:25 - you're supposed to sleep in it I don't
96:26 - know how to do that anyway so if anybody
96:28 - wants to capture these and think about
96:30 - like collaborating working a little
96:31 - open-source tool to connect to something
96:33 - computer vision I don't know if there's
96:35 - a better idea so that's one thing I was
96:36 - going to mention and if anyone wants to
96:40 - see my exciting scar I don't think
96:43 - there's any a trigger warning or being
96:44 - like squeamish here but you probably
96:46 - can't even really see that so there's my
96:47 - excited scar where I had a nice incision
96:49 - I thought I said I would show that at
96:50 - the end some people asked I do have some
96:53 - really interesting photos of me with 32
96:55 - staples in my arm and all sorts of
96:58 - swollen stuff if you're really
96:59 - interested in that okay so that was my
97:01 - extra thing at the end I
97:08 - happy to take one or two questions
97:10 - before I go did this iPad come back I'm
97:16 - gonna get my not now
97:19 - put on my goodbye song thank you for
97:26 - tuning in if you're interested in
97:28 - supporting this YouTube job I've had the
97:30 - patreon on cause I haven't charged
97:32 - anybody for the patreon all of July and
97:34 - all of August which I guess is actually
97:36 - all of August in all of September but on
97:38 - October 1st assuming I keep this up this
97:40 - month and get back to the machine
97:41 - learning stuff if you would like to join
97:44 - the coding trains patron group and slack
97:46 - channel patreon.com slash coding
97:49 - training what else
97:54 - support the processing foundation
97:56 - processing foundation org
97:58 - if you're interested in this new
98:00 - undergrad there's a graduate program by
98:02 - the way you called ITP that's been
98:04 - around for close to 40 years but this is
98:07 - a new program called ima Frank is asking
98:09 - are you back on a regular schedule my
98:12 - plan is to be back on a regular schedule
98:14 - every Friday
98:16 - right now I'm targeting 4:00 p.m.
98:18 - Eastern Time every Friday I might do
98:21 - earlier to at least sometime on Friday
98:23 - I'd love to have a regular timeslot
98:25 - there will be I can think of two Fridays
98:26 - that I'll miss over the next few months
98:28 - but at least hopefully extra Friday okay
98:31 - have you also learned in school how to
98:34 - hello I don't know
98:35 - please paint your bad day Green's that
98:37 - we see a floating hand so this is
98:38 - actually what's called a compression
98:40 - sleeve you don't need to wear it but
98:41 - it's fabric and it helps with the
98:43 - swelling because it's an elastic fabric
98:45 - it just sort of somehow psychologically
98:46 - makes me feel a little bit more
98:48 - comfortable do you think we live in a
98:53 - computer matrix maybe
98:59 - thank you guys I also will just say
99:02 - thank you to everyone for I have so many
99:04 - well wishes and kind words I have not
99:06 - applied to a single youtube comment in
99:10 - like two months I do kind of read them
99:11 - all I'm kind of really out of the habit
99:13 - of that but definitely um some of you
99:15 - note that Schiffman on twitter if you
99:17 - want to get in touch I'll mention that
99:19 - at the coding train if you have
99:21 - questions about logistics and customer
99:24 - service you know what that means
99:25 - but Matt Blanchette who does a lot of
99:28 - work doing video editing and other type
99:30 - of stuff for the channel I guess super
99:32 - calm like the channel manager is now has
99:35 - the keys to the coding train twitter
99:37 - account so you can follow that maybe
99:38 - some more stuff will happen to that
99:39 - account and I don't want to promise
99:42 - anything too much and I maybe I should
99:45 - do I dare hold on I have a little treat
99:49 - if you're still watching is anybody
99:52 - really still watching the thing is I
99:54 - need to somehow acquire this okay I'm
99:57 - gonna switch for a second cuz I've got
99:59 - to go like into my email I don't want
100:02 - you to see my email I will be soon
100:04 - releasing a new music video for the
100:08 - coding train and I'm going to show you
100:11 - like four seconds of it but I have to
100:14 - get into my email which you cannot see
100:18 - right now because you're just seeing the
100:19 - green screen no I'm reading my email
100:23 - which is very stressful don't look at my
100:26 - email here it is this is a little sneak
100:35 - preview yeah I could I'm going to have
100:43 - to close out my email before I come back
100:44 - to the screen this is the last thing I'm
100:46 - gonna do for those of you who really
100:48 - stayed through all of this people are
100:52 - messing with me and saying that they're
100:54 - seeing my email but that's just trolling
100:55 - right okay
100:59 - because then I'm gonna have to like do
101:02 - all sorts of annoying things somebody in
101:05 - the slack channel who please tell me
101:08 - that I did this correctly I no one's
101:09 - seeing my email
101:13 - okay great um so now I am going to go
101:17 - back to here and I'm going to show you a
101:25 - short video snippet from the upcoming
101:28 - coding train video that's all there is
101:36 - that's a little sneak preview that's for
101:38 - all of you who are so kind to be here
101:40 - waiting through all that technical stuff
101:42 - thank you very much and I will that
101:48 - video will come out you know I don't
101:49 - wanna make any promises but you know
101:50 - possibly I would say certainly by the
101:52 - end hopefully by the end of the month so
101:53 - stay tuned thanks for tuning in I can't
101:57 - believe that I'm actually gonna have
101:58 - some new content that traffic on my
101:59 - channel is just going like you know so
102:04 - hopefully there's only gonna be one new
102:05 - coding challenge out but I'll be back
102:07 - next Friday thanks for watching the
102:10 - coding train and I will see you soon

Cleaned transcript:

hello I'm really out of practice with it it's me mostly working subin formed band shipment person things here live on Fridays every Friday although I haven't been here since sometime before June 27 I am seeing some comments in the chat saying audio good video good I'm going to lower my background music let's Tori the dog by Adam Blau and so playing in the background I'm here I'm back I'm seeing a chat going I I don't even know what to say let's see so what's going on here thank you for tuning in my name is Dan I forgot how to pronounce my last name it's something like Schiffman and I attempt when I'm not falling off of a bicycle to be here once a week every Friday doing some creative coding fun times on the Internet now I don't want to I could easily by accident spend the next two hours talking about all of the different exciting and intriguing and fascinating medical experiences I've been through in the last two months I think I will come back if anybody is actually interested in some of that stuff just to kind of like fill in some of those gaps maybe towards the end of the livestream I can answer some questions to just talk about what's going on I am wearing a compression sleeve there's no cast here my elbow does move I did break my elbow I did also break this wrist but I I also had my funny bone removed or actually moved so this is important because I don't know that I was ever any funny at all but something might be off so there is no funny bone you might actually know it's not a bone it's something called the older nerve which is a nerve that passes around the back of your elbow and it can get aggravated or entrapped and this is what happened to me after the accident as a separate complication where I lost now see I'm doing it I'm talking about the whole thing but I think I lost complete feeling in these two fingers and use of this and so anyway my older nerve was moved from here now to here so I can like get the funny bone sensation oh that actually worked if I tap right there it's really weird okay I can also do the robot very well because I don't have full range of motion yeah if I'm doing a lot of physical therapy I will come back to and answer questions about this huh okay this is not a medical stream why levae who is in the chat okay wait where's my water I'm a little bit late because I don't have any coffee or any tea today I usually the other thing is I'm very weak but I can open this so I did teach three classes this week live in person here at New York University that gave me the confidence to come back and I am now making a commitment to be here every Friday there will be some Fridays that I will miss so actually one of the first things I want to mention ads are coming up in this computer I have a lot of things that I want to talk about a lot being too maybe more than that but one of the things I want to just start with is I'm saying I'm gonna be here every Friday I haven't said a runner time it's so important you know any when you like read things about how'd it be a content creator and to that what's the year 2017 you know you must establish you know build an audience how do you market but I blah blah blah blah or not a drink of this stuff but I am told it's really good to establish a regular weekly time of which I have never been able to do in the last I think have I been doing this two years I think so will soar here okay I can't do this it's very uncomfortable okay okay okay so I'm doing the thing where I say okay okay all the time again anyway there's a lot of people here I'm being told I'm gonna just check it's a little bit vain for me to check but I'm a little bit curious no yeah okay Mon this computer in my I have to turn the audio off on this computer and I can't see how many people here oh there's 500 people here that's a great number that's perfectly but though that's a regular perfectly reasonable normal number okay I got to go back here to this chat alright so I would like to establish a regular time and if I go to twitter.com slash Schiffman I put up recently a poll I thought oh yeah here we go so if you this is the link to it so if you want to go to straw poll com hopefully somebody can just who has privileges can paste this in the chat straw poll comm /yp III z RW see nice URL you can I'm just trying to get a sense of what's best for people but honestly I might do a different time every Friday so just stay tuned Friday morning I'll usually post the time or I'll tweet about it on Thursday if you're looking for the time but it's definitely this semester is going to be Friday's I have a I could tell you about all my schedule Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday and I know once a while I like to do a surprise extra bonus livestream I had all these people lined up not all I had three or four people lined up to do guest spots in August and when I was healing and thought I would be able to come back and then I had this extra complication ahead of another surgery so that all fell apart but hopefully I'll get some of those guest spots coming in those will be other times during the week as well or just videos that will appear on your feet if they're not live streamed okay so you can come here and let's just check the results out of curiosity looks like people like the for the most part like the later time but we'll see okay so if I do every Friday there are a couple Friday's where I might not be here one of which I really want to highlight and mention really excited to tell you about something called processing Community Day this is an event for people to gather in person really for the first time processing as a project has been around since 2001 I've talked about this before started by Casey Reis and Ben fry at the MIT Media Lab in fact processing the first processing Community Day will be at the MIT Media Lab on October 21st in Boston I will be there and you can purchase a ticket if you are able to come here at this website the website is de processing gorg and when I say purchase a ticket it's very reasonably priced at and you click here at I think it's $15 but anyway you can find it yourself and some things that I want to mention about it I in theory I'm going to do it live this is live but live in person coding Train episode I don't have no idea what that's going to be Ben Frey Casey Ari Lauren McCarthy and Casey Reese will be there Eva Diaz will be there fathom information design will be there johanna head busted it harry all sorts of wonderful people you can apply to give a lightning talk if you're interested and I should mention that they enjoy who is the founder of the school for poetic one of the cofounder of the school report a computation that I've talked about that I've recorded many videos at is organizing is that is a his organ is the organiser of processing Community Day so if you I would highly encourage you to check out his medium post where he wrote about the kind of ideas behind Community Day and what it's about so I could go on and on and on about this but I wanted to mention it mention it ok any questions oh yeah whoops oh so I forgot thank you somebody I think I got to turn this off I don't know where you were to see it now if I click on here no that's send a super chat where do I look at it here okay hold on ah super chat okay Thank You Jamie Nichols so I forgot I meant to turn this off guy was sort of curious about it to u n in the chasey in the chat did that okay hold on am i back I can't tell I'm waiting for somebody to see I'm gonna I'm not gonna do anything till I know we're back okay I saw somebody say we're back okay so hopefully I don't know what's gonna happen here if this is gonna end up getting chopped up into a million I this always seems to happen whenever I'm not using the computer and stuff for a while it comes back and I the fact that it crashed just now and actually it crashed on me when I was getting set up a couple times I was just like let's not worry about I restarted the computer the fact that it crashed on me not just now I have a little bit of a worry that that's gonna do that again so if the street I'm gonna be here till live stream until uh somewhere between 530 and 600 p.m. that's Eastern time so an hour hour and a half to two hours and so if I disappear I'm not ending it until then I'll say when I'm saying goodbye so apologies for that okay so what I talked about processing Community Day and so that's one of the that that's one of the Friday's I won't be live online there's a loud drumbeat you guys can't hear that can you there's like cheering there's like a film class going on in the room right behind me here they finish at 515 it'll quiet down then okay so that's one thing I wanted to mention now I was talking about this super chat which I left on my accident I was experimenting with it but III think I probably will turn that off at some point if I can because if you're interested in supporting the work that I'm doing and the coding training again you should always first consider supporting the processing foundation and you can go to now I'm hearing feedback but hopefully that's not me now a processing foundation support alright trying again I'm now what I just did is I launched an older version of the Wirecast software one of these days I'm gonna switch to open broadcast studio there's actually a new version Wirecast to 8 maybe I'll consider getting that I really do like the Wirecast software it's worked great for me but apparently it's not working like it knows that I am like I crap now it's like I feel you're crashed pain and I am also going to in solidarity crash over and over again get my nerve compressed and open up mine anyway so so if you are interested so I was saying please consider supporting the processing foundation by being a pressing foundation member and if you also feel so inclined you can support what I'm doing here via patreon patreon comm slash the coding train there's a reason why I was mentioning that super chance oh my god okay another thing I would like to mention I teach at a program called ITP this is the ITP website ITP is a twoyear graduate program here at Tisch School of the Arts New York University in New York City guess what apparently starting in fall yeah 2018 it's like next year the undergraduate BFA version of ITP called Interactive Media Arts ima because we like that an acronym acronyms we'll be accepting its inaugural class so I will be participating in this I don't know there's a lot of information I could attempt to give you but mostly what I want to say is that if you are interested you should go to ITP NYU edu slash I am I know we have a lot of younger viewers here who are maybe in high school even and might be looking for and here is a place where you can find out information about applying and there's going to be a Facebook open house on Monday how do I find that I know let's see about apply I mean okay so I'm gonna find out information about that and whenever this video becomes published and archived later I will put a link to how you can find the Facebook live I I'm assuming it's just at like Facebook / ITP underscore ima or ima underscore NYU or something this is a terrible idea for me to try to like a Google look at that and now the camera went off see everything is just run just as poorly as it used to be I'll find that I'll find that link later somebody can find the Facebook livestream okay people are being very impatient that I'm not coding hey have you ever watched the Kotick train before and this is on the train oh not so much on the coding I guess I don't know what's the train so I will get to coding I definitely will it's oh this iPad is not charging okay all right everything's working okay so what should we do about coding today I think those were the main things that I wanted to talk about that don't have to do with coding so let's talk about what I'm a little bit out of sorts and get my water it's always important on the coding train to do your physical therapy wrist exercises elbow exercises and oh thank you Dominic force from the chat just posted ITP Facebook page and there's actually some open houses in person if you're in the New York area that come a visit okay so I was if you recall last time I was here you know the universe really does not want me to try to talk about I'm afraid to say it can I say it's just like machine learning first of all do you think this shirt is a problem like am I gonna cause YouTube compression issues which is with the shirt I think that you know the first time I mentioned machine learning on this channel the fire alarm went off and I had to evacuate the building and the second time I mentioned machine learning or no not the second time but once I got like a few machine learning videos I started on that I had this like bike accident broke my elbow and then I had to take two months off at least maybe gonna wait until next week so I if I go to my channel let me turn I'll play this off that's not going to um and I look here at like kind of recent uploads you'll see this is where this is what I was doing most recently there's some nonsense extra like videos about the bike accident or whatever but I did an introduction to neural networks I started talking about about perceptrons and multilayer perceptrons started to do a little bit of matrix math and my goal is to build github.com / Schiffman neural network p5 a little toy does this work I love this stuff was broken last time I checked this is kind of working maybe it's working yeah so a little toy and I gotta change this we got to use that what's that there's all these new and missed replacements like fashion or cartoon characters something I got to get one of those so so a little toy neural network to learn how the bits and pieces of neural networks work what is what is all the terminology what are they for how do they work how you code one from scratch I feel like that's an interesting and enjoyable experience for me and possibly for you the viewer and I'm going to continue that and we'll have a little librarian people can build things from it and a lot of what I want to use it for is actually to combine the neural network stuff with genetic algorithms and involve agents that can play little simple games or perform certain tasks so that's a goal that's going to happen barring any other thing that I can't anticipate that's gonna that's something I'm really going to focus on this fall September October November December I also want to spend some time there is I want to mention there's a new project called deep learning is and I kind of want to just find it on github which is a project from a Google research group I and so I want to use deep learn jas and combine that with p5 to make some more sophisticated examples and demonstrations where I don't have work you know that I can rely on a lower level library to handle all the guts of the machine learning for me and I can just make applications so um okay on my live streaming all right I don't remember what the last thing I said was but apparently I really got his talk talk about machine learning yeah I think I took to live East arted the computer hopeful hoping hoping that would help and I'm a little bit paranoid that that's now gonna have caused it's loud thinks now this is a new live stream and I have two separate video archives and poor Matthew who helps me with doing editing and managing the channel is gonna have to try to fix that I need like a code word it's not machine learning it's unicorn kittens I don't know that's not any good so I was saying that the low level stuff ready yeah so I was saying that I don't have the smarts or the time to develop something as sophisticated as deep learn Jes so you know I do have some examples that I've done with tensorflow and Python that I might do as well but this is where I'm this is the trajectory I'm going on I got to get off this topic okay here's the other announcement for this fall oh this camera is off I'm going to start hmm am I here ah I am going to start using something called I cannot reach this high but I can reach up there II I can write on the board's very exciting es6 what is es6 you might be wondering well yes 6 I was about to say is the new version of JavaScript but it's kind of absurd because yes 6 actually is a shorthand for is it II see M a 2015 and as I did the math earlier I worked this out it's been a lot of time all day trying to figure this out that is from two years ago it's very hard to like get back into the get back into the moment okay so es6 ECMAScript 2015 let's find out what ECMA stands for somebody I'm sure knows this and I know you aren't seeing me right now ECM a it stands for somebody tell me what it stands for ECMA international european computer Manufacturers Association it's a standards organization so this is what I was talking about like two hours ago if you're watching this in the archive there's probably a jump cut where I couldn't get anything to work for like two hours etc etc and now what I was talking about was how this fall I want to start using the new which is not so new because from 2013 and now I remember the last thing I was saying was how it takes a while for a lot of these new specifications to be adopted because a lot of browsers don't support them immediately but it's time and then programmers what they have to do is if you're using syntax from es6 and you're expecting people to use your website from an older browser you need to run something I think it's called like Babel which is something special that you can have there in the background to translate your es6 syntax into the older more compatible syntax and then everyone just feels really sad and wants to lay down and take a nap we're not gonna lay down and take a nap no we are not going to take a nap we are gonna bite through this but I'm gonna use the assist 6 syntax and I'm gonna say you know just use Chrome Firefox a recent browser let's go look up what it's supported by let's just see if we can find that I'm sure there's a nice chart or something oops browser support simon is writing in the chat that constant let our popular and I have to say Simon I think you are up past your foot very late wherever you are right now so this is like showing everything where is composed I don't want to look at this so desktop browser compatibility tables for es6 so I'll let you I'll let you look at that before the point of what I'm saying here is that I don't really want to worry about that what I want to do is start using some of the features that I find useful and the two main features that I'm going to start with apologies for that two main features I'm going to start with our let which is a new way of declaring a variable very similar to how one might declare a variable with the keyword var that's really exciting I mean this is gonna make an entire video tutorial about let in es6 okay hold on start this we're gonna edit this into a video tutorial welcome to a video about es6 and let instead of typing var type let good finished that's the end of video okay I don't know if we really will edit that and publish that as its own thing but I'm tempted to so there's more to say about that than that but I'm going to talk about that at some point and then I'm going to talk about the class what it means to write a class in es6 this is gonna be so exciting because it's going to help us through the pain of the constructor function this is me talking and doing physical therapy at the same time it's gonna help us through the pain of all that constructor function stuff and it's gonna make doing object to programming in JavaScript hopefully a little nicer syntax wise so let's solve a particular problem which I will dig into the details about and then there's also something called Const you know we just maybe I'll use it someday not right now okay so that's I'm gonna come to so what should I do what what do we have time for today by the way somebody in the chat just wrote anyone else from Hungary and I'm like ate lunch an early lunch was kind of a small lunch it was just little egg salad and a yogurt very hungry and I read that from anyone else hungry I was like there was what somebody ordered I don't really eat I'm not like tomatoes a little little rough on my throat and acid so don't don't do this but somebody once ordered a pizza while I was streaming live send it to me it was very very funny and I gave it to the students here Oh arrow functions K week mine asks about arrow functions so I will also this fall talked about arrow functions I have something to admit I don't understand this at all read some articles a couple people explained it to me I will look work through it and hopefully help it will make sense to me maybe it'll make sense to you you will help me I'll help you I don't know how that's gonna happen but this is a big question mark for me I know that fun fun function which is a great YouTube channel has a bunch of videos about es6 features just watch videos things like know I mean that's actually I will watch those videos but I won't just read like write down the script and then say it again in my own voice that wouldn't be pointless but I will say it again in my own style with my own thoughts and if you really want to know the correct information you should watch fun fun function alright that's es6 let's do a coding challenge and by the way Austen fish in the chat is writing arrow functions are essentially oneline functions where the body of the function is implicitly returned there you go that makes sense to you all right and silence says that arrow functions are popular also okay so I'm starting to reach my limit of what I can manage to do I don't know if I should bother to get the music working because the music right now is not working I could I could play the music but it's gonna be very very loud and a little afraid to do that to your ears but I could do this is that really loud so me it's not that loud okay tell me if those sound effects were like really way too loud or if this is too loud as always I always forget the diss stop this stop okay what I want to see is in the YouTube chat in the slack chat the post can't adjust the volume levels in post they're not being recorded separately I want everyone to throw out some coding challenge ideas well either all they do is spin the wheel or a straw poll because I could do the straw poll coding challenge so what I actually what I wanted to okay this is what I want to do I'm gonna do what I said I was gonna do so I'm teaching again this course called programming from A to Z I've renamed the YouTube playlists for our thanks to Matt's suggestion programming with text because programming from A to Z sounds like oh this is a beginner level course this course is actually a quite advanced course I will this semester get to where's that sound effect wait Chrome extension going tap in Chrome extensions but it's the only thing that I have all of those they have video tutorials for all of these topics I'm going to add things like word to Veck I'm gonna do word Tyvek I'm gonna do something about recurrent neural networks and generating text so I also am going to add a bunch of tutorials about things that I haven't done up making an Alexa skill so there's a bunch of things that I'm adding to the course if you want to start from the beginning there's a playlist and things will get added k week Minh suggests a quaternion Chrome extension yeah Chrome extensions okay so but what I want to do is in this first week one of the things that I talked about is creating i'm scrolling like a crazy person here the homework assignment for the first week for my course would just started here at whyyou is to make a text nasha machine and you could make up your own what is how can you make an algorithm to retrieved to take text from a source something somebody typed in a text file that's loaded a Twitter feed it's something like that and create new text out of that that could be poetry that could be experimental in any number of ways so some examples of this historically are cut out machines from The Beat artist writer William Burroughs raise your poetry which i think is from the french writing collective Weibo if I'm saying that correctly the N + 7 technique is one of my favorite things let's look at this page I just don't know the historical origins of n + 7 so what n + 7 does Oh it's also from Aleppo so the idea of n + 7 and the writer takes a poem already in existence and substitutes each of the poems substantive nouns with the noun appearing 7 nouns away in the dictionary so so this is like the N + 7 ruled a Wallace Stevens poem the Snowman what must have a miniature of wisdom to regard the fruit and the boulders of the pinions crusted with soap so that's one thing and then the die a stick technique which I've talked about in a video and I made a whole video about so there's also something called the flesh index which is something that I talked about in this course and has a little tutorial here about readability score the flesh index being a readability score what is the reading level is this that what kind of children's book is it a kind of newspaper article is it like a PhD thesis what's the reading level and you can kind of intuit think like well maybe articles that have longer sentences with words with more with more syllables those are higher reading levels versus something like with short sentences with one or two syllable words it's a lower reading level lower flesh index course so here are some options an eraser I talked about I didn't actually say what that was but an eraser is a kind of and this actually this is really useful for learning about Dom manipulation because if you have a I think I have some videos that do stuff like this but if you have a big body of text a challenge is how can you treat each word separately through JavaScript so like even though it looks like to the reader like it's one paragraph tag each character or each word is a separate span perhaps so that you can modify its color or its behavior so erasure n plus 7 oops n plus 7 I've no idea how I would do that I would need some kind of machine readable dictionary I could use like word Nick or word net erasure yes it's time to discover a little something to make like is that by the way after that whole sore throat is lots of like let me not go through the sore throat Fiasco from last year and you know knock on wood no more medical issues ok n plus 7 erasure n plus 7 what was the other one I've no memory anymore I just lose this page well I index there was another one racer n plus 7 die astok o cutups I could do a william burroughs cut up so it's probably like a not one of the less interesting ones let me see if there's any other yeah people wanted me to do games Angry Birds so yeah I'm gonna do something with text today that's what's gonna happen although honestly the game would be simpler so let's do one of these erase your n + 7 flesh cut ups so I'm going to say Creepo I'm gonna do all these a JavaScript as a web page and here is the straw poll the straw poll you URL Z WBFF CSP if somebody who has privileges can post this in the chat I will play you some music as always I always forget to this stop it stop it stop this duck is a type of poetry where the first blast or other letters in a line spell out a particular word or phrase like resist perhaps the most common and simple form of an acrostic poem is where the first letters of each line spell out a word or phrase that way this would be an interesting thing to program for sure it's not on my straw poll though whoops let's view the results people are really interested in the eraser which is good let me just show you what the because I've made an example I mean I actually I would have to build it so I'm gonna go to the example just to see it cuz it does present an interesting challenge and I'm gonna go find my examples here's the erasure poetry machine so so this is what it does what it does is you can see here I can hover over any word and highlight it and you have to excuse my poor graphic design abilities and I can click on it to erase it so I can do an irate it now obviously I could pick and like erase a whole bunch of things randomly I could have a slider that's what percentage of things to erase but this is kind of interesting how do you handle these interactions how it's not actually erased I just changed the color to white so it doesn't actually show up but interestingly enough keep spacing I could erase things and actually not keep that keep them there so that's a kind of interesting so this would be something that's interesting too to try and would demonstrate certainly a bunch of Dom manipulation techniques so I'm happy to try this now if you're not so interested to go back and vote for something else refresh results n plus seven is taken the lead whoa do we need a runoff people are not interested in the flesh our cutoffs acrostic was an interesting idea so let's let's uh I have a procrastination problem it's like six o'clock when I said I was going to leave but I'm gonna do a cocoa tin challenge today I'm not looking for sympathy it's just like a involuntary reaction okay so what I'm gonna do we're gonna do a run off may hit refresh one more time we're gonna add a cross stick n plus seven is really winning we are going to make a new straw poll and I'm going to say run off I'm gonna say n plus seven erasure right those were the two for the runoff and now an acrostic and again an acrostic is I showed it already so I'm free you know create the ball and the reason why I like the across because I actually don't have an example that does that so I think that's kind of an interesting idea wy4 to z ad three this is the URL straw poll calm I'm gonna give this the amount of time it takes this song it's one minute and eight seconds this way you have one minute in eight seconds stop stop 26 seconds we are waited should we see look at the middle again Boetticher curious rustic is winning by quite a bit that's interesting we've got 10 seconds left to vote I'm gonna do this stuff this dot this dot this is what I love about the across never forget the bits dot but somebody composed that song for me okay we're gonna remember refresh the results in five four three two one and acrostic is the winner acrostic we are going to program a coding town for that across again here's what I love about this what I want the acrostic and let me uh let's go back to here what I like about this Oh Oh interesting I think I'm gonna do it where the first letter so this is interesting that you could do it with a letter in the middle but to keep things simple I'm gonna do it with the first letter now what I'm going to do is I'm going to allow the user to enter in a text input a word and then the poem will generate with that word now here's the thing how do I get it to sound like language or sentences like do I just I think actually hmm what's an API I think the word Nick API let's look at word Nick for a second so I feel like using the word Nick API would be perfect for this so let's go look at that for a second because I think it gives me more than so what I want to do is boy haven't I have an API key already so I can find that somewhere in my stuff but where is that Docs I guess I'm looking for if I look up a word how do I ask search so search is what I probably want to give me words and start with a certain letter by the way I would love to take lank and the chat is saying please allow more time for the voting as we can't copy paste the URL in order to vote okay I will do that next time I apologize for that I'm kind of just being a goofball about this stuff I hope nobody was like really put out by the voting I will check it again it's still the same result but so I really like the word Nick API someone is saying use the dictionary API what I need are some suggestions in particular if you're a patron and in the slack Channel that would be great of how how to search for a particular word that starts with a certain letter so query is like what if I just do query a and do try it out so yeah now I get words that start with the letter A so I can definitely use the words search in Word Nick and I can do things like I can do things like oh but I can have it use it in a sentence I can have it use I can use the use it in a sentence and then position it for the acrostic so that that letter is highlighted maybe but I could do things like you know it had at least has to be like a five letter word like I'm changing the minimum length now and so now if I try it again I'm only getting five letter words I could do things like maximum corpus count like I could use words that aren't used that frequently so what if I said 50 between one here's only one time and fifty times I think that would probably be in try it out now I'm gonna get words like apparel Aang I don't even out go neurotic a borin see so this is expert so this is kind of interesting so I can definitely use I should so I will bold the first I can definitely use this to get some interesting words the question so maybe what I'm going to start with actually and and I'll leave this as an exercise I'm gonna do a simple conan challenge the simple coding challenge unless somebody has a better idea woop IP is in the chat I meant to say this actually earlier the first this is the first thing I don't meant to say then I don't know if we have any viewers in Florida or in the Caribbean that are even in Houston I'm just you know just want to say be safe everybody who's in there's paths of these hurricanes I don't know if any will any will come up and hit this far up I'm in New York or the east coast but okay I definitely can search by part of speech so I could do something like noun verb noun or something like that but I think what I'm going to do to simplify things is I'm gonna make an acrostic which is just a list of words bolding the first letter so the poem it's just going to be some strange words and then I think as an exercise for people watching the video the thing that they could expand on this would be to expand on this could be to like actually make the it more poem like think of a creative way to make it actually be lines of poetry the spacing of the poetry what other what else whatever link I use will of course I will share okay so so here we go let's get set up as always though as always okay so what do I need first please bear with me because it is now 6 p.m. and I was going to be late getting home so I would like to just check and make sure I have no emergency messages alka one of our viewers I know he's doing ok ok so I'm ready yes I need to get set up what I need is your neck website and I leave this acrostic poem no wonder it's just the good a directory too loud sorry too quiet better I am going to go to the finder here I'm going to I don't know a p5.js example this will work I should really use that p5 manager tool it's a node tool it's really awesome I'm gonna use that something to remind you next time and I'm going to reach change this to be called acrostic and then I'm gonna open up Adam still quieter people want the music quieter open your cross stick am I too loud put in the title acrostic and then I'm going to go to the test go to acrostic run a server good code so guess what nothing has changed here on the coding train in today's episode of the coding train I spent two hours rambling then having technical difficulty and didn't actually code until two hours into the livestream I should not do them okay let's open up the console vehicle is not just fine let's get rid of this it's got p5 okay so let's look at I need to get the most recent p5.js which is what a nice new version 0.54 let's update our p5.js here so this is the Dom library which I also need and now what I need is also p5.js I don't think I'm gonna use any sound so let me add that as well this this stuff will not go into the coding challenge this is just Cree getting ready ah it's so close I hit copy instead of paste backs there we go okay we are just about ready some girls and networks please okay all right function set up console dot log acrostic let's just see that things are working things are working and I lost those let me open up this we are so ready for this we are so ready for this who's ready for this okay my stomach is now devouring itself I think though all this moving around is probably good for my elbow okay hey you Ning is this thickening who is going to be appearing in a guest video soon was actually watching this I'm sorry that I haven't gotten back to you I just have been behind in everything but it's my intention to I'm trying to scroll back into the chat but hi inning if you're the yuning that will be appearing in a guest video soon okay everyone wants me to get started let's let me press the button on the camera let me do you think what's the chance that I'm gonna need the whiteboard during this coding challenge and I can't even find an eraser so even if I I guess I could use this tissue oh no here's my race no that's not the eraser you can't see me here but I'm going to Oh these cameras like changed how they worked one thing that I can't really do is erase because my arm is so weak still from that accident and all the time being in the cast and the splint and healing I can't like with this hand I could I could do it my left hand there's a solution I can't like put pressure and this tissue like does not really erase this stuff I can't really put pressure on a surface push down this is very silly I'm doing here wasting this time trying to erase this whiteboard but I'm doing it nonetheless okay good enough all right here we go you know I kind of want to have like a big moment because I have done a Cody challenge in like two months but boy this is like my fan is whirring like crazy but there's really no point in me doing that because someday all these videos will just exist in the library as if there was never any time involved at all and here we go ADA is here in the chat welcome ADA who used to live apparently in a different state compared to where she lives right now okay here we go um by the way I don't know if anybody is a moderator there's a new thing oh good somebody's already fixing that somebody's already doing that I have a new like protection in the chat against I turned on a YouTube like chat Auto moderation okay stop it I know what you want me to do you really want me just to read some random digits don't you you haven't waited two and a half hours for me to actually code something just to have you read some random digits have you eight thousand eight hundred seven thirty thousand I love torturing you I just really really do I was like what are the greatest moments of my life just right now because I know how much nobody wanted me to do that hello welcome to another coding challenge this is a coding challenge as part of my programming with text stuff and I'm going to attempt to do something that I actually didn't I knew about this before but I forgotten about it someone in the chat during one of my live streams mentioned it so I'm going to attempt in this video to program what's called an acrostic I want it to tell like time that with the zoom thing but that didn't really work so what is an acrostic an acrostic is a poem or other form of writing in which the first letter or syllable interesting enough of each line spells out a word message or the alphabet so what I want to do and I'm going to just come over to the whiteboard to explain this is like if we have a certain word like mango I can't believe I didn't use rainbow or blueberry blueberry rainbow or unicorn but then I want to have a poem where the first sentence is like my beautiful flower always smells nice and oh that's fine oh it starts I have no ability to be creative and think with words it's just not with a baby you will do something better and plus we're gonna ask the computer do this anyway so now I think there's a lot of interesting questions about this what I want to do is create a web page that has a text input box so the user could type in a word and then get the acrostic coming down now across it can be a lot of things it can we can work with syllables the the actual like letter could appear in the middle of each sentence it could be highlighted there's so many stylish interesting things you can do but I'm gonna try to do something really simple I'm just gonna create a little pom as one word per line and each word starts with that letter now it's not it seems like it's not a lot but I think we're gonna get some good JavaScript HTML Dom manipulation stuff maybe I'll use the word Nick API to find words that start with a certain letter and then you after watching this video can improve on this and make a more creative version that does something more stylistic visual animates are actually has think about ways that you might use oh I could have done something like a Markov chain I this Markov chain videos to like generate the text that starts with a given letter some kind of white there's a word I'm not allowed to say anymore because it makes everything crash its rhymes with machine burning but I can't say it's the topic that shall not be named but you could use that to like some kind of it rhymes with maccer n't rural wet work anyway onto the coatings I took too much time code already so it says in the chat it is time now to code and so here's a Wikipedia page for an acrostic we can see one that is here from 1850 and you can read more about it now I'm in the wrong place let's redo that at point format yeah thank you about yeah let's get to coding being told to code so you could read more about acrostics here obviously on the wikipedia page you can see a nice example here and i already have open the word Nick developer API because I thought a while ago that I was going to use this so let's get started the first thing we need to do and I've got some code here there's nothing in this what I want to do is first at least add I'm gonna acrostic a header in the HTML page then I want to make a little paragraph and I want to make what do you call this thing input word list do it I I can't even remember I I haven't coded in so long I don't even remember what this stuff is but hopefully this is gonna be right let's look at our web page now there we go so the idea here is that I type in a word like mango or a unicorn who would be cool actually if it's constantly generating the acrostic as you're typing so it's like actually generating with each letter each letter your delete but let's not do that on the fly let's have a submit button and let's add a button and say submit button so we have the submit button the idea here is that I'm gonna say unicorn and I'm gonna hit submit and I'm gonna see my across the carrier that's very hard for you to see this tiny tiny tiny tiny stuff but now you can see that it's bigger okay so we've got the web page and of course you as the viewer of this video can make it much more beautiful and interesting interactive web page that gets the word in a different way but this is where I'll start next what I need to do is oh you know what be interests we could use a kit well we're not gonna use canvas I'm using the p5.js library as I often do but I'm not gonna use canvas so I'm gonna say it's for any kind of like drawing or animation but you might want to I'm gonna say new canvas no campus no it's like oh that's very not very nice I like say yes whenever possible I like to say yes if you can say yes say yes what is this crazy do you guys see what's going on here the like there's some kind of like goes to the Machine like that's really weird what is going on okay I'm just gonna live with that I'm gonna live with the weird flickering maybe somebody can tell me what it is another oh whoa I can't live with it anymore timeout what is going on I'm gonna quit Adam this is okay so we're gonna edit this out I guess that's why and I might I'll just move to sublime people or time use a visual studio I don't know I I just haven't use it before what everyone says they love it let's open this back up and Adams not open well I'm just gonna give it a quick try and if Adam breaks it should actually reopen it oh wow it like deleted what I had what did I have this is what I had right okay oh it's doing it again what is it doing whoa is it my is it my computer and keyboard is it Adam let's not use Adam let's switch over to sublime once again nothing there what do they have no canvas oh it's not doing my Auto well it's fine I'm gonna have to live with this houses fontsize okay you know I like whenever possible I like to use something that's open source and free and sublime is you can use it for free it's I do actually have purchased a license to sublime remember I purchased it or I have a license to purchase from NYU I think I purchased one like a long time ago but I probably don't have it on this computer so it's probably going to they're gonna like yell at me and saying it to pay for a visual studio code is also open source says Nick Nick okay all right edit point over I'm back and using sublime text because there was a monster in my computer a little mouse or something running around and doing something with Adam so I'll come back to Adam another time but we've got to get this code written so I'm gonna go back here and run this and we can see things are still going it's hard for me to scratch my ear I'm doing it okay so now what what do I need to do so the first thing I need to do is I need to get whatever the user enters so I need to have access to when the user hits the button and then I need to have access to what's in the text input when the user hits the button I'm gonna do something a little bit weird this is gonna be weird oh wait didn't it didn't syntax highlight that for me no no I can't go on my iPad battery died it's not gonna syntax highlight for me the new es6 feature I'm gonna use I cannot I cannot I cannot do it people are people are saying all sorts of things okay so my phone is ringing people like Visual Studio there's like totally a ghost in the computer here hold on what serenity now with deeds it's also getting really hot in here Visual Studio should we go for it download Visual Studio for Mac what do I want I just want community right oh wait no no this looks too fancy for me rich IDE advanced I don't want that search versus code Visual Studio code thank you so this is what I want let's try this liking it so far oh it looks pretty open desktop acrostic I don't want to get rid of the welcome sketch touch a yes will that is tiny oh no how can I increase that's making it bigger but I don't want this really to be bigger how do I increase the font size here editor font size there we go 24 let's try that oh do I need to edit no do I need to put it in here oh yeah editor font size yeah little little extra 24 this needs a comma probably there we go and then let's change the zoom level to 1 and then so this looks good that looks kind of small so let's go to 48 it's double it way too big apparently I don't have any intuition for font sizes how's that still a little big 32 well they just 32 28 okay this good well now it looks kind of small it's fine yeah okay okay I think I'm ready now and what's it doing here does it like know something why is my browser going crazy okay there we go all right huh anybody actually still here oh my god this is how does that okay so can I just get a quick reality check on this font size how does the font size look a little bit bigger I kind of want to make it a little bigger please especially in the patron group in the slack channel if you could let me know you had the icon in the top left clicked okay okay fine font is fine fine fine ever it's it's fine okay okay so Adam was going crazy I am now trying for the first time ever Visual Studio code which is an open source code editor I think by from Microsoft anyway you could look that up on your own I'm gonna give that a try and save this file I'm gonna hit and things are still working so what do I need to do I first need to get access to when a user clicks the button and when they click the button what word they've typed in okay so what is that okay I'm gonna do something really crazy for the first time ever on my youtube channel net button equals select submit so there's a couple things now I made a video tutorial about this new keyword in JavaScript yes six version of JavaScript called let I'll summarize it for you instead of far type left now I'll get I'm gonna make another video which I will put a link to in the description of this video when I make it to talk about what is let and why much you use instead of bar but right now let is bar bar is let far as let let this bar bars let let the smart okay but what I'm doing is I want to select that's a mid button now this is a hash our pound submit means I need that submit button to actually have an ID submit and I want the input to have an idea call that word let me just call it a word input and I'm gonna call this submit button just to be overly verbose so now I'm gonna select submit button and I'm gonna say let input equals select there's so much autocomplete bug not in this text there's word input I might have to turn that off at some point but okay so now I have my two elements that are on the HTML page that I can start to get information from for example when I press the button on the mouse I want to make an acrostic so I'm gonna write a function make a cross make make acrostic so this here in case you're wondering when I this is p5.js sent a function in p5 stages it's yes when I press the mouse on the button call the function make acrostic here's the function make acrostic the first thing I just want to do is say let word equals word input dot value there we go so I am getting whatever somebody typed in and I'm going to console dot log word now I'm gonna hit refresh and here we go oh my sound effect board died that's my rainbow submit o word input dot value is not a function hmm so what did I get wrong select word ah I called my variable input and the ID was word input so that's just supposed to be input there's a mistake that I made good for me I'm gonna type in rainbow again hit submit and there we go and now what they going to do to make development a little bit easier is I'm just going to in the HTML I'm going to say a value equals rainbow so that way when I load the page up it actually just fills in rainbow for me and I'm going to do something else when I load the page up I'm actually just going to call the function make acrostics I don't even have to my arms are still sore it's a long story probably other videos about that but that's why I don't have to press the button every time I load the page I could just hit refresh and it's running that acrostic function so now we're set up but now comes the actual harder part what I need to do is look at the each letter one at a time and start a new line of a poem with that letter so how do I iterate over each character of a string that's not so not something I could definitely manage a VAR oh no no no call the emergency es6 train for nut i equals zero I is less than word dot length i plus plus now I'm going to say mm what should I do let's make a div for each one I don't know there's lots of different ways I could think about creating each line I'm gonna just do it as a div creative word car at O so word yeah car at I so now if I do this we can see there is a good circle I can move this over here so I'm not standing in front of it there is the beginning is my acrostic rainbow if I type in mango mango mango so really all I've done so far is have a text input field of button I could then look at each letter one at a time and put them on a separate line because each one is a separate div okay now I'm gonna have to be a little bit clever probably about how I organized these lines and all that sort of thing but now here's what I want to do instead of just putting the letter what I want to do is go and make write a line of poetry that starts with that letter and again instead of a line of poetry I'm just gonna have one word that starts with that letter so how do I get a word that starts with that letter well there's any number of ways I could do that I could try it out write some algorithm to make up a word I could load a text file and sort all the words in that text file in some kind of associative array dictionary JavaScript object thing that keeps track of every word by letter and I've done that in other videos and that actually would be a good you should try that I'm gonna use the word Nick API word Nick is a API application programming interface a thing that your application can interface with via programming that's one way to think about it that has a lot of information about words it's like a big dictionary with lots of information that words and I can if I go to develop or word Nick comm and I go to Doc's I can start to look at what are some of the things that I can ask word Nick one of the things that I can ask word Nick is give me sub words and one of the ways I can ask for some words is by searching and one of the ways I can search is by search any words that start with a certain letter so I'm going to ask for words start with the letter R I'm going to I could say like only now so things could be interesting there this is interesting corpus count corpus count is a part of the word Nick API where to keeps this big corpus of lots of I think articles and books and things I could say well how common is the word likethe would have a really high corpus count but fractional would have a lower corpus cowboy I really can't think of anything so I kind of actually want to have rare words I think it'll be more interesting so I'm gonna say someone a corpus count between one and five dictionaries maybe a little bit different I don't have to read the documentation and minimum length let's not get one letter words let's at least have a six letter word and no maximum length and I don't really need to get ten words I'll just take whatever is first and I'm gonna now click try it out and I can see here I've got for our reiterate I don't know why it gave me a first search result with the letter R now if I do it again it doesn't seem to be random actually so maybe I do actually want giving it to me in some order or maybe they're just so let me ask for ten and now I can get a bunch so I think I'm going to ask for a bunch and pick one randomly reproval rattlin roadbook rootage red beets these are some great words and I can also by the way start to do all sorts of things like then ask word Nik for a sentence that uses that word and information about the etymology of that word probably but I'm gonna leave that again those are exercises that you could use to further expand on this so how do I actually get this well look this request URL and I have a whole set of video tutorials about working with api's and request URLs and how you do this you can go back and review those I'll link to that in this video's description but all we need to know for this video is this request URL I'm gonna grab it I am going to copy it and I'm going to put it in my code I am going to say let URL equal this and I think it's wrapping the text so we're looking at this but the thing is I actually don't want it this is the thing that I want to change I want to make this same request but for different letters I'm gonna do something kind of silly let url 1 equal all the stuff in this URL up to here and then I'm going to say let URL to equal all the rest of it and by the way I need an API key so I really should go and sign up for an API key and I have one and I might pause this and at this video in a second to put what a working one in there but when I used word mix website it gave me a temporary API key just so I could like play around and learn how to use it so I'm gonna see if that still works so this is now the second part of the URL and so now when I make for each one of these what I need to do whoo oh boy there's gonna be some tricky stuff here always tricky stuff let's just let's take a break from this algorithm for a second and just at the beginning let's say load JSON so load JSON is a function that allows me to load some data from a API call a URL and I'm going to load the first half of the URL plus the letter R plus the second half of the URL I'm just going you are now because what I want to do is this needs to eventually become dynamic like I need to get different letters yes okay okay okay let's edit that out perhaps so then when I load the data from the API I need to write a callback function to tell me when that's ready so I'm gonna write this function I'm gonna say data got data okay so now I'm gonna say got data and what I'm going to do with is I'm gonna write a function I'm gonna call it got data I'm gonna get some data and I'm just gonna say console log data so I just want to see now that this works with word mnek it's gonna go back to here and I'm gonna hit refresh oh I have an error sketch digest lying to what's wrong here oh there's like an extra R here for no reason okay look total results 2308 search results here all the words are I don't know why R is 1 I guess it always gives you that first reentry redlit and great so I got that and I got 10 there are two thousand three hundred and eight possibilities so I should probably maybe I shouldn't give it a limit if I take the limit out maybe I'll just get all of them and I can pick a random one there might be a better way to do this there's probably a way for me to ask for a random one through the the way I form the query but let's do this anyway so now I got it soul only gave me ten I wonder if 10 is the maximum but I'll come back to that later maybe somebody in the chat will will tell me how to do this later I'm just going to get 10 and pick a random one okay so we know that works how's the thing I need to do this I need to do this load the JSON for every letter what is every letter it is var oh god oh no mark let letter equal word car at I create a div with that letter pause so I'm somebody you skip in the URL skip the first one the single letter that's a good idea and I could also use skip to a move to a different point but I don't know that I'd have to ask for the total first which is kind of overly complicated create ok I'm back then I want to create a div with that letter and then I want to load the JSON instead up the hardcoded R value don't want to load the JSON with the letter so let's see how this goes and let's be a little let's be simpler here let's go to index of HTML and let's have it just do it for Bo Bo W let's just use it to it for 3 letters so look at this I got results now here's the thing did I get them in the order bo w this one is o so I got o first then I got W and ice can only assume the last one is be so here's the thing this is really key when working with api's and making multiple API calls everything in Java is asynchronous meaning you don't your the code is going to execute at some point later whenever the API has happened to return and that could happen in any given order no matter what order your ask for things in so I could do something where I asked for them ask for B and only when I get the results back then ask for o and only when I get the results at back then ask for W that's one option another option which I think I might like better is to instead keep track of what I'm asking for when it comes back just check what it was and then use that so this I think is what I'm gonna do oh and somebody in the chat is now telling me by the way so let's fix this that put the limit back I don't know where I guess I could put that anywhere so I'm gonna put it here and make the limit equal to negative one so if I make the limit equal to negative one maybe I'll get everything let's see I Scott still only got eleven I think it may be it just maxes out at that whatever edit that out maybe I did that wrong we'll just edit that out of the final video thing since that didn't work Simon is suggesting that I call it data received I like shorter name Scott data is a bit of a I can see how that can be a problem though oh look at this why did I what just happened here did I hit undo weird must've hit undo by accident maybe I didn't hold on a sec anyway I've been up ten seems to me max I'm not gonna worry about it to get rid of the first letter makes skip equal one alright actually one thing I should add to this is say skip equals one because what we note I noticed you that and thank you to the chat for helping with this word nick is always returning just the the letters the first result which I might actually want to use to know which one came back but whatever I'm gonna put skip equal one so that I don't get it right now okay so now here's the thing let's make sure this still works okay got three results bo w now what I need to do is I want to keep track of this particular div so if I make this div let div equals create div then what I want to do is when this comes back I want to feed in the got data function which is up here and I'm gonna move this down now I'm gonna move this and just put it here so I can see it more clearly I want got data to know about this particular div and somehow say like div HTML and then uh you know something so I have to something out of the data so first let's get the date got data function to pick a random word so if I look at the actual data it's in a property called search results and it is a that's an array and I need to pick a random one so I'm gonna say VAR options equals data search results let let this is really really hard habit to break then I'm gonna say var let word equals random options so something nice that p5 does for you is with the random function you can pass it an array and I'll just pick a random one out of it and then console dot log word so now if I hit refresh here mmm interesting I didn't do that crow okay word okay so it's picking that is not an array of words it's an array of object each object has three properties one of which is actually the work the property of words so I'm gonna call this a selection and then let and then I'm going to say console.log selection dot word so now when i refresh this I get three words let's get rid of it's saying we don't need console dot log acrostic and it's confusing that it's console logging bow let's get rid of that so I'm getting wob I should get three different words each time some really interesting weird words that I've never heard of before okay oblige event wolf tap barely okay so now we've got our words but I want those words to know which did to go into so they go in the right order and then eventually we want to highlight the character and I you might need spans who knows what I'm gonna need but let's let's try this okay but I really haven't coded for like two months this is crazy okay I think what I need is a closure so what I want to do is I'm gonna say pick word and I'm gonna say div and then I'm gonna pass it the URL so I'm gonna write a separate function called pick word and I'm gonna pass that function the div and the URL which sort of lets me pair those two things together and they can always live together so that when the URL gets back gives back data it can go with the div bear with me and I have a couple videos about closures and doing this I'll reference those in this video's description so now I can take this load I can basically rename I could write a new function called pick word and what does it need it needs a div and maybe that shouldn't be added should be like an element it I might not need to be a div later and it needs a URL so now I can what I can do how do i okay timeout how do I Auto format in Visual Studio right the ride spirals is making a good point in the chat that just passed the letter and let the URL work out here that's a good point I'm gonna make that correction does anybody know yeah I also could look at the first letter of the word that comes back but does anybody know how I oughta format in Visual Studio alt maybe I actually that's not working ctrl shift F do I have to like select it that did it okay whatever all right a great comment came from the chat which it probably makes more sense for this pic word function actually to include the letter to just receive the letter and have this work of the URL formation happen in the pic word function so I'm going to change that and then I'm gonna say let URL equal this and then I'm gonna say load JSON from the URL got data this is what I had before however what's new now is that the callback is enclosed is in a closure is enclosed inside this outer function so that instead of console logging selection dot word I can say div dot HTML it's that specific div that came into the picard function div dot HTML selection word so now here we go Val neo obscene or whimsical this breckel spores whimsical miss and I can try doing rainbow oops oh wait a second ah Oh No Oh interesting ooh I love that what's kind of fun about that is it was sort of accidental let's take out now the thing that does it automatically so I don't want to like have it do it automatically and it's kind of interesting to do it with a longer word so let's go back to my hold on I lost my here we go let's go back to putting in rainbow here now I actually have to submit take a look here do you see how it filled it in slowly because all those are having asynchronously it put me those letters there immediately now if I didn't want it to do that I could actually just create those divs as empty so I could create an empty div with no content so then I might see them fill in but I wouldn't see them fill in I mean you know I could retrieve I there's so many ways I could animate this or do it differently so here's the thing this is my acrostic coding challenge finished we're gonna read this poem roadbook i gret is prop nick knocked it blue compa Diceman Obachan wire rod here's what I would like any of you who are watching or interested to try to do share with me at Schiffman on twitter in the comments next time I do a live stream I'll share some of your results this code will get posted looking visitorship for the code but a couple things do this so that the first letter is highlighted how can you make the first letter bold or capitalized and highlight it in some way how could you make this more poetic so that you get a full sentence here and it reads more like a poem and another thing you might think of as what if the acrostic isn't so simple and I'm gonna just Google acrostic for a second because I know an example will come up if I do this images maybe where the the letters don't necessarily have to be the first letter so how were you create something and line it up like this and I could always come back and do a part two to this coding challenge if people are really interested but I'm gonna leave yeah I think I better close this window before I get something I don't want to see but this is the basic idea I get user input a word I know when the users hit the button I look at each letter individually I go out to an API but I could have used other data sources look up my Markov chain stuff to generate a contextfree grammar maybe parts of speech tagging read attach as tutorials are lots of other my programming with text tutorials to think about ways you can make this more poetic visualize it in a different way and that sort of thing I'm being told them to chat that maybe the max limit for the word Nick API is 125 oh and there's a bug when I hit submit multiple times it's not really a bug it just does it again so that's something you could fix you can have it erase went there before or put a nice break in between them or something like that okay thank you very much I this is going to be irrelevant in the future when we're all just like brains floating in some sort of goo but this has been the first coding challenge I've done after all one time after I had a broken elbow accident and it's great to be back thank you for watching so I probably was a little off my game here if you're actually still watching this and thank you and I appreciate it see you on the next coding train alright everyone I did it I did a livestream I got Wirecast to work again I made a coding challenge it's not my favorite probably did my best let me see if I can at least yes Simon Tiger is is so the IDS of the divs and all of that definitely oh look my I'm trying to get my iPad music thing to come back so it's almost 7 o'clock this was not a very long livestream because there was an hour and a half of me with technical difficulties but I have been up here for three hours and it's been a long week let me since a lot of you probably weren't here at the beginning I want to mention a couple things I want to mention again date processing org if you ever go back and watch this whole livestream I talked about in a bit at the beginning I'm gonna be there doing a live inperson coding train episode I don't know what that means exactly and I also want to mention once again if you are a high school student or know of a high school student or friends with a high school student or have a child who's a high school students or an older sibling who is a high school student check out ITP NYU edu slash ima this is a new program starting at NYU where I teach called interactive media arts there's going to be a Facebook live stream about it where you can ask questions on Monday and you can tweet me at Schiffman if you have questions about and up put you in touch you can also tweet at ITP underscore actually you can tweet at ima underscore NYU so what I would love is anybody's interested go to the Facebook live tweeted ima underscore NYU and say you heard about ima through the coding train that'll make me really happy it makes me like I'm doing a good job here at my job at your University okay so treats for those of you who are still here at the end let's see here oh okay I need to make bear with me for a second okay I was just trying to do something as like an extra thing at the end I was quick to say one of the things I'm interested in so I'm doing physical therapy with this elbow and the thing that I'm doing is getting range of motion back so you can see and I'm actually pretty tight right now if I use a heating pad and do a lot of stretching I will get quite a bit further I'm gonna be doing this for the next few months one of the things that I hate that you do at the physical therapy office is I can't tell if things are working I'm gonna just go to the slack Channel is that they measure so one of the things I was thinking about is developing a physical therapy application that measures the angle I don't know if this is useful or not if you could do something with an accelerometer probably but with computer vision so but just record a short video of me stretching my arm and since I have the sleeve on it it's high contrast you could probably use computer vision to calculate this angle of the elbow and the same thing you know for going out this would be you know this is zero degrees and this is it's probably like 25 degrees right now I can get it to 15 with stretching I have this like device that I can where it can be able to sleep it yet but it's a device that stretches out your arm you're supposed to sleep in it I don't know how to do that anyway so if anybody wants to capture these and think about like collaborating working a little opensource tool to connect to something computer vision I don't know if there's a better idea so that's one thing I was going to mention and if anyone wants to see my exciting scar I don't think there's any a trigger warning or being like squeamish here but you probably can't even really see that so there's my excited scar where I had a nice incision I thought I said I would show that at the end some people asked I do have some really interesting photos of me with 32 staples in my arm and all sorts of swollen stuff if you're really interested in that okay so that was my extra thing at the end I happy to take one or two questions before I go did this iPad come back I'm gonna get my not now put on my goodbye song thank you for tuning in if you're interested in supporting this YouTube job I've had the patreon on cause I haven't charged anybody for the patreon all of July and all of August which I guess is actually all of August in all of September but on October 1st assuming I keep this up this month and get back to the machine learning stuff if you would like to join the coding trains patron group and slack channel patreon.com slash coding training what else support the processing foundation processing foundation org if you're interested in this new undergrad there's a graduate program by the way you called ITP that's been around for close to 40 years but this is a new program called ima Frank is asking are you back on a regular schedule my plan is to be back on a regular schedule every Friday right now I'm targeting 400 p.m. Eastern Time every Friday I might do earlier to at least sometime on Friday I'd love to have a regular timeslot there will be I can think of two Fridays that I'll miss over the next few months but at least hopefully extra Friday okay have you also learned in school how to hello I don't know please paint your bad day Green's that we see a floating hand so this is actually what's called a compression sleeve you don't need to wear it but it's fabric and it helps with the swelling because it's an elastic fabric it just sort of somehow psychologically makes me feel a little bit more comfortable do you think we live in a computer matrix maybe thank you guys I also will just say thank you to everyone for I have so many well wishes and kind words I have not applied to a single youtube comment in like two months I do kind of read them all I'm kind of really out of the habit of that but definitely um some of you note that Schiffman on twitter if you want to get in touch I'll mention that at the coding train if you have questions about logistics and customer service you know what that means but Matt Blanchette who does a lot of work doing video editing and other type of stuff for the channel I guess super calm like the channel manager is now has the keys to the coding train twitter account so you can follow that maybe some more stuff will happen to that account and I don't want to promise anything too much and I maybe I should do I dare hold on I have a little treat if you're still watching is anybody really still watching the thing is I need to somehow acquire this okay I'm gonna switch for a second cuz I've got to go like into my email I don't want you to see my email I will be soon releasing a new music video for the coding train and I'm going to show you like four seconds of it but I have to get into my email which you cannot see right now because you're just seeing the green screen no I'm reading my email which is very stressful don't look at my email here it is this is a little sneak preview yeah I could I'm going to have to close out my email before I come back to the screen this is the last thing I'm gonna do for those of you who really stayed through all of this people are messing with me and saying that they're seeing my email but that's just trolling right okay because then I'm gonna have to like do all sorts of annoying things somebody in the slack channel who please tell me that I did this correctly I no one's seeing my email okay great um so now I am going to go back to here and I'm going to show you a short video snippet from the upcoming coding train video that's all there is that's a little sneak preview that's for all of you who are so kind to be here waiting through all that technical stuff thank you very much and I will that video will come out you know I don't wanna make any promises but you know possibly I would say certainly by the end hopefully by the end of the month so stay tuned thanks for tuning in I can't believe that I'm actually gonna have some new content that traffic on my channel is just going like you know so hopefully there's only gonna be one new coding challenge out but I'll be back next Friday thanks for watching the coding train and I will see you soon
