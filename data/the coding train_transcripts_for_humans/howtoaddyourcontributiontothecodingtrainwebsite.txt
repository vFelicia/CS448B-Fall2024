With timestamps:

00:00 - Hello, and welcome
to a quick tutorial
00:02 - on how to submit your own
project to the contributions
00:06 - on thecodingtrain.com.
00:07 - So at thecodingtrain.com,
on the home page,
00:09 - you'll find the most
recent coding challenge.
00:11 - And then, if you click
on Coding Challenges,
00:13 - you'll find all the coding
challenges that I've done.
00:15 - And each one of those
has an individual page,
00:18 - with a description, the video,
a list of links of things,
00:22 - all the source code
with p5 Web Editor,
00:24 - or on GitHub, as well as,
here it is, my favorite part,
00:27 - the list of things that
other people have made
00:30 - in response, as creative
versions, or twists,
00:33 - or improvements on
the thing that I
00:35 - coded in the video itself.
00:36 - So if you're wondering
how you can submit yours,
00:39 - I'm going to show
you how to do that.
00:40 - So let's pick, arbitrarily,
not so arbitrarily,
00:42 - the 10Print coding challenge.
00:43 - It's the one that happens
to have the most community
00:45 - contributions.
00:46 - Let's see if we can get another
one to beat that record, maybe.
00:50 - And I'm going to walk
you through the steps.
00:51 - I'm going to make my own little
twist on it, change the code,
00:53 - and then submit my
own version to it.
00:55 - So here I am on the 10Print
coding challenge page.
00:57 - I've got the description.
00:59 - I've got links
described in the videos.
01:00 - And then here, look at all of
these community contributions.
01:03 - Awesome.
01:04 - So there's a link here
to add your own version.
01:06 - I'm going to go to that,
with some instructions.
01:08 - You could just look at that.
01:09 - But I, instead, am
going to try to walk you
01:11 - through the process.
01:12 - So the first thing I need to
do is make my own version.
01:14 - Presumably, you've
already made yours.
01:15 - But I'm going to go to
View Code, Web Editor.
01:17 - Click on that, and
I'm going to play it,
01:21 - and quickly just
make some changes.
01:27 - So there you go.
01:28 - This is my variation of the
10Print coding challenge,
01:30 - where, instead of drawing
a line forward or backward,
01:33 - I've drawn a circle, and
I have filled it white
01:35 - or filled it black.
01:36 - So now that I've made this
project and then save it,
01:39 - I've got the link to it,
I'm going to go over here
01:41 - to Coding Train, and
I'm going to click
01:43 - on Add Your Own Version.
01:45 - So I'm going to click on that.
01:47 - It's going to take me
to this strange page.
01:50 - Oh, what's the deal
with this page?
01:52 - The format for this
page is something
01:54 - called YAML, which stands
for Yet Another Markup
01:58 - Language, seriously.
02:00 - And you can see here, this
is the metadata associated
02:03 - with this coding challenge.
02:04 - It has a title, of the number
of the challenge, the date it
02:07 - was recorded, the video ID,
which is its YouTube video ID.
02:10 - That's where the source code is.
02:11 - That's the p5 Web Editor.
02:13 - These are various links.
02:14 - And what's most important
here is Contributions.
02:17 - So this is the part
that you need to edit.
02:20 - And I would suggest that you
just put yours at the end.
02:24 - You could slot it in
wherever you want.
02:25 - You could put it first.
02:27 - I guess there's no
actual system for this.
02:29 - But in terms of where I
would ask you to put it,
02:32 - I think it makes sense to
have these somewhat in order
02:34 - of contribution.
02:35 - So I'm going to go all
the way to the end.
02:37 - And the easiest
thing for me to do
02:39 - is to simply copy paste one
of these contributions, which
02:45 - has four fields in it:
title, author, URL, source.
02:51 - So I'm going to copy paste this.
02:54 - And then I'm going
to paste it below.
02:58 - Now I just realized,
you might be asking
03:00 - kind of an important question.
03:01 - Where am I?
03:02 - Where am I editing this?
03:03 - What's Going on?
03:05 - So this is actually
the GitHub website.
03:08 - You'll notice this is
a URL on GitHub.com.
03:11 - GitHub is a website for
hosting Git repositories.
03:14 - A Git repository is a
collection of documents
03:17 - with a history of all the
versions of those documents,
03:20 - mostly used for tracking
the history of a source
03:23 - code related project.
03:24 - I would refer you to my
videos on Git and GitHub.
03:28 - I have a whole series, about 10
to 15 videos, that kind of like
03:31 - talk more about the dot, the Git
software and the GitHub website
03:35 - itself.
03:36 - S if that's
unfamiliar to you, you
03:37 - might go back and look at those.
03:39 - But you don't actually
need to know anything,
03:42 - you don't need to know all
those details to submit
03:44 - your contribution.
03:45 - You just need to be able
to follow these steps.
03:47 - However, these
steps will only work
03:49 - if you have a GitHub account.
03:51 - So if you don't already
have a GitHub account,
03:53 - you will need to sign up and
be logged in for this to work.
03:57 - So once you've done that,
I'm going to go down here.
03:59 - I'm going to add mine.
04:00 - Let's change the title to
Coding Train Demo Contribution.
04:08 - The author is me,
Daniel Sheefmahhnnn.
04:14 - And then, now it's
time for the URLs.
04:16 - So I'm going to consider,
I'm going to go under Share.
04:20 - I'm going to consider,
and again, yours might not
04:23 - be a p5 Web Editor sketch.
04:25 - Might just be a website.
04:26 - It might be a Git repository.
04:28 - It could be anything.
04:29 - But you just need a link to your
documentation of the project.
04:33 - So I'm going to pick this
full screen one, whoops,
04:35 - which is this.
04:37 - And I am going to, where was I?
04:40 - I'm going to paste that in here.
04:44 - Then I am going to go
back here, and I'm just
04:47 - going to do the Editor
View, which is that,
04:49 - and I'm going to
paste that in here.
04:52 - And then, one thing
I'm going to do
04:54 - is, I'm going to
automatically make a mistake.
04:57 - Because it's very common that
you'll miss something up.
04:59 - So for example, what if
I forget the quotes here?
05:02 - I'm going to make
another mistake.
05:04 - I'm going to add like a
couple of extra spaces here,
05:07 - and I'm going to have this
have an extra space here.
05:09 - So I'm going to make
those mistakes on purpose.
05:12 - 10Print Contribution,
circles instead of lines.
05:20 - Now here's the other
important thing
05:22 - that I would really
like you to do.
05:24 - When reviewing
these pull requests,
05:26 - it's really nice
that there's a link
05:28 - to the project in this
optional extended description.
05:31 - It makes it really easy to
click and see what you made,
05:34 - and it lets me see
them much more easily,
05:36 - so I know what to share, and
just be able to react to it.
05:39 - So I would ask that you
add a link to it here.
05:42 - Link to demo here.
05:45 - So I'm going to go back to here.
05:46 - I'm going to go under Share,
I'm going to click this,
05:50 - and I'm going to click this.
05:52 - Now, then, this
is the option now.
05:55 - It will say you cannot
commit to the master branch.
05:59 - But I want to go to Create a
new branch for this commit,
06:02 - and start a pull request.
06:04 - A pull request is a term
that refers to asking me,
06:08 - or not me in particular, but
the Coding Train website,
06:11 - to pull your new changes in,
to pull your submission in.
06:15 - So I'm going to call this
Schiffman-10Print-contribu--
06:19 - Just Schiffman-10Print.
06:20 - I'm going to hit Commit Changes.
06:24 - Now you can see, this is
now, then the last step
06:27 - here, open a pull request.
06:30 - And it's pretty much
filled in for me now,
06:32 - because it took the commit
description in here.
06:35 - So I'm just going to
click Create Pull Request.
06:41 - And then here is the next
really important thing.
06:45 - And we're going to
wait for this to run.
06:51 - I should say what's
running here.
06:53 - This is what's known as
a unit test is running,
06:56 - and it's running via
continuous integration
06:59 - on a service called CircleCI.
07:02 - So I actually have a whole
set of video tutorials
07:04 - also on unit testing and
continuous integration
07:06 - that you can check out.
07:07 - But what it's doing is,
it's checking the syntax
07:10 - of your contribution,
to make sure there
07:12 - are no formatting mistakes in
it, or no missing required data
07:15 - pieces.
07:16 - And well, it came back now.
07:19 - All checks have failed,
meaning there's an error.
07:22 - So this is something
that helps you,
07:23 - when you make your
submission, know
07:25 - whether it was done correctly.
07:26 - And this is so
sort of off-putting
07:28 - to have this big red X.
And you feel so terrible,
07:30 - like oh, my
submission was wrong,
07:31 - and the test didn't pass.
07:32 - No, no, no.
07:33 - Feel good about yourself,
that you stretched and made
07:36 - an attempt, and tried to
submit a pull request.
07:39 - Maybe it was your first
pull request on Github.
07:40 - It doesn't matter
that the check failed.
07:42 - It's just the
computer checking it.
07:44 - You can now make some edits,
or you could ask for help.
07:47 - The Coding Train community
is here on GitHub
07:49 - to help you fix it up and
make sure your submission goes
07:51 - in correctly.
07:52 - But knowing that the
test failed is a bit
07:54 - of extra information for you.
07:56 - So I could actually go
click here on Details .
07:59 - Scrolling all the way down
through all the tests,
08:01 - we can get to the end,
and I can zoom in.
08:03 - It says, "Extra space at the
end of this line: URL editor."
08:10 - So you can see,
this is the error.
08:12 - This is, and this is
the error I need to fix.
08:14 - Unfortunately, it just
finds the first error,
08:17 - and hasn't necessarily
found all the errors.
08:18 - But I can go back now
to my pull request,
08:22 - I can click on
Files Changed, I can
08:24 - go here and click on Edit
File, and I can go back,
08:30 - and I'm going to just
fix all these things.
08:32 - So I'm going to get rid of this.
08:36 - I'm going to put the
quotes around here.
08:38 - Where did I have this?
08:39 - Oh I have extra spaces here.
08:41 - I'm going to click
on those, and I'm
08:43 - going to say commit directly to
the Schiffman-10Print branch.
08:47 - That's going to add those
changes to the pull request.
08:50 - I'm going to hit Commit Changes.
08:53 - And now, if I go
back to Conversation,
08:57 - we can see the unit
tests are running again.
09:00 - And let's hope they
work this time.
09:07 - There you go.
09:08 - All checks have passed.
09:09 - This branch has no conflicts
with the base branch.
09:12 - Merging can be
performed automatically.
09:14 - Merging is the act of
accepting that pull request,
09:18 - and merging the changes with the
current web site's source code.
09:21 - So you won't actually see
this button, squash and merge.
09:25 - And by the way, if you're
wonder what squash means,
09:27 - it means this pull request
has two commits, two
09:30 - separate straight changes, and
squash will squash both those
09:34 - into one.
09:36 - So it just cleans up the
history of the project,
09:38 - because we don't actually
need to separate these two
09:40 - things out in the grand
history of things,
09:43 - even though they are
two separate changes
09:44 - for this request.
09:45 - So you won't see this, because
you most likely are not
09:49 - an administrator of the
Coding Train website,
09:51 - and you will wait for somebody
here to press that button.
09:55 - And once it's
done, you will see,
09:56 - and I'm going to do that now.
09:58 - Once that's done,
all I do is go back
10:00 - to thecodingtrain.com
website, and I hit refresh.
10:05 - Hit refresh, and there it is!
10:11 - My Coding Train
demo contribution
10:13 - by Daniel Sheefmahhnnn is there.
10:16 - And if I click on this,
it will take me over to,
10:19 - there's my contribution.
10:21 - If I click on Source
Code, it will take me over
10:23 - to the source code page.
10:25 - So I should point out,
I'm just showing you,
10:27 - my contribution happened to
be a p5 web editor sketch.
10:31 - But what you might want to link
to could be a YouTube video.
10:34 - It could be just a full website.
10:36 - It could be a blog post.
10:38 - It could be anything you want.
10:40 - One quick gotcha is that for
things that are YouTube videos.
10:44 - Don't put the full
URL to your YouTube
10:47 - video in the contribution.
10:49 - Just put the video ID.
10:51 - The system itself knows
to make the YouTube video
10:54 - URL out of just the video ID.
10:56 - There's probably some
other small details.
10:58 - In theory, those things are
covered here under See How.
11:01 - If I click on See How, this
is a guide to everything
11:04 - that I just showed
you, and you can
11:06 - see the actual format of how
to put in your contribution,
11:12 - and how to create
a pull request.
11:14 - But this is also something
you could edit and offer
11:18 - contributions to, if there are
things missing from this guide,
11:21 - or leave them in the comments
of this video itself.
11:25 - So thank you very much for
watching this quick tutorial
11:27 - about submitting your own
community contribution
11:29 - to thecodingtrain.com website.
11:31 - I hope this encourages
you to submit yours.
11:33 - Don't be shy.
11:34 - Don't be afraid.
11:35 - We're here to welcome you in,
with open arms and rainbows
11:38 - and unicorns, to try.
11:40 - If this is your first
time using GitHub,
11:42 - this is a great way for
you to give that a try
11:45 - and see how it goes.
11:46 - So thanks so much,
and look forward
11:48 - to seeing you in a
future coding challenge,
11:49 - and having your contribution
on thecodingtrain.com website.
11:52 - Bye-bye.

Cleaned transcript:

Hello, and welcome to a quick tutorial on how to submit your own project to the contributions on thecodingtrain.com. So at thecodingtrain.com, on the home page, you'll find the most recent coding challenge. And then, if you click on Coding Challenges, you'll find all the coding challenges that I've done. And each one of those has an individual page, with a description, the video, a list of links of things, all the source code with p5 Web Editor, or on GitHub, as well as, here it is, my favorite part, the list of things that other people have made in response, as creative versions, or twists, or improvements on the thing that I coded in the video itself.

It's the one that happens to have the most community contributions. Let's see if we can get another one to beat that record, maybe. And I'm going to walk you through the steps.

So it just cleans up the history of the project, because we don't actually need to separate these two things out in the grand history of things, even though they are two separate changes for this request. So you won't see this, because you most likely are not an administrator of the Coding Train website, and you will wait for somebody here to press that button. And once it's done, you will see, and I'm going to do that now. Once that's done, all I do is go back to thecodingtrain.com website, and I hit refresh. Hit refresh, and there it is! My Coding Train demo contribution by Daniel Sheefmahhnnn is there. And if I click on this, it will take me over to, there's my contribution. If I click on Source Code, it will take me over to the source code page. So I should point out, I'm just showing you, my contribution happened to be a p5 web editor sketch. But what you might want to link to could be a YouTube video. It could be just a full website. It could be a blog post. It could be anything you want. One quick gotcha is that for things that are YouTube videos. Don't put the full URL to your YouTube video in the contribution. Just put the video ID. The system itself knows to make the YouTube video URL out of just the video ID. There's probably some other small details. In theory, those things are covered here under See How. If I click on See How, this is a guide to everything that I just showed you, and you can see the actual format of how to put in your contribution, and how to create a pull request. But this is also something you could edit and offer contributions to, if there are things missing from this guide, or leave them in the comments of this video itself. So thank you very much for watching this quick tutorial about submitting your own community contribution to thecodingtrain.com website. I hope this encourages you to submit yours. Don't be shy. Don't be afraid. We're here to welcome you in, with open arms and rainbows and unicorns, to try. If this is your first time using GitHub, this is a great way for you to give that a try and see how it goes. So thanks so much, and look forward to seeing you in a future coding challenge, and having your contribution on thecodingtrain.com website. Byebye.
