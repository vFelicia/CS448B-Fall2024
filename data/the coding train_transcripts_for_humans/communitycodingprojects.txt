00:00 - one of the things that's been requested
00:01 - a lot and really excited to talk to you
00:03 - about this today is community projects
00:05 - what does it mean for people watching
00:09 - videos on YouTube learning about code to
00:11 - collaborate together on a project so I
00:12 - have two community projects and I also
00:16 - and that I want to talk about so the
00:20 - first one I want to talk about relates
00:22 - to processing day I've mentioned this
00:24 - before processing day is an event that's
00:28 - happening October 21st at the MIT Media
00:31 - Lab it is a day to celebrate the
00:33 - community that develops and make stuff
00:35 - with processing and p5.js
00:37 - and related things you can see all the
00:41 - people who will be presenting and
00:42 - talking I especially want to encourage
00:44 - you to submit a if you're coming to
00:48 - submit a lightning talk to present a
00:50 - short demo at processing day but one of
00:53 - the things that I've been I am planning
00:55 - to do something live so the thing that I
00:57 - have thought about him thank you to to
00:59 - you and for suggesting this the
01:00 - organizer of processing Community Day is
01:02 - to make an algorithmic design for name
01:05 - cards so anybody who signed up to attend
01:07 - will get a name card and one of the
01:09 - ideas was to put names and on a cloud so
01:12 - if I go to github.com slash coding train
01:16 - and I might be able do a walk-through
01:20 - later of this and I go to community
01:23 - clouds and thank you to me I am so me me
01:27 - I am so me is helping me now to maintain
01:31 - a lot of the github and code related
01:33 - stuff for the coding train Channel and
01:36 - me I am so me created this really nice
01:39 - system to submit your cloud idea so the
01:44 - idea is that can take this as your
01:47 - inspiration how would you design a
01:50 - generative cloud in p5.js
01:52 - so ultimately I'm probably port the code
01:54 - to processing to generate the SVG files
01:57 - and these are going to be printed with
01:59 - thin black lines so this is not about
02:02 - making a colorful image but rather an
02:06 - algorithmic outline and the names will
02:08 - actually be written in calligraphy so so
02:13 - if you are interested in this take a
02:15 - look at this repository I'm gonna click
02:17 - here on it it this repository controls a
02:21 - github pages site and the what you can
02:25 - do is you can submit your cloud you can
02:30 - either work on somebody else's cloud
02:32 - idea or you can in to submit one by
02:34 - writing a function and naming it and it
02:36 - will turn up in this menu so me I am sue
02:39 - me invented this wonderful system that
02:41 - I'm excited about to use for future
02:42 - collaborative projects and if I just
02:45 - show you really quickly if we look at
02:46 - this code here generators j/s all you
02:49 - need to do is go to this file and write
02:53 - your own functions so you can see this
02:55 - function draws a rectangle oh and then
02:59 - look at this it's even so sophisticated
03:00 - that you can then return some values
03:03 - that about where to draw the text but
03:05 - that's an extra fancy feature I love
03:07 - that feature but really you just need to
03:09 - write your own code here write a
03:10 - function you know I you know maybe you
03:12 - want to try using Perlin noise so you
03:14 - write a function called Perlin noise
03:15 - cloud you register it and you register
03:18 - it with a name and the author and then
03:20 - you call this register if you add this
03:22 - register function you submit as a pull
03:23 - request and it will appear as one of the
03:25 - cloud options so everybody maybe I
03:27 - should do a cloud as the coding
03:29 - challenge but that's what I'm going to
03:29 - do it process the community day so so
03:32 - that's one thing I wanted to mention all
03:34 - you need to do is have a github account
03:36 - and hit this edit button now I'm not
03:38 - signed in so saying it must be signed in
03:40 - and of course you know if you're
03:42 - wondering what's get what's github how
03:44 - could I possibly do this you can watch
03:46 - my video tutorials about that
03:48 - topher is asking what and the name is
03:55 - what drives the cloud shape so this is a
03:57 - good question I'm I have to figure we
03:59 - have to figure this out I think the idea
04:01 - if I'm really thinking about it is just
04:03 - a system that generates a different
04:05 - cloud every time you run the code and
04:07 - the cloud has enough space for somebody
04:09 - to hand write a name in it so you can
04:12 - think of it as like there's a bunch of
04:13 - hello my name is sticker name tags that
04:15 - have a nice little generative cloud
04:17 - printed on them and you write your name
04:18 - inside the cloud it might be something
04:20 - slightly different than that but that's
04:21 - a good way of thinking about what it is
04:23 - I'm asking for people to create and
04:24 - so on the one hand this is a
04:26 - collaborative processor maybe have a
04:27 - community designed cloud but you can
04:30 - also sort of submit your own design and
04:31 - you know obviously if we try to make
04:34 - figure out some appropriate way to give
04:36 - credit to those who have submitted code
04:38 - in the actual cloud design and if I do
04:43 - it as a live tutorial I can maybe give
04:45 - credit during that tutorial so please
04:47 - let me know ok the other community
04:51 - project that you can contribute to is
04:54 - and thank you all so again to me I am so
04:57 - me for making this repository is the
05:02 - twelve O'Clock s-- repository so twelve
05:06 - O'Clock s-- is a artwork by John Maeda
05:11 - from the late 90s all made on a I think
05:15 - in this document map OS 9 and released
05:17 - in 1997 the only way to currently run
05:20 - these historical company creative coding
05:23 - this creative coding project from the
05:24 - late 90s is to get like a mac os9 any
05:27 - later or PowerPC and goal on Levin
05:30 - actually did this for a page a blog post
05:33 - for one of his courses at Carnegie
05:35 - Mellon University where he got them all
05:37 - to run and then kind of made some gifts
05:40 - of them so what I would love to do as a
05:42 - community is recreate this exact paid
05:47 - what we're seeing here but instead of
05:49 - gif animations the actual clocks running
05:51 - in the browser so what you can see here
05:53 - if you read this read me will give you
05:55 - more information and if we look at the
05:57 - published github pages you can see this
06:01 - is just a layout for all these clocks
06:04 - but the clocks aren't there right now so
06:06 - this is just a beginning so I would love
06:09 - for us as a community that says one of
06:11 - the inspirations for this speaking of
06:13 - crediting is the recode project recode
06:16 - project org maybe no sold on Matthew
06:19 - Epler Epler recode project let's this is
06:27 - this is a documentation page about it
06:30 - where is the actual link that's Matthew
06:36 - Epler who also by the way has all these
06:38 - great video too
06:38 - girls on YouTube how come I can't find
06:40 - the recode project website someone's
06:49 - gonna be able to help me to find this
06:51 - Rika here we go
06:53 - recode project calm there it is so this
06:56 - is the recode project which is
06:58 - additionally about looking at historical
07:01 - examples of artworks computational
07:06 - artworks made by computers and you know
07:09 - and it's there's a long history of this
07:11 - way that takes way way past you know
07:15 - what I've been doing for the last day
07:16 - over many years and what what people
07:18 - have been doing for me for the years
07:19 - before that and so this is a project
07:21 - where you click on any of these for
07:23 - example let's look at random squares
07:25 - this is one we could probably do here by
07:27 - Charles susuri you can see here is a
07:32 - direct translation and experimental so I
07:34 - don't know if I click on this does this
07:36 - mean we see the translation yeah so this
07:38 - is that a written in processing and this
07:40 - is the artwork so this I would love to
07:42 - do something like this for the twelve
07:43 - O'Clock project
07:48 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

one of the things that's been requested a lot and really excited to talk to you about this today is community projects what does it mean for people watching videos on YouTube learning about code to collaborate together on a project so I have two community projects and I also and that I want to talk about so the first one I want to talk about relates to processing day I've mentioned this before processing day is an event that's happening October 21st at the MIT Media Lab it is a day to celebrate the community that develops and make stuff with processing and p5.js and related things you can see all the people who will be presenting and talking I especially want to encourage you to submit a if you're coming to submit a lightning talk to present a short demo at processing day but one of the things that I've been I am planning to do something live so the thing that I have thought about him thank you to to you and for suggesting this the organizer of processing Community Day is to make an algorithmic design for name cards so anybody who signed up to attend will get a name card and one of the ideas was to put names and on a cloud so if I go to github.com slash coding train and I might be able do a walkthrough later of this and I go to community clouds and thank you to me I am so me me I am so me is helping me now to maintain a lot of the github and code related stuff for the coding train Channel and me I am so me created this really nice system to submit your cloud idea so the idea is that can take this as your inspiration how would you design a generative cloud in p5.js
