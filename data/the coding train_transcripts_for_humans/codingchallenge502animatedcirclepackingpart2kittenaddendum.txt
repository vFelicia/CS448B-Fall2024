00:00 - hello welcome by back this is like sort
00:02 - of like a part two of my circle packing
00:03 - animated coding challenge thing because
00:05 - you know kittens I guess so uh what if
00:10 - we took that I think will be interesting
00:11 - to just look at the circle packing
00:13 - algorithm visualizing a generic image so
00:16 - if you recall where I left it last is
00:19 - it's kind of circle packing around the
00:21 - letter formations here we're seeing 2017
00:25 - but what if instead I were to load and
00:28 - let's go to this kitten image and let's
00:32 - look at what is the size of this kitten
00:34 - image it's 800 by 800 so let's make the
00:37 - window 800 by 800 what if I were to load
00:41 - this kitten image well if I run this we
00:45 - get a lot of things broken because it's
00:48 - kitten touch JPEG so if we run this we
00:51 - can see okay well I don't see the kitten
00:54 - so one of the things I want to change
00:55 - here is instead of drawing the circle
00:59 - seeding the circles locations based on
01:03 - brightness values I just want to like
01:05 - put circles everywhere and pull the
01:07 - color value from the kitten itself so a
01:09 - couple things I should change is one is
01:11 - we don't have this idea of spots anymore
01:16 - so I can get rid of this idea of a list
01:19 - of initial possible spots although I'll
01:21 - discuss why that might be interesting to
01:23 - bring back in and I just want the circle
01:29 - locations to go back to being a a random
01:36 - with value and a random height value and
01:42 - we don't need spots anymore the big
01:46 - difference here so there's this circle
01:47 - packing thing going on again the big
01:49 - difference here is I want the circle to
01:53 - store a color so I'm going to add a
01:55 - color variable to the circle object and
01:58 - when I create the circle I'm going to
02:01 - add another argument that I pass in for
02:05 - color I get an error here because the
02:09 - circle is expecting now a color to be
02:10 - passed in so what I need to do is I need
02:13 - to go
02:13 - and get from that image I need to create
02:18 - a color value and then pass that in so
02:24 - the question becomes what pixel do I
02:27 - look up well I want to look up the color
02:29 - for that X&Y point and the way that I do
02:32 - that is with this formula that I've used
02:33 - in countless image processing videos
02:35 - before where I say the index is X plus y
02:38 - times the images with now there's an
02:42 - issue here x and y are floating point
02:45 - values so this won't actually work but
02:47 - it will work if I just quickly convert X
02:49 - and y into integers using this int
02:52 - function and then I put that in here and
02:55 - now this runs and we see all these
02:58 - circles up but I need to use that color
03:00 - so what I need to do here is come back
03:03 - and say ah forget about a a white circle
03:07 - let's fill based on that color let's say
03:11 - no stroke and now if I run it we can see
03:14 - here is my kitten made with circles okay
03:20 - so you could do this with any image you
03:22 - could do this with live video it would
03:24 - be interesting and this is just one
03:25 - possible way of doing it you can also
03:27 - sort of think about I didn't really I
03:29 - don't remember what I last left this the
03:32 - target number of circles I'm trying to
03:33 - create I'm still trying to create ten so
03:36 - let's look at this actually what happens
03:37 - more slowly and we're going to get more
03:39 - bigger circles because they have more
03:41 - time to kind of grow and this leads me I
03:43 - think to an interesting point which is
03:45 - the how I'm where I'm putting the
03:48 - circles in the ultimate size of these
03:50 - circles is entirely completely random
03:53 - but you might think about what is the
03:55 - creative way you could analyze the image
03:57 - and place a lot of initial circles where
04:00 - there where there's detail in the image
04:02 - and place very few initial circles where
04:04 - there is no detail in little detail in
04:07 - the image so that you grow larger
04:09 - circles and smaller circles for the
04:11 - points where you need to refine to have
04:13 - refine
04:14 - color and and and vice versa so I think
04:18 - that is something that I would love to
04:22 - to investigate you could probably think
04:25 - of like edge detection or other ways
04:26 - what are some other
04:27 - creative ways that you can figure out
04:29 - where to seed the circles based on based
04:34 - on the quality and the properties of the
04:39 - image itself and then if you do that
04:41 - with live video what would happen there
04:42 - so I hope you enjoyed this little
04:46 - addendum in a way it's a second coding
04:47 - challenge and that you make something
04:48 - with this and I'll try to also remember
04:50 - to release JavaScript versions of these
04:52 - for those who you want to try this stuff
04:53 - run it in the browser okay thanks for
04:55 - watching
