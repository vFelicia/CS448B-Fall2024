05:49 - morning this is a quick sound check
05:51 - how's my audio let me know we'll be
05:54 - starting in just a minute or two
06:06 - [Music]
06:50 - [Music]
07:24 - [Music]
07:42 - hello good morning and welcome to the
07:47 - coding trade with me your host Dan
07:49 - that's my name
07:51 - and we as we do usually on the coding
07:54 - train we begin with the numbers I
08:01 - actually only noticed that about a
08:03 - minute and a half ago I was using it as
08:05 - a prop in one of the courses that I
08:07 - teach physically in person here at New
08:09 - York University where I am live
08:10 - broadcasting to you from so I forgot to
08:14 - bring it into this room where I recorded
08:16 - so I don't have random numbers 3 maybe
08:18 - you could help me and actually this has
08:20 - to do with a little idea that I have
08:21 - that I might pursue in the future which
08:25 - is that maybe let's just as a quick
08:26 - experiment you're about 30 seconds
08:28 - behind me in real time because there's a
08:30 - bit of a lag in the live stream but if
08:33 - you could start putting random numbers
08:36 - into the chat this is how I will read
08:38 - random numbers you will experiment with
08:40 - can we create a pseudo-random number
08:44 - generator just from the viewers of the
08:47 - coding drain and while you are waiting
08:49 - those 30 seconds I will quickly while
08:51 - I'm waiting this 30 seconds let me
08:53 - quickly thank Oh wrong button but you
08:55 - can see that let me quickly thank
08:57 - dashlane the sponsor of today's coding
09:00 - train dash line which is a password
09:03 - manager that you will probably see me
09:06 - use as I log in and out of various
09:08 - things during this live stream you can
09:10 - get try a 30 day free trial of dashlane
09:13 - premium if you go to - link comm slash
09:14 - coding train and if you do like the
09:17 - service and want to get it then you'll
09:18 - get 10% off as well if you choose to
09:20 - purchase - lien premium all right I'll
09:22 - talk about - Lane again a little bit
09:24 - later let me take this off and aha whoa
09:28 - whoa whoa I cannot read these 126
09:32 - 8650 for 1150 about five thousand five
09:34 - and forty six six thousand 4.99 twenty
09:41 - thirty thousand nine to thirty one oh
09:42 - this is very friend usually the point of
09:44 - the random number readings you could
09:45 - stop now that's good we're good we're
09:48 - good
09:48 - is for it to be relaxing and soothing
09:53 - I don't remember what music I was
09:56 - recently playing with the random numbers
09:58 - there was the lullaby music like you
10:01 - know who knows um alright so let's begin
10:04 - let's let's not let's skip all of this
10:07 - mumbo jumbo where I talk about 5 million
10:09 - things about different websites that you
10:11 - could find out more and buy things and
10:13 - look at things and download code and
10:14 - contribute code and all that stuff let's
10:16 - just you the viewer and me right now
10:20 - let's get into it but before that please
10:25 - please with the random members oh
10:27 - they're in the discord this is this is
10:30 - much more effective I can actually
10:31 - manage to read these this is a really
10:34 - good one we've got 65 million seven
10:36 - hundred twenty seven thousand three
10:38 - hundred eighty two a little bit afraid
10:40 - that there are some encoded secret
10:44 - messages all right before I get into
10:51 - today's topic which will be the topic
10:53 - for the next several months probably if
10:56 - I'm being perfectly honest let me
10:57 - briefly mention to you that I will be
11:03 - appearing again on Monday if you cannot
11:06 - possibly get enough of me on the
11:08 - youtubes you can get some more of me on
11:10 - the Twitch's with mpj and fun fun
11:15 - function which is a wonderful streaming
11:18 - show thingamabob on the internet with
11:20 - mpj and who i've met in person exactly i
11:23 - think i don't know a couple times and
11:28 - and and formally talked to him on the
11:30 - internet and it's really perfect timing
11:32 - because the topic today i am going to
11:34 - launch my live streams will be filled
11:37 - with me recording short video tutorials
11:41 - to redo all the nature of code materials
11:44 - for 2020 we could get the numbers I have
11:50 - to look away and but it's good timing
11:54 - because I'm going to begin that process
11:56 - today and talk to you about vectors in
11:59 - p5.js and Creed the create vector
12:01 - function and then on Monday I'm going to
12:04 - attempt to teach essentially the same
12:05 - thing to MP
12:06 - J with through the lens of an example
12:10 - about gravitational attraction so that's
12:12 - what's happening a couple things I can
12:15 - sort of like update you on and maybe
12:17 - tease out tease a little bit well
12:21 - David's asking a really good question
12:22 - hold on hold that thought
12:25 - is that what's he gonna say I have yes
12:33 - so you as you might recall the topic
12:38 - that I was kind of going through bit by
12:40 - bit by bit over the fallen into January
12:44 - was this playlist beginner's guide to
12:47 - machine learning in JavaScript so I hope
12:48 - after today starting next week there
12:50 - will be one of these that says the
12:51 - nature of code and there will be you
12:53 - know nine or ten chapters and I'll start
12:55 - filling them all in over the next
12:57 - several weeks but is not finished in
13:01 - fact this is where I left off in the
13:03 - last session I started doing some
13:05 - tutorials about convolutional neural
13:06 - networks and there are two more in the I
13:09 - mean there you can find all that content
13:11 - in the previous live stream but the
13:12 - edited versions of them are waiting to
13:14 - be finished and will they're two that
13:16 - will appear here in the next week
13:18 - probably but I'm just gonna leave that
13:20 - to the side because I really need to do
13:25 - this nature of like a variety of reasons
13:27 - that I'm happy to answer questions about
13:31 - but that's that's what's happening and I
13:34 - will return to this david also asks will
13:37 - you have other coding challenges while
13:39 - you are doing the nature of code series
13:40 - and Cabana videos so I'd well I have
13:46 - something that I am excited to tease for
13:49 - you let's see if I can manage to just do
13:55 - a little something just to hold this
13:57 - hold your hope well hold the train stop
14:02 - the train
14:05 - why why am I not logged in if only I had
14:10 - something like a password manager like
14:13 - dashlane on my device here where I could
14:19 - look up and you might be wondering why
14:21 - am I not using the - laying on this
14:22 - laptop it's because I have a sort of
14:25 - dummy - lay an account because I don't
14:27 - want it to show all my personal stuff so
14:30 - I am looking it up now on my phone
14:34 - Google coding training oh boy this is
14:38 - taking way too long for this little
14:40 - thing
14:41 - [Music]
15:02 - don't worry I'm getting somewhere
15:04 - wrong wrong wrong this is gonna be good
15:27 - just this is gonna be good okay ready
15:45 - I'm going to bring my computer back in
15:53 - just a moment so the next coating in the
16:06 - Cabana video on the hilbert curve will
16:09 - premiere hopefully tomorrow Saturday so
16:13 - I feel like the coding of Cabana is a
16:15 - kind of video to release over a weekend
16:17 - it's like you're just there and it's
16:19 - snowing outside and all of that stuff
16:22 - and so there's this so this is the Jason
16:26 - headland who does a lot of all of the
16:27 - illustrations for the coding train
16:30 - created this lovely scene and also if I
16:33 - open up the browser I think I had it
16:35 - open too this is the springtime scene so
16:38 - this is the more standard coding in the
16:40 - Cabana scene but now this is the winter
16:43 - time theme so so that's coming tomorrow
16:47 - so bad I'm gonna leave this up here just
16:49 - cuz it's sort of like nice to have but
16:51 - let me get back to David's question so
16:56 - my focus my primary focus will be nature
16:59 - of code
17:00 - and to be honest if I was really if I
17:05 - was my I really want to update the book
17:08 - text so what I probably should do which
17:10 - I'm not gonna do is just say like hey no
17:12 - YouTube videos for the next three months
17:14 - sorry I have to work on the book text so
17:17 - I'm gonna try to do them simultaneously
17:17 - that's what my real primary focus is
17:20 - updating the book and I actually looking
17:22 - for contributions for that and
17:24 - potentially to hire a few people two
17:26 - additional people to help me with that
17:28 - which maybe I have to do some more
17:31 - thinking about that but I will I will
17:32 - post you could pro you could join the
17:34 - discord leave like a button to like
17:36 - bring up the discord but someone please
17:38 - post the discord invite link to the chat
17:40 - if you can but the discord is where I
17:43 - will is where we're kind of like
17:45 - organizing and talking about things
17:46 - coding challenges we'll see I mean those
17:50 - are the the lifeblood of the channel in
17:53 - a way those are by far and away all the
17:56 - most watched videos they're what
17:58 - bringing people in there what people
17:59 - seem to enjoy the most so I shouldn't I
18:01 - don't want to stop doing them but I just
18:03 - have this mission to just get this
18:05 - through all this nature of code stuff
18:06 - and get out there again in a way that's
18:09 - more digestible and accessible so that's
18:15 - what my focus will be but you know I
18:17 - kind of hope that I can figure out a way
18:19 - to like livestream a couple times a week
18:21 - easier said than done because there's
18:23 - also a lot of weeks where I'm traveling
18:25 - and I'll actually be taking those weeks
18:26 - off so we'll see Juan Flores in the chat
18:32 - asks I haven't seen most of the nature
18:35 - of code playlist should I wait for the
18:37 - new videos to come out up to you there's
18:42 - nothing wrong with the old nature of
18:44 - code playlist the main the main issues
18:47 - with them is that the the video quality
18:49 - is quite poor as I made them many years
18:52 - ago some of them actually in 2012 I look
18:54 - much younger but the video quality is
18:59 - not so great and so so that means that I
19:04 - would like to improve and then they're
19:07 - using processing which I still use and
19:09 - plan to keep all of the examples in and
19:11 - use in projects and have
19:13 - part of the nature of code materials but
19:15 - since a lot of my teaching now is in on
19:17 - the web in JavaScript I want to create
19:19 - videos that use JavaScript okay all
19:28 - right I think I'm gonna be have to be
19:31 - the one to link the discord link so let
19:33 - me do that real quick I don't want to
19:38 - plug the coding trade memberships even
19:40 - though that's what I'm doing right now
19:41 - but I do have this new bit but somebody
19:43 - joy and said I don't be am so he really
19:45 - loves so anybody joints could do my do
19:47 - bit I think you know what it is well
19:49 - agent last night
19:50 - useful links discord invite a copy link
19:55 - paste and enter okay oh and now let me
20:05 - just mention I know I said I wasn't
20:07 - gonna be like plugging all this stuff
20:09 - but let me just briefly mention the new
20:11 - coding terrain store I'm really uh in
20:15 - the a one thing you'll like about the
20:16 - new coding in the Cabana video is I
20:18 - don't use that chalkboard so the new
20:20 - coding the Cabana video will not have
20:21 - two chalkboard instead I actually am
20:23 - drawing in one of these coding training
20:24 - notebooks and I have this one of these
20:26 - like overhead cameras that you can see
20:28 - just like over over the notebook so
20:30 - there's actually a really interesting
20:32 - fun fact about the drawing in the
20:34 - notebook that I will see if anybody
20:36 - notices and then I'll come back well I
20:41 - will talk about it next week on the live
20:42 - stream so but I really think that I'm
20:45 - plugging is the hoodies because I
20:47 - ordered a bunch of gifts for people and
20:49 - I ordered one for myself and because
20:52 - they're they have to be made in batches
20:54 - they'll only get made if enough people
20:56 - buy sound is on the low side if it's
21:05 - manageable
21:06 - then I would prefer to keep it as is
21:09 - because I'm noticing it get all the way
21:14 - into the yellow right up to the red in
21:16 - open broadcast studio and I prefer uh to
21:19 - be able to turn it up on their own
21:22 - and use headphones okay okay okay okay
21:29 - okay oh okay all right
21:33 - I mentioned Monday stay tuned
21:37 - well now
21:52 - what oh it's just I don't have the
21:54 - nature of code like I won't bought that
21:56 - domain but it's here okay all right all
22:06 - right so here's how this worked here's
22:08 - how this is gonna work
22:12 - um so I don't know if you've all seen
22:14 - this but YouTube has a new feature
22:15 - called YouTube learning playlist so I'm
22:18 - gonna be filling that out with content
22:20 - and I have actually you know by accident
22:22 - in a way made a lot of the videos
22:25 - already so what I need to do today is
22:28 - just do like a quick intro then and then
22:34 - I think just sort of like talk about the
22:36 - introduction and is there like let me
22:39 - try to get the table of contents hold on
22:46 - a sec I'm just going to do this for a
22:49 - second hold on
22:56 - oh whoops I'm not logged into the nature
23:14 - of code they log into my - light here we
23:26 - go oh-ho - factor excellent oh no no no
23:40 - - factor authenticator
23:50 - [Music]
23:57 - [Music]
24:06 - [Music]
24:19 - [Music]
24:26 - I wanted to pull up the table of
24:51 - contents everybody always wants this
24:59 - background music I don't know that it
25:01 - exists anywhere on the Internet the song
25:03 - is called Tori the dog that's what the
25:06 - song is called and it's by a composer
25:08 - named Adam Blau ad am b Lau I think
25:13 - Adams on Twitter at Adam Blau if he
25:15 - wants to release this in somewhat
25:17 - sublicense more widely welcome to but he
25:19 - was something he happened to have his
25:21 - archive library of stuff that never got
25:23 - used and I I love that and I started
25:26 - using it now everybody asks Metro writes
25:33 - nothing happened for the last 50 minutes
25:36 - welcome to the coding train where
25:39 - nothing happens for a way longer than 15
25:42 - minutes you have won by watching the
25:45 - coding train ah lucky la Lama with the
25:49 - super chat has won 15 to 20 more minutes
25:54 - of person on the internet with a messy
25:57 - beard dancing and doing nothing
26:00 - [Music]
26:08 - shoot I lost track of what I was doing I
26:11 - yes
26:18 - okay here we go so I have with me what
26:30 - time is it
26:31 - ten o'clock just so everybody knows so
26:34 - in about a half an hour 45 minutes I
26:37 - will take a short break
26:38 - there's look like to take a break in the
26:41 - middle of my long session and then at
26:45 - noon I will be you believe it so I have
26:48 - a lot to stuff this afternoon planned so
26:50 - I've got to get out of here at noon
26:54 - Arnab asks is CNN on a hold by CNN we're
26:59 - talking about convolutional neural
27:00 - networks somewhat yes yes they answer
27:03 - this yes I talked a bit more about that
27:05 - earlier so you can scroll back in time
27:07 - if you want to find me talking about
27:09 - that okay so I think I have this I have
27:17 - the table of contents here which I'm
27:19 - gonna need and I have this all right and
27:29 - Oh hold on
27:41 - so how do I find I don't think I have it
27:46 - here we go and I have this okay so some
27:52 - of this stuff will just like make its
27:54 - way back into the playlist cuz I I have
27:56 - done updated physics library videos and
27:59 - updated genetic algorithms live videos
28:00 - and that sort of thing oh I'm not in the
28:03 - shoot I am NOT in this chat anymore okay
28:17 - I was not in the discord live supporter
28:21 - chat but now I am oh okay everybody
28:29 - let's just take a minute to relax
28:40 - Oh match you're probably not watching
28:44 - but I got to get the coating in the
28:46 - Cabana music that we use to have here
28:49 - this is what I always imagined it is
28:51 - it's not
29:02 - well I I wonder if it's that I have a
29:04 - larger viewership this morning than
29:06 - usual and I wonder if it's the topic or
29:10 - the time that's interesting to note okay
29:13 - all right I got everything I want to
29:18 - talk about so this first thing so okay
29:23 - so if you haven't watched me before it's
29:25 - a little bit of a strange thing that I
29:27 - do which is that these live sessions in
29:30 - many cases are what I what are recording
29:34 - sessions for things that will get edited
29:36 - and chunked into playlists and various
29:39 - other formats on the coding train so I
29:42 - do have a lot of redundant content and
29:44 - in some sense you might say to yourself
29:45 - I don't want to watch this person goof
29:48 - off and waste a lot of time and try
29:50 - things multiple times you could just
29:52 - wait for the edited content that would
29:54 - be my suggestion but this this is gonna
29:57 - be a bit maybe a bit more of even of an
29:59 - extreme version of that in the sense
30:01 - that I'm gonna try it like for example
30:02 - this first thing that I want to do is
30:04 - just record a video that's really no
30:06 - more than one minute long and I don't
30:08 - have a script or anything so I might try
30:10 - it a couple times which will be just
30:12 - sort of like a quick introduction to how
30:14 - I'm rebooting the nature of code
30:17 - playlist then I'm gonna look at the
30:20 - table of contents and figure out do I
30:22 - want to just go straight to making
30:23 - tutorials actually for chapter one but I
30:25 - just want to like take a quick peek at
30:27 - the table of contents to see if there's
30:29 - some stuff that I actually already have
30:30 - from the introduction that I can also do
30:35 - something with
30:39 - all right good morning all here we go
30:46 - let me go I want to get one more thing
30:50 - up cadenzas a code okay I will also call
30:56 - this up because I should acknowledge
30:58 - this but to some extent what I am doing
31:01 - is partially also available here you
31:05 - can't have too much nature of code in
31:07 - your life shouldn't be called the code
31:09 - of nature I think there's something
31:11 - already called that oh look at my Google
31:19 - power and actually even almost comes up
31:23 - I mean it comes up first this is an ad
31:25 - right or no this is some kind of like
31:27 - what it thinks we want to feature it
31:29 - snippet okay published Daniel I think
31:38 - it's spelled incorrectly I'm pretty sure
31:39 - it's sh ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii
31:47 - f and ay ay ay ay HH HH HH HH HH guess
31:56 - and proper spelling of my name just
31:58 - write write that down to get the number
32:01 - of e's right it's very important
32:09 - I can do this I think this is a nice I
32:16 - think I like the idea of like starting
32:19 - this with but you don't match yeah you
32:21 - we can replace the background so I'm
32:22 - actually not even gonna worry about that
32:24 - okay happy 2020 it is I me the person
32:41 - [Music]
32:57 - hello and happy 2020 it is me Dan from
33:01 - coding train here to launch a new
33:04 - learning playlist on YouTube called the
33:08 - nature of code that's what it says right
33:10 - here so this is not new content at all
33:12 - in fact this playlist that I'm about to
33:15 - embark upon is based on material that I
33:18 - started working on probably in 2008 and
33:21 - then published a book about which you
33:22 - can find online at nature of code calm
33:25 - in 2012 the book here that you're seeing
33:27 - is all is was written then and has
33:29 - largely not been updated uses processing
33:32 - which is a Java based creative coding
33:34 - environment and I am going to redo REI
33:37 - Mari in the process of rewriting the
33:39 - book to update things for 2020 as well
33:42 - as port a lot of detects all of the text
33:44 - and examples to JavaScript with p5.js so
33:50 - that's part of what I want to say
33:59 - so it's my dream that by the time you're
34:01 - watching this this will look totally
34:03 - different but this is where it is right
34:05 - now as I'm recording this in terms of
34:07 - what's already on the YouTube channel
34:09 - these are all of the videos most of
34:12 - these were actually recorded between 5 &
34:14 - 8 years ago the quality is is a little
34:16 - bit lower not good oh it's the best ever
34:19 - now but it's it's improved and so you
34:22 - can go back and watch these but largely
34:24 - what I'm going to do is go through a lot
34:25 - of these topics and redo these videos
34:27 - with new ways of thinking and new ideas
34:29 - and also JavaScript I should mention
34:33 - that some of the stuff I did update more
34:35 - recently like genetic algorithms and
34:36 - neural networks and physics libraries
34:38 - and little bits and pieces in here so
34:40 - there will be if you're following
34:41 - through this playlist there will be
34:42 - something like forward and backward in
34:44 - time of how things that when things have
34:45 - been recorded but hopefully it will all
34:47 - piece together with a nice narrative
35:00 - if you want to follow if you want to
35:04 - follow the work in progress as it's
35:06 - happening on if you want to follow the
35:12 - work if you want to follow the book
35:16 - being updated and the examples being
35:18 - updated as it's happening I'll refer you
35:20 - to the nature of code on github so here
35:23 - are all of the open source repositories
35:25 - for all of the raw material of the book
35:27 - so the book itself is an NOC book -
35:29 - there's a whole section there about the
35:31 - build process of the book which I'm
35:33 - really looking for help with if you're
35:34 - watching this please jump on in and help
35:36 - me out um there's the syllabus which is
35:39 - for course that I'm teaching at ITP New
35:42 - York University to school the arts
35:43 - there's the code for the website
35:45 - there's the processing examples there's
35:47 - the p5 just examples and there's even
35:48 - some Python examples as well and so all
35:51 - of this is stuff that I'm going to be
35:52 - working on and my goal is that sometime
35:55 - by the end of 2020 all of this will be
35:57 - complete this video series that is there
35:59 - in front of you will have be all filled
36:01 - out and we can all just have a little
36:04 - dance and be merry go merrily on our way
36:06 - let me also give a mention of cadenza
36:09 - which produced which I participated in
36:12 - producing an online course called the
36:14 - nature of code years ago a bunch of
36:16 - years ago as well that has a lot of
36:18 - video tutorials a lot of similar content
36:20 - this is also a nice resource a
36:21 - compliment to what I'm doing here as
36:23 - well so I probably should have mentioned
36:27 - what this is about hmm
36:34 - that's fine
36:41 - I'm trying to think look I didn't really
36:44 - bleed off of what this is about but
36:46 - that's fine
36:48 - well could I could redo this or we could
36:50 - edit it in a different order or or I
36:56 - could just do it right now
37:18 - introduction
37:29 - I probably should have mentioned what
37:32 - this is all about so this book is about
37:35 - looking at the world around us the
37:38 - natural world being inspired by it and
37:41 - trying to create software experiences
37:43 - interactive experiences inspired and
37:45 - based on those things so the table of
37:47 - contents has physics simulation so the
38:00 - first bit of advice that I might give
38:02 - you here in the words of George
38:03 - Washington Carver is go take a walk
38:06 - outside experience the world around you
38:08 - draw on that for how for when you build
38:11 - software and write code and they you
38:12 - know think about your humanity in our
38:17 - I'm trying to be profound not really
38:20 - working so the first bit of advice that
38:28 - I might give you like drawing on my cell
38:30 - face what's funny is like all my old
38:34 - videos just had all this stuff in them
38:36 - and I guess it's here on the live stream
38:37 - we really did enjoy that and edit all
38:39 - this stuff out but what can you do the
38:52 - first bit of advice I might have for you
38:54 - is I'm gonna get through this sentence
38:57 - the first bit of advice I might have for
38:59 - you and you know thinking of the words
39:00 - of George Washington Carver go take a
39:02 - walk outside experience the world around
39:04 - you be with people be with human beings
39:07 - enjoy nature and that might help really
39:10 - give you ideas an inspiration for what
39:12 - you might want to create when you sit
39:13 - down to code and that's really what this
39:15 - book is about for me you know fractal
39:17 - cellar automata autonomous agents of
39:19 - physics simulation genetic algorithms
39:21 - neural networks this happens to be a
39:23 - list of things that I'm going to go
39:26 - through step by step by step throughout
39:28 - this series but really there's so much
39:30 - more to the world that we live in than
39:32 - just that into outer space and beyond
39:35 - it's universe so I hope that as you
39:37 - watch this series you think beyond just
39:39 - what I have here create stuff and also
39:41 - share it with
39:42 - so stay tuned look in this video's
39:44 - description there's lots of ways if
39:45 - you're watching these videos that you
39:46 - can share projects you've made mostly on
39:49 - the coding train comm where I think
39:51 - that's where I'm gonna put stuff but
39:53 - there's just check the video description
39:54 - all that will be ironed out
39:56 - I gotta end this because this is really
39:57 - just a rambling introduction I want to
39:59 - get into the content I'm gonna come back
40:00 - and redo this anyway once all the videos
40:02 - are so hopefully this is like now you're
40:06 - watching this sometime in the future is
40:07 - like an interesting like historical
40:08 - footnote but thanks I've come with me on
40:12 - this journey nature of code and I can't
40:14 - I hope you enjoy it I'm gonna enjoy
40:16 - making it I know because I do enjoy this
40:18 - kind of stuff and I can't wait to see
40:21 - what you do
40:21 - good bye alright okay um so that's gonna
40:35 - be what I got for that okay so next
40:51 - so I think what I'm going to do since I
40:55 - have a lot of videos already is let me
41:00 - do a quick a quick hopefully not even 30
41:05 - seconds a quick 30 seconds just about
41:15 - the introduction and then the playlist
41:22 - is just going to have in it Perlin noise
41:23 - video and random walk videos and then
41:27 - I'll move on to vectors okay
41:32 - did you stick with me so now you're in
41:35 - the first section of the nature of code
41:37 - learning playlist and that section is
41:40 - the introduction so what's actually
41:41 - going to happen now if you keep watching
41:43 - is the next videos that pop up into your
41:45 - feed our videos that I made in the last
41:47 - several years about Perlin noise the
41:50 - history of perla noise and something
41:52 - called open simplex noise as well as
41:54 - random walks so this is really just
41:56 - meant to be a warm-up a way to get your
41:58 - like sort of like dip your toe into the
41:59 - water maybe I haven't programmed in
42:01 - p5.js with JavaScript or object-oriented
42:04 - programming in a while and so this will
42:06 - get you give you a bit of a sense of a
42:07 - little bit of a warm-up before I move on
42:09 - to the next chapter vectors so that's
42:13 - where I will be where inventors I'll be
42:14 - wearing these clothes because at this
42:16 - moment right now I have recordings going
42:18 - to next go talk about vectors but before
42:20 - I before you see me then oh this is so
42:23 - the space cut nature of code is really
42:26 - disrupting the space-time continuum
42:28 - before you see those you'll see a bunch
42:30 - of videos about perla noise and random
42:34 - walks which you can draw upon I think as
42:36 - a starting point for how you might want
42:38 - to start working with vectors
42:47 - this is working right oh boy hmm I don't
42:54 - know I'll come free do all this next
42:55 - week now okay I want to go back and look
43:15 - in my channel to see what all the videos
43:17 - I already have they can go in that
43:18 - playlist but I guess I'll do that on my
43:20 - own time not with you right here and so
43:23 - I can actually get into some real stuff
43:25 - here so the very first video
43:39 - and as my whiteboard operational is this
43:47 - camera crooked how crooked is it you're
43:50 - a crooked camera I have a have a level
44:01 - yeah it's pretty off so I needs to you
44:05 - think I would check these things before
44:06 - I start recording that's a little better
44:09 - I think I made it I don't know if I made
44:13 - it better or worse worse worse but worse
44:20 - the other way yeah oh this is good this
44:26 - is good
44:26 - that looks level okay
44:37 - okay
44:40 - where are we timewise 10:15 the nice
44:43 - thing about this stuff is I think
44:45 - something will I mean I shouldn't say
44:46 - this now because famous last words but
44:50 - unlike with a lot of machine learning
44:51 - stuff and some of the coding challenges
44:53 - where I can get you stuck for hours I
44:55 - know this material fairly well so I
44:58 - think I'm actually gonna be able to move
44:59 - through it fairly quickly but we'll see
45:02 - we'll see if that really holds true
45:11 - okay being told to brush my teeth brush
45:15 - my eye bruh shhhhht my teeth I brush my
45:18 - teeth mmm just maybe I had a little
45:23 - spinach in my breakfast which is healthy
45:26 - and maybe that a little piece but you
45:29 - really should be telling me to do is
45:30 - trim my beard and go get a haircut
45:31 - that's what my mother would say uh-huh
45:35 - all right what am i doing all right
45:43 - oh thank you this is actually David
45:48 - wrote I liked how these intros came out
45:50 - really pleases me because I feel very
45:53 - confused how to do this all right let me
46:03 - I want to open up an example
46:17 - actually I want to get the random Walker
46:19 - example okay let's go I have an idea I'm
46:25 - going to go to the random walk web
46:39 - editor so this is the code from and let
46:45 - me I'm gonna this is the code from the
46:46 - random walk challenge and if you will
46:49 - oblige I'm gonna just make this object
46:53 - oriented person object oriented you know
46:56 - what maybe I'm not gonna make it object
47:01 - oriented maybe I will leave it as such
47:05 - okay that's fine because this is where
47:07 - it left off
47:21 - ah I saved over it hold on I think it
47:27 - should be okay now duplicate
47:37 - know how to name these
47:49 - okay
47:54 - I'll leave this up anymore
48:00 - actually just out of curiosity how did I
48:03 - do this before vectors P vector class
48:05 - vector math vector math to acceleration
48:07 - yeah all right
48:08 - I mean that's probably what I'm going to
48:10 - do again okay
48:23 - welcome to nature of code chapter 1
48:26 - vectors so the poor purpose the
48:29 - pointless
48:37 - welcome to nature of code chapter 1
48:40 - vectors so the purpose of this first
48:43 - video is just to explain what a vector
48:46 - is what is a vector as well as look at
48:52 - what it means to use the concept of a
48:55 - vector with p5.js hold on a sec
49:14 - now if you watched now if you watch some
49:18 - of the videos in the introduction
49:19 - section one of the examples I went
49:22 - through is a random walk this is a
49:25 - single point x and y in this example I
49:30 - have two variables x and y together they
49:34 - make up a position in the canvas and
49:36 - then every cycle through draw every
49:39 - frame of animation I pick a random
49:40 - number 0 1 2 & 3 and move it either to
49:43 - the right the left up or down this is
49:46 - using vectors so the concept of a vector
49:55 - is something you're probably using all
49:57 - the time in your programming without
49:59 - realizing it but maybe you're not
50:01 - actually getting full power out of
50:04 - vectors because you're not yet using p5
50:06 - dot vector so that's really where I'm
50:11 - leading here but let's zoom back out and
50:14 - talk about what a vector is so first let
50:17 - me use another term for you
50:20 - scalar so scalar might sound like some
50:25 - scary math terminology that you seems
50:27 - unfamiliar to you but this is actually
50:29 - saying you have definitely been using
50:30 - all along
50:31 - for example here is an example of a
50:34 - scalar value 6 oh I've got another one
50:38 - for you 14 zero point three one nine two
50:43 - two two two that's my favorite scalar so
50:46 - a scalar is a numeric value a single
50:50 - value it is a magnitude so the concept
50:53 - here is something is a is something that
50:55 - has a magnitude
51:01 - for example the my height is a scalar
51:05 - value my weight is a scalar value you
51:09 - know I want to use height and weight as
51:10 - an example so for example the really
51:26 - stuck here
51:28 - so for example the length of this marker
51:32 - is a scalar value the weight of this
51:35 - marker is a scalar value anything that
51:38 - you can measure in a magnitude in a
51:39 - single number is a scalar
51:46 - a vector is something that has is a
51:52 - vector is an entity that has not just
51:56 - magnitude but also direction this is the
52:05 - idea of a vector now I should preface
52:08 - all of this by saying that vectors are
52:10 - things oh this I should prep I should
52:14 - preface this by saying that the concept
52:16 - of a vector extends into many many many
52:19 - dimensionality yeah oh I shouldn't say
52:24 - wait oh I should have said wait I have
52:27 - to go all the way back I have to go all
52:30 - the way back I should have said wait
52:31 - thank you thank you thank you I'm so
52:33 - glad I'm doing this live that was like
52:35 - the worst thing I could have possibly
52:37 - done thank you thank you thank you chat
52:39 - Thank You chat Thank You chat I owe you
52:44 - my life I owe you the fact that I will
52:48 - not eventually have to see ten thousand
52:50 - comments and remake all these videos
52:52 - forever and ever and ever
52:54 - don't say wait don't say wait don't say
52:55 - wait don't say wait don't say wait don't
52:58 - say wait don't say wait wait don't say
53:02 - wait
53:11 - what are some other good examples the
53:15 - length of something the volume of
53:18 - something oh the number of you know the
53:23 - like I could I could like count like the
53:25 - number of things I have in a pile what
53:29 - are some other good examples
53:47 - the chat is too far behind me size area
53:50 - volume okay
53:51 - yeah area is good distance oh thank you
53:54 - distance distance it's such a good thing
53:55 - all right I thank you Oh time that's
53:59 - good okay
54:11 - examples of a scalar value are things
54:14 - that you can I lost my home momentum
54:17 - here but that's my temperature that's
54:19 - good thank you thank you chat
54:32 - examples of things that are scaler are
54:34 - things that you can measure like the the
54:37 - length of this marker the distance
54:39 - between me and you wherever you are all
54:41 - are in the world is a that's a scaler
54:45 - but like I you could also make it a
54:46 - vector it's not distance isn't about
54:49 - your distance is a scaler I've got to
54:51 - get back I've gotta get going back into
54:53 - this examples of scalar quantities are
54:58 - things like the length of this marker
55:00 - the volume of the area area is good Oh
55:07 - use my coding train oh examples
55:12 - examples of things that are scalar
55:13 - quantities are like oh the length of
55:15 - this marker maybe the surface area of
55:18 - this beautiful coding training notebook
55:21 - [Music]
55:22 - temperature how many what is it what how
55:25 - hot it is how hot is it outside whether
55:27 - it's Fahrenheit or Celsius or Kelvin
55:28 - that's a scalar quantity the distance
55:31 - between two points how far away in the
55:33 - world are you from me right now
55:35 - that's a scalar quantity anything that
55:37 - you can measure as a single magnitude
55:39 - that is a scalar a vector is something
55:43 - that is both magnitude not both not both
55:49 - a distances yeah displacement distances
55:57 - of distances a scalar
55:59 - now we can think of how I will get I'll
56:03 - kind of clarify that a vector however
56:09 - has not just magnitude
56:17 - nann dude but also directions this is
56:24 - the idea of a vector it's a quantity an
56:29 - entity that has both a magnitude and a
56:32 - direction one thing that's important for
56:35 - me to say is vectors can exist in many
56:38 - kinds of dimensional spaces two
56:40 - dimensional space three dimensional
56:42 - space four dimensional dimensional we
56:46 - can keep going but this it and and you
56:50 - might have heard me say the term vector
56:51 - in other videos that I made maybe about
56:53 - machine learning and data but what I'm
56:56 - going to do in this series is constrain
57:00 - myself restrict myself to talking about
57:03 - vectors in a two dimensional space this
57:08 - is because I am working with them in a
57:11 - p5.js canvas and that happens to be a
57:14 - two dimensional space you might want to
57:17 - use the concept of vector in three
57:19 - dimensions because you might choose and
57:23 - I might do some examples that look at
57:24 - vectors in three dimensions and in fact
57:26 - p5 vectors do support three dimensions
57:29 - 3d graphics or a thing but my focus and
57:32 - trying to explain all of this and look
57:33 - at the math will be sticking in two
57:35 - dimensions yeah
57:55 - the typical way a vector is tip the
58:01 - typical way a vector is what am I trying
58:04 - to say
58:05 - visualized or 10:30 15 minutes I'm
58:08 - taking a break I'm trying to stick to my
58:09 - schedule represented that's the word I'm
58:21 - looking for
58:22 - the typical way a vector is represented
58:25 - is by an arrow so let me return back to
58:30 - this random walk example and look at
58:33 - this I had an X and a Y and then X and Y
58:35 - is moving randomly drawing its trail how
58:39 - could I think of that x and y as a
58:41 - vector I had two variables x and y they
58:50 - represent a point in space two
58:53 - dimensional space x and y I could think
58:57 - of these this x and y together as a
59:01 - vector that provides instructions for
59:03 - how to get from the origin point zero
59:06 - zero all the way to that x and y so this
59:10 - is the idea of thinking in terms of
59:13 - vectors this entity this this entity
59:18 - this entity this vector has both a
59:21 - magnitude that is its length how long is
59:26 - the vector this entity this vector has
59:42 - both a magnitude what is the magnitude
59:45 - it is the length of this arrow and a
59:49 - direction what is the direction it's the
59:51 - way the arrow is pointing and I could
59:54 - think of that in different ways but one
59:56 - way of thinking about that is as an
59:57 - angle often represented with the Greek
59:59 - letter theta so I could think of a
60:01 - vector as the length of an arrow as well
60:05 - as what direction is it's pointing as an
60:08 - angle relative to you know the origin
60:11 - point
60:20 - I know some people in that chatter
60:22 - saying a coordinate is a vector well so
60:27 - there's a couple things I want to say
60:28 - about this
60:37 - now probably this were now probably the
60:41 - canonical example of a vector is the
60:46 - concept of velocity the velocity of an
60:54 - object
61:05 - yeah
61:12 - so maybe I don't want to address that
61:13 - right now because I want to get I'm
61:17 - gonna get into this in a little bit I
61:20 - will mention this thing about is a
61:22 - coordinate really a vector I will give
61:24 - you my take on that I don't want to give
61:33 - so conceptually so conceptually I'm
61:40 - talking about this vector as this arrow
61:42 - and the arrow has both the length
61:46 - magnitude and the direction let me take
61:59 - a minute to redo this diagram in a more
62:00 - traditional math way because canvases
62:04 - are a little strange in that the origin
62:06 - is in the top-left and that Y points
62:08 - down but a more typical Cartesian plane
62:12 - a 2-dimensional plane cartesian named
62:14 - for a guy named a the mathematician
62:17 - might have an XY coordinate right here
62:20 - and i could represent and the origin
62:22 - right here and i could draw an arrow
62:24 - between these two so conceptually the
62:30 - vector has the magnitude which is this
62:33 - particular length and the direction
62:35 - which represented by this angle relative
62:38 - to the horizontal axis
62:51 - however I am conflating a little bit two
62:55 - concepts which is this idea of a
62:57 - coordinate or a position and a vector
62:59 - this idea of this vector itself the
63:02 - concept of this vector is just this
63:04 - arrow it doesn't represent any specific
63:08 - location in two-dimensional space it
63:11 - just represents instructions for how to
63:13 - get from one position to another
63:15 - position and in the case that I'm
63:18 - talking about those instructions are
63:20 - from the origin to the position X Y so
63:23 - in a moment I'm gonna start talking
63:25 - about velocity which is going to be used
63:28 - in our code to describe well if this is
63:30 - my thing at this X Y it's gonna go here
63:33 - then it's gonna go here then it's gonna
63:34 - go here then it's gonna go here I might
63:36 - have a bunch of velocity vectors giving
63:38 - it a path this idea of the vector itself
63:41 - is really a concept of the arrow not the
63:45 - specific location but a position in a p5
63:49 - sketch can be thought of as a vector
63:51 - with instructions from how to get to the
63:53 - origin to that XY location itself and in
64:01 - that sense it really is relative because
64:03 - if I use the translate function to move
64:05 - the origin around that vector is going
64:06 - to kind of move around with that so
64:12 - hopefully that addresses it
64:26 - Simon is saying is that actually a quote
64:35 - from an actual three blue one brown
64:36 - video or are you Simon just reminisce is
64:39 - is giving me is writing in the discord
64:42 - chat about different ways to describe a
64:45 - vector with physics computer science and
64:46 - machine learning and with just sort of
64:48 - like more theoretical math now
64:57 - interestingly enough even though I am
64:59 - talking about vectors as part with this
65:02 - core idea of magnitude in fluently
65:06 - oddly enough even though I am starting
65:09 - this discussion off about vectors
65:11 - focusing on these core concepts
65:13 - magnitude and direction the actual
65:16 - values stored in the p5 vector object
65:20 - which I really haven't shown you yet but
65:22 - I'm going to get to are not the
65:24 - magnitude and direction but rather the
65:26 - components of a vector what do I mean by
65:28 - components well that I actually mean
65:31 - these this.x and this.y because in fact
65:35 - look at this arrow here I can make this
65:39 - into a little bit of a triangle and
65:43 - imagine the y equals three right the Y
65:47 - value is three go up by three the x
65:49 - value is four go across by four x equals
65:55 - four y equals 3 the vector the vector is
66:01 - actually 4 comma 3
66:08 - the data stored with the vector are
66:11 - actually these numbers 4:3 and I could
66:13 - choose to write them in different ways I
66:20 - could say 4 comma 3 or I could write
66:25 - these sort of brackets and write 4 3
66:27 - like that so in many cases more
66:29 - generically a vector is actually just a
66:31 - list of numbers it's a list of
66:33 - components and if I were in two
66:38 - dimensions I would have two numbers
66:40 - three dimensions three numbers four
66:41 - dimensions four numbers etc etc and this
66:43 - again comes up more in machine learning
66:46 - and data science but in the concept of
66:51 - physics I'm really thinking about this
66:54 - two-dimensional space with just an X and
66:56 - a Y and incidentally I will ask you the
66:58 - question what is the magnitude of this
67:01 - vector think about that for a second
67:04 - maybe you've heard of a 3 4 5 triangle
67:07 - right if one side of a right triangle
67:10 - with a 90 degree angle is 3 the other
67:13 - side is 4 the hypotenuse of that
67:15 - triangle is 5 so one of the things
67:17 - you'll discover as I do more videos
67:18 - about different vector math is a lot of
67:21 - the math with vectors particularly in
67:23 - two-dimensional space that is relates to
67:25 - trigonometry and trigonometry and all
67:34 - the same math associated with right
67:36 - triangles
67:43 - Oh so three blue one brown has a video
67:46 - called vectors what even are they
67:48 - essence of linear algebra chapter one
67:50 - got it okay so we are moving along here
68:08 - I'm almost done with this video
68:10 - oh I don't have it there's nothing in
68:17 - here I take it that means it's time for
68:18 - me to take a break I lost had all these
68:22 - viewers all left once I started talking
68:24 - about vectors what's going on or do
68:26 - people just have to go to work or
68:28 - something or go to sleep
68:29 - I feel like nobody-nobody in my time
68:31 - zone watch just these videos it's either
68:33 - people are watching them because it's
68:34 - early in the morning for them or the
68:36 - late at night for them
68:39 - okay Oh Alicia ray writes I'm in linear
68:45 - algebra this semester I might go check
68:47 - that out you definitely should if you're
68:50 - looking for if you are if you are
68:54 - looking for helpful videos about
68:58 - mathematics
68:59 - I find the three blue one Brown Channel
69:01 - I mean okay I didn't weigh like I feel
69:03 - like oh my God all I ever do on the
69:05 - coding train is talk about three so and
69:08 - in fact my hilbert curve video comes out
69:10 - I'm talking about three blue one brown
69:11 - but it's really hard to find a better
69:14 - resource for understanding really calm
69:18 - sophisticated topics in mathematics in a
69:21 - delightful visual way it might not be
69:24 - the way that everybody learns but for me
69:25 - and I think a lot of people those kinds
69:28 - of explanations are just amazing okay
69:32 - thank you for assignment for clarifying
69:35 - on that all right and and David writes
69:36 - n-dimensional vector math is mostly trig
69:39 - expanded into the n dimension which is
69:40 - true Kevin from Baltimore go o's next
69:45 - years the year yes Baltimore in the
69:50 - house okay
69:53 - any video Farhan I do have a video on a
69:57 - star okay I got it got off track
70:02 - I'm gonna finish this off and then take
70:04 - a short break
70:14 - reference
70:21 - I'm just gonna hit a create vector
70:25 - whoa this is not oh it is that is so
70:29 - weird
70:31 - I think this okay so this is fine but I
70:34 - would suggest I've never noticed this
70:36 - maybe there's a good reason that I'm not
70:38 - thinking of this seems like a really
70:39 - weird example to have as the thing that
70:43 - pops up on the create vector reference
70:45 - page like it's the second argument of
70:47 - the point light function that's creating
70:49 - a victor based off of sign of Millie's
70:51 - hoof I don't know if anybody wants to
70:56 - file an issue about this or to probably
71:01 - be five website repo I guess but I kind
71:04 - of actually I'm gonna I'm not gonna I'm
71:05 - gonna move to a different page let's
71:07 - just try let's try this one
71:11 - yes so frankly I would suggest this just
71:16 - go on the create vector page Euclidian
71:21 - ah that's good okay
71:27 - my a star was buggy
71:32 - welcome to the coding train where you
71:37 - have one an example code with lots of
71:40 - bugs in it have fun when you apply it to
71:44 - your project the bugs will still be
71:46 - there and as part of your learning
71:48 - experience you can fix those bugs
71:53 - [Music]
72:04 - alright here we go
72:17 - [Applause]
72:20 - [Music]
72:35 - so first
72:40 - returning back to the random walker
72:42 - example we can look at this once again
72:44 - no not once again returning back to the
72:51 - random walker example we can look at
72:53 - this again the God again again for the
72:58 - first time now for the first time return
73:05 - returning back to the random walker
73:07 - example we can look at this with a new
73:08 - lens with a new view on outlook on life
73:11 - well like that outlook on life returning
73:16 - back to this random walker example we
73:18 - can look at with a new outlook on life
73:19 - and that is vectors instead of having
73:22 - and this is really the first thing when
73:24 - you're starting to program with p5
73:26 - vector you're already this is already
73:28 - using the concept of vectors in the way
73:30 - that I described it to you but I want to
73:32 - rewrite this now with p5 vector so
73:40 - here's the reference page for p5 vector
73:43 - I encourage you to click over and check
73:45 - it out and read through it p f-- o
73:50 - actually yeah
73:57 - so many things I want to do so many
73:59 - things I want to do in this video so I'm
74:05 - thinking about the order of this but so
74:11 - here I need to go ate some water I got
74:14 - like a frog in my throat but I don't I
74:17 - want to finish this before I take a
74:18 - break there's nothing left in this okay
74:33 - [Music]
74:41 - okay
74:46 - here is the reference page on the p5
74:48 - website for p5 dot vector now it's a
74:50 - little strange that there's this thing
74:52 - called p5 dot vector maybe I can return
74:54 - back to that in a moment a little bit
74:56 - but what I want to highlight for you is
74:58 - this right here create vector the
75:01 - function create vector is what makes an
75:03 - object in p5 that is a vector object a
75:07 - p5 dr. and when you create a vector you
75:10 - give it two values an x and a y it also
75:13 - can optionally take a third for an XYZ
75:16 - but again I'm not making use of the
75:18 - third dimension right now so the first
75:20 - thing beyond all the fun interesting new
75:24 - vector math that I will explore is just
75:26 - replacing my old XY variables with one
75:29 - variable that is a p5 vector going into
75:34 - the code I'll comment this out and I
75:37 - will say I'm gonna say pause for
75:39 - position and then here and set up I'm
75:44 - going to say position equals create
75:47 - vector and the X is with divided by 2
75:50 - the Y is height divided by 2 I want to
75:56 - draw that point at pause dot X and pause
76:01 - da and while this random walker and
76:06 - while this code this random Walker code
76:09 - is is based on the sort of core idea of
76:11 - a random walker that can only go in four
76:13 - different directions up down left and
76:16 - right
76:22 - I want to instead simplify this and just
76:27 - let X&Y change by any random
76:29 - floating-point number between negative 1
76:31 - and 1 as well
76:34 - so to do that I'll say Paz dot x equals
76:37 - positive x plus random negative 1 1 same
76:46 - for y wait sorry
76:49 - same for y and I'm gonna run the sketch
77:02 - weird where does that error come from oh
77:04 - whoops
77:09 - and I'm gonna run this sketch
77:21 - so step one of working with vectors in
77:24 - p5 is go and find something you once
77:27 - made that had separate X and y variables
77:29 - and see if you could use create vector
77:31 - instead for them yeah go ahead do that
77:35 - now I'll wait
77:42 - step two I would say is that I want to
77:46 - start building a foundation for a
77:48 - physics engine ultimately through all of
77:51 - these chapter 1 videos and chapter 2
77:53 - videos by the end of all of them I'm
77:55 - going to have a very rudimentary physics
77:58 - engine that I can build a lot more
78:00 - projects on top of it will also serve as
78:03 - a kind of foundation of knowledge and
78:06 - understanding to use more sophisticated
78:08 - and robust physics engines from other
78:10 - libraries that's kind of the point of
78:11 - where this all is going but in order to
78:13 - do that I want to make heavy use of
78:15 - object-oriented programming so if you've
78:17 - never done object-oriented programming
78:19 - before or worked with classes in
78:21 - JavaScript a class being a template for
78:23 - creating an object then I might refer
78:25 - you to go back to my beginner coding
78:27 - videos where there's a whole section on
78:29 - object-oriented programming but for
78:31 - right now just to kind of recap that I'm
78:33 - going to very quickly create a walker
78:35 - object so instead of having a position
78:39 - variable that's just in the global space
78:41 - I'm going to make a walker class and
78:43 - create a walker object that is in the
78:45 - global space
78:52 - so
78:54 - also to keep things organized and this
78:56 - is just sort of my style I'm gonna make
78:57 - a separate JavaScript file for Walker
79:07 - then I'll write it as a class with a
79:15 - constructor function that will receive
79:17 - an x and a y it will have one variable a
79:22 - position
79:35 - so this is where I'm starting the Walker
79:37 - is essentially a rapper a rapper so this
79:45 - is where I'm beginning the Walker is
79:47 - essentially an object that stores that
79:49 - one vector position and I've got to use
79:51 - that this dot syntax because the
79:53 - position is the
80:09 - the Walker class has one piece of data
80:12 - associated with it the position vector
80:15 - and I use the this dot sequence so that
80:17 - the position is an instance variable
80:19 - that's part of the Walker object itself
80:23 - what does the Walker do it walks so I
80:26 - could call that step or walk or update
80:28 - I'm gonna use the the name update I'm
80:30 - gonna write a function and I'm gonna
80:31 - grab the code that I have here bring it
80:36 - in to Walker J s and what am I missing
80:49 - [Music]
80:51 - now that I have the position vector as
80:53 - part of the Walker class I need to refer
80:55 - to the position as this dot position
80:57 - which at some point is going to create
80:59 - some messy looking not missing which at
81:01 - some point is going to create some
81:02 - awkward looking longer winded code but
81:04 - we're gonna live with that and then I
81:06 - think I'm gonna have a show function for
81:08 - drawing the Walker I will grab this code
81:13 - that draws the point this dot
81:21 - and now I have my Walker class complete
81:24 - it the constructor creates a position
81:26 - vector the update function updates the
81:28 - X&Y position and the show function draws
81:31 - the position back into sketch I'm going
81:37 - to make the variable now called Walker
81:41 - in setup call the constructor with with
81:50 - / - with with an initial position with
81:53 - an initial position of 200 200
81:57 - and then in draw update and I think I
82:06 - forgot the stroke and all of that as
82:08 - part of its show function put that back
82:13 - in and now oops what do I have wrong oh
82:16 - I forgot to reference Walker J s in
82:20 - index.html and there we go
82:26 - I have exactly the same random Walker
82:37 - so this brings me to the end of this
82:40 - first video about what is a vector and
82:42 - using p5 vector in your code in your
82:45 - JavaScript code in p5.js but I have
82:48 - really barely scratched the surface I'm
82:50 - not doing anything other than thinking
82:52 - of this p5 vector as a place to hold the
82:56 - X&Y variable I really want to start
82:58 - thinking about this concept of a vector
83:00 - more I really want to start thinking
83:04 - about this concept of a vector more
83:06 - formally and start to think well if I
83:08 - have a position to erase all this
83:18 - I really want to start thinking about
83:22 - this concept of a vector more formally
83:24 - and if I have a position represented as
83:29 - a vector pointing from the origin to the
83:32 - XY location where I'm drawing something
83:34 - then couldn't that object that has that
83:37 - position also have a velocity
83:42 - representing as an arrow that's moving
83:45 - its current position to its next
83:47 - position in my animation and maybe I
83:50 - could have also something called an
83:51 - acceleration which is a vector that
83:56 - which in the same which in the same way
84:03 - that velocity is changing the position
84:05 - over time the acceleration is changing
84:08 - the velocity over time and I've heard
84:11 - about this thing called a force
84:13 - maybe there's something like Newton's
84:15 - laws and physics and motion and things
84:18 - that are at rest and they stay at rest
84:19 - and all that stuff could I somehow take
84:21 - this concept of a force maybe you've
84:24 - heard of this equation force equals mass
84:27 - times acceleration could that play a
84:29 - role in how acceleration is calculated
84:33 - which changes velocity which changes
84:35 - position and so these are the
84:36 - foundational elements of a physics
84:38 - engine and I am going to build all of
84:42 - those slowly bit by pit while talking
84:44 - about different mathematical operations
84:47 - with vectors and that's what you'll see
84:48 - in the next few videos in the next few
84:50 - videos all throughout chapter one and
84:51 - chapter two so if you're interested just
84:54 - keep on I don't know if they're there
84:56 - right now but when they're there they'll
84:58 - be there and you can watch them I'm
85:00 - making them in these clothes or a
85:02 - different clothes depending which day
85:03 - and recording them goodbye
85:12 - alright alright everyone
85:15 - so that is who I've kicked this off oh
85:17 - I'm so happy I'm getting I'm getting
85:19 - some momentum here because I feel like
85:21 - if I can get some momentum I might go
85:23 - just like pop into the studio and just
85:26 - like oh I have an hour free let me just
85:27 - do the next one and the next one some of
85:29 - those by the way I will probably do as
85:31 - member-only livestreams just cuz but as
85:35 - a as a benefit for members all the
85:38 - edited content will of course make its
85:41 - way out to the channel but but yeah so
85:50 - I'm not done for today I have another
85:51 - hour left but I'm gonna take a short
85:54 - break and talk to you about briefly also
85:59 - thank my friends over at dashlane who
86:03 - are the sponsor of today's coding train
86:05 - Kony train would not really be possible
86:06 - all of the people who work on editing
86:08 - and everything and all the stuff that
86:10 - I'm putting out there it cost money and
86:11 - having sponsors is a really wonderful
86:13 - thing that I can't have the opportunity
86:15 - for to help me keep this project going
86:17 - and dashlane is a password manager and
86:22 - so if you'll I have something to show
86:25 - you which is this so if you have you
86:29 - know if your life feels very
86:30 - inconvenient and you can't manage all
86:32 - these passwords I mean how many things
86:34 - have I had to log into just on this
86:36 - livestream alone the web editor github I
86:38 - had to log in to a whole lot of stuff
86:39 - that I had to turn my screen off because
86:40 - I didn't want all this other private
86:42 - stuff showing up and so I I'm I having a
86:44 - password manager I can actually have
86:46 - different passwords for absolutely
86:47 - everything you can also store credit
86:50 - card information and so Biggs checking
86:52 - out and paying stuff online so much so
86:55 - much easier and so you know there are
87:02 - solutions like keychain and chrome have
87:04 - this but you get locked into a single
87:05 - system and all of your passwords are
87:07 - trapped in one place you know you have
87:09 - to watch out for other solutions like
87:11 - log in with Facebook with that that you
87:12 - know you might be at risk of your data
87:14 - being misused and sold so - Lee never
87:17 - has access to your personal data and
87:18 - won't trick you into subscribing there's
87:20 - no credit card
87:21 - to sign up - Layne cannot see your data
87:23 - and it is an ad-free product so if you
87:27 - can fill out forms fast with one-click
87:29 - logins and auto fills and here's the
87:31 - other thing that I really love about
87:32 - using a password manager is that it
87:35 - works across all devices so I'm always
87:39 - logging the stuff on my phone or a
87:40 - tablet or the laptop or then I'm on this
87:42 - treatmen computer and this computer so I
87:45 - can have basically everything stored in
87:47 - a way that I can log in and then when
87:49 - I'm you know when I'm somewhere at a
87:52 - public computer and I need my password I
87:53 - can just pull out my phone and grab it
87:55 - so that particular is really useful it
87:58 - is used by 11 million users in 180
88:02 - countries endorsed by The Wall Street
88:03 - Journal New York Times Fast Company
88:04 - Forbes Wired and more top rated on the
88:06 - iOS App Store and a recommended app by
88:09 - both Apple and Google so if you are
88:13 - interested in giving it a try you can go
88:15 - to - late comm slash coding training
88:17 - that lets them know that you found out
88:18 - about it from here you can sign up for
88:20 - free this will give you a 30 day free
88:22 - trial of the premium features and then
88:24 - you can also 'if you were to choose to
88:26 - purchase that get 10% off so I'm gonna
88:28 - take a short break
88:29 - a little intermission and if you feel so
88:32 - inclined you can use that time to sign
88:33 - up for - Lane otherwise we'll be back in
88:35 - about five minutes with more I'm gonna
88:39 - do just like probably one or two more
88:41 - quick tutorials about p5 vectors okay
88:45 - how do I do this I go to my intromission
88:48 - button I put on this music and I mute my
88:52 - microphone and go get some water and
88:55 - breathe in some oxygen see you soon
89:01 - [Music]
89:32 - sorry I just had the mic muted I'm all
89:34 - messed up now it says intermission
89:36 - excellent okay see you soon

96:02 - this star this star the star this starts
96:04 - I'll never forget the Vista but somebody
96:07 - composed that song for me okay here I am
96:10 - back thank you again to - lean and I'm
96:15 - ready to continue this vector stuff come
96:18 - back in full energy oh no no no no for
96:21 - very low energy
96:24 - I actually do feel quite a bit tired in
96:27 - a way like I do feel like maybe what
96:29 - might make sense I'm not really prepared
96:33 - to do this right now and I and I and
96:34 - since I have a kind of I have to be
96:36 - finished at noon I don't think I'm gonna
96:37 - do this but I could imagine a world
96:41 - where I if I do a two and A two to
96:43 - two-and-a-half hour live stream where
96:45 - the first hour is the nature of code
96:47 - tutorials and then the second hour is a
96:49 - coding challenge so maybe that's
96:50 - something that I can consider I know a
96:52 - lot of people especially David have
96:54 - helped with this wheel spinning thing
96:56 - I've been working on I just haven't been
96:58 - able to get rid spin the wheel though
97:00 - for the next coding in the Cabana video
97:02 - since that's coming out tomorrow maybe I
97:04 - can do that is the noise suppression
97:06 - gone the noise suppression was never on
97:12 - so I don't know why that's something it
97:15 - would have changed it might just be
97:16 - louder in here there's like the air is
97:18 - kind of come on stronger
97:26 - okay go have a walk all right but I'm I
97:33 - do have so I lost my momentum by taking
97:35 - a break I feel kind of tired but I can
97:37 - get it back I regularly teach three hour
97:39 - classes so I don't know why and
97:42 - regularly and not regularly but I have
97:44 - done longer live streams but here we go
97:46 - okay so I think what I want to cover
97:54 - next is
97:56 - [Music]
98:05 - I don't know if I really want to do a
98:08 - general video about just vector math I
98:13 - feel like I'd rather have it come up as
98:16 - I build the examples so I think that's
98:21 - what I'm gonna keep going
98:33 - yeah
98:38 - oh all right
98:54 - all right
98:57 - I just see the last comment of the chat
99:00 - so let's get to it already
99:02 - it doesn't really motivate me to get
99:03 - started okay Adrian asks have you ever
99:10 - drank energy drinks I don't think that I
99:12 - should be having energy drinks I think
99:14 - my regular level of energy you know a
99:17 - little caffeine never hurts I like I
99:20 - enjoy caffeine just as much as the next
99:22 - person but any other amount of anything
99:26 - that's going to boost energy is just
99:28 - gonna cause me to there's like a little
99:31 - like teetering teetering teetering and I
99:33 - don't want to take another step oh maybe
99:37 - I could do a quick example the dot
99:38 - product projection
99:39 - Oh Joseph Clayton I am not that far
99:42 - along yet that is definitely part of
99:45 - this whole discussion but that that that
99:51 - I think is above and beyond where I am
99:53 - currently in terms of this material
99:54 - there
100:02 - okay I need to what I do need to do on
100:06 - if I'm live starting the morning is eat
100:08 - a bigger breakfast exactly marchello
100:13 - says dangerous
100:15 - just call me don't call me thank you to
100:25 - random hamster with your donation you
100:32 - have won me talking about vector
100:36 - addition all right we're how to begin
100:52 - this
100:58 - all right I know what to do I got it
101:12 - welcome back to the second video in
101:15 - Chapter 1 about vectors in p5.js hi so I
101:20 - could go in a number of different
101:21 - directions here and I'm still sort of
101:23 - figuring out what direction was good
101:24 - right now but ostensibly if you're
101:26 - looking following the nature of codebook
101:28 - along with these videos the next topic
101:30 - is really looking at vector math what
101:32 - are the kinds of operations that you
101:35 - might be used to doing with scalar
101:37 - quantities five plus two equals seven
101:40 - five minus two equals three x square
101:44 - root power of three all of these kinds
101:47 - of mathematical operations those
101:49 - mathematical operations exist for
101:51 - vectors as well
101:52 - and a lot of times it's as simple as
101:54 - vector addition is the same as scalar
101:57 - addition but you just add the X's and
101:58 - you add the Y's and that's really where
102:00 - I'm gonna start but what I think I
102:02 - prefer to do is rather than go through a
102:04 - laundry list which is how the book does
102:08 - this to a bit more extent of of vector
102:11 - math one at a time I'm going to take the
102:14 - next step in the random Locker example
102:17 - and discover what kinds of vector math I
102:20 - need as I'm going and start to talk
102:23 - about the different functions vector
102:24 - math functions I need as I get to them
102:26 - so but you might want to look and sort
102:29 - of wonder like what are all the things
102:31 - that I can do with vectors and one of
102:33 - the reasons to use the p5 vector class
102:36 - beyond just your own x and y variables
102:38 - is that all of these common operations
102:40 - exist as functions in the p5 vector
102:43 - class itself like add subtract multiply
102:46 - divide magnitude magnitude squared dot
102:49 - product cross product distance
102:51 - normalized limit heading rotate so many
102:53 - so many things so I expect that over the
102:56 - course of many many videos throughout
102:58 - this whole series I will get to a lot of
103:00 - these but you also might just take a
103:02 - moment to pause and click through and
103:03 - look at some of these yourself okay
103:17 - all right
103:42 - I'm sorry I'm just enjoying the chat I'm
103:43 - reading it but not reading it loud I'm
103:45 - just enjoying it to myself I want to
103:50 - show you my hilbert Dilbert curb thing
103:52 - that I made before I leave I'll show you
103:56 - a little a little teaser little teaser
103:57 - of the hilbert curve video that's coming
103:59 - out tomorrow one thing I like about
104:02 - doing these coding in the Cabana videos
104:04 - is I love all the stuff that I do and
104:07 - but sometimes it feels a little bit like
104:08 - okay Here I am releasing a new video
104:10 - that's the same thing that I did two
104:11 - weeks ago livestream so I do like the
104:14 - fact that it's like it hasn't no one's
104:15 - seen it yet and if you're thinking about
104:17 - joining as a member I will share it
104:20 - hopefully you know we're kind of like
104:21 - getting into the it's gonna be like up
104:23 - it's gonna be ready like a bit
104:25 - last-minute but I try to I would
104:26 - actually I definitely want to share it
104:28 - with the members first in case there's
104:30 - like a glaring error in it which none of
104:31 - us Swift's or working on and have caught
104:37 - okay do I like corn cakes no but I do
104:44 - Stan the king cake baby and if you
104:48 - happen to know what I'm talking about
104:49 - the fact that I stand the king cake baby
104:52 - as you know that reference you know you
104:57 - can at me
105:00 - Gen X here I'm really really really
105:05 - doing a good job okay
105:20 - so in the random Walker example there
105:22 - happens to be some vector math going on
105:25 - I am taking the X component of the
105:27 - position vector the Y component of the
105:29 - position vector and adding a random
105:30 - number to it
105:40 - so let's start by discussing vector
105:44 - addition
106:00 - let's say I have two vectors and often
106:02 - in a let's say have two vectors and in
106:08 - math textbook scenario often vectors are
106:11 - written as y-a let's say that I have two
106:16 - vectors we'll call them U and V actually
106:18 - you know that's a very the U and V the
106:20 - way I write U and V it always looks too
106:22 - similar let's just call them a and b
106:24 - vector a and vector B and vector
106:27 - notation that you might see in a your
106:28 - math textbook often uses the arrow on
106:32 - top of the letter to say this this
106:34 - represents the vector a this represents
106:37 - the vector B and let's say the vector a
106:39 - is 3 comma 4 and let's say the vector B
106:44 - is I don't know 2 comma negative 1 I
106:51 - want to examine what do I mean when I
106:54 - say vector A plus vector B so this is
106:58 - actually a really simple operation to do
107:00 - because the answer if this was C
107:02 - actually just involves adding the
107:05 - components together so this would be 5
107:07 - comma 3 because 3 plus 2 is 5 and 4 plus
107:10 - negative 100 4 minus 1 is 3 incidentally
107:13 - while we're here I'll just say that a
107:16 - minus B vector subtraction is also what
107:20 - you probably imagined it would be the X
107:22 - component minus the X component the Y
107:23 - component minus the Y component and this
107:25 - would extend into any dimensional space
107:27 - if my vector had 10 numbers in it it
107:29 - would be the same thing so this would be
107:31 - 1 comma 4 minus negative 1 is 4 plus 1
107:35 - which is 5 so these are how these
107:37 - operations actually work
107:44 - however while this is so incredibly
107:47 - simple I think it's worth taking a
107:49 - moment to actually look at how this
107:52 - appears in a diagram because this really
107:55 - relates to how we're using vectors in a
107:57 - 2d p5 canvas so let's stick with our
108:07 - upside-down p5 space there's no demi
108:11 - Gorgons here we'll be fine
108:14 - that reference is totally not gonna
108:16 - matter um so at some point in the future
108:20 - this is zero zero and I'm suggesting
108:23 - that a a we're oh wait how do I want to
108:28 - do this no no no no no never mind
108:31 - I don't want to get into position and
108:37 - velocity just yet the Debbie Gorgon
108:42 - reference will not make it into the
108:43 - edited video go back well maybe it will
108:46 - maybe I'll add it back in uh-huh
108:51 - let's think about our Cartesian space
108:54 - the one where Y points up not the
108:56 - upside-down one with that Demi Gorgon in
108:58 - it and we have the vector a which I can
109:05 - think of as I'm not gonna draw let's
109:21 - think about our carts two dimensional
109:22 - Cartesian space the one where Y points
109:24 - up and X points to the right so not the
109:28 - upside-down one what would be Gorgon in
109:30 - it no Demi gordon's here and so the
109:34 - vector three comma four would be one two
109:37 - three whoops
109:38 - one two three four so this is vector a
109:43 - and vector B is 1 2 and negative 1 so
109:49 - this is vector B so a and B adding
109:54 - vectors the resulting vector C
109:57 - which is a plus B is the vector that
110:00 - point that that results from putting
110:02 - these two end to end so it doesn't
110:04 - matter which one I do first but I'll
110:09 - start with any and then I'm going to put
110:12 - B on the end and B was 2 negative 1 so
110:16 - like this that's B that means this
110:19 - vector here is C this is the resulting
110:23 - vector that you get from a plus B
110:28 - incidentally the vector you get from a
110:31 - minus B would be just take be the same B
110:35 - and put it in the negative direction
110:37 - because this is like representing minus
110:40 - B and then the result of a minus B would
110:44 - be this vector so in that case which
110:46 - vector goes on the end of which is quite
110:47 - important because a minus B is quite
110:49 - different than B minus a or is a plus B
110:51 - and P plus a are the same the reason why
110:57 - I mention this is because now if we go
111:00 - to our upside-down world the world of P
111:02 - 5 and I have this idea of a position the
111:08 - position vector which gives us
111:10 - instructions of how to get from the
111:12 - origin to some location in the canvas
111:15 - and what I want to do is have this thing
111:18 - move animate live in a physics world and
111:22 - respond to forces that's where I'm going
111:23 - with this I want to add to the concept
111:28 - of position I want to add the concept of
111:30 - velocity and if this happened to be
111:32 - velocity then the neck if I take
111:35 - velocity and add it to position then and
111:37 - restore that back into position then I
111:40 - have a new position and then I do it
111:41 - again I take that velocity and add it
111:44 - again and then I have a new position so
111:47 - the object the Walker so to speak is
111:50 - moving from position to position
111:51 - position while adding the velocity over
111:54 - and over again now if that velocity
111:56 - should ever change that's gonna make
111:58 - things much more interesting but let's
112:00 - just start with this concept
112:09 - okay
112:11 - [Applause]
112:24 - so I am going to add to my walker a
112:30 - variable called ve L for velocity I'm
112:34 - going to say create vector and I'm just
112:36 - gonna hard code something in it just to
112:38 - see that right now I'm gonna say 1 comma
112:40 - 0 then now what I'm essentially saying
112:45 - is that these numbers these random
112:48 - numbers that I was picking in the random
112:49 - Walker example that I was adding to
112:51 - position out x position not Y those are
112:53 - the equivalent of the components of the
112:55 - velocity vector so if I add put replace
113:06 - those with the x and y components of
113:08 - this dive velocity now I have what do I
113:10 - have I have a dot that's moving to the
113:14 - right I should probably change it from a
113:17 - dot so it's a little easier to see to an
113:20 - ellipse
113:34 - and let's run this sketch oh and let me
113:40 - know how also erase the background
113:42 - because ultimately the random the idea
113:44 - of the trail of the Ren Walker was where
113:47 - I was before that example but now I'm
113:49 - moving into a body that's going to
113:50 - hopefully eventually respond to physics
113:52 - and I think this visually makes more
113:59 - sense with background and draw there we
114:04 - go
114:04 - this object is moving this circle is
114:11 - moving by its velocity this circles this
114:15 - circles position is changing according
114:17 - to its velocity every cycle through draw
114:26 - I'm gonna change this now to 1 comma
114:28 - negative 1 and can you imagine which
114:32 - direction it's gonna go when I hit play
114:33 - think about it did you say up and to the
114:38 - right if you did you're right I could
114:42 - make it random and so I could put like
114:44 - some random numbers in here but ah this
114:47 - is a nice boat oh wait no no this is not
114:49 - where I want to go next it's not where I
114:54 - want to go next what time is it 11:26
114:59 - okay oh how I am missing something so
115:06 - important here though the whole point of
115:09 - where I started all this discussion was
115:11 - looking at the reference and talking
115:13 - about vector math and how they're all
115:15 - these functions for common vector math
115:17 - operations like the ad function but I'm
115:19 - not using the add function why aren't I
115:21 - using the add function well here is the
115:24 - most confusing aspect of this looking at
115:27 - this you see this dot paws dot x equals
115:30 - itself plus this dot velocity X it's
115:33 - just like x equals x plus speed maybe as
115:40 - a next step comment these out and just
115:43 - say this dot paws equals this dot paws
115:46 - plus this dot velocity ultimately this
115:49 - is what I'm doing right to add the
115:52 - velocity to the position
115:53 - yeah the components together but I don't
115:55 - care about the components I just want to
115:57 - add this vector to this vector so just
115:58 - add those vectors together let's run the
116:00 - code why not let's see what happens
116:05 - isn't it nice how JavaScript just like
116:07 - does it give you any errors like I don't
116:10 - know you try to do something whatever I
116:12 - couldn't do it
116:13 - I just won't draw anything I wish I had
116:18 - an error here because the error I would
116:20 - want it to give me would say I don't
116:22 - know how to use the plus operator with
116:25 - p5 dot vector I wish that I did and I
116:28 - personally need to hand wishes that
116:30 - JavaScript there was a way for me to
116:32 - tell it how to use the plot plus
116:34 - operator with p5 dot vector and some
116:36 - programming languages do allow you to
116:39 - overload what the operators do I think
116:42 - C++ is one maybe but javascript is not
116:44 - one it knows no more how to add these
116:47 - two vectors together that it would two
116:49 - fonts or two p v dot images and so in
116:53 - order to add them together we need to
116:55 - instead of using the plus operator I
116:58 - don't know why I'm coming over here but
116:59 - we need to use the add function and all
117:04 - of the vector math operations that I use
117:07 - over and over again probably throughout
117:08 - these videos I need to find a function
117:11 - in there that does that operation
117:20 - breaking news I'm being told that Python
117:22 - also allows you to overload the operator
117:27 - so instead of this so instead of this so
117:36 - instead of this I will say this dot
117:40 - pause dot add this dot velocity it's a
117:44 - bit of a mouthful it's kind of a lot of
117:46 - dots here but let's just take a moment
117:48 - to breathe this in ultimately if you
117:51 - forget about the this dots for a little
117:54 - bit I'm saying a dot add be right back
117:57 - to this example of two vectors a and B
118:00 - I've got a not add B add B to a add B to
118:06 - a add this object's velocity to this
118:09 - object's position
118:16 - and now when I run it we've got what we
118:20 - had before I can delete all this extra
118:25 - code and here we are
118:48 - [Laughter]
118:51 - Zachary McArthur writes forget about the
118:53 - dis dot there's a whole song about never
118:54 - forgetting that this dots indeed indeed
118:56 - there is okay what else do I want to say
119:03 - here I know what I want to do
119:22 - I mean I really could be done like this
119:24 - is the end here and the next I mean the
119:28 - things that I need let's make a list of
119:29 - the things I need to talk about if I go
119:34 - to the chapter it could be a good
119:36 - reference did subtraction I mean I
119:39 - should ah yes
119:40 - okay I mean I definitely want to talk
119:45 - about magnitude and normalize
119:56 - and then addict celebration in this is
120:05 - the thing that I'm trying to figure out
120:06 - when I want to talk about so I think I
120:12 - want to do a whole separate video about
120:15 - the static and non-static things so
120:23 - that's not gonna come up now I guess
120:25 - guess what I'll do is do a little bit of
120:28 - an aside about getting a random vector I
120:31 - mean where that could be yeah I think
120:40 - there's this really nice thing that I
120:42 - want to show which is how it's different
120:44 - to pick a rant a vector that has the X
120:47 - and y between negative 1 1 and actually
120:50 - picking a random vector of length 1 so
120:55 - that I can show that I can do with like
120:57 - bolt that I can use like multiply and
120:59 - talk about normalize with so does that
121:01 - like a separate video I'm so confused
121:05 - because this is okay I think this is
121:07 - gonna I think I should wrap this one up
121:09 - go and sleep when will you talk about
121:13 - cross and dot product 2021 that's
121:16 - probably about how much time it'll take
121:18 - me to get to it unless I quit all the
121:22 - other things I'm doing in my life and
121:24 - just make these videos every day then
121:25 - I'll be then I'll be talking about it
121:26 - next Wednesday
121:35 - all right
121:39 - okay okay no no I'm gonna just like
121:48 - yeah I'm gonna just blip this in here
121:51 - all right
121:56 - okay one thing you might be asking
122:02 - yourself right now before I'm anyway I'm
122:05 - pretty much finished with this but one
122:06 - thing you might be asking yourself right
122:07 - now anything it's worth sort of like
122:08 - tacking this on here no no no I'm gonna
122:11 - do this in a separate video I think
122:14 - should be short they should have the
122:15 - thing in and they want
122:17 - I'm not putting ads on them so it
122:19 - doesn't matter if there's like five
122:20 - videos in a row that's opposed to just
122:21 - one so that's what I'm gonna do
122:37 - so this ends so this is the end of this
122:40 - piece in the sense that I've talked
122:41 - about what vector math is it's taking a
122:43 - mathematical operation and applying it
122:45 - to vectors ad being a primary example or
122:48 - at least our first example of that and
122:49 - the concept of velocity as being a
122:52 - vector that changes the position over
122:55 - time one question you might be asking
122:58 - yourself is well what if I wanted to go
123:00 - back to that random walk and have the
123:01 - velocity be random every frame like how
123:03 - would I go about doing that and I think
123:05 - I want it like that's what and I think I
123:08 - want to cover that in a separate video
123:09 - because there's actually a really
123:10 - interesting thing that happens when you
123:12 - pick random vectors as opposed to
123:15 - picking random an x and y values
123:16 - separately and I want to show that in a
123:19 - video on its own so I'm gonna do that
123:21 - next and then once I finish with that I
123:24 - will come back and start looking at and
123:29 - once I finish with that I will come back
123:31 - and start looking at other vector math
123:33 - operations magnitude normalize multiply
123:37 - in the context of setting and
123:40 - acceleration for our random Walker so it
123:43 - doesn't just have a position and a
123:45 - velocity but it also has an acceleration
123:47 - so I'll see you there okay
123:55 - Raphael Alfaro says my cousin is a
123:58 - student at ITP trying to think of who
124:02 - your cousin could be alright do I have
124:06 - time yes I'm gonna do the next one this
124:10 - is gonna be a separate sketch for a
124:12 - second
124:22 - come on Internet don't fail me now
124:33 - Oh No Oh No
124:39 - did this save mm-hmm I mean this was
124:45 - pretty easy to recreate it's a temporary
124:47 - glitch oh boy this is like um snow day
124:58 - it's equivalent of snow day p-5 web
125:00 - editor down somewhere in the depths of
125:03 - my computer I have the keys to reboot
125:05 - the server but I think it's really down
125:10 - you know what happened did I break it
125:12 - did we break it somebody watching it
125:16 - strolling this channel crashing the
125:18 - server and purpose that would be very
125:21 - sad for everybody all around do I get to
125:24 - go home early today if if it doesn't
125:28 - come back I'm gonna show you the hilbert
125:30 - curve and get going I mean I could do
125:33 - this obviously without the p5 web editor
125:35 - but I don't want to
125:46 - the definition of insanity is doing the
125:50 - same thing over and over again and
125:51 - expecting a different result is that to
125:53 - whose quote is that can I show you guys
126:00 - I should show you guys mice my son is
126:02 - learning scratch and him and my daughter
126:04 - is also learning scratch she's a little
126:05 - bit younger so she hasn't really
126:07 - she just started where he's been doing
126:09 - it for quite a while
126:10 - he made this game which was really cool
126:13 - but I don't have the link to it all
126:15 - right
126:22 - first of all did you know that there's
126:24 - an alpha version of processing for and
126:34 - Albert Hilbert render let's see what is
126:39 - in these so this is the example that
126:46 - decoding in the Cabana video goes
126:49 - through I just want to change something
126:56 - I'm gonna zoom way in here you can see
126:59 - what it's drawing here this continuous
127:02 - path this is called a space-filling
127:08 - curve this is one single continuous line
127:18 - I can see it going and going and going
127:19 - we can just watch it Mizzou back out and
127:24 - actually what I'm sorry one thing I was
127:25 - working on that we're trying to decide
127:27 - whether it should actually go in the
127:29 - video because it's very hard to see this
127:31 - at the end when I finish it shoot how do
127:35 - I just give me a second here because
127:40 - this is gonna oh this is actually
127:44 - another thing I was trying to do
127:52 - who has an error
128:10 - well shoot I wanted to show you this
128:12 - thing
128:24 - p5 editors back ok oops p5 editors back
128:30 - I wanted to show you this other thing
128:32 - but oh so I'm really excited for the
128:36 - hilbert curve because i think it's a
128:37 - really good project for people to make
128:40 - their own oh yeah that's back to make
128:42 - their own I'm just gonna copy paste this
128:53 - yeah I'm gonna have to leave the site
128:55 - it's a really good project for people to
128:58 - make their own variations of
129:08 - let's try
129:11 - so one thing is if you haven't joined
129:13 - the discord please join the discord
129:18 - because we're planning to kind of
129:22 - organize around the hilbert curve there
129:24 - and have people make lots of art
129:26 - projects and creative variations of it
129:28 - so join for that I don't know why I
129:33 - can't get the editor back I'm gonna
129:35 - restart my browser
129:53 - oh and gone again yeah oh that was
129:58 - interesting let's log in - Lane oops
130:04 - wrong button get it the right button
130:12 - well
130:21 - well well well not not good
130:32 - you know what's going on
130:40 - processing foundation does has very very
130:42 - limited resources to main maintain these
130:44 - free and open source tools and so I
130:48 - would encourage you to support the
130:51 - processing foundation which you can do
130:53 - to do on the support website I believe
130:57 - also this is still active if I go to the
131:02 - coding train and go here I think I you
131:06 - at at I created a YouTube fundraiser for
131:09 - the processing foundation I should just
131:11 - put it on all high videos frankly but at
131:14 - least on this one if I click on it oh
131:18 - where is the fundraiser how come it
131:24 - doesn't show usually the fundraiser
131:26 - shows up here did it end maybe am i
131:30 - zoomed in
131:35 - I don't know why I don't see the front
131:37 - click no joy no subscribed I don't know
131:42 - why the fundraiser isn't there I wonder
131:44 - if it speak like by accident this like
131:46 - member thing is overlaying it but anyway
131:49 - but hopefully you could find that
131:51 - YouTube fundraiser processing foundation
131:53 - wait ah look you came back right okay
132:01 - alright I got ten minutes before I gotta
132:03 - go oh I just want to see is this where
132:15 - it was yeah that's where it was okay
132:16 - great so I want to make a new sketch and
132:22 - we call this random vectors and let's
132:28 - just say
132:51 - sorry I'm thinking about how I want to
132:53 - do this actually this could be the video
133:03 - both about static functions and not
133:09 - static functions but give me a second
133:12 - here oh there's a lot that I could do by
133:17 - doing this example so just give me a
133:21 - second here line
134:02 - okay alright that kind of threw me for a
134:10 - little bit of a loop there cuz I don't
134:11 - have a ton of time but let me see what I
134:16 - can do here
134:22 - okay
134:29 - don't want to call this I'm doing the
134:32 - random thing and the static thing it's
134:33 - kind of like two topics should I do them
134:41 - separately I'm making them separately
134:53 - okay
134:55 - all right
134:57 - okay
135:00 - hi so this is another video about
135:03 - working with p5 dot vector and create
135:06 - vector and p5 Jess hi so this is another
135:10 - video about working with p5 dot vector
135:12 - and creep it let's say you think why do
135:15 - I want to change this thing hi so this
135:21 - is another video about working with
135:22 - vectors in p5.js
135:24 - so I want to demonstrate something in
135:26 - this video which is about picking random
135:29 - vectors no no
135:43 - hello welcome to another video about
135:46 - working with vectors in p5 GS so the
135:49 - topic of this one is I want to just look
135:51 - at what it means to create a random
135:53 - vector and some things that come up with
135:55 - that I in the way I'm opening up a bit a
135:57 - bit of a can of vector e workers but I
136:00 - think this is gonna veer off into a
136:01 - bunch of different math functions I
136:02 - might need it also is gonna veer into
136:05 - the territory of talking about something
136:06 - called a static function but I'm gonna
136:09 - try to just shoot but I'm gonna try to
136:14 - take this slow and just look at creating
136:16 - a random vector for a moment so looking
136:20 - at this this
136:40 - deep breath I'm gonna start this
136:46 - discussion by looking at this example
136:48 - that has two vectors a vector called
136:51 - I need Simon is telling me that I didn't
137:00 - do vector multiplication exactly that's
137:02 - exactly what I'm going to end up needing
137:04 - to do and magnitude all this is gonna
137:06 - come up this is how I'm doing it okay
137:12 - it's not cold in here it's warm the
137:18 - example that I'm going to work with
137:20 - starts with just two variables v1 and v2
137:24 - and they're two vectors one with X&Y of
137:26 - 200 200 one with X&Y of 100 zero so what
137:29 - I'm doing in this is I'm drawing a line
137:31 - between the location opposite I'm
137:34 - drawing the line between the position v1
137:37 - x v1 dot y and the result of adding v1
137:42 - and v2 together well well let me just
137:47 - start this whole thing over
138:31 - Oh
138:43 - I can't do this without this the static
138:46 - thing is making me crazy I really just
138:48 - need to I think I need to do the I you
138:50 - know anything through the static one
138:52 - first or I should just be less crazy
138:55 - about this you know what I got it I got
138:58 - it everybody oh I'm such a doodoo doodoo
139:01 - face I know what I'm gonna do I have a
139:07 - much simpler way of doing this
139:32 - I got it I want to do the other thing
139:36 - but I need to talk about static
139:37 - functions that's why it was okay there
139:44 - we go okay
140:03 - hello so this is another video on
140:06 - working with vectors and p5.js and in
140:08 - this video I really just want to talk
140:09 - about what it means to make a random
140:11 - vector which seems like why is there
140:13 - even a whole video about that but I have
140:14 - a point to this which I will get to um
140:17 - it also was I think useful because it's
140:19 - kind of opening up this can of worms
140:20 - vector e worms which I want to open up
140:22 - because I'm gonna end up looking at some
140:24 - other math functions that I need it's
140:25 - gonna lead me to something about static
140:28 - functions but that'll be in the next
140:29 - video right now I just want to look at
140:31 - this example that I have and what I have
140:33 - here is first of all notice I'm
140:34 - translating the coordinate space to the
140:37 - center of the canvas this is very
140:38 - important because I want to treat just
140:40 - for this visual demonstration I want to
140:41 - treat zero zero as the center of this
140:43 - canvas then I'm making a vector with an
140:45 - X component of 100 and a Y component of
140:48 - zero and I'm representing the vector as
140:51 - a line from zero zero to the x and y so
140:53 - it would be nice if I could draw a
140:54 - little hat on the end so it looks like
140:56 - an arrow but that's gonna be too much
140:59 - work I could change these numbers you
141:01 - know negative 150 and you can see
141:03 - there's my line so let's just think
141:06 - about first what would it mean to pick a
141:09 - random vector
141:10 - well the first instinct might be this
141:12 - which is a very reasonable instinct
141:14 - let's make a vector that has between
141:16 - negative 100 and 100 as it's X and this
141:19 - is gonna start getting very long I'm
141:21 - gonna have to drag this way over
141:23 - negative 100 as it's y that's like the
141:27 - range of stuff that I'm picking and if I
141:29 - run the sketch you know every single
141:32 - frame it is picking a new value for x
141:35 - and y and I'm seeing that line point
141:36 - often in directions so this is a random
141:39 - vector generator in a way and but I want
141:44 - to show you something a little bit odd
141:45 - which is that if I take background 0 and
141:48 - put it into setup what do you expect to
141:51 - see I'm going to see collect over time
141:55 - every single vector that points from
141:58 - anywhere from 0 0 to what something with
142:02 - an x and y minimum maximum between
142:04 - negative 100 100 let's run this I'm
142:08 - gonna let this play out for a little bit
142:31 - look at that result I am seeing all of
142:36 - the vectors fill up a square it's the
142:40 - worst drawn square ever write any vector
142:42 - this vector this vector this vector this
142:45 - vector right because minimum maximum
142:50 - this is you know this is zero zero
143:08 - in many cases when working with vectors
143:11 - however it's quite common that you want
143:14 - to pick a vector with a random direction
143:18 - but a fixed magnitude what do I mean by
143:21 - that here the direction and the
143:23 - magnitude it's all random and the
143:24 - magnitude even has kind of this
143:26 - arbitrary range because this is the
143:28 - longest vector possible but if I go to
143:30 - extend to here this one is actually
143:32 - shorter what would it mean for me to
143:35 - pick vectors that fill out a circle well
143:40 - there is something in that there is
143:44 - something called a unit vector and a
143:49 - unit vector is a kind of vector which
143:52 - really just a unit vector is a vector
143:56 - that talks about that the unit vector is
144:01 - a vector of length one that's the unit
144:03 - with any with with any direction so it's
144:07 - a kind of vector that you use when you
144:08 - only really want to talk about the
144:09 - direction then the magnet doesn't matter
144:11 - let's just pick one as a standard and
144:13 - let's now pick a direction so what if I
144:16 - wanted to pick any unit vector any
144:18 - vector of length one but in any
144:20 - direction
144:21 - whoops so I could start to look into
144:24 - some trigonometry math to do this and I
144:26 - will come to that soon enough but
144:30 - instead of instead of had you know but
144:35 - one of the benefits of working with
144:36 - vectors in p5.js is there's a function
144:39 - that'll pick a random unit vector for
144:40 - you and that function is just called
144:47 - random 2d because I want a random 2d
144:50 - vector V equals P v dot vector dot
144:56 - random 2d now there's something really
145:00 - odd about this which is I'm calling this
145:02 - function random 2d p v dot vector dot
145:06 - random 2d la what is all that so this is
145:09 - veering off into this other topic about
145:11 - static functions and I'm gonna talk
145:14 - about that and cover that in the next
145:15 - video but for right now let's just
145:17 - understand this as a function that
145:19 - returns a
145:20 - random unit vector so now if I were to
145:23 - run this Oh what's going on here oh look
145:31 - at all those random unit vectors they're
145:32 - all of length one well I can't really
145:34 - visually see what's going on because one
145:36 - pixel isn't very much I could use a
145:38 - scale I could try using the scale
145:39 - function to kind of blow things up but
145:41 - this is a really nice opportunity for me
145:44 - to talk about another vector math
145:46 - function multiply where we timewise all
145:53 - the good is they gotta go I'm gonna
145:55 - finish this out
146:13 - I think I had this by the way something
146:16 - like this remember when I had vectors a
146:18 - and B and I said a plus B is add the X's
146:23 - together add the Y's together and I'll
146:25 - get eight comma three that's dessert the
146:28 - numbers I used before but I think this
146:29 - math is correct now and and and the
146:32 - function in p5 to do this was added now
146:38 - what if I wanted to use the idea of
146:40 - multiplication with vectors oh my
146:42 - goodness could I say a times B I kind of
146:46 - can but vector multiplication the vector
146:50 - product is a whole other topic that I'll
146:54 - cover eventually but you might have
146:56 - heard of things like the dot product or
146:58 - the cross product or the hard meru how
147:01 - what's that called the hat miroux
147:04 - the heart no that's Hadamard product or
147:14 - even something called the Hadamard
147:16 - product but I'm not covering those now
147:20 - when I say vector multiplication I'm
147:23 - talking about scaling a vector well when
147:26 - I say multiplication when I'm referring
147:29 - to this function in p5 called mult for
147:32 - multiply I'm talking about scaling the
147:35 - vector multiplying the vector by a
147:37 - scalar quantity so in other words I'm
147:39 - talking about saying a times not another
147:43 - vector but like the number 2 and what do
147:46 - I mean when I say that if I have a
147:47 - vector that's pointing in a given
147:49 - direction with a given magnitude like 3
147:53 - so let's actually make it 5 because I'm
147:56 - gonna use the 3 4 5 triangle if I
147:59 - multiply it by 2 now I have that same
148:01 - vector so it's sorry no I have a
148:03 - different vector but it's the same
148:05 - direction with lengths twice as much so
148:08 - the length of this vector is 10 and the
148:10 - way that this works is if it's a three
148:12 - four five if the components are three
148:17 - and four because it's a 3 4 5 triangle
148:20 - then all I have to do is multiply each
148:22 - component so if I want to take a and
148:24 - multiply it by 2
148:26 - the vector I would get is 6 comma 8 3
148:30 - times 2 4.com times 2 so in this case
148:37 - after I picked this random unit vector
148:39 - which has length 1 I can scale it to any
148:42 - quantity by saying V multiplied 100 and
148:45 - think about what's gonna happen now I'm
148:47 - gonna run this sketch and I get any
148:50 - vector always of length 100 pointing in
148:53 - any direction this opens up incidentally
148:56 - a lot of possible just like visual
148:57 - possibilities just from this alone and
148:59 - certainly I could change this and say Oh
149:02 - any vector between 50 and 100 and I
149:05 - should probably give this some alpha to
149:06 - sort of see and we can see now I have
149:10 - any vector it's a minimum length 50
149:13 - maximum length 100 and just from that
149:15 - I'm getting this sort of like nice
149:16 - visualization that would be harder to do
149:19 - without these built-in functions in
149:21 - vectors but so this though there's a lot
149:33 - more to this I might return back it
149:36 - might be useful now to return back to
149:37 - this random Walker example and I can see
149:40 - now I'm sorry before I move on let's
149:47 - just quickly move back to this Walker
149:49 - example and see that I could now say
149:51 - this top velocity equals P 5 vector
149:55 - random 2d and this would now be a way of
150:00 - taking a Walker and every time I run the
150:02 - sketch it's going to go in a random
150:04 - direction the speed the magnitude of the
150:07 - velocity is always going to be one so I
150:09 - could also randomize that to some value
150:14 - between like zero and three whoops this
150:19 - dot velocity dot multiplied whoops
150:24 - and now you're seeing just another way
150:27 - of thinking about how you might
150:29 - initialize something with randomness and
150:31 - maybe Perlin noise could play a role
150:33 - here is there some way you can create an
150:35 - array of all these walkers with initial
150:38 - velocities according to Perlin noise if
150:40 - you go back and look at my Perlin noise
150:41 - videos that might create some
150:42 - interesting trails you could consider
150:44 - but i'm but but i'm going to stop here
150:46 - and let you do some variations on this
150:49 - now that you see about how random 2d
150:52 - works and multiply works there is
150:55 - another aspect to this though that I
150:56 - want to unpack which is what does it
150:58 - mean to call a function like dot
151:00 - multiply which is on a vector V versus a
151:03 - function like random 2d which is not on
151:05 - a specific vector but on the type of
151:08 - thing itself P v dot vector so I'm gonna
151:10 - come back and that's what that's called
151:11 - a static function I'm gonna cover that
151:13 - in a separate video and then after that
151:15 - we'll be ready to start looking at
151:16 - acceleration and all the other good
151:17 - stuff magnitude and normalize and all
151:19 - that sort of stuff ok so thanks for
151:21 - watching this one and I'll see you in
151:23 - the next one bye
151:24 - [Music]
151:26 - okay alright everyone I've got to go
151:33 - thank you for tuning in I don't know why
151:39 - I don't hear that
151:40 - [Music]
151:42 - oh I hear it now um Oh Valentine's Day
151:47 - coding challenge oh no I know I'm gonna
151:52 - get give me an idea huh shoot all right
151:59 - I've got to go thank you for watching I
152:02 - can try to answer a question or two time
152:05 - assign me to spin the wheel for the
152:06 - command I'm not prepared to do that
152:08 - today so I'll have to do that another
152:10 - time I don't think I have the I don't
152:12 - remember what's on the list I don't have
152:14 - a link to the wheel we need but someday
152:17 - we'll have all sorts of systems like
152:18 - this so these will come out as edited
152:20 - videos okay you know it might take out
152:22 - some time
152:23 - stay tuned you know but I don't I I know
152:27 - I said the videos the hilbert curve
152:30 - Cabana video will be released tomorrow
152:31 - that's the plan but you know let me just
152:34 - say by Monday at the latest sometime
152:37 - this weekend heart curve I did the heart
152:39 - curve last year Marcos you have a good
152:42 - nice weekend also I've got a lot of
152:45 - things going on today what else what
152:47 - sweaters like reminders you can check
152:51 - out the new coding train store as
152:54 - standard TV slash coding train you can
152:58 - add your contributions to your projects
153:03 - you make on the coding train website
153:04 - please join the discord the stay tuned
153:09 - by the way one thing I'll show you is
153:11 - working on some new thumbnails these are
153:13 - sort of in progress when I say I on this
153:15 - were designed by Simon who designs
153:18 - thumbnails for standard although I'm
153:20 - making some tweaks with Jason who did
153:22 - these illustrations but this is the
153:24 - these are the two that I did so far and
153:26 - the hilbert curve should be here very
153:28 - soon what else I think that's it
153:34 - can you do oh I'll be a processing
153:36 - community day tomorrow if any of you are
153:38 - going to prosecute a in New York there's
153:42 - also just sort of like more generally
153:44 - there's community to a worldwide which
153:48 - I'm in the wrong place
153:50 - yes so if you're interested in attending
153:56 - an event where you can meet people in
153:58 - real life take a look at all these
154:01 - community days happen all over the world
154:03 - projectile motion coding challenge
154:05 - that's a great idea so that could be
154:07 - interesting to do some once I get
154:11 - through a lot of these basics to pick
154:12 - sort of a topic that could be a coding
154:15 - challenge that's based on those I like
154:16 - that idea
154:17 - somebody to remind you that have you
154:18 - seen in Twitter I mentioned doing a nice
154:20 - tweet where a I cannot recognize optical
154:23 - illusion between a hare and a duck Alexi
154:26 - I did not see that I'll have to try to
154:28 - take a look for that all right thanks
154:29 - everybody goodbye have a wonderful
154:31 - weekend and I will see you next week
154:35 - hopefully is next week the week that I'm
154:38 - away yes but I'm not leaving till Friday
154:42 - so next week Thursday or Friday there'll
154:44 - be a live stream okay hopefully this is
154:47 - the ending animation
155:13 - [Music]
155:35 - auto-tuned and the internet will fix
155:37 - that
155:51 - [Music]
156:04 - [Music]
156:07 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
156:10 - else is there
156:12 - yes kittens thank you very much
156:15 - kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice
156:17 - that look what I get
156:19 - [Music]
156:37 - [Music]
156:48 - [Music]
157:03 - [Music]
157:30 - [Music]
157:37 - I feel just sort of like a nice feeling
157:41 - of relaxation everything's gonna be okay
157:43 - today dream is not broken it does not
157:46 - frozen this isn't this is a wonderful
157:48 - thing okay we're gonna do I'm really
157:51 - getting something I need my sound
157:56 - [Music]
158:10 - [Music]
158:12 - that was invalid syntax I forgot
158:18 - [Music]
158:23 - generation analysis things
158:26 - [Music]
158:56 - so this is random this is noise Perley
159:00 - noise that is in the core random
159:02 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
159:04 - itself those numbers aren't related at
159:07 - all you pick like I'm picking random
159:09 - numbers between zero and ten nine two
159:11 - seven six one
159:20 - this two three four three four five six
159:24 - five four five six seven five six seven
159:27 - five six seven eight nine eight seven
159:31 - this is like Perlin noise performance
159:33 - part like birthing noise performance
159:48 - apart with curling noise I might pick
159:56 - numbers like this
160:03 - by purling noise that is early noise so
160:06 - this is hurling noise that is Hurley
160:08 - noise this is Hurley noise that it's
160:09 - Hurley no so this is Hurley noise this
160:17 - is but with curly noise I might pick
160:37 - numbers like this
160:38 - [Music]
160:53 - like I always forget to do this this
162:02 - star this star this star this star song
162:04 - never forget the Vista somebody composed
162:07 - that song for me

Cleaned transcript:

morning this is a quick sound check how's my audio let me know we'll be starting in just a minute or two hello good morning and welcome to the coding trade with me your host Dan that's my name and we as we do usually on the coding train we begin with the numbers I actually only noticed that about a minute and a half ago I was using it as a prop in one of the courses that I teach physically in person here at New York University where I am live broadcasting to you from so I forgot to bring it into this room where I recorded so I don't have random numbers 3 maybe you could help me and actually this has to do with a little idea that I have that I might pursue in the future which is that maybe let's just as a quick experiment you're about 30 seconds behind me in real time because there's a bit of a lag in the live stream but if you could start putting random numbers into the chat this is how I will read random numbers you will experiment with can we create a pseudorandom number generator just from the viewers of the coding drain and while you are waiting those 30 seconds I will quickly while I'm waiting this 30 seconds let me quickly thank Oh wrong button but you can see that let me quickly thank dashlane the sponsor of today's coding train dash line which is a password manager that you will probably see me use as I log in and out of various things during this live stream you can get try a 30 day free trial of dashlane premium if you go to link comm slash coding train and if you do like the service and want to get it then you'll get 10% off as well if you choose to purchase lien premium all right I'll talk about Lane again a little bit later let me take this off and aha whoa whoa whoa I cannot read these 126 8650 for 1150 about five thousand five and forty six six thousand 4.99 twenty thirty thousand nine to thirty one oh this is very friend usually the point of the random number readings you could stop now that's good we're good we're good is for it to be relaxing and soothing I don't remember what music I was recently playing with the random numbers there was the lullaby music like you know who knows um alright so let's begin let's let's not let's skip all of this mumbo jumbo where I talk about 5 million things about different websites that you could find out more and buy things and look at things and download code and contribute code and all that stuff let's just you the viewer and me right now let's get into it but before that please please with the random members oh they're in the discord this is this is much more effective I can actually manage to read these this is a really good one we've got 65 million seven hundred twenty seven thousand three hundred eighty two a little bit afraid that there are some encoded secret messages all right before I get into today's topic which will be the topic for the next several months probably if I'm being perfectly honest let me briefly mention to you that I will be appearing again on Monday if you cannot possibly get enough of me on the youtubes you can get some more of me on the Twitch's with mpj and fun fun function which is a wonderful streaming show thingamabob on the internet with mpj and who i've met in person exactly i think i don't know a couple times and and and formally talked to him on the internet and it's really perfect timing because the topic today i am going to launch my live streams will be filled with me recording short video tutorials to redo all the nature of code materials for 2020 we could get the numbers I have to look away and but it's good timing because I'm going to begin that process today and talk to you about vectors in p5.js and Creed the create vector function and then on Monday I'm going to attempt to teach essentially the same thing to MP J with through the lens of an example about gravitational attraction so that's what's happening a couple things I can sort of like update you on and maybe tease out tease a little bit well David's asking a really good question hold on hold that thought is that what's he gonna say I have yes so you as you might recall the topic that I was kind of going through bit by bit by bit over the fallen into January was this playlist beginner's guide to machine learning in JavaScript so I hope after today starting next week there will be one of these that says the nature of code and there will be you know nine or ten chapters and I'll start filling them all in over the next several weeks but is not finished in fact this is where I left off in the last session I started doing some tutorials about convolutional neural networks and there are two more in the I mean there you can find all that content in the previous live stream but the edited versions of them are waiting to be finished and will they're two that will appear here in the next week probably but I'm just gonna leave that to the side because I really need to do this nature of like a variety of reasons that I'm happy to answer questions about but that's that's what's happening and I will return to this david also asks will you have other coding challenges while you are doing the nature of code series and Cabana videos so I'd well I have something that I am excited to tease for you let's see if I can manage to just do a little something just to hold this hold your hope well hold the train stop the train why why am I not logged in if only I had something like a password manager like dashlane on my device here where I could look up and you might be wondering why am I not using the laying on this laptop it's because I have a sort of dummy lay an account because I don't want it to show all my personal stuff so I am looking it up now on my phone Google coding training oh boy this is taking way too long for this little thing don't worry I'm getting somewhere wrong wrong wrong this is gonna be good just this is gonna be good okay ready I'm going to bring my computer back in just a moment so the next coating in the Cabana video on the hilbert curve will premiere hopefully tomorrow Saturday so I feel like the coding of Cabana is a kind of video to release over a weekend it's like you're just there and it's snowing outside and all of that stuff and so there's this so this is the Jason headland who does a lot of all of the illustrations for the coding train created this lovely scene and also if I open up the browser I think I had it open too this is the springtime scene so this is the more standard coding in the Cabana scene but now this is the winter time theme so so that's coming tomorrow so bad I'm gonna leave this up here just cuz it's sort of like nice to have but let me get back to David's question so my focus my primary focus will be nature of code and to be honest if I was really if I was my I really want to update the book text so what I probably should do which I'm not gonna do is just say like hey no YouTube videos for the next three months sorry I have to work on the book text so I'm gonna try to do them simultaneously that's what my real primary focus is updating the book and I actually looking for contributions for that and potentially to hire a few people two additional people to help me with that which maybe I have to do some more thinking about that but I will I will post you could pro you could join the discord leave like a button to like bring up the discord but someone please post the discord invite link to the chat if you can but the discord is where I will is where we're kind of like organizing and talking about things coding challenges we'll see I mean those are the the lifeblood of the channel in a way those are by far and away all the most watched videos they're what bringing people in there what people seem to enjoy the most so I shouldn't I don't want to stop doing them but I just have this mission to just get this through all this nature of code stuff and get out there again in a way that's more digestible and accessible so that's what my focus will be but you know I kind of hope that I can figure out a way to like livestream a couple times a week easier said than done because there's also a lot of weeks where I'm traveling and I'll actually be taking those weeks off so we'll see Juan Flores in the chat asks I haven't seen most of the nature of code playlist should I wait for the new videos to come out up to you there's nothing wrong with the old nature of code playlist the main the main issues with them is that the the video quality is quite poor as I made them many years ago some of them actually in 2012 I look much younger but the video quality is not so great and so so that means that I would like to improve and then they're using processing which I still use and plan to keep all of the examples in and use in projects and have part of the nature of code materials but since a lot of my teaching now is in on the web in JavaScript I want to create videos that use JavaScript okay all right I think I'm gonna be have to be the one to link the discord link so let me do that real quick I don't want to plug the coding trade memberships even though that's what I'm doing right now but I do have this new bit but somebody joy and said I don't be am so he really loves so anybody joints could do my do bit I think you know what it is well agent last night useful links discord invite a copy link paste and enter okay oh and now let me just mention I know I said I wasn't gonna be like plugging all this stuff but let me just briefly mention the new coding terrain store I'm really uh in the a one thing you'll like about the new coding in the Cabana video is I don't use that chalkboard so the new coding the Cabana video will not have two chalkboard instead I actually am drawing in one of these coding training notebooks and I have this one of these like overhead cameras that you can see just like over over the notebook so there's actually a really interesting fun fact about the drawing in the notebook that I will see if anybody notices and then I'll come back well I will talk about it next week on the live stream so but I really think that I'm plugging is the hoodies because I ordered a bunch of gifts for people and I ordered one for myself and because they're they have to be made in batches they'll only get made if enough people buy sound is on the low side if it's manageable then I would prefer to keep it as is because I'm noticing it get all the way into the yellow right up to the red in open broadcast studio and I prefer uh to be able to turn it up on their own and use headphones okay okay okay okay okay oh okay all right I mentioned Monday stay tuned well now what oh it's just I don't have the nature of code like I won't bought that domain but it's here okay all right all right so here's how this worked here's how this is gonna work um so I don't know if you've all seen this but YouTube has a new feature called YouTube learning playlist so I'm gonna be filling that out with content and I have actually you know by accident in a way made a lot of the videos already so what I need to do today is just do like a quick intro then and then I think just sort of like talk about the introduction and is there like let me try to get the table of contents hold on a sec I'm just going to do this for a second hold on oh whoops I'm not logged into the nature of code they log into my light here we go ohho factor excellent oh no no no factor authenticator I wanted to pull up the table of contents everybody always wants this background music I don't know that it exists anywhere on the Internet the song is called Tori the dog that's what the song is called and it's by a composer named Adam Blau ad am b Lau I think Adams on Twitter at Adam Blau if he wants to release this in somewhat sublicense more widely welcome to but he was something he happened to have his archive library of stuff that never got used and I I love that and I started using it now everybody asks Metro writes nothing happened for the last 50 minutes welcome to the coding train where nothing happens for a way longer than 15 minutes you have won by watching the coding train ah lucky la Lama with the super chat has won 15 to 20 more minutes of person on the internet with a messy beard dancing and doing nothing shoot I lost track of what I was doing I yes okay here we go so I have with me what time is it ten o'clock just so everybody knows so in about a half an hour 45 minutes I will take a short break there's look like to take a break in the middle of my long session and then at noon I will be you believe it so I have a lot to stuff this afternoon planned so I've got to get out of here at noon Arnab asks is CNN on a hold by CNN we're talking about convolutional neural networks somewhat yes yes they answer this yes I talked a bit more about that earlier so you can scroll back in time if you want to find me talking about that okay so I think I have this I have the table of contents here which I'm gonna need and I have this all right and Oh hold on so how do I find I don't think I have it here we go and I have this okay so some of this stuff will just like make its way back into the playlist cuz I I have done updated physics library videos and updated genetic algorithms live videos and that sort of thing oh I'm not in the shoot I am NOT in this chat anymore okay I was not in the discord live supporter chat but now I am oh okay everybody let's just take a minute to relax Oh match you're probably not watching but I got to get the coating in the Cabana music that we use to have here this is what I always imagined it is it's not well I I wonder if it's that I have a larger viewership this morning than usual and I wonder if it's the topic or the time that's interesting to note okay all right I got everything I want to talk about so this first thing so okay so if you haven't watched me before it's a little bit of a strange thing that I do which is that these live sessions in many cases are what I what are recording sessions for things that will get edited and chunked into playlists and various other formats on the coding train so I do have a lot of redundant content and in some sense you might say to yourself I don't want to watch this person goof off and waste a lot of time and try things multiple times you could just wait for the edited content that would be my suggestion but this this is gonna be a bit maybe a bit more of even of an extreme version of that in the sense that I'm gonna try it like for example this first thing that I want to do is just record a video that's really no more than one minute long and I don't have a script or anything so I might try it a couple times which will be just sort of like a quick introduction to how I'm rebooting the nature of code playlist then I'm gonna look at the table of contents and figure out do I want to just go straight to making tutorials actually for chapter one but I just want to like take a quick peek at the table of contents to see if there's some stuff that I actually already have from the introduction that I can also do something with all right good morning all here we go let me go I want to get one more thing up cadenzas a code okay I will also call this up because I should acknowledge this but to some extent what I am doing is partially also available here you can't have too much nature of code in your life shouldn't be called the code of nature I think there's something already called that oh look at my Google power and actually even almost comes up I mean it comes up first this is an ad right or no this is some kind of like what it thinks we want to feature it snippet okay published Daniel I think it's spelled incorrectly I'm pretty sure it's sh ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii ii f and ay ay ay ay HH HH HH HH HH guess and proper spelling of my name just write write that down to get the number of e's right it's very important I can do this I think this is a nice I think I like the idea of like starting this with but you don't match yeah you we can replace the background so I'm actually not even gonna worry about that okay happy 2020 it is I me the person hello and happy 2020 it is me Dan from coding train here to launch a new learning playlist on YouTube called the nature of code that's what it says right here so this is not new content at all in fact this playlist that I'm about to embark upon is based on material that I started working on probably in 2008 and then published a book about which you can find online at nature of code calm in 2012 the book here that you're seeing is all is was written then and has largely not been updated uses processing which is a Java based creative coding environment and I am going to redo REI Mari in the process of rewriting the book to update things for 2020 as well as port a lot of detects all of the text and examples to JavaScript with p5.js so that's part of what I want to say so it's my dream that by the time you're watching this this will look totally different but this is where it is right now as I'm recording this in terms of what's already on the YouTube channel these are all of the videos most of these were actually recorded between 5 & 8 years ago the quality is is a little bit lower not good oh it's the best ever now but it's it's improved and so you can go back and watch these but largely what I'm going to do is go through a lot of these topics and redo these videos with new ways of thinking and new ideas and also JavaScript I should mention that some of the stuff I did update more recently like genetic algorithms and neural networks and physics libraries and little bits and pieces in here so there will be if you're following through this playlist there will be something like forward and backward in time of how things that when things have been recorded but hopefully it will all piece together with a nice narrative if you want to follow if you want to follow the work in progress as it's happening on if you want to follow the work if you want to follow the book being updated and the examples being updated as it's happening I'll refer you to the nature of code on github so here are all of the open source repositories for all of the raw material of the book so the book itself is an NOC book there's a whole section there about the build process of the book which I'm really looking for help with if you're watching this please jump on in and help me out um there's the syllabus which is for course that I'm teaching at ITP New York University to school the arts there's the code for the website there's the processing examples there's the p5 just examples and there's even some Python examples as well and so all of this is stuff that I'm going to be working on and my goal is that sometime by the end of 2020 all of this will be complete this video series that is there in front of you will have be all filled out and we can all just have a little dance and be merry go merrily on our way let me also give a mention of cadenza which produced which I participated in producing an online course called the nature of code years ago a bunch of years ago as well that has a lot of video tutorials a lot of similar content this is also a nice resource a compliment to what I'm doing here as well so I probably should have mentioned what this is about hmm that's fine I'm trying to think look I didn't really bleed off of what this is about but that's fine well could I could redo this or we could edit it in a different order or or I could just do it right now introduction I probably should have mentioned what this is all about so this book is about looking at the world around us the natural world being inspired by it and trying to create software experiences interactive experiences inspired and based on those things so the table of contents has physics simulation so the first bit of advice that I might give you here in the words of George Washington Carver is go take a walk outside experience the world around you draw on that for how for when you build software and write code and they you know think about your humanity in our I'm trying to be profound not really working so the first bit of advice that I might give you like drawing on my cell face what's funny is like all my old videos just had all this stuff in them and I guess it's here on the live stream we really did enjoy that and edit all this stuff out but what can you do the first bit of advice I might have for you is I'm gonna get through this sentence the first bit of advice I might have for you and you know thinking of the words of George Washington Carver go take a walk outside experience the world around you be with people be with human beings enjoy nature and that might help really give you ideas an inspiration for what you might want to create when you sit down to code and that's really what this book is about for me you know fractal cellar automata autonomous agents of physics simulation genetic algorithms neural networks this happens to be a list of things that I'm going to go through step by step by step throughout this series but really there's so much more to the world that we live in than just that into outer space and beyond it's universe so I hope that as you watch this series you think beyond just what I have here create stuff and also share it with so stay tuned look in this video's description there's lots of ways if you're watching these videos that you can share projects you've made mostly on the coding train comm where I think that's where I'm gonna put stuff but there's just check the video description all that will be ironed out I gotta end this because this is really just a rambling introduction I want to get into the content I'm gonna come back and redo this anyway once all the videos are so hopefully this is like now you're watching this sometime in the future is like an interesting like historical footnote but thanks I've come with me on this journey nature of code and I can't I hope you enjoy it I'm gonna enjoy making it I know because I do enjoy this kind of stuff and I can't wait to see what you do good bye alright okay um so that's gonna be what I got for that okay so next so I think what I'm going to do since I have a lot of videos already is let me do a quick a quick hopefully not even 30 seconds a quick 30 seconds just about the introduction and then the playlist is just going to have in it Perlin noise video and random walk videos and then I'll move on to vectors okay did you stick with me so now you're in the first section of the nature of code learning playlist and that section is the introduction so what's actually going to happen now if you keep watching is the next videos that pop up into your feed our videos that I made in the last several years about Perlin noise the history of perla noise and something called open simplex noise as well as random walks so this is really just meant to be a warmup a way to get your like sort of like dip your toe into the water maybe I haven't programmed in p5.js with JavaScript or objectoriented programming in a while and so this will get you give you a bit of a sense of a little bit of a warmup before I move on to the next chapter vectors so that's where I will be where inventors I'll be wearing these clothes because at this moment right now I have recordings going to next go talk about vectors but before I before you see me then oh this is so the space cut nature of code is really disrupting the spacetime continuum before you see those you'll see a bunch of videos about perla noise and random walks which you can draw upon I think as a starting point for how you might want to start working with vectors this is working right oh boy hmm I don't know I'll come free do all this next week now okay I want to go back and look in my channel to see what all the videos I already have they can go in that playlist but I guess I'll do that on my own time not with you right here and so I can actually get into some real stuff here so the very first video and as my whiteboard operational is this camera crooked how crooked is it you're a crooked camera I have a have a level yeah it's pretty off so I needs to you think I would check these things before I start recording that's a little better I think I made it I don't know if I made it better or worse worse worse but worse the other way yeah oh this is good this is good that looks level okay okay where are we timewise 1015 the nice thing about this stuff is I think something will I mean I shouldn't say this now because famous last words but unlike with a lot of machine learning stuff and some of the coding challenges where I can get you stuck for hours I know this material fairly well so I think I'm actually gonna be able to move through it fairly quickly but we'll see we'll see if that really holds true okay being told to brush my teeth brush my eye bruh shhhhht my teeth I brush my teeth mmm just maybe I had a little spinach in my breakfast which is healthy and maybe that a little piece but you really should be telling me to do is trim my beard and go get a haircut that's what my mother would say uhhuh all right what am i doing all right oh thank you this is actually David wrote I liked how these intros came out really pleases me because I feel very confused how to do this all right let me I want to open up an example actually I want to get the random Walker example okay let's go I have an idea I'm going to go to the random walk web editor so this is the code from and let me I'm gonna this is the code from the random walk challenge and if you will oblige I'm gonna just make this object oriented person object oriented you know what maybe I'm not gonna make it object oriented maybe I will leave it as such okay that's fine because this is where it left off ah I saved over it hold on I think it should be okay now duplicate know how to name these okay I'll leave this up anymore actually just out of curiosity how did I do this before vectors P vector class vector math vector math to acceleration yeah all right I mean that's probably what I'm going to do again okay welcome to nature of code chapter 1 vectors so the poor purpose the pointless welcome to nature of code chapter 1 vectors so the purpose of this first video is just to explain what a vector is what is a vector as well as look at what it means to use the concept of a vector with p5.js hold on a sec now if you watched now if you watch some of the videos in the introduction section one of the examples I went through is a random walk this is a single point x and y in this example I have two variables x and y together they make up a position in the canvas and then every cycle through draw every frame of animation I pick a random number 0 1 2 & 3 and move it either to the right the left up or down this is using vectors so the concept of a vector is something you're probably using all the time in your programming without realizing it but maybe you're not actually getting full power out of vectors because you're not yet using p5 dot vector so that's really where I'm leading here but let's zoom back out and talk about what a vector is so first let me use another term for you scalar so scalar might sound like some scary math terminology that you seems unfamiliar to you but this is actually saying you have definitely been using all along for example here is an example of a scalar value 6 oh I've got another one for you 14 zero point three one nine two two two two that's my favorite scalar so a scalar is a numeric value a single value it is a magnitude so the concept here is something is a is something that has a magnitude for example the my height is a scalar value my weight is a scalar value you know I want to use height and weight as an example so for example the really stuck here so for example the length of this marker is a scalar value the weight of this marker is a scalar value anything that you can measure in a magnitude in a single number is a scalar a vector is something that has is a vector is an entity that has not just magnitude but also direction this is the idea of a vector now I should preface all of this by saying that vectors are things oh this I should prep I should preface this by saying that the concept of a vector extends into many many many dimensionality yeah oh I shouldn't say wait oh I should have said wait I have to go all the way back I have to go all the way back I should have said wait thank you thank you thank you I'm so glad I'm doing this live that was like the worst thing I could have possibly done thank you thank you thank you chat Thank You chat Thank You chat I owe you my life I owe you the fact that I will not eventually have to see ten thousand comments and remake all these videos forever and ever and ever don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait don't say wait wait don't say wait what are some other good examples the length of something the volume of something oh the number of you know the like I could I could like count like the number of things I have in a pile what are some other good examples the chat is too far behind me size area volume okay yeah area is good distance oh thank you distance distance it's such a good thing all right I thank you Oh time that's good okay examples of a scalar value are things that you can I lost my home momentum here but that's my temperature that's good thank you thank you chat examples of things that are scaler are things that you can measure like the the length of this marker the distance between me and you wherever you are all are in the world is a that's a scaler but like I you could also make it a vector it's not distance isn't about your distance is a scaler I've got to get back I've gotta get going back into this examples of scalar quantities are things like the length of this marker the volume of the area area is good Oh use my coding train oh examples examples of things that are scalar quantities are like oh the length of this marker maybe the surface area of this beautiful coding training notebook temperature how many what is it what how hot it is how hot is it outside whether it's Fahrenheit or Celsius or Kelvin that's a scalar quantity the distance between two points how far away in the world are you from me right now that's a scalar quantity anything that you can measure as a single magnitude that is a scalar a vector is something that is both magnitude not both not both a distances yeah displacement distances of distances a scalar now we can think of how I will get I'll kind of clarify that a vector however has not just magnitude nann dude but also directions this is the idea of a vector it's a quantity an entity that has both a magnitude and a direction one thing that's important for me to say is vectors can exist in many kinds of dimensional spaces two dimensional space three dimensional space four dimensional dimensional we can keep going but this it and and you might have heard me say the term vector in other videos that I made maybe about machine learning and data but what I'm going to do in this series is constrain myself restrict myself to talking about vectors in a two dimensional space this is because I am working with them in a p5.js canvas and that happens to be a two dimensional space you might want to use the concept of vector in three dimensions because you might choose and I might do some examples that look at vectors in three dimensions and in fact p5 vectors do support three dimensions 3d graphics or a thing but my focus and trying to explain all of this and look at the math will be sticking in two dimensions yeah the typical way a vector is tip the typical way a vector is what am I trying to say visualized or 1030 15 minutes I'm taking a break I'm trying to stick to my schedule represented that's the word I'm looking for the typical way a vector is represented is by an arrow so let me return back to this random walk example and look at this I had an X and a Y and then X and Y is moving randomly drawing its trail how could I think of that x and y as a vector I had two variables x and y they represent a point in space two dimensional space x and y I could think of these this x and y together as a vector that provides instructions for how to get from the origin point zero zero all the way to that x and y so this is the idea of thinking in terms of vectors this entity this this entity this entity this vector has both a magnitude that is its length how long is the vector this entity this vector has both a magnitude what is the magnitude it is the length of this arrow and a direction what is the direction it's the way the arrow is pointing and I could think of that in different ways but one way of thinking about that is as an angle often represented with the Greek letter theta so I could think of a vector as the length of an arrow as well as what direction is it's pointing as an angle relative to you know the origin point I know some people in that chatter saying a coordinate is a vector well so there's a couple things I want to say about this now probably this were now probably the canonical example of a vector is the concept of velocity the velocity of an object yeah so maybe I don't want to address that right now because I want to get I'm gonna get into this in a little bit I will mention this thing about is a coordinate really a vector I will give you my take on that I don't want to give so conceptually so conceptually I'm talking about this vector as this arrow and the arrow has both the length magnitude and the direction let me take a minute to redo this diagram in a more traditional math way because canvases are a little strange in that the origin is in the topleft and that Y points down but a more typical Cartesian plane a 2dimensional plane cartesian named for a guy named a the mathematician might have an XY coordinate right here and i could represent and the origin right here and i could draw an arrow between these two so conceptually the vector has the magnitude which is this particular length and the direction which represented by this angle relative to the horizontal axis however I am conflating a little bit two concepts which is this idea of a coordinate or a position and a vector this idea of this vector itself the concept of this vector is just this arrow it doesn't represent any specific location in twodimensional space it just represents instructions for how to get from one position to another position and in the case that I'm talking about those instructions are from the origin to the position X Y so in a moment I'm gonna start talking about velocity which is going to be used in our code to describe well if this is my thing at this X Y it's gonna go here then it's gonna go here then it's gonna go here then it's gonna go here I might have a bunch of velocity vectors giving it a path this idea of the vector itself is really a concept of the arrow not the specific location but a position in a p5 sketch can be thought of as a vector with instructions from how to get to the origin to that XY location itself and in that sense it really is relative because if I use the translate function to move the origin around that vector is going to kind of move around with that so hopefully that addresses it Simon is saying is that actually a quote from an actual three blue one brown video or are you Simon just reminisce is is giving me is writing in the discord chat about different ways to describe a vector with physics computer science and machine learning and with just sort of like more theoretical math now interestingly enough even though I am talking about vectors as part with this core idea of magnitude in fluently oddly enough even though I am starting this discussion off about vectors focusing on these core concepts magnitude and direction the actual values stored in the p5 vector object which I really haven't shown you yet but I'm going to get to are not the magnitude and direction but rather the components of a vector what do I mean by components well that I actually mean these this.x and this.y because in fact look at this arrow here I can make this into a little bit of a triangle and imagine the y equals three right the Y value is three go up by three the x value is four go across by four x equals four y equals 3 the vector the vector is actually 4 comma 3 the data stored with the vector are actually these numbers 43 and I could choose to write them in different ways I could say 4 comma 3 or I could write these sort of brackets and write 4 3 like that so in many cases more generically a vector is actually just a list of numbers it's a list of components and if I were in two dimensions I would have two numbers three dimensions three numbers four dimensions four numbers etc etc and this again comes up more in machine learning and data science but in the concept of physics I'm really thinking about this twodimensional space with just an X and a Y and incidentally I will ask you the question what is the magnitude of this vector think about that for a second maybe you've heard of a 3 4 5 triangle right if one side of a right triangle with a 90 degree angle is 3 the other side is 4 the hypotenuse of that triangle is 5 so one of the things you'll discover as I do more videos about different vector math is a lot of the math with vectors particularly in twodimensional space that is relates to trigonometry and trigonometry and all the same math associated with right triangles Oh so three blue one brown has a video called vectors what even are they essence of linear algebra chapter one got it okay so we are moving along here I'm almost done with this video oh I don't have it there's nothing in here I take it that means it's time for me to take a break I lost had all these viewers all left once I started talking about vectors what's going on or do people just have to go to work or something or go to sleep I feel like nobodynobody in my time zone watch just these videos it's either people are watching them because it's early in the morning for them or the late at night for them okay Oh Alicia ray writes I'm in linear algebra this semester I might go check that out you definitely should if you're looking for if you are if you are looking for helpful videos about mathematics I find the three blue one Brown Channel I mean okay I didn't weigh like I feel like oh my God all I ever do on the coding train is talk about three so and in fact my hilbert curve video comes out I'm talking about three blue one brown but it's really hard to find a better resource for understanding really calm sophisticated topics in mathematics in a delightful visual way it might not be the way that everybody learns but for me and I think a lot of people those kinds of explanations are just amazing okay thank you for assignment for clarifying on that all right and and David writes ndimensional vector math is mostly trig expanded into the n dimension which is true Kevin from Baltimore go o's next years the year yes Baltimore in the house okay any video Farhan I do have a video on a star okay I got it got off track I'm gonna finish this off and then take a short break reference I'm just gonna hit a create vector whoa this is not oh it is that is so weird I think this okay so this is fine but I would suggest I've never noticed this maybe there's a good reason that I'm not thinking of this seems like a really weird example to have as the thing that pops up on the create vector reference page like it's the second argument of the point light function that's creating a victor based off of sign of Millie's hoof I don't know if anybody wants to file an issue about this or to probably be five website repo I guess but I kind of actually I'm gonna I'm not gonna I'm gonna move to a different page let's just try let's try this one yes so frankly I would suggest this just go on the create vector page Euclidian ah that's good okay my a star was buggy welcome to the coding train where you have one an example code with lots of bugs in it have fun when you apply it to your project the bugs will still be there and as part of your learning experience you can fix those bugs alright here we go so first returning back to the random walker example we can look at this once again no not once again returning back to the random walker example we can look at this again the God again again for the first time now for the first time return returning back to the random walker example we can look at this with a new lens with a new view on outlook on life well like that outlook on life returning back to this random walker example we can look at with a new outlook on life and that is vectors instead of having and this is really the first thing when you're starting to program with p5 vector you're already this is already using the concept of vectors in the way that I described it to you but I want to rewrite this now with p5 vector so here's the reference page for p5 vector I encourage you to click over and check it out and read through it p f o actually yeah so many things I want to do so many things I want to do in this video so I'm thinking about the order of this but so here I need to go ate some water I got like a frog in my throat but I don't I want to finish this before I take a break there's nothing left in this okay okay here is the reference page on the p5 website for p5 dot vector now it's a little strange that there's this thing called p5 dot vector maybe I can return back to that in a moment a little bit but what I want to highlight for you is this right here create vector the function create vector is what makes an object in p5 that is a vector object a p5 dr. and when you create a vector you give it two values an x and a y it also can optionally take a third for an XYZ but again I'm not making use of the third dimension right now so the first thing beyond all the fun interesting new vector math that I will explore is just replacing my old XY variables with one variable that is a p5 vector going into the code I'll comment this out and I will say I'm gonna say pause for position and then here and set up I'm going to say position equals create vector and the X is with divided by 2 the Y is height divided by 2 I want to draw that point at pause dot X and pause da and while this random walker and while this code this random Walker code is is based on the sort of core idea of a random walker that can only go in four different directions up down left and right I want to instead simplify this and just let X&Y change by any random floatingpoint number between negative 1 and 1 as well so to do that I'll say Paz dot x equals positive x plus random negative 1 1 same for y wait sorry same for y and I'm gonna run the sketch weird where does that error come from oh whoops and I'm gonna run this sketch so step one of working with vectors in p5 is go and find something you once made that had separate X and y variables and see if you could use create vector instead for them yeah go ahead do that now I'll wait step two I would say is that I want to start building a foundation for a physics engine ultimately through all of these chapter 1 videos and chapter 2 videos by the end of all of them I'm going to have a very rudimentary physics engine that I can build a lot more projects on top of it will also serve as a kind of foundation of knowledge and understanding to use more sophisticated and robust physics engines from other libraries that's kind of the point of where this all is going but in order to do that I want to make heavy use of objectoriented programming so if you've never done objectoriented programming before or worked with classes in JavaScript a class being a template for creating an object then I might refer you to go back to my beginner coding videos where there's a whole section on objectoriented programming but for right now just to kind of recap that I'm going to very quickly create a walker object so instead of having a position variable that's just in the global space I'm going to make a walker class and create a walker object that is in the global space so also to keep things organized and this is just sort of my style I'm gonna make a separate JavaScript file for Walker then I'll write it as a class with a constructor function that will receive an x and a y it will have one variable a position so this is where I'm starting the Walker is essentially a rapper a rapper so this is where I'm beginning the Walker is essentially an object that stores that one vector position and I've got to use that this dot syntax because the position is the the Walker class has one piece of data associated with it the position vector and I use the this dot sequence so that the position is an instance variable that's part of the Walker object itself what does the Walker do it walks so I could call that step or walk or update I'm gonna use the the name update I'm gonna write a function and I'm gonna grab the code that I have here bring it in to Walker J s and what am I missing now that I have the position vector as part of the Walker class I need to refer to the position as this dot position which at some point is going to create some messy looking not missing which at some point is going to create some awkward looking longer winded code but we're gonna live with that and then I think I'm gonna have a show function for drawing the Walker I will grab this code that draws the point this dot and now I have my Walker class complete it the constructor creates a position vector the update function updates the X&Y position and the show function draws the position back into sketch I'm going to make the variable now called Walker in setup call the constructor with with / with with an initial position with an initial position of 200 200 and then in draw update and I think I forgot the stroke and all of that as part of its show function put that back in and now oops what do I have wrong oh I forgot to reference Walker J s in index.html and there we go I have exactly the same random Walker so this brings me to the end of this first video about what is a vector and using p5 vector in your code in your JavaScript code in p5.js but I have really barely scratched the surface I'm not doing anything other than thinking of this p5 vector as a place to hold the X&Y variable I really want to start thinking about this concept of a vector more I really want to start thinking about this concept of a vector more formally and start to think well if I have a position to erase all this I really want to start thinking about this concept of a vector more formally and if I have a position represented as a vector pointing from the origin to the XY location where I'm drawing something then couldn't that object that has that position also have a velocity representing as an arrow that's moving its current position to its next position in my animation and maybe I could have also something called an acceleration which is a vector that which in the same which in the same way that velocity is changing the position over time the acceleration is changing the velocity over time and I've heard about this thing called a force maybe there's something like Newton's laws and physics and motion and things that are at rest and they stay at rest and all that stuff could I somehow take this concept of a force maybe you've heard of this equation force equals mass times acceleration could that play a role in how acceleration is calculated which changes velocity which changes position and so these are the foundational elements of a physics engine and I am going to build all of those slowly bit by pit while talking about different mathematical operations with vectors and that's what you'll see in the next few videos in the next few videos all throughout chapter one and chapter two so if you're interested just keep on I don't know if they're there right now but when they're there they'll be there and you can watch them I'm making them in these clothes or a different clothes depending which day and recording them goodbye alright alright everyone so that is who I've kicked this off oh I'm so happy I'm getting I'm getting some momentum here because I feel like if I can get some momentum I might go just like pop into the studio and just like oh I have an hour free let me just do the next one and the next one some of those by the way I will probably do as memberonly livestreams just cuz but as a as a benefit for members all the edited content will of course make its way out to the channel but but yeah so I'm not done for today I have another hour left but I'm gonna take a short break and talk to you about briefly also thank my friends over at dashlane who are the sponsor of today's coding train Kony train would not really be possible all of the people who work on editing and everything and all the stuff that I'm putting out there it cost money and having sponsors is a really wonderful thing that I can't have the opportunity for to help me keep this project going and dashlane is a password manager and so if you'll I have something to show you which is this so if you have you know if your life feels very inconvenient and you can't manage all these passwords I mean how many things have I had to log into just on this livestream alone the web editor github I had to log in to a whole lot of stuff that I had to turn my screen off because I didn't want all this other private stuff showing up and so I I'm I having a password manager I can actually have different passwords for absolutely everything you can also store credit card information and so Biggs checking out and paying stuff online so much so much easier and so you know there are solutions like keychain and chrome have this but you get locked into a single system and all of your passwords are trapped in one place you know you have to watch out for other solutions like log in with Facebook with that that you know you might be at risk of your data being misused and sold so Lee never has access to your personal data and won't trick you into subscribing there's no credit card to sign up Layne cannot see your data and it is an adfree product so if you can fill out forms fast with oneclick logins and auto fills and here's the other thing that I really love about using a password manager is that it works across all devices so I'm always logging the stuff on my phone or a tablet or the laptop or then I'm on this treatmen computer and this computer so I can have basically everything stored in a way that I can log in and then when I'm you know when I'm somewhere at a public computer and I need my password I can just pull out my phone and grab it so that particular is really useful it is used by 11 million users in 180 countries endorsed by The Wall Street Journal New York Times Fast Company Forbes Wired and more top rated on the iOS App Store and a recommended app by both Apple and Google so if you are interested in giving it a try you can go to late comm slash coding training that lets them know that you found out about it from here you can sign up for free this will give you a 30 day free trial of the premium features and then you can also 'if you were to choose to purchase that get 10% off so I'm gonna take a short break a little intermission and if you feel so inclined you can use that time to sign up for Lane otherwise we'll be back in about five minutes with more I'm gonna do just like probably one or two more quick tutorials about p5 vectors okay how do I do this I go to my intromission button I put on this music and I mute my microphone and go get some water and breathe in some oxygen see you soon sorry I just had the mic muted I'm all messed up now it says intermission excellent okay see you soon I always forget this star this star the star this starts I'll never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me okay here I am back thank you again to lean and I'm ready to continue this vector stuff come back in full energy oh no no no no for very low energy I actually do feel quite a bit tired in a way like I do feel like maybe what might make sense I'm not really prepared to do this right now and I and I and since I have a kind of I have to be finished at noon I don't think I'm gonna do this but I could imagine a world where I if I do a two and A two to twoandahalf hour live stream where the first hour is the nature of code tutorials and then the second hour is a coding challenge so maybe that's something that I can consider I know a lot of people especially David have helped with this wheel spinning thing I've been working on I just haven't been able to get rid spin the wheel though for the next coding in the Cabana video since that's coming out tomorrow maybe I can do that is the noise suppression gone the noise suppression was never on so I don't know why that's something it would have changed it might just be louder in here there's like the air is kind of come on stronger okay go have a walk all right but I'm I do have so I lost my momentum by taking a break I feel kind of tired but I can get it back I regularly teach three hour classes so I don't know why and regularly and not regularly but I have done longer live streams but here we go okay so I think what I want to cover next is I don't know if I really want to do a general video about just vector math I feel like I'd rather have it come up as I build the examples so I think that's what I'm gonna keep going yeah oh all right all right I just see the last comment of the chat so let's get to it already it doesn't really motivate me to get started okay Adrian asks have you ever drank energy drinks I don't think that I should be having energy drinks I think my regular level of energy you know a little caffeine never hurts I like I enjoy caffeine just as much as the next person but any other amount of anything that's going to boost energy is just gonna cause me to there's like a little like teetering teetering teetering and I don't want to take another step oh maybe I could do a quick example the dot product projection Oh Joseph Clayton I am not that far along yet that is definitely part of this whole discussion but that that that I think is above and beyond where I am currently in terms of this material there okay I need to what I do need to do on if I'm live starting the morning is eat a bigger breakfast exactly marchello says dangerous just call me don't call me thank you to random hamster with your donation you have won me talking about vector addition all right we're how to begin this all right I know what to do I got it welcome back to the second video in Chapter 1 about vectors in p5.js hi so I could go in a number of different directions here and I'm still sort of figuring out what direction was good right now but ostensibly if you're looking following the nature of codebook along with these videos the next topic is really looking at vector math what are the kinds of operations that you might be used to doing with scalar quantities five plus two equals seven five minus two equals three x square root power of three all of these kinds of mathematical operations those mathematical operations exist for vectors as well and a lot of times it's as simple as vector addition is the same as scalar addition but you just add the X's and you add the Y's and that's really where I'm gonna start but what I think I prefer to do is rather than go through a laundry list which is how the book does this to a bit more extent of of vector math one at a time I'm going to take the next step in the random Locker example and discover what kinds of vector math I need as I'm going and start to talk about the different functions vector math functions I need as I get to them so but you might want to look and sort of wonder like what are all the things that I can do with vectors and one of the reasons to use the p5 vector class beyond just your own x and y variables is that all of these common operations exist as functions in the p5 vector class itself like add subtract multiply divide magnitude magnitude squared dot product cross product distance normalized limit heading rotate so many so many things so I expect that over the course of many many videos throughout this whole series I will get to a lot of these but you also might just take a moment to pause and click through and look at some of these yourself okay all right I'm sorry I'm just enjoying the chat I'm reading it but not reading it loud I'm just enjoying it to myself I want to show you my hilbert Dilbert curb thing that I made before I leave I'll show you a little a little teaser little teaser of the hilbert curve video that's coming out tomorrow one thing I like about doing these coding in the Cabana videos is I love all the stuff that I do and but sometimes it feels a little bit like okay Here I am releasing a new video that's the same thing that I did two weeks ago livestream so I do like the fact that it's like it hasn't no one's seen it yet and if you're thinking about joining as a member I will share it hopefully you know we're kind of like getting into the it's gonna be like up it's gonna be ready like a bit lastminute but I try to I would actually I definitely want to share it with the members first in case there's like a glaring error in it which none of us Swift's or working on and have caught okay do I like corn cakes no but I do Stan the king cake baby and if you happen to know what I'm talking about the fact that I stand the king cake baby as you know that reference you know you can at me Gen X here I'm really really really doing a good job okay so in the random Walker example there happens to be some vector math going on I am taking the X component of the position vector the Y component of the position vector and adding a random number to it so let's start by discussing vector addition let's say I have two vectors and often in a let's say have two vectors and in math textbook scenario often vectors are written as ya let's say that I have two vectors we'll call them U and V actually you know that's a very the U and V the way I write U and V it always looks too similar let's just call them a and b vector a and vector B and vector notation that you might see in a your math textbook often uses the arrow on top of the letter to say this this represents the vector a this represents the vector B and let's say the vector a is 3 comma 4 and let's say the vector B is I don't know 2 comma negative 1 I want to examine what do I mean when I say vector A plus vector B so this is actually a really simple operation to do because the answer if this was C actually just involves adding the components together so this would be 5 comma 3 because 3 plus 2 is 5 and 4 plus negative 100 4 minus 1 is 3 incidentally while we're here I'll just say that a minus B vector subtraction is also what you probably imagined it would be the X component minus the X component the Y component minus the Y component and this would extend into any dimensional space if my vector had 10 numbers in it it would be the same thing so this would be 1 comma 4 minus negative 1 is 4 plus 1 which is 5 so these are how these operations actually work however while this is so incredibly simple I think it's worth taking a moment to actually look at how this appears in a diagram because this really relates to how we're using vectors in a 2d p5 canvas so let's stick with our upsidedown p5 space there's no demi Gorgons here we'll be fine that reference is totally not gonna matter um so at some point in the future this is zero zero and I'm suggesting that a a we're oh wait how do I want to do this no no no no no never mind I don't want to get into position and velocity just yet the Debbie Gorgon reference will not make it into the edited video go back well maybe it will maybe I'll add it back in uhhuh let's think about our Cartesian space the one where Y points up not the upsidedown one with that Demi Gorgon in it and we have the vector a which I can think of as I'm not gonna draw let's think about our carts two dimensional Cartesian space the one where Y points up and X points to the right so not the upsidedown one what would be Gorgon in it no Demi gordon's here and so the vector three comma four would be one two three whoops one two three four so this is vector a and vector B is 1 2 and negative 1 so this is vector B so a and B adding vectors the resulting vector C which is a plus B is the vector that point that that results from putting these two end to end so it doesn't matter which one I do first but I'll start with any and then I'm going to put B on the end and B was 2 negative 1 so like this that's B that means this vector here is C this is the resulting vector that you get from a plus B incidentally the vector you get from a minus B would be just take be the same B and put it in the negative direction because this is like representing minus B and then the result of a minus B would be this vector so in that case which vector goes on the end of which is quite important because a minus B is quite different than B minus a or is a plus B and P plus a are the same the reason why I mention this is because now if we go to our upsidedown world the world of P 5 and I have this idea of a position the position vector which gives us instructions of how to get from the origin to some location in the canvas and what I want to do is have this thing move animate live in a physics world and respond to forces that's where I'm going with this I want to add to the concept of position I want to add the concept of velocity and if this happened to be velocity then the neck if I take velocity and add it to position then and restore that back into position then I have a new position and then I do it again I take that velocity and add it again and then I have a new position so the object the Walker so to speak is moving from position to position position while adding the velocity over and over again now if that velocity should ever change that's gonna make things much more interesting but let's just start with this concept okay so I am going to add to my walker a variable called ve L for velocity I'm going to say create vector and I'm just gonna hard code something in it just to see that right now I'm gonna say 1 comma 0 then now what I'm essentially saying is that these numbers these random numbers that I was picking in the random Walker example that I was adding to position out x position not Y those are the equivalent of the components of the velocity vector so if I add put replace those with the x and y components of this dive velocity now I have what do I have I have a dot that's moving to the right I should probably change it from a dot so it's a little easier to see to an ellipse and let's run this sketch oh and let me know how also erase the background because ultimately the random the idea of the trail of the Ren Walker was where I was before that example but now I'm moving into a body that's going to hopefully eventually respond to physics and I think this visually makes more sense with background and draw there we go this object is moving this circle is moving by its velocity this circles this circles position is changing according to its velocity every cycle through draw I'm gonna change this now to 1 comma negative 1 and can you imagine which direction it's gonna go when I hit play think about it did you say up and to the right if you did you're right I could make it random and so I could put like some random numbers in here but ah this is a nice boat oh wait no no this is not where I want to go next it's not where I want to go next what time is it 1126 okay oh how I am missing something so important here though the whole point of where I started all this discussion was looking at the reference and talking about vector math and how they're all these functions for common vector math operations like the ad function but I'm not using the add function why aren't I using the add function well here is the most confusing aspect of this looking at this you see this dot paws dot x equals itself plus this dot velocity X it's just like x equals x plus speed maybe as a next step comment these out and just say this dot paws equals this dot paws plus this dot velocity ultimately this is what I'm doing right to add the velocity to the position yeah the components together but I don't care about the components I just want to add this vector to this vector so just add those vectors together let's run the code why not let's see what happens isn't it nice how JavaScript just like does it give you any errors like I don't know you try to do something whatever I couldn't do it I just won't draw anything I wish I had an error here because the error I would want it to give me would say I don't know how to use the plus operator with p5 dot vector I wish that I did and I personally need to hand wishes that JavaScript there was a way for me to tell it how to use the plot plus operator with p5 dot vector and some programming languages do allow you to overload what the operators do I think C++ is one maybe but javascript is not one it knows no more how to add these two vectors together that it would two fonts or two p v dot images and so in order to add them together we need to instead of using the plus operator I don't know why I'm coming over here but we need to use the add function and all of the vector math operations that I use over and over again probably throughout these videos I need to find a function in there that does that operation breaking news I'm being told that Python also allows you to overload the operator so instead of this so instead of this so instead of this I will say this dot pause dot add this dot velocity it's a bit of a mouthful it's kind of a lot of dots here but let's just take a moment to breathe this in ultimately if you forget about the this dots for a little bit I'm saying a dot add be right back to this example of two vectors a and B I've got a not add B add B to a add B to a add this object's velocity to this object's position and now when I run it we've got what we had before I can delete all this extra code and here we are [Laughter] Zachary McArthur writes forget about the dis dot there's a whole song about never forgetting that this dots indeed indeed there is okay what else do I want to say here I know what I want to do I mean I really could be done like this is the end here and the next I mean the things that I need let's make a list of the things I need to talk about if I go to the chapter it could be a good reference did subtraction I mean I should ah yes okay I mean I definitely want to talk about magnitude and normalize and then addict celebration in this is the thing that I'm trying to figure out when I want to talk about so I think I want to do a whole separate video about the static and nonstatic things so that's not gonna come up now I guess guess what I'll do is do a little bit of an aside about getting a random vector I mean where that could be yeah I think there's this really nice thing that I want to show which is how it's different to pick a rant a vector that has the X and y between negative 1 1 and actually picking a random vector of length 1 so that I can show that I can do with like bolt that I can use like multiply and talk about normalize with so does that like a separate video I'm so confused because this is okay I think this is gonna I think I should wrap this one up go and sleep when will you talk about cross and dot product 2021 that's probably about how much time it'll take me to get to it unless I quit all the other things I'm doing in my life and just make these videos every day then I'll be then I'll be talking about it next Wednesday all right okay okay no no I'm gonna just like yeah I'm gonna just blip this in here all right okay one thing you might be asking yourself right now before I'm anyway I'm pretty much finished with this but one thing you might be asking yourself right now anything it's worth sort of like tacking this on here no no no I'm gonna do this in a separate video I think should be short they should have the thing in and they want I'm not putting ads on them so it doesn't matter if there's like five videos in a row that's opposed to just one so that's what I'm gonna do so this ends so this is the end of this piece in the sense that I've talked about what vector math is it's taking a mathematical operation and applying it to vectors ad being a primary example or at least our first example of that and the concept of velocity as being a vector that changes the position over time one question you might be asking yourself is well what if I wanted to go back to that random walk and have the velocity be random every frame like how would I go about doing that and I think I want it like that's what and I think I want to cover that in a separate video because there's actually a really interesting thing that happens when you pick random vectors as opposed to picking random an x and y values separately and I want to show that in a video on its own so I'm gonna do that next and then once I finish with that I will come back and start looking at and once I finish with that I will come back and start looking at other vector math operations magnitude normalize multiply in the context of setting and acceleration for our random Walker so it doesn't just have a position and a velocity but it also has an acceleration so I'll see you there okay Raphael Alfaro says my cousin is a student at ITP trying to think of who your cousin could be alright do I have time yes I'm gonna do the next one this is gonna be a separate sketch for a second come on Internet don't fail me now Oh No Oh No did this save mmhmm I mean this was pretty easy to recreate it's a temporary glitch oh boy this is like um snow day it's equivalent of snow day p5 web editor down somewhere in the depths of my computer I have the keys to reboot the server but I think it's really down you know what happened did I break it did we break it somebody watching it strolling this channel crashing the server and purpose that would be very sad for everybody all around do I get to go home early today if if it doesn't come back I'm gonna show you the hilbert curve and get going I mean I could do this obviously without the p5 web editor but I don't want to the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result is that to whose quote is that can I show you guys I should show you guys mice my son is learning scratch and him and my daughter is also learning scratch she's a little bit younger so she hasn't really she just started where he's been doing it for quite a while he made this game which was really cool but I don't have the link to it all right first of all did you know that there's an alpha version of processing for and Albert Hilbert render let's see what is in these so this is the example that decoding in the Cabana video goes through I just want to change something I'm gonna zoom way in here you can see what it's drawing here this continuous path this is called a spacefilling curve this is one single continuous line I can see it going and going and going we can just watch it Mizzou back out and actually what I'm sorry one thing I was working on that we're trying to decide whether it should actually go in the video because it's very hard to see this at the end when I finish it shoot how do I just give me a second here because this is gonna oh this is actually another thing I was trying to do who has an error well shoot I wanted to show you this thing p5 editors back ok oops p5 editors back I wanted to show you this other thing but oh so I'm really excited for the hilbert curve because i think it's a really good project for people to make their own oh yeah that's back to make their own I'm just gonna copy paste this yeah I'm gonna have to leave the site it's a really good project for people to make their own variations of let's try so one thing is if you haven't joined the discord please join the discord because we're planning to kind of organize around the hilbert curve there and have people make lots of art projects and creative variations of it so join for that I don't know why I can't get the editor back I'm gonna restart my browser oh and gone again yeah oh that was interesting let's log in Lane oops wrong button get it the right button well well well well not not good you know what's going on processing foundation does has very very limited resources to main maintain these free and open source tools and so I would encourage you to support the processing foundation which you can do to do on the support website I believe also this is still active if I go to the coding train and go here I think I you at at I created a YouTube fundraiser for the processing foundation I should just put it on all high videos frankly but at least on this one if I click on it oh where is the fundraiser how come it doesn't show usually the fundraiser shows up here did it end maybe am i zoomed in I don't know why I don't see the front click no joy no subscribed I don't know why the fundraiser isn't there I wonder if it speak like by accident this like member thing is overlaying it but anyway but hopefully you could find that YouTube fundraiser processing foundation wait ah look you came back right okay alright I got ten minutes before I gotta go oh I just want to see is this where it was yeah that's where it was okay great so I want to make a new sketch and we call this random vectors and let's just say sorry I'm thinking about how I want to do this actually this could be the video both about static functions and not static functions but give me a second here oh there's a lot that I could do by doing this example so just give me a second here line okay alright that kind of threw me for a little bit of a loop there cuz I don't have a ton of time but let me see what I can do here okay don't want to call this I'm doing the random thing and the static thing it's kind of like two topics should I do them separately I'm making them separately okay all right okay hi so this is another video about working with p5 dot vector and create vector and p5 Jess hi so this is another video about working with p5 dot vector and creep it let's say you think why do I want to change this thing hi so this is another video about working with vectors in p5.js so I want to demonstrate something in this video which is about picking random vectors no no hello welcome to another video about working with vectors in p5 GS so the topic of this one is I want to just look at what it means to create a random vector and some things that come up with that I in the way I'm opening up a bit a bit of a can of vector e workers but I think this is gonna veer off into a bunch of different math functions I might need it also is gonna veer into the territory of talking about something called a static function but I'm gonna try to just shoot but I'm gonna try to take this slow and just look at creating a random vector for a moment so looking at this this deep breath I'm gonna start this discussion by looking at this example that has two vectors a vector called I need Simon is telling me that I didn't do vector multiplication exactly that's exactly what I'm going to end up needing to do and magnitude all this is gonna come up this is how I'm doing it okay it's not cold in here it's warm the example that I'm going to work with starts with just two variables v1 and v2 and they're two vectors one with X&Y of 200 200 one with X&Y of 100 zero so what I'm doing in this is I'm drawing a line between the location opposite I'm drawing the line between the position v1 x v1 dot y and the result of adding v1 and v2 together well well let me just start this whole thing over Oh I can't do this without this the static thing is making me crazy I really just need to I think I need to do the I you know anything through the static one first or I should just be less crazy about this you know what I got it I got it everybody oh I'm such a doodoo doodoo face I know what I'm gonna do I have a much simpler way of doing this I got it I want to do the other thing but I need to talk about static functions that's why it was okay there we go okay hello so this is another video on working with vectors and p5.js and in this video I really just want to talk about what it means to make a random vector which seems like why is there even a whole video about that but I have a point to this which I will get to um it also was I think useful because it's kind of opening up this can of worms vector e worms which I want to open up because I'm gonna end up looking at some other math functions that I need it's gonna lead me to something about static functions but that'll be in the next video right now I just want to look at this example that I have and what I have here is first of all notice I'm translating the coordinate space to the center of the canvas this is very important because I want to treat just for this visual demonstration I want to treat zero zero as the center of this canvas then I'm making a vector with an X component of 100 and a Y component of zero and I'm representing the vector as a line from zero zero to the x and y so it would be nice if I could draw a little hat on the end so it looks like an arrow but that's gonna be too much work I could change these numbers you know negative 150 and you can see there's my line so let's just think about first what would it mean to pick a random vector well the first instinct might be this which is a very reasonable instinct let's make a vector that has between negative 100 and 100 as it's X and this is gonna start getting very long I'm gonna have to drag this way over negative 100 as it's y that's like the range of stuff that I'm picking and if I run the sketch you know every single frame it is picking a new value for x and y and I'm seeing that line point often in directions so this is a random vector generator in a way and but I want to show you something a little bit odd which is that if I take background 0 and put it into setup what do you expect to see I'm going to see collect over time every single vector that points from anywhere from 0 0 to what something with an x and y minimum maximum between negative 100 100 let's run this I'm gonna let this play out for a little bit look at that result I am seeing all of the vectors fill up a square it's the worst drawn square ever write any vector this vector this vector this vector this vector right because minimum maximum this is you know this is zero zero in many cases when working with vectors however it's quite common that you want to pick a vector with a random direction but a fixed magnitude what do I mean by that here the direction and the magnitude it's all random and the magnitude even has kind of this arbitrary range because this is the longest vector possible but if I go to extend to here this one is actually shorter what would it mean for me to pick vectors that fill out a circle well there is something in that there is something called a unit vector and a unit vector is a kind of vector which really just a unit vector is a vector that talks about that the unit vector is a vector of length one that's the unit with any with with any direction so it's a kind of vector that you use when you only really want to talk about the direction then the magnet doesn't matter let's just pick one as a standard and let's now pick a direction so what if I wanted to pick any unit vector any vector of length one but in any direction whoops so I could start to look into some trigonometry math to do this and I will come to that soon enough but instead of instead of had you know but one of the benefits of working with vectors in p5.js is there's a function that'll pick a random unit vector for you and that function is just called random 2d because I want a random 2d vector V equals P v dot vector dot random 2d now there's something really odd about this which is I'm calling this function random 2d p v dot vector dot random 2d la what is all that so this is veering off into this other topic about static functions and I'm gonna talk about that and cover that in the next video but for right now let's just understand this as a function that returns a random unit vector so now if I were to run this Oh what's going on here oh look at all those random unit vectors they're all of length one well I can't really visually see what's going on because one pixel isn't very much I could use a scale I could try using the scale function to kind of blow things up but this is a really nice opportunity for me to talk about another vector math function multiply where we timewise all the good is they gotta go I'm gonna finish this out I think I had this by the way something like this remember when I had vectors a and B and I said a plus B is add the X's together add the Y's together and I'll get eight comma three that's dessert the numbers I used before but I think this math is correct now and and and the function in p5 to do this was added now what if I wanted to use the idea of multiplication with vectors oh my goodness could I say a times B I kind of can but vector multiplication the vector product is a whole other topic that I'll cover eventually but you might have heard of things like the dot product or the cross product or the hard meru how what's that called the hat miroux the heart no that's Hadamard product or even something called the Hadamard product but I'm not covering those now when I say vector multiplication I'm talking about scaling a vector well when I say multiplication when I'm referring to this function in p5 called mult for multiply I'm talking about scaling the vector multiplying the vector by a scalar quantity so in other words I'm talking about saying a times not another vector but like the number 2 and what do I mean when I say that if I have a vector that's pointing in a given direction with a given magnitude like 3 so let's actually make it 5 because I'm gonna use the 3 4 5 triangle if I multiply it by 2 now I have that same vector so it's sorry no I have a different vector but it's the same direction with lengths twice as much so the length of this vector is 10 and the way that this works is if it's a three four five if the components are three and four because it's a 3 4 5 triangle then all I have to do is multiply each component so if I want to take a and multiply it by 2 the vector I would get is 6 comma 8 3 times 2 4.com times 2 so in this case after I picked this random unit vector which has length 1 I can scale it to any quantity by saying V multiplied 100 and think about what's gonna happen now I'm gonna run this sketch and I get any vector always of length 100 pointing in any direction this opens up incidentally a lot of possible just like visual possibilities just from this alone and certainly I could change this and say Oh any vector between 50 and 100 and I should probably give this some alpha to sort of see and we can see now I have any vector it's a minimum length 50 maximum length 100 and just from that I'm getting this sort of like nice visualization that would be harder to do without these builtin functions in vectors but so this though there's a lot more to this I might return back it might be useful now to return back to this random Walker example and I can see now I'm sorry before I move on let's just quickly move back to this Walker example and see that I could now say this top velocity equals P 5 vector random 2d and this would now be a way of taking a Walker and every time I run the sketch it's going to go in a random direction the speed the magnitude of the velocity is always going to be one so I could also randomize that to some value between like zero and three whoops this dot velocity dot multiplied whoops and now you're seeing just another way of thinking about how you might initialize something with randomness and maybe Perlin noise could play a role here is there some way you can create an array of all these walkers with initial velocities according to Perlin noise if you go back and look at my Perlin noise videos that might create some interesting trails you could consider but i'm but but i'm going to stop here and let you do some variations on this now that you see about how random 2d works and multiply works there is another aspect to this though that I want to unpack which is what does it mean to call a function like dot multiply which is on a vector V versus a function like random 2d which is not on a specific vector but on the type of thing itself P v dot vector so I'm gonna come back and that's what that's called a static function I'm gonna cover that in a separate video and then after that we'll be ready to start looking at acceleration and all the other good stuff magnitude and normalize and all that sort of stuff ok so thanks for watching this one and I'll see you in the next one bye okay alright everyone I've got to go thank you for tuning in I don't know why I don't hear that oh I hear it now um Oh Valentine's Day coding challenge oh no I know I'm gonna get give me an idea huh shoot all right I've got to go thank you for watching I can try to answer a question or two time assign me to spin the wheel for the command I'm not prepared to do that today so I'll have to do that another time I don't think I have the I don't remember what's on the list I don't have a link to the wheel we need but someday we'll have all sorts of systems like this so these will come out as edited videos okay you know it might take out some time stay tuned you know but I don't I I know I said the videos the hilbert curve Cabana video will be released tomorrow that's the plan but you know let me just say by Monday at the latest sometime this weekend heart curve I did the heart curve last year Marcos you have a good nice weekend also I've got a lot of things going on today what else what sweaters like reminders you can check out the new coding train store as standard TV slash coding train you can add your contributions to your projects you make on the coding train website please join the discord the stay tuned by the way one thing I'll show you is working on some new thumbnails these are sort of in progress when I say I on this were designed by Simon who designs thumbnails for standard although I'm making some tweaks with Jason who did these illustrations but this is the these are the two that I did so far and the hilbert curve should be here very soon what else I think that's it can you do oh I'll be a processing community day tomorrow if any of you are going to prosecute a in New York there's also just sort of like more generally there's community to a worldwide which I'm in the wrong place yes so if you're interested in attending an event where you can meet people in real life take a look at all these community days happen all over the world projectile motion coding challenge that's a great idea so that could be interesting to do some once I get through a lot of these basics to pick sort of a topic that could be a coding challenge that's based on those I like that idea somebody to remind you that have you seen in Twitter I mentioned doing a nice tweet where a I cannot recognize optical illusion between a hare and a duck Alexi I did not see that I'll have to try to take a look for that all right thanks everybody goodbye have a wonderful weekend and I will see you next week hopefully is next week the week that I'm away yes but I'm not leaving till Friday so next week Thursday or Friday there'll be a live stream okay hopefully this is the ending animation autotuned and the internet will fix that unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it does not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do I'm really getting something I need my sound that was invalid syntax I forgot generation analysis things so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven this is like Perlin noise performance part like birthing noise performance apart with curling noise I might pick numbers like this by purling noise that is early noise so this is hurling noise that is Hurley noise this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no so this is Hurley noise this is but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this like I always forget to do this this star this star this star this star song never forget the Vista somebody composed that song for me
