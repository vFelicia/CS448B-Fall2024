00:00 - oh hello and welcome to a Cody challenge
00:02 - tic-tac-toe Oh with the minimax
00:06 - algorithm that's why I'm here because I
00:08 - made this other coding challenge
00:09 - tic-tac-toe where I created a kind of a
00:11 - big it was kind of a mess if I'm being
00:13 - perfectly honest but I made a working
00:14 - version of the tic-tac-toe game that
00:16 - just played with two players picking
00:18 - random spots so since then and you can
00:21 - check one of my live streams if you want
00:22 - to find where I did this I made some
00:24 - adjustments to it so that I could as a
00:26 - human being play the game so right now
00:28 - I'm going to play the random computer
00:30 - picker I'm gonna I'm gonna go here and
00:32 - then I'm gonna block X and I'm gonna go
00:34 - here I win Owens so what I have the
00:38 - adjustment that I made is that I added a
00:41 - mouse pressed function where I find
00:44 - where did I click and I put my human
00:48 - variable which is the letter O onto the
00:51 - board and then I called next turn where
00:53 - next turn picks a random spot in the
00:56 - board and makes that the AI spot or X's
00:59 - spot so the whole point of this video is
01:02 - for me to implement something called
01:04 - minimax
01:05 - which is an algorithm a search algorithm
01:08 - if you will to find the optimal next
01:11 - move for the a I mean it could find it
01:13 - for myself and then I could implement it
01:14 - but the idea is I want this player the
01:17 - computer player to beat me at the game
01:19 - or at least tie to play a perfect game
01:21 - and if you want to learn more about the
01:22 - minimax algorithm I would suggest to
01:24 - resources that you can look at that I
01:26 - actually looked at before beginning this
01:27 - coding challenge haven't programmed this
01:29 - before but I watched this video by
01:31 - Sebastian leg
01:32 - that explains the minimax algorithm also
01:34 - something called alpha beta pruning
01:35 - which I'm not going to implement but
01:37 - could be a good exercise next step for
01:39 - you and I also found this article on the
01:41 - geeks for geeks org website which has a
01:44 - three part series about the minimax
01:46 - algorithm and how to apply it to
01:48 - tic-tac-toe so those resources are
01:50 - probably your best bet for learning
01:51 - about the theory of the minimax
01:53 - algorithm and how it can be applied to a
01:55 - wide variety of scenarios but I'm going
01:58 - to look at the specifics of tic-tac-toe
02:00 - which is a great starting example
02:02 - because it's a simple enough game that I
02:04 - could actually diagram out all of the
02:06 - possibilities which even if that's
02:08 - computationally possible is very hard to
02:10 - diagram and there's lots of scenarios
02:11 - where
02:12 - couldn't even compute all the possible
02:14 - outcomes and chess is an example of that
02:16 - so minimax is typically visualized as a
02:19 - tree so the root of the tree is the
02:21 - current state of the game board so I've
02:27 - drawn a configuration here of the
02:29 - tic-tac-toe board midway through the
02:30 - game because I don't want to start at
02:32 - the beginning where there's so many
02:33 - possibilities that I couldn't diagram it
02:35 - so right now it's X's turn and X has
02:38 - three possible moves so I could express
02:41 - that in a tree diagram as move one move
02:45 - two and move three so let's take a look
02:48 - at what I mean by that I'm going to use
02:51 - a blue marker so you can see the new
02:53 - moves so let's say one possible move is
02:55 - X going here let me diagram out the next
02:58 - two possible moves another possible move
03:03 - is X going here and another possible
03:08 - move move is X going here so we need to
03:11 - look at eight each of these and
03:12 - determine is the game over or is it
03:15 - continuing so only in this case is the
03:18 - game over and in this case the game is
03:20 - over and X has won so I'm gonna mark
03:24 - this green for the state of X having won
03:27 - the game
03:28 - now it's o's turn and for each of these
03:30 - spots o could make has two possible
03:33 - options
03:36 - Oh could go here ro could go here Oh
03:43 - could go here
03:45 - RR Oh could go here and look at these in
03:48 - this case and this case Oh has one
03:51 - remember we're trying to solve for the
03:54 - optimal move for X X is making the first
03:56 - turn so this means I can mark these were
03:59 - Owens as red I was like those are bad
04:03 - outcomes so while these are not terminal
04:06 - states there's only one move possible
04:08 - for X so I could draw an arrow and put
04:09 - that down here but ultimately I can just
04:11 - consider this as x has to go here so
04:14 - these you could consider as terminal and
04:16 - in which case X will win now you see
04:20 - that I visualized all the possible
04:22 - outcomes of the tic-tac-toe game based
04:25 - on this starting configuration so how
04:28 - does X pick which path to go down where
04:31 - we can see here that the goal is for X
04:34 - to win the game to get to here here or
04:36 - there how does it do that and the way
04:38 - that it does by the way spoiler alert
04:41 - this is the move it should pick it
04:42 - should just win instantly but the idea
04:45 - of the minimax algorithm is if we can
04:48 - score every possible outcome those
04:51 - scores can ripple back up the tree and
04:53 - help X decide which way to go to find
04:57 - the highest possible score then they
04:59 - think about tic-tac-toe is there's not a
05:01 - range of scores the end points are
05:05 - either you won you lost are you tied I
05:07 - can say if X wins it's a score of +1 if
05:11 - a wins it's a score of negative 1 and if
05:15 - it's a tie it's a score of 0 so in other
05:18 - words we can give this a score of plus 1
05:21 - this is score of plus 1 this is score of
05:24 - negative 1
05:25 - this is score of negative 1 and this a
05:28 - score of plus 1 but we've got an issue
05:31 - I'm trying to pick between this option
05:33 - this option in this option these two
05:35 - don't have a score how do I pick their
05:37 - score well I can pick their score based
05:40 - on which one of these would be picked
05:42 - but who's picking these this is why the
05:46 - algorithm is called me
05:48 - max because we have two players each
05:55 - trying to make an optimal score X is
05:59 - what's known as the maximizing player so
06:02 - to go from here to here it's X's turn
06:04 - and X is maximizing but here it's now
06:10 - O's turns o wants to win X can assume
06:15 - that o is going to play their optimal
06:18 - smooth now you could have a situation
06:21 - where your player doesn't play optimally
06:24 - and that's something you might have to
06:24 - consider in terms of game theory but in
06:27 - this case of the algorithm we can assume
06:29 - that o is going to make the best
06:30 - possible move I mean if it makes a worse
06:32 - move that's only better for us anyway so
06:34 - it's all gonna work out so o is what's
06:36 - referred to as the minimizing player the
06:40 - minimizing player so o has the option of
06:43 - picking negative 1 or plus 1 negative 1
06:46 - or +1 which one is o going to picks pick
06:49 - as the minimizing player the option to
06:52 - win so we can then take the best outcome
06:55 - for O the minimizing outcome for O and
06:58 - pass that back up here's the score and
07:00 - the same thing here now X is the
07:04 - maximizing player which one of these is
07:06 - gonna pick negative 1 plus 1 or negative
07:08 - 1 these are negative 1 because even
07:10 - though it could win here if X goes this
07:14 - way o is gonna win if X goes this way oh
07:16 - it's gonna win if a plays optimally so
07:18 - this is the way to go this scenario that
07:21 - I picked might not be the best
07:23 - demonstration of the idea in fact
07:25 - there's no ties here there's only two
07:27 - turns being played so you may be what
07:30 - you might want to do is pause this video
07:31 - and do the same exact diagram but have X
07:35 - and O with two starting positions and
07:37 - see if you can diagram that whole thing
07:39 - out yourself so how do we implement this
07:42 - in code so that your first clue should
07:44 - be the fact that this is a tree diagram
07:46 - and each time you see a tree diagram
07:48 - typically speaking a recursive algorithm
07:51 - a function that calls itself is
07:53 - something that will apply in this case
07:56 - is no different I want to call minimax
07:58 - on this board position
08:02 - try and then loop through all the
08:04 - possible moves and call minimax on each
08:06 - one of these board positions loop
08:08 - through all the possible moves if I ever
08:10 - get to an end point return the score and
08:13 - have that score backtrack up or ripple
08:16 - back up the chain so let's see if we can
08:18 - write the code to do this so this here
08:21 - is the place where I want to write the
08:22 - new code currently a move is chosen by
08:26 - picking a random available spot and I no
08:28 - longer want to do that so I'm gonna I'm
08:30 - actually gonna change the name of this
08:32 - function to best move and I don't need
08:34 - to worry about this what's available
08:36 - I just want to actually look at all the
08:39 - possible spots so basically I just want
08:42 - to know is the spot available if the
08:47 - spot is available I want to try going
08:49 - there so I'm going to say board i j is
08:52 - the AI player and then i want to call
08:55 - minimax on the board why do I want to
08:57 - call minimax because I want to get what
08:59 - is the score
09:00 - I want minimax with to return to me the
09:03 - score for this particular move now it's
09:07 - gonna have to recursively check these
09:09 - two spots but we'll get that we're
09:10 - getting there ultimately though I need
09:12 - to figure out which one was the best so
09:14 - I need to keep track by saying like the
09:17 - best score is negative infinity if score
09:22 - is greater than the best score then
09:29 - that's the new best score and the best
09:32 - move is this particular IJ and let me
09:36 - declare best move so again I haven't
09:44 - implemented minimax yet I'm just getting
09:46 - the basic idea down for the very
09:49 - furthest turn I need to start by looking
09:52 - at all the possible moves get the score
09:55 - for those by calling this mysterious
09:56 - minimax function and I'm about to write
09:58 - and find the best one then apply that
10:00 - move there's a big issue here though
10:02 - because I am changing the global
10:04 - variable board
10:05 - I am altering the game I am moving X to
10:08 - that spot and then moving X to the next
10:09 - spot so I could make a copy of the board
10:11 - but I think an easy way to deal with
10:13 - this would actually just be to undo it
10:15 - so right afterwards I'm gonna just
10:17 - quickly undo that move the next step
10:20 - would be to write the minimax function
10:21 - that rule II write the algorithm itself
10:23 - I kind of want to know to see if there's
10:25 - any errors here so actually what I'm
10:26 - gonna do is I'm just gonna put a
10:27 - placeholder function in minimax which
10:30 - receives a board and then I'm just gonna
10:31 - return the score of 1 so minimax is
10:34 - always going to return the score of 1
10:35 - meaning it's not gonna be able to pick
10:38 - it's just gonna they're all gonna be a
10:39 - tie so it's good always gonna pick the
10:41 - first one but let's let's see how that
10:43 - goes next turn is not defined because I
10:47 - called it best move and it's in one more
10:51 - place here in setup okay where it went
10:56 - there watch it's gonna go to the next
10:58 - available spot to the next available
11:01 - spot to the next available spot so you
11:04 - can see this is working it's working the
11:07 - sense that the algorithm is making a
11:08 - choice but no matter what it's always
11:11 - just going to go in order of the board
11:13 - and Oh X 1 there's also a big issue here
11:17 - which thankfully didn't no major
11:19 - problems happen but I named this
11:21 - function best move and then it created a
11:23 - variable inside of the function with the
11:24 - same name which you know you're always
11:26 - run into trouble so let me actually just
11:27 - change this to move sort of by
11:29 - definition it is the best move make sure
11:35 - this still works
11:36 - all right X is just picking straight
11:38 - down now the hard part I need to write
11:41 - the minimax function itself so one thing
11:44 - that I skip skipped here which is
11:45 - typical of a minimax algorithm is I
11:47 - would also keep track of the depth
11:49 - because ultimately I could want to
11:52 - consider like how long is it taking me
11:54 - to get somewhere what is the depth of
11:57 - the tree that I'm on so that's something
11:58 - that you'll you'll see often within the
12:01 - algorithm implementation so let me add
12:02 - that so I add an argument depth here and
12:08 - then give it a zero at first oh you know
12:10 - what I need another really important
12:12 - argument this is a turn-based game and
12:16 - the algorithm is going to behave
12:18 - differently whether it is the maximizing
12:20 - player's turn X or the minimizing
12:23 - player's turn o in this case again you
12:25 - could have more than two players or
12:27 - there could be a lot of we
12:29 - stuff going on but that's ultimately
12:31 - what I need here so let me also add is
12:36 - maximizing is maximizing and the this
12:40 - here would be true right so I want to
12:44 - perform minimax on this board with the
12:46 - starting depth of zero and the first
12:48 - move is the maximizing player so let's
12:50 - say I'm maximizing what do I want to do
12:53 - actually what I want to do even before
12:55 - this is check to see if somebody won so
13:00 - I'm pretty sure I already have a check
13:02 - winner function that's something that I
13:04 - wrote in the previous coding challenge
13:05 - let me double check that check winner
13:09 - the winner is null and then by the end
13:13 - it returns a tie it returns null a tie
13:16 - or the winner so the score is and let's
13:20 - let's make a little lookup table that's
13:23 - basically exactly what I wrote here if X
13:27 - wins it's a 0 if a wins is a negative 1
13:29 - if it's a tie it's a 0 all right so this
13:34 - is my lookup table for what the score
13:37 - then and again it's a very simple
13:38 - scenario there's only three possible
13:40 - scores if the result is not equal to
13:42 - null the score is the associating that
13:47 - the number associated with this
13:48 - particular oh it got rid of those I
13:50 - didn't need those quotes oh Visual
13:52 - Studio code just clean that up for me
13:54 - thank you very much the score is based
13:56 - on whoever won and then I can return
13:58 - that so this would be the terminal
14:01 - condition if I am calling minimax on
14:04 - this particular board configuration at
14:06 - this particular depth and it's an end
14:09 - state if it's a terminal state just
14:11 - return the score that's what I'm
14:12 - supposed to do if it's not a terminal
14:17 - State if it's not this state I can't
14:21 - just return the score I need to check
14:22 - all the possible next moves so I got
14:25 - this wrong actually the next move right
14:28 - I'm actually this is the AI player
14:30 - trying to trying a spot there move so
14:33 - the next move is actually not the
14:35 - maximizing player this should be false
14:37 - but I'll better write this as if it is
14:39 - so if it's the maximizing player
14:42 - I can copy-paste that from above check
14:45 - all the spa possible spots again if it's
14:50 - available try you know now that's the
14:54 - human right then oh no this is the AI
14:56 - I'm confused because currently the way
14:58 - I'm stepping through this it's in my
15:00 - mind it's o's turn but i'm writing the
15:02 - code for both whether it's x's turn or o
15:04 - certain so for the sake of argument
15:05 - it's x's turn right now so i'm checking
15:08 - all of those spots and then i'm going to
15:10 - say return no I need to check how you
15:14 - defined I define the best move I'm kind
15:16 - of doing what I did again is there a way
15:18 - for me to reduce the amount of code I'm
15:19 - writing I'm not going to worry about
15:21 - this I want to once again find the best
15:23 - score which will be in this case
15:25 - negative infinity and I want to say the
15:29 - score is the minimax algorithm of the
15:33 - board at depth plus one and now the next
15:37 - players turn is false
15:40 - because I'm the maximizing player and
15:41 - then I'm going to undo this just like I
15:44 - did before
15:44 - why do I have to write this code twice
15:46 - I'll think about later if I can refactor
15:48 - this to only do it once if score is
15:51 - greater than best score best score is
15:56 - equal to score and then after all of
15:59 - this for loop for loop if it's an empty
16:03 - spot boom boom return the best score so
16:11 - this is finding the best score for all
16:14 - the possible next turns by the AI player
16:18 - or if it's not the AI player if it's the
16:23 - minimizing player we could do exactly
16:24 - the same thing and again maybe there's a
16:27 - way and I've I'm missing a curly bracket
16:31 - yes thank you there's a curly bracket so
16:35 - this is very important there's a lot of
16:36 - ifs and four-state for loops here so
16:38 - maybe there's also a nice way to
16:39 - refactor this make it more readable but
16:41 - if it's the maximising player check all
16:43 - the spots find the best possible outcome
16:46 - and return it but call minimax
16:48 - recursively and the next future move and
16:51 - then here I'm going to start write the
16:53 - minimizing player wants to find the
16:55 - best score for it which is the lowest
16:57 - score so and that's the human player and
17:01 - if the score is less than the best score
17:04 - and then return that best score whew oh
17:11 - forget about this return one I'm gonna
17:13 - stare at this to make sure on my mic my
17:15 - curly brackets line up if if for four
17:21 - and then return the best score otherwise
17:24 - if if for four and return the best score
17:28 - I think this might actually be good
17:30 - should we just try it error on line 33
17:38 - which will hold on Richard oh this
17:40 - should be ah look at this so this is a
17:42 - huge mistake here return true why did I
17:44 - have that there I don't know why did
17:46 - that that's return score this should be
17:48 - returned score the whole point of this
17:50 - and I don't even need a separate
17:51 - variable here I can just say returns
17:53 - scores result right so this is any kind
17:55 - of recursive function needs a terminal
17:58 - condition needs to exit right this
18:00 - function is always going to keep calling
18:02 - itself and calling itself minimax
18:04 - minimax minimax minimax I don't know
18:11 - what this extra code isn't here and
18:14 - minimax okay oh yes assignment is
18:19 - pointing out something to me which is
18:20 - great which I don't need this if
18:22 - statement to find the best score the
18:24 - whole point of this video and also
18:26 - there's a great chess where you use the
18:27 - min function in the max function because
18:29 - it's the minimax algorithm so I can
18:31 - actually say score is the lower one the
18:35 - minimum between score and best score
18:37 - it's going to make it way easier to read
18:40 - thank you and oh no but this one is Max
18:44 - is Max and then this one oh thank you
18:47 - for this I don't know why I didn't think
18:48 - of this I'm sure it's in every
18:51 - implementation score is the minimum
18:53 - between score and best score so this
18:57 - makes it much more much easier to read
18:59 - here okay let's try it let's try it why
19:04 - not
19:04 - caution to the wind
19:06 - okay excellent and the top left that's
19:09 - definitely the optimal place to go they
19:11 - go here no no bad X bad X you're not
19:18 - going in the right place yeah I be -
19:22 - you're still going in order why are you
19:27 - still going in order
19:28 - oh whoa you're not going in order you're
19:32 - making weird decisions oh oh I see the
19:38 - error I see the error of my ways this
19:40 - has to be true right after the
19:43 - maximizing players turn its the
19:46 - minimizing players turn after the
19:48 - minimizing players turn it's the
19:50 - maximizing players turn okay that's a
19:57 - good move X I see what you did there why
20:04 - can't you figure out to go there X oh
20:10 - okay
20:12 - this I'm finding this this is the score
20:16 - is the new score and the best score
20:18 - should be the bigger one the maximum
20:21 - between to score and best score not
20:22 - score ah this has to be this because I'm
20:26 - returning best score and this s Venus
20:29 - okay okay let's see I really should not
20:34 - continue to play this
20:38 - come on X figure out where to go okay
20:41 - I'm gonna go here that's in the wrong
20:50 - place it's in the wrong part I new look
20:53 - like brackets bad brackets I need to
20:55 - return the best score hello after I've
20:57 - checked all of the possibilities meaning
20:59 - both four loops the I and the J have
21:02 - completed I got that right up here but
21:05 - not down here oh okay I really think
21:09 - we've got it this time
21:11 - Tiffany's housed
21:13 - ah tie alright alright you we're gonna
21:26 - go into competition now I'm gonna I'm
21:29 - gonna let you win by going here ah
21:33 - so if I don't go in if I go in a corner
21:36 - yet if I don't go to the middle it's
21:39 - always gonna win so X is always gonna
21:41 - win unless I go to the middle in which
21:44 - case it's always gonna be a tie unless I
21:46 - make a mistake and then it's gonna win
21:47 - but if I go to any other spot X is going
21:51 - to be able to win because it's always
21:53 - gonna so one thing that might be
21:58 - interesting for me to try here really
22:00 - quickly before I sort of finish off this
22:01 - challenge would just be to comment out
22:03 - the AI going first so I know this is
22:06 - technically incorrect cuz X is supposed
22:08 - to go first but let's see what happens
22:09 - if I start with a fresh bolt forward and
22:11 - I go first so I'm gonna go here I'm
22:14 - gonna go here oh it's high am i oh etic
22:20 - something became undefined oh if I go
22:24 - last I guess there's no move for X and
22:26 - I've got it here so that's things like
22:27 - can I beat uh no I lost I don't believe
22:34 - there's any way for me to beat the AI
22:36 - player it's a solved game because it's
22:38 - always gonna go to the center so I could
22:41 - try going here I could go here go here
22:43 - and I'm the best I could do is a tie so
22:46 - you've watched this coding challenge
22:47 - maybe you have a creative idea about how
22:49 - to make your own version of this but I
22:51 - just quickly whipped up thanks to the
22:53 - chat in the live stream also some
22:55 - suggestions of things you could try so
22:57 - first of all what happens if you just
22:58 - make two AI players that just play
23:01 - against each other over and over again
23:02 - well in that case it's gonna be a tie
23:04 - every single time it's a solve game but
23:06 - that might lead to some interesting
23:08 - possibilities um one thing that I'm not
23:10 - using is using the depths in the score
23:12 - so for example if I go back to the code
23:14 - and I change these to say 10 and
23:17 - negative 10
23:18 - I could account for the depth meaning I
23:20 - could have a higher score if I win more
23:23 - quickly than if it takes longer to win
23:25 - right now I'm not accounting for that
23:27 - so where in the code would you subtract
23:29 - out depth that's something you could try
23:30 - certainly it would be interesting to
23:33 - make a larger board so can you play
23:35 - trick tic-tac-toe in a five by five or a
23:37 - seven by seven you the winning
23:39 - conditions would change
23:40 - the optimal play would change that would
23:42 - be exciting to try I hope somebody does
23:44 - that you could try more players like how
23:46 - would you have a tic-tac-toe game with
23:48 - three players that's something you'd
23:50 - write with a larger board you could try
23:52 - another game let me connect four would
23:53 - work that might be able apply minimax to
23:56 - just thinking about the interface
23:59 - animation like right now how whenever
24:01 - whenever I go the next turn happens
24:04 - immediately you could have you could
24:05 - think about timing and that sort of
24:06 - thing
24:07 - but then I always say high degree of
24:10 - difficulty and maybe worth me coming
24:12 - back to in a future video at some point
24:14 - would be these two last items one is
24:17 - known as alpha beta pruning alpha beta
24:20 - pruning refers to the aspect of the
24:24 - minimax algorithm where you find an
24:26 - optimal path and you know that all the
24:29 - other possibilities are going to be
24:31 - worse and you don't need to go forth and
24:33 - check every possibility so you could
24:35 - research how that works
24:36 - and add it to this algorithm it's
24:38 - explained in the Sebastian lag video
24:40 - then there's a possibility of a game
24:42 - where the number of moves is so vast you
24:45 - couldn't possibly compute the entire
24:48 - tree chess is the classic example of
24:51 - that so you need some heuristic or a way
24:53 - of an estimated guess of what the score
24:56 - could be with any given state so one way
24:58 - of doing this which I'm not saying is a
25:00 - good strategy but a simple thing you
25:02 - could do with chess is you could add up
25:03 - the total number of white pieces versus
25:06 - black pieces but you could say like well
25:08 - the score is higher if you have if the
25:09 - maximizing Claire has more pieces than
25:12 - the opponent so that's one way of
25:14 - approaching it so you don't actually
25:16 - stop at the end of the tree but you just
25:18 - go some pre-determined depth and then
25:21 - calculate an estimate and have that
25:23 - ripple back up the tree so you maybe
25:26 - give that a try with a more complex game
25:27 - um certainly other types of AI
25:30 - algorithms that neural networks could
25:32 - play a role at some point with how you
25:33 - make that estimate but ultimately that
25:37 - that is something that would be
25:38 - interesting to try as well
25:40 - one more idea that just came from the
25:42 - chat so this is quite similar to the
25:43 - idea of a larger board but instead of
25:45 - just a larger 2-dimensional board you
25:47 - could create a 3-dimensional board so
25:49 - tic-tac-toe that happens in a cube I
25:51 - should just do that as a coding
25:52 - challenge separately myself
25:54 - so hopefully you learned something and
25:56 - maybe this algorithm that looked a
25:57 - little terrifying to you at one point
25:59 - now seems quite accessible and doable
26:01 - um maybe your creative idea is not on
26:03 - this list please make your own version
26:06 - of this share it with me at the coding
26:08 - train com there will be a link in this
26:10 - video's description with instructions
26:11 - for how to share it if you don't know
26:13 - how to share it just write a comment
26:15 - file an issue we the coding train
26:17 - community are here to help you oh and I
26:20 - can't wait to see you in a future video
26:21 - goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

oh hello and welcome to a Cody challenge tictactoe Oh with the minimax algorithm that's why I'm here because I made this other coding challenge tictactoe where I created a kind of a big it was kind of a mess if I'm being perfectly honest but I made a working version of the tictactoe game that just played with two players picking random spots so since then and you can check one of my live streams if you want to find where I did this I made some adjustments to it so that I could as a human being play the game so right now I'm going to play the random computer picker I'm gonna I'm gonna go here and then I'm gonna block X and I'm gonna go here I win Owens so what I have the adjustment that I made is that I added a mouse pressed function where I find where did I click and I put my human variable which is the letter O onto the board and then I called next turn where next turn picks a random spot in the board and makes that the AI spot or X's spot so the whole point of this video is for me to implement something called minimax which is an algorithm a search algorithm if you will to find the optimal next move for the a I mean it could find it for myself and then I could implement it but the idea is I want this player the computer player to beat me at the game or at least tie to play a perfect game and if you want to learn more about the minimax algorithm I would suggest to resources that you can look at that I actually looked at before beginning this coding challenge haven't programmed this before but I watched this video by Sebastian leg that explains the minimax algorithm also something called alpha beta pruning which I'm not going to implement but could be a good exercise next step for you and I also found this article on the geeks for geeks org website which has a three part series about the minimax algorithm and how to apply it to tictactoe so those resources are probably your best bet for learning about the theory of the minimax algorithm and how it can be applied to a wide variety of scenarios but I'm going to look at the specifics of tictactoe which is a great starting example because it's a simple enough game that I could actually diagram out all of the possibilities which even if that's computationally possible is very hard to diagram and there's lots of scenarios where couldn't even compute all the possible outcomes and chess is an example of that so minimax is typically visualized as a tree so the root of the tree is the current state of the game board so I've drawn a configuration here of the tictactoe board midway through the game because I don't want to start at the beginning where there's so many possibilities that I couldn't diagram it so right now it's X's turn and X has three possible moves so I could express that in a tree diagram as move one move two and move three so let's take a look at what I mean by that I'm going to use a blue marker so you can see the new moves so let's say one possible move is X going here let me diagram out the next two possible moves another possible move is X going here and another possible move move is X going here so we need to look at eight each of these and determine is the game over or is it continuing so only in this case is the game over and in this case the game is over and X has won so I'm gonna mark this green for the state of X having won the game now it's o's turn and for each of these spots o could make has two possible options Oh could go here ro could go here Oh could go here RR Oh could go here and look at these in this case and this case Oh has one remember we're trying to solve for the optimal move for X X is making the first turn so this means I can mark these were Owens as red I was like those are bad outcomes so while these are not terminal states there's only one move possible for X so I could draw an arrow and put that down here but ultimately I can just consider this as x has to go here so these you could consider as terminal and in which case X will win now you see that I visualized all the possible outcomes of the tictactoe game based on this starting configuration so how does X pick which path to go down where we can see here that the goal is for X to win the game to get to here here or there how does it do that and the way that it does by the way spoiler alert this is the move it should pick it should just win instantly but the idea of the minimax algorithm is if we can score every possible outcome those scores can ripple back up the tree and help X decide which way to go to find the highest possible score then they think about tictactoe is there's not a range of scores the end points are either you won you lost are you tied I can say if X wins it's a score of +1 if a wins it's a score of negative 1 and if it's a tie it's a score of 0 so in other words we can give this a score of plus 1 this is score of plus 1 this is score of negative 1 this is score of negative 1 and this a score of plus 1 but we've got an issue I'm trying to pick between this option this option in this option these two don't have a score how do I pick their score well I can pick their score based on which one of these would be picked but who's picking these this is why the algorithm is called me max because we have two players each trying to make an optimal score X is what's known as the maximizing player so to go from here to here it's X's turn and X is maximizing but here it's now O's turns o wants to win X can assume that o is going to play their optimal smooth now you could have a situation where your player doesn't play optimally and that's something you might have to consider in terms of game theory but in this case of the algorithm we can assume that o is going to make the best possible move I mean if it makes a worse move that's only better for us anyway so it's all gonna work out so o is what's referred to as the minimizing player the minimizing player so o has the option of picking negative 1 or plus 1 negative 1 or +1 which one is o going to picks pick as the minimizing player the option to win so we can then take the best outcome for O the minimizing outcome for O and pass that back up here's the score and the same thing here now X is the maximizing player which one of these is gonna pick negative 1 plus 1 or negative 1 these are negative 1 because even though it could win here if X goes this way o is gonna win if X goes this way oh it's gonna win if a plays optimally so this is the way to go this scenario that I picked might not be the best demonstration of the idea in fact there's no ties here there's only two turns being played so you may be what you might want to do is pause this video and do the same exact diagram but have X and O with two starting positions and see if you can diagram that whole thing out yourself so how do we implement this in code so that your first clue should be the fact that this is a tree diagram and each time you see a tree diagram typically speaking a recursive algorithm a function that calls itself is something that will apply in this case is no different I want to call minimax on this board position try and then loop through all the possible moves and call minimax on each one of these board positions loop through all the possible moves if I ever get to an end point return the score and have that score backtrack up or ripple back up the chain so let's see if we can write the code to do this so this here is the place where I want to write the new code currently a move is chosen by picking a random available spot and I no longer want to do that so I'm gonna I'm actually gonna change the name of this function to best move and I don't need to worry about this what's available I just want to actually look at all the possible spots so basically I just want to know is the spot available if the spot is available I want to try going there so I'm going to say board i j is the AI player and then i want to call minimax on the board why do I want to call minimax because I want to get what is the score I want minimax with to return to me the score for this particular move now it's gonna have to recursively check these two spots but we'll get that we're getting there ultimately though I need to figure out which one was the best so I need to keep track by saying like the best score is negative infinity if score is greater than the best score then that's the new best score and the best move is this particular IJ and let me declare best move so again I haven't implemented minimax yet I'm just getting the basic idea down for the very furthest turn I need to start by looking at all the possible moves get the score for those by calling this mysterious minimax function and I'm about to write and find the best one then apply that move there's a big issue here though because I am changing the global variable board I am altering the game I am moving X to that spot and then moving X to the next spot so I could make a copy of the board but I think an easy way to deal with this would actually just be to undo it so right afterwards I'm gonna just quickly undo that move the next step would be to write the minimax function that rule II write the algorithm itself I kind of want to know to see if there's any errors here so actually what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna put a placeholder function in minimax which receives a board and then I'm just gonna return the score of 1 so minimax is always going to return the score of 1 meaning it's not gonna be able to pick it's just gonna they're all gonna be a tie so it's good always gonna pick the first one but let's let's see how that goes next turn is not defined because I called it best move and it's in one more place here in setup okay where it went there watch it's gonna go to the next available spot to the next available spot to the next available spot so you can see this is working it's working the sense that the algorithm is making a choice but no matter what it's always just going to go in order of the board and Oh X 1 there's also a big issue here which thankfully didn't no major problems happen but I named this function best move and then it created a variable inside of the function with the same name which you know you're always run into trouble so let me actually just change this to move sort of by definition it is the best move make sure this still works all right X is just picking straight down now the hard part I need to write the minimax function itself so one thing that I skip skipped here which is typical of a minimax algorithm is I would also keep track of the depth because ultimately I could want to consider like how long is it taking me to get somewhere what is the depth of the tree that I'm on so that's something that you'll you'll see often within the algorithm implementation so let me add that so I add an argument depth here and then give it a zero at first oh you know what I need another really important argument this is a turnbased game and the algorithm is going to behave differently whether it is the maximizing player's turn X or the minimizing player's turn o in this case again you could have more than two players or there could be a lot of we stuff going on but that's ultimately what I need here so let me also add is maximizing is maximizing and the this here would be true right so I want to perform minimax on this board with the starting depth of zero and the first move is the maximizing player so let's say I'm maximizing what do I want to do actually what I want to do even before this is check to see if somebody won so I'm pretty sure I already have a check winner function that's something that I wrote in the previous coding challenge let me double check that check winner the winner is null and then by the end it returns a tie it returns null a tie or the winner so the score is and let's let's make a little lookup table that's basically exactly what I wrote here if X wins it's a 0 if a wins is a negative 1 if it's a tie it's a 0 all right so this is my lookup table for what the score then and again it's a very simple scenario there's only three possible scores if the result is not equal to null the score is the associating that the number associated with this particular oh it got rid of those I didn't need those quotes oh Visual Studio code just clean that up for me thank you very much the score is based on whoever won and then I can return that so this would be the terminal condition if I am calling minimax on this particular board configuration at this particular depth and it's an end state if it's a terminal state just return the score that's what I'm supposed to do if it's not a terminal State if it's not this state I can't just return the score I need to check all the possible next moves so I got this wrong actually the next move right I'm actually this is the AI player trying to trying a spot there move so the next move is actually not the maximizing player this should be false but I'll better write this as if it is so if it's the maximizing player I can copypaste that from above check all the spa possible spots again if it's available try you know now that's the human right then oh no this is the AI I'm confused because currently the way I'm stepping through this it's in my mind it's o's turn but i'm writing the code for both whether it's x's turn or o certain so for the sake of argument it's x's turn right now so i'm checking all of those spots and then i'm going to say return no I need to check how you defined I define the best move I'm kind of doing what I did again is there a way for me to reduce the amount of code I'm writing I'm not going to worry about this I want to once again find the best score which will be in this case negative infinity and I want to say the score is the minimax algorithm of the board at depth plus one and now the next players turn is false because I'm the maximizing player and then I'm going to undo this just like I did before why do I have to write this code twice I'll think about later if I can refactor this to only do it once if score is greater than best score best score is equal to score and then after all of this for loop for loop if it's an empty spot boom boom return the best score so this is finding the best score for all the possible next turns by the AI player or if it's not the AI player if it's the minimizing player we could do exactly the same thing and again maybe there's a way and I've I'm missing a curly bracket yes thank you there's a curly bracket so this is very important there's a lot of ifs and fourstate for loops here so maybe there's also a nice way to refactor this make it more readable but if it's the maximising player check all the spots find the best possible outcome and return it but call minimax recursively and the next future move and then here I'm going to start write the minimizing player wants to find the best score for it which is the lowest score so and that's the human player and if the score is less than the best score and then return that best score whew oh forget about this return one I'm gonna stare at this to make sure on my mic my curly brackets line up if if for four and then return the best score otherwise if if for four and return the best score I think this might actually be good should we just try it error on line 33 which will hold on Richard oh this should be ah look at this so this is a huge mistake here return true why did I have that there I don't know why did that that's return score this should be returned score the whole point of this and I don't even need a separate variable here I can just say returns scores result right so this is any kind of recursive function needs a terminal condition needs to exit right this function is always going to keep calling itself and calling itself minimax minimax minimax minimax I don't know what this extra code isn't here and minimax okay oh yes assignment is pointing out something to me which is great which I don't need this if statement to find the best score the whole point of this video and also there's a great chess where you use the min function in the max function because it's the minimax algorithm so I can actually say score is the lower one the minimum between score and best score it's going to make it way easier to read thank you and oh no but this one is Max is Max and then this one oh thank you for this I don't know why I didn't think of this I'm sure it's in every implementation score is the minimum between score and best score so this makes it much more much easier to read here okay let's try it let's try it why not caution to the wind okay excellent and the top left that's definitely the optimal place to go they go here no no bad X bad X you're not going in the right place yeah I be you're still going in order why are you still going in order oh whoa you're not going in order you're making weird decisions oh oh I see the error I see the error of my ways this has to be true right after the maximizing players turn its the minimizing players turn after the minimizing players turn it's the maximizing players turn okay that's a good move X I see what you did there why can't you figure out to go there X oh okay this I'm finding this this is the score is the new score and the best score should be the bigger one the maximum between to score and best score not score ah this has to be this because I'm returning best score and this s Venus okay okay let's see I really should not continue to play this come on X figure out where to go okay I'm gonna go here that's in the wrong place it's in the wrong part I new look like brackets bad brackets I need to return the best score hello after I've checked all of the possibilities meaning both four loops the I and the J have completed I got that right up here but not down here oh okay I really think we've got it this time Tiffany's housed ah tie alright alright you we're gonna go into competition now I'm gonna I'm gonna let you win by going here ah so if I don't go in if I go in a corner yet if I don't go to the middle it's always gonna win so X is always gonna win unless I go to the middle in which case it's always gonna be a tie unless I make a mistake and then it's gonna win but if I go to any other spot X is going to be able to win because it's always gonna so one thing that might be interesting for me to try here really quickly before I sort of finish off this challenge would just be to comment out the AI going first so I know this is technically incorrect cuz X is supposed to go first but let's see what happens if I start with a fresh bolt forward and I go first so I'm gonna go here I'm gonna go here oh it's high am i oh etic something became undefined oh if I go last I guess there's no move for X and I've got it here so that's things like can I beat uh no I lost I don't believe there's any way for me to beat the AI player it's a solved game because it's always gonna go to the center so I could try going here I could go here go here and I'm the best I could do is a tie so you've watched this coding challenge maybe you have a creative idea about how to make your own version of this but I just quickly whipped up thanks to the chat in the live stream also some suggestions of things you could try so first of all what happens if you just make two AI players that just play against each other over and over again well in that case it's gonna be a tie every single time it's a solve game but that might lead to some interesting possibilities um one thing that I'm not using is using the depths in the score so for example if I go back to the code and I change these to say 10 and negative 10 I could account for the depth meaning I could have a higher score if I win more quickly than if it takes longer to win right now I'm not accounting for that so where in the code would you subtract out depth that's something you could try certainly it would be interesting to make a larger board so can you play trick tictactoe in a five by five or a seven by seven you the winning conditions would change the optimal play would change that would be exciting to try I hope somebody does that you could try more players like how would you have a tictactoe game with three players that's something you'd write with a larger board you could try another game let me connect four would work that might be able apply minimax to just thinking about the interface animation like right now how whenever whenever I go the next turn happens immediately you could have you could think about timing and that sort of thing but then I always say high degree of difficulty and maybe worth me coming back to in a future video at some point would be these two last items one is known as alpha beta pruning alpha beta pruning refers to the aspect of the minimax algorithm where you find an optimal path and you know that all the other possibilities are going to be worse and you don't need to go forth and check every possibility so you could research how that works and add it to this algorithm it's explained in the Sebastian lag video then there's a possibility of a game where the number of moves is so vast you couldn't possibly compute the entire tree chess is the classic example of that so you need some heuristic or a way of an estimated guess of what the score could be with any given state so one way of doing this which I'm not saying is a good strategy but a simple thing you could do with chess is you could add up
