00:00 - Hello.
00:00 - My name is Dan
Shiffman and I am here
00:03 - to tell you about
the new Coding Trade
00:05 - website, which
you can find right
00:06 - now at thecodingtrain.com.
00:09 - The website is meant to catalog,
organize all the videos,
00:12 - help you find them,
as well as include
00:14 - all of the metadata
for all the videos.
00:16 - And it has something called
a Passenger Showcase, which
00:19 - is a way for you to submit
projects that you made
00:21 - and have them featured
on the website,
00:23 - along with the
videos themselves.
00:24 - So I've been making videos
for a little over 10 years.
00:27 - At some point, I started
putting them on YouTube,
00:29 - and the channel grew
and found an audience.
00:31 - And then the community
helped build a website
00:34 - for the channel, which
was an alternate way
00:37 - to organize the material
beyond what YouTube offers,
00:40 - which is essentially
video pages and playlists.
00:44 - About a year ago or so--
00:45 - I don't remember the timing--
00:46 - I invited Design
Systems International,
00:49 - which is a design firm that
works with code and computation
00:52 - to develop systems for design
to help imagine, reinvent,
00:55 - and build a new Coding Train
website that helps you navigate
00:59 - through everything.
00:59 - One of my favorite things about
what they did with the website
01:02 - is they used the inspiration
of a train ticket
01:05 - as the design for the website.
01:08 - So I'll read to you
from the case study.
01:10 - Just as a train ticket
uses a horizontal grid
01:13 - to organize travel information,
we built out the page layouts
01:17 - in a horizontal grid format
containing buttons, headings,
01:20 - text, and images.
01:21 - So when you first
arrive on the website,
01:23 - there's a homepage
which is going
01:24 - to show you a preview of
all the different aspects
01:27 - of the website.
01:27 - So there's Coding
Challenges, there's Tracks,
01:29 - there's the passenger
showcase, and there's
01:31 - all sorts of ancillary material,
like an FAQ and guides,
01:35 - for how to contribute
to the website
01:36 - and how to learn to program
and all that kind of stuff.
01:38 - And then, once
you're there, it's
01:40 - a matter of picking choosing
where you want to go.
01:42 - So a Coding
Challenge is a video,
01:44 - where I build a project
from start to finish.
01:46 - It doesn't necessarily require
that you watch other videos.
01:49 - Although, it does require
a basic foundation
01:52 - in programming, and for
those videos on the web page,
01:55 - there are time codes.
01:56 - There's metadata, like
the coding example.
01:58 - So if I built in processing,
you can click and find
02:00 - the processing code.
02:02 - You can find P5GS code, which
will link you right to the web
02:04 - editor, so you can just
run the code right there
02:06 - in the browser.
02:07 - Any things that I
reference in the videos,
02:09 - you'll find links to
those, related videos,
02:12 - other kinds of
challenges, and then
02:13 - the Passenger Showcase, things
that people have made, inspired
02:16 - by, or related to the video
are there on that page as well.
02:20 - So that's the Coding Challenges.
02:21 - There are also the Tracks.
02:23 - The Tracks are
collections of videos.
02:25 - So they're main tracks,
which are essentially
02:26 - sequences of videos.
02:28 - So sometimes, I
have videos that all
02:29 - follow what is something like
a syllabus for a full semester
02:32 - course.
02:33 - There's Nature of Code.
02:34 - There's Beginner's Guide
to Machine Learning.
02:35 - There's Code, just an intro
to programming with P5GS.
02:39 - And then there are
also Sidetracks,
02:41 - and the Sidetracks
are collections
02:43 - of videos that are
maybe linked by a theme,
02:45 - so less about watching
them in order.
02:46 - But I've made videos for Pi Day.
02:48 - So anything that has to do
with maybe polar coordinates
02:51 - or trigonometry,
the number pi might
02:53 - be in a sidetrack of videos.
02:55 - I have a sidetrack called
Algorithmic Botany,
02:57 - so it's any videos that
have to do with algorithms
03:00 - to generate plant-like
or tree-like structures.
03:03 - For those, when you
go to the Track page,
03:04 - you'll find all of the
videos listed in order.
03:08 - And you can click
around them and then
03:09 - find the individual
video pages as well,
03:11 - which have all the same
material as the Challenge page.
03:14 - There's also an FAQ, so
those kinds of frequently
03:16 - asked questions that I'm
always getting over email
03:19 - or on YouTube comments.
03:20 - So how do I get started,
or how do I find the code,
03:22 - or how do I suggest a topic?
03:24 - Those questions are
all there on the FAQ.
03:26 - Maybe you have some questions
that aren't on the FAQ.
03:28 - Please, send them to me.
03:29 - Ask them.
03:30 - And then there are the guides.
03:31 - So there's a guide for
how do you get started?
03:34 - If you're totally
new to programming
03:35 - and have never done
anything before,
03:37 - that guide will walk
you through where
03:40 - are the videos that
you can start with,
03:42 - and how do you
approach beginning?
03:43 - There's also the How to Maintain
the Website guide, which
03:46 - is not for the faint of heart.
03:47 - It's a bit more
technical there's
03:50 - a lot of different aspects
to how the website is
03:53 - designed, built, and generated.
03:55 - But if you're
interested in that,
03:56 - and you want to help contribute
to improve the website
03:59 - or have new ideas, that
guide will really help you.
04:01 - And then there's the
Passenger Showcase guide,
04:03 - and this is really the most
important part of the website,
04:06 - in my view.
04:06 - It's really one
of the reasons why
04:08 - I wanted to create a new
website to have a way
04:10 - to feature the hundreds and
maybe thousands of projects
04:14 - that people have made over the
years from watching the videos.
04:17 - So every video page has the
Passenger Showcase on it.
04:20 - There's an entire
Passenger Showcase
04:21 - page, which shows everything
that's ever been submitted.
04:24 - You can also search by
passenger or author--
04:26 - I don't know what the
term to use is here--
04:28 - and you should submit.
04:30 - So the guide will
show you how you
04:31 - can enter all the information to
a form to submit your project.
04:35 - You can also make
a pull request,
04:36 - which might be something that
sounds a little scary to you.
04:38 - Maybe, it's something that
you haven't done before,
04:40 - but the Coding Train
community will welcome you
04:42 - with open arms.
04:43 - So please, if you've
never made a pull request
04:46 - or used GitHub
before, this could
04:47 - be a place for you to try.
04:49 - And don't worry, you
can't break anything.
04:50 - You can't do it wrong.
04:51 - We are here to help you do that.
04:53 - There's also the About page,
which I would really encourage
04:56 - you to take a look at.
04:57 - So many people over the years
have helped me with the Coding
05:00 - Train, have made the
coding trade happen
05:02 - in all sorts of ways that maybe
you don't even know about.
05:05 - I'll try to include everybody
linked in the video description
05:09 - here who has helped make
the Coding Train happen.
05:11 - All right, everyone.
05:12 - I've been to wrap this up.
05:13 - I'm going to take us out
with this train whistle that
05:16 - is laser etched with some of
my favorite coding projects.
05:19 - We've got the 10 print
design here, a random walk.
05:23 - This looks like marching
squares of Perlin noise and then
05:25 - the Snake Game.
05:26 - Let's see what kind of
sound this thing makes.
05:29 - Here we go.
05:29 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]
05:31 - Look at that.
05:32 - It's actually pretty darn good.
05:33 - [MUSIC PLAYING]
