00:02 - hello good afternoon welcome to a
00:05 - special surprise sort of episode of the
00:09 - coding train I happened to be here at
00:12 - NYU for a couple meetings today
00:14 - oops I'm looking over here and so I
00:17 - thought I would pop up here to the
00:19 - studio and do a quick little experiment
00:22 - I've been as some of you might been
00:25 - following my channel I had a bicycle
00:27 - accident and I have a bunch of different
00:29 - broken body parts most seriously here
00:32 - this elbow this is actually now a splint
00:34 - which is different than I was wearing in
00:35 - the last video that I made and this
00:38 - actually comes off and I've started
00:39 - physical therapy but I've got another
00:40 - few weeks to be wearing these things it
00:43 - looks like I could maybe type but it's
00:44 - pretty uncomfortable and not the best
00:46 - thing for my body so I'm still holding
00:49 - off on doing typing I'm hearing an echo
00:51 - because I have a monitor I would love to
00:55 - know if the sound is okay I'm just gonna
00:59 - turn off this okay so that should get
01:02 - rid of the echo so I have something that
01:06 - I've installed on my computer here and
01:08 - I'm gonna do a quick experiment here
01:10 - wake up hello coding trained viewers how
01:18 - are you today
01:21 - it didn't work
01:22 - oh I'm in the wrong application try this
01:27 - again hello coding trained viewers oh
01:33 - shoot this was working so well this
01:37 - worked a minute ago let me try to open
01:39 - up TextEdit and
01:52 - hello Kotick trained viewers correct
01:57 - Kody's coding trained correct
02:04 - reviewers viewers exclamation mark
02:14 - [Music]
02:16 - so this I've been using a bunch of
02:20 - different dictation software I'm just
02:21 - gonna leave this on to be amused by how
02:23 - its following what I'm saying and
02:27 - getting lots of things wrong Mac OS has
02:32 - built-in dictation the software that
02:34 - I've installed here is actually called
02:36 - dragon speaks naturally and there is the
02:39 - sound might be a little bit loud okay
02:41 - this is a different microphone setup and
02:44 - I'm gonna oh yeah it's way up way up and
02:46 - turn the mic down okay is that better
02:50 - okay so high for Cody's viewers okay
02:53 - so what was I going to say I watched
02:59 - this YouTube video the other day I'm
03:01 - gonna try to pull it up here let me see
03:03 - open Chrome Google coding by voice
03:13 - Python Python correct pika I gotta get
03:25 - you this let me oops oh my goodness it's
03:29 - opening up eclipse there's a ghost in
03:31 - the machine you should open up a guy I'd
03:33 - still go to sleep oh and now is it too
03:43 - quiet
03:43 - no I see the levels are fine so scratch
03:48 - that
03:52 - by the way if you haven't watched my
03:54 - channel before it this is what I do it
03:56 - would have made sense for me to like set
03:58 - this up practice it and figure out an
04:00 - actual way to get it to work instead I
04:02 - just installed it and thought to come up
04:03 - here turn on a light public stream which
04:05 - apparently has some number of people
04:07 - watching right now like 500 to 26 while
04:10 - I'm fumbling my way through this okay
04:24 - go to sleep okay so you can see when I
04:28 - say go to sleep I can't do my typical
04:31 - actually maybe I can this right here
04:35 - wake up go to sleep so I need to
04:41 - remember to do that and to wake it up
04:42 - when I want to actually dictate wake up
04:53 - coding by voice YouTube's correct code E
05:01 - coding go to sleep oh yeah so this is a
05:13 - YouTube video that I will pull up so I
05:21 - recommend anybody watching if you're
05:24 - interested to watch this video
05:26 - Tavis Rudd is a developer who mostly
05:31 - programs in Python who had a rock
05:33 - climbing injury he tells the story in
05:36 - this video and set up a very elaborate
05:38 - system to do everything with dictation
05:41 - and in fact he continues to use this
05:43 - system today even though he's mostly I
05:45 - believe recovered and Ken type but he
05:48 - still does everything by voice now he
05:50 - used an open source API that I forget
05:53 - what it's called but it's in this video
05:55 - that works with dragon speaks he uses
05:58 - Emacs and vim which are specialized text
06:02 - editors that you can use in a terminal
06:05 - window so I haven't done any of this but
06:09 - I I'm curious you know fit but you know
06:12 - this may take a while to setup and I
06:13 - would love any help with this if
06:15 - anybody's interested okay could raise
06:22 - the volume a little bit sorry I'm gonna
06:23 - just turn the volume up a little bit now
06:26 - on my mic got distracted by the chat in
06:29 - that message let's see how that is it's
06:31 - a little bit up now okay so I watched
06:35 - this video I've been looking into
06:37 - kind of interested in trying to do a
06:38 - similar setup just as an experiment so I
06:41 - thought I would try to do today very
06:44 - briefly see how far I could get with
06:49 - just what's in Dragon speaks by itself
06:53 - without any additional settings or
06:55 - macros or interfacing with an API and
06:59 - the processing development environment
07:01 - ultimately I might like to try to set up
07:04 - to work with like atom text editor maybe
07:06 - atom live preview something like that
07:09 - clearly these systems I've been using it
07:11 - to send emails they it works remarkably
07:13 - well to dictate written English so
07:18 - something that I might write in an email
07:19 - or a word processing document even
07:23 - filling out a form in a webpage the
07:25 - dictation works quite well it also has
07:27 - some commands to operate the computer
07:29 - that I haven't really learned yet so we
07:30 - need to learn those but it is absolutely
07:34 - not set up in any way to do coding so
07:37 - some of the things that I imagine I'm
07:38 - gonna meet to you do like curly braces
07:40 - and variable names with camelcase or
07:43 - underscores it's not going to do any of
07:45 - that in an elegant way natively so I
07:47 - thought I would try to see what it could
07:48 - do what all the pitfalls are and maybe
07:52 - make a mental list or maybe some of you
07:54 - are watching could kind of take notes
07:55 - and send me a list of what are all the
07:56 - features that I might need and most of
07:58 - these features have been solved and
08:00 - implemented by Tavis run if you watch
08:02 - this video does this like almost wild
08:04 - performance of this strange language
08:05 - that he's invented to talk to his
08:07 - computer and but I'm kind of and maybe I
08:11 - could piggyback off of that system in
08:12 - some ways but I thought I would kind of
08:14 - start over a little bit from scratch
08:15 - here okay so I'm looking at this let me
08:19 - just come over some people are asking in
08:20 - the chat I'm gonna walk over here to the
08:22 - whiteboard just to explain here what's
08:24 - going on so first of all I have pretty
08:26 - good my shoulders are perfectly healthy
08:28 - and I can move around I have a what's it
08:31 - called scaphoid is that that's not the
08:32 - right word a very small fracture in this
08:36 - wrist from a bicycle accident it will
08:40 - hopefully heal on its own and in about a
08:43 - few weeks this will come off and I will
08:45 - do some physical therapy but hopefully
08:47 - this will just pretty much be fine
08:49 - good as new so to speak within the next
08:51 - few weeks the more serious injury is
08:54 - here this elbow I learned all the names
08:58 - of the bones and the different things
08:59 - but googling I've got can't come up with
09:02 - any of them on the fly right now but the
09:03 - elbow bone broke really split off right
09:07 - in half detached itself this way
09:10 - so this tricep muscle wasn't not
09:13 - attached to anything and so it's been
09:15 - repaired with surgery I have some
09:17 - artificial bone I have a metal plate I
09:19 - have a couple screws and this is
09:21 - actually a splint for protection to hold
09:23 - it in place but this actually comes off
09:25 - and I do physical therapy three or four
09:27 - times a day and what I thought I'd try
09:29 - to program was a simulation of the range
09:30 - of motion that I have so currently if I
09:32 - use this arm you know I can extend it
09:35 - all the way I actually can hyper extend
09:36 - it but this would be zero degrees this
09:38 - is maybe about 160 degrees something in
09:40 - radians my range of motion if I were to
09:42 - take this off and try to do the physical
09:43 - therapy now which I quote is currently
09:46 - about sorry it's about 15 degrees I can
09:52 - get to about here 15 degrees and then I
09:55 - can't this is much harder so I can get
09:56 - to about 125 degrees and so I'm hoping
09:59 - to get all the way back to 0-3 around
10:01 - 160 and this will take quite a bit of
10:04 - time the physical therapy so that's my
10:07 - current status I have taken let me say
10:09 - another couple things I basically taking
10:11 - this month July off I did one live
10:14 - stream from my apartment just to say hi
10:16 - to the channel and I'm doing this today
10:17 - maybe for another half an hour or so but
10:19 - I'm pausing for those of you who are
10:21 - supporting me on patreon that's
10:22 - patreon.com slash coding train I'm going
10:25 - to put it on pause so none of your
10:28 - donations will be taken for this month
10:30 - of course if you would like to anyway
10:32 - you're welcome to make a contribution
10:34 - the best way to do that is through
10:36 - nature of code comm which is I have an
10:38 - online system for purchasing a book but
10:39 - what I would suggest in lieu of the
10:41 - patreon contributions this month if
10:43 - you're looking to support something to
10:45 - make a donation to processing foundation
10:47 - org so you can check that out I also as
10:49 - an experiment enabled that YouTube super
10:52 - chat which I'll probably just turn off
10:53 - but since I'm experimented with so many
10:56 - different things today I thought I would
10:57 - see how that works
10:58 - I kind of have mixed feelings about the
11:00 - whole super chat system I don't
11:01 - I don't particularly like the idea of
11:04 - paid chat messages and I want to go on a
11:08 - long discussion of that but I thought I
11:09 - would turn it on and see and then I'll
11:11 - probably turn it off again because the
11:13 - crowdfunding that I'm using mostly for
11:15 - this channel is oh actually exclusively
11:16 - is through patreon service okay
11:19 - that aside Kody in the chat whoops
11:25 - Kody in the chat asks does anybody know
11:28 - how long Dan won't be able to type I'm
11:33 - hopeful my you know as much as I love
11:36 - doing this YouTube channel and it is it
11:38 - brings me so much happiness to be able
11:41 - to be here and do this my alt my my main
11:44 - goal is to be able to be back and typing
11:47 - by the fall semester which is early
11:49 - September
11:51 - III think I need at least a few more
11:53 - weeks of rest healing and physical
11:55 - therapy before I'm gonna have more
11:58 - significant use of these arms you know I
12:01 - can kind of do some one finger typing
12:03 - I've been doing dictation for emails but
12:05 - we'll see it'll be a while before I'm
12:06 - you know sitting for I certainly don't
12:08 - think that I can sit for hours at a
12:10 - stretch typing you know it's probably
12:13 - not the best thing in terms of you know
12:15 - the kind of exercises in use of the arm
12:17 - that I should be rebuilding okay so I
12:19 - don't actually know the answer to that
12:20 - but I will be happy to provide updates
12:22 - I'm gonna be out of town next week
12:24 - having a nice little break and vacation
12:26 - and then I'll be back in town and having
12:29 - more physical therapy and doctor's
12:30 - appointments so we'll see if anybody
12:32 - wants to see my x-rays you can follow me
12:34 - at shipment on Twitter I posted them if
12:36 - you want to join my patreon I posted
12:38 - some more pictures of the scar and
12:41 - swelling that you probably don't want to
12:43 - see but if about this now okay scratch
12:47 - that going sleep I should be nice to
12:52 - dragon so then go to sleep sounds very
12:54 - like command like I need to like rework
12:56 - I like to be very polite good thoughtful
12:59 - what apologize a lot I need to work on
13:00 - that with my dictation stuff okay
13:04 - somebody posted voice code dot IO I'm
13:07 - not active on Instagram now okay so what
13:12 - time is it now first I have another
13:13 - thing
13:15 - shoot okay wait
13:19 - somebody created a new song it's on
13:25 - soundcloud it was based on the
13:30 - minesweeper it was a play on it's
13:34 - flood-fill time I just forgot how it was
13:37 - it's in a youtube comment maybe I can
13:40 - find it sound cloud somebody can find it
13:48 - for me and then give me the URL in slack
13:52 - that would be great
13:55 - I'm gonna look for it in YouTube
13:57 - comments cuz I think I have a way of
13:59 - doing that here so I can play this song
14:04 - I'm going on this computer
14:05 - Oh somebody found it already thank you
14:08 - alright cuz I had shared it so i ke - b
14:13 - is h o P I am typing right now just
14:17 - using one finger on each hand so it's
14:20 - very slow and let's see it's let's
14:25 - whoops let's play this one oh you can't
14:32 - hear it I have to change some settings
14:34 - here sound loop back no multi output
14:43 - device I think I need to do that
14:57 - maybe you can hear it but it's very
14:58 - quiet
15:15 - yeah I know I have to change the
15:17 - settings you can listen to this on your
15:19 - own time it's very quiet well maybe I'll
15:24 - come back to it later okay so let's see
15:26 - how this goes now but thank you like
15:32 - bishop I love these remixes and I should
15:35 - let you know that there's a new theme
15:39 - song coming a music video I shot all
15:42 - that with some collaborators which I'll
15:45 - post about before I had this
15:46 - so I fully used to my arm then okay so
15:50 - let's see here so I'm now in processing
15:59 - so let's see if I can get some stuff
16:01 - happening here people in the chat are
16:06 - asking why so much off-topic discussion
16:09 - I don't know if you're asking me that
16:10 - question
16:11 - or asking the chat question but
16:14 - unfortunately those of you who are here
16:16 - to hope that my neural network series is
16:18 - continuing and hope that I'm gonna do a
16:20 - lot of coding I apologize I'm sincerely
16:23 - sorry you're just gonna have to wait on
16:25 - that I probably won't be back I
16:27 - definitely won't be back until August
16:28 - with any of that content and it could be
16:30 - a little bit later depending on how
16:31 - things go I've decided that this month
16:34 - July is just a kind of month hiatus but
16:36 - I thought since I was here I would try
16:38 - to turn this on and and say hi and do a
16:40 - little bit of stuff so so here we go
16:46 - let's see wake up void setup oh I'm in
16:56 - the wrong void setup I'm getting okay
17:02 - hold on why is this happening let me
17:05 - relaunch processing it was typing and it
17:08 - was I was I did actually test and it was
17:11 - dictating into processing earlier and
17:16 - not sure why it doesn't want to do that
17:18 - now using the mouse is definitely the
17:23 - hardest thing the trackpad that is
17:38 - Kancil correction go to sleep I know it
17:44 - happened I was in the correction mode oh
17:48 - I turned off my mic
18:14 - you
18:29 - you
18:52 - okay now I'm back okay okay okay I'm
18:58 - back
18:59 - did you guys hear me answer the question
19:02 - about why so many off-topic discussions
19:06 - was the mic just making noise oh boy all
19:12 - right
19:12 - I don't know what I had the mic I'm all
19:15 - messed up what a disaster okay
19:22 - [Music]
19:28 - did I talk about the music video that's
19:31 - coming that I talk did you hear me talk
19:33 - about that I'm not doing the neural
19:35 - network stuff for a while because of
19:37 - this etc I can't yeah okay and I'm
19:41 - getting some very good advice which is
19:43 - don't necessarily rely on the YouTube
19:46 - chat for sound feedback as i okay so I
19:50 - don't know why I'm not able to get the
19:55 - dictation to work in processing let me
19:57 - see
19:58 - wake up void setup okay so maybe I need
20:06 - to question mark
20:16 - okay also only certain applications are
20:22 - supported what does it mean you can
20:27 - dictate into an unsupported application
20:29 - if you want to dictate into an
20:30 - application that's not on the supported
20:31 - list but try not to use your keyboard or
20:34 - mouse I see that's going to be a problem
20:39 - because I'm definitely gonna whoops all
20:46 - right let's don't it
20:51 - all right let's figure this out maybe if
20:59 - I relaunch it
21:05 - so you guys just have to bear with me
21:07 - here for a second oh so sad oh there we
21:14 - go
21:18 - scratch that
21:23 - scratch that correct Seth area correct
21:31 - Seth as soon as I clicked my mouth my
21:38 - mouse it stopped allowing me to dictate
21:41 - oh that's so sad well here's problem
21:45 - number one open processing open Adam
21:57 - open Adam
22:09 - let's try this well this is going to be
22:12 - a failure
22:14 - correct be a failure
22:16 - be a success exclamation mark new line
22:24 - scratch that
22:33 - all right now now the thing is I'm a
22:39 - little bit concerned that if I new line
22:44 - if I start to use the mouse to delete
22:49 - something let's try that I'm going to do
22:51 - command a go to sleep wake up test one
23:00 - two three okay
23:02 - so already I'm having better success
23:04 - with Adam okay I have an idea
23:09 - go to sleep wake up open terminal C D
23:25 - slash tilde slash users oh no no I don't
23:39 - need that desktop PWD new line PWD new
23:52 - line p WD new line you're lying
24:04 - [Music]
24:09 - go to sleep okay so I the reason why I
24:14 - wanted to attempt this experiment with
24:16 - processing is that it was it's an
24:18 - all-in-one environment and I wasn't
24:20 - going to have to switch between the
24:22 - browser and the text editor but let's
24:24 - try doing this in Chrome let's start
24:27 - doing this okay so I want to go open
24:31 - Chrome Oh wake up wake up go to open
24:38 - Chrome open Chrome go to sleep do I have
24:49 - to be in the finder how do i how do I
24:52 - get to the Dragon commands if I'm not if
25:00 - I don't want to be dictating it to
25:01 - terminal open Chrome wake up open Chrome
25:21 - how many viewers have I lost now there's
25:23 - probably nobody watching anymore okay
25:28 - correct flagrantly oh my god fascinating
25:34 - this is fascinating to see how the
25:38 - software works and what kind of it's not
25:40 - free software and this is a dragon
25:42 - naturally speaking trollese go to sleep
25:46 - go to sleep
25:54 - okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm going
25:56 - to open up Chrome
25:58 - and I'm going to go to p5.js org
26:02 - and we go to download and I'm gonna
26:05 - download p5.js complete and gonna go
26:10 - find this I'm gonna open this up and I'm
26:15 - gonna get empty example and I'm going to
26:19 - put it on the desktop then I'm gonna go
26:24 - to Adam and I'm gonna say open desktop
26:33 - empty example and sketch touch yes
26:40 - okay this is good I'm gonna delete
26:42 - everything now I'm gonna go back to
26:46 - terminal
26:47 - oh I'm standing in front of this wake up
26:58 - Python space - M - M
27:16 - simple is it case sensitive let's see
27:24 - yeah go to sleep so already I need some
27:34 - sort of so if anyone's making a list for
27:39 - me to keep track of things that I need
27:41 - to investigate if I'm actually going to
27:43 - do this two things is one
27:45 - why doesn't processing work with dragon
27:48 - and insider' a way that I can get it to
27:50 - two is what is a way for me to write
27:54 - some sort of macro command
27:56 - I need I could just say start server to
28:00 - drag in and it's going to automatically
28:01 - launch the server and then I need to be
28:09 - able to figure out a way if I'm in atom
28:12 - two with a command my goal here would be
28:17 - as a experiment as an academic
28:18 - experiment here you know I'm I have some
28:22 - use of my hands but what would it what
28:24 - would it mean to code without any use of
28:26 - hands whatsoever I need to do everything
28:28 - completely for voice how would I get
28:32 - from Adam to Chrome Oh voice code dot IO
28:38 - Simon in the chat is suggesting how
28:41 - interesting I will have to take a look
28:43 - at that I will take a look at that I
28:45 - mean I'm not going to purchase it right
28:48 - now voice code dot IO advanced voice
28:56 - control platform interesting okay I'm
29:00 - going to take a look at this later so
29:03 - that's interesting
29:07 - so if I go now to localhost oops I did
29:12 - it on the desktop that's fine desktop
29:15 - empty example and if I open up the
29:27 - console okay
29:30 - so now if I go back to Adam I definitely
29:35 - need a way of triggering command s so
29:43 - how do i with dragon switch to finder I
29:48 - don't know so switch to Chrome instead
29:51 - of open Chrome let's try that wake up
29:54 - switch to Chrome go to sleep so that
30:01 - didn't seem to work so if anyone wants
30:04 - to look at the Dragon documentation and
30:06 - help me out here give me some tips
30:08 - switch between Windows with naturally
30:10 - speaking you can say switch to to change
30:13 - the window I'm getting that message in
30:17 - the chat okay we are here to waste time
30:24 - with this useless voice app yes so if
30:27 - you're not interested in that
30:28 - thanks for watching I switched to Google
30:31 - Chrome okay wake up
30:33 - switch to Google Chrome hmm that didn't
30:41 - seem to work either
30:42 - scratch that go to sleep
30:50 - all right okay here let's give this a
30:58 - try okay
30:58 - wake up function setup correct so setup
31:09 - choose to open paren close paren curly
31:19 - brace scratch that open curly bracket
31:26 - new line new line create canvas correct
31:36 - create campus create canvas create
31:44 - canvas create canvas scratch that
31:51 - scratch that scratch that create canvas
32:04 - hmm
32:05 - so good sleep okay so here's item number
32:09 - two I need say start Google Chrome I'll
32:13 - try that so I need to come up with a way
32:19 - of stringing words together without
32:23 - spaces and using camel case and I know
32:26 - again with the video that I referenced
32:28 - the tavis rudd video this is all
32:30 - something that he worked out for coding
32:32 - in Python right now I'm just making a
32:33 - mental list of things so I need to be
32:35 - able to say create canvas and I probably
32:38 - could also just create I could probably
32:40 - pull the p5 API and like put that in as
32:44 - a bunch of like add that to a dictionary
32:46 - I can probably work through instance
32:47 - from sort of training yeah so there's
32:49 - probably way too fine I'm getting this
32:54 - I'm getting this this folio a way to
32:56 - define a dictionary so switch to next
33:02 - window list
33:03 - all windows okay wake up list all
33:08 - windows list all windows scratch that
33:15 - scratch that go to sleep so that didn't
33:20 - seem to work either yeah
33:22 - scratch that scratch that the scratch
33:24 - that song never forget the scratch
33:27 - that's mmm wake up open parentheses 6:40
33:36 - comma 480 go to end correct 4480 correct
33:49 - 4480 go to end go to sleep so how do I
34:01 - move the cursor around I mean I can
34:03 - obviously do that with the arrow keys so
34:07 - that's another if anyone's keeping a
34:08 - track of this list how I move the cursor
34:10 - around is something that I need to be
34:13 - able to do wake up semicolon go to end
34:25 - go to sleep so go to end is something
34:29 - that I was using when dictating emails
34:30 - and other things were it would
34:32 - immediately move the cursor to the end
34:33 - but that didn't seem to work okay here
34:38 - wake up function background open paren
34:44 - close paren open curly braket new line
34:51 - correct background draw go to sleep so
34:59 - weirdly I've noticed this is another bug
35:01 - that seems to be in dragon when I tell
35:03 - it to correct something it kind of
35:04 - selects the wrong area it you notice how
35:07 - it's selected it missed the B and it
35:09 - selected the parenthesis so I don't know
35:12 - if that's just because Adam is not
35:14 - technically supported so it wasn't able
35:17 - to select
35:17 - the right thing okay
35:20 - wake up background open paren 51
35:34 - semicolon newline fill open friend
35:43 - correct fill whoa okay so it lost
35:49 - correct fill choose to open paren 255
36:04 - semicolon newline ellipse
36:13 - scratch that rect mode all right so a
36:25 - whoa go to sleep so another thing is to
36:34 - again this built-in dictionary if we're
36:37 - camel casing because what if I want to
36:39 - create like write a function or declare
36:41 - a variable that doesn't exist but then
36:44 - also have a built-in list of words those
36:46 - are two of the things I need wake up all
36:54 - caps Center go to sleep that work pretty
37:00 - well I know it's not going to understand
37:03 - this wake up open paren Mouse X correct
37:14 - now Mouse comma Mouse Y comma 16 comma
37:26 - 16
37:32 - so again I have the same scratch that go
37:39 - to sleep go to sleep go to sleep go to
37:44 - sleep I know that's the children's song
37:46 - it's I listened to that have with my
37:50 - kids Elizabeth Mitchell sings it go to
37:53 - sleep go to sleep go to sleep my
37:56 - something I can't remember the words
38:01 - close curly bracket
38:06 - wake up close curly bracket go to sleep
38:16 - now there must be a way that I can do
38:19 - command s there go to sleep my there
38:25 - must be a way don't correct the word you
38:31 - said there must be a way for me to say
38:37 - command s right for save now I can
38:40 - actually just type this in and it will
38:42 - auto format
38:43 - I have Adam configure to auto format the
38:45 - code which is nice like all that white
38:47 - space errors I don't really care about
38:49 - but there should be a way for me to say
38:50 - command s then I should be able to say
38:53 - switch what if I go here to commands
38:57 - help
39:03 - help oh I'm in the correction window
39:07 - correction window okay
39:11 - so these are all the well it's like
39:15 - Safari okay so I'm gonna have to look
39:18 - wake up global applications I'm sorry
39:24 - that the font there's no way you guys
39:25 - can read this activate it looks like the
39:28 - word is activate activate Adam or wake
39:32 - up
39:33 - activate Adam activate Chrome activate
39:38 - Adam activate Chrome activate Adam
39:43 - activate Chrome's quick photos thank you
39:55 - scratch that go to sleep I wanted to
40:02 - talk to me why I want to talk to me I'm
40:04 - talking to it I'm being as nice as I can
40:07 - alright that's good now how do I do
40:10 - command s commands a global menu
40:19 - navigation click click file menu but
40:24 - there's got a way to click save choose
40:27 - file close window copy selection go to
40:31 - beginning go to end save would be under
40:36 - s save this document okay
40:43 - wake up new line your line
40:52 - safest document Oh go sleep it did it
41:00 - wake up
41:02 - activate Chrome refresh this page that
41:12 - was a fantasy that that would work go to
41:17 - sleep I have a feeling that it's gonna
41:19 - be happier with me using Safari just
41:21 - based on the fact that I saw so far II
41:23 - show up but I don't know that I could
41:24 - bring myself to do that okay so I can
41:30 - hit refresh hey move mouse I can move
41:41 - the mouse with my one finger Oh dragon
41:42 - quit unexpectedly reopen so that's my
41:53 - quota challenge for today through
41:55 - dictation I was able to use p5.js to
42:00 - create a simple program of moving the
42:02 - mouse around now I wanted to try to
42:04 - simulate my range of motion so I'm
42:12 - seeing um so what time is it - 15 I've
42:17 - got to go
42:18 - by 2:30 because I have some meetings so
42:22 - let's see if I can get a little further
42:23 - and maybe answer some questions I don't
42:26 - know what else I could do no coming back
42:27 - another time
42:30 - okay so let's see here let me think
42:33 - about this
42:34 - so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
42:35 - draw a line that is you know what I
42:39 - should do when I'm doing my physical
42:41 - therapy is I should monitor my physical
42:43 - therapy with a Kinect and actually
42:45 - measure the angle so that's something
42:46 - I'll do eventually that's a good idea
42:48 - right cuz the Kinect should be able to
42:50 - determine the angle for the range of
42:52 - motion that I'm getting here I have to
42:54 - work on that once I get up and once they
42:56 - get up and running with this whole
42:58 - programming education thing
43:03 - [Music]
43:05 - okay so let's see here so let me delete
43:11 - this wake up Oh
43:15 - microphones off stroke open paren 2255
43:23 - correct 25 to 55 go to end end of line
43:30 - Oh choose 1 go to end so this has to be
43:44 - low go to sleep
43:47 - this has to be lower case wake up
43:54 - new line line open paren 360 comma 240
44:10 - comma 400 comma 240 new line
44:21 - float a equals correct floats choose
44:29 - three correct equals equals equals
44:37 - symbol scratch that equal sign go to
44:50 - sleep
44:50 - say I've learned that equal sign is what
44:53 - I have to say for equals which I should
44:55 - probably alter the settings so that I
44:57 - just have to say equals that's another
44:59 - thing so altering some of these settings
45:01 - oh I mean I've been job that's correct
45:04 - I forgot oh they care camera still goes
45:06 - off camera on look at that neck
45:11 - dictation suddenly worked with that
45:12 - camera amazing wake up
45:16 - correct floats select floats
45:23 - go to sleep yeah so this is it being off
45:27 - so I've seen this behavior this seems
45:29 - like a bug to me I don't think I'm doing
45:31 - anything wrong notice that it selected
45:33 - the correct number of characters but in
45:34 - the wrong place it should select this
45:36 - float so why is it not working I don't
45:40 - know wake up bar
45:54 - scratch that shoot go to sleep so the
46:04 - other thing is I'm often in that correct
46:06 - mode how do I cancel that correct mode
46:11 - let's try this again wake up var a equal
46:19 - sign map choose to open paren Mouse X
46:35 - comma 0 comma width correct 0 choose to
46:48 - correct width
46:51 - choose 2 comma 15 comma 125 correct now
47:10 - thanks Mouse X so I have to figure out a
47:18 - way scratch that
47:20 - go to sleep so I have to figure out a
47:25 - way to there's probably way I could
47:26 - spell that out if in a custom way but
47:29 - again that's the sort of dictionary
47:30 - thing I mean I I said var hey witch why
47:32 - not keep that but I meant this to be a
47:34 - so what I'm doing here is I'm trying to
47:36 - map the mouse position to a range of
47:40 - angles which is currently yesterday my
47:43 - physical therapy this is the range of
47:45 - motion that was measured so I was able
47:46 - to get to about 15 degrees to about 125
47:51 - degrees that's I'm not actually it's
47:53 - more like this probably and I you know I
47:55 - want to get to 0 and I want to get to
47:57 - about you know probably 160 okay so now
48:05 - [Music]
48:12 - so one thing I want to do now that I'm
48:14 - gonna use rotation I don't want I want
48:16 - to draw this line relative to 0-0 I
48:19 - think that'll be nicer so I'm gonna say
48:24 - I'm gonna add and wake up translate open
48:29 - paren with / - comma height / - close
48:32 - paren semicolon go to sleep all right so
48:40 - that's interesting I got with / - they
48:44 - probably should have said with / - maybe
48:46 - that would have worked wake up correct
48:51 - with / - with / - correct with choose to
49:03 - correct tightened by my - height / - go
49:13 - to sleep okay so I'm learning getting
49:17 - closer
49:18 - oops you lazy the dictate so I'm gonna
49:21 - change the line to go from like negative
49:23 - 100 to zero - zero zero and then now
49:37 - wake up line open paren zero comma zero
49:42 - 100 comma zero
49:47 - scratch that zero comma zero comma 100
49:54 - comma zero correct choose - it actually
50:01 - gave me the full option of what I wanted
50:04 - scratch that
50:08 - zero comma zero comma 100 comma zero
50:14 - correct that choose to correct why
50:26 - scratch that scratch that
50:30 - put that back go to sleep oh my god this
50:38 - is not working at all I just curious
50:43 - there's got its got to be like less than
50:45 - 200 people watching at this point with
50:50 - you go outside smell the flowers give
50:56 - somebody a hug appreciate things besides
50:59 - me here okay alright alright
51:04 - oh yeah let me let me get back to things
51:05 - all right let me wake up whine
51:12 - open-paren
51:15 - zero comma zero 100 comma zero choose
51:20 - two
51:26 - save this document activate Chrome
51:34 - activate Google Chrome localhost go to
51:47 - sleep so I need some way of immediately
51:53 - going to localhost and navigating
51:54 - somehow to the web application that I
51:57 - want to look at again if I was just
51:59 - doing this in processing I'll just need
52:00 - to say run run stop or play stop that
52:04 - kind of thing but since I couldn't get
52:07 - that to work here we are uncaught syntax
52:13 - error sketch das line 12 wake up
52:17 - activate atom
52:26 - I know sleep I need a comma here wake up
52:34 - wake up comma save this document
52:41 - activate Chrome refresh that didn't work
52:49 - so I don't know how to refresh with a
52:51 - command ok there is there is the line ok
52:57 - we're doing well now rotate open paren a
53:07 - closed paren semicolon correct a go to
53:17 - sleep so that needs to be a lowercase a
53:20 - just probably wait for me to say that
53:22 - and this should be the word rotate so
53:25 - obviously I'm still doing way too much
53:26 - with one hand here and I'm kind of
53:30 - running out of time here but let's see
53:33 - how this open let's see how this goes
53:38 - and by the way you might be wondering
53:41 - why am I looking this way whenever I
53:43 - start talking it's because I have a
53:44 - monitor over here that has exactly what
53:48 - you see it's it's so that I can do this
53:50 - and I can say I'm pointing to line I'm
53:51 - pointing to rotate a pointing to VAR a
53:53 - but for some reason I I really what I
53:55 - need is a monitor up there so that I can
53:57 - look more like I'm talking to you but
54:00 - for some reason I have this habit of
54:01 - just looking at the screen over here
54:02 - which is a little bit weird okay let's
54:07 - see and wake up save this document and
54:17 - activate Chrome Oh didn't wake up wake
54:24 - up save this document activate Chrome
54:36 - go to sleep so whatever my refresh
54:39 - command would be mmm so so my angle is
54:44 - wrong right so I actually don't want
54:47 - this is this is not what my harm does I
54:49 - want it to go from so this is the thing
54:52 - I always forget in a computer graphics
54:55 - system pointing down is positive
54:58 - pointing up is negative and rotation
55:01 - right this is rotating 15 degrees so I
55:07 - actually want to be between negative 15
55:09 - degrees and negative a negative 1/25
55:14 - wake up activate atom go to sleep so in
55:22 - the interest of time this by the way
55:26 - should say so this should be between
55:30 - negative 125 and negative 15 and guess
55:35 - what
55:36 - also what are these measurements in
55:39 - these measurements are in degrees
55:41 - natively most computer programs graphics
55:44 - programs will think of angles in terms
55:46 - of radians so I actually need to add
55:48 - something else
55:49 - wake up a new line angle mode didn't
55:56 - even wake it up wake up you little
55:59 - sleepyhead wake up new line angle mode
56:07 - open paren caps degrees
56:17 - choose to correct all caps degrees Scrat
56:30 - novice go to sleep go to sleep please
56:37 - please just go to sleep okay
56:40 - I'm gonna manually put it to sleep it's
56:43 - frozen
56:44 - once again dragon has crashed I have
56:46 - successfully crashed dragon press the
56:49 - key f5 to refresh look under commands so
56:53 - f5 is refresh okay
56:55 - unfortunately dragon has died maybe I
56:58 - can force quit it I think I just have to
57:04 - wait for it to die so yeah it's died
57:15 - that's very sad
57:36 - talk amongst yourselves whoops
57:51 - okay let's take a look at this does this
57:53 - seem right now draw that first line
57:56 - which is this part of the arm change the
58:01 - angle mode map the mouse two angles and
58:03 - degrees rotate and then draw another
58:05 - line Wow
58:11 - there's got to be a way to hold on I
58:15 - should be able to probably force quit it
58:18 - with this oh it came back alive
58:29 - wake up
58:30 - scratch that go to sleep so
58:38 - unfortunately I woke it had some sort of
58:41 - glitch there woke up etc etc and and I
58:49 - lost what I did I'm just gonna type it
58:52 - in manually because I'm really I'm gonna
58:54 - have to do a lot more work to practice
58:56 - this and figure this out
58:57 - wake up save this document activate
59:04 - Chrome go to sleep so I'm gonna look for
59:10 - f5 is refresh right so there's got to be
59:14 - under commands there's got to be a
59:22 - command for for f5 what's auto text oh
59:31 - that's probably like an ADD wake up wake
59:35 - up dictation global key commands press
59:40 - the shift are ah so I could do press the
59:43 - key shift are press the key command are
59:47 - press the key f5 would probably work
59:50 - right so that's what I need if I need to
59:54 - add a function key command so obviously
59:57 - I could just hit it with my finger but
59:58 - let's try
60:03 - wake up press the key command R press
60:14 - the key command R there we go so this is
60:22 - my current range of motion I suppose but
60:28 - that's about the only
60:34 - oh well boy this was a reality check for
60:40 - me about how little I can do with just
60:43 - dictation and p5 but this was a good
60:46 - experiment for me to see and learn all
60:49 - of the stuff that's missing so as I have
60:52 - time over the next couple weeks I'm
60:54 - actually one thing I should mention I've
60:55 - been doing a lot of reading and learning
60:56 - so I've got a lot of es6 stuff down that
60:59 - i'm really excited to come back in the
61:00 - fall and teach a bunch of JavaScript
61:01 - concepts that are part of es6 in
61:03 - particular the new syntax and class
61:07 - classes based syntax we're doing
61:08 - object-oriented programming I'm going to
61:10 - add that to my courses here at NYU and
61:11 - make a whole bunch of video tutorials
61:13 - about that use a headset so oh my
61:18 - goodness I didn't go to sleep go to
61:20 - sleep go to sleep okay
61:26 - so that's one thing that's been
61:29 - interesting for me but what I'm going to
61:31 - look into doing is seeing if I can
61:33 - customize more of the features and to be
61:37 - able to programming atom and switch back
61:39 - and forth if anyone wants to help me
61:41 - with this project I'm trying to remember
61:43 - the name of the open source repository
61:44 - that Tavis Rudd mentioned in the video I
61:48 - don't know if anybody knows it's like
61:50 - dragon speaks please just let me do
61:56 - github dragonfly this is it so this is a
62:07 - speech recognition framework allowing
62:09 - powerful python-based scripting and
62:11 - extension of Dragon NaturallySpeaking
62:13 - so in theory I haven't looked into this
62:15 - at all but in theory you can create your
62:20 - own grammars and examples and different
62:22 - things anyone is interested on and I
62:24 - know that Tavis Rudd is on Twitter and
62:26 - in that YouTube video has published a
62:28 - lot of code again everything's
62:29 - programmed in Python using vim and Emacs
62:32 - and I probably should go down that road
62:34 - I think you probably very smartly made
62:37 - those decisions to be able to work very
62:38 - effectively but for me you know I'm
62:41 - curious what can i push can I do web
62:44 - development JavaScript or processing
62:46 - through dictation
62:47 - I don't mind customizing and writing
62:48 - code to customize what I'm doing in
62:51 - Python but I would like the examples to
62:53 - be the same sort of stuff that I'm doing
62:54 - so if anybody was interested in helping
62:56 - with this please feel free to get in
62:59 - touch on Twitter at Schiffman or maybe I
63:02 - can create a github repository but uh
63:04 - it's very hard for me to actually do the
63:06 - development work to figure out this
63:08 - stuff out given that I can barely can I
63:09 - can't really type at the moment so um
63:11 - thanks for everyone for tuning in I
63:18 - wonder if I want to take it's 2:35 I'm a
63:22 - little bit late to an appointment that I
63:23 - have to go to oh I meant to uh I should
63:26 - have a guest video tutorial coming in
63:29 - the next couple weeks I hope so that'll
63:31 - be some content that will appear on the
63:32 - channel and perhaps in August I will be
63:35 - a bit more back into the swing of things
63:37 - and I'm very excited to talk to you
63:43 - about I'm curious to what I'm getting a
63:57 - marker over here I'm curious
64:02 - can i I'm going to talk to you about
64:05 - this with my left hand Const let thank
64:13 - you to ADA who is a supporter and viewer
64:18 - of the coding train who wrote a really
64:20 - nice blog post I will try to include it
64:23 - in the description for this video maybe
64:25 - someone can post it in the chat about
64:27 - the difference between Const let and VAR
64:29 - I think she I think that's where I I
64:34 - also watched a nice video from a fun fun
64:36 - function but ADA is working on a series
64:38 - of blog posts about es6 that have been
64:40 - very helpful to me and i watched a nice
64:42 - video from fun fun function also about
64:44 - const let and VAR so i hope to be
64:49 - covering this I'm just sort of curious
64:52 - how this goes that's actually not so bad
64:55 - we're using my left hand come to think
64:57 - of it and
64:59 - also I want to talk a lot this fall
65:05 - about the class keyword in es6 all right
65:18 - well you guys are all very kind to be
65:21 - tuning in I was going to do this I was
65:23 - thinking ah maybe I'll just do a
65:24 - experiment with this code dictation and
65:26 - old stuff just for the patreon
65:28 - subscribers I'm making a private stream
65:30 - and then I thought well why not I'll
65:32 - turn on the I'm here I might as well
65:34 - turn on the system see how it goes I'm
65:36 - gonna take five minutes to see if
65:37 - there's any questions I can answer
65:38 - if you are a patreon backer you can ask
65:41 - the question in the slack JavaScript
65:44 - voice recognition for JavaScript writes
65:47 - Simon I wonder if that is something that
65:50 - exists so maybe I should google that and
65:51 - take a look into that okay yeah yes 6
65:59 - equals JavaScript 2015 I'm Way behind
66:02 - you know I'm never not really a
66:04 - cutting-edge kind of person I'm just you
66:07 - know doing my best here keep up with
66:09 - things yeah cuz there's a new there's
66:12 - already gonna be another version of
66:14 - JavaScript I was trying to wait till
66:15 - yeah 6 was born I don't know what I was
66:17 - trying to do but you know I think it's
66:19 - time it's time for me to use some stuff
66:22 - from es6
66:22 - I don't want to use the you know at some
66:25 - point I would like to cover some of the
66:26 - more esoteric complex syntax but mostly
66:28 - I just want to use the stuff that makes
66:30 - things a little clearer and more elegant
66:31 - I'm that sort of thing the guest is not
66:37 - happy cat although I would love to have
66:40 - happy cat as a guest or do a
66:41 - collaboration with happy cat she has a
66:43 - wonderful YouTube channel that I would
66:44 - suggest you check out well you make a
66:47 - video of both neural networks in genetic
66:49 - evolution in one video yeah so
66:50 - unfortunately that was the path I was on
66:52 - so I got I would say maybe I got a tenth
66:55 - of the way through the neural network
66:57 - stuff I was gonna do a lot more I think
67:00 - I made two or three videos and then once
67:03 - I got through that I also was gonna look
67:05 - at genetic algorithms and involving
67:06 - neural network weights I do have some
67:08 - examples they're actually broken and I
67:10 - think I have a pull request that fit
67:12 - one of the examples I just haven't had a
67:13 - chance to look at it yet it's hard for
67:15 - me to sort of evaluate and run code but
67:18 - that's where I'm altom utley hoping to
67:21 - go so I will get to that it's just going
67:24 - to come later can you make a tutorial
67:26 - video about using HTML CSS and J's to
67:29 - make a website I would take a look at my
67:36 - HTML CSS playlist it's part of the
67:38 - foundations of JavaScript it's not
67:40 - taught in a kind of proper web
67:42 - development way but all the concepts are
67:44 - there for and I cover how to do creative
67:46 - coding with HTML CSS and JavaScript
67:48 - using p5 so that's something you could
67:50 - you could take a look at it that exists
67:51 - already okay could you do some Python I
67:57 - was also planning on doing some Python
67:58 - yes and actually I'm still looking for a
68:02 - really good Python book to read on my
68:05 - Kindle it's hard for me to read books
68:08 - that I have to hold and turn the pages
68:10 - of the Kindle is really easy and I don't
68:12 - like reading on an iPad or the computer
68:13 - so much so I'm any recommendations and
68:16 - maybe I'll come back and do a book
68:17 - review after I get through it I I've
68:19 - been reading about es6 and I'm also
68:20 - thinking of learning react but again I
68:23 - said this last time I think that might
68:25 - be much too useful for me in practical
68:27 - somebody might actually like learn
68:28 - something you get a job from my videos
68:30 - which is you know you shouldn't watch my
68:32 - videos to learn anything practical or
68:33 - useful so but I'm considering learning
68:36 - react especially because there's a new
68:38 - Alpha p5 GS web editor that is coming
68:41 - soon and it is built with react and I
68:43 - would like to be able to contribute to
68:45 - that and help with that open source
68:46 - project so it is something I should
68:47 - learn Cody
68:48 - Tetris Cody challenge I really love to
68:50 - do that now because I really got this
68:51 - dictation thing down I think I could
68:52 - tackle something like that with
68:53 - dictation I had a lot of tutorials
68:56 - already about text processing as a Jason
68:59 - Matthew asks go and check out it used to
69:02 - be called programming from A to Z I
69:04 - can't remember where we are at this
69:05 - point but I think well I'm Jacob use
69:10 - programming from A to Z sounds like it's
69:11 - a beginner course in programming but my
69:13 - video my course and playlist is actually
69:15 - for adventure
69:17 - people with their I do have beginner
69:19 - playlist but that program from A to Z
69:21 - playlist is not at all beginner so I
69:22 - think I'm going to change it to just
69:23 - something like programming with text
69:25 - which with matches suggestion I don't
69:27 - remember if that's been done already but
69:28 - go through look for that playlist it's
69:30 - all about working with text speaking of
69:33 - books any must read book about Java I
69:36 - don't know about must read I honestly I
69:39 - think there's a big classic what's the
69:42 - big classic Java textbook that everybody
69:45 - uses I think I used that probably over
69:47 - ten years ago you know I don't want you
69:49 - know this is the worst thing I could
69:51 - possibly do which is like to plug my own
69:52 - book but it's not to learn Java per se
69:55 - but if you want to learn from the
69:57 - beginning programming and want Java
69:59 - syntax if you look at the learning
70:01 - processing book that's exactly what I do
70:03 - in that book and using the processing
70:05 - development environment and after that
70:06 - you can kind of graduate to using
70:07 - eclipse and other Java syntax as well
70:10 - but just for learning Java itself
70:12 - there's a kind of well big Java is it
70:14 - called something like that I feel like
70:16 - is a textbook that I used a long time
70:18 - ago I don't recommend it but it's pretty
70:19 - comprehensive okay
70:25 - the Douglas Crockford book is a very
70:27 - interesting book and that's for
70:28 - JavaScript it's called the good parts
70:30 - it's not for learning Java a book that I
70:33 - absolutely love for learning JavaScript
70:35 - is eloquent JavaScript whoops
70:41 - eloquent JavaScript let's go to the this
70:49 - is a book that I used to learn Java
70:53 - scripts myself I don't know if it's
70:55 - using es6 syntax one wonderful things
70:57 - about it it's all available for free
70:58 - online which I try to do now with
71:01 - anything that I'm putting online so I
71:03 - appreciate that for sure and of course
71:04 - you can buy a copy to also support the
71:06 - author which I would encourage you to do
71:08 - if you like the book and also the
71:11 - getting started with p5.js is a nice
71:14 - book to learn the basics of JavaScript
71:15 - to the cop in the context of p5 just so
71:18 - much yeah and the slack of the patreon
71:20 - group in the slack channel writes
71:21 - program with text has already been done
71:23 - so if you're looking for all my
71:24 - tutorials about Markov chains and text
71:26 - analysis and word counting you can look
71:29 - for the programming with text it's also
71:31 - at Schiffman neck / e 2zii okay so unity
71:37 - would be great
71:37 - that's another
71:38 - that I should learn so I I'm trying to
71:41 - soak in knowledge and watch videos and
71:42 - read books while I'm not doing as much
71:45 - typing and I'm healing so to speak so
71:48 - unity Mike my major things are es6 react
71:52 - Python and now unity those would be
71:54 - things I would love to sort of pick up
71:55 - some skills with okay so thanks
71:57 - everybody it's 2:45 p.m. again you're
72:02 - welcome to join my patreon if you like
72:04 - it's going to be paused for the month of
72:05 - July so it won't be it won't be
72:09 - activated again until September 1st the
72:10 - August 1st will be paused if I set up
72:13 - the settings correctly I would encourage
72:15 - you to support in the meantime while I'm
72:16 - kind of on hiatus the processing
72:18 - foundation processing foundation org and
72:20 - of course there's also I'm just like
72:22 - plugging stuff now nature of code comm
72:24 - if you're interested supporting the
72:26 - nature of code book and other stuff that
72:28 - I'm doing you can you can do that as
72:30 - well I didn't see I'm glad in a way that
72:33 - I didn't see any super chat messages but
72:35 - I just want to make sure I didn't miss
72:36 - any so if somebody did do a super chat
72:38 - message please send me a tweet or an
72:41 - email I should hear something I want to
72:43 - mention I noticed something the chat
72:45 - said why don't you reply to your emails
72:46 - I pretty slow about replying to emails I
72:49 - do get a lot of just programming
72:50 - question emails and it's unrealistic I
72:52 - think for me too you know I could spend
72:54 - all day answering them and it's not that
72:55 - much but so typically if you have
72:58 - programming questions ask them at forum
72:59 - processing org but I do read all the
73:01 - emails and I do try to reply to them all
73:03 - eventually and I also try to reply to
73:06 - all the YouTube comments but I haven't
73:08 - been able to do that but know that if
73:10 - you're writing YouTube comments I am
73:12 - reading them all so I am reading all the
73:14 - comments
73:14 - I'm just not replying and you could
73:17 - always also tweet me at Schiffman on
73:20 - twitter
73:21 - okay raspberry pi would also be a great
73:23 - thing to learn okay thanks everybody for
73:27 - tuning in today to this extra live
73:31 - stream I may be back the first week of
73:34 - August if things are going well in terms
73:37 - of healing and dictation I'll try to
73:40 - think of some content I could do but I
73:43 - don't know when I'll be back in the full
73:45 - swing of things it could be a while so
73:48 - I'm sorry for that sort of yeah it's
73:51 - good
73:52 - I'm learning lots of new things about
73:53 - life by having this injury and I'll see
74:00 - you guys another time I don't know if
74:05 - this counts as an official livestream
74:07 - I'm a little worried about I was close
74:08 - to getting to livestream number 100 and
74:10 - I felt that I want to do something
74:12 - special for that I don't know if this
74:13 - counts maybe it does okay I'm going to
74:15 - turn this off the good news for you is
74:16 - this is very hard for me to figure out
74:17 - how to turn this off because I need to
74:19 - click a button over here which we really
74:21 - need to operate this other mouse okay it
74:23 - wasn't so hard I'm already doing it and
74:27 - I just want to also say thank you ever I
74:30 - got lots of really nice messages of
74:31 - support emails and tweets and things in
74:34 - the mail even so I really appreciate it
74:37 - it's really lovely things are fine
74:40 - doing well Healing having physical
74:43 - therapy should be back to things soon
74:45 - enough I will definitely keep everybody
74:47 - posted and I look forward to seeing you
74:49 - in the future on the channel if you have
74:51 - ideas for things that I could do or
74:53 - things that I can be helpful with please
74:55 - feel free to reach out anytime okay and
75:01 - I hope you enjoyed that completely
75:04 - insane totally messed up dictation
75:07 - attempt I really excited the name to get
75:09 - good at it and have a weird is sort of
75:10 - like strange performance art okay we
75:14 - can't run off I really have to turn this
75:15 - off now okay goodbye and see you in the
75:20 - future
75:20 - oh I do see the super chat so that does
75:23 - actually work but I don't see a message
75:26 - do I have to click on it let me try to
75:28 - click on it
75:31 - [Applause]
75:38 - so I don't see any way if see uh so just
75:41 - wanted to say that you are inspirational
75:43 - keep up the work love to see your vids
75:46 - from Ryan Zhang
75:47 - thank you very much Ryan Jiang thank you
75:50 - very much for that nice message wait ok
75:52 - let's see can I do this no so the way
75:59 - that I look at the chat maybe I can look
76:00 - at it over here the way that I look at
76:03 - the chat is no oh yeah so I think
76:14 - pandemonium didn't actually leave a
76:17 - message
76:17 - yeah yeah okay so I can actually see I
76:21 - can see those chat messages thank you
76:23 - for them okay goodbye everybody very
76:25 - nice to see your messages yes I'm late
76:27 - for my meeting I'm gonna go now but I
76:29 - have to figure out how to turn this off
76:32 - it's gonna take me a minute stop oh I
76:37 - never tweeted that I was doing this
76:39 - sorry everybody
76:42 - okay goodbye well thank you pandemonium
76:46 - I appreciate your super chat message
76:48 - again I I kind of have mixed feelings
76:50 - about using the system for a lot of
76:52 - different reasons but it was interesting
76:53 - to see it work for just this livestream
76:55 - since I fought I figured oh I pausing my
76:57 - patreon maybe I'll just put this up just
76:59 - as sort of like see but anyway okay good
77:01 - bye hi

Cleaned transcript:

hello good afternoon welcome to a special surprise sort of episode of the coding train I happened to be here at NYU for a couple meetings today oops I'm looking over here and so I thought I would pop up here to the studio and do a quick little experiment I've been as some of you might been following my channel I had a bicycle accident and I have a bunch of different broken body parts most seriously here this elbow this is actually now a splint which is different than I was wearing in the last video that I made and this actually comes off and I've started physical therapy but I've got another few weeks to be wearing these things it looks like I could maybe type but it's pretty uncomfortable and not the best thing for my body so I'm still holding off on doing typing I'm hearing an echo because I have a monitor I would love to know if the sound is okay I'm just gonna turn off this okay so that should get rid of the echo so I have something that I've installed on my computer here and I'm gonna do a quick experiment here wake up hello coding trained viewers how are you today it didn't work oh I'm in the wrong application try this again hello coding trained viewers oh shoot this was working so well this worked a minute ago let me try to open up TextEdit and hello Kotick trained viewers correct Kody's coding trained correct reviewers viewers exclamation mark so this I've been using a bunch of different dictation software I'm just gonna leave this on to be amused by how its following what I'm saying and getting lots of things wrong Mac OS has builtin dictation the software that I've installed here is actually called dragon speaks naturally and there is the sound might be a little bit loud okay this is a different microphone setup and I'm gonna oh yeah it's way up way up and turn the mic down okay is that better okay so high for Cody's viewers okay so what was I going to say I watched this YouTube video the other day I'm gonna try to pull it up here let me see open Chrome Google coding by voice Python Python correct pika I gotta get you this let me oops oh my goodness it's opening up eclipse there's a ghost in the machine you should open up a guy I'd still go to sleep oh and now is it too quiet no I see the levels are fine so scratch that by the way if you haven't watched my channel before it this is what I do it would have made sense for me to like set this up practice it and figure out an actual way to get it to work instead I just installed it and thought to come up here turn on a light public stream which apparently has some number of people watching right now like 500 to 26 while I'm fumbling my way through this okay go to sleep okay so you can see when I say go to sleep I can't do my typical actually maybe I can this right here wake up go to sleep so I need to remember to do that and to wake it up when I want to actually dictate wake up coding by voice YouTube's correct code E coding go to sleep oh yeah so this is a YouTube video that I will pull up so I recommend anybody watching if you're interested to watch this video Tavis Rudd is a developer who mostly programs in Python who had a rock climbing injury he tells the story in this video and set up a very elaborate system to do everything with dictation and in fact he continues to use this system today even though he's mostly I believe recovered and Ken type but he still does everything by voice now he used an open source API that I forget what it's called but it's in this video that works with dragon speaks he uses Emacs and vim which are specialized text editors that you can use in a terminal window so I haven't done any of this but I I'm curious you know fit but you know this may take a while to setup and I would love any help with this if anybody's interested okay could raise the volume a little bit sorry I'm gonna just turn the volume up a little bit now on my mic got distracted by the chat in that message let's see how that is it's a little bit up now okay so I watched this video I've been looking into kind of interested in trying to do a similar setup just as an experiment so I thought I would try to do today very briefly see how far I could get with just what's in Dragon speaks by itself without any additional settings or macros or interfacing with an API and the processing development environment ultimately I might like to try to set up to work with like atom text editor maybe atom live preview something like that clearly these systems I've been using it to send emails they it works remarkably well to dictate written English so something that I might write in an email or a word processing document even filling out a form in a webpage the dictation works quite well it also has some commands to operate the computer that I haven't really learned yet so we need to learn those but it is absolutely not set up in any way to do coding so some of the things that I imagine I'm gonna meet to you do like curly braces and variable names with camelcase or underscores it's not going to do any of that in an elegant way natively so I thought I would try to see what it could do what all the pitfalls are and maybe make a mental list or maybe some of you are watching could kind of take notes and send me a list of what are all the features that I might need and most of these features have been solved and implemented by Tavis run if you watch this video does this like almost wild performance of this strange language that he's invented to talk to his computer and but I'm kind of and maybe I could piggyback off of that system in some ways but I thought I would kind of start over a little bit from scratch here okay so I'm looking at this let me just come over some people are asking in the chat I'm gonna walk over here to the whiteboard just to explain here what's going on so first of all I have pretty good my shoulders are perfectly healthy and I can move around I have a what's it called scaphoid is that that's not the right word a very small fracture in this wrist from a bicycle accident it will hopefully heal on its own and in about a few weeks this will come off and I will do some physical therapy but hopefully this will just pretty much be fine good as new so to speak within the next few weeks the more serious injury is here this elbow I learned all the names of the bones and the different things but googling I've got can't come up with any of them on the fly right now but the elbow bone broke really split off right in half detached itself this way so this tricep muscle wasn't not attached to anything and so it's been repaired with surgery I have some artificial bone I have a metal plate I have a couple screws and this is actually a splint for protection to hold it in place but this actually comes off and I do physical therapy three or four times a day and what I thought I'd try to program was a simulation of the range of motion that I have so currently if I use this arm you know I can extend it all the way I actually can hyper extend it but this would be zero degrees this is maybe about 160 degrees something in radians my range of motion if I were to take this off and try to do the physical therapy now which I quote is currently about sorry it's about 15 degrees I can get to about here 15 degrees and then I can't this is much harder so I can get to about 125 degrees and so I'm hoping to get all the way back to 03 around 160 and this will take quite a bit of time the physical therapy so that's my current status I have taken let me say another couple things I basically taking this month July off I did one live stream from my apartment just to say hi to the channel and I'm doing this today maybe for another half an hour or so but I'm pausing for those of you who are supporting me on patreon that's patreon.com slash coding train I'm going to put it on pause so none of your donations will be taken for this month of course if you would like to anyway you're welcome to make a contribution the best way to do that is through nature of code comm which is I have an online system for purchasing a book but what I would suggest in lieu of the patreon contributions this month if you're looking to support something to make a donation to processing foundation org so you can check that out I also as an experiment enabled that YouTube super chat which I'll probably just turn off but since I'm experimented with so many different things today I thought I would see how that works I kind of have mixed feelings about the whole super chat system I don't I don't particularly like the idea of paid chat messages and I want to go on a long discussion of that but I thought I would turn it on and see and then I'll probably turn it off again because the crowdfunding that I'm using mostly for this channel is oh actually exclusively is through patreon service okay that aside Kody in the chat whoops Kody in the chat asks does anybody know how long Dan won't be able to type I'm hopeful my you know as much as I love doing this YouTube channel and it is it brings me so much happiness to be able to be here and do this my alt my my main goal is to be able to be back and typing by the fall semester which is early September III think I need at least a few more weeks of rest healing and physical therapy before I'm gonna have more significant use of these arms you know I can kind of do some one finger typing I've been doing dictation for emails but we'll see it'll be a while before I'm you know sitting for I certainly don't think that I can sit for hours at a stretch typing you know it's probably not the best thing in terms of you know the kind of exercises in use of the arm that I should be rebuilding okay so I don't actually know the answer to that but I will be happy to provide updates I'm gonna be out of town next week having a nice little break and vacation and then I'll be back in town and having more physical therapy and doctor's appointments so we'll see if anybody wants to see my xrays you can follow me at shipment on Twitter I posted them if you want to join my patreon I posted some more pictures of the scar and swelling that you probably don't want to see but if about this now okay scratch that going sleep I should be nice to dragon so then go to sleep sounds very like command like I need to like rework I like to be very polite good thoughtful what apologize a lot I need to work on that with my dictation stuff okay somebody posted voice code dot IO I'm not active on Instagram now okay so what time is it now first I have another thing shoot okay wait somebody created a new song it's on soundcloud it was based on the minesweeper it was a play on it's floodfill time I just forgot how it was it's in a youtube comment maybe I can find it sound cloud somebody can find it for me and then give me the URL in slack that would be great I'm gonna look for it in YouTube comments cuz I think I have a way of doing that here so I can play this song I'm going on this computer Oh somebody found it already thank you alright cuz I had shared it so i ke b is h o P I am typing right now just using one finger on each hand so it's very slow and let's see it's let's whoops let's play this one oh you can't hear it I have to change some settings here sound loop back no multi output device I think I need to do that maybe you can hear it but it's very quiet yeah I know I have to change the settings you can listen to this on your own time it's very quiet well maybe I'll come back to it later okay so let's see how this goes now but thank you like bishop I love these remixes and I should let you know that there's a new theme song coming a music video I shot all that with some collaborators which I'll post about before I had this so I fully used to my arm then okay so let's see here so I'm now in processing so let's see if I can get some stuff happening here people in the chat are asking why so much offtopic discussion I don't know if you're asking me that question or asking the chat question but unfortunately those of you who are here to hope that my neural network series is continuing and hope that I'm gonna do a lot of coding I apologize I'm sincerely sorry you're just gonna have to wait on that I probably won't be back I definitely won't be back until August with any of that content and it could be a little bit later depending on how things go I've decided that this month July is just a kind of month hiatus but I thought since I was here I would try to turn this on and and say hi and do a little bit of stuff so so here we go let's see wake up void setup oh I'm in the wrong void setup I'm getting okay hold on why is this happening let me relaunch processing it was typing and it was I was I did actually test and it was dictating into processing earlier and not sure why it doesn't want to do that now using the mouse is definitely the hardest thing the trackpad that is Kancil correction go to sleep I know it happened I was in the correction mode oh I turned off my mic you you okay now I'm back okay okay okay I'm back did you guys hear me answer the question about why so many offtopic discussions was the mic just making noise oh boy all right I don't know what I had the mic I'm all messed up what a disaster okay did I talk about the music video that's coming that I talk did you hear me talk about that I'm not doing the neural network stuff for a while because of this etc I can't yeah okay and I'm getting some very good advice which is don't necessarily rely on the YouTube chat for sound feedback as i okay so I don't know why I'm not able to get the dictation to work in processing let me see wake up void setup okay so maybe I need to question mark okay also only certain applications are supported what does it mean you can dictate into an unsupported application if you want to dictate into an application that's not on the supported list but try not to use your keyboard or mouse I see that's going to be a problem because I'm definitely gonna whoops all right let's don't it all right let's figure this out maybe if I relaunch it so you guys just have to bear with me here for a second oh so sad oh there we go scratch that scratch that correct Seth area correct Seth as soon as I clicked my mouth my mouse it stopped allowing me to dictate oh that's so sad well here's problem number one open processing open Adam open Adam let's try this well this is going to be a failure correct be a failure be a success exclamation mark new line scratch that all right now now the thing is I'm a little bit concerned that if I new line if I start to use the mouse to delete something let's try that I'm going to do command a go to sleep wake up test one two three okay so already I'm having better success with Adam okay I have an idea go to sleep wake up open terminal C D slash tilde slash users oh no no I don't need that desktop PWD new line PWD new line p WD new line you're lying go to sleep okay so I the reason why I wanted to attempt this experiment with processing is that it was it's an allinone environment and I wasn't going to have to switch between the browser and the text editor but let's try doing this in Chrome let's start doing this okay so I want to go open Chrome Oh wake up wake up go to open Chrome open Chrome go to sleep do I have to be in the finder how do i how do I get to the Dragon commands if I'm not if I don't want to be dictating it to terminal open Chrome wake up open Chrome how many viewers have I lost now there's probably nobody watching anymore okay correct flagrantly oh my god fascinating this is fascinating to see how the software works and what kind of it's not free software and this is a dragon naturally speaking trollese go to sleep go to sleep okay so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to open up Chrome and I'm going to go to p5.js org and we go to download and I'm gonna download p5.js complete and gonna go find this I'm gonna open this up and I'm gonna get empty example and I'm going to put it on the desktop then I'm gonna go to Adam and I'm gonna say open desktop empty example and sketch touch yes okay this is good I'm gonna delete everything now I'm gonna go back to terminal oh I'm standing in front of this wake up Python space M M simple is it case sensitive let's see yeah go to sleep so already I need some sort of so if anyone's making a list for me to keep track of things that I need to investigate if I'm actually going to do this two things is one why doesn't processing work with dragon and insider' a way that I can get it to two is what is a way for me to write some sort of macro command I need I could just say start server to drag in and it's going to automatically launch the server and then I need to be able to figure out a way if I'm in atom two with a command my goal here would be as a experiment as an academic experiment here you know I'm I have some use of my hands but what would it what would it mean to code without any use of hands whatsoever I need to do everything completely for voice how would I get from Adam to Chrome Oh voice code dot IO Simon in the chat is suggesting how interesting I will have to take a look at that I will take a look at that I mean I'm not going to purchase it right now voice code dot IO advanced voice control platform interesting okay I'm going to take a look at this later so that's interesting so if I go now to localhost oops I did it on the desktop that's fine desktop empty example and if I open up the console okay so now if I go back to Adam I definitely need a way of triggering command s so how do i with dragon switch to finder I don't know so switch to Chrome instead of open Chrome let's try that wake up switch to Chrome go to sleep so that didn't seem to work so if anyone wants to look at the Dragon documentation and help me out here give me some tips switch between Windows with naturally speaking you can say switch to to change the window I'm getting that message in the chat okay we are here to waste time with this useless voice app yes so if you're not interested in that thanks for watching I switched to Google Chrome okay wake up switch to Google Chrome hmm that didn't seem to work either scratch that go to sleep all right okay here let's give this a try okay wake up function setup correct so setup choose to open paren close paren curly brace scratch that open curly bracket new line new line create canvas correct create campus create canvas create canvas create canvas scratch that scratch that scratch that create canvas hmm so good sleep okay so here's item number two I need say start Google Chrome I'll try that so I need to come up with a way of stringing words together without spaces and using camel case and I know again with the video that I referenced the tavis rudd video this is all something that he worked out for coding in Python right now I'm just making a mental list of things so I need to be able to say create canvas and I probably could also just create I could probably pull the p5 API and like put that in as a bunch of like add that to a dictionary I can probably work through instance from sort of training yeah so there's probably way too fine I'm getting this I'm getting this this folio a way to define a dictionary so switch to next window list all windows okay wake up list all windows list all windows scratch that scratch that go to sleep so that didn't seem to work either yeah scratch that scratch that the scratch that song never forget the scratch that's mmm wake up open parentheses 640 comma 480 go to end correct 4480 correct 4480 go to end go to sleep so how do I move the cursor around I mean I can obviously do that with the arrow keys so that's another if anyone's keeping a track of this list how I move the cursor around is something that I need to be able to do wake up semicolon go to end go to sleep so go to end is something that I was using when dictating emails and other things were it would immediately move the cursor to the end but that didn't seem to work okay here wake up function background open paren close paren open curly braket new line correct background draw go to sleep so weirdly I've noticed this is another bug that seems to be in dragon when I tell it to correct something it kind of selects the wrong area it you notice how it's selected it missed the B and it selected the parenthesis so I don't know if that's just because Adam is not technically supported so it wasn't able to select the right thing okay wake up background open paren 51 semicolon newline fill open friend correct fill whoa okay so it lost correct fill choose to open paren 255 semicolon newline ellipse scratch that rect mode all right so a whoa go to sleep so another thing is to again this builtin dictionary if we're camel casing because what if I want to create like write a function or declare a variable that doesn't exist but then also have a builtin list of words those are two of the things I need wake up all caps Center go to sleep that work pretty well I know it's not going to understand this wake up open paren Mouse X correct now Mouse comma Mouse Y comma 16 comma 16 so again I have the same scratch that go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep I know that's the children's song it's I listened to that have with my kids Elizabeth Mitchell sings it go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep my something I can't remember the words close curly bracket wake up close curly bracket go to sleep now there must be a way that I can do command s there go to sleep my there must be a way don't correct the word you said there must be a way for me to say command s right for save now I can actually just type this in and it will auto format I have Adam configure to auto format the code which is nice like all that white space errors I don't really care about but there should be a way for me to say command s then I should be able to say switch what if I go here to commands help help oh I'm in the correction window correction window okay so these are all the well it's like Safari okay so I'm gonna have to look wake up global applications I'm sorry that the font there's no way you guys can read this activate it looks like the word is activate activate Adam or wake up activate Adam activate Chrome activate Adam activate Chrome activate Adam activate Chrome's quick photos thank you scratch that go to sleep I wanted to talk to me why I want to talk to me I'm talking to it I'm being as nice as I can alright that's good now how do I do command s commands a global menu navigation click click file menu but there's got a way to click save choose file close window copy selection go to beginning go to end save would be under s save this document okay wake up new line your line safest document Oh go sleep it did it wake up activate Chrome refresh this page that was a fantasy that that would work go to sleep I have a feeling that it's gonna be happier with me using Safari just based on the fact that I saw so far II show up but I don't know that I could bring myself to do that okay so I can hit refresh hey move mouse I can move the mouse with my one finger Oh dragon quit unexpectedly reopen so that's my quota challenge for today through dictation I was able to use p5.js to create a simple program of moving the mouse around now I wanted to try to simulate my range of motion so I'm seeing um so what time is it 15 I've got to go by 230 because I have some meetings so let's see if I can get a little further and maybe answer some questions I don't know what else I could do no coming back another time okay so let's see here let me think about this so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to draw a line that is you know what I should do when I'm doing my physical therapy is I should monitor my physical therapy with a Kinect and actually measure the angle so that's something I'll do eventually that's a good idea right cuz the Kinect should be able to determine the angle for the range of motion that I'm getting here I have to work on that once I get up and once they get up and running with this whole programming education thing okay so let's see here so let me delete this wake up Oh microphones off stroke open paren 2255 correct 25 to 55 go to end end of line Oh choose 1 go to end so this has to be low go to sleep this has to be lower case wake up new line line open paren 360 comma 240 comma 400 comma 240 new line float a equals correct floats choose three correct equals equals equals symbol scratch that equal sign go to sleep say I've learned that equal sign is what I have to say for equals which I should probably alter the settings so that I just have to say equals that's another thing so altering some of these settings oh I mean I've been job that's correct I forgot oh they care camera still goes off camera on look at that neck dictation suddenly worked with that camera amazing wake up correct floats select floats go to sleep yeah so this is it being off so I've seen this behavior this seems like a bug to me I don't think I'm doing anything wrong notice that it selected the correct number of characters but in the wrong place it should select this float so why is it not working I don't know wake up bar scratch that shoot go to sleep so the other thing is I'm often in that correct mode how do I cancel that correct mode let's try this again wake up var a equal sign map choose to open paren Mouse X comma 0 comma width correct 0 choose to correct width choose 2 comma 15 comma 125 correct now thanks Mouse X so I have to figure out a way scratch that go to sleep so I have to figure out a way to there's probably way I could spell that out if in a custom way but again that's the sort of dictionary thing I mean I I said var hey witch why not keep that but I meant this to be a so what I'm doing here is I'm trying to map the mouse position to a range of angles which is currently yesterday my physical therapy this is the range of motion that was measured so I was able to get to about 15 degrees to about 125 degrees that's I'm not actually it's more like this probably and I you know I want to get to 0 and I want to get to about you know probably 160 okay so now so one thing I want to do now that I'm gonna use rotation I don't want I want to draw this line relative to 00 I think that'll be nicer so I'm gonna say I'm gonna add and wake up translate open paren with / comma height / close paren semicolon go to sleep all right so that's interesting I got with / they probably should have said with / maybe that would have worked wake up correct with / with / correct with choose to correct tightened by my height / go to sleep okay so I'm learning getting closer oops you lazy the dictate so I'm gonna change the line to go from like negative 100 to zero zero zero and then now wake up line open paren zero comma zero 100 comma zero scratch that zero comma zero comma 100 comma zero correct choose it actually gave me the full option of what I wanted scratch that zero comma zero comma 100 comma zero correct that choose to correct why scratch that scratch that put that back go to sleep oh my god this is not working at all I just curious there's got its got to be like less than 200 people watching at this point with you go outside smell the flowers give somebody a hug appreciate things besides me here okay alright alright oh yeah let me let me get back to things all right let me wake up whine openparen zero comma zero 100 comma zero choose two save this document activate Chrome activate Google Chrome localhost go to sleep so I need some way of immediately going to localhost and navigating somehow to the web application that I want to look at again if I was just doing this in processing I'll just need to say run run stop or play stop that kind of thing but since I couldn't get that to work here we are uncaught syntax error sketch das line 12 wake up activate atom I know sleep I need a comma here wake up wake up comma save this document activate Chrome refresh that didn't work so I don't know how to refresh with a command ok there is there is the line ok we're doing well now rotate open paren a closed paren semicolon correct a go to sleep so that needs to be a lowercase a just probably wait for me to say that and this should be the word rotate so obviously I'm still doing way too much with one hand here and I'm kind of running out of time here but let's see how this open let's see how this goes and by the way you might be wondering why am I looking this way whenever I start talking it's because I have a monitor over here that has exactly what you see it's it's so that I can do this and I can say I'm pointing to line I'm pointing to rotate a pointing to VAR a but for some reason I I really what I need is a monitor up there so that I can look more like I'm talking to you but for some reason I have this habit of just looking at the screen over here which is a little bit weird okay let's see and wake up save this document and activate Chrome Oh didn't wake up wake up save this document activate Chrome go to sleep so whatever my refresh command would be mmm so so my angle is wrong right so I actually don't want this is this is not what my harm does I want it to go from so this is the thing I always forget in a computer graphics system pointing down is positive pointing up is negative and rotation right this is rotating 15 degrees so I actually want to be between negative 15 degrees and negative a negative 1/25 wake up activate atom go to sleep so in the interest of time this by the way should say so this should be between negative 125 and negative 15 and guess what also what are these measurements in these measurements are in degrees natively most computer programs graphics programs will think of angles in terms of radians so I actually need to add something else wake up a new line angle mode didn't even wake it up wake up you little sleepyhead wake up new line angle mode open paren caps degrees choose to correct all caps degrees Scrat novice go to sleep go to sleep please please just go to sleep okay I'm gonna manually put it to sleep it's frozen once again dragon has crashed I have successfully crashed dragon press the key f5 to refresh look under commands so f5 is refresh okay unfortunately dragon has died maybe I can force quit it I think I just have to wait for it to die so yeah it's died that's very sad talk amongst yourselves whoops okay let's take a look at this does this seem right now draw that first line which is this part of the arm change the angle mode map the mouse two angles and degrees rotate and then draw another line Wow there's got to be a way to hold on I should be able to probably force quit it with this oh it came back alive wake up scratch that go to sleep so unfortunately I woke it had some sort of glitch there woke up etc etc and and I lost what I did I'm just gonna type it in manually because I'm really I'm gonna have to do a lot more work to practice this and figure this out wake up save this document activate Chrome go to sleep so I'm gonna look for f5 is refresh right so there's got to be under commands there's got to be a command for for f5 what's auto text oh that's probably like an ADD wake up wake up dictation global key commands press the shift are ah so I could do press the key shift are press the key command are press the key f5 would probably work right so that's what I need if I need to add a function key command so obviously I could just hit it with my finger but let's try wake up press the key command R press the key command R there we go so this is my current range of motion I suppose but that's about the only oh well boy this was a reality check for me about how little I can do with just dictation and p5 but this was a good experiment for me to see and learn all of the stuff that's missing so as I have time over the next couple weeks I'm actually one thing I should mention I've been doing a lot of reading and learning so I've got a lot of es6 stuff down that i'm really excited to come back in the fall and teach a bunch of JavaScript concepts that are part of es6 in particular the new syntax and class classes based syntax we're doing objectoriented programming I'm going to add that to my courses here at NYU and make a whole bunch of video tutorials about that use a headset so oh my goodness I didn't go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep okay so that's one thing that's been interesting for me but what I'm going to look into doing is seeing if I can customize more of the features and to be able to programming atom and switch back and forth if anyone wants to help me with this project I'm trying to remember the name of the open source repository that Tavis Rudd mentioned in the video I don't know if anybody knows it's like dragon speaks please just let me do github dragonfly this is it so this is a speech recognition framework allowing powerful pythonbased scripting and extension of Dragon NaturallySpeaking so in theory I haven't looked into this at all but in theory you can create your own grammars and examples and different things anyone is interested on and I know that Tavis Rudd is on Twitter and in that YouTube video has published a lot of code again everything's programmed in Python using vim and Emacs and I probably should go down that road I think you probably very smartly made those decisions to be able to work very effectively but for me you know I'm curious what can i push can I do web development JavaScript or processing through dictation I don't mind customizing and writing code to customize what I'm doing in Python but I would like the examples to be the same sort of stuff that I'm doing so if anybody was interested in helping with this please feel free to get in touch on Twitter at Schiffman or maybe I can create a github repository but uh it's very hard for me to actually do the development work to figure out this stuff out given that I can barely can I can't really type at the moment so um thanks for everyone for tuning in I wonder if I want to take it's 235 I'm a little bit late to an appointment that I have to go to oh I meant to uh I should have a guest video tutorial coming in the next couple weeks I hope so that'll be some content that will appear on the channel and perhaps in August I will be a bit more back into the swing of things and I'm very excited to talk to you about I'm curious to what I'm getting a marker over here I'm curious can i I'm going to talk to you about this with my left hand Const let thank you to ADA who is a supporter and viewer of the coding train who wrote a really nice blog post I will try to include it in the description for this video maybe someone can post it in the chat about the difference between Const let and VAR I think she I think that's where I I also watched a nice video from a fun fun function but ADA is working on a series of blog posts about es6 that have been very helpful to me and i watched a nice video from fun fun function also about const let and VAR so i hope to be covering this I'm just sort of curious how this goes that's actually not so bad we're using my left hand come to think of it and also I want to talk a lot this fall about the class keyword in es6 all right well you guys are all very kind to be tuning in I was going to do this I was thinking ah maybe I'll just do a experiment with this code dictation and old stuff just for the patreon subscribers I'm making a private stream and then I thought well why not I'll turn on the I'm here I might as well turn on the system see how it goes I'm gonna take five minutes to see if there's any questions I can answer if you are a patreon backer you can ask the question in the slack JavaScript voice recognition for JavaScript writes Simon I wonder if that is something that exists so maybe I should google that and take a look into that okay yeah yes 6 equals JavaScript 2015 I'm Way behind you know I'm never not really a cuttingedge kind of person I'm just you know doing my best here keep up with things yeah cuz there's a new there's already gonna be another version of JavaScript I was trying to wait till yeah 6 was born I don't know what I was trying to do but you know I think it's time it's time for me to use some stuff from es6 I don't want to use the you know at some point I would like to cover some of the more esoteric complex syntax but mostly I just want to use the stuff that makes things a little clearer and more elegant I'm that sort of thing the guest is not happy cat although I would love to have happy cat as a guest or do a collaboration with happy cat she has a wonderful YouTube channel that I would suggest you check out well you make a video of both neural networks in genetic evolution in one video yeah so unfortunately that was the path I was on so I got I would say maybe I got a tenth of the way through the neural network stuff I was gonna do a lot more I think I made two or three videos and then once I got through that I also was gonna look at genetic algorithms and involving neural network weights I do have some examples they're actually broken and I think I have a pull request that fit one of the examples I just haven't had a chance to look at it yet it's hard for me to sort of evaluate and run code but that's where I'm altom utley hoping to go so I will get to that it's just going to come later can you make a tutorial video about using HTML CSS and J's to make a website I would take a look at my HTML CSS playlist it's part of the foundations of JavaScript it's not taught in a kind of proper web development way but all the concepts are there for and I cover how to do creative coding with HTML CSS and JavaScript using p5 so that's something you could you could take a look at it that exists already okay could you do some Python I was also planning on doing some Python yes and actually I'm still looking for a really good Python book to read on my Kindle it's hard for me to read books that I have to hold and turn the pages of the Kindle is really easy and I don't like reading on an iPad or the computer so much so I'm any recommendations and maybe I'll come back and do a book review after I get through it I I've been reading about es6 and I'm also thinking of learning react but again I said this last time I think that might be much too useful for me in practical somebody might actually like learn something you get a job from my videos which is you know you shouldn't watch my videos to learn anything practical or useful so but I'm considering learning react especially because there's a new Alpha p5 GS web editor that is coming soon and it is built with react and I would like to be able to contribute to that and help with that open source project so it is something I should learn Cody Tetris Cody challenge I really love to do that now because I really got this dictation thing down I think I could tackle something like that with dictation I had a lot of tutorials already about text processing as a Jason Matthew asks go and check out it used to be called programming from A to Z I can't remember where we are at this point but I think well I'm Jacob use programming from A to Z sounds like it's a beginner course in programming but my video my course and playlist is actually for adventure people with their I do have beginner playlist but that program from A to Z playlist is not at all beginner so I think I'm going to change it to just something like programming with text which with matches suggestion I don't remember if that's been done already but go through look for that playlist it's all about working with text speaking of books any must read book about Java I don't know about must read I honestly I think there's a big classic what's the big classic Java textbook that everybody uses I think I used that probably over ten years ago you know I don't want you know this is the worst thing I could possibly do which is like to plug my own book but it's not to learn Java per se but if you want to learn from the beginning programming and want Java syntax if you look at the learning processing book that's exactly what I do in that book and using the processing development environment and after that you can kind of graduate to using eclipse and other Java syntax as well but just for learning Java itself there's a kind of well big Java is it called something like that I feel like is a textbook that I used a long time ago I don't recommend it but it's pretty comprehensive okay the Douglas Crockford book is a very interesting book and that's for JavaScript it's called the good parts it's not for learning Java a book that I absolutely love for learning JavaScript is eloquent JavaScript whoops eloquent JavaScript let's go to the this is a book that I used to learn Java scripts myself I don't know if it's using es6 syntax one wonderful things about it it's all available for free online which I try to do now with anything that I'm putting online so I appreciate that for sure and of course you can buy a copy to also support the author which I would encourage you to do if you like the book and also the getting started with p5.js is a nice book to learn the basics of JavaScript to the cop in the context of p5 just so much yeah and the slack of the patreon group in the slack channel writes program with text has already been done so if you're looking for all my tutorials about Markov chains and text analysis and word counting you can look for the programming with text it's also at Schiffman neck / e 2zii okay so unity would be great that's another that I should learn so I I'm trying to soak in knowledge and watch videos and read books while I'm not doing as much typing and I'm healing so to speak so unity Mike my major things are es6 react Python and now unity those would be things I would love to sort of pick up some skills with okay so thanks everybody it's 245 p.m. again you're welcome to join my patreon if you like it's going to be paused for the month of July so it won't be it won't be activated again until September 1st the August 1st will be paused if I set up the settings correctly I would encourage you to support in the meantime while I'm kind of on hiatus the processing foundation processing foundation org and of course there's also I'm just like plugging stuff now nature of code comm if you're interested supporting the nature of code book and other stuff that I'm doing you can you can do that as well I didn't see I'm glad in a way that I didn't see any super chat messages but I just want to make sure I didn't miss any so if somebody did do a super chat message please send me a tweet or an email I should hear something I want to mention I noticed something the chat said why don't you reply to your emails I pretty slow about replying to emails I do get a lot of just programming question emails and it's unrealistic I think for me too you know I could spend all day answering them and it's not that much but so typically if you have programming questions ask them at forum processing org but I do read all the emails and I do try to reply to them all eventually and I also try to reply to all the YouTube comments but I haven't been able to do that but know that if you're writing YouTube comments I am reading them all so I am reading all the comments I'm just not replying and you could always also tweet me at Schiffman on twitter okay raspberry pi would also be a great thing to learn okay thanks everybody for tuning in today to this extra live stream I may be back the first week of August if things are going well in terms of healing and dictation I'll try to think of some content I could do but I don't know when I'll be back in the full swing of things it could be a while so I'm sorry for that sort of yeah it's good I'm learning lots of new things about life by having this injury and I'll see you guys another time I don't know if this counts as an official livestream I'm a little worried about I was close to getting to livestream number 100 and I felt that I want to do something special for that I don't know if this counts maybe it does okay I'm going to turn this off the good news for you is this is very hard for me to figure out how to turn this off because I need to click a button over here which we really need to operate this other mouse okay it wasn't so hard I'm already doing it and I just want to also say thank you ever I got lots of really nice messages of support emails and tweets and things in the mail even so I really appreciate it it's really lovely things are fine doing well Healing having physical therapy should be back to things soon enough I will definitely keep everybody posted and I look
