00:00 - [BELL DINGING]
00:00 - Hello.
00:02 - Welcome to the
first video in what
00:05 - is a playlist of many, many,
many, probably too many videos
00:09 - about learning to code.
00:10 - If you have never
written any code before,
00:12 - if you've never
programmed before,
00:14 - if you don't know anything
about programming,
00:17 - it's my intention for this
playlist to be for you.
00:20 - So this is the first
introductory video.
00:23 - I'm just going to talk about
the pieces of the puzzle
00:26 - that I'm going to use
throughout this video series
00:29 - and show you where all
those things are and kind
00:31 - of a little bit about the
history of those things just
00:34 - to get started in
learning to code.
00:37 - Learning to code.
00:38 - You don't have to
have know anything,
00:39 - and all you need is a
computer with a web browser
00:42 - to follow along.
00:42 - You don't have to download
anything, install anything.
00:45 - I'm so excited about that.
00:46 - Now, here's the thing.
00:48 - If you choose today,
August 31, 2018--
00:55 - this is the time
of the recording.
00:57 - There's many videos that
follow this in the playlist.
00:59 - Many of those videos were done
a year ago, two years ago,
01:03 - three years ago.
01:04 - They're using the
same exact stuff
01:06 - that I'm going to show
you, but the screen
01:08 - is going to look a
little bit different.
01:09 - So, I'm starting
over because there's
01:11 - a new tool that just came out
today called the p5.js Web
01:15 - Editor, and it's
the tool that I want
01:16 - to use for people following
this tutorial series.
01:20 - So the first few videos
will have that tool in it,
01:22 - and the rest of
the videos are just
01:24 - going to have the same
concepts that you could
01:26 - keep using in that editor.
01:27 - And maybe someday all of
them will be replaced.
01:29 - I have no idea.
01:30 - I'm going to stop
talking about that.
01:31 - That's not the
important part, but I
01:32 - wanted to make that clear if you
happen to be-- if you're just
01:35 - want to like, race ahead
and see all the videos.
01:38 - All right, so what does it
mean to program the computer?
01:41 - So what it means to
program the computer
01:43 - is to write a set of
instructions for the computer
01:45 - to follow.
01:46 - And the way that I'm
going to frame that,
01:49 - for the purpose of this
course, is all about
01:51 - writing instructions for the
computer to draw pictures.
01:55 - So in other words, you
could imagine a window
01:57 - on the computer screen, and
you're providing instructions
02:01 - for things that should
appear in the window.
02:03 - Draw a rectangle.
02:04 - Draw a blue rectangle.
02:06 - Draw 10 rectangles.
02:07 - Draw a rectangle, then a circle,
then a rectangle, then a circle
02:10 - and alternate the
colors black and white,
02:11 - black and white,
black and white.
02:13 - There are so many
ways that we could
02:14 - think about how you
mean might in English,
02:16 - or whatever your native language
is, instruct the computer
02:19 - to follow some algorithm.
02:22 - An algorithm being
a series of steps
02:25 - to execute to solve a problem.
02:27 - Writing code is code
instructions to execute
02:32 - an algorithm, a series
of steps to solve
02:34 - some difficult problem.
02:35 - Now, in this course, we're not
going to necessarily solve--
02:38 - but hopefully you might
solve some problems--
02:40 - but you can also just play
around and experiment and make
02:43 - beautiful pictures, and that's
where we're going to start.
02:47 - But we need some way
of doing this together.
02:51 - Drawing a rectangle,
drawing a circle--
02:53 - the computer doesn't
understand that.
02:55 - You and I could understand that
if we speak the same language,
02:58 - or even if we don't we
might be able to use
03:01 - body language or some other way
of, kind of, human intuition
03:04 - to communicate.
03:05 - But the computer
requires specific syntax.
03:10 - And the syntax that
you need-- the syntax
03:15 - is defined by the
programming language you
03:18 - choose to write your code in.
03:20 - And boy oh boy oh
boy, you know Google--
03:23 - go have fun Googling
what's the best programming
03:25 - language to learn in two
thousand four hundred
03:27 - and-- that doesn't
make any sense.
03:29 - Two 20, 2043, whatever
time in the future
03:31 - that you're watching this video.
03:33 - I'm not going to worry myself
with any of that stuff.
03:36 - I'm going to pick something.
03:37 - I'm going to pick a programming
language called JavaScript.
03:41 - The reason I'm
going to pick it is
03:43 - because it happens to be one
that I know a little bit.
03:47 - And it also happens to
be one in which there
03:49 - is a particular library, and
I'll talk about what that is.
03:52 - That is a library of code of
helper functions of things
03:56 - that'll help you along in
JavaScript called p5.js.
04:00 - And this is a particular
library that's
04:02 - created by a nonprofit
organization called
04:05 - The Processing Foundation.
04:06 - I will include lots of links
about The Processing Foundation
04:09 - and all of its initiatives.
04:10 - It's an open-source
project, which means
04:13 - it is all there available.
04:14 - All about how p5.js
works is all available
04:17 - for you to learn
and find out about.
04:20 - And as a beginner, one
of the missions of p5
04:23 - is beginners learning to
code aren't just users of p5,
04:27 - but can be contributors to p5.
04:29 - So you can
participate in helping
04:31 - to make this tool that
you are learning to use,
04:33 - and I encourage you to
get involved with that,
04:35 - and I'm happy to
help facilitate that.
04:38 - So, by the way,
p5.js also grew out
04:40 - of another project that's
part of The Processing
04:42 - Foundation, which is
just called Processing.
04:44 - It uses-- this is very
confusing, I realize.
04:46 - I'm going to stop talking
about different programming
04:48 - languages in a second.
04:49 - It's built on top of
a programming language
04:51 - called Java, which sounds
a lot like JavaScript.
04:54 - And in fact, JavaScript
was named JavaScript
04:56 - because at the
time Java was like,
04:58 - this, super cool thing to
use and it still is for me,
05:01 - I suppose.
05:02 - I mean, I like it.
05:03 - But I don't know if you've ever
been to one of those web pages
05:06 - where it's, like, giving
you a lot of error messages
05:08 - about a Java applet.
05:09 - It's not so well suited
for sharing on the web,
05:12 - and JavaScript is the
programming language
05:15 - of the browser.
05:16 - So if you want to make
this strange picture--
05:19 - which is square, circle,
square, circle, square--
05:22 - happen in the browser by writing
instructions in JavaScript,
05:26 - you can use the p5.js library.
05:29 - You can share it instantly with
your friends, with your family,
05:33 - with your coworkers, with
your fellow students.
05:35 - You can get feedback.
05:36 - I'm going to show
you how to do all
05:38 - of this in this video series.
05:41 - Now again, it's important to
note this is not the only way
05:43 - to learn to program.
05:44 - You know, if you were
here in the room with me
05:46 - I would ask you to
just like "shout out
05:48 - the names of other programming
languages you know about."
05:50 - And you might say, like, Python,
or C, or C#, or COBOL, or PHP,
05:59 - or I don't know,
something else there.
06:02 - Java, blah blah blah.
06:03 - We could keep going
on and on, and these
06:05 - are in no particular order.
06:07 - My goal for you
in this course is
06:10 - to learn about the
concepts of programming,
06:13 - to be creative with programming,
to discover how to realize
06:17 - your own ideas through coding.
06:21 - And this is a nice
place for us to start.
06:24 - We're going to get
the benefit of being
06:25 - able to put our stuff
instantly in the web browser,
06:27 - and if some day you discover
some of these other tools
06:30 - makes sense for other projects
that you would like to learn,
06:33 - this is going to give you
a foundation of knowledge
06:35 - for that.
06:36 - In this playlist, in this
series and all of the videos
06:39 - that I'm going to make
them, I'm going to walk you
06:41 - through learning to code.
06:42 - You will also,
somewhat by accident,
06:45 - learn a little bit about
something called HTML and CSS.
06:53 - HTML and CSS are
the other pieces
06:56 - of the puzzle for making
something appear on a web page.
06:59 - I am going to focus,
focus, focus on JavaScript,
07:02 - and you're not going to see
anything about HTML and CSS
07:04 - for quite a while.
07:05 - But there's these
underlying other mechanics
07:09 - for how content is formatted and
styled to appear on a web page.
07:14 - So while this is not a
web development course--
07:17 - because I don't know anything
about web development--
07:20 - you might by accident learn
to do some web development
07:23 - by taking--
07:24 - well, you're not really
taking this course--
07:25 - but by watching these
videos and following along.
07:28 - All right, so I'm
wrapping up this video.
07:32 - The next video is really where
I'm going to get started.
07:35 - I'm going to show you hey,
this is what you type,
07:37 - and then this is what
happens, and this is why
07:40 - this happens when you type it.
07:41 - And this is what happens
if you type it this way,
07:43 - this breaks it, but
this way fixes it.
07:45 - And we're just going to rinse
and repeat and rinse repeat
07:48 - and do that over and
over again for all
07:50 - the little fundamental
pieces and building
07:52 - blocks of learning to
create your own software.
07:55 - But I want to just show
you a few URLs that you
07:58 - can sort of poke
around and read about
08:01 - before you move on to the next
video, if you're interested.
08:04 - So this is the p5.js website.
08:06 - This is the website that has
a place where you can sort of
08:12 - learn about the p5.js project.
08:14 - This reference page is going to
be very important, because it's
08:17 - the place we're going
to look up, like, "I
08:18 - forgot what this thing does."
08:20 - We're going to look
at the reference page.
08:22 - This learn page has some
additional tutorials
08:25 - that you could look at.
08:26 - There's lots of examples
here that we could
08:28 - click around and play with.
08:30 - I could just click on example,
like Game of Life here,
08:32 - and we could see ah,
this is the code.
08:34 - Ah, what is going on here?
08:36 - This looks crazy.
08:37 - Look at all the syntax
and punctuation and stuff.
08:39 - By the end of this
whole playlist of series
08:41 - this will make, you
know, does it ever
08:44 - make sense to anybody-- looking
at code that you didn't write?
08:47 - I'm not really
sure, but you will
08:48 - start to understand
what the pieces are,
08:50 - what is the process
for building up
08:52 - a particular project like this.
08:54 - And this is a well
known algorithm
08:56 - called the Game of Life.
08:58 - It's a mathematical
algorithm that
08:59 - involves how cells on a grid
turn black or white based
09:04 - on what the other
cells are doing.
09:06 - It is kind of like this
bacterial-like simulation.
09:09 - So oh, there's so
many things we can do.
09:10 - I actually have a
whole video tutorial
09:12 - building this up from scratch
that you could go and find,
09:14 - but stay with me here.
09:16 - So this is the p5.js website.
09:17 - And once again, I want to
mention p5.js was made--
09:20 - actually, one other thing
I want to point out here
09:23 - is I want to go
here on community.
09:27 - P5 has a really wonderful
community statement
09:29 - which is really
important, so I encourage
09:31 - you to go to the p5.js
community statement and read it.
09:35 - P5.js is created by The
Processing Foundation.
09:38 - I'll show you The
Processing Foundation--
09:40 - runs a fellowship program.
09:41 - And here's a whole
lot of people.
09:43 - Lauren McCarthy is the
creator of the p5.js library.
09:47 - You can learn more about how
did this project come about
09:51 - by looking at The Processing
Foundation website.
09:54 - The original Processing
project, which is the Java
09:56 - based platform.
09:57 - If you're looking
for inspiration,
09:58 - I in particular recommend
this exhibition page
10:01 - where you can find really lots
of interesting and beautiful
10:03 - interactive projects
made with code.
10:07 - OK, now here's the part that I'm
so excited about because this
10:13 - is like brand--
10:14 - I mean this is a project
two years in the making,
10:16 - but it's brand new in
terms of its announcement
10:18 - today at the time of
me making this video.
10:20 - The p5.js Web Editor.
10:22 - This is an editor that
you can use and write code
10:30 - in the browser,
save your projects,
10:32 - share your projects with-- look,
there's that Game of Life thing
10:35 - again--
10:37 - without anything.
10:38 - They don't need to
download anything at all.
10:40 - And I'm going to show you how--
10:41 - look, there I am.
10:42 - That's weird.
10:43 - And I'm going to show you
how to use the p5.js Editor
10:47 - while you're learning to code.
10:49 - I do want to mention that
if you are interested in all
10:51 - of the features
of the Web Editor,
10:53 - watch this video by
Cassie Tarakajian.
10:56 - This is not a beginner
programming video,
10:58 - but it's a video
for people who might
11:00 - know a bit about
programming already
11:02 - to see all the things the Web
Editor can do as she walks you
11:05 - through all of the features.
11:08 - Accessibility is a core
feature of the p5 Web Editor.
11:14 - If you are low-vision
or blind, there
11:16 - are a lot of features
built into the Web Editor
11:18 - to allow you to code with it.
11:19 - And Mathura talks
about all the people
11:22 - who contributed to that
effort and those accessibility
11:24 - features in this video.
11:26 - As well as if you
are a teacher and you
11:29 - want to teach with p5, maybe
you want to use these videos
11:32 - or make your own or write
your own curriculum,
11:34 - Saber Khan, who does education
outreach for The Processing
11:37 - Foundation, talks about
that in this video.
11:40 - And I am planning to
make my own series
11:42 - about how to use the p5
Web Editor and Google
11:44 - Classroom together.
11:45 - So if you're interested
it in that, stay tuned.
11:47 - I'll be making a video on that.
11:48 - OK, so now this is
the p5 Web Editor.
11:55 - There it is.
11:56 - So, ooh, look,
this is some code.
11:58 - That doesn't look so bad.
11:59 - Function setup(), what is that?
12:01 - CreateCanvas, what is that?
12:02 - Background(220), what is that?
12:03 - Function draw(), what is that?
12:05 - This is all the
stuff that I'm going
12:07 - to talk about precisely
in the next video.
12:10 - So in the next video,
I'm going to show you
12:12 - what kinds of things
can you type here, what
12:15 - ends up happening over here
when you type them, and why.
12:18 - And we're just going
to go from there.
12:20 - Video after video after
video, adding this piece, then
12:23 - this piece, then this piece.
12:24 - And by the end, you can make
your own interactive animated
12:27 - game, artwork, data
visualization, who knows?
12:31 - You're going to be
much more creative
12:33 - and come up with
something much better
12:34 - than I could possibly
imagine right now.
12:35 - OK, so if you're excited
about that, great.
12:38 - Keep on watching.
12:39 - There's also lots
of other things
12:41 - in the world
besides programming,
12:44 - so you could go
do that stuff too.
12:45 - And especially, like,
being with people
12:46 - and hugging your neighbors
and stuff like that.
12:48 - I think that sounded weird.
12:50 - I didn't mean for
that to sound weird.
12:50 - I'm going to go now.
12:51 - I have to stretch my
hamstrings because I
12:54 - have got some back problems
and that's going to help.
12:56 - Ah, see, I got that in there.
12:57 - All right, see you all
later in the next video.

Cleaned transcript:

[BELL DINGING] Hello. Welcome to the first video in what is a playlist of many, many, many, probably too many videos about learning to code. If you have never written any code before, if you've never programmed before, if you don't know anything about programming, it's my intention for this playlist to be for you. So this is the first introductory video. I'm just going to talk about the pieces of the puzzle that I'm going to use throughout this video series and show you where all those things are and kind of a little bit about the history of those things just to get started in learning to code. Learning to code. You don't have to have know anything, and all you need is a computer with a web browser to follow along. You don't have to download anything, install anything. I'm so excited about that. Now, here's the thing. If you choose today, August 31, 2018 this is the time of the recording. There's many videos that follow this in the playlist. Many of those videos were done a year ago, two years ago, three years ago. They're using the same exact stuff that I'm going to show you, but the screen is going to look a little bit different. So, I'm starting over because there's a new tool that just came out today called the p5.js Web Editor, and it's the tool that I want to use for people following this tutorial series. So the first few videos will have that tool in it, and the rest of the videos are just going to have the same concepts that you could keep using in that editor.

And the way that I'm going to frame that, for the purpose of this course, is all about writing instructions for the computer to draw pictures.

We're going to get the benefit of being able to put our stuff instantly in the web browser, and if some day you discover some of these other tools makes sense for other projects that you would like to learn, this is going to give you a foundation of knowledge for that. In this playlist, in this series and all of the videos that I'm going to make them, I'm going to walk you through learning to code. You will also, somewhat by accident, learn a little bit about something called HTML and CSS. HTML and CSS are the other pieces of the puzzle for making something appear on a web page. I am going to focus, focus, focus on JavaScript, and you're not going to see anything about HTML and CSS for quite a while. But there's these underlying other mechanics for how content is formatted and styled to appear on a web page. So while this is not a web development course because I don't know anything about web development you might by accident learn to do some web development by taking well, you're not really taking this course but by watching these videos and following along. All right, so I'm wrapping up this video. The next video is really where I'm going to get started. I'm going to show you hey, this is what you type, and then this is what happens, and this is why this happens when you type it. And this is what happens if you type it this way, this breaks it, but this way fixes it. And we're just going to rinse and repeat and rinse repeat and do that over and over again for all the little fundamental pieces and building blocks of learning to create your own software. But I want to just show you a few URLs that you can sort of poke around and read about before you move on to the next video, if you're interested. So this is the p5.js website. This is the website that has a place where you can sort of learn about the p5.js project. This reference page is going to be very important, because it's the place we're going to look up, like, "I forgot what this thing does." We're going to look at the reference page. This learn page has some additional tutorials that you could look at. There's lots of examples here that we could click around and play with. I could just click on example, like Game of Life here, and we could see ah, this is the code. Ah, what is going on here? This looks crazy. Look at all the syntax and punctuation and stuff. By the end of this whole playlist of series this will make, you know, does it ever make sense to anybody looking at code that you didn't write? I'm not really sure, but you will start to understand what the pieces are, what is the process for building up a particular project like this. And this is a well known algorithm called the Game of Life. It's a mathematical algorithm that involves how cells on a grid turn black or white based on what the other cells are doing. It is kind of like this bacteriallike simulation. So oh, there's so many things we can do. I actually have a whole video tutorial building this up from scratch that you could go and find, but stay with me here. So this is the p5.js website. And once again, I want to mention p5.js was made actually, one other thing I want to point out here is I want to go here on community. P5 has a really wonderful community statement which is really important, so I encourage you to go to the p5.js community statement and read it. P5.js is created by The Processing Foundation. I'll show you The Processing Foundation runs a fellowship program. And here's a whole lot of people. Lauren McCarthy is the creator of the p5.js library. You can learn more about how did this project come about by looking at The Processing Foundation website. The original Processing project, which is the Java based platform. If you're looking for inspiration, I in particular recommend this exhibition page where you can find really lots of interesting and beautiful interactive projects made with code. OK, now here's the part that I'm so excited about because this is like brand I mean this is a project two years in the making, but it's brand new in terms of its announcement today at the time of me making this video. The p5.js Web Editor. This is an editor that you can use and write code in the browser, save your projects, share your projects with look, there's that Game of Life thing again without anything. They don't need to download anything at all. And I'm going to show you how look, there I am. That's weird. And I'm going to show you how to use the p5.js Editor while you're learning to code. I do want to mention that if you are interested in all of the features of the Web Editor, watch this video by Cassie Tarakajian. This is not a beginner programming video, but it's a video for people who might know a bit about programming already to see all the things the Web Editor can do as she walks you through all of the features. Accessibility is a core feature of the p5 Web Editor. If you are lowvision or blind, there are a lot of features built into the Web Editor to allow you to code with it. And Mathura talks about all the people who contributed to that effort and those accessibility features in this video. As well as if you are a teacher and you want to teach with p5, maybe you want to use these videos or make your own or write your own curriculum, Saber Khan, who does education outreach for The Processing Foundation, talks about that in this video. And I am planning to make my own series about how to use the p5 Web Editor and Google Classroom together. So if you're interested it in that, stay tuned. I'll be making a video on that. OK, so now this is the p5 Web Editor. There it is. So, ooh, look, this is some code. That doesn't look so bad. Function setup(), what is that? CreateCanvas, what is that? Background(220), what is that? Function draw(), what is that? This is all the stuff that I'm going to talk about precisely in the next video. So in the next video, I'm going to show you what kinds of things can you type here, what ends up happening over here when you type them, and why. And we're just going to go from there. Video after video after video, adding this piece, then this piece, then this piece. And by the end, you can make your own interactive animated game, artwork, data visualization, who knows? You're going to be much more creative and come up with something much better than I could possibly imagine right now. OK, so if you're excited about that, great. Keep on watching. There's also lots of other things in the world besides programming, so you could go do that stuff too. And especially, like, being with people and hugging your neighbors and stuff like that. I think that sounded weird. I didn't mean for that to sound weird. I'm going to go now. I have to stretch my hamstrings because I have got some back problems and that's going to help. Ah, see, I got that in there. All right, see you all later in the next video. [BELL DINGING] [MUSIC PLAYING]
