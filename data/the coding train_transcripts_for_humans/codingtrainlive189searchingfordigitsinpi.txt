03:36 - check 1 2 3 sorry about that I didn't
03:39 - realize I had the volume down very low
03:41 - this is my sound check of my voice how
03:44 - are the levels can you hear me and is
03:48 - the balance between me and the get
03:51 - started in just about 2 or 3 minutes

06:33 - hello happy is a Thursday I am really
06:37 - having trouble keeping track of what day
06:38 - it is
06:39 - welcome to the coding train with me your
06:43 - host Dan I'll just take a deep breath
06:48 - just take a big deep breath together
06:49 - ready I don't know where you're watching
06:55 - from this from where in the world you're
06:58 - watching this I don't know what your
06:59 - circumstances are what you did what time
07:02 - of day it is what you did this morning
07:03 - this afternoon at night how you slept
07:05 - any of those things but all in all I
07:08 - would just like to know how are you
07:10 - doing are you doing okay I am based in
07:13 - New York City specifically in Brooklyn
07:15 - New York it has been quite a week of
07:17 - chaos here if not a month or a year or
07:22 - the last however many years whoever you
07:24 - want to get started do you hear that
07:26 - noise by the way I want to talk about
07:27 - that noise in a second but things are a
07:33 - little quite in flux in the city here
07:36 - specifically where I work where my day
07:38 - job is at New York University do you
07:42 - hear that sound I would like to know
07:45 - maybe you can't hear it hmm I'm gonna
07:49 - wait for that sound to finish but by the
07:51 - way that is literally the sound of
07:53 - somebody washing their hands and I'm not
07:54 - kidding just you know there's a lot of I
07:58 - don't know irony or humor there you
08:01 - gotta have a sense of humor sometimes
08:02 - though it's important to take things
08:03 - seriously and follow science or now Noah
08:06 - dancing around the topic that is on my
08:09 - mind which is what's going on with
08:11 - coronavirus and specifically New York
08:13 - City and New York University so nobody's
08:17 - saying they can hear that sound oh yeah
08:18 - I hear it says DT six let me address
08:21 - that a second so New York University has
08:26 - cancelled all in-person classes and
08:28 - events and meetings there's a lot of
08:30 - other changes going on in the city of
08:31 - New York itself this has caused a lot of
08:34 - us who work at NYU to have to change our
08:37 - daily routines to revamp our curriculum
08:39 - to think about different things I am a
08:41 - person as you might have noticed who
08:43 - happens to do a lot of online education
08:45 - Edel adjacent stuff on the internet so
08:48 - in many ways I am set up well to engage
08:53 - in experiment with remote education but
08:56 - I would say that I think it is something
08:59 - very different to be caring for and
09:02 - teach at caring for a class a cohort of
09:06 - whether it's six students or eight or 12
09:08 - or 16 or 20 or 50 or a hundred even
09:10 - which is quite different than this sort
09:13 - of live-streaming thing on YouTube there
09:15 - are relationships and the things I do on
09:17 - this channel I hope are resources to
09:20 - people who are teaching courses that
09:21 - they can create their community their
09:24 - local community of their course around
09:25 - but I do think it's it's a I want to be
09:29 - careful about suggesting that oh it's
09:33 - time to do remote education that's a
09:35 - thing that I do already it's not I do a
09:38 - kind of remote education and maybe a lot
09:41 - of it's filled with like way too much
09:42 - nonsense but
09:46 - but yes so I don't want to I don't want
09:48 - to belabor this story there is a huge
09:51 - amount of stuff to say on it I am not
09:53 - qualified to prognosticate and predict
09:56 - the future I'm just kind of working with
09:57 - what I need to do today and I think
10:00 - actually some of the changes that are
10:01 - happening based on looking at reducing
10:04 - the spread of the virus will probably
10:06 - ultimately open up a lot more time for
10:08 - me to livestream or make video tutorials
10:10 - but actually what's happened to me this
10:12 - week is I'm having a lot less time
10:13 - because there's a lot of things that
10:15 - need to be changed I'm spinning up
10:16 - actually a couple new classes for NYU
10:20 - there's just a lot of meetings and not
10:23 - to mention like my son's school closed
10:25 - he's actually having classes with zoom
10:28 - software at home he's in fifth grade and
10:31 - so you know I don't have to be there
10:32 - with him right now because I have that
10:33 - covered but that's it's a the puzzle
10:35 - pieces my daughter school is still open
10:36 - but the puzzle pieces of family and all
10:39 - that kind of stuff are become enormous
10:40 - ly complicated but I wasn't minted
10:43 - managed to stick to having a live stream
10:45 - today I started about a half an hour
10:46 - earlier than I originally intended and I
10:48 - have to leave
10:49 - absolutely 100% at 3:30 which is now
10:53 - about one hour and 50 minutes if I can
10:56 - still do math on some level loud think I
11:00 - want that noise to happen again so
11:02 - bizarrely I was in here the other day I
11:04 - actually was making a quick video
11:06 - tutorial for how to do video
11:07 - conferencing with zoom which I might try
11:09 - to do some more of that on the channel
11:10 - itself but it was loud noise and I
11:14 - thought you know we did shop there's
11:16 - something sorry I hit the Bell by
11:18 - accident there's a wood shop over there
11:20 - and I thought it's weird that I never
11:22 - hear the wood shop and all of a sudden
11:23 - I'm hearing it today so I'm drilling and
11:25 - I heard it again and hurt again and oh
11:26 - maybe there's a construction going on
11:28 - this building Mabel's construction then
11:31 - uh later I was like I need to you know
11:35 - go to the bathroom do it number one I
11:37 - need to wash my hands I need to wash my
11:39 - head a lot so I went in to wash my hands
11:42 - burn when the water comes out for it so
11:45 - right now during this live stream if we
11:49 - hear the sound bar I mean somebody's
11:52 - washing their hands and we should
11:53 - applaud them applaud them for washing
11:55 - your hands for not touching your face
12:00 - now it could be something we could code
12:01 - today a hand face detector but I don't
12:04 - want to be do - I don't want to make
12:05 - light of what is an incredibly
12:07 - complicated and difficult and
12:10 - life-changing for many people situation
12:13 - right now
12:14 - so that's all I have to say about that
12:16 - I'm going to move on to back to my sort
12:20 - of like usual programming which is a lot
12:22 - of this stuff
12:33 - with today's episode of the coding train
12:35 - you have 1/2 day early pi day thing ok
12:48 - whoa this is getting warm in here
12:50 - oh good touched my face all right uh we
13:00 - should let us let us now also transition
13:03 - to reading the ceremonial book of random
13:08 - numbers things are a little ominous
13:18 - these days so we're gonna have to do it
13:21 - [Music]
13:26 - forty-nine thousand five hundred
13:27 - fourteen fifty six thousand nine hundred
13:30 - seventy seven sixty one thousand ninety
13:34 - one okay oh boy Friday the 13th is
13:43 - tomorrow okay you know I did I already
13:46 - probably told my Friday the 13th story
13:48 - when I was a little young lad along last
13:52 - lassie laddie whatever whatever is you
13:54 - say that I had a boo boo boo bad boo boo
13:59 - on harder than 30 I don't want diarrhea
14:01 - no live stream from a year or two years
14:03 - ago somebody will find me so um this
14:08 - Saturday is March 14th also known as pi
14:11 - day 4 3 3 1 for being the 3.14 being the
14:15 - first digits of pi i off I have in the
14:18 - past done a live stream on pi day I
14:20 - actually was supposed to travel this
14:22 - weekend I am no longer traveling this
14:23 - weekend that trip was canceled so but I
14:27 - don't know what I'll be doing yet this
14:29 - weekend and I I almost am sure I won't
14:32 - be physically here in this building on
14:35 - Saturday so no Pi Day livestream unless
14:37 - I spend something up from home or
14:39 - something like that but I thought what I
14:40 - would do today is a coding challenge
14:43 - related to PI so it would happen
14:46 - today during this live stream in the
14:48 - next hour and 45 minutes or so and then
14:52 - machiya and I would work in the next 24
14:55 - hours or so to edit it down to it's sort
14:57 - of like core essential components which
15:00 - would then be released as the pi day
15:02 - coding challenge on Saturday so that is
15:05 - my plan so that's what happened today
15:09 - now either some people been asking the
15:10 - thumbnail it says things like OBS basics
15:13 - another see chapter 3 because I guess
15:15 - turday and I woke up this morning I was
15:16 - like I want to talk about live-streaming
15:18 - and how I could use open broadcast
15:19 - studio record a lecture and I'm a nature
15:22 - of code I'm gonna be in chapter 3 so I
15:23 - could do a little bit on nature of CO
15:25 - chapter 3 the time the time the time the
15:27 - time it got compressed I do want to
15:29 - really think about and maybe come back
15:31 - next week and focus on are there a set
15:34 - of tutorials that I can do to help
15:37 - teachers specifically who might be who
15:44 - who might be doing remote learning might
15:47 - want to record a video lecture are there
15:48 - things that I that that I can make some
15:52 - content about to help people so
15:54 - specifically if you're a teacher and
15:55 - there's like a thing I would love to
15:57 - hear from you or if you have ideas for
15:59 - me let me know and maybe next week you
16:02 - know a lot of a lot of the what people
16:05 - are doing with remote learning is
16:06 - real-time interaction and questions and
16:08 - feedback and smaller groups and that's
16:10 - not something that I really actually
16:12 - have a lot of experience with when I
16:13 - have experience together this much more
16:14 - like one-way broadcast although it there
16:17 - is sometimes like a chat and different
16:19 - things but but I would like to offer
16:25 - some resources one resource I do want to
16:27 - mention let me just try to find it for a
16:31 - second because there have been a lot of
16:34 - people putting together just hold off
16:38 - sometimes I can't talk and search
16:42 - by the way I have a question my kids say
16:45 - search it up like who who won the World
16:50 - Series in 1967 hey Dad just search it up
16:55 - is that a thing do people say search it
16:59 - up or did they invent Sega search it up
17:01 - and now it's a thing that people are
17:03 - gonna say because I'm telling you you
17:04 - could say search it up today Kenny it's
17:06 - sketchy trust me but maybe it's already
17:08 - a thing and I'm an old old Internet man
17:11 - who just says I will search for it but
17:15 - now I'm gonna say search it up I'm
17:17 - searching something up and I can't
17:18 - concentrate well on sir did it up
17:20 - [Music]
17:46 - [Music]
18:07 - I'm doing I don't have my password
18:11 - looking it up searching it up
18:16 - [Music]
18:31 - [Music]
19:03 - [Music]
19:23 - okay I found what I was looking for I
19:25 - searched it up alright so this is a lot
19:28 - of people been putting together
19:29 - resources and there's a slack channel
19:32 - that I know exactly Berman had put
19:34 - together for people teaching online in
19:37 - the age of Cova 19 but Melanie Hoff who
19:41 - is one of the organizers of code
19:43 - societies at school for Porter
19:44 - competition and alum of the ITP program
19:46 - and if you don't if you don't know her
19:48 - work you should check out her work but
19:50 - she put together this really excellent
19:51 - arena compilation of all sorts of
19:55 - resources for people who are teaching
19:57 - online so I just wanted to highlight
20:02 - that you can find it at arena slash
20:04 - Melanie - hoff slash teaching online so
20:07 - I would like to come back and add and
20:12 - and maybe if there's time left over at
20:13 - the end I will answer some questions
20:15 - some nice questions came in on Twitter
20:17 - and maybe next week I can make this the
20:19 - subject of an entire live stream but
20:21 - today I will be doing my PI day
20:26 - challenge
20:32 - [Music]
20:35 - Oh Oh silly me
20:40 - [Music]
20:43 - silly me the thing that I'm searching up
20:47 - is available playlists no private liked
20:56 - videos
20:58 - I gotta search it up
21:26 - okay the other thing I want to mention
21:28 - is that I am deep into whoops whoops
21:36 - that shouldn't say one it should say why
21:39 - I got to fix this I can fix this I'm
21:42 - working on a entirely new set of nature
21:45 - of code videos in JavaScript with p5
21:48 - these are renewed urgency Ruiz that I
21:52 - made almost eight years ago at this
21:54 - point or actually eight years ago and so
21:56 - if you're new to the channel expect a
22:00 - lot of new videos to come out related to
22:03 - this you can actually see they're all
22:04 - there already so if the video has a
22:07 - thumbnail that kind of all that means as
22:09 - well a thumbnail was made a description
22:12 - is there I made sure the code is online
22:13 - it's linked but if you want to kind of
22:16 - get ahead you can see all of these
22:18 - videos are there and then the forces of
22:21 - the chapter two has started as well so
22:23 - one thing that I want to say about these
22:25 - videos that some of them are unlisted
22:26 - and some of them are listed especially
22:28 - if a video is unlisted and there's a
22:30 - significant mistake or issue with it
22:31 - please let me know because if it's
22:33 - unlisted it's very easy for me to delete
22:36 - and re-upload a fixed version if it -
22:38 - already published video it's harder for
22:40 - me to do that but if there's a real
22:41 - significant issue I will do that okay
22:53 - I'm also gonna have to sing oh my
22:57 - ukulele tuners battery is gone
23:02 - we have to do some pi day singing maybe
23:04 - today eating of some pie who knows I'm
23:09 - out of sorts people out of sorts I
23:14 - searched it up but I couldn't find it
23:18 - Chris ray asks are you going to remake
23:20 - genetic algorithm chapter uh not
23:24 - probably no you know no I don't think so
23:30 - so the genetic album chapter is actually
23:35 - something that I revisited more recently
23:37 - so there might be some added videos or I
23:40 - might swap in and out a new version of
23:42 - one of those videos but for the most
23:43 - part that's going to be can stay what I
23:46 - made a couple years ago but I do have
23:48 - some ideas for some additional ones all
23:49 - right so the first thing that I want to
23:53 - do is I want to find myself a text file
23:56 - with 1 million digits of hi let's try
24:03 - this this is good 1 million digits of pi
24:15 - just going to have to trust that this
24:18 - file is correct let's put it on the
24:22 - desktop and I want to find a 1 billion 1
24:30 - billion digits of pi I don't think I
24:40 - want to try with twenty two point four
24:42 - trillion that would be nice
24:43 - tied at 1.5 billion this looks like it
24:49 - might be good oh here we go
24:50 - PI billion this is gonna be a much
24:54 - larger file right is gonna download it
25:00 - effectively let's do it this way
25:06 - okay this file is almost a gigabyte and
25:11 - I have about two minutes left to
25:12 - download it ok
25:14 - ah recording two-disc time start
25:20 - recording and multi quarter I am NOT
25:26 - going to record to disk the whiteboard
25:30 - view which I think you are now seeing
25:31 - I'm not I don't have my preview up
25:33 - anymore because I keep moving things
25:34 - around and here we are over here okay
25:49 - let's see does the whiteboard actually
25:51 - working it is there it looks pretty
25:53 - crooked to me I'm like skip using the
25:55 - whiteboard today we'll see so this is my
25:58 - plan so fathom information design
26:03 - - org maybe no oppai de fathom comm
26:08 - probably no all right fine fathom pie
26:15 - pecan pie dot info fathom dot info / pie
26:20 - this is where we are hi I am dot info
26:23 - and in case I did forget which I did
26:27 - forget lend me also before I get started
26:29 - coding say thank you to glean org the
26:31 - sponsor of today's coding train live
26:34 - stream I will so brilliant is a
26:37 - wonderful website and app and all sorts
26:40 - of where you can learn a lot of stuff
26:43 - and by the way if you need to learn
26:45 - things remotely these days this is a
26:47 - really good tool for you to use but they
26:49 - have some new courses that I'm excited
26:51 - to share with you and I always have a
26:52 - daily challenge I always love to do
26:54 - brilliants daily challenge and that's
26:57 - something that I will be attempting
26:59 - about halfway through this livestream
27:01 - okay now and if it wasn't clear if you
27:07 - want to take a look at brilliant go to
27:09 - brilliant dot org slash coding train and
27:12 - that will let them know that you found
27:16 - this from from here and it will also get
27:18 - you a 20% off even you can sign up for
27:20 - free but if you're interested in the
27:21 - premium subscription you can get 20% off
27:24 - through that URL the first 200 people to
27:26 - do so
27:27 - okay so I want to make my own yeah Thank
27:35 - You Simon so though I know that's one of
27:37 - the reasons why I don't want to use the
27:38 - whiteboard today there's something going
27:40 - on with the lighting in this room
27:53 - what I am interested in attempting to do
27:56 - is make my own version of this wonderful
28:00 - peek inside pi web application that was
28:05 - created by fathom information design and
28:09 - so if you don't know about fathom it's a
28:11 - wonderful design firm cuffs started by
28:13 - Ben Frey who is one of the creators of
28:15 - processing itself and so here what I can
28:18 - do is I can look for any sequence of
28:20 - digits and find where they occur in PI
28:24 - so I'm gonna type 1 4 and we're gonna
28:28 - see if there they are it's the first
28:30 - digit of pi and so if I keep searching
28:32 - there we go but use their 1 4 1 5 9 but
28:35 - instead of 2 1 4 1 5 9 6 and it was
28:42 - found as the 731 thousand of thousands
28:46 - 406 digit of pi so this is good for us
28:49 - to find because I now want to recreate
28:52 - this exact thing I'm going to load in a
28:55 - file with 1 million digits of pi and
28:57 - then I want to create an interface where
28:59 - I type this in I'm gonna have to say all
29:01 - this again but I'm getting myself set up
29:04 - because I'm gonna do that I'm gonna want
29:06 - to create an interface where I type this
29:07 - in and I want to find where if that
29:09 - sequence exists in the number of digits
29:11 - of pi that I have and if so where and
29:13 - while I'm going to this in JavaScript
29:16 - while I could just use the built in
29:19 - index of function I'm going to write my
29:22 - own search in a string algorithm because
29:25 - um once I get to 1 billion digits am I
29:30 - going to run into performance issues and
29:33 - so here it is this was one of the spy
29:38 - day suggestions and in this suggestion
29:45 - there's also another website I think
29:47 - that's actually where I downloaded the
29:48 - digits from it looks like but there's
29:50 - also other algorithms one known as Boyer
29:52 - Moore which I actually have never heard
29:55 - of until I saw it posted which may be
29:58 - which optimizes this kind of brute-force
30:00 - search so I don't know if I'm gonna have
30:02 - time to actually implement this
30:04 - and yeah hash and yes is asking that's
30:08 - crazy you can't load this PI file into
30:13 - the browser correct so I will be using a
30:16 - node server once I get to the 1 billion
30:17 - digits ok so this is the plan and I'm
30:24 - gonna I would like this to be all one
30:26 - video so all of that explanation
30:28 - unfortunately for you the live viewer
30:30 - I'm going to kind of read start
30:33 - hopefully say it more succinctly and
30:36 - then just get to coding and hopefully
30:38 - I'll be done by an hour and a half from
30:40 - now take a short break about a half an
30:42 - hour 45 minutes from now and then this
30:47 - will get edited and put together into a
30:48 - video to be published on Saturday any
30:52 - questions so many questions ok
31:08 - what start this over
31:11 - got my p5 sketch peak in PI 1 billion
31:21 - digits PI search page
31:28 - [Music]
31:35 - I take challenge all right
31:46 - okay um I think I'm ready
31:55 - bill hem is asking why is he not using
31:58 - processing for this good good point good
32:07 - question I could use processing for this
32:10 - I feel like using the browser so I could
32:12 - do this in processing I could do that as
32:14 - a follow-up video I'll mention it that's
32:15 - it that's actually a great question
32:20 - [Applause]
32:45 - okay mmm here we go shake it up shake it
32:58 - off shake a wee little we got happy pi
33:11 - day welcome to today is this year's
33:14 - 2020s coding train pi coding challenge
33:17 - and i thank you to fatima Bemis who
33:20 - suggested this idea find a sequence in
33:23 - pi so this is the challenge I'm going to
33:25 - take on for this year's Pi Day I'm
33:28 - saying the same thing many many times I
33:30 - get one chance to start over one time I
33:32 - get to start over now used I I used the
33:45 - ukulele last year this will be more just
33:47 - coding coding coding okay hi day hello
34:07 - welcome to 2020 pi day coding challenge
34:10 - thing that I'm about to do oh I really
34:17 - got to get going because if I keep
34:19 - restarting this we're gonna be a big
34:21 - trouble because I have to no matter what
34:22 - leave at 3:30
34:23 - there's no and I mean when I say 3:30 I
34:26 - mean I mean so I should really be saying
34:28 - three I really gotta leave by 3:30 okay
34:32 - happy pi day it's 2020 this year's pi
34:36 - day it's today and I would like to do
34:38 - it's not really today cuz I'm recording
34:40 - this couple days early but I would like
34:42 - you to see this on pi day a coding
34:44 - challenge themed around the number pi
34:46 - and thank you to fatin Bibi's who
34:49 - suggested this one pi day
34:51 - find a sequence in pi issue number one
34:53 - for 64
34:55 - if those numbers are where they are in
34:57 - PI who will find out by the end of this
34:59 - video how to look at how one might
35:02 - search for any given sequence of numbers
35:04 - in PI this can lead to a lot of other
35:06 - things like what if those numbers were
35:08 - encoded as music or what if music was
35:10 - encoded as numbers or if you took a text
35:13 - a message and encoded those numbers
35:15 - could you find secret messages in PI
35:17 - melodic phrases in PI there's so many
35:19 - creative possibilities that you could
35:21 - create from my code I'm gonna do
35:23 - something really really basic now I'm in
35:25 - this suggestion this particular website
35:27 - I'm an geonet slash pi is mentioned it
35:30 - has a bunch of different resources a
35:32 - resource of where you can download all
35:34 - the digits of pi a place to search for
35:36 - pi but i this this whoops and it point
35:43 - edit point this is what's going to be
35:45 - edited out it'll be funny if we actually
35:47 - keep that in c ah meta meta
35:54 - this all reminded me of a wonderful
35:57 - project from fathom information design
35:59 - so if you don't know about fathom their
36:01 - information design firm based in
36:04 - Cambridge Massachusetts founded by Ben
36:07 - Ben Frey who was one of the creators of
36:09 - processing itself can find out more at
36:11 - fathom dot info but they created this
36:13 - project peek inside Pi which you can
36:15 - play with at PI fathom info there's also
36:18 - an app version a lot of the versions
36:20 - I'll link to all those things in the
36:21 - video's description so the idea here is
36:23 - that I can type I could tap can I tap
36:31 - let's see if I can fake it looks no the
36:44 - point is for any given sequence like one
36:47 - four one five nine look I can search for
36:51 - it right here and there it is it's found
36:53 - at the first digit of pi so now let's
36:56 - pick another sequence like what's a
36:59 - wonderful sequence it is today's date is
37:01 - March 14 2020 and that is not in the
37:06 - first 1 million digits of pi ah
37:08 - if
37:09 - we had more digits I must have more
37:11 - digits so this particular web app is
37:13 - searching through the first 1 million
37:14 - digits of pi and that's what I want to
37:16 - create first let's just try this so the
37:18 - number 0 3 oops 0 3 1 4 2 oh 2 is
37:22 - available is found
37:28 - Simon's Simon's Simons
37:31 - interrupting my flow you're interrupting
37:33 - my flow with all the at mentions we all
37:36 - the only really urgent at mentions
37:38 - please but he doesn't Simon does have a
37:41 - great suggestion did it to do good
37:49 - [Music]
37:51 - I'm told that I should search for the
37:56 - number nine nine nine nine nine nine
38:00 - which is the 760 second digit of pi so
38:05 - let's remember that and make sure when I
38:07 - write my own version of this that I find
38:10 - the same digit so I'm gonna do this at
38:12 - Fir I'm gonna do this with p5.js
38:13 - JavaScript the browser I'm it's not
38:14 - gonna be as nicely designed with a
38:16 - beautiful interface like this but I'm
38:17 - first going to recreate this exact thing
38:19 - and then and then what I'm gonna do is
38:24 - I'm gonna go from 1 million digits to 1
38:27 - billion digits and see if I could still
38:29 - search for edge in PI and probably I'm
38:30 - gonna fail because we're gonna need some
38:32 - kind of like optimization it's gonna
38:33 - only run to slow everything's gonna come
38:35 - crashing down but I'm gonna try
38:36 - nonetheless
38:36 - and we'll see where we get to by the end
38:38 - of this video and I should mention just
38:40 - in case I don't end up covering it
38:42 - there are optimal ways to search for a
38:46 - string to search for a string inside of
38:49 - a larger string and one of those
38:50 - algorithms called the boy or more
38:51 - algorithm and so depending on where I
38:53 - get I would get to the end of this video
38:55 - I don't know why I'm talking about this
38:57 - now it's not the end I'll know where
38:58 - I've gotten to
39:00 - [Music]
39:01 - depending on where I get to that might
39:05 - be something that you could also do as
39:07 - your own as a contribution when I know
39:10 - that could also be something that you do
39:12 - as your own contribution on the coding
39:14 - train com itself by making a optimized
39:16 - version of this alright
39:24 - okay here we go
39:43 - let me just put this in applications
39:56 - I'm starting with a simple p5 sketch and
40:00 - two text files one with 1 billion digits
40:04 - of pi which is just a megabyte and one
40:06 - with 1 billion digits of pi which is a
40:09 - gigabyte that's a much bigger file so
40:11 - let's start with the one megabyte file
40:27 - I've uploaded it I've uploaded that file
40:33 - to the p5 web editor and I can load all
40:35 - the text from that file right now using
40:38 - preload
41:00 - I'm going to just take away animation
41:03 - here I'm going to get rid of the draw
41:04 - loop and I'm gonna say no canvas and
41:11 - then the file itself has all of the
41:15 - digits of pi in one line buttload
41:18 - strings loads text files into an array
41:21 - with each element of the array being a
41:23 - different line of the text file so what
41:25 - I'm going to do here is create a
41:26 - variable called digits and just say it
41:28 - is the first element in that raw data
41:32 - array let's console.log digits and just
41:37 - see what happens
41:41 - okay so all of the digits of pi are down
41:44 - here in the console now what I want to
41:46 - do is search for a given digit let's
41:48 - make an interface a very very crude
41:50 - simple interface for searching
42:03 - so now I have this tiny tiny search box
42:07 - up here can I make that bigger this is
42:10 - one of the things I hate give me a
42:12 - second here this is one thing I don't
42:16 - love about using the web editor because
42:20 - can i zoom an iframe can I just make
42:23 - that bigger can I do it with the CSS I
42:26 - don't want to go crazy here if I do
42:30 - something like just say what is it like
42:33 - text size or something I don't know CSS
42:36 - somebody tell me how to put some global
42:38 - CSS font size okay no that seem to work
42:47 - but I didn't make the text file do I
42:49 - need to do it for like input
42:57 - hey there we go perfect that's probably
43:03 - bigger than I need there we go that's
43:09 - plenty visible now okay
43:16 - I also just added a like I also just
43:22 - increased the font size for any input
43:23 - element on the page so it's a little
43:25 - easier for you to see but that's you
43:27 - know the interaction that I'm looking
43:37 - for is anytime anyone types anything
43:41 - into that search box I want to look for
43:43 - that string that that those digits in PI
43:45 - itself and p5 GS has a special event
44:02 - function called input which you can call
44:05 - on the search box and pass another
44:07 - function that will be executed anytime a
44:11 - change has been made so let me write
44:13 - that search it up function because
44:14 - that's when I was looking for something
44:16 - I say search it up and then I'm going to
44:25 - be a little silly and make these global
44:27 - variables
44:36 - and I'm going to then then let me get
44:43 - what I'm searching for
44:49 - from the search box and console.log that
44:54 - so now whenever I type anything into
44:57 - that search box I should see what I type
44:59 - here in the console and that's working
45:13 - this is gonna actually be a really easy
45:15 - project to do you know why because I
45:18 - could just use the index of function in
45:20 - JavaScript to tell let me do that real
45:21 - quick just please please guys real quick
45:23 - I'll bet you that real quick digits
45:29 - index of search so this is saying look
45:33 - inside this search string and give me
45:35 - back the index of where oh no no this is
45:41 - saying look inside the long string
45:43 - digits and give me the index of wherever
45:45 - this string search happens to appear if
45:48 - it doesn't appear I'll take a negative
45:50 - one please so I'm gonna say create let's
45:54 - make another element on the page
46:10 - and
46:31 - No
46:37 - how do I make that people I don't know
46:44 - CSS at all help me out here the leaf
46:49 - it's making it red when it's wrong font
46:51 - color no color should be collar right I
46:57 - mean I could make a background color
46:59 - that I know will work no oh this is
47:08 - wrong
47:08 - oh I need another that's a wrong number
47:11 - of digits I'm the worst
47:13 - I'm the worst there we go okay yeah just
47:21 - don't
47:35 - so now when I get that index back I can
47:38 - say index P dot HTML that index which
47:41 - will put the actual index where it's
47:43 - found in the paragraph text there on the
47:45 - webpage so for example if I say one four
47:48 - one five nine hmm why does it think two
47:52 - so really when counting the digits of pi
47:54 - what seems to be the convention is the
47:57 - first digit is the first digit after the
47:59 - period so it's three point the first
48:01 - digit is one so I should really say
48:04 - index minus one and now one four one
48:07 - five nine I got one and then what if I
48:11 - say nein nein nein nein nein nein I got
48:15 - 200 all right so we got it man nine nine
48:20 - ninety-nine appears at the 760 second
48:23 - digit in pi
48:31 - I'm also going to write a little if
48:33 - statement here say if index is greater
48:36 - than well I guess if I'm looking for
48:40 - three if that's a bug so if I'm looking
48:45 - for three that's a zero which minus one
48:47 - how do I do I want to handle that bug
48:52 - index of must let me start searching
48:54 - from a certain character right
49:06 - start from index - great
49:20 - so if it's a three I don't want it to
49:22 - find that zero digit so I'm gonna start
49:25 - searching from index to and there oops
49:32 - great so I guess I hope that's right but
49:34 - a 3a doesn't appear until
49:40 - [Applause]
49:52 - the chat is also rightfully pointing out
49:55 - that I could just chop off the first two
49:57 - digits of the string it would be much
49:59 - too easy I'm gonna do it this way so I'm
50:01 - gonna start from looking at digit two
50:03 - and I'm going to say as long as index is
50:09 - greater than zero set that otherwise say
50:14 - I'm going to say
50:36 - otherwise I'll put a message about it
50:39 - not being found okay so let's try one
50:43 - four one five nine nine nine nine nine
50:45 - nine nine not found so I now have
50:49 - essentially without the care and thought
50:52 - into the interaction design the visual
50:55 - design the layout of the page all of
50:57 - those elements recreated my my own
51:00 - version of this peek inside by I got
51:06 - this videos not over them I got two more
51:08 - things I want to do number one is I want
51:11 - to just investigate what does it mean
51:14 - for me to actually perform this search
51:17 - myself to write my own index of function
51:20 - because maybe if I do that might unlock
51:23 - some other creative possibilities and
51:26 - also I might learn something about
51:27 - programming and then once I do that let
51:31 - me increase things up to 1 billion
51:33 - digits and see if this still works which
51:36 - it won't and I'm reading the chat I
51:52 - shouldn't be reading the chat let me
51:54 - increase things to 1 billion it's and
51:57 - see what happens what breaks down once I
51:59 - have a 1 gigabyte file that I'm loading
52:01 - all the digits of pi in as opposed to 8
52:03 - 1 megabyte file right so let's first
52:05 - write our own index of function so I'm
52:08 - just going to change them to comic this
52:09 - out and I'm going to say let index
52:13 - equals index of a search in this string
52:17 - for this search string okay
52:20 - so search in the string digits for the
52:22 - string search
52:42 - and so the function looks like this it's
52:44 - named as an ex uh it needs to receive a
52:46 - block of text and the substring that
52:48 - you're searching for in that text okay
52:57 - I'm thinking about this let's say we do
53:13 - this let's start with what's the first
53:18 - character in the search string then I
53:30 - want to iterate over the entire string
53:33 - of text and say hey does this character
53:39 - in the entire string of text match the
53:43 - first character of the search string
53:54 - if so I need another loop with J
54:00 - starting at I plus one well actually
54:04 - let's do it this way
54:06 - let's bending to loop through all of the
54:11 - characters of that search string I don't
54:18 - have an error here bad assignment
54:30 - Oh
54:32 - they supposed to say four so I don't
54:36 - need to start at zero because I've
54:38 - already checked to make sure that's zero
54:40 - and I want to check is text car at I
54:44 - plus J the same as search car at J again
54:51 - I'm I'm not worrying about running this
54:54 - optimally or elegantly I just want to
54:56 - get the core idea out I'm starting with
54:59 - and I really should use the whiteboard
55:01 - for this do I dare a whiteboard is all
55:09 - like weird and shadowy this light for
55:11 - there's like a nice bright light that's
55:13 - always been in this room that is very
55:14 - dim today
55:28 - is it - oh you can't even see that
55:30 - that's of sad
55:49 - 3.14159 let's say I'm looking for the
55:53 - string for one five
56:07 - so in the example and building this is
56:10 - the text let me just start over okay
56:27 - that person is I feel like a water they
56:30 - should be riding the water a little bit
56:32 - longer I would kind of short what comes
56:46 - after the nine people is it - I hope
56:50 - it's - so let's say this is my text and
56:56 - what I'm looking for is I want to find
56:59 - out where is 4 1 5 in that particular
57:03 - string this is my search sorry my watch
57:07 - is buzzing at me and I am going to turn
57:11 - that off okay okay uh I'm a jolly happy
57:21 - person I'm not actually bothered by
57:23 - anything I just like to play act okay so
57:29 - this is my text and this is my search
57:31 - string what I have going on here is I
57:33 - know the first character of what I'm
57:35 - searching for is four so I the index I
57:39 - is starting here and looking is that for
57:41 - as that four is that four is that four
57:42 - aha this is for now let's let's save our
57:46 - let's save this spot and then based on
57:48 - this length three which let's let's
57:51 - iterate over this length with J zero one
57:53 - two and let's add j2i zero one two and
57:57 - see if all those digits continue to
58:00 - match
58:26 - okay so ultimately really what I'm
58:32 - looking for here is any things any of
58:35 - those digits that aren't the same so I
58:37 - really want to look for first I'm gonna
58:39 - be very strict about this and use the
58:40 - triple equals there's a funny thing in
58:42 - JavaScript if you haven't encountered
58:43 - this before where if I use double equals
58:49 - this will return true but if I use
58:52 - triple equals they won't so it's a
58:54 - little like double equals is a little
58:55 - bit of a fuzzier truth and triple equals
58:57 - like no no no no those things are really
58:59 - really really really equal fuzzy or
59:01 - equals I guess I don't know if that's
59:04 - necessary to explain I can probably edit
59:05 - that out and then I'm going to say not
59:08 - equals so basically I'm I'm going to
59:13 - make a I'm going to make a guess that I
59:16 - found it right as soon as I find that as
59:26 - soon as I find the first character as
59:29 - soon as I find the first character be
59:31 - the same aha I found it and then any
59:33 - time I find any need to be different I
59:35 - can now say found equals false so the
59:39 - question becomes right here if found is
59:44 - true then I can break out of things and
59:48 - once one is not true I don't need to
59:51 - check the rest so I can break out and
59:54 - then if found return what so I'm gonna
60:00 - say let found index equals negative one
60:04 - I'll give a default value of negative
60:05 - one and then actually if I've found it
60:11 - right here found index should equal what
60:18 - I wherever we started with I and then a
60:27 - little bit lost in terms of all the
60:29 - loops going on here
60:34 - and then if I've gone through every
60:39 - possibility and I haven't found it then
60:42 - I'm gonna get to the end and I'm still
60:43 - just going to return negative one but
60:46 - found index will have negative one so if
60:48 - I found it somewhere I'm gonna set it
60:50 - equal to that first index get out of the
60:51 - loop I don't need to check anymore
60:52 - because I just looking for the first
60:54 - instance and then return what I found I
60:59 - must have made a mistake here somewhere
61:01 - right there's no way this could be
61:02 - correct and I'm gonna add a third
61:13 - argument for offset and I can say
61:37 - and just as a really quick hack I'm just
61:40 - gonna start at index equals two to skip
61:42 - the three I mean whatever let this is
61:44 - fine let me just start it ah let's run
61:50 - and see if this works
61:58 - No found is not defined sketch line 22
62:14 - this if statement has got to be inside
62:17 - here right this is where I'm looking at
62:24 - every single character in the large
62:26 - string I'm searching through as soon as
62:29 - one of those characters is equal to the
62:31 - start check every check all the
62:33 - subsequent characters and then if I
62:35 - found it break out of that larger loop
62:38 - and keep going so that this should be
62:41 - right now I'm sure there's other
62:42 - mistakes but that will be fixed all
62:45 - right one four one five nine at digit
62:48 - number one which is right weirdly enough
62:51 - I didn't subtract out the one anywhere
63:03 - right
63:09 - so the chat is giving me a nice quick
63:13 - optimization that the chat is give me a
63:16 - nice suggestion where I could simplify
63:18 - this code where I don't actually need
63:20 - this found index because I could just
63:22 - return I which will automatically break
63:24 - out of the loop and then if I get to the
63:25 - end I could just return negative one so
63:27 - let's try that again yeah why is that
63:34 - one shouldn't that be zero one shouldn't
63:38 - that be getting to oh I'm already
63:41 - subtracting the one there great great so
63:49 - this works let's try the 999 thing there
63:55 - we go
63:55 - so this is done and this algorithm has
63:58 - no problem with 1 million searching and
64:02 - a string of 1 million characters be
64:04 - interesting to think of what is the try
64:12 - it different number
64:34 - two-thirty excellent I'm gonna be taking
64:36 - a break soon I'm trying to think
64:51 - Oh Thank You Simon about the noting the
64:56 - thing about brilliant I will check that
64:58 - big o-notation
65:06 - one thing I'd like to think about here
65:08 - is what is the Big O notation for this
65:12 - particular algorithm so when I talk
65:14 - about Big O notation
65:26 - why is it Oh again order that's what I
65:31 - thought okay one of the things that I
65:38 - would love to consider here is what is
65:41 - the Big O notation for this particular
65:44 - algorithm Big O for the order of the
65:46 - algorithm how long how many
65:48 - computational cycles are required to
65:51 - search for a string of n characters in a
65:54 - larger string also of of n characters
66:00 - boy yeah way is there any moderators
66:05 - here it can help me with this report
66:17 - [Music]
66:21 - oh and and yeah oh okay I'm trying to
66:30 - moderate this know if anybody wants to
66:35 - help me with that that would be great oh
66:38 - my god so many of them
66:53 - are there no moderators Ally watching it
66:58 - okay
66:59 - Topher jay is here thank you thank you
67:01 - to forge a train whistle for you right
67:13 - so let's think about this I'm gonna
67:17 - start this thought over so before I move
67:20 - on I want to think about the Big O
67:22 - notation what I mean is what is the
67:24 - order what is the computational
67:26 - complexity of this particular search
67:28 - algorithm so I have a string I'm
67:31 - searching through and it has its length
67:34 - is n the characters and then I'm
67:36 - searching for another string whose
67:38 - length is M characters and when work
67:46 - when considering Big O notation the idea
67:49 - is to think about the worst case
67:50 - scenario how long does it take if I'm
67:52 - not going to find it basically or if I
67:54 - find it at the very very end of that
67:55 - string so I know I need n checks 0 1 2 3
68:03 - 4 5 6 7 all the way up to N so it is at
68:06 - least Big O order n but for every one of
68:10 - these I've also got to check I mean if I
68:13 - find one of them I've got to check all
68:15 - of these so really I think it should be
68:18 - how like if this 10 digits here and
68:21 - there's 3 digits here that's 30 checks
68:24 - 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2
68:27 - 3 1 2 3
68:28 - now of course it's less than that
68:30 - because I only had to check these three
68:31 - when I see the four matches but imagine
68:33 - if this whole string were fours and then
68:36 - this were also before I'd always have to
68:38 - keep checking so it's really just n
68:39 - times n n times M and let's remember
68:44 - that for when we start looking at 1
68:46 - billion digits Oh
68:56 - so is that like reduced to just saying n
69:07 - yeah you know I know there's some BOTS
69:10 - in the chat I apologize about that I
69:11 - have like really not usually had this
69:14 - problem so I've never had to sort of
69:18 - deal with it but there's some folks on
69:19 - the case here so hopefully we could do
69:34 - know it's crazy as the bots or just like
69:38 - it's confusing because what they're
69:39 - doing is they're taking other chat
69:41 - messages that other people have posted
69:43 - and then re posting them with some extra
69:45 - emojis it's kind of amazing I don't know
69:49 - how to permanently ban an IP so we'll
69:53 - see what we do okay yeah and let me say
69:58 - that and even though ultimately the
70:04 - order is the big o-notation is n times m
70:07 - because the idea here n is going to be
70:10 - so much larger than when I'm looking for
70:12 - an M this can be sort of reduced down to
70:15 - a operation of order n which isn't so
70:19 - bad to be perfectly honest
70:26 - so to tie a little bow around this we
70:28 - say that this is Big O notation n for
70:31 - the length of the search string the
70:33 - string that I'm searching in alright so
70:38 - I'm gonna take a short break maybe this
70:39 - will also help us get rid of the bots
70:42 - they're very emotional needs bots and I
70:46 - [Music]
70:51 - and I am going to take a minute to tell
70:56 - you about the sponsor of today's a
70:58 - coding a train livestream which is
71:04 - brilliant brilliant is as been a
71:08 - longtime sponsor of the coding training
71:09 - I'm very thankful for having the sponsor
71:12 - it's a website an app and I really enjoy
71:16 - if you're interested in interactive
71:18 - learning as you're trying to do some
71:20 - learning from home these days I this
71:22 - could be a useful website to you they
71:24 - have a lot of online courses and one of
71:26 - the things that I really love is how the
71:28 - courses are interactive so I want to
71:30 - tell you about some some new stuff
71:31 - whoops that is that that to highlight
71:36 - for you that are different than maybe
71:37 - what I've highlighted before and so
71:45 - there's a new calculus in a nutshell
71:47 - course in calculus is a language used by
71:50 - colleges urban planners physicists you
71:52 - need kind of calculus to do stuff on the
71:53 - coding train to describe the world but
71:56 - it's often a lot of formulas and a lot
71:58 - of memorization so brilliant takes a
72:00 - bird's-eye view using visual and
72:01 - physical intuition by the way I mix
72:03 - we're going to tell you about the neural
72:04 - network one which is what's playing
72:05 - right now to present major pillars of
72:07 - calculus limits derivatives integrals
72:09 - and infinite sums so in that calculate
72:11 - calculus course there's a lot of sort of
72:14 - background material through interactive
72:15 - lessons I can really support the stuff
72:17 - that I'm doing on my channel I'm really
72:19 - excited about this new neural network
72:21 - course a little behind and talking about
72:23 - in terms of when the videos are
72:24 - auto-playing but what you're seeing here
72:26 - is a couple simple games that you could
72:30 - play interactively in the browser to
72:32 - learn the basics of how neural network
72:33 - functions so wiring up neurons and a
72:36 - process of feedback you can build net
72:38 - where you could get to build your own
72:39 - network
72:40 - that classifies handwritten digits and
72:42 - then there's another game which you just
72:45 - saw called where are my keys so I'm
72:47 - gonna come it doesn't take too long to
72:49 - play something to come back and explain
72:50 - you that one when it comes back on I'll
72:52 - work on my timing next it's really bit
72:55 - of rough week people but this is what
72:57 - I'm talking about in terms of the
72:58 - calculus course being able to play with
72:59 - formulas and visualizations and graphs
73:01 - in an interactive way it's a really fun
73:04 - thing to do and and you know the
73:05 - formulas can be scary but this is really
73:07 - healthy so this is the neural network
73:08 - course so let me tell you about this
73:09 - this key is one which will show up in a
73:11 - minute
73:11 - so the the ideas you'd want to find your
73:14 - keys in a messy room so the tiles the
73:17 - color in as you search and this is still
73:19 - doing the handwritten digits revealing
73:21 - how close or far your last guess was
73:23 - from the keys so it's gonna start so
73:27 - that's what this is so you're looking at
73:29 - ah is that close kind of like hot or
73:30 - cold this game I mean I feel like my
73:32 - kids play this game and basically
73:33 - without any clear indication of how to
73:35 - structure your guess is you can
73:36 - nevertheless get better round after
73:38 - round adjusting your response to
73:40 - feedback eventually finding the keys and
73:42 - this is really analogous to this sort of
73:44 - feedback based process the way that
73:47 - neural networks learn so you can just go
73:49 - right ahead and you can sign up for
73:51 - brilliant for free right now just by
73:53 - going to brilliant org slash coding
73:55 - train if you're in and a lot of the
73:58 - content is there for free so for example
73:59 - something that is for free are these
74:02 - daily challenges I'm gonna try to do one
74:04 - of them right now
74:05 - a Simon was mentioning to me that
74:07 - actually maybe my search string
74:08 - algorithm is part of let me see if I can
74:11 - find his message computer science
74:15 - algorithms archive let's try looking
74:17 - that up
74:18 - brilliant org courses computer science
74:26 - algorithms
74:29 - - archive
74:34 - so somewhere in this course maybe maybe
74:38 - there's a section on substring finding
74:42 - when I maybe I need a more a more direct
74:45 - link right - or I might have typed in
74:47 - something wrong but I will find it and
74:50 - share it with with the community either
74:52 - here in this live stream or on discord
74:53 - if I don't get to before him but I want
74:56 - to do one of the challenges these are my
74:57 - favorite things to do let's just try the
75:00 - one that's right here what is round and
75:01 - spins with teeth all over so the
75:06 - operation of a system of gears and I've
75:08 - lost my chat here for a second
75:16 - follows only one rule teeth in contact
75:19 - always move in the same direction at the
75:21 - same rate so based on the size you can
75:25 - see us this is run ten revolutions per
75:28 - per minute I guess rpms per second
75:32 - whatever rotations per minute
75:33 - yes ten rotations per minute revolutions
75:35 - one Avenue shoals
75:36 - per minute the larger one rotates at two
75:39 - rpms because the ratio of the size the
75:45 - bronze gear has ten teeth oh it's a
75:47 - number of teeth and the gold gear has
75:50 - fifty teeth okay so oh I think I see
75:55 - what this is gonna be already and the
75:56 - gear system below a set of silver gears
75:58 - injuries having 20 teeth the silver gear
76:00 - on the left turns clockwise at ten
76:02 - rotations what speed and direction will
76:03 - the one on the right half so I'm just
76:04 - gonna be using my intuition here but one
76:07 - thing let's say let's figure out which
76:08 - direction it's going to move so if i
76:10 - zoom in on this for a second this one's
76:14 - moving clockwise so this one will move
76:16 - counterclockwise so this one will move
76:18 - clockwise so this one will move
76:20 - counterclockwise so it's
76:22 - counterclockwise so one of the things
76:24 - that I work on with my kids is like if
76:27 - you're taking a multiple-choice test you
76:29 - can always good to eliminate things so
76:31 - maybe I'm not gonna be able to figure
76:33 - the rest out but I kind of now know it's
76:35 - one of these two now my intuition is
76:38 - it's going to be counterclockwise at ten
76:40 - because ultimately the what is what what
76:44 - is the way to calculate
76:47 - the amount of rotations per minute has
76:49 - to do with the relative ratio of teeth
76:53 - and that one at the right is the same as
76:57 - the ones the left so even if it's like
76:59 - becomes a smaller number which becomes a
77:01 - much bigger number which becomes back to
77:03 - a smaller number it should be ten so I'm
77:05 - guessing it is counterclockwise at ten
77:07 - rpm I hope I'm right about this but like
77:10 - I say it's great to be wrong because
77:12 - when you're wrong that's when you really
77:14 - learn so I should really be happy with
77:17 - being wrong it sometimes can feel a
77:19 - little embarrassing but guess what life
77:22 - is embarrassing all right let's hit
77:25 - submit probably all figure this out much
77:29 - faster than me
77:32 - correct whoo all right and let's see oh
77:37 - look here someone's got a nice
77:38 - explanation and formula which is that
77:44 - okay so I guess you could count the
77:46 - teeth so this is 10 which means this is
77:50 - I should say 40 here but 20 here to
77:54 - think about this there might be an error
77:56 - somewhere here but you can see the idea
78:03 - let's look at some other solutions yeah
78:05 - 20 divided by 10 10 divided by 50 50 by
78:08 - 20 get back to 10 yeah this is a nice
78:14 - extinct way of saying it so anyway if
78:17 - you have some clever ideas Vernal this
78:19 - would be an awesome thing to simulate
78:20 - with p5.js to make this animate that
78:22 - would be really fun to do so if you are
78:24 - interested that would be a great coding
78:26 - challenge to do you could try it and if
78:28 - you have other ideas for great answers
78:30 - to put here you could you could put them
78:33 - here and Florence I'm not going to
78:35 - answer your question about what ide i
78:36 - use you're always just chatting chatting
78:38 - chatting florence okay when is the CNN
78:42 - video coming oh I don't think I artists
78:44 - flowing again I got to take a break let
78:47 - me take a break and see if there's
78:48 - anything I could do if anybody knows
78:52 - Simon is telling me the course is called
78:54 - algorithms during the break I'm going to
78:55 - look for it to see if I can find it if
78:57 - anybody knows any way that I could
79:00 - effectively ban the box more
79:03 - definitively let's see if I can try to
79:06 - do that during the break as well so I'll
79:07 - just say a 5-minute break and be back to
79:09 - try to search through a billion digits
79:10 - with no js' in about 40 minutes I don't
79:14 - know if I'll be able to do it but I'm
79:15 - gonna try
79:17 - [Music]
79:43 - [Music]
80:16 - [Music]
80:28 - [Music]
82:44 - [Music]
82:54 - [Music]
83:00 - [Music]
83:22 - [Music]
83:37 - all right folks I'm starting back up in
83:39 - just a minute or two because my time is
83:41 - super limited so
83:45 - [Music]
84:09 - okay I'm back I don't have a lot of time
84:13 - so I'm taking a shortened break a couple
84:16 - of things one is looks like I need to
84:18 - get like something like nightbot or
84:20 - something - which is a tool that I can
84:22 - use so maybe manage to chat better the
84:25 - only at present just manually with to
84:27 - like hide users so if the new counts
84:29 - keeping being being made so I'll look
84:34 - for the next time I will look into
84:35 - setting up nightbot for for the next
84:38 - stream somebody please remind me of this
84:40 - in discord if you haven't joined the
84:41 - discord join the discord somebody can
84:44 - hopefully post that that link to the
84:49 - chat right now if you have moderator
84:53 - privileges you can post a link to the
84:54 - discord that's where all of the
84:56 - community activity happens outside of
84:58 - the actual live streams okay this is a
85:03 - very bad idea what I'm going to attempt
85:04 - to do right now because I probably
85:06 - should just call today that was a nice
85:08 - little thing that I made and I could
85:10 - talk wrap it up and talk about other
85:12 - things you could do but I am going to
85:17 - just bear with me I'm going to get
85:19 - myself set up to do a part two of this
85:22 - [Music]
85:46 - [Music]
85:53 - [Music]
86:19 - [Music]
86:30 - [Music]
87:00 - [Music]
88:46 - [Music]
89:03 - [Music]
89:08 - okay
89:10 - [Music]
89:25 - [Music]
89:27 - okay all right so what I am so let me
89:34 - let me do something here and we get the
89:36 - browser open oh did I mention by the way
89:39 - so we found it in the algorithms course
89:42 - on brilliant there's a whole course
89:45 - section in the algorithms course under
89:47 - substring searches so oh boy I really
89:50 - wish I had gone through this before
89:51 - where I started today but I will take a
89:54 - look at it and come maybe maybe it'll
89:56 - help come back to it Simon had mentioned
89:58 - DFA and KMP algorithms I don't actually
90:00 - know if it was hard but maybe I can look
90:03 - those up in and offer them as things
90:05 - suggestions okay all right so so you
90:11 - know what I don't know that I'm just in
90:17 - case I can't even come back to just in
90:20 - case this needs to be a two-parter I'm
90:22 - gonna I'm gonna record a little ending
90:29 - as if I'm gonna do the next steps in in
90:40 - a second part so huh I don't like having
90:43 - a time pressure thing definitely do not
90:45 - have enough time we'll see you I might
90:47 - have to come back tomorrow somehow see
90:49 - if I can figure it out okay
90:58 - df8 let me just look at what these are
91:00 - DFA algorithm search string is that
91:04 - anything pattern searching PDF DFA based
91:09 - algorithm and KMP I'll figure that out
91:15 - alright so this really wraps up a small
91:21 - piece of this coding challenge I have
91:23 - made my own version of fathom
91:25 - informations peek inside pi I even wrote
91:28 - my own string search function there's so
91:31 - much more that you could do with this to
91:32 - be creative I mentioned at the top that
91:34 - you could think about what if what you
91:36 - weren't looking for were just numbers
91:38 - but you were looking for some other
91:39 - piece of data that's encoded into
91:41 - numbers so we could you find secret
91:43 - messages in PI or pieces of music and pi
91:46 - are there other kinds of algorithms that
91:48 - you could explore that you could
91:50 - optimize this particular search
91:52 - algorithm with foot with and I'll list
91:55 - some of those in the video's description
91:56 - that's a little challenge out to you to
91:57 - research some of those and tell me about
91:59 - your favorite substring search algorithm
92:01 - in the comments but those are going to
92:04 - be needed for when I take the next step
92:06 - and attempt to get this working with a
92:08 - billion digits of pi and for that I'm
92:10 - also going to need a node server so I'm
92:12 - going to come back and do that in a part
92:14 - two to this video it might be right
92:16 - there for you to watch right now but if
92:17 - you're kind of watching this right when
92:18 - the video came out it's probably not
92:20 - there yet but don't worry I'm definitely
92:21 - getting to this one so stay tuned for a
92:24 - part two where I don't even know I've
92:25 - done it yet so it might not actually
92:26 - work but I'm gonna do my best to get a
92:29 - version of this working where I can
92:31 - search for any sequence of digits within
92:34 - 1 billion digits of pi and from there
92:36 - the sky of pi is the limit
92:40 - let's see you soon
92:47 - all right I don't know let's see where I
92:55 - get to
93:01 - I'm Annie G's read stream I think I can
93:12 - so we'll figure this out later it's good
93:18 - to have a plan okay I just need like a
93:26 - little extra time today I'm so close I'm
93:31 - not leaving you don't have to say
93:32 - goodbye all right I have an idea I have
93:39 - an idea
93:50 - so here I am in the sketch I wrote
93:52 - previously what do I do I'm really I'm
93:57 - obsessing just so you know I'm obsessing
93:59 - in my head about what this is gonna
94:00 - become later but you really should enjoy
94:02 - just let the let the coding flow let it
94:05 - just happen Oh today is one of those
94:08 - days I'm really having a hard time okay
94:14 - yeah this is gonna be - it's gonna be
94:17 - two short videos part 1 and part 2 or
94:20 - not I don't know I can't decide so
94:29 - here's what I have so far
94:30 - I made this sketch where if a digit
94:33 - appears in the first so here's what I
94:37 - have so far I made this sketch no go
94:39 - away
94:40 - Apple thingy so here's what I have so
94:49 - far I've made a sketch where if I type
94:51 - in any sequence of digits like eight
94:53 - three six five one eight up it'll give
94:57 - me the index into the first million
95:00 - digits of pi where that sequence can be
95:01 - found or if it's not found it'll tell me
95:04 - it's not found and I'm doing this by
95:06 - just loading a text file with the first
95:08 - million digits of pi and searching in it
95:10 - so at the very least I could be like
95:12 - okay let's run this exact same code but
95:15 - now let's take a text file that has a
95:19 - billion digits of pi so I'm gonna go
95:20 - back to add file here and I'm gonna go
95:23 - back to my file system ignore that part
95:27 - and I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna
95:29 - find my billion billion dollar write my
95:33 - billion digit PI file drag that into the
95:37 - browser here and mmm
95:42 - well I'm surprised and not really
95:45 - getting an error message or anything but
95:47 - the web editor will not let you upload a
95:50 - file that big and even if it could am I
95:52 - really gonna expect my client-side code
95:54 - to load well one a one gigabyte file
95:57 - with a billion characters in it
96:03 - now this plenty weighs probably that
96:05 - file could be compressed encoded a
96:07 - different way I probably get down to
96:09 - like 600 megabytes or something but
96:11 - that's not really my concern my concern
96:13 - is how can I load that file into memory
96:17 - Oh David you're here I'm still here
96:25 - welcome but whether it's 600 megabytes
96:32 - or a gigabyte I've still really got the
96:33 - same problem I have this like huge file
96:35 - so rather than try to work with it
96:37 - client-side in any type of clever way
96:39 - I'm just going to use a node application
96:41 - by the way I could probably do this in
96:42 - processing because a desktop piece of
96:44 - desktop processing is not gonna have any
96:45 - problem loading a really large file but
96:47 - I want to stay into JavaScript I'm going
96:49 - to create a node server that can load
96:52 - all the digits store them into memory
96:54 - and then my client-side JavaScript code
96:56 - could query that node server
97:08 - now if you've never used node before I
97:11 - do have a few basic beginner tutorials
97:13 - about installing node and getting setup
97:15 - with node and I'll refer you to those
97:17 - but I'm gonna start from the point where
97:19 - I have a directory with a blank
97:21 - javascript file a package of JSON files
97:24 - to describe my project that I'm building
97:25 - and both a million digit and billion
97:28 - billion digit file of Pi so I'm gonna
97:31 - start by working in index touch I asked
97:33 - to write some code to load that file so
97:37 - first I need to require the filesystem
97:39 - module and one thing that I could just
97:44 - do is just with the million digits of pi
97:47 - let's just read file sync let's just
97:49 - read the whole file in and see what
97:58 - happens
98:02 - Oh interesting so the file has been read
98:04 - in but look how it's being displayed
98:06 - it's giving me the binary information
98:09 - into the console so I want to tell it
98:11 - that I want to read it as a string and
98:12 - I'll use utf-8 so that's a second
98:16 - argument to read file sync and now here
98:19 - we go and there's all those digits of pi
98:21 - all those 1 million digits now let's
98:22 - just change it to why not keep it to a
98:24 - billion what could possibly go wrong
98:27 - Oh interesting did something but it
98:34 - didn't print anything out so I know this
98:36 - is just basically a bad idea I don't
98:37 - know whether something crashed or memory
98:39 - ran out but read file sync for a
98:41 - gigabyte file is not a good idea and I
98:43 - think what I want to investigate here is
98:45 - create stream create read stream so let
98:49 - me just look for that let's just find
98:59 - this page no this is I don't want this
99:02 - page I just want the documentation page
99:04 - here we go
99:07 - so I'm on the node documentation page
99:10 - read stream or create yeah here we go
99:17 - create read stream so create read stream
99:20 - is a function I can call to create eight
99:27 - so create read stream is a function I
99:29 - can call to open up a stream for reading
99:32 - the file so I can read it bit by bit I
99:34 - can kind of track how long it's going to
99:36 - take and get what I want and piece it
99:38 - together just gives me a lot of options
99:40 - so let me do that by saying stream
99:44 - equals FS create read stream and let's
99:48 - go back to the million and then once I
99:56 - have a stream I believe that I can
99:59 - basically handle different events so for
100:02 - example I can say stream on data that's
100:04 - when anything is actually coming in I
100:06 - can then have a callback function and
100:09 - just console.log the data
100:14 - I've got a problem why is there a four
100:18 - space tab what happened what happened to
100:23 - you visual studio code I can't deal with
100:41 - it
100:41 - the number of spaces a tab is equal to 2
100:43 - - based on the file contents when editor
100:47 - detect and indentation is on somebody
100:51 - help me I can't take it CJ are you out
100:53 - there somewhere
100:54 - I'll see Jason the chap help me help me
100:58 - I can't go on I can't go on maybe
101:02 - there's something wrong before space is
101:03 - I just I can't handle it mind if I tag
101:10 - here tab sighs - where do I get the
101:17 - board I just hit the JSON file though
101:19 - the interface has changed I'm so
101:21 - confused
101:21 - oh there we go tap size 2 to 4 now save
101:25 - true-true - okay okay
101:28 - bottom right bottom right bottom right
101:30 - bottom right uh here we go thank you
101:35 - how do we change this and don't use a
101:38 - spaces whoo thank you everybody
101:46 - oh no no huh well went back
101:57 - there we go okay we're okay now I don't
102:02 - know how do I permanently change that
102:04 - yeah okay I don't know why I don't know
102:08 - what I don't know what's going on okay
102:13 - we're back
102:21 - so now if I run this hopefully I'm gonna
102:23 - see all those digits streaming out I'm
102:25 - still just gonna use the million the
102:27 - million digits file okay oh I'm getting
102:32 - I'm getting the binary data so probably
102:36 - I can say just data to string rate so
102:42 - that's the million digits of pi you're
102:44 - in I'm sort of curious to do console.log
102:54 - like how big are the chunks that it's
102:56 - reading this in yeah you can see so you
103:03 - can see these are the chunks that it's
103:05 - reading the data and they're pretty
103:06 - large because I put some line breaks in
103:09 - between each each each chunk of the
103:12 - stream in fact I think a lot of examples
103:13 - use the word sort of like a chunk here
103:18 - so now let's try 1 billion digits of pi
103:26 - yeah okay we have 1 billion digits up hi
103:48 - boy this is taking a while oh there we
103:53 - go
103:53 - all 1 billion digits could I possibly
103:57 - just put them all into one string
104:10 - and then uh-huh if I have stream on I
104:13 - believe it's end I think there's an end
104:15 - and a closed and by the way if this
104:23 - arrow syntax isn't familiar to you it's
104:25 - a nice way of writing callback and
104:27 - anonymous functions and there's a lot
104:29 - more to it than that and I have a whole
104:30 - video about arrow functions you could
104:32 - watch let's just do digits dot length
104:37 - and see if we get 1 billion digits digit
104:46 - is not defined data digits
105:03 - and look at that it's 1 billion in two
105:05 - because the three and the one don't
105:07 - actually count okay now let's just
105:10 - search for a digit ah I might be able to
105:14 - finish this fast fast fast huh
105:16 - I gotta start a web server and all that
105:18 - kind of stuff okay okay okay let's grab
105:23 - my index of function that I wrote
105:26 - previously and bring it into the node
105:31 - code and then let's look for I'm just
105:37 - going to hard code this let's search
105:40 - what was I looking for nine nine now
105:42 - let's look for $9.99 and then index of
105:48 - digits search and then console dot log
105:54 - index
106:03 - 763 old minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1
106:08 - ok so that worked now here's the thing
106:11 - that didn't take very long because that
106:14 - is actually found at 760 - does anybody
106:18 - know of a sequence of digits that's very
106:21 - very far into the sequence of a billion
106:23 - digits that would be helpful to know
106:25 - while you're thinking about that for
106:26 - those of you who happen to be watching
106:27 - this live not in the recorded video that
106:29 - you right now not you watching this live
106:31 - but you're watching this later or
106:33 - watching let's just quickly add in a web
106:36 - server so I can make a call to ask for
106:40 - the location of a given digit
106:54 - yeah yeah yeah yeah where's my very
106:59 - basic example take a selfie app this
107:03 - works okay
107:14 - so in this video I'm not going to go
107:16 - through all of the pieces of adding a
107:19 - web server and how HTTP requests work
107:21 - and get requests and response and all
107:23 - that stuff but guess what if you're
107:24 - interested in a much lengthier series
107:26 - about all of the details lemon add
107:28 - quickly right now you can find that in
107:30 - the working with data and AP is in
107:32 - JavaScript a learning playlist that I
107:34 - have on this channel but for now I'm
107:36 - gonna go and copy paste but I'm copy
107:37 - pasting from the code that I have for
107:39 - those examples right here I want to
107:40 - create an express app so I'm gonna add
107:44 - an Express app I want I don't need this
107:46 - database stuff so I just need to create
107:48 - an app Express I want to listen that
107:51 - port 3000 and then I need just a get
107:54 - request so I'm gonna grab this I just
107:58 - want to handle one route I'm gonna say
108:00 - get whenever I do I'm gonna just call
108:02 - this route search and then here how do I
108:11 - find the digits wait hold on yeah
108:16 - requests not body oh I just need a
108:20 - simple get request
108:24 - we're how do I do that thing you
108:27 - thinking a Bob where if it's got
108:30 - parameters does that not in this example
108:39 - [Music]
108:40 - and in this example
108:47 - yeah this is what I'm looking for sorry
108:49 - I want this one yeah okay
108:58 - actually I'm gonna call this pie and
109:01 - then I'm going to use one of those
109:03 - things called rusty and routes something
109:06 - like that to look for some sequence of
109:10 - digits in let's call it search let's
109:12 - keep it with search some sequence of
109:13 - digits and what's going wrong here
109:23 - oh this needs
109:33 - request params digits right it's not how
109:37 - that works yeah
109:58 - so basically I have a simple get request
110:01 - when if ever I run this server any time
110:03 - somebody navigates to search slash some
110:06 - sequence of digits I'm gonna pull out
110:08 - those digits and just send them back so
110:11 - let's run this server and let's get rid
110:13 - of I'm gonna get rid of just this I'm on
110:18 - end stuff right now I don't need this
110:20 - actually I'm just gonna write
110:21 - console.log billion digits loaded and
110:28 - let me run the server mmm err oh I've
110:33 - got to install Express so Express is a
110:40 - nice framework for making web servers
110:42 - and node then we run it again so I'm
110:45 - listening at port 3000 the bindle
110:47 - billion digits are loaded I'm gonna go
110:50 - to localhost 3000 there's nothing there
110:53 - but now if I go to slash search slash 1
110:59 - like 4 3 3 to 5 or I see it I got it and
111:05 - I sent it back guess what I can do now
111:07 - this is really exciting so now if I go
111:10 - back to sorry everybody
111:12 - hmm
111:22 - so if I take this code where I was
111:24 - searching before and I bring it up here
111:31 - and I can say search equals request
111:34 - params digits search for it within the
111:40 - digits and then send that response back
111:45 - but ultimately I want to turn make this
111:48 - JSON so I'm gonna say index I'm gonna
111:51 - make this a nice little JSON object and
111:54 - I'll also send back what was the search
111:57 - string as well so let's try this one
112:03 - more time and let's switch to a million
112:04 - digits to make this I know that it runs
112:07 - faster so I'm going to just change this
112:09 - to a million digits go back to the
112:11 - browser hit refresh oh I've got to
112:15 - restart the server go back to the
112:19 - browser and there we go
112:30 - this particular sequence of digits was
112:33 - found at that index let's double check
112:36 - this with fathoms peak in PI the digits
112:43 - were 4 3 3 2 4 it's found at the 35th
112:50 - thousand third at the 35th thousands 570
112:55 - second digit of pi is that what I got
113:05 - yes that's what I got so my search is
113:08 - working and now let's change it well
113:12 - let's get it working from our interface
113:14 - first then we'll try it with a billion
113:15 - digits so now I don't want to just do
113:17 - this by hard coding this into the
113:18 - browser I want to go back to my p5 code
113:22 - and in my p5 code I'm not going to load
113:25 - the data file there I don't even need to
113:28 - do the search there so index of can go
113:30 - to way go away but whenever I want to
113:33 - search it up instead of actually running
113:36 - the search I'm going to make a get
113:39 - request so I'm gonna say load JSON the
113:45 - the URL is and HTTP well let's just grip
113:52 - Gravatt localhost colon 3000 slash
113:58 - search and then add in the actual search
114:02 - value this is a string literal which is
114:04 - an incredibly convenient way to put a
114:06 - variable into a string I'm gonna I'm
114:09 - gonna call low JSON got results and then
114:13 - when I get the results the result comes
114:21 - back in index and that is where I'm
114:26 - going to put it in the paragraph
114:42 - get rid of these things I don't need so
114:47 - basically this is just the interface and
114:49 - the interface whenever interface goes
114:53 - and asks the server to look in the
114:55 - digits with the server being the one
114:57 - that can handle holding on to those
114:58 - billion digits so but I need to host
115:06 - this webpage and the way that I'm going
115:09 - to do that it's use express the same
115:11 - Express server that is serving up the
115:14 - digits of pi that the index value into
115:16 - the digits of pi to serve up these web
115:18 - pages and that I can do with adding like
115:21 - Express static something-or-other
115:23 - let me go look back to my older
115:24 - tutorials about this it's right here app
115:31 - got use Express static public so I want
115:34 - to host everything that's in a directory
115:36 - called public which happens to be what I
115:38 - just called it back into the server
115:45 - there we go
115:46 - and you can see I have this the p5
115:49 - sketch that I've been working with is in
115:51 - the directory public we don't need this
115:53 - million digits of pi anymore there it's
115:57 - not part of the clients at all just part
115:58 - of the server let me restart the server
116:04 - let me go to localhost 3000 mmm uncaught
116:12 - error raw is not defined so I've got
116:14 - some errors in my p5 code
116:26 - oh I don't need the digits no longer
116:30 - belongs here
116:38 - there's some weird extra error about
116:40 - style dot CSS I'm not concerned with
116:43 - that let's just get rid of that there we
116:46 - go okay now ooh okay it's searching it's
116:54 - always finding negative 2 because it's
116:57 - searching for this like : what what
116:59 - weird that : come from where did I put
117:02 - that in by accident oh look at that oh
117:10 - it's just an extra : that I had actually
117:13 - in the string that goes away by go away
117:15 - :
117:25 - it works it's searching in PI but the
117:29 - searching is happening on the server so
117:31 - now it's time this is the grand finale
117:34 - of today's coding train hide a challenge
117:37 - we are going to search in 1 billion
117:40 - digits of pi to find any given sequence
117:43 - of digits it is time I'm going to do it
117:45 - to go back to my server code close
117:50 - anticlimactic I'm gonna change it to
117:52 - loading the billion digits of pi I'm
117:54 - gonna restart the server I got to wait
117:59 - it loaded the billion digits it's now
118:01 - waiting for me going back to the webpage
118:06 - let me just refresh this webpage and I
118:09 - don't know let's try searching question
118:17 - is has it found it no it didn't find
118:21 - that so Kim somebody's a fact checks
118:24 - this for me is that sequence not in the
118:26 - first billion digits of pi
118:35 - that sequence is not either
118:44 - it was finding it before yep it found
118:47 - that one so this so far is the longest
118:49 - sequence I've been able to find let me
118:51 - just change this to a five and found
118:53 - that it takes a while it's slow it's
118:56 - slow David suggested a string two oh
119:01 - seven seven five five one zero let's see
119:04 - if that works - oh seven seven five five
119:10 - one zero there this is at digit number
119:17 - 176 million eight hundred sixty-six
119:20 - thousand three hundred and seventy seven
119:22 - that's pretty good
119:23 - I suppose I could look up in that text
119:26 - file I have well I have an idea
119:28 - let's look at what's in that text file
119:31 - the last few digits
119:44 - digits dot well let's start digits dot
119:48 - length minus ten I could use like
119:54 - substring or something but I'm just like
119:55 - afraid so let me print out the last ten
120:05 - digits in the first billion digits of pi
120:14 - wait what just happened there
120:16 - oh no no digits car car at
120:29 -  okay I really have to be like this
120:39 - I'm doing this in the weirdest most
120:42 - nonsensical way
120:52 - so with a little detective work I have
120:54 - determined that these are the last ten
120:57 - digits in the first billion digits of pi
121:00 - so just to see how slow is the searching
121:05 - I'm gonna refresh this page and I'm
121:10 - going to paste those last ten digits in
121:12 - here and we're gonna see how long it
121:13 - takes there we go it found it and that's
121:23 - not so terrible so we can't even with my
121:25 - crude brute-force algorithm find any
121:29 - sequence of digits in the first 1
121:31 - billion digits of pi by having both a
121:34 - server and client talk to each other so
121:36 - many possibilities here
121:38 - how could you optimize the search
121:40 - algorithm how could you make the API do
121:42 - all sorts of more fun creative things to
121:44 - give you more information about what's
121:46 - in pi
121:46 - could you put this on to glitch so we
121:49 - could maybe we could make this like the
121:50 - glitch is a hosting website that allows
121:53 - you to deploy different kind of creative
121:54 - web applications so maybe I could make a
121:56 - version of this that runs on glitch that
121:58 - people could remix I will include a link
122:01 - to that if I can get it to work in this
122:02 - video's description
122:03 - and you could just be much more creative
122:06 - about the interface and once again what
122:08 - are you actually really searching for
122:10 - could you search for secret messages in
122:12 - PI by thinking about encoding text into
122:15 - digits music in PI by encoding musical
122:19 - notes and melodies and rhythms into
122:21 - digits
122:22 - colors in the digits what data could you
122:24 - search for in PI and what what wonderful
122:27 - things could you discover that way and
122:29 - maybe you could find a text file with
122:31 - more than a billion digits and make your
122:33 - own version that searches into even
122:35 - larger number of digits of pi I hope you
122:37 - enjoyed this pi day coding challenge I
122:40 - will sing you out with my song about the
122:43 - last ten digits in the first 1 billion
122:47 - digits of pi which has not been
122:49 - rehearsed or planned and as ukulele
122:51 - hasn't even been tuned in like a month
122:53 - so I really hope this doesn't end up in
122:54 - the video and get to edit it out instead
122:57 - [Music]
123:12 - what did I do last year
123:14 - [Music]
123:25 - no we're not gonna do the song I don't
123:27 - have time I'll come back tomorrow and do
123:29 - the song if I have time thank you for
123:31 - watching this coding train coding
123:33 - challenge pi day thanks to fathom
123:36 - information design for the inspiration
123:38 - with peeking inside Pi and thanks also
123:41 - to Fontan bibi's and all of all of you
123:44 - watching this live on the lan during the
123:46 - livestream with all of the suggestions
123:49 - and help that you offered I'll see you
123:51 - soon next time on the coding train have
123:53 - a great day ride all aboard all that
123:55 - nonsense look that catchphrase it's
123:56 - coming one day oh this is my country
123:58 - it's not a phrase it's a sound - train
124:00 - whistle sound that's my country's okay
124:17 - alright everybody I am really under the
124:20 - gun in terms of time because I have to
124:22 - pick up my daughter at school at 4:20
124:25 - settle down people
124:27 - that's the actual time I have to go pick
124:29 - her up and it takes me a little while to
124:33 - pack up everything and it takes me a
124:35 - little while I'll take the subway or
124:36 - walk there depending on what's happening
124:37 - with the subway I mean if I don't
124:39 - actually definitely don't have to it's a
124:41 - 45-minute walk from here so there's no
124:42 - way I can walk the subway so thank you
124:45 - everybody I'm gonna just like quickly
124:46 - race out of here I'm gonna be doing
124:49 - that's I'm gonna be doing some coding in
124:52 - the Cabana video soon I was gonna spin
124:54 - the wheel I'm like you're like a quick
124:56 - I'd be home alone it seems like the way
124:58 - things are coping as I discussed what
125:00 - good vienna's livestream is I'm not
125:02 - gonna be able to be at work
125:03 - the studio is often or perhaps never for
125:07 - the top for a period of time so I might
125:09 - try to figure out live streaming from
125:10 - home I might make more just putting the
125:11 - Cabana videos stay tuned please join the
125:14 - discord where I will announce all this
125:16 - stuff and all of that and so I will see
125:20 - you all soon thank you for watching this
125:21 - I don't know if this is gonna be able to
125:23 - get edited together into something by
125:24 - Saturday if it can't then it can't but
125:29 - I'm gonna give it a try so stay tuned
125:30 - wait for Saturday and we'll add some
125:32 - extra fun things in it you have any
125:34 - creative ideas want to participate in
125:35 - that join the discord join the discord
125:37 - join the discord borrow everybody well
125:40 - I'm not ready to leave you I'm gonna hit
125:43 - stop recording I'll leave it open for a
125:45 - second while I do some of my cleanup
125:46 - stuff stop cording I hope this worked
125:51 - what are you gonna do if it doesn't the
125:53 - problem yeah the hole 1 million
125:57 - subscriber thing you got to deal with
125:59 - that too all right everybody did you see
126:04 - you later time for the diss song thanks

Cleaned transcript:

check 1 2 3 sorry about that I didn't realize I had the volume down very low this is my sound check of my voice how are the levels can you hear me and is the balance between me and the get started in just about 2 or 3 minutes hello happy is a Thursday I am really having trouble keeping track of what day it is welcome to the coding train with me your host Dan I'll just take a deep breath just take a big deep breath together ready I don't know where you're watching from this from where in the world you're watching this I don't know what your circumstances are what you did what time of day it is what you did this morning this afternoon at night how you slept any of those things but all in all I would just like to know how are you doing are you doing okay I am based in New York City specifically in Brooklyn New York it has been quite a week of chaos here if not a month or a year or the last however many years whoever you want to get started do you hear that noise by the way I want to talk about that noise in a second but things are a little quite in flux in the city here specifically where I work where my day job is at New York University do you hear that sound I would like to know maybe you can't hear it hmm I'm gonna wait for that sound to finish but by the way that is literally the sound of somebody washing their hands and I'm not kidding just you know there's a lot of I don't know irony or humor there you gotta have a sense of humor sometimes though it's important to take things seriously and follow science or now Noah dancing around the topic that is on my mind which is what's going on with coronavirus and specifically New York City and New York University so nobody's saying they can hear that sound oh yeah I hear it says DT six let me address that a second so New York University has cancelled all inperson classes and events and meetings there's a lot of other changes going on in the city of New York itself this has caused a lot of us who work at NYU to have to change our daily routines to revamp our curriculum to think about different things I am a person as you might have noticed who happens to do a lot of online education Edel adjacent stuff on the internet so in many ways I am set up well to engage in experiment with remote education but I would say that I think it is something very different to be caring for and teach at caring for a class a cohort of whether it's six students or eight or 12 or 16 or 20 or 50 or a hundred even which is quite different than this sort of livestreaming thing on YouTube there are relationships and the things I do on this channel I hope are resources to people who are teaching courses that they can create their community their local community of their course around but I do think it's it's a I want to be careful about suggesting that oh it's time to do remote education that's a thing that I do already it's not I do a kind of remote education and maybe a lot of it's filled with like way too much nonsense but but yes so I don't want to I don't want to belabor this story there is a huge amount of stuff to say on it I am not qualified to prognosticate and predict the future I'm just kind of working with what I need to do today and I think actually some of the changes that are happening based on looking at reducing the spread of the virus will probably ultimately open up a lot more time for me to livestream or make video tutorials but actually what's happened to me this week is I'm having a lot less time because there's a lot of things that need to be changed I'm spinning up actually a couple new classes for NYU there's just a lot of meetings and not to mention like my son's school closed he's actually having classes with zoom software at home he's in fifth grade and so you know I don't have to be there with him right now because I have that covered but that's it's a the puzzle pieces my daughter school is still open but the puzzle pieces of family and all that kind of stuff are become enormous ly complicated but I wasn't minted managed to stick to having a live stream today I started about a half an hour earlier than I originally intended and I have to leave absolutely 100% at 330 which is now about one hour and 50 minutes if I can still do math on some level loud think I want that noise to happen again so bizarrely I was in here the other day I actually was making a quick video tutorial for how to do video conferencing with zoom which I might try to do some more of that on the channel itself but it was loud noise and I thought you know we did shop there's something sorry I hit the Bell by accident there's a wood shop over there and I thought it's weird that I never hear the wood shop and all of a sudden I'm hearing it today so I'm drilling and I heard it again and hurt again and oh maybe there's a construction going on this building Mabel's construction then uh later I was like I need to you know go to the bathroom do it number one I need to wash my hands I need to wash my head a lot so I went in to wash my hands burn when the water comes out for it so right now during this live stream if we hear the sound bar I mean somebody's washing their hands and we should applaud them applaud them for washing your hands for not touching your face now it could be something we could code today a hand face detector but I don't want to be do I don't want to make light of what is an incredibly complicated and difficult and lifechanging for many people situation right now so that's all I have to say about that I'm going to move on to back to my sort of like usual programming which is a lot of this stuff with today's episode of the coding train you have 1/2 day early pi day thing ok whoa this is getting warm in here oh good touched my face all right uh we should let us let us now also transition to reading the ceremonial book of random numbers things are a little ominous these days so we're gonna have to do it fortynine thousand five hundred fourteen fifty six thousand nine hundred seventy seven sixty one thousand ninety one okay oh boy Friday the 13th is tomorrow okay you know I did I already probably told my Friday the 13th story when I was a little young lad along last lassie laddie whatever whatever is you say that I had a boo boo boo bad boo boo on harder than 30 I don't want diarrhea no live stream from a year or two years ago somebody will find me so um this Saturday is March 14th also known as pi day 4 3 3 1 for being the 3.14 being the first digits of pi i off I have in the past done a live stream on pi day I actually was supposed to travel this weekend I am no longer traveling this weekend that trip was canceled so but I don't know what I'll be doing yet this weekend and I I almost am sure I won't be physically here in this building on Saturday so no Pi Day livestream unless I spend something up from home or something like that but I thought what I would do today is a coding challenge related to PI so it would happen today during this live stream in the next hour and 45 minutes or so and then machiya and I would work in the next 24 hours or so to edit it down to it's sort of like core essential components which would then be released as the pi day coding challenge on Saturday so that is my plan so that's what happened today now either some people been asking the thumbnail it says things like OBS basics another see chapter 3 because I guess turday and I woke up this morning I was like I want to talk about livestreaming and how I could use open broadcast studio record a lecture and I'm a nature of code I'm gonna be in chapter 3 so I could do a little bit on nature of CO chapter 3 the time the time the time the time it got compressed I do want to really think about and maybe come back next week and focus on are there a set of tutorials that I can do to help teachers specifically who might be who who might be doing remote learning might want to record a video lecture are there things that I that that I can make some content about to help people so specifically if you're a teacher and there's like a thing I would love to hear from you or if you have ideas for me let me know and maybe next week you know a lot of a lot of the what people are doing with remote learning is realtime interaction and questions and feedback and smaller groups and that's not something that I really actually have a lot of experience with when I have experience together this much more like oneway broadcast although it there is sometimes like a chat and different things but but I would like to offer some resources one resource I do want to mention let me just try to find it for a second because there have been a lot of people putting together just hold off sometimes I can't talk and search by the way I have a question my kids say search it up like who who won the World Series in 1967 hey Dad just search it up is that a thing do people say search it up or did they invent Sega search it up and now it's a thing that people are gonna say because I'm telling you you could say search it up today Kenny it's sketchy trust me but maybe it's already a thing and I'm an old old Internet man who just says I will search for it but now I'm gonna say search it up I'm searching something up and I can't concentrate well on sir did it up I'm doing I don't have my password looking it up searching it up okay I found what I was looking for I searched it up alright so this is a lot of people been putting together resources and there's a slack channel that I know exactly Berman had put together for people teaching online in the age of Cova 19 but Melanie Hoff who is one of the organizers of code societies at school for Porter competition and alum of the ITP program and if you don't if you don't know her work you should check out her work but she put together this really excellent arena compilation of all sorts of resources for people who are teaching online so I just wanted to highlight that you can find it at arena slash Melanie hoff slash teaching online so I would like to come back and add and and maybe if there's time left over at the end I will answer some questions some nice questions came in on Twitter and maybe next week I can make this the subject of an entire live stream but today I will be doing my PI day challenge Oh Oh silly me silly me the thing that I'm searching up is available playlists no private liked videos I gotta search it up okay the other thing I want to mention is that I am deep into whoops whoops that shouldn't say one it should say why I got to fix this I can fix this I'm working on a entirely new set of nature of code videos in JavaScript with p5 these are renewed urgency Ruiz that I made almost eight years ago at this point or actually eight years ago and so if you're new to the channel expect a lot of new videos to come out related to this you can actually see they're all there already so if the video has a thumbnail that kind of all that means as well a thumbnail was made a description is there I made sure the code is online it's linked but if you want to kind of get ahead you can see all of these videos are there and then the forces of the chapter two has started as well so one thing that I want to say about these videos that some of them are unlisted and some of them are listed especially if a video is unlisted and there's a significant mistake or issue with it please let me know because if it's unlisted it's very easy for me to delete and reupload a fixed version if it already published video it's harder for me to do that but if there's a real significant issue I will do that okay I'm also gonna have to sing oh my ukulele tuners battery is gone we have to do some pi day singing maybe today eating of some pie who knows I'm out of sorts people out of sorts I searched it up but I couldn't find it Chris ray asks are you going to remake genetic algorithm chapter uh not probably no you know no I don't think so so the genetic album chapter is actually something that I revisited more recently so there might be some added videos or I might swap in and out a new version of one of those videos but for the most part that's going to be can stay what I made a couple years ago but I do have some ideas for some additional ones all right so the first thing that I want to do is I want to find myself a text file with 1 million digits of hi let's try this this is good 1 million digits of pi just going to have to trust that this file is correct let's put it on the desktop and I want to find a 1 billion 1 billion digits of pi I don't think I want to try with twenty two point four trillion that would be nice tied at 1.5 billion this looks like it might be good oh here we go PI billion this is gonna be a much larger file right is gonna download it effectively let's do it this way okay this file is almost a gigabyte and I have about two minutes left to download it ok ah recording twodisc time start recording and multi quarter I am NOT going to record to disk the whiteboard view which I think you are now seeing I'm not I don't have my preview up anymore because I keep moving things around and here we are over here okay let's see does the whiteboard actually working it is there it looks pretty crooked to me I'm like skip using the whiteboard today we'll see so this is my plan so fathom information design org maybe no oppai de fathom comm probably no all right fine fathom pie pecan pie dot info fathom dot info / pie this is where we are hi I am dot info and in case I did forget which I did forget lend me also before I get started coding say thank you to glean org the sponsor of today's coding train live stream I will so brilliant is a wonderful website and app and all sorts of where you can learn a lot of stuff and by the way if you need to learn things remotely these days this is a really good tool for you to use but they have some new courses that I'm excited to share with you and I always have a daily challenge I always love to do brilliants daily challenge and that's something that I will be attempting about halfway through this livestream okay now and if it wasn't clear if you want to take a look at brilliant go to brilliant dot org slash coding train and that will let them know that you found this from from here and it will also get you a 20% off even you can sign up for free but if you're interested in the premium subscription you can get 20% off through that URL the first 200 people to do so okay so I want to make my own yeah Thank You Simon so though I know that's one of the reasons why I don't want to use the whiteboard today there's something going on with the lighting in this room what I am interested in attempting to do is make my own version of this wonderful peek inside pi web application that was created by fathom information design and so if you don't know about fathom it's a wonderful design firm cuffs started by Ben Frey who is one of the creators of processing itself and so here what I can do is I can look for any sequence of digits and find where they occur in PI so I'm gonna type 1 4 and we're gonna see if there they are it's the first digit of pi and so if I keep searching there we go but use their 1 4 1 5 9 but instead of 2 1 4 1 5 9 6 and it was found as the 731 thousand of thousands 406 digit of pi so this is good for us to find because I now want to recreate this exact thing I'm going to load in a file with 1 million digits of pi and then I want to create an interface where I type this in I'm gonna have to say all this again but I'm getting myself set up because I'm gonna do that I'm gonna want to create an interface where I type this in and I want to find where if that sequence exists in the number of digits of pi that I have and if so where and while I'm going to this in JavaScript while I could just use the built in index of function I'm going to write my own search in a string algorithm because um once I get to 1 billion digits am I going to run into performance issues and so here it is this was one of the spy day suggestions and in this suggestion there's also another website I think that's actually where I downloaded the digits from it looks like but there's also other algorithms one known as Boyer Moore which I actually have never heard of until I saw it posted which may be which optimizes this kind of bruteforce search so I don't know if I'm gonna have time to actually implement this and yeah hash and yes is asking that's crazy you can't load this PI file into the browser correct so I will be using a node server once I get to the 1 billion digits ok so this is the plan and I'm gonna I would like this to be all one video so all of that explanation unfortunately for you the live viewer I'm going to kind of read start hopefully say it more succinctly and then just get to coding and hopefully I'll be done by an hour and a half from now take a short break about a half an hour 45 minutes from now and then this will get edited and put together into a video to be published on Saturday any questions so many questions ok what start this over got my p5 sketch peak in PI 1 billion digits PI search page I take challenge all right okay um I think I'm ready bill hem is asking why is he not using processing for this good good point good question I could use processing for this I feel like using the browser so I could do this in processing I could do that as a followup video I'll mention it that's it that's actually a great question okay mmm here we go shake it up shake it off shake a wee little we got happy pi day welcome to today is this year's 2020s coding train pi coding challenge and i thank you to fatima Bemis who suggested this idea find a sequence in pi so this is the challenge I'm going to take on for this year's Pi Day I'm saying the same thing many many times I get one chance to start over one time I get to start over now used I I used the ukulele last year this will be more just coding coding coding okay hi day hello welcome to 2020 pi day coding challenge thing that I'm about to do oh I really got to get going because if I keep restarting this we're gonna be a big trouble because I have to no matter what leave at 330 there's no and I mean when I say 330 I mean I mean so I should really be saying three I really gotta leave by 330 okay happy pi day it's 2020 this year's pi day it's today and I would like to do it's not really today cuz I'm recording this couple days early but I would like you to see this on pi day a coding challenge themed around the number pi and thank you to fatin Bibi's who suggested this one pi day find a sequence in pi issue number one for 64 if those numbers are where they are in PI who will find out by the end of this video how to look at how one might search for any given sequence of numbers in PI this can lead to a lot of other things like what if those numbers were encoded as music or what if music was encoded as numbers or if you took a text a message and encoded those numbers could you find secret messages in PI melodic phrases in PI there's so many creative possibilities that you could create from my code I'm gonna do something really really basic now I'm in this suggestion this particular website I'm an geonet slash pi is mentioned it has a bunch of different resources a resource of where you can download all the digits of pi a place to search for pi but i this this whoops and it point edit point this is what's going to be edited out it'll be funny if we actually keep that in c ah meta meta this all reminded me of a wonderful project from fathom information design so if you don't know about fathom their information design firm based in Cambridge Massachusetts founded by Ben Ben Frey who was one of the creators of processing itself can find out more at fathom dot info but they created this project peek inside Pi which you can play with at PI fathom info there's also an app version a lot of the versions I'll link to all those things in the video's description so the idea here is that I can type I could tap can I tap let's see if I can fake it looks no the point is for any given sequence like one four one five nine look I can search for it right here and there it is it's found at the first digit of pi so now let's pick another sequence like what's a wonderful sequence it is today's date is March 14 2020 and that is not in the first 1 million digits of pi ah if we had more digits I must have more digits so this particular web app is searching through the first 1 million digits of pi and that's what I want to create first let's just try this so the number 0 3 oops 0 3 1 4 2 oh 2 is available is found Simon's Simon's Simons interrupting my flow you're interrupting my flow with all the at mentions we all the only really urgent at mentions please but he doesn't Simon does have a great suggestion did it to do good I'm told that I should search for the number nine nine nine nine nine nine which is the 760 second digit of pi so let's remember that and make sure when I write my own version of this that I find the same digit so I'm gonna do this at Fir I'm gonna do this with p5.js JavaScript the browser I'm it's not gonna be as nicely designed with a beautiful interface like this but I'm first going to recreate this exact thing and then and then what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go from 1 million digits to 1 billion digits and see if I could still search for edge in PI and probably I'm gonna fail because we're gonna need some kind of like optimization it's gonna only run to slow everything's gonna come crashing down but I'm gonna try nonetheless and we'll see where we get to by the end of this video and I should mention just in case I don't end up covering it there are optimal ways to search for a string to search for a string inside of a larger string and one of those algorithms called the boy or more algorithm and so depending on where I get I would get to the end of this video I don't know why I'm talking about this now it's not the end I'll know where I've gotten to depending on where I get to that might be something that you could also do as your own as a contribution when I know that could also be something that you do as your own contribution on the coding train com itself by making a optimized version of this alright okay here we go let me just put this in applications I'm starting with a simple p5 sketch and two text files one with 1 billion digits of pi which is just a megabyte and one with 1 billion digits of pi which is a gigabyte that's a much bigger file so let's start with the one megabyte file I've uploaded it I've uploaded that file to the p5 web editor and I can load all the text from that file right now using preload I'm going to just take away animation here I'm going to get rid of the draw loop and I'm gonna say no canvas and then the file itself has all of the digits of pi in one line buttload strings loads text files into an array with each element of the array being a different line of the text file so what I'm going to do here is create a variable called digits and just say it is the first element in that raw data array let's console.log digits and just see what happens okay so all of the digits of pi are down here in the console now what I want to do is search for a given digit let's make an interface a very very crude simple interface for searching so now I have this tiny tiny search box up here can I make that bigger this is one of the things I hate give me a second here this is one thing I don't love about using the web editor because can i zoom an iframe can I just make that bigger can I do it with the CSS I don't want to go crazy here if I do something like just say what is it like text size or something I don't know CSS somebody tell me how to put some global CSS font size okay no that seem to work but I didn't make the text file do I need to do it for like input hey there we go perfect that's probably bigger than I need there we go that's plenty visible now okay I also just added a like I also just increased the font size for any input element on the page so it's a little easier for you to see but that's you know the interaction that I'm looking for is anytime anyone types anything into that search box I want to look for that string that that those digits in PI itself and p5 GS has a special event function called input which you can call on the search box and pass another function that will be executed anytime a change has been made so let me write that search it up function because that's when I was looking for something I say search it up and then I'm going to be a little silly and make these global variables and I'm going to then then let me get what I'm searching for from the search box and console.log that so now whenever I type anything into that search box I should see what I type here in the console and that's working this is gonna actually be a really easy project to do you know why because I could just use the index of function in JavaScript to tell let me do that real quick just please please guys real quick I'll bet you that real quick digits index of search so this is saying look inside this search string and give me back the index of where oh no no this is saying look inside the long string digits and give me the index of wherever this string search happens to appear if it doesn't appear I'll take a negative one please so I'm gonna say create let's make another element on the page and No how do I make that people I don't know CSS at all help me out here the leaf it's making it red when it's wrong font color no color should be collar right I mean I could make a background color that I know will work no oh this is wrong oh I need another that's a wrong number of digits I'm the worst I'm the worst there we go okay yeah just don't so now when I get that index back I can say index P dot HTML that index which will put the actual index where it's found in the paragraph text there on the webpage so for example if I say one four one five nine hmm why does it think two so really when counting the digits of pi what seems to be the convention is the first digit is the first digit after the period so it's three point the first digit is one so I should really say index minus one and now one four one five nine I got one and then what if I say nein nein nein nein nein nein I got 200 all right so we got it man nine nine ninetynine appears at the 760 second digit in pi I'm also going to write a little if statement here say if index is greater than well I guess if I'm looking for three if that's a bug so if I'm looking for three that's a zero which minus one how do I do I want to handle that bug index of must let me start searching from a certain character right start from index great so if it's a three I don't want it to find that zero digit so I'm gonna start searching from index to and there oops great so I guess I hope that's right but a 3a doesn't appear until the chat is also rightfully pointing out that I could just chop off the first two digits of the string it would be much too easy I'm gonna do it this way so I'm gonna start from looking at digit two and I'm going to say as long as index is greater than zero set that otherwise say I'm going to say otherwise I'll put a message about it not being found okay so let's try one four one five nine nine nine nine nine nine nine not found so I now have essentially without the care and thought into the interaction design the visual design the layout of the page all of those elements recreated my my own version of this peek inside by I got this videos not over them I got two more things I want to do number one is I want to just investigate what does it mean for me to actually perform this search myself to write my own index of function because maybe if I do that might unlock some other creative possibilities and also I might learn something about programming and then once I do that let me increase things up to 1 billion digits and see if this still works which it won't and I'm reading the chat I shouldn't be reading the chat let me increase things to 1 billion it's and see what happens what breaks down once I have a 1 gigabyte file that I'm loading all the digits of pi in as opposed to 8 1 megabyte file right so let's first write our own index of function so I'm just going to change them to comic this out and I'm going to say let index equals index of a search in this string for this search string okay so search in the string digits for the string search and so the function looks like this it's named as an ex uh it needs to receive a block of text and the substring that you're searching for in that text okay I'm thinking about this let's say we do this let's start with what's the first character in the search string then I want to iterate over the entire string of text and say hey does this character in the entire string of text match the first character of the search string if so I need another loop with J starting at I plus one well actually let's do it this way let's bending to loop through all of the characters of that search string I don't have an error here bad assignment Oh they supposed to say four so I don't need to start at zero because I've already checked to make sure that's zero and I want to check is text car at I plus J the same as search car at J again I'm I'm not worrying about running this optimally or elegantly I just want to get the core idea out I'm starting with and I really should use the whiteboard for this do I dare a whiteboard is all like weird and shadowy this light for there's like a nice bright light that's always been in this room that is very dim today is it oh you can't even see that that's of sad 3.14159 let's say I'm looking for the string for one five so in the example and building this is the text let me just start over okay that person is I feel like a water they should be riding the water a little bit longer I would kind of short what comes after the nine people is it I hope it's so let's say this is my text and what I'm looking for is I want to find out where is 4 1 5 in that particular string this is my search sorry my watch is buzzing at me and I am going to turn that off okay okay uh I'm a jolly happy person I'm not actually bothered by anything I just like to play act okay so this is my text and this is my search string what I have going on here is I know the first character of what I'm searching for is four so I the index I is starting here and looking is that for as that four is that four is that four aha this is for now let's let's save our let's save this spot and then based on this length three which let's let's iterate over this length with J zero one two and let's add j2i zero one two and see if all those digits continue to match okay so ultimately really what I'm looking for here is any things any of those digits that aren't the same so I really want to look for first I'm gonna be very strict about this and use the triple equals there's a funny thing in JavaScript if you haven't encountered this before where if I use double equals this will return true but if I use triple equals they won't so it's a little like double equals is a little bit of a fuzzier truth and triple equals like no no no no those things are really really really really equal fuzzy or equals I guess I don't know if that's necessary to explain I can probably edit that out and then I'm going to say not equals so basically I'm I'm going to make a I'm going to make a guess that I found it right as soon as I find that as soon as I find the first character as soon as I find the first character be the same aha I found it and then any time I find any need to be different I can now say found equals false so the question becomes right here if found is true then I can break out of things and once one is not true I don't need to check the rest so I can break out and then if found return what so I'm gonna say let found index equals negative one I'll give a default value of negative one and then actually if I've found it right here found index should equal what I wherever we started with I and then a little bit lost in terms of all the loops going on here and then if I've gone through every possibility and I haven't found it then I'm gonna get to the end and I'm still just going to return negative one but found index will have negative one so if I found it somewhere I'm gonna set it equal to that first index get out of the loop I don't need to check anymore because I just looking for the first instance and then return what I found I must have made a mistake here somewhere right there's no way this could be correct and I'm gonna add a third argument for offset and I can say and just as a really quick hack I'm just gonna start at index equals two to skip the three I mean whatever let this is fine let me just start it ah let's run and see if this works No found is not defined sketch line 22 this if statement has got to be inside here right this is where I'm looking at every single character in the large string I'm searching through as soon as one of those characters is equal to the start check every check all the subsequent characters and then if I found it break out of that larger loop and keep going so that this should be right now I'm sure there's other mistakes but that will be fixed all right one four one five nine at digit number one which is right weirdly enough I didn't subtract out the one anywhere right so the chat is giving me a nice quick optimization that the chat is give me a nice suggestion where I could simplify this code where I don't actually need this found index because I could just return I which will automatically break out of the loop and then if I get to the end I could just return negative one so let's try that again yeah why is that one shouldn't that be zero one shouldn't that be getting to oh I'm already subtracting the one there great great so this works let's try the 999 thing there we go so this is done and this algorithm has no problem with 1 million searching and a string of 1 million characters be interesting to think of what is the try it different number twothirty excellent I'm gonna be taking a break soon I'm trying to think Oh Thank You Simon about the noting the thing about brilliant I will check that big onotation one thing I'd like to think about here is what is the Big O notation for this particular algorithm so when I talk about Big O notation why is it Oh again order that's what I thought okay one of the things that I would love to consider here is what is the Big O notation for this particular algorithm Big O for the order of the algorithm how long how many computational cycles are required to search for a string of n characters in a larger string also of of n characters boy yeah way is there any moderators here it can help me with this report oh and and yeah oh okay I'm trying to moderate this know if anybody wants to help me with that that would be great oh my god so many of them are there no moderators Ally watching it okay Topher jay is here thank you thank you to forge a train whistle for you right so let's think about this I'm gonna start this thought over so before I move on I want to think about the Big O notation what I mean is what is the order what is the computational complexity of this particular search algorithm so I have a string I'm searching through and it has its length is n the characters and then I'm searching for another string whose length is M characters and when work when considering Big O notation the idea is to think about the worst case scenario how long does it take if I'm not going to find it basically or if I find it at the very very end of that string so I know I need n checks 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 all the way up to N so it is at least Big O order n but for every one of these I've also got to check I mean if I find one of them I've got to check all of these so really I think it should be how like if this 10 digits here and there's 3 digits here that's 30 checks 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 now of course it's less than that because I only had to check these three when I see the four matches but imagine if this whole string were fours and then this were also before I'd always have to keep checking so it's really just n times n n times M and let's remember that for when we start looking at 1 billion digits Oh so is that like reduced to just saying n yeah you know I know there's some BOTS in the chat I apologize about that I have like really not usually had this problem so I've never had to sort of deal with it but there's some folks on the case here so hopefully we could do know it's crazy as the bots or just like it's confusing because what they're doing is they're taking other chat messages that other people have posted and then re posting them with some extra emojis it's kind of amazing I don't know how to permanently ban an IP so we'll see what we do okay yeah and let me say that and even though ultimately the order is the big onotation is n times m because the idea here n is going to be so much larger than when I'm looking for an M this can be sort of reduced down to a operation of order n which isn't so bad to be perfectly honest so to tie a little bow around this we say that this is Big O notation n for the length of the search string the string that I'm searching in alright so I'm gonna take a short break maybe this will also help us get rid of the bots they're very emotional needs bots and I and I am going to take a minute to tell you about the sponsor of today's a coding a train livestream which is brilliant brilliant is as been a longtime sponsor of the coding training I'm very thankful for having the sponsor it's a website an app and I really enjoy if you're interested in interactive learning as you're trying to do some learning from home these days I this could be a useful website to you they have a lot of online courses and one of the things that I really love is how the courses are interactive so I want to tell you about some some new stuff whoops that is that that to highlight for you that are different than maybe what I've highlighted before and so there's a new calculus in a nutshell course in calculus is a language used by colleges urban planners physicists you need kind of calculus to do stuff on the coding train to describe the world but it's often a lot of formulas and a lot of memorization so brilliant takes a bird'seye view using visual and physical intuition by the way I mix we're going to tell you about the neural network one which is what's playing right now to present major pillars of calculus limits derivatives integrals and infinite sums so in that calculate calculus course there's a lot of sort of background material through interactive lessons I can really support the stuff that I'm doing on my channel I'm really excited about this new neural network course a little behind and talking about in terms of when the videos are autoplaying but what you're seeing here is a couple simple games that you could play interactively in the browser to learn the basics of how neural network functions so wiring up neurons and a process of feedback you can build net where you could get to build your own network that classifies handwritten digits and then there's another game which you just saw called where are my keys so I'm gonna come it doesn't take too long to play something to come back and explain you that one when it comes back on I'll work on my timing next it's really bit of rough week people but this is what I'm talking about in terms of the calculus course being able to play with formulas and visualizations and graphs in an interactive way it's a really fun thing to do and and you know the formulas can be scary but this is really healthy so this is the neural network course so let me tell you about this this key is one which will show up in a minute so the the ideas you'd want to find your keys in a messy room so the tiles the color in as you search and this is still doing the handwritten digits revealing how close or far your last guess was from the keys so it's gonna start so that's what this is so you're looking at ah is that close kind of like hot or cold this game I mean I feel like my kids play this game and basically without any clear indication of how to structure your guess is you can nevertheless get better round after round adjusting your response to feedback eventually finding the keys and this is really analogous to this sort of feedback based process the way that neural networks learn so you can just go right ahead and you can sign up for brilliant for free right now just by going to brilliant org slash coding train if you're in and a lot of the content is there for free so for example something that is for free are these daily challenges I'm gonna try to do one of them right now a Simon was mentioning to me that actually maybe my search string algorithm is part of let me see if I can find his message computer science algorithms archive let's try looking that up brilliant org courses computer science algorithms archive so somewhere in this course maybe maybe there's a section on substring finding when I maybe I need a more a more direct link right or I might have typed in something wrong but I will find it and share it with with the community either here in this live stream or on discord if I don't get to before him but I want to do one of the challenges these are my favorite things to do let's just try the one that's right here what is round and spins with teeth all over so the operation of a system of gears and I've lost my chat here for a second follows only one rule teeth in contact always move in the same direction at the same rate so based on the size you can see us this is run ten revolutions per per minute I guess rpms per second whatever rotations per minute yes ten rotations per minute revolutions one Avenue shoals per minute the larger one rotates at two rpms because the ratio of the size the bronze gear has ten teeth oh it's a number of teeth and the gold gear has fifty teeth okay so oh I think I see what this is gonna be already and the gear system below a set of silver gears injuries having 20 teeth the silver gear on the left turns clockwise at ten rotations what speed and direction will the one on the right half so I'm just gonna be using my intuition here but one thing let's say let's figure out which direction it's going to move so if i zoom in on this for a second this one's moving clockwise so this one will move counterclockwise so this one will move clockwise so this one will move counterclockwise so it's counterclockwise so one of the things that I work on with my kids is like if you're taking a multiplechoice test you can always good to eliminate things so maybe I'm not gonna be able to figure the rest out but I kind of now know it's one of these two now my intuition is it's going to be counterclockwise at ten because ultimately the what is what what is the way to calculate the amount of rotations per minute has to do with the relative ratio of teeth and that one at the right is the same as the ones the left so even if it's like becomes a smaller number which becomes a much bigger number which becomes back to a smaller number it should be ten so I'm guessing it is counterclockwise at ten rpm I hope I'm right about this but like I say it's great to be wrong because when you're wrong that's when you really learn so I should really be happy with being wrong it sometimes can feel a little embarrassing but guess what life is embarrassing all right let's hit submit probably all figure this out much faster than me correct whoo all right and let's see oh look here someone's got a nice explanation and formula which is that okay so I guess you could count the teeth so this is 10 which means this is I should say 40 here but 20 here to think about this there might be an error somewhere here but you can see the idea let's look at some other solutions yeah 20 divided by 10 10 divided by 50 50 by 20 get back to 10 yeah this is a nice extinct way of saying it so anyway if you have some clever ideas Vernal this would be an awesome thing to simulate with p5.js to make this animate that would be really fun to do so if you are interested that would be a great coding challenge to do you could try it and if you have other ideas for great answers to put here you could you could put them here and Florence I'm not going to answer your question about what ide i use you're always just chatting chatting chatting florence okay when is the CNN video coming oh I don't think I artists flowing again I got to take a break let me take a break and see if there's anything I could do if anybody knows Simon is telling me the course is called algorithms during the break I'm going to look for it to see if I can find it if anybody knows any way that I could effectively ban the box more definitively let's see if I can try to do that during the break as well so I'll just say a 5minute break and be back to try to search through a billion digits with no js' in about 40 minutes I don't know if I'll be able to do it but I'm gonna try all right folks I'm starting back up in just a minute or two because my time is super limited so okay I'm back I don't have a lot of time so I'm taking a shortened break a couple of things one is looks like I need to get like something like nightbot or something which is a tool that I can use so maybe manage to chat better the only at present just manually with to like hide users so if the new counts keeping being being made so I'll look for the next time I will look into setting up nightbot for for the next stream somebody please remind me of this in discord if you haven't joined the discord join the discord somebody can hopefully post that that link to the chat right now if you have moderator privileges you can post a link to the discord that's where all of the community activity happens outside of the actual live streams okay this is a very bad idea what I'm going to attempt to do right now because I probably should just call today that was a nice little thing that I made and I could talk wrap it up and talk about other things you could do but I am going to just bear with me I'm going to get myself set up to do a part two of this okay okay all right so what I am so let me let me do something here and we get the browser open oh did I mention by the way so we found it in the algorithms course on brilliant there's a whole course section in the algorithms course under substring searches so oh boy I really wish I had gone through this before where I started today but I will take a look at it and come maybe maybe it'll help come back to it Simon had mentioned DFA and KMP algorithms I don't actually know if it was hard but maybe I can look those up in and offer them as things suggestions okay all right so so you know what I don't know that I'm just in case I can't even come back to just in case this needs to be a twoparter I'm gonna I'm gonna record a little ending as if I'm gonna do the next steps in in a second part so huh I don't like having a time pressure thing definitely do not have enough time we'll see you I might have to come back tomorrow somehow see if I can figure it out okay df8 let me just look at what these are DFA algorithm search string is that anything pattern searching PDF DFA based algorithm and KMP I'll figure that out alright so this really wraps up a small piece of this coding challenge I have made my own version of fathom informations peek inside pi I even wrote my own string search function there's so much more that you could do with this to be creative I mentioned at the top that you could think about what if what you weren't looking for were just numbers but you were looking for some other piece of data that's encoded into numbers so we could you find secret messages in PI or pieces of music and pi are there other kinds of algorithms that you could explore that you could optimize this particular search algorithm with foot with and I'll list some of those in the video's description that's a little challenge out to you to research some of those and tell me about your favorite substring search algorithm in the comments but those are going to be needed for when I take the next step and attempt to get this working with a billion digits of pi and for that I'm also going to need a node server so I'm going to come back and do that in a part two to this video it might be right there for you to watch right now but if you're kind of watching this right when the video came out it's probably not there yet but don't worry I'm definitely getting to this one so stay tuned for a part two where I don't even know I've done it yet so it might not actually work but I'm gonna do my best to get a version of this working where I can search for any sequence of digits within 1 billion digits of pi and from there the sky of pi is the limit let's see you soon all right I don't know let's see where I get to I'm Annie G's read stream I think I can so we'll figure this out later it's good to have a plan okay I just need like a little extra time today I'm so close I'm not leaving you don't have to say goodbye all right I have an idea I have an idea so here I am in the sketch I wrote previously what do I do I'm really I'm obsessing just so you know I'm obsessing in my head about what this is gonna become later but you really should enjoy just let the let the coding flow let it just happen Oh today is one of those days I'm really having a hard time okay yeah this is gonna be it's gonna be two short videos part 1 and part 2 or not I don't know I can't decide so here's what I have so far I made this sketch where if a digit appears in the first so here's what I have so far I made this sketch no go away Apple thingy so here's what I have so far I've made a sketch where if I type in any sequence of digits like eight three six five one eight up it'll give me the index into the first million digits of pi where that sequence can be found or if it's not found it'll tell me it's not found and I'm doing this by just loading a text file with the first million digits of pi and searching in it so at the very least I could be like okay let's run this exact same code but now let's take a text file that has a billion digits of pi so I'm gonna go back to add file here and I'm gonna go back to my file system ignore that part and I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna find my billion billion dollar write my billion digit PI file drag that into the browser here and mmm well I'm surprised and not really getting an error message or anything but the web editor will not let you upload a file that big and even if it could am I really gonna expect my clientside code to load well one a one gigabyte file with a billion characters in it now this plenty weighs probably that file could be compressed encoded a different way I probably get down to like 600 megabytes or something but that's not really my concern my concern is how can I load that file into memory Oh David you're here I'm still here welcome but whether it's 600 megabytes or a gigabyte I've still really got the same problem I have this like huge file so rather than try to work with it clientside in any type of clever way I'm just going to use a node application by the way I could probably do this in processing because a desktop piece of desktop processing is not gonna have any problem loading a really large file but I want to stay into JavaScript I'm going to create a node server that can load all the digits store them into memory and then my clientside JavaScript code could query that node server now if you've never used node before I do have a few basic beginner tutorials about installing node and getting setup with node and I'll refer you to those but I'm gonna start from the point where I have a directory with a blank javascript file a package of JSON files to describe my project that I'm building and both a million digit and billion billion digit file of Pi so I'm gonna start by working in index touch I asked to write some code to load that file so first I need to require the filesystem module and one thing that I could just do is just with the million digits of pi let's just read file sync let's just read the whole file in and see what happens Oh interesting so the file has been read in but look how it's being displayed it's giving me the binary information into the console so I want to tell it that I want to read it as a string and I'll use utf8 so that's a second argument to read file sync and now here we go and there's all those digits of pi all those 1 million digits now let's just change it to why not keep it to a billion what could possibly go wrong Oh interesting did something but it didn't print anything out so I know this is just basically a bad idea I don't know whether something crashed or memory ran out but read file sync for a gigabyte file is not a good idea and I think what I want to investigate here is create stream create read stream so let me just look for that let's just find this page no this is I don't want this page I just want the documentation page here we go so I'm on the node documentation page read stream or create yeah here we go create read stream so create read stream is a function I can call to create eight so create read stream is a function I can call to open up a stream for reading the file so I can read it bit by bit I can kind of track how long it's going to take and get what I want and piece it together just gives me a lot of options so let me do that by saying stream equals FS create read stream and let's go back to the million and then once I have a stream I believe that I can basically handle different events so for example I can say stream on data that's when anything is actually coming in I can then have a callback function and just console.log the data I've got a problem why is there a four space tab what happened what happened to you visual studio code I can't deal with it the number of spaces a tab is equal to 2 based on the file contents when editor detect and indentation is on somebody help me I can't take it CJ are you out there somewhere I'll see Jason the chap help me help me I can't go on I can't go on maybe there's something wrong before space is I just I can't handle it mind if I tag here tab sighs where do I get the board I just hit the JSON file though the interface has changed I'm so confused oh there we go tap size 2 to 4 now save truetrue okay okay bottom right bottom right bottom right bottom right uh here we go thank you how do we change this and don't use a spaces whoo thank you everybody oh no no huh well went back there we go okay we're okay now I don't know how do I permanently change that yeah okay I don't know why I don't know what I don't know what's going on okay we're back so now if I run this hopefully I'm gonna see all those digits streaming out I'm still just gonna use the million the million digits file okay oh I'm getting I'm getting the binary data so probably I can say just data to string rate so that's the million digits of pi you're in I'm sort of curious to do console.log like how big are the chunks that it's reading this in yeah you can see so you can see these are the chunks that it's reading the data and they're pretty large because I put some line breaks in between each each each chunk of the stream in fact I think a lot of examples use the word sort of like a chunk here so now let's try 1 billion digits of pi yeah okay we have 1 billion digits up hi boy this is taking a while oh there we go all 1 billion digits could I possibly just put them all into one string and then uhhuh if I have stream on I believe it's end I think there's an end and a closed and by the way if this arrow syntax isn't familiar to you it's a nice way of writing callback and anonymous functions and there's a lot more to it than that and I have a whole video about arrow functions you could watch let's just do digits dot length and see if we get 1 billion digits digit is not defined data digits and look at that it's 1 billion in two because the three and the one don't actually count okay now let's just search for a digit ah I might be able to finish this fast fast fast huh I gotta start a web server and all that kind of stuff okay okay okay let's grab my index of function that I wrote previously and bring it into the node code and then let's look for I'm just going to hard code this let's search what was I looking for nine nine now let's look for $9.99 and then index of digits search and then console dot log index 763 old minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 minus 1 ok so that worked now here's the thing that didn't take very long because that is actually found at 760 does anybody know of a sequence of digits that's very very far into the sequence of a billion digits that would be helpful to know while you're thinking about that for those of you who happen to be watching this live not in the recorded video that you right now not you watching this live but you're watching this later or watching let's just quickly add in a web server so I can make a call to ask for the location of a given digit yeah yeah yeah yeah where's my very basic example take a selfie app this works okay so in this video I'm not going to go through all of the pieces of adding a web server and how HTTP requests work and get requests and response and all that stuff but guess what if you're interested in a much lengthier series about all of the details lemon add quickly right now you can find that in the working with data and AP is in JavaScript a learning playlist that I have on this channel but for now I'm gonna go and copy paste but I'm copy pasting from the code that I have for those examples right here I want to create an express app so I'm gonna add an Express app I want I don't need this database stuff so I just need to create an app Express I want to listen that port 3000 and then I need just a get request so I'm gonna grab this I just want to handle one route I'm gonna say get whenever I do I'm gonna just call this route search and then here how do I find the digits wait hold on yeah requests not body oh I just need a simple get request we're how do I do that thing you thinking a Bob where if it's got parameters does that not in this example and in this example yeah this is what I'm looking for sorry I want this one yeah okay actually I'm gonna call this pie and then I'm going to use one of those things called rusty and routes something like that to look for some sequence of digits in let's call it search let's keep it with search some sequence of digits and what's going wrong here oh this needs request params digits right it's not how that works yeah so basically I have a simple get request when if ever I run this server any time somebody navigates to search slash some sequence of digits I'm gonna pull out those digits and just send them back so let's run this server and let's get rid of I'm gonna get rid of just this I'm on end stuff right now I don't need this actually I'm just gonna write console.log billion digits loaded and let me run the server mmm err oh I've got to install Express so Express is a nice framework for making web servers and node then we run it again so I'm listening at port 3000 the bindle billion digits are loaded I'm gonna go to localhost 3000 there's nothing there but now if I go to slash search slash 1 like 4 3 3 to 5 or I see it I got it and I sent it back guess what I can do now this is really exciting so now if I go back to sorry everybody hmm so if I take this code where I was searching before and I bring it up here and I can say search equals request params digits search for it within the digits and then send that response back but ultimately I want to turn make this JSON so I'm gonna say index I'm gonna make this a nice little JSON object and I'll also send back what was the search string as well so let's try this one more time and let's switch to a million digits to make this I know that it runs faster so I'm going to just change this to a million digits go back to the browser hit refresh oh I've got to restart the server go back to the browser and there we go this particular sequence of digits was found at that index let's double check this with fathoms peak in PI the digits were 4 3 3 2 4 it's found at the 35th thousand third at the 35th thousands 570 second digit of pi is that what I got yes that's what I got so my search is working and now let's change it well let's get it working from our interface first then we'll try it with a billion digits so now I don't want to just do this by hard coding this into the browser I want to go back to my p5 code and in my p5 code I'm not going to load the data file there I don't even need to do the search there so index of can go to way go away but whenever I want to search it up instead of actually running the search I'm going to make a get request so I'm gonna say load JSON the the URL is and HTTP well let's just grip Gravatt localhost colon 3000 slash search and then add in the actual search value this is a string literal which is an incredibly convenient way to put a variable into a string I'm gonna I'm gonna call low JSON got results and then when I get the results the result comes back in index and that is where I'm going to put it in the paragraph get rid of these things I don't need so basically this is just the interface and the interface whenever interface goes and asks the server to look in the digits with the server being the one that can handle holding on to those billion digits so but I need to host this webpage and the way that I'm going to do that it's use express the same Express server that is serving up the digits of pi that the index value into the digits of pi to serve up these web pages and that I can do with adding like Express static somethingorother let me go look back to my older tutorials about this it's right here app got use Express static public so I want to host everything that's in a directory called public which happens to be what I just called it back into the server there we go and you can see I have this the p5 sketch that I've been working with is in the directory public we don't need this million digits of pi anymore there it's not part of the clients at all just part of the server let me restart the server let me go to localhost 3000 mmm uncaught error raw is not defined so I've got some errors in my p5 code oh I don't need the digits no longer belongs here there's some weird extra error about style dot CSS I'm not concerned with that let's just get rid of that there we go okay now ooh okay it's searching it's always finding negative 2 because it's searching for this like what what weird that come from where did I put that in by accident oh look at that oh it's just an extra that I had actually in the string that goes away by go away it works it's searching in PI but the searching is happening on the server so now it's time this is the grand finale of today's coding train hide a challenge we are going to search in 1 billion digits of pi to find any given sequence of digits it is time I'm going to do it to go back to my server code close anticlimactic I'm gonna change it to loading the billion digits of pi I'm gonna restart the server I got to wait it loaded the billion digits it's now waiting for me going back to the webpage let me just refresh this webpage and I don't know let's try searching question is has it found it no it didn't find that so Kim somebody's a fact checks this for me is that sequence not in the first billion digits of pi that sequence is not either it was finding it before yep it found that one so this so far is the longest sequence I've been able to find let me just change this to a five and found that it takes a while it's slow it's slow David suggested a string two oh seven seven five five one zero let's see if that works oh seven seven five five one zero there this is at digit number 176 million eight hundred sixtysix thousand three hundred and seventy seven that's pretty good I suppose I could look up in that text file I have well I have an idea let's look at what's in that text file the last few digits digits dot well let's start digits dot length minus ten I could use like substring or something but I'm just like afraid so let me print out the last ten digits in the first billion digits of pi wait what just happened there oh no no digits car car at okay I really have to be like this I'm doing this in the weirdest most nonsensical way so with a little detective work I have determined that these are the last ten digits in the first billion digits of pi so just to see how slow is the searching I'm gonna refresh this page and I'm going to paste those last ten digits in here and we're gonna see how long it takes there we go it found it and that's not so terrible so we can't even with my crude bruteforce algorithm find any sequence of digits in the first 1 billion digits of pi by having both a server and client talk to each other so many possibilities here how could you optimize the search algorithm how could you make the API do all sorts of more fun creative things to give you more information about what's in pi could you put this on to glitch so we could maybe we could make this like the glitch is a hosting website that allows you to deploy different kind of creative web applications so maybe I could make a version of this that runs on glitch that people could remix I will include a link to that if I can get it to work in this video's description and you could just be much more creative about the interface and once again what are you actually really searching for could you search for secret messages in PI by thinking about encoding text into digits music in PI by encoding musical notes and melodies and rhythms into digits colors in the digits what data could you search for in PI and what what wonderful things could you discover that way and maybe you could find a text file with more than a billion digits and make your own version that searches into even larger number of digits of pi I hope you enjoyed this pi day coding challenge I will sing you out with my song about the last ten digits in the first 1 billion digits of pi which has not been rehearsed or planned and as ukulele hasn't even been tuned in like a month so I really hope this doesn't end up in the video and get to edit it out instead what did I do last year no we're not gonna do the song I don't have time I'll come back tomorrow and do the song if I have time thank you for watching this coding train coding challenge pi day thanks to fathom information design for the inspiration with peeking inside Pi and thanks also to Fontan bibi's and all of all of you watching this live on the lan during the livestream with all of the suggestions and help that you offered I'll see you soon next time on the coding train have a great day ride all aboard all that nonsense look that catchphrase it's coming one day oh this is my country it's not a phrase it's a sound train whistle sound that's my country's okay alright everybody I am really under the gun in terms of time because I have to pick up my daughter at school at 420 settle down people that's the actual time I have to go pick her up and it takes me a little while to pack up everything and it takes me a little while I'll take the subway or walk there depending on what's happening with the subway I mean if I don't actually definitely don't have to it's a 45minute walk from here so there's no way I can walk the subway so thank you everybody I'm gonna just like quickly race out of here I'm gonna be doing that's I'm gonna be doing some coding in the Cabana video soon I was gonna spin the wheel I'm like you're like a quick I'd be home alone it seems like the way things are coping as I discussed what good vienna's livestream is I'm not gonna be able to be at work the studio is often or perhaps never for the top for a period of time so I might try to figure out live streaming from home I might make more just putting the Cabana videos stay tuned please join the discord where I will announce all this stuff and all of that and so I will see you all soon thank you for watching this I don't know if this is gonna be able to get edited together into something by Saturday if it can't then it can't but I'm gonna give it a try so stay tuned wait for Saturday and we'll add some extra fun things in it you have any creative ideas want to participate in that join the discord join the discord join the discord borrow everybody well I'm not ready to leave you I'm gonna hit stop recording I'll leave it open for a second while I do some of my cleanup stuff stop cording I hope this worked what are you gonna do if it doesn't the problem yeah the hole 1 million subscriber thing you got to deal with that too all right everybody did you see you later time for the diss song thanks again to brilliant sponsor of today's livestream sorry I'm gonna do this this star this star this star this star song never forget the Vista this is somebody compose that song for me I'm gonna say once again coordinates coordinates and autotune and the internet will fix that for me coordinates unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I really lives in my mind I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound all sorts of generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again
