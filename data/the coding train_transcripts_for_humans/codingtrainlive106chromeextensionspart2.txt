00:02 - let's find something we wanna make some
00:06 - crazy idea
00:07 - we'll figure out what it takes to make
00:14 - [Music]
00:25 - [Music]
00:40 - creation
00:52 - [Music]
00:59 - [Music]
01:05 - hello good evening
01:09 - wait Here I am again just as I was this
01:17 - morning but only after a very frantic
01:18 - day so I might be a little bit more
01:20 - disheveled I thought I'd play the coding
01:22 - train intro song just you know the
01:24 - morning was like this serious like I'm
01:26 - gonna do a real tutorial I'm gonna be a
01:29 - good person on the Internet who takes
01:32 - making tutorials seriously it does a
01:35 - very good job and now it's the evening I
01:38 - don't have a lot of time we got about an
01:39 - hour and I want to do two more things I
01:41 - didn't get to this morning one of them
01:44 - is gonna be about kittens the other
01:45 - one's gonna be about p5 my voice you can
01:49 - hear that cold it's kind of a little bit
01:50 - back so let's not overdo it everybody
01:52 - let's relax but I'm gonna be fine my
01:54 - voice is fine I have some water over
02:00 - here and have some sound effects ah here
02:03 - I I guess I'm not bothering to do like
02:05 - my usual like intro blah blah blah blah
02:07 - blah so it did all that this morning I
02:09 - just want to kind of get into it but if
02:11 - you want to mention I'm really looking
02:12 - for a coding train like breaking news
02:15 - sound effect so I feel like what I want
02:18 - to be able to do is like get some
02:19 - breaking news
02:20 - my and then be able to report it so if
02:24 - anyone wants to make for me a good like
02:26 - did you know breaking news sound effect
02:30 - that's absolutely completely ridiculous
02:32 - please let me know please make that okay
02:36 - so uh let's go-o-o echo 34 is saying I
02:41 - sent you an extension I may check it out
02:43 - on my profile echo 34 underscore YouTube
02:49 - okay hold on Twitter actually mmm people
02:54 - sent me a lot of actually interesting
02:55 - things but I'm not logged into my
02:59 - Twitter I'm logged into the coding
03:01 - trained Twitter's here let's look at the
03:03 - notification and see if people sent it
03:04 - to me here
03:05 - so yeah wordless web thank you Gottfried
03:09 - a creator of the processing for the
03:13 - Raspberry Pi
03:15 - oh yes Thank You Nicole first of all I
03:17 - mentioned Nicole he's amazing mystery
03:20 - animal project already you've mentioned
03:21 - it this morning go check out Nicole he's
03:24 - amazing mystery animal project but this
03:26 - is a wonderful chrome extension I wish I
03:29 - had hat had it in my original video I
03:32 - wonder maybe we could splice this in
03:33 - Matt show this probably won't work at
03:35 - all but I'm gonna like talk about this
03:37 - Chrome extension for a second and if it
03:38 - works still I kind of like splice it in
03:40 - to that intro video that's great but if
03:42 - not this is a Chrome extension by
03:45 - Melanie Hoff called decode Elia and I
03:48 - don't know if I pronounced that right
03:49 - it's a Chrome extension and glasses set
03:51 - that uses basic principles of color
03:52 - theory to render your browser's content
03:55 - visible only with the use of red red
03:57 - tinted glasses so you can see here I
03:59 - can't see what's going on here but if I
04:01 - happen to have the red tinted glasses so
04:04 - I could essentially if I'm in a coffee
04:05 - shop and I didn't want anybody to see
04:08 - what I'm doing I could wear my glasses
04:10 - and use my computer without anyone be
04:11 - able to see and this is probably a nice
04:13 - video summary Melanie is an alum of both
04:17 - the school for a poetic computation and
04:19 - ITP the graduate program where I teach
04:21 - so I encourage you to check out this
04:23 - wonderful Chrome extension I just want
04:26 - to see if there's a right so so you can
04:28 - search for some like things on your this
04:32 - is obviously a kind of like an art
04:34 - project but it actually does work I've
04:36 - seen it it's great all right what else
04:39 - echo 34 says I made a Chrome extension
04:41 - for you okay echo that's wonderful and
04:47 - I'm sure that you have posted this here
04:50 - and it's something perfectly appropriate
04:51 - for me to look at in a live stream but
04:54 - it would be helpful if you just gave me
04:55 - a little bit more information I'm sure
04:57 - you know just you know I live in a world
04:59 - where I risk somebody putting making it
05:01 - doing a Chrome extension that as soon as
05:03 - I load it does something embarrassing on
05:04 - the screen which I seriously doubt no
05:06 - one in the audience really and that I've
05:08 - had those intentions but if you could
05:10 - just let me know what it does and maybe
05:13 - I can we can take a look what else is
05:18 - here
05:20 - whoa that's funny all right and so
05:25 - that's I think those are some things
05:26 - that people sent me
05:27 - on Twitter all right Cole if you make
05:32 - that sound effect please make it I'll
05:34 - use it anybody or it could be a I could
05:37 - have a lot of them I would love that
05:39 - okay search to Schiffman on twitter boy
05:42 - see breaking news I hate it right now
05:45 - breaking news I'm being told that you
05:47 - could search on Twitter to : Schiffman I
05:52 - don't need the at Schiffman let's see
05:54 - and there we go and they I can actually
05:58 - just do latest and we can see oh here's
06:01 - an idea and make a QR code out of a
06:03 - bookmarklet that's interesting
06:04 - oh this is an important little
06:06 - clarification I saw in your live stream
06:09 - you used self calling anonymous
06:11 - functions well the reason you have to
06:13 - put in the parenthesis around the entire
06:14 - thing is because the parentheses are
06:16 - returning the object inside as a
06:17 - function and not as a reference thank
06:20 - you for that explanation I think I kind
06:21 - of understand that and also alka let me
06:25 - know that you don't actually need the
06:27 - wrapping function for a bookmarklet but
06:30 - otherwise you can run into scoping areas
06:31 - if you're just sort of in the global
06:32 - namespace all right I could appreciate
06:36 - simply a search engine type thing for
06:38 - your YouTube channel
06:39 - just opens a small window okay let's try
06:42 - it so I'm going to try echo 34 x'
06:46 - extension well this is exciting this
06:48 - we're living dangerously downloads do I
06:58 - have to be able to get this ready a dime
06:59 - oh the camera went off
07:06 - I need a looping snare drum okay oh okay
07:11 - oh yeah hold on here we go
07:12 - we're gonna go to Chrome colon slash
07:15 - extensions we are going to disable this
07:20 - one we are going to load an unpacked
07:22 - extension desktop no downloads Dan's
07:29 - extension select coding trains YouTube
07:32 - feed oh this is really intro I love this
07:36 - okay a excellent version number 0.1 that
07:41 - is the version number that I love as
07:43 - well
07:43 - Thank You Louise in the Patriots as you
07:48 - are on the office big screen for
07:50 - everyone to watch which office and
07:53 - everybody who's at the office go home go
07:57 - to your families and loved ones and
07:59 - friends enjoy Friday I know it's
08:01 - freezing in New York but maybe you're
08:03 - actually in an office in the tropics and
08:05 - you could just go have a nice walk on
08:06 - the beach and make a bonfire and have a
08:08 - salad although I don't think salad is a
08:10 - really good food for eating at the beach
08:12 - to be perfectly honest right I don't
08:14 - know what's a good beach bonfire bonfire
08:17 - that's a little bit scary don't that
08:18 - sounds a little dangerous actually be
08:20 - safe everybody okay version in the
08:23 - pop-up shows points you okay um coding
08:26 - train extension to in enable so how do I
08:28 - make this happen
08:29 - let's see let's just go to YouTube maybe
08:32 - I have to go to YouTube this is it here
08:37 - click it oh look at that I can search oh
08:40 - it's just maybe it's just a look at this
08:42 - so I haven't done pop-ups yet I'm gonna
08:44 - do pop-ups let's look for its person
08:47 - point to mm-hmm
08:52 - version MIT smash there oh but maybe
08:54 - it's just maybe it magically upgraded in
08:56 - the time in between all right visit site
08:59 - where does that take me oh the coding
09:03 - train com so I took me somewhere weird
09:05 - but that's fine let me do this again and
09:07 - I but what so I assume I don't actually
09:09 - have to be on YouTube to look at this
09:11 - let's do this
09:12 - and so video name what's a video I'd
09:14 - like to I love you I love flowers don't
09:17 - have a video about flowers
09:20 - yeah I do I have a bunch that is
09:25 - wonderful the coding train No
09:31 - yay thank you echo this is the coding
09:37 - train Chrome extension maybe we could
09:39 - make a we could put this on github and
09:42 - make a community coding train Chrome
09:44 - extension that'll be great
09:49 - alright so thank you now what am I here
09:53 - to do this evening before up until about
09:55 - 6:30 let's see if I can do both of these
09:57 - things if I go over to my kind of road
10:03 - map here I want to get into popups
10:07 - can't erase this this Hestia this is
10:10 - gonna get erased I was going to take a
10:12 - picture of it but it's in the video so I
10:14 - don't have to I wouldn't get two pop-ups
10:17 - and I want to do the new tab thing but I
10:20 - want to do two coding challenges I want
10:23 - to pause at content scripts only
10:25 - basically and do two coding challenges
10:27 - one whatever webpage you're on it just
10:31 - replaces all the images with images of
10:33 - kittens why not maybe it should be
10:36 - rainbows or unicorns or whatever but
10:38 - let's use do kittens and number two is I
10:41 - want to do a Content script that
10:42 - whatever web page you're on it allows
10:44 - you to draw over it using a p5 canvas
10:47 - and we saw a nice example from that I
10:50 - mentioned earlier today that has a much
10:52 - more sophisticated version so that's the
10:53 - two things that I'm planning to do and
10:55 - I'm gonna do those those coding
10:56 - challenges the question is when I do the
10:59 - coding challenges I like to start from
11:00 - nothing but I could just start from my
11:02 - basic content to know let's start from
11:03 - nothing I'm gonna it's not that much
11:04 - stuff to type and it kind of works that
11:06 - way
11:06 - so we're gonna do two content script
11:09 - coding challenges Chrome extensions well
11:18 - do I hear the train coming into the
11:22 - station
11:23 - it's a train if that's like it should be
11:28 - and then like the train comes in and
11:29 - there's like oh look it's our friend
11:32 - however remember and then the guests
11:34 - would be here but there's there's no
11:36 - guests
11:36 - maybe there's a guest
11:45 - it's completely empty in the hallway
11:48 - there's nobody around I should really
11:52 - just pick up this camera and bring it
11:55 - into the hallway no it's Jude it's too
12:03 - crazy okay back back cohhd cohhd cohhd
12:05 - cohhd cohhd see I was I took it very
12:07 - seriously this morning and I don't know
12:09 - what the point of that was all right so
12:10 - what I need to do is make sure that
12:17 - course like one thing that I need to do
12:19 - is get some kitten images I'm just gonna
12:21 - so this has it this is um Thank You
12:23 - Austin I think who showed me this
12:25 - website called unsplash.com if anybody
12:27 - can fact check me on this I believe I
12:29 - can use these images for free and they
12:33 - are public domain or their Creative
12:35 - Commons or something that I can use them
12:36 - in tutorial so let's get some of these
12:37 - kittens this one looks nice this one
12:40 - looks nice it does have an API and so I
12:44 - think as like a challenge is you could
12:48 - try to get the kids did I just do five
12:50 - I'm just gonna do five and oh they have
12:53 - people's names and them I shouldn't I
12:56 - download a couple of them twice so one
12:59 - two isn't there like that
13:04 - don't say aw aw challenge let me try it
13:08 - you have to like look at the image and
13:11 - not say aw
13:16 - Oh again try to get that alright you
13:23 - gotta love the kittens alright um I want
13:25 - to rename these you know what no problem
13:29 - I'm gonna leave their names because I
13:30 - want the people who took these images to
13:33 - have credit for them so let me grab
13:36 - these and I'm going to go to the desktop
13:39 - I'm going to go to Chrome extensions I'm
13:41 - gonna say Oh three kittens
13:59 - [Music]
14:05 - [Music]
14:07 - by the way I just wanted everyone to see
14:09 - this if I stretch it out did you get it
14:15 - pretty straight all right
14:24 - okay I think I'm ready and let me get
14:33 - Adam open
14:44 - and kittens
14:51 - all right license unsplash all photos
14:56 - published on unsplash can be used for
14:58 - free you can use them for commercial and
15:00 - non-commercial purposes you do not need
15:01 - to ask permission from or provide credit
15:03 - to the photographer or unsplash although
15:05 - it is appreciated when possible place
15:16 - kitten yep
15:17 - Gareth and the chat mentions Gareth and
15:23 - chap Benson's place kitten aye I do know
15:25 - about place kitten and I was thinking of
15:27 - using it but it doesn't seem to be
15:29 - working right now okay
15:31 - so I'm going to remove these extra
15:36 - extensions thank you again
15:39 - echo we use 34 underscore or YT 4 that
15:43 - was awesome
15:44 - if people are interested in doing like a
15:45 - community coding it got Chrome extension
15:48 - I'm open to facilitating that through
15:50 - the coding train github organizations so
15:52 - tweet at me at Schiffman if you want to
15:53 - participate in that now now I am going
16:00 - to uh people are asking about where this
16:04 - song came from what he's asking about
16:06 - that I think I could just make up stuff
16:08 - that people are asking in the chat and
16:09 - you guys won't know but you're watching
16:11 - and you can see the chat leader who
16:13 - people watch this back they won't know
16:14 - somebody was mentioning the song that
16:15 - they liked it but they weren't asking
16:17 - where it was I just made that up I want
16:20 - to show you guys something to which I
16:22 - think you'll find really amusing how can
16:24 - I show this to you mmm ok I have an idea
16:30 - this is kind of you guys are gonna find
16:32 - this to be quite amusing so I am just
16:37 - opening the camera on this webcam so I'm
16:40 - gonna turn it around and I want to show
16:43 - you the wall that's for the cameras this
16:50 - is what I thought would be helpful this
16:54 - morning yes I over here this is the
16:58 - camera this is very like meta now like
17:01 - weird meta craziness whoa
17:05 - I will shake hands with myself but I
17:08 - want this hand to talk to this end okay
17:10 - this is where the camera is this is my
17:12 - sign that reminds me to look here
17:14 - actually I didn't make this sign
17:15 - somebody else made the sign these for
17:18 - office attacks stop from Chrome
17:21 - extensions I thought usually I'd like no
17:23 - stuff off the top of my head and that
17:25 - sounds I don't I can look it up or but I
17:27 - thought let me try this I never I always
17:30 - get the thing where people say like oh I
17:32 - know what you do you you have a second
17:37 - computer and that has all the code and
17:38 - you just retype it which I never have
17:39 - actually done this is my first tip it's
17:42 - not a second computer that must be a
17:43 - much more logical thing to do but a
17:45 - little behind the scenes for you to
17:46 - today's coding train I hope you enjoy
17:48 - that okay I'm gonna come back around I'm
17:51 - over here I'm over here so much going on
17:53 - I'm gonna come back around what we're
17:58 - here now and I'm going to turn this back
18:04 - around and you can see this is me with a
18:07 - green wall for a public Lucchese shirt
18:10 - on and here we go oh this computer went
18:15 - off okay so anyway what do you see me
18:27 - like looking over there to figure out
18:28 - what goes in the manifest but I have no
18:31 - signs for me for the kitten stuff here
18:36 - we go yeah I guess there's a little
18:40 - green screen challenge for you all if
18:42 - you want to do some kind of weird take
18:44 - that video and key out the green that
18:45 - you saw Sarah Sarah alright let's let's
18:50 - go everybody
19:04 - I sorry I've I get lost in this
19:08 - beautiful kittens eyes so I'm gonna do a
19:10 - coding challenge right now and the
19:12 - coding challenge is the kitten eyes or
19:16 - chrome extension kit narrator kitten
19:20 - extension kitten Chrome extension chrome
19:22 - kitten at up I know what to call it
19:23 - somebody give me a name we'll put it in
19:25 - the first comment I'll pin it but I'm
19:26 - going to make a Chrome extension that
19:29 - replaces any image on any website that
19:31 - you're on with an image of a kitten I'm
19:33 - gonna do in a really simple basic way I
19:35 - made earlier today a bunch of tutorials
19:37 - about Chrome extensions I might suggest
19:39 - you go and watch those for more depth
19:40 - but I'm gonna still do this from no code
19:43 - at all the only thing I'm going to start
19:44 - with is these five kitten images and
19:47 - they all come from unsplash.com which is
19:50 - a website with free images these are the
19:52 - images that I have randomly picked for
19:55 - this coding challenge and as a challenge
19:57 - to you after I make this if it's
19:58 - successful you might think about making
20:00 - a version of this that pulls the images
20:02 - dynamically from unsplash or uses
20:04 - something besides kittens or tries to
20:06 - replace the image with the most
20:07 - appropriate kitten that matches what the
20:09 - image originally was I don't know use
20:11 - your imagination but let's get started
20:12 - so the first thing I need for a Chrome
20:14 - extension is what it is a file called
20:19 - manifest.json okay so what do I need in
20:22 - the manifest.json I need to say I need
20:26 - to have all the configuration stuff for
20:28 - my Chrome extension manifest version 2
20:33 - which is the version of Chrome extension
20:36 - whatever that I'm making someday I'm
20:37 - gonna look up what this means but I
20:38 - think it used to put one but now you
20:39 - have to use two maybe someday you'll put
20:41 - three I don't know could you imagine a
20:43 - world in a world where the manifest
20:45 - version is number seven then I'm going
20:49 - to X kittens Gen X kitten shouldn't
20:52 - thank you that's a good good one okay
20:54 - Chrome kittens okay now I'm gonna say
20:56 - named X extension and then X kit tension
21:07 - I think like that X kitten should Chrome
21:09 - X kitten chin that's is not so great but
21:11 - we'll keep this for right now Bo version
21:15 - everybody knows what version this is
21:17 - right now say it with me 1 2 3
21:21 - did you say point 1 yeah that's what I
21:23 - said I don't know whatever doesn't
21:25 - matter and I think I should put that in
21:27 - quotes who knows
21:29 - and then I'm making a Content script so
21:34 - what I need to do is have a Content
21:36 - script and it's content scripts cuz I
21:39 - could have multiple ones so I'm just
21:40 - gonna have one if you don't know what a
21:41 - Content script is you could go look at
21:44 - my previous tutorials which I will link
21:45 - to in the description and my content
21:48 - script this is going to be for see how
21:56 - do I do this
21:57 - Isis hard to talk and think and type at
21:59 - the same time all URLs so I want you
22:03 - might someday want to make a Chrome
22:05 - extension that only replaces kittens on
22:07 - particular websites only place images
22:10 - with kittens but I'm gonna do it for all
22:11 - URLs and then I need to have a
22:15 - JavaScript file where I'm gonna have all
22:17 - my code I think I say J s and then I
22:19 - could have multiple JavaScript files but
22:21 - I'm just gonna have one I'm gonna call
22:22 - it content J yes although you know what
22:24 - no I'm not no no I'm kidding getting
22:27 - done is okay now here's the thing let's
22:29 - just first make sure this works I got to
22:30 - deal with the images that's one thing I
22:31 - didn't do in my tutorials I probably got
22:34 - some syntax wrong here cuz I never get
22:36 - it right but I'm at least going to now
22:38 - make a new file which is called kitten J
22:40 - s and I'm going to just in that say
22:43 - console dot log kittens of the world
22:46 - unite as one okay so I will east now I'm
22:53 - gonna have a Chrome extension that when
22:54 - I go to any web page I will see this in
22:57 - the JavaScript console that's our first
22:59 - step and again if you want some of the
23:01 - details about how this is working go
23:02 - back and watch my I'm gonna stop saying
23:03 - that
23:04 - so now how do I install this I've got to
23:06 - be in Chrome at the URL Chrome colon
23:10 - slash slash extensions
23:11 - I've got to have developer mode enabled
23:13 - and then I can say load unpacked
23:15 - extension I can go and find wherever
23:19 - that was was on my desktop under Chrome
23:21 - extension zero three kittens so I'm
23:24 - going to select that and I didn't get
23:26 - any errors so if I had made a syntax
23:29 - error in manifest.json some
23:31 - stuff would show up here and then it's
23:33 - enabled I'm going to just turn off this
23:35 - other extension that's final leave it on
23:36 - and now I'm going to go to a web page
23:37 - like what's a good web page where we
23:41 - want to replace all the images with
23:43 - kittens I'm afraid to go to a news
23:46 - website although it will be nice to
23:47 - replace everything on the news website
23:49 - with images of kittens let me just go to
23:52 - go to the ITP website for right now just
23:55 - to just to see okay whoa oh this is
24:01 - something else this has nothing to do
24:02 - with me and we can see that this
24:04 - extension is working because kittens of
24:06 - the world unite as one there we go so my
24:09 - extension is working on the next thing I
24:11 - need to do is I need to figure out from
24:13 - my content script I need to look at the
24:15 - content and find all of the image
24:18 - elements on the page now there's
24:20 - probably a variety of ways that you can
24:24 - have an image but let's actually just
24:26 - play with this here for a second let's
24:28 - use the console to kind of like mess
24:30 - around to understand what we want to do
24:31 - so if I say images equal document get
24:36 - elements by tag name IMG hmm Oh images
24:43 - right so we got a bunch there's a whole
24:46 - bunch of images so that's good and we
24:48 - can see images has a property called
24:51 - source I believe somewhere in your boy
24:56 - there's a lot of stuff
24:57 - yes it's an attribute source and you can
25:00 - see that's the source of the image some
25:02 - are at Tisch gift preset square JPEG so
25:06 - what I want to do is look at all these
25:08 - images find that source property and
25:11 - replace what's in there with a URL to an
25:14 - image of a kitten now I'm not just any
25:17 - kitten the kittens that I happen to have
25:18 - as part of my extension of course they
25:20 - could be URLs to other places but I have
25:22 - these particular now I know I could
25:26 - probably load these in like an array but
25:28 - what I'm gonna do is let me just first
25:30 - let's this is gonna there's gonna be a
25:33 - little tedious go make yourself a cup of
25:34 - tea or something for a second so I'm
25:36 - just gonna paste the names of all these
25:40 - kitten images real quick into my
25:43 - I didn't want to change the names
25:45 - because I unsplash I don't have to you
25:48 - do not require to give credit but I
25:50 - can't go to the right place but I would
25:52 - like to give credit these are that I
25:53 - assume presume the name of the
25:54 - photographers maybe this is their
25:56 - kittens I think it so I have five five
26:00 - will be pretty good I think one of these
26:02 - days I'm gonna alt tab to the right
26:03 - thing there we go
26:05 - now I'm gonna grab this one there we go
26:07 - okay so now I've got the images here's
26:09 - the thing files inside just like in
26:13 - manifest.json I have to say ah
26:16 - I want this javascript file to be part
26:19 - of my content script I always also have
26:21 - to say I don't remember somebody in the
26:23 - chat correct me it's something like web
26:26 - accessible resources is that right
26:30 - somebody will correct me alright just I
26:36 - have the file names here - thank you
26:38 - very much that would have been more
26:39 - efficient breaking news somebody I'll
26:41 - have that sound effect okay so I think
26:44 - what I can do now is just let's do
26:46 - something fancy I'm gonna do something
26:48 - fancy just for fun for no reason I'm
26:52 - gonna copy this into here I'm gonna do
26:54 - the fine I'm gonna get rid of all those
26:56 - slash slash space then I'm gonna do I'm
27:00 - gonna use a little regular expression
27:02 - and I'll show you what we do I'm going
27:03 - to do beginning of a line dot star
27:05 - question mark end of line this is a
27:08 - regular expression to find all of these
27:10 - things then I'm going to replace and I
27:12 - just want to do it I'm gonna replace it
27:14 - with and do I need to capture I need to
27:17 - capture this if you don't know about
27:19 - regular expressions might I refer you to
27:21 - my regular expressions tutorial that
27:22 - would pop up right here except there's
27:24 - no way for me to do that unless some
27:25 - magic post-production thing happens I'm
27:28 - gonna replace this is really ridiculous
27:29 - that I'm doing this with quote dollar
27:32 - sign one end quote comma replace off
27:37 - boom now I have an around now I have it
27:39 - formatted to go into an array oh it
27:44 - needs to be double quotes for JSON
27:46 - that's fine uh so find a single quote
27:49 - replace it with a double quote there we
27:51 - go so now I have the web accessible
27:53 - resources and maybe somebody has told me
27:55 - I am being told breaking
27:56 - that is correct alright so web
27:59 - accessible resources so now these images
28:01 - are available to me as part of my Chrome
28:04 - extension so what I want to do if
28:09 - somebody by the way is watching this
28:10 - video could find me a good just like
28:12 - maybe in the in the patron group in the
28:14 - slack channel maybe you could post some
28:17 - links to some web sites that might be
28:18 - good to run this on that have nothing to
28:19 - upsetting or embarrassing on them it's
28:23 - all order I know with the internet
28:25 - family-friendly coding show here
28:27 - everybody so now what I want to do is I
28:33 - lost my train of thought that's really
28:38 - [Music]
28:40 - ok so now what I want to do right so
28:42 - what was I doing over here let's get
28:45 - this I want to do this in the Chrome
28:49 - extension itself now remember a content
28:51 - script and let's say let's say file
28:56 - names and I can get this from that you
29:00 - know there's probably an automatic way
29:02 - of doing this but I am very prone to
29:05 - doing things in silly manual ways so I
29:08 - have an array now with all those file
29:09 - names and I'm going to ask for all of
29:14 - the image elements then then I'm going I
29:19 - know I'm using double quotes and single
29:21 - quotes in the same page don't everybody
29:22 - freak out all at once
29:23 - let's live with it let's come on we can
29:25 - do it double quotes and single quotes
29:28 - can be in the same page and everything
29:30 - will be ok all right now let me say my
29:35 - new favorite thing which is this fancy
29:36 - for loop thing that I learned about
29:37 - recently for image element of images I
29:43 - want to say I'm just gonna actually
29:47 - console.log image element SRC let's just
29:52 - do that so I just want to see the Chrome
29:54 - extension on any page that I'm on give
29:56 - me a list of and I'm just going to check
29:58 - the shot here for a second web
30:04 - accessible resources should be on the
30:06 - top level of the manifest
30:08 - also put them on a folder and just do so
30:12 - these are great suggestions from the
30:14 - chat thank you
30:15 - so let's make some improvements here
30:16 - silly me so first of all this is not
30:19 - necessarily specific to the content
30:21 - script this is a top-level thing for the
30:24 - manifest thank you for that correction
30:26 - and there's no reason for me to do this
30:28 - when I can just say star jpg so this
30:35 - should be better so any images and by
30:39 - the way it would make more sense as I'm
30:41 - being told to make a folder called
30:43 - kittens and that way this is cleaning
30:47 - this up a little bit all of this goes in
30:49 - here then I can say kittens slash so how
30:54 - am i doing think I'm in better shape
30:56 - let's reload the Chrome extension and
30:58 - see what happens so I'm going to go back
31:00 - to here and hit reload right anytime you
31:02 - make changes in your chromic skit
31:04 - insertion hit reload hit refresh and I
31:09 - could see this is some nonsense that's
31:11 - happening nothing to it and I can see
31:12 - look here are all of the images that are
31:14 - on this page now the question is to do
31:19 - the there's gonna be a sizing thing that
31:21 - we have to deal with at some point but
31:22 - I'm not gonna worry about that okay
31:24 - example page image J nih.gov slash Doc's
31:29 - okay hold on let me find this you really
31:32 - need a good way of getting stuff from
31:33 - the slack chat into here can you give me
31:38 - a Google search Ruben to find that page
31:42 - okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm
31:46 - going to I think we're kind of so all I
31:48 - actually need to do is I want to say let
31:51 - R equal math.random times
31:54 - images o filenames dot length math.floor
32:03 - so I don't have not in p5 so I've got to
32:05 - do this with native JavaScript I want to
32:07 - get a random index and I could do this
32:09 - all sorts of other fancier ways I'm sure
32:11 - but I want to get a random math dot
32:13 - random gives me a number between 0 & 1
32:14 - multiply it by the length of the array
32:16 - take off the decimal place and if I have
32:18 - 10 images
32:18 - getting a number randomly in 0 through 9
32:20 - and then I want to say let source equal
32:27 - file names are and then I also need to
32:33 - do let URL so here's the thing I can't
32:35 - just say image alt equals image alt dot
32:42 - source equals source so here's the thing
32:44 - about a Chrome extension these files
32:46 - like where do they live they're part of
32:48 - the Chrome extension the source the
32:50 - source attribute of an image element on
32:53 - a web page has to point to a actual
32:55 - valid path and those chrome extension
32:58 - paths I live probably they're like a
33:00 - weird thing that we don't know it is
33:01 - fortunately for us the Chrome extension
33:04 - API so let's actually try to look up
33:07 - where this is Chrome extension Chrome
33:14 - extension Chrome what do I Chrome
33:19 - extension get URL image or something so
33:23 - I want to find it in the documentation
33:25 - ah extension dot get URL so this is what
33:30 - I want I want to say browser is this
33:33 - right I thought it was chrome dot
33:34 - extension oh is this like am I in the
33:37 - hah oh this is like a generic thing even
33:39 - higher level than this is just like a
33:41 - browser interestingly enough a lot of
33:43 - the stuff that's part of Chrome
33:45 - extensions while part of the chrome API
33:47 - is modeled off of this more generic
33:50 - somebody will know more about this than
33:51 - I do okay so I'm looking for this in
33:54 - chrome Chrome extension I just want to
33:57 - find the page get URL here we go this is
34:02 - what I'm looking for this is the API
34:04 - this is what I want so this is the
34:06 - documentation page on include some of
34:07 - these links in the video this is a
34:09 - Chrome extension this is part of the API
34:11 - and I won't get URL get URL gives you
34:14 - the URL of a path that's part of your
34:16 - Chrome extension so I should be able to
34:18 - say equals Chrome extension dot get URL
34:25 - source and let's call this file source
34:29 - is sort of the wrong thing
34:31 - and just because I'm curious let's
34:36 - actually do this let's put it in a
34:39 - variable and then set that to URL and I
34:41 - just want a console log that URL so here
34:45 - we go I think we're actually pretty good
34:47 - I think this is done we just need to
34:49 - find some better web pages to run this
34:51 - on oh I need to reload the Chrome
34:54 - extension
35:06 - I didn't work at all let's look at the
35:11 - consult mmm Dan nine load Oh wet
35:16 - resources must be listed in the web
35:18 - accessible resources manifest key in
35:21 - order to be loaded by pages outside the
35:22 - extension yeah yeah web accessible
35:25 - resources hmm oh wait a sec oh no oh oh
35:33 - I know what the problem is I put
35:35 - everything in a kitten's folder and then
35:38 - in my extension I forgot to say they all
35:45 - have to have the kittens folder prefix
35:48 - okay here we go again here we go again I
35:56 - have to reload let's find a better web
36:00 - page how about using lazy doubt house
36:06 - okay
36:07 - what's that is Z dot house hey what is
36:14 - this it's all kittens what's going on
36:19 - what kind of internet is happening here
36:21 - I'm I'm gonna be bold let's mess with
36:25 - let's let's just be bold and go to the
36:27 - New York Times and let's see if we can
36:31 - replace the image is on the New York
36:33 - Times with kittens Oh
36:50 - kittens kittens kittens kittens all
36:58 - right so we can see here there's some
37:00 - work to be done here oops
37:02 - let's just let's browse the web now
37:03 - Google Books let's let's just enjoy
37:12 - browsing the web
37:14 - NASA seems like a website that I might
37:16 - enjoy going to look at oh look and look
37:20 - at this NASA website what's happening in
37:22 - NASA these days but actually I like the
37:24 - fact that when I google image search for
37:26 - something like puppies it's all kittens
37:35 - look kittens
37:37 - oh boy kittens puppies but that's a
37:40 - kitten so even if I search for unicorns
37:48 - it's all kittens and I could go to the
37:51 - unicorn Wikipedia page and it is a so
37:55 - interestingly enough not everything is
37:57 - getting replaced so I probably should
37:59 - finish this video and be done with this
38:02 - yeah something's I'm being point out
38:04 - that the New York Times loads a lot of
38:07 - oh that was my extension working so that
38:12 - was my extent I went to hold on a second
38:16 - lazy what okay what is this website this
38:21 - is actually working I thought you guys
38:23 - were trolling me and giving you made-up
38:25 - website really quickly I had all the
38:28 - kitten images in it oh I'm losing my
38:30 - mind here so I'm going to disable the
38:32 - extension just for a second I should
38:34 - make it tie it to a button lazy house
38:36 - okay this is something about home
38:38 - automation and stuff you can do and now
38:41 - with the extension work I get it I get
38:44 - it I get it so interestingly enough not
38:46 - all images get replaced let's so near
38:49 - times for example I bet you load some
38:50 - images through JavaScript in a different
38:52 - way let's inspect this element here it
38:55 - is I don't know why so I'd have to
39:02 - investigate
39:04 - there's this looks like source it's like
39:07 - a thumbnail that it's actually looking
39:08 - at maybe over the image so there's all
39:10 - sorts of complexity with how different
39:12 - web pages work so we'd have to have to
39:14 - Wikipedia is not a good example of this
39:16 - let me think of one more let's just go
39:19 - to a Schiffman net there we go this is
39:23 - nice so thank you that you've got to
39:27 - definitely do quite a bit more to make
39:29 - this the robust kitten eyes there her
39:32 - Chrome extension that I always hoped it
39:33 - would be so let me give you some
39:34 - exercises if you want to follow along
39:36 - with this coding challenge think about
39:37 - other things that you might replace on a
39:39 - webpage how you might replace text how
39:42 - you might replace images how you might
39:43 - play sounds there's all sorts of
39:45 - possibilities there find a different set
39:47 - of images maybe you could actually use
39:49 - the unsplash api to dynamically pull
39:52 - different images I will post the code to
39:54 - this you will find a link to the github
39:56 - repository where this code exists in the
39:57 - video's description and in the next
39:59 - coding challenge I'm gonna do something
40:01 - very similar but instead of replacing
40:03 - with images may be able to leave the
40:04 - kitten thing here I'm gonna make a
40:06 - Chrome extension that I can draw over
40:07 - the page thank you for watching I'm
40:18 - sorry I'm looking at the chat now
40:20 - replace ads it uses the source set
40:24 - attribute right I could probably
40:32 - I'm sorry I'm reading the chat yes
40:35 - source set attribute but I've seen this
40:37 - question many times do I listen to Lady
40:39 - Gaga or Daft Punk I have listened to
40:42 - that music before I have heard it into
40:43 - my ears yes can it replace ads probably
40:47 - yes but you'd have to be more thoughtful
40:49 - about you'd have to be more thoughtful
40:54 - about your I mean I haven't done very
40:58 - much with this coat here like this is
41:00 - kind of all I got right it's not a lot
41:01 - of code alright so I heard a noise it's
41:11 - been scratching at the door
41:12 - maybe it's the cat army of kittens
41:15 - alright so I'm it's 6:15 I'm gonna do
41:18 - one more coding challenge and then I've
41:21 - got to go I'm gonna drink some water
41:23 - there's a spider on my head will you
41:32 - ever make a coding challenge on
41:34 - tic-tac-toe with the minimax algorithm
41:41 - that sounds like a fun idea okay you
41:43 - guys are asking me so many good
41:44 - questions but I I'm gonna I'm gonna come
41:45 - back to questions later because let's
41:47 - let's move on to the next coding
41:49 - challenge maybe this one I'll start with
41:57 - the manifest.json file already and I'm
42:02 - gonna call this sketch j/s this is gonna
42:06 - be oh for sketch and we get rid of
42:11 - kittens and I'm also gonna get I want to
42:18 - get the p5 libraries let's go to let's
42:26 - leave this extension I should have been
42:27 - using github the whole time that would
42:28 - have been a good thing I don't know why
42:29 - I can't let's go to the p5 libraries
42:32 - oops
42:42 - I'm gonna leave this extension on always
42:47 - no releases what am I doing here
42:50 - code Rose releases how bout releases
42:53 - let's get p5.js and just in case we need
42:57 - Dom so what I'm going to do here now is
43:05 - copy these library files and put them in
43:10 - Chrome extensions sketch and I'm going
43:14 - to p5 sketch extension p5 sketch and ok
43:30 - so I'm gonna start this coding challenge
43:32 - with this manifest js5 and do everything
43:35 - else from scratch oh use let in for of
43:42 - loop otherwise you will create a global
43:43 - variable that oh thank you that's a good
43:45 - correction so I'm not going to go back
43:46 - and redo the video but at least in the
43:48 - code that I publish I will have that
43:52 - corrected thank you uh-oh I totally did
43:58 - that wrong Thank You Alka so I added the
44:00 - wrong file so I can fix this no problem
44:10 - yeah put this here so I think I'm good
44:13 - now let me open this manifest.json and
44:17 - this sketch oh this should be empty okay
44:26 - [Music]
44:28 - here we go everybody the cold was a bad
44:39 - one and it really went away but there's
44:41 - still remnants Chrome extension coding
45:06 - challenge number two I'm also going in
45:09 - this coding challenge I just made one
45:11 - that replaces images with kittens if you
45:12 - didn't watch that already you can also
45:14 - check out the Chrome extension
45:16 - tutorial playlist for a lot of
45:17 - background information but in this video
45:19 - I'm going to attempt to make a Chrome
45:22 - extension for any web page that you're
45:24 - on like the p5.js library page that I
45:27 - can like doodle over it so and I'm going
45:30 - to do over it with a p5.js sketch so how
45:34 - do I do that so one thing is so I I did
45:37 - already
45:38 - one of the first things you need for a
45:40 - Chrome extension if you've watched me in
45:41 - other videos you already know this is a
45:42 - manifesto JSON file that is the
45:45 - configuration and all the information
45:47 - about your Chrome extension that you
45:48 - need so this being just a Content script
45:52 - I want it to work on any URL and more
45:56 - likely I probably want to do something
45:57 - where I press a button and then I can
45:58 - draw on maybe I get a pop up with an
45:59 - interface to pick the color but we'll
46:01 - get to all that later right now I'm just
46:03 - gonna do the simple thing that for any
46:04 - web page I could suddenly draw on it so
46:06 - I'm gonna put all the code for drawing
46:08 - in sketch j/s and just to show you what
46:11 - I mean like a simple p5 sketch would be
46:15 - something like this function set up
46:17 - function draw I'm going to say create
46:19 - canvas I'm just gonna just give some
46:22 - arbitrary size right now I'm gonna say
46:25 - I'm gonna like absolute position it so
46:29 - that it is over and I'm gonna say clear
46:32 - so I don't think I need to say clear I
46:33 - think by definition is cleared so that
46:34 - it's a transparent canvas and actually
46:36 - I'm not even gonna do that I just want
46:38 - to see the can
46:39 - on the page so I'm gonna say background
46:41 - zero so here's the thing now let me try
46:43 - running this extension let's see what
46:45 - happens so I put I I have this manifesto
46:49 - JSON I have this sketch let's load the
46:51 - extension let me close a bunch of this
46:54 - extra stuff if you're wondering why
46:56 - everything appears to be an image of a
46:59 - kitten it's because I'm still running my
47:01 - other Chrome extension so I'm going to
47:04 - I'm gonna keep that enabled I'm gonna
47:06 - load a new extension called because I
47:09 - can't turn off the kitten the one sketch
47:12 - and so again you need to be at Chrome
47:15 - slash lash extensions and you need to
47:17 - have developer mode on and you can find
47:20 - out more about this in some of my other
47:21 - tutorial videos p5 sketch version 0.1 is
47:24 - now running so let I'd probably should
47:28 - turn this one off but let's go to this
47:30 - web page now that I want to draw on open
47:33 - up the chrome console I'm gonna let this
47:35 - give myself some more space here I'm
47:37 - going to so actually it's time I've got
47:42 - to disable this because this extension
47:43 - is spinning out a lot of stuff in the
47:46 - console and I want to just look at this
47:47 - stuff for the p5 sketch so I don't see
47:52 - anything like the extensions I think
47:55 - nothing going on here well let me at
47:57 - least say console dot log sketch started
48:05 - sketch looping I know why this isn't
48:09 - working by the way and being I'm kind of
48:11 - like setting the stage here for what I
48:13 - want to talk about and then I'm gonna
48:14 - say console dot log its sketch blah
48:21 - okay so let's reload this extension
48:25 - reload and I'm hit refresh sketch blah
48:30 - but no set up a no draw so here's the
48:34 - thing well a couple things number one is
48:37 - I didn't include the p5 libraries I mean
48:41 - I have them in there I have sketched out
48:42 - yes p5 dot JSP five dong yes so I've got
48:46 - to at least in manifesto JSON reference
48:48 - those so let's say I'm a not p5 d'en bas
48:51 - and this
48:52 - be double quotes so I want all of these
48:55 - JavaScript libraries so this is by the
48:56 - way how you can reference another
48:58 - JavaScript library in a Chrome extension
49:00 - and I think there's a way to do this
49:02 - with a URL path I'll have to come back
49:04 - to that another time
49:06 - so I can do that let's reload the
49:10 - extension I'm gonna laugh if this works
49:12 - which it really shouldn't hit refresh ah
49:15 - there we go
49:17 - Oh Sita whoa oh my goodness it sort of
49:21 - did something well it actually ran set
49:23 - up whoa weird so interestingly enough
49:28 - I'm kind of intrigued by this because
49:31 - there's a thing that I was about to
49:33 - explain which is that I have to use
49:34 - something called instance mode opening
49:36 - up so I'm gonna just let's just just
49:40 - humor me for a second I'm gonna take out
49:43 - this and let's just see what happens now
49:46 - for some reason the Dom library didn't
49:49 - seem to work but the other stuff too
49:51 - which is weird
49:52 - let's run this again whoo weird oh it's
49:57 - there I'm shocked I'm shocked it just
50:02 - worked that's so weird but the Dom
50:04 - library stuff didn't work why does the
50:07 - order matter
50:08 - oh maybe it's just that interesting
50:11 - something changed since the last time I
50:13 - tried this this is gonna be much easier
50:16 - than I thought I thought I was gonna
50:18 - have to explain instance mode let's try
50:20 - putting the Dom library gigas they order
50:21 - late load in these orders let's try this
50:25 - again
50:27 - reload so now let me let's try sorry
50:32 - let's go back to sketch and let's let's
50:36 - use the Dom library now and once again
50:40 - reload again and it refresh yeah look at
50:46 - that huh well la-dee-da so amazingly I
50:51 - can actually just put a p5 sketch in the
50:55 - content script maybe this is a bad idea
50:58 - for some reason it when I made an
51:01 - example for this last year I had to use
51:03 - something called instance mode and if
51:04 - you want
51:04 - instance mode is I will include a link
51:06 - to a video tutorial about that
51:08 - I thought p5 does this thing where it
51:10 - before to be beginner-friendly it allows
51:12 - you to declare set up and draw in the
51:14 - sort of global world of JavaScript and
51:16 - for whatever reason I thought that that
51:18 - didn't work in a Content script and you
51:20 - had to kind of namespace things in the
51:22 - instance mode way these terms might not
51:24 - mean anything to you but you can watch
51:27 - that instance mode video if you're kind
51:29 - of wondering about that let's keep going
51:31 - so let's let's let's let's finish this
51:33 - off so I'm gonna take this out I'm gonna
51:36 - put clear in draw I'm gonna say a line
51:42 - from Mouse X Mouse Y to previous Mouse X
51:46 - previous Mouse Y and I'm gonna say
51:50 - stroke zero stroke wait for and what
51:58 - else do I want to do ah so this is the
51:59 - other thing I probably want to make the
52:01 - canvas fill the page so right now I'll
52:03 - just use window width and window height
52:10 - so let's go back now and reload hey
52:21 - where's my canvas let's see do I have an
52:22 - error sketch blah now alright let's
52:28 - let's see hmm so how do I D bug this
52:32 - mm-hmm
52:35 - let's not put let's put a background
52:38 - here what a pain to reload can I just I
52:47 - can just do a refresh no okay refresh
52:52 - okay that worked ooh and it's there oh
52:55 - oh oh
52:58 - weird okay hold on a second
53:02 - so why didn't that work first of all I
53:04 - wanted this I want to say if mouse is
53:05 - pressed hmm so it's working that canvas
53:11 - is there it's interesting how its
53:12 - underneath some things and I wonder if
53:14 - that's kind of the issue so
53:18 - let's reload reload again somebody in
53:25 - the chat I'm sure it's telling me
53:26 - exactly what I'm doing wrong and then oh
53:29 - well it works I don't know why it work
53:32 - before okay so I can do things like I
53:35 - love p5 and I'm going to make a little
53:41 - hard so this is this is just a very
53:43 - beginning stuff here now here's the
53:45 - thing there's some some flaws here that
53:48 - I can give you I'm gonna scroll and I
53:51 - can't I can't draw down here anymore cuz
53:55 - that canvas is actually just a very is I
54:00 - said window width and window height so I
54:02 - could do something like get the body
54:04 - height I think of the whole page to make
54:06 - the canvas over the whole page but it
54:07 - could be a really long page another
54:09 - thing I could do is like move the canvas
54:11 - as I scroll I couldn't like just do the
54:14 - body height but I could also deal with
54:21 - z-index would be important which is a
54:23 - CSS property that allows me to put
54:25 - things book under and in front of so
54:27 - there's all sorts of like cleanup stuff
54:29 - I could do here but this is the basic
54:31 - idea now one of the things that I want
54:33 - to do is I also could make this have a
54:36 - pop-up where I could click a button here
54:38 - and have an interface to change the
54:39 - color and it would be gonna be
54:41 - interesting to think about what if this
54:42 - is something that then gets saved to I
54:44 - don't know local storage which is kind
54:46 - of like a database that's sitting inside
54:48 - of chrome itself or your drawings get
54:50 - saved to some server somewhere so when
54:52 - you come back to the web page your
54:54 - drawings are there you can share them
54:55 - with somebody else that's browsing the
54:56 - same webpage so many possible
54:58 - possibilities there's actually a project
54:59 - called shift space which is by Dan
55:02 - Pfeiffer and mu Shan shift space who
55:09 - Shawn Dan bye-bye this is a project from
55:17 - it and development ended up in 2011 but
55:20 - I encourage do you encourage you to
55:22 - check it out it's really interesting it
55:24 - was started by Dan Pfeiffer and
55:25 - Michaan's there Aviv so that's um which
55:28 - was a way that you could annotate
55:31 - web pages collaboratively and if you're
55:34 - browsing the same page as someone who's
55:36 - a friend of yours you're gonna see those
55:37 - annotations at the same time okay I'm
55:39 - looking
55:39 - there's position:fixed which would which
55:44 - would anchor it to the browser rather
55:45 - than scroll with the page but maybe you
55:47 - want your a anyway there's so many
55:48 - possibilities I'm gonna stop I'm gonna
55:50 - stop here this is what you can now do by
55:53 - putting a peu 5 sketch overlay now I
55:55 - will make one thing clear I can no
55:57 - longer click on these links because of
56:00 - the way that I've sort of like put this
56:01 - canvas over and what's happening with
56:03 - focus and mouse press so that's probably
56:05 - something you're gonna want to think
56:07 - about I wonder if I could set the
56:09 - z-index to further back it might then
56:16 - not get it might not get the mouse
56:21 - events then which is kind of an issue
56:23 - let's see
56:24 - so let's reload and let's run okay so
56:29 - I'm still able to draw but you can see
56:31 - the the links now work oh amazingly
56:36 - great why would it the canvas is still
56:39 - there from page to page so that's an
56:41 - interesting thing to know when you've
56:43 - gone to a new page or was that oh maybe
56:45 - that was not that was not that actually
56:48 - wasn't going to a new page that was like
56:51 - a refresh in the same page cuz right I'm
56:53 - I'm staying on the same page I'm just
56:54 - anyway there's so much can you mean
56:57 - could this video just have ended five
56:58 - minutes ago please thank you for
57:00 - watching I have made a Chrome extension
57:02 - and
57:06 - I hope to see that you did something
57:08 - creative with us with adding p5 GS to
57:11 - your Chrome extensions and I will be
57:13 - back again in the future with more
57:14 - tutorials in particular about pop-ups
57:16 - more about messaging and more about
57:19 - using an API with a Chrome extension so
57:21 - many possibilities okay thanks for
57:23 - watching
57:25 - point your events none pointer events
57:31 - breaking news all right hold on hold on
57:38 - timeout let's let's pretend we can go
57:41 - back and redo the end of this video
57:43 - not to me maybe you can like I don't
57:46 - know because I feel like I was so
57:47 - scatterbrained
57:48 - where was I where I was drawing on the
57:50 - page so let's see so there's let me try
57:58 - to learn some of this stuff see style
58:00 - pointer events oh that's what I want
58:07 - none
58:14 - oh look at that I'm trying to understand
58:20 - why some stuff because I am going to a
58:25 - different page right going to this
58:27 - particular issue page and yet that
58:29 - remains there interesting all right let
58:32 - me go look first of all this is kind of
58:33 - messed up so I'm not to do your magic
58:42 - whatever you do is gonna be okay with me
58:44 - but I'm going to I'm gonna I'm gonna add
58:47 - this in but as if okay so one of the
58:51 - things whoops oh I have to relook oh
58:54 - wait a second I didn't reload the
58:55 - extension
58:56 - it's then Z X okay hold on
59:02 - let me reload the extension to what it
59:05 - was why did I think you had to use
59:11 - instance mode so one of the things you
59:16 - might notice here whoops one of the
59:20 - things you might notice here is that
59:21 - I've really messed with your ability to
59:23 - click on links because the canvas is
59:25 - kind of stole is overlaid on top of
59:27 - everything and it's stolen it's stolen a
59:31 - focus from all of the underlying stuff
59:33 - so thank you to me I am so me and others
59:35 - in the chat who have given me some good
59:37 - advice about this there are some CSS
59:39 - properties that I can try to add so
59:42 - since I've got the p5 library loaded
59:44 - anyway I could say see that style
59:45 - what was it pointer in the pointer
59:49 - events like this is a CSS property that
59:52 - will say like hey I don't want the
59:54 - canvas to receive any pointer events so
59:56 - those pointer events will pass through
59:58 - underneath now this might not totally
60:01 - work hit refresh so now I'm sort of able
60:07 - to get it but like it's working but and
60:10 - you can see yeah so this is kind of and
60:12 - interestingly you can see that the the
60:15 - canvas is still there that's because
60:16 - github is actually not going to new
60:19 - pages it's kind of refreshing within the
60:20 - same page but if I really went to a new
60:23 - page which like me went to the github
60:24 - home page yeah it's gonna go away so now
60:28 - this seems to be working fine it's doing
60:30 - some weird stuff with me like
60:31 - highlighting as I'm dragging the mouse
60:32 - around but I'd you know there might be
60:35 - some things I might need to also a
60:36 - property that I might need to work with
60:39 - is the Z index Z index is a CSS property
60:43 - that keeps track of things layered um so
60:46 - there's so many possible things I can
60:47 - start adding CSS wise to this but I
60:52 - think I'm gonna stop here so this is the
60:54 - basic idea I'm giving you a challenge to
60:56 - do afterwards number one is be more
60:58 - creative about what you overlay on top
61:00 - of the canvas this is just me drawing a
61:02 - line think be more thoughtful about how
61:05 - you handle the interaction maybe with
61:07 - some CSS and Z index as well as think
61:11 - about the page how you're gonna handle
61:13 - the full page let me figure out this
61:15 - body thing I'm pretty sure I can say
61:18 - client body height or something right
61:22 - somebody must know this sorry okay wait
61:32 - Papa Papa papa Bubba so hold on and
61:34 - that's you maybe let's make let me just
61:35 - look this up talk about everybody I
61:39 - don't like to do this but I'm going to
61:40 - the way that I did this I'm gonna look
61:42 - at my example from last year Chrome
61:46 - extensions it's funny still going p5
61:50 - sketch this is what I did see look I did
61:55 - it with instance mode because I thought
61:58 - it wouldn't work document that body
62:03 - client height yeah that's what is
62:04 - document that body client height okay
62:06 - doc you Minister body client okay so I
62:12 - can get the height of the page by saying
62:15 - a document dot body dot client height I
62:21 - think and then so I could actually put
62:24 - that in here and so now if I reload the
62:29 - extension and I go back to github.com
62:33 - ooh look
62:36 - how slow this is now I mean I can draw
62:39 - all the way down here and I can keep
62:41 - scrolling but that's because I have this
62:43 - huge large canvas that's covering the
62:45 - entire thing so I probably have to be
62:47 - more thoughtful maybe I just like move
62:49 - it around or I have multiple canvases or
62:51 - I give it a sort of maximum amount cause
62:53 - it could be a really long webpage but
62:55 - you can see that's how I can actually
62:56 - get the full bodies height in pixels and
62:59 - I can draw all over the entire thing
63:02 - okay anything else that I want to add to
63:07 - this SVG would be better that makes a
63:10 - lot of sense outcomes
63:12 - that canvas is kind of a problem and
63:14 - that I'm and an SVG wouldn't have the
63:16 - same problem so I could do something
63:17 - like that and I think that's it so I
63:22 - look forward to seeing what kind of
63:24 - creative possibilities you make from
63:27 - this I will mention I think I kind of
63:29 - had this like crazy conversation about
63:31 - instance mode versus not instance mode I
63:33 - suspect that there could be some issues
63:35 - with me declaring global variables in
63:37 - the content script and if I'm using let
63:40 - I should be okay because let scopes
63:43 - thing in a different way but I you don't
63:45 - want to in theory there could be some
63:46 - conflicts between the JavaScript you're
63:48 - writing in your Chrome extension and the
63:50 - JavaScript that's executing on a page so
63:51 - maybe that's one of the reasons why at
63:53 - one point I did instance mode I'll just
63:54 - show you what that looks like because it
63:57 - happens to be on this page under these
64:00 - examples Chrome extensions and with p5
64:06 - sketch so this is what instance mode
64:09 - looks like it's a way of having all the
64:12 - p5 stuff happen within namespace you
64:15 - always have to say p5 dot this or p5 dot
64:17 - this that way you're not running into
64:19 - there's only one kind of variable that's
64:22 - oh it's that's global this is so fun
64:25 - there's only one variable it's like a
64:27 - smart board except it's not very smart
64:30 - ok do it anymore of course it doesn't
64:33 - work now there's only one variable
64:35 - that's global ah I shouldn't make videos
64:37 - late in the evening when I really should
64:39 - just be gone so I hopefully this wasn't
64:40 - like enormous incredibly long with me
64:42 - rambling I hope you got something out of
64:44 - this and I look forward to seeing what
64:45 - kind of creative Chrome extensions
64:47 - you all make thanks for watching
64:55 - okay body dot scroll height could be
64:58 - used turnoff text selection that's
65:01 - another thing I could do as we're all so
65:04 - much smarter than me
65:06 - so anyway how's that I feel like that
65:12 - video was kind of a disaster but I think
65:18 - it can be made into something user
65:20 - select none okay fine hold on let's
65:24 - let's let's let's go from I got an idea
65:27 - sorry my tía let's go from here
65:31 - when I added that pointer event and I
65:38 - was on like what's it like six thirty
65:42 - seven we're fine oh I think I'm crashing
65:50 - it because of like how long this is so
65:56 - let's go back to I did it on a disease
65:58 - sorry it's on here you know it also the
66:07 - power is not plugged into this computer
66:09 - sometimes document.onselectstart
66:16 - function return false is that better
66:19 - then user select none on the body or
66:22 - that's the same thing we'll try a
66:24 - different thing we'll try some oh I have
66:28 - to do it in JavaScript so I could I
66:31 - could include CSS you can't include
66:34 - fields oh okay hold on reload I
66:43 - appreciate that you guys like the
66:45 - disasters
66:52 - they're an error sketch blah did I put Z
66:58 - and X in there or something it's funny
67:02 - how it's not working all of a sudden of
67:09 - course the camera goes off no sound
67:25 - document that body that style that user
67:28 - select equals none yeah thank you call
67:30 - no loop on Mouse released and loop on
67:33 - Mouse of how these are such good ideas
67:34 - but why isn't it even working at all why
67:42 - did it stop working let's go to like
67:51 - whoa that's something else this is so
67:55 - weird
67:56 - oh there we go
68:02 - I wonder if there's a loading issue and
68:08 - that's why you actually need instance
68:10 - mode I wonder if it worked by accident
68:16 - right good things not be loading in the
68:20 - right or because here's the thing you
68:26 - can't guarantee that all you can
68:28 - guarantee that the page has loaded but I
68:30 - don't think you can guarantee that all
68:33 - of these have loaded I think I just got
68:35 - lucky I know I used constraint right
68:42 - don't you think I think maybe you have
68:45 - to use instance mode because right it's
68:47 - only working like a random percentage of
68:49 - the time right of course now it's just
68:55 - working consistently
69:01 - right p5 didn't load it floating when I
69:08 - have the console open but not without it
69:12 - why is that right consoles not open who
69:19 - consoles open it loaded looks I think p5
69:25 - actually hooks into the document load
69:27 - which has already happened so it's it's
69:29 - there it's called before you script or
69:30 - not is probably random yeah if it so
69:36 - don't you think that I need to do the
69:38 - instance mode thing that I've just got
69:40 - lucky all right where does this video is
69:46 - gonna keep on going I just want to hear
69:49 - from people I'm gonna wait and drink
69:58 - some water here so I think I'm gonna
70:00 - rewrite this with instance mode it might
70:05 - because I have it stored in my cache or
70:06 - something as I use p5 a lot well I
70:10 - really need this breaking news sound
70:11 - effect you could also totally hack in a
70:16 - second load of yes so that's the thing I
70:19 - mean I am swimming is saying you could
70:20 - also a hack in like I could write some
70:22 - JavaScript code to like load the p5
70:25 - library and then but I think it's better
70:29 - for me just use instance mode so I think
70:32 - that's what I'm gonna do okay so that's
70:37 - yeah when you watch this first I am
70:43 - sorry second I think we're going to go
70:47 - from again I trust your judgement more
70:50 - than my own but I think we're going to
70:54 - go from where I add this I think we can
70:58 - leave everything up to and a lot of
71:01 - other stuff get cut but where I add this
71:03 - and I'm going to now realize that it's
71:07 - not working every time and I'm gonna
71:09 - realize that I actually really did need
71:10 - instance mode after all and I'm gonna
71:12 - add instance mode and
71:13 - what's gonna fix it then I'm gonna add
71:15 - Alka is again going to then because the
71:18 - chat in the slash settlement way past
71:21 - its gonna tell P what code to add again
71:24 - for the user select thing and then
71:27 - that's gonna be good
71:28 - alright here we go coding power form of
71:41 - p5 debugging person ok it's all my guy I
71:44 - really got to leave by 7 so here we go
71:46 - all right here we go
71:58 - I kind of want to put the kittens back
72:00 - do you think I can put the kittens back
72:06 - hello there was a weird edit point there
72:09 - but I discovered something while making
72:10 - this video tutorial look how nicely this
72:12 - is working this is me on my Schiffman
72:15 - net website and i refresh the page and
72:17 - it works nicely it draws I close the
72:20 - console i refresh the page again it's
72:22 - not working anymore Oh weird it's sort
72:25 - of worth so that's not working out no
72:27 - that it's working so here's the thing I
72:29 - think I got lucky
72:30 - remember earlier in this video I started
72:32 - rambling about this thing called
72:33 - instance mode well I think I got lucky
72:36 - in that V ok so a Content script by
72:41 - definition executes after the page has
72:44 - loaded but the page itself is not does
72:50 - not include the p5 library and the p5
72:53 - these these I don't think the order of
72:57 - this really guarantees you much of
72:58 - anything could it could I put sketched a
73:01 - s first let's just try this I really
73:03 - don't think so
73:04 - I think p5 what it's does what the p5
73:07 - library does is it looks for your setup
73:08 - and draw function and it that that
73:12 - Sketchup JS file might not really like
73:14 - the content script might not be
73:15 - available when it's like loading the p5
73:17 - library and then something not finding
73:19 - the set of a draw function and
73:20 - everything so I might need to actually
73:21 - explicitly say like hey hello p5 here's
73:24 - my set up a draw function which I'm
73:25 - gonna show you how to do in a minute
73:27 - using something on instance mode unless
73:28 - this fixes the problem but really do you
73:30 - really think they load in that order in
73:32 - some way that's logical but that doesn't
73:33 - make any sense cuz sketch would have to
73:35 - come after I can't load it first
73:36 - let's try so I'm gonna go to reload this
73:40 - extension reload I'm gonna hit refresh
73:45 - huh not working oh now it's not working
73:48 - at all oh now it is working it's the
73:51 - same thing I think I'm getting lucky
73:52 - sometimes and not because maybe I have
73:54 - things cache things over to ram or
73:56 - somebody much smarter than me we'll know
73:58 - detective but I I think I really want
74:00 - this to work I am going to have to I'm
74:05 - going to have to use instance mode and
74:07 - I'm getting some other Oh me I am Sania
74:11 - Singh I can
74:12 - all global in it to make p5 check-in
74:15 - again
74:16 - so let's try that so I kind of want to
74:19 - show you instance MA but that's sort of
74:21 - interesting you mean I could just say
74:22 - like here global in it which is like I
74:28 - could do something like this which is
74:29 - like a secret function as part of p5
74:33 - really in the weeds here in this
74:35 - video-tutorial supposed to be like why
74:36 - is this video why is this particular
74:38 - video 7 hours long
74:42 - that didn't work
74:44 - oh now it worked p5 global in it okay
74:54 - I'm I'm going to what about my eyebrows
74:59 - I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and
75:03 - do what I think will work which is
75:05 - instance mode so what is instance mode I
75:08 - have a video tutorial about it it's a
75:10 - way of name spacing everything in your
75:13 - p5 sketch and kind of wrapping it into a
75:16 - function so what I'm going to do is I
75:18 - think I have to say let's look let's
75:22 - let's go to let's go to the p5.js wiki
75:27 - because you might as well know about
75:28 - this page which has a little tutorial
75:32 - about instance mode and by the way
75:35 - sometimes oh I'm like killing okay first
75:38 - of all let's disable the extension and
75:43 - let's go to instance mode it's probably
75:48 - under I because I start global and
75:50 - instance mode so this webpage is going
75:51 - to explain this is global mode
75:53 - everything living in the global
75:54 - namespace this is instance mode so I am
75:57 - going to just copy this over and I'm
76:01 - gonna I'm gonna probably change this to
76:03 - using let instead of R and that sort of
76:04 - thing but I'm basically going to take
76:07 - this out and I'm gonna put my code in
76:11 - there whoops and what I'm gonna do is
76:20 - put it in here and I'm gonna say how did
76:23 - that work I need to say sketch dot setup
76:25 - you
76:25 - function I'll try to explain a little
76:27 - bit more about this and sketch dot draw
76:34 - equals function and then everything
76:37 - that's a p5 function I just say sketch
76:39 - dot so sketched out create canvas
76:43 - sketched out clear sketched out stroke
76:46 - sketched out scrote stroke weight if
76:48 - sketch dot mouse is pressed sketched out
76:51 - Mouse X sketched out mouse Y sketched
76:54 - out P Mouse X sketched out P Mouse Y and
77:00 - then this is fine so this is just now
77:04 - this is actually instantiating the p5
77:07 - sketch I'm getting some more
77:13 - these are injected in the order they
77:15 - appear in the array so from breaking
77:17 - news from the Chrome extension API this
77:20 - order actually does matter they are
77:22 - injected in into the script in the order
77:26 - that they're in the array so let's do
77:27 - this I think sketch touches should be
77:29 - last and now what I'm going to do is
77:34 - this should be exactly the same now this
77:38 - is instance mode it's the same exact
77:39 - sketch but I've so let me explain a
77:41 - little bit what's going on here what I'm
77:43 - doing is I'm saying I want to make I
77:45 - want to make a new P 5 thing and so
77:49 - normally this happens automatically the
77:52 - p5 library starts to make its own P 5
77:54 - thing by looking for your global setup
77:55 - and draw but here I'm saying I'm gonna
77:57 - make this wrapper function and it's
77:59 - going to have setup attached to it and
78:02 - draw attached to it and this whole thing
78:05 - is the thing you can make the p5 sketch
78:07 - from a bit more to it that you can read
78:09 - the wiki page but that's the basic idea
78:11 - let's see if this works I'm sure I made
78:15 - some mistakes
78:16 - Oh window with is that's a p5 variable
78:20 - so sketch that window with I think I'm
78:22 - gonna have to say all right let's see
78:24 - what happens here so one thing I want to
78:26 - do by the way is I'm gonna just change
78:28 - this to I want to change this to sketch
78:33 - dot window height again just so it's
78:35 - just so it's only covering part of the
78:37 - page
78:38 - because that really just slow it down if
78:39 - it tries to make a sketch a canvas the
78:41 - size of the whole body
78:43 - alright so let's now reload the
78:45 - extension enable the extension reload
78:50 - the extension and refresh the page
78:54 - okay and hold on refresh the page
79:00 - uncaught reference this line is not
79:02 - defined who sketched outline thank you
79:06 - very much so it's very easy it's kind of
79:08 - like forgetting this dot I kinda have
79:10 - sketched out for everything that's p5 so
79:13 - I'm going to reload the extension again
79:16 - I'm gonna come back here hit refresh
79:19 - there we go this works hit refresh again
79:23 - it works I'm gonna get rid of the
79:25 - console ah so now it's working
79:28 - consistently no matter what I do let's
79:30 - make one more thing a little nicer about
79:32 - this notice how I keep selecting the
79:35 - text box in it while I'm drawing out cuz
79:38 - the chat gave me some code to do that I
79:42 - see it now
79:42 - I can change I can affect the CSS of the
79:49 - entire body and set the user select
79:52 - property to none so user selects the
79:54 - property meaning making something
79:55 - available to be selected and so what I'm
79:57 - gonna do here in setup is I'm going to
79:59 - say document dot body dot style right
80:03 - dot user select equals none so and I
80:09 - kinda I don't know why but I have this
80:10 - like habit of doing this because a lot
80:12 - of the CSS properties are not valid
80:17 - keywords that you can just say dot like
80:19 - background - color you wouldn't be able
80:21 - to say style dot background - color but
80:23 - so you can user selected work cuz it's
80:25 - like a valid variable name so let's try
80:27 - adding this see if that's in the right
80:29 - place I'm going to reload the extension
80:34 - refresh and now there I am drawing it's
80:38 - not selecting the text I can still click
80:40 - on the links I can go over here I can
80:42 - draw on here and then I can also because
80:46 - I can also enable my chrome kitten
80:49 - extension I can go to this web page
80:52 - and I can draw oh I can draw books I can
80:54 - draw I can draw on the kittens yay I
80:59 - love you kitten
81:01 - oh you're a star kitten rainbow okay
81:08 - Oh are you still watching this video cuz
81:11 - I'm just gonna be here doodling on this
81:12 - webpage for a while okay
81:14 - so I'm gonna leave it here I did show
81:18 - you how you could actually create the
81:20 - canvas to be taller with document.body
81:23 - that client height one other suggestion
81:27 - from Austin and the chat said I could
81:30 - start with no loop and only render when
81:32 - I'm actually drawing that'll actually
81:34 - really help with performance as well of
81:35 - course there was another suggestion
81:37 - being like well if you just used SVG's
81:39 - you don't have this giant canvas that's
81:40 - probably a much smarter idea but the
81:42 - point is I'm showing you how you can
81:44 - have a canvas overlay with p5 and load P
81:48 - 5 P 5 library and by the way you can
81:52 - load other libraries the same exact way
81:54 - whether you want to use jQuery or a 3 J
81:56 - s or anything this is the same exact way
81:58 - so I hope you enjoyed this coding
82:00 - challenge about creating a canvas
82:02 - overlay p5 sketch in a Chrome extension
82:06 - content script if you made it through
82:09 - this whole video MA thank you something
82:12 - good bye
82:13 - [Music]
82:22 - where did I forget sketch dot did I did
82:31 - I
82:32 - I finished that video finally didn't I I
82:35 - see lots of facepalm emojis keep going I
82:39 - am learning I see there's an interesting
82:46 - there's a discussion maybe about the
82:48 - Chrome extension it's it scrolled past
82:50 - me so I can't see it I see me I am to be
82:52 - an echo or discussing something I'm
82:54 - happy to engage in that discussion kebab
82:57 - case in the bracket notation wouldn't
82:59 - work Oh sketch dot on line but I fixed
83:01 - it okay great
83:03 - can I go home now so this by the way I
83:06 - know how
83:07 - I like this is to live streams in one
83:09 - day I'm glad I was able to do this
83:11 - especially cuz I missed last week I
83:12 - haven't gotten I would say I've only
83:14 - gotten like halfway at most through the
83:16 - Chrome extension stuff let me look at my
83:18 - examples actually so I'm gonna come
83:22 - let's first of all let me turn off these
83:24 - Chrome extensions well I'm gonna leave
83:26 - the kitten went on obviously let's go to
83:29 - github.com slash Schiffman rainbow code
83:33 - so I am going to whoops oh no coding
83:37 - train let's look at the calendar here
83:43 - readme edit I don't know who I'm logged
83:47 - in as I think I might be logged in as
83:49 - myself so today was Chrome extensions
83:52 - next week we need to continue Chrome
83:56 - extensions so what do I need to do I
84:00 - need to do pop-up pop-up with messages I
84:11 - need to do what else I want to do what's
84:15 - the thing called where you tab override
84:16 - I mean I think I'll skip the omnibox
84:20 - thing I mean it's there I could get to
84:22 - it someday but you know omnibox probably
84:26 - should skip I definitely want to do
84:29 - WebGL I got a bump Alexa skill
84:35 - so I don't know what I'm gonna get to
84:37 - work to vac I'm in a bump so I think
84:42 - this is what I think I should continue
84:44 - the Chrome extension stuff next Friday
84:45 - and maybe look at WebGL see if I can get
84:47 - to some of these I'm open to your
84:49 - suggestions but that's kind of my plan
84:54 - oh I turn alright alright alright let's
84:57 - put it on let's put it on the agenda
85:01 - it's not on the agenda anywhere in here
85:03 - oh it's here so we have some extra bull
85:07 - bull we'll put a bayesian ticket by the
85:10 - way as you can see this document oh you
85:13 - can't even see what I'm doing I
85:14 - apologize you can all pull request this
85:17 - document to try to get me to change my
85:19 - schedule oh but maybe there's actually a
85:21 - helpful way you can make this better so
85:24 - I will be back next Friday
85:27 - it definitely won't be in the morning
85:29 - next Friday I know I have an appointment
85:30 - and some other stuff so I don't know if
85:33 - this is the exact time but this will be
85:35 - it'll be something like this so let me
85:37 - commit this changes so I kind of
85:41 - remember and pull requests here okay Oh

86:15 - Lucca kabil
86:17 - sorry I said Lucas the github name is
86:19 - Luca qabil Thank You Luca good night
86:23 - everybody this has been the coding train
86:25 - with your host me i term yes Austin I
86:34 - turn will be our new new Chrome
86:35 - extensions joke
86:36 - I appreciate you enjoying that Ricardo
86:38 - asks I'm gonna do a couple questions
86:39 - here from the chat before I go do people
86:42 - recognize you on the streets and ask for
86:43 - selfies no
86:46 - if I go to like when I went the
86:48 - processing day and there are lots of
86:50 - people there who came because they know
86:51 - frosting and watch videos people
86:52 - recognize me or they just said hi to me
86:54 - and maybe I took a couple of pictures
86:55 - but I you know I've have a pretty low
86:58 - profile nobody's the record axis behind
87:00 - the street check Twitter know what the
87:08 - answer is always in doubt don't check
87:10 - Twitter Twitter is kind of a really
87:11 - awful place
87:12 - all this 280 characters nonsense I can
87:16 - say hello to shy L I am 44 years old do
87:22 - we have any plans that come to the UK
87:24 - for any reason I would really love to
87:26 - come to the UK I was talking about this
87:28 - earlier today I did live in London in
87:30 - 2015 for about 8 months and had a
87:32 - wonderful time there visited all over
87:34 - the place around the UK and went up to
87:37 - Scotland what to Cornwall I never made
87:40 - it over to Ireland and I had lovely time
87:44 - there so I hope to yes I hope to be back
87:46 - sometime alright what is the best video
87:50 - for me to watch I don't know you're
87:52 - gonna I think that chat should help you
87:54 - with that question let me I haven't done
87:56 - the little goodbye song in a while Oh
88:05 - [Music]
88:17 - fifty-one thousand three hundred and
88:19 - forty eighty four thousand seven hundred
88:22 - forty eight seventy one thousand five
88:25 - hundred sixty-eight
88:25 - fifty three thousand four hundred eighty
88:28 - three I really need a system like I
88:30 - could get through this whole book if I
88:31 - actually I look I hear there's a thing
88:34 - called a bookmarklet do you think
88:36 - there's a bookmarklet for this I'm gonna
88:38 - use this
88:39 - it's the ITP winter show postcard today
88:43 - is the day I'm gonna start from the
88:46 - first page of random numbers that is
88:54 - maybe I should actually just read the
88:56 - whole thing I should start with the
88:58 - forward I'm gonna read everything in
89:00 - this book and then someday somebody will
89:04 - splice it all together as one video okay
89:07 - let's make an agreement on that well how
89:09 - long do you think when will this be done
89:11 - I have no idea but every time I come on
89:12 - or I have a guest I'll do a little more
89:14 - and eventually the whole thing will be
89:16 - available the audio book for a million
89:19 - random digits with video accompaniments
89:22 - maybe I shouldn't play the lullaby
89:24 - because that's gonna make it so people
89:26 - can't remix and do stuff with the audio
89:28 - later hmm so right now I won't do it
89:32 - with the lullaby music this by the way
89:36 - this is a momentous occasion I'm
89:38 - deciding right now that I'm gonna start
89:40 - from the absolute beginning of this book
89:41 - the cover and I'm gonna read every
89:44 - single word and number that's in this
89:45 - book hopefully before I you know we're
89:50 - whatever happens next a million random
89:55 - digits with a hundred thousand normal

92:14 - have skipped that page when somebody
92:20 - makes the full compilation that can be
92:22 - edited out or not so I'm gonna read
92:26 - right now just the forward
92:28 - it's kind of long actually but I'm gonna
92:31 - read the foreword forward the volume you
92:33 - are holding documents are remarkable
92:35 - undertaking by a group of mathematicians
92:37 - engineers and data processors at Rand in
92:39 - the 1940s and 1950s the corporation's
92:42 - formative years to create a very large
92:45 - assembly of randomly distributed numbers
92:47 - or digits within such an assembly if it
92:50 - is truly random no pattern of
92:51 - occurrences whatsoever as measured for
92:53 - example by frequency or by serial
92:55 - Association exists regardless of the
92:57 - users starting point in the array
92:59 - pattern lessness is in fact salt for
93:02 - ideal to what purpose in a recent
93:05 - article in the science section of the
93:06 - New York Times the author George Johnson
93:09 - explains for cryptography game playing
93:11 - sociological surveys and various
93:13 - scientific calculations people often
93:15 - need series of numbers that are devoid
93:17 - of pattern and that is a tall order
93:20 - generating true randomness is one of
93:23 - computer sciences most difficult
93:25 - challenges so there's a footnote
93:27 - reference to George Johnson connoisseurs
93:29 - of chaos offer a valuable product
93:31 - randomness through New York Times June
93:33 - 12 2001 given a state of randomness
93:36 - predictability fails in a decimal table
93:39 - the probability for the occurrence of
93:40 - the next digit is everywhere the same
93:42 - whatever the number selected from 0
93:44 - through 9 once they are equipped with a
93:46 - sufficiently large sequence of random
93:47 - digits like the present one political
93:49 - poll takers for example can confidently
93:51 - calculate outcomes that depend on
93:53 - probability assumptions in the area of
93:55 - engineering use of the tables assemble
93:57 - it here assemble tear can save both time
94:00 - and money take the problem faced by a
94:02 - quality control team tasked with
94:04 - inspecting critical welds in an aging
94:07 - metal bridge instead of in effect
94:10 - dismantling the structure to accomplish
94:12 - the mission the inspectors can select a
94:14 - sufficiently large random sample of
94:17 - welds for examination a reliable
94:19 - surrogate for the whole bridge and
94:21 - proceed to measure the integrity of the
94:24 - complete structure or consider the case
94:26 - of a submarine commander who is reported
94:28 - to have kept the copy of the set of
94:30 - tables by him on patrol duty using
94:33 - selections from it to randomize a
94:34 - jinking course for purposes of evasion
94:37 - early in the conduct of rand research a
94:40 - demand arose for random numbers to be
94:42 - in solving problems by probability
94:43 - procedures known as Monte Carlo methods
94:47 - existing tables of such numbers were
94:49 - limited in size applied to ran problems
94:51 - they would have have to be used
94:52 - repeatedly thus introducing the danger
94:54 - of unwanted correlations the
94:57 - construction of a table with the
94:58 - capacity of the present one resulted
94:59 - from ingenious exploitation of punched
95:02 - card computational techniques then
95:04 - available has become a standard
95:06 - reference in engineering and
95:08 - Econometrica textbooks details of the
95:13 - production of the one million random
95:15 - digits contained in this volume are
95:17 - provided in the introduction several
95:19 - short tables draw on the expected and
95:21 - the actually observed frequency of
95:23 - occurrence of familiar poker hands
95:25 - together with a goodness of fit
95:27 - calculation an electronic roulette wheel
95:30 - if you will was used to yield the basic
95:32 - randomization the team members then
95:34 - applied rear and omission steps to
95:36 - produce the random digits of the whole
95:38 - modern random number generators use
95:40 - radioactive decay or atmospheric noise
95:42 - among other methods the 100,000 normal
95:46 - deviates cited in the title of this
95:48 - volume constitute a subset of random
95:50 - numbers whose occurrence can be plotted
95:52 - on a bell-shaped curve Rand legend has
95:55 - it that this seemingly
95:56 - self-contradictory mathematical
95:57 - expression caused the Newark Public
95:59 - Library to miss shell the volume in the
96:03 - psychology section the volume you hold
96:07 - was first published by the Free Press in
96:09 - June 1955 it had sold 500 copies by
96:13 - October by September 1971 the collection
96:16 - was in its third printing and it sold
96:18 - nearly 7,000 copies after a
96:21 - distinguished history as a standard
96:22 - reference it went out of print in 1989
96:25 - and was placed in rands reprint series
96:27 - RP - 295 to reach a wider audience in a
96:31 - more fitting form it is today being
96:33 - reissued as a Rand monograph report this
96:37 - is written by michael d rich executive
96:39 - vice president of rand so that's the
96:41 - foreword which explains how this is a
96:43 - reprint one of these days I'm gonna get
96:46 - myself a copy of an original prime know
96:48 - if that exists have to look on ebay and
96:52 - so I'm now realizing interestingly
96:54 - enough that
96:55 - yeah there's some this is a copyrighted
96:58 - and there might be some issues with me
96:59 - producing my own audiobook P without
97:02 - doing it slowly over time in pieces on a
97:03 - YouTube channel no I don't know if
97:06 - you're a lawyer out there heretics or if
97:08 - you know somebody at the rehab
97:09 - corporation to think I'm to get into
97:10 - trouble doing this please let me know
97:12 - but so far all I did was read the
97:13 - introduction which probably falls under
97:15 - fair use not to mention the fact that
97:17 - I'm promoting this book in fact if you
97:23 - oh I should do like an Amazon thing but
97:24 - if you want to get it I will include a
97:26 - link to the reprint on Amazon alright so
97:30 - thank you everybody thanks for watching
97:38 - thanks for tuning in thanks for being
97:40 - here
97:41 - again if you want to support the work
97:43 - that I'm doing you can join the patreon
97:47 - I always appreciate that it helps out
97:50 - and I hope to see you next Friday
97:53 - and if any of you will be at CC fest in
97:57 - New York though it's already sold out
97:59 - it's free but it's full please say hello
98:03 - to me I will be at CC fest dot is it
98:06 - rocks or NYC CC fest rocks which is
98:09 - apparently all about kittens thank you
98:16 - very much
98:18 - alright do I have any plans on doing a
98:20 - tutorial on the neat algorithms yes I do
98:28 - neuro-evolutionary stuff the whole book
98:32 - is available for download for free from
98:33 - the rand website that's a good point
98:38 - good night I will be here for two and a
98:42 - half more minutes or I'm happy to answer
98:44 - any questions that I see in the chat can
98:47 - I get some free stickers for my
98:48 - classroom send me a tweet at Schiffman
98:51 - if I can mail you some stickers for your
98:54 - students I would love to do that that's
99:01 - a question from Peter thanks for asking
99:04 - good morning I guess some people are
99:06 - waking up it is 7:10 I'm gonna get home
99:09 - by 8 o'clock I think
99:11 - do I have anything planned for Christmas
99:14 - well I am of a certain persuasion where
99:19 - I do not celebrate the holiday Christmas
99:21 - although it does get celebrated quite a
99:22 - bit around me I hope to get some time to
99:25 - relax and spend time with family and
99:27 - friends and not code very much I might
99:33 - be getting a Nintendo switch though
99:37 - anyway everyone's wanting to free
99:42 - stickers now listen so the stickers are
99:44 - something that I will mail to you as
99:45 - part of the patron rewards it does take
99:48 - me quite a while if you really want the
99:49 - stickers the best way is to come to an
99:52 - event that I'm going to where I can hand
99:54 - you some stickers and there's also a
99:55 - ticker mule link you can just buy them
99:57 - online but they're kind of expensive so
100:00 - but I I'm definitely happy to send
100:03 - stickers to say a group of students in a
100:06 - public school somewhere or something as
100:08 - a gift but just randomly sending
100:10 - stickers to everybody in the world I'm
100:12 - not sure I can do that easily yep had
100:18 - Daniel gue hey is going to get some
100:20 - pointless recognition I am going to
100:23 - combine neural networks with
100:24 - evolutionary algorithms that is a plan
100:26 - of mine and or asks are we able to live
100:29 - without coding I mean I think so we're
100:32 - probably just ruining I mean this coding
100:34 - stuff I don't know if it's really
100:36 - helping that much so think about think
100:38 - about doing some good for the world and
100:40 - always ask the question is is what I'm
100:42 - coding should I be doing it is it
100:44 - actually a good idea
100:45 - [Music]
100:52 - can you please shout out my library
100:55 - called see creative which is a c-sharp
100:58 - version of processing so see creative as
101:00 - a c-sharp version frosting I haven't
101:01 - seen it a tweet me a link at Schiffman I
101:03 - love to take a look uh here's a question
101:06 - whoops I'm gonna look I'm not even
101:09 - looking at oh there's an oh yeah there's
101:11 - some amazing Amazon reviews I think of a
101:14 - random number book oops
101:17 - it's gone okay ah Peters asking I'm
101:20 - going to have my students recreate a
101:21 - coding challenge for their end of
101:22 - semester final project let me know where
101:26 - you send me get send me a tweet like
101:27 - where are you teaching maybe I can I
101:29 - have 280 characters now this is
101:31 - ridiculously annoying so maybe I could
101:33 - respond to you that way with some ideas
101:35 - but people from the chat write in the
101:37 - chat which of the coding challenges
101:38 - might be good I don't know if your
101:40 - students are in college in elementary
101:42 - school where they are in the world what
101:43 - their background is so that that kind of
101:45 - information would be helpful in terms of
101:46 - which coding challenge okay Wow mouseka
101:48 - Mouse
101:49 - Moscow Russia is watching amazed by the
101:51 - international audience here oh wait this
101:54 - was my bookmark you viewers of the
101:58 - coding train please help me remember
102:00 - maybe we can put this somewhere on the
102:02 - Internet I am on the contents table of
102:06 - contents it will put this bookmark in
102:08 - here but I will not be surprised if it
102:09 - gets moved so somebody invents a system
102:11 - to keep track where I am in the million
102:13 - random book um thank you all for
102:16 - watching I will see you next Friday and
102:20 - I don't know thank you
102:28 - I'm gonna stop streaming now I suppose I
102:32 - just don't want to leave but I should
102:34 - cuz I feel like I haven't wrapped up
102:36 - things properly like I just said this or
102:38 - say this other thing and I could have
102:41 - thought of this thing but I really just
102:43 - have to go what's that what guy just
102:45 - can't say the thing that I want to say
102:47 - that mix everything sum up so nicely so
102:49 - I will just say goodbye
102:53 - send me or breaking news coding train
102:56 - sound effects and make sure there's a
102:58 - copyrighted in them because otherwise
103:00 - YouTube will kind of go
103:02 - after being Monti monetize everything
103:04 - and there we go goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

let's find something we wanna make some crazy idea we'll figure out what it takes to make creation hello good evening wait Here I am again just as I was this morning but only after a very frantic day so I might be a little bit more disheveled I thought I'd play the coding train intro song just you know the morning was like this serious like I'm gonna do a real tutorial I'm gonna be a good person on the Internet who takes making tutorials seriously it does a very good job and now it's the evening I don't have a lot of time we got about an hour and I want to do two more things I didn't get to this morning one of them is gonna be about kittens the other one's gonna be about p5 my voice you can hear that cold it's kind of a little bit back so let's not overdo it everybody let's relax but I'm gonna be fine my voice is fine I have some water over here and have some sound effects ah here I I guess I'm not bothering to do like my usual like intro blah blah blah blah blah so it did all that this morning I just want to kind of get into it but if you want to mention I'm really looking for a coding train like breaking news sound effect so I feel like what I want to be able to do is like get some breaking news my and then be able to report it so if anyone wants to make for me a good like did you know breaking news sound effect that's absolutely completely ridiculous please let me know please make that okay so uh let's gooo echo 34 is saying I sent you an extension I may check it out on my profile echo 34 underscore YouTube okay hold on Twitter actually mmm people sent me a lot of actually interesting things but I'm not logged into my Twitter I'm logged into the coding trained Twitter's here let's look at the notification and see if people sent it to me here so yeah wordless web thank you Gottfried a creator of the processing for the Raspberry Pi oh yes Thank You Nicole first of all I mentioned Nicole he's amazing mystery animal project already you've mentioned it this morning go check out Nicole he's amazing mystery animal project but this is a wonderful chrome extension I wish I had hat had it in my original video I wonder maybe we could splice this in Matt show this probably won't work at all but I'm gonna like talk about this Chrome extension for a second and if it works still I kind of like splice it in to that intro video that's great but if not this is a Chrome extension by Melanie Hoff called decode Elia and I don't know if I pronounced that right it's a Chrome extension and glasses set that uses basic principles of color theory to render your browser's content visible only with the use of red red tinted glasses so you can see here I can't see what's going on here but if I happen to have the red tinted glasses so I could essentially if I'm in a coffee shop and I didn't want anybody to see what I'm doing I could wear my glasses and use my computer without anyone be able to see and this is probably a nice video summary Melanie is an alum of both the school for a poetic computation and ITP the graduate program where I teach so I encourage you to check out this wonderful Chrome extension I just want to see if there's a right so so you can search for some like things on your this is obviously a kind of like an art project but it actually does work I've seen it it's great all right what else echo 34 says I made a Chrome extension for you okay echo that's wonderful and I'm sure that you have posted this here and it's something perfectly appropriate for me to look at in a live stream but it would be helpful if you just gave me a little bit more information I'm sure you know just you know I live in a world where I risk somebody putting making it doing a Chrome extension that as soon as I load it does something embarrassing on the screen which I seriously doubt no one in the audience really and that I've had those intentions but if you could just let me know what it does and maybe I can we can take a look what else is here whoa that's funny all right and so that's I think those are some things that people sent me on Twitter all right Cole if you make that sound effect please make it I'll use it anybody or it could be a I could have a lot of them I would love that okay search to Schiffman on twitter boy see breaking news I hate it right now breaking news I'm being told that you could search on Twitter to Schiffman I don't need the at Schiffman let's see and there we go and they I can actually just do latest and we can see oh here's an idea and make a QR code out of a bookmarklet that's interesting oh this is an important little clarification I saw in your live stream you used self calling anonymous functions well the reason you have to put in the parenthesis around the entire thing is because the parentheses are returning the object inside as a function and not as a reference thank you for that explanation I think I kind of understand that and also alka let me know that you don't actually need the wrapping function for a bookmarklet but otherwise you can run into scoping areas if you're just sort of in the global namespace all right I could appreciate simply a search engine type thing for your YouTube channel just opens a small window okay let's try it so I'm going to try echo 34 x' extension well this is exciting this we're living dangerously downloads do I have to be able to get this ready a dime oh the camera went off I need a looping snare drum okay oh okay oh yeah hold on here we go we're gonna go to Chrome colon slash extensions we are going to disable this one we are going to load an unpacked extension desktop no downloads Dan's extension select coding trains YouTube feed oh this is really intro I love this okay a excellent version number 0.1 that is the version number that I love as well Thank You Louise in the Patriots as you are on the office big screen for everyone to watch which office and everybody who's at the office go home go to your families and loved ones and friends enjoy Friday I know it's freezing in New York but maybe you're actually in an office in the tropics and you could just go have a nice walk on the beach and make a bonfire and have a salad although I don't think salad is a really good food for eating at the beach to be perfectly honest right I don't know what's a good beach bonfire bonfire that's a little bit scary don't that sounds a little dangerous actually be safe everybody okay version in the popup shows points you okay um coding train extension to in enable so how do I make this happen let's see let's just go to YouTube maybe I have to go to YouTube this is it here click it oh look at that I can search oh it's just maybe it's just a look at this so I haven't done popups yet I'm gonna do popups let's look for its person point to mmhmm version MIT smash there oh but maybe it's just maybe it magically upgraded in the time in between all right visit site where does that take me oh the coding train com so I took me somewhere weird but that's fine let me do this again and I but what so I assume I don't actually have to be on YouTube to look at this let's do this and so video name what's a video I'd like to I love you I love flowers don't have a video about flowers yeah I do I have a bunch that is wonderful the coding train No yay thank you echo this is the coding train Chrome extension maybe we could make a we could put this on github and make a community coding train Chrome extension that'll be great alright so thank you now what am I here to do this evening before up until about 630 let's see if I can do both of these things if I go over to my kind of road map here I want to get into popups can't erase this this Hestia this is gonna get erased I was going to take a picture of it but it's in the video so I don't have to I wouldn't get two popups and I want to do the new tab thing but I want to do two coding challenges I want to pause at content scripts only basically and do two coding challenges one whatever webpage you're on it just replaces all the images with images of kittens why not maybe it should be rainbows or unicorns or whatever but let's use do kittens and number two is I want to do a Content script that whatever web page you're on it allows you to draw over it using a p5 canvas and we saw a nice example from that I mentioned earlier today that has a much more sophisticated version so that's the two things that I'm planning to do and I'm gonna do those those coding challenges the question is when I do the coding challenges I like to start from nothing but I could just start from my basic content to know let's start from nothing I'm gonna it's not that much stuff to type and it kind of works that way so we're gonna do two content script coding challenges Chrome extensions well do I hear the train coming into the station it's a train if that's like it should be and then like the train comes in and there's like oh look it's our friend however remember and then the guests would be here but there's there's no guests maybe there's a guest it's completely empty in the hallway there's nobody around I should really just pick up this camera and bring it into the hallway no it's Jude it's too crazy okay back back cohhd cohhd cohhd cohhd cohhd see I was I took it very seriously this morning and I don't know what the point of that was all right so what I need to do is make sure that course like one thing that I need to do is get some kitten images I'm just gonna so this has it this is um Thank You Austin I think who showed me this website called unsplash.com if anybody can fact check me on this I believe I can use these images for free and they are public domain or their Creative Commons or something that I can use them in tutorial so let's get some of these kittens this one looks nice this one looks nice it does have an API and so I think as like a challenge is you could try to get the kids did I just do five I'm just gonna do five and oh they have people's names and them I shouldn't I download a couple of them twice so one two isn't there like that don't say aw aw challenge let me try it you have to like look at the image and not say aw Oh again try to get that alright you gotta love the kittens alright um I want to rename these you know what no problem I'm gonna leave their names because I want the people who took these images to have credit for them so let me grab these and I'm going to go to the desktop I'm going to go to Chrome extensions I'm gonna say Oh three kittens by the way I just wanted everyone to see this if I stretch it out did you get it pretty straight all right okay I think I'm ready and let me get Adam open and kittens all right license unsplash all photos published on unsplash can be used for free you can use them for commercial and noncommercial purposes you do not need to ask permission from or provide credit to the photographer or unsplash although it is appreciated when possible place kitten yep Gareth and the chat mentions Gareth and chap Benson's place kitten aye I do know about place kitten and I was thinking of using it but it doesn't seem to be working right now okay so I'm going to remove these extra extensions thank you again echo we use 34 underscore or YT 4 that was awesome if people are interested in doing like a community coding it got Chrome extension I'm open to facilitating that through the coding train github organizations so tweet at me at Schiffman if you want to participate in that now now I am going to uh people are asking about where this song came from what he's asking about that I think I could just make up stuff that people are asking in the chat and you guys won't know but you're watching and you can see the chat leader who people watch this back they won't know somebody was mentioning the song that they liked it but they weren't asking where it was I just made that up I want to show you guys something to which I think you'll find really amusing how can I show this to you mmm ok I have an idea this is kind of you guys are gonna find this to be quite amusing so I am just opening the camera on this webcam so I'm gonna turn it around and I want to show you the wall that's for the cameras this is what I thought would be helpful this morning yes I over here this is the camera this is very like meta now like weird meta craziness whoa I will shake hands with myself but I want this hand to talk to this end okay this is where the camera is this is my sign that reminds me to look here actually I didn't make this sign somebody else made the sign these for office attacks stop from Chrome extensions I thought usually I'd like no stuff off the top of my head and that sounds I don't I can look it up or but I thought let me try this I never I always get the thing where people say like oh I know what you do you you have a second computer and that has all the code and you just retype it which I never have actually done this is my first tip it's not a second computer that must be a much more logical thing to do but a little behind the scenes for you to today's coding train I hope you enjoy that okay I'm gonna come back around I'm over here I'm over here so much going on I'm gonna come back around what we're here now and I'm going to turn this back around and you can see this is me with a green wall for a public Lucchese shirt on and here we go oh this computer went off okay so anyway what do you see me like looking over there to figure out what goes in the manifest but I have no signs for me for the kitten stuff here we go yeah I guess there's a little green screen challenge for you all if you want to do some kind of weird take that video and key out the green that you saw Sarah Sarah alright let's let's go everybody I sorry I've I get lost in this beautiful kittens eyes so I'm gonna do a coding challenge right now and the coding challenge is the kitten eyes or chrome extension kit narrator kitten extension kitten Chrome extension chrome kitten at up I know what to call it somebody give me a name we'll put it in the first comment I'll pin it but I'm going to make a Chrome extension that replaces any image on any website that you're on with an image of a kitten I'm gonna do in a really simple basic way I made earlier today a bunch of tutorials about Chrome extensions I might suggest you go and watch those for more depth but I'm gonna still do this from no code at all the only thing I'm going to start with is these five kitten images and they all come from unsplash.com which is a website with free images these are the images that I have randomly picked for this coding challenge and as a challenge to you after I make this if it's successful you might think about making a version of this that pulls the images dynamically from unsplash or uses something besides kittens or tries to replace the image with the most appropriate kitten that matches what the image originally was I don't know use your imagination but let's get started so the first thing I need for a Chrome extension is what it is a file called manifest.json okay so what do I need in the manifest.json I need to say I need to have all the configuration stuff for my Chrome extension manifest version 2 which is the version of Chrome extension whatever that I'm making someday I'm gonna look up what this means but I think it used to put one but now you have to use two maybe someday you'll put three I don't know could you imagine a world in a world where the manifest version is number seven then I'm going to X kittens Gen X kitten shouldn't thank you that's a good good one okay Chrome kittens okay now I'm gonna say named X extension and then X kit tension I think like that X kitten should Chrome X kitten chin that's is not so great but we'll keep this for right now Bo version everybody knows what version this is right now say it with me 1 2 3 did you say point 1 yeah that's what I said I don't know whatever doesn't matter and I think I should put that in quotes who knows and then I'm making a Content script so what I need to do is have a Content script and it's content scripts cuz I could have multiple ones so I'm just gonna have one if you don't know what a Content script is you could go look at my previous tutorials which I will link to in the description and my content script this is going to be for see how do I do this Isis hard to talk and think and type at the same time all URLs so I want you might someday want to make a Chrome extension that only replaces kittens on particular websites only place images with kittens but I'm gonna do it for all URLs and then I need to have a JavaScript file where I'm gonna have all my code I think I say J s and then I could have multiple JavaScript files but I'm just gonna have one I'm gonna call it content J yes although you know what no I'm not no no I'm kidding getting done is okay now here's the thing let's just first make sure this works I got to deal with the images that's one thing I didn't do in my tutorials I probably got some syntax wrong here cuz I never get it right but I'm at least going to now make a new file which is called kitten J s and I'm going to just in that say console dot log kittens of the world unite as one okay so I will east now I'm gonna have a Chrome extension that when I go to any web page I will see this in the JavaScript console that's our first step and again if you want some of the details about how this is working go back and watch my I'm gonna stop saying that so now how do I install this I've got to be in Chrome at the URL Chrome colon slash slash extensions I've got to have developer mode enabled and then I can say load unpacked extension I can go and find wherever that was was on my desktop under Chrome extension zero three kittens so I'm going to select that and I didn't get any errors so if I had made a syntax error in manifest.json some stuff would show up here and then it's enabled I'm going to just turn off this other extension that's final leave it on and now I'm going to go to a web page like what's a good web page where we want to replace all the images with kittens I'm afraid to go to a news website although it will be nice to replace everything on the news website with images of kittens let me just go to go to the ITP website for right now just to just to see okay whoa oh this is something else this has nothing to do with me and we can see that this extension is working because kittens of the world unite as one there we go so my extension is working on the next thing I need to do is I need to figure out from my content script I need to look at the content and find all of the image elements on the page now there's probably a variety of ways that you can have an image but let's actually just play with this here for a second let's use the console to kind of like mess around to understand what we want to do so if I say images equal document get elements by tag name IMG hmm Oh images right so we got a bunch there's a whole bunch of images so that's good and we can see images has a property called source I believe somewhere in your boy there's a lot of stuff yes it's an attribute source and you can see that's the source of the image some are at Tisch gift preset square JPEG so what I want to do is look at all these images find that source property and replace what's in there with a URL to an image of a kitten now I'm not just any kitten the kittens that I happen to have as part of my extension of course they could be URLs to other places but I have these particular now I know I could probably load these in like an array but what I'm gonna do is let me just first let's this is gonna there's gonna be a little tedious go make yourself a cup of tea or something for a second so I'm just gonna paste the names of all these kitten images real quick into my I didn't want to change the names because I unsplash I don't have to you do not require to give credit but I can't go to the right place but I would like to give credit these are that I assume presume the name of the photographers maybe this is their kittens I think it so I have five five will be pretty good I think one of these days I'm gonna alt tab to the right thing there we go now I'm gonna grab this one there we go okay so now I've got the images here's the thing files inside just like in manifest.json I have to say ah I want this javascript file to be part of my content script I always also have to say I don't remember somebody in the chat correct me it's something like web accessible resources is that right somebody will correct me alright just I have the file names here thank you very much that would have been more efficient breaking news somebody I'll have that sound effect okay so I think what I can do now is just let's do something fancy I'm gonna do something fancy just for fun for no reason I'm gonna copy this into here I'm gonna do the fine I'm gonna get rid of all those slash slash space then I'm gonna do I'm gonna use a little regular expression and I'll show you what we do I'm going to do beginning of a line dot star question mark end of line this is a regular expression to find all of these things then I'm going to replace and I just want to do it I'm gonna replace it with and do I need to capture I need to capture this if you don't know about regular expressions might I refer you to my regular expressions tutorial that would pop up right here except there's no way for me to do that unless some magic postproduction thing happens I'm gonna replace this is really ridiculous that I'm doing this with quote dollar sign one end quote comma replace off boom now I have an around now I have it formatted to go into an array oh it needs to be double quotes for JSON that's fine uh so find a single quote replace it with a double quote there we go so now I have the web accessible resources and maybe somebody has told me I am being told breaking that is correct alright so web accessible resources so now these images are available to me as part of my Chrome extension so what I want to do if somebody by the way is watching this video could find me a good just like maybe in the in the patron group in the slack channel maybe you could post some links to some web sites that might be good to run this on that have nothing to upsetting or embarrassing on them it's all order I know with the internet familyfriendly coding show here everybody so now what I want to do is I lost my train of thought that's really ok so now what I want to do right so what was I doing over here let's get this I want to do this in the Chrome extension itself now remember a content script and let's say let's say file names and I can get this from that you know there's probably an automatic way of doing this but I am very prone to doing things in silly manual ways so I have an array now with all those file names and I'm going to ask for all of the image elements then then I'm going I know I'm using double quotes and single quotes in the same page don't everybody freak out all at once let's live with it let's come on we can do it double quotes and single quotes can be in the same page and everything will be ok all right now let me say my new favorite thing which is this fancy for loop thing that I learned about recently for image element of images I want to say I'm just gonna actually console.log image element SRC let's just do that so I just want to see the Chrome extension on any page that I'm on give me a list of and I'm just going to check the shot here for a second web accessible resources should be on the top level of the manifest also put them on a folder and just do so these are great suggestions from the chat thank you so let's make some improvements here silly me so first of all this is not necessarily specific to the content script this is a toplevel thing for the manifest thank you for that correction and there's no reason for me to do this when I can just say star jpg so this should be better so any images and by the way it would make more sense as I'm being told to make a folder called kittens and that way this is cleaning this up a little bit all of this goes in here then I can say kittens slash so how am i doing think I'm in better shape let's reload the Chrome extension and see what happens so I'm going to go back to here and hit reload right anytime you make changes in your chromic skit insertion hit reload hit refresh and I could see this is some nonsense that's happening nothing to it and I can see look here are all of the images that are on this page now the question is to do the there's gonna be a sizing thing that we have to deal with at some point but I'm not gonna worry about that okay example page image J nih.gov slash Doc's okay hold on let me find this you really need a good way of getting stuff from the slack chat into here can you give me a Google search Ruben to find that page okay so now what I'm going to do is I'm going to I think we're kind of so all I actually need to do is I want to say let R equal math.random times images o filenames dot length math.floor so I don't have not in p5 so I've got to do this with native JavaScript I want to get a random index and I could do this all sorts of other fancier ways I'm sure but I want to get a random math dot random gives me a number between 0 & 1 multiply it by the length of the array take off the decimal place and if I have 10 images getting a number randomly in 0 through 9 and then I want to say let source equal file names are and then I also need to do let URL so here's the thing I can't just say image alt equals image alt dot source equals source so here's the thing about a Chrome extension these files like where do they live they're part of the Chrome extension the source the source attribute of an image element on a web page has to point to a actual valid path and those chrome extension paths I live probably they're like a weird thing that we don't know it is fortunately for us the Chrome extension API so let's actually try to look up where this is Chrome extension Chrome extension Chrome what do I Chrome extension get URL image or something so I want to find it in the documentation ah extension dot get URL so this is what I want I want to say browser is this right I thought it was chrome dot extension oh is this like am I in the hah oh this is like a generic thing even higher level than this is just like a browser interestingly enough a lot of the stuff that's part of Chrome extensions while part of the chrome API is modeled off of this more generic somebody will know more about this than I do okay so I'm looking for this in chrome Chrome extension I just want to find the page get URL here we go this is what I'm looking for this is the API this is what I want so this is the documentation page on include some of these links in the video this is a Chrome extension this is part of the API and I won't get URL get URL gives you the URL of a path that's part of your Chrome extension so I should be able to say equals Chrome extension dot get URL source and let's call this file source is sort of the wrong thing and just because I'm curious let's actually do this let's put it in a variable and then set that to URL and I just want a console log that URL so here we go I think we're actually pretty good I think this is done we just need to find some better web pages to run this on oh I need to reload the Chrome extension I didn't work at all let's look at the consult mmm Dan nine load Oh wet resources must be listed in the web accessible resources manifest key in order to be loaded by pages outside the extension yeah yeah web accessible resources hmm oh wait a sec oh no oh oh I know what the problem is I put everything in a kitten's folder and then in my extension I forgot to say they all have to have the kittens folder prefix okay here we go again here we go again I have to reload let's find a better web page how about using lazy doubt house okay what's that is Z dot house hey what is this it's all kittens what's going on what kind of internet is happening here I'm I'm gonna be bold let's mess with let's let's just be bold and go to the New York Times and let's see if we can replace the image is on the New York Times with kittens Oh kittens kittens kittens kittens all right so we can see here there's some work to be done here oops let's just let's browse the web now Google Books let's let's just enjoy browsing the web NASA seems like a website that I might enjoy going to look at oh look and look at this NASA website what's happening in NASA these days but actually I like the fact that when I google image search for something like puppies it's all kittens look kittens oh boy kittens puppies but that's a kitten so even if I search for unicorns it's all kittens and I could go to the unicorn Wikipedia page and it is a so interestingly enough not everything is getting replaced so I probably should finish this video and be done with this yeah something's I'm being point out that the New York Times loads a lot of oh that was my extension working so that was my extent I went to hold on a second lazy what okay what is this website this is actually working I thought you guys were trolling me and giving you madeup website really quickly I had all the kitten images in it oh I'm losing my mind here so I'm going to disable the extension just for a second I should make it tie it to a button lazy house okay this is something about home automation and stuff you can do and now with the extension work I get it I get it I get it so interestingly enough not all images get replaced let's so near times for example I bet you load some images through JavaScript in a different way let's inspect this element here it is I don't know why so I'd have to investigate there's this looks like source it's like a thumbnail that it's actually looking at maybe over the image so there's all sorts of complexity with how different web pages work so we'd have to have to Wikipedia is not a good example of this let me think of one more let's just go to a Schiffman net there we go this is nice so thank you that you've got to definitely do quite a bit more to make this the robust kitten eyes there her Chrome extension that I always hoped it would be so let me give you some exercises if you want to follow along with this coding challenge think about other things that you might replace on a webpage how you might replace text how you might replace images how you might play sounds there's all sorts of possibilities there find a different set of images maybe you could actually use the unsplash api to dynamically pull different images I will post the code to this you will find a link to the github repository where this code exists in the video's description and in the next coding challenge I'm gonna do something very similar but instead of replacing with images may be able to leave the kitten thing here I'm gonna make a Chrome extension that I can draw over the page thank you for watching I'm sorry I'm looking at the chat now replace ads it uses the source set attribute right I could probably I'm sorry I'm reading the chat yes source set attribute but I've seen this question many times do I listen to Lady Gaga or Daft Punk I have listened to that music before I have heard it into my ears yes can it replace ads probably yes but you'd have to be more thoughtful about you'd have to be more thoughtful about your I mean I haven't done very much with this coat here like this is kind of all I got right it's not a lot of code alright so I heard a noise it's been scratching at the door maybe it's the cat army of kittens alright so I'm it's 615 I'm gonna do one more coding challenge and then I've got to go I'm gonna drink some water there's a spider on my head will you ever make a coding challenge on tictactoe with the minimax algorithm that sounds like a fun idea okay you guys are asking me so many good questions but I I'm gonna I'm gonna come back to questions later because let's let's move on to the next coding challenge maybe this one I'll start with the manifest.json file already and I'm gonna call this sketch j/s this is gonna be oh for sketch and we get rid of kittens and I'm also gonna get I want to get the p5 libraries let's go to let's leave this extension I should have been using github the whole time that would have been a good thing I don't know why I can't let's go to the p5 libraries oops I'm gonna leave this extension on always no releases what am I doing here code Rose releases how bout releases let's get p5.js and just in case we need Dom so what I'm going to do here now is copy these library files and put them in Chrome extensions sketch and I'm going to p5 sketch extension p5 sketch and ok so I'm gonna start this coding challenge with this manifest js5 and do everything else from scratch oh use let in for of loop otherwise you will create a global variable that oh thank you that's a good correction so I'm not going to go back and redo the video but at least in the code that I publish I will have that corrected thank you uhoh I totally did that wrong Thank You Alka so I added the wrong file so I can fix this no problem yeah put this here so I think I'm good now let me open this manifest.json and this sketch oh this should be empty okay here we go everybody the cold was a bad one and it really went away but there's still remnants Chrome extension coding challenge number two I'm also going in this coding challenge I just made one that replaces images with kittens if you didn't watch that already you can also check out the Chrome extension tutorial playlist for a lot of background information but in this video I'm going to attempt to make a Chrome extension for any web page that you're on like the p5.js library page that I can like doodle over it so and I'm going to do over it with a p5.js sketch so how do I do that so one thing is so I I did already one of the first things you need for a Chrome extension if you've watched me in other videos you already know this is a manifesto JSON file that is the configuration and all the information about your Chrome extension that you need so this being just a Content script I want it to work on any URL and more likely I probably want to do something where I press a button and then I can draw on maybe I get a pop up with an interface to pick the color but we'll get to all that later right now I'm just gonna do the simple thing that for any web page I could suddenly draw on it so I'm gonna put all the code for drawing in sketch j/s and just to show you what I mean like a simple p5 sketch would be something like this function set up function draw I'm going to say create canvas I'm just gonna just give some arbitrary size right now I'm gonna say I'm gonna like absolute position it so that it is over and I'm gonna say clear so I don't think I need to say clear I think by definition is cleared so that it's a transparent canvas and actually I'm not even gonna do that I just want to see the can on the page so I'm gonna say background zero so here's the thing now let me try running this extension let's see what happens so I put I I have this manifesto JSON I have this sketch let's load the extension let me close a bunch of this extra stuff if you're wondering why everything appears to be an image of a kitten it's because I'm still running my other Chrome extension so I'm going to I'm gonna keep that enabled I'm gonna load a new extension called because I can't turn off the kitten the one sketch and so again you need to be at Chrome slash lash extensions and you need to have developer mode on and you can find out more about this in some of my other tutorial videos p5 sketch version 0.1 is now running so let I'd probably should turn this one off but let's go to this web page now that I want to draw on open up the chrome console I'm gonna let this give myself some more space here I'm going to so actually it's time I've got to disable this because this extension is spinning out a lot of stuff in the console and I want to just look at this stuff for the p5 sketch so I don't see anything like the extensions I think nothing going on here well let me at least say console dot log sketch started sketch looping I know why this isn't working by the way and being I'm kind of like setting the stage here for what I want to talk about and then I'm gonna say console dot log its sketch blah okay so let's reload this extension reload and I'm hit refresh sketch blah but no set up a no draw so here's the thing well a couple things number one is I didn't include the p5 libraries I mean I have them in there I have sketched out yes p5 dot JSP five dong yes so I've got to at least in manifesto JSON reference those so let's say I'm a not p5 d'en bas and this be double quotes so I want all of these JavaScript libraries so this is by the way how you can reference another JavaScript library in a Chrome extension and I think there's a way to do this with a URL path I'll have to come back to that another time so I can do that let's reload the extension I'm gonna laugh if this works which it really shouldn't hit refresh ah there we go Oh Sita whoa oh my goodness it sort of did something well it actually ran set up whoa weird so interestingly enough I'm kind of intrigued by this because there's a thing that I was about to explain which is that I have to use something called instance mode opening up so I'm gonna just let's just just humor me for a second I'm gonna take out this and let's just see what happens now for some reason the Dom library didn't seem to work but the other stuff too which is weird let's run this again whoo weird oh it's there I'm shocked I'm shocked it just worked that's so weird but the Dom library stuff didn't work why does the order matter oh maybe it's just that interesting something changed since the last time I tried this this is gonna be much easier than I thought I thought I was gonna have to explain instance mode let's try putting the Dom library gigas they order late load in these orders let's try this again reload so now let me let's try sorry let's go back to sketch and let's let's use the Dom library now and once again reload again and it refresh yeah look at that huh well ladeeda so amazingly I can actually just put a p5 sketch in the content script maybe this is a bad idea for some reason it when I made an example for this last year I had to use something called instance mode and if you want instance mode is I will include a link to a video tutorial about that I thought p5 does this thing where it before to be beginnerfriendly it allows you to declare set up and draw in the sort of global world of JavaScript and for whatever reason I thought that that didn't work in a Content script and you had to kind of namespace things in the instance mode way these terms might not mean anything to you but you can watch that instance mode video if you're kind of wondering about that let's keep going so let's let's let's let's finish this off so I'm gonna take this out I'm gonna put clear in draw I'm gonna say a line from Mouse X Mouse Y to previous Mouse X previous Mouse Y and I'm gonna say stroke zero stroke wait for and what else do I want to do ah so this is the other thing I probably want to make the canvas fill the page so right now I'll just use window width and window height so let's go back now and reload hey where's my canvas let's see do I have an error sketch blah now alright let's let's see hmm so how do I D bug this mmhmm let's not put let's put a background here what a pain to reload can I just I can just do a refresh no okay refresh okay that worked ooh and it's there oh oh oh weird okay hold on a second so why didn't that work first of all I wanted this I want to say if mouse is pressed hmm so it's working that canvas is there it's interesting how its underneath some things and I wonder if that's kind of the issue so let's reload reload again somebody in the chat I'm sure it's telling me exactly what I'm doing wrong and then oh well it works I don't know why it work before okay so I can do things like I love p5 and I'm going to make a little hard so this is this is just a very beginning stuff here now here's the thing there's some some flaws here that I can give you I'm gonna scroll and I can't I can't draw down here anymore cuz that canvas is actually just a very is I said window width and window height so I could do something like get the body height I think of the whole page to make the canvas over the whole page but it could be a really long page another thing I could do is like move the canvas as I scroll I couldn't like just do the body height but I could also deal with zindex would be important which is a CSS property that allows me to put things book under and in front of so there's all sorts of like cleanup stuff I could do here but this is the basic idea now one of the things that I want to do is I also could make this have a popup where I could click a button here and have an interface to change the color and it would be gonna be interesting to think about what if this is something that then gets saved to I don't know local storage which is kind of like a database that's sitting inside of chrome itself or your drawings get saved to some server somewhere so when you come back to the web page your drawings are there you can share them with somebody else that's browsing the same webpage so many possible possibilities there's actually a project called shift space which is by Dan Pfeiffer and mu Shan shift space who Shawn Dan byebye this is a project from it and development ended up in 2011 but I encourage do you encourage you to check it out it's really interesting it was started by Dan Pfeiffer and Michaan's there Aviv so that's um which was a way that you could annotate web pages collaboratively and if you're browsing the same page as someone who's a friend of yours you're gonna see those annotations at the same time okay I'm looking there's positionfixed which would which would anchor it to the browser rather than scroll with the page but maybe you want your a anyway there's so many possibilities I'm gonna stop I'm gonna stop here this is what you can now do by putting a peu 5 sketch overlay now I will make one thing clear I can no longer click on these links because of the way that I've sort of like put this canvas over and what's happening with focus and mouse press so that's probably something you're gonna want to think about I wonder if I could set the zindex to further back it might then not get it might not get the mouse events then which is kind of an issue let's see so let's reload and let's run okay so I'm still able to draw but you can see the the links now work oh amazingly great why would it the canvas is still there from page to page so that's an interesting thing to know when you've gone to a new page or was that oh maybe that was not that was not that actually wasn't going to a new page that was like a refresh in the same page cuz right I'm I'm staying on the same page I'm just anyway there's so much can you mean could this video just have ended five minutes ago please thank you for watching I have made a Chrome extension and I hope to see that you did something creative with us with adding p5 GS to your Chrome extensions and I will be back again in the future with more tutorials in particular about popups more about messaging and more about using an API with a Chrome extension so many possibilities okay thanks for watching point your events none pointer events breaking news all right hold on hold on timeout let's let's pretend we can go back and redo the end of this video not to me maybe you can like I don't know because I feel like I was so scatterbrained where was I where I was drawing on the page so let's see so there's let me try to learn some of this stuff see style pointer events oh that's what I want none oh look at that I'm trying to understand why some stuff because I am going to a different page right going to this particular issue page and yet that remains there interesting all right let me go look first of all this is kind of messed up so I'm not to do your magic whatever you do is gonna be okay with me but I'm going to I'm gonna I'm gonna add this in but as if okay so one of the things whoops oh I have to relook oh wait a second I didn't reload the extension it's then Z X okay hold on let me reload the extension to what it was why did I think you had to use instance mode so one of the things you might notice here whoops one of the things you might notice here is that I've really messed with your ability to click on links because the canvas is kind of stole is overlaid on top of everything and it's stolen it's stolen a focus from all of the underlying stuff so thank you to me I am so me and others in the chat who have given me some good advice about this there are some CSS properties that I can try to add so since I've got the p5 library loaded anyway I could say see that style what was it pointer in the pointer events like this is a CSS property that will say like hey I don't want the canvas to receive any pointer events so those pointer events will pass through underneath now this might not totally work hit refresh so now I'm sort of able to get it but like it's working but and you can see yeah so this is kind of and interestingly you can see that the the canvas is still there that's because github is actually not going to new pages it's kind of refreshing within the same page but if I really went to a new page which like me went to the github home page yeah it's gonna go away so now this seems to be working fine it's doing some weird stuff with me like highlighting as I'm dragging the mouse around but I'd you know there might be some things I might need to also a property that I might need to work with is the Z index Z index is a CSS property that keeps track of things layered um so there's so many possible things I can start adding CSS wise to this but I think I'm gonna stop here so this is the basic idea I'm giving you a challenge to do afterwards number one is be more creative about what you overlay on top of the canvas this is just me drawing a line think be more thoughtful about how you handle the interaction maybe with some CSS and Z index as well as think about the page how you're gonna handle the full page let me figure out this body thing I'm pretty sure I can say client body height or something right somebody must know this sorry okay wait Papa Papa papa Bubba so hold on and that's you maybe let's make let me just look this up talk about everybody I don't like to do this but I'm going to the way that I did this I'm gonna look at my example from last year Chrome extensions it's funny still going p5 sketch this is what I did see look I did it with instance mode because I thought it wouldn't work document that body client height yeah that's what is document that body client height okay doc you Minister body client okay so I can get the height of the page by saying a document dot body dot client height I think and then so I could actually put that in here and so now if I reload the extension and I go back to github.com ooh look how slow this is now I mean I can draw all the way down here and I can keep scrolling but that's because I have this huge large canvas that's covering the entire thing so I probably have to be more thoughtful maybe I just like move it around or I have multiple canvases or I give it a sort of maximum amount cause it could be a really long webpage but you can see that's how I can actually get the full bodies height in pixels and I can draw all over the entire thing okay anything else that I want to add to this SVG would be better that makes a lot of sense outcomes that canvas is kind of a problem and that I'm and an SVG wouldn't have the same problem so I could do something like that and I think that's it so I look forward to seeing what kind of creative possibilities you make from this I will mention I think I kind of had this like crazy conversation about instance mode versus not instance mode I suspect that there could be some issues with me declaring global variables in the content script and if I'm using let I should be okay because let scopes thing in a different way but I you don't want to in theory there could be some conflicts between the JavaScript you're writing in your Chrome extension and the JavaScript that's executing on a page so maybe that's one of the reasons why at one point I did instance mode I'll just show you what that looks like because it happens to be on this page under these examples Chrome extensions and with p5 sketch so this is what instance mode looks like it's a way of having all the p5 stuff happen within namespace you always have to say p5 dot this or p5 dot this that way you're not running into there's only one kind of variable that's oh it's that's global this is so fun there's only one variable it's like a smart board except it's not very smart ok do it anymore of course it doesn't work now there's only one variable that's global ah I shouldn't make videos late in the evening when I really should just be gone so I hopefully this wasn't like enormous incredibly long with me rambling I hope you got something out of this and I look forward to seeing what kind of creative Chrome extensions you all make thanks for watching okay body dot scroll height could be used turnoff text selection that's another thing I could do as we're all so much smarter than me so anyway how's that I feel like that video was kind of a disaster but I think it can be made into something user select none okay fine hold on let's let's let's let's go from I got an idea sorry my tía let's go from here when I added that pointer event and I was on like what's it like six thirty seven we're fine oh I think I'm crashing it because of like how long this is so let's go back to I did it on a disease sorry it's on here you know it also the power is not plugged into this computer sometimes document.onselectstart function return false is that better then user select none on the body or that's the same thing we'll try a different thing we'll try some oh I have to do it in JavaScript so I could I could include CSS you can't include fields oh okay hold on reload I appreciate that you guys like the disasters they're an error sketch blah did I put Z and X in there or something it's funny how it's not working all of a sudden of course the camera goes off no sound document that body that style that user select equals none yeah thank you call no loop on Mouse released and loop on Mouse of how these are such good ideas but why isn't it even working at all why did it stop working let's go to like whoa that's something else this is so weird oh there we go I wonder if there's a loading issue and that's why you actually need instance mode I wonder if it worked by accident right good things not be loading in the right or because here's the thing you can't guarantee that all you can guarantee that the page has loaded but I don't think you can guarantee that all of these have loaded I think I just got lucky I know I used constraint right don't you think I think maybe you have to use instance mode because right it's only working like a random percentage of the time right of course now it's just working consistently right p5 didn't load it floating when I have the console open but not without it why is that right consoles not open who consoles open it loaded looks I think p5 actually hooks into the document load which has already happened so it's it's there it's called before you script or not is probably random yeah if it so don't you think that I need to do the instance mode thing that I've just got lucky all right where does this video is gonna keep on going I just want to hear from people I'm gonna wait and drink some water here so I think I'm gonna rewrite this with instance mode it might because I have it stored in my cache or something as I use p5 a lot well I really need this breaking news sound effect you could also totally hack in a second load of yes so that's the thing I mean I am swimming is saying you could also a hack in like I could write some JavaScript code to like load the p5 library and then but I think it's better for me just use instance mode so I think that's what I'm gonna do okay so that's yeah when you watch this first I am sorry second I think we're going to go from again I trust your judgement more than my own but I think we're going to go from where I add this I think we can leave everything up to and a lot of other stuff get cut but where I add this and I'm going to now realize that it's not working every time and I'm gonna realize that I actually really did need instance mode after all and I'm gonna add instance mode and what's gonna fix it then I'm gonna add Alka is again going to then because the chat in the slash settlement way past its gonna tell P what code to add again for the user select thing and then that's gonna be good alright here we go coding power form of p5 debugging person ok it's all my guy I really got to leave by 7 so here we go all right here we go I kind of want to put the kittens back do you think I can put the kittens back hello there was a weird edit point there but I discovered something while making this video tutorial look how nicely this is working this is me on my Schiffman net website and i refresh the page and it works nicely it draws I close the console i refresh the page again it's not working anymore Oh weird it's sort of worth so that's not working out no that it's working so here's the thing I think I got lucky remember earlier in this video I started rambling about this thing called instance mode well I think I got lucky in that V ok so a Content script by definition executes after the page has loaded but the page itself is not does not include the p5 library and the p5 these these I don't think the order of this really guarantees you much of anything could it could I put sketched a s first let's just try this I really don't think so I think p5 what it's does what the p5 library does is it looks for your setup and draw function and it that that Sketchup JS file might not really like the content script might not be available when it's like loading the p5 library and then something not finding the set of a draw function and everything so I might need to actually explicitly say like hey hello p5 here's my set up a draw function which I'm gonna show you how to do in a minute using something on instance mode unless this fixes the problem but really do you really think they load in that order in some way that's logical but that doesn't make any sense cuz sketch would have to come after I can't load it first let's try so I'm gonna go to reload this extension reload I'm gonna hit refresh huh not working oh now it's not working at all oh now it is working it's the same thing I think I'm getting lucky sometimes and not because maybe I have things cache things over to ram or somebody much smarter than me we'll know detective but I I think I really want this to work I am going to have to I'm going to have to use instance mode and I'm getting some other Oh me I am Sania Singh I can all global in it to make p5 checkin again so let's try that so I kind of want to show you instance MA but that's sort of interesting you mean I could just say like here global in it which is like I could do something like this which is like a secret function as part of p5 really in the weeds here in this videotutorial supposed to be like why is this video why is this particular video 7 hours long that didn't work oh now it worked p5 global in it okay I'm I'm going to what about my eyebrows I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and do what I think will work which is instance mode so what is instance mode I have a video tutorial about it it's a way of name spacing everything in your p5 sketch and kind of wrapping it into a function so what I'm going to do is I think I have to say let's look let's let's go to let's go to the p5.js wiki because you might as well know about this page which has a little tutorial about instance mode and by the way sometimes oh I'm like killing okay first of all let's disable the extension and let's go to instance mode it's probably under I because I start global and instance mode so this webpage is going to explain this is global mode everything living in the global namespace this is instance mode so I am going to just copy this over and I'm gonna I'm gonna probably change this to using let instead of R and that sort of thing but I'm basically going to take this out and I'm gonna put my code in there whoops and what I'm gonna do is put it in here and I'm gonna say how did that work I need to say sketch dot setup you function I'll try to explain a little bit more about this and sketch dot draw equals function and then everything that's a p5 function I just say sketch dot so sketched out create canvas sketched out clear sketched out stroke sketched out scrote stroke weight if sketch dot mouse is pressed sketched out Mouse X sketched out mouse Y sketched out P Mouse X sketched out P Mouse Y and then this is fine so this is just now this is actually instantiating the p5 sketch I'm getting some more these are injected in the order they appear in the array so from breaking news from the Chrome extension API this order actually does matter they are injected in into the script in the order that they're in the array so let's do this I think sketch touches should be last and now what I'm going to do is this should be exactly the same now this is instance mode it's the same exact sketch but I've so let me explain a little bit what's going on here what I'm doing is I'm saying I want to make I want to make a new P 5 thing and so normally this happens automatically the p5 library starts to make its own P 5 thing by looking for your global setup and draw but here I'm saying I'm gonna make this wrapper function and it's going to have setup attached to it and draw attached to it and this whole thing is the thing you can make the p5 sketch from a bit more to it that you can read the wiki page but that's the basic idea let's see if this works I'm sure I made some mistakes Oh window with is that's a p5 variable so sketch that window with I think I'm gonna have to say all right let's see what happens here so one thing I want to do by the way is I'm gonna just change this to I want to change this to sketch dot window height again just so it's just so it's only covering part of the page because that really just slow it down if it tries to make a sketch a canvas the size of the whole body alright so let's now reload the extension enable the extension reload the extension and refresh the page okay and hold on refresh the page uncaught reference this line is not defined who sketched outline thank you very much so it's very easy it's kind of like forgetting this dot I kinda have sketched out for everything that's p5 so I'm going to reload the extension again I'm gonna come back here hit refresh there we go this works hit refresh again it works I'm gonna get rid of the console ah so now it's working consistently no matter what I do let's make one more thing a little nicer about this notice how I keep selecting the text box in it while I'm drawing out cuz the chat gave me some code to do that I see it now I can change I can affect the CSS of the entire body and set the user select property to none so user selects the property meaning making something available to be selected and so what I'm gonna do here in setup is I'm going to say document dot body dot style right dot user select equals none so and I kinda I don't know why but I have this like habit of doing this because a lot of the CSS properties are not valid keywords that you can just say dot like background color you wouldn't be able to say style dot background color but so you can user selected work cuz it's like a valid variable name so let's try adding this see if that's in the right place I'm going to reload the extension refresh and now there I am drawing it's not selecting the text I can still click on the links I can go over here I can draw on here and then I can also because I can also enable my chrome kitten extension I can go to this web page and I can draw oh I can draw books I can draw I can draw on the kittens yay I love you kitten oh you're a star kitten rainbow okay Oh are you still watching this video cuz I'm just gonna be here doodling on this webpage for a while okay so I'm gonna leave it here I did show you how you could actually create the canvas to be taller with document.body that client height one other suggestion from Austin and the chat said I could start with no loop and only render when I'm actually drawing that'll actually really help with performance as well of course there was another suggestion being like well if you just used SVG's you don't have this giant canvas that's probably a much smarter idea but the point is I'm showing you how you can have a canvas overlay with p5 and load P 5 P 5 library and by the way you can load other libraries the same exact way whether you want to use jQuery or a 3 J s or anything this is the same exact way so I hope you enjoyed this coding challenge about creating a canvas overlay p5 sketch in a Chrome extension content script if you made it through this whole video MA thank you something good bye where did I forget sketch dot did I did I I finished that video finally didn't I I see lots of facepalm emojis keep going I am learning I see there's an interesting there's a discussion maybe about the Chrome extension it's it scrolled past me so I can't see it I see me I am to be an echo or discussing something I'm happy to engage in that discussion kebab case in the bracket notation wouldn't work Oh sketch dot on line but I fixed it okay great can I go home now so this by the way I know how I like this is to live streams in one day I'm glad I was able to do this especially cuz I missed last week I haven't gotten I would say I've only gotten like halfway at most through the Chrome extension stuff let me look at my examples actually so I'm gonna come let's first of all let me turn off these Chrome extensions well I'm gonna leave the kitten went on obviously let's go to github.com slash Schiffman rainbow code so I am going to whoops oh no coding train let's look at the calendar here readme edit I don't know who I'm logged in as I think I might be logged in as myself so today was Chrome extensions next week we need to continue Chrome extensions so what do I need to do I need to do popup popup with messages I need to do what else I want to do what's the thing called where you tab override I mean I think I'll skip the omnibox thing I mean it's there I could get to it someday but you know omnibox probably should skip I definitely want to do WebGL I got a bump Alexa skill so I don't know what I'm gonna get to work to vac I'm in a bump so I think this is what I think I should continue the Chrome extension stuff next Friday and maybe look at WebGL see if I can get to some of these I'm open to your suggestions but that's kind of my plan oh I turn alright alright alright let's put it on let's put it on the agenda it's not on the agenda anywhere in here oh it's here so we have some extra bull bull we'll put a bayesian ticket by the way as you can see this document oh you can't even see what I'm doing I apologize you can all pull request this document to try to get me to change my schedule oh but maybe there's actually a helpful way you can make this better so I will be back next Friday it definitely won't be in the morning next Friday I know I have an appointment and some other stuff so I don't know if this is the exact time but this will be it'll be something like this so let me commit this changes so I kind of remember and pull requests here okay Oh somebody Thank You Lucas could be a little added awesome amazing look at this wonderful thank you I need a like a really great like thank you you win Lucas for your contribution you win my undying gratitude thank you and I apologize if I've got your name wrong Lucca kabil sorry I said Lucas the github name is Luca qabil Thank You Luca good night everybody this has been the coding train with your host me i term yes Austin I turn will be our new new Chrome extensions joke I appreciate you enjoying that Ricardo asks I'm gonna do a couple questions here from the chat before I go do people recognize you on the streets and ask for selfies no if I go to like when I went the processing day and there are lots of people there who came because they know frosting and watch videos people recognize me or they just said hi to me and maybe I took a couple of pictures but I you know I've have a pretty low profile nobody's the record axis behind the street check Twitter know what the answer is always in doubt don't check Twitter Twitter is kind of a really awful place all this 280 characters nonsense I can say hello to shy L I am 44 years old do we have any plans that come to the UK for any reason I would really love to come to the UK I was talking about this earlier today I did live in London in 2015 for about 8 months and had a wonderful time there visited all over the place around the UK and went up to Scotland what to Cornwall I never made it over to Ireland and I had lovely time there so I hope to yes I hope to be back sometime alright what is the best video for me to watch I don't know you're gonna I think that chat should help you with that question let me I haven't done the little goodbye song in a while Oh fiftyone thousand three hundred and forty eighty four thousand seven hundred forty eight seventy one thousand five hundred sixtyeight fifty three thousand four hundred eighty three I really need a system like I could get through this whole book if I actually I look I hear there's a thing called a bookmarklet do you think there's a bookmarklet for this I'm gonna use this it's the ITP winter show postcard today is the day I'm gonna start from the first page of random numbers that is maybe I should actually just read the whole thing I should start with the forward I'm gonna read everything in this book and then someday somebody will splice it all together as one video okay let's make an agreement on that well how long do you think when will this be done I have no idea but every time I come on or I have a guest I'll do a little more and eventually the whole thing will be available the audio book for a million random digits with video accompaniments maybe I shouldn't play the lullaby because that's gonna make it so people can't remix and do stuff with the audio later hmm so right now I won't do it with the lullaby music this by the way this is a momentous occasion I'm deciding right now that I'm gonna start from the absolute beginning of this book the cover and I'm gonna read every single word and number that's in this book hopefully before I you know we're whatever happens

order at Randwick I'm starting to think I should have skipped that page when somebody makes the full compilation that can be edited out or not so I'm gonna read right now just the forward it's kind of long actually but I'm gonna read the foreword forward the volume you are holding documents are remarkable undertaking by a group of mathematicians engineers and data processors at Rand in the 1940s and 1950s the corporation's formative years to create a very large assembly of randomly distributed numbers or digits within such an assembly if it is truly random no pattern of occurrences whatsoever as measured for example by frequency or by serial Association exists regardless of the users starting point in the array pattern lessness is in fact salt for ideal to what purpose in a recent article in the science section of the New York Times the author George Johnson explains for cryptography game playing sociological surveys and various scientific calculations people often need series of numbers that are devoid of pattern and that is a tall order generating true randomness is one of computer sciences most difficult challenges so there's a footnote reference to George Johnson connoisseurs of chaos offer a valuable product randomness through New York Times June 12 2001 given a state of randomness predictability fails in a decimal table the probability for the occurrence of the next digit is everywhere the same whatever the number selected from 0 through 9 once they are equipped with a sufficiently large sequence of random digits like the present one political poll takers for example can confidently calculate outcomes that depend on probability assumptions in the area of engineering use of the tables assemble it here assemble tear can save both time and money take the problem faced by a quality control team tasked with inspecting critical welds in an aging metal bridge instead of in effect dismantling the structure to accomplish the mission the inspectors can select a sufficiently large random sample of welds for examination a reliable surrogate for the whole bridge and proceed to measure the integrity of the complete structure or consider the case of a submarine commander who is reported to have kept the copy of the set of tables by him on patrol duty using selections from it to randomize a jinking course for purposes of evasion early in the conduct of rand research a demand arose for random numbers to be in solving problems by probability procedures known as Monte Carlo methods existing tables of such numbers were limited in size applied to ran problems they would have have to be used repeatedly thus introducing the danger of unwanted correlations the construction of a table with the capacity of the present one resulted from ingenious exploitation of punched card computational techniques then available has become a standard reference in engineering and Econometrica textbooks details of the production of the one million random digits contained in this volume are provided in the introduction several short tables draw on the expected and the actually observed frequency of occurrence of familiar poker hands together with a goodness of fit calculation an electronic roulette wheel if you will was used to yield the basic randomization the team members then applied rear and omission steps to produce the random digits of the whole modern random number generators use radioactive decay or atmospheric noise among other methods the 100,000 normal deviates cited in the title of this volume constitute a subset of random numbers whose occurrence can be plotted on a bellshaped curve Rand legend has it that this seemingly selfcontradictory mathematical expression caused the Newark Public Library to miss shell the volume in the psychology section the volume you hold was first published by the Free Press in June 1955 it had sold 500 copies by October by September 1971 the collection was in its third printing and it sold nearly 7,000 copies after a distinguished history as a standard reference it went out of print in 1989 and was placed in rands reprint series RP 295 to reach a wider audience in a more fitting form it is today being reissued as a Rand monograph report this is written by michael d rich executive vice president of rand so that's the foreword which explains how this is a reprint one of these days I'm gonna get myself a copy of an original prime know if that exists have to look on ebay and so I'm now realizing interestingly enough that yeah there's some this is a copyrighted and there might be some issues with me producing my own audiobook P without doing it slowly over time in pieces on a YouTube channel no I don't know if you're a lawyer out there heretics or if you know somebody at the rehab corporation to think I'm to get into trouble doing this please let me know but so far all I did was read the introduction which probably falls under fair use not to mention the fact that I'm promoting this book in fact if you oh I should do like an Amazon thing but if you want to get it I will include a link to the reprint on Amazon alright so thank you everybody thanks for watching thanks for tuning in thanks for being here again if you want to support the work that I'm doing you can join the patreon I always appreciate that it helps out and I hope to see you next Friday and if any of you will be at CC fest in New York though it's already sold out it's free but it's full please say hello to me I will be at CC fest dot is it rocks or NYC CC fest rocks which is apparently all about kittens thank you very much alright do I have any plans on doing a tutorial on the neat algorithms yes I do neuroevolutionary stuff the whole book is available for download for free from the rand website that's a good point good night I will be here for two and a half more minutes or I'm happy to answer any questions that I see in the chat can I get some free stickers for my classroom send me a tweet at Schiffman if I can mail you some stickers for your students I would love to do that that's a question from Peter thanks for asking good morning I guess some people are waking up it is 710 I'm gonna get home by 8 o'clock I think do I have anything planned for Christmas well I am of a certain persuasion where I do not celebrate the holiday Christmas although it does get celebrated quite a bit around me I hope to get some time to relax and spend time with family and friends and not code very much I might be getting a Nintendo switch though anyway everyone's wanting to free stickers now listen so the stickers are something that I will mail to you as part of the patron rewards it does take me quite a while if you really want the stickers the best way is to come to an event that I'm going to where I can hand you some stickers and there's also a ticker mule link you can just buy them online but they're kind of expensive so but I I'm definitely happy to send stickers to say a group of students in a public school somewhere or something as a gift but just randomly sending stickers to everybody in the world I'm not sure I can do that easily yep had Daniel gue hey is going to get some pointless recognition I am going to combine neural networks with evolutionary algorithms that is a plan of mine and or asks are we able to live without coding I mean I think so we're probably just ruining I mean this coding stuff I don't know if it's really helping that much so think about think about doing some good for the world and always ask the question is is what I'm coding should I be doing it is it actually a good idea can you please shout out my library called see creative which is a csharp version of processing so see creative as a csharp version frosting I haven't seen it a tweet me a link at Schiffman I love to take a look uh here's a question whoops I'm gonna look I'm not even looking at oh there's an oh yeah there's some amazing Amazon reviews I think of a random number book oops it's gone okay ah Peters asking I'm going to have my students recreate a coding challenge for their end of semester final project let me know where you send me get send me a tweet like where are you teaching maybe I can I have 280 characters now this is ridiculously annoying so maybe I could respond to you that way with some ideas but people from the chat write in the chat which of the coding challenges might be good I don't know if your students are in college in elementary school where they are in the world what their background is so that that kind of information would be helpful in terms of which coding challenge okay Wow mouseka Mouse Moscow Russia is watching amazed by the international audience here oh wait this was my bookmark you viewers of the coding train please help me remember maybe we can put this somewhere on the Internet I am on the contents table of contents it will put this bookmark in here but I will not be surprised if it gets moved so somebody invents a system to keep track where I am in the million random book um thank you all for watching I will see you next Friday and I don't know thank you I'm gonna stop streaming now I suppose I just don't want to leave but I should cuz I feel like I haven't wrapped up things properly like I just said this or say this other thing and I could have thought of this thing but I really just have to go what's that what guy just can't say the thing that I want to say that mix everything sum up so nicely so I will just say goodbye send me or breaking news coding train sound effects and make sure there's a copyrighted in them because otherwise YouTube will kind of go after being Monti monetize everything and there we go goodbye
