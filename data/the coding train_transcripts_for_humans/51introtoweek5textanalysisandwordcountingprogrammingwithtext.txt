00:00 - hello welcome to session five of
00:02 - programming from A to Z which is like a
00:05 - thing that I'm doing on the internet on
00:07 - YouTube some tutorials topics around
00:11 - programming with text now on the one
00:14 - hand you could divide this course this
00:18 - set of playlists together into two parts
00:21 - there's analyzing text and there's
00:25 - generating text and today's session is
00:29 - really about and/or you can also think
00:30 - of that as reading text and writing text
00:33 - right and most of the projects that I've
00:35 - been demonstrating or that I will show
00:37 - or talk about do some combination of
00:39 - both maybe they read in a source
00:40 - material mash it up chop it up and
00:43 - generate something from it today though
00:45 - I really want to focus on the reading in
00:48 - of text the analysis of text so when I
00:50 - say today I mean what I'm doing right
00:53 - now but ultimately the set of tutorials
00:56 - that I'm going to make so if you I'm
00:57 - gonna give you a sort of summary of the
00:59 - topic I'm going to show you some
01:00 - relevant projects that might inspire you
01:02 - with ideas but if you want to just get
01:04 - to the coding part you can skip to the
01:06 - next video in this playlist you should
01:08 - be in the session five or a week five
01:09 - programming from A to Z playlist so the
01:12 - building block so text analysis by text
01:14 - analysis I mean reading in a text
01:17 - analyzing it and producing some result
01:19 - that could that result could be
01:20 - sentiment analysis it's a positive text
01:22 - as a negative text it could be ah this
01:25 - text is very similar in style to another
01:28 - text there are so many different kinds
01:31 - of ways you can about this is a
01:33 - difficult text and easy text you can
01:35 - imagine what kinds of outcome
01:36 - statistical analysis whatever you could
01:39 - do from reading and text with the
01:41 - computer program but the we need a
01:43 - building block and the building block
01:45 - for every single one of these text
01:47 - analysis examples of scenarios and that
01:49 - I will present and show you how to code
01:51 - is word counting actually we're counting
01:54 - is a totally simple thing and this is
01:56 - not a new thing so I'm gonna pop over to
01:58 - this Wikipedia page here on this idea of
02:00 - a concordance so it concordance
02:04 - concordance concordance a concordance is
02:07 - an alphabetical list of the principal
02:09 - words used in a book or body of work
02:11 - listing
02:11 - of each word with its immediate context
02:13 - blah blah blah blah blah what that means
02:15 - is a concordance is hey I want to know
02:18 - all the words that were in this text and
02:20 - I want to know how many times they
02:21 - appeared and where they appeared so I'm
02:23 - gonna do something simpler when I build
02:25 - an actual code example which is just
02:26 - here's a list of all the words in a text
02:28 - and how many times those words appeared
02:30 - and this is not something that's just
02:33 - sort of a computing thing this has been
02:36 - done you know this has been done by hand
02:38 - many years with you know you know well
02:41 - you know this used to be done by hand
02:42 - and so there's some information here
02:43 - about biblical concordance is you know
02:45 - reading the text manually making this
02:47 - big list making references you know an
02:49 - index in a way it's very similar to a
02:51 - concordance in many ways as well it's a
02:53 - sort of list of topics and where they
02:56 - appear in a particular book so I
02:58 - encourage you but you can see that here
03:01 - again this list I think is useful I am
03:04 - this is hello this is Daniel Shipman
03:07 - reading you a Wikipedia page on the
03:09 - internet but this is kind of useful
03:10 - context and it has some nice it's kind
03:14 - of or it some nice reference material
03:16 - for you to like kind of expand further
03:17 - into this territory but you can see this
03:20 - idea of analyzing one thing you can do
03:23 - with the concordance is is try to figure
03:24 - out are there key words associated with
03:26 - a piece of text one of the examples I'll
03:28 - show you is a term frequency inverse
03:31 - document frequency algorithm that pulls
03:33 - out key words from a text and all sorts
03:36 - of other things that you can do with a
03:38 - concordance algorithm so let me show you
03:41 - some examples so first of all here's a
03:43 - great example this is by rune Matson and
03:45 - they'll be in this video's description
03:46 - they'll be links to all these projects
03:48 - this is called speech comparison it's a
03:50 - project created in processing and this
03:53 - is a kind of what you might typically
03:55 - see as a kind of example project idea
03:58 - with a text concordance this is
04:01 - visualizing a bunch of speeches by these
04:04 - particular speakers and counting all the
04:09 - counting words and you can see here a
04:10 - list of words that appear in the text
04:12 - and then drawing a color-coded
04:14 - visualization of the frequency of that
04:18 - term you can see here climate mmm
04:20 - climate is used a lot by this purple
04:23 - person I like to think of
04:25 - myself as a purple person I don't know
04:27 - what color you think of yourself I think
04:29 - was almost purple and you can see that
04:31 - person is Al Gore you know well-known
04:34 - and famous for his work in climate I was
04:38 - gonna say climate science but I don't
04:39 - that's accurate
04:40 - you know promotion or getting the
04:43 - message out there about the issue of
04:44 - climate change and so this is something
04:47 - you might think about doing how could
04:48 - you creatively visualize the words that
04:53 - appear in a given text let me go show
04:57 - you another project by Sarah Groff
04:58 - Palermo this project is called BookBook
05:01 - and I encourage you to take a look more
05:03 - deeply at this project but I'm going to
05:04 - click here this is a comparison of the
05:07 - jungle by Sinclair versus the jungle
05:09 - book by Kipling and I'm gonna click on
05:11 - this and what you're seeing here is what
05:14 - are the words that are unique to one
05:16 - text but not in another text so this is
05:18 - something you could also really do with
05:20 - word counting and look at a comparison
05:22 - of two texts by the way this is how spam
05:25 - filtering works let's look at all of my
05:27 - emails which are not spam and count all
05:30 - the word frequencies in those and let's
05:32 - look at all of my emails that are spam
05:33 - and count all the frequencies in those
05:36 - and then build a statistical probability
05:39 - that a new email fits into one of those
05:42 - categories and you can see it's not just
05:44 - about what is what kind of words are in
05:46 - a spam email it's all about the
05:47 - relationship of spam to regular emails
05:50 - and you can get one one way to think
05:52 - about this by the way is you know I get
05:53 - a lot of spam emails that are trying to
05:55 - sell me like a mortgage so mortgage is a
05:57 - word frequency that appears very in a
05:59 - lot of my spam emails but let's say and
06:03 - so that's a good indicator but if I were
06:04 - a mortgage broker I probably get a lot
06:06 - of actual mortgage emails so that word
06:08 - wouldn't be as relevant to me so just
06:10 - detecting it just word frequency in one
06:12 - document but how it compares to others
06:14 - is kind of a key way to do text analysis
06:16 - and we'll see some examples of that you
06:18 - can also look Sara's project also has
06:21 - the ability for you to look at the words
06:25 - that appear in both texts I believe if I
06:27 - click over to see that both of them
06:29 - together
06:30 - what another wonderful work in data
06:34 - visualization another artist I love is
06:36 - Stephanie possa Beck and Stephanie has
06:39 - a lot of work with I said a lot of work
06:41 - with hand-drawn data visualization she
06:44 - has a beautiful project with Georgia
06:45 - noopy called dear data which they sent
06:48 - these data visualization hand-drawn
06:50 - postcards to each other look that up
06:51 - find it and put a link in this video's
06:53 - description but she worked on a album
06:55 - cover for okay album artwork for okay go
07:00 - and doing visualization of word
07:02 - frequencies in their song lyrics you can
07:04 - see how some of these came out what that
07:07 - what kind of visual quality they have
07:08 - and you can also sort of see like what's
07:10 - going on here there's some diagrams
07:12 - showing exactly you know parts of speech
07:15 - concordance common words that are both
07:19 - common to both text counting sort of
07:21 - like what texts have different syllables
07:23 - in and so sentence length so there's a
07:25 - lot of ways you can use that sort of
07:27 - just raw numbers of a text to glean
07:29 - something from it and to sort of play
07:31 - around with different visual ideas so
07:33 - this site these are ideas that I
07:35 - encourage you to think about what's a
07:38 - text that really interest you where can
07:40 - you get text by the way let me mention
07:42 - here also if you're thinking about
07:43 - places you might look for texts examples
07:47 - and I think I just have two links on
07:49 - this page here and you know send me or
07:54 - your links and I'll add them to this
07:55 - page but Project Gutenberg is certainly
07:58 - one that you might explore Project
07:59 - Gutenberg is an online repository of
08:03 - texts that are in the public domain so
08:05 - there's Jane Austen's work is there all
08:08 - of William Shakespeare's plays are there
08:10 - you'll find lots of other thing I have
08:11 - one I have an ode example that does a
08:13 - text concordance for Pride and Prejudice
08:14 - so this is something that you might
08:17 - consider looking at you can get the text
08:19 - in in raw txt files which are convenient
08:22 - to use in a project okay so this is sort
08:25 - of the summary of this building block so
08:27 - what are the things that I'm going to
08:28 - show you that you can use this idea of
08:31 - word counting for and how will I
08:33 - demonstrate it what was what is going to
08:35 - be in these next videos so the examples
08:37 - I'm going to first just show you the
08:40 - basics of how to in JavaScript read in a
08:43 - body of text count how many times each
08:46 - word appears and sort that list in order
08:49 - of frequency now in conceptually it's a
08:51 - very simple thing to do I
08:52 - could do it you know by hand but how you
08:55 - do that in a computer program opens up a
08:57 - topic which is about something called an
09:00 - associative array so what is an
09:02 - associative array sometimes referred to
09:04 - as a hash map or a dictionary so I'm
09:06 - gonna make a video just about this topic
09:08 - what is an associative array and how can
09:09 - you implement one in JavaScript and I
09:11 - might mention a bit about how you can do
09:12 - it in processing in Java as well and
09:14 - then I'm gonna build a word counting
09:16 - application simple word counting
09:17 - application it won't do an interesting
09:19 - visualization but you could take it and
09:21 - visualize it in your own way I mentioned
09:24 - to you that you could do the same thing
09:25 - but with counting parts of speech and
09:27 - then I want to look at keyword
09:29 - extraction using algorithm called tf-idf
09:32 - or term frequency inverse document
09:34 - frequency where I read it where you'll
09:36 - read in multiple texts and look at words
09:38 - that are unique to one text but not in
09:41 - the others and that's a way of knowing
09:43 - well the appears in a lot of text but
09:45 - not necessarily the so that it's not a
09:50 - keyword even though it appears very
09:52 - frequently but in the rainbow Wikipedia
09:54 - article rainbow appears a lot but it
09:56 - doesn't appear in a lot of other
09:57 - Wikipedia articles so this idea of
09:59 - inverse it's in its frequent in this
10:02 - document but not frequent in other
10:04 - documents I'm gonna look at that
10:05 - algorithm and I don't think I'm gonna be
10:08 - doing this today but at some point in
10:11 - this playlist hopefully it will also
10:13 - appear a set of lessons about doing text
10:16 - classification is it spam or not spam
10:18 - using Bayesian probability so this is a
10:21 - complex topic it's I'm gonna have to
10:23 - just spend another full day on that
10:25 - probably and I want to also mention how
10:26 - you might do this stuff in processing in
10:28 - Java and also maybe server-side
10:29 - programming with node so that's kind of
10:31 - the summary of the things and then I'll
10:33 - come back at the end and I'll talk you
10:34 - through some exercise ideas ah and this
10:37 - reminds me so I want to I want to talk
10:39 - about something of this video you could
10:42 - could very well be over but it's not
10:44 - because I want to talk to you about one
10:45 - of my favorite books that I've read
10:47 - called the secret life of pronouns by
10:49 - James W Pennebaker I encourage you to
10:52 - read this book I will link in this
10:54 - video's description to Pennebaker
10:56 - TED talk which gives kind of a 20-minute
10:58 - summary of the topic but here's the
11:00 - thing I mentioned before sentiment
11:02 - analysis so let's think about that
11:05 - sense of analysis I want to know is this
11:06 - text positive or negative well I might
11:09 - look for content based words what kind
11:12 - of there is the word happy joyful are
11:14 - those frequent or is the word sad or
11:16 - depressed are those frequently used so
11:18 - this idea I've always thought at least
11:21 - that text analysis is associated with
11:23 - word frequencies analyzing word counts
11:25 - but looking at the sort of big words the
11:28 - content words the descriptive words
11:29 - James Pennebaker who's a psychologist
11:32 - who's done a lot of work with analyzing
11:34 - the ways that writing can help people
11:37 - get through trauma discovered something
11:39 - I you know from what I understand in his
11:41 - research somewhat accidentally because
11:43 - he started out also looking for these
11:44 - content words but what he discovered is
11:47 - you know and in text and Alvin we're
11:48 - counting what you're often doing is
11:49 - saying like oh I'm always getting za and
11:51 - she and she and I and me and my they I
11:55 - should just make a list of stop words or
11:58 - junk words to ignore and that's kind of
12:00 - a common technique but what he
12:02 - discovered was that these words actually
12:04 - unlock oh the key in many ways to
12:07 - analyzing the emotional state of an
12:09 - author and lots of other properties of
12:12 - an author is an author or a speaker
12:13 - lying or telling the truth the use of
12:16 - the personal pronoun IV or my the
12:19 - frequency of that reveals a lot about a
12:21 - person's status in relationship to
12:23 - another person status so I encourage you
12:25 - to think about that and one of the
12:26 - exercises for this week could be to
12:29 - implement a sort of interactive system
12:33 - based on some of Pennebaker czar
12:35 - research so you could read the book and
12:36 - i'll point you to some resources where
12:38 - you can kind of get some more
12:40 - information about his research as well
12:42 - and and just to plug it a little bit
12:44 - more I'll mention something that I would
12:45 - encourage you to do secret life of
12:48 - pronouns when we go to the website is
12:52 - click on the exercises at the top and
12:58 - you can I would encourage you to try
13:00 - some of these don't click on them to
13:02 - look at them and think you're gonna try
13:03 - them later because you want to come to
13:05 - them fresh they're gonna ask you to
13:06 - write for 5 or 10 minutes and then it's
13:07 - gonna analyze your text for you but I
13:09 - encourage you to try these little I
13:10 - think you'll learn a lot about text
13:12 - analysis and about yourself and sort of
13:14 - thinking about project ideas or
13:16 - this space okay so I'm gonna get started
13:18 - actually looking at code and talking
13:20 - about the technical stuff now and in the
13:21 - next video I'm going to talk about
13:24 - associative arrays in JavaScript
13:26 - okay look forward to seeing you there
13:27 - hopefully maybe
13:38 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to session five of programming from A to Z which is like a thing that I'm doing on the internet on YouTube some tutorials topics around programming with text now on the one hand you could divide this course this set of playlists together into two parts there's analyzing text and there's generating text and today's session is really about and/or you can also think of that as reading text and writing text right and most of the projects that I've been demonstrating or that I will show or talk about do some combination of both maybe they read in a source material mash it up chop it up and generate something from it today though I really want to focus on the reading in of text the analysis of text so when I say today I mean what I'm doing right now but ultimately the set of tutorials that I'm going to make so if you I'm gonna give you a sort of summary of the topic I'm going to show you some relevant projects that might inspire you with ideas but if you want to just get to the coding part you can skip to the next video in this playlist you should be in the session five or a week five programming from A to Z playlist so the building block so text analysis by text analysis I mean reading in a text analyzing it and producing some result that could that result could be sentiment analysis it's a positive text as a negative text it could be ah this text is very similar in style to another text there are so many different kinds of ways you can about this is a difficult text and easy text you can imagine what kinds of outcome statistical analysis whatever you could do from reading and text with the computer program but the we need a building block and the building block for every single one of these text analysis examples of scenarios and that I will present and show you how to code is word counting actually we're counting is a totally simple thing and this is not a new thing so I'm gonna pop over to this Wikipedia page here on this idea of a concordance so it concordance concordance concordance a concordance is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a book or body of work listing of each word with its immediate context blah blah blah blah blah what that means is a concordance is hey I want to know all the words that were in this text and I want to know how many times they appeared and where they appeared so I'm gonna do something simpler when I build an actual code example which is just here's a list of all the words in a text and how many times those words appeared and this is not something that's just sort of a computing thing this has been done you know this has been done by hand many years with you know you know well you know this used to be done by hand and so there's some information here about biblical concordance is you know reading the text manually making this big list making references you know an index in a way it's very similar to a concordance in many ways as well it's a sort of list of topics and where they appear in a particular book so I encourage you but you can see that here again this list I think is useful I am this is hello this is Daniel Shipman reading you a Wikipedia page on the internet but this is kind of useful context and it has some nice it's kind of or it some nice reference material for you to like kind of expand further into this territory but you can see this idea of analyzing one thing you can do with the concordance is is try to figure out are there key words associated with a piece of text one of the examples I'll show you is a term frequency inverse document frequency algorithm that pulls out key words from a text and all sorts of other things that you can do with a concordance algorithm so let me show you some examples so first of all here's a great example this is by rune Matson and they'll be in this video's description they'll be links to all these projects this is called speech comparison it's a project created in processing and this is a kind of what you might typically see as a kind of example project idea with a text concordance this is visualizing a bunch of speeches by these particular speakers and counting all the counting words and you can see here a list of words that appear in the text and then drawing a colorcoded visualization of the frequency of that term you can see here climate mmm climate is used a lot by this purple person I like to think of myself as a purple person I don't know what color you think of yourself I think was almost purple and you can see that person is Al Gore you know wellknown and famous for his work in climate I was gonna say climate science but I don't that's accurate you know promotion or getting the message out there about the issue of climate change and so this is something you might think about doing how could you creatively visualize the words that appear in a given text let me go show you another project by Sarah Groff Palermo this project is called BookBook and I encourage you to take a look more deeply at this project but I'm going to click here this is a comparison of the jungle by Sinclair versus the jungle book by Kipling and I'm gonna click on this and what you're seeing here is what are the words that are unique to one text but not in another text so this is something you could also really do with word counting and look at a comparison of two texts by the way this is how spam filtering works let's look at all of my emails which are not spam and count all the word frequencies in those and let's look at all of my emails that are spam and count all the frequencies in those and then build a statistical probability that a new email fits into one of those categories and you can see it's not just about what is what kind of words are in a spam email it's all about the relationship of spam to regular emails and you can get one one way to think about this by the way is you know I get a lot of spam emails that are trying to sell me like a mortgage so mortgage is a word frequency that appears very in a lot of my spam emails but let's say and so that's a good indicator but if I were a mortgage broker I probably get a lot of actual mortgage emails so that word wouldn't be as relevant to me so just detecting it just word frequency in one document but how it compares to others is kind of a key way to do text analysis and we'll see some examples of that you can also look Sara's project also has the ability for you to look at the words that appear in both texts I believe if I click over to see that both of them together what another wonderful work in data visualization another artist I love is Stephanie possa Beck and Stephanie has a lot of work with I said a lot of work with handdrawn data visualization she has a beautiful project with Georgia noopy called dear data which they sent these data visualization handdrawn postcards to each other look that up find it and put a link in this video's description but she worked on a album cover for okay album artwork for okay go and doing visualization of word frequencies in their song lyrics you can see how some of these came out what that what kind of visual quality they have and you can also sort of see like what's going on here there's some diagrams showing exactly you know parts of speech concordance common words that are both common to both text counting sort of like what texts have different syllables in and so sentence length so there's a lot of ways you can use that sort of just raw numbers of a text to glean something from it and to sort of play around with different visual ideas so this site these are ideas that I encourage you to think about what's a text that really interest you where can you get text by the way let me mention here also if you're thinking about places you might look for texts examples and I think I just have two links on this page here and you know send me or your links and I'll add them to this page but Project Gutenberg is certainly one that you might explore Project Gutenberg is an online repository of texts that are in the public domain so there's Jane Austen's work is there all of William Shakespeare's plays are there you'll find lots of other thing I have one I have an ode example that does a text concordance for Pride and Prejudice so this is something that you might consider looking at you can get the text

this topic what is an associative array and how can you implement one in JavaScript and I might mention a bit about how you can do it in processing in Java as well and then I'm gonna build a word counting application simple word counting application it won't do an interesting visualization but you could take it and visualize it in your own way I mentioned to you that you could do the same thing but with counting parts of speech and then I want to look at keyword extraction using algorithm called tfidf or term frequency inverse document frequency where I read it where you'll read in multiple texts and look at words that are unique to one text but not in the others and that's a way of knowing well the appears in a lot of text but not necessarily the so that it's not a keyword even though it appears very frequently but in the rainbow Wikipedia article rainbow appears a lot but it doesn't appear in a lot of other Wikipedia articles so this idea of inverse it's in its frequent in this document but not frequent in other documents I'm gonna look at that algorithm and I don't think I'm gonna be doing this today but at some point in this playlist hopefully it will also appear a set of lessons about doing text classification is it spam or not spam using Bayesian probability so this is a complex topic it's I'm gonna have to just spend another full day on that probably and I want to also mention how you might do this stuff in processing in Java and also maybe serverside programming with node so that's kind of the summary of the things and then I'll come back at the end and I'll talk you through some exercise ideas ah and this reminds me so I want to I want to talk about something of this video you could could very well be over but it's not because I want to talk to you about one of my favorite books that I've read called the secret life of pronouns by James W Pennebaker I encourage you to read this book I will link in this video's description to Pennebaker TED talk which gives kind of a 20minute summary of the topic but here's the thing I mentioned before sentiment analysis so let's think about that sense of analysis I want to know is this text positive or negative well I might look for content based words what kind of there is the word happy joyful are those frequent or is the word sad or depressed are those frequently used so this idea I've always thought at least that text analysis is associated with word frequencies analyzing word counts but looking at the sort of big words the content words the descriptive words James Pennebaker who's a psychologist who's done a lot of work with analyzing the ways that writing can help people get through trauma discovered something I you know from what I understand in his research somewhat accidentally because he started out also looking for these content words but what he discovered is you know and in text and Alvin we're counting what you're often doing is saying like oh I'm always getting za and she and she and I and me and my they I should just make a list of stop words or junk words to ignore and that's kind of a common technique but what he discovered was that these words actually unlock oh the key in many ways to analyzing the emotional state of an author and lots of other properties of an author is an author or a speaker lying or telling the truth the use of the personal pronoun IV or my the frequency of that reveals a lot about a person's status in relationship to another person status so I encourage you to think about that and one of the exercises for this week could be to implement a sort of interactive system based on some of Pennebaker czar research so you could read the book and i'll point you to some resources where you can kind of get some more information about his research as well and and just to plug it a little bit more I'll mention something that I would encourage you to do secret life of pronouns when we go to the website is click on the exercises at the top and you can I would encourage you to try some of these don't click on them to look at them and think you're gonna try them later because you want to come to them fresh they're gonna ask you to write for 5 or 10 minutes and then it's gonna analyze your text for you but I encourage you to try these little I think you'll learn a lot about text analysis and about yourself and sort of thinking about project ideas or this space okay so I'm gonna get started actually looking at code and talking about the technical stuff now and in the next video I'm going to talk about associative arrays in JavaScript okay look forward to seeing you there hopefully maybe you
