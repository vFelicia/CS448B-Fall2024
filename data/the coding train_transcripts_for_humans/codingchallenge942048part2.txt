00:00 - [Applause]
00:01 - welcome back I'm here trying to this is
00:04 - like the most painful thing in my entire
00:06 - life and I can't believe that you're
00:08 - watching this but you are I'm trying to
00:10 - make the game 2048 and I have gotten so
00:13 - far as to make the game work but only in
00:16 - what's the One Direction song somebody
00:18 - tell me only in one direction which is
00:21 - down so if I hit the spacebar everything
00:23 - will move down now it would be really
00:24 - nice for you to be able to see an
00:26 - animation to have a sense that what it's
00:31 - really doing and we haven't seen
00:32 - anything combined yet let's come on get
00:34 - something to combine there we go but you
00:36 - can see that everything's coming down
00:37 - and the numbers are combining when
00:39 - they're equal this is exactly like how
00:40 - the game 2048 plays of course this is
00:43 - much nicer to have a nice animation and
00:45 - different colors and all that sort of
00:46 - stuff but what I need to do is I need to
00:49 - be able to go in any direction so let's
00:50 - at least double check here and keep rest
00:52 - that I can say I think if key equals up
00:57 - arrow let's let me look in I can't remem
01:04 - what the constants are and p5 up arrow
01:07 - is something yeah
01:10 - it's 38 so and what if I say console dot
01:15 - log key ah so I think I probably want
01:23 - the key code because the key it's giving
01:26 - me it's not giving me the number I think
01:28 - I want I think I want this yeah so key
01:32 - code is what I want I want key code
01:34 - equal to up arrow and I can use a switch
01:37 - statement
01:38 - I'm not going to down arrow so down is
01:45 - what it's doing already let's just try
01:46 - to get up and down so if key code equals
01:51 - down arrow do nothing to nothing
01:56 - if key code equals up arrow what I need
02:02 - to do is just flip everything right so I
02:06 - can go through and I can say flip grid
02:09 - equals flip grid
02:13 - right I just want to flip the grid so I
02:16 - can write a function called flip for any
02:20 - two-dimensional array and I'm gonna go
02:22 - through all four rows and I'm just going
02:27 - to say grid index I if I say dot reverse
02:32 - on an array does it return in a new
02:35 - array let a equal one two three four one
02:40 - two three four a dot reverse so it
02:46 - actually reverses the array so it
02:48 - operates on that same array so I could
02:51 - say grid index I reverse I can say let
03:01 - flipped equal false flipped equals true
03:06 - so I want to flip it then I want to I'm
03:17 - just gonna let I'm gonna sue Mike only
03:19 - going to press the arrow keys and then
03:23 - I'm going to flip it again so and I do I
03:33 - wonder which I don't need to return it I
03:35 - just need to flip it so I don't need to
03:37 - so I'm gonna flip the grid and then if
03:41 - it was flipped flip it back so this
03:46 - should be now this is just like for up
03:48 - and down this should work for up and
03:50 - down let's see if this works
03:52 - little little crazy thing I've done here
03:55 - down whoops down okay down let's go up
04:00 - up down up down down up down down up
04:11 - down up this is totally working down up
04:16 - down up down and eventually the games
04:19 - going to be over because I don't have
04:21 - any more moves left okay so that works
04:23 - poof so now I need else
04:27 - if keycode equals right arrow now I need
04:33 - to rotate the grid grid equals rotate
04:38 - the grid so I need to rotate it let's
04:42 - rotate the grid I think I want a new
04:45 - array I think I want a new so I'm by the
04:49 - way I want a function this is very silly
04:52 - I want to have a function and put it all
04:53 - the way at the top called blank grid and
04:57 - what that does is it just returns this
05:00 - because I need to do this quite a bit
05:03 - just give me a blank one so now I can
05:05 - say grid equals blank grid yeah I love
05:09 - that and then somewhere else where I did
05:11 - the crazy copy thing extra equals blank
05:14 - grid so that's gonna be much nicer
05:16 - because what I want to do when I rotate
05:18 - it and I definitely I need to call it
05:21 - rotate grid and I should probably be
05:23 - consistent here it's a flip grid with my
05:28 - naming flipgrid flip grid and I
05:31 - definitely should break this up into
05:32 - different files and maybe organize my
05:34 - code boy I got a refactor this stuff
05:36 - flipgrid change this to flip grid now
05:39 - I'm going to write one called
05:42 - rotate grid now this shouldn't be too
05:47 - hard I should just do a nice little
05:50 - nested loop and I should get I should
05:56 - create I should create a new grid is a
06:00 - blank grid and then in the new grids I J
06:07 - I take the old grids J I and now so what
06:20 - this would do is now I want to rotate
06:23 - the grid and then I'm going to have to
06:27 - unrotated again I've just rotated a few
06:32 - more times so right so let's think so so
06:36 - I'm gonna have a variable called let
06:38 - rotate equal false
06:41 - rotated so this is rotated equals true
06:45 - then what I'm gonna do if rotated then
06:51 - what should I do
06:52 - I just want to rotate it through a few
06:56 - more times right rotate it once twice
06:59 - one two three only three more times I'll
07:01 - get back right
07:04 - that's brilliant coding right there all
07:07 - right let's give this a try up down up
07:10 - down those work what did I express eight
07:12 - right arrow okay got an error cannot set
07:15 - property undefined at rotate grid sketch
07:18 - j/s line 71 rotate grid new grid is a
07:24 - blank grid i J equals grid J oh look at
07:29 - this
07:29 - that's really bad that's really bad J
07:33 - okay let's try this again down up down
07:39 - up right okay got another error cannot
07:43 - read property undefined a copy grid
07:46 - sketch digest line 53 aah roar it is
07:50 - messing something off rotate grid does
07:53 - not return the new grid there we go
07:56 - return the new grid rotate grid thank
07:59 - you very much ha this is totally working
08:10 - up down up right now I can't go to the
08:14 - left so now I need this is gonna be this
08:17 - is no problem that watch this this is
08:20 - total insanity but else if key code
08:25 - equals left arrow now grid equals rotate
08:33 - grid grid I want to rotate it and then
08:39 - flip flip grid grid equals flip grid
08:47 - grid and you know what I should just
08:49 - always return I should always return a
08:53 - reference
08:54 - like even though like because it's just
08:56 - too confusing you keep track of which
08:58 - functions do which so I'm gonna go back
09:00 - to my flip crit function scrolls girls
09:06 - girl and just say return grid so now if
09:12 - I'm going to the left I could rotate it
09:14 - then flip it then and grid equals flip
09:20 - and so here not only is it rotated but
09:25 - it's also flipped so then I can flip it
09:29 - back and rotate it three times and I
09:31 - should be good now here's the thing I
09:33 - should only be doing this if I press one
09:36 - of these keys so I'm gonna make a
09:39 - variable called played equals false and
09:46 - I'm gonna say played equals true and
09:50 - again this can really be refactored
09:53 - really I should do with part three of
09:56 - this to refactor this probably but all
09:58 - of all four of these keys I'm playing
10:02 - and so now if I have played then I can
10:08 - do all this crazy nonsense if it's
10:10 - changed at a number otherwise console
10:14 - dot log game well it's not game over
10:17 - because I could it's only if I have no
10:19 - moves left so oh I'll get to that a
10:22 - little bit okay let's see what's the
10:25 - chance oh yeah I could use else played
10:30 - is true right I can assume that I've
10:34 - played but in all other kids I can at
10:39 - least make this a little better in all
10:42 - other cases right if it's some other key
10:44 - played is false so I'm going to assume
10:47 - that I've played and now let's see get
10:54 - down
10:55 - whoops down okay down down is combining
11:00 - to the right to the right to the right
11:03 - to the left to the left up to the right
11:07 - to
11:08 - right to the left down to the right down
11:11 - whoops
11:12 - I don't know what I just did to the
11:13 - right eye I'm pretty sure this is
11:17 - actually working it actually is doing
11:20 - what it's supposed to do and hooray
11:26 - great okay so this is the functionality
11:29 - of the game there's gonna be a part
11:30 - three this is three three parts part
11:33 - three
11:34 - I'll add the score and determine if
11:37 - there's no moves left okay so that's
11:39 - what I need to do and I think that what
11:42 - I can do is maybe I'll if bar three I
11:45 - might refactor a few things I'm getting
11:46 - some good suggestions from the chat okay
11:48 - all right thanks for watching this so
11:50 - far wow I think I might have made 2048
11:52 - by accident somehow
11:58 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back I'm here trying to this is like the most painful thing in my entire life and I can't believe that you're watching this but you are I'm trying to make the game 2048 and I have gotten so far as to make the game work but only in what's the One Direction song somebody tell me only in one direction which is down so if I hit the spacebar everything will move down now it would be really nice for you to be able to see an animation to have a sense that what it's really doing and we haven't seen anything combined yet let's come on get something to combine there we go but you can see that everything's coming down and the numbers are combining when they're equal this is exactly like how the game 2048 plays of course this is much nicer to have a nice animation and different colors and all that sort of stuff but what I need to do is I need to be able to go in any direction so let's at least double check here and keep rest that I can say I think if key equals up arrow let's let
