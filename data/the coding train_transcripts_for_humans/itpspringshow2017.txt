01:31 - Jared Freedman we like right this is
01:35 - geode number one 1/2
01:37 - it's a giant inside a disco ball that
01:40 - you can go inside and play around with
01:42 - the lights how long did it take to build
01:44 - this whole thing ah too long it was a
01:49 - couple months from starting the designs
01:51 - to having the finished thing but if you
01:53 - reach out towards the light they did
01:56 - more brighten but you have to get sort
01:57 - of close to phenomenal interaction is
02:00 - just to be my name is Tears David and I
02:05 - made night life which is a series of 3d
02:09 - sculptures inspired by low light
02:11 - photography which means that basically I
02:14 - was really missing that moment when you
02:16 - hold a photo we're not doing it anymore
02:19 - so I wanted to create a physical object
02:22 - that will represent this moment that we
02:24 - have when you have light falls on our
02:27 - bodies and we capture that in a photo
02:29 - but it's a 3d photo and I have three
02:34 - things one of them is a girl standing in
02:37 - front of a bar and delight in this scene
02:39 - is from an Al wire that I had to saw
02:42 - inside the sign the other one I shot my
02:45 - roommate and our fridge and you can
02:49 - actually turn it on and off it's a
02:52 - simple
02:54 - circuit and we have a kid that I found
03:01 - at a thief basement and they were
03:06 - playing Super Mario so they have a tiny
03:10 - television that also shows Super Mario
03:13 - and you can see it here hi I'm Danielle
03:16 - Butler and I made safe house which is an
03:20 - immersive physical environment and part
03:23 - of it is that you're meant to be
03:24 - surprised by what you find inside and so
03:26 - when you duck in then you can in turn
03:30 - interact with what you find inside and
03:33 - discover more about the base of the
03:35 - story how many people would you say came
03:38 - and went inside yesterday that's a
03:40 - really good question a lot and what I
03:42 - loved is how many people would go in at
03:44 - one time so what's what's the most
03:46 - that's been in there once I think five
03:48 - and it was great because I built it as
03:50 - an immersive installation for one and so
03:53 - it's really fun to see five pairs of
03:55 - legs sticking at the bus my name is
03:57 - Franklin and this is my thesis project
03:59 - colored sugar ritual the last forever
04:02 - and it's a kinetic sculpture of the
04:04 - traditional dragon dance performance to
04:07 - trying to bring back
04:11 - something that is the transmitting
04:14 - through my culture DNA in a modern form
04:17 - to that yeah it can be remember again
04:21 - and what scale do you think you could
04:24 - actually make this that because it'll be
04:25 - amazing if it were above you definitely
04:27 - I oh it would be great if we can fill
04:29 - the entire room you know my name is
04:32 - Lindsay Daniels and my project is called
04:34 - rude commute I started recording a lot
04:38 - of videos of my train commute because my
04:40 - train is above ground so you get lots of
04:42 - nice videos of like skyline but then my
04:45 - way of putting it back underground was
04:48 - to project it underneath my plants and
04:50 - then kind of thinking about how what you
04:52 - do above ground affects what goes on
04:54 - underneath all of these plants have
04:56 - sensors in them so when you touch them
04:58 - you will slow down the commute or you
05:03 - can stop it entirely and the only way to
05:07 - bring it back is if you leave them alone
05:09 - and then it will eventually there we go
05:12 - trail all turned back on
05:14 - [Music]
05:22 - [Music]
05:30 - [Music]
05:43 - my name is Michelle and my project is
05:46 - called hidden in plain sight it is an
05:47 - installation that shares the stories of
05:49 - New York Street vendors through
05:51 - interactive 3d printed sculptures so
05:54 - this is a series of three portraits this
05:57 - is Danny
05:57 - this is c2 also known as the Joe Simon
06:00 - from Washington Square Park Montana
06:04 - she's an Ecuadorian woman truck from
06:06 - hotels her family's in Queens and the
06:10 - idea of the project is to share all the
06:13 - stories behind the street food of New
06:16 - York that we don't usually get to know
06:18 - and understand if we these are people
06:21 - who are part of our daily life but at
06:22 - the same time who we don't know much
06:24 - about and it's a commune of immigrants
06:27 - of people who come from all over the
06:29 - world and I believe that one of the
06:33 - reasons that street food in New York is
06:35 - so great is because it's so diverse and
06:37 - it's made by people who come from all
06:39 - over the place
06:43 - okay hi I'm Matt Serra my project is
06:46 - called cat in a box because there's many
06:48 - cats in this box and it's an educational
06:51 - book box for kids to learn about simple
06:53 - circuits and we would start off with the
06:56 - saudi of why we need a house cat
06:58 - it was calcified the animal and drake
07:00 - for the lights and so after that we go
07:03 - into like plug the lights and the
07:05 - buttons inside and we fix the sockets
07:09 - and you can lick to see what you're
07:11 - actually doing and then we basically
07:14 - continue doing this for the rest of the
07:15 - house which somebody already did it's a
07:19 - indian form of art called Kivar it's
07:22 - from Rajasthan which which is why this
07:25 - is some and what it is it's like this
07:29 - pop-up it's a pop-up meets Museum sort
07:32 - of book storytelling method and it's
07:34 - beautiful so this whole the physical
07:37 - format of this is inspired by that my
07:40 - name is Paula fellows and this is a
07:43 - project called vine pixels and it's a
07:45 - series of experiments that takes ancient
07:48 - fortune-telling rituals and makes them
07:50 - contemporary by infusing different
07:52 - aspects of our digital culture into them
07:54 - so this is a reddit tarot card that
07:59 - we're gonna be reading you made you made
08:02 - this I made I made yeah so this is just
08:05 - for today hope today is energy okay
08:08 - you got quarters what so basically
08:13 - you're going to have a great day filled
08:16 - with love and excitement and lots of
08:19 - fluffy puppy kisses
08:23 - [Music]
08:43 - [Music]
08:48 - Oh
08:50 - I'm Erin so this is my project called
08:53 - Anki light basically it's made out of I
08:56 - try to use materials from the trash so a
08:59 - lot of the bags say thank you in New
09:01 - York so I called it thank you light it's
09:03 - powered off of a luna mum take out ten
09:06 - and charcoal from a campfire and salt
09:12 - water so yeah this is one of the
09:14 - batteries and basically there's a few
09:17 - cells in here that are sandwiches of
09:18 - those ingredients and then I'm using
09:20 - plastic bags to insulate them from each
09:23 - other and then there's a high powered
09:24 - LED that is powering you can it'll last
09:28 - about 10 hours with this light and then
09:30 - I'm using just a phone charger to
09:32 - recharge it recharge your charcoal salt
09:36 - water that battery yeah so every 10
09:38 - minutes or sorry every 10 hours if you
09:41 - plug in every 10 minutes it will
09:42 - recharge it
09:43 - the mmm using a just regular plastic bag
09:46 - that I've ironed together with a closing
09:49 - cilia so that's kind of a fun process
09:53 - one other cool thing about speed bags
09:55 - they're made out of high density
09:56 - polyethylene you can actually just take
09:58 - the laser cut this is three bags so it
10:01 - kind of makes a stronger material and
10:03 - then you can you can send them through
10:04 - the laser cutter without any fumes or
10:07 - anything all right
10:08 - this project is seen on framers and then
10:11 - we are using the physical paintings
10:13 - that's like going immersive to the
10:16 - entertaining and quick demo you just
10:19 - pick whatever the painting in life here
10:21 - and
10:22 - and also putting it up here underneath
10:24 - via the camera webcam so like this and
10:29 - they fill in the text and then show what
10:31 - you know the paintings onto this is the
10:35 - canvas so everything has a different
10:37 - particle system so it's going to create
10:39 - something very interesting you know
10:41 - paintings on top of this Center
10:44 - my name is Gina and I'm actually part of
10:48 - this project and I wanted to create some
10:51 - kind of an interactive painting because
10:53 - my background in fine art so I want to
10:55 - like interact with other users and I
10:57 - want to see them what they are creating
11:00 - by using my pieces
11:03 - [Music]
11:23 - [Music]
11:32 - hi my name is Regina my name is min and
11:37 - this was a collaboration for two classes
11:40 - it's tangible interactions in live image
11:42 - processing I've got the blob here's the
11:46 - blob and now what I'm going to do is
11:47 - squeeze the blood so I'm Eric when she
11:55 - Lee I'm doing a project about like a
11:58 - collar and pop-up windows so there are
12:01 - 190 pop-up windows which we are
12:04 - assembling the collar from the cat
12:05 - webcam and also it's running a very
12:07 - basic level of machine learning so like
12:10 - this I have some business called mind
12:12 - has different color if I put on the
12:15 - front of the webcam we will start
12:18 - assembling the color because it's
12:22 - running algorithm so it's only something
12:25 - the color have the most frequently in
12:27 - front of the camera
12:30 - [Music]
12:33 - you
12:34 - [Music]
12:43 - you
12:49 - [Music]
12:57 - my name is Julie hi so this is the wave
13:01 - washed and which I made out of like an
13:03 - Asian Chinese porn so this whole
13:07 - resonated with me a lot because it's
13:09 - like kind of like expresso with excel
13:11 - filling because the power was in prison
13:13 - and they were he was in the excel when
13:16 - he wrote his poem that's why the center
13:18 - balloon is kind of like in page and then
13:20 - for me as a traveling students kind of
13:23 - be resonating with him so on a base my
13:25 - thesis projects honest so from there I
13:29 - kind of like try to find who is the best
13:31 - performer to perform this cone and then
13:35 - I decide to use balloons and then after
13:37 - that I kind of like put all this
13:39 - mechanism together to paragraph it's
13:42 - performance or this show going through
13:43 - different lines and then with fluent
13:45 - movement to express the food
13:48 - [Music]
13:50 - [Applause]
13:51 - [Music]
14:10 - [Music]
14:21 - hello I'm Haley
14:23 - hi mes oh and our project is mirage'
14:27 - slide experiment
14:29 - and it's an interactive light
14:30 - installation using EMS based lighting
14:33 - and people can interact with the white
14:37 - so we use tonight to track people
14:40 - skeletons and we process data from
14:43 - processing and so we control the DMX
14:47 - light color and the location and the
14:51 - size and we are using DMX light because
14:54 - instead of slide like presentation like
14:58 - projectors because we try with
15:00 - projectors but they give away a phase
15:02 - and not very clear image like compared
15:05 - to DMX and we really like the quality of
15:07 - the light very crisp and like price
15:10 - [Music]
