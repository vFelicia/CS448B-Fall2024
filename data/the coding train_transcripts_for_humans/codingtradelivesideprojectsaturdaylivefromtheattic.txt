03:30 - my watch band matches my hat and that's
03:32 - what i have to say to you today
03:33 - on this side project saturday on the
03:36 - coding train i hope everyone's doing
03:38 - well
03:38 - we reach over here and grab this
03:43 - [Applause]
03:45 - well i'm awake it is a saturday it is a

03:49 - and i'm here in the attic in brooklyn
03:52 - new york
03:52 - to talk to you the people the passengers
03:55 - of the train about
03:57 - code and other types of things and
03:59 - update on the
04:00 - the what's the news today in creative
04:02 - coding is there any perhaps any
04:07 - wait a second this just in
04:11 - um the coding train news desk where are
04:14 - my papers to russell
04:15 - uh i got nothing um i do have some new
04:17 - videos coming out soon on the coding
04:19 - train
04:19 - i said this one last week a video on
04:22 - object detection
04:23 - using the ml5.js library that will be
04:25 - coming out as well
04:27 - as three new
04:30 - uh videos uh tutorials about how to make
04:32 - your own discord bot i just want to
04:34 - make a little plug here as i begin uh
04:37 - about the coding train discord first of
04:40 - all
04:40 - while i'm here let me also thank the
04:42 - sponsor of today's coding train
04:43 - brilliant
04:44 - uh brilliant is a interactive website
04:47 - for learning
04:48 - and boy do they have a lot of stuff
04:50 - there that's good for ideas for creative
04:51 - coding and a lot of
04:52 - related content to the coding train so
04:54 - check out um brilliant
04:56 - uh the website brilliant.org um sign up
04:58 - for an account for free
05:00 - at brilliant.org codingtrain and
05:03 - if you want to unlock all the premium
05:05 - content all the courses everything
05:06 - there's a lot you can do for free but
05:07 - all the premium stuff um
05:09 - if you use that you'll get a 20 off uh
05:12 - coupon on a premium subscription
05:14 - for at least the first 200 people who
05:15 - sign up all right
05:18 - what i wanted to mention about the
05:19 - discord
05:21 - um is that i am running a bot the choo
05:24 - choo bot
05:25 - and if i type in the words
05:28 - choo choo right here
05:31 - it's going to reply to me ding
05:36 - oops we could try another one
05:40 - oh and it gave me some nice emojis so um
05:42 - that's coming soon i'm um
05:44 - hoping to launch a brand new series a
05:46 - sequence set of tutorials about how to
05:47 - make your own discord bot
05:49 - um in the coding train discord server
05:51 - itself
05:52 - um there is the disk stream bot which
05:55 - i encourage you to check out maybe
05:57 - somebody who's watching can put the
05:58 - website for disstream chat which is a
06:01 - chat manager tool for live streaming
06:03 - that's some coding trained viewers
06:06 - have put together and you can support
06:07 - their patreon i'm planning some possible
06:09 - ideas to use that in a future live
06:11 - stream
06:12 - so i will come back to that but i do
06:15 - want to plug the discord
06:16 - because i am really trying to build the
06:18 - discord community um i find it just to
06:20 - be such a
06:22 - uh a great place for getting help on
06:25 - your code discussion around code for me
06:27 - to engage
06:28 - with the community oh oh mini jimmy
06:32 - in a second i'm in the wrong place
06:36 - mini jimmy welcome to being a passenger
06:40 - on the coding train
06:41 - today is october 10th that's 10 10
06:45 - 20 20 an auspicious day with a bunch of
06:48 - numbers in it that all
06:49 - add up and relate to each other and work
06:52 - very well with our decimal system but
06:54 - you
06:54 - as a member of the coding train now new
06:56 - member have won your very own
06:58 - random number and it is
07:02 - wait someone's keeping track of this
07:03 - right is there by the way um hiring
07:05 - new position available for the coding
07:07 - train random number keeper
07:09 - kind of like gamekeeper or um other
07:11 - sorts of various keeper like positions
07:15 - uh 73 935
07:18 - mini jimmy minnie jimmy i recognize your
07:21 - name oh my goodness
07:24 - welcome ah darsh bhutan
07:29 - you are a brand new member of the cody
07:31 - train which means that
07:32 - at some point in the future you might
07:34 - receive in the mail
07:36 - some stickers yes that's right stickers
07:40 - there are pieces of paper that are
07:41 - sticky on the back and you will put them
07:43 - onto something
07:45 - like maybe your laptop or your new
07:48 - poster with your own random number on it
07:52 - which is
07:56 - 37 hundred and thirty one
07:59 - and also i should mention you know
08:01 - there's a lot of stuff for everybody on
08:03 - the discord i don't i don't really love
08:05 - the idea of exclusive spaces
08:07 - but um in the discord um there are some
08:10 - uh channels for um coding trained
08:12 - members where we have a few extra things
08:14 - and um i do often uh live stream for
08:17 - members when i'm recording a
08:18 - tutorial uh as well so if you want to
08:21 - tune in to some of the behind the scenes
08:22 - coding stream stuff
08:24 - uh you can join as a member
08:27 - um but one of the things that i've been
08:30 - wanting to get is discord partnership
08:32 - status
08:34 - um i don't know why i want that i just
08:36 - want it because it's a thing you can
08:37 - have and i don't have it
08:39 - uh but i've applied a bunch of times and
08:41 - most recently i looked and one of the
08:43 - thresholds i don't meet
08:44 - uh the coding train discord does not
08:46 - meet is first
08:47 - week member retention so i don't know if
08:50 - that means just
08:51 - like somebody signs up i don't think
08:53 - it's how many people keep their account
08:55 - after they signed up it must be
08:56 - how many people return back to the
08:58 - discord the coding trained discord and
09:00 - you have to be above 20
09:01 - and currently the last week my number
09:03 - was around 16
09:04 - so if there's any new folks here i'm
09:07 - going to press my discord button
09:09 - which will put a link to the invite to
09:12 - the discord in the chat
09:14 - um please join and
09:17 - uh then stay for a week then you can go
09:20 - then you could go then you could go
09:21 - but a week come back every day for a
09:23 - week decide if you like it
09:25 - and then you can go lots of fun stuff
09:27 - happening in the discord it's a great
09:28 - place to share your work
09:29 - um chat with fellow community members i
09:32 - would like to mention what's very
09:34 - important a little bit confusing is if
09:35 - and when
09:36 - you join there is the readme channel
09:39 - which has the code of conduct and lots
09:41 - of extra information about the different
09:42 - roles and
09:43 - rules and how things work and then you
09:46 - will not have access to the coding train
09:49 - uh discord server uh all the rest of the
09:51 - channels until you react with an emoji
09:53 - i'm like pointing as if
09:55 - i have much more space to point but i
09:57 - only can point to here unless you react
09:59 - with an emoji to the code of contact
10:01 - itself
10:01 - to indicate that you've read it don't
10:02 - just react read it
10:06 - okay there we go
10:09 - here we are oh it's so nice to be with
10:11 - you all what am i gonna do today
10:12 - well one of the things i like to begin
10:14 - with is
10:19 - community contributions yes
10:22 - right here on the coding train you as a
10:25 - watcher of the coding train
10:26 - can make your own creative code projects
10:29 - and share them
10:30 - with the community
10:33 - and sometimes i'll spin a wheel to pick
10:36 - your project
10:37 - and feature it right here on saturday's
10:39 - live stream
10:41 - so um boy this is
10:44 - really loud in my ear i don't know how
10:46 - loud it is for all of you
10:48 - uh so let's see let me find the wheel
10:53 - i'm gonna go over here to uh issues
10:56 - this is how i find the wheel we all know
10:58 - i can't possibly use something like
11:00 - a bookmark or a napkin or some way i've
11:03 - just gotta find
11:04 - the issue that's open here
11:08 - that says is it not in the topics oh
11:11 - it's in the website repo
11:12 - oh my god here we go going to the
11:16 - website repo oh i should talk about
11:18 - hacktoberfest
11:19 - oh so by the way um
11:23 - if hacktoberfest is something that
11:25 - you're interested in participating
11:27 - please read this issue here we are
11:30 - a github repo that is participating in
11:32 - oktoberfest because of a lot of the
11:34 - spam problems with hacktoberfest um you
11:36 - now as a
11:37 - an open source project have to opt into
11:39 - it and i really like to participate in
11:41 - these things that welcome new people
11:42 - into open source
11:43 - even though it caught there's a bit of
11:45 - uh extra layers of work involved in sort
11:48 - of managing what
11:49 - what is spam um um i think it's worth it
11:52 - um and so what is hacktoberfest you're
11:54 - asking i it's i think it's put on by
11:56 - digitalocean not a sponsor but hey i'm
11:58 - here digitalocean
11:59 - i used you i have some droplets
12:03 - i run my bots on your droplets how many
12:05 - people can say that to you
12:07 - with love um so uh
12:10 - and i believe if you uh i don't don't
12:13 - quote me on this i'm not an official
12:14 - representative
12:15 - but i believe if you get four poll
12:17 - requests accepted into open source
12:19 - projects that
12:20 - are participating they will send you a
12:21 - t-shirt or plant a tree um
12:24 - and it's a nice thing to participate in
12:25 - but i would really encourage you to
12:27 - read this um github issue uh thank you
12:30 - to violet craze who uh put this together
12:32 - and other contributors
12:34 - who added it who um um
12:38 - and you can see here here are all the
12:40 - here are a lot of the sort of like
12:42 - probably most of these are some of this
12:43 - sort of more spammy and they're not
12:44 - necessarily spam and then with malicious
12:46 - intent
12:47 - just people are trying we we can't
12:49 - accept your pull request really if it's
12:50 - just like
12:51 - changing one word or kind of messing up
12:53 - the site in some other way
12:54 - but the the best thing for you to do is
12:56 - make a community contribution
12:58 - and if i go over here to contribute and
13:00 - go to this community contribution guide
13:01 - you can find out more so
13:02 - let's get to that wheel
13:07 - um if i could just find it oh right
13:09 - issues
13:11 - uh we'll link there it is thank you to
13:14 - gypsy dangerous for putting together
13:16 - this
13:16 - wheel and i am now going to
13:20 - [Music]
13:22 - spin that wheel all right what are we
13:25 - going to see today everybody
13:31 - number ooh 13 13 whoo spooky
13:35 - by the way this might be the first year
13:37 - that i actually do a halloween special
13:38 - because halloween is on a saturday
13:40 - october 31st i'm just gonna be at home
13:43 - because hey we're all staying at home
13:44 - these days
13:46 - my costume will be a masked person
13:49 - i don't know maybe i'll have something
13:50 - else um oh we'll do something fun for
13:52 - halloween maybe remind me about that
13:53 - manta gets closer
13:54 - uh 13 let's see remove and view selected
13:56 - ah we have selected
13:58 - koji version oh this is going to be fun
14:01 - so this is based on it
14:03 - would seem the um angry birds coding
14:06 - challenge where i use
14:07 - mater.js which is a physics library to
14:09 - create uh an
14:10 - uh sort of like simplified version of an
14:12 - angry birds game in p5.js
14:17 - um then i'm going to go here
14:22 - and click on it so i
14:25 - i don't i it seems like it's probably
14:28 - unlikely just through the law of
14:30 - probabilities
14:31 - that um dissolve dissolvement
14:35 - is not here in the chat but if you
14:36 - happen to believe please
14:38 - hit me with some siren emojis so i can
14:41 - see that you're here and
14:42 - um maybe ask you some questions about
14:44 - your project so let's go here angry
14:45 - birds oh
14:46 - okay fun angry birds with koji oh wait
14:50 - koji must be some kind of like
14:52 - other live library or
14:55 - create interactive posts so with koji i
14:58 - do not know what this is
15:00 - we build software that evolves hey wait
15:02 - a second
15:03 - i'm now having a memory i think i have
15:06 - some emails and i was supposed to have a
15:07 - call with the folks from
15:09 - koji um let's look at about
15:13 - um uh uh i i have a memory of having a
15:17 - bunch of emails about this and talking
15:19 - with them i'm trying to see if i can
15:20 - recognize a name
15:21 - who knows or maybe i'm just imagining it
15:24 - okay but anyway
15:25 - this was made with koji let's try
15:27 - playing it
15:28 - oh and i'm in the way here we go i think
15:30 - i can get all three
15:33 - i'm gonna try to get all three here we
15:38 - go
15:42 - do i get it back do i get another try i
15:44 - want another try
15:46 - please no
15:49 - i just have to refresh the page all
15:51 - right here we go
15:52 - i think maybe if i go for the bottom one
15:55 - the top two will fall over
15:57 - all right here we go
16:03 - i'm so bad at this okay regret all right
16:06 - i'm this is this time when you get it
16:08 - okay can't can't defeat me
16:12 - angry dot here we go
16:20 - yes sort of kind of
16:24 - [Music]
16:30 - all right that was awesome um great so
16:33 - this looks to me like it's pretty much
16:34 - identical to the actual coding challenge
16:36 - itself but ported into a different
16:38 - environment which i always love to see
16:40 - and that is in particular something
16:42 - quite great for the community
16:44 - um and if you want to learn more about
16:46 - this angry birds coding challenge and
16:47 - see
16:47 - other i i assume it will sort of come up
16:52 - uh here is the first link um so we can
16:54 - see there there are actually only
16:55 - two only two community contributions to
16:58 - the angry birds coding challenge that's
17:00 - kind of a surprise i would have thought
17:01 - that would be a
17:02 - more popular one oh you versus texas
17:05 - college football version okay i
17:07 - i have my sports fandom but it is not
17:10 - college football so i know nothing about
17:12 - this
17:13 - uh but i'm kind of curious to see so
17:15 - this is oh you
17:16 - and that must that's that like texas
17:18 - longhorns is that what they're called
17:20 - something like that
17:21 - all right this is great uh that's fun to
17:23 - see um you know the sort of theming it
17:25 - with uh
17:26 - some some a particular i can't seem to
17:29 - hit anything
17:30 - uh something you're passionate or
17:32 - excited about come on let me at least
17:34 - get a couple of these oh you you're not
17:36 - doing very well
17:37 - there we go awesome uh
17:40 - all right let's go back to our wheel see
17:43 - if we can get another one here everybody
17:51 - and swift potato in the chat is saying
17:55 - um
17:58 - i love to port these to vanilla
18:00 - javascript and that's great and that's
18:02 - that's particularly wonderful because
18:04 - one of the requests that i get most
18:06 - often in the comments is
18:07 - why do you use people i don't know why
18:09 - i'm imitating the voice of a youtube
18:11 - here's my voice of youtube commenter why
18:14 - don't you
18:14 - use p5js but really you're all wonderful
18:18 - nice people
18:19 - you're just asking friendly questions
18:20 - like why don't why do you oh wait no no
18:22 - that's not the
18:22 - end of the question it's uh i wish you
18:25 - would
18:25 - uh do your tutorials in vanilla
18:27 - javascript i wish you wouldn't use
18:28 - frameworks you know
18:29 - that's just i get it sometimes it feels
18:32 - um
18:33 - there's a reason for wanting to sort of
18:34 - learn from the sort of like
18:36 - base default api javascript
18:40 - browser api but i am a person who really
18:42 - likes to use frameworks and use them for
18:44 - particular reasons and p5.js i
18:46 - could go on and on about lots of reasons
18:48 - why i choose to use it but um it's
18:50 - wonderful when people from the community
18:51 - can
18:52 - can contribute a version that helps me
18:55 - help me and others see
18:56 - ah these are other ways to look at the
18:58 - same problem or we can learn more about
19:00 - how
19:00 - p5.js works by looking underneath the
19:02 - hood at vanilla or native javascript
19:04 - all right number 53 is
19:08 - um oh
19:11 - gram scan algorithm using a generator
19:14 - function oh this is going to make simon
19:16 - tiger simon tiger's gonna is watching is
19:19 - gonna be so happy simon has been asking
19:21 - me to do
19:22 - a video tutorial on generator functions
19:24 - and use generator function guess what
19:26 - i have something to admit to you i i
19:28 - kind of loosely maybe
19:30 - understand the concept of generator
19:32 - function but i
19:33 - i couldn't you you could like come up
19:35 - here and be like here's my suitcase full
19:36 - of a million dollars
19:37 - if you can read generator function right
19:39 - now it's yours i don't think i'd be
19:41 - getting that suitcase
19:42 - any time soon so it's something that i
19:44 - really should look into
19:46 - i have been wanting to do more just
19:48 - quick
19:50 - new features in javascript videos um and
19:52 - so maybe that's something that could go
19:54 - add to a side project saturday to kind
19:55 - of learn generator functions
19:57 - um but let's take a look at the original
19:59 - challenge uh which was the gift wrapping
20:01 - um challenge this was one day back of
20:04 - days days in more innocent times
20:06 - before i i mean maybe this is in 2020
20:08 - but if it was it was
20:10 - much earlier in 2020 when i thought i
20:12 - was going to make a lot of computational
20:14 - geometry coding challenges i would still
20:15 - like to do that
20:16 - um and i did a sort of like a first
20:19 - start with this gift wrapping challenge
20:21 - which is finding
20:22 - the uh convex hull or the contours
20:24 - around
20:25 - an enclosed set of dots um and
20:28 - let's take a look let's just see what
20:30 - the example looks like like what my
20:32 - example looks like i'm not logged in
20:33 - here we can see
20:34 - this is animating this particular
20:36 - algorithm that's finding
20:37 - it's called the gift wrapping algorithm
20:41 - and i should log in by the way let me
20:43 - just do that
20:44 - so that that is done
20:48 - and then let's go back here and see
20:51 - a gram scan algorithm
20:53 - [Music]
20:57 - cool so now i'm trying to remember i
20:59 - remember researching this and i
21:01 - um and and looking at gram scan
21:04 - and looking at gift wrapping and then
21:06 - there were some other particular
21:07 - algorithms i can't i don't recall
21:10 - um and i should let this finish sorry
21:13 - wonderful
21:14 - so first of all what one thing that i
21:16 - particularly i have an
21:17 - affinity for that i really love are uh
21:20 - projects that animate the process of an
21:22 - algorithm and this is actually quite
21:24 - hard to do
21:25 - right it's typically at least in my
21:28 - experience much
21:29 - easier to implement an algorithm and
21:31 - show the final result
21:32 - which is generally what you need you
21:35 - want to use an algorithm to achieve a
21:36 - particular result
21:37 - but for artistic purposes for
21:39 - educational purposes
21:41 - it's often worth sort of peeling back
21:43 - and
21:44 - and and peeling the layers of the onions
21:46 - so to speak and dividing them into
21:47 - different layers of the onion so that
21:49 - you can watch one layer of the onion at
21:50 - a time in an animation
21:52 - is this metaphor working probably not
21:55 - but
21:55 - um this is something that i really like
21:57 - to do to watch the process of an
21:59 - algorithm unfold
22:00 - for um all sorts of various reasons so i
22:02 - appreciate seeing that with this
22:04 - um example um and let me look up because
22:06 - i want to
22:07 - um remind myself about this algorithm
22:11 - so maybe somebody can tell me this is a
22:14 - method of finding a convex
22:16 - whole of a finite set of points we can
22:18 - see it animating right over here
22:20 - the time complexity is o and long n
22:24 - oh oh i feel like i should go get my
22:26 - ukulele because i feel like
22:28 - we should write a song about o n log n
22:30 - it just it
22:32 - just yells out to me like
22:35 - i'm i'm a song it's named after ronald
22:38 - graham who published the original
22:40 - algorithm in 1972 the year before i was
22:42 - born
22:43 - thank you very much yes yes i know
22:47 - i know i'm old although really it's all
22:51 - time is relative
22:55 - um and it uses a stack to detect
22:59 - and remove concavities in the boundary
23:01 - efficiency so this is different than
23:03 - what i did right gift wrapping
23:06 - algorithm what i did was the gift
23:09 - wrapping algorithm
23:10 - which was published in 1973
23:15 - all right tate jarvis r.a jarvis get
23:18 - with it
23:18 - graham scan 1972 year ahead of you
23:22 - 1973 the year that i was born
23:25 - um and it has o and h time complexity
23:29 - so is that where n is the number of
23:32 - points and h is the number of
23:34 - uh wait which is which is faster
23:37 - n log n
23:40 - or n h
23:43 - i would assume n log n is faster right
23:46 - but um these are two different
23:47 - algorithms so um
23:50 - that's great to see what are some other
23:52 - convex hole algorithms that you could do
23:54 - if they don't
23:55 - uh um algorithms
23:59 - [Music]
24:03 - uh convex whole algorithms let's see if
24:05 - we've got a list here
24:07 - uh is there a gram scan gram scan
24:11 - um gift wrapping jarvis march hey wait a
24:14 - second
24:15 - yeah uh gift wrapping o n h gram scan o
24:19 - n log n
24:20 - n log n is faster everybody's saying the
24:22 - chat thank you for confirming that for
24:24 - me
24:25 - i could have done that math in my head
24:27 - but i'm really concentrating on putting
24:29 - words next to each other coming out of
24:31 - my mouth to speak to you you know i'm
24:32 - just a person in a room here and i've
24:34 - got to keep talking or else there's dead
24:36 - air
24:37 - oh you know i need a cricket or a
24:39 - tumbleweed sound effect
24:40 - somebody get on that
24:45 - simon's sending me um simon sending me
24:48 - a generator function card okay let's
24:50 - explore this i want to understand a
24:52 - little bit let's try let's explore
24:53 - generator functions
24:54 - a little bit right now um because
24:58 - that is if i go back to where was i
25:02 - where is my using a generator function
25:05 - so let's look at the code
25:07 - um so one thing this is totally fine i
25:11 - prefer
25:12 - people when they share it to share the
25:14 - um
25:15 - in the p5 web editor not the present
25:17 - view the full view
25:19 - it's kind of silly and you certainly
25:20 - don't have to but that way um if i'm in
25:22 - this view
25:23 - i can quickly get to well where is it oh
25:25 - i think i'm
25:26 - my browser is just off that's weird
25:28 - usually there's oh
25:29 - this is a bug somebody should uh file
25:32 - this for the p5 web editor
25:34 - um in the high contrast view
25:37 - the link in the full view high contrast
25:42 - full view the link to the source code is
25:44 - like black
25:45 - characters on very dark gray so it's
25:47 - really hard to see
25:48 - but i can click there and now i see the
25:50 - code
25:51 - so where is the gem so this is what it
25:54 - means to have a generator function
25:57 - if you put a star this i know if you put
25:59 - a
26:00 - star you get that is a generator
26:03 - function
26:04 - and and then you use this term yield so
26:06 - these are the new things let's
26:08 - let's make my own sketch by the way if
26:10 - you've wondered what side project
26:12 - saturday
26:12 - is it's just me here thinking of random
26:15 - things to do
26:16 - with no logic to them whatsoever
26:17 - although i do have two things on my
26:19 - agenda today that i really do want to
26:21 - get to
26:21 - uh which just to say is one is the live
26:24 - poll continuing the live poll
26:25 - application
26:26 - and two is i want to um augment
26:29 - my object detection example to have some
26:31 - debouncing in it i'll talk about what
26:33 - that means because
26:34 - i want to show that in the video
26:35 - tutorial that is still being put
26:36 - together
26:37 - okay but um generator function
26:40 - ardia said okay boomer which i can only
26:42 - assume is referring to me
26:49 - uh i got one thing to say to you forget
26:51 - the mustard
26:52 - it's karate time
26:59 - what was i saying also we are
27:02 - the city um i have a proclamation i've
27:05 - got some inside jokes that none of you
27:07 - know about
27:08 - and i'm just waiting for the crossover
27:09 - to eventually happen
27:11 - which probably would be a very bad idea
27:13 - so uh all right generator function
27:15 - so if i write a function and i put a
27:17 - star next to it
27:19 - and i said call it choo choo and then i
27:22 - can say something like yield
27:24 - 10 i have no idea what i'm doing here
27:28 - i mean i will look up what a generator
27:29 - function is and i'm sure simon will send
27:31 - me lots more messages explaining it
27:34 - i'm going to write now choo choo can you
27:36 - all see this code
27:37 - um let me move it over a tiny bit and
27:41 - um make it a little bit bigger
27:45 - and let's say console let
27:49 - val equals choo choo console.log
27:53 - now let's just see
27:57 - constructor object so i got an object
28:00 - with nothing admit so i guess a
28:02 - constructor of
28:04 - a generator function gives me back an
28:05 - object yield 10
28:08 - oh okay okay okay i see
28:11 - i see val equals choo choo
28:15 - then if i say console.log val.next
28:18 - [Music]
28:22 - i'm getting an object with the value of
28:26 - 10 so i can do this
28:30 - i got 10. now if i say
28:33 - yield and today is 10 10 20 20.
28:36 - so let's do that 10 10 20 20.
28:41 - if i do this twice
28:46 - i get this is me like sequencing so a
28:49 - generator function is this is like a
28:51 - return
28:52 - value but i can sequence the return
28:55 - values
28:56 - so could i do something weird like this
28:59 - [Music]
29:02 - i mean maybe this is not at all how you
29:04 - would ever use a generator function
29:06 - but can i say something like i times 10
29:11 - and then oh yeah
29:14 - and then and then if i had the draw loop
29:17 - oh i see why you might want to use this
29:19 - with animation
29:21 - because now i can say background
29:23 - [Music]
29:26 - val.next.value no
29:29 - all right i'll just say choo choo dot
29:31 - next dot value
29:36 - and then can i give it an argument well
29:39 - i mean that's it
29:40 - and then i can just say i is less than
29:42 - 255
29:44 - yield i what happens when i get to the
29:46 - end so this should if i'm right
29:49 - show me i've cr i've just written i see
29:52 - why you would use a generator function
29:54 - this is making sense to me now
29:57 - if i have an algorithm that i want to
29:59 - animate but i don't want to have to
30:00 - figure out how to sequence the different
30:02 - steps of the algorithm
30:03 - i can just yield something from the
30:05 - algorithm itself
30:06 - and then ask sort of and ask for
30:10 - uh whatever it's yielding one bit at a
30:12 - time
30:13 - can i put other code after this well
30:16 - we'll find let's see if this works
30:17 - so this should slowly animate
30:20 - to from black to
30:23 - white i would think it's not really
30:25 - working is it
30:31 - hmm i think i did something wrong
30:35 - oh because i made a new i have to have
30:38 - i'm making a new generator each time so
30:40 - it's always starting with zero
30:42 - got it a generator uh i'm this is
30:45 - creating an
30:46 - object that is a generator object so i
30:48 - still need to have something like i
30:50 - would say like
30:51 - um i'll call this looper
30:54 - and i mean the variable names are not
30:56 - making any sense
30:59 - looper equals choo choo and i guess i
31:01 - don't need to like do that in setup i
31:02 - could probably do but i'm just gonna and
31:03 - then i would say
31:05 - [Music]
31:07 - looper.next.value right i can't
31:09 - remake the generator object every time
31:11 - through draw because every time then
31:13 - it's
31:13 - gonna give me a zero let's see if this
31:14 - works i'm just turning off my camera for
31:17 - a second because i have to get a tissue
31:29 - oh i i have a new video tutorial that i
31:31 - definitely want to make at some point
31:37 - um whoops okay so that worked but i
31:40 - definitely got an
31:41 - error at a certain point because
31:45 - object arguments is not a valid color so
31:47 - at some point
31:49 - [Music]
31:51 - it gives when it gets to the end of the
31:54 - loop
31:54 - [Music]
31:58 - what does it return undefined
32:04 - there's no nothing more to yield
32:07 - [Music]
32:10 - what did it return
32:14 - undefined so i guess what i would say
32:17 - is uh if b and i probably could say
32:21 - something like while
32:24 - does this a thing you can do while b
32:29 - equals
32:32 - no like this it doesn't like this
32:35 - expected a conditional expression
32:38 - while how do i make this while b
32:42 - is this something you do i guess we'll
32:44 - be able to i don't know
32:45 - i don't know how to do this in one i
32:47 - mean i could certainly say
32:48 - like if b
32:56 - uh and i can do this
33:00 - this would solve the problem for me but
33:02 - this isn't particularly elegant
33:04 - somebody in the chat will tell me a more
33:05 - elegant way of doing this
33:07 - but look at that
33:10 - [Music]
33:12 - oh while it has a done
33:15 - field the next has a done or but if
33:20 - uh double equals i think yeah
33:23 - no i know double equals but it won't do
33:25 - the assignment
33:27 - um so
33:31 - someone's telling me that i can say
33:34 - something like
33:36 - like if looper
33:41 - is not done
33:43 - [Music]
33:46 - oh oh oh maybe i can say
33:55 - i'm trying to figure out how i say this
33:57 - while true i know
33:59 - uh while result oh oh the looper.next
34:05 - not while though i want to do an if yeah
34:08 - i don't know an
34:08 - if not a while the whole point of this
34:11 - is i'm doing them one at a time in draw
34:13 - and the generator function is the thing
34:15 - that's looping really
34:18 - um
34:21 - yeah um anyway i'm happy with
34:24 - i don't mind having an extra if
34:25 - statement in there i'm just i'm just
34:27 - trying to figure
34:28 - add while true yield 255. oh that's
34:31 - interesting
34:32 - um but that this seems like a bad idea
34:36 - [Music]
34:40 - is this actually like that like it seems
34:42 - like such a bad idea
34:44 - is this a time when an infinite loop
34:48 - is okay let me just save this as
34:52 - exploring because is it really not
34:55 - is it building up a big stack first
34:58 - and then peeling them like does it run
35:00 - all this first and then it gives me the
35:02 - values one at a time
35:03 - or does it actually somehow only step
35:06 - through this
35:08 - each time i call next that would be the
35:10 - question looper.next.done
35:13 - i know but um all right so i guess i
35:16 - could say
35:17 - if looper
35:21 - but i don't so i guess i could say
35:23 - something like next equals looper.next
35:27 - if next is not done
35:33 - is this like sort of more proper now uh
35:36 - background next dot value
35:39 - [Music]
35:41 - i feel like the lighting in here just
35:42 - changed did somebody have hacked my
35:45 - network all right um
35:49 - i'm gonna take this out for a second
35:51 - here
35:51 - [Music]
35:52 - are you looking for this
35:56 - okay here you go this gloria pickle
35:59 - all right don't knock that over
36:03 - okay um it's lazy so it pauses the code
36:08 - every time it gets to a yield
36:09 - statement imagine the generator to have
36:12 - user input
36:12 - it doesn't build it calculates one at a
36:14 - time so marcos and simon and kobe are
36:16 - all telling me this
36:17 - so this is actually totally legitimate
36:20 - um and my
36:21 - um this is the kind this is the time of
36:24 - season when my
36:27 - allergies kick in time of year and it's
36:31 - a lot of anxiety around any small
36:33 - symptoms
36:35 - but i think i'm fine a little runny nose
36:40 - is i can i can tolerate okay wait
36:43 - i just want to see let's run this code i
36:45 - want to move on in a second but this was
36:46 - super interesting to do if
36:48 - [Music]
36:52 - next.done is not a function it's a
36:53 - property
36:54 - [Music]
36:57 - no unexpected token oh
37:00 - whoops we need a parenthesis there
37:06 - all right this looks good
37:11 - excellent and now what everybody's
37:13 - telling me is this is actually okay for
37:15 - me to say
37:16 - oh i'm scared i'm scared let's play this
37:20 - sound
37:21 - we're gonna write it in for the loop
37:22 - we're gonna run it and we're gonna
37:24 - like it
37:35 - looking good i can even comment this is
37:38 - now irrelevant because
37:39 - it will do that forever let's see if we
37:42 - get an error message now it's never
37:44 - going to be done
37:51 - generator functions
37:52 - [Music]
37:54 - all right so i i think there's a lot
37:56 - more that i could do with this
37:58 - um and simon writes the way i normally
38:00 - use a generator function is if i have
38:02 - code that i want to
38:03 - pause at some point then i put that code
38:05 - in a generator function and i put
38:07 - a yield statement every time i want to
38:09 - pause it that's interesting
38:11 - um and kobe writes
38:14 - imagine the generator to have user input
38:17 - so um
38:18 - this is super helpful
38:21 - okay so um i i think that i this is
38:24 - actually terrific
38:26 - um and what i like about this is one of
38:28 - the things i was worried about with
38:29 - generator functions i thought oh maybe i
38:31 - shouldn't really use that with animation
38:32 - because i don't like to have two
38:34 - asynchronous threads going on and one is
38:37 - doing the drawing and i don't know
38:38 - if the value is updating in the right
38:40 - order but this is not
38:41 - a separate asynchronous thread really
38:44 - this is
38:44 - about me being able to write some code
38:47 - that i can sort of like pause and step
38:49 - through almost like a debugger
38:50 - like go to the next line go to the next
38:52 - line um
38:53 - so and then draw can just always call
38:56 - next
38:57 - and animate oh this is amazing this is
38:58 - going to change my
39:00 - life this is a life-changing moment on
39:02 - the coding train this is historic
39:04 - are you all here for this oh my god
39:08 - does this exist in like java like is
39:11 - there an equivalent
39:12 - uh java generator function i mean
39:15 - i don't generate a function could mean
39:17 - so many different things generator
39:19 - function equivalent
39:20 - in java iterator that
39:23 - is a generator a thing in python is that
39:25 - where it comes from yield
39:27 - yeah uh
39:30 - looks like there's a stack overflow post
39:32 - i'll have to look into this a little
39:33 - more but
39:33 - once again you know the beauty and
39:36 - wonder of javascript in its sort of like
39:38 - simplicity of syntax which can lead you
39:41 - very astray
39:42 - admittedly as soon as you start to look
39:45 - at it in java it's kind of like
39:47 - oh my god i feel a little sick even
39:50 - though i do
39:50 - i love i need my love sound effect for i
39:53 - love java can someone write a little i
39:54 - love java i like coffee
39:57 - i like tea i like the java jive and it
40:00 - loves me
40:03 - that was pathetic and really out of tune
40:05 - and not melody
40:07 - python has it says um
40:10 - says the chat uh ruby two says uh essay
40:13 - mcqueen mcquenzy
40:15 - um yeah all right um we've gotta move on
40:18 - we're almost at the middle of the live
40:20 - stream we've got 20 minutes till the
40:22 - middle of the live stream where i'll
40:23 - take a break
40:24 - um thank you for uh those two community
40:27 - contributions i
40:28 - would like to look at more i will i'm
40:31 - going to save this code
40:32 - um and if i can remember and someone
40:35 - will help remind me i want to make sure
40:37 - i add this to the description
40:39 - for this video it's a little kind of
40:40 - generator example
40:42 - um all right let's um
40:46 - let's take a moment to relax and read
40:48 - some random numbers
40:52 - no no no no i just got to delete my old
40:55 - lullaby sound all right
40:59 - good morning everyone
41:02 - we've been here on the coding train
41:05 - smooth
41:06 - ride not so bumpy for about 40 minutes
41:10 - what have i done i'm not really sure
41:13 - i can barely remember anything but
41:18 - i would like to read some random numbers
41:20 - helps me wake up in the morning
41:23 - helps me think about what i want to code
41:25 - today
41:28 - and here we are uh you know what
41:31 - hey let's start on page one eventually
41:34 - we'll get through this whole book
41:35 - i'm gonna this is this is a this is
41:37 - another historic moment
41:38 - [Music]
41:41 - i'm gonna bookmark where we are i'm
41:42 - gonna read this whole book to you
41:44 - someone will later then edit it all
41:46 - together
41:48 - it's gonna be wonderful page one
41:52 - line one it's actually line zero
41:58 - ten thousand ninety seven
42:03 - thirty two thousand five hundred and
42:04 - thirty three
42:06 - seventy six thousand five hundred and
42:08 - twenty
42:10 - thirteen thousand five hundred and
42:12 - eighty six
42:14 - thirty four thousand six hundred and
42:16 - seventy three
42:18 - fifty four thousand eight hundred and
42:20 - seventy six
42:23 - eighty thousand nine hundred and fifty
42:25 - nine
42:27 - nine thousand one hundred and seventeen
42:30 - [Music]
42:32 - oh there's a minute left of this song
42:35 - [Music]
42:36 - thirty nine thousand two hundred and
42:38 - ninety two by the way
42:39 - what i love about doing this is i have
42:41 - right on my dashboard concurrent viewers
42:44 - and i just want to i assume that as soon
42:45 - as i start this the viewers are just
42:47 - going to go down and down and down
42:51 - 74 945 all of you watching from
42:55 - all around the world where it's night
42:56 - time and you're saying good night
42:58 - bishwest this is oddly soothing thirty
43:01 - seven thousand five hundred and forty
43:03 - two
43:04 - four thousand eight hundred and five
43:07 - sixty four thousand eight hundred and
43:09 - ninety four
43:10 - seventy four thousand two hundred and
43:12 - ninety six
43:14 - twenty four thousand eight hundred and
43:15 - five twenty four thousand and thirty
43:18 - seven
43:20 - twenty thousand six hundred and thirty
43:23 - six
43:24 - ten thousand four hundred and two
43:26 - [Music]
43:28 - eight hundred and twenty two ninety one
43:30 - thousand
43:31 - six hundred and sixty five and that was
43:35 - random number asmr with your host daniel
43:38 - shiffman on a saturday
43:41 - all right i don't do i dare fold over
43:43 - the page i i just got through
43:45 - line zero and line one on page one
43:47 - that's where we are we've got a million
43:49 - numbers to go and each line has
43:51 - 10 numbers we've read 20 numbers
43:54 - you do the math of what percentage
43:56 - completion this is
43:57 - i'm gonna get through this whole book
43:59 - one issue is there's a page missing
44:02 - in my copy uh it's i have to find it
44:06 - i put it somewhere else like so i have
44:08 - to uh i should check
44:09 - eventually at some point i'm gonna get
44:10 - to a missing page um
44:12 - but there we go uh how do i uh i need
44:15 - like a web application that helps me
44:17 - keep track
44:18 - of which random number i'm on so this
44:20 - was line one
44:23 - number uh ten i should count from zero
44:28 - so this is if we're if the book is a two
44:31 - dimensional array
44:32 - i'm at index one nine index
44:36 - row one column nine so really nine one
44:38 - if somebody could just quickly build
44:40 - that for me i could do that as my side
44:42 - project
44:43 - oh and i should use my everyday calendar
44:46 - uh
44:47 - have i read uh have i read random
44:50 - numbers today
44:52 - my everyday calendar is behind the green
44:54 - screen
44:55 - so i don't know maybe i won't do that
44:57 - right now okay so we'll work on that
44:59 - later
45:01 - all right ryan writes i felt like i just
45:04 - went to church
45:05 - for numbers yes hallelujah the random
45:09 - numbers have spoken that is my religion
45:13 - randomness that's that
45:17 - i think that is what has led me to be
45:19 - here with you today
45:20 - drinking from this high clear castle mug
45:24 - with lights pointed at me in an attic in
45:26 - brooklyn new york watching
45:27 - this number called concurrent viewers
45:30 - typing on a computer
45:32 - broadcasting on youtube it's all because
45:34 - of
45:35 - [Music]
45:36 - what randomness all right
45:39 - or maybe so this is random this
45:42 - is noise purlin noise that is in the
45:44 - core random
45:46 - algorithm the actual random algorithm um
45:48 - all right what are we going to do today
45:50 - um i want to work on the live poll
45:52 - application and i want to
45:54 - debounce my um
45:58 - object detection ml5 example i think i'm
46:00 - gonna start with that first
46:02 - because i really need that um
46:08 - so let me save this and let me open up
46:11 - here
46:11 - go to file open and let's go to
46:17 - ml5 uh object detection
46:21 - okay oh this is the hmm
46:25 - wait a second here right this is the
46:29 - example that uses a static image
46:31 - with gloria and greta and let's make
46:35 - sure it works i guess it's loading the
46:36 - model it's taking a while
46:39 - the concurrent viewers went way down
46:40 - during that segment that's so funny
46:44 - all right uh and then now let me open
46:47 - up what i mean to open up which is
46:53 - ml5 object detection webcam
46:56 - [Music]
47:00 - okay so we can see by the way a little
47:03 - behind the scenes here i am in an attic
47:05 - there's the ceiling uh the top of the
47:08 - green screen
47:09 - is back there uh and we can see that
47:13 - what um the ml5 object detector does
47:17 - is it is a pre-trained model trained off
47:19 - of the coco
47:21 - image data set it's called coco ssd this
47:23 - is a model available from tensorflow.js
47:26 - um it actually only recognizes 80 things
47:28 - and i could pull up that list
47:30 - um if someone wants to find it and put
47:31 - it in the chat it is
47:33 - uh the the coco classes um there's 80 of
47:36 - them
47:37 - um i doubt a train whistle is one of
47:39 - them but you can see a toothbrush is
47:41 - it a baseball bat um i
47:44 - suspect this mug would get recognized
47:47 - oh it's white so i can't see the label
47:50 - it says cup
47:51 - um so um that's this is a good one for
47:54 - me
47:55 - to try to use so what the thing that i
47:58 - want to do
47:59 - and it's a little unfortunate oh you
48:00 - know what i'm gonna do i have an idea
48:03 - this is probably a bad idea
48:07 - i have a separate webcam here
48:11 - and i wonder i kind of want to
48:16 - put this here
48:27 - let's see if i can you'll see what i'm
48:30 - trying to do
48:31 - for a moment by the way look at this
48:33 - great scar i've got on my elbow remember
48:34 - that from a few years ago
48:36 - feeling strong okay um
48:42 - let's see uh what do i want to do let's
48:44 - go to
48:46 - just open up quicktime player for a
48:47 - second and do
48:49 - new uh movie recording
48:52 - and uh okay uh there's the obs virtual
48:55 - camera
48:56 - there's the facetime camera and now this
48:58 - camera this is the new camera i've added
49:00 - the reason why i want to do this
49:54 - should be careful about what i'm showing
49:56 - here facetime i want it to default to
49:59 - the hd pro webcam this is a useful trick
50:01 - by the way
50:02 - um you can write javascript code to
50:04 - select the camera
50:05 - oh the mic is out
50:35 - okay the mic is back um what you're
50:37 - looking for
50:39 - you need the plug yes
50:44 - well you can say yes
50:52 - an outlet that would work with that
50:54 - you're going to have to find one
50:55 - downstairs somewhere okay
50:57 - i don't have one up here uh it's a mic
50:59 - back so by the way
51:01 - this is the actual one time where in
51:03 - discord
51:04 - those who just heard please tag me when
51:06 - you tag me
51:07 - it actually makes a notification sound
51:09 - in my ear i finally set that up
51:12 - but um writing the messages
51:16 - uh uh yeah so and and and uh otherwise
51:19 - and uh this is
51:20 - maybe mostly for simon thank you for
51:22 - your enthusiasm but
51:24 - tagging me less uh for just like
51:27 - little notes is um would be my
51:30 - suggestion so
51:31 - really try to use the tagging me um
51:34 - sparingly because
51:35 - otherwise i'll ignore it um but
51:37 - hopefully it's back now
51:38 - um how um
51:42 - when did that go when did the mic go out
51:50 - anyway i don't know when it went out but
51:51 - what i was talking about is this is very
51:53 - useful
51:53 - there is a way to write javascript code
51:56 - to pick the camera that you want
51:58 - but i find just going into the browser
52:00 - settings and selecting the camera
52:01 - is often uh a great a an easier thing to
52:04 - do because
52:05 - now if i go back to here
52:11 - i should have great this camera so look
52:14 - it recognizes my hand as a person
52:16 - and the cup and it gets person too
52:20 - interesting
52:21 - all right so what i want to do is i want
52:23 - to eliminate
52:25 - the fact you know what i realize i've
52:27 - done this before and i'm going to make
52:28 - this
52:29 - i don't want to make this so super
52:30 - complicated um
52:33 - when i opened the webcam 10 40 10 the
52:35 - time doesn't help me i wouldn't know
52:36 - what i was
52:37 - saying but that's okay uh all right
52:40 - um you know
52:44 - david says tagging me for emergencies
52:45 - only i think there's somewhere in
52:47 - between there
52:48 - like it doesn't have to just be
52:49 - emergencies like it could be that i
52:53 - you know but i don't know what the
52:54 - threshold is but um
52:56 - it can be a little bit lower than
52:58 - emergencies um
53:00 - all right now or maybe we can figure out
53:03 - a way
53:04 - to have a specific like keyword that
53:06 - plays a sound from discord
53:08 - um but um anyway
53:12 - somebody just tagged me
53:15 - except it wasn't in the live chat
53:16 - somebody maybe sent me a message
53:18 - somewhere else
53:19 - because it could be like the problem is
53:21 - there's any discord anywhere
53:22 - so i probably should set up a particular
53:24 - bot or something
53:26 - that listens for a certain thing and
53:27 - then plays a sound effect for me anyway
53:29 - moving on um what i want to do is i want
53:33 - to build
53:34 - uh something quickly here where when i
53:37 - move the cup
53:39 - in and out uh first of all it's sort of
53:41 - like interpolates a little bit so it's
53:42 - smoother
53:43 - and then if it disappears if it loses it
53:45 - for a second it keeps it
53:46 - and i actually now i'm realizing i have
53:48 - done this
53:49 - face detection uh shiftmen
53:55 - let's see uh
53:58 - i i made this example i don't know how
54:02 - to find it so i'm doing it again
54:03 - um let's see here okay
54:08 - so
54:10 - detections hmm
54:14 - this is interesting i have a weird idea
54:20 - uh i'm gonna say i'm gonna change this
54:23 - to an
54:24 - object oh this is exciting
54:30 - this is gonna be an object now when i
54:34 - get the results
54:38 - i'm going to loop through them
54:45 - this is everything that's detected
54:47 - [Music]
54:50 - and i am going to say uh the label is
54:54 - results index i dot label
54:57 - believe that's
55:01 - um dot label
55:06 - then i'm going to say if detections
55:10 - dot label now like this
55:14 - so i'm going to make this an object
55:16 - basically the idea of this object is i'm
55:18 - going to do something like this
55:20 - it's going to have a cup array a
55:23 - person array i'm this detections
55:27 - object is going to be a lookup table of
55:30 - all the things that it currently has
55:32 - that it thinks is in the scene and
55:34 - they're all organized by label
55:38 - um
55:42 - so um
55:46 - so if it already exists
55:50 - then i want to basically look at
55:55 - the current list of existing
55:58 - objects and so the current object that
56:03 - i'm looking at
56:04 - [Music]
56:07 - is results index i
56:10 - so the label is object.label
56:12 - [Music]
56:15 - and then the existing ones are
56:17 - detection.label
56:18 - so now i want to determine
56:24 - i mean this would be much simpler if i
56:25 - knew i only ever was going to have one
56:27 - cup
56:28 - so maybe i should restrict myself to
56:30 - that
56:32 - but if i want to make this totally
56:34 - generic
56:36 - then i could have multiple cups i want
56:38 - to find the
56:39 - per cup that's there that's been there
56:42 - the longest
56:45 - so one thing i could say is if existing
56:48 - dot
56:48 - length is equal to zero
56:56 - then i want to say
56:59 - existing dot push that object
57:05 - so basically if there's nothing there
57:08 - push that object into it
57:12 - the other thing that i want to do this
57:14 - is a little bit weird
57:16 - is i want to add a new property to the
57:18 - object
57:20 - [Music]
57:22 - and i'm just going to give i'm going to
57:23 - call this timer because basically i want
57:25 - an object to be able to exist
57:27 - for a certain amount of time
57:32 - then um
57:39 - so i'm going to leave that code there
57:40 - for right now
57:43 - then in draw i am no longer looping
57:46 - through all the detections
57:49 - i want to get all the labels let's do
57:52 - this is
57:55 - object.keys of the detections
57:57 - [Music]
58:01 - then for all of the objects
58:05 - of no all of the label
58:10 - of labels
58:12 - [Music]
58:17 - loop through all
58:21 - of the labels label oh this is
58:24 - ridiculous
58:26 - no no no detections label okay
58:28 - [Music]
58:30 - uh detection objects
58:35 - equals detections label
58:37 - [Music]
58:40 - and then i'm going to stop for a second
58:43 - to explain what i'm doing but just give
58:44 - me a second
58:45 - all right basically what i've done
58:48 - now is i have all of the detections
58:51 - organized by label
58:53 - so first i need instead of just looping
58:55 - through all the detections whatever the
58:56 - labels might be
58:58 - i need to get what are all the labels
58:59 - that exist and then for every label
59:02 - what are what are the objects associated
59:03 - with that label and then draw those
59:06 - so this should give me
59:11 - the and it's it's actually only the i
59:14 - have a theory of what's going to happen
59:15 - think to yourself
59:16 - as soon as i put this cup here oh boy
59:21 - i got nothing all right that's weird
59:23 - what did i
59:24 - what did i forget
59:25 - [Music]
59:30 - so detections is an object
59:33 - results
59:36 - well let's console.log
59:39 - [Music]
59:41 - label here
59:44 - oh did i delete my call back to no no
59:48 - it's detector.detect is still there
59:54 - all right let's see what happens here
59:59 - weird oh results dot length
60:02 - i don't know where i i missed this
60:04 - results.length that's the issue
60:11 - oh it's almost 11. i'm gonna take my
60:13 - break soon see if i can finish this
60:15 - okay cup person cut person so
60:19 - this is a little this is interesting so
60:22 - [Music]
60:24 - oh if it doesn't exist if it doesn't
60:27 - exist
60:28 - then
60:34 - existing equals detections label
60:37 - no that's if it does exist so confused
60:42 - oh but if it doesn't exist and the
60:45 - length is zero
60:46 - or
60:47 - [Music]
60:52 - i also need to do this right if it
60:55 - doesn't exist
60:59 - um if it doesn't exist i also want to
61:02 - add it so the two times i want to add it
61:04 - is if it exists but the length of the
61:08 - array is
61:08 - zero then i definitely want to put it in
61:10 - there
61:12 - or if it doesn't exist at all then i
61:15 - want to oh i want to
61:17 - say detections
61:21 - label and again wherever my i will
61:24 - refactor this later song is
61:28 - it absolutely needs that
61:33 - [Music]
61:36 - um it's an empty array
61:39 - [Music]
61:44 - is the mic really loud uh let me know
61:46 - somebody is saying that in the chat
61:49 - all right existing is not defined
61:53 - oh
62:00 - okay so
62:06 - guess what i could do is this
62:10 - right so if it doesn't exist
62:14 - make it an array with that object in it
62:15 - [Music]
62:18 - i'm gonna i'm gonna get there people
62:20 - don't worry
62:23 - okay yeah so the first time it happens
62:25 - it detects it and it puts it there
62:27 - so that's good now i want to implement
62:30 - the timer
62:31 - [Music]
62:32 - so always the uh
62:37 - for every object its timer should
62:40 - decrement and i'm gonna
62:42 - have a decrement by 10 and i'm going to
62:45 - say
62:45 - if object object.timer is less than zero
62:50 - now i need to remove it
62:55 - so if it ever gets below zero i want to
62:57 - delete that object
62:58 - from the object's array
63:02 - objects splice i1
63:05 - i want to just get rid of it now if i'm
63:08 - doing splice
63:10 - i technically i should be going through
63:12 - the array backwards
63:14 - and again i'll just play the refactor
63:16 - song over and over again
63:19 - but um because i if i'm taking things
63:21 - out
63:22 - i've i've covered this in countless uh
63:24 - videos
63:25 - and there are other ways of approaching
63:26 - this but so now
63:29 - um let's see this and i want to say fill
63:33 - [Music]
63:34 - and let's give it uh some alpha that is
63:38 - the timer
63:40 - so let's see if this works
63:44 - so now what i'm doing is as soon as it
63:45 - detects an object
63:49 - right it fades it out and then it finds
63:52 - the new one let's this is happening so
63:54 - fast let's have the timer just go down
63:57 - by one
63:59 - [Music]
64:06 - so now i move this over here it's going
64:08 - to fade out and then it's going to catch
64:10 - the new one
64:12 - it's going to catch the new one so what
64:14 - i
64:16 - want to do now is match
64:19 - dining table i now the next thing i need
64:22 - to do
64:23 - is account for the situation when
64:26 - [Music]
64:27 - there's already a cup in the scene so
64:30 - just
64:31 - update the cup that was there with the
64:33 - new
64:34 - bounding box of the cup so in order to
64:37 - do
64:37 - that if existing length is not zero
64:41 - then the algorithm here that i need to
64:43 - implement is
64:46 - find oh and interesting
64:50 - copper france is saying you can do
64:51 - splice i minus minus -1
64:53 - in normal order
64:57 - find the object that
65:00 - closest so
65:03 - the record distance is
65:08 - um infinity
65:10 - [Music]
65:12 - look through
65:17 - um all of the what do i i'm gonna call
65:19 - them options
65:20 - [Music]
65:22 - option of detections
65:28 - [Music]
65:29 - oh existing
65:32 - [Music]
65:34 - candidate let's call them candidates
65:36 - candidate of existing
65:38 - and then the distance and i could use
65:41 - width and height
65:42 - to like do but i'm just going to very
65:44 - very simply
65:45 - look for the distance between candidate
65:48 - x
65:49 - candidate y and object x object
65:52 - y if dist oh and then
65:56 - record dis okay i need an if statement
65:58 - here because if
66:00 - [Music]
66:02 - closest equals uh
66:05 - no if
66:11 - distance is
66:18 - less than the record distance the record
66:22 - distance
66:22 - is the new distance
66:26 - and the closest is the candidate
66:31 - then i also want to say candidate.taken
66:36 - equals true so in other words it's very
66:39 - important that i don't
66:41 - assign an existing object
66:44 - to 2 to two new things that it's
66:46 - detected
66:47 - i'm really making this super complicated
66:50 - and
66:50 - uh i will refactor this song and i will
66:53 - take your suggestions but
66:55 - um but but i won't but let me keep going
66:57 - down this road
66:58 - um and see where we go
67:04 - sorry i saw a heart emoji in the chat
67:06 - and from aaron
67:07 - i started out from your videos
67:08 - learning.js and i've recently been
67:10 - learning how to code deep learning
67:11 - machine learning models thank you so
67:12 - much for your tutorials
67:13 - appreciate it a lot thank you aaron so
67:16 - nice of you to say
67:17 - all right uh candidate taken
67:20 - and then um closest
67:25 - so now i would say
67:29 - closest
67:31 - [Music]
67:35 - okay
67:40 - so i'm i'm gonna do something a little
67:42 - um copy
67:43 - x y with height so i'm gonna just say
67:46 - uh the candidates no
67:52 - closest equals candidate yeah the
67:56 - closest
67:58 - x should be
68:02 - the object's x there we go and i'm going
68:05 - to use lerp in a moment the closest
68:08 - y is i'm going to update it closest
68:11 - w is the object's width closest
68:15 - height is the object site so when i
68:17 - found the closest one
68:18 - i update it with the new values and then
68:21 - also
68:22 - um
68:24 - [Music]
68:28 - no i don't do this here closest
68:31 - taken is true now i say it's taken and
68:34 - also its timer can be reset back to 100.
68:38 - so its timer can be reset back to 100
68:42 - and then so after i do all of this
68:52 - no no no no sorry everybody
68:55 - this doesn't happen in the loop when i
68:58 - finish going through all the candidates
69:00 - if if there is one that it found is
69:04 - closest
69:09 - and so now i can also say and candidate
69:12 - is not taken right when i'm going if
69:14 - there's multiple objects
69:17 - uh if then i can say
69:21 - if closest otherwise
69:26 - i'm also then once again going to push
69:28 - it in it's a new
69:29 - otherwise it's a new object and let's
69:33 - add it
69:34 - oh this has really become kind of a mess
69:38 - let's review all this logic i don't know
69:40 - if this is right
69:43 - let's review this logic uh i really
69:45 - should
69:46 - this is where i wish i i should have set
69:47 - up my overhand camera with a diagram
69:49 - but i think i can talk through this so
69:52 - what are the various possibilities
69:54 - it detects the cut and let me let me
69:56 - turn the camera off first
69:58 - it detects a cup if it detects this cup
70:01 - it's either
70:03 - totally new cup because there are no
70:05 - cups there
70:06 - or all the other cups are already taken
70:10 - so it either has to like add it as a new
70:11 - cup or match it with something that was
70:13 - there in the previous frame i didn't do
70:14 - a good job
70:15 - explaining that let's try let me just
70:16 - see if i'm sure there's something wrong
70:18 - here
70:18 - let me just see if this even works
70:22 - i'm not resetting taken anywhere very
70:24 - good point
70:25 - [Music]
70:28 - so when i get to the point of drawing
70:30 - them all
70:34 - at the end
70:37 - i guess in the beginning
70:49 - um right before i found all the results
70:53 - i guess right here
70:56 - there's got to be a better way to do
70:57 - this
70:59 - but
71:02 - um let me use this
71:07 - [Music]
71:09 - loop right here at the beginning right
71:11 - before i'm about to do this evaluation
71:15 - um i want to
71:19 - [Music]
71:23 - and boy are there some like higher order
71:26 - one line of code things i could write
71:27 - but i just want to uh right before i
71:30 - start everything existing is not taken
71:32 - right
71:33 - for all the labels and all the objects
71:35 - that are there there none of them are
71:37 - taken
71:37 - so that now um all the candidates are
71:40 - available
71:41 - and they'll only be set to take in there
71:43 - okay
71:49 - let's see if this works
71:54 - all right it is now when
71:57 - i remove the cup it's there
72:01 - and it disappears now look what happens
72:04 - when i
72:05 - remove the cup again if i bring it back
72:08 - it knows it's the same cup so i could
72:10 - actually give everything an id
72:12 - also by the way that would be kind of
72:14 - interesting
72:16 - let's give everything an id
72:20 - i can't believe this worked let's give
72:23 - everything an id
72:25 - uh id count
72:28 - equals zero and whenever i make a new oh
72:32 - boy i make a new object in so many
72:33 - different places
72:36 - so this is why i need to refactor this
72:38 - which i might even do right now
72:40 - and i know i've got to move on but i'm
72:42 - so i this is like so helpful for me to
72:44 - take care of this example right now
72:46 - and maybe i should make this a video um
72:49 - this is like a sort of persistence
72:51 - um and i haven't really tested this so
72:53 - well like what if i have two cups
72:55 - but i'll come i'll i'll try to do that
72:58 - maybe
72:58 - with this mug would this also be a cup
73:01 - cell phone
73:05 - i could probably get two cell phones
73:06 - going um what was i looking for
73:10 - anytime i make a new object
73:24 - this is a new object
73:27 - this is a new object those are the only
73:30 - places if i say push
73:33 - existing push
73:37 - or also this is a new object
73:42 - so for example object dot id equals id
73:45 - count
73:48 - and then increment it so again
73:53 - this is if it's new right only if i'm
73:56 - updating it i don't give it a new id
73:59 - and then also this is if it's new
74:03 - so in theory let me see here when i'm
74:06 - drawing it
74:09 - i should be able to say
74:13 - add the id
74:16 - let me not make this white right now
74:20 - let me make this bigger um
74:24 - let's see what happens here
74:28 - let's see if this works
74:32 - okay cup zero person one
74:36 - so i take my cup away and if i bring it
74:39 - back
74:39 - it's still cup zero but if i take it
74:42 - away and for a long enough time it fades
74:44 - out and is gone
74:45 - should be cup two so i could uh
74:49 - the idea is a unique idea across all of
74:51 - them so it's not cup two it's cup one
74:53 - but there was a person there
74:55 - so and then how can i get another cup
74:57 - let's see
74:59 - will this ever be a cup
75:02 - it's so many things bars three remote
75:05 - and by the way
75:06 - that timer of a hundred is much too long
75:09 - so i think now i can have the timer
75:12 - uh run out much faster like the point is
75:15 - it's just a debounce like
75:16 - if it's you know briefly blips away
75:24 - um so you can see like now if it's gone
75:26 - it's gonna like fade out much more
75:28 - quickly
75:30 - uh new cup new cup now the other thing i
75:33 - want to do
75:34 - is i want to interpolate because it's
75:37 - very it can be very jittery
75:39 - so the last piece of this is
75:42 - is to use the lerp function so i'm going
75:45 - to use the lerp function which is linear
75:46 - interpolation and
75:48 - you can find my video on linear
75:49 - interpolation if you're wondering about
75:51 - that
75:52 - uh and let's just add lerp here i want
75:55 - to learn between
75:56 - object x and
75:59 - closest x and closest y
76:02 - and closest w and closest
76:05 - uh h and then how much do i want to lerp
76:10 - some amount i will talk about what this
76:12 - means in one second let me just finish
76:14 - typing this
76:18 - all right so the idea here is if
76:21 - the cup moves uh and like changes its
76:26 - size
76:26 - kind of uh drastically and this cup is
76:29 - pretty stable actually
76:31 - so i should my hand is much more
76:34 - unstable in the sort of person detecting
76:37 - trying to make it you can see that how
76:39 - it like kind of jumps around a lot
76:42 - what i want to do is have it smoothly
76:44 - interpolate between values
76:46 - and so the i'm going i'm taking the
76:50 - current value and the new value and not
76:52 - assigning
76:53 - directly to the new value but sort of
76:55 - averaging those two
76:56 - so even if i just put 0.5 oh and
76:59 - sorry i should just make amount a
77:01 - variable if i put
77:03 - set amount to be 0.5
77:06 - and run it again is there a name for
77:08 - this algorithm that i'm implementing by
77:10 - the way i would like to know
77:15 - um and now so now if i do this
77:20 - you know you can see it's a little bit
77:21 - smoother but if my
77:23 - amount stays much more true to
77:27 - the cur the previous location which is
77:30 - the object location so if i say
77:32 - something like 0.9 whoops
77:34 - point let's just do like nine five for
77:37 - example let's make this really high like
77:38 - nine
77:38 - nine which is going to be way too high
77:43 - whoops oh
77:48 - rock rock of is suggesting i should use
77:50 - the word not
77:51 - set instead of taken but um
77:55 - well hold on it's very hard
77:59 - so it's like two like you can see that
78:00 - it's much too smooth
78:05 - like i don't want it to be that slow and
78:07 - updating
78:08 - so really what i probably want is
78:10 - something like point nine
78:12 - ninety percent
78:17 - let's just see what it looks like with
78:18 - the mug
78:22 - oh put it with you can see how it's so
78:25 - that's even pretty slow like
78:26 - how it's like it's way too much lag i
78:28 - just want to smooth it out a little bit
78:32 - so let's make it more like uh 0.75
78:38 - because it is actually pretty smooth in
78:39 - the first place
78:45 - and i don't know the this is now up to
78:47 - you to like tune how you want it
78:49 - but um you can see here um if i go just
78:54 - be more directly in the frame
78:57 - right it's actually not detecting that's
78:58 - weird did i do something wrong
79:02 - there must be a bug object x y with
79:05 - height
79:06 - no that's weird
79:13 - gone person six
79:16 - why i mean the person tracking is so bad
79:24 - uh let's person now
79:28 - the problem is my hand um let's use this
79:31 - uh thermos bottle
79:35 - yeah no it's working it's just a lot of
79:38 - and also you know maybe i shouldn't add
79:40 - an object until it's been there
79:42 - for like a bit like so i don't get the
79:44 - noisiness
79:45 - but i'm not sure how much i like the
79:49 - the luring all right so the last thing i
79:51 - need to do is um
79:54 - this is done uh maybe i've there's a bug
79:57 - the first
79:57 - kept the first rectangle is kept instead
80:00 - of updated
80:02 - um xx can you say more
80:06 - the first rectangle is
80:10 - kept instead of
80:16 - updated
80:19 - yeah like something is definitely weird
80:20 - about this
80:23 - but it's hard for me to know like if i
80:26 - just make this amount zero
80:28 - [Music]
80:30 - that's just setting it equal to or one
80:36 - no zero would be setting it equal to
80:41 - closest i'm doing something wrong i'm
80:46 - or i guess the person that's really
80:48 - getting my shoulder
80:49 - how come i can't get it to like is it
80:52 - just the person detection that's weird
80:55 - yeah it's just the person i i think me
80:58 - trying to debug it with person detection
80:59 - is bad
81:00 - because the person detection is
81:04 - not it's meant for me to be like much
81:10 - further it's just
81:14 - i still am confused but i guess it's
81:16 - just
81:17 - not accurate right the x coordinate for
81:21 - the person but i
81:23 - i can only imagine that that's
81:30 - i'm losing my mind here maybe use lerp
81:33 - for small movements but go instantly if
81:35 - the new position is larger than a delta
81:37 - that's a that's a yeah it doesn't seem
81:39 - to change dimensions
81:41 - is that the issue are the dimensions not
81:43 - changing
81:45 - object but i'm
81:50 - oh it's with it's not w and h
81:55 - no wonder there's the bug
81:58 - my shorthand is not
82:02 - [Music]
82:06 - it's actually it's width and height
82:09 - there's no w
82:10 - in h i've just like created a false
82:13 - shorthand
82:14 - oh javascript javascript lets you do way
82:17 - too much
82:18 - all right now we should see
82:24 - there we go okay that was the problem
82:28 - that was the problem ah so now let me
82:30 - put the lerp back in
82:32 - [Music]
82:37 - and i'll just leave it at 0.5 just to
82:39 - like
82:40 - i don't need it to be much more smooth
82:43 - [Music]
82:47 - you can see it's a little bit more
82:50 - smooth
82:55 - i should probably have it fade in
83:00 - but i'm not going to worry about that
83:05 - um having it fade in and then fade out
83:08 - would be a good thing
83:09 - i'll let somebody else do that and let
83:11 - me just make the lerp
83:13 - i'm going to go back to point 75 and now
83:16 - uh i need to uh just keep this i just
83:20 - want to see
83:26 - all right so this is good this is now
83:28 - following the object
83:29 - and it's not noisy and you can see that
83:32 - here
83:34 - with the person and then if i leave
83:38 - so what are some other i know that it i
83:40 - had a scissors here uh great
83:42 - i know that scissors is one of the
83:44 - objects
83:45 - so let's see if i can create a short
83:47 - clip with
83:50 - scissors and cup
83:53 - i wish you know what i want to do just
83:56 - for creating a clip of this so
83:58 - this is going to show up in my um in the
84:01 - video is like an extra example
84:04 - so i think what i want to do is not draw
84:06 - a person
84:07 - so i want to say i want to ignore
84:11 - person so how do i do where should i do
84:14 - that
84:15 - um i guess i'll just do it in the
84:17 - drawing
84:20 - as long as object
84:24 - label is not equal to per to person
84:32 - um oh this is real i just want to like
84:40 - yeah don't do the drawing you can still
84:42 - do all the other stuff
84:45 - because i think this will make the
84:46 - demonstration
84:48 - much better and
84:51 - now actually i can use my other camera
84:54 - because uh so let me just make sure this
84:58 - works
85:06 - um
85:09 - i kind of wanted to skip it detecting
85:11 - person
85:13 - so i don't want the ids to go up but
85:21 - i guess i could actually just do it up
85:22 - here and
85:24 - label does not equal a person let's do
85:26 - that
85:27 - um and now let me switch back i'm just
85:29 - going to unplug this camera
85:37 - sense and i'm actually going to hit
85:40 - start record i'm going to record this to
85:41 - disk
85:42 - because um
85:49 - actually you know what i'm not going to
85:50 - record it to disk i'll do that
85:52 - i could also screen record um
85:57 - [Music]
86:00 - a new screen recording just because i
86:02 - want to use this um
86:05 - record entire screen
86:08 - i found this on the web
86:11 - uh record entire screen record am i
86:14 - recording yeah
86:15 - all right so uh let's
86:18 - make this wider so we can the code can
86:22 - be in there a little bit just in case
86:25 - um and now
86:28 - hopefully where are the scissors
86:32 - [Music]
86:34 - oh crap
86:39 - [Music]
86:41 - where was that setting i don't know why
86:43 - i plugged it because that didn't help
86:48 - camera
86:52 - uh camera uh facetime camera
86:57 - [Music]
87:02 - okay
87:05 - okay so now um
87:11 - scissors whoa 189
87:21 - what what's it detecting that's
87:26 - i thought i took out the person
87:40 - like it shouldn't be able to add it
87:42 - something is wrong with this
87:45 - i thought this would as long as it
87:48 - doesn't equal
87:48 - person do all this stuff if you can't
87:52 - add it
87:55 - let me take this off
88:02 - uh
88:06 - yeah so scissors
88:16 - i guess the timer should be a little
88:26 - longer
88:29 - so let me make the timer a little longer
88:32 - because it is
88:33 - um
88:39 - unless it was detecting two of them i
88:42 - should also use the confidence score but
88:45 - all that said i gotta stop uh i'm just
88:48 - gonna have the timer
88:50 - fade out a little bit shorter okay all
88:53 - right
88:54 - last time
88:58 - okay scissors
89:22 - toothbrush
89:24 - just trying to get a clip all right
89:36 - this will be a good demonstration
89:52 - all right i think that's enough footage
89:54 - i recorded enough screen capture that
89:56 - mattia can use that
89:58 - for the video and let me save this as
90:01 - object detection
90:05 - um all right that example is done
90:08 - um
90:14 - any questions about that i mean i got to
90:15 - move on
90:19 - um this is a pretty complicated example
90:21 - um
90:22 - and i know i didn't like fully explain
90:24 - it um
90:26 - so um i uh uh
90:30 - and my brain is hurting now because that
90:32 - was like hard to think through i'd be
90:34 - glad if there was
90:35 - interest to kind of redo that in a video
90:38 - tutorial
90:39 - or kind of like talk through it a bit
90:41 - more but i think i want to leave it
90:42 - there
90:43 - because i want to
90:47 - break and i want to get to the live poll
90:49 - application
90:56 - um so first of all um if people don't
90:59 - know
91:00 - what i'm using um i'm actually using
91:02 - this ml5.js
91:04 - library um and the the uh the
91:08 - the functionality the model that i'm
91:10 - using is something called the object
91:12 - detector but guess what
91:13 - it's not here so the object detector is
91:15 - actually in the current version of ml5
91:18 - but it has not been sort of updated or
91:21 - placed into the documentation yet but
91:22 - there is a new release coming out soon
91:24 - um and so there'll be documentation for
91:26 - that and
91:28 - uh hopefully by the end of this weekend
91:30 - i'll have finished editing together
91:32 - the video tutorial it's about 20 minutes
91:34 - about using the object detector
91:36 - and um whereas and this is just sort of
91:38 - like an additional exercise example
91:40 - that'll go along with that
91:41 - okay um
91:45 - now uh let's
91:48 - give me a second here
91:58 - [Music]
92:19 - [Music]
92:24 - oh
92:27 - all right i'm going to take a break in a
92:29 - moment
92:30 - and then come back and do the live poll
92:32 - application but before
92:33 - i do that i want to take a moment to
92:35 - thank today's sponsor
92:37 - brilliant so do you want to learn
92:38 - something new
92:40 - you do probably if you're watching the
92:42 - coding train brilliant is the place to
92:44 - do it it's a website and app that makes
92:46 - learning accessible and fun
92:48 - you know what this year of 2020 a lot of
92:50 - us are doing a lot of home
92:51 - learning um and so i i do think that if
92:55 - you're
92:55 - looking for something for yourself or
92:56 - your family or a friends
92:59 - um learning about programming and
93:01 - science and physics and all sorts of
93:04 - things you the brilliant website is uh
93:06 - an app is a wonderful place to do so
93:08 - there's no tests no grades there's a
93:09 - whole lot of courses pick what you're
93:11 - interested in get started if you make a
93:12 - mistake
93:13 - no big deal in fact one of the things i
93:15 - love about brilliant is when i get it
93:16 - wrong
93:17 - and then i can read through various
93:18 - community contributed
93:20 - answers and explanations and it really
93:22 - helps me with the process of learning
93:24 - there's
93:25 - algebra programming cutting-edge topics
93:28 - just like the coding train like neural
93:34 - networks
93:43 - watching those videos and learning the
93:44 - code or running the examples is not the
93:46 - full story
93:47 - so going through something like their
93:49 - course on neural networks
93:50 - itself really has a bunch of like
93:52 - interactive visualizations and examples
93:54 - that help you sort of like see
93:56 - how the neural network is working
93:58 - there's also one of my favorite courses
93:59 - if i can pull this up here if this is
94:02 - going to work
94:04 - is the course on infinity um
94:08 - um this is like there's just like the
94:10 - beauty and wonder of infinity the
94:11 - paradoxes of infinity um
94:14 - you know this is like a major aspect of
94:17 - mathematics so the the course starts
94:19 - with basic counting and works its way up
94:21 - to many types of infinity
94:22 - culminating in the profundity of
94:24 - cantor's theorem and here you're seeing
94:26 - the
94:26 - uh i can never say it i want to just say
94:29 - coke
94:30 - but i don't think that's how it's prone
94:31 - i like to say koch also but
94:33 - um the correct there is a correct
94:34 - pronunciation that i'm sure all of you
94:36 - will tell me about in the chat um but
94:37 - this particular
94:38 - snowflake fractal i have a coding
94:39 - challenge that makes exactly this and
94:41 - brilliant is a
94:42 - really wonderful complement to a lot of
94:44 - the coding um coding challenges i have
94:46 - um what i think i want to do
94:48 - um you know so let me coming back to
94:52 - uh here for a second uh briefly
94:55 - is that so you know i encourage you to
94:57 - sign up um you can sign up for free at
94:59 - uh you just
95:00 - took that down brilliant.org coding
95:02 - train i'll take a few minute break in a
95:03 - moment and you can use that time to sign
95:05 - up
95:06 - um play around with the site there's
95:07 - lots of tons of stuff you can do there
95:08 - for free
95:09 - and if uh you know lets them know that
95:10 - you found brilliant through me which is
95:11 - helping out the coding train
95:12 - a bit and also if you decide you want to
95:15 - unlock everything that's there or
95:17 - i'll notice right there i have a premium
95:19 - subscription which you can see right up
95:20 - here
95:21 - you know the holiday season is coming up
95:23 - uh what can i do
95:25 - what can i need a gift for somebody
95:26 - gifting somebody a premium subscription
95:28 - is also
95:29 - a wonderful thing to consider by the way
95:31 - i should also mention that brilliant
95:33 - told me that they're doing a lot of
95:34 - redesign
95:35 - uh so some logo and design of the
95:37 - website and app all that's changing
95:38 - coming soon so stay tuned
95:40 - i assume hopefully i'll have the chance
95:41 - to show that to you when it happens if
95:43 - brilliant continues to sponsor the
95:44 - coding trade
95:45 - let's one of the i noticed today i
95:46 - didn't actually uh solve this
95:48 - but i quickly read through one of the my
95:50 - favorite things about brilliant
95:51 - is the um daily challenges um so i want
95:55 - to go to this one that's called the
95:56 - interplanetary goo ball games
95:59 - and the reason why i want to go to this
96:01 - and i'll let me do uh read
96:03 - keep reading is that one of my favorite
96:06 - things about brilliant
96:07 - is the interactive visualizations and
96:11 - animations about
96:12 - problems so this is a i'm gonna
96:14 - paraphrase the
96:15 - longer explanation here this is a game
96:18 - where you throw a ball of goo
96:21 - at another space ball it's a blob of goo
96:25 - and the blob sticks perfectly to the
96:27 - spaceball
96:28 - and based on the mass and the velocity
96:30 - of that ball it will push it
96:32 - in a given direction so if i set the
96:35 - velocity of the left
96:37 - guess i can't set the left blob to 0.5
96:41 - and the right bob to negative 0.5 so the
96:43 - red
96:44 - blob is going to go super fast and the
96:46 - left blob is going to go slow
96:47 - you know imagine what's going to happen
96:49 - whoa wait that was a bug
96:52 - well we just found a bug hold on
96:55 - that's so crazy let's do it the other
96:57 - way around
96:59 - [Music]
97:00 - let's let it finish i think we found a
97:04 - bug in the brilliant website
97:05 - there we go that's what it should do
97:07 - right that fast one's coming at the slow
97:09 - one slows it down a tiny bit
97:11 - so what are the equations there's actual
97:13 - equations
97:14 - for how you calculate the final velocity
97:18 - the mass of the ball plus the mass of
97:20 - the blob
97:21 - uh oh and you know momentum is a concept
97:23 - here the total momentum the conservation
97:25 - of momentum so there's a lot of concepts
97:27 - here
97:28 - and it really relates the reason why i
97:30 - was like excited to see this i was like
97:31 - oh
97:32 - this is like exactly everything that's
97:34 - in my nature of code book
97:36 - about forces and uh newton's laws
97:39 - so there's a lot of uh there's a strong
97:41 - relationship here but what i let's
97:43 - look at the actual
97:46 - let's look at the actual question okay
97:50 - and see if we can answer it in this
97:52 - round of blaster ball
97:54 - the earthling all-stars are given an
97:56 - advantage and let me get the chat back
97:58 - up here
97:58 - because i i put it away for a second
98:03 - um
98:08 - the launch speed of the earthling sticky
98:10 - blobs
98:11 - so earthling or the blue
98:14 - is meters per second the launch speed of
98:18 - mercury re
98:19 - united is a hundred meters per second
98:22 - the blobs are both
98:23 - one kilograms 0.1 kilograms each and the
98:26 - ball
98:27 - is .4 kilograms oh i should i really
98:30 - should just set up my overhead camera
98:32 - with my diagram stuff
98:33 - every day so apologies for that every
98:35 - not every day but every saturday
98:36 - i'll do that next time i don't have it
98:38 - today um
98:40 - and the ball is stationary to begin with
98:42 - okay
98:44 - so if we were to just send one
98:47 - from each if this is going 115
98:52 - milliseconds per second
98:53 - and this is going 100 this one's going
98:55 - to hit first and it's going to end up
98:58 - it's going to overpower this one because
99:00 - it's going to hit first moving faster
99:02 - at the end of the round oh the
99:03 - earthlings have made seven hits
99:06 - and the mercury you know and you murky
99:08 - renaissance made eight
99:10 - which direction is the ball going so i
99:13 - believe the formula
99:15 - uh for an uh and if you read about that
99:18 - i care about is
99:20 - mass times velocity
99:24 - times the number of balls
99:27 - now the mass of both is the same so
99:30 - actually don't
99:31 - if i'm trying to decide which way it's
99:32 - going to go that evens out
99:34 - right and obviously the mass of the blob
99:38 - the so the mass of the blobs are the
99:39 - same and the mass of the ball is
99:40 - important too
99:41 - but again i just want to compare like i
99:43 - don't need the mass of the ball
99:45 - or the mass of the blobs because they're
99:48 - they're equivalent
99:49 - so i think seven earthlings
99:52 - what's 7 times 115 8
99:56 - times 100 is 800 meters per second well
99:59 - yeah 8 times 100 is 800 7 times 115
100:03 - what's 7 times 15 70
100:06 - plus 7 times 5 is 305 right
100:10 - so that's 805 did i do that right
100:14 - 805 is bigger than
100:17 - 800 so the ball is going to go towards
100:21 - mercury i really i really need pen and
100:24 - paper here
100:25 - i've learned my lesson so the answer is
100:28 - toward
100:29 - mercury united the earthlings win all
100:31 - right does every before i
100:32 - select this think about this have i
100:33 - gotten it right have i gotten it wrong
100:43 - i'm gonna pick this
100:47 - and i'm gonna hit submit in a second
100:51 - [Music]
100:56 - yay one of these days
100:59 - my streak's gonna be higher than one day
101:02 - i have gotten
101:03 - many a higher streak than one day but
101:05 - i've never been live streaming when i
101:07 - was like in
101:08 - an existing streak so that is a life
101:11 - goal for me right now
101:12 - um but again what i really like about
101:14 - this is the um explanations oh look at
101:16 - this
101:17 - to 805 100 times 8 is 800 um
101:21 - and um here it looks like here is the
101:24 - full story which the number times the
101:25 - mass times the velocity
101:28 - um and oh look at this
102:26 - i need a new usb cable what it is is
102:28 - this cable is loose
102:30 - i'll show you
102:34 - is loose and it keeps like i can wiggle
102:35 - it and i'll mess up the mic probably
102:38 - but um so sorry about that
102:42 - uh i gotta fix that some tape or
102:45 - something
102:47 - okay oh wow and also that is super loud
102:53 - it goes way into the red anyway um
102:56 - what i was saying i think when i got
102:58 - muted is uh
103:00 - let's create a channel in the discord to
103:03 - talk about
103:04 - the brilliant challenges and if anybody
103:07 - creates a p5.js demonstration or writes
103:10 - an explanation here please share it with
103:11 - me so i can check that out later
103:13 - so i'm going to take a five minute break
103:15 - um
103:16 - and if you feel so inclined please sign
103:18 - up for brilliant.org
103:19 - codingtrain uh write your own
103:21 - explanation for this challenge
103:23 - and i will see you in about five minutes
103:26 - [Music]
103:29 - oh i forgot my intermission because i
103:32 - was doing the live
103:32 - poll actually has
103:36 - i'm gonna just take that out it has a
103:37 - little bit of a browser
103:39 - [Music]
103:41 - uh so weird um as part of my screen
103:45 - showing i'll take that off and see you
103:47 - in a couple minutes
103:56 - [Music]
104:17 - [Music]
104:32 - so
104:35 - [Music]
104:50 - [Music]
105:01 - [Music]
106:38 - do
106:41 - [Music]
106:52 - do
106:56 - [Music]
107:06 - do
107:18 - [Music]
107:56 - [Music]
108:10 - [Music]
108:16 - do
108:18 - [Music]
108:44 - do
108:46 - [Music]
109:12 - all right everyone i am back
109:15 - about 100 of you left when i took the
109:18 - break
109:18 - boy maybe you'll come back it's good
109:22 - it's good there's plenty of you left
109:25 - thank you for sticking around for the
109:26 - rest of this live stream we've probably
109:28 - got
109:28 - about 45 minutes at the most um
109:32 - i want to mention something so i don't
109:34 - know if kobe
109:35 - who's one of the um discord uh manager
109:38 - moderators
109:39 - is and i meant to i mean it's not a big
109:41 - deal but i meant to close this
109:43 - um is um i don't know if
109:46 - kobe is still watching but i quickly
109:49 - created
109:50 - a channel called live links that
109:54 - might not be the right emoji or the
109:55 - right name for it or the right place for
109:56 - it but i'm pretty sure that any channels
109:58 - here only i can post to
110:00 - the reason why i created that is because
110:02 - i realized that
110:04 - um sometimes what i want to do is
110:07 - keep track of links that i
110:11 - am share things quickly with people who
110:14 - are watching the live stream
110:15 - and i could certainly paste something
110:16 - into the youtube chat but that
110:18 - chat scrolls by very fast and i don't
110:20 - actually have it open on this laptop
110:22 - so um i just want to do things like
110:24 - whoops
110:25 - nope that's not getting pasted there
110:27 - like for example like here's the link to
110:29 - the code
110:30 - um so this is like ml5.js
110:33 - object detector with persistence
110:36 - like i can just put this here and so
110:38 - i've got the link to that there there
110:40 - was something else that i wanted to
110:41 - share
110:42 - but also um if any admins or moderators
110:45 - if there's ever a thing like
110:47 - share something that i need to copy
110:49 - paste with me that this could be used
110:51 - for that potentially
110:52 - so um maybe there's a better system for
110:54 - that um
110:56 - but i'll let i'll let everybody sort of
110:58 - work that out but i'm gonna use that for
111:00 - right now so if you're in the discord
111:02 - you should be able to get the code that
111:04 - i just wrote
111:05 - by going over here and let me also get
111:07 - the generator function code also this is
111:09 - useful
111:10 - because i want to add these things to
111:11 - the youtube video description later
111:14 - and so this is a reminder of things for
111:16 - me to add to the you the
111:17 - the the um the description layer so this
111:21 - is the generator function
111:23 - example um so let me go back to discord
111:27 - uh general and yes you can react with
111:28 - emojis here you should be able to
111:30 - generator function uh example
111:35 - um there we go there's that so other
111:37 - things that come up that i'm showing are
111:38 - referring to
111:40 - um i will uh put there okay
111:44 - um yeah the live category oh
111:49 - this is also yes definitely it should go
111:51 - here perfect
111:54 - uh sure i think it's the same
111:56 - permissions
111:58 - and maybe actually what i want to do is
112:01 - make this
112:02 - i'm obsessed with uh the correct emoji
112:06 - and i could just call this
112:10 - links um and then now
112:14 - uh we've got the schedule by the way
112:15 - this is where i post
112:18 - um
112:21 - this is where i post um announcements
112:24 - about the schedule although
112:26 - for once in my life i've got something
112:30 - um i seem to have a regular schedule
112:32 - which is every saturday morning 10 a.m
112:34 - eastern time
112:35 - uh with some exceptions obviously but if
112:37 - you want to get updates
112:38 - i don't use the at everyone tag maybe i
112:41 - should but i use something called at
112:43 - notifications so also if you're in the
112:45 - discord
112:47 - you should go i think um to
112:50 - i think you say how do you how do you
112:52 - subscribe to the notifications
112:54 - what's the command uh there's a command
112:57 - for
112:58 - subscribing to the notifications
113:00 - somebody will tell me
113:01 - in a moment that um okay yeah mr
113:05 - salvation come in the discord i'm really
113:07 - trying to get the discord going
113:09 - um it's just a chat tool that i've been
113:11 - using more and more
113:12 - um it really seems to work well for
113:14 - engaging with the community for people
113:15 - getting help with their code
113:17 - i would say like my two favorite
113:18 - channels are introductions so please
113:21 - introduce yourself there
113:22 - um i just love to scroll through and
113:25 - read these
113:26 - um and learn about the community as well
113:28 - as pets
113:29 - so please share your pets uh
113:33 - same asia isn't he a cutie patootie oh
113:36 - yes
113:36 - qt patootie where's my cutie patootie
113:38 - sound effect all right
113:41 - uh but uh let's go back to uh
113:44 - the safety of this lynx and
113:47 - channel it's uh exclamation point
113:51 - subscribe
113:52 - so just to show you if i do exclamation
113:54 - point subscribe
113:56 - um the bot is going to this stream bot
113:58 - is going
113:59 - giving me the role notifications so
114:02 - please
114:03 - when you join the two big most important
114:05 - steps are
114:07 - read me read the readme
114:11 - react with an emoji to get all the
114:13 - channels unlocked
114:14 - and then i suppose probably the
114:17 - appropriate place to do this is in bot
114:18 - talk
114:20 - do i mean i just did it over here just
114:22 - for reference um
114:23 - exclamation point subscribe unless you
114:25 - don't want the notifications it's very
114:26 - reasonable to not want the notifications
114:28 - we're kind of doing opt in uh we don't
114:31 - uh i i have used at every one i used it
114:33 - once
114:34 - for something i really wanted some help
114:36 - or engagement with and
114:37 - mostly i just got flamed with a lot of
114:40 - people complaining that i'd used it
114:42 - so i do want to reserve the right to use
114:44 - it but um just for weekly schedule
114:46 - updates
114:47 - um just the exclamation point subscribe
114:49 - and
114:50 - if you're wondering how to make your own
114:51 - discord bot stay tuned
114:53 - um certainly you can check the
114:55 - collaboration i did with uh coding
114:57 - garden with cj that's
114:58 - the archive of that is on youtube i
114:59 - think if you search coding garden
115:02 - coding train discord bot you'll find
115:03 - that but i'm soon to be releasing a
115:05 - sequence instead of tutorials
115:07 - okay um one of the things by the way
115:10 - that i finally figured out
115:12 - i don't like having this sidebar shown
115:14 - while i'm live streaming
115:15 - because it shows direct messages and
115:17 - other channels that i'm subscribed to
115:19 - there's nothing necessarily private
115:20 - about that but you know i i'm not
115:22 - you know people who direct message me on
115:24 - discord aren't like opting in to having
115:26 - me show their
115:27 - like profile picture on a live stream so
115:29 - i figured out how to get rid of that
115:31 - by doing command option i
115:34 - which opens up the job this is just a
115:36 - web page inside the app
115:38 - and it opens up the console of course
115:40 - you know you want to be careful about
115:42 - what you
115:42 - paste there and the discord has a nice
115:45 - message but i was able to figure out
115:47 - that
115:47 - um i can hide it by using like some
115:49 - native javascript like document get
115:51 - elements by tag name the navigation bar
115:53 - index zero style.visibility um equals
115:56 - hidden
115:57 - so that's a useful little trick um
115:59 - discord option command i
116:01 - uh pulls that up all right
116:04 - what's next the live poll application
116:10 - so i have about a half an hour to work
116:11 - on this a little bit more and
116:13 - one of the thing that i want to start
116:15 - with is there have been
116:16 - a bunch of pull requests and comments
116:18 - posted so let's take a look at those
116:20 - and see what we can um kind of merge in
116:24 - and add and what's the thing that i
116:27 - should i should if i i should also add
116:28 - this to hacktoberfest
116:30 - um what is the thing i need to add a
116:32 - topic is that what i do
116:34 - um somebody will tell me i think
116:35 - somewhere under
116:37 - where are the topics
116:41 - sometimes oh yeah uh topics
116:46 - is it just this hacktoberfest if i just
116:49 - add this topic
116:53 - um then it will these will be valid
116:56 - so let me do that let me go to the pull

117:49 - um we oh we had a conflict uh
117:53 - giggy oh g you and me were in a tense
117:56 - battle
117:57 - it's uh
118:00 - very very very stressful to be in this
118:02 - conflict but i'm gonna resolve it
118:05 - i'm gonna resolve this conflict we will
118:07 - all feel
118:11 - that we are happy now as i resolve the
118:13 - merge conflict
118:15 - i commit that merge and i understand
118:18 - that i'm updating maine
118:20 - and we all feel good about things
118:26 - and this is my merge conflict resolve
118:29 - music
118:30 - i'm gonna go to your files changed
118:34 - and i'm gonna suggest
118:38 - um i'm gonna suggest that you change the
118:40 - background to green
118:43 - [Music]
118:45 - um one thing i love about these uh
118:48 - github suggestions is as the maintainer
118:50 - of the repo
118:51 - i can actually make a suggestion to
118:53 - somebody's pull request that they can
118:54 - accept
118:55 - in the interest of time i'm just going
118:56 - to go ahead and make the suggestion and
118:58 - accept it myself because i don't want to
119:01 - wait for the back and forth
119:02 - while i'm live streaming but um this is
119:05 - for the chroma key overlay
119:08 - i'll just right here and normally i
119:10 - might start a review
119:11 - and have a bunch of different
119:12 - suggestions and comment but i'm kind of
119:14 - moving quickly here i'm just going to
119:15 - make this a single comment
119:18 - um you can see now that the suggestion
119:19 - is there you know i would normally
119:22 - wait for the discussion to happen with
119:24 - ggog
119:25 - but i'm just going to go ahead and
119:26 - commit those changes and then
119:29 - i am going to um
119:33 - merge this pull request
119:36 - all right we're taking this coding
119:38 - stream coding train themed
119:40 - pull request um
119:44 - so thank you for that um and prob let's
119:46 - get back to
119:48 - um the console here and
119:51 - i believe it's just on my desktop
119:58 - and i forgot how this works
120:01 - but i think if i just run it i will see
120:05 - what i have so far at localhost 3000
120:09 - so this is the current uh poll which you
120:12 - can't vote in right now because i'm not
120:14 - running the server and i haven't made an
120:15 - interface for voting
120:17 - all those things have to come but let's
120:19 - just pull in those new so what i
120:21 - probably should do is check out
120:23 - a different branch and look at the pull
120:24 - request before i merged it
120:26 - but you know me i'm loosely goosey here
120:28 - now i can grab those updates
120:30 - that were already merged uh run it again
120:34 - and take a look at what we've got and
120:37 - there we go
120:38 - i love this change all right coding
120:40 - train live poll
120:41 - so there's a lot of room for improvement
120:43 - here anybody wants to contribute with
120:44 - design
120:46 - uh you know right now the contributions
120:48 - are small enough that i can kind of go
120:50 - through them
120:50 - as i'm working on this project but i i
120:53 - you know i'm
120:54 - if if this stuff if more people want to
120:55 - contribute i might need more of a
120:57 - process
120:57 - for like you know who's actually doing
120:59 - the design or maintaining the design
121:01 - but um if you have some ideas so there
121:05 - we go there
121:06 - um let's go to the next pull request
121:10 - train bogey
121:14 - oh right represent the percentages
121:18 - as train bogies that's indian english
121:22 - i'm not i'm not familiar with that term
121:23 - using emojis i do like this idea
121:26 - now let's see we're i'm almost certain
121:28 - we're going to have some
121:29 - conflicts so oh no
121:34 - we've got to resolve these merge
121:35 - conflicts oh we're in it
121:38 - oh no that's not it
121:41 - we're in a tense battle between train
121:44 - bogie
121:45 - in maine the conflict oh it's a deep
121:48 - dark historical conflict of epic
121:52 - proportions
121:53 - we need to resolve it to feel happy
121:58 - [Music]
122:00 - oh this is gonna be this is gonna be
122:01 - hard um
122:05 - so what do i want
122:12 - okay i think i want to keep the font
122:16 - face
122:19 - i'm so confused
122:24 - i'm so confused here what the reason why
122:28 - i'm confused is i feel like this came
122:29 - from maine why is it oh it is saying
122:32 - it's from maine
122:32 - like is this saying it's that's the
122:35 - above stuff is main
122:37 - and then this is from train bogey
122:41 - yes um
122:46 - and i should use a tissue not my shirt
122:47 - that was kind of disgusting i apologies
122:49 - for that can we edit that out of this
122:51 - live stream
122:54 - i think i might need these glasses for a
122:56 - moment here to figure this out
122:59 - okay um
123:03 - by the way one of my side projects is to
123:06 - whenever i put these glasses on
123:08 - trigger a like party theme that's like
123:10 - just like starts
123:12 - as an overlay all over the screen it's a
123:14 - new side project somebody add that to my
123:16 - list of side projects
123:18 - um all right so i think i kind of want
123:20 - to take everything here
123:22 - in that uh i want
123:26 - all of this that's the body i want to
123:28 - keep the font
123:29 - face um and then here i think this is
123:33 - get
123:33 - i think this is everything i think this
123:36 - is resolved now i think we're resolved
123:37 - we're at peace
123:41 - we're at peace our merge conflict has
123:44 - been resolved
123:45 - and we can take a deep breath and relax
123:48 - with the combined css
123:51 - of train bogie and maine let's mark it
123:55 - as resolved
123:55 - [Music]
123:58 - and again um what i probably would want
124:01 - to do here
124:03 - is um
124:06 - i probably would want to check it first
124:11 - but that's not how i roll uh
124:14 - oh gypsy dangerous requested my review
124:16 - thank you for that
124:17 - um and let's merge it
124:22 - we're gonna go ahead and merge it
124:25 - i need to merge we've
124:28 - merged
124:33 - uh and now i can grab that
124:39 - and run it again and let's see what
124:41 - we've got
124:43 - all right yes
124:46 - we're really cooking with gas now this
124:48 - is awesome
124:49 - okay back to the pull requests
124:52 - [Music]
124:55 - let's take a look at true oh oh oh no
124:57 - this is oh that's the issues let's go
124:59 - back to the pull request
125:00 - moved validation to back end instead of
125:02 - client oh this is
125:04 - thank you for this fantastic so
125:08 - um and and simon is telling me some
125:11 - suggestions here also let's take a look
125:14 - let's do a little review here okay so
125:17 - what's being changed can you see this
125:20 - um we are first getting the port from an
125:24 - environment variable which will be
125:26 - necessary for when it's deployed
125:28 - that's good um i'll take that as a
125:31 - reasonable change
125:33 - and then why is it not scrolling
125:37 - [Music]
125:39 - why can i not get this to scroll when
125:41 - i'm zoomed in there we go
125:43 - um then also if
125:46 - there's no poll send a status error
125:49 - invalid poll id okay like that
125:53 - if object keys poll filter oh i have no
125:56 - idea what this is doing
125:57 - okay the glasses have to come off for
125:59 - this uh
126:01 - all right let's see um
126:03 - [Music]
126:06 - if if
126:10 - okay i'm getting the array of poles
126:14 - and if it doesn't have an id
126:17 - ah if it doesn't include the choice
126:20 - ah i see then invalid choice
126:24 - so last week people put in like little
126:26 - up messages to me in the database
126:28 - so that's good i like this i mean i'm
126:30 - assuming that's working correctly i'm
126:31 - having a hard time unpacking this
126:33 - in my brain like what is this doing that
126:35 - it's i'm giving us the
126:36 - array of all the poles
126:44 - right we found the pole
126:47 - and then filtering it
126:52 - and if it's not an invalid choice
126:56 - i'm just gonna trust this i can't unpack
126:59 - i can't unpack it
127:00 - can somebody face give you like an
127:02 - explanation of what this is doing i
127:03 - could write it in like multiple lines
127:05 - but i'm really having trouble unpacking
127:07 - it but i can see i'm gonna sort of trust
127:08 - this
127:09 - um you know this is just a fun project i
127:11 - can fix it later if it doesn't work
127:13 - um but i like the idea of filtering it
127:14 - here um
127:16 - and then uh this is creating a new poll
127:21 - uh it's response is sending the votes
127:24 - this is doing something creates a new
127:26 - object votes which doesn't have the id
127:27 - property okay i like that
127:29 - um and i always forget i have to do
127:32 - i have to learn what this means it is
127:34 - taking the choice from the request
127:36 - params and making sure
127:38 - an existing entry exists with that
127:40 - choice
127:41 - got it okay uh thank you for that
127:44 - um and then in the client
127:47 - the check is no longer needed so that's
127:50 - just a comment there
127:51 - i'll comment that out okay great i like
127:53 - this it's much better
127:54 - for that filtering to happen here so i'm
127:57 - going to merge this
127:59 - i'm happy with this let's go ahead and
128:02 - merge this pull request
128:11 - all right now uh let's
128:15 - pull from the origin and let's
128:18 - [Music]
128:20 - run it and let's make sure our polling
128:24 - app is still working i still see the
128:27 - same results
128:28 - no errors on the server the question now
128:31 - is
128:32 - if i go to oh and this is the bot or
128:36 - something else let me hold on
128:37 - i have to remove my laptop for a second
128:40 - because i'm i'm gonna there's some other
128:42 - code examples open
128:44 - which are going to um
128:49 - they have a spot token in it which i
128:50 - don't want to show
128:52 - um now i should be able to go back to
128:54 - here and by the way i can also go over
128:56 - here how about that
128:57 - huh let's go over here for a second
129:00 - uh how's that for fancy uh
129:04 - let's open up the code
129:08 - i believe that if i go into database.db
129:12 - i think i want to clear this
129:16 - let me clear database.db
129:20 - uh oh it's already running
129:24 - [Music]
129:27 - let me go back to here great uh
129:33 - syntax error unexpected end of json
129:35 - input at count votes
129:37 - did i not add oh i think i think i have
129:40 - it like
129:41 - create new poll is just sort of like
129:44 - commented out right so right now my cr
129:46 - there is no i want to create a
129:48 - endpoint for creating a poll but right
129:51 - now i just have to like
129:52 - manually create a poll so let me do that
129:55 - just to see okay uh cannot access
129:59 - database okay well clearly this has to
130:00 - happen after
130:02 - [Music]
130:03 - okay so now i'm still getting that
130:07 - error um
130:12 - sketch.js line five
130:16 - what broke here vote count votes
130:19 - count votes oh because i hard-coded in
130:23 - the id
130:25 - boy there's a lot of problems a lot of
130:28 - things to fix that i
130:29 - maybe today is just like getting
130:30 - organized and adding some issues and
130:32 - letting other people
130:33 - do pull requests to fix individual
130:35 - issues but i suppose
130:37 - just to like let me put this id oh this
130:40 - is terrible uh
130:46 - i'll hard code that in there there we go
130:49 - okay we're back up and running
130:52 - um so yeah
130:56 - this leaves a lot to be desired but i i
130:58 - at least want to see if i can add the
130:59 - voting interface today before i go
131:01 - so i'm going to move but i'm glad i've
131:03 - merged these two pull requests
131:05 - this um all right refactor to utilize
131:08 - es6 destructuring and update a database
131:11 - call
131:11 - to use one less query on increment i
131:14 - like this idea
131:16 - like this idea oh no oh no
131:20 - oh no boom
131:24 - i need that sound effect uh do i have
131:27 - any of my scary music
131:28 - uh maybe it's this one
131:32 - oh hey dance battle we gotta resolve our
131:36 - conflicts
131:38 - [Music]
131:43 - all right let's let's take a look at
131:44 - this i i really appreciate this
131:46 - um love the stream yesterday so i
131:48 - figured i would improve on the rest
131:50 - endpoints to use destructuring for the
131:53 - request parameters
131:54 - and update the database call but i don't
131:57 - to increment on update rather than
131:59 - searching and then updating okay
132:00 - that i really wanted help with so let's
132:02 - take a look
132:04 - at the files changed first to understand
132:07 - so this we've also got
132:11 - ah this was already in somebody else's
132:13 - so
132:15 - uh that's probably where a conflict is
132:17 - um this
132:19 - is getting the is doing
132:22 - oh this is how you do the update thing
132:25 - await database update id
132:28 - increment choice by one return updated
132:31 - doc so this is what i was looking for
132:33 - i couldn't figure out how to get this
132:34 - like increment thing to work not that i
132:36 - fully understand this right now
132:37 - but that looks awesome and then response
132:40 - send await database find one
132:43 - the update function accepts a return
132:46 - updated docs
132:46 - so it still can be accomplished in one
132:48 - call let's look at this
132:53 - uh update options
132:57 - okay yeah return updated docs the return
132:59 - promise will resolve with an
133:01 - object or with an array of objects okay
133:05 - this is cool so let's look at the
133:08 - conflicts this looks like something i
133:09 - can accept
133:11 - um but i've gotta i've gotta deal with
133:12 - the conflicts
133:26 - [Music]
133:28 - time to resolve these conflicts
133:32 - uh these look the same
133:39 - i like the fact that i like this so
133:42 - let's i like also how this is written in
133:46 - one line though
133:48 - so let's grab this
133:50 - [Music]
133:52 - and put it in here and then
133:57 - we'll take this oh we'll take this
134:02 - these are the same
134:05 - so i need this so this is what i want
134:09 - now i want to get the port
134:11 - oh and i should move myself back oops to
134:14 - here
134:15 - i want to get the port um
134:20 - zoom in a little bit here i want to get
134:22 - the port from the environment variable i
134:24 - want to say it's running at local host
134:26 - port
134:27 - uh static and now here so this
134:30 - oh okay so here's my confusion
134:34 - can i still
134:40 - how do i integrate these two hmm
134:44 - oh boy what's up with the music at
134:46 - schwarzer
134:47 - so this is going to be hard because this
134:50 - does the incrementation in one call
134:53 - so definitely i want
134:58 - if no pull
135:02 - i don't know how to integrate this i'm
135:04 - gonna need some help
135:05 - i'm gonna need somebody else to resolve
135:07 - the merge conflicts
135:08 - so i'm actually not going to do this
135:11 - right now
135:12 - [Music]
135:15 - um can i'm just going to what i'm going
135:18 - to do
135:19 - is this
135:22 - um i'm not going to resolve these how do
135:24 - i get that i'm just going to go back
135:26 - and hit leave i'm also i'm going to just
135:29 - do a quick review
135:32 - so let's go here
135:33 - [Music]
135:35 - files changed let's do a quick review i
135:38 - just want to change this to
135:40 - um add a suggestion oh i can do
135:43 - multi-line suggestions now right
135:46 - uh cancel yes so i think if i do this if
135:49 - i do
135:50 - multi-line yep no
135:53 - there's a way to do a multi-line
135:54 - suggestion i don't remember how to do
135:56 - that
135:56 - this is so not important yes
136:00 - how do you do that does anybody know
136:08 - seen that ah there we go look there we
136:11 - go multi-line suggestion
136:15 - so i'm gonna suggest this change this to
136:18 - a one-liner
136:23 - [Music]
136:30 - and put this in here
136:39 - um oh
136:42 - oh this is so silly of me what am i
136:44 - doing this is a needle
136:46 - this um this doesn't need this doesn't
136:49 - need to be changed
136:50 - i'm changing the code to be on one line
136:53 - on very unnecessary here i'm not going
136:55 - to worry about that all right
136:58 - um
137:01 - um let's see here
137:04 - um so i'm gonna just do a review
137:07 - um so i'm just gonna comment this
137:10 - is terrific i really like the new
137:13 - database
137:14 - calls but um
137:18 - um but um there were some
137:21 - other changes related to
137:24 - um checking to validation
137:28 - um that need
137:32 - um resolution that need to be integrated
137:39 - with these changes can you help
137:43 - resolve the conflicts
137:46 - then i will merge okay
137:49 - so let me submit that and i assume
137:53 - that um
137:57 - drc is maybe not watching right now
138:00 - um but um if
138:04 - if you are you could do this uh live
138:06 - right now and i'll merge it but i think
138:08 - anything that i'm to implement right now
138:10 - is not going to affect this so i can
138:13 - move along
138:15 - um and then this can be merged later i
138:17 - mean i want to wait
138:18 - and kind of merge things during the live
138:20 - stream but this i might just go ahead
138:22 - and merge
138:22 - now that we've reviewed it before next
138:24 - saturday so
138:26 - let's look just there was one more pull
138:28 - request
138:30 - oh there's two oh simon
138:33 - pull request seven minutes ago
138:36 - okay um
138:41 - let's create a branch with simple sequel
138:43 - light 3 for consideration
138:46 - oh boy okay this is oh super interesting
138:48 - so i don't know how to make this
138:50 - decision
138:51 - but because i'm using this any db that
138:53 - is a
138:54 - kind of very hello world sort of style
138:57 - get started with the database system
138:59 - and this is using sql lite which is
139:02 - really really interesting to see
139:03 - this would be a major change right now i
139:05 - don't really know sequel light
139:07 - so i'm a little hesitant to just uh
139:10 - merge this in certainly also now it's
139:12 - going to conflict with all the other
139:14 - stuff
139:15 - but i do like the idea of having the
139:17 - database stuff in a
139:18 - separate file and then having various
139:21 - functions like create poll
139:23 - so let's make our first poll
139:26 - like related to what database system to
139:28 - use i don't know that could be something
139:29 - we could try
139:30 - um but i do like this i'm so i'm
139:33 - i'm interested in trying this
139:36 - [Music]
139:37 - let's i'll get a little further
139:43 - with functionality and design
139:46 - and we can swap out and we can consider
139:49 - swapping out the back end
139:52 - on a future stream if you want
139:56 - to uh if you want to keep this in sync
139:58 - if you want to keep
139:59 - this in sync with me okay
140:04 - so i'm gonna write that comment there so
140:07 - we'll leave this
140:08 - as to be considered uh for later uh we
140:11 - can check out
140:13 - uh simon's pull request
140:19 - you create an interface but for now you
140:22 - can create a piece of software called
140:24 - insomnia
140:25 - to make post requests that's interesting
140:30 - so you're oh interesting you're changing
140:33 - it into a post
140:36 - to uh receive the votes so i that thank
140:39 - you for that i think i'm gonna
140:40 - leave it as is because i do i do want
140:44 - to build my own interface um and i think
140:46 - it'll be
140:47 - a little simpler with just the voting to
140:48 - keep it with the get requests
140:50 - but i do appreciate this and i will take
140:52 - a look at it more
140:53 - late later if we want to um and
140:55 - hacktoberfest opt-in
140:57 - ah there's been a recent update where
140:59 - individuals have voluntary
141:00 - right so i need to add a topic that's
141:03 - just hacktoberfest
141:05 - great so i did that so this is now done
141:08 - this is now done we can close
141:12 - this issue and go through the issues
141:13 - real quick
141:15 - um um
141:19 - there there has been progress
141:22 - but happy for more design uh
141:26 - ideas uh
141:30 - one limitation is keep the background
141:33 - green for chroma keying
141:37 - so i'll just note this here so this can
141:40 - stay
141:40 - open um back to issues
141:44 - glitch info uh how do i push code
141:48 - so i'll look at this way i'm not i
141:50 - decided not to go with the sort of like
141:52 - syncing it with glitch but that's useful
141:54 - information i'll come back to that
141:56 - and then this was the database
141:57 - discussion um
141:59 - where we had some nice suggestions here
142:01 - any db is fine to use
142:04 - oh i like this
142:07 - so um i definitely want
142:11 - uh i definitely like the idea of having
142:12 - the pole object be more sophisticated
142:15 - so let's uh thumbs this up
142:20 - um oh and simon made
142:24 - so this i would love if one if there's
142:25 - like a database system that one of you
142:27 - is making
142:28 - that's just very basic and you're gonna
142:30 - maintain it that's definitely something
142:31 - we could use
142:32 - so that's great thanks for sharing that
142:35 - um where
142:36 - and then sequel light might be a good
142:38 - option and crunchy pie
142:40 - uh added that sql light interface so
142:43 - this
142:44 - is definitely a heart and this is
142:46 - definitely also a heart
142:48 - and i'm just going to reply to dj pamson
142:52 - um
142:56 - i don't know why i can't mention dj
142:58 - pamson here but i

143:40 - um paw is insomnia if you're on mac
143:45 - okay postman is greater than insomnia
143:48 - all of you are
143:48 - giving me interesting things no let's
143:50 - make the voting interface
143:53 - so let's do that now so um
143:59 - this is under public there's index.html
144:05 - so i don't know to what extent i want to
144:07 - make this into like
144:08 - a website with multiple let's just put
144:12 - the voting
144:13 - on this right now so
144:16 - how do you make what do i want to make
144:17 - radio buttons is that a thing
144:20 - how do you do that radio
144:24 - buttons uh
144:30 - oh and there's that's in p5 there is a
144:32 - p5 thing for it
144:35 - uh create radio maybe i'll just do that
144:38 - create radio
144:42 - um so let's try this
144:45 - [Music]
144:48 - so what if i just in my p5 code
144:53 - call this is tarot again once again uh
144:56 - things that need to be done
144:57 - to do uh you know
145:00 - this page should be for a specific poll
145:04 - [Music]
145:07 - and i should make these separate issues
145:08 - and another to do is
145:10 - to do create a poll creation page
145:15 - uh another to do
145:19 - is uh
145:23 - like different pages for voting
145:28 - oh yeah i definitely want different
145:29 - voting viewing
145:32 - and uh poll creation like that i might
145:35 - want
145:36 - at some point but just for simple
145:39 - simpleness right now um
145:42 - a b c
145:47 - and d let's see
145:50 - what this gets me
145:55 - okay why is it all the way down there
145:59 - because there's a canvas i don't need
146:01 - the canvas anymore
146:03 - well i'm not using the canvas for
146:04 - anything am i
146:06 - [Music]
146:08 - huh i'm so confused
146:13 - like because is this oh this is canvas
146:16 - but it doesn't need to be hold on let's
146:18 - not let's just do this for a second
146:20 - [Music]
146:21 - just so i can see aha i see
146:25 - so let's uh
146:26 - [Music]
146:28 - just do this there we go that's better
146:32 - again there's no reason for me to use
146:34 - canvas for the visualization but
146:36 - why not um all right so let's uh
146:40 - and why is this like in this weird
146:44 - thing like that but i'll take it
146:47 - and then i want to make a button
146:53 - so let's make a vote button
146:58 - and a vote equals create button
147:02 - vote
147:06 - and then vote
147:09 - vote button submit mouse pressed
147:14 - submit vote okay
147:18 - submit vote
147:21 - [Music]
147:23 - and then i need a function
147:27 - called submit vote
147:31 - which let me just console log the radio
147:36 - is it choice
147:39 - i don't know is that like a property of
147:40 - the p5 radio object
147:42 - radio button object let's look text
147:46 - radio.value okay radio.value
147:51 - um and so
147:54 - uh let's see how let's see what this
147:56 - does
147:59 - [Music]
148:01 - all right a d okay we're
148:05 - this is looking good b all right now
148:07 - we've got a voting interface
148:09 - this is amazing uh oops
148:15 - and now i want to not just do that but
148:18 - submit to the server
148:22 - so vote poll id choice that's what i
148:25 - want
148:26 - to call and let's
148:30 - make
148:31 - [Music]
148:33 - this function
148:37 - uh submit vote let's make this an async
148:41 - function so i can say uh
148:44 - let response equal fetch
148:48 - and then i just going to what am i going
148:50 - to
148:51 - [Music]
148:52 - um vote
148:55 - poll id choice and once again i'm card
148:59 - coding in
149:00 - the poll id
149:02 - [Music]
149:06 - uh select poll id somehow
149:10 - uh vote
149:15 - poll id and then
149:18 - radio dot value
149:23 - and maybe i should put that into a
149:25 - variable
149:25 - [Music]
149:28 - and i'm i'm yeah you guys can fix my es6
149:31 - whatever
149:32 - later choice equals radio dot
149:36 - value
149:36 - [Music]
149:40 - um all we need is
149:43 - radio go go radio gaga
149:47 - and then i can put choice in here okay
149:49 - then
149:50 - um let's
149:54 - uh let uh
149:58 - i want to just what is it what do i send
150:00 - back let us
150:02 - i don't know status equals response dot
150:05 - json
150:06 - oh wait oh and this has to be a weight
150:09 - i don't want these parentheses here i
150:11 - don't need that
150:14 - and then console dot log
150:17 - status all right let's see how this goes
150:20 - [Music]
150:23 - whoa why did i get so many there
150:28 - oh is it like because it's like
150:30 - normalizing it oh it's normalizing it
150:34 - so i don't know what i feel about the
150:36 - emojis
150:37 - not a lot of detail there
150:41 - can i give myself more width like
150:44 - um i like the emojis but
150:47 - the normalizing is a little bit uh
150:49 - suspect
150:51 - um width divided by
150:55 - 10 width is
150:59 - max vote 100 so how much space do i have
151:03 - 400 let's say i think i have 300
151:05 - probably
151:07 - so whoa
151:10 - so five
151:14 - i don't have let's um
151:17 - let's make that a little bit less
151:23 - [Music]
151:25 - there we go a little bit more can i fit
151:28 - more
151:29 - there we go
151:33 - okay now here we are voting
151:38 - oh nothing is selected so if the value i
151:41 - you have i don't think i should like
151:43 - have something selected by default
151:45 - that's putting the thumb on the scale
151:47 - too much but
151:49 - i should not submit it
151:52 - as long as like as long as there is a
151:55 - choice
151:59 - uh you can do this otherwise
152:02 - [Music]
152:05 - no choice selected
152:14 - what's going on here
152:15 - [Music]
152:17 - wait what happened to my auto format on
152:19 - save
152:20 - did i like turn that off
152:23 - hold on uh format
152:27 - no format file on save
152:31 - do i have like a syntax error
152:34 - [Music]
152:37 - why is it not formatting on save does
152:40 - anybody know
152:41 - i won't worry about that
152:45 - okay uh how's everything going
152:49 - um okay
152:53 - let's see here refresh
153:01 - and now what if i refresh and don't no
153:03 - choice selected okay
153:05 - and if i click a for quite a bit
153:08 - a goes up all right this is working the
153:11 - live
153:11 - poll is happening
153:14 - uh one thing i well all right um now
153:19 - uh let's create a branch here for what
153:21 - we're doing
153:22 - get branch uh whoops
153:26 - get branch uh crude interface
153:30 - get checkout crude interface
153:34 - uh
153:40 - all right and let's if anybody wants to
153:43 - check this out
153:44 - i'm sending it up to github with this
153:45 - crude interface
153:47 - and now i think i want to clear
153:50 - i think i need some admin tool way
153:53 - of clearing the database oh i forgot
153:57 - about
153:58 - how it doesn't how uh
154:01 - any db works but i think
154:05 - couldn't i do something like if i just
154:07 - delete it
154:08 - in the server like if it creates the
154:14 - database
154:16 - create new poll like couldn't oh no but
154:19 - then i don't have the id
154:21 - all right whatever i'm just gonna very
154:23 - crudely i'm gonna do a horrible thing
154:26 - which is um manually edit the database
154:32 - [Music]
154:34 - and set these all to be zeros
154:37 - [Music]
154:40 - so obviously i want to well let's make a
154:43 - real let's make a real poll
154:46 - and i should also
154:49 - these these votes the options should
154:52 - come from the names in the poll
154:54 - all right people will pull request that
154:56 - stuff to me i can't do it right now
154:58 - so what should the poll be i need some
155:01 - suggestions as a force compression
155:03 - what's the function for the force
155:04 - compression i can call
155:07 - i should be scaled only after a number
155:09 - of votes i agree except for the fact
155:11 - that as soon as i release this the
155:12 - number of votes are gonna like go like
155:14 - crazy
155:15 - so that's a good feature somebody can
155:16 - submit a pull request for that
155:19 - um but um
155:27 - let's run the server
155:28 - [Music]
155:30 - and let's refresh
155:33 - and let's vote there we go okay so it's
155:36 - still working
155:38 - um what should the poll be i mean
155:42 - with four options
155:49 - i mean i was sort of curious like we
155:51 - could say
155:53 - we could do something about database
155:55 - [Music]
155:56 - like should i replace the database
155:59 - [Music]
156:05 - i mean this is not going to be
156:06 - scientific also i'm not
156:08 - i'm not like uh storing anybody's ip
156:10 - address or
156:12 - anything to like reduce to like enforce
156:15 - single voting
156:17 - so i know i'll do um we'll do a poll
156:21 - a non-scientific poll um i'm gonna go
156:24 - jogging today
156:25 - should i do my two mile route
156:29 - my 2.5 mile route
156:31 - [Music]
156:33 - my three mile route for my four mile
156:37 - route these are my typical routes that i
156:39 - do
156:41 - so you can vote which route you think i
156:43 - do probably d is gonna win everyone's
156:45 - gonna want me to go for a longer jog
156:46 - right
156:47 - this is kind of ridiculous but this is
156:50 - the bowl that we're gonna do
156:51 - so i need to run ngrok i forgot how to
156:55 - do this do i have it

162:20 - membership integration and here is your
162:22 - random number
162:25 - 91 340 your very own personal random
162:28 - number ah
162:29 - let's get a little further in the book
162:32 - why not
162:34 - while people are voting
162:38 - where were we
162:41 - i need somebody remember someone can
162:43 - create the web application
162:45 - that tracks where i am in the random
162:48 - number book
162:54 - but i remember where i was i was like uh
162:57 - row one column nine so i'm starting off
163:00 - of row two
163:02 - eight thousand four hundred and twenty

165:14 - all right everyone um
165:17 - so where did i what was the number i
165:18 - just read 34 072 so i have finished
165:22 - on row five column
165:25 - zero one two
165:29 - so i'm on row five column three row five
165:33 - column three how am i gonna remember
165:35 - that who's making me the thing
165:37 - that tells me what to read on p
165:40 - row five column three that's where i
165:42 - need to pick up next time on the coding
165:44 - train
165:44 - um let's uh
165:49 - finish the day by solving this uh ruby's
165:51 - cube
165:54 - um
165:56 - i know how i can what that's what i can
165:58 - use this camera for
166:00 - [Music]
166:06 - let's try this for a second
166:10 - to figure out a good use for this camera
166:13 - i plug it in here
166:16 - and i say oh boy what's going on okay
166:19 - uh if i go new
166:23 - video capture device um do i have this
166:26 - logitech
166:27 - 2 is that it logitech 2
166:32 - logitech 2 properties
166:37 - uh game capture nope
166:41 - uh whoops um
166:46 - there we go
166:50 - uh okay it's pointed at the ceiling
166:55 - so now i have my
166:58 - rubik's cube here put it up here
167:03 - okay um
167:08 - i really should just stop like i was in
167:10 - the middle of solving this a few weeks
167:11 - ago
167:13 - uh let's see where is the piece that i
167:15 - need
167:16 - it's so weird what's going on oh it's in
167:18 - the wrong place oh
167:27 - i guess looking at it from the bottom is
167:28 - like really the wrong way to look at me
167:30 - solving the rubik's cube
167:34 - let's try looking at it from well i'm
167:37 - really going off my rocker here
167:44 - oh boy what just happened what happened
167:48 - oh here i am uh camera only that what
167:51 - did i hit
167:54 - [Music]
167:56 - there we go oh you're seeing my legs and
167:58 - the mess
168:00 - oh no wait ah stop
168:06 - is this better okay here we go
168:18 - [Music]
168:20 - 80s music is appropriate this is the
168:23 - last thing i'm going to do
168:24 - to finish off the day
168:32 - [Music]
168:45 - two layers done
168:58 - [Music]
169:10 - oh
169:12 - oh there we go
169:16 - top side two layers
169:22 - what do i do here i forgot
169:27 - completely forgotten
169:34 - oh my god i've completely forgotten the
169:35 - algorithm for this last part
169:44 - [Music]
169:52 - so
169:57 - [Music]
170:03 - i forgot how to solve the ruby tube
170:04 - everybody it's been so long
170:09 - oh i completely messed it up
170:22 - that was sad plus my camera is like
170:26 - well this is what i need to do there we
170:28 - go
170:31 - okay we're gonna solve this people
170:36 - it's been so long since i solved one of
170:38 - these
170:42 - why am i getting myself into this this
170:43 - is really sort of pointless
170:50 - oh you can't even see now that'll hold
170:53 - it lower
171:09 - how much i messed it up
171:25 - okay oh
171:39 - amount of practice people
171:43 - i really have to go i don't know why i'm
171:45 - doing this right now
171:48 - i was like waiting for the poll to
171:49 - finish
171:52 - and i thought i'll do this real quick um
172:03 - how's it going oh is there a cat this
172:05 - will be much more interesting let me
172:06 - just show the cat
172:10 - you want to bring me a cat
172:11 - [Music]
172:13 - okay here's the cat
172:16 - we'll solve the rubik's cube later all
172:18 - right everybody
172:20 - uh thank you for tuning in
172:25 - uh it's time for me to go what's
172:27 - happening today what's happening this
172:28 - afternoon
172:30 - but i should stop live streaming right
172:32 - yeah okay
172:33 - all right time to go see you later greta
172:37 - she does not want to be with me um
172:40 - i will uh next week i will solve the
172:43 - rubik's cube
172:45 - um thanks everyone for tuning in uh play
172:48 - this
172:48 - uh goodbye song um i hope you enjoyed

Cleaned transcript:

good morning check one two check one two let me pause the music and how's my audio there is a fan blowing which i might turn off but it'll be a little bit of noise because of that but let me know how the audio is going and see you all in a minute me good morning oh my head is cut off uh hello my watch band matches my hat and that's what i have to say to you today on this side project saturday on the coding train i hope everyone's doing well we reach over here and grab this well i'm awake it is a saturday it is a beautiful day outside and i'm here in the attic in brooklyn new york to talk to you the people the passengers of the train about code and other types of things and update on the the what's the news today in creative coding is there any perhaps any wait a second this just in um the coding train news desk where are my papers to russell uh i got nothing um i do have some new videos coming out soon on the coding train i said this one last week a video on object detection using the ml5.js library that will be coming out as well as three new uh videos uh tutorials about how to make your own discord bot i just want to make a little plug here as i begin uh about the coding train discord first of all while i'm here let me also thank the sponsor of today's coding train brilliant uh brilliant is a interactive website for learning and boy do they have a lot of stuff there that's good for ideas for creative coding and a lot of related content to the coding train so check out um brilliant uh the website brilliant.org um sign up for an account for free at brilliant.org codingtrain and if you want to unlock all the premium content all the courses everything there's a lot you can do for free but all the premium stuff um if you use that you'll get a 20 off uh coupon on a premium subscription for at least the first 200 people who sign up all right what i wanted to mention about the discord um is that i am running a bot the choo choo bot and if i type in the words choo choo right here it's going to reply to me ding oops we could try another one oh and it gave me some nice emojis so um that's coming soon i'm um hoping to launch a brand new series a sequence set of tutorials about how to make your own discord bot um in the coding train discord server itself um there is the disk stream bot which i encourage you to check out maybe somebody who's watching can put the website for disstream chat which is a chat manager tool for live streaming that's some coding trained viewers have put together and you can support their patreon i'm planning some possible ideas to use that in a future live stream so i will come back to that but i do want to plug the discord because i am really trying to build the discord community um i find it just to be such a uh a great place for getting help on your code discussion around code for me to engage with the community oh oh mini jimmy in a second i'm in the wrong place mini jimmy welcome to being a passenger on the coding train today is october 10th that's 10 10 20 20 an auspicious day with a bunch of numbers in it that all add up and relate to each other and work very well with our decimal system but you as a member of the coding train now new member have won your very own random number and it is wait someone's keeping track of this right is there by the way um hiring new position available for the coding train random number keeper kind of like gamekeeper or um other sorts of various keeper like positions uh 73 935 mini jimmy minnie jimmy i recognize your name oh my goodness welcome ah darsh bhutan you are a brand new member of the cody train which means that at some point in the future you might receive in the mail some stickers yes that's right stickers there are pieces of paper that are sticky on the back and you will put them onto something like maybe your laptop or your new poster with your own random number on it which is 37 hundred and thirty one and also i should mention you know there's a lot of stuff for everybody on the discord i don't i don't really love the idea of exclusive spaces but um in the discord um there are some uh channels for um coding trained members where we have a few extra things and um i do often uh live stream for members when i'm recording a tutorial uh as well so if you want to tune in to some of the behind the scenes coding stream stuff uh you can join as a member um but one of the things that i've been wanting to get is discord partnership status um i don't know why i want that i just want it because it's a thing you can have and i don't have it uh but i've applied a bunch of times and most recently i looked and one of the thresholds i don't meet uh the coding train discord does not meet is first week member retention so i don't know if that means just like somebody signs up i don't think it's how many people keep their account after they signed up it must be how many people return back to the discord the coding trained discord and you have to be above 20 and currently the last week my number was around 16 so if there's any new folks here i'm going to press my discord button which will put a link to the invite to the discord in the chat um please join and uh then stay for a week then you can go then you could go then you could go but a week come back every day for a week decide if you like it and then you can go lots of fun stuff happening in the discord it's a great place to share your work um chat with fellow community members i would like to mention what's very important a little bit confusing is if and when you join there is the readme channel which has the code of conduct and lots of extra information about the different roles and rules and how things work and then you will not have access to the coding train uh discord server uh all the rest of the channels until you react with an emoji i'm like pointing as if i have much more space to point but i only can point to here unless you react with an emoji to the code of contact itself to indicate that you've read it don't just react read it okay there we go here we are oh it's so nice to be with you all what am i gonna do today well one of the things i like to begin with is community contributions yes right here on the coding train you as a watcher of the coding train can make your own creative code projects and share them with the community and sometimes i'll spin a wheel to pick your project and feature it right here on saturday's live stream so um boy this is really loud in my ear i don't know how loud it is for all of you uh so let's see let me find the wheel i'm gonna go over here to uh issues this is how i find the wheel we all know i can't possibly use something like a bookmark or a napkin or some way i've just gotta find the issue that's open here that says is it not in the topics oh it's in the website repo oh my god here we go going to the website repo oh i should talk about hacktoberfest oh so by the way um if hacktoberfest is something that you're interested in participating please read this issue here we are a github repo that is participating in oktoberfest because of a lot of the spam problems with hacktoberfest um you now as a an open source project have to opt into it and i really like to participate in these things that welcome new people into open source even though it caught there's a bit of uh extra layers of work involved in sort of managing what what is spam um um i think it's worth it um and so what is hacktoberfest you're asking i it's i think it's put on by digitalocean not a sponsor but hey i'm here digitalocean i used you i have some droplets i run my bots on your droplets how many people can say that to you with love um so uh and i believe if you uh i don't don't quote me on this i'm not an official representative but i believe if you get four poll requests accepted into open source projects that are participating they will send you a tshirt or plant a tree um and it's a nice thing to participate in but i would really encourage you to read this um github issue uh thank you to violet craze who uh put this together and other contributors who added it who um um and you can see here here are all the here are a lot of the sort of like probably most of these are some of this sort of more spammy and they're not necessarily spam and then with malicious intent just people are trying we we can't accept your pull request really if it's just like changing one word or kind of messing up the site in some other way but the the best thing for you to do is make a community contribution and if i go over here to contribute and go to this community contribution guide you can find out more so let's get to that wheel um if i could just find it oh right issues uh we'll link there it is thank you to gypsy dangerous for putting together this wheel and i am now going to spin that wheel all right what are we going to see today everybody number ooh 13 13 whoo spooky by the way this might be the first year that i actually do a halloween special because halloween is on a saturday october 31st i'm just gonna be at home because hey we're all staying at home these days my costume will be a masked person i don't know maybe i'll have something else um oh we'll do something fun for halloween maybe remind me about that manta gets closer uh 13 let's see remove and view selected ah we have selected koji version oh this is going to be fun so this is based on it would seem the um angry birds coding challenge where i use mater.js which is a physics library to create uh an uh sort of like simplified version of an angry birds game in p5.js um then i'm going to go here and click on it so i i don't i it seems like it's probably unlikely just through the law of probabilities that um dissolve dissolvement is not here in the chat but if you happen to believe please hit me with some siren emojis so i can see that you're here and um maybe ask you some questions about your project so let's go here angry birds oh okay fun angry birds with koji oh wait koji must be some kind of like other live library or create interactive posts so with koji i do not know what this is we build software that evolves hey wait a second i'm now having a memory i think i have some emails and i was supposed to have a call with the folks from koji um let's look at about um uh uh i i have a memory of having a bunch of emails about this and talking with them i'm trying to see if i can recognize a name who knows or maybe i'm just imagining it okay but anyway this was made with koji let's try playing it oh and i'm in the way here we go i think i can get all three i'm gonna try to get all three here we go do i get it back do i get another try i want another try please no i just have to refresh the page all right here we go i think maybe if i go for the bottom one the top two will fall over all right here we go i'm so bad at this okay regret all right i'm this is this time when you get it okay can't can't defeat me angry dot here we go yes sort of kind of all right that was awesome um great so this looks to me like it's pretty much identical to the actual coding challenge itself but ported into a different environment which i always love to see and that is in particular something quite great for the community um and if you want to learn more about this angry birds coding challenge and see other i i assume it will sort of come up uh here is the first link um so we can see there there are actually only two only two community contributions to the angry birds coding challenge that's kind of a surprise i would have thought that would be a more popular one oh you versus texas college football version okay i i have my sports fandom but it is not college football so i know nothing about this uh but i'm kind of curious to see so this is oh you and that must that's that like texas longhorns is that what they're called something like that all right this is great uh that's fun to see um you know the sort of theming it with uh some some a particular i can't seem to hit anything uh something you're passionate or excited about come on let me at least get a couple of these oh you you're not doing very well there we go awesome uh all right let's go back to our wheel see if we can get another one here everybody and swift potato in the chat is saying um i love to port these to vanilla javascript and that's great and that's that's particularly wonderful because one of the requests that i get most often in the comments is why do you use people i don't know why i'm imitating the voice of a youtube here's my voice of youtube commenter why don't you use p5js but really you're all wonderful nice people you're just asking friendly questions like why don't why do you oh wait no no that's not the end of the question it's uh i wish you would uh do your tutorials in vanilla javascript i wish you wouldn't use frameworks you know that's just i get it sometimes it feels um there's a reason for wanting to sort of learn from the sort of like base default api javascript browser api but i am a person who really likes to use frameworks and use them for particular reasons and p5.js i could go on and on about lots of reasons why i choose to use it but um it's wonderful when people from the community can can contribute a version that helps me help me and others see ah these are other ways to look at the same problem or we can learn more about how p5.js works by looking underneath the hood at vanilla or native javascript all right number 53 is um oh gram scan algorithm using a generator function oh this is going to make simon tiger simon tiger's gonna is watching is gonna be so happy simon has been asking me to do a video tutorial on generator functions and use generator function guess what i have something to admit to you i i kind of loosely maybe understand the concept of generator function but i i couldn't you you could like come up here and be like here's my suitcase full of a million dollars if you can read generator function right now it's yours i don't think i'd be getting that suitcase any time soon so it's something that i really should look into i have been wanting to do more just quick new features in javascript videos um and so maybe that's something that could go add to a side project saturday to kind of learn generator functions um but let's take a look at the original challenge uh which was the gift wrapping um challenge this was one day back of days days in more innocent times before i i mean maybe this is in 2020 but if it was it was much earlier in 2020 when i thought i was going to make a lot of computational geometry coding challenges i would still like to do that um and i did a sort of like a first start with this gift wrapping challenge which is finding the uh convex hull or the contours around an enclosed set of dots um and let's take a look let's just see what the example looks like like what my example looks like i'm not logged in here we can see this is animating this particular algorithm that's finding it's called the gift wrapping algorithm and i should log in by the way let me just do that so that that is done and then let's go back here and see a gram scan algorithm cool so now i'm trying to remember i remember researching this and i um and and looking at gram scan and looking at gift wrapping and then there were some other particular algorithms i can't i don't recall um and i should let this finish sorry wonderful so first of all what one thing that i particularly i have an affinity for that i really love are uh projects that animate the process of an algorithm and this is actually quite hard to do right it's typically at least in my experience much easier to implement an algorithm and show the final result which is generally what you need you want to use an algorithm to achieve a particular result but for artistic purposes for educational purposes it's often worth sort of peeling back and and and peeling the layers of the onions so to speak and dividing them into different layers of the onion so that you can watch one layer of the onion at a time in an animation is this metaphor working probably not but um this is something that i really like to do to watch the process of an algorithm unfold for um all sorts of various reasons so i appreciate seeing that with this um example um and let me look up because i want to um remind myself about this algorithm so maybe somebody can tell me this is a method of finding a convex whole of a finite set of points we can see it animating right over here the time complexity is o and long n oh oh i feel like i should go get my ukulele because i feel like we should write a song about o n log n it just it just yells out to me like i'm i'm a song it's named after ronald graham who published the original algorithm in 1972 the year before i was born thank you very much yes yes i know i know i'm old although really it's all time is relative um and it uses a stack to detect and remove concavities in the boundary efficiency so this is different than what i did right gift wrapping algorithm what i did was the gift wrapping algorithm which was published in 1973 all right tate jarvis r.a jarvis get with it graham scan 1972 year ahead of you 1973 the year that i was born um and it has o and h time complexity so is that where n is the number of points and h is the number of uh wait which is which is faster n log n or n h i would assume n log n is faster right but um these are two different algorithms so um that's great to see what are some other convex hole algorithms that you could do if they don't uh um algorithms uh convex whole algorithms let's see if we've got a list here uh is there a gram scan gram scan um gift wrapping jarvis march hey wait a second yeah uh gift wrapping o n h gram scan o n log n n log n is faster everybody's saying the chat thank you for confirming that for me i could have done that math in my head but i'm really concentrating on putting words next to each other coming out of my mouth to speak to you you know i'm just a person in a room here and i've got to keep talking or else there's dead air oh you know i need a cricket or a tumbleweed sound effect somebody get on that simon's sending me um simon sending me a generator function card okay let's explore this i want to understand a little bit let's try let's explore generator functions a little bit right now um because that is if i go back to where was i where is my using a generator function so let's look at the code um so one thing this is totally fine i prefer people when they share it to share the um in the p5 web editor not the present view the full view it's kind of silly and you certainly don't have to but that way um if i'm in this view i can quickly get to well where is it oh i think i'm my browser is just off that's weird usually there's oh this is a bug somebody should uh file this for the p5 web editor um in the high contrast view the link in the full view high contrast full view the link to the source code is like black characters on very dark gray so it's really hard to see but i can click there and now i see the code so where is the gem so this is what it means to have a generator function if you put a star this i know if you put a star you get that is a generator function and and then you use this term yield so these are the new things let's let's make my own sketch by the way if you've wondered what side project saturday is it's just me here thinking of random things to do with no logic to them whatsoever although i do have two things on my agenda today that i really do want to get to uh which just to say is one is the live poll continuing the live poll application and two is i want to um augment my object detection example to have some debouncing in it i'll talk about what that means because i want to show that in the video tutorial that is still being put together okay but um generator function ardia said okay boomer which i can only assume is referring to me uh i got one thing to say to you forget the mustard it's karate time what was i saying also we are the city um i have a proclamation i've got some inside jokes that none of you know about and i'm just waiting for the crossover to eventually happen which probably would be a very bad idea so uh all right generator function so if i write a function and i put a star next to it and i said call it choo choo and then i can say something like yield 10 i have no idea what i'm doing here i mean i will look up what a generator function is and i'm sure simon will send me lots more messages explaining it i'm going to write now choo choo can you all see this code um let me move it over a tiny bit and um make it a little bit bigger and let's say console let val equals choo choo console.log now let's just see constructor object so i got an object with nothing admit so i guess a constructor of a generator function gives me back an object yield 10 oh okay okay okay i see i see val equals choo choo then if i say console.log val.next i'm getting an object with the value of 10 so i can do this i got 10. now if i say yield and today is 10 10 20 20. so let's do that 10 10 20 20. if i do this twice i get this is me like sequencing so a generator function is this is like a return value but i can sequence the return values so could i do something weird like this i mean maybe this is not at all how you would ever use a generator function but can i say something like i times 10 and then oh yeah and then and then if i had the draw loop oh i see why you might want to use this with animation because now i can say background val.next.value no all right i'll just say choo choo dot next dot value and then can i give it an argument well i mean that's it and then i can just say i is less than 255 yield i what happens when i get to the end so this should if i'm right show me i've cr i've just written i see why you would use a generator function this is making sense to me now if i have an algorithm that i want to animate but i don't want to have to figure out how to sequence the different steps of the algorithm i can just yield something from the algorithm itself and then ask sort of and ask for uh whatever it's yielding one bit at a time can i put other code after this well we'll find let's see if this works so this should slowly animate to from black to white i would think it's not really working is it hmm i think i did something wrong oh because i made a new i have to have i'm making a new generator each time so it's always starting with zero got it a generator uh i'm this is creating an object that is a generator object so i still need to have something like i would say like um i'll call this looper and i mean the variable names are not making any sense looper equals choo choo and i guess i don't need to like do that in setup i could probably do but i'm just gonna and then i would say looper.next.value right i can't remake the generator object every time through draw because every time then it's gonna give me a zero let's see if this works i'm just turning off my camera for a second because i have to get a tissue oh i i have a new video tutorial that i definitely want to make at some point um whoops okay so that worked but i definitely got an error at a certain point because object arguments is not a valid color so at some point it gives when it gets to the end of the loop what does it return undefined there's no nothing more to yield what did it return undefined so i guess what i would say is uh if b and i probably could say something like while does this a thing you can do while b equals no like this it doesn't like this expected a conditional expression while how do i make this while b is this something you do i guess we'll be able to i don't know i don't know how to do this in one i mean i could certainly say like if b uh and i can do this this would solve the problem for me but this isn't particularly elegant somebody in the chat will tell me a more elegant way of doing this but look at that oh while it has a done field the next has a done or but if uh double equals i think yeah no i know double equals but it won't do the assignment um so someone's telling me that i can say something like like if looper is not done oh oh oh maybe i can say i'm trying to figure out how i say this while true i know uh while result oh oh the looper.next not while though i want to do an if yeah i don't know an if not a while the whole point of this is i'm doing them one at a time in draw and the generator function is the thing that's looping really um yeah um anyway i'm happy with i don't mind having an extra if statement in there i'm just i'm just trying to figure add while true yield 255. oh that's interesting um but that this seems like a bad idea is this actually like that like it seems like such a bad idea is this a time when an infinite loop is okay let me just save this as exploring because is it really not is it building up a big stack first and then peeling them like does it run all this first and then it gives me the values one at a time or does it actually somehow only step through this each time i call next that would be the question looper.next.done i know but um all right so i guess i could say if looper but i don't so i guess i could say something like next equals looper.next if next is not done is this like sort of more proper now uh background next dot value i feel like the lighting in here just changed did somebody have hacked my network all right um i'm gonna take this out for a second here are you looking for this okay here you go this gloria pickle all right don't knock that over okay um it's lazy so it pauses the code every time it gets to a yield statement imagine the generator to have user input it doesn't build it calculates one at a time so marcos and simon and kobe are all telling me this so this is actually totally legitimate um and my um this is the kind this is the time of season when my allergies kick in time of year and it's a lot of anxiety around any small symptoms but i think i'm fine a little runny nose is i can i can tolerate okay wait i just want to see let's run this code i want to move on in a second but this was super interesting to do if next.done is not a function it's a property no unexpected token oh whoops we need a parenthesis there all right this looks good excellent and now what everybody's telling me is this is actually okay for me to say oh i'm scared i'm scared let's play this sound we're gonna write it in for the loop we're gonna run it and we're gonna like it looking good i can even comment this is now irrelevant because it will do that forever let's see if we get an error message now it's never going to be done generator functions all right so i i think there's a lot more that i could do with this um and simon writes the way i normally use a generator function is if i have code that i want to pause at some point then i put that code in a generator function and i put a yield statement every time i want to pause it that's interesting um and kobe writes imagine the generator to have user input so um this is super helpful okay so um i i think that i this is actually terrific um and what i like about this is one of the things i was worried about with generator functions i thought oh maybe i shouldn't really use that with animation because i don't like to have two asynchronous threads going on and one is doing the drawing and i don't know if the value is updating in the right order but this is not a separate asynchronous thread really this is about me being able to write some code that i can sort of like pause and step through almost like a debugger like go to the next line go to the next line um so and then draw can just always call next and animate oh this is amazing this is going to change my life this is a lifechanging moment on the coding train this is historic are you all here for this oh my god does this exist in like java like is there an equivalent uh java generator function i mean i don't generate a function could mean so many different things generator function equivalent in java iterator that is a generator a thing in python is that where it comes from yield yeah uh looks like there's a stack overflow post i'll have to look into this a little more but once again you know the beauty and wonder of javascript in its sort of like simplicity of syntax which can lead you very astray admittedly as soon as you start to look at it in java it's kind of like oh my god i feel a little sick even though i do i love i need my love sound effect for i love java can someone write a little i love java i like coffee i like tea i like the java jive and it loves me that was pathetic and really out of tune and not melody python has it says um says the chat uh ruby two says uh essay mcqueen mcquenzy um yeah all right um we've gotta move on we're almost at the middle of the live stream we've got 20 minutes till the middle of the live stream where i'll take a break um thank you for uh those two community contributions i would like to look at more i will i'm going to save this code um and if i can remember and someone will help remind me i want to make sure i add this to the description for this video it's a little kind of generator example um all right let's um let's take a moment to relax and read some random numbers no no no no i just got to delete my old lullaby sound all right good morning everyone we've been here on the coding train smooth ride not so bumpy for about 40 minutes what have i done i'm not really sure i can barely remember anything but i would like to read some random numbers helps me wake up in the morning helps me think about what i want to code today and here we are uh you know what hey let's start on page one eventually we'll get through this whole book i'm gonna this is this is a this is another historic moment i'm gonna bookmark where we are i'm gonna read this whole book to you someone will later then edit it all together it's gonna be wonderful page one line one it's actually line zero ten thousand ninety seven thirty two thousand five hundred and thirty three seventy six thousand five hundred and twenty thirteen thousand five hundred and eighty six thirty four thousand six hundred and seventy three fifty four thousand eight hundred and seventy six eighty thousand nine hundred and fifty nine nine thousand one hundred and seventeen oh there's a minute left of this song thirty nine thousand two hundred and ninety two by the way what i love about doing this is i have right on my dashboard concurrent viewers and i just want to i assume that as soon as i start this the viewers are just going to go down and down and down 74 945 all of you watching from all around the world where it's night time and you're saying good night bishwest this is oddly soothing thirty seven thousand five hundred and forty two four thousand eight hundred and five sixty four thousand eight hundred and ninety four seventy four thousand two hundred and ninety six twenty four thousand eight hundred and five twenty four thousand and thirty seven twenty thousand six hundred and thirty six ten thousand four hundred and two eight hundred and twenty two ninety one thousand six hundred and sixty five and that was random number asmr with your host daniel shiffman on a saturday all right i don't do i dare fold over the page i i just got through line zero and line one on page one that's where we are we've got a million numbers to go and each line has 10 numbers we've read 20 numbers you do the math of what percentage completion this is i'm gonna get through this whole book one issue is there's a page missing in my copy uh it's i have to find it i put it somewhere else like so i have to uh i should check eventually at some point i'm gonna get to a missing page um but there we go uh how do i uh i need like a web application that helps me keep track of which random number i'm on so this was line one number uh ten i should count from zero so this is if we're if the book is a two dimensional array i'm at index one nine index row one column nine so really nine one if somebody could just quickly build that for me i could do that as my side project oh and i should use my everyday calendar uh have i read uh have i read random numbers today my everyday calendar is behind the green screen so i don't know maybe i won't do that right now okay so we'll work on that later all right ryan writes i felt like i just went to church for numbers yes hallelujah the random numbers have spoken that is my religion randomness that's that i think that is what has led me to be here with you today drinking from this high clear castle mug with lights pointed at me in an attic in brooklyn new york watching this number called concurrent viewers typing on a computer broadcasting on youtube it's all because of what randomness all right or maybe so this is random this is noise purlin noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm um all right what are we going to do today um i want to work on the live poll application and i want to debounce my um object detection ml5 example i think i'm gonna start with that first because i really need that um so let me save this and let me open up here go to file open and let's go to ml5 uh object detection okay oh this is the hmm wait a second here right this is the example that uses a static image with gloria and greta and let's make sure it works i guess it's loading the model it's taking a while the concurrent viewers went way down during that segment that's so funny all right uh and then now let me open up what i mean to open up which is ml5 object detection webcam okay so we can see by the way a little behind the scenes here i am in an attic there's the ceiling uh the top of the green screen is back there uh and we can see that what um the ml5 object detector does is it is a pretrained model trained off of the coco image data set it's called coco ssd this is a model available from tensorflow.js um it actually only recognizes 80 things and i could pull up that list um if someone wants to find it and put it in the chat it is uh the the coco classes um there's 80 of them um i doubt a train whistle is one of them but you can see a toothbrush is it a baseball bat um i suspect this mug would get recognized oh it's white so i can't see the label it says cup um so um that's this is a good one for me to try to use so what the thing that i want to do and it's a little unfortunate oh you know what i'm gonna do i have an idea this is probably a bad idea i have a separate webcam here and i wonder i kind of want to put this here let's see if i can you'll see what i'm trying to do for a moment by the way look at this great scar i've got on my elbow remember that from a few years ago feeling strong okay um let's see uh what do i want to do let's go to just open up quicktime player for a second and do new uh movie recording and uh okay uh there's the obs virtual camera there's the facetime camera and now this camera this is the new camera i've added the reason why i want to do this should be careful about what i'm showing here facetime i want it to default to the hd pro webcam this is a useful trick by the way um you can write javascript code to select the camera oh the mic is out okay the mic is back um what you're looking for you need the plug yes well you can say yes an outlet that would work with that you're going to have to find one downstairs somewhere okay i don't have one up here uh it's a mic back so by the way this is the actual one time where in discord those who just heard please tag me when you tag me it actually makes a notification sound in my ear i finally set that up but um writing the messages uh uh yeah so and and and uh otherwise and uh this is maybe mostly for simon thank you for your enthusiasm but tagging me less uh for just like little notes is um would be my suggestion so really try to use the tagging me um sparingly because otherwise i'll ignore it um but hopefully it's back now um how um when did that go when did the mic go out anyway i don't know when it went out but what i was talking about is this is very useful there is a way to write javascript code to pick the camera that you want but i find just going into the browser settings and selecting the camera is often uh a great a an easier thing to do because now if i go back to here i should have great this camera so look it recognizes my hand as a person and the cup and it gets person too interesting all right so what i want to do is i want to eliminate the fact you know what i realize i've done this before and i'm going to make this i don't want to make this so super complicated um when i opened the webcam 10 40 10 the time doesn't help me i wouldn't know what i was saying but that's okay uh all right um you know david says tagging me for emergencies only i think there's somewhere in between there like it doesn't have to just be emergencies like it could be that i you know but i don't know what the threshold is but um it can be a little bit lower than emergencies um all right now or maybe we can figure out a way to have a specific like keyword that plays a sound from discord um but um anyway somebody just tagged me except it wasn't in the live chat somebody maybe sent me a message somewhere else because it could be like the problem is there's any discord anywhere so i probably should set up a particular bot or something that listens for a certain thing and then plays a sound effect for me anyway moving on um what i want to do is i want to build uh something quickly here where when i move the cup in and out uh first of all it's sort of like interpolates a little bit so it's smoother and then if it disappears if it loses it for a second it keeps it and i actually now i'm realizing i have done this face detection uh shiftmen let's see uh i i made this example i don't know how to find it so i'm doing it again um let's see here okay so detections hmm this is interesting i have a weird idea uh i'm gonna say i'm gonna change this to an object oh this is exciting this is gonna be an object now when i get the results i'm going to loop through them this is everything that's detected and i am going to say uh the label is results index i dot label believe that's um dot label then i'm going to say if detections dot label now like this so i'm going to make this an object basically the idea of this object is i'm going to do something like this it's going to have a cup array a person array i'm this detections object is going to be a lookup table of all the things that it currently has that it thinks is in the scene and they're all organized by label um so um so if it already exists then i want to basically look at the current list of existing objects and so the current object that i'm looking at is results index i so the label is object.label and then the existing ones are detection.label so now i want to determine i mean this would be much simpler if i knew i only ever was going to have one cup so maybe i should restrict myself to that but if i want to make this totally generic then i could have multiple cups i want to find the per cup that's there that's been there the longest so one thing i could say is if existing dot length is equal to zero then i want to say existing dot push that object so basically if there's nothing there push that object into it the other thing that i want to do this is a little bit weird is i want to add a new property to the object and i'm just going to give i'm going to call this timer because basically i want an object to be able to exist for a certain amount of time then um so i'm going to leave that code there for right now then in draw i am no longer looping through all the detections i want to get all the labels let's do this is object.keys of the detections then for all of the objects of no all of the label of labels loop through all of the labels label oh this is ridiculous no no no detections label okay uh detection objects equals detections label and then i'm going to stop for a second to explain what i'm doing but just give me a second all right basically what i've done now is i have all of the detections organized by label so first i need instead of just looping through all the detections whatever the labels might be i need to get what are all the labels that exist and then for every label what are what are the objects associated with that label and then draw those so this should give me the and it's it's actually only the i have a theory of what's going to happen think to yourself as soon as i put this cup here oh boy i got nothing all right that's weird what did i what did i forget so detections is an object results well let's console.log label here oh did i delete my call back to no no it's detector.detect is still there all right let's see what happens here weird oh results dot length i don't know where i i missed this results.length that's the issue oh it's almost 11. i'm gonna take my break soon see if i can finish this okay cup person cut person so this is a little this is interesting so oh if it doesn't exist if it doesn't exist then existing equals detections label no that's if it does exist so confused oh but if it doesn't exist and the length is zero or i also need to do this right if it doesn't exist um if it doesn't exist i also want to add it so the two times i want to add it is if it exists but the length of the array is zero then i definitely want to put it in there or if it doesn't exist at all then i want to oh i want to say detections label and again wherever my i will refactor this later song is it absolutely needs that um it's an empty array is the mic really loud uh let me know somebody is saying that in the chat all right existing is not defined oh okay so guess what i could do is this right so if it doesn't exist make it an array with that object in it i'm gonna i'm gonna get there people don't worry okay yeah so the first time it happens it detects it and it puts it there so that's good now i want to implement the timer so always the uh for every object its timer should decrement and i'm gonna have a decrement by 10 and i'm going to say if object object.timer is less than zero now i need to remove it so if it ever gets below zero i want to delete that object from the object's array objects splice i1 i want to just get rid of it now if i'm doing splice i technically i should be going through the array backwards and again i'll just play the refactor song over and over again but um because i if i'm taking things out i've i've covered this in countless uh videos and there are other ways of approaching this but so now um let's see this and i want to say fill and let's give it uh some alpha that is the timer so let's see if this works so now what i'm doing is as soon as it detects an object right it fades it out and then it finds the new one let's this is happening so fast let's have the timer just go down by one so now i move this over here it's going to fade out and then it's going to catch the new one it's going to catch the new one so what i want to do now is match dining table i now the next thing i need to do is account for the situation when there's already a cup in the scene so just update the cup that was there with the new bounding box of the cup so in order to do that if existing length is not zero then the algorithm here that i need to implement is find oh and interesting copper france is saying you can do splice i minus minus 1 in normal order find the object that closest so the record distance is um infinity look through um all of the what do i i'm gonna call them options option of detections oh existing candidate let's call them candidates candidate of existing and then the distance and i could use width and height to like do but i'm just going to very very simply look for the distance between candidate x candidate y and object x object y if dist oh and then record dis okay i need an if statement here because if closest equals uh no if distance is less than the record distance the record distance is the new distance and the closest is the candidate then i also want to say candidate.taken equals true so in other words it's very important that i don't assign an existing object to 2 to two new things that it's detected i'm really making this super complicated and uh i will refactor this song and i will take your suggestions but um but but i won't but let me keep going down this road um and see where we go sorry i saw a heart emoji in the chat and from aaron i started out from your videos learning.js and i've recently been learning how to code deep learning machine learning models thank you so much for your tutorials appreciate it a lot thank you aaron so nice of you to say all right uh candidate taken and then um closest so now i would say closest okay so i'm i'm gonna do something a little um copy x y with height so i'm gonna just say uh the candidates no closest equals candidate yeah the closest x should be the object's x there we go and i'm going to use lerp in a moment the closest y is i'm going to update it closest w is the object's width closest height is the object site so when i found the closest one i update it with the new values and then also um no i don't do this here closest taken is true now i say it's taken and also its timer can be reset back to 100. so its timer can be reset back to 100 and then so after i do all of this no no no no sorry everybody this doesn't happen in the loop when i finish going through all the candidates if if there is one that it found is closest and so now i can also say and candidate is not taken right when i'm going if there's multiple objects uh if then i can say if closest otherwise i'm also then once again going to push it in it's a new otherwise it's a new object and let's add it oh this has really become kind of a mess let's review all this logic i don't know if this is right let's review this logic uh i really should this is where i wish i i should have set up my overhand camera with a diagram but i think i can talk through this so what are the various possibilities it detects the cut and let me let me turn the camera off first it detects a cup if it detects this cup it's either totally new cup because there are no cups there or all the other cups are already taken so it either has to like add it as a new cup or match it with something that was there in the previous frame i didn't do a good job explaining that let's try let me just see if i'm sure there's something wrong here let me just see if this even works i'm not resetting taken anywhere very good point so when i get to the point of drawing them all at the end i guess in the beginning um right before i found all the results i guess right here there's got to be a better way to do this but um let me use this loop right here at the beginning right before i'm about to do this evaluation um i want to and boy are there some like higher order one line of code things i could write but i just want to uh right before i start everything existing is not taken right for all the labels and all the objects that are there there none of them are taken so that now um all the candidates are available and they'll only be set to take in there okay let's see if this works all right it is now when i remove the cup it's there and it disappears now look what happens when i remove the cup again if i bring it back it knows it's the same cup so i could actually give everything an id also by the way that would be kind of interesting let's give everything an id i can't believe this worked let's give everything an id uh id count equals zero and whenever i make a new oh boy i make a new object in so many different places so this is why i need to refactor this which i might even do right now and i know i've got to move on but i'm so i this is like so helpful for me to take care of this example right now and maybe i should make this a video um this is like a sort of persistence um and i haven't really tested this so well like what if i have two cups but i'll come i'll i'll try to do that maybe with this mug would this also be a cup cell phone i could probably get two cell phones going um what was i looking for anytime i make a new object this is a new object this is a new object those are the only places if i say push existing push or also this is a new object so for example object dot id equals id count and then increment it so again this is if it's new right only if i'm updating it i don't give it a new id and then also this is if it's new so in theory let me see here when i'm drawing it i should be able to say add the id let me not make this white right now let me make this bigger um let's see what happens here let's see if this works okay cup zero person one so i take my cup away and if i bring it back it's still cup zero but if i take it away and for a long enough time it fades out and is gone should be cup two so i could uh the idea is a unique idea across all of them so it's not cup two it's cup one but there was a person there so and then how can i get another cup let's see will this ever be a cup it's so many things bars three remote and by the way that timer of a hundred is much too long so i think now i can have the timer uh run out much faster like the point is it's just a debounce like if it's you know briefly blips away um so you can see like now if it's gone it's gonna like fade out much more quickly uh new cup new cup now the other thing i want to do is i want to interpolate because it's very it can be very jittery so the last piece of this is is to use the lerp function so i'm going to use the lerp function which is linear interpolation and you can find my video on linear interpolation if you're wondering about that uh and let's just add lerp here i want to learn between object x and closest x and closest y and closest w and closest uh h and then how much do i want to lerp some amount i will talk about what this means in one second let me just finish typing this all right so the idea here is if the cup moves uh and like changes its size kind of uh drastically and this cup is pretty stable actually so i should my hand is much more unstable in the sort of person detecting trying to make it you can see that how it like kind of jumps around a lot what i want to do is have it smoothly interpolate between values and so the i'm going i'm taking the current value and the new value and not assigning directly to the new value but sort of averaging those two so even if i just put 0.5 oh and sorry i should just make amount a variable if i put set amount to be 0.5 and run it again is there a name for this algorithm that i'm implementing by the way i would like to know um and now so now if i do this you know you can see it's a little bit smoother but if my amount stays much more true to the cur the previous location which is the object location so if i say something like 0.9 whoops point let's just do like nine five for example let's make this really high like nine nine which is going to be way too high whoops oh rock rock of is suggesting i should use the word not set instead of taken but um well hold on it's very hard so it's like two like you can see that it's much too smooth like i don't want it to be that slow and updating so really what i probably want is something like point nine ninety percent let's just see what it looks like with the mug oh put it with you can see how it's so that's even pretty slow like how it's like it's way too much lag i just want to smooth it out a little bit so let's make it more like uh 0.75 because it is actually pretty smooth in the first place and i don't know the this is now up to you to like tune how you want it but um you can see here um if i go just be more directly in the frame right it's actually not detecting that's weird did i do something wrong there must be a bug object x y with height no that's weird gone person six why i mean the person tracking is so bad uh let's person now the problem is my hand um let's use this uh thermos bottle yeah no it's working it's just a lot of and also you know maybe i shouldn't add an object until it's been there for like a bit like so i don't get the noisiness but i'm not sure how much i like the the luring all right so the last thing i need to do is um this is done uh maybe i've there's a bug the first kept the first rectangle is kept instead of updated um xx can you say more the first rectangle is kept instead of updated yeah like something is definitely weird about this but it's hard for me to know like if i just make this amount zero that's just setting it equal to or one no zero would be setting it equal to closest i'm doing something wrong i'm or i guess the person that's really getting my shoulder how come i can't get it to like is it just the person detection that's weird yeah it's just the person i i think me trying to debug it with person detection is bad because the person detection is not it's meant for me to be like much further it's just i still am confused but i guess it's just not accurate right the x coordinate for the person but i i can only imagine that that's i'm losing my mind here maybe use lerp for small movements but go instantly if the new position is larger than a delta that's a that's a yeah it doesn't seem to change dimensions is that the issue are the dimensions not changing object but i'm oh it's with it's not w and h no wonder there's the bug my shorthand is not it's actually it's width and height there's no w in h i've just like created a false shorthand oh javascript javascript lets you do way too much all right now we should see there we go okay that was the problem that was the problem ah so now let me put the lerp back in and i'll just leave it at 0.5 just to like i don't need it to be much more smooth you can see it's a little bit more smooth i should probably have it fade in but i'm not going to worry about that um having it fade in and then fade out would be a good thing i'll let somebody else do that and let me just make the lerp i'm going to go back to point 75 and now uh i need to uh just keep this i just want to see all right so this is good this is now following the object and it's not noisy and you can see that here with the person and then if i leave so what are some other i know that it i had a scissors here uh great i know that scissors is one of the objects so let's see if i can create a short clip with scissors and cup i wish you know what i want to do just for creating a clip of this so this is going to show up in my um in the video is like an extra example so i think what i want to do is not draw a person so i want to say i want to ignore person so how do i do where should i do that um i guess i'll just do it in the drawing as long as object label is not equal to per to person um oh this is real i just want to like yeah don't do the drawing you can still do all the other stuff because i think this will make the demonstration much better and now actually i can use my other camera because uh so let me just make sure this works um i kind of wanted to skip it detecting person so i don't want the ids to go up but i guess i could actually just do it up here and label does not equal a person let's do that um and now let me switch back i'm just going to unplug this camera sense and i'm actually going to hit start record i'm going to record this to disk because um actually you know what i'm not going to record it to disk i'll do that i could also screen record um a new screen recording just because i want to use this um record entire screen i found this on the web uh record entire screen record am i recording yeah all right so uh let's make this wider so we can the code can be in there a little bit just in case um and now hopefully where are the scissors oh crap where was that setting i don't know why i plugged it because that didn't help camera uh camera uh facetime camera okay okay so now um scissors whoa 189 what what's it detecting that's i thought i took out the person like it shouldn't be able to add it something is wrong with this i thought this would as long as it doesn't equal person do all this stuff if you can't add it let me take this off uh yeah so scissors i guess the timer should be a little longer so let me make the timer a little longer because it is um unless it was detecting two of them i should also use the confidence score but all that said i gotta stop uh i'm just gonna have the timer fade out a little bit shorter okay all right last time okay scissors toothbrush just trying to get a clip all right this will be a good demonstration all right i think that's enough footage i recorded enough screen capture that mattia can use that for the video and let me save this as object detection um all right that example is done um any questions about that i mean i got to move on um this is a pretty complicated example um and i know i didn't like fully explain it um so um i uh uh and my brain is hurting now because that was like hard to think through i'd be glad if there was interest to kind of redo that in a video tutorial or kind of like talk through it a bit more but i think i want to leave it there because i want to break and i want to get to the live poll application um so first of all um if people don't know what i'm using um i'm actually using this ml5.js library um and the the uh the the functionality the model that i'm using is something called the object detector but guess what it's not here so the object detector is actually in the current version of ml5 but it has not been sort of updated or placed into the documentation yet but there is a new release coming out soon um and so there'll be documentation for that and uh hopefully by the end of this weekend i'll have finished editing together the video tutorial it's about 20 minutes about using the object detector and um whereas and this is just sort of like an additional exercise example that'll go along with that okay um now uh let's give me a second here oh all right i'm going to take a break in a moment and then come back and do the live poll application but before i do that i want to take a moment to thank today's sponsor brilliant so do you want to learn something new you do probably if you're watching the coding train brilliant is the place to do it it's a website and app that makes learning accessible and fun you know what this year of 2020 a lot of us are doing a lot of home learning um and so i i do think that if you're looking for something for yourself or your family or a friends um learning about programming and science and physics and all sorts of things you the brilliant website is uh an app is a wonderful place to do so there's no tests no grades there's a whole lot of courses pick what you're interested in get started if you make a mistake no big deal in fact one of the things i love about brilliant is when i get it wrong and then i can read through various community contributed answers and explanations and it really helps me with the process of learning there's algebra programming cuttingedge topics just like the coding train like neural networks watching those videos and learning the code or running the examples is not the full story so going through something like their course on neural networks itself really has a bunch of like interactive visualizations and examples that help you sort of like see how the neural network is working there's also one of my favorite courses if i can pull this up here if this is going to work is the course on infinity um um this is like there's just like the beauty and wonder of infinity the paradoxes of infinity um you know this is like a major aspect of mathematics so the the course starts with basic counting and works its way up to many types of infinity culminating in the profundity of cantor's theorem and here you're seeing the uh i can never say it i want to just say coke but i don't think that's how it's prone i like to say koch also but um the correct there is a correct pronunciation that i'm sure all of you will tell me about in the chat um but this particular snowflake fractal i have a coding challenge that makes exactly this and brilliant is a really wonderful complement to a lot of the coding um coding challenges i have um what i think i want to do um you know so let me coming back to uh here for a second uh briefly is that so you know i encourage you to sign up um you can sign up for free at uh you just took that down brilliant.org coding train i'll take a few minute break in a moment and you can use that time to sign up um play around with the site there's lots of tons of stuff you can do there for free and if uh you know lets them know that you found brilliant through me which is helping out the coding train a bit and also if you decide you want to unlock everything that's there or i'll notice right there i have a premium subscription which you can see right up here you know the holiday season is coming up uh what can i do what can i need a gift for somebody gifting somebody a premium subscription is also a wonderful thing to consider by the way i should also mention that brilliant told me that they're doing a lot of redesign uh so some logo and design of the website and app all that's changing coming soon so stay tuned i assume hopefully i'll have the chance to show that to you when it happens if brilliant continues to sponsor the coding trade let's one of the i noticed today i didn't actually uh solve this but i quickly read through one of the my favorite things about brilliant is the um daily challenges um so i want to go to this one that's called the interplanetary goo ball games and the reason why i want to go to this and i'll let me do uh read keep reading is that one of my favorite things about brilliant is the interactive visualizations and animations about problems so this is a i'm gonna paraphrase the longer explanation here this is a game where you throw a ball of goo at another space ball it's a blob of goo and the blob sticks perfectly to the spaceball and based on the mass and the velocity of that ball it will push it in a given direction so if i set the velocity of the left guess i can't set the left blob to 0.5 and the right bob to negative 0.5 so the red blob is going to go super fast and the left blob is going to go slow you know imagine what's going to happen whoa wait that was a bug well we just found a bug hold on that's so crazy let's do it the other way around let's let it finish i think we found a bug in the brilliant website there we go that's what it should do right that fast one's coming at the slow one slows it down a tiny bit so what are the equations there's actual equations for how you calculate the final velocity the mass of the ball plus the mass of the blob uh oh and you know momentum is a concept here the total momentum the conservation of momentum so there's a lot of concepts here and it really relates the reason why i was like excited to see this i was like oh this is like exactly everything that's in my nature of code book about forces and uh newton's laws so there's a lot of uh there's a strong relationship here but what i let's look at the actual let's look at the actual question okay and see if we can answer it in this round of blaster ball the earthling allstars are given an advantage and let me get the chat back up here because i i put it away for a second um the launch speed of the earthling sticky blobs so earthling or the blue is meters per second the launch speed of mercury re united is a hundred meters per second the blobs are both one kilograms 0.1 kilograms each and the ball is .4 kilograms oh i should i really should just set up my overhead camera with my diagram stuff every day so apologies for that every not every day but every saturday i'll do that next time i don't have it today um and the ball is stationary to begin with okay so if we were to just send one from each if this is going 115 milliseconds per second and this is going 100 this one's going to hit first and it's going to end up it's going to overpower this one because it's going to hit first moving faster at the end of the round oh the earthlings have made seven hits and the mercury you know and you murky renaissance made eight which direction is the ball going so i believe the formula uh for an uh and if you read about that i care about is mass times velocity times the number of balls now the mass of both is the same so actually don't if i'm trying to decide which way it's going to go that evens out right and obviously the mass of the blob the so the mass of the blobs are the same and the mass of the ball is important too but again i just want to compare like i don't need the mass of the ball or the mass of the blobs because they're they're equivalent so i think seven earthlings what's 7 times 115 8 times 100 is 800 meters per second well yeah 8 times 100 is 800 7 times 115 what's 7 times 15 70 plus 7 times 5 is 305 right so that's 805 did i do that right 805 is bigger than 800 so the ball is going to go towards mercury i really i really need pen and paper here i've learned my lesson so the answer is toward mercury united the earthlings win all right does every before i select this think about this have i gotten it right have i gotten it wrong i'm gonna pick this and i'm gonna hit submit in a second yay one of these days my streak's gonna be higher than one day i have gotten many a higher streak than one day but i've never been live streaming when i was like in an existing streak so that is a life goal for me right now um but again what i really like about this is the um explanations oh look at this to 805 100 times 8 is 800 um and um here it looks like here is the full story which the number times the mass times the velocity um and oh look at this i need a new usb cable what it is is this cable is loose i'll show you is loose and it keeps like i can wiggle it and i'll mess up the mic probably but um so sorry about that uh i gotta fix that some tape or something okay oh wow and also that is super loud it goes way into the red anyway um what i was saying i think when i got muted is uh let's create a channel in the discord to talk about the brilliant challenges and if anybody creates a p5.js demonstration or writes an explanation here please share it with me so i can check that out later so i'm going to take a five minute break um and if you feel so inclined please sign up for brilliant.org codingtrain uh write your own explanation for this challenge and i will see you in about five minutes oh i forgot my intermission because i was doing the live poll actually has i'm gonna just take that out it has a little bit of a browser uh so weird um as part of my screen showing i'll take that off and see you in a couple minutes so do do do do do all right everyone i am back about 100 of you left when i took the break boy maybe you'll come back it's good it's good there's plenty of you left thank you for sticking around for the rest of this live stream we've probably got about 45 minutes at the most um i want to mention something so i don't know if kobe who's one of the um discord uh manager moderators is and i meant to i mean it's not a big deal but i meant to close this um is um i don't know if kobe is still watching but i quickly created a channel called live links that might not be the right emoji or the right name for it or the right place for it but i'm pretty sure that any channels here only i can post to the reason why i created that is because i realized that um sometimes what i want to do is keep track of links that i am share things quickly with people who are watching the live stream and i could certainly paste something into the youtube chat but that chat scrolls by very fast and i don't actually have it open on this laptop so um i just want to do things like whoops nope that's not getting pasted there like for example like here's the link to the code um so this is like ml5.js object detector with persistence like i can just put this here and so i've got the link to that there there was something else that i wanted to share but also um if any admins or moderators if there's ever a thing like share something that i need to copy paste with me that this could be used for that potentially so um maybe there's a better system for that um but i'll let i'll let everybody sort of work that out but i'm gonna use that for right now so if you're in the discord you should be able to get the code that i just wrote by going over here and let me also get the generator function code also this is useful because i want to add these things to the youtube video description later and so this is a reminder of things for me to add to the you the the the um the description layer so this is the generator function example um so let me go back to discord uh general and yes you can react with emojis here you should be able to generator function uh example um there we go there's that so other things that come up that i'm showing are referring to um i will uh put there okay um yeah the live category oh this is also yes definitely it should go here perfect uh sure i think it's the same permissions and maybe actually what i want to do is make this i'm obsessed with uh the correct emoji and i could just call this links um and then now uh we've got the schedule by the way this is where i post um this is where i post um announcements about the schedule although for once in my life i've got something um i seem to have a regular schedule which is every saturday morning 10 a.m eastern time uh with some exceptions obviously but if you want to get updates i don't use the at everyone tag maybe i should but i use something called at notifications so also if you're in the discord you should go i think um to i think you say how do you how do you subscribe to the notifications what's the command uh there's a command for subscribing to the notifications somebody will tell me in a moment that um okay yeah mr salvation come in the discord i'm really trying to get the discord going um it's just a chat tool that i've been using more and more um it really seems to work well for engaging with the community for people getting help with their code i would say like my two favorite channels are introductions so please introduce yourself there um i just love to scroll through and read these um and learn about the community as well as pets so please share your pets uh same asia isn't he a cutie patootie oh yes qt patootie where's my cutie patootie sound effect all right uh but uh let's go back to uh the safety of this lynx and channel it's uh exclamation point subscribe so just to show you if i do exclamation point subscribe um the bot is going to this stream bot is going giving me the role notifications so please when you join the two big most important steps are read me read the readme react with an emoji to get all the channels unlocked and then i suppose probably the appropriate place to do this is in bot talk do i mean i just did it over here just for reference um exclamation point subscribe unless you don't want the notifications it's very reasonable to not want the notifications we're kind of doing opt in uh we don't uh i i have used at every one i used it once for something i really wanted some help or engagement with and mostly i just got flamed with a lot of people complaining that i'd used it so i do want to reserve the right to use it but um just for weekly schedule updates um just the exclamation point subscribe and if you're wondering how to make your own discord bot stay tuned um certainly you can check the collaboration i did with uh coding garden with cj that's the archive of that is on youtube i think if you search coding garden coding train discord bot you'll find that but i'm soon to be releasing a sequence instead of tutorials okay um one of the things by the way that i finally figured out i don't like having this sidebar shown while i'm live streaming because it shows direct messages and other channels that i'm subscribed to there's nothing necessarily private about that but you know i i'm not you know people who direct message me on discord aren't like opting in to having me show their like profile picture on a live stream so i figured out how to get rid of that by doing command option i which opens up the job this is just a web page inside the app and it opens up the console of course you know you want to be careful about what you paste there and the discord has a nice message but i was able to figure out that um i can hide it by using like some native javascript like document get elements by tag name the navigation bar index zero style.visibility um equals hidden so that's a useful little trick um discord option command i uh pulls that up all right what's next the live poll application so i have about a half an hour to work on this a little bit more and one of the thing that i want to start with is there have been a bunch of pull requests and comments posted so let's take a look at those and see what we can um kind of merge in and add and what's the thing that i should i should if i i should also add this to hacktoberfest um what is the thing i need to add a topic is that what i do um somebody will tell me i think somewhere under where are the topics sometimes oh yeah uh topics is it just this hacktoberfest if i just add this topic um then it will these will be valid so let me do that let me go to the pull request let's go in reverse order i made some css that makes it coding train themed all right so i like this the only issue i have with this is that and did i write this the background has to stay transparent for it to be an overlay um so change change the background color so resolve conflicts there's some conflicts i guess oh i wanted it to be green um so and this added a css file so i'm gonna i'll i'll just alter this myself so let's let's keep let's get rid of let's keep that and get rid of my style which was all this stuff yep so that should resolve the conflict um we oh we had a conflict uh giggy oh g you and me were in a tense battle it's uh very very very stressful to be in this conflict but i'm gonna resolve it i'm gonna resolve this conflict we will all feel that we are happy now as i resolve the merge conflict i commit that merge and i understand that i'm updating maine and we all feel good about things and this is my merge conflict resolve music i'm gonna go to your files changed and i'm gonna suggest um i'm gonna suggest that you change the background to green um one thing i love about these uh github suggestions is as the maintainer of the repo i can actually make a suggestion to somebody's pull request that they can accept in the interest of time i'm just going to go ahead and make the suggestion and accept it myself because i don't want to wait for the back and forth while i'm live streaming but um this is for the chroma key overlay i'll just right here and normally i might start a review and have a bunch of different suggestions and comment but i'm kind of moving quickly here i'm just going to make this a single comment um you can see now that the suggestion is there you know i would normally wait for the discussion to happen with ggog but i'm just going to go ahead and commit those changes and then i am going to um merge this pull request all right we're taking this coding stream coding train themed pull request um so thank you for that um and prob let's get back to um the console here and i believe it's just on my desktop and i forgot how this works but i think if i just run it i will see what i have so far at localhost 3000 so this is the current uh poll which you can't vote in right now because i'm not running the server and i haven't made an interface for voting all those things have to come but let's just pull in those new so what i probably should do is check out a different branch and look at the pull request before i merged it but you know me i'm loosely goosey here now i can grab those updates that were already merged uh run it again and take a look at what we've got and there we go i love this change all right coding train live poll so there's a lot of room for improvement here anybody wants to contribute with design uh you know right now the contributions are small enough that i can kind of go through them as i'm working on this project but i i you know i'm if if this stuff if more people want to contribute i might need more of a process for like you know who's actually doing the design or maintaining the design but um if you have some ideas so there we go there um let's go to the next pull request train bogey oh right represent the percentages as train bogies that's indian english i'm not i'm not familiar with that term using emojis i do like this idea now let's see we're i'm almost certain we're going to have some conflicts so oh no we've got to resolve these merge conflicts oh we're in it oh no that's not it we're in a tense battle between train bogie in maine the conflict oh it's a deep dark historical conflict of epic proportions we need to resolve it to feel happy oh this is gonna be this is gonna be hard um so what do i want okay i think i want to keep the font face i'm so confused i'm so confused here what the reason why i'm confused is i feel like this came from maine why is it oh it is saying it's from maine like is this saying it's that's the above stuff is main and then this is from train bogey yes um and i should use a tissue not my shirt that was kind of disgusting i apologies for that can we edit that out of this live stream i think i might need these glasses for a moment here to figure this out okay um by the way one of my side projects is to whenever i put these glasses on trigger a like party theme that's like just like starts as an overlay all over the screen it's a new side project somebody add that to my list of side projects um all right so i think i kind of want to take everything here in that uh i want all of this that's the body i want to keep the font face um and then here i think this is get i think this is everything i think this is resolved now i think we're resolved we're at peace we're at peace our merge conflict has been resolved and we can take a deep breath and relax with the combined css of train bogie and maine let's mark it as resolved and again um what i probably would want to do here is um i probably would want to check it first but that's not how i roll uh oh gypsy dangerous requested my review thank you for that um and let's merge it we're gonna go ahead and merge it i need to merge we've merged uh and now i can grab that and run it again and let's see what we've got all right yes we're really cooking with gas now this is awesome okay back to the pull requests let's take a look at true oh oh oh no this is oh that's the issues let's go back to the pull request moved validation to back end instead of client oh this is thank you for this fantastic so um and and simon is telling me some suggestions here also let's take a look let's do a little review here okay so what's being changed can you see this um we are first getting the port from an environment variable which will be necessary for when it's deployed that's good um i'll take that as a reasonable change and then why is it not scrolling why can i not get this to scroll when i'm zoomed in there we go um then also if there's no poll send a status error invalid poll id okay like that if object keys poll filter oh i have no idea what this is doing okay the glasses have to come off for this uh all right let's see um if if okay i'm getting the array of poles and if it doesn't have an id ah if it doesn't include the choice ah i see then invalid choice so last week people put in like little up messages to me in the database so that's good i like this i mean i'm assuming that's working correctly i'm having a hard time unpacking this in my brain like what is this doing that it's i'm giving us the array of all the poles right we found the pole and then filtering it and if it's not an invalid choice i'm just gonna trust this i can't unpack i can't unpack it can somebody face give you like an explanation of what this is doing i could write it in like multiple lines but i'm really having trouble unpacking it but i can see i'm gonna sort of trust this um you know this is just a fun project i can fix it later if it doesn't work um but i like the idea of filtering it here um and then uh this is creating a new poll uh it's response is sending the votes this is doing something creates a new object votes which doesn't have the id property okay i like that um and i always forget i have to do i have to learn what this means it is taking the choice from the request params and making sure an existing entry exists with that choice got it okay uh thank you for that um and then in the client the check is no longer needed so that's just a comment there i'll comment that out okay great i like this it's much better for that filtering to happen here so i'm going to merge this i'm happy with this let's go ahead and merge this pull request all right now uh let's pull from the origin and let's run it and let's make sure our polling app is still working i still see the same results no errors on the server the question now is if i go to oh and this is the bot or something else let me hold on i have to remove my laptop for a second because i'm i'm gonna there's some other code examples open which are going to um they have a spot token in it which i don't want to show um now i should be able to go back to here and by the way i can also go over here how about that huh let's go over here for a second uh how's that for fancy uh let's open up the code i believe that if i go into database.db i think i want to clear this let me clear database.db uh oh it's already running let me go back to here great uh syntax error unexpected end of json input at count votes did i not add oh i think i think i have it like create new poll is just sort of like commented out right so right now my cr there is no i want to create a endpoint for creating a poll but right now i just have to like manually create a poll so let me do that just to see okay uh cannot access database okay well clearly this has to happen after okay so now i'm still getting that error um sketch.js line five what broke here vote count votes count votes oh because i hardcoded in the id boy there's a lot of problems a lot of things to fix that i maybe today is just like getting organized and adding some issues and letting other people do pull requests to fix individual issues but i suppose just to like let me put this id oh this is terrible uh i'll hard code that in there there we go okay we're back up and running um so yeah this leaves a lot to be desired but i i at least want to see if i can add the voting interface today before i go so i'm going to move but i'm glad i've merged these two pull requests this um all right refactor to utilize es6 destructuring and update a database call to use one less query on increment i like this idea like this idea oh no oh no oh no boom i need that sound effect uh do i have any of my scary music uh maybe it's this one oh hey dance battle we gotta resolve our conflicts all right let's let's take a look at this i i really appreciate this um love the stream yesterday so i figured i would improve on the rest endpoints to use destructuring for the request parameters and update the database call but i don't to increment on update rather than searching and then updating okay that i really wanted help with so let's take a look at the files changed first to understand so this we've also got ah this was already in somebody else's so uh that's probably where a conflict is um this is getting the is doing oh this is how you do the update thing await database update id increment choice by one return updated doc so this is what i was looking for i couldn't figure out how to get this like increment thing to work not that i fully understand this right now but that looks awesome and then response send await database find one the update function accepts a return updated docs so it still can be accomplished in one call let's look at this uh update options okay yeah return updated docs the return promise will resolve with an object or with an array of objects okay this is cool so let's look at the conflicts this looks like something i can accept um but i've gotta i've gotta deal with the conflicts time to resolve these conflicts uh these look the same i like the fact that i like this so let's i like also how this is written in one line though so let's grab this and put it in here and then we'll take this oh we'll take this these are the same so i need this so this is what i want now i want to get the port oh and i should move myself back oops to here i want to get the port um zoom in a little bit here i want to get the port from the environment variable i want to say it's running at local host port uh static and now here so this oh okay so here's my confusion can i still how do i integrate these two hmm oh boy what's up with the music at schwarzer so this is going to be hard because this does the incrementation in one call so definitely i want if no pull i don't know how to integrate this i'm gonna need some help i'm gonna need somebody else to resolve the merge conflicts so i'm actually not going to do this right now um can i'm just going to what i'm going to do is this um i'm not going to resolve these how do i get that i'm just going to go back and hit leave i'm also i'm going to just do a quick review so let's go here files changed let's do a quick review i just want to change this to um add a suggestion oh i can do multiline suggestions now right uh cancel yes so i think if i do this if i do multiline yep no there's a way to do a multiline suggestion i don't remember how to do that this is so not important yes how do you do that does anybody know seen that ah there we go look there we go multiline suggestion so i'm gonna suggest this change this to a oneliner and put this in here um oh oh this is so silly of me what am i doing this is a needle this um this doesn't need this doesn't need to be changed i'm changing the code to be on one line on very unnecessary here i'm not going to worry about that all right um um let's see here um so i'm gonna just do a review um so i'm just gonna comment this is terrific i really like the new database calls but um um but um there were some other changes related to um checking to validation um that need um resolution that need to be integrated with these changes can you help resolve the conflicts then i will merge okay so let me submit that and i assume that um drc is maybe not watching right now um but um if if you are you could do this uh live right now and i'll merge it but i think anything that i'm to implement right now is not going to affect this so i can move along um and then this can be merged later i mean i want to wait and kind of merge things during the live stream but this i might just go ahead and merge now that we've reviewed it before next saturday so let's look just there was one more pull request oh there's two oh simon pull request seven minutes ago okay um let's create a branch with simple sequel light 3 for consideration oh boy okay this is oh super interesting so i don't know how to make this decision but because i'm using this any db that is a kind of very hello world sort of style get started with the database system and this is using sql lite which is really really interesting to see this would be a major change right now i don't really know sequel light so i'm a little hesitant to just uh merge this in certainly also now it's going to conflict with all the other stuff but i do like the idea of having the database stuff in a separate file and then having various functions like create poll so let's make our first poll like related to what database system to use i don't know that could be something we could try um but i do like this i'm so i'm i'm interested in trying this let's i'll get a little further with functionality and design and we can swap out and we can consider swapping out the back end on a future stream if you want to uh if you want to keep this in sync if you want to keep this in sync with me okay so i'm gonna write that comment there so we'll leave this as to be considered uh for later uh we can check out uh simon's pull request you create an interface but for now you can create a piece of software called insomnia to make post requests that's interesting so you're oh interesting you're changing it into a post to uh receive the votes so i that thank you for that i think i'm gonna leave it as is because i do i do want to build my own interface um and i think it'll be a little simpler with just the voting to keep it with the get requests but i do appreciate this and i will take a look at it more late later if we want to um and hacktoberfest optin ah there's been a recent update where individuals have voluntary right so i need to add a topic that's just hacktoberfest great so i did that so this is now done this is now done we can close this issue and go through the issues real quick um um there there has been progress but happy for more design uh ideas uh one limitation is keep the background green for chroma keying so i'll just note this here so this can stay open um back to issues glitch info uh how do i push code so i'll look at this way i'm not i decided not to go with the sort of like syncing it with glitch but that's useful information i'll come back to that and then this was the database discussion um where we had some nice suggestions here any db is fine to use oh i like this so um i definitely want uh i definitely like the idea of having the pole object be more sophisticated so let's uh thumbs this up um oh and simon made so this i would love if one if there's like a database system that one of you is making that's just very basic and you're gonna maintain it that's definitely something we could use so that's great thanks for sharing that um where and then sequel light might be a good option and crunchy pie uh added that sql light interface so this is definitely a heart and this is definitely also a heart and i'm just going to reply to dj pamson um i don't know why i can't mention dj pamson here but i oh no it's not dj it's di i call you hey hey dj pamson can you spin up some tunes for me uh d.i pamson um would gladly accept a pull request star emoji all right thank you for all this all right now 12 20. boy we're really out of coffee it's getting close to lunchtime um paw is insomnia if you're on mac okay postman is greater than insomnia all of you are giving me interesting things no let's make the voting interface so let's do that now so um this is under public there's index.html so i don't know to what extent i want to make this into like a website with multiple let's just put the voting on this right now so how do you make what do i want to make radio buttons is that a thing how do you do that radio buttons uh oh and there's that's in p5 there is a p5 thing for it uh create radio maybe i'll just do that create radio um so let's try this so what if i just in my p5 code call this is tarot again once again uh things that need to be done to do uh you know this page should be for a specific poll and i should make these separate issues and another to do is to do create a poll creation page uh another to do is uh like different pages for voting oh yeah i definitely want different voting viewing and uh poll creation like that i might want at some point but just for simple simpleness right now um a b c and d let's see what this gets me okay why is it all the way down there because there's a canvas i don't need the canvas anymore well i'm not using the canvas for anything am i huh i'm so confused like because is this oh this is canvas but it doesn't need to be hold on let's not let's just do this for a second just so i can see aha i see so let's uh just do this there we go that's better again there's no reason for me to use canvas for the visualization but why not um all right so let's uh and why is this like in this weird thing like that but i'll take it and then i want to make a button so let's make a vote button and a vote equals create button vote and then vote vote button submit mouse pressed submit vote okay submit vote and then i need a function called submit vote which let me just console log the radio is it choice i don't know is that like a property of the p5 radio object radio button object let's look text radio.value okay radio.value um and so uh let's see how let's see what this does all right a d okay we're this is looking good b all right now we've got a voting interface this is amazing uh oops and now i want to not just do that but submit to the server so vote poll id choice that's what i want to call and let's make this function uh submit vote let's make this an async function so i can say uh let response equal fetch and then i just going to what am i going to um vote poll id choice and once again i'm card coding in the poll id uh select poll id somehow uh vote poll id and then radio dot value and maybe i should put that into a variable and i'm i'm yeah you guys can fix my es6 whatever later choice equals radio dot value um all we need is radio go go radio gaga and then i can put choice in here okay then um let's uh let uh i want to just what is it what do i send back let us i don't know status equals response dot json oh wait oh and this has to be a weight i don't want these parentheses here i don't need that and then console dot log status all right let's see how this goes whoa why did i get so many there oh is it like because it's like normalizing it oh it's normalizing it so i don't know what i feel about the emojis not a lot of detail there can i give myself more width like um i like the emojis but the normalizing is a little bit uh suspect um width divided by 10 width is max vote 100 so how much space do i have 400 let's say i think i have 300 probably so whoa so five i don't have let's um let's make that a little bit less there we go a little bit more can i fit more there we go okay now here we are voting oh nothing is selected so if the value i you have i don't think i should like have something selected by default that's putting the thumb on the scale too much but i should not submit it as long as like as long as there is a choice uh you can do this otherwise no choice selected what's going on here wait what happened to my auto format on save did i like turn that off hold on uh format no format file on save do i have like a syntax error why is it not formatting on save does anybody know i won't worry about that okay uh how's everything going um okay let's see here refresh and now what if i refresh and don't no choice selected okay and if i click a for quite a bit a goes up all right this is working the live poll is happening uh one thing i well all right um now uh let's create a branch here for what we're doing get branch uh whoops get branch uh crude interface get checkout crude interface uh all right and let's if anybody wants to check this out i'm sending it up to github with this crude interface and now i think i want to clear i think i need some admin tool way of clearing the database oh i forgot about how it doesn't how uh any db works but i think couldn't i do something like if i just delete it in the server like if it creates the database create new poll like couldn't oh no but then i don't have the id all right whatever i'm just gonna very crudely i'm gonna do a horrible thing which is um manually edit the database and set these all to be zeros so obviously i want to well let's make a real let's make a real poll and i should also these these votes the options should come from the names in the poll all right people will pull request that stuff to me i can't do it right now so what should the poll be i need some suggestions as a force compression what's the function for the force compression i can call i should be scaled only after a number of votes i agree except for the fact that as soon as i release this the number of votes are gonna like go like crazy so that's a good feature somebody can submit a pull request for that um but um let's run the server and let's refresh and let's vote there we go okay so it's still working um what should the poll be i mean with four options i mean i was sort of curious like we could say we could do something about database like should i replace the database i mean this is not going to be scientific also i'm not i'm not like uh storing anybody's ip address or anything to like reduce to like enforce single voting so i know i'll do um we'll do a poll a nonscientific poll um i'm gonna go jogging today should i do my two mile route my 2.5 mile route my three mile route for my four mile route these are my typical routes that i do so you can vote which route you think i do probably d is gonna win everyone's gonna want me to go for a longer jog right this is kind of ridiculous but this is the bowl that we're gonna do so i need to run ngrok i forgot how to do this do i have it not found i didn't went through this last week why is ngrok oh oh right i need to put it in the path how do i let's fix this um so where is where is um where is end where did i put it wait oh someone tagged me uh all right simon's just suggesting about the emojis that does not rise to the threshold of emergency uh okay um ngrok there it is it's just right here i just put it on the desktop all right fine i'm gonna do it that way so at some point i should add ngrok to my path so i can just type ngrok wherever i am maybe i should do that where would i put it like user var local bin or something like that but i'm just going to type it so i need to do ngrok http 80. uh oh but i need to do it from within i forget how this works eventually i'm going to remember so ngrok http 3000 is oh yeah so if i'm serving it i think it actually is if i'm already serving on port 3000 and from ngrok i do ngrok http 3000 that means now if you go to this url you've got the poll so you can go to i will now put this in discord under here so this should be now the link to the poll application so people should be voting now let's see is this going to ch live update or is it broken or something okay great people are voting ah you were 30 seconds behind me that's why remember we're voting for this but let's make this an overlay oh but and so uh how do i get i need the ngrok link can someone post the ngrok link just in the um uh discord live chat i'm gonna pull this up and oh thank you gaytan um and let me go to here properties and i need the ngrok.io link please oh fine i'll go get it myself under links uh copy link let's put it in here paste okay and then i should be seeing it oh there it is oh we don't need that so here we are we've got a live poll overlay happening right now live on the cutting train this is so cool come on people let's let's do an exercise here uh everyone's voting for um the uh c which is my three mile route that's actually my favorite um favorite route to jog the three mile one i once when i was doing the marathon training i jogged all the way out to coney island which is um and back i think which was like a half marathon route um so yeah you should be able can somebody post the ngrok link into i can do it why am i asking for somebody else to do it i will just do it this is the link to vote um try not to hack my home network uh and let's see can let's just as an exercise can everybody vote for a for a moment i don't know let's um i mean this is i'm wrapping up the live stream for sure now it's 12 40. this has been fun i'm so thrilled to have this working oh hold on a second everybody laura weber welcome to the coding train members program at the end for your coding trade membership what i'm very very tired after streaming for two and a half hours message for me saying thank you uh please log into discord to get your membership integration and here is your random number 91 340 your very own personal random number ah let's get a little further in the book why not while people are voting where were we i need somebody remember someone can create the web application that tracks where i am in the random number book but i remember where i was i was like uh row one column nine so i'm starting off of row two eight thousand four hundred and twenty two sixty eight thousand nine hundred fifty 953 19645 9000 9303 23 209. five hundred sixty fifty thousand nine hundred fifty three thirty four thousand seven hundred sixty four thirty five thousand eighty thirty three thousand six hundred and six ninety nine thousand and 12 529 9376 it's a long slot 70 715. all right everybody a is up let's make d happen where was i huh thirty eight thousand three hundred and eleven thirty one thousand one hundred and sixty five eighty eight thousand six hundred and seventy six seventy four thousand three hundred and ninety seven four thousand four hundred and thirty six twenty seven thousand six hundred and fifty nine and that's just when you think the song is ending it actually has a minute left transitioning into the next phase 12 807 99 970 80 157 36 147 64 032 36 653 98 951 thousand eight hundred and seventy seven twelve thousand one hundred and seventy one seventy six thousand eight hundred and thirty three sixty six thousand and sixtyfive seventy four thousand seven hundred and seventeen thirty four thousand and seventytwo all right everyone um so where did i what was the number i just read 34 072 so i have finished on row five column zero one two so i'm on row five column three row five column three how am i gonna remember that who's making me the thing that tells me what to read on p row five column three that's where i need to pick up next time on the coding train um let's uh finish the day by solving this uh ruby's cube um i know how i can what that's what i can use this camera for let's try this for a second to figure out a good use for this camera i plug it in here and i say oh boy what's going on okay uh if i go new video capture device um do i have this logitech 2 is that it logitech 2 logitech 2 properties uh game capture nope uh whoops um there we go uh okay it's pointed at the ceiling so now i have my rubik's cube here put it up here okay um i really should just stop like i was in the middle of solving this a few weeks ago uh let's see where is the piece that i need it's so weird what's going on oh it's in the wrong place oh i guess looking at it from the bottom is like really the wrong way to look at me solving the rubik's cube let's try looking at it from well i'm really going off my rocker here oh boy what just happened what happened oh here i am uh camera only that what did i hit there we go oh you're seeing my legs and the mess oh no wait ah stop is this better okay here we go 80s music is appropriate this is the last thing i'm going to do to finish off the day two layers done oh oh there we go top side two layers what do i do here i forgot completely forgotten oh my god i've completely forgotten the algorithm for this last part so i forgot how to solve the ruby tube everybody it's been so long oh i completely messed it up that was sad plus my camera is like well this is what i need to do there we go okay we're gonna solve this people it's been so long since i solved one of these why am i getting myself into this this is really sort of pointless oh you can't even see now that'll hold it lower how much i messed it up okay oh amount of practice people i really have to go i don't know why i'm doing this right now i was like waiting for the poll to finish and i thought i'll do this real quick um how's it going oh is there a cat this will be much more interesting let me just show the cat you want to bring me a cat okay here's the cat we'll solve the rubik's cube later all right everybody uh thank you for tuning in uh it's time for me to go what's happening today what's happening this afternoon but i should stop live streaming right yeah okay all right time to go see you later greta she does not want to be with me um i will uh next week i will solve the rubik's cube um thanks everyone for tuning in uh play this uh goodbye song um i hope you enjoyed this live stream today with various stuff uh please join the discord uh if you join the discord um what are the things i'm supposed to say are you just um join the discord uh read the readme stay for at least one week so i can get above that 20 threshold um stay tuned for the new video tutorials that are hopefully coming out soon and uh please submit your issues and pull requests to the coding train live poll and i will see you all next week on side project saturday on the coding train all right good bye everyone always i always forget that this stop this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stock this stop i just stopped this dot song never forget this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here coordinate song autotune and the internet will fix that for me see it with me it's the polaroid song it's cartesian coordination unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids kids the kittens the kittens kittens and kittens and kittens the kittens the kittens and kittens and kids i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and dusty you
