00:00 - (train whistle blowing)
00:00 - - Hello, welcome to a coding challenge!
00:04 - And I can summarize this coding challenge
00:07 - very quickly in one sentence!
00:09 - This is a spinning cube.
00:12 - It is a three dimensional cube
00:14 - that you are seeing on your
two dimensional screen.
00:17 - I am able to create this
three dimensional cube
00:20 - because I am using the P3D renderer,
00:24 - processing, Java based, creative coding,
00:26 - development, platform thing.
00:28 - I can make 3D stuff using
the P3D rendering engine
00:31 - and then functions like box,
and rotate X, and rotate Z,
00:37 - and that is how I get this!
00:40 - But how does this really work?
00:41 - How does the processing
even make this happen?!
00:44 - I am going to do the
most basic, simple thing.
00:46 - I am going,
00:47 - I said one sentence and
I'm like 12 sentences,
00:50 - I'm like 200 hundred sentences in
00:51 - if I'm being perfectly honest.
00:52 - I am going to change this from P3D to P2D.
00:57 - I'm going to eliminate all of
the 3D rendering capabilities.
01:02 - I'm not gonna allow
myself to use any of them,
01:04 - and yet I'm going to
01:05 - recreate exactly the same digitalization.
01:09 - I'm going to do matrix rotations,
01:13 - projections, those sorts of things.
01:15 - So this is not gonna be comprehensive,
01:17 - like how to build a 3D engine
with ray casting, ray tracing,
01:21 - and lighting, and shadow, and
sorts of complicated stuff.
01:26 - I'm gonna just do the basics,
01:27 - just to create this 3D
illusion in 2D really because,
01:31 - because if I can use the P3D,
01:35 - if I can create the 3D illusion
and render it into 2D space,
01:40 - what if I create a 4D shape
01:44 - and then render it into P3D space, right?
01:47 - If I can project a 3D
object into 2D space,
01:50 - there's no reason why I
couldn't project a 4D object
01:53 - into 3D space.
01:55 - (making explosion sound)
01:57 - and then I dunno, I dunno,
my computer's gonna melt,
02:00 - and I'm never gonna make any videos again.
02:02 - But (jokingly yelling)
let's just stick with this!
02:04 - Okay so let's begin coding.
02:06 - So I am going to take out,
02:08 - I'm gonna hit save,
02:10 - and I'm gonna take out
all of this 3D stuff.
02:11 - I'm gonna leave translate,
stroke, strokeweight, noFill.
02:16 - I'm not gonna be able
to use these anymore.
02:18 - I'm not gonna be able
to use these anymore.
02:19 - I'm gonna leave all this,
02:20 - and I'm in P2D.
02:21 - Actually, I'm gonna take out P2D (mumbles)
02:24 - The default renderer is also a 2D engine,
02:27 - so I don't need to actually say P2D.
02:28 - Now, I should also mention that I,
02:31 - in this particular video,
02:33 - I'm making use of a few functions
I've previously written.
02:36 - (laughing) I actually might have a video.
02:39 - I definitely did it on a livestream,
02:40 - so either way in the video
description I'm gonna link to
02:42 - where you can watch me
code all these functions.
02:45 - But what these functions are for
02:47 - are for certain matrix
operations that I'm going to do.
02:51 - Don't worry,
02:53 - I will talk about what
they are when I use them.
02:57 - So the first thing that I wanna do is
02:58 - lemme just get some points on the screen.
03:02 - Hmm, how am I gonna do this?
03:03 - Let me make a,
03:05 - so I'm gonna make pretty heavy
use of the PVector object,
03:09 - and I'm gonna say,
03:10 - I'm gonna make an array of Pvectors
03:13 - that just has four points in it.
03:17 - And I'm gonna say points
index zero is a PVector at,
03:24 - and I'm just gonna build a little square.
03:26 - So I'm gonna say the first
one is like at -50, -50,
03:31 - and then second, third, fourth,
03:36 - is at 50, -50, then 50, 50, then -50, 50.
03:43 - These should be the
four points of a square.
03:47 - So, what I wanna do here now is just say
03:50 - for every vector in points,
03:57 - just draw a point at v.x, v.y.
04:01 - So now, oh but these are.
04:06 - (laughing)
04:07 - The whole point of me doing
is I can't do this, right?
04:09 - Okay, so these are actually gonna be 3D.
04:12 - The point of this is
they're gonna be in 3D.
04:14 - Bear with me for a second.
04:17 - All will come to pass.
04:18 - Those are gonna be 3D points,
04:19 - but right now I haven't
done anything 3D yet.
04:21 - Let's make the stroke
weight quite a bit bigger
04:23 - so I can see them.
04:24 - There we go.
04:25 - So those are my four points.
04:28 - So, first, what I need to do,
04:32 - and actually hmm.
04:36 - I'm not gonna worry about
this part right now.
04:38 - Okay, so, what do I need
to do make a 3D engine?
04:43 - Okay, here's the thing.
04:46 - I'm gonna search for some props.
04:49 - (laughing) Okay, I found some props.
04:51 - I'm actually gonna turn
this light off too.
04:53 - I'm gonna try to do a
demonstration in the dark.
04:57 - This is a 3D object.
04:59 - It is the book A Million Random Digits
05:01 - with 100000 Normal Deviates.
05:05 - The way that a 3D object is rendered
05:09 - on a 2D dimension screen
05:10 - is through something called a projection.
05:12 - That projection you could think of
05:13 - is basically like a shadow.
05:15 - So if I have this book here,
05:16 - and I shine this cellphone flashlight,
05:20 - you can see that there's a
projection onto the wall.
05:24 - It looks like a square.
05:25 - If I rotate this it rotates.
05:28 - If I rotate around the Y axis,
05:30 - well actually I'll have to do this.
05:31 - If I rotated around the Y axis,
05:34 - you can see it starts to become thinner.
05:37 - I can rotate around the
X axis, it does this.
05:39 - So, you know, so this is the idea.
05:42 - I need to create this
same exact (laughing)
05:47 - I need to create that same
exact idea but in code.
05:53 - And the way that that's done
05:55 - is with something called
a projection matrix.
05:59 - So, the point, the 3D point,
06:03 - is actually something like this.
06:04 - It's a matrix that has X, Y, and Z in it.
06:09 - This is actually three rows by one column.
06:13 - This is something that I've gone over
06:14 - in other matrix math videos.
06:16 - Here's kinda a summary of it.
06:18 - A projection matrix, if I'm
projecting into 2D, right?
06:23 - If I'm projecting this 3D
point into a new 2D point,
06:29 - what I need is a projection matrix.
06:31 - Now here's a really
simple projection matrix.
06:38 - This projection matrix
has a one in the X spot,
06:43 - a one in the Y spot.
06:46 - X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, and it has both zeros
06:50 - in this sorta Z column here
of this projection matrix.
06:53 - What this is actually always going to do
06:56 - is give a two dimensional matrix,
06:58 - not two dimensional, sorry,
07:00 - a two column matrix with just the X and Y.
07:02 - This projection matrix
just eliminates the Z.
07:05 - And actually, this will get us pretty far.
07:07 - In fact, this exact matrix is what's used
07:11 - for like orthographic projection.
07:14 - There's all different, stereographic,
07:16 - and all different kinds
of projection matrices.
07:19 - This one is gonna work just fine for us.
07:21 - So, let's put this in our code.
07:26 - Okay, so the first thing that I need to do
07:28 - is I need to create
that projection matrix,
07:30 - and this is actually an easy thing.
07:32 - Now of course if I were doing
this in more sorta robust way
07:36 - I'd probably have like
a matrix math library.
07:38 - I just have a few matrix math functions
07:43 - that are in this tab that I
wrote in a previous video.
07:46 - So, I'm going to say
make a projection matrix,
07:50 - and I'm going to just make it
as a two dimensional array.
07:54 - So one, zero, zero,
comma, zero, one, zero.
07:58 - So this is my representation
08:01 - of a two row by three column matrix.
08:06 - Two row by three column matrix,
08:08 - that is this right here
08:11 - represented as a two dimensional array.
08:12 - Now, what I'm going to do
here is I'm going to say
08:18 - for every point, for every 3D point here,
08:20 - I'm gonna move this over a little bit.
08:23 - So what I wanna do is, okay,
08:25 - so what I wanna do here for
every single 3D point, right?
08:29 - And this was sorta
pointless that I did before.
08:32 - (jokingly laughing)
08:33 - what I wanna do is I
wanna create a Pvector.
08:36 - I'm gonna call it the projected2d vector,
08:40 - and what I'm gonna do
08:41 - is I'm gonna say matrix
multiply the projection times v.
08:47 - So this is what I wanna
do to project a 3D point
08:54 - into 2D I need a projection
matrix which I just made,
08:57 - and then I need to matrix
multiply the projection matrix
09:01 - and the vector.
09:03 - Now, how the math for that
work involves this times this,
09:06 - plus this times this, plus
this times this, goes here,
09:09 - and this times this, plus times
this, plus this times this.
09:11 - I'll refer you to
matrixmultiplication.xyz.
09:14 - That website has a nice visualization,
09:16 - and I've made other videos
09:17 - about how matrix multiplication works,
09:19 - which I've also linked to.
09:20 - I'm just gonna assume that
matrix multiplication works.
09:23 - And you could see how this makes sense.
09:24 - This one leaves us only with the X.
09:27 - This one leave us only with the Y.
09:29 - So now I'm going to then
09:32 - say point projected2d.x, projected2d.Y.
09:40 - I probably could come up
with a better name than that.
09:43 - And now if I run this,
09:44 - same exact thing, right?
09:46 - Because in this case it's
as if the point light
09:50 - and the place that I'm projecting onto,
09:53 - and the thing, they're all
kinda in exactly the same spot.
09:55 - So there's no skewing,
09:56 - there's no skewing of
the sorta prospective.
09:59 - So, if I were to move that light around,
10:02 - and change the projection matrix,
10:05 - different things could happen.
10:06 - But I'm not gonna worry
about that right now.
10:07 - What I wanna do now is see
if I can apply some rotation.
10:15 - Okay, so how do I apply rotation?
10:17 - Well, I know that I could,
10:19 - I could just say like
rotate by angle, right?
10:24 - If I say rotate by angle,
10:26 - processing is gonna do
that transformation for me.
10:28 - But what if I wanna rotate X,
10:31 - rotate around the X axis?
10:33 - I can't do that.
10:35 - I'm getting some sort of
error somewhere or nothing.
10:38 - I mean it should say not
available with this renderer.
10:40 - Oh yeah, rotateX can only be used
10:42 - with a renderer that supports P3D.
10:44 - I need to write my own rotateX function!
10:46 - And guess what I need for that!
10:47 - (bell ringing)
10:48 - Rotation matrix!
10:51 - I think the ding is better after.
10:53 - (laughing)
10:55 - Guess what I need for that!
10:57 - Rotation matrix!
10:58 - (bell ringing)
10:59 - Oh yeah, that was great.
11:00 - That was exactly what I meant to do.
11:01 - (laughing)
11:03 - Okay, so now I am going to
create a rotation matrix.
11:09 - Now how does that work?
11:10 - Luckily for me,
11:12 - I already have this
Wikipedia page opened up.
11:14 - Look at this.
11:14 - A rotation matrix is a matrix that is used
11:17 - to perform a rotate in Euclidean space,
11:19 - and this kinda makes sense, right?
11:21 - Look at this rotation matrix.
11:22 - Have you ever done one of
things where you do polar
11:25 - to Cartesian coordinate transformation,
11:27 - and you take the angle,
11:29 - and you keep increasing the angle,
11:31 - and then you convert
that to X and Y points,
11:32 - and you have this like spiraling thing?
11:33 - I've made videos where I do that.
11:36 - Basically, to rotate in two dimensions,
11:45 - this is all I need.
11:46 - So just for fun, let's first just do this.
11:50 - I'm going to say float,
11:55 - I'm gonna make another,
11:56 - I'm gonna call this rotation,
11:58 - and I'm gonna make another matrix,
12:00 - and I'm gonna do exactly this.
12:01 - It's gonna be two by two,
12:02 - and it's going to be cosine
theta negative sine theta.
12:05 - And I'm calling it angle,
12:07 - cosine angle, negative sine angle.
12:11 - And then it's gonna be,
12:12 - what was it?
12:13 - Sine angle, cosine angle, is that right?
12:24 - So this is, I didn't get this right.
12:25 - There's, this needs a bracket.
12:28 - I dunno what I'm doing here.
12:30 - And this needs a bracket, right?
12:32 - It's a two dimensional matrix.
12:35 - There we go, nope?
12:36 - Semicolon, there we go!
12:37 - So this is my rotation matrix,
12:39 - this is my rotation matrix.
12:41 - So what now, what if I were to say,
12:45 - no, I'm gonna take out this rotateX.
12:47 - Not using the native rotate function,
12:50 - and I'm going to say Pvector
rotated equals matmul,
12:58 - rotation times projected2d.
13:07 - And now I'm gonna draw
the point at rotated.
13:11 - So I am projecting,
13:12 - V is a 3D vector.
13:15 - I'm projecting it into 2D,
13:17 - and then I'm rotating it,
13:19 - just a 2D rotation.
13:21 - And if we run this,
13:22 - okay, what's wrong?
13:23 - Columns of A must match rows of B.
13:26 - Oh, oh boy, I made a
problem. (jokingly crying)
13:33 - Okay, something horrible happened.
13:35 - I got this out, I got columns
of A must match rows of B.
13:39 - I made a mistake in my
matrix multiplication thing.
13:42 - Here's the thing, I'm
trying to be all clever
13:43 - to show you in 2D first.
13:45 - The truth of the matter
is, Pvectors, they're 3D.
13:47 - Even if I'm drawing just the X and Y,
13:49 - there's always that Z component.
13:51 - So I actually need
include this extra column
13:57 - with zeros in it to do this demonstration.
13:59 - So now you can see that's
me doing 2D rotation.
14:03 - And actually, I'm actually
do 3D rotation, right?
14:06 - Because really what
this should be is this.
14:12 - This is, what I would call, XY rotation.
14:18 - I am rotating around the Z axis
14:22 - by, you know, using the
X and Y axes, right?
14:26 - Look at this.
14:27 - Now I'm gonna say,
14:28 - but if I kept scrolling
down this Wikipedia page,
14:32 - we would see this.
14:33 - We would find this right here.
14:36 - This is the one that I'm doing.
14:37 - Rotation Z, right?
14:40 - Oh, I need a one there, of course,
14:42 - not a zero there, very important.
14:43 - I don't wanna lose the Z point.
14:45 - I wanna rotate the X and
Y axes around the Z axis,
14:50 - but I don't wanna lose the Z point,
14:51 - so I need a one there.
14:53 - In the 2D case, oh okay,
so I need this here.
14:55 - So this I'm gonna call rotationZ,
15:00 - and now I'm gonna make some other ones.
15:02 - Let's call them rotationX.
15:05 - And the rotationX is Y and Z.
15:10 - So I need to have my rotation
values in the Y and Z spots.
15:21 - So hard to do this.
15:24 - I should just copy it from somewhere
15:26 - but this will work.
15:27 - And I think this is right.
15:32 - So this should be, right,
15:34 - you can see this is,
15:38 - am I spacing this off?
15:39 - Help me!
15:41 - This was rotationZ, this is rotationX,
15:45 - and let's do one more.
15:48 - Let's do rotationY.
15:50 - So I need to have zero,
one, zero in the middle.
15:55 - The last one will be sine of
angle, zero, cosine of angle,
16:00 - and the first one will be cosine of angle,
16:06 - negative sine of angle,
with a zero in the middle.
16:12 - Okay, so this should be,
16:14 - this should all line up nicely.
16:16 - This is rotationY.
16:19 - Do I have any syntax errors?
16:21 - RotationZ, rotationX, rotationY.
16:25 - Okay, now, (quietly screaming)
so here's the thing,
16:30 - I'm gonna do something terrible.
16:32 - What if I just put, like,
16:33 - if I put rotationZ here,
16:36 - oh I have an error.
16:38 - Oh, I'm missing a comma here.
16:39 - Thank you.
16:40 - So I think I got it everywhere else.
16:43 - Right, that's rotationZ.
16:47 - What if I try instead rotationX?
16:52 - Oh, weird that that's working.
16:54 - I guess, oh!
16:55 - You know why it's working?
16:56 - It's working by accident really,
16:58 - because my Z points,
17:01 - so but I've done something incorrect,
17:03 - but you can see this looks
as if those two points,
17:04 - and I want my angle to move
up a little bit faster.
17:07 - You can imagine this as a plane
17:09 - almost spinning around the X axis.
17:12 - But here's the thing,
17:13 - I should be doing,
17:13 - the projection should happen
at the last moment, right?
17:16 - I should really be rotating first,
17:23 - and then I should project
the rotated vector.
17:28 - And so here, so sorry, projection.
17:37 - For it to be correct, it's
gotta be in this order,
17:42 - because what I need to do
is first rotate and then,
17:45 - it worked by accident
because my Z values are zero,
17:50 - but now let's do something.
17:54 - Let's make eight points.
17:58 - Okay, I'm doing this
in a highly manual way.
18:04 - Let's now have all these be at -50.
18:09 - I wonder if I wanna put them,
18:10 - I think this'll be fine, -50,
18:13 - and then now these all at 50, right?
18:15 - I basically, if you think about it,
18:18 - a point has zero dimensions,
18:20 - a line has two dimensions
18:22 - with two points as the bounding box,
18:24 - a plane, a square, has two dimensions
18:28 - with four lines bounding it,
18:31 - and then a cube is in three
dimensions with six planes,
18:37 - but really I can kinda make the
cube just with eight points,
18:41 - which are the edges,
all those connections.
18:43 - So let me just run this for a second.
18:44 - Oh boy, this works too fast.
18:46 - I didn't want this to work so fast.
18:47 - So now we can see,
18:48 - lemme just go back to rotate Z.
18:53 - And look at this.
18:55 - That looks, now why do
I not see eight points?
18:57 - Because I'm using orthographic projection
19:00 - as if the light is right there,
19:01 - there's no kinda perspective.
19:04 - I'm not moving the light source away
19:06 - to create this kinda
more 3D perspective look.
19:09 - I can't see, when the points
19:12 - are right in front of each other,
19:13 - the shadow projects on
exactly the same spot.
19:15 - But, if I were to do rotate Y,
19:19 - now you can see.
19:20 - You can kinda imagine that
being a cube rotating.
19:23 - And here's now where I can get fancy.
19:25 - I can now say rotated equals
matmul rotationX times rotated.
19:38 - So I'm just gonna do this a couple times.
19:39 - I'm just gonna keeping
rotating by all the different,
19:43 - so I'm gonna do this
as separate operations.
19:45 - Now there's a way I could
probably combine all those,
19:47 - but I'm just gonna do all
those matrix rotations,
19:50 - and here we go.
19:51 - Now we have my cube
spinning along all axes.
19:56 - Now it doesn't look like a cube.
19:58 - Time out, in all of my
like fussing with this,
20:00 - I left an extra zero here.
20:02 - This rotationX should be one, zero, zero,
20:05 - zero, cosine, negative sine,
20:06 - zero, sine, cosine.
20:07 - Alright, so hopefully
that doesn't change much.
20:10 - Eh, still looks right.
20:10 - So that probably was just being ignored.
20:12 - I was ignoring it but I
don't want that in my code.
20:14 - So now we can we've got this rotation.
20:16 - The truth of the matter is I
really wanna draw this as cube.
20:19 - Oh, I wanna draw this as cube!
20:21 - Let me think about this.
20:22 - There's gotta be,
20:23 - perhaps I could manually
connect all the points
20:26 - I wanna connect.
20:27 - Also, this is not the same
size as what I started with.
20:32 - (chuckling)
20:34 - So I'm gonna just replace
every -50 with 100,
20:38 - and every 50 with 100.
20:44 - That should work.
20:46 - Let's make that a bit bigger.
20:48 - There we go!
20:49 - So that's what I had originally,
20:50 - and I also was doing something
with the angles, right?
20:54 - I was like doing like,
20:55 - I don't remember,
20:56 - but I had like angle times
two, angle times two,
20:59 - so I could also vary the
speed of the rotations.
21:02 - This is very silly what I'm
doing right now and pointless.
21:05 - But I just wanted it to match,
21:09 - match more like what I started with.
21:11 - Okay, anyway, so you can kinda see that,
21:13 - and that's why it was moving so,
21:14 - then I had it as like 0.1.
21:16 - Okay, so this should now match
exactly what I started with.
21:19 - Alright, lemme do something
21:20 - that's gonna help us in the long run.
21:22 - What I actually wanna do is
instead of using 50 all in here,
21:26 - I'm gonna change every instance of 50
21:27 - to just the number one.
21:29 - So I'm gonna kinda have
normalized the cube,
21:31 - actually I kinda wanna change it to .5.
21:33 - (chuckling)
21:34 - Instead of one I'm gonna change it to,
21:34 - because I want the sides, the
lines, to be a length one.
21:38 - So, whoops, replace, do I have,
21:41 - oh I have ones in other places.
21:43 - Bad idea!
21:44 - Hold on, I'm gonna change all
the instances of 50 to .5.
21:49 - Okay, so now if I were to run this,
21:54 - you know, I don't see anything here,
21:56 - but very easily what I can do is,
21:59 - at the last moment, I can scale things up.
22:02 - And again, I could do
this with some kind of,
22:04 - I'm just gonna do multiply
each vector by 100,
22:09 - and then I have this.
22:10 - And if I multiply it by 200,
22:13 - then I have this,
22:14 - which more closely matches
what I started with.
22:16 - The angle of rotations are different,
22:17 - but that's no big deal.
22:19 - Okay, I wanted to do that
22:20 - because I also would like
to show you perspective,
22:23 - and I think if all my
coordinates are normalized,
22:26 - that's gonna make it
a little easier to do.
22:28 - But before I show you perspective,
22:30 - let me connect all the edges.
22:33 - I is less than 12, i++.
22:35 - Right, what am I connecting?
22:37 - I'm connecting,
22:40 - let me think about this,
22:42 - I'm connecting,
22:43 - like if I say connect,
22:46 - what did I call the points?
22:48 - Let me just, zero and zero.
22:50 - Let me write a function.
22:52 - Let me write a function called connect,
22:54 - and it gets two Pvectors,
22:58 - and it just draws a line.
23:02 - I'm gonna say strokeWeight(1),
23:04 - and it draws a line between
one and the other, stroke(255).
23:13 - So if I were to say connect,
23:16 - oh and it doesn't get two Pvectors,
23:18 - it gets two integers,
23:20 - and PVector a1 equals,
23:28 - I'm gonna call this i and j.
23:31 - Pvector a = points[I],
23:35 - and Pvector b = points[j].
23:40 - This is like,
23:41 - so I should have a line
between the first two points.
23:47 - How come I don't see that.
23:48 - Oh, wait, wait,
23:49 - yeah, point O.
23:51 - Oh I need to connect,
23:55 - okay, so I'm gonna make this
PVector projected equals,
24:05 - oh I'm gonna make an array
that has eight spots in it.
24:10 - And then, instead of drawing this here,
24:15 - I'm going to say projected,
24:18 - so now I really need to,
24:21 - (breathing in sharply) oh this is fine,
24:22 - int index = 0, I could
just use now a for loop
24:26 - but index++, projected[index]
= projected2d.
24:32 - So I'm gonna put everything in an array,
24:34 - and then I'm gonna say connect
zero, zero, in projected.
24:40 - And then this will be an array of points.
24:46 - And so now this should,
24:50 - where's that line?
24:52 - Let me just make sure.
24:52 - Now if I say for PVector
V in projected, point,
25:02 - I really didn't wanna draw the edges.
25:04 - This is why.
25:04 - I wanted to just leave it at that,
25:05 - leave it a viewer challenge
to draw the edges.
25:12 - Projected2d, projected[index]
= projected2d,
25:18 - index++, PVector v.
25:23 - Where's all that stroke weight stuff?
25:25 - This stuff should be here.
25:32 - Where am I drawing all the points?
25:33 - So, okay, there are the points again.
25:37 - Now, I wanna connect
zero and one. (laughing)
25:42 - Zero and one.
25:43 - There we go!
25:43 - (laughing)
25:44 - Took me forever!
25:45 - So now I'm connecting zero and one,
25:47 - then I wanna connect zero and two.
25:52 - No, zero, then I wanna
connect one and zero?
25:57 - That's the same thing.
25:59 - Connect one and one?
26:01 - No, no, no, one and two?
26:04 - (laughing)
26:05 - This is good trial and error.
26:07 - This is fun!
26:08 - Then I'm gonna connect two and three.
26:10 - I just wanna figure out if
there's an algorithm for this.
26:13 - And right, because this is the plane.
26:15 - This is the first plane.
26:16 - Three and four.
26:17 - Ah I see, this makes sense.
26:19 - Whoop, whoop, whoops.
26:21 - No, three back to zero.
26:24 - That's the first plane.
26:27 - And then the next plane is
the same thing but at the end,
26:32 - which is like four to five, five to six.
26:39 - Oh, no, three to four, four to, right?
26:42 - Because didn't I put the next plane,
26:44 - would be zero, one, two, three, four.
26:46 - No, no, no, no.
26:46 - No, no, no, no.
26:47 - Yes, four to five, five
to six, six to seven,
26:53 - and seven back to four.
26:57 - Okay, so that's that.
26:59 - Now all I need to do is connect,
27:01 - oh, this is easy!
27:02 - So there's definitely
an algorithm for this,
27:04 - 'cause now I wanna connect zero
to four, one to five, right?
27:15 - Two to six.
27:16 - Hopefully the algorithm is
revealing itself to you.
27:19 - And seven to eight.
27:22 - No, no, no, sorry, three to seven.
27:26 - There we go!
27:27 - (claps)
27:28 - There's my cube!
27:29 - (bell rings)
27:29 - I have done it!
27:30 - Now I should really refactor this,
27:33 - and I plan to do that,
27:34 - but right now I think I need
a little bit of a break.
27:39 - Alright, so, actually no I don't.
27:42 - I gotta do it right now.
27:44 - I'm sorry, this video's
gonna be really long.
27:45 - I don't care!
27:46 - I equals zero, i is less than four, i++.
27:51 - So what I'm gonna do, right?
27:53 - There's four sides.
27:55 - I am going to connect i with
i plus one, modulus four,
28:06 - then I also want projected,
28:10 - then I also wanna connect i plus four,
28:14 - and i plus one modulus four, plus four.
28:18 - Let's do that.
28:19 - And then I just wanna
connect i with i plus four.
28:23 - I think that's it.
28:24 - That's three little blocks.
28:33 - Woo-hoo! (claps)
28:33 - I'm so glad that actually worked!
28:35 - (laughing)
28:36 - Okay, so this is connecting the edges.
28:39 - This is gonna really help
when we have to do the,
28:42 - I hope, when we have to do the hypercube,
28:44 - connecting the edges.
28:46 - Okay, I should really go!
28:49 - I only have 10 more
minutes in real life time
28:52 - while I'm recording this.
28:54 - But let's actually add perspective!
28:56 - Let's add perspective.
28:57 - How do you add perspective?
28:58 - (jokingly yells)
28:59 - So the way that you add
perspective. (jokingly yells)
29:04 - Perspective projection.
29:08 - Basically, we're going to add a variable
29:12 - which indicates the distance,
29:15 - remember my ridiculous experiment earlier
29:18 - like about four and a half hours ago,
29:19 - if you are actually watching this video
29:21 - all the way to the end,
29:22 - where I had this light source
29:23 - and I was shining the light source,
29:26 - and you were seeing the
shadow here, that projection?
29:28 - I need a variable which
is the distance away
29:32 - from the object,
29:35 - the surface, that light source is.
29:39 - That's how I get perspective
projection, right?
29:42 - So, to create this idea
of perspective, right?
29:45 - I want to move the light source,
29:46 - or move the camera further away.
29:48 - There's a lot of
different ways to do this,
29:49 - and highly sophisticated methods,
29:51 - but basically I need to
scale the X, Y positions
29:55 - by the depth, right?
29:56 - Objects in this mirror appear
closer than they really are.
29:59 - Like, things that are further
away appear closer in,
30:04 - things that are closer appear further out.
30:08 - So to do that, this projection matrix
30:11 - can't just always be
constants of one and one
30:13 - in the X and Y position.
30:14 - So I'm going to move this,
30:16 - and I'm going to before I project, right?
30:21 - Before I project the final rotated matrix,
30:27 - I need to dynamically calculate
this projection matrix
30:30 - according to the Z value itself.
30:32 - So, one thing that I could do is
30:34 - I could just say float z = rotated.z,
30:40 - and I could like just try
like dividing, dividing by it.
30:48 - I'm sorta scaling it according to that Z.
30:50 - Let's see what that does.
30:51 - Eh, something maybe.
30:53 - It looks all weird and crazy.
30:54 - That's not right.
30:55 - Well, a nice formula for doing this
30:57 - is actually saying one divided by,
30:59 - this is now the distance
basically, the camera distance,
31:03 - the light source
distance, minus rotated.z.
31:06 - So if I put that in here now,
31:10 - and I were to say float
distance = 2, for example,
31:18 - now you can see this looks much more
31:20 - like perspective projection.
31:23 - So this is no longer orthographic,
31:25 - it's more like perspective.
31:28 - You know, again, I'm not saying
31:29 - that I've comprehensively solved
every possible projection,
31:34 - 3D way, with focal length and all sorts
31:37 - of field of view stuff.
31:38 - I'm just doing something kinda basic.
31:40 - This is probably similar
31:41 - to like weak project maybe, I think.
31:44 - But you can see here that if
I change this distance to one,
31:48 - now this object appears much closer.
31:49 - It's more distorted.
31:51 - If I were to change this to 10,
31:53 - wow, it's so far away but
you can see there it is.
31:56 - Those points are little bit too big.
31:57 - Now one thing I'm not doing is
31:59 - changing like the stroke weight
32:00 - to make it seem further or smaller,
32:02 - but you can see I'm just
altering the perspective.
32:04 - Okay, we've done it!
32:05 - (bell ringing)
32:06 - Where's my train whistle?!
32:08 - I need the train whistle!
32:11 - (shoes squeaking)
32:14 - No train whistle for me.
32:15 - I'm gonna reward myself
with a piece of space melon.
32:19 - I have made this coding challenge.
32:22 - So, what can you do?
32:23 - First of all, if you wanna
challenge to yourself,
32:26 - just go make this in four dimensions now.
32:27 - (laughing)
32:28 - But that's what I'm gonna do next.
32:29 - Now that I have successfully
drawn a 3D cube,
32:33 - and just to prove the point,
32:34 - I am in the P2D renderer.
32:37 - The P2D renderer using my own matrix math,
32:42 - and my own rotation matrices.
32:44 - You know, you don't need to do this.
32:46 - I would probably just go
back and always use P3D,
32:48 - but this should let me unlock the fourth,
32:51 - the fifth, the sixth,
the seventh dimension.
32:53 - You know, try making different
shapes other than cubes.
32:55 - Try, you know, you can do weird stuff,
32:57 - like I'd probably get
something like super weird
33:00 - if I just, like let's make
the distance two again,
33:03 - and let's change this negative to positive
33:07 - just for rotationY.
33:09 - And like look what I've got going now,
33:11 - like I could really start
to like distort the world
33:14 - by like just messing
around with these numbers.
33:16 - Like what if I say like
five times cosine of angle
33:19 - down here in rotationY?
33:21 - Boy, that's probably a terrible idea.
33:22 - So what kind of crazy, weird, distorted,
33:25 - rotation perspective things can you do?
33:27 - Can you actually do this with
vertices so you apply fill?
33:30 - Can you think about color?
33:31 - Make some sort of weird, pretend, 3D world
33:36 - that doesn't follow our own
sense of three dimensions
33:41 - by playing with this code,
33:42 - and share that with me on
the comments or on Twitter,
33:46 - and also on thecodingtrain.com,
33:48 - there'll be a link to the webpage
33:49 - where you can submit user-made things.
33:52 - (upbeat music)
33:59 - (bell rings)

Cleaned transcript:

(train whistle blowing) Hello, welcome to a coding challenge! And I can summarize this coding challenge very quickly in one sentence! This is a spinning cube. It is a three dimensional cube that you are seeing on your two dimensional screen. I am able to create this three dimensional cube because I am using the P3D renderer, processing, Java based, creative coding, development, platform thing. I can make 3D stuff using the P3D rendering engine and then functions like box, and rotate X, and rotate Z, and that is how I get this! But how does this really work? How does the processing even make this happen?! I am going to do the most basic, simple thing. I am going, I said one sentence and I'm like 12 sentences, I'm like 200 hundred sentences in if I'm being perfectly honest. I am going to change this from P3D to P2D. I'm going to eliminate all of the 3D rendering capabilities. I'm not gonna allow myself to use any of them, and yet I'm going to recreate exactly the same digitalization. I'm going to do matrix rotations, projections, those sorts of things. So this is not gonna be comprehensive, like how to build a 3D engine with ray casting, ray tracing, and lighting, and shadow, and sorts of complicated stuff. I'm gonna just do the basics, just to create this 3D illusion in 2D really because, because if I can use the P3D, if I can create the 3D illusion and render it into 2D space, what if I create a 4D shape and then render it into P3D space, right? If I can project a 3D object into 2D space, there's no reason why I couldn't project a 4D object into 3D space. (making explosion sound) and then I dunno, I dunno, my computer's gonna melt, and I'm never gonna make any videos again. But (jokingly yelling) let's just stick with this! Okay so let's begin coding. So I am going to take out, I'm gonna hit save, and I'm gonna take out all of this 3D stuff. I'm gonna leave translate, stroke, strokeweight, noFill. I'm not gonna be able to use these anymore. I'm not gonna be able to use these anymore. I'm gonna leave all this, and I'm in P2D. Actually, I'm gonna take out P2D (mumbles) The default renderer is also a 2D engine, so I don't need to actually say P2D. Now, I should also mention that I, in this particular video, I'm making use of a few functions I've previously written. (laughing) I actually might have a video. I definitely did it on a livestream, so either way in the video description I'm gonna link to where you can watch me code all these functions. But what these functions are for are for certain matrix operations that I'm going to do. Don't worry, I will talk about what they are when I use them. So the first thing that I wanna do is lemme just get some points on the screen. Hmm, how am I gonna do this? Let me make a, so I'm gonna make pretty heavy use of the PVector object, and I'm gonna say, I'm gonna make an array of Pvectors that just has four points in it. And I'm gonna say points index zero is a PVector at, and I'm just gonna build a little square. So I'm gonna say the first one is like at 50, 50, and then second, third, fourth, is at 50, 50, then 50, 50, then 50, 50. These should be the four points of a square. So, what I wanna do here now is just say for every vector in points, just draw a point at v.x, v.y. So now, oh but these are. (laughing) The whole point of me doing is I can't do this, right? Okay, so these are actually gonna be 3D. The point of this is they're gonna be in 3D. Bear with me for a second. All will come to pass. Those are gonna be 3D points, but right now I haven't done anything 3D yet. Let's make the stroke weight quite a bit bigger so I can see them. There we go. So those are my four points. So, first, what I need to do, and actually hmm. I'm not gonna worry about this part right now. Okay, so, what do I need to do make a 3D engine? Okay, here's the thing. I'm gonna search for some props. (laughing) Okay, I found some props. I'm actually gonna turn this light off too. I'm gonna try to do a demonstration in the dark. This is a 3D object. It is the book A Million Random Digits with 100000 Normal Deviates. The way that a 3D object is rendered on a 2D dimension screen is through something called a projection. That projection you could think of is basically like a shadow. So if I have this book here, and I shine this cellphone flashlight, you can see that there's a projection onto the wall. It looks like a square. If I rotate this it rotates. If I rotate around the Y axis, well actually I'll have to do this. If I rotated around the Y axis, you can see it starts to become thinner. I can rotate around the X axis, it does this. So, you know, so this is the idea. I need to create this same exact (laughing) I need to create that same exact idea but in code. And the way that that's done is with something called a projection matrix. So, the point, the 3D point, is actually something like this. It's a matrix that has X, Y, and Z in it. This is actually three rows by one column. This is something that I've gone over in other matrix math videos. Here's kinda a summary of it. A projection matrix, if I'm projecting into 2D, right? If I'm projecting this 3D point into a new 2D point, what I need is a projection matrix. Now here's a really simple projection matrix. This projection matrix has a one in the X spot, a one in the Y spot. X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z, and it has both zeros in this sorta Z column here of this projection matrix. What this is actually always going to do is give a two dimensional matrix, not two dimensional, sorry, a two column matrix with just the X and Y. This projection matrix just eliminates the Z. And actually, this will get us pretty far. In fact, this exact matrix is what's used for like orthographic projection. There's all different, stereographic, and all different kinds of projection matrices. This one is gonna work just fine for us. So, let's put this in our code. Okay, so the first thing that I need to do is I need to create that projection matrix, and this is actually an easy thing. Now of course if I were doing this in more sorta robust way I'd probably have like a matrix math library. I just have a few matrix math functions that are in this tab that I wrote in a previous video. So, I'm going to say make a projection matrix, and I'm going to just make it as a two dimensional array. So one, zero, zero, comma, zero, one, zero. So this is my representation of a two row by three column matrix. Two row by three column matrix, that is this right here represented as a two dimensional array. Now, what I'm going to do here is I'm going to say for every point, for every 3D point here, I'm gonna move this over a little bit. So what I wanna do is, okay, so what I wanna do here for every single 3D point, right? And this was sorta pointless that I did before. (jokingly laughing) what I wanna do is I wanna create a Pvector. I'm gonna call it the projected2d vector, and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say matrix multiply the projection times v. So this is what I wanna do to project a 3D point into 2D I need a projection matrix which I just made, and then I need to matrix multiply the projection matrix and the vector. Now, how the math for that work involves this times this, plus this times this, plus this times this, goes here, and this times this, plus times this, plus this times this. I'll refer you to matrixmultiplication.xyz. That website has a nice visualization, and I've made other videos about how matrix multiplication works, which I've also linked to. I'm just gonna assume that matrix multiplication works. And you could see how this makes sense. This one leaves us only with the X. This one leave us only with the Y. So now I'm going to then say point projected2d.x, projected2d.Y. I probably could come up with a better name than that. And now if I run this, same exact thing, right? Because in this case it's as if the point light and the place that I'm projecting onto, and the thing, they're all kinda in exactly the same spot. So there's no skewing, there's no skewing of the sorta prospective. So, if I were to move that light around, and change the projection matrix, different things could happen. But I'm not gonna worry about that right now. What I wanna do now is see if I can apply some rotation. Okay, so how do I apply rotation? Well, I know that I could, I could just say like rotate by angle, right? If I say rotate by angle, processing is gonna do that transformation for me. But what if I wanna rotate X, rotate around the X axis? I can't do that. I'm getting some sort of error somewhere or nothing. I mean it should say not available with this renderer. Oh yeah, rotateX can only be used with a renderer that supports P3D. I need to write my own rotateX function! And guess what I need for that! (bell ringing) Rotation matrix! I think the ding is better after. (laughing) Guess what I need for that! Rotation matrix! (bell ringing) Oh yeah, that was great. That was exactly what I meant to do. (laughing) Okay, so now I am going to create a rotation matrix. Now how does that work? Luckily for me, I already have this Wikipedia page opened up. Look at this. A rotation matrix is a matrix that is used to perform a rotate in Euclidean space, and this kinda makes sense, right? Look at this rotation matrix. Have you ever done one of things where you do polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation, and you take the angle, and you keep increasing the angle, and then you convert that to X and Y points, and you have this like spiraling thing? I've made videos where I do that. Basically, to rotate in two dimensions, this is all I need. So just for fun, let's first just do this. I'm going to say float, I'm gonna make another, I'm gonna call this rotation, and I'm gonna make another matrix, and I'm gonna do exactly this. It's gonna be two by two, and it's going to be cosine theta negative sine theta. And I'm calling it angle, cosine angle, negative sine angle. And then it's gonna be, what was it? Sine angle, cosine angle, is that right? So this is, I didn't get this right. There's, this needs a bracket. I dunno what I'm doing here. And this needs a bracket, right? It's a two dimensional matrix. There we go, nope? Semicolon, there we go! So this is my rotation matrix, this is my rotation matrix. So what now, what if I were to say, no, I'm gonna take out this rotateX. Not using the native rotate function, and I'm going to say Pvector rotated equals matmul, rotation times projected2d. And now I'm gonna draw the point at rotated. So I am projecting, V is a 3D vector. I'm projecting it into 2D, and then I'm rotating it, just a 2D rotation. And if we run this, okay, what's wrong? Columns of A must match rows of B. Oh, oh boy, I made a problem. (jokingly crying) Okay, something horrible happened. I got this out, I got columns of A must match rows of B. I made a mistake in my matrix multiplication thing. Here's the thing, I'm trying to be all clever to show you in 2D first. The truth of the matter is, Pvectors, they're 3D. Even if I'm drawing just the X and Y, there's always that Z component. So I actually need include this extra column with zeros in it to do this demonstration. So now you can see that's me doing 2D rotation. And actually, I'm actually do 3D rotation, right? Because really what this should be is this. This is, what I would call, XY rotation. I am rotating around the Z axis by, you know, using the X and Y axes, right? Look at this. Now I'm gonna say, but if I kept scrolling down this Wikipedia page, we would see this. We would find this right here. This is the one that I'm doing. Rotation Z, right? Oh, I need a one there, of course, not a zero there, very important. I don't wanna lose the Z point. I wanna rotate the X and Y axes around the Z axis, but I don't wanna lose the Z point, so I need a one there. In the 2D case, oh okay, so I need this here. So this I'm gonna call rotationZ, and now I'm gonna make some other ones. Let's call them rotationX. And the rotationX is Y and Z. So I need to have my rotation values in the Y and Z spots. So hard to do this. I should just copy it from somewhere but this will work. And I think this is right. So this should be, right, you can see this is, am I spacing this off? Help me! This was rotationZ, this is rotationX, and let's do one more. Let's do rotationY. So I need to have zero, one, zero in the middle. The last one will be sine of angle, zero, cosine of angle, and the first one will be cosine of angle, negative sine of angle, with a zero in the middle. Okay, so this should be, this should all line up nicely. This is rotationY. Do I have any syntax errors? RotationZ, rotationX, rotationY. Okay, now, (quietly screaming) so here's the thing, I'm gonna do something terrible. What if I just put, like, if I put rotationZ here, oh I have an error. Oh, I'm missing a comma here. Thank you. So I think I got it everywhere else. Right, that's rotationZ. What if I try instead rotationX? Oh, weird that that's working. I guess, oh! You know why it's working? It's working by accident really, because my Z points, so but I've done something incorrect, but you can see this looks as if those two points, and I want my angle to move up a little bit faster. You can imagine this as a plane almost spinning around the X axis. But here's the thing, I should be doing, the projection should happen at the last moment, right? I should really be rotating first, and then I should project the rotated vector. And so here, so sorry, projection. For it to be correct, it's gotta be in this order, because what I need to do is first rotate and then, it worked by accident because my Z values are zero, but now let's do something. Let's make eight points. Okay, I'm doing this in a highly manual way. Let's now have all these be at 50. I wonder if I wanna put them, I think this'll be fine, 50, and then now these all at 50, right? I basically, if you think about it, a point has zero dimensions, a line has two dimensions with two points as the bounding box, a plane, a square, has two dimensions with four lines bounding it, and then a cube is in three dimensions with six planes, but really I can kinda make the cube just with eight points, which are the edges, all those connections. So let me just run this for a second. Oh boy, this works too fast. I didn't want this to work so fast. So now we can see, lemme just go back to rotate Z. And look at this. That looks, now why do I not see eight points? Because I'm using orthographic projection as if the light is right there, there's no kinda perspective. I'm not moving the light source away to create this kinda more 3D perspective look. I can't see, when the points are right in front of each other, the shadow projects on exactly the same spot. But, if I were to do rotate Y, now you can see. You can kinda imagine that being a cube rotating. And here's now where I can get fancy. I can now say rotated equals matmul rotationX times rotated. So I'm just gonna do this a couple times. I'm just gonna keeping rotating by all the different, so I'm gonna do this as separate operations. Now there's a way I could probably combine all those, but I'm just gonna do all those matrix rotations, and here we go. Now we have my cube spinning along all axes. Now it doesn't look like a cube. Time out, in all of my like fussing with this, I left an extra zero here. This rotationX should be one, zero, zero, zero, cosine, negative sine, zero, sine, cosine. Alright, so hopefully that doesn't change much. Eh, still looks right. So that probably was just being ignored. I was ignoring it but I don't want that in my code. So now we can we've got this rotation. The truth of the matter is I really wanna draw this as cube. Oh, I wanna draw this as cube! Let me think about this. There's gotta be, perhaps I could manually connect all the points I wanna connect. Also, this is not the same size as what I started with. (chuckling) So I'm gonna just replace every 50 with 100, and every 50 with 100. That should work. Let's make that a bit bigger. There we go! So that's what I had originally, and I also was doing something with the angles, right? I was like doing like, I don't remember, but I had like angle times two, angle times two, so I could also vary the speed of the rotations. This is very silly what I'm doing right now and pointless. But I just wanted it to match, match more like what I started with. Okay, anyway, so you can kinda see that, and that's why it was moving so, then I had it as like 0.1. Okay, so this should now match exactly what I started with. Alright, lemme do something that's gonna help us in the long run. What I actually wanna do is instead of using 50 all in here, I'm gonna change every instance of 50 to just the number one. So I'm gonna kinda have normalized the cube, actually I kinda wanna change it to .5. (chuckling) Instead of one I'm gonna change it to, because I want the sides, the lines, to be a length one. So, whoops, replace, do I have, oh I have ones in other places. Bad idea! Hold on, I'm gonna change all the instances of 50 to .5. Okay, so now if I were to run this, you know, I don't see anything here, but very easily what I can do is, at the last moment, I can scale things up. And again, I could do this with some kind of, I'm just gonna do multiply each vector by 100, and then I have this. And if I multiply it by 200, then I have this, which more closely matches what I started with. The angle of rotations are different, but that's no big deal. Okay, I wanted to do that because I also would like to show you perspective, and I think if all my coordinates are normalized, that's gonna make it a little easier to do. But before I show you perspective, let me connect all the edges. I is less than 12, i++. Right, what am I connecting? I'm connecting, let me think about this, I'm connecting, like if I say connect, what did I call the points? Let me just, zero and zero. Let me write a function. Let me write a function called connect, and it gets two Pvectors, and it just draws a line. I'm gonna say strokeWeight(1), and it draws a line between one and the other, stroke(255). So if I were to say connect, oh and it doesn't get two Pvectors, it gets two integers, and PVector a1 equals, I'm gonna call this i and j. Pvector a = points[I], and Pvector b = points[j]. This is like, so I should have a line between the first two points. How come I don't see that. Oh, wait, wait, yeah, point O. Oh I need to connect, okay, so I'm gonna make this PVector projected equals, oh I'm gonna make an array that has eight spots in it. And then, instead of drawing this here, I'm going to say projected, so now I really need to, (breathing in sharply) oh this is fine, int index = 0, I could just use now a for loop but index++, projected[index] = projected2d. So I'm gonna put everything in an array, and then I'm gonna say connect zero, zero, in projected. And then this will be an array of points. And so now this should, where's that line? Let me just make sure. Now if I say for PVector V in projected, point, I really didn't wanna draw the edges. This is why. I wanted to just leave it at that, leave it a viewer challenge to draw the edges. Projected2d, projected[index] = projected2d, index++, PVector v. Where's all that stroke weight stuff? This stuff should be here. Where am I drawing all the points? So, okay, there are the points again. Now, I wanna connect zero and one. (laughing) Zero and one. There we go! (laughing) Took me forever! So now I'm connecting zero and one, then I wanna connect zero and two. No, zero, then I wanna connect one and zero? That's the same thing. Connect one and one? No, no, no, one and two? (laughing) This is good trial and error. This is fun! Then I'm gonna connect two and three. I just wanna figure out if there's an algorithm for this. And right, because this is the plane. This is the first plane. Three and four. Ah I see, this makes sense. Whoop, whoop, whoops. No, three back to zero. That's the first plane. And then the next plane is the same thing but at the end, which is like four to five, five to six. Oh, no, three to four, four to, right? Because didn't I put the next plane, would be zero, one, two, three, four. No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. Yes, four to five, five to six, six to seven, and seven back to four. Okay, so that's that. Now all I need to do is connect, oh, this is easy! So there's definitely an algorithm for this, 'cause now I wanna connect zero to four, one to five, right? Two to six. Hopefully the algorithm is revealing itself to you. And seven to eight. No, no, no, sorry, three to seven. There we go! (claps) There's my cube! (bell rings) I have done it! Now I should really refactor this, and I plan to do that, but right now I think I need a little bit of a break. Alright, so, actually no I don't. I gotta do it right now. I'm sorry, this video's gonna be really long. I don't care! I equals zero, i is less than four, i++. So what I'm gonna do, right? There's four sides. I am going to connect i with i plus one, modulus four, then I also want projected, then I also wanna connect i plus four, and i plus one modulus four, plus four. Let's do that. And then I just wanna connect i with i plus four. I think that's it. That's three little blocks. Woohoo! (claps) I'm so glad that actually worked! (laughing) Okay, so this is connecting the edges. This is gonna really help when we have to do the, I hope, when we have to do the hypercube, connecting the edges. Okay, I should really go! I only have 10 more minutes in real life time while I'm recording this. But let's actually add perspective! Let's add perspective. How do you add perspective? (jokingly yells) So the way that you add perspective. (jokingly yells) Perspective projection. Basically, we're going to add a variable which indicates the distance, remember my ridiculous experiment earlier like about four and a half hours ago, if you are actually watching this video all the way to the end, where I had this light source and I was shining the light source, and you were seeing the shadow here, that projection? I need a variable which is the distance away from the object, the surface, that light source is. That's how I get perspective projection, right? So, to create this idea of perspective, right? I want to move the light source, or move the camera further away. There's a lot of different ways to do this, and highly sophisticated methods, but basically I need to scale the X, Y positions by the depth, right? Objects in this mirror appear closer than they really are. Like, things that are further away appear closer in, things that are closer appear further out. So to do that, this projection matrix can't just always be constants of one and one in the X and Y position. So I'm going to move this, and I'm going to before I project, right? Before I project the final rotated matrix, I need to dynamically calculate this projection matrix according to the Z value itself. So, one thing that I could do is I could just say float z = rotated.z, and I could like just try like dividing, dividing by it. I'm sorta scaling it according to that Z. Let's see what that does. Eh, something maybe. It looks all weird and crazy. That's not right. Well, a nice formula for doing this is actually saying one divided by, this is now the distance basically, the camera distance, the light source distance, minus rotated.z. So if I put that in here now, and I were to say float distance = 2, for example, now you can see this looks much more like perspective projection. So this is no longer orthographic, it's more like perspective. You know, again, I'm not saying that I've comprehensively solved every possible projection, 3D way, with focal length and all sorts of field of view stuff. I'm just doing something kinda basic. This is probably similar to like weak project maybe, I think. But you can see here that if I change this distance to one, now this object appears much closer. It's more distorted. If I were to change this to 10, wow, it's so far away but you can see there it is. Those points are little bit too big. Now one thing I'm not doing is changing like the stroke weight to make it seem further or smaller, but you can see I'm just altering the perspective. Okay, we've done it! (bell ringing) Where's my train whistle?! I need the train whistle! (shoes squeaking) No train whistle for me. I'm gonna reward myself with a piece of space melon. I have made this coding challenge. So, what can you do? First of all, if you wanna challenge to yourself, just go make this in four dimensions now. (laughing) But that's what I'm gonna do next. Now that I have successfully drawn a 3D cube, and just to prove the point, I am in the P2D renderer. The P2D renderer using my own matrix math, and my own rotation matrices. You know, you don't need to do this. I would probably just go back and always use P3D, but this should let me unlock the fourth, the fifth, the sixth, the seventh dimension. You know, try making different shapes other than cubes. Try, you know, you can do weird stuff, like I'd probably get something like super weird if I just, like let's make the distance two again, and let's change this negative to positive just for rotationY. And like look what I've got going now, like I could really start to like distort the world by like just messing around with these numbers. Like what if I say like five times cosine of angle down here in rotationY? Boy, that's probably a terrible idea. So what kind of crazy, weird, distorted, rotation perspective things can you do? Can you actually do this with vertices so you apply fill? Can you think about color? Make some sort of weird, pretend, 3D world that doesn't follow our own sense of three dimensions by playing with this code, and share that with me on the comments or on Twitter, and also on thecodingtrain.com, there'll be a link to the webpage where you can submit usermade things. (upbeat music) (bell rings)
