00:00 - welcome back this is I'm picking up
00:03 - right from the previous video or I
00:04 - looked at the match function the match
00:06 - function which is a function that you
00:08 - can call on a string with a regular
00:11 - expression will give you the thing the
00:13 - regular expression matches plus the
00:16 - captured group however if you use the
00:18 - global flag you lose the captured group
00:25 - it only just gives you an array of those
00:27 - matches so if you need to match multiple
00:30 - instances of a regular expression and
00:32 - have captured groups you have to use a
00:34 - function in JavaScript called exec and
00:36 - exec is a function that instead of
00:40 - saying the string matches a regular
00:42 - expression you're saying the regular
00:44 - expression executes string we're really
00:46 - saying execute this regular expression
00:47 - on a string but execute is a function
00:49 - that you call in the regular expression
00:51 - so r dot exec s so these do these over
00:55 - here do basically the same thing
00:58 - s stop match RR dot exec F but exact
01:02 - does a little bit more but the writing
01:04 - the code is a little bit more
01:05 - complicated so let's just call it once
01:06 - and I'm gonna see what happens look what
01:08 - I got I got one one one - two - two and
01:11 - the captured group right I got the full
01:13 - phone number and the first three digits
01:15 - let me call that function again look at
01:18 - that I got the next one let me call that
01:20 - function again
01:21 - I got no so what you can actually do
01:24 - with exact is call it continuously until
01:27 - you get null and in there you have to
01:30 - write you just have to write your own
01:31 - loop to continue to call it and there's
01:33 - some nice really like elegant ways of
01:35 - doing this in like one long loop
01:37 - statement like while this call bop blop
01:39 - not equal no I'm gonna do it in a rather
01:40 - long-winded way just to make it as you
01:43 - know nothing with regular expressions is
01:45 - readable at all to be honest but I'm
01:47 - gonna try to make it as kind of legible
01:49 - and understandable as possible so let's
01:51 - actually do that in the code now so this
01:53 - is the regular expression and I don't
01:55 - want to use the match function anymore
01:58 - instead what I want to do is I want to
02:00 - say match and actually I don't wanna use
02:03 - the word match because that's the name
02:04 - of a function but I'm just gonna say
02:06 - results result I can't think of what to
02:10 - say is the regular expression execute
02:14 - on the string now as long as that result
02:17 - is not equal to no I can do something
02:22 - and then do it again so as long as that
02:24 - result is not equal to null continue to
02:26 - call this again and again and then as
02:30 - soon as it becomes null you're done now
02:31 - what do I want to do what I want to do
02:33 - is say create P result now let's look at
02:40 - what happens here so this is now the
02:44 - algorithm call exec get a result as long
02:48 - as it's not no do something and do it
02:51 - again then do something then do it again
02:52 - as soon as it's no be done with it so
02:54 - now if I come and refresh this page
02:56 - sorry those are mine don't notes that
02:58 - has the code in it I can do this and you
03:01 - can see look what I've got
03:02 - so it actually it's kind of spitting out
03:05 - the array but you can see it's doing
03:06 - this it's giving all of them and if i
03:09 - refresh the page and say and for you
03:11 - know you can see there I've matched
03:16 - everything and I'm retaining the capture
03:18 - group so if all I want to do is show the
03:21 - capture group all I need to do is say
03:23 - what create P result index one because
03:28 - remember the what exact returns to you
03:31 - is an array of all the capture groups
03:32 - Group zero is always the full match then
03:35 - group one then group two etc so I can
03:37 - run this again and I can it submit and
03:39 - you can see I'm just getting what was
03:40 - captured so that's really the basics of
03:42 - using exec I'll show you now that you
03:45 - can actually you can you can write this
03:48 - you can make this shorter I think you
03:50 - can just say while VAR result equals r
03:57 - dot exec s I think I could just do this
04:03 - because this whole thing will evaluate
04:06 - to no let me look at how I wrote it here
04:12 - doesn't yeah yeah that's what that's
04:15 - what I did okay so this whole thing will
04:17 - evaluate to no and it stops and then and
04:20 - I don't need this anymore so I could
04:23 - actually just write it just like this so
04:25 - this is kind of like a shorthand way of
04:27 - writing it which I could also do that
04:29 - should give me the same result really
04:30 - wanted they didn't really want to go
04:32 - over that but I did okay wait over here
04:34 - here we go
04:35 - oh no no syntax error line 21 this is
04:42 - what happens when you go off off the
04:44 - beaten path of it but you didn't intend
04:45 - to do what's wrong here while VAR result
04:48 - equals r dot exec s did that not work
04:58 - okay hold on let me just let me copy
05:00 - paste this are exact s yeah look at this
05:12 - token bar ah
05:21 - okay that might have done something yeah
05:30 - so so for whatever reason I so so this
05:35 - is how you I guess I have to fix that in
05:37 - my notes you've got to create the
05:40 - variable in advance so the weird thing
05:42 - about javascript is very good at
05:43 - evaluating things to true or false
05:46 - so it'll figure out even though this is
05:47 - like a function statement like calling
05:49 - that and and returning something this
05:52 - like if I write this code this code will
05:55 - evaluate to either true or false based
05:57 - or whether it gets null or not okay it's
06:01 - like it's like false eNOS you know
06:03 - truthiness it's kind of like a little
06:05 - bit truth or not truth anyway I'm
06:07 - melting here melting under the the sheet
06:11 - and and pain and happiness and joy and
06:14 - stress and all of that of regular
06:15 - expressions so hopefully you've gotten a
06:17 - little bit about how to use exec in this
06:19 - video and how to be able to use
06:20 - capturing groups but really I'm kind of
06:22 - missing the the main the main squeeze
06:26 - the main event the which is looking at
06:31 - the functions a split and replace so the
06:33 - function split and replace are used with
06:35 - regular expressions for a lot of text
06:37 - processing algorithms in JavaScript and
06:38 - I'll show you those in the next video

Cleaned transcript:

welcome back this is I'm picking up right from the previous video or I looked at the match function the match function which is a function that you can call on a string with a regular expression will

so let's just call it once and I'm gonna see what happens look what I got I got one one one two two and the captured group right I got the full phone number and the first three digits let me call that
