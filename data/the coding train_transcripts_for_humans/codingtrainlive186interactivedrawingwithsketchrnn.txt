05:54 - good morning it is Friday which has been
05:59 - released since last week the day of the
06:04 - coding trade and that is what you are
06:05 - watching live on YouTube I am here my
06:10 - name is Dan Yolo mmm chief maan and I'm
06:15 - here to do some coding stuff that's what
06:19 - happens on the coding train it's a
06:20 - person with the green screen and a
06:22 - laptop and a room with lights that are
06:24 - very warm and new cameras that don't
06:29 - shut off except for last week when they
06:31 - did shut off and I'm hoping that doesn't
06:33 - happen this week because I have a new
06:35 - thermostat that I turned down to make it
06:39 - cooler and it does not feel cooler in
06:42 - here at all currently in fact I don't
06:44 - have a camp roaming camera to show this
06:46 - to you it says it is 78 point one
06:49 - degrees in this room the temperature on
06:53 - the thermostat is set to 70 degrees and
06:55 - in fact in fact I even see one of these
07:01 - little like snowflake icons little
07:04 - snowflake icon that shows that the air
07:07 - is on and over here hmm people are
07:13 - telling me maybe the sound is quiet I'm
07:14 - not sure there's a vent up there you
07:17 - can't see the vent that's the vent
07:20 - there's air coming out it's warm air oh
07:23 - that's warm air that's weird
07:26 - there's another vent over here let's go
07:29 - examine this other vent this is what you
07:30 - two did for right a crazy person talking
07:33 - about the
07:34 - temperature climate change is real
07:36 - people it's getting very warm in here go
07:39 - to the whiteboard now one thing I did
07:41 - which is nice is I changed the settings
07:43 - of this particular whiteboard camera you
07:45 - might have noticed in previous videos
07:47 - that as I walk in the white balance
07:49 - starts to go crazy the focus goes in and
07:52 - out so it's no longer auto focus in fact
07:54 - as I come in here closer I am glory
07:56 - which makes me much better looking but
07:59 - hopefully I've tuned the focus well on
08:01 - this on the whiteboard so as I draw
08:04 - that's where the focus will be also some
08:06 - events here you don't feel any air
08:09 - coming out of them mm-hmm all right so
08:11 - I'm gonna be here anyway I don't my
08:14 - glasses are all like best ugh today
08:19 - they're like there's nuts on them and I
08:21 - can't see this is not a good start
08:31 - highly professional operation we've got
08:33 - going here I do have a thing of buttons
08:36 - I change the cameras and stuff let's see
08:39 - what's happening in the chat hello from
08:41 - Peru
08:41 - it is also 1535 in South Africa so
08:46 - processing or p5.js today alright so let
08:56 - me just get right to the point which is
08:59 - to talk about what today's topic is so
09:01 - today's topic I'm going to look at a
09:03 - particular pre-trained machine learning
09:05 - model called sketch RNN and this is work
09:08 - of researchers at Google which I will
09:12 - reference and point to when I get there
09:15 - so sketch RNN is a model that's trained
09:17 - off of a data set of drawings so I've
09:20 - used it before in previous coding
09:22 - challenges or videos but today I want to
09:27 - program an example where the user draws
09:30 - the user stops drawing and the AI or the
09:34 - computer or the algorithm or the
09:36 - pre-trained machine learning model takes
09:38 - over and predicts what the next stroke
09:39 - should be to create a drawing of
09:41 - something maybe it's a cat maybe it's a
09:44 - rainbow maybe it's unpredictable so
09:46 - that's what I will be building
09:47 - today and by the time I leave which is
09:50 - around two-ish hours from now did I
09:56 - start last week at 9 a.m. remember I did
09:58 - two and a half hours but I have a thing
10:00 - I've got about two hours so that's the
10:03 - time I leave hopefully that's going to
10:04 - be built a couple of the things I want
10:06 - to address first let's see if this works
10:09 - thank you to the sponsor of the coding
10:12 - train livestreams brilliant org
10:14 - brilliant odd org is a website for
10:17 - lifelong learning with a lot of
10:18 - interactive puzzles and full interactive
10:21 - courses that you can learn through doing
10:23 - and you can check it out at brilliant
10:25 - org slash coding train I will come back
10:28 - later in the livestream and look at the
10:30 - daily challenge there's a daily
10:31 - challenge every day I'm brilliant on
10:32 - organ and try to solve it along with you
10:35 - the viewer watching the other thing I
10:38 - want to do is address the swirling
10:40 - controversy around the coding training
10:43 - which is this new series that I launched
10:48 - recently called coding in the Cabana
10:51 - which I'm really excited about that's me
10:54 - and my sunflower shirt which I think I
10:56 - might actually be able to wear I was
10:58 - afraid I couldn't wear the sunflower
10:59 - shirt here due to the green screen and
11:01 - it's got green on it my shoe just came
11:04 - untied well it fix that in a minute but
11:05 - I think that I can and this is a new
11:09 - style of video that I'm doing which I'm
11:11 - recording at home in this little shed
11:15 - which just sounds a little fancy calling
11:17 - a Cabana and I did a video of the more
11:21 - rows it's kind of like my coding
11:23 - challenges but maybe with a slightly
11:25 - more relaxed vibe to it just trying to
11:27 - try out new things and I've already
11:30 - recorded the second one which I guess I
11:33 - am i spoiling it if you don't want to
11:35 - know what it is close your ears like
11:37 - it's not on that off the next minute or
11:39 - skip ahead if you're watching the
11:40 - recording three two one the co-op's
11:44 - conjecture so I'm gonna do a
11:45 - visualization of this thing called the
11:46 - Collatz conjecture inspired by some
11:48 - numberphile videos but there was a major
11:50 - issue with these vit with this video to
11:53 - see if I can find a chalk I love that
11:54 - video but the sound of the chalk is
12:00 - and everywhere in the comments chok chok
12:04 - well I I guess I'd have to keep
12:06 - scrolling down there's a lot of more
12:07 - comments here eventually if I search for
12:09 - chalk or scratch there's a lot a lot of
12:13 - comments about the chalkboard and just
12:15 - to show you what I'm talking about also
12:17 - you couldn't see the chalkboard so we're
12:20 - talking about this thing here this
12:21 - chalkboard here I wanted to have a bit
12:24 - of an analogue feel to drawing and
12:27 - diagramming you know I certainly could
12:28 - use a tablet and that might be something
12:30 - I do in the future
12:31 - the reason why I'm bringing this up is
12:33 - because I used the chalkboard for the
12:36 - second video which I created shot and
12:39 - recorded before getting all those
12:41 - comments so I'm working with coding
12:44 - trained viewer Nathan who is some audio
12:47 - engineering expertise to see if we can
12:49 - lessen that chalk sound at least and
12:51 - then I think what I'm going to attempt I
12:52 - hope to maybe record another one this
12:54 - weekend and kind of doing these on the
12:55 - weekend he's try doing I certainly I
12:59 - could use a tablet or a Wacom board or
13:02 - something something like that but again
13:03 - I want to keep the analog feel for now
13:05 - so I think what I'm gonna try is an
13:07 - overhead camera and just paper and
13:08 - marker on the table so there you go
13:14 - that's my spiel about coding in the
13:17 - Cabana I also haven't figured out and
13:19 - this is something that I've been
13:21 - discussing with violet who is come on
13:24 - board to help me with some of the github
13:27 - repos stuff I don't know if I'll it's in
13:29 - the chat say hello to violet
13:31 - but the coding and the Cabana video
13:33 - currently isn't on the website so I
13:35 - guess that present probably but a lot of
13:38 - people made more rows Vic community
13:41 - contributions so I would like to figure
13:44 - out a way for people to share those
13:45 - maybe there should be another coding in
13:47 - the Cabana page that's different or they
13:49 - just end up here on this page but they
13:51 - have a little like the visual treatment
13:54 - that shows that one of the Cabana videos
13:56 - I don't know open to your suggestions if
13:58 - you have ideas about that the website is
14:00 - a community created project so you're
14:04 - welcome to contribute to it if you're
14:06 - interested in that
14:11 - Simon is alluring to me that if you are
14:13 - part of the coding train member program
14:15 - it's not really good program but I'm
14:17 - calling it back I think it sound very
14:18 - official which you can sign up through
14:20 - the join button on YouTube you will get
14:23 - an invitation into a slack chat slack
14:25 - it's not a slack channel it's a slack
14:28 - workspace which and has various channels
14:30 - in it
14:31 - one of which there's a chat going during
14:32 - this live stream that I'm looking at
14:34 - right now and Simon created a brilliant
14:36 - channel so we can discuss the brilliant
14:38 - problems there that's my spiel is that
14:41 - what I said hey how are you Dan I hear
14:44 - that you were sick
14:45 - ah and Daniel garden Daniel garden
14:48 - where's there's a CJ you Daniel garden
14:52 - should be garden friends I'm surprised
14:55 - you don't have a discord okay so this is
14:59 - something I've been discussing with psy
15:00 - who is the community manager for the
15:02 - coding train and hopefully they're gonna
15:03 - maybe post a poll or get get this
15:07 - discussion going in the slash channel
15:10 - there is a coding train discord that
15:13 - someone you started up I popped in there
15:15 - for like five minutes and then I kind of
15:16 - like got freaked out
15:17 - I've got back in you know I'm old and
15:20 - don't know how these things work
15:21 - the Internet is very confusing to me Oh
15:24 - get off my slack workspace I I don't
15:28 - love slack I mean I like a lot of things
15:30 - about slack I don't love using it for
15:32 - the coding train
15:34 - it's the messages aren't archived it's a
15:38 - closed space I mean I'm making that
15:41 - decision to make it a closed space but I
15:44 - don't really have the budget to pay for
15:47 - the sort of like verge it's like five
15:49 - dollars per user for a month which we're
15:51 - sort of defeat I suppose I suppose I
15:53 - could maybe do that if that is what the
15:55 - community thinks it's best I could
15:56 - figure out a way to do that but anyway
15:58 - so I've been thinking about switching
16:00 - over to discord and one idea is to you
16:03 - take over that unofficial disk or maybe
16:05 - make a separate one or I don't know
16:06 - there could be a discord than anybody
16:08 - can join the with like certain channels
16:10 - that are just for the members I really
16:12 - don't know what makes the most sense
16:13 - here so I look to you the community to
16:16 - help advise me on this and
16:18 - speak speak up and voice your thoughts
16:20 - about how the community can be
16:23 - accessible and inclusive and welcoming
16:26 - to everyone and that's something that's
16:28 - a really big priority for me and one of
16:30 - the things that I've learned with
16:31 - dealing with online communities is you
16:33 - can't just say that and can't just make
16:35 - things that people can sign up for you
16:37 - have to be very intentional about ways
16:39 - of inviting people in and and and
16:41 - fostering that kind of environment so
16:43 - hopefully I'm doing a good job at that
16:46 - I'm sure there are things that I'm doing
16:48 - not well and I and you should never be
16:50 - should always feel empowered to send me
16:53 - a message and let me know about how the
16:55 - community feels for you okay switching
17:01 - to discord is cheaper discord with
17:04 - member channel says Ben's what what
17:07 - about Facebook I'm not a fan not a fan
17:11 - of Facebook I do have a Facebook account
17:13 - I kinda know I would like to pretend
17:16 - that I never look at it mostly true but
17:19 - I think I do catch myself lurking in
17:21 - there from time to time there is a
17:22 - coding train Facebook page that doesn't
17:25 - get a lot of attention but it could be
17:26 - something I use more but I don't think
17:28 - that the Facebook groups is the right
17:31 - mechanism for the community to interact
17:33 - with each other that I feel pretty clear
17:36 - on okay Loch Ness co-writes I'm in the
17:41 - discord okay that's good to know
17:46 - TMC writes its the chalk itself that's
17:49 - weird and all high tech so Loch Ness
17:53 - feel free if the discord at the moment
17:55 - is an official discord I you know I
17:58 - don't have any oversight or purview in
18:01 - it it's people have self-organized to
18:04 - chat and talk about the coding train
18:05 - which I love that that's happening so Co
18:08 - you should feel free to share it and we
18:10 - can you know whoever I don't know if
18:11 - there were some administrators of that
18:13 - discord want to reach out to me to talk
18:15 - about if we want to make I to make that
18:16 - more of an official thing and yes I mean
18:20 - there's so many opportunities to do BOTS
18:22 - and interface with it I've so much that
18:23 - I want to do to upgrade my streaming but
18:27 - the truth of the matter is because I
18:28 - also have a full-time job
18:32 - I really don't I don't spend the amount
18:35 - of time on the coding tray that maybe
18:36 - other people who are doing content
18:38 - creation and live-streaming full-time
18:40 - are for better or worse that's just the
18:42 - reality and I am trying to hire more
18:46 - people to help me with this to expand
18:48 - the the feature set of what I'm doing as
18:51 - well as figuring out new ways to do
18:54 - stuff like create the content create
18:58 - this new coding the Cabana series from
19:00 - home but some things that I want to do
19:02 - just off the top of my head that just to
19:04 - mention and people can remind me about
19:05 - those are I want to get interstitial
19:08 - animations for starting and ending and
19:10 - taking breaks and that sort of thing
19:13 - having more BOTS that are kind of doing
19:17 - moderation and the chat or just that are
19:19 - fun and playful that can happen in the
19:21 - chat whether it's their discord or the
19:22 - YouTube chat that stuff I want to do I
19:24 - am working to launch a new merchandise
19:26 - store with standard standard is a
19:28 - company that helps out creators they're
19:32 - really a community of creators and they
19:34 - help with sponsorships and merchandise
19:36 - stores and things you can check them out
19:38 - at standard TV they also have a new
19:41 - streaming system called nebula which you
19:43 - should definitely check out and I'm some
19:45 - of my content is on there and I'm
19:46 - thinking about new ways to put content
19:47 - on there as well but but once we get the
19:51 - new standard store up and running then
19:54 - I'm gonna have new rewards for people to
19:57 - sign up for members and patrons and that
19:59 - kind of thing so that's just taking a
20:00 - very long time and if you're curious
20:02 - have questions about that you can reach
20:04 - out to community managers I also if you
20:08 - tweet at the coding train on Twitter
20:10 - that's on Saipan adjust that account and
20:12 - also on Instagram the Instagram has
20:14 - changed it is now instagram.com slash
20:19 - the coding dot train so this is the
20:22 - coding train Instagram also run by Sai
20:25 - and you can just sort of check out stuff
20:28 - that's being posted there I'm hoping
20:29 - that we can I can do more with sharing
20:32 - your work that people who are watching
20:33 - and making things on Instagram and
20:35 - that's something I'm trying to set up
20:36 - some new processes for alright
20:40 - know what else do I've got to say Oh
20:44 - also you should follow my cat's on
20:45 - Instagram mango and let's check on let's
20:47 - check in on that mango and goose look at
20:51 - this there we go
20:55 - [Music]
20:57 - this is very cute that's also Greta and
21:01 - this is Evie Greta and Evie look at
21:04 - those ears have you ever seen a cat with
21:06 - like foxy ears like that they're pretty
21:08 - amazing they're kittens I love them
21:12 - they're super fun you can follow them on
21:15 - Easter ah I knew there was a reason
21:18 - we're gonna make drugs of cats alright
21:23 - let's have a little fun I should
21:24 - probably do this no you know what I'm
21:26 - gonna take a break I want to mention a
21:28 - coating trained viewer Redfoo who has
21:31 - created a game called noisy food I oh
21:33 - and actually did a livestream about it
21:36 - Redfoo apparently learned to code from
21:39 - watching a lot of my videos also
21:41 - shoutout to coding garden with CJ the
21:45 - game that Redfoo made I believe that
21:47 - back end was I gotta answer this
21:52 - question from Jonas or Eunice in a
21:54 - second the the back end of red Foos game
21:59 - noisy foo was created from based on
22:02 - tutorials from CJ excellent coding
22:04 - channel if you want to find a channel
22:07 - that livestreams really often I mean I
22:08 - can't speak for CJ don't know what his
22:10 - future plans are but I see a pop up of
22:13 - almost every day of a livestream from CJ
22:15 - so I highly recommend you check out
22:17 - coding garden with CJ alright so check I
22:21 - maybe I will come back and play this
22:26 - game a little later let's just play it
22:28 - once right now just for fun oh oh oh oh
22:36 - you know here's the thing actually I
22:40 - gotta get a certain sound effect to
22:42 - happen so I got to change my system
22:44 - preferences here and I got to go under
22:45 - sound and I got to change this to multi
22:49 - output device so I think now you should
22:52 - hear the audio from the
22:54 - let's just see why did that come through
22:58 - it should have let's try one more time
23:01 - [Music]
23:04 - you get like a slightly better score
23:06 - here don't bump bump ow that makes me so
23:16 - happy I'm saying it oh my kids are very
23:21 - tired of me talking about this game
23:23 - noisy foo leaderboard let's see where am
23:28 - I here coding train coding train
23:33 - hello coding train your ranking is 58 Oh
23:37 - dare you to try to beat my high score
23:40 - here coding train I got a high score a 2
23:42 - to take that David is writing Schiffman
23:48 - did you see that I beat your score yes I
23:50 - think almost everybody on here is beaten
23:51 - might score there are few people who are
23:52 - lower but have fun with this I had a lot
23:56 - of fun with this check out
23:57 - Redfoo I don't think Redfoo needs me to
23:59 - promote his stuff but check it out it's
24:02 - a lot of fun maybe I'll try to play in a
24:04 - little more later ok
24:08 - holy if only I could play and dance to
24:16 - some of red foods music without getting
24:18 - like the YouTube copyright engine
24:22 - spinning that would be kind of fun I'm
24:24 - sorry I'm sorry For Party Rocking
24:26 - that's all I have to say now my glasses
24:34 - by the way I'm now realizing really
24:35 - could use an upgrade let's move on to
24:41 - the topic of today so ah give me a
24:48 - minute here to pull up some links that I
24:50 - want to refer to
24:52 - Oh
24:57 - [Music]
25:14 - ukulele tutor submissions so um Lokesh
25:21 - writes can you react to ukulele tuner
25:23 - submissions so I think I did a bunch of
25:27 - those already I don't know that a lot of
25:28 - new ones have come in maybe Lokesh I
25:30 - don't know maybe you you posted a new
25:32 - one in Alexander this if you if you're
25:35 - really looking for the drawing with
25:36 - sketch or an end content and that's all
25:38 - you want I might suggest waiting for the
25:40 - edited version that will come out my
25:42 - process has gotten a little bit slower
25:44 - there's some good things about that and
25:46 - some not-so-great things about that but
25:47 - that will come out soon but most of the
25:50 - live stream is yes me wasting your time
25:53 - that it's a 100% accurate tune out good
25:57 - it's a beautiful day in New York City
25:59 - I'm training for the marathon exercise
26:02 - go outside play some music meditate all
26:05 - of these things are probably more
26:07 - valuable uses of your time than this if
26:09 - you want the tutorial wait for the
26:11 - edited version I would say I look caleb
26:15 - is eating oatmeal oatmeal my breakfast
26:18 - of choice big fan big fan oatmeal
26:21 - oatmeal huge fan oatmeal just huge fan
26:24 - oatmeal you Tran I was responding oh you
26:30 - clearly tuner but I did I'm glad that
26:32 - you mention that because let's find the
26:35 - ukulele tuner video I got to work on my
26:41 - SEO apparently oh boy coding train we're
26:46 - gonna get there there we go
26:49 - because I do want to mention a comment
26:51 - that came in recently which was really
26:52 - helpful to me let's try maybe sorting by
26:57 - newest first
26:59 - here we go so this is from a wisp chart
27:03 - interesting name
27:06 - from from on YouTube and wispy art
27:12 - rights one thing that I need to point
27:15 - out let's see is that your detection of
27:18 - closest note is not working properly
27:20 - because notes are existing in sense
27:23 - scale 100 cents per note 1,200 cents per
27:27 - octave while you are trying to operate
27:29 - in frequency scale Hertz the problem is
27:31 - that relation B frequency scale note
27:33 - scale is not linear so closest note by
27:35 - frequency designed equal closest note by
27:37 - sense distance so it sounds like from
27:40 - that description which you know I'm
27:41 - assuming is accurate wispy art sounds
27:44 - knowledge bonus writing in a thoughtful
27:45 - manner but I mean like fact check this
27:48 - and I'm sure people in the chat might be
27:49 - able to offer their thoughts as well but
27:53 - that if I apply some additional math in
27:56 - terms of this values that are coming out
27:58 - of the machine learning model and think
28:01 - about this other scale then I might be
28:04 - able to have a more effective
28:06 - interaction and visualization of how
28:08 - close I am to the correct note here is
28:11 - how and so wispy art maybe has made
28:14 - their own version in Scala skaila I
28:18 - don't notice that it's another
28:19 - programming language and then here is a
28:21 - live pitch detector that also uses CREP
28:23 - so let's look at this and see how this
28:27 - one works
28:28 - I say allow and let's let's get the
28:33 - ukulele here well this doesn't appear to
28:46 - be working
28:50 - [Music]
28:52 - why are you not working you're a very
28:58 - nice ladies by the way this was not in
29:14 - tune I didn't ever Ellis strings were
29:16 - left over from last week that was my
29:18 - little improvisation I don't know why
29:21 - but I'll investigate this later but
29:24 - that's something that I would love to
29:25 - address or think about and thank you so
29:28 - much you know I don't catch these days
29:29 - I'm not catching all the comments that
29:31 - are on YouTube but I try to keep a look
29:33 - and every once in a while something
29:35 - really thoughtful and helpful comes in
29:37 - and thank you to that user interaction
29:42 - Oh an assignment is telling me something
29:44 - I don't know what Simon's telling me did
29:46 - I not do something correctly click click
29:50 - click hello hello click click click user
29:52 - interaction click click click alright
29:56 - alright but I want to move on because I
29:58 - want to get to what I the topic of the
30:01 - day
30:04 - [Music]
30:38 - [Music]
30:45 - [Music]
30:58 - [Music]
31:30 - hold on everyone
31:32 - I'm getting an important message Simon
31:34 - thank you for the reminder about the
31:35 - user interaction and understand what
31:36 - you're saying now
31:39 - matthew is pointing out that maybe the
31:41 - focus is a little bit fuzzy and I think
31:43 - it is I think that let me see let me see
31:49 - how I can best fix this by the way I did
31:54 - a little investigation and it appears
31:56 - that there is a way for me to I'm using
31:58 - these sony alpha 7 3 cameras and that
32:03 - appears and by the way I think this one
32:05 - went off well that's not good it's
32:08 - getting hot in here so I believe there's
32:19 - a way that I can remote control these
32:20 - cameras from through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
32:24 - which if there's an app or even from the
32:26 - computer I could adjust the focus and
32:27 - white balance and that kind of thing but
32:30 - what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going
32:32 - to put the train whistle here which is a
32:35 - pretty far back approximately where I
32:38 - stand
32:39 - Elizabeth maybe that then let's just put
32:44 - it here no this is gonna work I'm tryna
32:46 - I last week I had the mug and I could
32:48 - focus on I think what I could do is I
32:50 - could just pull my laptop back further I
32:53 - do want to fix the focus what do I have
32:57 - I have a book of random digits up here
32:59 - this will work this is like by accident
33:02 - I am buzz marketing a product that I
33:04 - don't mean but I really like it but this
33:06 - is not an official sponsor but I can use
33:08 - this to do the focus so this is about
33:10 - more like where I'm standing then the
33:13 - actual laptop screen so I think if I go
33:15 - and adjust the focus on that give me a
33:18 - second here I'm walking over to the can
33:20 - this is a one-person operation here how
33:23 - to focus on focus I can even go a little
33:26 - past it because I'm a little bit further
33:28 - behind it that should be better how's
33:34 - this look better better worse better
33:38 - worse if I move back I think this is
33:40 - better I think this is better yes
33:45 - [Music]
35:08 - [Music]
35:18 - [Music]
35:24 - [Music]
35:34 - I hope Alexander is not continuing to
35:37 - watch hope they've been outside 96,000
35:42 - 120 you know I think I'm on the same
35:43 - page over time let's go for the whoo
35:45 - let's read some today on the coding
35:48 - train Gaussian deviance
35:56 - [Music]
36:01 - two point six five four that's a
36:06 - negative negative two point six five
36:07 - four negative point three one two point
36:10 - one seven zero negative 1.645 point zero
36:16 - seven nine point four one four point
36:20 - five seven nine point three four five
36:23 - point four seven two five one point five
36:45 - three one point one point two six eight
36:53 - one point four nine two negative three
36:56 - points them thank you for those of you
37:04 - who tweeted at me some collective
37:06 - collector's item original prints of this
37:09 - book I'm kind of afraid to like press
37:13 - the prime I don't mind most of them are
37:15 - for sale for like five hundred six
37:17 - hundred dollars and this to me feels
37:19 - like a purchase well worth it in terms
37:23 - of two things my coding trained hordes
37:27 - of cash but I feel that it's a little
37:31 - bit unreliable what sort of condition
37:35 - it's in some one of them says pages are
37:37 - missing one says it's like a third
37:39 - printing so I need to do some more
37:42 - research here but as some of you pointed
37:45 - out that the over the weekend or
37:51 - yesterday a couple days ago the channel
37:53 - hit still here nine hundred thousand
37:56 - subscribers which is kind of nuts and so
38:00 - getting there getting there to that you
38:03 - know moment of that's nice thing to sort
38:06 - of celebrate or enjoy I don't think we
38:08 - should optimize our lives towards
38:10 - subscribers there's
38:12 - more important things I would be happy
38:13 - if it stopped right now and I was you
38:16 - know just bringing people into the
38:19 - community who wouldn't otherwise who
38:20 - would like to learn to code who didn't
38:22 - have their own otherwise have an
38:23 - opportunity that's more meaningful but
38:25 - you know it's happening and so I could
38:27 - it makes sense okay good
38:29 - and I really would like to have that
38:31 - collector's item original print so be on
38:35 - the lookout do a little internet
38:37 - research if you got five minutes tweet
38:38 - at me if you find if you if you feel
38:40 - like you found something that's really
38:42 - the the one I should I should just press
38:45 - that button click that button especially
38:48 - if it's like some kind of local
38:51 - community bookstore that happens to have
38:52 - a copy as opposed to just you know blah
38:57 - blah blah ah jonas asks again why are
39:00 - you on the front page of processing so
39:02 - first of all that video on the front
39:04 - page of processing is a very out of date
39:06 - and I feel slightly embarrassed by it I
39:07 - mean the video is fine but I feel
39:09 - slightly embarrassed being there on the
39:11 - front page with a pretty out-of-date
39:12 - video so I think it actually would be
39:13 - nice to make a new video for the home
39:15 - page reprocessing anybody want to help
39:17 - work on that that's a thing but I am
39:21 - director or administrator on what the
39:23 - right term to use is of the processing
39:25 - Foundation which is a nonprofit
39:27 - organization that organizes events and
39:31 - does initiatives and educational
39:34 - initiatives and community initiatives
39:36 - around open source and creative coding
39:39 - and so I've been involved with the
39:41 - processing project since around 2003 I
39:43 - am I know means one of the creators of
39:46 - processing nor am I born of really the
39:47 - maintainer the processing I'm just an
39:49 - enthusiastic supporter and participant
39:53 - in the processing community and happened
39:55 - to be there on the homepage okay we got
39:58 - to get started with this before that
40:00 - everything starts to go to crud
40:07 - we're gonna do this are we gonna do this
40:09 - in the p5 web editor yeah why not
40:17 - how am I feeling about the p5 web editor
40:19 - today I think I can make this happen
40:24 - interactive drawing with sketch Arnott
40:46 - okay could you increase the volume
40:50 - you're talking is a bit quiet so nobody
40:53 - else has said that
40:54 - thank you for noting that MX and but I'm
41:00 - afraid to increase the volume because
41:02 - sometimes when I do that in the
41:03 - recording there's clipping or peaking
41:06 - and so I'm gonna assume that maybe you
41:11 - that that's not a universal feeling but
41:14 - please let me know particularly in the
41:16 - slack channel if which I can catch those
41:19 - messages a bit more quickly if there are
41:20 - any issues alright alright I'm about to
41:31 - get started
41:32 - what's it so it's only 40 minutes in by
41:34 - the time I code well how's this month
41:36 - this is crazy so this is the mug you
41:38 - might remember this infamous mug and the
41:41 - keying is so much better this is a green
41:43 - mug but it's a slightly different shade
41:45 - of green that the keying is actually so
41:49 - much more precise in this new studio
41:52 - that I'm recording it I am 3 decibels
42:01 - less than the old set up I am happy to
42:07 - turn it louder but I am concerned it's
42:15 - not the nice thing is that can always
42:17 - get turned up in when the edited version
42:19 - happens well let's let me let me try
42:26 - something
42:27 - let me tie my shoe enjoy this dot as
42:31 - always I always forget to this stop
42:41 - Oh
42:48 - [Music]
42:56 - [Music]
43:13 - [Music]
43:36 - [Music]
44:30 - thank you everybody my mic was off I'm
44:32 - gonna wait till everybody realizes that
44:35 - I figure that out and I was playing with
44:39 - the audio I know this sounds is off the
44:41 - sounds off have to wait about thirty
44:42 - seconds now yes thank you
44:47 - CJ the microphone is muted I just don't
44:55 - I want to wait till the messages stop
44:57 - coming in telling me that okay and now
45:07 - people are telling me it's too quiet
45:08 - okay sounds good now here we go ready
45:12 - everybody ready hello and welcome to a
45:20 - coding challenge drawing with the
45:23 - computer with an AI whose buki Halloween
45:26 - [Laughter]
45:28 - no Halloween no Halloween references
45:31 - those don't those aren't very evergreen
45:33 - although it is about time to watch my
45:35 - arrow [ __ ] videos again hello and
45:43 - welcome to a coding challenge
45:44 - interactive drawing with the computer so
45:47 - what you are looking at right here is a
45:49 - demo from the magenta project this is
45:52 - the sketch RNN demo and what's happening
45:54 - here is I the a person is can walk up to
45:58 - this computer machine start drawing
46:02 - whoops let me clear one more shot
46:08 - when we're shot it's 80 just someone you
46:10 - know it's over 80 degrees the thermostat
46:15 - is on it's set to 70 degrees take three
46:34 - hello and welcome to a coding challenge
46:38 - interactive sketch are an N drawing you
46:48 - realize that this is how I just
46:50 - basically spent my entire day just like
46:52 - saying stuff trike again over and over
46:54 - again hello and welcome to a coding
47:00 - challenge drawing with sketch RNN now
47:02 - you might be wondering what sketch are
47:04 - an N that's ok that's good if you don't
47:06 - know what it is you're in the right
47:07 - place I'm going to try at best but my
47:10 - drive try my best to explain sketch RNN
47:12 - and give you some background reading
47:15 - material that you can look into to do a
47:16 - deeper dive and then make a project like
47:19 - this one right here I'm going to attempt
47:20 - to recreate this exact project so this
47:23 - is a demo on the magenta magenta is a
47:25 - project around machine learning ai and
47:28 - art from Google research and this is a
47:31 - project where you the user or me right
47:34 - now can't clear the screen you can draw
47:36 - I'm gonna draw like a little circle here
47:38 - and another little like this I'm gonna
47:40 - draw a little tail and then see if the
47:42 - computer can pick up where I left off
47:44 - and continue drawing a cat and you can
47:47 - see it's doing this over and over again
47:48 - I can also switch to say a pineapple
47:52 - this will be fun and I can hit clear and
47:55 - I can maybe I can start the pineapple
47:56 - and see oh look at that see what comes
47:59 - next
47:59 - Wow like magic but it's not magic this
48:03 - is machine learning so if you want the
48:08 - [Music]
48:10 - I think as soon as it gets to be 80
48:17 - degrees is when this happens let's see
48:22 - if the focus at least stays today one
48:30 - thing I could do is to focus even the
48:35 - focus doesn't appear to have stayed why
48:37 - does the focus even like die
48:41 - I am very out of focus today's coding
48:45 - train I need a like brilliant two poster
48:48 - I can just put up here you know new
48:54 - cameras they don't go to sleep all this
48:57 - work and I am just destined destined to
49:01 - never be able to live stream without
49:03 - cameras that power themselves off this
49:08 - is actually worse than it was before at
49:10 - least before it happened on a schedule
49:12 - and the focus didn't get lost one thing
49:17 - I'm gonna do just briefly is I'm gonna
49:20 - open the door I don't know if this door
49:23 - is gonna make its way and get some cool
49:24 - air in here a little bit crazy that I'm
49:29 - doing this because now I am actually
49:32 - live-streaming with the door propped
49:35 - over anybody walking by in the hallway
49:38 - hello it's early enough in the morning
49:41 - that there aren't too many people here
49:42 - but I can feel the air coming in woo woo
49:48 - human rights the pre-show dance was too
49:50 - hot for the camera I hopefully the air
49:54 - coming in here is going to help this by
49:56 - the way I'm not I will not be back live
49:58 - streaming next Friday without this being
50:00 - fixed so hopefully I can get this
50:03 - resolved I'm just gonna let some air
50:05 - come in here actually
50:06 - and maybe I'll get a maybe I'll refill
50:12 - my coffee that's always a good idea
50:16 - [Music]
50:29 - I'm gonna keep the mic on this is a bad
50:31 - idea but you're gonna hear me talking as
50:33 - I go over to the kitchen and I should
50:37 - probably just get some ginger tea
50:38 - we usually switch the ginger tea around
50:40 - the lemony
50:42 - [Music]
50:49 - [Music]
51:19 - [Music]
51:27 - [Music]
51:34 - maybe this was like a snowflake here we
51:50 - go you wanna do is
52:13 - I'm gonna also let the camera the offer
52:21 - you have a fan in there
52:23 - no but clearly that would help I think
52:39 - if I leave that camera off for a little
52:41 - bit
52:42 - [Music]
53:16 - everybody just take a little break so
53:27 - copper asks how old is the camera it's
53:29 - brand new it is a sony alpha 7s I can
53:36 - move over to here for a second I turned
53:39 - the lights off in this room the lights
53:41 - are LED lights they really shouldn't eat
53:43 - up the room so much but I think the
53:44 - power supply's get kind of warm go
54:02 - quickly look and see if there's a fan
54:04 - somewhere on the floor here I'll be
54:07 - right back I'm gonna leave my mic on I
54:08 - know it might actually that's dangerous
54:10 - cuz if I go too far the wireless
54:13 - connection might start to make weird
54:14 - noise and so let me mute them I'm gonna
54:16 - mute the mic and I will be right back
54:19 - I'm gonna look for a fan I'll just leave
54:23 - it here drawing a pineapple
54:30 - there was the pineapple pineapple
54:34 - pineapple there we go
54:45 - all right and then I'm gonna put this
54:47 - music back on sorry everybody
54:49 - I'll be back I'm looking for a fan
54:54 - [Music]
55:15 - [Music]
55:22 - [Music]
55:52 - [Music]
56:00 - [Music]
56:42 - [Music]
57:05 - well it's already cooled down just 78
57:08 - degrees in there so where does pineapple
57:13 - ever I'm gonna power the camera back up
57:22 - [Music]
57:35 - there is someone is looking for a fan
57:41 - we're gonna knock on the door
57:46 - [Music]
58:16 - [Music]
58:26 - [Music]
58:32 - [Music]
58:54 - [Music]
59:07 - I'm gonna try to move on all right I'm
59:16 - very sorry about this I'm gonna push
59:19 - through and see if I can get this
59:21 - project completed I have a little over
59:24 - an hour we're just not good I'm also
59:28 - going to take about a half an hour I'll
59:31 - take a break and hopefully the cameras
59:33 - are gonna comply with me we got it down
59:35 - to 77 degrees dropped by three points
59:38 - just opening the door and during the
59:39 - lights off for a few minutes and maybe a
59:44 - fan will arrive okay all right here we
59:52 - go whoa that's an interesting pineapple
60:04 - it's really it's particularly sad
60:06 - because I lost all the momentum and like
60:09 - what I was talking about but it'll get
60:11 - edited together again somehow so what
60:18 - what did I last say I'm you know what
60:20 - I'm not gonna worry about it I'm just
60:21 - gonna random repeating myself so I can
60:23 - get moving here
60:24 - I'm so sorry everybody so sketch on
60:34 - sketch RNN is a pre train is it
60:38 - sketch RNN is a machine learning model
60:40 - that was trained on drawings drawings of
60:43 - a lot of different things
60:44 - like this pineapple here the data set
60:49 - that was used to train it is a data set
60:52 - called the quick draw data set which has
60:54 - about 50 million drawings in it I
60:56 - believe in or around 300
60:58 - I think it's 384 but I'm not really sure
61:07 - the sketch RNN was trained on a data set
61:10 - of drawings that draw that data set is
61:12 - from the Google quick draw data set so I
61:16 - really I lost all my momentum and energy
61:19 - I should just play like the noisy food
61:24 - game or read some random numbers but I
61:25 - got a push forward overheating is a
61:29 - common problem with the Sony a7
61:31 - room-temperature shouldn't be the
61:33 - problem right smacks do you think max
61:35 - that just having like a small fan that's
61:37 - pointed at the camera would help I mean
61:45 - the whole point of these cameras is to
61:48 - yeah I don't know all right
61:50 - I'm sorry I got I got a I gotta go got a
61:53 - move on okay the quick-draw dataset has
61:56 - millions and millions of drawings in it
61:58 - and was collected as people played this
62:01 - game called quick-draw where the player
62:04 - is asked to draw a particular category
62:05 - and I think there are I think it's 384
62:08 - but somewhere well over 300 different
62:10 - kinds of drawings in this data set if
62:12 - you want to learn more about what a
62:15 - recurrent neural network
62:16 - is and how the model is trained I'll
62:18 - reference a few things that I'll link in
62:20 - the description first you should
62:21 - definitely check out this paper by David
62:24 - ha and Douglass AK from Google brain
62:26 - where they present the sketch RNN pre
62:29 - train model you can read this blog post
62:32 - from 2017 that is on the magenta
62:35 - projects blog well time out I think
62:37 - maybe there's a fan oh you found one
62:41 - awesome donated by Rob okay I will give
62:44 - it a try oh thank you so much yeah Oh
62:47 - interesting okay all right yes thank you
63:00 - all right I mean I think what I'm gonna
63:02 - do is go point this at the camera but
63:10 - first I'm going to just test it by plug
63:14 - it into the wall here can we place it I
63:19 - don't have like long flowing hair and I
63:21 - don't have I don't know what the right
63:24 - music would be
63:25 - [Music]
63:32 - that's the highest setting
63:37 - [Music]
63:40 - No my flowing hair isn't working okay
63:47 - all right so I'm putting this on the
63:49 - floor right now um actually you know
63:52 - what I have a table well I'm gonna move
63:54 - the table right underneath the camera
63:58 - [Music]
64:06 - I am going to is this table go higher
64:10 - it doesn't see where the that's fine
64:13 - though
64:14 - I am going to put the fan on the table
64:17 - pointing it directly at the camera and
64:20 - plugging it in
64:23 - it's making a loud noise that's not
64:26 - great but I think as I step away you'll
64:29 - hear that left
64:31 - [Music]
64:35 - this table goes back I feel like I
64:41 - should get it even closer
64:43 - [Music]
64:45 - so weird it's tabled definitely
64:49 - with fire
64:53 - I'm not gonna worry about that
64:56 - [Music]
64:57 - alright there is a fan
65:01 - let me just put my face in front of the
65:02 - camera see if I'm getting the air yeah
65:04 - that's my year by the way
65:08 - [Music]
65:11 - hoping that's gonna help keep the camera
65:13 - cool
65:15 - what do we think what are the chances
65:17 - this is gonna work put it as low as
65:22 - possible to get the cold air and make it
65:23 - flow up towards the camera Nick is
65:28 - asking you're gonna say anything about
65:29 - the red food collab so first of all I
65:31 - wouldn't call it a cola IV red food made
65:34 - this whole thing all on his own without
65:36 - anything that I did other than existing
65:39 - and maybe providing some video tutorials
65:40 - but I did play the game a little earlier
65:43 - and I wish I had more time to play it
65:44 - more let me just check let me just check
65:52 - is this sound reasonable right now like
65:56 - is the sound of the fan too loud
66:10 - can hear the fan a bit but no problem I
66:12 - could turn on the noise reduction but I
66:15 - think I'm gonna leave the noise in there
66:18 - we can always post process it perfect
66:19 - okay great thank you everybody I kind of
66:23 - want to just start this whole thing over
66:25 - I know I know you're all gonna be upset
66:27 - by that but I feel like I've lost the
66:30 - momentum and it's going to help me to
66:32 - have that back so I'm going to start
66:46 - this coding challenge over
67:02 - set auto power off temp too high
67:05 - Oh is there actually a setting on the
67:07 - camera so Abraham is saying set so if
67:09 - someone can't really do that easily
67:11 - right now unfortunately it would involve
67:13 - me like taking the camera off it's
67:15 - mounted directly to the wall so to be
67:16 - able to see the menu I have to remove it
67:18 - so unless the problem becomes really
67:20 - terrible I might do that but if someone
67:24 - if if that's a legitimate thing I will
67:25 - look into that alright here we go
67:26 - everybody take five million
67:39 - hello and welcome to a coding challenge
67:42 - interactive drawing with sketch are an
67:44 - end now maybe you're watching this and
67:46 - thinking to yourself well what sketch
67:48 - are an N then you're in the right place
67:50 - because I will explain to you a bit
67:52 - about what sketch RNN is and provide you
67:55 - with links in the description to a lot
67:56 - of background material if you want to do
67:57 - a deeper dive into the machine learning
67:59 - model that is sketch RNN but what I'm
68:02 - going to build in this video that you're
68:03 - watching is a my own version of this
68:06 - exact project so this is a project on
68:08 - the magenta website magenta is a project
68:11 - from Google that is around a creativity
68:14 - and AI there's a lot of music examples
68:16 - with the magenta project and what you're
68:18 - seeing here is the AI so to speak I mean
68:21 - it's really a machine learning model
68:22 - making predictions I'm drawing a cat and
68:25 - I can hit clear here and I can begin
68:27 - drawing the cat like I could just stop
68:29 - there and it's going to try to fill in
68:31 - the rest of the cat for me let's see if
68:32 - I try to draw one like this with like a
68:34 - like a sort of body and like a tail we
68:37 - can sort of see what happens so this is
68:39 - the eye view sketch aren't in before
68:41 - because I can generate a drawing from
68:44 - nothing with sketch RNN but what I want
68:46 - to do in this video is create something
68:47 - where the person using the computer
68:49 - draws with the mouse but you could
68:52 - imagine all sorts of interface
68:53 - interaction ideas that you could do and
68:55 - then has the machine learning model
68:58 - takes over and finishes the drawing and
68:59 - you can see there are quite a few other
69:01 - models the sketch aren't in the sketch
69:05 - are an end model isn't one model it's
69:06 - actually a collection of many models
69:07 - based on these categories because the
69:10 - data that was used to train the machine
69:12 - learning model is from a project called
69:14 - quick draw so quick draw is a game that
69:17 - you can play also from Google where the
69:20 - website prompts you to draw something
69:22 - and then it tries to like guess to see
69:24 - if like you're drawing the correct thing
69:26 - and you people playing that game Google
69:29 - collected all those drawings so there's
69:30 - a lot of interesting questions around
69:32 - the data set itself but it is an open
69:34 - source data set as 50 million drawings I
69:36 - think there are 384 categories not 100%
69:40 - sure about that
69:41 - and so that's the data set that it was
69:43 - trained on the kind of machine learning
69:46 - model architecture is something called a
69:48 - recurrent neural net
69:49 - so maybe at some point I'll have some
69:51 - video tutorials that look more closely
69:53 - at what a recurrent neural network is if
69:55 - you want to learn more all definitely
69:57 - there's a wonderful article that I read
69:58 - now this video's description pause for a
70:02 - second Rohan and Lenny recurrent neural
70:06 - network yeah
70:18 - this is this is a wonderful article that
70:20 - I read that really taught me a lot about
70:22 - how recurrent neural networks work it's
70:24 - quite technical but also pretty friendly
70:27 - and uses some nice examples to describe
70:29 - how they're working but you can also
70:31 - read the original paper by David ha and
70:34 - Douglas Eck researchers at Google brain
70:37 - that describe the sketch our 10 model
70:40 - how it was trained and all of the
70:42 - details behind it including you know the
70:45 - real lower level machine learning math
70:47 - details luckily for us I also mentioned
70:50 - there's this nice blog post pause for a
70:52 - second I put on do not disturb I put on
70:57 - do not disturb when I livestream I put
70:59 - on do not disturb it's off for some
71:01 - reason on your on ok you can also read
71:06 - this excellent blog post on the magenta
71:09 - blog called draw together with a neural
71:10 - network which mentions other
71:12 - collaborators and gives you more details
71:16 - also about how sketch our nan works
71:18 - guess what though I'm going to start
71:20 - coding now because one of the projects
71:23 - that I work on which is an open source
71:24 - library for machine learning called ml5
71:26 - Jas is built on top of tensorflow Jas
71:30 - which is Google's open source JavaScript
71:33 - version of tension flow of machine
71:34 - learning the open source library and ml5
71:38 - also includes the sketch RNN model as
71:41 - part of it so if I go here to reference
71:43 - and I sort of scroll down here on to the
71:46 - left
71:52 - interesting left this is actually a
71:54 - mistake this shouldn't be here under
71:56 - text so I better just sort of like I can
72:02 - find the sketch RNN page and read a bit
72:08 - more about sketch RNN and get some
72:10 - starter code aim the fan at the camera
72:18 - wall interesting so far I'm feeling good
72:21 - about it I shouldn't I shouldn't say
72:23 - anything because it hasn't powered off
72:26 - yet but that's good it is eighty one
72:29 - point four degrees in here people sweat
72:33 - dripping down it's like a sauna saunas
72:38 - are good for you right the good for my
72:39 - back I have back issues but feeling
72:41 - pretty good did you know that I'm
72:42 - training for the marathon
72:42 - hopefully we're about that later I
72:47 - should mention a Ross of saying the ml
72:49 - five pages so buggy the website is
72:51 - actually going a big is having an
72:55 - overhaul right now so there's a lot of
72:56 - issues on the website so I'm gonna try
72:58 - not to lean on using it too much during
73:00 - this video but hopefully in the next few
73:02 - days and into next week it'll a lot of
73:05 - this stuff but please if you're finding
73:06 - things that aren't working or missing
73:07 - feel free to file those as issues okay
73:15 - let me just quickly also do this
73:22 - okay
73:29 - hmm let's see here just give me a second
73:34 - here to organize the screen
73:36 - I think 400 by 400 ePHI nand that means
73:39 - I can move it over to here which means I
73:42 - can move this over a little bit more I
73:44 - can also stand much further over so if I
73:49 - stand over here then I can move this
73:54 - back over this way all right I think
73:57 - this is going to be good
73:58 - how's the font size I think it's okay
74:06 - first thing that I need to do if I'm
74:08 - going to use the ml5 library is make
74:10 - sure to import it into my p5 sketch so
74:13 - on the getting starting page there's
74:15 - actually a p5 web editor template I
74:17 - could click on but I'm actually just
74:18 - gonna copy this reference and guess what
74:20 - new version of ml5 out today zero point
74:23 - 4.0 lots more to say about that in other
74:26 - videos to come but I'm gonna go back to
74:28 - my sketch in the web editor I'm going to
74:31 - click over to find index of HTML and I'm
74:33 - going to add it as one of the libraries
74:35 - right up here in index.html click save
74:38 - and go back to sketch a yes and I'm
74:40 - ready to code
74:58 - I'm going to add the preload function in
75:02 - order to load the sketch RNN model so
75:05 - I'll make a variable I'll call it sketch
75:06 - RNN I'll say sketch are 10 equals and
75:11 - I'll go back to the reference ml 5
75:14 - sketch our net model and call back
75:17 - whoops and it everybody drink your cocoa
75:25 - and the model I want let's tow the model
75:28 - is hold on a second is this actually on
75:31 - the documentation page I don't think so
75:35 - so let me just give me a second here
75:39 - behind the scenes this need should be on
75:43 - the page but I'm gonna just grab this
75:58 - the model that I the model is a string
76:01 - that indicates what category what is the
76:04 - thing that I want to draw and I can
76:06 - actually find a list of all of them here
76:08 - you'll find that I'll link to this as
76:09 - well and you can see here's all the
76:11 - options so I'm going to start with a cat
76:12 - although I'm very tempted to do a cat
76:14 - bus cat pig and I'll come back to why
76:18 - those even exist in the first place you
76:19 - can think about that right now and how
76:21 - you might train a machine learning model
76:23 - why there might be a category that has
76:25 - two words combined Halloween the cat
76:32 - pigs are coming to get you a cat pig but
76:43 - I'm going to start with just cat and I
76:46 - don't need a call back because I'm
76:48 - loading the bottle in preload so I can
76:50 - assume that once I get to set up the
76:59 - model is loaded and let me run it no
77:02 - errors good sign model is loaded sketch
77:06 - our net initialized and why
77:25 - using sketch RNN is actually as easy as
77:29 - just calling a single function the
77:31 - generate function so I can say in
77:34 - Sketchup let's get up I could say in
77:38 - setup sketch RNN generate and then all I
77:43 - need to do is give it a callback so this
77:49 - is a moment to over here give it a
77:58 - callback and the callback I'm going to
78:00 - say got path stroke I'm not sure what to
78:04 - call this I'm gonna call it stroke path
78:06 - got stroke path and I'm gonna write this
78:09 - function function got stroke path that
78:13 - receives two arguments an error in case
78:15 - something went wrong and then an actual
78:18 - stroke path object or I shouldn't maybe
78:21 - call this results I don't know but I'm
78:22 - gonna call it stroke path and I'm just
78:24 - gonna say console dot log stroke path
78:27 - let's run this and see if anything comes
78:29 - out in the console things work it's like
78:37 - so rare in coding
78:45 - so this is now the foundation upon which
78:49 - everything else that I do in this
78:51 - example will be built so let me unpack
78:54 - this for you for a second a recurrent
78:57 - neural network is a kind of machine
78:59 - learning model that deals with
79:01 - sequential data that could be text like
79:04 - R comma a comma a comma n comma B I
79:08 - don't know why I'm putting the commas in
79:09 - there
79:19 - that could be text like a sequence of
79:22 - characters are a I and B Oh W it could
79:27 - be text like a sequence of words qu
79:31 - followed by qu it could be music maybe a
79:35 - sequence is a melody sub notes and
79:41 - rhythms a sequence each one of these
79:44 - units in a sequence you can think of as
79:47 - the state so in this case the state is
79:49 - very simple it's a single character here
79:52 - it's maybe with words it's a little more
79:53 - complex
79:54 - certainly musical notes the state might
79:56 - have which note is it what's the amount
79:59 - of time the duration of that note
80:01 - drawing a drawing can also be thought of
80:03 - as a sequence draw draw draw draw draw
80:06 - draw draw this is a sequence of vector
80:09 - paths or stroke paths as I'm calling
80:12 - them strokes their strokes of a pen and
80:15 - you'll notice back here in the code
80:18 - there's a DX a dy and a pen pen status
80:23 - so all of the states each element of the
80:27 - sequence involves a vector path a change
80:31 - in X a change in Y and whether the pen
80:35 - was down or up is the pen down as the
80:38 - pen up and there's actually a third
80:39 - state which is is the drawing completed
80:42 - which is end so if I all I need to do is
80:45 - figure out a way to say like okay you
80:47 - gave me this state now I'm gonna take
80:49 - that data and visualize it interestingly
80:51 - enough I'm gonna visualize it in a very
80:53 - literal form by drawing the path
80:55 - according to that vector in a canvas but
80:57 - maybe that state could be translated
80:59 - into music or words or some other kind
81:01 - of media how could you create an audio
81:03 - version of sketch RNN that would be
81:06 - something to think about
81:14 - there is a tricky thing going on here
81:17 - which is when do I choose to draw
81:19 - because if you've used p5 before you
81:22 - know that there's this function draw
81:24 - that you're asked to write which is
81:25 - always looping that's the animation loop
81:27 - and generally that's where you want to
81:29 - do your drawing but the stroke the data
81:31 - for the stroke has come back in this
81:32 - callback so I could get rid of the draw
81:35 - loop and do some my own timing stuff and
81:37 - draw in here but I think what I'm gonna
81:38 - do is I'm going to create a variable
81:41 - just I need to tie my shoe again I keep
81:43 - stepping on my shoelaces so I just need
81:45 - to fix this I'm very glad that the fan
81:49 - seems to be working
82:00 - people are really worried about the
82:02 - audio I'm gonna I guess I'm gonna I just
82:06 - I just what I'm seeing is like the audio
82:08 - getting all the way up to the red I can
82:11 - turn it up a tiny bit I don't want to
82:14 - change it I'm already is not just gonna
82:16 - fix the audio stuff when this gets
82:17 - edited so I apologies to the the audio
82:21 - issues that people are having I'm gonna
82:26 - create a variable called current stroke
82:29 - and I'm going to whenever I get a new
82:32 - stroke I'm gonna say current stroke
82:35 - equals stroke path just gonna set I'm
82:38 - gonna get the Dana coming in and set it
82:40 - to a global variable then in draw I'm
82:42 - going to ask if current stroke exists
82:47 - I'm just gonna say if it's you have to
82:49 - say if current stroke if it exists I can
82:51 - just do that in JavaScript by just
82:52 - checking if the variable any variable
82:54 - that has stuff in it will return true if
82:56 - it's an object then I want to draw a
82:59 - line from some value X Y to X plus
83:04 - current stroke DX Y plus current stroke
83:09 - dy so in other words I need some new
83:11 - data here I need to have this idea of
83:14 - where is the current pen and this is up
83:16 - to me this is not part of the model the
83:18 - model is just telling me relative
83:20 - directions to go so I'm gonna create my
83:22 - own variable called x and y in set up
83:26 - let me initialize it to just the center
83:28 - of the canvas let me just fill in the
83:32 - background with a white background and
83:35 - then draw this line let's say a stroke
83:40 - zero a stroke wait for so it's a little
83:45 - bit thicker and let's run this now
83:51 - there it is my cat
84:09 - okay great Thank You CJ CJ is telling me
84:12 - be confident in your audio
84:26 - my drawing of course has stopped because
84:29 - I only asked the generate function just
84:32 - gives me what is essentially the next
84:34 - path the next vector so once I have that
84:37 - I need to ask for another one so there's
84:40 - a bunch of different ways I could
84:41 - implement this but for me the logic is
84:43 - such that setup is going to ask for the
84:45 - first one then I'm going to receive it
84:48 - in the callback draw it and then right
84:50 - here after I've drawn it let me ask for
84:52 - the next one so I could just do exactly
84:54 - this again but what I want to also do if
85:00 - I'm asking for the next one let me set
85:02 - current stroke to nothing again let me
85:05 - just sort of clear that variable so the
85:08 - draw draw might continue to loop but it
85:10 - won't continue to draw that same stroke
85:12 - over and over again until a new one
85:14 - comes in and fills in to that variable
85:15 - so I think now if I run this we're going
85:18 - to see the following okay what did I
85:28 - forget to do right so I drew the vector
85:34 - path but even move the pen to the next
85:36 - spot so I need to say X + equals current
85:41 - stroke DX and the same thing y + equals
85:45 - current stroke dy let's try that again
85:49 - there we go ok so I can't erase the
85:54 - background and draw because if I do that
85:56 - let me take off the console.log I need
85:59 - to I want to see the drawing continue I
86:04 - don't want to erase the background and
86:05 - there we go now this doesn't look
86:07 - exactly right right I mean that's kind
86:09 - of a cat solar always scribbling
86:11 - scraggly cat but and I'm realizing I did
86:15 - all this in my snowflake video but you
86:16 - know hey this I could have just picked
86:19 - off from there but c'est la vie c'est la
86:22 - blah blah blah that's life Wow Oh
86:32 - eighty-two point five degrees people in
86:35 - summertime here on the coding train it's
86:37 - my tropical drink in the Cabana
86:44 - the thing that's missing here is I
86:47 - haven't dealt with the pen
86:48 - I really should only be drawing the line
86:51 - I always want to move the X&Y but only
86:54 - if current stroke dot pen is down do I
87:04 - want to actually draw that line let's
87:07 - try this now
87:18 - oh I spelled that wrong let's try this
87:21 - now something's off what is it's so hot
87:39 - in here it's crazy well I'm almost to my
87:42 - break at least where I can like open the
87:43 - door get some cool air in here as we
87:46 - look at the brilliant challenges I need
87:50 - like an ice ice iced drink
87:59 - [Music]
88:07 - let's try it one more time
88:12 - so I'm almost certain I know what the
88:14 - problem is here which is that the
88:32 - it's for the next stroke yeah I know
88:34 - Oscar e is telling me the correct answer
88:37 - and I know this to be the case I'm just
88:38 - trying to think how to explain it I know
88:41 - what the problem is here and I'm having
88:43 - a bit of a sense of deja vu because I
88:44 - went through this in the snowflake video
88:46 - but if this sequence where every single
88:51 - state has a DX dy and a penn state the
88:55 - penn state is actually describing what
88:59 - you should be doing for the next stroke
89:01 - it's a little bit weird but it's off by
89:04 - one i suppose that's because the drawing
89:06 - always starts with the pen down that's
89:09 - not entirely true
89:10 - i think so though i don't know about
89:13 - that the drawing always starts with the
89:15 - pen down and also there's a penn state
89:17 - of end so when you get a dxdy you do
89:20 - that and then the next thing is n so
89:23 - this value that comes back in the pen is
89:25 - actually for the next the next state so
89:28 - what I need to think about this in a
89:30 - more clever way so I'm going to have a
89:33 - separate variable that keeps track of
89:35 - next pen and it's gonna start with down
89:44 - and then we're going to say is if next
89:51 - pen is down which it will be then draw
89:55 - the line and then next pen equals
89:58 - current stroke pen so I'll save it for
90:03 - the next time around and then always
90:05 - pick it up again and I'll obviously stop
90:08 - if next pen is end so I can say
90:13 - something like if next pen equals end I
90:17 - could say you know no loop and return
90:21 - this will just kill the p5 sketch it
90:23 - will stop but I do want to draw it first
90:26 - oh no but it would come next anyway so I
90:30 - would have drawn it previously let's try
90:31 - this
90:36 - kind of looks like a cat right
90:52 - so this is essentially a perfect reek so
90:59 - this is essentially a recreation of my
91:01 - snowflake sketch RNN sketch which I felt
91:04 - like I needed to do just to kind of
91:05 - refresh my memory a look at the new ml5
91:07 - and make sure it's working in the web
91:09 - editor the way that I want because now
91:11 - is the moment the important part of this
91:15 - video where I want to pick up a user
91:17 - drawing a person's drawing who's using
91:20 - this sketch and feed that in well people
91:26 - are just chatting just chatting amongst
91:27 - themselves in the chat but before I do
91:32 - that part I'm going to take a short
91:35 - break to talk to you briefly about the
91:39 - coding trains sponsor and that is
91:43 - brilliant org so I'm not this is like
91:46 - perfect timing because I also need to
91:48 - take a little break to get some cool air
91:50 - into this room we're now up to 83
91:52 - degrees I have a feeling there's some
91:54 - excellent courses and challenges on the
91:57 - brilliant website around a statistics
91:59 - and temperature and climate
92:00 - you're probably simon probably knows
92:02 - where they are and can find them for me
92:03 - but if you aren't familiar well let me
92:09 - just click around here for a second so a
92:11 - brilliant is and I've got my fancy new
92:14 - set up here brilliant is a website which
92:16 - has a hands-on approach
92:20 - so there's actually 60 interactive
92:22 - courses on the website most of what I do
92:24 - is on the channel it's like look at the
92:27 - daily challenge and that's one of the
92:28 - ways that I enjoy using brilliant it's
92:30 - like I have five minutes on the on the
92:32 - subway I'm at home I'm with my kids
92:34 - let's look at a fun problem but it also
92:36 - has full courses in particular there's a
92:39 - new computer science fundamental courses
92:41 - and so you can see here some of the
92:48 - courses there's actually one an
92:49 - artificial neural networks that I'm
92:50 - really hoping to dig into soon so if
92:53 - you're looking for supplemental material
92:55 - and and I mostly mind this for ideas for
92:58 - my coding challenges but there's
93:00 - storytelling there's code writing
93:01 - there's interact
93:02 - challenges and lots of problems to solve
93:04 - so you can sign up for free at brilliant
93:06 - org slash coding train you can also
93:09 - unlock all of the features in all the
93:11 - courses through a premium subscription
93:13 - and the first 200 people to subscribe
93:15 - via that link will get a 20% discount so
93:18 - what I want to do now quickly is just
93:22 - move over to brilliant org and look at
93:25 - what the daily challenge is now normally
93:27 - and I guess I need to continue this
93:30 - course that I'm doing which is data
93:33 - structures that would be good I need to
93:35 - do more videos on data structures so
93:36 - learn more about the instructors but I
93:40 - would've actually just skipped to a
93:43 - yesterday's challenge really quickly
93:45 - because this is what I love like this is
93:47 - actually a coding challenge themed
93:50 - around what's in a variable and one of
93:51 - the things I love to looked at this
93:52 - yesterday Thank You Simon for pointing
93:54 - this out to me is that this if you
93:57 - weren't this to us right x equals x plus
94:00 - 1 is the most normal coherent thing to
94:04 - say and I actually just used it in my
94:06 - project x equals x plus DX but this is
94:12 - actually an absurd statement if you
94:13 - weren't a programmer because X does not
94:16 - equal X plus 1 that's impossible it's
94:19 - wrong it's false but there's a nice
94:22 - challenge around this let's look at it
94:23 - so if X is a number Y is a number if you
94:28 - write code like the following I'm gonna
94:35 - do this over here if I were to write x
94:40 - equals x plus y so x equals something y
94:45 - equals something and Y then also equals
94:50 - x plus y and remember these are two
94:53 - lines of code executing one after
94:55 - another the value stored in X is greater
95:03 - than the value stored in Y which one of
95:06 - these is the correct answer
95:09 - so how after this basically X is greater
95:16 - than
95:16 - why would return true this camera does
95:23 - not have a fan on it I thought maybe I
95:26 - was giving this camera a nice little
95:28 - break by moving to this one I didn't
95:29 - actually turn it off so this one doesn't
95:32 - have the fan I'm not so concerned about
95:34 - that because first of all doesn't seem
95:36 - to lose its focus or maybe it does and
95:38 - it just I'm getting lucky with the focus
95:40 - but it looks still like it's in focus
95:42 - and I'm using it much less so um so how
95:46 - could this possibly be true let's just
95:49 - try some numbers X is 5 y is 2 so x
95:53 - equals 5 plus 2 I'm going to have 7 and
95:56 - then y equals 7 plus 2 I'm gonna have 9
96:00 - so X that's not true so clearly there's
96:03 - got to be something to do with a
96:04 - negative number here so we could
96:06 - probably say if X is negative or if Y is
96:09 - negative my instinct is y is negative
96:11 - I'm probably getting that backwards oh
96:13 - my god let's try what if Y is negative 2
96:15 - so x equals x plus y yeah because if y
96:25 - is negative x goes down then Y goes
96:28 - further this is kind of like we're
96:29 - incrementing so this totally makes sense
96:30 - I was right it was right ding ding 5
96:36 - minus 2 is 3 and then 3 minus 2 is 1 so
96:40 - yeah I think just as long as Y is
96:41 - negative that's gonna be a great game so
96:43 - I like this because I like oh but this
96:45 - is such a grief you were if you're not a
96:47 - programmer most of you watching this
96:48 - have done some coding before if you
96:50 - haven't welcome I hope that this is
96:52 - enjoyable and you're following along to
96:54 - the best that you can I guess I would
96:55 - suggest going back and looking at some
96:56 - of my beginner tutorials or other
96:58 - beginner tutorials you could find but
97:00 - but I like this because this is really
97:02 - tricky to think through if you haven't
97:03 - coded before it even a little bit hard
97:05 - for me right now
97:05 - just cuz this looks so circular in a
97:10 - weird sort of way let's go back and
97:13 - let's try to what do we the input value
97:19 - of Y was negative so let's click that
97:21 - let's click Submit correct
97:27 - I started a one-day street I kind of
97:30 - want to do today's challenge - do I have
97:31 - time let's see if we can do it quickly
97:33 - because it looks super interesting Lee
97:34 - has a visual pattern rearrange the dots
97:38 - so in the pattern below we add a new row
97:42 - to the bottom of the triangle to each
97:43 - step the next term will then be 10 plus
97:46 - 5 so we have 1 3 1 2 3 4 5 6
97:51 - we're adding 3 adding 4 oh you're adding
97:55 - 4 here to get to 10 right
97:56 - I see we could extend this pattern as
97:58 - far as we want making larger and larger
97:59 - triangles but is it possible to skip
98:01 - straight to the number of dots in the
98:02 - hundreds triangle so what's the formula
98:05 - I guess okay I guess they're showing us
98:09 - the solute I was gonna have to figure it
98:10 - out the solution here first second third
98:15 - if we rearrange and double the truck oh
98:18 - look at this
98:18 - so the idea here is that you have a 1 by
98:24 - 2 a 2 by 3 a 3 by 4 so you always have a
98:30 - n if I draw up here you always have an N
98:34 - by n plus 1 photo you can't see that ok
98:43 - everybody I'll use
98:51 - you always have you know some sort of
98:57 - grid that is for example 3x4 half of it
99:03 - is this so you have n times n plus one
99:08 - is the total number of dots and just
99:11 - divide that by two is the half number of
99:13 - that so that's the formula so for a
99:14 - hundred you'd have a hundred times 100
99:17 - plus 100 1/2 okay you could do that math
99:20 - in your head over the calculator n times
99:27 - n1 here it is I don't have to do that
99:28 - math it's right here 5050 can you find
99:31 - the pattern and the dots below well this
99:33 - is the same thing right it's just end
99:36 - times n plus 1 divided by 2 plus 1 plus
99:41 - n oh no no no this is a different
99:43 - pattern right oh because the triangle
99:47 - here is arranged on its side and the
99:50 - triangle here is arrangement so I think
99:51 - by the way weekend this is an extra dot
99:53 - dot dot dot so there's definitely a blow
99:55 - it gives me choices well it's got to be
99:58 - this one right because it's got to be I
99:59 - have a plus n that's what I'm thinking
100:01 - it's got to have a plus n like I could
100:03 - figure out what's the formula 1 goes to
100:05 - 3 2 goes to 6 3 goes to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
100:10 - 9 10 4 times 5 is 20 divided by 2 is 10
100:17 - it's got to be this one so I'm just by
100:19 - eyeballing it it's this one but why is
100:21 - that n plus 1 times n plus 2 is what
100:27 - well let's click on it let's click on it
100:30 - let's just see if I'm right just through
100:31 - that sheer instinct
100:33 - oh no there's a plus end down here ah
100:37 - I'm not on percent confident now cuz I
100:40 - didn't scroll all the way down there's
100:41 - another plus n so well first of all you
100:44 - could do these kind of tests my way test
100:46 - taking skill you could do process of
100:48 - elimination because for example 3 plus 1
100:51 - is 16 I mean that's not the right answer
100:54 - is it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
100:56 - that's wrong 3 times 4 is 12 divided by
101:02 - 2 is 6 plus 3 is 9 that's not right so
101:04 - it's definitely this one
101:05 - so like process elimination I can just
101:07 - do it but there's there's probably a way
101:10 - to draw this in the interest of time
101:13 - there we go all right absolutely
101:16 - correctly I don't have to chat up there
101:20 - you get work figure I'd already
101:21 - mentioned this I should get the chat off
101:24 - backup sorry about this I'm I shouldn't
101:26 - rush through this I like to let people
101:27 - in the chat I'll usually I'll take the
101:28 - break and let people answer it but I've
101:31 - lost all of my control panels I forgot
101:34 - about my whole technique here n times n
101:38 - plus 1/2 so cast is writing this but if
101:42 - I go down here oh if you think doubling
101:46 - it n plus 1 times n plus 2 is the total
101:51 - number of things in a parallelogram
101:53 - because these are parallelograms right
101:56 - parallelogram as shown let me is that
101:59 - right
101:59 - ok the camera went off again well good
102:01 - news is the fan seems to be working
102:03 - because this camera doesn't have a fan
102:05 - pointed at it and that one does and it's
102:08 - the only one that's this one is the one
102:10 - that's powering off so what time is it
102:18 - oh okay that's okay I'm gonna take a few
102:19 - minute break in a second so it's alright
102:26 - 1 2 3 oh this makes sense right because
102:36 - well I don't think I drew that correctly
102:38 - oh and I totally did not draw that
102:42 - correctly yeah hold on I did I just drew
102:50 - it in a slightly weird way like the way
102:52 - that it's drawn is to is making these so
103:00 - that's like this I have three and then I
103:02 - have three and this is N equals one if
103:08 - okay yeah if you consider this N equals
103:12 - two then you would be right and but this
103:14 - is n this is for N equals one so if N
103:17 - equals one you have you have three times
103:21 - two which is n plus 1 times n plus 2 and
103:27 - that would be the case for if I add
103:29 - three more and then double that so yes
103:32 - I'm doing this sort of intuitively
103:35 - there's probably a more elegant way that
103:37 - you could describe this and certainly
103:40 - what I one of the things is my favorite
103:42 - thing to do is reading other people's
103:44 - solutions and how they explain it
103:46 - oh look at this that's cool even with
103:49 - some like nice mathematical notation I
103:51 - like how this is drawn oh look at this
103:54 - and then like with some this is great so
103:56 - what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna take
103:58 - a break if you don't already have a
104:00 - brilliant org account you can sign up
104:02 - right now if anybody has the inclination
104:05 - to make a p5 sketch that visualizes this
104:09 - with like maybe n is a slider and then
104:12 - shows the total number that would be
104:14 - something you could do that's something
104:16 - that I enjoy doing and then you I like
104:18 - to post my code solution here in the
104:22 - comments on brilliant so I'm gonna take
104:23 - a short break
104:25 - leave this up here
104:28 - I am going to actually turn the camera
104:30 - off just to let it cool down a little
104:33 - bit I'm going to prop open the door I'm
104:36 - going to take a break just for maybe two
104:39 - or three minutes
104:41 - [Music]
104:53 - [Music]
105:00 - [Music]
105:28 - I got to come back quickly and say that
105:44 - cachi and Cass are discussing equals one
105:50 - [Music]
106:20 - [Music]
106:40 - I'm gonna say once again
106:44 - [Music]
106:55 - coordinates
106:58 - [Music]
107:11 - and auto-tune and the internet will fix
107:14 - that for me
107:19 - [Music]
107:23 - coordinates
107:26 - [Music]
107:41 - [Music]
107:44 - and we're
107:50 - back the lights are off the door is open
107:53 - the links are down low
107:55 - it's quiet we're going to go back to
107:58 - doing sketch RNN thank you to brilliant
108:00 - for the sponsorship I'm going to I've
108:04 - got the temperature down to 82 degrees
108:06 - follow me
108:07 - 82 it was at 83.5 we're now at 82 I'm
108:12 - gonna turn the lights back on it's gonna
108:14 - warm up in here oh the Sun is coming up
108:18 - it is getting bright good morning
108:22 - everybody welcome to the coding training
108:25 - we're back from our break we're gonna
108:28 - finish making this interactive sketch
108:31 - RNN project I have about a half an hour
108:38 - to do this before I've really got to go
108:41 - which I think it's quite realistic so
108:44 - hopefully nothing will go terribly wrong
108:46 - and no time for chitchat no time for
108:59 - chitchat
109:10 - now I have this cat and this the correct
109:13 - generated drawing a duplicate of what I
109:16 - did in the snowflake
109:18 - a sketch RNN challenge but here I am
109:21 - ready to add the next component which is
109:22 - a person coming here drawing their own
109:26 - starter path and then having sketch
109:29 - aren't intake over how would I do that
109:30 - so one of the things that I have to
109:32 - revisit is this state right once again I
109:36 - need to all this state any given state
109:41 - light Sonia you need to revisit the
109:45 - state so any given moment of the drawing
109:47 - is a dxdy and a Penn State so I need to
109:51 - collect a sequence of those from the
109:54 - person who is drawing one way I can do
109:58 - that is I want to the drawing I'm not
110:00 - going to be too sophisticated about this
110:02 - I'm gonna have the user start the
110:04 - drawing when they click the mouse and
110:05 - stop when they release the mouse
110:07 - so I basically want to events that are
110:09 - tied to the canvas so I'm going to store
110:13 - the canvas in a variable and I'm gonna
110:15 - say canvas mousepressed start drawing
110:19 - and canvas mouse mouse released I'm
110:26 - honestly finished drawing but it's not
110:27 - finished a sketch RNN I can say sketch
110:30 - are an end start so I no longer want to
110:34 - call generate right here in setup I'm
110:37 - not going to start generating I'm going
110:39 - to first collect the data from the user
110:41 - and function start drawing
110:54 - presumably right here is where I'm gonna
111:00 - start generating the drawing right
111:02 - sketch are an end start so I need a what
111:06 - I'm gonna call this is the seed path
111:07 - it's what I'm putting into the machine
111:10 - learning model for it to begin to it's
111:13 - the seed path it's what I'm seeding the
111:15 - machine learning bottle with so seed
111:18 - path is an array and I'm gonna say I'm
111:26 - gonna have a very variable called person
111:29 - drawing which is false and as soon as I
111:34 - soon as start drawing happen person
111:37 - drawing will go to true because in draw
111:43 - I'm gonna say if person drawing I want
111:48 - to collect those states so what are the
111:51 - states the stroke path is an object
111:58 - which has a DX a DUI and a Penn State
112:03 - well the pen is always going to be down
112:04 - again I could do something more
112:06 - sophisticated or I could have an
112:08 - interaction that the you the person the
112:10 - user could actually draw stop pick up do
112:13 - different things and then have sketch
112:14 - RNN know how to take over but by
112:16 - definition the way I'm building this is
112:18 - when the mouse is released sketch or an
112:19 - in takes over so the pen is always down
112:21 - and DX is I can use built-in variables
112:24 - at p5 it stores the current mounts
112:26 - position minus the previous mouse
112:29 - position so this is actually really easy
112:30 - to do in p5 because I have these values
112:33 - already so the difference between the
112:35 - current mouse and the previous mouse
112:37 - dxdy and the pen is down then I can say
112:41 - seed path dot push stroke path and then
112:51 - when the mouse is released sketch iron
112:54 - and start person drawing is false
112:59 - let's give this a try ok big problem I
113:04 - don't see what I'm drawing
113:07 - that would be nice but it drew a cat as
113:10 - soon as I release the mouse so I need to
113:12 - add something in draw which does the
113:15 - following hmm I guess I just want to
113:19 - draw I don't want to do exactly what I
113:21 - did here
113:22 - so let's universally let's set stroke
113:26 - zero stroke wait for and let's just take
113:28 - this line function put it here and I
113:32 - want to draw X Y X plus drogue path and
113:38 - then I want to say the same thing I want
113:41 - to do this so again there might be a way
113:44 - to consolidate this code and but there
113:50 - it is so this now at least I should see
113:51 - what I'm drawing whoa
113:56 - okay that's weird oh boy try this again
114:00 - what just happened there
114:02 - oh oh it's drawing everything relative
114:08 - to the mouse relative to the center
114:11 - that's not good aha
114:15 - so the first point that I'm drawing is
114:17 - actually okay so x and y don't get
114:21 - initialized in the center of course of
114:23 - course of course x and y get initialized
114:26 - when I start drawing
114:28 - wherever the mouse is all right that
114:31 - should fix this problem here's my cat
114:35 - now continue drawing like cat weird wait
114:38 - I drew the circle
114:39 - I drew the cat's face already try this
114:43 - again so it's picking up where I left
114:47 - off but it seems to be starting the
114:49 - drawing over why because I never told
114:52 - the model to sketch our name model about
114:55 - my seed strokes in the first place right
114:58 - I still just call sketch RNN dot
115:01 - generate that first time but guess what
115:04 - the generate function can take as a
115:07 - additional optional argument an array of
115:10 - states that are fed into the model and I
115:12 - have those already in seed path is that
115:16 - what I called it
115:16 - so now
115:18 - drum roll please I believe this is the
115:22 - last detail plenty more I want to say
115:23 - and a couple more things I want to do
115:25 - but this is the last sort of detail
115:35 - [Music]
115:38 - it didn't really come out like a nice
115:40 - cats try this one more time that was
115:52 - good but there's a bad got lucky so it
115:55 - sort of worked it sort of didn't work
115:57 - there is an issue there is something
115:59 - really important that I need to
116:00 - implement and actually it's my intention
116:02 - for this to actually become a feature of
116:05 - ml5 and it's going to handle it for you
116:07 - automatically but that hasn't been
116:09 - implemented yet in ml5 so in this video
116:11 - I'm gonna try it out and then maybe in a
116:13 - future video log do a video about adding
116:15 - this is a feature to ml5 and it has to
116:17 - do with the rdp line simplification
116:19 - algorithm which guess what if you look
116:21 - at the previous coding challenge
116:22 - what a coincidence it is the rdp line
116:25 - duplication algorithm so why does this
116:26 - matter let's go back to the example
116:32 - let's go back to this example here and
116:35 - I'm gonna do something pay close
116:37 - attention I'm gonna hit clear I'm gonna
116:39 - zoom way in close and I'm gonna draw
116:41 - very very slowly
116:43 - a lot of squiggly lines like this really
116:45 - really slowly now watch what happens
116:48 - when I lift up the mouse ready one two
116:50 - three do you see how the drawing changed
116:54 - the sum it's very subtle but some of the
116:57 - points that I was drawing were removed
116:59 - the the fidelity of the line was lowered
117:03 - even though it's capturing I'm capturing
117:06 - the mouse positions in my sketch at
117:10 - presumably 60 frames per second I'm
117:12 - capturing a lot of points so I'm giving
117:15 - the machine learning model the sketch
117:17 - RNN model all of these states were the
117:20 - DX and dy values are really really tiny
117:22 - but it wasn't actually trained with data
117:26 - with the data the drawings are stored in
117:29 - the quick-draw data set aren't
117:31 - necessarily I'm what am I trying to say
117:35 - the model wasn't actually trained with
117:38 - drawings that have a super high fidelity
117:40 - to them with lots and lots of points
117:42 - close together I'm actually could not
117:44 - sure whether if that's in the
117:46 - quick-draw dataset or whether that was
117:48 - like a processing of the data but one of
117:51 - the researchers at Google wrote a github
117:54 - issue on the ml5 repository explaining
117:57 - actually no that wasn't a github issue I
117:59 - filed the issue based on an email I was
118:03 - in touch with David ha who explained
118:05 - that so I want to say yeah I was in
118:09 - touch with David hah who explained that
118:11 - the RDP algorithm was used to simplify
118:15 - the drawings when the model was trained
118:17 - and so when you're feeding stuff into it
118:18 - you want to have those drawings retain
118:20 - that quality so let's move back over
118:26 - here let's find my code and give me a
118:29 - second here everybody I think it might
118:31 - actually be not in did I put it in
118:35 - coding train let's see because I didn't
118:38 - create the web page for it yeah so I'm
118:40 - behind on a lot of things interactive
118:43 - drawing
118:43 - no there isn't I think I for whatever
118:45 - silly reason I put it here under a
118:48 - different P 5 web editor account hope
118:54 - there's an extra character here oh I
118:59 - don't have a slack channel open and I
119:01 - see all these notifications help camera
119:05 - help guide for setting auto temperature
119:06 - off Thank You CJ where is it I made I'm
119:13 - gonna have to go to my class did I just
119:18 - call it no let me go to github.com give
119:25 - me a second here by the way if you're
119:28 - wondering what I'm looking at I'm
119:29 - finding the repo for the course that I'm
119:31 - teaching at NYU I encourage you to check
119:34 - out all the materials if you're
119:35 - interested but I'm looking for here I'm
119:38 - looking for the p5 RDP example oh it was
119:44 - encoding train and it's called
119:45 - coordinated bagel that's why I didn't
119:47 - see it
119:48 - coding challenge I forget what number
119:51 - was 151 or to just say RDP
119:57 - okay
120:11 - here is the code for the last coding
120:13 - challenge was the rdp line
120:15 - simplification algorithm and I'm just
120:16 - simplifying a sort of mathematical curve
120:19 - just to recreate the animation that's on
120:22 - the Wikipedia page for the rdp algorithm
120:24 - but I should be able to take these
120:25 - functions I realized there's going to be
120:30 - something tricky about this Oh more
120:33 - complicated than I think because this is
120:36 - but I can I can do this I can do this
120:47 - I'm going to create another file called
120:51 - RT PJs
121:00 - I'm going to reference it here in
121:02 - index.html and
121:15 - I'm just want to see
121:27 - right okay
121:34 - I'm gonna grab my implementation of the
121:37 - RDP algorithm which includes all four of
121:40 - these functions you can watch the other
121:42 - video to see me write those functions
121:44 - I'm gonna paste them all here and what I
121:47 - wanna call is just RDP so I give the RDP
121:50 - function an array of all a whole bunch
121:53 - of points then I also give it an empty
121:56 - array that it's going to fill with the
121:58 - RDP reduced points and it requires a
122:01 - global variable hmm the way I created
122:06 - the example was with a global variable
122:08 - called epsilon so I'm just gonna sort of
122:11 - hard code in a value for that at ten
122:14 - right here
122:28 - and then now right before I generate the
122:32 - seed path I need to I need to perform
122:41 - RDP line simplification so interestingly
122:47 - enough the RDP algorithm doesn't know
122:50 - anything about sketch or Hanan and dxdy
122:52 - and Penn State
122:54 - so actually what I want to do is I want
122:57 - to have another another array called
123:03 - seed points and those are what I
123:07 - actually want to collect well I mean I
123:10 - mean it's kind of over complicated it's
123:12 - okay I've got to figure this out I want
123:16 - to collect
123:26 - it's so hot in here yeah I'm almost 84
123:29 - degrees it's a sauna it's like very hard
123:34 - to think when it's this hot I'm going to
123:42 - comment this out this is going to become
123:45 - important again but I'm going to say
123:47 - seed points push create vector Mouse X
123:57 - Mouse why
124:04 - and then
124:10 - I want to draw I'm just curious here
124:20 - they think I'm really thinking this
124:22 - through here and then the line that I
124:24 - want to draw is actually just mouse X
124:30 - Mouse Y P Mouse X P Mouse Y so let's try
124:40 - this this so the drawing still works
124:42 - weirdly what happens with the first ones
124:45 - thing weird is happening with the first
124:46 - one no it's normal okay that's just if I
124:50 - if I do this and then no okay sorry so
124:57 - the drawing works still that was
125:03 - interesting and then I get the cat
125:05 - there's no seed points so this is weird
125:07 - extra cat happened
125:27 - all right I got it now now I'm going to
125:33 - create an empty array of RDP points I'm
125:38 - gonna call the RDP function with start
125:43 - index and index all points are DP points
125:46 - again I might want to rethink how that
125:47 - function was created but it is oh you
125:52 - know what I can do now what I want to do
126:01 - is perform the RDP line simplification
126:04 - so I can actually go back to my previous
126:05 - example once again and I can sorry
126:10 - everybody
126:11 - this is what I'm looking for what I want
126:16 - to do is perform the RDP line
126:18 - simplification now so I can go back to
126:20 - my previous example once again and
126:21 - basically find exactly this code so I'm
126:24 - going to grab this code and I'm going to
126:27 - put it here and what this is doing is
126:29 - it's creating a new empty array and it's
126:31 - calling the rdp function on the all
126:34 - points array which is now called seed
126:37 - points and filling it with the
126:44 - simplified version of the line and then
126:46 - what I need to do after that is now I
126:49 - have this RDP point which is the
126:50 - simplified version of the line I want to
126:53 - say for let a equal zero I is less than
126:56 - RDP points I'm going to actually start
126:59 - at one RDP points dot length I plus plus
127:04 - and I need to create the state now so
127:09 - remember where was I doing that before
127:12 - right here this is exactly what I want
127:14 - to do
127:19 - I want to create the stroke path which
127:27 - is RDP points index I I dot X - the
127:39 - previous one I - one do the same thing
127:46 - for y and then the pen is down then I
127:52 - can I could redraw I'm not gonna redraw
127:55 - anything just for a second and then I
127:57 - want to put that into the stroke path
128:01 - and then call generate alright that was
128:06 - a little I'm manic here which I guess
128:08 - all my coding challenges are pretty
128:09 - manic but what just happened again the
128:12 - idea ultimately is for ml5 to handle
128:16 - this I think that's what I would like to
128:17 - do I would like to create a helper
128:18 - function ml5 that sketch Arnon takes
128:21 - your seed path in and like performs the
128:24 - line simplification for you but this is
128:25 - my coding challenge to implement it
128:27 - manually to see if it helps so what i'm
128:30 - doing here is i have the set of points
128:32 - that i've collected in seed points I
128:34 - call the RDP algorithm which simplifies
128:36 - that path previous coding challenge goes
128:39 - through that in more detail then I have
128:41 - to generate the States based off the
128:43 - simplified path and then that's what I
128:46 - put into the sketch RNN model not
128:51 - feeling super-confident here but let's
128:52 - give this a try
129:02 - it looks the same
129:05 - but I think if if I'm correct if I did
129:09 - this many many times I would have better
129:11 - results coordinated bagel there's
129:24 - something else really important here
129:25 - 11:40 ok I think however it's very
129:33 - important that I create that same visual
129:35 - effect where I redraw the simplified
129:39 - line and that's actually a pretty easy
129:41 - thing for me to do right here because
129:43 - what I can do is in sketch are an end
129:46 - start after I do the line simplification
129:50 - I can redraw the background and then I
129:54 - could say begin shape like I should have
129:57 - been in shape and I'm going to say for
130:01 - let V of seed path I'm just getting all
130:06 - the vectors out of the seed path of
130:08 - vertex V X V dot Y and I'm gonna say no
130:14 - fill
130:14 - I should have I've already been drawing
130:18 - so but just to be consistent let me take
130:21 - this here
130:27 - is that let me take this here and put
130:35 - that here so now I draw and drawing and
130:39 - drawing erasing it and then drawing the
130:41 - simplified line let's see how that goes
130:47 - mmm I didn't see it what did I do wrong
130:50 - here oh no not the seed path seed points
130:55 - and I should be doing this before
130:58 - technically speaking it doesn't really
131:00 - matter but this is what I want to do
131:03 - here so this is performing the line
131:06 - simplification drawing an line isn't
131:11 - really right but simplify path path
131:13 - simplification and then now converting
131:22 - converting to sketch are and end States
131:24 - all right let's try this one more time
131:34 - did you do that simplify who it's hard
131:36 - to see let's try like a a much higher
131:40 - epsilon like 100
131:54 - yeah oh yeah it did it's just not super
131:57 - obvious but a hundred is crazy just to
132:07 - prove the point let me prove the point
132:09 - hey let me do this
132:17 - hmm I'm not sure that this is actually
132:22 - like doing what I think it's gonna do
132:26 - let me do some debugging here whoops
132:33 - Oh No RDP points people RDP points RDP
132:51 - points simplified line is in RDP points
132:56 - not even the seed points the sea points
132:59 - was everything I collected the
133:01 - simplified one is called RDP points my I
133:03 - should use better naming now I think let
133:07 - me go back and change the epsilon back
133:09 - to ten something more reasonable and
133:11 - we're gonna try this one more time I
133:18 - draw it slowly so that there's a lot of
133:21 - extra points I'm gonna make a like weird
133:23 - curve here here we go one two three
133:26 - there we go
133:29 - so that looked like it really simplified
133:32 - it like way too much so I this would be
133:34 - an interesting thing to tune because I
133:36 - want this to be in this will be like
133:38 - sort of the hard-coded value probably an
133:40 - ml five although maybe it's a parameter
133:41 - that you the the user of ml five could
133:43 - adjust but this is what I would want to
133:45 - sort of play with to figure out what
133:47 - makes the most sense but now I can
133:50 - really see the line simplification
133:51 - happening you know what it should
133:54 - actually be I have no idea whoops
134:03 - it's back to five
134:12 - so before I go so as always with any of
134:21 - these coding challenges I'm doing just a
134:24 - really sort of basic version I think
134:25 - that I have mostly successfully
134:27 - recreated exactly this but one of the
134:30 - things you'll notice is that there's a
134:33 - lot more thoughtfulness to the interface
134:35 - and the design first of all it's drawing
134:37 - over and over again what what sketch RNN
134:40 - is drawing is a different color there's
134:41 - a nice interface for picking which model
134:44 - you want to load you can kind of like
134:46 - randomize stuff and clear it and there's
134:49 - a page of information all about how this
134:52 - works
134:52 - so maybe you want to create your own
134:55 - version and think about what is that
134:57 - interaction design how are you
134:59 - visualizing what the person is drawing
135:01 - versus what the model is drawing and how
135:04 - are you picking which model to draw
135:05 - maybe you can make this into a game an
135:08 - art project something that is just tells
135:11 - a story that draws based on you know
135:14 - words that needle text-to-speech or
135:17 - speech to text or something that there's
135:18 - so many ideas that I think you had
135:19 - explore so I hope you make one of those
135:21 - ideas and share it with me by going to
135:23 - the coding trade calm and follow the
135:24 - instructions about how to share your
135:26 - community contribution but I will before
135:28 - I go just kind of give you a nice
135:30 - compilation I think one of the things
135:32 - that I want to return to is all the
135:35 - different pre-trained models that are
135:37 - available now you I could also train
135:39 - your own model it should be a really
135:40 - interesting thing to try very high
135:42 - degree of difficulty there but possible
135:44 - but the reason why I'm assuming there
135:46 - are models in here that are in addition
135:48 - to frog there's frog sofa is because the
135:52 - Frog model was trained with only
135:54 - drawings of frogs the Frog the sofa
135:57 - models train was wrongs of sofa the Frog
135:59 - sofa model was wrongs of both without a
136:01 - distinction between the two so the AI
136:04 - the machine learning model is just
136:06 - learning about paths that happen when
136:08 - you're drawing frogs and sofas and so we
136:10 - could try crab rabbit face Pig but I'm
136:13 - just gonna enjoy myself and try the
136:16 - everything model and I'll see you in the
136:19 - next coding challenge
136:37 - oh it doesn't go over and over again how
136:39 - do i oh wait a second I wanted to do it
136:43 - again and again so let's at least add
136:46 - that here as well so if this state is
136:50 - end hold on everybody instead of saying
136:57 - no loop what I want to do is actually
137:03 - call sketch RN n dot reset which will
137:08 - reset the model and then call sketch
137:11 - Arnon start again is that what the
137:14 - function was called and so if I reset
137:23 - the model call start again it's going to
137:25 - draw a new version
137:33 - No maybe maybe not
137:37 - hey why did that break so let's say the
137:43 - model is reset it performs RDP again
137:47 - draw to draw it again like this is fine
137:51 - the C points haven't changed and then it
137:55 - should create oh the seed path here's
138:01 - the mistake when I'm resetting
138:03 - everything I don't need to do all this
138:05 - again but I might as well so I could
138:08 - refactor this but at a minimum what I
138:18 - need to do is actually I don't need to
138:22 - do any of this coz seed path is a global
138:24 - variable so but I'm just gonna do this
138:28 - I'm I'm just gonna reset C path so yes I
138:30 - need to refactor this but I don't want
138:32 - to add all the seed points in the seed
138:33 - path again so let's try this what will
138:38 - the model draw enjoy
138:47 - no it's not working still what did I
138:56 - miss
138:56 - look at the chat next pen next pen oh
139:05 - this
139:06 - so this return is a problem current
139:10 - stroke also should be set to null I
139:16 - think oh and next pen should be set to
139:22 - down so I think I need next pen to not
139:27 - be end anymore and a current stroke to
139:30 - know this is really gonna work please
139:35 - work
139:51 - what did I forget to reset so many
139:54 - things I guess like a deep I should do
139:58 - some more person drawing is false
140:04 - current stroke is null all right let's
140:07 - do some
140:13 - reset the seed path RDP points is reset
140:22 - mmm i'll Stinney to reset doing things
140:31 - in weird places which concerns me
140:45 - all right I'm gonna need to
140:51 - let's put this console.log back in oh
140:54 - wait let's also put that in
141:17 - Oh
141:20 - Oh x & y x & y x and y i didn't think
141:33 - about x and y and it's definitely a
141:35 - thing so when you start the drawing X is
141:39 - that Mouse X Mouse y know but that's
141:42 - fine
141:42 - yay and then oh wait a second
141:55 - ooh this is some this is the problem
141:57 - that's weird
142:00 - I actually never move I think this was
142:03 - wrong all in the first place because
142:05 - this needs to be in there I need to move
142:09 - X Y and then I need to also reset X Y or
142:23 - actually would make sense is for X equal
142:30 - our DP points the last one right X&Y
142:43 - needs to just be wherever this leaves
142:45 - off the last one
142:55 - I think this is the last thing I forgot
142:57 - to reset which I didn't even set for the
143:00 - first time XY needs to like pick off
143:02 - where we left off I think all right here
143:09 - we go I'm just gonna draw a line
143:28 - the monsters are coming to get you the
143:31 - sketch RNN monsters okay thanks
143:33 - everybody goodbye enjoy these drawings
143:37 - you know what no no I can't live with
143:40 - this I'm gonna leave you with rainbows
143:47 - and I'm gonna take out the console.log
143:59 - all right everybody rainbows and
144:02 - rainbows
144:11 - is rainbow not one of the models it's
144:14 - one of the sky quick great it quick draw
144:18 - no it's not one of the models were like
144:20 - unicorn no there's no unicorn model I
144:23 - guess we have to just go with cats
144:24 - let's do cat pigs or elephant pigs cat
144:29 - pigs
144:31 - let's do cat pigs cat pigs are fun I
144:35 - will leave you with wrong sketch I will
144:42 - leave you with cat pigs let's get this I
144:51 - know which one is the one I want
145:02 - Oh
145:06 - I know what I'm doing anymore and now I
145:11 - will leave you with the cat pigs refresh
145:24 - this again
145:30 - and I will say goodbye to you by letting
145:34 - you watch a compilation of sketch RNN
145:36 - drawn cat pigs
145:52 - mmm
145:59 - [Music]
146:11 - this is way too much fun oh there's a
146:13 - cat Pig all right so this livestream is
146:17 - now over officially as of 20 minutes ago
146:21 - I did somehow make it through all of
146:23 - this the fan is definitely the solution
146:26 - I'm taking a picture of the thermostat
146:30 - so I can send it to the building - let
146:43 - me see what makes them how do i how do I
146:44 - do this let's take a picture it's eighty
146:46 - four point six degrees in this room
146:50 - right now okay
146:58 - thank you everybody I wish that I had
147:00 - more time to look at some community
147:02 - contributions to play noisy food check
147:07 - out noisy food aya ho
147:09 - maybe I can answer a couple questions
147:13 - from the chat
147:16 - Simon is suggesting Catbus Simon's also
147:20 - remind me that last coding challenges
147:21 - out yet it is prepared so I will be
147:25 - releasing that as an unlisted member
147:27 - only video I mean it's all in the live
147:29 - stream but the edited version of it
147:31 - later today and then as soon as the
147:33 - closed captioning is completed then it
147:35 - will go public on YouTube the second
147:37 - coding in the Cabana video with the
147:39 - Collatz conjecture should come out
147:40 - sometime within the next few weeks a lot
147:44 - and I'll be back actually up something
147:48 - semi special plan for next Friday I do
147:52 - need to take a week off not a week off
147:54 - from making content but a week off from
147:56 - public life streaming because I have a
147:58 - video that I'm planning which is relates
148:01 - to training your own machine learning
148:03 - model that's a collaboration with
148:05 - project that's not a Tony in beta so I'm
148:10 - gonna
148:10 - record that at some point so if you're
148:12 - wondering if your I will do that as a
148:14 - member only live stream the recording
148:16 - session of that so but I do want to do a
148:19 - live stream I definitely only do a live
148:20 - stream next Friday it's probably gonna
148:22 - be might be and probably gonna be in the
148:24 - afternoon timeslot I think I'm gonna be
148:26 - doing it later in the day next Friday so
148:28 - if you're looking for when next Friday
148:30 - is gonna be it's probably gonna be that
148:31 - I don't know what just happened
148:39 - [Music]
148:46 - let's try to beat my noisy foo high
148:49 - score one more time
148:58 - oh you don't have a sound it's very
149:03 - important that you have the sound
149:13 - buh-buh-buh-buh-buh really terrible at
149:17 - this
149:19 - then I did a I can't even get one did it
149:31 - when will you post a processing
149:32 - challenge the RDP challenge is actually
149:37 - what's done in processing so that will
149:38 - be posted soon and actually the coal
149:43 - lots conjecture Cabana video I did with
149:45 - processing as well and Redfoo is there
149:48 - in the chat all right since redfish here
149:49 - in the chat we're gonna even though I
149:51 - have a meeting that starts in two
149:53 - minutes the good news is the meeting is
149:55 - within two minutes walk from where I am
149:59 - four point six degrees in here III have
150:04 - a you know here we go ready here we go
150:08 - I'm gonna get to three my goal is to get
150:10 - to three back is broken that is really
150:29 - my back is broken
150:39 - or I'd like to see say yeah ba ba ba-ba
150:44 - ba-ba ba-gawk
150:45 - that's French for it's just that there's
150:54 - gotta be some way of like regulating
151:12 - [Music]
151:25 - I've got to go
151:27 - somebody Supply thing outside don't
151:31 - don't
151:33 - don't encourage me all right hear me in
151:34 - the hallway
151:36 - [Music]
151:46 - [Music]
151:54 - [Music]
152:02 - [Music]
152:31 - [Music]
152:39 - [Music]
154:28 - so this is random this is noise Perley
154:31 - noise that is in the core random
154:33 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
154:35 - itself those numbers aren't related at
154:38 - all you pick like I'm picking random
154:40 - numbers between zero and ten nine two
154:42 - seven six one nine four eight nine two
154:47 - one three I pick nine a lot apparently
154:49 - but with Perley noise I might pick
154:51 - numbers like this two three four three
154:54 - four five six five four five six seven
154:58 - five six seven five six seven eight nine
155:01 - eight seven six well this is like Berlin
155:04 - noise performance apart
155:05 - [Music]
155:17 - like royalty noise performance apart
155:25 - with curly noise I might pick numbers
155:27 - like this pearly noise that it's early
155:37 - noise so this is hurling noise that is
155:39 - Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise
155:40 - that it's Hurley no so this is hurtling
155:42 - noise that is hurtling to her Perlin
155:44 - noise that it's Hurley more this is
155:45 - hurtling noise that it's Hurley know
155:47 - this is this is Hurley noise that it's
155:48 - Hurley so this is Hurley noise that is
155:50 - hurly-burly mrs. Hurley know that that
155:57 - is her early permanent improvement over
156:01 - that is earlier to Kerley knows that is
156:03 - earlier than is but with pearly noise I
156:08 - might pick numbers like this
156:10 - three four three four five six five
156:24 - this is like Perlin noise performance
156:27 - part

Cleaned transcript:

good morning it is Friday which has been released since last week the day of the coding trade and that is what you are watching live on YouTube I am here my name is Dan Yolo mmm chief maan and I'm here to do some coding stuff that's what happens on the coding train it's a person with the green screen and a laptop and a room with lights that are very warm and new cameras that don't shut off except for last week when they did shut off and I'm hoping that doesn't happen this week because I have a new thermostat that I turned down to make it cooler and it does not feel cooler in here at all currently in fact I don't have a camp roaming camera to show this to you it says it is 78 point one degrees in this room the temperature on the thermostat is set to 70 degrees and in fact in fact I even see one of these little like snowflake icons little snowflake icon that shows that the air is on and over here hmm people are telling me maybe the sound is quiet I'm not sure there's a vent up there you can't see the vent that's the vent there's air coming out it's warm air oh that's warm air that's weird there's another vent over here let's go examine this other vent this is what you two did for right a crazy person talking about the temperature climate change is real people it's getting very warm in here go to the whiteboard now one thing I did which is nice is I changed the settings of this particular whiteboard camera you might have noticed in previous videos that as I walk in the white balance starts to go crazy the focus goes in and out so it's no longer auto focus in fact as I come in here closer I am glory which makes me much better looking but hopefully I've tuned the focus well on this on the whiteboard so as I draw that's where the focus will be also some events here you don't feel any air coming out of them mmhmm all right so I'm gonna be here anyway I don't my glasses are all like best ugh today they're like there's nuts on them and I can't see this is not a good start highly professional operation we've got going here I do have a thing of buttons I change the cameras and stuff let's see what's happening in the chat hello from Peru it is also 1535 in South Africa so processing or p5.js today alright so let me just get right to the point which is to talk about what today's topic is so today's topic I'm going to look at a particular pretrained machine learning model called sketch RNN and this is work of researchers at Google which I will reference and point to when I get there so sketch RNN is a model that's trained off of a data set of drawings so I've used it before in previous coding challenges or videos but today I want to program an example where the user draws the user stops drawing and the AI or the computer or the algorithm or the pretrained machine learning model takes over and predicts what the next stroke should be to create a drawing of something maybe it's a cat maybe it's a rainbow maybe it's unpredictable so that's what I will be building today and by the time I leave which is around twoish hours from now did I start last week at 9 a.m. remember I did two and a half hours but I have a thing I've got about two hours so that's the time I leave hopefully that's going to be built a couple of the things I want to address first let's see if this works thank you to the sponsor of the coding train livestreams brilliant org brilliant odd org is a website for lifelong learning with a lot of interactive puzzles and full interactive courses that you can learn through doing and you can check it out at brilliant org slash coding train I will come back later in the livestream and look at the daily challenge there's a daily challenge every day I'm brilliant on organ and try to solve it along with you the viewer watching the other thing I want to do is address the swirling controversy around the coding training which is this new series that I launched recently called coding in the Cabana which I'm really excited about that's me and my sunflower shirt which I think I might actually be able to wear I was afraid I couldn't wear the sunflower shirt here due to the green screen and it's got green on it my shoe just came untied well it fix that in a minute but I think that I can and this is a new style of video that I'm doing which I'm recording at home in this little shed which just sounds a little fancy calling a Cabana and I did a video of the more rows it's kind of like my coding challenges but maybe with a slightly more relaxed vibe to it just trying to try out new things and I've already recorded the second one which I guess I am i spoiling it if you don't want to know what it is close your ears like it's not on that off the next minute or skip ahead if you're watching the recording three two one the coop's conjecture so I'm gonna do a visualization of this thing called the Collatz conjecture inspired by some numberphile videos but there was a major issue with these vit with this video to see if I can find a chalk I love that video but the sound of the chalk is and everywhere in the comments chok chok well I I guess I'd have to keep scrolling down there's a lot of more comments here eventually if I search for chalk or scratch there's a lot a lot of comments about the chalkboard and just to show you what I'm talking about also you couldn't see the chalkboard so we're talking about this thing here this chalkboard here I wanted to have a bit of an analogue feel to drawing and diagramming you know I certainly could use a tablet and that might be something I do in the future the reason why I'm bringing this up is because I used the chalkboard for the second video which I created shot and recorded before getting all those comments so I'm working with coding trained viewer Nathan who is some audio engineering expertise to see if we can lessen that chalk sound at least and then I think what I'm going to attempt I hope to maybe record another one this weekend and kind of doing these on the weekend he's try doing I certainly I could use a tablet or a Wacom board or something something like that but again I want to keep the analog feel for now so I think what I'm gonna try is an overhead camera and just paper and marker on the table so there you go that's my spiel about coding in the Cabana I also haven't figured out and this is something that I've been discussing with violet who is come on board to help me with some of the github repos stuff I don't know if I'll it's in the chat say hello to violet but the coding and the Cabana video currently isn't on the website so I guess that present probably but a lot of people made more rows Vic community contributions so I would like to figure out a way for people to share those maybe there should be another coding in the Cabana page that's different or they just end up here on this page but they have a little like the visual treatment that shows that one of the Cabana videos I don't know open to your suggestions if you have ideas about that the website is a community created project so you're welcome to contribute to it if you're interested in that Simon is alluring to me that if you are part of the coding train member program it's not really good program but I'm calling it back I think it sound very official which you can sign up through the join button on YouTube you will get an invitation into a slack chat slack it's not a slack channel it's a slack workspace which and has various channels in it one of which there's a chat going during this live stream that I'm looking at right now and Simon created a brilliant channel so we can discuss the brilliant problems there that's my spiel is that what I said hey how are you Dan I hear that you were sick ah and Daniel garden Daniel garden where's there's a CJ you Daniel garden should be garden friends I'm surprised you don't have a discord okay so this is something I've been discussing with psy who is the community manager for the coding train and hopefully they're gonna maybe post a poll or get get this discussion going in the slash channel there is a coding train discord that someone you started up I popped in there for like five minutes and then I kind of like got freaked out I've got back in you know I'm old and don't know how these things work the Internet is very confusing to me Oh get off my slack workspace I I don't love slack I mean I like a lot of things about slack I don't love using it for the coding train it's the messages aren't archived it's a closed space I mean I'm making that decision to make it a closed space but I don't really have the budget to pay for the sort of like verge it's like five dollars per user for a month which we're sort of defeat I suppose I suppose I could maybe do that if that is what the community thinks it's best I could figure out a way to do that but anyway so I've been thinking about switching over to discord and one idea is to you take over that unofficial disk or maybe make a separate one or I don't know there could be a discord than anybody can join the with like certain channels that are just for the members I really don't know what makes the most sense here so I look to you the community to help advise me on this and speak speak up and voice your thoughts about how the community can be accessible and inclusive and welcoming to everyone and that's something that's a really big priority for me and one of the things that I've learned with dealing with online communities is you can't just say that and can't just make things that people can sign up for you have to be very intentional about ways of inviting people in and and and fostering that kind of environment so hopefully I'm doing a good job at that I'm sure there are things that I'm doing not well and I and you should never be should always feel empowered to send me a message and let me know about how the community feels for you okay switching to discord is cheaper discord with member channel says Ben's what what about Facebook I'm not a fan not a fan of Facebook I do have a Facebook account I kinda know I would like to pretend that I never look at it mostly true but I think I do catch myself lurking in there from time to time there is a coding train Facebook page that doesn't get a lot of attention but it could be something I use more but I don't think that the Facebook groups is the right mechanism for the community to interact with each other that I feel pretty clear on okay Loch Ness cowrites I'm in the discord okay that's good to know TMC writes its the chalk itself that's weird and all high tech so Loch Ness feel free if the discord at the moment is an official discord I you know I don't have any oversight or purview in it it's people have selforganized to chat and talk about the coding train which I love that that's happening so Co you should feel free to share it and we can you know whoever I don't know if there were some administrators of that discord want to reach out to me to talk about if we want to make I to make that more of an official thing and yes I mean there's so many opportunities to do BOTS and interface with it I've so much that I want to do to upgrade my streaming but the truth of the matter is because I also have a fulltime job I really don't I don't spend the amount of time on the coding tray that maybe other people who are doing content creation and livestreaming fulltime are for better or worse that's just the reality and I am trying to hire more people to help me with this to expand the the feature set of what I'm doing as well as figuring out new ways to do stuff like create the content create this new coding the Cabana series from home but some things that I want to do just off the top of my head that just to mention and people can remind me about those are I want to get interstitial animations for starting and ending and taking breaks and that sort of thing having more BOTS that are kind of doing moderation and the chat or just that are fun and playful that can happen in the chat whether it's their discord or the YouTube chat that stuff I want to do I am working to launch a new merchandise store with standard standard is a company that helps out creators they're really a community of creators and they help with sponsorships and merchandise stores and things you can check them out at standard TV they also have a new streaming system called nebula which you should definitely check out and I'm some of my content is on there and I'm thinking about new ways to put content on there as well but but once we get the new standard store up and running then I'm gonna have new rewards for people to sign up for members and patrons and that kind of thing so that's just taking a very long time and if you're curious have questions about that you can reach out to community managers I also if you tweet at the coding train on Twitter that's on Saipan adjust that account and also on Instagram the Instagram has changed it is now instagram.com slash the coding dot train so this is the coding train Instagram also run by Sai and you can just sort of check out stuff that's being posted there I'm hoping that we can I can do more with sharing your work that people who are watching and making things on Instagram and that's something I'm trying to set up some new processes for alright know what else do I've got to say Oh also you should follow my cat's on Instagram mango and let's check on let's check in on that mango and goose look at this there we go this is very cute that's also Greta and this is Evie Greta and Evie look at those ears have you ever seen a cat with like foxy ears like that they're pretty amazing they're kittens I love them they're super fun you can follow them on Easter ah I knew there was a reason we're gonna make drugs of cats alright let's have a little fun I should probably do this no you know what I'm gonna take a break I want to mention a coating trained viewer Redfoo who has created a game called noisy food I oh and actually did a livestream about it Redfoo apparently learned to code from watching a lot of my videos also shoutout to coding garden with CJ the game that Redfoo made I believe that back end was I gotta answer this question from Jonas or Eunice in a second the the back end of red Foos game noisy foo was created from based on tutorials from CJ excellent coding channel if you want to find a channel that livestreams really often I mean I can't speak for CJ don't know what his future plans are but I see a pop up of almost every day of a livestream from CJ so I highly recommend you check out coding garden with CJ alright so check I maybe I will come back and play this game a little later let's just play it once right now just for fun oh oh oh oh you know here's the thing actually I gotta get a certain sound effect to happen so I got to change my system preferences here and I got to go under sound and I got to change this to multi output device so I think now you should hear the audio from the let's just see why did that come through it should have let's try one more time you get like a slightly better score here don't bump bump ow that makes me so happy I'm saying it oh my kids are very tired of me talking about this game noisy foo leaderboard let's see where am I here coding train coding train hello coding train your ranking is 58 Oh dare you to try to beat my high score here coding train I got a high score a 2 to take that David is writing Schiffman did you see that I beat your score yes I think almost everybody on here is beaten might score there are few people who are lower but have fun with this I had a lot of fun with this check out Redfoo I don't think Redfoo needs me to promote his stuff but check it out it's a lot of fun maybe I'll try to play in a little more later ok holy if only I could play and dance to some of red foods music without getting like the YouTube copyright engine spinning that would be kind of fun I'm sorry I'm sorry For Party Rocking that's all I have to say now my glasses by the way I'm now realizing really could use an upgrade let's move on to the topic of today so ah give me a minute here to pull up some links that I want to refer to Oh ukulele tutor submissions so um Lokesh writes can you react to ukulele tuner submissions so I think I did a bunch of those already I don't know that a lot of new ones have come in maybe Lokesh I don't know maybe you you posted a new one in Alexander this if you if you're really looking for the drawing with sketch or an end content and that's all you want I might suggest waiting for the edited version that will come out my process has gotten a little bit slower there's some good things about that and some notsogreat things about that but that will come out soon but most of the live stream is yes me wasting your time that it's a 100% accurate tune out good it's a beautiful day in New York City I'm training for the marathon exercise go outside play some music meditate all of these things are probably more valuable uses of your time than this if you want the tutorial wait for the edited version I would say I look caleb is eating oatmeal oatmeal my breakfast of choice big fan big fan oatmeal oatmeal huge fan oatmeal just huge fan oatmeal you Tran I was responding oh you clearly tuner but I did I'm glad that you mention that because let's find the ukulele tuner video I got to work on my SEO apparently oh boy coding train we're gonna get there there we go because I do want to mention a comment that came in recently which was really helpful to me let's try maybe sorting by newest first here we go so this is from a wisp chart interesting name from from on YouTube and wispy art rights one thing that I need to point out let's see is that your detection of closest note is not working properly because notes are existing in sense scale 100 cents per note 1,200 cents per octave while you are trying to operate in frequency scale Hertz the problem is that relation B frequency scale note scale is not linear so closest note by frequency designed equal closest note by sense distance so it sounds like from that description which you know I'm assuming is accurate wispy art sounds knowledge bonus writing in a thoughtful manner but I mean like fact check this and I'm sure people in the chat might be able to offer their thoughts as well but that if I apply some additional math in terms of this values that are coming out of the machine learning model and think about this other scale then I might be able to have a more effective interaction and visualization of how close I am to the correct note here is how and so wispy art maybe has made their own version in Scala skaila I don't notice that it's another programming language and then here is a live pitch detector that also uses CREP so let's look at this and see how this one works I say allow and let's let's get the ukulele here well this doesn't appear to be working why are you not working you're a very nice ladies by the way this was not in tune I didn't ever Ellis strings were left over from last week that was my little improvisation I don't know why but I'll investigate this later but that's something that I would love to address or think about and thank you so much you know I don't catch these days I'm not catching all the comments that are on YouTube but I try to keep a look and every once in a while something really thoughtful and helpful comes in and thank you to that user interaction Oh an assignment is telling me something I don't know what Simon's telling me did I not do something correctly click click click hello hello click click click user interaction click click click alright alright but I want to move on because I want to get to what I the topic of the day hold on everyone I'm getting an important message Simon thank you for the reminder about the user interaction and understand what you're saying now matthew is pointing out that maybe the focus is a little bit fuzzy and I think it is I think that let me see let me see how I can best fix this by the way I did a little investigation and it appears that there is a way for me to I'm using these sony alpha 7 3 cameras and that appears and by the way I think this one went off well that's not good it's getting hot in here so I believe there's a way that I can remote control these cameras from through WiFi or Bluetooth which if there's an app or even from the computer I could adjust the focus and white balance and that kind of thing but what I'm gonna do right now is I'm going to put the train whistle here which is a pretty far back approximately where I stand Elizabeth maybe that then let's just put it here no this is gonna work I'm tryna I last week I had the mug and I could focus on I think what I could do is I could just pull my laptop back further I do want to fix the focus what do I have I have a book of random digits up here this will work this is like by accident I am buzz marketing a product that I don't mean but I really like it but this is not an official sponsor but I can use this to do the focus so this is about more like where I'm standing then the actual laptop screen so I think if I go and adjust the focus on that give me a second here I'm walking over to the can this is a oneperson operation here how to focus on focus I can even go a little past it because I'm a little bit further behind it that should be better how's this look better better worse better worse if I move back I think this is better I think this is better yes I hope Alexander is not continuing to watch hope they've been outside 96,000 120 you know I think I'm on the same page over time let's go for the whoo let's read some today on the coding train Gaussian deviance two point six five four that's a negative negative two point six five four negative point three one two point one seven zero negative 1.645 point zero seven nine point four one four point five seven nine point three four five point four seven two five one point five three one point one point two six eight one point four nine two negative three points them thank you for those of you who tweeted at me some collective collector's item original prints of this book I'm kind of afraid to like press the prime I don't mind most of them are for sale for like five hundred six hundred dollars and this to me feels like a purchase well worth it in terms of two things my coding trained hordes of cash but I feel that it's a little bit unreliable what sort of condition it's in some one of them says pages are missing one says it's like a third printing so I need to do some more research here but as some of you pointed out that the over the weekend or yesterday a couple days ago the channel hit still here nine hundred thousand subscribers which is kind of nuts and so getting there getting there to that you know moment of that's nice thing to sort of celebrate or enjoy I don't think we should optimize our lives towards subscribers there's more important things I would be happy if it stopped right now and I was you know just bringing people into the community who wouldn't otherwise who would like to learn to code who didn't have their own otherwise have an opportunity that's more meaningful but you know it's happening and so I could it makes sense okay good and I really would like to have that collector's item original print so be on the lookout do a little internet research if you got five minutes tweet at me if you find if you if you feel like you found something that's really the the one I should I should just press that button click that button especially if it's like some kind of local community bookstore that happens to have a copy as opposed to just you know blah blah blah ah jonas asks again why are you on the front page of processing so first of all that video on the front page of processing is a very out of date and I feel slightly embarrassed by it I mean the video is fine but I feel slightly embarrassed being there on the front page with a pretty outofdate video so I think it actually would be nice to make a new video for the home page reprocessing anybody want to help work on that that's a thing but I am director or administrator on what the right term to use is of the processing Foundation which is a nonprofit organization that organizes events and does initiatives and educational initiatives and community initiatives around open source and creative coding and so I've been involved with the processing project since around 2003 I am I know means one of the creators of processing nor am I born of really the maintainer the processing I'm just an enthusiastic supporter and participant in the processing community and happened to be there on the homepage okay we got to get started with this before that everything starts to go to crud we're gonna do this are we gonna do this in the p5 web editor yeah why not how am I feeling about the p5 web editor today I think I can make this happen interactive drawing with sketch Arnott okay could you increase the volume you're talking is a bit quiet so nobody else has said that thank you for noting that MX and but I'm afraid to increase the volume because sometimes when I do that in the recording there's clipping or peaking and so I'm gonna assume that maybe you that that's not a universal feeling but please let me know particularly in the slack channel if which I can catch those messages a bit more quickly if there are any issues alright alright I'm about to get started what's it so it's only 40 minutes in by the time I code well how's this month this is crazy so this is the mug you might remember this infamous mug and the keying is so much better this is a green mug but it's a slightly different shade of green that the keying is actually so much more precise in this new studio that I'm recording it I am 3 decibels less than the old set up I am happy to turn it louder but I am concerned it's not the nice thing is that can always get turned up in when the edited version happens well let's let me let me try something let me tie my shoe enjoy this dot as always I always forget to this stop Oh thank you everybody my mic was off I'm gonna wait till everybody realizes that I figure that out and I was playing with the audio I know this sounds is off the sounds off have to wait about thirty seconds now yes thank you CJ the microphone is muted I just don't I want to wait till the messages stop coming in telling me that okay and now people are telling me it's too quiet okay sounds good now here we go ready everybody ready hello and welcome to a coding challenge drawing with the computer with an AI whose buki Halloween [Laughter] no Halloween no Halloween references those don't those aren't very evergreen although it is about time to watch my arrow [ __ ] videos again hello and welcome to a coding challenge interactive drawing with the computer so what you are looking at right here is a demo from the magenta project this is the sketch RNN demo and what's happening here is I the a person is can walk up to this computer machine start drawing whoops let me clear one more shot when we're shot it's 80 just someone you know it's over 80 degrees the thermostat is on it's set to 70 degrees take three hello and welcome to a coding challenge interactive sketch are an N drawing you realize that this is how I just basically spent my entire day just like saying stuff trike again over and over again hello and welcome to a coding challenge drawing with sketch RNN now you might be wondering what sketch are an N that's ok that's good if you don't know what it is you're in the right place I'm going to try at best but my drive try my best to explain sketch RNN and give you some background reading material that you can look into to do a deeper dive and then make a project like this one right here I'm going to attempt to recreate this exact project so this is a demo on the magenta magenta is a project around machine learning ai and art from Google research and this is a project where you the user or me right now can't clear the screen you can draw I'm gonna draw like a little circle here and another little like this I'm gonna draw a little tail and then see if the computer can pick up where I left off and continue drawing a cat and you can see it's doing this over and over again I can also switch to say a pineapple this will be fun and I can hit clear and I can maybe I can start the pineapple and see oh look at that see what comes next Wow like magic but it's not magic this is machine learning so if you want the I think as soon as it gets to be 80 degrees is when this happens let's see if the focus at least stays today one thing I could do is to focus even the focus doesn't appear to have stayed why does the focus even like die I am very out of focus today's coding train I need a like brilliant two poster I can just put up here you know new cameras they don't go to sleep all this work and I am just destined destined to never be able to live stream without cameras that power themselves off this is actually worse than it was before at least before it happened on a schedule and the focus didn't get lost one thing I'm gonna do just briefly is I'm gonna open the door I don't know if this door is gonna make its way and get some cool air in here a little bit crazy that I'm doing this because now I am actually livestreaming with the door propped over anybody walking by in the hallway hello it's early enough in the morning that there aren't too many people here but I can feel the air coming in woo woo human rights the preshow dance was too hot for the camera I hopefully the air coming in here is going to help this by the way I'm not I will not be back live streaming next Friday without this being fixed so hopefully I can get this resolved I'm just gonna let some air come in here actually and maybe I'll get a maybe I'll refill my coffee that's always a good idea I'm gonna keep the mic on this is a bad idea but you're gonna hear me talking as I go over to the kitchen and I should probably just get some ginger tea we usually switch the ginger tea around the lemony maybe this was like a snowflake here we go you wanna do is I'm gonna also let the camera the offer you have a fan in there no but clearly that would help I think if I leave that camera off for a little bit everybody just take a little break so copper asks how old is the camera it's brand new it is a sony alpha 7s I can move over to here for a second I turned the lights off in this room the lights are LED lights they really shouldn't eat up the room so much but I think the power supply's get kind of warm go quickly look and see if there's a fan somewhere on the floor here I'll be right back I'm gonna leave my mic on I know it might actually that's dangerous cuz if I go too far the wireless connection might start to make weird noise and so let me mute them I'm gonna mute the mic and I will be right back I'm gonna look for a fan I'll just leave it here drawing a pineapple there was the pineapple pineapple pineapple there we go all right and then I'm gonna put this music back on sorry everybody I'll be back I'm looking for a fan well it's already cooled down just 78 degrees in there so where does pineapple ever I'm gonna power the camera back up there is someone is looking for a fan we're gonna knock on the door I'm gonna try to move on all right I'm very sorry about this I'm gonna push through and see if I can get this project completed I have a little over an hour we're just not good I'm also going to take about a half an hour I'll take a break and hopefully the cameras are gonna comply with me we got it down to 77 degrees dropped by three points just opening the door and during the lights off for a few minutes and maybe a fan will arrive okay all right here we go whoa that's an interesting pineapple it's really it's particularly sad because I lost all the momentum and like what I was talking about but it'll get edited together again somehow so what what did I last say I'm you know what I'm not gonna worry about it I'm just gonna random repeating myself so I can get moving here I'm so sorry everybody so sketch on sketch RNN is a pre train is it sketch RNN is a machine learning model that was trained on drawings drawings of a lot of different things like this pineapple here the data set that was used to train it is a data set called the quick draw data set which has about 50 million drawings in it I believe in or around 300 I think it's 384 but I'm not really sure the sketch RNN was trained on a data set of drawings that draw that data set is from the Google quick draw data set so I really I lost all my momentum and energy I should just play like the noisy food game or read some random numbers but I got a push forward overheating is a common problem with the Sony a7 roomtemperature shouldn't be the problem right smacks do you think max that just having like a small fan that's pointed at the camera would help I mean the whole point of these cameras is to yeah I don't know all right I'm sorry I got I got a I gotta go got a move on okay the quickdraw dataset has millions and millions of drawings in it and was collected as people played this game called quickdraw where the player is asked to draw a particular category and I think there are I think it's 384 but somewhere well over 300 different kinds of drawings in this data set if you want to learn more about what a recurrent neural network is and how the model is trained I'll reference a few things that I'll link in the description first you should definitely check out this paper by David ha and Douglass AK from Google brain where they present the sketch RNN pre train model you can read this blog post from 2017 that is on the magenta projects blog well time out I think maybe there's a fan oh you found one awesome donated by Rob okay I will give it a try oh thank you so much yeah Oh interesting okay all right yes thank you all right I mean I think what I'm gonna do is go point this at the camera but first I'm going to just test it by plug it into the wall here can we place it I don't have like long flowing hair and I don't have I don't know what the right music would be that's the highest setting No my flowing hair isn't working okay all right so I'm putting this on the floor right now um actually you know what I have a table well I'm gonna move the table right underneath the camera I am going to is this table go higher it doesn't see where the that's fine though I am going to put the fan on the table pointing it directly at the camera and plugging it in it's making a loud noise that's not great but I think as I step away you'll hear that left this table goes back I feel like I should get it even closer so weird it's tabled definitely with fire I'm not gonna worry about that alright there is a fan let me just put my face in front of the camera see if I'm getting the air yeah that's my year by the way hoping that's gonna help keep the camera cool what do we think what are the chances this is gonna work put it as low as possible to get the cold air and make it flow up towards the camera Nick is asking you're gonna say anything about the red food collab so first of all I wouldn't call it a cola IV red food made this whole thing all on his own without anything that I did other than existing and maybe providing some video tutorials but I did play the game a little earlier and I wish I had more time to play it more let me just check let me just check is this sound reasonable right now like is the sound of the fan too loud can hear the fan a bit but no problem I could turn on the noise reduction but I think I'm gonna leave the noise in there we can always post process it perfect okay great thank you everybody I kind of want to just start this whole thing over I know I know you're all gonna be upset by that but I feel like I've lost the momentum and it's going to help me to have that back so I'm going to start this coding challenge over set auto power off temp too high Oh is there actually a setting on the camera so Abraham is saying set so if someone can't really do that easily right now unfortunately it would involve me like taking the camera off it's mounted directly to the wall so to be able to see the menu I have to remove it so unless the problem becomes really terrible I might do that but if someone if if that's a legitimate thing I will look into that alright here we go everybody take five million hello and welcome to a coding challenge interactive drawing with sketch are an end now maybe you're watching this and thinking to yourself well what sketch are an N then you're in the right place because I will explain to you a bit about what sketch RNN is and provide you with links in the description to a lot of background material if you want to do a deeper dive into the machine learning model that is sketch RNN but what I'm going to build in this video that you're watching is a my own version of this exact project so this is a project on the magenta website magenta is a project from Google that is around a creativity and AI there's a lot of music examples with the magenta project and what you're seeing here is the AI so to speak I mean it's really a machine learning model making predictions I'm drawing a cat and I can hit clear here and I can begin drawing the cat like I could just stop there and it's going to try to fill in the rest of the cat for me let's see if I try to draw one like this with like a like a sort of body and like a tail we can sort of see what happens so this is the eye view sketch aren't in before because I can generate a drawing from nothing with sketch RNN but what I want to do in this video is create something where the person using the computer draws with the mouse but you could imagine all sorts of interface interaction ideas that you could do and then has the machine learning model takes over and finishes the drawing and you can see there are quite a few other models the sketch aren't in the sketch are an end model isn't one model it's actually a collection of many models based on these categories because the data that was used to train the machine learning model is from a project called quick draw so quick draw is a game that you can play also from Google where the website prompts you to draw something and then it tries to like guess to see if like you're drawing the correct thing and you people playing that game Google collected all those drawings so there's a lot of interesting questions around the data set itself but it is an open source data set as 50 million drawings I think there are 384 categories not 100% sure about that and so that's the data set that it was trained on the kind of machine learning model architecture is something called a recurrent neural net so maybe at some point I'll have some video tutorials that look more closely at what a recurrent neural network is if you want to learn more all definitely there's a wonderful article that I read now this video's description pause for a second Rohan and Lenny recurrent neural network yeah this is this is a wonderful article that I read that really taught me a lot about how recurrent neural networks work it's quite technical but also pretty friendly and uses some nice examples to describe how they're working but you can also read the original paper by David ha and Douglas Eck researchers at Google brain that describe the sketch our 10 model how it was trained and all of the details behind it including you know the real lower level machine learning math details luckily for us I also mentioned there's this nice blog post pause for a second I put on do not disturb I put on do not disturb when I livestream I put on do not disturb it's off for some reason on your on ok you can also read this excellent blog post on the magenta blog called draw together with a neural network which mentions other collaborators and gives you more details also about how sketch our nan works guess what though I'm going to start coding now because one of the projects that I work on which is an open source library for machine learning called ml5 Jas is built on top of tensorflow Jas which is Google's open source JavaScript version of tension flow of machine learning the open source library and ml5 also includes the sketch RNN model as part of it so if I go here to reference and I sort of scroll down here on to the left interesting left this is actually a mistake this shouldn't be here under text so I better just sort of like I can find the sketch RNN page and read a bit more about sketch RNN and get some starter code aim the fan at the camera wall interesting so far I'm feeling good about it I shouldn't I shouldn't say anything because it hasn't powered off yet but that's good it is eighty one point four degrees in here people sweat dripping down it's like a sauna saunas are good for you right the good for my back I have back issues but feeling pretty good did you know that I'm training for the marathon hopefully we're about that later I should mention a Ross of saying the ml five pages so buggy the website is actually going a big is having an overhaul right now so there's a lot of issues on the website so I'm gonna try not to lean on using it too much during this video but hopefully in the next few days and into next week it'll a lot of this stuff but please if you're finding things that aren't working or missing feel free to file those as issues okay let me just quickly also do this okay hmm let's see here just give me a second here to organize the screen I think 400 by 400 ePHI nand that means I can move it over to here which means I can move this over a little bit more I can also stand much further over so if I stand over here then I can move this back over this way all right I think this is going to be good how's the font size I think it's okay first thing that I need to do if I'm going to use the ml5 library is make sure to import it into my p5 sketch so on the getting starting page there's actually a p5 web editor template I could click on but I'm actually just gonna copy this reference and guess what new version of ml5 out today zero point 4.0 lots more to say about that in other videos to come but I'm gonna go back to my sketch in the web editor I'm going to click over to find index of HTML and I'm going to add it as one of the libraries right up here in index.html click save and go back to sketch a yes and I'm ready to code I'm going to add the preload function in order to load the sketch RNN model so I'll make a variable I'll call it sketch RNN I'll say sketch are 10 equals and I'll go back to the reference ml 5 sketch our net model and call back whoops and it everybody drink your cocoa and the model I want let's tow the model is hold on a second is this actually on the documentation page I don't think so so let me just give me a second here behind the scenes this need should be on the page but I'm gonna just grab this the model that I the model is a string that indicates what category what is the thing that I want to draw and I can actually find a list of all of them here you'll find that I'll link to this as well and you can see here's all the options so I'm going to start with a cat although I'm very tempted to do a cat bus cat pig and I'll come back to why those even exist in the first place you can think about that right now and how you might train a machine learning model why there might be a category that has two words combined Halloween the cat pigs are coming to get you a cat pig but I'm going to start with just cat and I don't need a call back because I'm loading the bottle in preload so I can assume that once I get to set up the model is loaded and let me run it no errors good sign model is loaded sketch our net initialized and why using sketch RNN is actually as easy as just calling a single function the generate function so I can say in Sketchup let's get up I could say in setup sketch RNN generate and then all I need to do is give it a callback so this is a moment to over here give it a callback and the callback I'm going to say got path stroke I'm not sure what to call this I'm gonna call it stroke path got stroke path and I'm gonna write this function function got stroke path that receives two arguments an error in case something went wrong and then an actual stroke path object or I shouldn't maybe call this results I don't know but I'm gonna call it stroke path and I'm just gonna say console dot log stroke path let's run this and see if anything comes out in the console things work it's like so rare in coding so this is now the foundation upon which everything else that I do in this example will be built so let me unpack this for you for a second a recurrent neural network is a kind of machine learning model that deals with sequential data that could be text like R comma a comma a comma n comma B I don't know why I'm putting the commas in there that could be text like a sequence of characters are a I and B Oh W it could be text like a sequence of words qu followed by qu it could be music maybe a sequence is a melody sub notes and rhythms a sequence each one of these units in a sequence you can think of as the state so in this case the state is very simple it's a single character here it's maybe with words it's a little more complex certainly musical notes the state might have which note is it what's the amount of time the duration of that note drawing a drawing can also be thought of as a sequence draw draw draw draw draw draw draw this is a sequence of vector paths or stroke paths as I'm calling them strokes their strokes of a pen and you'll notice back here in the code there's a DX a dy and a pen pen status so all of the states each element of the sequence involves a vector path a change in X a change in Y and whether the pen was down or up is the pen down as the pen up and there's actually a third state which is is the drawing completed which is end so if I all I need to do is figure out a way to say like okay you gave me this state now I'm gonna take that data and visualize it interestingly enough I'm gonna visualize it in a very literal form by drawing the path according to that vector in a canvas but maybe that state could be translated into music or words or some other kind of media how could you create an audio version of sketch RNN that would be something to think about there is a tricky thing going on here which is when do I choose to draw because if you've used p5 before you know that there's this function draw that you're asked to write which is always looping that's the animation loop and generally that's where you want to do your drawing but the stroke the data for the stroke has come back in this callback so I could get rid of the draw loop and do some my own timing stuff and draw in here but I think what I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a variable just I need to tie my shoe again I keep stepping on my shoelaces so I just need to fix this I'm very glad that the fan seems to be working people are really worried about the audio I'm gonna I guess I'm gonna I just I just what I'm seeing is like the audio getting all the way up to the red I can turn it up a tiny bit I don't want to change it I'm already is not just gonna fix the audio stuff when this gets edited so I apologies to the the audio issues that people are having I'm gonna create a variable called current stroke and I'm going to whenever I get a new stroke I'm gonna say current stroke equals stroke path just gonna set I'm gonna get the Dana coming in and set it to a global variable then in draw I'm going to ask if current stroke exists I'm just gonna say if it's you have to say if current stroke if it exists I can just do that in JavaScript by just checking if the variable any variable that has stuff in it will return true if it's an object then I want to draw a line from some value X Y to X plus current stroke DX Y plus current stroke dy so in other words I need some new data here I need to have this idea of where is the current pen and this is up to me this is not part of the model the model is just telling me relative directions to go so I'm gonna create my own variable called x and y in set up let me initialize it to just the center of the canvas let me just fill in the background with a white background and then draw this line let's say a stroke zero a stroke wait for so it's a little bit thicker and let's run this now there it is my cat okay great Thank You CJ CJ is telling me be confident in your audio my drawing of course has stopped because I only asked the generate function just gives me what is essentially the next path the next vector so once I have that I need to ask for another one so there's a bunch of different ways I could implement this but for me the logic is such that setup is going to ask for the first one then I'm going to receive it in the callback draw it and then right here after I've drawn it let me ask for the next one so I could just do exactly this again but what I want to also do if I'm asking for the next one let me set current stroke to nothing again let me just sort of clear that variable so the draw draw might continue to loop but it won't continue to draw that same stroke over and over again until a new one comes in and fills in to that variable so I think now if I run this we're going to see the following okay what did I forget to do right so I drew the vector path but even move the pen to the next spot so I need to say X + equals current stroke DX and the same thing y + equals current stroke dy let's try that again there we go ok so I can't erase the background and draw because if I do that let me take off the console.log I need to I want to see the drawing continue I don't want to erase the background and there we go now this doesn't look exactly right right I mean that's kind of a cat solar always scribbling scraggly cat but and I'm realizing I did all this in my snowflake video but you know hey this I could have just picked off from there but c'est la vie c'est la blah blah blah that's life Wow Oh eightytwo point five degrees people in summertime here on the coding train it's my tropical drink in the Cabana the thing that's missing here is I haven't dealt with the pen I really should only be drawing the line I always want to move the X&Y but only if current stroke dot pen is down do I want to actually draw that line let's try this now oh I spelled that wrong let's try this now something's off what is it's so hot in here it's crazy well I'm almost to my break at least where I can like open the door get some cool air in here as we look at the brilliant challenges I need like an ice ice iced drink let's try it one more time so I'm almost certain I know what the problem is here which is that the it's for the next stroke yeah I know Oscar e is telling me the correct answer and I know this to be the case I'm just trying to think how to explain it I know what the problem is here and I'm having a bit of a sense of deja vu because I went through this in the snowflake video but if this sequence where every single state has a DX dy and a penn state the penn state is actually describing what you should be doing for the next stroke it's a little bit weird but it's off by one i suppose that's because the drawing always starts with the pen down that's not entirely true i think so though i don't know about that the drawing always starts with the pen down and also there's a penn state of end so when you get a dxdy you do that and then the next thing is n so this value that comes back in the pen is actually for the next the next state so what I need to think about this in a more clever way so I'm going to have a separate variable that keeps track of next pen and it's gonna start with down and then we're going to say is if next pen is down which it will be then draw the line and then next pen equals current stroke pen so I'll save it for the next time around and then always pick it up again and I'll obviously stop if next pen is end so I can say something like if next pen equals end I could say you know no loop and return this will just kill the p5 sketch it will stop but I do want to draw it first oh no but it would come next anyway so I would have drawn it previously let's try this kind of looks like a cat right so this is essentially a perfect reek so this is essentially a recreation of my snowflake sketch RNN sketch which I felt like I needed to do just to kind of refresh my memory a look at the new ml5 and make sure it's working in the web editor the way that I want because now is the moment the important part of this video where I want to pick up a user drawing a person's drawing who's using this sketch and feed that in well people are just chatting just chatting amongst themselves in the chat but before I do that part I'm going to take a short break to talk to you briefly about the coding trains sponsor and that is brilliant org so I'm not this is like perfect timing because I also need to take a little break to get some cool air into this room we're now up to 83 degrees I have a feeling there's some excellent courses and challenges on the brilliant website around a statistics and temperature and climate you're probably simon probably knows where they are and can find them for me but if you aren't familiar well let me just click around here for a second so a brilliant is and I've got my fancy new set up here brilliant is a website which has a handson approach so there's actually 60 interactive courses on the website most of what I do is on the channel it's like look at the daily challenge and that's one of the ways that I enjoy using brilliant it's like I have five minutes on the on the subway I'm at home I'm with my kids let's look at a fun problem but it also has full courses in particular there's a new computer science fundamental courses and so you can see here some of the courses there's actually one an artificial neural networks that I'm really hoping to dig into soon so if you're looking for supplemental material and and I mostly mind this for ideas for my coding challenges but there's storytelling there's code writing there's interact challenges and lots of problems to solve so you can sign up for free at brilliant org slash coding train you can also unlock all of the features in all the courses through a premium subscription and the first 200 people to subscribe via that link will get a 20% discount so what I want to do now quickly is just move over to brilliant org and look at what the daily challenge is now normally and I guess I need to continue this course that I'm doing which is data structures that would be good I need to do more videos on data structures so learn more about the instructors but I would've actually just skipped to a yesterday's challenge really quickly because this is what I love like this is actually a coding challenge themed around what's in a variable and one of the things I love to looked at this yesterday Thank You Simon for pointing this out to me is that this if you weren't this to us right x equals x plus 1 is the most normal coherent thing to say and I actually just used it in my project x equals x plus DX but this is actually an absurd statement if you weren't a programmer because X does not equal X plus 1 that's impossible it's wrong it's false but there's a nice challenge around this let's look at it so if X is a number Y is a number if you write code like the following I'm gonna do this over here if I were to write x equals x plus y so x equals something y equals something and Y then also equals x plus y and remember these are two lines of code executing one after another the value stored in X is greater than the value stored in Y which one of these is the correct answer so how after this basically X is greater than why would return true this camera does not have a fan on it I thought maybe I was giving this camera a nice little break by moving to this one I didn't actually turn it off so this one doesn't have the fan I'm not so concerned about that because first of all doesn't seem to lose its focus or maybe it does and it just I'm getting lucky with the focus but it looks still like it's in focus and I'm using it much less so um so how could this possibly be true let's just try some numbers X is 5 y is 2 so x equals 5 plus 2 I'm going to have 7 and then y equals 7 plus 2 I'm gonna have 9 so X that's not true so clearly there's got to be something to do with a negative number here so we could probably say if X is negative or if Y is negative my instinct is y is negative I'm probably getting that backwards oh my god let's try what if Y is negative 2 so x equals x plus y yeah because if y is negative x goes down then Y goes further this is kind of like we're incrementing so this totally makes sense I was right it was right ding ding 5 minus 2 is 3 and then 3 minus 2 is 1 so yeah I think just as long as Y is negative that's gonna be a great game so I like this because I like oh but this is such a grief you were if you're not a programmer most of you watching this have done some coding before if you haven't welcome I hope that this is enjoyable and you're following along to the best that you can I guess I would suggest going back and looking at some of my beginner tutorials or other beginner tutorials you could find but but I like this because this is really tricky to think through if you haven't coded before it even a little bit hard for me right now just cuz this looks so circular in a weird sort of way let's go back and let's try to what do we the input value of Y was negative so let's click that let's click Submit correct I started a oneday street I kind of want to do today's challenge do I have time let's see if we can do it quickly because it looks super interesting Lee has a visual pattern rearrange the dots so in the pattern below we add a new row to the bottom of the triangle to each step the next term will then be 10 plus 5 so we have 1 3 1 2 3 4 5 6 we're adding 3 adding 4 oh you're adding 4 here to get to 10 right I see we could extend this pattern as far as we want making larger and larger triangles but is it possible to skip straight to the number of dots in the hundreds triangle so what's the formula I guess okay I guess they're showing us the solute I was gonna have to figure it out the solution here first second third if we rearrange and double the truck oh look at this so the idea here is that you have a 1 by 2 a 2 by 3 a 3 by 4 so you always have a n if I draw up here you always have an N by n plus 1 photo you can't see that ok everybody I'll use you always have you know some sort of grid that is for example 3x4 half of it is this so you have n times n plus one is the total number of dots and just divide that by two is the half number of that so that's the formula so for a hundred you'd have a hundred times 100 plus 100 1/2 okay you could do that math in your head over the calculator n times n1 here it is I don't have to do that math it's right here 5050 can you find the pattern and the dots below well this is the same thing right it's just end times n plus 1 divided by 2 plus 1 plus n oh no no no this is a different pattern right oh because the triangle here is arranged on its side and the triangle here is arrangement so I think by the way weekend this is an extra dot dot dot dot so there's definitely a blow it gives me choices well it's got to be this one right because it's got to be I have a plus n that's what I'm thinking it's got to have a plus n like I could figure out what's the formula 1 goes to 3 2 goes to 6 3 goes to 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4 times 5 is 20 divided by 2 is 10 it's got to be this one so I'm just by eyeballing it it's this one but why is that n plus 1 times n plus 2 is what well let's click on it let's click on it let's just see if I'm right just through that sheer instinct oh no there's a plus end down here ah I'm not on percent confident now cuz I didn't scroll all the way down there's another plus n so well first of all you could do these kind of tests my way test taking skill you could do process of elimination because for example 3 plus 1 is 16 I mean that's not the right answer is it 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 that's wrong 3 times 4 is 12 divided by 2 is 6 plus 3 is 9 that's not right so it's definitely this one so like process elimination I can just do it but there's there's probably a way to draw this in the interest of time there we go all right absolutely correctly I don't have to chat up there you get work figure I'd already mentioned this I should get the chat off backup sorry about this I'm I shouldn't rush through this I like to let people in the chat I'll usually I'll take the break and let people answer it but I've lost all of my control panels I forgot about my whole technique here n times n plus 1/2 so cast is writing this but if I go down here oh if you think doubling it n plus 1 times n plus 2 is the total number of things in a parallelogram because these are parallelograms right parallelogram as shown let me is that right ok the camera went off again well good news is the fan seems to be working because this camera doesn't have a fan pointed at it and that one does and it's the only one that's this one is the one that's powering off so what time is it oh okay that's okay I'm gonna take a few minute break in a second so it's alright 1 2 3 oh this makes sense right because well I don't think I drew that correctly oh and I totally did not draw that correctly yeah hold on I did I just drew it in a slightly weird way like the way that it's drawn is to is making these so that's like this I have three and then I have three and this is N equals one if okay yeah if you consider this N equals two then you would be right and but this is n this is for N equals one so if N equals one you have you have three times two which is n plus 1 times n plus 2 and that would be the case for if I add three more and then double that so yes I'm doing this sort of intuitively there's probably a more elegant way that you could describe this and certainly what I one of the things is my favorite thing to do is reading other people's solutions and how they explain it oh look at this that's cool even with some like nice mathematical notation I like how this is drawn oh look at this and then like with some this is great so what I'm gonna do now is I'm gonna take a break if you don't already have a brilliant org account you can sign up right now if anybody has the inclination to make a p5 sketch that visualizes this with like maybe n is a slider and then shows the total number that would be something you could do that's something that I enjoy doing and then you I like to post my code solution here in the comments on brilliant so I'm gonna take a short break leave this up here I am going to actually turn the camera off just to let it cool down a little bit I'm going to prop open the door I'm going to take a break just for maybe two or three minutes I got to come back quickly and say that cachi and Cass are discussing equals one I'm gonna say once again coordinates and autotune and the internet will fix that for me coordinates and we're back the lights are off the door is open the links are down low it's quiet we're going to go back to doing sketch RNN thank you to brilliant for the sponsorship I'm going to I've got the temperature down to 82 degrees follow me 82 it was at 83.5 we're now at 82 I'm gonna turn the lights back on it's gonna warm up in here oh the Sun is coming up it is getting bright good morning everybody welcome to the coding training we're back from our break we're gonna finish making this interactive sketch RNN project I have about a half an hour to do this before I've really got to go which I think it's quite realistic so hopefully nothing will go terribly wrong and no time for chitchat no time for chitchat now I have this cat and this the correct generated drawing a duplicate of what I did in the snowflake a sketch RNN challenge but here I am ready to add the next component which is a person coming here drawing their own starter path and then having sketch aren't intake over how would I do that so one of the things that I have to revisit is this state right once again I need to all this state any given state light Sonia you need to revisit the state so any given moment of the drawing is a dxdy and a Penn State so I need to collect a sequence of those from the person who is drawing one way I can do that is I want to the drawing I'm not going to be too sophisticated about this I'm gonna have the user start the drawing when they click the mouse and stop when they release the mouse so I basically want to events that are tied to the canvas so I'm going to store the canvas in a variable and I'm gonna say canvas mousepressed start drawing and canvas mouse mouse released I'm honestly finished drawing but it's not finished a sketch RNN I can say sketch are an end start so I no longer want to call generate right here in setup I'm not going to start generating I'm going to first collect the data from the user and function start drawing presumably right here is where I'm gonna start generating the drawing right sketch are an end start so I need a what I'm gonna call this is the seed path it's what I'm putting into the machine learning model for it to begin to it's the seed path it's what I'm seeding the machine learning bottle with so seed path is an array and I'm gonna say I'm gonna have a very variable called person drawing which is false and as soon as I soon as start drawing happen person drawing will go to true because in draw I'm gonna say if person drawing I want to collect those states so what are the states the stroke path is an object which has a DX a DUI and a Penn State well the pen is always going to be down again I could do something more sophisticated or I could have an interaction that the you the person the user could actually draw stop pick up do different things and then have sketch RNN know how to take over but by definition the way I'm building this is when the mouse is released sketch or an in takes over so the pen is always down and DX is I can use builtin variables at p5 it stores the current mounts position minus the previous mouse position so this is actually really easy to do in p5 because I have these values already so the difference between the current mouse and the previous mouse dxdy and the pen is down then I can say seed path dot push stroke path and then when the mouse is released sketch iron and start person drawing is false let's give this a try ok big problem I don't see what I'm drawing that would be nice but it drew a cat as soon as I release the mouse so I need to add something in draw which does the following hmm I guess I just want to draw I don't want to do exactly what I did here so let's universally let's set stroke zero stroke wait for and let's just take this line function put it here and I want to draw X Y X plus drogue path and then I want to say the same thing I want to do this so again there might be a way to consolidate this code and but there it is so this now at least I should see what I'm drawing whoa okay that's weird oh boy try this again what just happened there oh oh it's drawing everything relative to the mouse relative to the center that's not good aha so the first point that I'm drawing is actually okay so x and y don't get initialized in the center of course of course of course x and y get initialized when I start drawing wherever the mouse is all right that should fix this problem here's my cat now continue drawing like cat weird wait I drew the circle I drew the cat's face already try this again so it's picking up where I left off but it seems to be starting the drawing over why because I never told the model to sketch our name model about my seed strokes in the first place right I still just call sketch RNN dot generate that first time but guess what the generate function can take as a additional optional argument an array of states that are fed into the model and I have those already in seed path is that what I called it so now drum roll please I believe this is the last detail plenty more I want to say and a couple more things I want to do but this is the last sort of detail it didn't really come out like a nice cats try this one more time that was good but there's a bad got lucky so it sort of worked it sort of didn't work there is an issue there is something really important that I need to implement and actually it's my intention for this to actually become a feature of ml5 and it's going to handle it for you automatically but that hasn't been implemented yet in ml5 so in this video I'm gonna try it out and then maybe in a future video log do a video about adding this is a feature to ml5 and it has to do with the rdp line simplification algorithm which guess what if you look at the previous coding challenge what a coincidence it is the rdp line duplication algorithm so why does this matter let's go back to the example let's go back to this example here and I'm gonna do something pay close attention I'm gonna hit clear I'm gonna zoom way in close and I'm gonna draw very very slowly a lot of squiggly lines like this really really slowly now watch what happens when I lift up the mouse ready one two three do you see how the drawing changed the sum it's very subtle but some of the points that I was drawing were removed the the fidelity of the line was lowered even though it's capturing I'm capturing the mouse positions in my sketch at presumably 60 frames per second I'm capturing a lot of points so I'm giving the machine learning model the sketch RNN model all of these states were the DX and dy values are really really tiny but it wasn't actually trained with data with the data the drawings are stored in the quickdraw data set aren't necessarily I'm what am I trying to say the model wasn't actually trained with drawings that have a super high fidelity to them with lots and lots of points close together I'm actually could not sure whether if that's in the quickdraw dataset or whether that was like a processing of the data but one of the researchers at Google wrote a github issue on the ml5 repository explaining actually no that wasn't a github issue I filed the issue based on an email I was in touch with David ha who explained that so I want to say yeah I was in touch with David hah who explained that the RDP algorithm was used to simplify the drawings when the model was trained and so when you're feeding stuff into it you want to have those drawings retain that quality so let's move back over here let's find my code and give me a second here everybody I think it might actually be not in did I put it in coding train let's see because I didn't create the web page for it yeah so I'm behind on a lot of things interactive drawing no there isn't I think I for whatever silly reason I put it here under a different P 5 web editor account hope there's an extra character here oh I don't have a slack channel open and I see all these notifications help camera help guide for setting auto temperature off Thank You CJ where is it I made I'm gonna have to go to my class did I just call it no let me go to github.com give me a second here by the way if you're wondering what I'm looking at I'm finding the repo for the course that I'm teaching at NYU I encourage you to check out all the materials if you're interested but I'm looking for here I'm looking for the p5 RDP example oh it was encoding train and it's called coordinated bagel that's why I didn't see it coding challenge I forget what number was 151 or to just say RDP okay here is the code for the last coding challenge was the rdp line simplification algorithm and I'm just simplifying a sort of mathematical curve just to recreate the animation that's on the Wikipedia page for the rdp algorithm but I should be able to take these functions I realized there's going to be something tricky about this Oh more complicated than I think because this is but I can I can do this I can do this I'm going to create another file called RT PJs I'm going to reference it here in index.html and I'm just want to see right okay I'm gonna grab my implementation of the RDP algorithm which includes all four of these functions you can watch the other video to see me write those functions I'm gonna paste them all here and what I wanna call is just RDP so I give the RDP function an array of all a whole bunch of points then I also give it an empty array that it's going to fill with the RDP reduced points and it requires a global variable hmm the way I created the example was with a global variable called epsilon so I'm just gonna sort of hard code in a value for that at ten right here and then now right before I generate the seed path I need to I need to perform RDP line simplification so interestingly enough the RDP algorithm doesn't know anything about sketch or Hanan and dxdy and Penn State so actually what I want to do is I want to have another another array called seed points and those are what I actually want to collect well I mean I mean it's kind of over complicated it's okay I've got to figure this out I want to collect it's so hot in here yeah I'm almost 84 degrees it's a sauna it's like very hard to think when it's this hot I'm going to comment this out this is going to become important again but I'm going to say seed points push create vector Mouse X Mouse why and then I want to draw I'm just curious here they think I'm really thinking this through here and then the line that I want to draw is actually just mouse X Mouse Y P Mouse X P Mouse Y so let's try this this so the drawing still works weirdly what happens with the first ones thing weird is happening with the first one no it's normal okay that's just if I if I do this and then no okay sorry so the drawing works still that was interesting and then I get the cat there's no seed points so this is weird extra cat happened all right I got it now now I'm going to create an empty array of RDP points I'm gonna call the RDP function with start index and index all points are DP points again I might want to rethink how that function was created but it is oh you know what I can do now what I want to do is perform the RDP line simplification so I can actually go back to my previous example once again and I can sorry everybody this is what I'm looking for what I want to do is perform the RDP line simplification now so I can go back to my previous example once again and basically find exactly this code so I'm going to grab this code and I'm going to put it here and what this is doing is it's creating a new empty array and it's calling the rdp function on the all points array which is now called seed points and filling it with the simplified version of the line and then what I need to do after that is now I have this RDP point which is the simplified version of the line I want to say for let a equal zero I is less than RDP points I'm going to actually start at one RDP points dot length I plus plus and I need to create the state now so remember where was I doing that before right here this is exactly what I want to do I want to create the stroke path which is RDP points index I I dot X the previous one I one do the same thing for y and then the pen is down then I can I could redraw I'm not gonna redraw anything just for a second and then I want to put that into the stroke path and then call generate alright that was a little I'm manic here which I guess all my coding challenges are pretty manic but what just happened again the idea ultimately is for ml5 to handle this I think that's what I would like to do I would like to create a helper function ml5 that sketch Arnon takes your seed path in and like performs the line simplification for you but this is my coding challenge to implement it manually to see if it helps so what i'm doing here is i have the set of points that i've collected in seed points I call the RDP algorithm which simplifies that path previous coding challenge goes through that in more detail then I have to generate the States based off the simplified path and then that's what I put into the sketch RNN model not feeling superconfident here but let's give this a try it looks the same but I think if if I'm correct if I did this many many times I would have better results coordinated bagel there's something else really important here 1140 ok I think however it's very important that I create that same visual effect where I redraw the simplified line and that's actually a pretty easy thing for me to do right here because what I can do is in sketch are an end start after I do the line simplification I can redraw the background and then I could say begin shape like I should have been in shape and I'm going to say for let V of seed path I'm just getting all the vectors out of the seed path of vertex V X V dot Y and I'm gonna say no fill I should have I've already been drawing so but just to be consistent let me take this here is that let me take this here and put that here so now I draw and drawing and drawing erasing it and then drawing the simplified line let's see how that goes mmm I didn't see it what did I do wrong here oh no not the seed path seed points and I should be doing this before technically speaking it doesn't really matter but this is what I want to do here so this is performing the line simplification drawing an line isn't really right but simplify path path simplification and then now converting converting to sketch are and end States all right let's try this one more time did you do that simplify who it's hard to see let's try like a a much higher epsilon like 100 yeah oh yeah it did it's just not super obvious but a hundred is crazy just to prove the point let me prove the point hey let me do this hmm I'm not sure that this is actually like doing what I think it's gonna do let me do some debugging here whoops Oh No RDP points people RDP points RDP points simplified line is in RDP points not even the seed points the sea points was everything I collected the simplified one is called RDP points my I should use better naming now I think let me go back and change the epsilon back to ten something more reasonable and we're gonna try this one more time I draw it slowly so that there's a lot of extra points I'm gonna make a like weird curve here here we go one two three there we go so that looked like it really simplified it like way too much so I this would be an interesting thing to tune because I want this to be in this will be like sort of the hardcoded value probably an ml five although maybe it's a parameter that you the the user of ml five could adjust but this is what I would want to sort of play with to figure out what makes the most sense but now I can really see the line simplification happening you know what it should actually be I have no idea whoops it's back to five so before I go so as always with any of these coding challenges I'm doing just a really sort of basic version I think that I have mostly successfully recreated exactly this but one of the things you'll notice is that there's a lot more thoughtfulness to the interface and the design first of all it's drawing over and over again what what sketch RNN is drawing is a different color there's a nice interface for picking which model you want to load you can kind of like randomize stuff and clear it and there's a page of information all about how this works so maybe you want to create your own version and think about what is that interaction design how are you visualizing what the person is drawing versus what the model is drawing and how are you picking which model to draw maybe you can make this into a game an art project something that is just tells a story that draws based on you know words that needle texttospeech or speech to text or something that there's so many ideas that I think you had explore so I hope you make one of those ideas and share it with me by going to the coding trade calm and follow the instructions about how to share your community contribution but I will before I go just kind of give you a nice compilation I think one of the things that I want to return to is all the different pretrained models that are available now you I could also train your own model it should be a really interesting thing to try very high degree of difficulty there but possible but the reason why I'm assuming there are models in here that are in addition to frog there's frog sofa is because the Frog model was trained with only drawings of frogs the Frog the sofa models train was wrongs of sofa the Frog sofa model was wrongs of both without a distinction between the two so the AI the machine learning model is just learning about paths that happen when you're drawing frogs and sofas and so we could try crab rabbit face Pig but I'm just gonna enjoy myself and try the everything model and I'll see you in the next coding challenge oh it doesn't go over and over again how do i oh wait a second I wanted to do it again and again so let's at least add that here as well so if this state is end hold on everybody instead of saying no loop what I want to do is actually call sketch RN n dot reset which will reset the model and then call sketch Arnon start again is that what the function was called and so if I reset the model call start again it's going to draw a new version No maybe maybe not hey why did that break so let's say the model is reset it performs RDP again draw to draw it again like this is fine the C points haven't changed and then it should create oh the seed path here's the mistake when I'm resetting everything I don't need to do all this again but I might as well so I could refactor this but at a minimum what I need to do is actually I don't need to do any of this coz seed path is a global variable so but I'm just gonna do this I'm I'm just gonna reset C path so yes I need to refactor this but I don't want to add all the seed points in the seed path again so let's try this what will the model draw enjoy no it's not working still what did I miss look at the chat next pen next pen oh this so this return is a problem current stroke also should be set to null I think oh and next pen should be set to down so I think I need next pen to not be end anymore and a current stroke to know this is really gonna work please work what did I forget to reset so many things I guess like a deep I should do some more person drawing is false current stroke is null all right let's do some reset the seed path RDP points is reset mmm i'll Stinney to reset doing things in weird places which concerns me all right I'm gonna need to let's put this console.log back in oh wait let's also put that in Oh Oh x & y x & y x and y i didn't think about x and y and it's definitely a thing so when you start the drawing X is that Mouse X Mouse y know but that's fine yay and then oh wait a second ooh this is some this is the problem that's weird I actually never move I think this was wrong all in the first place because this needs to be in there I need to move X Y and then I need to also reset X Y or actually would make sense is for X equal our DP points the last one right X&Y needs to just be wherever this leaves off the last one I think this is the last thing I forgot to reset which I didn't even set for the first time XY needs to like pick off where we left off I think all right here we go I'm just gonna draw a line the monsters are coming to get you the sketch RNN monsters okay thanks everybody goodbye enjoy these drawings you know what no no I can't live with this I'm gonna leave you with rainbows and I'm gonna take out the console.log all right everybody rainbows and rainbows is rainbow not one of the models it's one of the sky quick great it quick draw no it's not one of the models were like unicorn no there's no unicorn model I guess we have to just go with cats let's do cat pigs or elephant pigs cat pigs let's do cat pigs cat pigs are fun I will leave you with wrong sketch I will leave you with cat pigs let's get this I know which one is the one I want Oh I know what I'm doing anymore and now I will leave you with the cat pigs refresh this again and I will say goodbye to you by letting you watch a compilation of sketch RNN drawn cat pigs mmm this is way too much fun oh there's a cat Pig all right so this livestream is now over officially as of 20 minutes ago I did somehow make it through all of this the fan is definitely the solution I'm taking a picture of the thermostat so I can send it to the building let me see what makes them how do i how do I do this let's take a picture it's eighty four point six degrees in this room right now okay thank you everybody I wish that I had more time to look at some community contributions to play noisy food check out noisy food aya ho maybe I can answer a couple questions from the chat Simon is suggesting Catbus Simon's also remind me that last coding challenges out yet it is prepared so I will be releasing that as an unlisted member only video I mean it's all in the live stream but the edited version of it later today and then as soon as the closed captioning is completed then it will go public on YouTube the second coding in the Cabana video with the Collatz conjecture should come out sometime within the next few weeks a lot and I'll be back actually up something semi special plan for next Friday I do need to take a week off not a week off from making content but a week off from public life streaming because I have a video that I'm planning which is relates to training your own machine learning model that's a collaboration with project that's not a Tony in beta so I'm gonna record that at some point so if you're wondering if your I will do that as a member only live stream the recording session of that so but I do want to do a live stream I definitely only do a live stream next Friday it's probably gonna be might be and probably gonna be in the afternoon timeslot I think I'm gonna be doing it later in the day next Friday so if you're looking for when next Friday is gonna be it's probably gonna be that I don't know what just happened let's try to beat my noisy foo high score one more time oh you don't have a sound it's very important that you have the sound buhbuhbuhbuhbuh really terrible at this then I did a I can't even get one did it when will you post a processing challenge the RDP challenge is actually what's done in processing so that will be posted soon and actually the coal lots conjecture Cabana video I did with processing as well and Redfoo is there in the chat all right since redfish here in the chat we're gonna even though I have a meeting that starts in two minutes the good news is the meeting is within two minutes walk from where I am four point six degrees in here III have a you know here we go ready here we go I'm gonna get to three my goal is to get to three back is broken that is really my back is broken or I'd like to see say yeah ba ba baba baba bagawk that's French for it's just that there's gotta be some way of like regulating I've got to go somebody Supply thing outside don't don't don't encourage me all right hear me in the hallway so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with Perley noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven six well this is like Berlin noise performance apart like royalty noise performance apart with curly noise I might pick numbers like this pearly noise that it's early noise so this is hurling noise that is Hurley no this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley no so this is hurtling noise that is hurtling to her Perlin noise that it's Hurley more this is hurtling noise that it's Hurley know this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley so this is Hurley noise that is hurlyburly mrs. Hurley know that that is her early permanent improvement over that is earlier to Kerley knows that is earlier than is but with pearly noise I might pick numbers like this three four three four five six five this is like Perlin noise performance part
