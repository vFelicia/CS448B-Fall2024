00:00 - [BELL RINGS]
00:01 - Hello, and welcome
to another Beginner's
00:03 - Guide to Machine Learning
with ml5js video.
00:05 - Now in this video, I am going
to unlock something for you.
00:09 - It's already unlocked
for you, but I'm
00:11 - going to show it to you, that
is incredibly powerful for what
00:13 - you could do now
with ml5 that you
00:15 - couldn't do before
but many of you
00:16 - asked about in the comments.
00:17 - And what is that?
00:18 - It is the Save/Load
feature extractor.
00:22 - This is a new feature
that was added
00:24 - to ml5 just five days ago.
00:27 - You need to make sure that
you are using ml5 0.1.3,
00:32 - or whatever number in
the future past that.
00:35 - But certainly, this is
the version of the library
00:37 - that I'm using in this video.
00:39 - Now what does it do?
00:40 - So the last example,
if you've been
00:42 - watching these video series
in order, was this example.
00:46 - What this example
does is it loads
00:48 - a pre-trained image
classification
00:50 - model called MobileNet.
00:52 - And MobileNet is trained on
1,000 different kinds of things
00:55 - and recognizes puppies
and dogs and birds
00:57 - and different kinds of objects.
00:58 - Transfer learning is
the process by which
01:01 - we take that pre-trained
MobileNet model
01:04 - and basically disconnect
it from all those labels
01:06 - and reconnect it
to our own labels.
01:08 - For example, I'm going to
make up a label called Happy
01:10 - and a label called Sad.
01:12 - I could certainly have
more than just two.
01:14 - And I'm going to show it
things like the train whistle
01:17 - is me being happy.
01:24 - I'm going to show it that
train whistle a bunch of times.
01:26 - Say, happy, happy,
happy, happy, happy.
01:28 - Now no train
whistle is very sad.
01:31 - I'm sad.
01:31 - No train whistle is sad.
01:33 - I'm spending way too
much time on this,
01:35 - because I haven't
implemented the thing
01:36 - that I want to implement.
01:37 - Now I'm going to say train.
01:38 - And it's going to train.
01:39 - And then once it's done, happy.
01:46 - Sad.
01:47 - Happy train whistle.
01:49 - Sad.
01:49 - OK, so it works.
01:51 - It is now learning to
classify images in real time
01:53 - according to those
two categories.
01:55 - But I'm a very big spaz.
01:58 - And I'm going to just
be over hitting Refresh.
02:00 - And I have now
lost that forever.
02:02 - I no longer have that model.
02:04 - It's gone.
02:05 - The new feature is ability to
save that custom trained model
02:10 - and then reload it.
02:11 - So if you're using this
for an installation,
02:14 - and you're going to
take down the computer
02:16 - and set it up every day,
you can save that model.
02:18 - You can imagine, there's
lots of possibilities here.
02:20 - So there's only two
things that I really
02:22 - need to add to the code.
02:23 - There's a save function
and a load function.
02:25 - There's a bunch of pieces there.
02:26 - But that's what I'm
going to do right now.
02:28 - So I'm going to go
here into the code.
02:30 - And I'm going to just
add another button.
02:33 - I have a Happy button, a Sad
button, and a Train button.
02:37 - I'm going to add a Sad button.
02:39 - No, not a sad.
02:40 - A Save button.
02:42 - I'm going to call it Save.
02:44 - And Save button, when
the mouse is pressed--
02:46 - I'm just going to
say classifier.save.
02:48 - That's it.
02:49 - All I have to do is
say classifier.save.
02:53 - Let's see what happens.
02:54 - So I'm not going
to train it very--
02:57 - actually, no.
02:58 - I am going to train it.
02:59 - Let's do a really good,
solid training this time.
03:01 - Because this is the one
we're going to save.
03:02 - Plus, it works.
03:04 - So let's do the same thing.
03:05 - Happy, happy, happy, happy.
03:08 - Train whistle is a happy thing.
03:10 - A happy, happy, happy, thing.
03:12 - Just me is very sad.
03:14 - There's no train whistle.
03:15 - I'm so sad.
03:16 - I'm very sad.
03:16 - I'm very sad.
03:17 - And now I'm going to train this.
03:20 - Weird how the loss is 0.
03:22 - I'm just going to not
worry about that too much.
03:24 - I'm going to hit Save.
03:27 - You can see that,
down here, by the way,
03:29 - that I did this a couple
of times practicing.
03:31 - Now what it did is it downloaded
to my download directory
03:37 - two files model.json
and model.weights.bin.
03:42 - So those files will end up
wherever the default downloads
03:45 - directory of your browser is.
03:47 - And the next step is just
to load those files in.
03:49 - But before we load them,
let's talk about what's
03:51 - in those files.
03:53 - So those two files, I said
model.json, model.weights.bin.
04:02 - So what is a neural network?
04:05 - What is a machine
learning model?
04:06 - What is the thing
that we're saving?
04:07 - Well, in this
case, it's actually
04:09 - saving the configuration
of a neural network.
04:12 - Now if you want to know
what a neural network is,
04:14 - I have some videos about that.
04:16 - But I would refer you to the
Three Blue One Brown video,
04:20 - What is a Neural Network?
04:21 - I will link to that in
this video's description.
04:23 - That will give you a much bigger
deep dive into those details.
04:27 - But if you look at that
video, what you'll see
04:29 - is there's basically
a big diagram.
04:31 - And the diagram has
a bunch of inputs.
04:34 - It has some outputs.
04:36 - By the way, in this
case, we could actually
04:38 - say the outputs are just two.
04:40 - A happy and a sad.
04:43 - And what the neural network,
what the machine learning model
04:46 - outputs, is a probability.
04:47 - Maybe 80% of it being happy,
of that image being happy,
04:53 - and 20% that image is sad.
04:56 - So the whole point of this
is to feed in an image.
04:59 - It's the image, and maybe
all the pixels of the image,
05:03 - that are actually these inputs.
05:05 - It goes through this magic
neural network thing,
05:07 - which isn't really magic.
05:08 - It's a thing that
you can learn about.
05:10 - And then out the other
end comes a guess
05:12 - as to whether it's happy or sad.
05:14 - Now what is all this
stuff in the middle?
05:16 - The stuff in the middle
is typically referred
05:18 - to-- and there many different
styles and flavors and kinds
05:21 - of neural network--
05:22 - but in the zoomed-out
view, in general terms,
05:25 - is what's known as a hidden
layer or hidden layers.
05:28 - So every input is connected to
the output but not directly.
05:33 - There are some amount of nodes,
maybe two hidden layers, each
05:37 - with four nodes.
05:38 - And every input is
connected to every node.
05:42 - And then every node is
connected to every node.
05:44 - And then every node is
connected every output,
05:46 - and so on and so forth.
05:47 - So I could be here all day
trying to do this diagram
05:49 - and draw every connection
between everything.
05:51 - I'm not going to do that.
05:53 - But all of the
information about here
05:56 - is what is saved
in these two files.
05:59 - Model.json is a file that just
explains all of these pieces.
06:03 - The layers, the outputs, the
inputs, all of that stuff.
06:07 - That is what is in model.json.
06:10 - In a moment, I will just open
up that file and look at it.
06:12 - Model.weights is an
interesting thing.
06:14 - So the magic of
a neural network,
06:16 - what makes a neural
network work,
06:18 - is a number that's associated
with every single one
06:20 - of these connections
known as a weight.
06:22 - You can think of it as
a whole bunch of dials.
06:25 - So I'm tuning the
dials, or I'm trying
06:26 - to get the dials in
the right position
06:28 - so that it really makes good
guesses about happy versus sad.
06:31 - That's the training process.
06:32 - Once that training
process is done,
06:34 - I want to save where
all those dials are.
06:36 - All of those numbers
are in this file.
06:38 - This is a binary format
file, because there's
06:40 - a lot of numbers.
06:41 - Millions upon millions
of connections,
06:43 - potentially, between a lot of
pixels and a lot of labels,
06:45 - and a lot of hidden layers.
06:46 - So this, you'll notice
the file that we
06:48 - saved is five megabytes.
06:50 - Because it's tons
and tons of numbers.
06:52 - But this is just
a very small file
06:54 - with a little bit of text
information about how
06:56 - this is configured.
06:57 - I spent a lot of time on that.
06:58 - Hopefully, that's some
helpful background to you.
07:00 - Let's go back and actually
look at those files.
07:03 - So now I've got those files.
07:04 - What I'm going to
do is, I'm just
07:06 - going to drag them into Visual
Studio Code, which is what I'm
07:09 - using to code this right now.
07:11 - But you could be
using any environment.
07:14 - They didn't make it
into the right place.
07:16 - Let me try that again.
07:17 - I'll clean this up later.
07:18 - But I want them
in this directory.
07:19 - So you can see
that they're there.
07:21 - Model.json, model.weights.bin.
07:23 - If I click on
this, you can start
07:26 - to see all the stuff in it.
07:28 - There's information
about the input shape.
07:30 - And is it a sequential model?
07:33 - And what kind of
algorithm is it using?
07:34 - And is it dense?
07:36 - And it uses something
called softmax.
07:37 - All this stuff.
07:38 - So this is way beyond
the scope of what
07:40 - I'm doing in these videos.
07:41 - But if you're interested in
more about these details,
07:44 - you could look at
some of my videos
07:45 - that use TensorFlow.js natively
to understand more pieces here.
07:49 - But you can see
here, this is where--
07:51 - looking for the weights
file, et cetera.
07:53 - And this is really important.
07:55 - This is really just
what TensorFlow.js
07:58 - would do natively.
08:00 - But ml5 is helping with
a little bit on top of it
08:03 - by adding these
happy and sad labels.
08:06 - So now all we have to do
is load the model now.
08:10 - So we're going to go--
we saved that model.
08:12 - And so the steps are--
08:14 - the first thing we have to do
is load the MobileNet model.
08:17 - So we're not actually saving
that original pre-trained image
08:20 - classifier.
08:21 - We're just saving the bits and
pieces that are hooked into it.
08:25 - So we can't hook into it
until MobileNet is ready.
08:28 - So once MobileNet is
ready, we can then
08:32 - say, classifier.load model.json.
08:37 - Now there are two
files, model.json
08:40 - and model.weights.bin.
08:42 - But ml5 is set up that, if
you just give it one file,
08:46 - it'll look automatically for the
other file in the same place.
08:49 - There are ways of customizing
the file names and their paths
08:52 - and all of that,
but that, you can
08:54 - look into in the documentation.
08:55 - But the easiest thing
for just to do this.
08:57 - And then I'm going to
say, custom model ready.
09:00 - So I'm going to write
another event function.
09:04 - CustomModelReady.
09:06 - And there, I'm going to
say, custom model is ready.
09:11 - So it's a two-step process.
09:12 - We have to load MobileNet.
09:14 - MobileNet is ready.
09:15 - Then load model.json
with the weights.
09:18 - Custom model is ready.
09:20 - Let's just run this.
09:23 - Zoom back out.
09:25 - And there we go.
09:27 - Everything's loaded.
09:27 - But I don't see any results.
09:29 - I don't see any results.
09:30 - Why?
09:31 - Well, this sketch was written
originally with code to train.
09:36 - So I'm such a press the
buttons in that train.
09:38 - But now I don't need to train,
because I loaded the model.
09:40 - So this is where I don't
know what you should do next.
09:44 - Maybe you want to
keep two separate web
09:46 - pages, two separate
sketches, one for training
09:48 - and one for loading.
09:49 - Maybe you do it all in one.
09:51 - You'll actually see, if
you go to the ml5 examples,
09:53 - there's one that has a button
that you can drag and drop.
09:56 - You can actually select files
and load them and save them,
09:59 - all in the same sketch.
10:00 - But what I want to do now is
basically a workflow for--
10:03 - I'm done with the training.
10:04 - So I'm not going to
ever train again.
10:06 - So I can actually remove
all of these buttons.
10:09 - They're no longer
relevant to me.
10:12 - The text that should
show up at the beginning
10:15 - is just loading model.
10:18 - And then, when the model
is ready, I would say,
10:25 - label equals model ready.
10:29 - So let's run this now.
10:31 - So now loading model,
loading model, model ready.
10:34 - And now, once the model is
ready, all you need to do
10:36 - is start classifying.
10:37 - And before, I didn't
classify until the training
10:41 - was finished.
10:42 - The training is now irrelevant.
10:44 - I could actually completely
comment this out as well.
10:48 - And basically, I want
to start training
10:50 - when the model is ready.
10:51 - Not training, sorry.
10:52 - I want to start guessing when
the model is ready by saying,
10:55 - classifier.classify.
10:56 - Got results, and now here we go.
11:00 - Loading the model.
11:01 - The model is ready.
11:02 - Happy.
11:04 - Sad.
11:06 - Happy.
11:07 - Sad.
11:08 - And I can refresh
the page again.
11:11 - And happy.
11:15 - Sad.
11:16 - Happy.
11:17 - Sad.
11:18 - So it works.
11:19 - We're done.
11:19 - Yay.
11:20 - This is a thing you can do now.
11:22 - You can train your own
transfer learning model.
11:24 - You could do this with
the regression example,
11:25 - too, if you watched that video.
11:27 - You can save it.
11:27 - So I don't know.
11:29 - You could share models.
11:30 - Let's all share models
with each other.
11:32 - Share your model with me.
11:34 - Let's see what happens.
11:35 - I'm curious to see what
kind of creative stuff
11:37 - you come up with.
11:39 - The interaction that I've
done here is super awkward.
11:41 - I'm going to press the
button all the time.
11:42 - And you don't actually have
to train with just video.
11:45 - You could load a
bunch of images.
11:46 - So there's so many
possibilities here.
11:48 - And I look forward to
seeing what you make.
11:50 - And stay tuned for
more ml5 videos.
11:53 - More stuff is coming.
11:54 - I don't know yet what.
11:55 - But more stuff is coming.
11:56 - Goodbye.

[BELL RINGS] Hello, and welcome to another Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning with ml5js video. Now in this video, I am going to unlock something for you.

But if you're interested in more about these details, you could look at some of my videos that use TensorFlow.js natively to understand more pieces here. But you can see here, this is where looking for the weights file, et cetera. And this is really important. This is really just what TensorFlow.js would do natively. But ml5 is helping with a little bit on top of it by adding these happy and sad labels. So now all we have to do is load the model now. So we're going to go we saved that model. And so the steps are the first thing we have to do is load the MobileNet model. So we're not actually saving that original pretrained image classifier. We're just saving the bits and pieces that are hooked into it. So we can't hook into it until MobileNet is ready. So once MobileNet is ready, we can then say, classifier.load model.json. Now there are two files, model.json and model.weights.bin. But ml5 is set up that, if you just give it one file, it'll look automatically for the other file in the same place. There are ways of customizing the file names and their paths and all of that, but that, you can look into in the documentation. But the easiest thing for just to do this. And then I'm going to say, custom model ready. So I'm going to write another event function. CustomModelReady. And there, I'm going to say, custom model is ready. So it's a twostep process. We have to load MobileNet. MobileNet is ready. Then load model.json with the weights. Custom model is ready. Let's just run this. Zoom back out. And there we go. Everything's loaded. But I don't see any results. I don't see any results. Why? Well, this sketch was written originally with code to train. So I'm such a press the buttons in that train. But now I don't need to train, because I loaded the model. So this is where I don't know what you should do next. Maybe you want to keep two separate web pages, two separate sketches, one for training and one for loading. Maybe you do it all in one. You'll actually see, if you go to the ml5 examples, there's one that has a button that you can drag and drop. You can actually select files and load them and save them, all in the same sketch. But what I want to do now is basically a workflow for I'm done with the training. So I'm not going to ever train again. So I can actually remove all of these buttons. They're no longer relevant to me. The text that should show up at the beginning is just loading model. And then, when the model is ready, I would say, label equals model ready. So let's run this now. So now loading model, loading model, model ready. And now, once the model is ready, all you need to do is start classifying. And before, I didn't classify until the training was finished. The training is now irrelevant. I could actually completely comment this out as well. And basically, I want to start training when the model is ready. Not training, sorry. I want to start guessing when the model is ready by saying, classifier.classify. Got results, and now here we go. Loading the model. The model is ready. Happy. Sad. Happy. Sad. And I can refresh the page again. And happy. Sad. Happy. Sad. So it works. We're done. Yay. This is a thing you can do now. You can train your own transfer learning model. You could do this with the regression example, too, if you watched that video. You can save it. So I don't know. You could share models. Let's all share models with each other. Share your model with me. Let's see what happens. I'm curious to see what kind of creative stuff you come up with. The interaction that I've done here is super awkward. I'm going to press the button all the time. And you don't actually have to train with just video. You could load a bunch of images. So there's so many possibilities here. And I look forward to seeing what you make. And stay tuned for more ml5 videos. More stuff is coming. I don't know yet what. But more stuff is coming. Goodbye. [BELL RINGS] [MUSIC PLAYING]
