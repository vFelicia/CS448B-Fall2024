05:08 - hi everyone if you heard a strange echo
05:11 - it's because i had the live stream open
05:13 - on my computer

05:18 - and into my computer and then out to you
05:19 - again so apologize i have fixed that
05:22 - and we are starting in about 45 seconds
05:37 - [Music]
06:10 - hello everyone good morning happy
06:13 - saturday welcome to the coding train
06:15 - it's me
06:15 - dan oh we're on the internet together um
06:18 - i'm so excited today oh i have an extra
06:20 - light that i need to turn on i forgot to
06:22 - turn this light on do i look better now
06:23 - this side of my face looks more uh um
06:27 - like it's supposed to i don't know what
06:29 - to say i'm so excited for today
06:31 - this is a special saturday live stream i
06:34 - have a guest
06:35 - um that i'm uh i'm super excited to
06:38 - share her work with you and have her
06:41 - teach me something or show me how to do
06:43 - something which i have never done before
06:45 - and actually let me just briefly get
06:47 - started by
06:48 - um saying and here's our guest up on the
06:50 - screen you see uh chrissy brimmage and
06:51 - this is a
06:52 - an image of her work but what i want to
06:55 - uh
06:55 - quickly tell you and say is i for the
06:57 - first time ever
06:59 - in my life installed something called
07:01 - blender
07:02 - on this very laptop this morning and you
07:04 - can see right up here on the
07:05 - on the top right of my screen there it
07:06 - is i just installed it because i'm going
07:08 - to try to follow along and
07:10 - you know or at least look at blender
07:12 - again a little bit later today
07:14 - so um if you want to get a head start
07:17 - and try to follow along with the
07:18 - tutorial stuff that we're going to do
07:20 - in about 15 minutes or so um download
07:23 - blender and there's a link to where you
07:24 - can download blender
07:26 - in the video description let me make
07:27 - sure it's there so i'm pulling that up
07:29 - now
07:30 - and you can see ah there it is so um
07:32 - first of all uh here's uh chrissy's
07:34 - website
07:34 - her instagram so check those out i'm
07:37 - gonna talk uh a bit more about chrissy
07:38 - and introduce her work and show you a
07:40 - reel of her work in a moment
07:42 - um as well as the link to download
07:44 - blender
07:45 - and oh this is really important because
07:48 - the example
07:49 - um that we're going to work with today
07:51 - is making your very own
07:53 - mew i don't know if chrissy actually
07:55 - knew this but i'm kind of uh
07:57 - uh you know i mean i'm out in the open
08:00 - about my love for pokemon
08:01 - so uh but uh there's a lot of pokemon
08:04 - going on in this household in fact i've
08:06 - got some
08:06 - a lot of toys and characters and things
08:09 - and plushies around that i could bring
08:11 - but
08:11 - i'll i'll save that for later but you
08:13 - can get this mew reference image
08:15 - and also
08:19 - make sure you download and install
08:20 - blender which is not required you can
08:21 - just watch and enjoy
08:23 - and participate but i encourage you to
08:26 - download
08:27 - uh blender okay um
08:30 - alexander asks will this be a tutorial
08:32 - on the software or
08:34 - is there going to be a coding aspect so
08:36 - today is not really the day that i'm
08:37 - that we're going to look uh
08:39 - at coding it's really like a basic
08:40 - introduction to blender and i think one
08:42 - of the things that's exciting about it
08:44 - is
08:44 - just about everything that i do is very
08:46 - 2d graphics oriented
08:48 - in p5 or processing so this is really
08:50 - also a bit of an introduction to sort of
08:52 - thinking in terms of 3d and you know my
08:55 - hope is that
08:56 - if i can learn a little bit from chrissy
08:58 - about how to use blender and it might be
08:59 - something that i add to my workflow and
09:01 - one of the things that i would love to
09:02 - do if i make my own pokemon
09:04 - u in blender maybe i'll see if i can
09:06 - export it and import it to a p5.js
09:09 - sketch or a processing sketch
09:10 - that would be certainly be a fun thing
09:13 - to try i'm just
09:14 - taking a look at the chat v specky says
09:16 - i love pokemon
09:17 - so darn much alright me too
09:20 - me too v specky okay
09:24 - uh so what i want to say like so a quick
09:26 - um quick just sort of like notes and
09:28 - logistics from the coding train
09:30 - so it's the summer as you know i'm not
09:33 - at my
09:33 - um nyu workspace where i record a lot of
09:36 - video tutorials
09:37 - so things are a little bit off-kilter i
09:39 - am doing live streams from this
09:41 - uh home location that i'm in in brooklyn
09:44 - um i recently released a video on
09:46 - marching squares
09:48 - um which is an algorithm that you can
09:50 - make interesting beautiful patterns with
09:52 - um so that came out yesterday um and i
09:55 - encourage you
09:56 - um to um if you make your own creative
10:00 - version of
10:00 - marching squares you can add there's
10:02 - only one community contribution here
10:04 - right now and i do hope to have a live
10:05 - stream next week
10:06 - where i will go through and look at some
10:08 - of these community contributions and
10:10 - show them and analyze them as well as
10:13 - maybe investigate marching cubes because
10:16 - today
10:16 - not so perfect i couldn't have imagined
10:18 - this better myself
10:20 - not planned but the next thing i wanted
10:23 - to try once i did marching squares was
10:24 - marching cubes which is
10:26 - taking marching squares from 2d to 3d
10:28 - but that's the topic of today going from
10:30 - 2d to 3d
10:31 - so that's what's going on in the coding
10:32 - train these days today
10:34 - is part of my guest conductor series um
10:37 - i want to also highlight for you let's
10:40 - see if i can pull this
10:41 - up if i go to the channel um the
10:43 - previous two guest conductors
10:46 - um amigos code and if i scroll back a
10:49 - little bit further
10:50 - um oh there there there she is um aaron
10:53 - davey
10:53 - from the twitch channel cozy cozy coding
10:56 - so check out amigos code uh channel on
10:58 - youtube
10:59 - and then uh aaron um live streams very
11:02 - regularly on twitch
11:03 - um making all sorts of what she likes to
11:05 - call i think like p5.js jan sessions and
11:08 - every every example that she's made in
11:10 - p5.js that comes out of that is just so
11:12 - delightful
11:13 - and so if you're if you're looking for
11:15 - more experimental creative fun
11:17 - with code and p5.js definitely check out
11:19 - um aaron davies um cozy
11:21 - coding train oh and we got a donation
11:25 - which means when we get a donation that
11:28 - i have to thank you with
11:29 - a random number because that's the weird
11:32 - stuff that i do on the coding train
11:34 - so i'm going to take my oh let me switch
11:37 - back to this view here oops nope wrong
11:38 - view
11:39 - here we go okay so i have my book a
11:41 - million random digits thank you
11:42 - anonymous for your donation i'm going to
11:44 - talk about the tender foundation
11:45 - in just a moment and for you uh i
11:48 - you will have your random number is
11:58 - ah oh no this book's falling apart
12:00 - that's terrible but we'll use the face

12:15 - i'll introduce in a moment
12:17 - for introducing me to the tender
12:18 - foundation i was not familiar with
12:20 - tender before
12:22 - the tender foundation is a
12:24 - non-for-profit based in atlanta georgia
12:26 - it's run by jasina almand founded by her
12:30 - and it supports um mothers in need um
12:33 - you know being
12:34 - a parent i'm not a mother i am a father
12:36 - is
12:37 - a really challenging and difficult
12:38 - wonderful thing but i've been so lucky
12:40 - in my life to be able to have the
12:43 - resources
12:44 - um to not worry too much about things
12:47 - like diapers and food
12:49 - and not everyone is so lucky and the
12:51 - tender foundation is doing some amazing
12:53 - work
12:53 - um in atlanta georgia to help um mothers
12:56 - so
12:57 - i i was i could talk a little bit about
12:59 - the tender foundation um
13:01 - all the donations that you make um
13:03 - through this
13:04 - live stream go directly to the tender
13:06 - foundation youtube through their giving
13:08 - program covers all the fees
13:09 - and i'm also going to match go i set a
13:11 - goal for 500 i'm going to match
13:13 - a 500 donation um as well so
13:17 - what i want to do is play you a quick
13:19 - video message
13:20 - from jacina almond who is the founder of
13:22 - the tender foundation
13:23 - to tell you a little bit more about
13:25 - their work okay so
13:26 - give me a second here hopefully this is
13:28 - gonna come up i'm gonna oh uh
13:30 - let me actually turn off the air
13:32 - conditioning which is making a noise
13:34 - i realized and let me click over to her
13:37 - video and i'm going to mute myself
13:42 - hi um my name is jacina allman the
13:44 - founder of the tender foundation based
13:46 - in atlanta georgia first off i just want
13:49 - to say we're so grateful
13:50 - to christy and the coding train for
13:52 - allowing us this opportunity and
13:54 - supporting our work
13:55 - at tender we are committed to empowering
13:58 - all moms by making the essentials
14:00 - accessible we do this through our family
14:02 - stabilization program
14:04 - the program provides emergency financial
14:07 - assistance
14:08 - with rent utilities um
14:11 - grocery store gift cards and other
14:13 - necessities like diapers and wipes to
14:15 - our moms
14:16 - we um we do this work with like a lot of
14:20 - heart
14:20 - and a little hassle we believe our
14:22 - process is streamlined
14:24 - simple we really just stand in the gap
14:26 - and act as
14:27 - a safety net for all of the um
14:30 - the families living on the margins that
14:32 - are typically under resourced
14:34 - and so we really just like to surround
14:38 - our our moms in love and really
14:41 - destigmatize the process of
14:42 - being vulnerable enough to ask for help
14:45 - and so yeah that's
14:46 - that's what we do and again i'm super
14:49 - super grateful for this opportunity and
14:51 - i'm so excited to learn something with
14:53 - chrissy so thanks so much
15:00 - all right thank you jay cena for your
15:02 - message um thank you for
15:04 - uh sharing your work with us and all the
15:05 - work that you do i hope that

15:09 - and help support the tender foundation
15:11 - we just got a donation thank you very
15:13 - much from japs
15:14 - um and a couple people in the chat
15:16 - mention they that they can't donate
15:18 - through youtube because it's not
15:20 - available in their country
15:21 - um i will mention that of course you are
15:24 - also welcome to go

15:49 - you for it personally um
15:51 - okay so um
15:54 - i think i am ready for
15:57 - the next stage here which is to
16:00 - introduce um i actually made like a
16:03 - schedule and it says like
16:04 - oh i never do this because i'm so
16:06 - disorganized
16:08 - but it says on next on my schedule is um
16:10 - an introduction to chrissy's work and
16:11 - i'm actually five minutes ahead of
16:13 - schedule which is amazing
16:15 - so um i'm well i'm gonna pull up um
16:17 - chrissy uh bremenj's website
16:19 - um thank you oh i forgot to thank psy
16:21 - who is the um
16:22 - which i should have done right from the
16:24 - outset who's the coding train um
16:25 - community manager
16:26 - i realize i'm not in the uh video here
16:29 - um
16:31 - oh we got another donation from stein
16:34 - ovid bratomer thank you
16:35 - very much a train whistle uh for you for
16:38 - that donation
16:40 - um someone in the chat is asking me why
16:43 - don't i use donation
16:44 - alert yeah i tried to hook it up so the
16:46 - lights blink with donations but i
16:48 - couldn't get that to work so
16:50 - um maybe i can figure that out for the
16:53 - next i hope to do more fundraising so
16:55 - somebody knows how to get the youtube
16:57 - api with donations it works for all the
16:59 - other kind of transaction stuff but for
17:01 - some reason the donations aren't coming
17:02 - up but that's not what's important
17:04 - it's nice when the lights blink but alas
17:06 - we will we will enjoy ourselves
17:08 - uh and uh your donation is really um i'm
17:11 - really grateful and thank you for that
17:13 - oh but uh most importantly um i wanted
17:16 - to thank psy
17:17 - who is the coding trained community
17:18 - manager sai is the curator
17:20 - and and co-producer of the guest
17:23 - conductor series
17:24 - um i was not familiar with chrissy's
17:26 - work until psy introduced me to them
17:28 - and so um i was so thrilled and just
17:32 - like marveling at the beauty
17:34 - on of different projects on the website
17:36 - and really excited i'm always excited
17:38 - when somebody
17:39 - who's practice is different than mine
17:41 - can share
17:43 - how they how they work things that they
17:45 - have learned
17:46 - things that they want to share about how
17:48 - their practices and and kind of explore
17:51 - their creative process as a guest on the
17:53 - coding train so
17:54 - um let me play for you um uh chrissy's
17:58 - reel so you can get a sense of her the
18:00 - kind of art
18:00 - and projects that she makes with blender
18:02 - and other uh tools
18:04 - and then i will i'm gonna also just read
18:05 - from her bio on the website
18:07 - so now her reel is coming up here um
18:10 - and so um chrissy is a multi-uh
18:13 - disciplinary
18:14 - artist living and working out of
18:15 - brooklyn by way of atlanta georgia
18:18 - and her work utilizes the opportunities
18:20 - and constraints of digital space to
18:21 - research social phenomena
18:23 - of the material world she's currently
18:25 - interested in the function of identity
18:27 - dreaming of futures beyond oppressive
18:28 - systems defining freedom
18:30 - reworking ideas of justice and how to
18:33 - integrate mediums such as illustration
18:35 - code design
18:36 - animation 3d modeling and vr to
18:38 - communicate
18:39 - explore and bridge my personal
18:41 - perception her personal perceptions of
18:42 - these issues
18:43 - as well as the variations in perceptions
18:45 - between different social identities
18:47 - so one of the things that i love about
18:49 - chrissy's website and the real is
18:50 - repeating here is that um you know i
18:53 - think when you
18:54 - are working with code you can get so
18:56 - lost in the technical
18:57 - and are working with digital media um
19:00 - but sometimes you can sort of forget
19:01 - like why it is you're doing that and
19:03 - on um chrissy's website i'm gonna pull
19:05 - that up over here
19:06 - um she lists these four questions that
19:08 - she's been asking herself what world
19:10 - do i want to live in what is identity
19:13 - and how is it used
19:14 - what does freedom be on depression feel
19:16 - like can we expand our perceptions of
19:18 - the world
19:18 - through vr embodiment and so these are
19:21 - such uh wonderful questions i
19:23 - i think it's a good exercise for all of
19:24 - us i should do this myself like after
19:26 - today is to like
19:27 - take a minute write down what are the
19:29 - questions you're asking about yourself
19:31 - the world uh and the meaning behind the
19:33 - work and the things that you're creating
19:35 - um so um uh without further ado
19:38 - i think i would like to bring chrissy on
19:42 - chrissy you're still muted but why don't
19:44 - you say say hello to me so i can make
19:45 - sure i hear you
19:47 - okay i heard chrissy now i'm gonna
19:49 - unmute her now say hello to the coding
19:51 - trade audience
19:52 - hello everyone okay and then i'm going
19:55 - to switch over to
19:56 - um the screen that i have that has
20:00 - uh your video so hold on so um there
20:03 - everybody should be sorry i'm kind of
20:05 - new at this technically with having
20:06 - guests
20:07 - so apologies for all the awkwardness as
20:10 - i was trying to explain to christy i was
20:11 - like
20:12 - don't worry if everything goes wrong
20:14 - that's kind of the point of the coding
20:15 - train
20:16 - it all goes wrong and we figure it out
20:18 - together so uh hopefully you see chrissy
20:20 - right now
20:20 - hi chrissy hi um is i don't know if
20:23 - there's anything you wanted to say about
20:24 - the tender foundation you brought um
20:26 - you you shared their work with me um i
20:28 - hadn't uh heard of them before that i
20:30 - missed or that you think would be
20:31 - important to say
20:33 - um not to put you on the spot sorry
20:36 - no um i just wanted to say that i know
20:39 - i've known jacina now for a couple of
20:41 - years and just the work that she does
20:44 - with tinder but even outside of tinder i
20:47 - mean she's a really awesome person and
20:49 - the tender foundation really does do
20:51 - a lot of great work here in atlanta um
20:54 - they did a lot for the protest as well
20:56 - like they are really really
21:00 - about the mission that they have put you
21:02 - know on their website and
21:04 - you know i wanted to bring them in today
21:07 - because um because they're doing great
21:10 - work but also
21:11 - it's a non-profit that is kind of here
21:13 - in my hometown of atlanta
21:15 - and i just hope you know we find some
21:18 - time and
21:19 - space and love to donate to them and
21:22 - help some mamas
21:24 - awesome thank you so much yeah and i
21:25 - know that atlanta i mean everyone is
21:27 - going through a hard time especially in
21:28 - this country with the pandemic and i
21:30 - know that atlanta has uh
21:32 - it's an ep epicenter now these days so i
21:35 - hope that we can
21:36 - uh give a little support we went through
21:38 - this we're still going through to new
21:39 - york but you know we're lucky enough now
21:40 - in brooklyn that our numbers have come
21:42 - down a little bit and i know that
21:43 - atlanta is definitely going through a
21:44 - rough patch so hopefully we can offer
21:46 - our support
21:46 - to the city and the community and
21:48 - especially those who don't have
21:50 - access to uh resources um who have
21:53 - little babies
21:54 - um that's really like i i'm glad to be
21:57 - able to do
21:58 - our small part my small part in being
21:59 - able to help for sure
22:01 - um great so um i don't know if you
22:05 - uh how i don't know what the best way to
22:08 - get started is but
22:09 - you know if i'm gonna uh if you're ready
22:10 - i'll pull up your screen
22:12 - shall i do that now yeah okay so i'm
22:15 - gonna switch where to see i'm
22:16 - i've got a button here i'm gonna press
22:17 - we're gonna see if this works so now you
22:19 - should be seeing um chrissy's
22:21 - um screen and we can i'm just gonna kind
22:23 - of like
22:24 - turn it over to you i'm gonna launch
22:26 - blender on my laptop and try to
22:28 - follow along and i'll ask questions
22:30 - along the way if there are things that
22:31 - i'm confused about
22:32 - and i'm also keeping an eye on the chat
22:34 - as well and thank you
22:36 - to nick k um with your for your donation
22:38 - to tender or not
22:40 - uh um you know i don't want i want to
22:42 - let chrissy be able to have some flow
22:44 - here so
22:45 - i don't know that i'm gonna pause and
22:46 - stop every time somebody donates but at
22:48 - the end i'll try to say some thank yous
22:49 - again to other people who
22:50 - who donate as well um and so if you have
22:52 - questions you can ask them in the chat
22:54 - i'll try to keep track of them but we'll
22:55 - also
22:56 - um have a little bit of time towards the
22:58 - end if people want to ask um some
22:59 - questions about to chrissy about
23:01 - her work or just working with blender
23:02 - and and the like
23:05 - cool all right let's jump in
23:09 - okay so first and foremost hi everyone i
23:12 - am
23:12 - super excited to be here um
23:16 - just a little bit of background on me
23:19 - um i actually when i was learning to
23:22 - code and when i was getting my
23:23 - background
23:25 - or trying to get my bearings with
23:26 - machine learning i lived
23:28 - on the coding train okay i was on the
23:30 - coding training like every day watching
23:32 - videos so it's really cool
23:33 - to be here and to share something maybe
23:37 - new to some of you maybe not so new but
23:39 - either way i think we'll have some fun
23:41 - today um the way that i'm gonna kind of
23:44 - outline this video or the kind of
23:46 - overarching goal here is that i want to
23:48 - try
23:49 - to get everyone kind of familiar with
23:52 - moving around in 3d space so if you've
23:54 - never heard of blender never opened
23:56 - blender
23:58 - saw blender and thought smoothies like
24:00 - you have no clue what it is this is like
24:02 - the perfect
24:03 - video for here we're gonna walk through
24:05 - kind of the concepts behind
24:06 - moving from 2d to 3d then i'm going to
24:10 - show kind of like how to navigate in 3d
24:12 - space
24:13 - and then at the end we'll go ahead and
24:16 - hopefully have some time to do a demo
24:18 - of how to model that new reference so
24:20 - like dan said if you are interested
24:22 - in following along there is a link in
24:24 - the description to both
24:26 - blender and also the new reference
24:29 - okay so first and foremost just a really
24:31 - quick note about blender if you haven't
24:33 - heard of it before
24:34 - i have the description here on my screen
24:36 - it's a free and open source 3d creation
24:38 - suite
24:39 - and it supports a bunch of things from
24:42 - modeling
24:42 - rigging animation simulation just
24:45 - anything
24:46 - 3d you can probably do in blender
24:49 - and that's specifically why i picked it
24:50 - today so we're not going to do any
24:52 - coding today but it has the capability
24:54 - to link encoding so if you
24:56 - do hard coding and you want to try like
24:58 - generative code
25:00 - you can do some of that in blender if
25:02 - you've been working in 2d
25:03 - but you want to move to 3d if you've
25:05 - been doing static work you want to try
25:07 - animation
25:09 - um if you want to create some obj files
25:12 - to put into p5
25:14 - dan has a really great tutorial on that
25:15 - already so there's a lot of really great
25:17 - things that you can do in blender so
25:19 - it's a really great transition tool
25:20 - which is why i wanted to talk about it
25:21 - today because it just kind of opens the
25:23 - doors
25:24 - to new explorations new mediums
25:27 - more dreaming if there's something new
25:29 - that you want to try
25:31 - one question that just came in from the
25:33 - chat that i thought i would ask is um
25:34 - somebody asked if
25:35 - um which version of blender or does it
25:37 - matter which version they download are
25:38 - you using the latest version
25:40 - for today we're going to be talking
25:42 - about blender 2.8 um i think they just
25:44 - released like an update like 2.83 or
25:46 - something like that but
25:48 - as long as it's blender 2.8 will be good
25:50 - got it
25:52 - okay so before i even
25:57 - do anything major i just want to give a
26:00 - note that
26:00 - for the first part here um while i'm
26:03 - talking about concepts
26:04 - i'm not going to note every single thing
26:07 - that i'm doing like
26:08 - functionality but if there's anything
26:11 - that i don't know
26:12 - when it's time to model i'm going to
26:13 - completely backtrack
26:15 - open blender again from the very
26:17 - beginning and walk us through every
26:18 - single step
26:19 - so don't worry if you don't quite know
26:22 - what's happening
26:23 - movement wise or function wise in the
26:24 - beginning it will all be explained
26:26 - later okay so let's talk about
26:30 - first just kind of the concept behind
26:33 - moving from 2d to 3d or just creating 3d
26:37 - work in digital space periods
26:39 - so the biggest difference and i'm going
26:42 - to actually pull up
26:43 - an example piece um
26:46 - so again don't don't freak out when you
26:48 - see this this looks a lot more complex
26:50 - because i use this for animation blender
26:52 - doesn't always look this scary i promise
26:54 - but i'm going to use this piece as an
26:56 - example um
26:57 - so the biggest kind of difference and
26:59 - i'm going to actually
27:01 - show the reference photo as well the
27:03 - biggest difference between 2d
27:05 - and 3d work are making 2d and 3d work
27:08 - is that when you are making 2d work you
27:10 - are creating the
27:12 - illusion of 3d okay so you're doing
27:15 - things like
27:16 - using your composition using shadows
27:18 - using foreground
27:20 - background to create the illusion of a
27:23 - full picture
27:24 - because you can only draw in like one or
27:27 - maybe two i guess depending on how you
27:31 - how you outline things perspectives okay
27:33 - so
27:34 - what you're doing is you're creating
27:35 - that picture in that one dimension
27:37 - and then your brain or the audience's
27:39 - brain is doing the leg work to kind of
27:41 - imagine everything else so for example
27:43 - when we're looking at this picture here
27:45 - um you know we see it's like a person
27:48 - and when we look at the head from the
27:50 - way that i drew it i mean hopefully
27:53 - we would imagine that it's like a
27:54 - rounded head so
27:56 - we look at it and we imagine that
27:58 - there's like a back
27:59 - um hopefully we imagine that there's
28:01 - like another ear these fingers that are
28:03 - hidden we imagine them there
28:04 - because that's what we're used to seeing
28:06 - in real life so the difference when
28:08 - you're moving
28:09 - into the 3d is that these things that
28:11 - are imagined
28:12 - what our brain usually does the leg work
28:14 - for we actually have to do the legwork
28:16 - in the 3d space so i want to show kind
28:18 - of an example of what i mean
28:21 - with this piece here so this is the 3d
28:24 - version
28:25 - of the picture that you just saw that i
28:27 - did so
28:28 - what's going to happen usually or at
28:30 - least what happened to me when i first
28:32 - moved into doing 3d work is that
28:35 - i'm so used to drawing in that one
28:38 - perspective that when you move into 3d
28:40 - work there's a tendency to kind of do
28:42 - the same
28:43 - to work from the front or to work from
28:45 - the back
28:46 - so usually what will happen is you'll go
28:48 - into blender you have your model you're
28:50 - ready you're like this is great this is
28:51 - going to be good
28:52 - you go and you completely model the
28:54 - front
28:55 - and then you expect or you're used to
28:58 - your brain kind of doing the legwork
29:00 - of completing the rest but then you turn
29:02 - the model
29:03 - and it's completely flat and you're like
29:05 - oh
29:07 - okay so like in our heads we know that
29:09 - there
29:10 - is a third dimension in
29:13 - 3d space but kind of moving
29:17 - and um working with that is what's going
29:19 - to be kind of the most kind of shocking
29:22 - thing when you first move into 3d so
29:24 - with this
29:25 - model i kind of got away with it because
29:27 - i only needed the front view
29:29 - but when you're doing things like making
29:30 - characters or if you're interested in
29:32 - 3d printing things where the model has
29:36 - to be 360
29:37 - you have to keep every single dimension
29:40 - in mind
29:41 - which sounds really really intimidating
29:43 - and it sounds like a lot
29:44 - but blender has some really great kind
29:47 - of features to help with this
29:49 - so i'm going to show just a couple of
29:50 - suggestions
29:52 - i'm i'm gonna open a completely new
29:54 - project here
29:56 - okay so this is what blender usually
29:58 - looks like when you first start when you
29:59 - have a new project
30:00 - as you can see it starts to go off with
30:02 - like this cube here i'm gonna use this
30:04 - cube to do
30:05 - a kind of demonstration of ways that we
30:07 - can set up our viewport here
30:09 - and our viewport is just the screen that
30:11 - you're seeing whatever you're viewing is
30:13 - the viewport
30:14 - so the first thing that we can do
30:17 - to kind of help us when we're ready to
30:20 - make our first model
30:22 - is use a reference okay so in the same
30:24 - way that references
30:26 - are super useful in 2d they are your
30:29 - best friend
30:30 - in 3d and what's cool about blender is
30:33 - that you don't have to like
30:34 - navigate back and forth so i'm going to
30:37 - go ahead and pull up
30:38 - the mu reference
30:41 - so you know usually when you're like
30:43 - drawing something you have your drawing
30:45 - here you have your reference off to the
30:47 - side
30:47 - or maybe on your computer and you're
30:48 - going back and forth trying to make sure
30:51 - that everything's right or maybe you're
30:52 - tracing it what's cool about blender is
30:54 - that you can drop your reference
30:57 - right into the viewport okay so i can
30:59 - just take this
31:00 - i can drag it and drop it right on in
31:03 - there
31:04 - and that way when i'm modeling i can put
31:06 - my model
31:08 - right in front so i'm just going to grab
31:10 - this
31:12 - also if anyone just joined um you can
31:16 - find that reference image if you want to
31:19 - use the same reference image there's a
31:20 - link to it
31:21 - in the video's description so if you
31:23 - scroll down you'll be able to find it
31:24 - yeah and one thing i want to note about
31:28 - references
31:29 - in for 3d space so i picked this new
31:32 - reference for a reason one because it's
31:34 - absolutely adorable
31:35 - but also because it has three different
31:37 - views
31:38 - so something that might also be new
31:41 - when you're transitioning from 2d to 3d
31:43 - if you're used to drawing in one
31:45 - perspective
31:46 - when you move to 3d again you have to
31:48 - have a full kind of 360
31:50 - understanding of your piece so things
31:53 - that are usually hidden
31:54 - in 2d you have to make decisions about
31:57 - in 3d
31:58 - okay so for example if you drew a
31:59 - character that is facing backwards if
32:02 - you draw them from the back
32:03 - you know usually in 2d you don't have to
32:05 - really imagine what their face looks
32:07 - like
32:07 - but in 3d you will so when it comes time
32:10 - to choose a reference you want to try to
32:12 - look for things like this
32:13 - like this new reference so something
32:15 - that has
32:17 - at the bare minimum like a front
32:19 - reference and a side reference
32:20 - but if you can find something with you
32:23 - know a right reference
32:24 - a left top bottom as much as you can the
32:27 - more
32:28 - references that you have when you're
32:30 - doing 3d work
32:31 - the more comfortable you're going to
32:32 - feel because you don't have to imagine
32:35 - anything that's not there everything
32:37 - will be there for you so try to look for
32:38 - references like this
32:39 - if you can't find something that has all
32:42 - three of them in one
32:44 - like let's say you're i don't know you
32:46 - want to make a reference of
32:47 - you want to make like a elephant or
32:49 - something you can't find a picture of an
32:51 - elephant from three different angles
32:52 - just try to find three different
32:54 - pictures that you like that are kind of
32:55 - similar
32:56 - that you can see it from the front and
32:58 - from the side at least and then if you
32:59 - can find
33:00 - other views from the back or whatever
33:02 - other angle it's gonna help a lot
33:04 - okay so right now my reference is in
33:07 - here
33:08 - um i kind of have it at a funny angle
33:10 - though so i'm gonna actually
33:12 - delete this i'm gonna back up
33:16 - and now so i keep talking about all
33:17 - these different views
33:19 - in um blender or we talk about how you
33:23 - know you can see a piece from the front
33:24 - you can see a piece from the back
33:26 - when you first go in blender you're
33:27 - probably like i don't know where i
33:29 - am like am i am i in the front am i in
33:32 - the back i have no clue
33:34 - luckily blender has views so
33:37 - we can and i'll go through this again
33:39 - when we go to the modeling but just to
33:40 - show really quick
33:41 - if you go up here to the view tab and
33:44 - you go to viewport
33:46 - it has all of the different views that
33:48 - you can look at so you have top
33:51 - you have bottom you have front back
33:54 - right left and you can navigate these
33:56 - using your keys so
33:57 - i'm gonna do that with my keyboard so
33:59 - now i'm in the front if i press
34:01 - three now i'm in the right you can even
34:03 - jump to opposites
34:04 - using nine so that way you always know
34:06 - where you are
34:08 - and it'll show you up here in the top
34:10 - left corner if you ever feel lost and
34:12 - click a button you're like i don't know
34:13 - where i am anymore blender will always
34:15 - show you in the top left here
34:17 - okay so now that i'm in the front view
34:20 - i'm going to go ahead and drag this new
34:21 - reference back in here
34:25 - okay and so usually what i do is
34:30 - once i put my reference in i move
34:32 - whatever like base that i'm going to use
34:35 - to model in front
34:36 - so i'm just going to do that really
34:37 - quick i'm just going to scale this down
34:41 - and again don't worry if you don't know
34:42 - what i'm doing i will explain all these
34:44 - keys a little bit later
34:46 - okay so i have this in the front right
34:49 - and now you're probably thinking well
34:50 - okay chrissy you said don't just model
34:52 - from one view though like we're only in
34:54 - one view
34:55 - this doesn't help blender actually
34:58 - allows us
34:59 - to split screens so we can actually
35:02 - model from different views
35:04 - all at the same time so there's two ways
35:07 - that we can do that one manually and one
35:10 - through blender blender will set it up
35:12 - for us
35:13 - so i'm going to show the manual way so
35:15 - if you ever want to split your screen
35:17 - so that you can model in different views
35:20 - at once
35:21 - all you have to do is come to a corner
35:24 - and you'll see
35:25 - the mouse turns into a crosshair and
35:28 - when you get that crosshair
35:29 - you just drag oh
35:34 - so there we go okay you just drag and
35:37 - it'll give you
35:39 - another screen okay so now both of these
35:43 - are in front because when you split your
35:45 - screen initially it's going to split it
35:46 - the exact same way so whatever view
35:49 - you're in in one screen it's going to
35:51 - duplicate in the other screen
35:53 - but let's say that i wanted to model in
35:55 - both front
35:56 - and maybe like right view so what i'll
35:58 - do is i'll come over to this right side
36:00 - here
36:01 - and i'm going to hit three okay so now i
36:05 - have the front
36:07 - and the right so when i make a change so
36:09 - let's say i decide to wrote this
36:11 - rotate this i can see what happens
36:15 - in both views at once which is really
36:18 - really useful
36:19 - because as you're modeling and you're
36:20 - getting used to
36:22 - what i call walking around the model so
36:25 - just
36:26 - making sure that we're using or viewing
36:28 - the model from all angles as we move
36:31 - is that again as you make a change in
36:33 - one view it's going to show how it
36:34 - affects
36:35 - in the other view so it kind of breaks
36:37 - you out of that
36:38 - one perspective kind of view and mindset
36:42 - now we only have the reference in the
36:45 - front view though so that doesn't really
36:47 - help us
36:47 - but we can do the same thing we can drag
36:53 - you can drag and drop our reference
36:56 - over in the right view as well so i'm
36:59 - gonna move this
37:02 - i'm gonna move this over some just gonna
37:04 - rearrange
37:06 - my is a little bit right now because as
37:08 - you can see they're stacked so i'm just
37:10 - gonna move this one back a little bit
37:12 - and put me back in front okay
37:15 - so now i can move my box
37:19 - i'm gonna grab it i had a quick question
37:24 - which is um so i noticed like this like
37:27 - for example the
37:28 - pressing the numbers doesn't work for me
37:30 - because i'm just on a laptop without a
37:31 - number pad
37:32 - and also like i'm using the track pad so
37:35 - i'm assuming are you using a regular
37:36 - mouse or some of the stuff you're doing
37:38 - like is that
37:38 - like is that recommended let me actually
37:41 - show you how to fix that thank you for
37:42 - bringing that up because that was
37:43 - something that was like
37:44 - chrissy make sure you know this but i'm
37:47 - so sorry
37:47 - so if you are on a laptop and you're
37:49 - like i can't move what's happening
37:52 - blender is built for using a mouse um
37:55 - and using like
37:56 - the three click system so using the
37:57 - wheel as a click so if you are on a
37:59 - laptop right now and you want to be able
38:00 - to move without a mouse and just use
38:02 - your
38:03 - trackpad all you have to do is go to
38:05 - file
38:06 - or sorry go to edit and we're going to
38:09 - scroll down here to preferences
38:12 - and then we're going to go down here to
38:14 - the input tab
38:16 - and then you just click emulate numpad
38:19 - so this is going to allow you to use
38:21 - the numbers on your keyboard and then
38:23 - you also click
38:24 - emulate three button mouse and that'll
38:27 - help you
38:28 - move around thank you dan for bringing
38:30 - that up so again if you are on a laptop
38:33 - and you want to be able to move without
38:35 - a mouse and you want to be able to use
38:37 - the keys
38:38 - that are already on your keyboard just
38:39 - go to edit preferences
38:42 - then we'll go down here to the input tab
38:44 - and then we'll click
38:46 - emulate numpad and then we'll also click
38:48 - emulate three map
38:49 - three button mouse and how did you
38:51 - delete the mu image that's one
38:52 - that i could get to work maybe i should
38:56 - okay so
38:56 - i was gonna wait to completely do like
38:59 - oh sorry
39:00 - it's fine i think it makes more sense
39:03 - for me to talk about the buttons that
39:04 - i'm clicking while i do this i'll just
39:06 - i'll just go ahead and say all the
39:07 - buttons on these things that way it'll
39:09 - make a little bit more sense
39:11 - okay so in order to delete what we'll do
39:14 - is you just click so a regular like left
39:17 - click
39:18 - and then you hit x and it'll prompt you
39:20 - here say okay delete
39:22 - and you just click it and then
39:26 - you can delete anything like that okay
39:29 - so i'm going to bring this back in
39:32 - really quick and just a note if your
39:34 - reference isn't coming in
39:36 - there can be two reasons why that's
39:38 - happening one reason why it won't come
39:40 - in is
39:40 - if you click on your object your
39:42 - reference for whatever reason might not
39:44 - want to come in
39:45 - so you just want to click off of it and
39:48 - then try to drag it in
39:49 - also if it's not coming in it's very
39:51 - possible that you're in a different mode
39:54 - so make sure to look up here and make
39:56 - sure it says object mode
39:58 - so if you want to bring in new objects
40:00 - anytime you want to bring in a new
40:02 - object whether it's a reference photo
40:05 - whether it's another mesh such as this
40:07 - cube here
40:08 - you always want to make sure you're in
40:09 - object mode okay so for whatever reason
40:11 - your reference isn't coming in
40:13 - just make sure we're an object okay so
40:16 - [Applause]
40:18 - again what i'm going to do is
40:22 - really quickly i'm just resetting
40:25 - everything to the center where this
40:27 - crosshair is and to do that
40:29 - all you have to do is press option and
40:31 - then g
40:34 - and with my scrim and do the same thing
40:36 - just press option g and that just moved
40:38 - everything down here to the middle
40:41 - okay so again on the right side here we
40:44 - are in front view
40:45 - on the left side we're on we're in right
40:48 - view
40:49 - and something else i want to note really
40:50 - quick too is that
40:52 - as you can see up here it says right
40:53 - orthographic
40:55 - and if i press 5 it's going to say right
40:57 - perspective
40:58 - so i want everyone to make sure that
40:59 - you're in orthographic mode
41:01 - okay there are two different modes in
41:03 - blender orthographic and perspective
41:05 - i don't want to explain that right now
41:07 - because it's very very confusing
41:08 - long story short you mostly use
41:10 - perspective if you're doing like
41:12 - scene modeling so for example if you
41:14 - want to model outer space
41:17 - you'll probably want to use perspective
41:18 - but if you're doing like character
41:20 - modeling
41:21 - anything that's going to use details you
41:23 - always want to make sure you're in
41:24 - orthographic
41:25 - okay and again you'll know where you are
41:27 - because blender will say it in this top
41:28 - left corner here and let me make this
41:31 - bigger sorry so you can see everything
41:34 - okay so again if you're in perspective
41:37 - just hit five
41:38 - it'll put you in orthographic mode okay
41:41 - so we have our reference set up
41:43 - in the right side and left side i'm
41:45 - going to move
41:47 - my cube over so in order to move it
41:51 - i'm just going to click it i'm just
41:53 - going to left click it once
41:54 - then i'm going to hit g which is grab
41:58 - and then what i want to note quickly
41:59 - before i move it is as you can see
42:02 - up here um this is kind of like your
42:04 - axis that's going to tell you
42:06 - kind of where you are in space or how to
42:09 - make a movement
42:10 - okay so as you can see on this side if i
42:12 - want to move right
42:14 - i'm going to move it on the y but on
42:16 - this side if i wanted to move right
42:18 - i would move it on the x and the reason
42:21 - for that is because we're in two
42:22 - different views
42:23 - okay so again if you're you feel lost
42:26 - you're not sure where you are
42:27 - first make sure that you check on the
42:30 - top left
42:30 - and then if you're like well i don't
42:31 - really know how to move then you can
42:33 - check on the top
42:34 - right just to try to figure out where to
42:36 - go
42:37 - okay so i'm going to come over here to
42:40 - this left panel
42:41 - because i want to move my box in front
42:44 - of this right view of mu or this
42:49 - the left view of mu he's facing left so
42:52 - what i'm going to do is i'm going to
42:53 - click onto the box
42:54 - so just one left click and then i'm
42:56 - going to hit g
42:58 - to grab and then remember we're on this
43:01 - side so if we want to move right
43:03 - we're going to use the y axis so i'm
43:05 - going to click i'm going to hit g
43:08 - and then i'm going to hit y so that i
43:10 - can move it
43:11 - left or right and now i'm just going to
43:13 - move the box
43:15 - right over mu and as you can see on this
43:16 - side it disappeared a little bit that's
43:18 - only because my references are
43:20 - kind of crosshaired like this so i'm
43:21 - going to move this reference back
43:24 - this front reference here by clicking it
43:26 - i'm going to hit g
43:27 - and now this time if i want to move
43:28 - right again we're going to use that
43:30 - y-axis i'm just going to move
43:32 - back here okay so now on the right side
43:36 - where we're in the front view
43:38 - we have our box in front of the right
43:41 - meme
43:41 - reference here and on the left side when
43:44 - we're modeling in the right
43:45 - even though i guess technically it
43:46 - should have been the left but that's
43:47 - okay um
43:49 - we have our box in front of the side
43:52 - reference
43:52 - of mu so again as we make a change
43:56 - in one so if i come over here and i
43:58 - rotate
43:59 - and to rotate you just hit r so if i
44:01 - rotate on the right
44:03 - i will see in real time how it affects
44:05 - the front
44:07 - okay so this is really important again
44:08 - because we are working in multiple
44:11 - angles all at once
44:12 - and we always want to know how kind of
44:15 - what we do in one angle
44:17 - affects the other and on that note
44:20 - something i just want to note really
44:21 - quickly is that
44:22 - references in 2d don't always perfectly
44:25 - translate in 3d
44:27 - so everything here with mu you know
44:30 - looks up to spec
44:31 - from our eye because we are seeing it in
44:33 - separate angles
44:34 - but sometimes when we try to combine all
44:36 - the references we'll notice
44:37 - like maybe the arm was like a little bit
44:39 - higher in the front reference than it is
44:41 - on the side reference
44:42 - and maybe the ears are a little bit more
44:44 - back in the front reference than they
44:45 - are on the side reference
44:47 - so with references they are your best
44:49 - friend you want to love them you want to
44:51 - cherish them but
44:52 - you don't want to marry them you want to
44:54 - stay flexible because as you are
44:56 - manipulating different
44:57 - angles you're going to notice that
44:59 - things may not line up
45:01 - and that's okay you can just use your
45:02 - best judgment to make adjustments from
45:04 - there
45:06 - okay so this is our split this is
45:08 - usually where i like to keep splits
45:10 - because it could get a little
45:13 - a little tight in the area but you can
45:15 - actually split
45:17 - the viewport as many times as you want
45:19 - so let's say you have 16 different
45:21 - references
45:22 - if you wanted to split the viewport 16
45:25 - different times
45:26 - in 16 different ways you totally could
45:29 - so again all you have to do to do that
45:31 - is come to any corner
45:34 - and just drag up
45:37 - okay and now i can change this one to
45:40 - the back so now i'll know what's
45:42 - happening in the back and i can do the
45:44 - same over here
45:45 - i can just drag it up and i'll change
45:48 - this one
45:49 - to the left so now as i'm making a
45:51 - change in the front
45:54 - i will now see what's happening oh the
45:56 - bottom one is kind of blocked but
45:58 - you can see the point that as i move in
46:00 - one
46:01 - i know what's happening in every single
46:03 - angle
46:05 - okay and now if we want to get rid of
46:07 - these if you're
46:08 - trying to like grab and you're like oh
46:10 - no i keep making a million windows i've
46:12 - been here before and i panicked and i
46:14 - completely like closed out a project and
46:17 - started from scratch so i was like i
46:18 - don't know how to get rid of all these
46:19 - windows
46:20 - don't worry there's an easy way to do
46:22 - that all you have to do is come over
46:24 - just hover over the line where it gives
46:25 - you that two kind of arrows you'll right
46:27 - click
46:28 - on your track pad then you just hit join
46:30 - area
46:31 - i'm gonna do that again just right click
46:34 - join area and then you'll click which
46:37 - way you wanna join so you can join up
46:38 - you can join down and then again
46:43 - i'm just going to join all these i'm
46:44 - going to bring us back to two
46:46 - screens now
46:49 - if you don't want to do all the dragging
46:51 - or if dragging feels hard or maybe your
46:53 - trackpad doesn't work all that great
46:55 - you can also do this a blender will set
46:58 - things up manually for you
46:59 - so you can come up here to the view tab
47:03 - you come all the way down to area and
47:06 - you'll see a couple different options so
47:07 - we have
47:08 - a toggle quad view which will give us
47:11 - before again
47:12 - which that gave us four on one side just
47:13 - because i already had it split so then
47:15 - if you want to get rid of that you can
47:16 - come back to area and just hit toggle
47:18 - quad view again
47:19 - it'll get rid of it and there's also
47:22 - options for the horizontal split we have
47:24 - vertical splits
47:25 - however you want to split it blender can
47:27 - automatically do that for you
47:29 - this is also really useful if you want
47:31 - to start to make a transition
47:33 - into like animation or rigging or even
47:36 - when you're rendering um i can set
47:39 - for example i'm just gonna really
47:41 - quickly show you what edit mode looks
47:43 - like and again i will explain this later
47:44 - when we're actually modeling
47:46 - so on the left or on the left here now
47:48 - i'm in edit mode
47:50 - and i'm gonna make this one whoops
47:56 - sorry i'm gonna make this actually
48:02 - so this is a rendered view so i haven't
48:05 - made any
48:06 - changes to the square so you're not
48:07 - really going to notice the difference
48:08 - but like if i change the color for
48:10 - example
48:11 - which i can do that really quick just so
48:14 - you can see what i
48:15 - mean so i'm going to change this color
48:20 - to blue okay so as you can see on our
48:23 - left side we have the rendered view so
48:25 - when you start to do things like
48:26 - adding textures or adding colors
48:30 - none of that is going to show when
48:31 - you're in object mode or when you're in
48:33 - edit mode as you're
48:34 - reworking the mesh but if you want to
48:36 - see in real time kind of what everything
48:38 - looks like you'll be able to see it
48:40 - if you have kind of that split so
48:42 - splitting is really useful for one
48:43 - keeping track of how
48:44 - all angles look like at the same time
48:46 - but it's also useful in your workflow
48:49 - as you're creating things like the
48:51 - render or creating the animation
48:53 - you're just able to see everything all
48:55 - at once which is
48:56 - really really useful okay so i'm going
48:59 - to
49:00 - come back out of
49:04 - that rendered mode
49:07 - okay so i'm going to put us back
49:10 - in right and in front
49:14 - and i'm going to reset the rotation of
49:17 - this cube by just hitting
49:18 - option r so it's just going to clear any
49:21 - rotation that we did
49:23 - and i think this is a good
49:26 - point to start to move into the demo
49:30 - from you but before we get to demoing i
49:32 - just want to explain how to move
49:34 - period in blender one what one question
49:38 - came up in the chat and
49:39 - i wasn't gonna ask it because i was
49:41 - having trouble with it too
49:42 - i'm having trouble figuring out i have
49:44 - exactly what you have
49:46 - but i'm having trouble on the right
49:47 - panel the front orthographic view
49:49 - getting the mu uh the reference image to
49:53 - move behind the cube
49:54 - that should be along the x axis so to do
49:58 - that
49:58 - yeah so okay so we're in the front
50:02 - here right now we want to move this
50:03 - reference back what i usually do is
50:05 - i'll just kind of like turn to see which
50:09 - way it needs to go and
50:11 - these lines here correspond to every
50:13 - axis so
50:14 - this green one is y this red one
50:17 - is x you can't see the z one right now
50:20 - but the z is always blue
50:21 - so um since our y is the one in
50:25 - in behind the reference we're just going
50:28 - to click the reference
50:29 - and then we'll hit g and then we'll hit
50:32 - y
50:33 - and that'll allow us to move it back got
50:36 - it
50:38 - cool great question okay so
50:41 - let's talk about movement before we even
50:45 - start to make
50:47 - our mute okay so first since we already
50:49 - talked about kind of the views
50:51 - just to review if you want to change
50:54 - what view you are
50:55 - in you can either come up here to the
50:57 - view tab
50:59 - and go to viewport and it'll show you
51:02 - all the options
51:03 - or if you are a hotkey person you can
51:06 - come to memorize them and you can use
51:08 - your keyboard to just move around so one
51:11 - is front
51:13 - three is right uh command three is left
51:16 - i think command one is back and then if
51:19 - you don't wanna memorize every single
51:21 - one
51:22 - what i usually do or what i have done is
51:25 - i just memorize front and right so front
51:28 - is one
51:30 - right is three and then if i want to go
51:32 - to the back all you have to do
51:34 - is hit nine to go to the opposite so
51:36 - when i was in front it sent me to the
51:38 - back
51:39 - and now if i hit nine again so i'm in
51:41 - the back it'll take me back to the front
51:43 - and this will happen again with right
51:45 - view so if i hit three to go to right
51:47 - view
51:48 - and i want to go to the left view i can
51:50 - just hit nine
51:51 - that's going to put me in the left and
51:53 - if i want to go back to
51:54 - the right view just hit nine again and
51:57 - now i'm back in the right and that way
51:58 - you don't have to memorize
51:59 - every single key okay so that is moving
52:03 - views but we can also move in between
52:06 - views
52:07 - okay so if you want to look at three
52:08 - quarter if you want
52:10 - to look at the top and there's actually
52:12 - top buttons as well i think
52:13 - seven there we go seven is top
52:16 - and if you hit nine it'll put you on the
52:18 - bottom if you hit nine again
52:21 - it'll take you back up top but again
52:23 - there's angles in between top and bottom
52:26 - there's angles in between the front like
52:27 - sometimes we need to see
52:29 - some weird angle maybe like under mu's
52:32 - tail or like i don't know if that looks
52:33 - right
52:34 - you can move just by putting two fingers
52:37 - on your track pad
52:39 - and just moving about okay so this will
52:41 - allow you to rotate
52:43 - we can go up and down we can go all
52:45 - around
52:46 - and then if we feel dizzy and we're like
52:48 - oh gosh i'm seeing too much
52:50 - take me back to front we'll just hit one
52:52 - to go back
52:53 - but now you're probably like well okay i
52:55 - can rotate
52:57 - but i can't go left to right like how do
52:59 - i
53:00 - move left to right so in order to do
53:03 - that
53:04 - you just hold shift and use those same
53:06 - two fingers
53:08 - and you'll be able to shift left and
53:10 - right
53:11 - or up and down or diagonal
53:15 - whichever way you want to go okay so we
53:18 - release shift
53:19 - and just use two fingers if we just want
53:21 - to rotate
53:22 - around something and then we use shift
53:27 - in two fingers if we want to shift
53:31 - to the side shift up shift down
53:35 - okay so that is the basics of
53:38 - movement um so the basics then
53:42 - of kind of manipulating we'll talk about
53:46 - now
53:47 - so there are multiple modes if you click
53:50 - this tab here where it says object mode
53:52 - oh and that's actually not showing it
53:54 - for some reason
53:56 - oh there we go okay so if you click this
53:59 - tab here
54:00 - you're gonna see there's a bunch of
54:01 - different modes don't worry about any of
54:03 - those right now
54:04 - the only two that we're gonna worry
54:05 - about today are object mode
54:07 - and edit mode okay so again right now
54:10 - we're in object mode we use
54:11 - object mode to add in or take out
54:14 - objects okay so let's say that i wanted
54:17 - to add in
54:19 - a sphere for whatever reason we can do
54:22 - that either by going to
54:24 - this add panel up here and then you'll
54:27 - go to mesh
54:28 - and you can pick any type of mesh that
54:30 - you see there
54:31 - so add mesh and any mesh that you want
54:35 - to add
54:35 - you can go in there or if you are again
54:37 - a hotkey
54:38 - person you can just hit shift a it's
54:41 - going to bring up that same exact screen
54:43 - and then we can pick something here so
54:45 - i'm going to pick suzanne
54:46 - which is the monkey i think her origins
54:49 - are from i want to say silent bob
54:52 - something like that i don't remember but
54:54 - she's like blender's mascot
54:55 - so i just added in a suzanne here but
54:58 - now suzanne has nothing to do with mew
55:00 - so when i want to get rid of suzanne all
55:03 - you have to do to get rid of an object
55:05 - is to click it so you just
55:08 - left click you hit x and then delete
55:12 - okay so again we add with shift a
55:15 - and then we'll pick a mesh and as you
55:18 - can see there are other things to add
55:19 - but again we'll talk about that another
55:20 - day
55:25 - object match i deleted my um
55:28 - uh my cube instead of
55:32 - the the monkey so i can just so i could
55:34 - just do add
55:35 - add cube back in is what i would do you
55:37 - can add queue back in
55:39 - and if you are like oh it's no longer in
55:42 - the center so let's say for whatever
55:44 - reason
55:44 - you added it in it's like over here or
55:47 - something
55:48 - and you wanted to put it back in the
55:49 - center where that crosshair is
55:51 - all you have to do is to option
55:54 - g and that clears the location and puts
55:56 - it right back in the middle there
55:58 - because i'm going to get rid of that one
56:00 - so now as you notice
56:02 - when you add in an object so i'm going
56:04 - to add suzanne back in here
56:05 - it's pretty big at least it's bigger
56:08 - than our reference so you're probably
56:09 - like how do we make this smaller
56:12 - all you have to do to make things bigger
56:13 - and smaller is you just click
56:15 - so left click and then you'll hit s
56:18 - for scale and then you just drag up or
56:21 - down
56:23 - as big as you want there's other ways to
56:25 - do this you can scale precisely by
56:27 - typing numbers
56:28 - in you can also scale on different axis
56:32 - so right now i think i'm scaling on the
56:35 - z-axis let's say i wanted to scale on y
56:39 - all you have to do is i'm going to go
56:42 - ahead and click this again
56:43 - i'm going to hit s and i'm going to hit
56:45 - y
56:46 - and that's going to allow me and you'll
56:47 - see on the right side now i'm scaling in
56:49 - the y
56:50 - instead of the z-axis you can do that
56:52 - with any axis that you want to do
56:55 - okay and now let's say we have this and
56:57 - you're like i hate this
56:59 - how do i get back just with any other
57:01 - program to
57:02 - kind of redo or to go back to what you
57:04 - had previously all you have to do is hit
57:07 - command z or control z if you're on a
57:09 - windows computer
57:11 - and now we're right back okay and then
57:14 - let's see what are there some some
57:15 - basics um you probably saw me earlier
57:17 - rotating
57:18 - so again if you want to rotate it's
57:20 - going to be the same deal so you'll just
57:22 - click the object
57:23 - just regular left click then you'll hit
57:26 - r
57:27 - to rotate and then again you just click
57:30 - and drag
57:32 - and it's the same deal with scaling if
57:34 - you want to scale on particular axis
57:36 - so let's say i wanted to rotate on the y
57:40 - then i'm just going to hit y it's going
57:42 - to switch it
57:43 - i guess you can really see in that one
57:44 - let's say i want to do it on z
57:47 - then it then lets me scale it in a
57:48 - different way and now this is x that i
57:51 - just hit so now i'm
57:52 - rotating x now i hit y and i'm back
57:55 - rotating
57:56 - in y okay and again if you're like i
57:59 - don't want this
58:00 - how do i go back you just hit command c
58:04 - and also just to note when you find an
58:06 - angle
58:07 - that is perfect you're like this is a
58:09 - perfect rotation in order to keep it
58:10 - here
58:11 - all you have to do is left click again
58:13 - and that'll set it
58:15 - wherever you want it okay so
58:18 - those are kind of the basics of moving
58:21 - your object
58:22 - in object mode so now let's talk about
58:25 - editing okay so i'm going to get rid of
58:29 - this suzanne head
58:30 - again by clicking x and then delete
58:35 - and um let's go to
58:38 - edit mode i actually don't model with
58:40 - the cube but i'm going to show just the
58:42 - basics of editing with the cube and then
58:44 - i'll show
58:44 - everyone how i usually go about modeling
58:47 - so in order to get into edit mode
58:49 - there's two ways that you can do that
58:50 - of course so either you can click the
58:53 - object
58:54 - and then you can hit tab and that will
58:57 - take you to edit mode you'll know if you
58:58 - did it right because it'll say
58:59 - up here into edit or you can again
59:04 - click the object you can come up here to
59:06 - the tab
59:08 - and then you can just come down here to
59:09 - edit mode and again you'll know if it
59:11 - takes because it'll it'll display it
59:12 - right up here
59:14 - okay now that we're in edit mode you see
59:17 - that things look a little bit different
59:18 - you see like the little points here
59:21 - and the reason why is that blender
59:24 - is a vertex based okay so the way that
59:27 - we make
59:28 - models is by manipulating vertices
59:31 - you can also manipulate edges which are
59:34 - just
59:34 - any lines you can also manipulate faces
59:37 - which are just any faces created by
59:40 - connecting the edges and the vertices
59:42 - but the kind of basis is vertex
59:44 - manipulation
59:45 - and just in general the more vertices
59:48 - that you have on a model
59:49 - usually the more realistic it's going to
59:51 - look so i usually do low poly art as you
59:54 - saw
59:54 - in the real so i don't use a whole lot
59:57 - of vertices
59:58 - but if i wanted to make things smoother
60:01 - if i wanted to make things look more
60:03 - realistic to
60:04 - it's a material world i would just add
60:06 - in more vertices
60:08 - okay that's just something to keep in
60:09 - mind okay so let's talk about
60:11 - manipulating these so in order to do
60:14 - that
60:15 - there's a couple of different ways that
60:17 - you can
60:18 - grab and move your vertices
60:22 - okay so i'm going to talk about first
60:24 - the ways that we can grab
60:26 - so one the simplest way is you can just
60:29 - drag
60:32 - and drop and you'll see i guess it's a
60:35 - little bit hard to see on my screen
60:37 - but you'll see it'll highlight whatever
60:39 - you grab is now
60:40 - to be this yellowish orange color
60:44 - okay so i'm going to do that again so to
60:46 - let go of anything that you grab
60:48 - you just click off so you see it turn
60:50 - back black
60:51 - and then if i want to grab it again i
60:54 - can just drag
60:56 - and drop now there's other ways to grab
60:59 - as well there's something called
61:00 - uh box selecting which honestly looks
61:04 - the exact same
61:05 - but i'll show you anyway so if you hit b
61:08 - it's going to give you this crosshair
61:10 - you can do the same exact thing you just
61:12 - drag
61:13 - whatever you want over whatever you want
61:14 - to grab and drop
61:16 - and you'll see it highlighted okay and
61:19 - then to release we'll just left click
61:22 - and there's one more that you can do
61:23 - which i actually think is really useful
61:24 - called circle select
61:26 - so if you hit c now we're going to get
61:28 - this circle in the crosshair
61:30 - and if you drag it just allows you to
61:34 - kind of grab vertices that are not in
61:36 - the same area so if i wanted to grab
61:38 - like all of mu's foot for example and
61:40 - there's like a bunch of vertices
61:42 - i can just drag this circle select all
61:44 - over it
61:45 - okay and then to release it
61:49 - with circle select you have to press
61:50 - enter and then you press
61:53 - left click to let it go okay so those
61:56 - are the basics for grabbing but i want
61:58 - to show you all something because this
61:59 - is another
62:00 - kind of wall that i hit when i was first
62:04 - modeling
62:04 - is that i went and i grabbed
62:08 - uh i used the cube because it was what
62:10 - was default here
62:11 - so i was like yeah this is great i'm
62:13 - about to model i went
62:14 - i box select here or i dragged to select
62:18 - i grabbed this vertice using g
62:21 - and i moved it and i was like
62:25 - yeah this is great everything's going
62:27 - wonderfully
62:29 - the whole cube is moving and then i
62:32 - turned it
62:32 - and i realized oh the back the back is
62:36 - the back is not it's not moving at all
62:38 - okay so if you
62:40 - want to grab in a way that's going to
62:43 - move your
62:43 - entire 3d object so i'm going to ctrl z
62:47 - or command z to get back here if i want
62:49 - to manipulate
62:51 - all of the vertices on one side another
62:54 - trick that we can do
62:55 - is we can change this to wireframe mode
62:59 - so right now we're in solid view so we
63:01 - see every single face we see every
63:03 - single edge but if we
63:04 - click z it's going to bring up this
63:08 - wheel this option wheel and again don't
63:11 - worry about these other two here we're
63:12 - going to worry about just solid and
63:14 - wireframe today but if we click
63:16 - wireframes it's going to allow us to we
63:19 - get this x-ray view
63:21 - of our 3d model it's going to allow us
63:23 - to see
63:24 - the reference in the back but it's also
63:26 - going to allow us to grab
63:28 - any vertices that are kind of in the
63:30 - back i just have to say that is so
63:32 - cool i know it's so great
63:36 - i didn't realize there's so many like
63:38 - key commands it's almost like you're
63:40 - learning a
63:40 - whole separate language because i mean
63:44 - it's it's friendly and intuitive in one
63:47 - sense
63:47 - in the sense that you're sort of
63:48 - manipulating this 3d physical world but
63:51 - i imagine it must take a ton of practice
63:53 - to get all of the like
63:55 - key sequences it's uh in like i just
63:58 - keep making mistakes and like undo undo
64:00 - and do
64:01 - yeah is that was that your experience
64:03 - yeah
64:04 - absolutely i mean it took me i mean i've
64:07 - been i think
64:08 - 3d modeling on my own for maybe two
64:11 - years
64:12 - now and i have learned a lot of really
64:15 - cool tricks
64:16 - but there's still there's still so much
64:18 - to learn it's a really cool program
64:20 - though and
64:21 - there's a lot of ways to do certain
64:23 - things like
64:24 - dan and i were kind of talking before
64:26 - the live about how
64:27 - modeling is a lot like code where you
64:30 - know
64:30 - there's multiple ways multiple solutions
64:33 - to get to the same thing so
64:34 - even as we're moving through this if
64:36 - you're seeing something kind of
64:37 - interesting
64:38 - that i haven't talked about or if you
64:39 - just want to try something weird
64:41 - and of course i totally recommend that
64:44 - um the more that you experience
64:46 - experiment the more you're going to
64:47 - discover and the more you're going to
64:49 - find like a way that works
64:50 - for you so definitely feel free to poke
64:53 - around don't feel like you have to do
64:54 - exactly what i'm doing
64:56 - get lost make mistakes i'll make
64:58 - mistakes too
64:59 - it's going to be great it's all going to
65:01 - be great
65:02 - okay so we are in wireframe mode now so
65:06 - again if
65:07 - you missed that we started in solid
65:10 - so to get to wireframe to be able to see
65:12 - the reference and to be able to see
65:14 - through the model all you have to do is
65:16 - hit d
65:17 - and it's going to bring up this wheel
65:18 - here and even these have hot commands so
65:21 - you can hit
65:22 - z4 to go to wireframe if you don't want
65:24 - to learn hot keys
65:25 - all you have to do is click wireframe
65:27 - and that's going to bring us here
65:29 - and when we're in wireframe again the
65:31 - benefit here is that you're able to grab
65:34 - any vertices in the back that you can't
65:36 - see
65:37 - okay so for example if you remember when
65:39 - we were in solid mode and i grabbed that
65:40 - front vertices
65:42 - i only grabbed the front but now if i
65:44 - drag
65:46 - and grab so i'm going to hit g to grab
65:49 - all of the vertices are going to move
65:52 - so i'm just going to do the same thing
65:54 - i'm going to grab
65:56 - and click and drag hit g
66:02 - and i'm going to drag again
66:05 - and hit g so now if i take this back to
66:07 - solid
66:08 - and i turn oh
66:11 - the model is a little bit behind but you
66:14 - can see that v
66:15 - here let me just move this so you can
66:17 - see it perfectly
66:18 - let me grab this whole thing
66:23 - there you go okay i'm gonna put this
66:24 - back in solid and i'm just gonna move
66:26 - this a little bit to the front just so
66:27 - you can
66:30 - whoops
66:32 - grab okay i'm just gonna move it away
66:35 - from the reference a little bit just so
66:36 - you can see it but
66:38 - as you can see when we move the front
66:39 - vertices it moves the back vertices as
66:41 - well so whatever we did in the front
66:43 - corresponded to the back so whenever you
66:45 - want to move like a whole side of
66:47 - something
66:48 - you want to make sure you're in wire
66:50 - frame so that those back vertices that
66:52 - you can't really grab from the front
66:53 - get moved too i'm going to move this
66:55 - back just so
66:57 - you don't get lost okay so
67:01 - like i said though i don't often model
67:05 - with the starting cube i usually like to
67:08 - start with a plane
67:10 - so i think i think now's a good time to
67:12 - get into this mew reference so i'm gonna
67:15 - um i'm gonna start from the beginning
67:19 - i think i'm gonna close out i think i'm
67:21 - gonna close out blender
67:23 - i'm gonna start us up from the very
67:24 - beginning as if i was going
67:26 - to model this that way we can walk all
67:29 - the way through and i will know
67:30 - every single thing that i do and should
67:32 - we do that too do you think or like
67:34 - should i keep mine
67:35 - open like right now i have mine with the
67:38 - two new references and my
67:40 - warped strange mangled cube that i've
67:43 - been really enjoying twisting all the
67:44 - vertices
67:45 - i feel like i have to show it really
67:46 - quickly i'm going to show it people can
67:48 - see that i'm showing my screen
67:49 - you can't see it it's the problem
67:51 - [Laughter]
67:54 - but now i'm back now i'm back to your
67:56 - screen perfect i think
67:58 - do what makes you feel the most
68:00 - comfortable if you like what you've set
68:01 - up so far
68:02 - definitely keep it if you want to just
68:05 - kind of
68:05 - walk through what it feels like from the
68:07 - very beginning
68:09 - do that too whatever feels more
68:10 - comfortable is what i would encourage
68:13 - okay so i'm going to x out of blender
68:16 - now
68:17 - i'm not going to save this but don't
68:18 - need this
68:20 - okay so i'm back on my desktop i am
68:23 - pulling blender
68:25 - back up okay so this is what blender
68:30 - looks like
68:31 - when you open it any recent files that
68:34 - you have will show up here so you can
68:36 - just jump straight into them
68:38 - if you want to do a new file you can
68:40 - just go ahead and
68:41 - over here and click general if you don't
68:42 - want to click anything you're just like
68:43 - i want this box out of my way
68:45 - you can just left click off of it and
68:46 - it's going to put you in that starting
68:48 - screen
68:48 - as well okay so again when you open
68:51 - blender it's always going to start you
68:53 - off
68:53 - with a cube but then you probably notice
68:55 - there's two other things here
68:57 - so this here is a light and this here is
69:00 - a camera
69:01 - i don't i want to explain this but i
69:04 - also don't want to get too deep
69:05 - into this because you use these for
69:07 - rendering and we're probably not going
69:08 - to get
69:08 - to that step just yet but just in the
69:11 - same way that you kind of have to set up
69:13 - your composition in 2d
69:15 - how you have to set up your light to
69:16 - create certain shadows you have to do
69:18 - the same thing in 3d and you use the
69:20 - camera and use the light to do that
69:22 - but today we're not going to use that so
69:24 - i'm just going to get rid of these
69:24 - things
69:25 - so again to do that we're going to just
69:28 - uh
69:28 - left click on the camera i'm going to
69:31 - hit x
69:33 - and then we're going to delete it and
69:35 - we're going to do the same with the
69:36 - light
69:36 - by left clicking i'm going to hit x
69:40 - we're going to delete it and now like i
69:42 - said i don't use the cube either to
69:44 - start some people do
69:45 - some people use the cube to start some
69:47 - people use the sphere to start
69:49 - some people use a single vertices to
69:51 - start you can literally do
69:54 - whatever feels most natural whatever
69:56 - shape
69:57 - feels most natural and also what feels
69:59 - most natural to your
70:00 - model so for example if you're modeling
70:02 - like a snowman
70:03 - you might want to start with a sphere
70:05 - but i usually my bass is that i usually
70:07 - start with a plane
70:09 - so i'm going to delete this cube as well
70:11 - by left clicking
70:13 - hitting x and deleting
70:16 - okay now before we even pull the plane
70:18 - in we just want to make sure we are in
70:20 - the right perspective so remember when
70:21 - you're doing character modeling
70:23 - anything that you need detail honestly
70:26 - most models i would say probably
70:28 - at least in the beginning you're
70:30 - probably going to want to use
70:31 - orthographic modes
70:32 - only so to make sure that we're in
70:34 - orthographic we're just going to hit
70:35 - 5 okay and we're going to know that
70:38 - we're in orthographic because it's going
70:39 - to say it
70:40 - up here in the left okay so now
70:44 - i'm going to hit one to put myself in
70:47 - front view
70:48 - and we're going to bring the mu model in
70:52 - or the new reference i'm sorry so to do
70:54 - that all we're going to do
70:55 - is grab the new reference
70:59 - and drop it right in and another
71:01 - navigation thing that i forgot to
71:02 - mention is that if you want to
71:04 - zoom in and zoom out all you have to do
71:06 - is press the uh
71:08 - the plus icon on your keyboard to go in
71:12 - and the minus icon go out
71:15 - okay so plus and minus
71:18 - and something else i forgot to mention
71:20 - is that in the same way that you can
71:21 - manipulate your objects you can also
71:25 - manipulate your references so
71:26 - as you notice when i first dropped it in
71:28 - the reference was pretty small
71:30 - so i reconciled that just by zooming in
71:33 - but if you're like i want the reference
71:34 - to be bigger you can just click the
71:36 - reference
71:37 - by usual left click you can hit scale
71:40 - the same way that you would with
71:41 - a model you can just drag it big or
71:44 - small as you want okay
71:48 - so we have our reference set up in our
71:52 - front view
71:54 - now we want to at least have one other
71:57 - view
71:57 - i'm going to be honest with y'all i
72:00 - often
72:01 - set up my split screen and i will set it
72:04 - up in front view in right view and then
72:06 - what i usually do is i end up keeping
72:07 - one
72:08 - in a view and then my other view kind of
72:10 - just becomes my
72:11 - whatever view i'm in like i just move
72:13 - around a lot but i'm gonna set it up
72:16 - in the way that what we've been talking
72:17 - about and if you feel like
72:20 - you know the two split isn't what you
72:21 - want you can add in another split
72:24 - you can use just the one view so again
72:26 - whatever feels the most natural for you
72:28 - is definitely the way you should go
72:30 - about modeling there's no like right or
72:31 - wrong here
72:32 - all right so again if we want to create
72:34 - that split we can either go to
72:38 - we can go to view we can come down to
72:41 - area
72:42 - and we can click horizontal split or
72:44 - vertical split or quad view whichever
72:46 - one that you really liked
72:48 - or if you want to do it yourself again
72:50 - you just come up to a corner
72:52 - until you get that crosshair icon just
72:54 - left click
72:55 - and drag all right so now we have our
72:59 - split here and let me
73:01 - make this full screen again okay so
73:04 - i'm gonna make my right side front view
73:07 - again
73:08 - which is already in front view and if
73:09 - you're not in front video and you want
73:10 - to get there you just hit one
73:13 - and i'm gonna make my left side right
73:15 - view
73:16 - by hitting three okay now as you notice
73:19 - once we hit that right view we can't see
73:21 - the reference anymore but we want to be
73:23 - able to see the reference so
73:24 - i'm just going to drag another one in
73:26 - there again
73:28 - and in order to do this drag again you
73:30 - want to make sure that you
73:31 - aren't like grabbing this reference or
73:33 - grabbing anything so just make sure
73:34 - first that you just click off so just a
73:36 - regular left click off of any
73:38 - object and we just drag this new
73:41 - reference right on in here
73:43 - and now again this is like floating in a
73:45 - random spot
73:46 - so if we want it kind of in the middle
73:48 - where the crosshair is
73:49 - we're just going to left click it we're
73:51 - going to hit option
73:52 - and we're going to hit g that's just
73:54 - going to clear the location
73:55 - i'm going to do the same thing with the
73:57 - one over here on the right so i'm going
73:58 - to click it
73:59 - and i'm going to hit option and then i'm
74:01 - going to hit
74:02 - g and that puts it in the back now if we
74:05 - remember from when we
74:06 - had already split things like they're
74:08 - kind of just sitting on top of each
74:10 - other which can create
74:11 - a little bit of like cluster when you do
74:14 - rotate out of a view so
74:16 - if we want to move a reference back i
74:19 - usually
74:20 - move the front reference back so we're
74:22 - just going to click
74:23 - so this is the front reference here just
74:25 - click it
74:27 - and then as you can see once i turn it
74:30 - the way that i'm going to want to move
74:31 - is on this y-axis so i can move it
74:33 - backwards
74:34 - so i'm just going to hit g to grab
74:37 - and i'm going to hit y and then i'll
74:39 - just pull it on back
74:42 - that way they're not oops i'm like
74:44 - hitting my zoom screen here
74:46 - it's not letting me move all the way
74:47 - back okay don't hit g
74:50 - and then i hit y okay and then i hit one
74:52 - to put myself back in
74:54 - so you can see on this left screen here
74:56 - that this is
74:57 - uh the front reference so they're not
74:59 - like cross hair
75:01 - on each other okay so let's put in our
75:04 - object
75:06 - i got all of that by the way i just want
75:07 - to say yes
75:10 - you're doing great
75:13 - okay so i'm going to show you the way
75:15 - that i usually model as
75:17 - like i said i usually use the plane
75:20 - instead
75:20 - of a cube i usually don't like to start
75:23 - even though it sounds
75:25 - i guess kind of backwards i don't like
75:27 - to start with a 3d object
75:29 - in blender even though we're modeling 3d
75:31 - because of the fact that
75:32 - um like i kind of like
75:35 - to get there's just less vertices
75:39 - to worry about it's the short answer um
75:42 - to keep yourself kind of like
75:45 - um free from like manipulating something
75:47 - in the back that you didn't really
75:48 - intend to
75:49 - i like to use the plane because it is
75:51 - just that one so if i'm moving one in
75:53 - the front
75:54 - i know that i'm not accidentally kind of
75:56 - messing up something in the back
75:57 - which is why i use planes but again if
75:59 - you like the cube that you already
76:01 - started
76:01 - you can stick with the cube you can just
76:04 - start with one single vertice
76:05 - you can start with a sphere whatever you
76:07 - can even start with suzanne
76:09 - whatever feels comfortable for you go
76:11 - ahead and start with that
76:13 - so in order to get our object in that we
76:16 - want to start
76:17 - modeling with first we want to make sure
76:20 - we're in object mode
76:21 - so if you're in edit mode right now you
76:23 - can either come up to this tab
76:24 - and click object mode or um
76:28 - you can hit the tap button it'll put you
76:30 - back in object
76:32 - and once we're in object mode we're
76:34 - going to go ahead and add in our mesh
76:36 - by pressing shift a so that's how we add
76:40 - something
76:40 - and then i'm going to choose the plane
76:44 - okay now our plane got set kind of flat
76:48 - on the ground so i'm going to want to
76:50 - turn it
76:51 - so that it is kind of facing the same
76:53 - way that mu is facing in the front here
76:54 - so i'm going to rotate it
76:56 - so what i'm going to do is i'm just
76:57 - going to hit r because it's already
76:59 - grabbed and we know that because it's
77:00 - yellow so i'm going to hit rotate
77:03 - and i always rotate in the wrong
77:04 - direction so forgive me if i do this
77:06 - wrong but we'll figure it out
77:07 - all i'm going to do is hit d because i
77:10 - think we're rotating on the v and hit
77:11 - 90.
77:12 - okay that was the wrong way so i'm going
77:14 - to reset that i'm going to hit r
77:16 - and i'm going to hit x and i'm going to
77:18 - hit 90. there we go
77:21 - and that's going to bring us forward
77:22 - okay so again to get it to
77:24 - flip in the same way that mu is facing
77:27 - we'll just hit r to rotate and then
77:30 - we'll hit
77:30 - x because we want to rotate it on the x
77:33 - and then i'm just going to type 90 and
77:36 - that's going to bring it
77:38 - 90 degrees a 90 degree rotation and then
77:41 - you just hit enter okay
77:44 - now this is huge
77:48 - completely covering mu so we want to be
77:50 - able to see mu so again
77:52 - we're going to go to wire mode by
77:55 - hitting z
77:57 - and then we're going to go to wireframe
77:59 - so now we can see precious mu in the
78:00 - back
78:02 - and then we're going to scale down this
78:05 - plane
78:06 - because it's way too big for me right
78:08 - now so we're just going to hit s
78:10 - to scale and we're just gonna
78:13 - bring it down and i'm gonna get a little
78:16 - bit closer
78:17 - so again if you need to zoom in and out
78:19 - you can zoom in with the plus button
78:20 - you can zoom back out with the minds
78:22 - button
78:24 - all right now what i usually do when it
78:27 - comes to modeling
78:28 - i usually start with the body of
78:31 - anything
78:32 - i do a lot of character models i do a
78:33 - lot of like human models so i'll usually
78:35 - try to start with the body
78:37 - and then i'll move to maybe like the
78:39 - head and then i usually
78:40 - worry about limbs later so we're going
78:42 - to start with the body here
78:44 - i usually start with the very base of
78:47 - the body and then i work up but you can
78:49 - start at the neck and work down
78:50 - whatever feels more comfortable but um
78:53 - for this
78:54 - just for the sake of demoing something
78:55 - i'm going to start at the bottom
78:58 - sorry to interrupt you how do you get
78:59 - the wireframe again i thought i got
79:01 - stuck there
79:02 - you're fine so to get the fire screen
79:03 - you just hit z and it's going to bring
79:05 - that wheel got it got it
79:09 - all right so we are going to start at
79:13 - the base
79:13 - of mu so to do that um with our
79:16 - plane already selected and again we know
79:19 - it's selected because it is that orangy
79:21 - color
79:21 - we're just going to hit g to grab and
79:23 - now if you want to grab with precision
79:26 - you can hit g and then z and that's
79:29 - going to slide it like perfectly
79:31 - kind of up and down if you don't care
79:33 - for it being perfect you just hit
79:35 - g and just like place it freely wherever
79:37 - you want
79:38 - i know it's a little bit hard to see
79:40 - because mu is also white
79:42 - but i'm just going to place it i'm going
79:45 - to place it
79:47 - right about here i'm thinking i might
79:50 - change that
79:51 - but we'll replace it here okay now the
79:54 - way that i go about
79:55 - figuring out where to create new
79:58 - vertices
80:00 - is that i just kind of follow the curves
80:02 - of the body so if things start to curve
80:05 - i add new vertices so i'm going to show
80:07 - you what that looks like
80:08 - so first i'm actually going to set this
80:10 - at the very base of mu
80:12 - i'm not going to include mu's legs in
80:14 - there um
80:15 - so to oh and
80:18 - before we even can manipulate vertices
80:21 - we have to move
80:22 - into edit mode okay so with your plane
80:25 - selected you're gonna hit tab
80:29 - and that puts us into edit mode now if
80:31 - you hit tab and nothing happens
80:33 - a reason why is because it may not have
80:35 - the plane selected
80:37 - so if i hit tab right now i'm hitting it
80:40 - nothing's happening
80:41 - it's because the plane isn't selected so
80:43 - you have to have an object selected so
80:44 - that blender knows what you're trying to
80:46 - edit
80:47 - okay so we're going to hit the plane and
80:49 - then we're going to hit tab
80:50 - and that puts us into edit mode and you
80:52 - know you're in edit mode again because
80:54 - you'll see it up here
80:55 - but also all of the kind of vertices
80:57 - will become more visible
80:58 - in the object all right so
81:02 - the way that i do this again is i just
81:04 - follow the curves
81:05 - of the body and i manipulate the
81:07 - vertices
81:08 - that way so i'm going to start with this
81:11 - bottom one here i'm just going to drag
81:14 - and drop and i'm going to hit g
81:17 - and i'm just going to move it right
81:19 - about here
81:22 - and i'm going to click off and i'm going
81:23 - to do the same over here
81:27 - i'm just gonna move this maybe like
81:29 - right here
81:30 - i'm just gonna adjust this one too let's
81:32 - put it like right at the base
81:35 - okay and i'm gonna grab this top one
81:38 - and i'm gonna move it i'm gonna go
81:41 - pretty wide
81:42 - on this one because why not then i'm
81:44 - just gonna drop it
81:46 - and i'm gonna drag and i'm gonna grab
81:49 - with g and then i'm going to
81:53 - drop it okay so this is our very very
81:57 - bottom
81:57 - now we want to add more vertices and
82:00 - again there's a lot of different ways
82:01 - that you can do this but the way that i
82:03 - do it is through
82:04 - extruding so i'll show you what that
82:06 - looks like
82:07 - the way that we're going to extrude by
82:09 - first we're going to grab
82:11 - these top two vertices
82:14 - and then we're just going to hit e and
82:17 - that's what's going to allow us to
82:19 - extrude up
82:21 - you can really extrude any way that you
82:22 - want but we're going to go up because we
82:24 - are working on mu's body upwards
82:26 - so then we're just going to click to
82:28 - drop it i'm going to click again just to
82:31 - make sure i'm not holding on to any
82:32 - vertices
82:33 - then i'm going to do the same thing that
82:34 - i just did i'm just going to grab this
82:35 - left one
82:36 - gonna hit g to grab i'm gonna move it to
82:39 - align it with mu's body
82:41 - and click off and i'm gonna drag over
82:44 - this one
82:45 - hit g to grab i'm gonna move this
82:47 - vertice
82:49 - and then we're gonna do the same thing
82:51 - so we're just gonna drag
82:53 - we're gonna hit e to extrude and we're
82:55 - gonna go on up
82:58 - and click off to place it click again to
83:01 - make sure you're not holding any
83:02 - vertices
83:03 - you're gonna drag drop hit g
83:08 - and set this one to right about here
83:09 - maybe
83:11 - and do this again g to grab
83:15 - and move okay we're going to repeat this
83:18 - same process
83:20 - over and over until we get up back so
83:22 - i'm going to set this one
83:23 - maybe like right about here kind of
83:25 - where that curve
83:26 - starts to like taper another way
83:30 - again i'm going to drag grab place drag
83:35 - grab place
83:38 - do this again e to extrude
83:41 - put this right about here
83:45 - why not drag grab
83:48 - please drag grab
83:53 - place all right we're going to do that
83:56 - again
83:57 - i like two more times so i hit e to
84:00 - extrude
84:02 - i'll put it right about here
84:05 - i'm going to drag grab
84:09 - place drag grab
84:13 - place and do it one more time
84:16 - click shoot maybe right about here
84:20 - and then drag grab place
84:24 - drag grab place
84:27 - okay so i'm just gonna fix that
84:30 - firstly really quick okay so i'm gonna
84:33 - bring us back into solid mode just so
84:35 - you can see what this looks like so i'm
84:36 - gonna hit z
84:38 - i'm gonna go over here to solid just so
84:40 - you can see it filled in and then if i
84:42 - turn
84:43 - oop sorry i know that this looks like a
84:46 - lot
84:47 - just because our i'm gonna actually
84:49 - really quickly i'm gonna
84:51 - move this one i'm gonna move our left
84:55 - kind of reference back so that it
84:58 - doesn't get in the way when we do turn
85:00 - so i'm going to tab really quickly back
85:01 - to edit mode i'm going to grab
85:04 - our left reference here and i'm just
85:05 - going to rotate a little bit to see
85:07 - which
85:07 - uh which axis i want to move it back on
85:10 - so i want to move it back on this red
85:11 - axis here
85:12 - so that is the x so i'm just going to
85:14 - hit g to grab
85:16 - and then hit x and just
85:19 - move it out the way of this front view
85:21 - so it was about right here kind of
85:23 - blocking you
85:23 - so i'm just going to move it back that
85:25 - way it doesn't get in our way all right
85:26 - i'm gonna put us back
85:28 - in that right view and it wasn't hard to
85:32 - see
85:32 - right now but our
85:35 - model is still in front of that right
85:39 - whoops
85:40 - actually sorry i just realized we didn't
85:42 - do that but that's okay
85:44 - we'll we'll come back we're ready to
85:45 - move it because i don't want us to do
85:47 - too much at once so
85:48 - right now i'm gonna put us back
85:51 - in our front and our right we're going
85:54 - to hit
85:54 - tab to go back to edit whoops first i'm
85:58 - going to click the model so it knows
85:59 - where we're editing
86:01 - and we're going to hit tab to go back to
86:02 - edit and i just wanted to rotate it just
86:05 - so you can see what this is looking like
86:06 - so far
86:07 - so it looks like nothing kind of
86:10 - we have a front body outline but right
86:13 - now it's just that flat plane because
86:14 - that's what i picked because i didn't
86:16 - want the back vertices
86:17 - to kind of get away
86:21 - but now we do want muse body to be 3d i
86:23 - mean that's why we are in 3d why we are
86:25 - in blender today
86:26 - so i'm going to show you how to make it
86:28 - then 3d so what we're going to do
86:30 - i'm going to tap back just so we're in
86:32 - front view and it doesn't
86:34 - have to look at too much stuff all at
86:35 - once i'm going to
86:37 - grab all of these vertices
86:40 - just like this and i'm going to
86:46 - kind of turn it a little just because i
86:47 - want you to be able to see this all
86:49 - right
86:49 - actually i can do it in right view see
86:51 - that's why we split
86:53 - our views so we can see these things so
86:54 - i'm going to put this back in front just
86:56 - so you can see it in real time
86:57 - so i'm going to grab all these vertices
87:01 - and what i'm going to do is i'm going to
87:02 - hit e to extrude
87:06 - and now when we're in our right side so
87:08 - i want you to
87:09 - look at this right panel here if we want
87:12 - to move to the right
87:13 - we have to use the y-axis okay so on
87:16 - this extrude i'm going to extrude on the
87:18 - y so i'm going to hit e
87:21 - and i'm going to hit y and it's just
87:23 - going to bring
87:24 - all of these vertices back so now
87:29 - we have a bit of a body now it's very
87:32 - square
87:33 - but that's okay now
87:36 - kind of a cheat code that i want to show
87:39 - everyone that is going to help when
87:42 - you're modeling
87:43 - anything bilateral so anything like
87:46 - humans animals anything that's
87:48 - kind of mirrored from one side to the
87:50 - other there's actually
87:51 - a mirror it's called a modifier in
87:54 - blender that will
87:55 - help you kind of model the same thing on
87:57 - each side
87:58 - which is really useful for body stuff
88:01 - really useful really again
88:02 - for anything that's bilateral so that
88:04 - you don't have to make changes
88:06 - on both sides as you change one side
88:09 - it'll make
88:10 - a change on another side so i'm going to
88:11 - show you how to do that so again we have
88:14 - our body here what we are going to do
88:18 - is i'm going to click off that i'm going
88:20 - to come over here to our tools panel
88:22 - which i know we haven't talked about yet
88:24 - there's a lot of really useful tools
88:26 - here but i don't want to confuse
88:27 - everyone so
88:28 - today we're only going to really focus
88:30 - on
88:32 - this tool right here called a loop cut
88:34 - and all that loop cut does
88:36 - is that it cuts something all the way
88:38 - around okay so we're gonna
88:40 - and i'll show you what that looks like
88:41 - we're going to click loop cut
88:44 - and we're going to go over our model
88:45 - here and you'll see this line form
88:48 - and there's different ways that we can
88:49 - cut it if i want to cut it around
88:51 - vertically i can do that or horizontally
88:55 - i can do that if i want to cut it
88:56 - vertically
88:57 - i'll set it here and we're going to cut
88:59 - it vertically
89:00 - so that we can mirror one side on the
89:03 - other
89:03 - okay so to do that to lay your loop cut
89:06 - all you have to do
89:06 - is left click now let's say i don't want
89:09 - to write in the middle for whatever
89:10 - reason
89:11 - you can drag it as well i don't want
89:14 - that
89:15 - i do want it right in the middle so i'm
89:16 - just going to click left click right
89:18 - where it is
89:19 - and then hit and then we'll just go back
89:22 - to our just go back to your selection
89:26 - okay so now we should have a cut
89:29 - going right down the middle of mu's body
89:32 - okay so what we're going to do now
89:36 - is going to hit b to go back into
89:38 - wireframe
89:41 - and then we are going to drag everything
89:44 - on the left side of mu's body all those
89:46 - vertices
89:47 - but not the middle ones you want to
89:48 - leave the middle ones alone you just
89:50 - want to grab all the vertices on the
89:51 - left
89:52 - side and we're going to hit x
89:55 - and it's going to bring up our delete
89:57 - panel and we're just going to hit
89:58 - vertices
90:00 - okay so that left side should be gone
90:02 - now which probably is like oh my gosh
90:03 - what's happening i'm scared
90:04 - don't worry it's gonna be great it's
90:07 - gone
90:10 - we're now gonna grab the right side of
90:13 - mu's body make sure you grab
90:15 - make sure you're in wireframe so that
90:16 - you can grab everything including those
90:18 - back vertices we're going to come to
90:20 - this panel over here on the right side
90:23 - we're going to hit this wrench looking
90:24 - thing which is the modifier tab
90:27 - and then and let me move my zoom screen
90:29 - a little bit a little bit in the way
90:31 - you can't see we're going to go to add
90:33 - modifier
90:34 - it's going to bring up a million
90:36 - different things that you can do in
90:37 - blender this is one of the areas where
90:39 - you should definitely explore there's
90:40 - some really really cool things that you
90:42 - can do
90:43 - but for right now all we need is the
90:45 - mirror modifier
90:46 - which is going to be under generate so
90:48 - come down here and
90:50 - hit mirror and bam now
90:53 - mu's body is back on the other side so
90:56 - as
90:56 - i change one thing so if i take this one
90:59 - and i move it
91:00 - it's going to happen on the other side
91:02 - as well okay so as we're trying to get
91:03 - that body perfect
91:04 - now we only have to worry about one side
91:07 - and the other side the mirror modifier
91:08 - will do the rest of the leg work
91:10 - so i'm just curious so that wasn't
91:13 - entirely
91:15 - necessary because we had vertices for
91:17 - the other side
91:18 - but because we were doing it manually it
91:21 - wasn't necessarily like perfectly
91:22 - symmetrical
91:23 - so now by like deleting it mirroring it
91:25 - it's like it's kind of like a cleanup
91:26 - step
91:27 - yeah it's definitely not necessary it's
91:30 - just if you want to keep things perfect
91:32 - which i don't always do this honestly i
91:35 - will usually go in and adjust
91:36 - every single vertice one by one by hand
91:39 - it's
91:39 - totally not necessary so if you want to
91:42 - just have like a quicker way to do that
91:44 - um if you wanted to just model half of
91:46 - it
91:47 - this is the mirror modifier is a really
91:49 - great way to make sure you don't have to
91:50 - do
91:51 - as much work as you would if you do it
91:53 - manually
91:55 - okay so now that we have our mirror
91:57 - modifier on there
91:59 - i just want to note that once you delete
92:01 - that you know
92:02 - i can't manipulate the left side on my
92:06 - own now
92:07 - just whatever happens on the right side
92:08 - is what's going to get kind of moved
92:10 - to the left side okay so just keep that
92:12 - in mind that if you're like i can't grab
92:14 - anything on the left side
92:15 - it's because it's being mirrored so we
92:17 - can only manipulate things on the right
92:18 - side now
92:20 - okay so what we're gonna do
92:24 - is we're gonna start to i think make
92:26 - this body a little bit more realistic
92:29 - now what i also want to keep in mind or
92:31 - just note when it comes to 3d work
92:34 - is that when you are rendering things
92:36 - you don't want to do
92:38 - every single detail in one view
92:41 - because once you move to another view
92:44 - what's it's going to get kind of
92:46 - manipulated and change so you want to
92:48 - capture
92:49 - the shapes of things in these kind of
92:52 - initial stages so
92:53 - just like how we did we captured the
92:55 - shape of the body but i don't want to go
92:56 - in and like add the arms and then like
92:59 - make sure his body is completely like
93:01 - perfect because once i start to model
93:03 - from like the back
93:04 - or model on the side that's going to get
93:06 - changed
93:07 - a lot so make sure you're capturing the
93:10 - shape but don't do
93:11 - every single detail just yet because
93:13 - it's going to get kind of like
93:15 - manipulated kind of later on okay so
93:19 - right now we have like this really
93:21 - square
93:22 - kind of thing going on it's not really
93:25 - that cute
93:26 - and mu as we know is like more rounded
93:29 - so we're going to do first i'm going to
93:30 - take us back into solid mode by hitting
93:33 - z
93:34 - and then going solid just so we can see
93:36 - and
93:37 - like i said earlier the way to get
93:39 - things more realistic the way to get
93:41 - things rounder
93:42 - is by adding in more vertices so that's
93:44 - what i'm going to do now
93:46 - with another loop cut so i'm going to go
93:49 - over here to the panel
93:50 - i'm going to click loop cut and i'm
93:52 - thinking i'm going to cut it
93:55 - in the middle here and then i'm just
93:58 - going to hit
93:59 - click to land it and i'm going to go
94:01 - back here
94:02 - and what i'm going to do is
94:06 - i'm going to scale this a little bit so
94:08 - i'm going to hit s
94:11 - whoops and i'm going to scale it on
94:15 - actually i don't like how that's
94:17 - happening
94:18 - i'm going to let's see
94:25 - hmm okay so instead of doing that i
94:28 - think what i'm going to do instead
94:30 - is i'm going to actually take this front
94:31 - part and i'm just going to kind of like
94:34 - shift it a little bit to the front so
94:36 - that it is like
94:37 - creating a more rounder effect so to do
94:40 - that i'm going to click
94:42 - these vertices here now what you're
94:44 - going to notice that as you click
94:45 - vertices
94:46 - you're going to like lose the other one
94:47 - so if you want to grab multiple
94:49 - you'll left click and then hold down
94:50 - shift
94:52 - so i'm just going to grab this front
94:54 - line here
94:57 - i think and then i'm thinking
95:01 - i'm just going to hit grab i'm just
95:02 - going to kind of like
95:04 - move it in a bit oops
95:10 - sorry my computer is freezing sorry
95:15 - my computer's a little bit old and
95:18 - actually i'm going to go back to
95:19 - wireframe just so i can see
95:22 - i just want to make sure i'm not
95:23 - grabbing anything i don't need to grab
95:28 - so that looks fine i'm gonna go back to
95:30 - solid
95:32 - and it's gonna
95:36 - i like that extra point here for some
95:39 - reason
95:41 - so let's go to wireframe and grab i'm
95:44 - just going to circle select
95:46 - these
95:49 - and hopefully i'm going to unselect
95:54 - these by grabbing oh
95:58 - oh boy how did you circle select again
96:01 - what's the
96:02 - looks like you just hit c c okay got it
96:05 - you get bigger or smaller by um
96:08 - two fingers just dragging up and down so
96:10 - if i want to make
96:11 - this pretty small
96:15 - oh okay and then i'm going to
96:19 - i'm going to drag here and then you hit
96:21 - enter to get rid of the crosshair
96:24 - but like i don't want these so i'm going
96:26 - to click
96:28 - okay and let's see if that'll
96:32 - there we go okay so i'm just kind of
96:34 - like pulling it in
96:36 - just a little to get like that initial
96:38 - like
96:40 - roundness it's not round yet because
96:42 - we're gonna have to add more vertices
96:43 - but i'm just kind of pulling it in
96:46 - just to have it be a little less square
96:49 - you know it's very very square right now
96:51 - and that's not really what we want so
96:52 - i'm going to do the same
96:54 - on this side i'm just holding shift
96:57 - to grab multiple vertices at once i'm
97:00 - going to grab all these
97:03 - and then again i'm just gonna hit grab
97:06 - just kind of just push it in a little
97:08 - bit
97:09 - and we have just like some roundness
97:12 - again it's not gonna be perfect in the
97:13 - beginning but that's okay we don't need
97:15 - it to be perfect in the beginning
97:16 - we just want to try to begin to capture
97:18 - the shape now something i want to note
97:20 - that
97:20 - you might be seeing as you move vertices
97:23 - because of the mirror modifier
97:25 - you're going to start to get gaps kind
97:27 - of here in the
97:28 - kind of center where it was split don't
97:31 - worry about that though we can merge
97:33 - them back together
97:34 - in the end so if you're noticing like
97:36 - splits it's not a mistake
97:38 - it's just kind of like an effect of the
97:40 - mirror modifier
97:43 - okay so it's looking a little funky
97:47 - right now but again that's okay we don't
97:50 - want to
97:50 - add in all the details and have it be
97:52 - super perfect
97:53 - just yet because we need to add in like
97:56 - the head we need to add in the feet and
97:57 - that's going to
97:58 - require like us to keep it basic so that
98:01 - when we attach things
98:03 - things don't get too funky okay so
98:06 - what i want to do is first i just
98:09 - noticed that
98:10 - over here on our right side our model
98:13 - isn't aligned on the right so let's just
98:14 - first
98:15 - move that really quick okay so we can
98:18 - actually move it in edit mode we don't
98:20 - have to go back to object to move it
98:22 - i'm just going to go to wireframe just
98:24 - to make sure that i'm grabbing all of it
98:27 - and then i'm going to hit g and then i'm
98:30 - gonna hit
98:31 - y and then i'm just gonna
98:35 - move it in front again it's not perfect
98:38 - right now
98:38 - we're gonna have to like we're probably
98:40 - gonna have to rotate it
98:41 - because mu's body's got to rotate uh
98:44 - we're gonna have to like re-manipulate
98:46 - stuff
98:46 - but that's okay we just want to know
98:48 - where we're at right now
98:50 - so before i do any more
98:54 - kind of like body work again i don't
98:56 - like to get too detailed
98:58 - in the beginning because we have to
99:00 - attach
99:01 - other things so i want us to move to the
99:04 - head
99:05 - so to do that we there's multiple ways
99:08 - we can do this but for me in order to
99:10 - stay
99:10 - kind of like clean or to keep my
99:13 - viewport clean
99:15 - i'll usually kind of hide objects and i
99:17 - i like to model separately
99:19 - you can model different parts all
99:21 - together so if i wanted to take
99:23 - this top part and like grab these faces
99:26 - so i can do a face select i can grab
99:29 - these
99:30 - and i can like extrude and i can start
99:32 - to do the neck of the head
99:34 - i don't like to do that because it can
99:36 - get really like
99:37 - and get really finicky in there and it's
99:39 - just it never really goes
99:41 - super smooth for me when i do that so
99:43 - instead i like to create a whole new
99:46 - object okay so what i'm going to do
99:49 - is i'm going to hit tab to go back into
99:52 - object mode because we want to add a new
99:55 - object
99:57 - okay and what i'm going to do is i'm
99:58 - going to hide
100:00 - the body so to do that up here
100:03 - in the top right corner you'll see steam
100:05 - collection and that has
100:07 - everything that we've put in our scene
100:09 - listed and you can use these little eyes
100:11 - to show or to hide them so
100:14 - uh the plane here or whatever shape you
100:17 - use
100:18 - if you use a sphere it'll say sphere if
100:19 - you use a cube and say cube
100:21 - is going to be our body and we can if
100:23 - you want to rename it just so you can
100:24 - keep track
100:25 - you can double click it and just go
100:27 - ahead and name it body
100:28 - or whatever you want to name it and then
100:31 - i'm going to go ahead and just
100:32 - hide it that way we don't have to worry
100:35 - about it as we do
100:36 - our head okay so
100:39 - to do our head we're going to do
100:43 - kind of same exact thing that we did for
100:45 - the body so we're just going to start
100:47 - by hitting shift a to add in whatever
100:51 - shape you want to use
100:52 - to make the head i'm going to use a
100:55 - plane again
100:55 - just because what i like it's going to
100:58 - put that plane in there but again it
101:00 - puts it flat
101:01 - so when we want to turn it we're just
101:03 - going to hit r to rotate
101:05 - we're going to hit x and then we're
101:07 - going to hit 90
101:08 - and then we're going to hit enter okay
101:11 - and then we'll hit
101:12 - v if you want to see it wireframe
101:16 - and then we can hit s to go ahead and
101:19 - scale it down and i'm gonna place it i'm
101:22 - gonna hit g
101:24 - and i'm just gonna place it kind of
101:26 - arbitrarily
101:27 - in front of him now before i start
101:30 - moving
101:30 - dan i notice we're at 12 40.
101:35 - and we're not super far in the model but
101:38 - i just want to
101:39 - see how we're feeling time wise
101:43 - how much i don't know
101:46 - i think so i mean i don't have a
101:50 - super strong opinion i'm happy to go for
101:52 - longer the audience seems to be enjoying
101:54 - this
101:54 - i think maybe though it might be good
101:55 - what we could try to do is just get
101:58 - um like a basic version of the head
102:00 - which is kind of
102:02 - similar to what you did with the body we
102:03 - can move quickly through that okay and
102:05 - then
102:06 - and then i think the most important
102:07 - thing is for people then to learn how to
102:10 - like
102:11 - save and even like share it in a way
102:15 - because then
102:15 - um what i would love if for people
102:17 - watching i'm going to do this myself
102:19 - if you work on your mew or whatever
102:21 - model you're making
102:22 - throughout the day or the weekend maybe
102:24 - there's a way we can just share it with
102:26 - each other on social media i mean that
102:27 - could just be a screenshot
102:28 - but even if there's a way to like export
102:30 - um export directly from blender
102:33 - like something i wonder if there's a way
102:36 - i know we're not covering animation but
102:37 - is there a way to like make like
102:39 - really quickly export just like a your
102:41 - model spinning around
102:43 - video but that's like a complicated
102:45 - thing
102:46 - yes there is i mean there's definitely a
102:49 - way to do it
102:50 - as far as is it simple yeah well maybe
102:53 - just an image just an image of the model
102:55 - yeah i can definitely show how to
102:57 - because i've already completed a muse so
102:59 - i can
102:59 - pull to show how to right right we can
103:02 - look at that and then also like
103:03 - even if just export as to like obj or
103:05 - whatever the
103:06 - yeah what file format is because one of
103:08 - the things that i and
103:10 - next time i live stream is try to import
103:12 - it into processing or p5 and see how
103:14 - that goes
103:14 - right for sure okay cool yeah let's do
103:17 - that and i definitely want to make sure
103:18 - that we have time for like questions
103:20 - right right here there are questions
103:23 - yeah so let's move towards wrapping up
103:24 - we can add the head
103:26 - and then we will have like a mewtwo is
103:28 - just like
103:29 - body and head and exercise for the
103:30 - viewer is
103:32 - try to add the feet and i guess the tail
103:35 - would be
103:35 - is like a really high degree of
103:36 - difficulty but try now that would be
103:38 - cool
103:39 - the tail i actually really this was
103:41 - actually the first time i ever modeled
103:42 - the tail and i actually really enjoyed
103:43 - doing the tails
103:44 - the thing that gave me the most trouble
103:46 - is like actually these little arms
103:47 - like they're just so small right
103:50 - harmless an armless mew
103:52 - is okay i think so honestly
103:55 - okay so let's get the head so again
103:57 - we're gonna do
103:58 - the head the same exact way that we did
104:01 - the body so we're gonna start just by
104:04 - grabbing it with g
104:06 - we're going to move it to the base here
104:09 - and then we're going to hit tab to go
104:11 - into edit mode
104:13 - and then we're just going to start
104:14 - manipulating the vertices alright so
104:16 - we're going to drag
104:17 - and grab with g move it
104:21 - i'm going to put it i want to make sure
104:23 - i capture the nose
104:25 - so i'm going to put it all right about
104:27 - here it's going to drag
104:29 - grab drag
104:34 - and i'll put it right about here for now
104:37 - drag
104:39 - grab and then we'll take these top two
104:44 - and we're gonna extrude with e
104:48 - okay and then we're going to drag and
104:50 - grab
104:52 - i might actually lower this i might
104:54 - adjust this later but that's okay this
104:55 - is good for now
104:57 - g to grab again
105:01 - and then we are going to drag again and
105:04 - then hit e to extrude
105:08 - g to grab g
105:11 - to grab
105:15 - and what i want to note so mu has ears
105:17 - and eyes
105:18 - as you can see but these are things that
105:20 - we want to add after
105:22 - we kind of get the base of the head so
105:25 - as you're extruding
105:26 - up and trying to capture you know mu
105:28 - shape
105:29 - i'm gonna actually move these down um
105:31 - don't worry about the eyes
105:32 - and don't worry about the ears just yet
105:35 - we'll add those in
105:37 - a little bit later
105:40 - i'm just gonna move these down just
105:42 - wanna capture more of his
105:44 - curves all right we're going to do the
105:46 - same thing
105:47 - and go ahead and hit e i'm going to do
105:50 - it like right at the base of the ear
105:51 - there i think
105:54 - g to grab g2 grab
105:58 - do this again
106:01 - and right about there
106:04 - g to grab
106:08 - g to grab
106:11 - i'll probably do this like two more
106:13 - times we're going to hit e to extrude
106:14 - again
106:18 - g to grab
106:21 - g to grab
106:25 - extrude one more time
106:29 - and then g to grab place it right about
106:32 - there
106:33 - and g to grab
106:37 - right about there okay so
106:41 - if we go to solid view this is what it
106:43 - looks like
106:45 - it captures the head pretty well i mean
106:46 - there are some gaps kind of down here
106:48 - that we can fix later on when we do more
106:51 - detail or if you want to add it in now
106:52 - you can
106:54 - um it's not something you really have to
106:55 - worry about right now we just kind of
106:56 - have that basic geometry of the head
107:00 - and uh what we're gonna do
107:03 - is we're gonna extrude it
107:06 - okay so we are going to
107:09 - grab all of the vertices here
107:13 - and i just noticed i keep accidentally
107:15 - moving it on the right so don't be like
107:17 - me
107:17 - like i said i tend to kind of focus on
107:20 - one viewport but if you want to make
107:22 - sure that you are using both of your
107:24 - ports just you just want to make sure
107:25 - that this model
107:27 - is in front here you don't necessarily
107:29 - need it just yet because we're not
107:30 - modeling
107:31 - um we're not kind of like getting the
107:34 - details of his side profile yet but if
107:36 - you want to
107:37 - move this right in front we'll
107:40 - go over here and we'll hit g and then
107:42 - we'll hit y
107:44 - just like move the head back
107:47 - actually i'm going to move it i'm gonna
107:49 - move it like right about here
107:51 - so that when i extrude it back i can see
107:54 - how long i want his head to be
107:56 - okay so we have all our vertices
107:58 - selected we're just gonna hit
107:59 - e and now again we're gonna want to
108:02 - extrude to the right
108:03 - so if we're in this left panel to go
108:05 - right if we look up a little compass
108:07 - here
108:07 - we're going to use the y axis okay so
108:10 - we're going to hit e to extrude
108:12 - then hit y and then we're just going to
108:15 - bring that bad boy all the way back
108:18 - to maybe right about here because his
108:19 - head is a little long
108:21 - and then we'll just hit left click just
108:24 - to set it
108:25 - okay so if we turn as you can see we
108:28 - have his long
108:29 - mushroom looking head right now which is
108:32 - great
108:33 - and again the key to making things more
108:36 - realistic
108:37 - is to add more vertices just a standard
108:39 - practice
108:40 - i like to loop cut a couple of times on
108:43 - the body i just did one
108:45 - just so i could show you but with this
108:46 - head i think i'm going to loop cut it
108:49 - a couple of times so i'm going to
108:52 - come back into the front view here i'm
108:55 - going to go over to our panel here
108:56 - go back to loop cut now when you think
109:00 - about your
109:01 - face you know it's like this rounded
109:04 - thing
109:04 - right so there's like a cut like if i
109:07 - cut right down here that will get like
109:09 - the mirroring
109:09 - for both my eyes but i also want to
109:11 - capture like you know this rounded part
109:13 - here and this rounded part here and
109:15 - that's kind of what i think about what
109:16 - i'm doing like a body or a head i'm
109:18 - trying to figure out how to cut it
109:19 - i'm trying to think of like how round i
109:22 - want it to be
109:23 - so because i want to capture the full
109:25 - roundness of his head
109:26 - and i'm going to loop cut it maybe three
109:28 - times we'll see
109:30 - so i'm going to hit this loop cut button
109:33 - and i'm going to click right down the
109:35 - middle
109:36 - and then i want to loop cutting i'm
109:38 - going to loop cut it again why not
109:41 - and then i'm going to loop cut it again
109:43 - over on the right side
109:45 - and i also so remember we're not just
109:47 - modeling in one view
109:49 - right we want to make sure that it's
109:51 - looking good on every angle so i'm also
109:54 - just so we can see it solid i'm gonna
109:55 - bring it back to solid mode i'm gonna
109:57 - loop cut it
109:58 - at least once here i'm probably gonna
110:01 - end up cutting it more
110:02 - but just for now i'm just gonna loop cut
110:04 - it here
110:05 - and i'm just gonna go back to my mouse
110:07 - now you have the option again of doing
110:09 - the mirror modifier
110:10 - if you want to make sure that your head
110:13 - is like completely symmetrical on both
110:15 - sides
110:15 - if you want to do the mirror modifier
110:17 - again all you have to do is hit
110:19 - z to go to wireframe you're just going
110:22 - to pick whichever size
110:23 - that you want to get rid of so if you
110:25 - want to get rid of the left side
110:27 - you'll grab all the vertices on the left
110:30 - just make sure you don't grab that
110:31 - middle
110:32 - kind of partition and then you'll just
110:34 - delete it
110:35 - by pressing x and then vertices
110:39 - and then to add in the mirror we're
110:41 - going to grab everything on the right
110:44 - and then we're going to go to our panel
110:46 - here we'll go back to this wrench
110:47 - looking thing which is the
110:49 - modifier tab we'll go to add modifier
110:52 - and then we'll hit mirror and now it's
110:55 - on
110:56 - both sides and now again you might have
110:58 - some splitting going on
111:00 - uh don't worry about it if you don't
111:02 - like the splitting or if it's making you
111:04 - nervous
111:05 - you also have the option of just not
111:06 - using the mirror modifier which is
111:08 - totally fine and
111:09 - i guess i can i'll show that here
111:12 - with the head just so we can get an idea
111:15 - of like what it's like
111:16 - to not use the mirror modifier i mean
111:18 - it's really just
111:19 - more kind of manually manipulation so
111:23 - okay so from here we have our head
111:26 - again it's looking very boxy so i'm
111:28 - gonna actually come to
111:30 - our right panel now so i can start to
111:34 - move things to match the shape of mu's
111:37 - head
111:38 - so on our left side i'm going to hit z
111:41 - and hit
111:41 - wireframe so i can see where all the
111:44 - points are
111:46 - okay and again i just want to start to
111:48 - kind of match things
111:50 - really to the shape of his head okay so
111:52 - i'm going to start
111:53 - by dragging and selecting and again you
111:56 - want to make sure you're in wireframe
111:58 - because if you're in solid and you grab
112:00 - something it's only going to grab the
112:01 - very
112:02 - front one so whatever is happening on
112:03 - one side is not going to happen other
112:04 - side so make sure you're in wireframe by
112:06 - hitting z
112:07 - and then wireframe and then we're just
112:09 - going to start to drag some things
112:10 - well we're just going to figure it out
112:12 - all right so we're going to drag this
112:14 - i'm going to drag and drop and then hit
112:16 - g
112:18 - to just kind of move i'm going to take
112:21 - things a little bit slow because there
112:22 - are multiple vertices and it's really
112:24 - easy to like
112:25 - kind of tangle vertices and i don't want
112:27 - to do that
112:29 - so i'm just gonna start by
112:32 - getting these to kind of go where i'm
112:36 - thinking i want them to go and i mind
112:39 - you this might look a little bit
112:40 - different to what you're seeing if you
112:41 - decided to keep the modem
112:43 - the mirror modifier but it's the same
112:45 - kind of concept you're just kind of
112:46 - lining up
112:48 - where you think all of the
112:52 - kind of vertices should go for this side
112:54 - of the head
112:56 - i'm just going to grab it drop it
113:00 - grab this move it up a little
113:03 - i think i want to i'm actually gonna
113:06 - shift
113:08 - all these forward just a little bit and
113:12 - then i'm thinking
113:14 - move this one up and again you don't
113:16 - have to do this the exact way that i'm
113:18 - doing it
113:19 - if you're looking and you're like
113:20 - chrissy this varsity should obviously go
113:22 - over here
113:22 - please definitely do that you want to do
113:25 - it in a way that feels comfortable and
113:26 - feels like
113:28 - whatever makes sense kind of to you so
113:31 - i'm going to put this one
113:32 - here i'm going to quickly move these
113:36 - up so that i don't tangle this one
113:37 - because i want this one
113:40 - to kind of come over here but it's still
113:42 - a little low
113:44 - so i'm going to move all of these up
113:46 - again
113:48 - i'm just going to bring this one in here
113:52 - i'm going to bring this one kind of up
113:53 - here
113:55 - i'm gonna take these and bring them in
114:00 - close it to the head and then let's see
114:03 - let's take this one down now remember
114:07 - we don't have ears yet and the ears are
114:09 - kind of blocking part of the head
114:11 - so you just want to kind of assume where
114:13 - his like
114:14 - headlines i guess would fall so i'm
114:17 - going to take
114:19 - this one and put it here i'm gonna take
114:22 - this one
114:23 - just kind of put it whoops i didn't mean
114:25 - to grab all those
114:26 - i just want to grab this one kind of
114:29 - place it here
114:32 - i'm gonna bring this one just a little
114:34 - bit back
114:36 - i'm gonna bring this one here
114:41 - i'm gonna bring this one
114:44 - maybe like right about there
114:48 - we can make some adjustments
114:52 - and now again as you can see like
114:54 - there's like gaps
114:56 - that the vertices can't quite cover
114:58 - because we don't yet have enough
115:00 - but that is also something that we can
115:02 - kind of fix later on
115:04 - okay so we just moved things around you
115:06 - may have seen things kind of happen in
115:08 - the front view but i'm going to change
115:09 - this to solid just so you can see it so
115:11 - it's looking pretty good it looks like
115:13 - his head i'm going to view but as you
115:15 - can see it's pretty wide
115:17 - so we're gonna have to fix that but
115:18 - that's okay but we're starting to kind
115:20 - of capture
115:22 - what his head like the shape of the head
115:25 - from both the front
115:27 - so if we take this back to solid you see
115:29 - it's still capturing
115:31 - what it looks like in the front and if
115:32 - we change this one to wireframe as well
115:34 - it's all kind of captured on the side as
115:36 - well of course we're having some
115:38 - proportion issues but that's okay
115:41 - because right now we're just trying to
115:42 - get
115:42 - shape all right now from here
115:47 - i want to have it to where we have
115:50 - something that at least
115:52 - looks decent before we go so
115:56 - let's let's do like a little bit of
115:59 - detail work on the head
116:01 - again i usually don't try to do too too
116:04 - much
116:04 - because in order to connect the head
116:08 - and the body you kind of want the
116:13 - you don't want the mesh to be too
116:16 - unbalanced when it comes to vertices so
116:18 - if i have like a hundred vertices on the
116:21 - head
116:21 - but then i only have like 20 vertices on
116:23 - the body
116:24 - connecting it might get like a little
116:26 - bit funky
116:27 - but for the sake of just like getting us
116:30 - familiar with
116:31 - modeling and like kind of making pushing
116:33 - things around
116:35 - to make it look like what we're trying
116:36 - to model i'm gonna go ahead and do just
116:38 - a little bit of detail work
116:39 - to get this head looking a little bit
116:41 - better
116:43 - okay so from here this is definitely an
116:46 - area where i encourage you to
116:49 - go off the rails move things
116:52 - as you feel they should be moved i'm
116:54 - gonna make adjustments
116:55 - and i'll try to talk through what i'm
116:57 - doing but honestly
116:59 - it's going to look a little bit sporadic
117:00 - because that's kind of the way that i
117:02 - model
117:02 - i just kind of like try things and then
117:05 - see how it looks
117:06 - delete it if it doesn't look so good try
117:08 - other things but this is definitely
117:10 - the area where you just kind of want to
117:11 - freeform and like experiment and see
117:14 - what's working and kind of not working
117:16 - okay so for me
117:17 - as i'm looking at this head it's just
117:20 - looking like
117:22 - it just looks very alien it's looking
117:24 - kind of wide
117:26 - it's not really like as round as i would
117:29 - want it to be
117:31 - so what i'm thinking is
117:34 - now mind you i don't have the mirror
117:35 - modifier on so i have to keep in mind
117:37 - that whatever
117:38 - i do on one side i'm gonna have to do on
117:40 - the left side
117:41 - if you decide to keep the mirror
117:42 - modifier you're a little bit in luck
117:44 - because as you adjust one side it's just
117:45 - gonna automatically do that for you
117:48 - so let's see again i'm looking at this
117:50 - head
117:52 - it's looking a little funky and it's
117:55 - looking a little flat
117:57 - so i think first i'm going to try to
117:59 - kind of round out the front
118:01 - now something i haven't shown just yet
118:04 - is that so far we've been manipulating
118:06 - vertices and i think i talked about this
118:08 - just for a second but if you want to
118:11 - manipulate
118:12 - whole faces or edges you have the option
118:14 - to do that as well so
118:16 - if you come up here and you look right
118:18 - next to our edit tab
118:20 - we have these three different boxes here
118:23 - and this tells us which
118:24 - kind of editing mode or selecting mode
118:26 - that we are in
118:28 - so so far we've been in vertex select so
118:30 - if you have this selected you're going
118:31 - to see all the vertex present
118:34 - but if we want to manipulate some edges
118:36 - we can hit edge select
118:38 - and that's going to show us all the
118:39 - edges and let's say we want to
118:41 - manipulate a whole face then we'll click
118:43 - face select
118:44 - and it's also going to then allow us to
118:47 - click faces
118:48 - okay so edges will let us just click the
118:50 - edge
118:52 - and then vertices is going to show you
118:54 - to click those vertices
118:56 - now the benefit of vertex select is that
118:59 - it's going to be the most detailed
119:01 - so if you're trying to get in and like
119:02 - make really small kind of adjustments i
119:05 - would suggest sticking to vertex
119:07 - if you want to make kind of like wide
119:09 - things so usually when i'm trying to
119:10 - like round
119:11 - things out i oftentimes like to come
119:13 - into face select
119:15 - and i'll just kind of grab like some
119:17 - middle things
119:20 - and again if you want to grab more than
119:21 - one thing just hold down shift
119:24 - and like usually when we're rounding
119:26 - things out like the
119:28 - kind of front of the sphere is a little
119:31 - bit further
119:32 - than the rest so i'm just gonna grab
119:35 - this i'm gonna hit y and i'm just gonna
119:39 - bring it forward a little bit just kind
119:41 - of round
119:42 - round that part out okay so we're
119:45 - getting a little bit of roundness here
119:48 - now these um
119:52 - these sides here are giving like they're
119:55 - getting a square
119:56 - they're serving a square right now but
119:57 - we want round
119:59 - again so i'm also just going to like
120:01 - kind of grab these
120:02 - now another trick to grab things kind of
120:05 - more quickly if you know that you want
120:07 - to grab like this whole line you can
120:08 - just hold shift
120:09 - and double click and it's just going to
120:11 - grab everything
120:13 - kind of in that loop and then
120:16 - i'm going to hit grab
120:20 - and now i did something funky
120:24 - with the way that i laid so as you can
120:26 - see
120:28 - it's kind of like pushed in and out and
120:30 - this is something that i will have to
120:31 - fix
120:32 - later if you're getting some of those
120:34 - like funkiness
120:35 - where your mesh is kind of like
120:37 - overlapping
120:38 - the way that you'll want to fix that is
120:41 - just going to hit b
120:42 - in wireframe and now i know this looks a
120:44 - little bit scary
120:45 - but it's just going to show you you just
120:47 - want to like look
120:49 - and just kind of see what is what are
120:51 - the ones that are kind of like inverted
120:53 - so if i get close here if you can see
120:56 - right here oh
120:59 - this point
121:03 - sorry i'm trying to get close in there
121:04 - it's actually not
121:07 - it's this point i'm just kind of looking
121:09 - to see
121:11 - what part is kind of inside of each
121:13 - other also going to like
121:16 - i just switched to edge mode so i can
121:19 - see what the lines are
121:22 - let's see i think
121:25 - this line which i'm having some trouble
121:28 - grabbing
121:30 - is just like a little bit it's kind of
121:33 - going over
121:34 - this other line here so i'm just going
121:35 - to quickly just kind of bring it out
121:40 - so i don't want it to be in the way
121:44 - i'm going to see how that feels and
121:45 - again this is the part where i'm saying
121:47 - it gets really funky and like
121:49 - if you're like chrissy you should do
121:50 - something else like try
121:53 - whatever works for you here because you
121:56 - want to try to get
121:58 - these vertices to not be on top of each
122:00 - other like this
122:02 - like i'm having this like concave like
122:04 - funky thing going on here
122:05 - that is like not what i want at all
122:09 - i'm gonna go back into wireframe just to
122:10 - see
122:13 - what is overlapping
122:16 - i think this one
122:20 - i'm just gonna bring this a little bit
122:22 - in and bring this one
122:25 - a little bit out just see if i can try
122:29 - to like correct
122:32 - some of these things dan how are you
122:35 - doing over there
122:36 - how's yours looking
122:39 - mine's mine's looking kind of
122:41 - interesting
122:44 - i i'm going to bring it up on the screen
122:46 - so people can see really briefly it's
122:47 - not as it's not as beautiful as yours
122:49 - this is i mean looking very very funky
122:52 - right now
122:53 - oops one thing actually that's happened
122:55 - to me um
122:56 - and i i'm going to show this i i
122:58 - actually there is a way that i can
123:00 - have you see what i'm doing by like
123:02 - sending it but
123:03 - back into the zoom meeting but but let
123:04 - me just explain it
123:06 - so when i'm i'm in my um
123:10 - front orthographic view and as soon as i
123:13 - go to
123:14 - rotate it like takes me somewhere like
123:16 - really not rotate as soon as i go to
123:18 - like
123:19 - a spin so that i can look at it from a
123:21 - slightly different angle
123:22 - it takes me to like this weird other
123:24 - place like
123:26 - far far away from the model oh no
123:29 - oh okay i'm showing it to people so
123:32 - maybe
123:32 - maybe somebody if somebody you don't
123:34 - need to answer this for me right now
123:35 - figured out but i'm just showing it if
123:36 - somebody in
123:37 - who's watching the live knows i'm sort
123:39 - of demonstrating it because it doesn't
123:40 - happen for me on my left panel
123:42 - like that works as expected like like
123:45 - where it thinks the center of the world
123:46 - is or something when i start to spit
123:49 - i'm wondering there could be a couple
123:52 - different things going on i think i'd
123:53 - have to see it yeah
123:56 - i can work that out with you later but i
123:58 - think you know i think we're in like a
124:00 - pretty good place like i mean you could
124:01 - probably um i'm i'm moving it back to
124:04 - your screen now work on like the
124:06 - detailing here
124:07 - like forever yeah i mean this is
124:11 - this is the hard part to i guess kind of
124:14 - show because this
124:15 - takes forever like because vertices get
124:17 - lost
124:18 - vertices do things that you did not want
124:20 - it to do and it really takes a lot of
124:22 - just like manipulating
124:24 - for a while so i think i would love i
124:27 - would love to show and walk us through
124:28 - getting through them all because i know
124:30 - probably right now
124:31 - like this looks like nothing i don't
124:32 - know but i do want to
124:34 - show you kind of how to export
124:37 - yeah and also um
124:40 - i can just yeah i said oh
124:43 - maybe i can show maybe i can do
124:45 - something after
124:46 - to walk us through like after like a
124:49 - different live stream or like a video or
124:51 - something i can
124:52 - show kind of better how to detail
124:54 - because trying to do it quickly
124:56 - is kind of what got me into this anyway
124:58 - yeah well i think
124:59 - you know detailing to me also feels like
125:01 - that's like a huge
125:02 - like subject unto itself yeah this is
125:05 - like incredible
125:06 - i mean i was i mean i've never made a
125:08 - model like this before and i was totally
125:10 - able to do it which is kind of
125:11 - unbelievable oh people are answering my
125:13 - question now
125:16 - um so but i do think that's what's
125:18 - really important for us to show
125:20 - is i mean obviously i see in mine like
125:22 - there's like file save
125:24 - yeah so i will show kind of the
125:27 - difference between saving
125:28 - and exporting and also really quickly i
125:31 - think i saved
125:34 - my mew before i connected things
125:37 - so let me see if i can let's see what
125:40 - this looks like
125:43 - oh yeah i'd love to see the um
125:46 - the finished view yeah i think i moved
125:49 - it to a different file
125:53 - sorry you're like seeing my whole
125:56 - desktop right now okay i can switch to
125:58 - mine
125:58 - i'm switch to mine for a second while
126:00 - you're looking so people said i should
126:02 - hit
126:03 - preferences navigation orbit around
126:05 - selection
126:11 - tell me when you're ready i'll switch it
126:12 - back to yours okay
126:15 - let's go maybe your anchor point is not
126:19 - center click shift s cursor to world
126:22 - origin
126:24 - cursor to world origin
126:30 - no
126:38 - oh okay let's see let's try one more
126:41 - right marcos writes and this is exactly
126:44 - how i feel
126:45 - for beginners like myself making two
126:47 - boxes with rounded corners is a victory
126:49 - i totally agree like i got this sort of
126:52 - like lumpy frumpy little like beginnings
126:54 - of a mew
126:55 - and uh bar and i'm just like so excited
126:58 - to
127:00 - see where it goes yay i'm glad i wanted
127:03 - to be able to walk everyone through
127:05 - but it is kind of like a lot
127:08 - for the time that we have but i'll do my
127:10 - best yeah
127:11 - and also you know one thing that that i
127:13 - don't know if anyone asked this but
127:14 - um certainly i'm curious is like where
127:18 - like what are what are you know
127:20 - resources that other people that you
127:22 - found useful as your
127:24 - learning blender like if people want to
127:26 - learn more do more is there
127:28 - uh a book that you looked at a website i
127:31 - mean there's
127:32 - um are there recommendations yeah so
127:35 - first i mean youtube is definitely my
127:37 - best friend
127:38 - um a couple one modeler i can think of
127:42 - off the brain i think his name is olaf
127:45 - 3d
127:47 - hat i think has some good tutorials for
127:50 - modeling but also if you're really
127:51 - interested in animation
127:53 - um i can't think of any more off the
127:56 - head i can
127:57 - try to gather some things after just
127:59 - look through
128:00 - but there if you just um like
128:03 - youtube like uh 3d model humans
128:07 - or yeah 3d model or character modeling
128:11 - or modeling for 3d printing you'll get
128:12 - some really good things also on the
128:14 - blender website
128:15 - they have some references built in as
128:17 - well they have a whole library
128:18 - that you can go through that has some
128:19 - really great like tutorials and tips
128:22 - and um one other thing is like i you
128:24 - know uh
128:25 - coding train regular viewers probably
128:27 - know about this but if you're new here
128:29 - because you came because you want to
128:30 - learn about blender you want to learn
128:31 - more about chrissy's work
128:32 - um we do have a discord so i think if i
128:35 - press this button here
128:36 - the link to the discord is going to go
128:37 - into the chat just did
128:39 - um and so that could also be a place we
128:41 - could create a blender channel in there
128:43 - um you know people could sort of like
128:45 - share resources or ask questions
128:46 - or even if like you know we could share
128:49 - some like model files and different
128:51 - things there as well i mean chrissy
128:52 - you're welcome to try to
128:53 - obligate you to suddenly joining our
128:54 - discord answering everybody's question
128:57 - but if you want to pop in there and like
128:58 - that's also a place where people who
129:00 - want to go further with us could reach
129:01 - out to you
129:02 - for sure um we could
129:06 - we can switch back okay look at that
129:10 - it looks a little funky uh the reason
129:12 - why these are um
129:14 - pink right now is because these are
129:15 - actually the reference photo but i move
129:17 - them
129:18 - off my desktop originally they were on
129:19 - my desktop and then i moved it off my
129:20 - desktop
129:21 - and then i moved it back so the file
129:23 - path just kind of got messed up so i'm
129:24 - just going to hide those
129:25 - we don't have to worry about that okay
129:27 - so this was like
129:29 - kind of a beginning stage for the mew um
129:32 - right now it has the mirror modifier on
129:35 - it
129:35 - on both of these and but it's all um
129:39 - none of these are connected right now so
129:41 - i can just really quickly
129:42 - show you what i would do to first
129:46 - apply the mirror modifier and then kind
129:48 - of sew
129:49 - the head back together in the body and
129:52 - then like connect
129:54 - i i think i'll sure okay hopefully i can
129:57 - do that quick so then i can
129:58 - go all the rendering stuff okay so again
130:01 - right now everything
130:02 - is separate um let's start with maybe
130:06 - sewing the head back together so i'm
130:08 - gonna hide
130:10 - body i'm gonna hide the split on the
130:12 - head
130:14 - all this good stuff okay so we have our
130:15 - head now
130:17 - in order to apply a modifier you have to
130:19 - be in object mode which is what we are
130:21 - in right now
130:22 - and then once you apply it it's
130:24 - basically it just doesn't
130:26 - it's not going to mirror anymore so we
130:28 - are at that point like we have our head
130:30 - it's looking decent we're just going to
130:32 - hit apply
130:34 - so now all of these vertices are their
130:36 - own again so if i do something on the
130:37 - right it's not going to affect the left
130:39 - anymore
130:40 - so to sew this up honestly i'm pretty
130:43 - sure there's a quicker way to do this
130:45 - and like i feel like i've done in the
130:46 - past but i can't remember that way so
130:48 - i'm going to show you the way that i do
130:50 - remember
130:51 - the way that i merge kind of uh vertices
130:54 - together
130:54 - is i'll just click one and i'll click
130:57 - its buddy
130:58 - and i'll hit option m and then at center
131:03 - and i'll just go and be a surgeon
131:07 - and stitch mew right on up
131:11 - so this is what you can do to
131:14 - if that mirror modifier left you with a
131:16 - split you can just sew him
131:19 - right back up by doing this and as i'm
131:22 - doing this i'm realizing that if i'm
131:23 - going to do this for the head and the
131:25 - body we're
131:26 - probably going to take a little minute
131:28 - but i do want to show
131:31 - what it is like to connect so i'm just
131:34 - going to sew these bottom ones really
131:35 - quick
131:37 - and then i'll try to
131:43 - don't want that there's some interesting
131:45 - suggestions in the chat
131:47 - that people are saying also the way that
131:49 - they do this like
131:50 - solar liner writes you don't need to uh
131:54 - there's a merge mode in the mirror
131:56 - modifier that merges vertices and edges
131:58 - that are close to the mirror plane
132:00 - oh sleep and luis says
132:03 - select clipping in the mirror and select
132:06 - the middle vertices move them to center
132:08 - i don't know what that means but it
132:09 - sounds very it sounds like the right
132:11 - idea
132:12 - i already applied this modifier so i
132:14 - have to go back but those sound like
132:16 - really great
132:16 - yeah they sound like really great and
132:18 - simple selections it's the same thing as
132:20 - with coding there's always like in
132:21 - javascript especially there's like 10
132:22 - ways to do the same exact thing so and
132:24 - everybody has their own
132:26 - sort of like tricks and style thank you
132:29 - for putting those suggestions in there
132:31 - because i will that will save me a lot
132:32 - of time
132:34 - um again i did want to show
132:37 - how to do that but i want to make sure
132:39 - that i get in how to render
132:41 - and all that good stuff so i'm going to
132:44 - skip to that i'm so sorry
132:47 - yeah i think that's great okay there's
132:49 - no way that this well first of all
132:50 - there's no way that this single live
132:52 - stream
132:52 - could comprehensively cover everything
132:54 - there is
132:56 - so i think i just want to show
132:58 - everything i want everyone to be able to
132:59 - have their mind
133:00 - but what we what i think what's really
133:02 - amazing that you're doing is just like
133:04 - i wouldn't have even known where to even
133:06 - start i can't believe that i've already
133:08 - made
133:09 - a model and so like obviously there's
133:11 - you know it's
133:12 - what's the like a mile wide an inch deep
133:14 - but i've got that
133:16 - wrong whatever the expression is you
133:18 - know we've got that basic and there's
133:19 - obviously you can go
133:20 - super deep into blender and and a couple
133:23 - people also posted some of their
133:25 - uh youtube channels that they um that
133:27 - they suggest for so one of the things
133:30 - that i can also do
133:31 - is this when this video gets archived
133:34 - the
133:34 - uh it'll be on youtube but i can always
133:36 - add an update to the video description
133:39 - so if there are additional resources or
133:40 - things that we want to add we'll just
133:42 - put that in the video description
133:43 - perfect
133:45 - okay so if you saw like the
133:48 - kind of screenshot or the image of like
133:51 - the final mew that was on
133:53 - like the coding train page or on my page
133:55 - this is what
133:56 - the model was so this is my finished one
133:58 - um again i usually do low poly work i
134:00 - usually keep things actually
134:02 - lower poly than this but i wanted the mu
134:05 - to be a little bit smooth
134:07 - so there was a couple things i did to do
134:09 - that but here is
134:10 - my little mew um i added if you're
134:13 - seeing these boxes
134:14 - um i just added some plain so i can
134:16 - create like a stage
134:18 - to uh take a picture
134:21 - in that's a whole other doing background
134:24 - stuff is like a whole other thing in
134:25 - blender that i can't really get into
134:26 - right now but if you're wondering like
134:28 - why are these huge planes there
134:30 - that's that's just why you don't need to
134:31 - add planes right now okay so
134:34 - let's say you know you you got it you
134:36 - work through all of the manipulating of
134:38 - the vertices
134:39 - your mu is looking good you want to save
134:42 - it
134:42 - that's first and foremost we want to
134:43 - make sure we save so to save you're just
134:45 - going to come up here
134:46 - to file you just go to save as
134:50 - and then you can
134:54 - save the file whatever you want to save
134:56 - it as i saved it as new final i usually
134:58 - save
134:58 - as i move through every process
135:02 - so like when i finished which i guess i
135:04 - didn't do that with the
135:05 - oh what what i did like when i had all
135:07 - my finished pieces
135:08 - well first i'll save it in the very
135:09 - beginning and then as i have all my
135:12 - finished pieces i'll save that as
135:13 - something
135:14 - before i connect things just in case i
135:16 - messed something up and i'll save it
135:18 - again after connecting
135:19 - and i'll save it again once i have like
135:21 - my scene set up
135:22 - you want to make sure you save and then
135:24 - you just save it to whatever
135:26 - folder whatever box you just hit save a
135:28 - splendor file
135:30 - if you want to make this like a obg file
135:33 - i'm in obj file for putting and
135:35 - processing or any other type of file
135:38 - you'll then go to export and you'll see
135:40 - all the different types of files here
135:42 - so you have obj right here you have stl
135:45 - stl is good for 3d printing and a whole
135:49 - other range of files okay so again if
135:52 - you want to save
135:53 - saving is one thing and then exporting
135:56 - is another thing exporting is what
135:57 - you'll use to put it in
135:58 - another kind of software now rendering
136:02 - is its own third thing so like i said in
136:06 - order to
136:07 - render so to take a picture of it
136:10 - you have to have a camera okay so that's
136:12 - what this little doohickey is right here
136:14 - this is my camera that i had set up
136:16 - um i can't well
136:19 - just to make sure everyone knows how to
136:22 - add a camera since we deleted it in the
136:23 - previous one
136:24 - i'll do that with us so i'm going to
136:25 - delete this and we're just going to hit
136:28 - shift a
136:29 - make sure you're in object mode if
136:30 - you're not in object mode you just wanna
136:32 - hit tab to get back to object mode
136:34 - hit shift a and then you can come down
136:36 - here to camera
136:39 - now sometimes when you add the camera
136:41 - it's like already i'm pretty much every
136:43 - time when you add a camera into a scene
136:44 - it's like
136:45 - already kind of at this like funky angle
136:48 - it's just like why are you rotated
136:49 - slightly i don't really understand this
136:51 - if you want to clear that you can just
136:53 - hit option r
136:55 - you can hit option g to put it in the
136:57 - center if it's not in the center already
136:59 - and then as you can see it's pointing
137:01 - downward so we just want to rotate it
137:03 - so i'm going to rotate it on the
137:06 - y i'm going to do whoops
137:09 - sorry i'm going to rotate it
137:12 - on the x 90 degrees so that it's gonna
137:16 - be like facing
137:18 - our precious mu okay and then
137:21 - you move things the same way that you
137:22 - move a mesh you can move the camera
137:24 - so you just hit g to grab and you hit y
137:29 - and we can move this in front okay now
137:32 - our camera has its own separate view
137:36 - from what we are seeing in the viewport
137:38 - so viewport view
137:39 - and camera view are different so if you
137:42 - want to know what your camera is seeing
137:44 - there's two ways you can do this one is
137:47 - you can just come to view
137:49 - and um you can go sorry if we go to view
137:53 - you go to viewport if you hit camera or
137:55 - if you hit zero
137:57 - you'll see what your camera is seeing
138:00 - now once you rotate though it's going to
138:03 - instantly take you out of that
138:05 - so if you want your camera to kind of
138:07 - move with you there's a way you can lock
138:09 - that
138:10 - so to do that we're gonna first hit n
138:13 - it's gonna bring up this panel right
138:15 - here
138:16 - okay and we're gonna make sure we're in
138:17 - this view tab
138:19 - and we're gonna hit lock camera to view
138:24 - okay so then we're gonna hit zero again
138:25 - to go back to the camera mode what
138:26 - button did you press to bring up that
138:29 - tab to lock you'll hit n so
138:32 - as in number yeah and then you'll go to
138:35 - the view
138:36 - tab and then you hit lock camera to view
138:39 - and then now when we rotate
138:42 - or as we move the camera moves
138:46 - with us so this is really good for
138:48 - making sure that like when you're ready
138:49 - to take your picture
138:51 - but it's at the exact kind of angle that
138:54 - you wanted and so if i want this like
138:55 - bird's eye view like mew or maybe i want
138:58 - this like side view because i think he
139:00 - looks adorable for the side
139:01 - i can go ahead and just set that right
139:03 - on up and whatever is
139:05 - within the um orange
139:08 - or yellow kind of outline is what you're
139:10 - going to get in your camera
139:11 - there's different ways that you can
139:13 - adjust your camera which again we don't
139:15 - have time to get in here but there's a
139:16 - whole camera panel
139:18 - over here on the right where you can
139:19 - adjust um
139:22 - your camera we can adjust the dimensions
139:24 - and all that good stuff we're not going
139:25 - to worry about that right now
139:27 - so in order to render then so we have
139:30 - our camera set up
139:31 - at the angle that we want um
139:34 - i do want to know that if we don't have
139:36 - light in there
139:38 - your picture is not going to show so you
139:40 - want to make sure to add
139:42 - a light i already have a light set up
139:44 - because again this is my like final
139:46 - scene type of thing so you'll be able to
139:48 - see what happens here
139:49 - but just know that if you go to render
139:51 - if you do the same exact steps that i
139:53 - do here and it's just like completely
139:54 - dark it's because you don't have a light
139:56 - and if you want to add light you can add
139:58 - do shift a
139:59 - again and there's a bunch of different
140:01 - types of lights here
140:02 - you can just kind of arbitrarily throw
140:04 - one in for now just so you can have some
140:06 - light around me for when you take your
140:08 - picture
140:09 - okay so to render there's a couple
140:12 - different ways that you can
140:14 - go about rendering as well i mean the
140:15 - simplest way is you can come up here to
140:18 - the render tab
140:19 - and you can just hit render image
140:23 - and now my computer is a little bit slow
140:25 - because it is old
140:26 - but i will show you i got mine
140:31 - i'm gonna switch i'm gonna show it to
140:32 - people wait everybody here's my view
140:38 - and mine just popped up it's pretty here
140:41 - we go
140:42 - back to yours yours is much nicer
140:46 - back and forth everybody really simple
140:49 - again just wall and floor and color just
140:51 - so he can like be
140:52 - in something nothing fancy but that's
140:54 - why you're seeing like
140:55 - the little teal colors because i put a
140:57 - color onto the wall
140:58 - now so you have your picture this is
141:00 - what it looks rendered
141:02 - what you'll do to save it is it'll just
141:04 - go up here to image
141:06 - and then save as and then
141:11 - i'll just name it i'm just gonna put on
141:14 - my desktop and save it
141:17 - and then when i go to my desktop
141:22 - we have the image right here and this is
141:24 - what you can use to
141:26 - share you can always just take a
141:28 - screenshot but the screenshot is not
141:29 - going to be
141:30 - as good as a resolution the benefit of
141:32 - rendering is that you're able to up the
141:33 - resolution
141:34 - um i could make it like better than this
141:37 - if i wanted to i can change the
141:38 - dimensions of it
141:40 - um when i want to animate that's how
141:42 - you'll capture it through rendering
141:44 - so yeah when you're ready to export your
141:47 - picture that's all you have to do you
141:48 - just want to make sure you have a camera
141:49 - and you have a light in there
141:51 - and you just set your scene up however
141:53 - you want so
141:55 - if um this is amazing by the way i'm so
141:58 - excited we just i don't know why
141:59 - that step to me was just so exciting to
142:01 - see the sort of like
142:02 - high quality render um which especially
142:06 - when working in like real time
142:07 - graphics with 3d and processing or p5
142:10 - generally you don't have that sort of
142:11 - like
142:12 - level of resolution um so i i guess as
142:16 - an ex
142:16 - i guess one thing so let's think about
142:18 - this for a second if people make their
142:19 - own
142:20 - models that they learn to make from
142:22 - today and they want to share it with you
142:23 - or me or both of us
142:25 - um so that um obviously we have
142:27 - rendering the image is perfect um do you
142:29 - would you
142:30 - like is instagram or twitter like what's
142:32 - um what's a good and should we should we
142:34 - come up with a um
142:36 - a plan a hashtag um oh
142:39 - hashtags are cute let's see so i'm gonna
142:42 - pull up
142:43 - um well i'm not logged into my twitter
142:47 - right now it's gonna post mine but
142:49 - if you do want to post it um either to
142:52 - twitter or to instagram and to share it
142:54 - for me to see i'm chrissy bermidge on
142:56 - both okay
142:58 - so i would love to see it please feel
142:59 - free to tag me i would love to see your
143:01 - mew and also if you have any questions
143:03 - feel free to reach me on there as well
143:04 - i'm happy to answer questions
143:06 - um i'm pulling it up so it's on my
143:09 - screen now i'm pulling up your twitter
143:10 - which has um when you by the way if you
143:13 - want to see the reel again it's right
143:14 - there i posted the reel on my twitter
143:15 - which chrissy has here at the top of
143:17 - hers as well
143:21 - um let's pull up your instagram also
143:27 - so people can see it alright and there's
143:28 - mew there's exactly that image yay
143:32 - perfect so yeah please feel free to
143:36 - share please feel free to experiment
143:37 - feel free to ask questions i'll make
143:39 - sure to
143:41 - what one one thing that came up in the
143:44 - chat like so
143:45 - um so we can we can answer maybe um we
143:47 - we
143:48 - we should probably wrap up like let
143:50 - chrissy and everybody have a break
143:52 - because we've been going for a very long
143:53 - time thank you so much for spending so
143:55 - much time with us
143:57 - it's like incredible the amount of um
144:00 - uh information that you were able to
144:02 - pack into such a like one singular live
144:04 - stream
144:05 - i know if i if i had my whole weekend
144:07 - free i'd just be uh which you know
144:09 - would be stuck in like in blender i
144:11 - think yeah
144:12 - definitely have to find some more time
144:14 - um somebody a couple people mentioned in
144:15 - the chat
144:16 - um you that that you can shade it with
144:19 - smooth on
144:20 - or smooth shade yes so you can what is
144:23 - that
144:24 - so let me get out of this rendering here
144:27 - then go back
144:28 - and blender so i usually
144:33 - don't use smooth shading because i
144:36 - do low poly but if you want to
144:40 - you can just and let me um let me add in
144:43 - like a different
144:46 - like model because this is already
144:47 - pretty smooth or let me just go back to
144:49 - one of the other ones that i had open
144:53 - it's gonna be like oh
144:58 - oops i forgot that i moved it
145:03 - okay so like this one for example uh
145:06 - let's say that i wanted to just make
145:08 - like i wanted to render where it's not
145:10 - so boxy or i want it to
145:12 - the shading to be smoother just
145:15 - automatically
145:16 - what you can do is just right click
145:18 - whoops first
145:19 - sorry we're going to tab into edit
145:22 - i'm just going to right click that
145:25 - amaryllis writes um this stream was the
145:28 - best as i have a good confidence of
145:30 - making low
145:31 - poly the stream gave me next level
145:33 - confidence
145:34 - um and and the people in the chat are
145:37 - are suggesting i think i suggested it if
145:39 - people are thumbs upping it
145:40 - our hashtag is mewtrain so
145:43 - m-e-w-t-r-a-i-n
145:45 - i love that i love that so yeah okay so
145:48 - with
145:49 - that question you have the choice of um
145:51 - having with
145:52 - it being flat or have it being smooth so
145:54 - i've been doing flat because again i do
145:56 - low poly stuff but if you want it to be
145:58 - smooth just right click
146:00 - whoops make sure you're on the object
146:02 - and then right click and then hit just
146:03 - shade smooth you see it on oh yeah wow
146:07 - yeah the way that i made the mute though
146:10 - um smooth in that final
146:13 - reference was actually a modifier so i
146:15 - can show that as well let me
146:17 - move my zoom screen again it's in front
146:19 - so i'm just going to take this head here
146:21 - i'm going to go to the modifier tab and
146:24 - i'm just going to apply
146:25 - that because i don't really need it
146:26 - anymore and then the way that i did that
146:29 - was i went to da da da da da where is it
146:34 - subdivision surface it automatically
146:37 - just kind of smooths things out for you
146:38 - ah okay and then you just hit apply
146:43 - so in your um the final mu version that
146:46 - you made that's the stuff that you that
146:48 - you added
146:48 - yeah because i like like i said i love
146:51 - low poly and i wanted
146:53 - those kind of like planes in there so i
146:55 - usually do the subdivision surface but
146:57 - if you just want it to be completely
146:58 - round
146:59 - you can go ahead and just switch right
147:01 - over to
147:02 - shane's food um so funny story is that
147:06 - when i first was experimenting with some
147:08 - new 3d printers that we got at nyu
147:10 - my kids asked me to 3d print a pikachu
147:13 - and so i found some model that i online
147:16 - and i just like downloaded it and 3d
147:18 - printed was great
147:19 - is there are is there like anything you
147:22 - have to keep in mind like could that mew
147:24 - that you made be 3d printed
147:26 - or do you have to like conform to some
147:29 - specification like you can't have the
147:31 - model do this twist or this turn
147:33 - i mean it probably depends on what 3d
147:34 - printer you're using i'm sure i'm uh
147:36 - opening up a huge can of worms here but
147:38 - in in the basic sense
147:41 - if people want to 3d print what they've
147:43 - made is there anything any extra steps
147:45 - they should think about
147:46 - yeah so
147:50 - i'm still honestly trying to figure this
147:52 - out myself because i i started modeling
147:54 - in 2018 but then that first model that i
147:57 - made it was to be printed but i had
147:59 - someone else printed
148:00 - i just bought my first printer last year
148:03 - and what i am learning is that there
148:05 - definitely are things that you have to
148:06 - keep in mind
148:07 - um just off the brain some things i'm
148:09 - thinking about are like
148:10 - inverted vertexes so like how i had some
148:13 - of those
148:13 - like when i was playing around with that
148:15 - initial model and i had some vertexes
148:17 - that were kind of like
148:18 - under other vertexes that can cause
148:20 - errors but honestly there are software's
148:22 - out there already that people have made
148:24 - like open source things that will
148:26 - correct your model for you
148:28 - so at this stage if you're like i want
148:30 - to print things right away but i'm not
148:31 - sure
148:32 - if my model is kind of up to par for
148:34 - that
148:35 - you can i can give you a link to one of
148:37 - them so that you can just pop your model
148:38 - in it and it'll correct things for you
148:40 - and you can go ahead and print it but
148:41 - yeah there definitely are things
148:43 - that you have to learn about on that
148:44 - front but that's like definitely a whole
148:46 - other beast
148:47 - to kind of tackle and and people in the
148:50 - chat are are agreeing with you that the
148:52 - low poly aesthetic has a beauty all of
148:54 - its own
148:54 - and um uh someone else wrote
148:57 - and oh yeah a vedang writes voxel art
149:00 - also looks cool as well which i would
149:01 - agree
149:02 - yeah i mean i think there's in many ways
149:04 - sometimes you can get so wrapped up
149:06 - into creating something that's photo
149:09 - realistic
149:10 - or so highly detailed that you can sort
149:12 - of like lose sight
149:13 - of your artistic intentions and a lot of
149:15 - ways you can express yourself
149:16 - or be more creative with through
149:18 - abstraction and through
149:20 - um like lowering of the resolution
149:23 - so and i definitely see that in your
149:25 - work i mean the
149:26 - i mentioned this to you before we came
149:28 - on the the figure pointing at the sort
149:30 - of like planetary like
149:32 - orb that's just uh filling the space
149:35 - with stars and light is just
149:37 - so um to me this is so beautiful
149:40 - and there's not there's no color there
149:42 - there's no
149:43 - there's no fine details but there's
149:45 - something about um the energy that
149:47 - emanates from that simple
149:48 - um scene that's like really impactful
149:51 - thank you
149:53 - um uh marcos writes usually 3d printer
149:56 - software converts 3d models to what a 3d
149:57 - printer can easily
149:58 - read so yeah so it sounds like that's
150:01 - also along the same lines of
150:05 - step of putting it in um
150:09 - what is it called oh gosh i cannot
150:11 - remember slicing software
150:13 - i forgot it i'm forgetting what it's
150:14 - called but i use something called cura
150:16 - where it's like once you make the model
150:17 - oh
150:18 - i've used that yeah yeah you then and
150:20 - then you can correct things
150:21 - in there as well so yeah
150:26 - awesome well i think this is a nice
150:28 - point to
150:29 - wrap up um if everybody in the chat
150:33 - could give a little love and thank you
150:34 - to chrissy for spending so much time
150:36 - with us today
150:37 - i mean i i feel like i often teach new
150:40 - things to people on the coding train
150:42 - but and so i don't usually get to
150:43 - experience the other way around it was
150:45 - like such a thrill to have like
150:47 - something that i really don't know
150:48 - anything about and to try to follow
150:49 - along and i'm i'm so excited as soon as
150:51 - i get off i'm gonna
150:53 - share my model on twitter and all of
150:56 - that
150:56 - and i hope that all of you will also
150:58 - share um if you want to learn more
151:01 - about chrissy's work again um the link
151:03 - to her website
151:04 - is i'm i'm pulling it up right now oh
151:05 - you don't see my screen i'm gonna switch
151:06 - to that
151:07 - i'm pulling it up um is uh is in the
151:09 - video subscription
151:10 - chrissyprimage.com you can go to
151:14 - um her instagram as well as twitter make
151:17 - sure
151:18 - our hashtag is mewtrain hopefully no
151:21 - i'm i'm just gonna like uh i shouldn't
151:23 - be doing i'm gonna i'm just gonna switch
151:24 - off my uh screen for a second because
151:27 - i'm just gonna
151:28 - check no results from utrain so that's
151:30 - good i always worry like i'm gonna pull
151:31 - up something on twitter and
151:33 - by accident i don't wanna pull up
151:34 - something right
151:36 - without looking at it first so you can
151:37 - see you can see that there's no results
151:39 - from utrain so we can fill the universe
151:42 - with beautiful 3d models made in blender
151:46 - and utrain and i will i'm certainly
151:47 - making a commitment
151:49 - to in a follow-up stream try to see if i
151:51 - can take my
151:52 - obj model that i exported and bring it
151:54 - into processing or p5
151:56 - which i know that will be of interest to
151:57 - people and um
151:59 - you know we can always consider us as
152:01 - sometime in a future date if chrissy
152:02 - wants to come back and show some
152:04 - additional steps of course
152:05 - you're more than welcome to do that um
152:08 - i can also make my um my final mew
152:11 - available
152:11 - like the file the obj file so if you
152:14 - guys want to go ahead and start playing
152:15 - around with it and processing i'll make
152:17 - that
152:17 - available that's a great idea yeah so
152:19 - we'll that's a great idea and i'll try
152:20 - to um
152:21 - figure out you know just look for in the
152:22 - video subscription but certainly if you
152:24 - join the discord
152:25 - if we have a webpage or github repo or
152:27 - something where we put some of these
152:28 - materials
152:29 - um i'll make sure to link to that for
152:31 - sure um
152:33 - let me also just briefly let me i'm
152:35 - gonna check um i think
152:37 - if i pull up the live stream i've saw so
152:39 - many donations come in
152:41 - i'm just gonna pull this up and it looks
152:43 - like oh i i wonder if
152:45 - we either exactly reached the goal of
152:47 - 500 or we went over it and youtube just
152:50 - doesn't list it it's
152:51 - awesome so that's wonderful thank you
152:54 - everyone
152:54 - thank you everyone i'm i'm looking for
152:56 - my train whistle which is my way of
152:59 - very strange way of saying thank you to
153:01 - people
153:02 - that's wonderful that we're able to
153:04 - support please um if you want to learn
153:06 - more about the tender foundation or if
153:07 - you want to
153:08 - you know get involved or volunteer make
153:09 - a donation you know check out their
153:11 - website it's
153:13 - thetenderfoundation.com and i believe
153:16 - also um tender foundation is on
153:19 - instagram as well so if you want to i
153:21 - don't know that it makes sense to share
153:23 - our 3d models with the tender foundation
153:24 - but why not you know
153:25 - give them some love if you make a 3d
153:28 - model
153:29 - um that you were inspired from this live
153:31 - stream um
153:32 - so that i think really wraps them i'm
153:36 - almost
153:36 - always like so awkward trying to end
153:38 - these uh they've been here for quite a
153:40 - long time
153:40 - i think i know uh two and a half hours
153:44 - you know i i've i routinely the joke one
153:47 - of the running jokes that i'm like i
153:48 - really i can only live stream for an
153:50 - hour today i have to be somewhere in an
153:51 - hour
153:52 - four hours later i'm still trying to
153:53 - debunk some pain so

154:14 - guest conductor videos
154:16 - planned probably not till august i'm
154:18 - hoping to do one more
154:20 - coding in the cabana tutorial video
154:22 - sometime in the next few weeks
154:23 - so stay tuned for that and i'm going to
154:24 - have one probably last live stream of
154:27 - the summer because i'm going to be

154:42 - which is a welcoming friendly place for
154:45 - beginners and
154:46 - everyone to engage with each other and
154:48 - ask questions and get help

154:51 - do to help make the discord
154:53 - a more positive and welcoming experience
154:55 - for you you should definitely reach out
154:56 - and email
154:58 - info at thecodingtrain.com and if you
155:00 - want to get involved
155:01 - in the guest conductor series we're
155:03 - using this right now to amplify black
155:05 - voices in tech
155:07 - you can write to psy at
155:08 - thecodingtrain.com that's cy
155:11 - at thecodingtrain.com okay anything else
155:13 - that i miss chrissy that you want to say
155:15 - before we go
155:16 - um i just want to say thank you to you
155:19 - and also
155:20 - corsair and also to the coding train
155:22 - community for
155:23 - first of all for sticking it out for was
155:25 - it two hours two and a half
155:26 - years thanks so much for being here

Cleaned transcript:

so hello everyone we'll be starting in about five minutes this is just me testing to make sure my microphone is working so you can say hello in the chat if it is do do do do do hello everyone we'll be starting in about five minutes just me testing to make sure my microphone is working so you can say hello in the chat if it is hi everyone if you heard a strange echo it's because i had the live stream open on my computer so the music was going out to you and into my computer and then out to you again so apologize i have fixed that and we are starting in about 45 seconds hello everyone good morning happy saturday welcome to the coding train it's me dan oh we're on the internet together um i'm so excited today oh i have an extra light that i need to turn on i forgot to turn this light on do i look better now this side of my face looks more uh um like it's supposed to i don't know what to say i'm so excited for today this is a special saturday live stream i have a guest um that i'm uh i'm super excited to share her work with you and have her teach me something or show me how to do something which i have never done before and actually let me just briefly get started by um saying and here's our guest up on the screen you see uh chrissy brimmage and this is a an image of her work but what i want to uh quickly tell you and say is i for the first time ever in my life installed something called blender on this very laptop this morning and you can see right up here on the on the top right of my screen there it is i just installed it because i'm going to try to follow along and you know or at least look at blender again a little bit later today so um if you want to get a head start and try to follow along with the tutorial stuff that we're going to do in about 15 minutes or so um download blender and there's a link to where you can download blender in the video description let me make sure it's there so i'm pulling that up now and you can see ah there it is so um first of all uh here's uh chrissy's website her instagram so check those out i'm gonna talk uh a bit more about chrissy and introduce her work and show you a reel of her work in a moment um as well as the link to download blender and oh this is really important because the example um that we're going to work with today is making your very own mew i don't know if chrissy actually knew this but i'm kind of uh uh you know i mean i'm out in the open about my love for pokemon so uh but uh there's a lot of pokemon going on in this household in fact i've got some a lot of toys and characters and things and plushies around that i could bring but i'll i'll save that for later but you can get this mew reference image and also make sure you download and install blender which is not required you can just watch and enjoy and participate but i encourage you to download uh blender okay um alexander asks will this be a tutorial on the software or is there going to be a coding aspect so today is not really the day that i'm that we're going to look uh at coding it's really like a basic introduction to blender and i think one of the things that's exciting about it is just about everything that i do is very 2d graphics oriented in p5 or processing so this is really also a bit of an introduction to sort of thinking in terms of 3d and you know my hope is that if i can learn a little bit from chrissy about how to use blender and it might be something that i add to my workflow and one of the things that i would love to do if i make my own pokemon u in blender maybe i'll see if i can export it and import it to a p5.js sketch or a processing sketch that would be certainly be a fun thing to try i'm just taking a look at the chat v specky says i love pokemon so darn much alright me too me too v specky okay uh so what i want to say like so a quick um quick just sort of like notes and logistics from the coding train so it's the summer as you know i'm not at my um nyu workspace where i record a lot of video tutorials so things are a little bit offkilter i am doing live streams from this uh home location that i'm in in brooklyn um i recently released a video on marching squares um which is an algorithm that you can make interesting beautiful patterns with um so that came out yesterday um and i encourage you um to um if you make your own creative version of marching squares you can add there's only one community contribution here right now and i do hope to have a live stream next week where i will go through and look at some of these community contributions and show them and analyze them as well as maybe investigate marching cubes because today not so perfect i couldn't have imagined this better myself not planned but the next thing i wanted to try once i did marching squares was marching cubes which is taking marching squares from 2d to 3d but that's the topic of today going from 2d to 3d so that's what's going on in the coding train these days today is part of my guest conductor series um i want to also highlight for you let's see if i can pull this up if i go to the channel um the previous two guest conductors um amigos code and if i scroll back a little bit further um oh there there there she is um aaron davey from the twitch channel cozy cozy coding so check out amigos code uh channel on youtube and then uh aaron um live streams very regularly on twitch um making all sorts of what she likes to call i think like p5.js jan sessions and every every example that she's made in p5.js that comes out of that is just so delightful and so if you're if you're looking for more experimental creative fun with code and p5.js definitely check out um aaron davies um cozy coding train oh and we got a donation which means when we get a donation that i have to thank you with a random number because that's the weird stuff that i do on the coding train so i'm going to take my oh let me switch back to this view here oops nope wrong view here we go okay so i have my book a million random digits thank you anonymous for your donation i'm going to talk about the tender foundation in just a moment and for you uh i you will have your random number is ah oh no this book's falling apart that's terrible but we'll use the face excellent all right stop okay uh 98 0008 thank you very much so let me talk to you um about the tender foundation um i want to thank chrissy who again i'll introduce in a moment for introducing me to the tender foundation i was not familiar with tender before the tender foundation is a nonforprofit based in atlanta georgia it's run by jasina almand founded by her and it supports um mothers in need um you know being a parent i'm not a mother i am a father is a really challenging and difficult wonderful thing but i've been so lucky in my life to be able to have the resources um to not worry too much about things like diapers and food and not everyone is so lucky and the tender foundation is doing some amazing work um in atlanta georgia to help um mothers so i i was i could talk a little bit about the tender foundation um all the donations that you make um through this live stream go directly to the tender foundation youtube through their giving program covers all the fees and i'm also going to match go i set a goal for 500 i'm going to match a 500 donation um as well so what i want to do is play you a quick video message from jacina almond who is the founder of the tender foundation to tell you a little bit more about their work okay so give me a second here hopefully this is gonna come up i'm gonna oh uh let me actually turn off the air conditioning which is making a noise i realized and let me click over to her video and i'm going to mute myself hi um my name is jacina allman the founder of the tender foundation based in atlanta georgia first off i just want to say we're so grateful to christy and the coding train for allowing us this opportunity and supporting our work at tender we are committed to empowering all moms by making the essentials accessible we do this through our family stabilization program the program provides emergency financial assistance with rent utilities um grocery store gift cards and other necessities like diapers and wipes to our moms we um we do this work with like a lot of heart and a little hassle we believe our process is streamlined simple we really just stand in the gap and act as a safety net for all of the um the families living on the margins that are typically under resourced and so we really just like to surround our our moms in love and really destigmatize the process of being vulnerable enough to ask for help and so yeah that's that's what we do and again i'm super super grateful for this opportunity and i'm so excited to learn something with chrissy so thanks so much all right thank you jay cena for your message um thank you for uh sharing your work with us and all the work that you do i hope that um we can we can raise a little money and help support the tender foundation we just got a donation thank you very much from japs um and a couple people in the chat mention they that they can't donate through youtube because it's not available in their country um i will mention that of course you are also welcome to go donate directly on the tender foundation's website um but there's a little link here click under donate um and you can make a donation there so if you're not able to donate and you would like to i'm not able to donate through the youtube interface and you would like to go directly to their website you want to tweet me a receipt or something you're welcome to and i'll send you a nice little thank you message you don't need to do that i'm just saying if you feel like you want to be acknowledged with your donation i would love to know about it and thank you for it personally um okay so um i think i am ready for the next stage here which is to introduce um i actually made like a schedule and it says like oh i never do this because i'm so disorganized but it says on next on my schedule is um an introduction to chrissy's work and i'm actually five minutes ahead of schedule which is amazing so um i'm well i'm gonna pull up um chrissy uh bremenj's website um thank you oh i forgot to thank psy who is the um which i should have done right from the outset who's the coding train um community manager i realize i'm not in the uh video here um oh we got another donation from stein ovid bratomer thank you very much a train whistle uh for you for that donation um someone in the chat is asking me why don't i use donation alert yeah i tried to hook it up so the lights blink with donations but i couldn't get that to work so um maybe i can figure that out for the next i hope to do more fundraising so somebody knows how to get the youtube api with donations it works for all the other kind of transaction stuff but for some reason the donations aren't coming up but that's not what's important it's nice when the lights blink but alas we will we will enjoy ourselves uh and uh your donation is really um i'm really grateful and thank you for that oh but uh most importantly um i wanted to thank psy who is the coding trained community manager sai is the curator and and coproducer of the guest conductor series um i was not familiar with chrissy's work until psy introduced me to them and so um i was so thrilled and just like marveling at the beauty on of different projects on the website and really excited i'm always excited when somebody who's practice is different than mine can share how they how they work things that they have learned things that they want to share about how their practices and and kind of explore their creative process as a guest on the coding train so um let me play for you um uh chrissy's reel so you can get a sense of her the kind of art and projects that she makes with blender and other uh tools and then i will i'm gonna also just read from her bio on the website so now her reel is coming up here um and so um chrissy is a multiuh disciplinary artist living and working out of brooklyn by way of atlanta georgia and her work utilizes the opportunities and constraints of digital space to research social phenomena of the material world she's currently interested in the function of identity dreaming of futures beyond oppressive systems defining freedom reworking ideas of justice and how to integrate mediums such as illustration code design animation 3d modeling and vr to communicate explore and bridge my personal perception her personal perceptions of these issues as well as the variations in perceptions between different social identities so one of the things that i love about chrissy's website and the real is repeating here is that um you know i think when you are working with code you can get so lost in the technical and are working with digital media um but sometimes you can sort of forget like why it is you're doing that and on um chrissy's website i'm gonna pull that up over here um she lists these four questions that she's been asking herself what world do i want to live in what is identity and how is it used what does freedom be on depression feel like can we expand our perceptions of the world through vr embodiment and so these are such uh wonderful questions i i think it's a good exercise for all of us i should do this myself like after today is to like take a minute write down what are the questions you're asking about yourself the world uh and the meaning behind the work and the things that you're creating um so um uh without further ado i think i would like to bring chrissy on chrissy you're still muted but why don't you say say hello to me so i can make sure i hear you okay i heard chrissy now i'm gonna unmute her now say hello to the coding trade audience hello everyone okay and then i'm going to switch over to um the screen that i have that has uh your video so hold on so um there everybody should be sorry i'm kind of new at this technically with having guests so apologies for all the awkwardness as i was trying to explain to christy i was like don't worry if everything goes wrong that's kind of the point of the coding train it all goes wrong and we figure it out together so uh hopefully you see chrissy right now hi chrissy hi um is i don't know if there's anything you wanted to say about the tender foundation you brought um you you shared their work with me um i hadn't uh heard of them before that i missed or that you think would be important to say um not to put you on the spot sorry no um i just wanted to say that i know i've known jacina now for a couple of years and just the work that she does with tinder but even outside of tinder i mean she's a really awesome person and the tender foundation really does do a lot of great work here in atlanta um they did a lot for the protest as well like they are really really about the mission that they have put you know on their website and you know i wanted to bring them in today because um because they're doing great work but also it's a nonprofit that is kind of here in my hometown of atlanta and i just hope you know we find some time and space and love to donate to them and help some mamas awesome thank you so much yeah and i know that atlanta i mean everyone is going through a hard time especially in this country with the pandemic and i know that atlanta has uh it's an ep epicenter now these days so i hope that we can uh give a little support we went through this we're still going through to new york but you know we're lucky enough now in brooklyn that our numbers have come down a little bit and i know that atlanta is definitely going through a rough patch so hopefully we can offer our support to the city and the community and especially those who don't have access to uh resources um who have little babies um that's really like i i'm glad to be able to do our small part my small part in being able to help for sure um great so um i don't know if you uh how i don't know what the best way to get started is but you know if i'm gonna uh if you're ready i'll pull up your screen shall i do that now yeah okay so i'm gonna switch where to see i'm i've got a button here i'm gonna press we're gonna see if this works so now you should be seeing um chrissy's um screen and we can i'm just gonna kind of like turn it over to you i'm gonna launch blender on my laptop and try to follow along and i'll ask questions along the way if there are things that i'm confused about and i'm also keeping an eye on the chat as well and thank you to nick k um with your for your donation to tender or not uh um you know i don't want i want to let chrissy be able to have some flow here so i don't know that i'm gonna pause and stop every time somebody donates but at the end i'll try to say some thank yous again to other people who who donate as well um and so if you have questions you can ask them in the chat i'll try to keep track of them but we'll also um have a little bit of time towards the end if people want to ask um some questions about to chrissy about her work or just working with blender and and the like cool all right let's jump in okay so first and foremost hi everyone i am super excited to be here um just a little bit of background on me um i actually when i was learning to code and when i was getting my background or trying to get my bearings with machine learning i lived on the coding train okay i was on the coding training like every day watching videos so it's really cool to be here and to share something maybe new to some of you maybe not so new but either way i think we'll have some fun today um the way that i'm gonna kind of outline this video or the kind of overarching goal here is that i want to try to get everyone kind of familiar with moving around in 3d space so if you've never heard of blender never opened blender saw blender and thought smoothies like you have no clue what it is this is like the perfect video for here we're gonna walk through kind of the concepts behind moving from 2d to 3d then i'm going to show kind of like how to navigate in 3d space and then at the end we'll go ahead and hopefully have some time to do a demo of how to model that new reference so like dan said if you are interested in following along there is a link in the description to both blender and also the new reference okay so first and foremost just a really quick note about blender if you haven't heard of it before i have the description here on my screen it's a free and open source 3d creation suite and it supports a bunch of things from modeling rigging animation simulation just anything 3d you can probably do in blender and that's specifically why i picked it today so we're not going to do any coding today but it has the capability to link encoding so if you do hard coding and you want to try like generative code you can do some of that in blender if you've been working in 2d but you want to move to 3d if you've been doing static work you want to try animation um if you want to create some obj files to put into p5 dan has a really great tutorial on that already so there's a lot of really great things that you can do in blender so it's a really great transition tool which is why i wanted to talk about it today because it just kind of opens the doors to new explorations new mediums more dreaming if there's something new that you want to try one question that just came in from the chat that i thought i would ask is um somebody asked if um which version of blender or does it matter which version they download are you using the latest version for today we're going to be talking about blender 2.8 um i think they just released like an update like 2.83 or something like that but as long as it's blender 2.8 will be good got it okay so before i even do anything major i just want to give a note that for the first part here um while i'm talking about concepts i'm not going to note every single thing that i'm doing like functionality but if there's anything that i don't know when it's time to model i'm going to completely backtrack open blender again from the very beginning and walk us through every single step so don't worry if you don't quite know what's happening movement wise or function wise in the beginning it will all be explained later okay so let's talk about first just kind of the concept behind moving from 2d to 3d or just creating 3d work in digital space periods so the biggest difference and i'm going to actually pull up an example piece um so again don't don't freak out when you see this this looks a lot more complex because i use this for animation blender doesn't always look this scary i promise but i'm going to use this piece as an example um so the biggest kind of difference and i'm going to actually show the reference photo as well the biggest difference between 2d and 3d work are making 2d and 3d work is that when you are making 2d work you are creating the illusion of 3d okay so you're doing things like using your composition using shadows using foreground background to create the illusion of a full picture because you can only draw in like one or maybe two i guess depending on how you how you outline things perspectives okay so what you're doing is you're creating that picture in that one dimension and then your brain or the audience's brain is doing the leg work to kind of imagine everything else so for example when we're looking at this picture here um you know we see it's like a person and when we look at the head from the way that i drew it i mean hopefully we would imagine that it's like a rounded head so we look at it and we imagine that there's like a back um hopefully we imagine that there's like another ear these fingers that are hidden we imagine them there because that's what we're used to seeing in real life so the difference when you're moving into the 3d is that these things that are imagined what our brain usually does the leg work for we actually have to do the legwork in the 3d space so i want to show kind of an example of what i mean with this piece here so this is the 3d version of the picture that you just saw that i did so what's going to happen usually or at least what happened to me when i first moved into doing 3d work is that i'm so used to drawing in that one perspective that when you move into 3d work there's a tendency to kind of do the same to work from the front or to work from the back so usually what will happen is you'll go into blender you have your model you're ready you're like this is great this is going to be good you go and you completely model the front and then you expect or you're used to your brain kind of doing the legwork of completing the rest but then you turn the model and it's completely flat and you're like oh okay so like in our heads we know that there is a third dimension in 3d space but kind of moving and um working with that is what's going to be kind of the most kind of shocking thing when you first move into 3d so with this model i kind of got away with it because i only needed the front view but when you're doing things like making characters or if you're interested in 3d printing things where the model has to be 360 you have to keep every single dimension in mind which sounds really really intimidating and it sounds like a lot but blender has some really great kind of features to help with this so i'm going to show just a couple of suggestions i'm i'm gonna open a completely new project here okay so this is what blender usually looks like when you first start when you have a new project as you can see it starts to go off with like this cube here i'm gonna use this cube to do a kind of demonstration of ways that we can set up our viewport here and our viewport is just the screen that you're seeing whatever you're viewing is the viewport so the first thing that we can do to kind of help us when we're ready to make our first model is use a reference okay so in the same way that references are super useful in 2d they are your best friend in 3d and what's cool about blender is that you don't have to like navigate back and forth so i'm going to go ahead and pull up the mu reference so you know usually when you're like drawing something you have your drawing here you have your reference off to the side or maybe on your computer and you're going back and forth trying to make sure that everything's right or maybe you're tracing it what's cool about blender is that you can drop your reference right into the viewport okay so i can just take this i can drag it and drop it right on in there and that way when i'm modeling i can put my model right in front so i'm just going to grab this also if anyone just joined um you can find that reference image if you want to use the same reference image there's a link to it in the video's description so if you scroll down you'll be able to find it yeah and one thing i want to note about references in for 3d space so i picked this new reference for a reason one because it's absolutely adorable but also because it has three different views so something that might also be new when you're transitioning from 2d to 3d if you're used to drawing in one perspective when you move to 3d again you have to have a full kind of 360 understanding of your piece so things that are usually hidden in 2d you have to make decisions about in 3d okay so for example if you drew a character that is facing backwards if you draw them from the back you know usually in 2d you don't have to really imagine what their face looks like but in 3d you will so when it comes time to choose a reference you want to try to look for things like this like this new reference so something that has at the bare minimum like a front reference and a side reference but if you can find something with you know a right reference a left top bottom as much as you can the more references that you have when you're doing 3d work the more comfortable you're going to feel because you don't have to imagine anything that's not there everything will be there for you so try to look for references like this if you can't find something that has all three of them in one like let's say you're i don't know you want to make a reference of you want to make like a elephant or something you can't find a picture of an elephant from three different angles just try to find three different pictures that you like that are kind of similar that you can see it from the front and from the side at least and then if you can find other views from the back or whatever other angle it's gonna help a lot okay so right now my reference is in here um i kind of have it at a funny angle though so i'm gonna actually delete this i'm gonna back up and now so i keep talking about all these different views in um blender or we talk about how you know you can see a piece from the front you can see a piece from the back when you first go in blender you're probably like i don't know where i am like am i am i in the front am i in the back i have no clue luckily blender has views so we can and i'll go through this again when we go to the modeling but just to show really quick if you go up here to the view tab and you go to viewport it has all of the different views that you can look at so you have top you have bottom you have front back right left and you can navigate these using your keys so i'm gonna do that with my keyboard so now i'm in the front if i press three now i'm in the right you can even jump to opposites using nine so that way you always know where you are and it'll show you up here in the top left corner if you ever feel lost and click a button you're like i don't know where i am anymore blender will always show you in the top left here okay so now that i'm in the front view i'm going to go ahead and drag this new reference back in here okay and so usually what i do is once i put my reference in i move whatever like base that i'm going to use to model in front so i'm just going to do that really quick i'm just going to scale this down and again don't worry if you don't know what i'm doing i will explain all these keys a little bit later okay so i have this in the front right and now you're probably thinking well okay chrissy you said don't just model from one view though like we're only in one view this doesn't help blender actually allows us to split screens so we can actually model from different views all at the same time so there's two ways that we can do that one manually and one through blender blender will set it up for us so i'm going to show the manual way so if you ever want to split your screen so that you can model in different views at once all you have to do is come to a corner and you'll see the mouse turns into a crosshair and when you get that crosshair you just drag oh so there we go okay you just drag and it'll give you another screen okay so now both of these are in front because when you split your screen initially it's going to split it the exact same way so whatever view you're in in one screen it's going to duplicate in the other screen but let's say that i wanted to model in both front and maybe like right view so what i'll do is i'll come over to this right side here and i'm going to hit three okay so now i have the front and the right so when i make a change so let's say i decide to wrote this rotate this i can see what happens in both views at once which is really really useful because as you're modeling and you're getting used to what i call walking around the model so just making sure that we're using or viewing the model from all angles as we move is that again as you make a change in one view it's going to show how it affects in the other view so it kind of breaks you out of that one perspective kind of view and mindset now we only have the reference in the front view though so that doesn't really help us but we can do the same thing we can drag you can drag and drop our reference over in the right view as well so i'm gonna move this i'm gonna move this over some just gonna rearrange my is a little bit right now because as you can see they're stacked so i'm just gonna move this one back a little bit and put me back in front okay so now i can move my box i'm gonna grab it i had a quick question which is um so i noticed like this like for example the pressing the numbers doesn't work for me because i'm just on a laptop without a number pad and also like i'm using the track pad so i'm assuming are you using a regular mouse or some of the stuff you're doing like is that like is that recommended let me actually show you how to fix that thank you for bringing that up because that was something that was like chrissy make sure you know this but i'm so sorry so if you are on a laptop and you're like i can't move what's happening blender is built for using a mouse um and using like the three click system so using the wheel as a click so if you are on a laptop right now and you want to be able to move without a mouse and just use your trackpad all you have to do is go to file or sorry go to edit and we're going to scroll down here to preferences and then we're going to go down here to the input tab and then you just click emulate numpad so this is going to allow you to use the numbers on your keyboard and then you also click emulate three button mouse and that'll help you move around thank you dan for bringing that up so again if you are on a laptop and you want to be able to move without a mouse and you want to be able to use the keys that are already on your keyboard just go to edit preferences then we'll go down here to the input tab and then we'll click emulate numpad and then we'll also click emulate three map three button mouse and how did you delete the mu image that's one that i could get to work maybe i should okay so i was gonna wait to completely do like oh sorry it's fine i think it makes more sense for me to talk about the buttons that i'm clicking while i do this i'll just i'll just go ahead and say all the buttons on these things that way it'll make a little bit more sense okay so in order to delete what we'll do is you just click so a regular like left click and then you hit x and it'll prompt you here say okay delete and you just click it and then you can delete anything like that okay so i'm going to bring this back in really quick and just a note if your reference isn't coming in there can be two reasons why that's happening one reason why it won't come in is if you click on your object your reference for whatever reason might not want to come in so you just want to click off of it and then try to drag it in also if it's not coming in it's very possible that you're in a different mode so make sure to look up here and make sure it says object mode so if you want to bring in new objects anytime you want to bring in a new object whether it's a reference photo whether it's another mesh such as this cube here you always want to make sure you're in object mode okay so for whatever reason your reference isn't coming in just make sure we're an object okay so again what i'm going to do is really quickly i'm just resetting everything to the center where this crosshair is and to do that all you have to do is press option and then g and with my scrim and do the same thing just press option g and that just moved everything down here to the middle okay so again on the right side here we are in front view on the left side we're on we're in right view and something else i want to note really quick too is that as you can see up here it says right orthographic and if i press 5 it's going to say right perspective so i want everyone to make sure that you're in orthographic mode okay there are two different modes in blender orthographic and perspective i don't want to explain that right now because it's very very confusing long story short you mostly use perspective if you're doing like scene modeling so for example if you want to model outer space you'll probably want to use perspective but if you're doing like character modeling anything that's going to use details you always want to make sure you're in orthographic okay and again you'll know where you are because blender will say it in this top left corner here and let me make this bigger sorry so you can see everything okay so again if you're in perspective just hit five it'll put you in orthographic mode okay so we have our reference set up in the right side and left side i'm going to move my cube over so in order to move it i'm just going to click it i'm just going to left click it once then i'm going to hit g which is grab and then what i want to note quickly before i move it is as you can see up here um this is kind of like your axis that's going to tell you kind of where you are in space or how to make a movement okay so as you can see on this side if i want to move right i'm going to move it on the y but on this side if i wanted to move right i would move it on the x and the reason for that is because we're in two different views okay so again if you're you feel lost you're not sure where you are first make sure that you check on the top left and then if you're like well i don't really know how to move then you can check on the top right just to try to figure out where to go okay so i'm going to come over here to this left panel because i want to move my box in front of this right view of mu or this the left view of mu he's facing left so what i'm going to do is i'm going to click onto the box so just one left click and then i'm going to hit g to grab and then remember we're on this side so if we want to move right we're going to use the y axis so i'm going to click i'm going to hit g and then i'm going to hit y so that i can move it left or right and now i'm just going to move the box right over mu and as you can see on this side it disappeared a little bit that's only because my references are kind of crosshaired like this so i'm going to move this reference back this front reference here by clicking it i'm going to hit g and now this time if i want to move right again we're going to use that yaxis i'm just going to move back here okay so now on the right side where we're in the front view we have our box in front of the right meme reference here and on the left side when we're modeling in the right even though i guess technically it should have been the left but that's okay um we have our box in front of the side reference of mu so again as we make a change in one so if i come over here and i rotate and to rotate you just hit r so if i rotate on the right i will see in real time how it affects the front okay so this is really important again because we are working in multiple angles all at once and we always want to know how kind of what we do in one angle affects the other and on that note something i just want to note really quickly is that references in 2d don't always perfectly translate in 3d so everything here with mu you know looks up to spec from our eye because we are seeing it in separate angles but sometimes when we try to combine all the references we'll notice like maybe the arm was like a little bit higher in the front reference than it is on the side reference and maybe the ears are a little bit more back in the front reference than they are on the side reference so with references they are your best friend you want to love them you want to cherish them but you don't want to marry them you want to stay flexible because as you are manipulating different angles you're going to notice that things may not line up and that's okay you can just use your best judgment to make adjustments from there okay so this is our split this is usually where i like to keep splits because it could get a little a little tight in the area but you can actually split the viewport as many times as you want so let's say you have 16 different references if you wanted to split the viewport 16 different times in 16 different ways you totally could so again all you have to do to do that is come to any corner and just drag up okay and now i can change this one to the back so now i'll know what's happening in the back and i can do the same over here i can just drag it up and i'll change this one to the left so now as i'm making a change in the front i will now see what's happening oh the bottom one is kind of blocked but you can see the point that as i move in one i know what's happening in every single angle okay and now if we want to get rid of these if you're trying to like grab and you're like oh no i keep making a million windows i've been here before and i panicked and i completely like closed out a project and started from scratch so i was like i don't know how to get rid of all these windows don't worry there's an easy way to do that all you have to do is come over just hover over the line where it gives you that two kind of arrows you'll right click on your track pad then you just hit join area i'm gonna do that again just right click join area and then you'll click which way you wanna join so you can join up you can join down and then again i'm just going to join all these i'm going to bring us back to two screens now if you don't want to do all the dragging or if dragging feels hard or maybe your trackpad doesn't work all that great you can also do this a blender will set things up manually for you so you can come up here to the view tab you come all the way down to area and you'll see a couple different options so we have a toggle quad view which will give us before again which that gave us four on one side just because i already had it split so then if you want to get rid of that you can come back to area and just hit toggle quad view again it'll get rid of it and there's also options for the horizontal split we have vertical splits however you want to split it blender can automatically do that for you this is also really useful if you want to start to make a transition into like animation or rigging or even when you're rendering um i can set for example i'm just gonna really quickly show you what edit mode looks like and again i will explain this later when we're actually modeling so on the left or on the left here now i'm in edit mode and i'm gonna make this one whoops sorry i'm gonna make this actually so this is a rendered view so i haven't made any changes to the square so you're not really going to notice the difference but like if i change the color for example which i can do that really quick just so you can see what i mean so i'm going to change this color to blue okay so as you can see on our left side we have the rendered view so when you start to do things like adding textures or adding colors none of that is going to show when you're in object mode or when you're in edit mode as you're reworking the mesh but if you want to see in real time kind of what everything looks like you'll be able to see it if you have kind of that split so splitting is really useful for one keeping track of how all angles look like at the same time but it's also useful in your workflow as you're creating things like the render or creating the animation you're just able to see everything all at once which is really really useful okay so i'm going to come back out of that rendered mode okay so i'm going to put us back in right and in front and i'm going to reset the rotation of this cube by just hitting option r so it's just going to clear any rotation that we did and i think this is a good point to start to move into the demo from you but before we get to demoing i just want to explain how to move period in blender one what one question came up in the chat and i wasn't gonna ask it because i was having trouble with it too i'm having trouble figuring out i have exactly what you have but i'm having trouble on the right panel the front orthographic view getting the mu uh the reference image to move behind the cube that should be along the x axis so to do that yeah so okay so we're in the front here right now we want to move this reference back what i usually do is i'll just kind of like turn to see which way it needs to go and these lines here correspond to every axis so this green one is y this red one is x you can't see the z one right now but the z is always blue so um since our y is the one in in behind the reference we're just going to click the reference and then we'll hit g and then we'll hit y and that'll allow us to move it back got it cool great question okay so let's talk about movement before we even start to make our mute okay so first since we already talked about kind of the views just to review if you want to change what view you are in you can either come up here to the view tab and go to viewport and it'll show you all the options or if you are a hotkey person you can come to memorize them and you can use your keyboard to just move around so one is front three is right uh command three is left i think command one is back and then if you don't wanna memorize every single one what i usually do or what i have done is i just memorize front and right so front is one right is three and then if i want to go to the back all you have to do is hit nine to go to the opposite so when i was in front it sent me to the back and now if i hit nine again so i'm in the back it'll take me back to the front and this will happen again with right view so if i hit three to go to right view and i want to go to the left view i can just hit nine that's going to put me in the left and if i want to go back to the right view just hit nine again and now i'm back in the right and that way you don't have to memorize every single key okay so that is moving views but we can also move in between views okay so if you want to look at three quarter if you want to look at the top and there's actually top buttons as well i think seven there we go seven is top and if you hit nine it'll put you on the bottom if you hit nine again it'll take you back up top but again there's angles in between top and bottom there's angles in between the front like sometimes we need to see some weird angle maybe like under mu's tail or like i don't know if that looks right you can move just by putting two fingers on your track pad and just moving about okay so this will allow you to rotate we can go up and down we can go all around and then if we feel dizzy and we're like oh gosh i'm seeing too much take me back to front we'll just hit one to go back but now you're probably like well okay i can rotate but i can't go left to right like how do i move left to right so in order to do that you just hold shift and use those same two fingers and you'll be able to shift left and right or up and down or diagonal whichever way you want to go okay so we release shift and just use two fingers if we just want to rotate around something and then we use shift in two fingers if we want to shift to the side shift up shift down okay so that is the basics of movement um so the basics then of kind of manipulating we'll talk about now so there are multiple modes if you click this tab here where it says object mode oh and that's actually not showing it for some reason oh there we go okay so if you click this tab here you're gonna see there's a bunch of different modes don't worry about any of those right now the only two that we're gonna worry about today are object mode and edit mode okay so again right now we're in object mode we use object mode to add in or take out objects okay so let's say that i wanted to add in a sphere for whatever reason we can do that either by going to this add panel up here and then you'll go to mesh and you can pick any type of mesh that you see there so add mesh and any mesh that you want to add you can go in there or if you are again a hotkey person you can just hit shift a it's going to bring up that same exact screen and then we can pick something here so i'm going to pick suzanne which is the monkey i think her origins are from i want to say silent bob something like that i don't remember but she's like blender's mascot so i just added in a suzanne here but now suzanne has nothing to do with mew so when i want to get rid of suzanne all you have to do to get rid of an object is to click it so you just left click you hit x and then delete okay so again we add with shift a and then we'll pick a mesh and as you can see there are other things to add but again we'll talk about that another day object match i deleted my um uh my cube instead of the the monkey so i can just so i could just do add add cube back in is what i would do you can add queue back in and if you are like oh it's no longer in the center so let's say for whatever reason you added it in it's like over here or something and you wanted to put it back in the center where that crosshair is all you have to do is to option g and that clears the location and puts it right back in the middle there because i'm going to get rid of that one so now as you notice when you add in an object so i'm going to add suzanne back in here it's pretty big at least it's bigger than our reference so you're probably like how do we make this smaller all you have to do to make things bigger and smaller is you just click so left click and then you'll hit s for scale and then you just drag up or down as big as you want there's other ways to do this you can scale precisely by typing numbers in you can also scale on different axis so right now i think i'm scaling on the zaxis let's say i wanted to scale on y all you have to do is i'm going to go ahead and click this again i'm going to hit s and i'm going to hit y and that's going to allow me and you'll see on the right side now i'm scaling in the y instead of the zaxis you can do that with any axis that you want to do okay and now let's say we have this and you're like i hate this how do i get back just with any other program to kind of redo or to go back to what you had previously all you have to do is hit command z or control z if you're on a windows computer and now we're right back okay and then let's see what are there some some basics um you probably saw me earlier rotating so again if you want to rotate it's going to be the same deal so you'll just click the object just regular left click then you'll hit r to rotate and then again you just click and drag and it's the same deal with scaling if you want to scale on particular axis so let's say i wanted to rotate on the y then i'm just going to hit y it's going to switch it i guess you can really see in that one let's say i want to do it on z then it then lets me scale it in a different way and now this is x that i just hit so now i'm rotating x now i hit y and i'm back rotating in y okay and again if you're like i don't want this how do i go back you just hit command c and also just to note when you find an angle that is perfect you're like this is a perfect rotation in order to keep it here all you have to do is left click again and that'll set it wherever you want it okay so those are kind of the basics of moving your object in object mode so now let's talk about editing okay so i'm going to get rid of this suzanne head again by clicking x and then delete and um let's go to edit mode i actually don't model with the cube but i'm going to show just the basics of editing with the cube and then i'll show everyone how i usually go about modeling so in order to get into edit mode there's two ways that you can do that of course so either you can click the object and then you can hit tab and that will take you to edit mode you'll know if you did it right because it'll say up here into edit or you can again click the object you can come up here to the tab and then you can just come down here to edit mode and again you'll know if it takes because it'll it'll display it right up here okay now that we're in edit mode you see that things look a little bit different you see like the little points here and the reason why is that blender is a vertex based okay so the way that we make models is by manipulating vertices you can also manipulate edges which are just any lines you can also manipulate faces which are just any faces created by connecting the edges and the vertices but the kind of basis is vertex manipulation and just in general the more vertices that you have on a model usually the more realistic it's going to look so i usually do low poly art as you saw in the real so i don't use a whole lot of vertices but if i wanted to make things smoother if i wanted to make things look more realistic to it's a material world i would just add in more vertices okay that's just something to keep in mind okay so let's talk about manipulating these so in order to do that there's a couple of different ways that you can grab and move your vertices okay so i'm going to talk about first the ways that we can grab so one the simplest way is you can just drag and drop and you'll see i guess it's a little bit hard to see on my screen but you'll see it'll highlight whatever you grab is now to be this yellowish orange color okay so i'm going to do that again so to let go of anything that you grab you just click off so you see it turn back black and then if i want to grab it again i can just drag and drop now there's other ways to grab as well there's something called uh box selecting which honestly looks the exact same but i'll show you anyway so if you hit b it's going to give you this crosshair you can do the same exact thing you just drag whatever you want over whatever you want to grab and drop and you'll see it highlighted okay and then to release we'll just left click and there's one more that you can do which i actually think is really useful called circle select so if you hit c now we're going to get this circle in the crosshair and if you drag it just allows you to kind of grab vertices that are not in the same area so if i wanted to grab like all of mu's foot for example and there's like a bunch of vertices i can just drag this circle select all over it okay and then to release it with circle select you have to press enter and then you press left click to let it go okay so those are the basics for grabbing but i want to show you all something because this is another kind of wall that i hit when i was first modeling is that i went and i grabbed uh i used the cube because it was what was default here so i was like yeah this is great i'm about to model i went i box select here or i dragged to select i grabbed this vertice using g and i moved it and i was like yeah this is great everything's going wonderfully the whole cube is moving and then i turned it and i realized oh the back the back is the back is not it's not moving at all okay so if you want to grab in a way that's going to move your entire 3d object so i'm going to ctrl z or command z to get back here if i want to manipulate all of the vertices on one side another trick that we can do is we can change this to wireframe mode so right now we're in solid view so we see every single face we see every single edge but if we click z it's going to bring up this wheel this option wheel and again don't worry about these other two here we're going to worry about just solid and wireframe today but if we click wireframes it's going to allow us to we get this xray view of our 3d model it's going to allow us to see the reference in the back but it's also going to allow us to grab any vertices that are kind of in the back i just have to say that is so cool i know it's so great i didn't realize there's so many like key commands it's almost like you're learning a whole separate language because i mean it's it's friendly and intuitive in one sense in the sense that you're sort of manipulating this 3d physical world but i imagine it must take a ton of practice to get all of the like key sequences it's uh in like i just keep making mistakes and like undo undo and do yeah is that was that your experience yeah absolutely i mean it took me i mean i've been i think 3d modeling on my own for maybe two years now and i have learned a lot of really cool tricks but there's still there's still so much to learn it's a really cool program though and there's a lot of ways to do certain things like dan and i were kind of talking before the live about how modeling is a lot like code where you know there's multiple ways multiple solutions to get to the same thing so even as we're moving through this if you're seeing something kind of interesting that i haven't talked about or if you just want to try something weird and of course i totally recommend that um the more that you experience experiment the more you're going to discover and the more you're going to find like a way that works for you so definitely feel free to poke around don't feel like you have to do exactly what i'm doing get lost make mistakes i'll make mistakes too it's going to be great it's all going to be great okay so we are in wireframe mode now so again if you missed that we started in solid so to get to wireframe to be able to see the reference and to be able to see through the model all you have to do is hit d and it's going to bring up this wheel here and even these have hot commands so you can hit z4 to go to wireframe if you don't want to learn hot keys all you have to do is click wireframe and that's going to bring us here and when we're in wireframe again the benefit here is that you're able to grab any vertices in the back that you can't see okay so for example if you remember when we were in solid mode and i grabbed that front vertices i only grabbed the front but now if i drag and grab so i'm going to hit g to grab all of the vertices are going to move so i'm just going to do the same thing i'm going to grab and click and drag hit g and i'm going to drag again and hit g so now if i take this back to solid and i turn oh the model is a little bit behind but you can see that v here let me just move this so you can see it perfectly let me grab this whole thing there you go okay i'm gonna put this back in solid and i'm just gonna move this a little bit to the front just so you can whoops grab okay i'm just gonna move it away from the reference a little bit just so you can see it but as you can see when we move the front vertices it moves the back vertices as well so whatever we did in the front corresponded to the back so whenever you want to move like a whole side of something you want to make sure you're in wire frame so that those back vertices that you can't really grab from the front get moved too i'm going to move this back just so you don't get lost okay so like i said though i don't often model with the starting cube i usually like to start with a plane so i think i think now's a good time to get into this mew reference so i'm gonna um i'm gonna start from the beginning i think i'm gonna close out i think i'm gonna close out blender i'm gonna start us up from the very beginning as if i was going to model this that way we can walk all the way through and i will know every single thing that i do and should we do that too do you think or like should i keep mine open like right now i have mine with the two new references and my warped strange mangled cube that i've been really enjoying twisting all the vertices i feel like i have to show it really quickly i'm going to show it people can see that i'm showing my screen you can't see it it's the problem [Laughter] but now i'm back now i'm back to your screen perfect i think do what makes you feel the most comfortable if you like what you've set up so far definitely keep it if you want to just kind of walk through what it feels like from the very beginning do that too whatever feels more comfortable is what i would encourage okay so i'm going to x out of blender now i'm not going to save this but don't need this okay so i'm back on my desktop i am pulling blender back up okay so this is what blender looks like when you open it any recent files that you have will show up here so you can just jump straight into them if you want to do a new file you can just go ahead and over here and click general if you don't want to click anything you're just like i want this box out of my way you can just left click off of it and it's going to put you in that starting screen as well okay so again when you open blender it's always going to start you off with a cube but then you probably notice there's two other things here so this here is a light and this here is a camera i don't i want to explain this but i also don't want to get too deep into this because you use these for rendering and we're probably not going to get to that step just yet but just in the same way that you kind of have to set up your composition in 2d how you have to set up your light to create certain shadows you have to do the same thing in 3d and you use the camera and use the light to do that but today we're not going to use that so i'm just going to get rid of these things so again to do that we're going to just uh left click on the camera i'm going to hit x and then we're going to delete it and we're going to do the same with the light by left clicking i'm going to hit x we're going to delete it and now like i said i don't use the cube either to start some people do some people use the cube to start some people use the sphere to start some people use a single vertices to start you can literally do whatever feels most natural whatever shape feels most natural and also what feels most natural to your model so for example if you're modeling like a snowman you might want to start with a sphere but i usually my bass is that i usually start with a plane so i'm going to delete this cube as well by left clicking hitting x and deleting okay now before we even pull the plane in we just want to make sure we are in the right perspective so remember when you're doing character modeling anything that you need detail honestly most models i would say probably at least in the beginning you're probably going to want to use orthographic modes only so to make sure that we're in orthographic we're just going to hit 5 okay and we're going to know that we're in orthographic because it's going to say it up here in the left okay so now i'm going to hit one to put myself in front view and we're going to bring the mu model in or the new reference i'm sorry so to do that all we're going to do is grab the new reference and drop it right in and another navigation thing that i forgot to mention is that if you want to zoom in and zoom out all you have to do is press the uh the plus icon on your keyboard to go in and the minus icon go out okay so plus and minus and something else i forgot to mention is that in the same way that you can manipulate your objects you can also manipulate your references so as you notice when i first dropped it in the reference was pretty small so i reconciled that just by zooming in but if you're like i want the reference to be bigger you can just click the reference by usual left click you can hit scale the same way that you would with a model you can just drag it big or small as you want okay so we have our reference set up in our front view now we want to at least have one other view i'm going to be honest with y'all i often set up my split screen and i will set it up in front view in right view and then what i usually do is i end up keeping one in a view and then my other view kind of just becomes my whatever view i'm in like i just move around a lot but i'm gonna set it up in the way that what we've been talking about and if you feel like you know the two split isn't what you want you can add in another split you can use just the one view so again whatever feels the most natural for you is definitely the way you should go about modeling there's no like right or wrong here all right so again if we want to create that split we can either go to we can go to view we can come down to area and we can click horizontal split or vertical split or quad view whichever one that you really liked or if you want to do it yourself again you just come up to a corner until you get that crosshair icon just left click and drag all right so now we have our split here and let me make this full screen again okay so i'm gonna make my right side front view again which is already in front view and if you're not in front video and you want to get there you just hit one and i'm gonna make my left side right view by hitting three okay now as you notice once we hit that right view we can't see the reference anymore but we want to be able to see the reference so i'm just going to drag another one in there again and in order to do this drag again you want to make sure that you aren't like grabbing this reference or grabbing anything so just make sure first that you just click off so just a regular left click off of any object and we just drag this new reference right on in here and now again this is like floating in a random spot so if we want it kind of in the middle where the crosshair is we're just going to left click it we're going to hit option and we're going to hit g that's just going to clear the location i'm going to do the same thing with the one over here on the right so i'm going to click it and i'm going to hit option and then i'm going to hit g and that puts it in the back now if we remember from when we had already split things like they're kind of just sitting on top of each other which can create a little bit of like cluster when you do rotate out of a view so if we want to move a reference back i usually move the front reference back so we're just going to click so this is the front reference here just click it and then as you can see once i turn it the way that i'm going to want to move is on this yaxis so i can move it backwards so i'm just going to hit g to grab and i'm going to hit y and then i'll just pull it on back that way they're not oops i'm like hitting my zoom screen here it's not letting me move all the way back okay don't hit g and then i hit y okay and then i hit one to put myself back in so you can see on this left screen here that this is uh the front reference so they're not like cross hair on each other okay so let's put in our object i got all of that by the way i just want to say yes you're doing great okay so i'm going to show you the way that i usually model as like i said i usually use the plane instead of a cube i usually don't like to start even though it sounds i guess kind of backwards i don't like to start with a 3d object in blender even though we're modeling 3d because of the fact that um like i kind of like to get there's just less vertices to worry about it's the short answer um to keep yourself kind of like um free from like manipulating something in the back that you didn't really intend to i like to use the plane because it is just that one so if i'm moving one in the front i know that i'm not accidentally kind of messing up something in the back which is why i use planes but again if you like the cube that you already started you can stick with the cube you can just start with one single vertice you can start with a sphere whatever you can even start with suzanne whatever feels comfortable for you go ahead and start with that so in order to get our object in that we want to start modeling with first we want to make sure we're in object mode so if you're in edit mode right now you can either come up to this tab and click object mode or um you can hit the tap button it'll put you back in object and once we're in object mode we're going to go ahead and add in our mesh by pressing shift a so that's how we add something and then i'm going to choose the plane okay now our plane got set kind of flat on the ground so i'm going to want to turn it so that it is kind of facing the same way that mu is facing in the front here so i'm going to rotate it so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to hit r because it's already grabbed and we know that because it's yellow so i'm going to hit rotate and i always rotate in the wrong direction so forgive me if i do this wrong but we'll figure it out all i'm going to do is hit d because i think we're rotating on the v and hit 90. okay that was the wrong way so i'm going to reset that i'm going to hit r and i'm going to hit x and i'm going to hit 90. there we go and that's going to bring us forward okay so again to get it to flip in the same way that mu is facing we'll just hit r to rotate and then we'll hit x because we want to rotate it on the x and then i'm just going to type 90 and that's going to bring it 90 degrees a 90 degree rotation and then you just hit enter okay now this is huge completely covering mu so we want to be able to see mu so again we're going to go to wire mode by hitting z and then we're going to go to wireframe so now we can see precious mu in the back and then we're going to scale down this plane because it's way too big for me right now so we're just going to hit s to scale and we're just gonna bring it down and i'm gonna get a little bit closer so again if you need to zoom in and out you can zoom in with the plus button you can zoom back out with the minds button all right now what i usually do when it comes to modeling i usually start with the body of anything i do a lot of character models i do a lot of like human models so i'll usually try to start with the body and then i'll move to maybe like the head and then i usually worry about limbs later so we're going to start with the body here i usually start with the very base of the body and then i work up but you can start at the neck and work down whatever feels more comfortable but um for this just for the sake of demoing something i'm going to start at the bottom sorry to interrupt you how do you get the wireframe again i thought i got stuck there you're fine so to get the fire screen you just hit z and it's going to bring that wheel got it got it all right so we are going to start at the base of mu so to do that um with our plane already selected and again we know it's selected because it is that orangy color we're just going to hit g to grab and now if you want to grab with precision you can hit g and then z and that's going to slide it like perfectly kind of up and down if you don't care for it being perfect you just hit g and just like place it freely wherever you want i know it's a little bit hard to see because mu is also white but i'm just going to place it i'm going to place it right about here i'm thinking i might change that but we'll replace it here okay now the way that i go about figuring out where to create new vertices is that i just kind of follow the curves of the body so if things start to curve i add new vertices so i'm going to show you what that looks like so first i'm actually going to set this at the very base of mu i'm not going to include mu's legs in there um so to oh and before we even can manipulate vertices we have to move into edit mode okay so with your plane selected you're gonna hit tab and that puts us into edit mode now if you hit tab and nothing happens a reason why is because it may not have the plane selected so if i hit tab right now i'm hitting it nothing's happening it's because the plane isn't selected so you have to have an object selected so that blender knows what you're trying to edit okay so we're going to hit the plane and then we're going to hit tab and that puts us into edit mode and you know you're in edit mode again because you'll see it up here but also all of the kind of vertices will become more visible in the object all right so the way that i do this again is i just follow the curves of the body and i manipulate the vertices that way so i'm going to start with this bottom one here i'm just going to drag and drop and i'm going to hit g and i'm just going to move it right about here and i'm going to click off and i'm going to do the same over here i'm just gonna move this maybe like right here i'm just gonna adjust this one too let's put it like right at the base okay and i'm gonna grab this top one and i'm gonna move it i'm gonna go pretty wide on this one because why not then i'm just gonna drop it and i'm gonna drag and i'm gonna grab with g and then i'm going to drop it okay so this is our very very bottom now we want to add more vertices and again there's a lot of different ways that you can do this but the way that i do it is through extruding so i'll show you what that looks like the way that we're going to extrude by first we're going to grab these top two vertices and then we're just going to hit e and that's what's going to allow us to extrude up you can really extrude any way that you want but we're going to go up because we are working on mu's body upwards so then we're just going to click to drop it i'm going to click again just to make sure i'm not holding on to any vertices then i'm going to do the same thing that i just did i'm just going to grab this left one gonna hit g to grab i'm gonna move it to align it with mu's body and click off and i'm gonna drag over this one hit g to grab i'm gonna move this vertice and then we're gonna do the same thing so we're just gonna drag we're gonna hit e to extrude and we're gonna go on up and click off to place it click again to make sure you're not holding any vertices you're gonna drag drop hit g and set this one to right about here maybe and do this again g to grab and move okay we're going to repeat this same process over and over until we get up back so i'm going to set this one maybe like right about here kind of where that curve starts to like taper another way again i'm going to drag grab place drag grab place do this again e to extrude put this right about here why not drag grab please drag grab place all right we're going to do that again i like two more times so i hit e to extrude i'll put it right about here i'm going to drag grab place drag grab place and do it one more time click shoot maybe right about here and then drag grab place drag grab place okay so i'm just gonna fix that firstly really quick okay so i'm gonna bring us back into solid mode just so you can see what this looks like so i'm gonna hit z i'm gonna go over here to solid just so you can see it filled in and then if i turn oop sorry i know that this looks like a lot just because our i'm gonna actually really quickly i'm gonna move this one i'm gonna move our left kind of reference back so that it doesn't get in the way when we do turn so i'm going to tab really quickly back to edit mode i'm going to grab our left reference here and i'm just going to rotate a little bit to see which uh which axis i want to move it back on so i want to move it back on this red axis here so that is the x so i'm just going to hit g to grab and then hit x and just move it out the way of this front view so it was about right here kind of blocking you so i'm just going to move it back that way it doesn't get in our way all right i'm gonna put us back in that right view and it wasn't hard to see right now but our model is still in front of that right whoops actually sorry i just realized we didn't do that but that's okay we'll we'll come back we're ready to move it because i don't want us to do too much at once so right now i'm gonna put us back in our front and our right we're going to hit tab to go back to edit whoops first i'm going to click the model so it knows where we're editing and we're going to hit tab to go back to edit and i just wanted to rotate it just so you can see what this is looking like so far so it looks like nothing kind of we have a front body outline but right now it's just that flat plane because that's what i picked because i didn't want the back vertices to kind of get away but now we do want muse body to be 3d i mean that's why we are in 3d why we are in blender today so i'm going to show you how to make it then 3d so what we're going to do i'm going to tap back just so we're in front view and it doesn't have to look at too much stuff all at once i'm going to grab all of these vertices just like this and i'm going to kind of turn it a little just because i want you to be able to see this all right actually i can do it in right view see that's why we split our views so we can see these things so i'm going to put this back in front just so you can see it in real time so i'm going to grab all these vertices and what i'm going to do is i'm going to hit e to extrude and now when we're in our right side so i want you to look at this right panel here if we want to move to the right we have to use the yaxis okay so on this extrude i'm going to extrude on the y so i'm going to hit e and i'm going to hit y and it's just going to bring all of these vertices back so now we have a bit of a body now it's very square but that's okay now kind of a cheat code that i want to show everyone that is going to help when you're modeling anything bilateral so anything like humans animals anything that's kind of mirrored from one side to the other there's actually a mirror it's called a modifier in blender that will help you kind of model the same thing on each side which is really useful for body stuff really useful really again for anything that's bilateral so that you don't have to make changes on both sides as you change one side it'll make a change on another side so i'm going to show you how to do that so again we have our body here what we are going to do is i'm going to click off that i'm going to come over here to our tools panel which i know we haven't talked about yet there's a lot of really useful tools here but i don't want to confuse everyone so today we're only going to really focus on this tool right here called a loop cut and all that loop cut does is that it cuts something all the way around okay so we're gonna and i'll show you what that looks like we're going to click loop cut and we're going to go over our model here and you'll see this line form and there's different ways that we can cut it if i want to cut it around vertically i can do that or horizontally i can do that if i want to cut it vertically i'll set it here and we're going to cut it vertically so that we can mirror one side on the other okay so to do that to lay your loop cut all you have to do is left click now let's say i don't want to write in the middle for whatever reason you can drag it as well i don't want that i do want it right in the middle so i'm just going to click left click right where it is and then hit and then we'll just go back to our just go back to your selection okay so now we should have a cut going right down the middle of mu's body okay so what we're going to do now is going to hit b to go back into wireframe and then we are going to drag everything on the left side of mu's body all those vertices but not the middle ones you want to leave the middle ones alone you just want to grab all the vertices on the left side and we're going to hit x and it's going to bring up our delete panel and we're just going to hit vertices okay so that left side should be gone now which probably is like oh my gosh what's happening i'm scared don't worry it's gonna be great it's gone we're now gonna grab the right side of mu's body make sure you grab make sure you're in wireframe so that you can grab everything including those back vertices we're going to come to this panel over here on the right side we're going to hit this wrench looking thing which is the modifier tab and then and let me move my zoom screen a little bit a little bit in the way you can't see we're going to go to add modifier it's going to bring up a million different things that you can do in blender this is one of the areas where you should definitely explore there's some really really cool things that you can do but for right now all we need is the mirror modifier which is going to be under generate so come down here and hit mirror and bam now mu's body is back on the other side so as i change one thing so if i take this one and i move it it's going to happen on the other side as well okay so as we're trying to get that body perfect now we only have to worry about one side and the other side the mirror modifier will do the rest of the leg work so i'm just curious so that wasn't entirely necessary because we had vertices for the other side but because we were doing it manually it wasn't necessarily like perfectly symmetrical so now by like deleting it mirroring it it's like it's kind of like a cleanup step yeah it's definitely not necessary it's just if you want to keep things perfect which i don't always do this honestly i will usually go in and adjust every single vertice one by one by hand it's totally not necessary so if you want to just have like a quicker way to do that um if you wanted to just model half of it this is the mirror modifier is a really great way to make sure you don't have to do as much work as you would if you do it manually okay so now that we have our mirror modifier on there i just want to note that once you delete that you know i can't manipulate the left side on my own now just whatever happens on the right side is what's going to get kind of moved to the left side okay so just keep that in mind that if you're like i can't grab anything on the left side it's because it's being mirrored so we can only manipulate things on the right side now okay so what we're gonna do is we're gonna start to i think make this body a little bit more realistic now what i also want to keep in mind or just note when it comes to 3d work is that when you are rendering things you don't want to do every single detail in one view because once you move to another view what's it's going to get kind of manipulated and change so you want to capture the shapes of things in these kind of initial stages so just like how we did we captured the shape of the body but i don't want to go in and like add the arms and then like make sure his body is completely like perfect because once i start to model from like the back or model on the side that's going to get changed a lot so make sure you're capturing the shape but don't do every single detail just yet because it's going to get kind of like manipulated kind of later on okay so right now we have like this really square kind of thing going on it's not really that cute and mu as we know is like more rounded so we're going to do first i'm going to take us back into solid mode by hitting z and then going solid just so we can see and like i said earlier the way to get things more realistic the way to get things rounder is by adding in more vertices so that's what i'm going to do now with another loop cut so i'm going to go over here to the panel i'm going to click loop cut and i'm thinking i'm going to cut it in the middle here and then i'm just going to hit click to land it and i'm going to go back here and what i'm going to do is i'm going to scale this a little bit so i'm going to hit s whoops and i'm going to scale it on actually i don't like how that's happening i'm going to let's see hmm okay so instead of doing that i think what i'm going to do instead is i'm going to actually take this front part and i'm just going to kind of like shift it a little bit to the front so that it is like creating a more rounder effect so to do that i'm going to click these vertices here now what you're going to notice that as you click vertices you're going to like lose the other one so if you want to grab multiple you'll left click and then hold down shift so i'm just going to grab this front line here i think and then i'm thinking i'm just going to hit grab i'm just going to kind of like move it in a bit oops sorry my computer is freezing sorry my computer's a little bit old and actually i'm going to go back to wireframe just so i can see i just want to make sure i'm not grabbing anything i don't need to grab so that looks fine i'm gonna go back to solid and it's gonna i like that extra point here for some reason so let's go to wireframe and grab i'm just going to circle select these and hopefully i'm going to unselect these by grabbing oh oh boy how did you circle select again what's the looks like you just hit c c okay got it you get bigger or smaller by um two fingers just dragging up and down so if i want to make this pretty small oh okay and then i'm going to i'm going to drag here and then you hit enter to get rid of the crosshair but like i don't want these so i'm going to click okay and let's see if that'll there we go okay so i'm just kind of like pulling it in just a little to get like that initial like roundness it's not round yet because we're gonna have to add more vertices but i'm just kind of pulling it in just to have it be a little less square you know it's very very square right now and that's not really what we want so i'm going to do the same on this side i'm just holding shift to grab multiple vertices at once i'm going to grab all these and then again i'm just gonna hit grab just kind of just push it in a little bit and we have just like some roundness again it's not gonna be perfect in the beginning but that's okay we don't need it to be perfect in the beginning we just want to try to begin to capture the shape now something i want to note that you might be seeing as you move vertices because of the mirror modifier you're going to start to get gaps kind of here in the kind of center where it was split don't worry about that though we can merge them back together in the end so if you're noticing like splits it's not a mistake it's just kind of like an effect of the mirror modifier okay so it's looking a little funky right now but again that's okay we don't want to add in all the details and have it be super perfect just yet because we need to add in like the head we need to add in the feet and that's going to require like us to keep it basic so that when we attach things things don't get too funky okay so what i want to do is first i just noticed that over here on our right side our model isn't aligned on the right so let's just first move that really quick okay so we can actually move it in edit mode we don't have to go back to object to move it i'm just going to go to wireframe just to make sure that i'm grabbing all of it and then i'm going to hit g and then i'm gonna hit y and then i'm just gonna move it in front again it's not perfect right now we're gonna have to like we're probably gonna have to rotate it because mu's body's got to rotate uh we're gonna have to like remanipulate stuff but that's okay we just want to know where we're at right now so before i do any more kind of like body work again i don't like to get too detailed in the beginning because we have to attach other things so i want us to move to the head so to do that we there's multiple ways we can do this but for me in order to stay kind of like clean or to keep my viewport clean i'll usually kind of hide objects and i i like to model separately you can model different parts all together so if i wanted to take this top part and like grab these faces so i can do a face select i can grab these and i can like extrude and i can start to do the neck of the head i don't like to do that because it can get really like and get really finicky in there and it's just it never really goes super smooth for me when i do that so instead i like to create a whole new object okay so what i'm going to do is i'm going to hit tab to go back into object mode because we want to add a new object okay and what i'm going to do is i'm going to hide the body so to do that up here in the top right corner you'll see steam collection and that has everything that we've put in our scene listed and you can use these little eyes to show or to hide them so uh the plane here or whatever shape you use if you use a sphere it'll say sphere if you use a cube and say cube is going to be our body and we can if you want to rename it just so you can keep track you can double click it and just go ahead and name it body or whatever you want to name it and then i'm going to go ahead and just hide it that way we don't have to worry about it as we do our head okay so to do our head we're going to do kind of same exact thing that we did for the body so we're just going to start by hitting shift a to add in whatever shape you want to use to make the head i'm going to use a plane again just because what i like it's going to put that plane in there but again it puts it flat so when we want to turn it we're just going to hit r to rotate we're going to hit x and then we're going to hit 90 and then we're going to hit enter okay and then we'll hit v if you want to see it wireframe and then we can hit s to go ahead and scale it down and i'm gonna place it i'm gonna hit g and i'm just gonna place it kind of arbitrarily in front of him now before i start moving dan i notice we're at 12 40. and we're not super far in the model but i just want to see how we're feeling time wise how much i don't know i think so i mean i don't have a super strong opinion i'm happy to go for longer the audience seems to be enjoying this i think maybe though it might be good what we could try to do is just get um like a basic version of the head which is kind of similar to what you did with the body we can move quickly through that okay and then and then i think the most important thing is for people then to learn how to like save and even like share it in a way because then um what i would love if for people watching i'm going to do this myself if you work on your mew or whatever model you're making throughout the day or the weekend maybe there's a way we can just share it with each other on social media i mean that could just be a screenshot but even if there's a way to like export um export directly from blender like something i wonder if there's a way i know we're not covering animation but is there a way to like make like really quickly export just like a your model spinning around video but that's like a complicated thing yes there is i mean there's definitely a way to do it as far as is it simple yeah well maybe just an image just an image of the model yeah i can definitely show how to because i've already completed a muse so i can pull to show how to right right we can look at that and then also like even if just export as to like obj or whatever the yeah what file format is because one of the things that i and next time i live stream is try to import it into processing or p5 and see how that goes right for sure okay cool yeah let's do that and i definitely want to make sure that we have time for like questions right right here there are questions yeah so let's move towards wrapping up we can add the head and then we will have like a mewtwo is just like body and head and exercise for the viewer is try to add the feet and i guess the tail would be is like a really high degree of difficulty but try now that would be cool the tail i actually really this was actually the first time i ever modeled the tail and i actually really enjoyed doing the tails the thing that gave me the most trouble is like actually these little arms like they're just so small right harmless an armless mew is okay i think so honestly okay so let's get the head so again we're gonna do the head the same exact way that we did the body so we're gonna start just by grabbing it with g we're going to move it to the base here and then we're going to hit tab to go into edit mode and then we're just going to start manipulating the vertices alright so we're going to drag and grab with g move it i'm going to put it i want to make sure i capture the nose so i'm going to put it all right about here it's going to drag grab drag and i'll put it right about here for now drag grab and then we'll take these top two and we're gonna extrude with e okay and then we're going to drag and grab i might actually lower this i might adjust this later but that's okay this is good for now g to grab again and then we are going to drag again and then hit e to extrude g to grab g to grab and what i want to note so mu has ears and eyes as you can see but these are things that we want to add after we kind of get the base of the head so as you're extruding up and trying to capture you know mu shape i'm gonna actually move these down um don't worry about the eyes and don't worry about the ears just yet we'll add those in a little bit later i'm just gonna move these down just wanna capture more of his curves all right we're going to do the same thing and go ahead and hit e i'm going to do it like right at the base of the ear there i think g to grab g2 grab do this again and right about there g to grab g to grab i'll probably do this like two more times we're going to hit e to extrude again g to grab g to grab extrude one more time and then g to grab place it right about there and g to grab right about there okay so if we go to solid view this is what it looks like it captures the head pretty well i mean there are some gaps kind of down here that we can fix later on when we do more detail or if you want to add it in now you can um it's not something you really have to worry about right now we just kind of have that basic geometry of the head and uh what we're gonna do is we're gonna extrude it okay so we are going to grab all of the vertices here and i just noticed i keep accidentally moving it on the right so don't be like me like i said i tend to kind of focus on one viewport but if you want to make sure that you are using both of your ports just you just want to make sure that this model is in front here you don't necessarily need it just yet because we're not modeling um we're not kind of like getting the details of his side profile yet but if you want to move this right in front we'll go over here and we'll hit g and then we'll hit y just like move the head back actually i'm going to move it i'm gonna move it like right about here so that when i extrude it back i can see how long i want his head to be okay so we have all our vertices selected we're just gonna hit e and now again we're gonna want to extrude to the right so if we're in this left panel to go right if we look up a little compass here we're going to use the y axis okay so we're going to hit e to extrude then hit y and then we're just going to bring that bad boy all the way back to maybe right about here because his head is a little long and then we'll just hit left click just to set it okay so if we turn as you can see we have his long mushroom looking head right now which is great and again the key to making things more realistic is to add more vertices just a standard practice i like to loop cut a couple of times on the body i just did one just so i could show you but with this head i think i'm going to loop cut it a couple of times so i'm going to come back into the front view here i'm going to go over to our panel here go back to loop cut now when you think about your face you know it's like this rounded thing right so there's like a cut like if i cut right down here that will get like the mirroring for both my eyes but i also want to capture like you know this rounded part here and this rounded part here and that's kind of what i think about what i'm doing like a body or a head i'm trying to figure out how to cut it i'm trying to think of like how round i want it to be so because i want to capture the full roundness of his head and i'm going to loop cut it maybe three times we'll see so i'm going to hit this loop cut button and i'm going to click right down the middle and then i want to loop cutting i'm going to loop cut it again why not and then i'm going to loop cut it again over on the right side and i also so remember we're not just modeling in one view right we want to make sure that it's looking good on every angle so i'm also just so we can see it solid i'm gonna bring it back to solid mode i'm gonna loop cut it at least once here i'm probably gonna end up cutting it more but just for now i'm just gonna loop cut it here and i'm just gonna go back to my mouse now you have the option again of doing the mirror modifier if you want to make sure that your head is like completely symmetrical on both sides if you want to do the mirror modifier again all you have to do is hit z to go to wireframe you're just going to pick whichever size that you want to get rid of so if you want to get rid of the left side you'll grab all the vertices on the left just make sure you don't grab that middle kind of partition and then you'll just delete it by pressing x and then vertices and then to add in the mirror we're going to grab everything on the right and then we're going to go to our panel here we'll go back to this wrench looking thing which is the modifier tab we'll go to add modifier and then we'll hit mirror and now it's on both sides and now again you might have some splitting going on uh don't worry about it if you don't like the splitting or if it's making you nervous you also have the option of just not using the mirror modifier which is totally fine and i guess i can i'll show that here with the head just so we can get an idea of like what it's like to not use the mirror modifier i mean it's really just more kind of manually manipulation so okay so from here we have our head again it's looking very boxy so i'm gonna actually come to our right panel now so i can start to move things to match the shape of mu's head so on our left side i'm going to hit z and hit wireframe so i can see where all the points are okay and again i just want to start to kind of match things really to the shape of his head okay so i'm going to start by dragging and selecting and again you want to make sure you're in wireframe because if you're in solid and you grab something it's only going to grab the very front one so whatever is happening on one side is not going to happen other side so make sure you're in wireframe by hitting z and then wireframe and then we're just going to start to drag some things well we're just going to figure it out all right so we're going to drag this i'm going to drag and drop and then hit g to just kind of move i'm going to take things a little bit slow because there are multiple vertices and it's really easy to like kind of tangle vertices and i don't want to do that so i'm just gonna start by getting these to kind of go where i'm thinking i want them to go and i mind you this might look a little bit different to what you're seeing if you decided to keep the modem the mirror modifier but it's the same kind of concept you're just kind of lining up where you think all of the kind of vertices should go for this side of the head i'm just going to grab it drop it grab this move it up a little i think i want to i'm actually gonna shift all these forward just a little bit and then i'm thinking move this one up and again you don't have to do this the exact way that i'm doing it if you're looking and you're like chrissy this varsity should obviously go over here please definitely do that you want to do it in a way that feels comfortable and feels like whatever makes sense kind of to you so i'm going to put this one here i'm going to quickly move these up so that i don't tangle this one because i want this one to kind of come over here but it's still a little low so i'm going to move all of these up again i'm just going to bring this one in here i'm going to bring this one kind of up here i'm gonna take these and bring them in close it to the head and then let's see let's take this one down now remember we don't have ears yet and the ears are kind of blocking part of the head so you just want to kind of assume where his like headlines i guess would fall so i'm going to take this one and put it here i'm gonna take this one just kind of put it whoops i didn't mean to grab all those i just want to grab this one kind of place it here i'm gonna bring this one just a little bit back i'm gonna bring this one here i'm gonna bring this one maybe like right about there we can make some adjustments and now again as you can see like there's like gaps that the vertices can't quite cover because we don't yet have enough but that is also something that we can kind of fix later on okay so we just moved things around you may have seen things kind of happen in the front view but i'm going to change this to solid just so you can see it so it's looking pretty good it looks like his head i'm going to view but as you can see it's pretty wide so we're gonna have to fix that but that's okay but we're starting to kind of capture what his head like the shape of the head from both the front so if we take this back to solid you see it's still capturing what it looks like in the front and if we change this one to wireframe as well it's all kind of captured on the side as well of course we're having some proportion issues but that's okay because right now we're just trying to get shape all right now from here i want to have it to where we have something that at least looks decent before we go so let's let's do like a little bit of detail work on the head again i usually don't try to do too too much because in order to connect the head and the body you kind of want the you don't want the mesh to be too unbalanced when it comes to vertices so if i have like a hundred vertices on the head but then i only have like 20 vertices on the body connecting it might get like a little bit funky but for the sake of just like getting us familiar with modeling and like kind of making pushing things around to make it look like what we're trying to model i'm gonna go ahead and do just a little bit of detail work to get this head looking a little bit better okay so from here this is definitely an area where i encourage you to go off the rails move things as you feel they should be moved i'm gonna make adjustments and i'll try to talk through what i'm doing but honestly it's going to look a little bit sporadic because that's kind of the way that i model i just kind of like try things and then see how it looks delete it if it doesn't look so good try other things but this is definitely the area where you just kind of want to freeform and like experiment and see what's working and kind of not working okay so for me as i'm looking at this head it's just looking like it just looks very alien it's looking kind of wide it's not really like as round as i would want it to be so what i'm thinking is now mind you i don't have the mirror modifier on so i have to keep in mind that whatever i do on one side i'm gonna have to do on the left side if you decide to keep the mirror modifier you're a little bit in luck because as you adjust one side it's just gonna automatically do that for you so let's see again i'm looking at this head it's looking a little funky and it's looking a little flat so i think first i'm going to try to kind of round out the front now something i haven't shown just yet is that so far we've been manipulating vertices and i think i talked about this just for a second but if you want to manipulate whole faces or edges you have the option to do that as well so if you come up here and you look right next to our edit tab we have these three different boxes here and this tells us which kind of editing mode or selecting mode that we are in so so far we've been in vertex select so if you have this selected you're going to see all the vertex present but if we want to manipulate some edges we can hit edge select and that's going to show us all the edges and let's say we want to manipulate a whole face then we'll click face select and it's also going to then allow us to click faces okay so edges will let us just click the edge and then vertices is going to show you to click those vertices now the benefit of vertex select is that it's going to be the most detailed so if you're trying to get in and like make really small kind of adjustments i would suggest sticking to vertex if you want to make kind of like wide things so usually when i'm trying to like round things out i oftentimes like to come into face select and i'll just kind of grab like some middle things and again if you want to grab more than one thing just hold down shift and like usually when we're rounding things out like the kind of front of the sphere is a little bit further than the rest so i'm just gonna grab this i'm gonna hit y and i'm just gonna bring it forward a little bit just kind of round round that part out okay so we're getting a little bit of roundness here now these um these sides here are giving like they're getting a square they're serving a square right now but we want round again so i'm also just going to like kind of grab these now another trick to grab things kind of more quickly if you know that you want to grab like this whole line you can just hold shift and double click and it's just going to grab everything kind of in that loop and then i'm going to hit grab and now i did something funky with the way that i laid so as you can see it's kind of like pushed in and out and this is something that i will have to fix later if you're getting some of those like funkiness where your mesh is kind of like overlapping the way that you'll want to fix that is just going to hit b in wireframe and now i know this looks a little bit scary but it's just going to show you you just want to like look and just kind of see what is what are the ones that are kind of like inverted so if i get close here if you can see right here oh this point sorry i'm trying to get close in there it's actually not it's this point i'm just kind of looking to see what part is kind of inside of each other also going to like i just switched to edge mode so i can see what the lines are let's see i think this line which i'm having some trouble grabbing is just like a little bit it's kind of going over this other line here so i'm just going to quickly just kind of bring it out so i don't want it to be in the way i'm going to see how that feels and again this is the part where i'm saying it gets really funky and like if you're like chrissy you should do something else like try whatever works for you here because you want to try to get these vertices to not be on top of each other like this like i'm having this like concave like funky thing going on here that is like not what i want at all i'm gonna go back into wireframe just to see what is overlapping i think this one i'm just gonna bring this a little bit in and bring this one a little bit out just see if i can try to like correct some of these things dan how are you doing over there how's yours looking mine's mine's looking kind of interesting i i'm going to bring it up on the screen so people can see really briefly it's not as it's not as beautiful as yours this is i mean looking very very funky right now oops one thing actually that's happened to me um and i i'm going to show this i i actually there is a way that i can have you see what i'm doing by like sending it but back into the zoom meeting but but let me just explain it so when i'm i'm in my um front orthographic view and as soon as i go to rotate it like takes me somewhere like really not rotate as soon as i go to like a spin so that i can look at it from a slightly different angle it takes me to like this weird other place like far far away from the model oh no oh okay i'm showing it to people so maybe maybe somebody if somebody you don't need to answer this for me right now figured out but i'm just showing it if somebody in who's watching the live knows i'm sort of demonstrating it because it doesn't happen for me on my left panel like that works as expected like like where it thinks the center of the world is or something when i start to spit i'm wondering there could be a couple different things going on i think i'd have to see it yeah i can work that out with you later but i think you know i think we're in like a pretty good place like i mean you could probably um i'm i'm moving it back to your screen now work on like the detailing here like forever yeah i mean this is this is the hard part to i guess kind of show because this takes forever like because vertices get lost vertices do things that you did not want it to do and it really takes a lot of just like manipulating for a while so i think i would love i would love to show and walk us through getting through them all because i know probably right now like this looks like nothing i don't know but i do want to show you kind of how to export yeah and also um i can just yeah i said oh maybe i can show maybe i can do something after to walk us through like after like a different live stream or like a video or something i can show kind of better how to detail because trying to do it quickly is kind of what got me into this anyway yeah well i think you know detailing to me also feels like that's like a huge like subject unto itself yeah this is like incredible i mean i was i mean i've never made a model like this before and i was totally able to do it which is kind of unbelievable oh people are answering my question now um so but i do think that's what's really important for us to show is i mean obviously i see in mine like there's like file save yeah so i will show kind of the difference between saving and exporting and also really quickly i think i saved my mew before i connected things so let me see if i can let's see what this looks like oh yeah i'd love to see the um the finished view yeah i think i moved it to a different file sorry you're like seeing my whole desktop right now okay i can switch to mine i'm switch to mine for a second while you're looking so people said i should hit preferences navigation orbit around selection tell me when you're ready i'll switch it back to yours okay let's go maybe your anchor point is not center click shift s cursor to world origin cursor to world origin no oh okay let's see let's try one more right marcos writes and this is exactly how i feel for beginners like myself making two boxes with rounded corners is a victory i totally agree like i got this sort of like lumpy frumpy little like beginnings of a mew and uh bar and i'm just like so excited to see where it goes yay i'm glad i wanted to be able to walk everyone through but it is kind of like a lot for the time that we have but i'll do my best yeah and also you know one thing that that i don't know if anyone asked this but um certainly i'm curious is like where like what are what are you know resources that other people that you found useful as your learning blender like if people want to learn more do more is there uh a book that you looked at a website i mean there's um are there recommendations yeah so first i mean youtube is definitely my best friend um a couple one modeler i can think of off the brain i think his name is olaf 3d hat i think has some good tutorials for modeling but also if you're really interested in animation um i can't think of any more off the head i can try to gather some things after just look through but there if you just um like youtube like uh 3d model humans or yeah 3d model or character modeling or modeling for 3d printing you'll get some really good things also on the blender website they have some references built in as well they have a whole library that you can go through that has some really great like tutorials and tips and um one other thing is like i you know uh coding train regular viewers probably know about this but if you're new here because you came because you want to learn about blender you want to learn more about chrissy's work um we do have a discord so i think if i press this button here the link to the discord is going to go into the chat just did um and so that could also be a place we could create a blender channel in there um you know people could sort of like share resources or ask questions or even if like you know we could share some like model files and different things there as well i mean chrissy you're welcome to try to obligate you to suddenly joining our discord answering everybody's question but if you want to pop in there and like that's also a place where people who want to go further with us could reach out to you for sure um we could we can switch back okay look at that it looks a little funky uh the reason why these are um pink right now is because these are actually the reference photo but i move them off my desktop originally they were on my desktop and then i moved it off my desktop and then i moved it back so the file path just kind of got messed up so i'm just going to hide those we don't have to worry about that okay so this was like kind of a beginning stage for the mew um right now it has the mirror modifier on it on both of these and but it's all um none of these are connected right now so i can just really quickly show you what i would do to first apply the mirror modifier and then kind of sew the head back together in the body and then like connect i i think i'll sure okay hopefully i can do that quick so then i can go all the rendering stuff okay so again right now everything is separate um let's start with maybe sewing the head back together so i'm gonna hide body i'm gonna hide the split on the head all this good stuff okay so we have our head now in order to apply a modifier you have to be in object mode which is what we are in right now and then once you apply it it's basically it just doesn't it's not going to mirror anymore so we are at that point like we have our head it's looking decent we're just going to hit apply so now all of these vertices are their own again so if i do something on the right it's not going to affect the left anymore so to sew this up honestly i'm pretty sure there's a quicker way to do this and like i feel like i've done in the past but i can't remember that way so i'm going to show you the way that i do remember the way that i merge kind of uh vertices together is i'll just click one and i'll click its buddy and i'll hit option m and then at center and i'll just go and be a surgeon and stitch mew right on up so this is what you can do to if that mirror modifier left you with a split you can just sew him right back up by doing this and as i'm doing this i'm realizing that if i'm going to do this for the head and the body we're probably going to take a little minute but i do want to show what it is like to connect so i'm just going to sew these bottom ones really quick and then i'll try to don't want that there's some interesting suggestions in the chat that people are saying also the way that they do this like solar liner writes you don't need to uh there's a merge mode in the mirror modifier that merges vertices and edges that are close to the mirror plane oh sleep and luis says select clipping in the mirror and select the middle vertices move them to center i don't know what that means but it sounds very it sounds like the right idea i already applied this modifier so i have to go back but those sound like really great yeah they sound like really great and simple selections it's the same thing as with coding there's always like in javascript especially there's like 10 ways to do the same exact thing so and everybody has their own sort of like tricks and style thank you for putting those suggestions in there because i will that will save me a lot of time um again i did want to show how to do that but i want to make sure that i get in how to render and all that good stuff so i'm going to skip to that i'm so sorry yeah i think that's great okay there's no way that this well first of all there's no way that this single live stream could comprehensively cover everything there is so i think i just want to show everything i want everyone to be able to have their mind but what we what i think what's really amazing that you're doing is just like i wouldn't have even known where to even start i can't believe that i've already made a model and so like obviously there's you know it's what's the like a mile wide an inch deep but i've got that wrong whatever the expression is you know we've got that basic and there's obviously you can go super deep into blender and and a couple people also posted some of their uh youtube channels that they um that they suggest for so one of the things that i can also do is this when this video gets archived the uh it'll be on youtube but i can always add an update to the video description so if there are additional resources or things that we want to add we'll just put that in the video description perfect okay so if you saw like the kind of screenshot or the image of like the final mew that was on like the coding train page or on my page this is what the model was so this is my finished one um again i usually do low poly work i usually keep things actually lower poly than this but i wanted the mu to be a little bit smooth so there was a couple things i did to do that but here is my little mew um i added if you're seeing these boxes um i just added some plain so i can create like a stage to uh take a picture in that's a whole other doing background stuff is like a whole other thing in blender that i can't really get into right now but if you're wondering like why are these huge planes there that's that's just why you don't need to add planes right now okay so let's say you know you you got it you work through all of the manipulating of the vertices your mu is looking good you want to save it that's first and foremost we want to make sure we save so to save you're just going to come up here to file you just go to save as and then you can save the file whatever you want to save it as i saved it as new final i usually save as i move through every process so like when i finished which i guess i didn't do that with the oh what what i did like when i had all my finished pieces well first i'll save it in the very beginning and then as i have all my finished pieces i'll save that as something before i connect things just in case i messed something up and i'll save it again after connecting and i'll save it again once i have like my scene set up you want to make sure you save and then you just save it to whatever folder whatever box you just hit save a splendor file if you want to make this like a obg file i'm in obj file for putting and processing or any other type of file you'll then go to export and you'll see all the different types of files here so you have obj right here you have stl stl is good for 3d printing and a whole other range of files okay so again if you want to save saving is one thing and then exporting is another thing exporting is what you'll use to put it in another kind of software now rendering is its own third thing so like i said in order to render so to take a picture of it you have to have a camera okay so that's what this little doohickey is right here this is my camera that i had set up um i can't well just to make sure everyone knows how to add a camera since we deleted it in the previous one i'll do that with us so i'm going to delete this and we're just going to hit shift a make sure you're in object mode if you're not in object mode you just wanna hit tab to get back to object mode hit shift a and then you can come down here to camera now sometimes when you add the camera it's like already i'm pretty much every time when you add a camera into a scene it's like already kind of at this like funky angle it's just like why are you rotated slightly i don't really understand this if you want to clear that you can just hit option r you can hit option g to put it in the center if it's not in the center already and then as you can see it's pointing downward so we just want to rotate it so i'm going to rotate it on the y i'm going to do whoops sorry i'm going to rotate it on the x 90 degrees so that it's gonna be like facing our precious mu okay and then you move things the same way that you move a mesh you can move the camera so you just hit g to grab and you hit y and we can move this in front okay now our camera has its own separate view from what we are seeing in the viewport so viewport view and camera view are different so if you want to know what your camera is seeing there's two ways you can do this one is you can just come to view and um you can go sorry if we go to view you go to viewport if you hit camera or if you hit zero you'll see what your camera is seeing now once you rotate though it's going to instantly take you out of that so if you want your camera to kind of move with you there's a way you can lock that so to do that we're gonna first hit n it's gonna bring up this panel right here okay and we're gonna make sure we're in this view tab and we're gonna hit lock camera to view okay so then we're gonna hit zero again to go back to the camera mode what button did you press to bring up that tab to lock you'll hit n so as in number yeah and then you'll go to the view tab and then you hit lock camera to view and then now when we rotate or as we move the camera moves with us so this is really good for making sure that like when you're ready to take your picture but it's at the exact kind of angle that you wanted and so if i want this like bird's eye view like mew or maybe i want this like side view because i think he looks adorable for the side i can go ahead and just set that right on up and whatever is within the um orange or yellow kind of outline is what you're going to get in your camera there's different ways that you can adjust your camera which again we don't have time to get in here but there's a whole camera panel over here on the right where you can adjust um your camera we can adjust the dimensions and all that good stuff we're not going to worry about that right now so in order to render then so we have our camera set up at the angle that we want um i do want to know that if we don't have light in there your picture is not going to show so you want to make sure to add a light i already have a light set up because again this is my like final scene type of thing so you'll be able to see what happens here but just know that if you go to render if you do the same exact steps that i do here and it's just like completely dark it's because you don't have a light and if you want to add light you can add do shift a again and there's a bunch of different types of lights here you can just kind of arbitrarily throw one in for now just so you can have some light around me for when you take your picture okay so to render there's a couple different ways that you can go about rendering as well i mean the simplest way is you can come up here to the render tab and you can just hit render image and now my computer is a little bit slow because it is old but i will show you i got mine i'm gonna switch i'm gonna show it to people wait everybody here's my view and mine just popped up it's pretty here we go back to yours yours is much nicer back and forth everybody really simple again just wall and floor and color just so he can like be in something nothing fancy but that's why you're seeing like the little teal colors because i put a color onto the wall now so you have your picture this is what it looks rendered what you'll do to save it is it'll just go up here to image and then save as and then i'll just name it i'm just gonna put on my desktop and save it and then when i go to my desktop we have the image right here and this is what you can use to share you can always just take a screenshot but the screenshot is not going to be as good as a resolution the benefit of rendering is that you're able to up the resolution um i could make it like better than this if i wanted to i can change the dimensions of it um when i want to animate that's how you'll capture it through rendering so yeah when you're ready to export your picture that's all you have to do you just want to make sure you have a camera and you have a light in there and you just set your scene up however you want so if um this is amazing by the way i'm so excited we just i don't know why that step to me was just so exciting to see the sort of like high quality render um which especially when working in like real time graphics with 3d and processing or p5 generally you don't have that sort of like level of resolution um so i i guess as an ex i guess one thing so let's think about this for a second if people make their own models that they learn to make from today and they want to share it with you or me or both of us um so that um obviously we have rendering the image is perfect um do you would you like is instagram or twitter like what's um what's a good and should we should we come up with a um a plan a hashtag um oh hashtags are cute let's see so i'm gonna pull up um well i'm not logged into my twitter right now it's gonna post mine but if you do want to post it um either to twitter or to instagram and to share it for me to see i'm chrissy bermidge on both okay so i would love to see it please feel free to tag me i would love to see your mew and also if you have any questions feel free to reach me on there as well i'm happy to answer questions um i'm pulling it up so it's on my screen now i'm pulling up your twitter which has um when you by the way if you want to see the reel again it's right there i posted the reel on my twitter which chrissy has here at the top of hers as well um let's pull up your instagram also so people can see it alright and there's mew there's exactly that image yay perfect so yeah please feel free to share please feel free to experiment feel free to ask questions i'll make sure to what one one thing that came up in the chat like so um so we can we can answer maybe um we we we should probably wrap up like let chrissy and everybody have a break because we've been going for a very long time thank you so much for spending so much time with us it's like incredible the amount of um uh information that you were able to pack into such a like one singular live stream i know if i if i had my whole weekend free i'd just be uh which you know would be stuck in like in blender i think yeah definitely have to find some more time um somebody a couple people mentioned in the chat um you that that you can shade it with smooth on or smooth shade yes so you can what is that so let me get out of this rendering here then go back and blender so i usually don't use smooth shading because i do low poly but if you want to you can just and let me um let me add in like a different like model because this is already pretty smooth or let me just go back to one of the other ones that i had open it's gonna be like oh oops i forgot that i moved it okay so like this one for example uh let's say that i wanted to just make like i wanted to render where it's not so boxy or i want it to the shading to be smoother just automatically what you can do is just right click whoops first sorry we're going to tab into edit i'm just going to right click that amaryllis writes um this stream was the best as i have a good confidence of making low poly the stream gave me next level confidence um and and the people in the chat are are suggesting i think i suggested it if people are thumbs upping it our hashtag is mewtrain so mewtrain i love that i love that so yeah okay so with that question you have the choice of um having with it being flat or have it being smooth so i've been doing flat because again i do low poly stuff but if you want it to be smooth just right click whoops make sure you're on the object and then right click and then hit just shade smooth you see it on oh yeah wow yeah the way that i made the mute though um smooth in that final reference was actually a modifier so i can show that as well let me move my zoom screen again it's in front so i'm just going to take this head here i'm going to go to the modifier tab and i'm just going to apply that because i don't really need it anymore and then the way that i did that was i went to da da da da da where is it subdivision surface it automatically just kind of smooths things out for you ah okay and then you just hit apply so in your um the final mu version that you made that's the stuff that you that you added yeah because i like like i said i love low poly and i wanted those kind of like planes in there so i usually do the subdivision surface but if you just want it to be completely round you can go ahead and just switch right over to shane's food um so funny story is that when i first was experimenting with some new 3d printers that we got at nyu my kids asked me to 3d print a pikachu and so i found some model that i online and i just like downloaded it and 3d printed was great is there are is there like anything you have to keep in mind like could that mew that you made be 3d printed or do you have to like conform to some specification like you can't have the model do this twist or this turn i mean it probably depends on what 3d printer you're using i'm sure i'm uh opening up a huge can of worms here but in in the basic sense if people want to 3d print what they've made is there anything any extra steps they should think about yeah so i'm still honestly trying to figure this out myself because i i started modeling in 2018 but then that first model that i made it was to be printed but i had someone else printed i just bought my first printer last year and what i am learning is that there definitely are things that you have to keep in mind um just off the brain some things i'm thinking about are like inverted vertexes so like how i had some of those like when i was playing around with that initial model and i had some vertexes that were kind of like under other vertexes that can cause errors but honestly there are software's out there already that people have made like open source things that will correct your model for you so at this stage if you're like i want to print things right away but i'm not sure if my model is kind of up to par for that you can i can give you a link to one of them so that you can just pop your model in it and it'll correct things for you and you can go ahead and print it but yeah there definitely are things that you have to learn about on that front but that's like definitely a whole other beast to kind of tackle and and people in the chat are are agreeing with you that the low poly aesthetic has a beauty all of its own and um uh someone else wrote and oh yeah a vedang writes voxel art also looks cool as well which i would agree yeah i mean i think there's in many ways sometimes you can get so wrapped up into creating something that's photo realistic or so highly detailed that you can sort of like lose sight of your artistic intentions and a lot of ways you can express yourself or be more creative with through abstraction and through um like lowering of the resolution so and i definitely see that in your work i mean the i mentioned this to you before we came on the the figure pointing at the sort of like planetary like orb that's just uh filling the space with stars and light is just so um to me this is so beautiful and there's not there's no color there there's no there's no fine details but there's something about um the energy that emanates from that simple um scene that's like really impactful thank you um uh marcos writes usually 3d printer software converts 3d models to what a 3d printer can easily read so yeah so it sounds like that's also along the same lines of step of putting it in um what is it called oh gosh i cannot remember slicing software i forgot it i'm forgetting what it's called but i use something called cura where it's like once you make the model oh i've used that yeah yeah you then and then you can correct things in there as well so yeah awesome well i think this is a nice point to wrap up um if everybody in the chat could give a little love and thank you to chrissy for spending so much time with us today i mean i i feel like i often teach new things to people on the coding train but and so i don't usually get to experience the other way around it was like such a thrill to have like something that i really don't know anything about and to try to follow along and i'm i'm so excited as soon as i get off i'm gonna share my model on twitter and all of that and i hope that all of you will also share um if you want to learn more about chrissy's work again um the link to her website is i'm i'm pulling it up right now oh you don't see my screen i'm gonna switch to that i'm pulling it up um is uh is in the video subscription chrissyprimage.com you can go to um her instagram as well as twitter make sure our hashtag is mewtrain hopefully no i'm i'm just gonna like uh i shouldn't be doing i'm gonna i'm just gonna switch off my uh screen for a second because i'm just gonna check no results from utrain so that's good i always worry like i'm gonna pull up something on twitter and by accident i don't wanna pull up something right without looking at it first so you can see you can see that there's no results from utrain so we can fill the universe with beautiful 3d models made in blender and utrain and i will i'm certainly making a commitment to in a followup stream try to see if i can take my obj model that i exported and bring it into processing or p5 which i know that will be of interest to people and um you know we can always consider us as sometime in a future date if chrissy wants to come back and show some additional steps of course you're more than welcome to do that um i can also make my um my final mew available like the file the obj file so if you guys want to go ahead and start playing around with it and processing i'll make that available that's a great idea yeah so we'll that's a great idea and i'll try to um figure out you know just look for in the video subscription but certainly if you join the discord if we have a webpage or github repo or something where we put some of these materials um i'll make sure to link to that for sure um let me also just briefly let me i'm gonna check um i think if i pull up the live stream i've saw so many donations come in i'm just gonna pull this up and it looks like oh i i wonder if we either exactly reached the goal of 500 or we went over it and youtube just doesn't list it it's awesome so that's wonderful thank you everyone thank you everyone i'm i'm looking for my train whistle which is my way of very strange way of saying thank you to people that's wonderful that we're able to support please um if you want to learn more about the tender foundation or if you want to you know get involved or volunteer make a donation you know check out their website it's thetenderfoundation.com and i believe also um tender foundation is on instagram as well so if you want to i don't know that it makes sense to share our 3d models with the tender foundation but why not you know give them some love if you make a 3d model um that you were inspired from this live stream um so that i think really wraps them i'm almost
