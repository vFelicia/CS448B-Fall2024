00:00 - it is Friday March seventeenth here in
00:04 - New York City at New York University I'm
00:07 - a little bit concerned about the audio
00:08 - today because when I was trying to
00:10 - monitor it there was a little bit of a
00:11 - glitch but I'm seeing lots of green bars
00:14 - move up and down as they're supposed to
00:15 - so please as soon as you see me and hear
00:18 - me and there's no audio problem let me
00:19 - know in the chat really tired today so
00:27 - um what's happening this is my name is
00:30 - Dan this is the coding train it is a
00:33 - weekly live stream on YouTube where I do
00:37 - a variety of different things from that
00:41 - range from showing projects that other
00:42 - people have made having guests doing
00:45 - tutorials coding challenges on various
00:48 - other things everything's good and so I
00:54 - have a big project that's coming up and
00:57 - i think i may have improperly mislead
01:01 - people that I was really getting started
01:03 - with this project today and I'm just a
01:06 - little bit behind or I was kind of wrong
01:08 - about the dates but let me let me pull
01:12 - up let me let me talk about what I want
01:13 - to talk about here so I'm teaching a
01:15 - class called intelligence and learning
01:22 - it is part two of a course that just
01:25 - finished up which was about physics and
01:27 - animation and this class is you know
01:33 - ostensibly about machine learning but
01:36 - I've been thinking about this a lot
01:38 - reading a lot of stuff we come over here
01:42 - for a second okay so there is the term
01:48 - artificial item of intelligence that's a
01:53 - term there was the term machine learning
01:59 - and then there is also the term deep
02:04 - learning okay maybe that artificial
02:11 - maybe there's something
02:12 - this I don't know that may be right I
02:20 - feel like I was either watching a video
02:22 - or reading somebody's paper for they
02:24 - heard making a similar diagram know who
02:26 - to credit this from but I probably got
02:28 - it wrong anyway but so one of the things
02:30 - that I want to do in this course is not
02:33 - simply focus on any one of these
02:35 - particular topics this is not a deep
02:38 - learning course which is only about you
02:40 - know say tensorflow and deep neural
02:42 - networks and deep deeper and deeper and
02:44 - deeper neural networks this is not a
02:47 - course just about machine learning this
02:49 - is not of course just about artificial
02:50 - intelligence for me this is part two of
02:54 - the nature of code and the central theme
02:56 - of the nature of code is looking at the
03:00 - beauty and wonder of things in the
03:02 - natural world and creating pieces
03:05 - writing code that emulates those things
03:07 - for art interaction you know etc fill in
03:14 - the blank and so I want it for this
03:19 - course I want to continue as that thread
03:21 - and in many ways I'm not so concerned
03:23 - with accuracy and I'm more you know my
03:31 - goal in this course is not to create a
03:34 - to teach how to make a self-driving car
03:38 - that works perfectly but to a way of
03:41 - creating software agents that have the
03:43 - appearance the illusion perhaps of
03:45 - having intelligence of making decisions
03:47 - so there's a lot a lot that goes with
03:50 - that so I don't know it's going to sew
03:52 - all most like the illusion it's very
03:54 - similar to the approach that I take with
03:56 - Craig Reynolds steering behaviors which
03:59 - is this idea of creating agents that
04:01 - appear lifelike and improvisational and
04:04 - so if we can give these things we
04:07 - program and move around the screen a
04:08 - brain to make decisions they can make
04:12 - smart decisions they can make not so
04:13 - smart decisions they can make random
04:15 - decisions what is a wide range of
04:17 - possibilities so this is the central
04:19 - theme of the course I'm hanging up right
04:21 - now because my plan was real
04:24 - starts next week and I think I said I
04:26 - said next week last week because nyu has
04:30 - a spring break this week and so my
04:31 - course doesn't actually start this week
04:33 - in my mind it was next week but there's
04:34 - a pretty good between so I got a little
04:36 - confused then there was this big
04:38 - snowstorm and I know everything and I
04:42 - got all this you know everything is gone
04:45 - haywire in my brain and in my schedule
04:47 - in my time but this is what I'm thinking
04:50 - about now what could be a first step to
04:53 - this I'm just jumping right in know how
04:55 - I always spent all this time doing on
04:56 - this introductory stuff I'm actually on
04:58 - a little bit of a tighter schedule today
05:00 - and i only have until like 12 or 1230
05:02 - this is a shorter shorter session
05:05 - although I think I've set myself up like
05:08 - I've sent wrong expectations my plan was
05:10 - always like this is one or two hours
05:11 - every week now suddenly I do these like
05:13 - three hours then come back for like last
05:15 - week I had live street I live stream for
05:17 - five and a half hours on Friday this is
05:19 - not sustainable much just as much fun as
05:22 - I have doing that so anyway today's
05:24 - gonna be a little bit shorter there's a
05:26 - possibility that i'll have a bonus some
05:28 - bonus time but but anyway I'm here right
05:30 - now so this is this is the sort of
05:34 - central topic now what could be a place
05:37 - I'm coming over here what could be a
05:39 - place to start so here's what everyone
05:41 - is requesting and asking for always from
05:46 - in in messages I get everybody seems to
05:51 - be the most interested in this topic
05:54 - neural networks I hope I mean I think
05:57 - what why is that well number one is
06:01 - there has been an explosion in the last
06:05 - few you okay I'm not even kidding you
06:09 - right now can you guys hear that hold on
06:15 - that's the fire alarms going off I'm
06:17 - gonna have to leave by the way I gotta
06:19 - get my phone
06:20 - I don't know if I should just leave this
06:22 - streaming and like leave the mic on for
06:25 - as long i agree i can stream from my
06:26 - phone can you guys hear that okay you
06:35 - probably can hear that now and in the
06:36 - hallway Shh alright alright guys I
06:45 - cannot believe this but I I'm gonna have
06:49 - to just turn this off I don't think I
06:51 - should leave the streaming computer on
06:53 - and so i guess i will be back at some
06:56 - point later today I'm gonna it keeps
06:59 - like stopping but it's going i'm gonna
07:00 - turn off my I assume it so what time's
07:02 - it 1115 it's probably a fire drill but
07:07 - anyway I'm turning off my mic maybe I'll
07:09 - live stream from my phone or I'll come
07:11 - back at some point later today I'll
07:12 - follow me on twitter i got to stop
07:14 - talking follow me on twitter at
07:15 - Schiffman ok goodbye
