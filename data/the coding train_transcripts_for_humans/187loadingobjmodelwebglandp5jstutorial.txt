00:00 - hello here we are in this video I'm
00:03 - going to attempt to take this
00:04 - three-dimensional toy train and put it
00:08 - into my computer somehow not really and
00:11 - the topic here is that I want to this is
00:13 - in my WebGL 3d p5.js serious I want to
00:16 - look at load model so what if I had a
00:18 - file on my computer that had all the
00:21 - geometry for a train in it or anything
00:23 - else so you might know about 3d modeling
00:25 - maybe you use some type of 3d authoring
00:27 - environment to create your own 3d miles
00:30 - models this little piece just fell off
00:32 - um maybe you you go to a website and you
00:35 - found somebody else's 3d model to
00:37 - download but what there are lots of
00:40 - different file formats so that's sort of
00:41 - the question but the file format that
00:44 - you want to look for to import a 3d
00:46 - model into p5 is obj let's go over the
00:49 - computer and see what happens alright so
00:52 - on this computer I already have a file
00:55 - called Train obj thank you - Bram for
00:58 - helping me find this file Bram in the
01:02 - patron group I'm gonna I'm actually just
01:04 - look at this file look at this so this
01:06 - was originally made in Rhino that's like
01:07 - a comment and look at all this stuff
01:09 - that's actually what's in a 3d model
01:11 - it's just V all of these vertices these
01:14 - are all the XYZ coordinates so you can
01:16 - make your own geometry algorithmically
01:18 - with primitive 3d shapes or begin shape
01:20 - vertex and shape but here's a file
01:22 - format that has a lot of vertices in it
01:24 - already that's I love looking at that so
01:26 - how do I get that into p5 well I still
01:29 - have a kitten in this let's leave the
01:31 - kitten here just maybe we'll see what
01:32 - happens with that I'm going to make a
01:34 - variable called train and in preload I'm
01:36 - going to say train equals load model so
01:39 - the load model function is just like
01:41 - load image loads image data load JSON
01:44 - loads JSON data load mile model loads a
01:49 - three-dimensional model and there's no
01:51 - reason why I couldn't replace now box
01:53 - with drawing that model which is with
01:56 - the function model train let's see what
02:00 - happens oh shoot
02:07 - all right I failed here what went wrong
02:12 - uncaught maximum cost I render GL
02:15 - flatten mm-hmm okay so I have figured
02:19 - out why this broke and unfortunately it
02:22 - broke because that model that I'm
02:23 - loading the train model is actually
02:24 - quite a complex one there's no reason
02:26 - why it can't work and it could it should
02:28 - at some point work there's actually at
02:30 - the time of this recording there is a
02:32 - github issue on the p5.js repo so if
02:34 - you're watching this in the future
02:36 - go and check this maybe it's been
02:37 - resolved but the way that I fixed it
02:39 - right now is I just reverted to an
02:40 - earlier version of p5 the version that
02:42 - I'm now running is 0.5 point one four so
02:45 - let's now have this ready and I'm going
02:50 - to hit refresh there's the train
02:54 - spinning there's my 3d miles right now
02:56 - interesting enough why is it spinning
02:58 - like a crazy thing let's go and put the
03:01 - box back in let's add the box as well
03:06 - now you can sort of see what's going on
03:08 - the so one thing that's important when
03:11 - you're importing a model is well what is
03:14 - it the models own internal coordinate
03:17 - system and in this case this model that
03:19 - I happen to import it is not centered
03:21 - itself around 0 0 and this is gonna make
03:24 - it much harder for me to use I could do
03:26 - like some kind of offset I'm like
03:28 - manually like maybe I could figure it
03:29 - out I could say something like right
03:31 - before I draw the model let me translate
03:33 - like maybe negative 200 or like 100
03:36 - along the x-axis that went that's closer
03:42 - let me try like negative 200 so that got
03:47 - that got further away so maybe it's not
03:49 - that so I could stir I could try to
03:51 - debug and figure this out but what
03:53 - instead what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
03:54 - revise or perhaps Alka Alka has already
03:59 - done this for me Alka in the chat has
04:01 - revised the model to sent around 0 so
04:04 - hold on for a second I'll be right back
04:05 - with a magical new model ok I'm back and
04:09 - I'm going to change I now have a new obj
04:12 - file train corrected we can look at it
04:15 - actually it might be worth just taking a
04:16 - peek at it because we can see look at
04:18 - these numbers now they look more like
04:20 - they're smaller
04:21 - some negative ones so maybe is actually
04:22 - centered around zero zero so let's try
04:25 - this model let's go back and load it we
04:29 - can see okay well that box is still
04:31 - there so the train is now stuck inside
04:33 - the box let's actually let's get rid of
04:40 - the box and let's there we go so there's
04:44 - the Train so what should I do now
04:47 - hopefully this is like an open source
04:49 - model often like the source but I'm
04:51 - gonna post this code hopefully now
04:53 - everyone watching can make some goofy
04:54 - like 3d animations with smoke coming out
04:57 - of the train or that sort of thing but
04:58 - let's let's try to just experiment with
05:00 - this a little more so for example what
05:04 - if I just have the ambient light have
05:07 - some color so you can see that this
05:12 - model was going to respond to the light
05:15 - what if I were to give it a different
05:18 - material it's like what if I try
05:21 - specular material that's white right can
05:28 - you see does that look different I can't
05:30 - really tell so did that material apply I
05:33 - don't know let's see normal material
05:37 - let's give it a normal material which is
05:39 - that debug rainbow color yeah so the
05:43 - material normal material is certainly
05:45 - applying it's unclear to me whether the
05:47 - specular one did or it's just hard to
05:48 - see so you can see that that's working
05:50 - and I don't see any reason why I
05:53 - couldn't texture the train let's try
05:59 - that oh my goodness it's the kitty cat
06:04 - train all aboard the kitty cat train
06:13 - sorry you know I have to try it some
06:16 - attempt to make these videos more
06:17 - interesting it's mostly failed attempts
06:19 - but so you can see this actually like
06:22 - the P 5 somehow decided it would texture
06:24 - this in some arbitrary way so wonderful
06:28 - so I I could do more with this I would
06:31 - love to you know figure out how to make
06:33 - the Train
06:33 - move and then have some smoke come out
06:35 - of it maybe the smoke could be Sears
06:36 - with cloudy textures or something like
06:39 - that but I'm gonna leave that to you as
06:40 - an exercise now you can see that in
06:42 - addition to making geometry with your
06:45 - own primitive shapes you can also load a
06:52 - model from an obj file and something I
06:55 - still haven't shown you which I do
06:57 - intend to do is how to make a custom
06:59 - piece of geometry using begin shape and
07:01 - end shape thanks very much
07:07 - [Music]
07:12 - you
