00:00 - [BELL DINGS]
00:01 - OK.
00:01 - Hi.
00:02 - So before, I know I said that
in the next-- if you watched
00:04 - the previous videos, I
said in the next video
00:06 - I'm going to start coding.
00:07 - Apologies.
00:08 - I'm not going to
start coding just yet.
00:10 - I'm going to do one more thing.
00:11 - I'm going to show you how to
get set up with the web editor
00:14 - itself.
00:15 - So the first thing you want
to do is go to a web browser.
00:18 - I'm using the
Chrome web browser.
00:21 - And I'm on a Mac, but you
could be on any other computer,
00:24 - and using a different
web browser as well.
00:26 - You want to go to the
URL editor.p5js.org.
00:30 - That's where you want to go.
00:31 - You can follow along,
and go there right now.
00:33 - What you're going to see is
something that looks like this.
00:36 - This is the web editor.
00:37 - And you can actually
just start coding.
00:39 - But I'm going to show you
what these things mean.
00:41 - But, like, what if I change
this background number to zero?
00:44 - And then I run up here and
there's this button here.
00:47 - This button that looks like
a play button, like I'm
00:49 - going to play on
my old-timey VCR.
00:51 - Well really, this is
going to run that code.
00:53 - And I'm going to
see, oh look at this.
00:56 - There's a square with a
black background over there.
00:59 - What if I change this to 100?
01:01 - And I click play again.
01:03 - Ooh, the color of that changed.
01:04 - What if I say 100,
comma, zero, comma, 200.
01:07 - Now the color's purple.
01:08 - So I'm off-- the train
is off the tracks.
01:11 - But I'm going to
come back and explain
01:13 - what all these things are,
how you type them, why you
01:15 - type them, and what they mean.
01:17 - Later.
01:17 - But the thing is, like,
this is my opus now.
01:20 - I have made this beautiful,
wonderful p5 sketch,
01:23 - and I want to share
it with the world.
01:25 - I can't.
01:26 - I can't.
01:27 - I could go to File,
and I can click Save.
01:30 - But it says, in order
to save sketches,
01:32 - you must be logged in.
01:33 - So at the moment,
the editor doesn't
01:35 - have any way to save something
without you having an account.
01:37 - You can play around,
but what you want to do
01:39 - is go to sign up.
01:40 - And you might already have an
account, you can go to log in.
01:42 - I'm going to click sign up.
01:44 - And here, what you can do is
you can create a username,
01:48 - and email, and a password.
01:51 - If you don't have your
own email address,
01:53 - you know, and you have a
parent, or somebody else
01:57 - that you can ask to use their
email address to sign up.
02:00 - That's what I would
suggest doing.
02:01 - So you want to
create that account.
02:03 - You don't need to use
your email other than just
02:05 - for the signing up.
02:06 - So once you've signed up, and
you've logged in, you're now--
02:10 - I'm going to leave this.
02:12 - You're going to see
something like this.
02:13 - Now I created an account
called Coding Train.
02:16 - And it will say hello, comma,
the username that you picked.
02:20 - So you'll see that.
02:21 - You can go into here,
under my account.
02:23 - You can see there's things
like my sketches, my assets.
02:25 - This is something that will--
02:28 - I'm going to show you how you
can use images, and sounds,
02:30 - and upload videos to the editor.
02:32 - Those are things that
would appear in my assets.
02:35 - Settings, which I'm going
to show you in a minute.
02:37 - But now, we're in p5 itself.
02:41 - Now I want to go back to
my beautiful opus where--
02:44 - I don't know why yet, but
somehow I changed some numbers,
02:46 - and I've got this
beautiful color over there.
02:48 - Now I can go to File, Save.
02:52 - Once I've done that,
this URL up here
02:56 - is a URL forever
that is my sketch.
03:01 - And in fact, I can go
right up here to Sketch--
03:04 - no.
03:05 - File, Share.
03:08 - And you can see.
03:08 - Look.
03:09 - Now I can share the
code for my sketch here.
03:13 - I can actually share
a full-screen version
03:15 - of the sketch.
03:16 - Let's look at this.
03:20 - Look at, here's my
beautiful sketch.
03:22 - And I'm going to show you how
to make more interesting things.
03:24 - And then share them
without the code.
03:25 - And then this is
something called an embed.
03:28 - So if you have a blog,
this is something
03:30 - where you can actually
take your sketch,
03:31 - and embed it into
something else.
03:33 - I'll come back and show
you this stuff, maybe,
03:35 - again as we get further along.
03:37 - I'm not going to worry
about it too much right now.
03:39 - OK.
03:40 - So we've got it.
03:41 - Oh, here's the thing.
03:42 - What is the name
of this project?
03:44 - What is the name
of this project?
03:46 - If I zoom in here.
03:48 - The name of the project
is Unbiased Shoe.
03:51 - So this is one of my favorite
things about the p5 web editor.
03:54 - It will auto generate a
name of each sketch for you.
03:57 - Now the truth of the
matter is, you probably
03:59 - want to have some practice
of renaming, and naming it
04:02 - something that describes
what it actually is.
04:05 - I can click this pencil
icon, and I can call
04:07 - it Coding Train Editor Demo.
04:11 - I can hit Enter.
04:12 - And now the sketch
has that name.
04:13 - The URL-- this name
is not part of the URL
04:17 - for sharing that sketch.
04:18 - It's just a name for you to
keep track of if you ever
04:21 - go to, for example, File, Open.
04:23 - And I could see.
04:24 - Look.
04:24 - These are other sketches.
04:26 - Now, Measly Friend
is some sketch
04:27 - I must have created
that I forgot to rename.
04:29 - 10PRINT is something
that I was creating.
04:32 - So you can see these are the
sketches that I have made.
04:34 - I could go and
browse my other ones.
04:36 - OK.
04:37 - Now, here's the thing.
04:39 - For me to make my
tutorials, I want
04:43 - to adjust a few
settings visually
04:45 - for how it looks to make
it easier for the viewer
04:48 - to see it.
04:49 - And so, I'm going to
go here under Settings.
04:51 - And one thing I could
do under Settings,
04:53 - I've already changed
the text size to 36.
04:56 - I'm going to go to this
high contrast theme.
05:00 - And then I'm going
to close, x here.
05:01 - And we're going to see, this
is a nice high contrast theme.
05:04 - It has a dark background.
05:05 - It also is easily viewable
for anyone who's colorblind,
05:09 - and any visual impairments.
05:10 - So I think it's going to be
nice for the video tutorials
05:12 - to use that theme.
05:13 - I also would prefer to make sure
that I'm not standing in front
05:17 - of the code by accident.
05:18 - So I'm usually a
little bit weird
05:20 - that I'm going to happen
to mention in this video.
05:22 - I'm going to move the code
window to the other side.
05:26 - This is not a feature
of the editor.
05:27 - I have someone-- a Coding Train
contributor sent me some code.
05:32 - Then I was able to
hack the browser,
05:34 - and I can put the code
on the other side.
05:36 - And I can see the
preview over here.
05:38 - So I am going to--
05:40 - sorry.
05:41 - If you bear with
me for a second.
05:43 - I am now-- in my
videos, I'm going
05:45 - to have it look like this.
05:46 - At some point, that might
become a feature of the editor
05:49 - if other people need
this ability to flip
05:52 - where the locations are.
05:53 - Or if you really need
to know how to do that,
05:56 - I'll provide some instructions
in the video description
05:58 - about how to add a little
button to your web browser
06:02 - to flip this back and forth.
06:04 - But I'm going to
leave it this way.
06:06 - I think this is going
allow me to code in a way
06:08 - that you can see
the code over here.
06:09 - And if I'm standing in front
of the output every so often,
06:12 - no big deal.
06:14 - One more quick thing that I
want to mention, actually.
06:16 - Thank you to some live
viewers who pointed this out.
06:20 - If you don't want to sign
up for a new account,
06:22 - you can actually log into the
p5 web editor with an account
06:26 - that you already have with
Google, or with a website
06:29 - called GitHub.
06:29 - Which if you don't
know what that is,
06:31 - I have some other
videos you could watch.
06:33 - But you don't see those
on the sign up page.
06:35 - So those don't show here, but
if you go to the login page,
06:38 - you can see these options here.
06:40 - Log in with GitHub,
or log in with Google.
06:42 - So that's another way of
logging into the editor.
06:47 - OK.
06:48 - Again, this was
not comprehensive.
06:51 - If you want a
comprehensive overview
06:53 - of all of the features
of the web editor,
06:56 - I will link to the processing
foundation playlist.
06:58 - There's three videos about
p5, and the web editor.
07:01 - Cassie, the creator of the
web editor, does an overview.
07:04 - Mathura talks about the
accessibility features.
07:07 - And there's a video about
education with p5 from Saber
07:09 - as well.
07:10 - So, OK.
07:10 - So now, if you somehow
made it to the end
07:13 - of this long rambling
video, I will really
07:16 - code in the next video.
07:18 - In the next video, I'm
going to talk about what are
07:20 - the commands, the instructions?
07:22 - What is the syntax of JavaScript
with the p5.js library
07:26 - to get things to
appear right over here?
07:30 - See you there.
