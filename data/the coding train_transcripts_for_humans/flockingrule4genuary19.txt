00:16 - operates on three Simple Rules

00:30 - rule called view where if a boid is
00:34 - blocking another boy's view it should
00:36 - move laterally to the side this should
00:39 - produce more realistic flocks activating
00:42 - the new rule in three 2 1 interesting
00:46 - they're kind of freaking out maybe I'll
00:48 - try it with fewer I'm wondering if
00:50 - they'll fan out like a geese turning it
00:53 - way up H I don't know can anybody help
00:57 - me with this here's a link to my code if
