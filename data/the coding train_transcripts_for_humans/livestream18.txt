00:11 - in New York hello hello how does the
01:07 - focus okay check your chat voice not
01:16 - good okay one's gonna send the voices
01:19 - not good anyone here
01:29 - I'm going to the hole for a second
01:32 - because when we go too far for audio
01:34 - it's not good
01:47 - if you're watching this in the archives
01:49 - on ticket in 30 seconds
01:51 - yes the voice on the cracker okay let me
01:55 - see what I can do about that wine will
01:58 - be doing test chest is that better
02:21 - test test is this any better now
02:30 - sorry for this technical problem and
02:33 - this is very unfortunate
02:35 - test test tests work say I can yeah
02:41 - guess I could put on headphones I do it
02:46 - let me find my headphones my mic is
02:50 - kaput okay
03:50 - I'm trying to turn anywhere
04:55 - listen
07:05 - you
07:44 - test test test test test is this any
07:48 - better
08:26 - oh it's okay now is it okay now
08:30 - oh great okay okay give me a second
08:34 - everybody okay good I'm glad I fixed it
08:39 - bad cable somewhere if it's too might be
08:44 - too loud because I was turning things up
08:45 - and down let me just get myself
08:49 - resituated confirm that everything is
08:52 - good
09:03 - okay
09:09 - okay oh wait I have to click one thing
09:11 - here okay is it okay now is the audio
09:16 - okay I'm gonna listen with my headphones
09:25 - just to be sure
09:36 - oh great okay great okay so we are back
09:42 - I am back I am 10 minutes into this
09:47 - thing okay so the first 10 minutes of
09:49 - this is hogwash
09:50 - if that's a word that makes any sense to
09:53 - use this context I don't know welcome
09:55 - let me start over again
09:57 - I'm gonna my name is Dan I'm just moving
10:00 - some things around here I'm here live at
10:07 - ITP I actually have not recorded a video
10:09 - or been live sent I'm we're just gonna
10:13 - since 2015 in December was the last time
10:16 - that I recorded anything I've been away
10:20 - and a bunch of things have been going on
10:21 - I am hoping to starting in March my plan
10:25 - is to actually do this twice per week at
10:27 - a regular time where I will do a bunch
10:30 - of different things just random topics
10:32 - answer questions as well as perhaps
10:34 - follow some specific curriculum so there
10:37 - might be like a continuing hood it's
10:39 - kind of like things that you can watch
10:41 - just as a one-off or things you can
10:43 - watch over time or a place where you can
10:44 - ask questions I haven't really figured
10:45 - at all yet out yet but I'm hoping to
10:47 - focus on this make more videos that sort
10:49 - of things so be in touch on Twitter and
10:52 - the YouTube comments that sort of thing
10:53 - so today I'm really I'm the least
10:57 - prepare for this that I've ever been in
10:59 - the sense that I just happened to be
11:01 - here at ITP so I thought I would turn
11:03 - the setup on and try to make some videos
11:05 - something that I thought about I think
11:07 - that the topic that I'll start with and
11:08 - you guys can think about if you have if
11:11 - you have other questions is something
11:13 - that comes up all the time in my courses
11:15 - is how to make an object like a thing
11:19 - that moves around the screen that stores
11:22 - a history of its path as it's moving
11:24 - around the screen and essentially draws
11:26 - a trail for itself and you can do this
11:28 - by just not erasing the background so
11:30 - you see the trail but what if you want
11:31 - to race the background what if you want
11:32 - to have its path also move and do
11:34 - respond to physics and that sort of
11:36 - thing so this I think is going to be a
11:38 - useful demonstration and then I'll take
11:41 - out so I'm going to do that it's
11:42 - probably 10 or 15 minutes and then I
11:44 - hopefully will think of some other
11:45 - things too or look at my list of topics
11:47 - or take questions and that sort of
11:49 - so so that's that I think I will do this
11:53 - in p5.js I could do it both processing
11:59 - and p5.js excuse me what I was like if
12:05 - like I was about to burp which would be
12:06 - an awkward thing to do in a live stream
12:07 - but it's certainly I'm sure that's
12:09 - happened before what I want to look for
12:12 - is p5.js org download and I want to go
12:17 - down to the editor yeah I don't think on
12:19 - this computer I there is a slightly
12:22 - newer version of the editor version 0.5
12:25 - 0.7 here it comes
12:30 - Donna could delete that and extract this
12:38 - and copy to the desktop replace so I
12:48 - think so
12:52 - yes I want to open it so what I'm going
12:56 - to do here it is first I'm sorry in
13:08 - getting width so I'm gonna get ready for
13:10 - this how am I going to get ready for
13:11 - this the first thing that I'll do is
13:13 - create an object that moves around the
13:18 - screen according to some set of rules
13:22 - maybe we'll do some combination
13:24 - randomness or some combination of Perlin
13:26 - noise so okay so what I'm gonna do here
13:29 - is I'm gonna make a like ten minute
13:31 - video lesson that's going to be the core
13:33 - material for this but and I'm gonna
13:35 - record that separately and in a post
13:37 - that as a separate video but as a
13:39 - warm-up I'm gonna start getting ready
13:40 - for that so to get ready for that the
13:43 - first thing I'm going to do is make a
13:47 - another tab here in the p5 editor I'm
13:50 - just going to call it particle jf and
13:54 - I'm going to make a particle object and
13:57 - that particle object is going to have
14:00 - annex and you'll be able to make the
14:06 - particle object at any given X at any
14:09 - given Y so this this particular tutorial
14:11 - that I'm gonna do is sort of assumes all
14:14 - the foundation stuff with JavaScript
14:17 - programming and p5.js that I've already
14:18 - done in previous videos you guys give me
14:21 - an idea if you have an idea for how this
14:22 - thing should move around the screen
14:23 - that's maybe different than randomness
14:25 - but I'll make a update function and I
14:29 - forget that I'm making a constructor
14:30 - function so this dot update equals
14:32 - function and this dot render show I'm
14:37 - going to do show equals function and
14:40 - we'll make this thing a nice little
14:42 - circle that is perhaps some shade of
14:51 - gray with some alpha and maybe a black
14:55 - outline and update would be like just to
14:59 - get this going right now let's just move
15:01 - it randomly this is kind of not a very
15:04 - interesting thing to do so right now I'm
15:07 - making oh and I'm not I'm sort of out of
15:09 - practice with this I have this in the
15:11 - wrong place is this font size big enough
15:13 - can you get is this clear in watching
15:15 - the video um if you're in the chat well
15:18 - thirty-five people are watching now
15:20 - that's crazy that's a lot more than I
15:22 - usually have in these like live streams
15:24 - who done this for a while it's a good
15:25 - sign okay hello people who are watching
15:27 - so I'm getting ready to do something
15:30 - interesting that I think will be useful
15:32 - for some of you who are learning about
15:33 - programming and stuff but I'm just sort
15:34 - of getting ready to it the first thing
15:35 - that I've done is just written a
15:37 - constructor function for a very generic
15:39 - particle a particle it just has an x and
15:41 - y the x and y change randomly and it has
15:43 - a function to draw itself as a circle so
15:45 - if I go now I'm going to save this just
15:48 - to the desktop here as history um let me
15:53 - say it make a folder with today's date
15:55 - which is February 9th and I'm going to
15:59 - save this as particle history 1 so now
16:04 - when I go to the main sketch I want to
16:07 - make a variable called P maybe I'll call
16:10 - it particle and say particle
16:13 - new particle 100/100 and I should create
16:17 - a canvas that is I don't know 400 by 300
16:21 - and I should draw a background which
16:24 - will be slightly gray and I will say
16:28 - particle dot update particle dot show so
16:32 - I just wanted to get something very
16:33 - basic going here in preparation ok
16:36 - particle is not defined aha
16:38 - oh this really should be a feature of
16:40 - this nest nice editor so I need to go to
16:42 - the sidebar under index and I need to
16:46 - add a reference to the particle J s file
16:49 - I'm gonna hide the side I'm doing all
16:51 - this stuff quickly because this is just
16:53 - the preparatory stuff I'm gonna run it
16:55 - ok there we go we got our particle there
16:58 - it is moving randomly ok so I'm getting
17:01 - ready now let's think about this how
17:03 - should we have this particle move in a
17:04 - more interesting way could you please
17:07 - lift both your hands and yell I lost my
17:09 - hands thank you I don't know what that
17:11 - means but I got obliged a strange
17:13 - request to the chat it says I lost my
17:16 - hands I don't know why but well if you
17:18 - just type something the chat asked me to
17:20 - do it I'm not necessarily gonna do it
17:21 - though ok
17:24 - hello everyone live great it's great to
17:28 - see people here in the chat so I would
17:30 - like this particle to move around in a
17:31 - more interesting way how about we use
17:34 - Perlin noise to move it so first of all
17:37 - it's so tiny
17:38 - let's make it a little bit bigger I'll
17:40 - make it 24 that's good and let's have it
17:45 - move with some oh and the cameras are
17:48 - going let's have it move with some
17:49 - pearly noise that's a probably a hole
17:55 - actually you know I don't know if I want
17:57 - to do the purlin purlins noises then
17:58 - this video kind of depends on Perlin
18:00 - noise what if I have it move with well
18:07 - let's just have it be a bouncing ball
18:08 - that's sort of uh pick your nose let's
18:14 - have it just be a bit so let's have it
18:15 - be a bouncing ball so I'm gonna do why
18:20 - I'm gonna add a Y speed
18:25 - and have it change by Y speed only the Y
18:28 - and I'm going to add a gravity variable
18:33 - and I'm gonna have the this dot Y speed
18:40 - change by this gravity and honestly I
18:43 - don't think it makes sense for gravity
18:45 - to be part of the object just make that
18:47 - a global variable this is something
18:52 - interesting to think about a little bit
18:54 - of an aside as I get ready to do this
18:55 - particular lesson that I'm gonna launch
18:57 - into in a second which is that I'm
18:59 - making this thing called a particle and
19:01 - the particle has properties it has its
19:03 - position it has its speed and having to
19:05 - have a size it might have a color and I
19:07 - was about to give it the property of
19:08 - gravity but then I thought to myself
19:09 - gravity that's really conceptually part
19:12 - of the world it's not part of the object
19:13 - so instead I made it a variable outside
19:15 - of the object in this case I don't
19:16 - really matter so much
19:18 - you know all this is just sort of made
19:19 - up anyway for the purpose of something
19:20 - I'm going to show you in a moment and if
19:25 - we do this now if we run this we can see
19:26 - it's falling with gravity and probably
19:29 - under update then I should check if it
19:31 - gets if it goes beyond the screen then
19:36 - let's set its white pipe back onto the
19:38 - screen and reverse its speed into the
19:43 - other direction so now we have this
19:47 - bouncing object okay so we have this
19:51 - object that bounces great and let's have
19:54 - it it's bounced slowed down a little bit
19:57 - when it hits the bottom okay so I think
20:00 - I'm getting ready to do the first
20:04 - recording which will be uploaded as a
20:06 - separate standalone video and in this
20:08 - particular video what I'm going to
20:10 - demonstrate I'm going to say this again
20:11 - in two seconds is I'm going to
20:13 - demonstrate how to have this object
20:16 - store its own path without simple as an
20:21 - array inside of the object itself okay
20:23 - this comes up all the time I've seen
20:25 - people trying to do all sorts of thing
20:26 - with with this and yeah so this will be
20:31 - useful a plate okay
20:36 - sine-wave sine wave would have been good
20:38 - too
20:40 - I think we'll do some people do
20:42 - something about sine simple harmonic
20:45 - motion and sine waves maybe in another
20:47 - quick video it's already 11:30 because I
20:49 - lost all that time is a stupid audio
20:50 - okay so let me move over here for a
20:53 - second to drink some of this tea can you
21:01 - guys read this okay lighting in here and
21:04 - everything is fine okay I don't really
21:11 - love the bouncing ball things going off
21:15 - my hair okay the ball is going up yeah
21:19 - isn't that interesting I thought I think
21:21 - I just didn't run it again it's a little
21:23 - bit of a rounding issue now now that
21:24 - won't happen now that I open I'm over
21:26 - here okay all right I'm not definitely
21:29 - out of practice doing these so yeah it's
21:31 - good if I do the member I haven't done
21:32 - this in over a month I definitely need
21:34 - to do these every week okay please give
21:39 - it a name it's the name oh you're right
21:41 - it is still going up I guess no I don't
21:43 - know if this I guess I'll be a little
21:44 - bit more I know somebody suggest a name
21:47 - for this party it should be the rainbow
21:50 - blue rain ball rainbow ball ball bow
21:55 - it's a particle I don't like to use the
21:56 - word ball it's not really a ball there
21:58 - so it's really just a particle as a
21:59 - thing on the screen but anyway here we
22:02 - go I'm gonna get ready so I have this
22:03 - other system I got to make sure this
22:04 - works actually because I had a problem
22:06 - with this the other day and so when I
22:09 - have to test something really quickly
22:13 - that's fine
22:15 - record to disk I sim 2015 mp4 16 by 9
22:21 - okay I'm going to I'm gonna hit record
22:25 - and I'm gonna do
22:26 - test test test this is a test test test
22:29 - I'm testing something to make sure it
22:31 - works okay and now I'm gonna look on the
22:36 - desktop of this computer you can't see
22:38 - what I'm doing and then I make sure
22:40 - something recorded it looks like it
22:45 - recorded
22:46 - and maybe I can I'm gonna turn the audio
22:49 - for a second okay that worked excellent
23:00 - so my recording thing works I got to
23:03 - turn the audio back off so I'm gonna get
23:06 - feedback and close this and it is still
23:11 - going up like crazy and stop it from
23:16 - doing that okay okay here we go I am
23:26 - ready now boy mmm really out of practice
23:27 - on this alright so let's see I'm now
23:32 - going to start hello and welcome to
23:37 - start over it's forever okay I'm gonna
23:39 - close this I'm gonna I'm gonna close my
23:42 - view of the chat and get going on this
23:44 - okay
23:46 - hello welcome in this video I'm going to
23:49 - demonstrate how to take let me run this
23:51 - again how to have an object on the
23:54 - screen store a history of its path now
23:58 - this object just happens to be a
24:00 - bouncing ball it's bouncing up and down
24:02 - but you could maybe have something move
24:04 - and spiral pattern or something move
24:05 - along a sine wave or use something
24:07 - called Perlin noise or move randomly or
24:09 - maybe you've watched them on my other
24:10 - videos where I show how to have things
24:11 - respond to forces the point is you have
24:13 - something that you've already programmed
24:15 - to move around the screen what if you
24:17 - want to draw a trail or to have that
24:20 - history of its path for some other
24:22 - purpose like this comes up a lot so on
24:25 - the one hand you might already say oh I
24:26 - know how to do this right because in the
24:29 - basics of using an environment like
24:30 - processing or p5.js there's this
24:32 - background function and the background
24:34 - function erases the background so if you
24:36 - were to take the background function
24:38 - from draw which is continuously erasing
24:40 - the background and move it in to set up
24:42 - now we can see this object is drawing a
24:47 - trail and you can barely see it moving
24:48 - anymore which is something that I should
24:50 - have considered probably but you can see
24:52 - that it's drawing a trail but it's kind
24:54 - of this is not really a good solution
24:57 - because a it's
24:59 - continuously drawing its trail forever I
25:01 - can't have some things draw one trail
25:03 - something's not draw a trail something's
25:04 - draw a long trail something's wrong sure
25:05 - trail I can't have the things in the
25:08 - trail changing color or moving according
25:10 - to their own set of principles so in
25:12 - order to do something anything any idea
25:14 - that you have that's a bit more
25:15 - sophisticated beyond just see the things
25:17 - sort of like smearing a trail of its
25:19 - path along the screen you're gonna need
25:21 - to keep that background in draw and
25:23 - figure out a way for the object itself
25:26 - to store a history of its own path so
25:29 - let's think about how we might do that I
25:31 - feel obligated to use the whiteboard for
25:33 - a second even though I don't know that
25:34 - it's necessary so let's kind of unpack
25:36 - this a little bit we have on the screen
25:39 - we have a circle maybe it's moving maybe
25:42 - it's your program it's some sort of like
25:44 - ants like insect like creature and it's
25:46 - moving around and what you want is for
25:49 - it to have almost like this like body
25:53 - that it pulls along along its path in
25:56 - some type of way oh this would be a good
25:59 - topic for a video looking at inverse
26:00 - kinematics all that stuff to create like
26:02 - a skeleton oh that's gonna be good it'll
26:03 - do that in another video here we just
26:05 - want the trail so the object if we think
26:09 - of this object as called a particle as a
26:11 - very generic term for a thing moving
26:13 - around the screen this particle has an X
26:16 - this particle has a Y and now what is
26:22 - this particle deed in addition to the X
26:24 - and the y it needs to have something
26:26 - that I'll call a history and that
26:30 - history can be an array because what
26:33 - this particle will do is it stores its X
26:36 - Y as its current location but another
26:38 - property of it is actually an array
26:41 - where it can keep track of older x and
26:43 - y's and older x and y's and older x and
26:45 - y's so let's look at how that might be
26:47 - done so if I come back over here to this
26:51 - particular example you can see the
26:54 - basics of the code right there's a
26:56 - particle object it makes a new particle
26:58 - object in setup and then that particle
27:00 - object update and show where all of the
27:03 - code world the stuff for that particle
27:04 - object is is over here in this
27:06 - constructor function and you can see
27:08 - it's just got some basic stuff it has an
27:11 - X and a Y variable
27:13 - it has a wide speed variable because all
27:14 - this thing is doing is moving up and
27:15 - down it changes Y by Y speed it changes
27:19 - Y speed by gravity it checks if it gets
27:22 - to the bottom then if it gets to the
27:23 - bottom it reverses its direction and
27:25 - then it also has a function to display
27:26 - itself so what I'm suggesting to you
27:28 - here is the first thing that we need to
27:31 - do is add another property to this
27:33 - object the way that we add a property
27:35 - this object is by saying this object
27:37 - this thing this particle thing that's
27:39 - going to be made through this
27:40 - constructor function this dot the name
27:42 - of that property and I'm going to call
27:44 - it a history and I'm going to make it an
27:46 - array so this is a wonderful thing about
27:48 - working in JavaScript I'm after I do
27:51 - this video I'll make a version of this
27:52 - code in processing and I'll upload both
27:55 - examples so you have the p5 and the
27:57 - processing version but the JavaScript
27:59 - version will be a little bit simpler
28:00 - because an array in JavaScript natively
28:03 - is a thing that you can just start as an
28:04 - empty thing and start filling it with
28:06 - stuff whereas in processing in Java I'll
28:09 - have to build the example with something
28:11 - called an ArrayList and I will link to
28:13 - other videos about how ArrayList worked
28:15 - at some point there so okay so this is
28:17 - our first start here we make this
28:19 - history variable so what do we do with
28:22 - that history variable every time the
28:25 - object updates its location every time
28:28 - it moves I want to store where it
28:29 - previously was how do I do that so how
28:32 - do I add something to an array so this
28:34 - is the update function right here right
28:37 - this is where the wat its X&Y location
28:40 - might change it's moving around the
28:42 - screen so what I want to do is add
28:43 - something here where I say this dot
28:45 - history and I want to somehow I would
28:48 - have like add something into this
28:49 - history so the way that you add
28:51 - something to an array in JavaScript it
28:54 - away that one there's many ways you can
28:56 - do it but one way you can sum to add
28:58 - something to the end of that array is
28:59 - with a function called push so if I were
29:02 - to say push dot X what I'm doing is I'm
29:04 - saying take this object's current X
29:06 - location and by the way I can't say X I
29:09 - have to say what JavaScript this dot X I
29:13 - have to take this object's current X and
29:16 - put it into the array so if I did this
29:18 - and ran this program every time an
29:20 - update it would say save its X in the
29:22 - array save its X in the array and that
29:23 - array
29:24 - would just become full of its ex
29:26 - locations and we could do something
29:28 - amusing
29:29 - I don't know how amusing this would be
29:31 - I'm gonna say print its history out and
29:33 - you can see here right I'm getting I'm
29:38 - printing out these arrays and there's
29:40 - just tons of values of 100 because it's
29:41 - X is never changing so why don't I put
29:44 - its Y in there and you can see I look
29:47 - the Y values are just being stored the
29:49 - history of its Y values are being stored
29:50 - in that array oh well maybe I should put
29:52 - both the X and the y and you could sort
29:57 - of see now that array has X Y XY XY X Y
29:59 - X Y so just think of the push function
30:01 - you could just push a bunch of things in
30:02 - the array by separating them but this is
30:05 - this while this is fine it's worth
30:08 - noting that's something that's going to
30:10 - make our life much easier to do this
30:13 - particular example is using something
30:15 - called a vector so let me come back over
30:19 - here for a second and talk briefly about
30:21 - what a vector is if you haven't
30:24 - encountered it before and I'm probably
30:25 - gonna do some other videos and that go
30:28 - through this stuff in more detail but
30:30 - let's say I have an object oh this pen
30:33 - is terrible
30:35 - let's say I have an object whose
30:39 - location is at an x and a y I could have
30:43 - separate x and y variables or I could
30:49 - have a variable that I'll call a vector
30:51 - and what I could do in p5 is I can call
30:56 - a function called create vector and give
30:59 - it two values can you see that you can
31:02 - I've gone off the here look live fixing
31:06 - live editing this is what I do a live
31:08 - editing just gonna move the camera a
31:09 - little bit so you can see that so
31:11 - instead of having a separate X&Y
31:13 - variable I can have a single variable
31:15 - using the create vector function to put
31:18 - an x and y in well why does that work
31:21 - why is that relevant well a vector is
31:23 - essentially one way of thinking of a
31:25 - vector is as an arrow or directions for
31:27 - how to get from one place to another and
31:29 - here in this case an object's location
31:31 - is a vector for how to get from the
31:33 - origin to where it's actually being
31:36 - displayed
31:37 - the you can think of this as a triangle
31:39 - with a y component and an X component so
31:42 - this arrow is a vector so instead of
31:45 - that big array that I want to fill
31:47 - instead of trying to put an X than a Y
31:50 - then an X than Y then an X than a y
31:52 - it'll be much simpler if I say let's put
31:56 - a vector an XY and then put another
31:58 - vector
31:58 - another XY so I can kind of group the
32:01 - history as its position is this XY then
32:04 - its position was this XY that history is
32:05 - a whole bunch of vectors so over here
32:09 - now if I come back to the code what I
32:11 - want to do is I'm gonna say var V V
32:18 - equals create vector this X this dot Y
32:22 - and I'm now going to push that vector
32:27 - into the array and run this again and so
32:31 - now as this program is running as this
32:34 - is running over and over again
32:36 - this history array is getting like
32:38 - bigger and bigger and bigger let's take
32:39 - a look at that let's let's look in the
32:42 - console at this dot history dot length
32:45 - so you can see as the program is running
32:48 - I'm just storing over and over again a
32:50 - vector for every single point that this
32:52 - object has ever been so right if I
32:55 - wanted to draw a trail of everywhere
32:58 - it's ever been
32:58 - then I can simply do that pretty easily
33:03 - because I have all those points in an
33:05 - array I feel like I pause fast questions
33:06 - but I can't pause because I'm just
33:08 - making this as a video okay so we've now
33:10 - we've got the core mechanic here now
33:12 - which is just this which is just like
33:14 - every time as the object gets updated
33:16 - take its current location save a copy of
33:18 - it stored in the array so let's do
33:20 - something with that now let's in the
33:23 - display function I could always now say
33:27 - I could have a loop to go through that
33:31 - entire array and I could draw and of
33:37 - course I'm forgetting to save this this
33:40 - and now this is a little bit what I
33:42 - think might be worth doing here's make a
33:46 - variable called position which is this
33:48 - dot history
33:50 - index I so here what I'm doing is right
33:53 - here this is an important little thing
33:55 - to look at for a second is I want when
33:57 - I'm going to draw this object in
33:59 - addition to drawing its current XY I'm
34:01 - gonna go through and loop through the
34:03 - entire history and pull out each and
34:05 - every spot in history index 0 index 1
34:08 - index 2 and those things are vectors and
34:11 - I'm going to store them in a variable
34:12 - called pause for a position and now if I
34:16 - want to draw another circle there I can
34:17 - just say pause dot X pause dot Y and
34:21 - I'll make this a smaller circle and we
34:25 - can see now if I run this program you
34:27 - can see it is drawing a circle at every
34:32 - spot in its history and now you know
34:33 - what I I had this idea where like all a
34:35 - bouncing ball is gonna make sense and I
34:37 - just I just don't like it anymore
34:39 - let's let's get rid of this idea of Y
34:42 - speed and grab let's just be much
34:45 - simpler about this and let's just chain
34:49 - and let's get rid of this bouncing thing
34:50 - let's just do what I originally set out
34:53 - to do which I think will demonstrate
34:54 - this idea much better which is just to
34:57 - have it move randomly so I'm just
35:01 - changing this particle to instead of
35:03 - bouncing up and down to have it move
35:05 - randomly so you can see now as it's
35:07 - moving randomly it's leaving a circle
35:09 - everywhere it's ever been in its path
35:12 - and I do I am erasing I am erasing the
35:17 - background each time so this allows me
35:19 - to do lots of different things for
35:21 - example you know each one of those
35:24 - circles could be drawn randomly they're
35:26 - their size could be random you know just
35:30 - so you can see here I don't I don't know
35:31 - what the value of this is but you can
35:33 - see that those things can be animated in
35:35 - their own way I don't particularly like
35:38 - what I've done with randomness but
35:40 - there's a lot of possibilities there so
35:42 - this is the simple idea right that
35:45 - instead of just drawing a circle at its
35:47 - location also store a and a also keep
35:50 - track of an array that stores a copy of
35:52 - its location over time and draw
35:54 - something there so I want to add a few
35:56 - things to this number one is I think it
36:00 - might make sense to limit that history
36:01 - right so one thing we could say is
36:03 - if this dot history dot length is
36:06 - greater than 25 then this dot history
36:14 - dot splice splice is a function that
36:16 - allows you to pull out things from the
36:19 - array and the oldest thing in the array
36:21 - is the first thing index number 0 and I
36:24 - want to just take one thing out of the
36:26 - array so this place function takes two
36:28 - arguments the index where you want to
36:30 - delete something and how many things you
36:32 - want to delete which is just one so now
36:34 - if we run it you can see and let's have
36:36 - it move idle
36:40 - so you can see here and goodbye it left
36:44 - the screen those are too large let me I
36:49 - came back that was nice of it and we
36:51 - could do something like have its size
36:54 - just be I so you can see that come back
36:59 - okay well let's do something else too
37:01 - okay ah so here's the amazing thing
37:02 - about doing this I only have one
37:05 - particle and this is like at first I
37:07 - have this like tiny window so just so we
37:09 - can see more stuff happening let's put
37:12 - that in the middle so what's oh in its
37:15 - Oh ed etre you should have changed your
37:17 - size but you didn't so you can see that
37:22 - this gives you a lot more potential now
37:24 - in things that you can do in terms of
37:26 - having this thing store its own history
37:28 - I like barely scratch the surface if so
37:30 - many better ideas you probably have good
37:31 - ideas too but what I at least want to do
37:33 - is expand this now because the point of
37:36 - having done this and encapsulating this
37:37 - entire idea of the history inside of
37:40 - this object right the entire capturing
37:43 - the history inside of this object now
37:44 - what's possible is let me make this
37:46 - called particles let me not have any
37:50 - particles in setup and let me loop
37:53 - through I'm gonna let me make an array
37:54 - of all the possible particles and let me
37:59 - say particles index i dot update
38:03 - particles index i dot show so now what
38:06 - I've done is I've changed the main
38:07 - program from having just this one single
38:09 - particle to starting with an empty array
38:11 - of particles at any of the particles
38:13 - that are there they all should update in
38:15 - the all should show now of course
38:16 - there's none
38:17 - now why because we haven't added any so
38:20 - now what's exciting about this is let's
38:22 - say anytime I click the mouse let's add
38:29 - write adding something to an array with
38:31 - the push function new particle and let's
38:37 - add it where the mouse is so now if I
38:40 - run this look at this I click there
38:42 - click there all of these objects are all
38:44 - storing their own history and I can just
38:47 - keep making many of them so this is
38:49 - pretty great because now you know and
38:54 - just to demonstrate that the background
38:55 - is 100% the background is not being
38:59 - erased I can have something else move
39:04 - I'm gonna just move frame count modulus
39:07 - width I don't know this is gonna work
39:08 - boy I'm like oh let me not do this I'm
39:10 - just gonna say frame count zero frame
39:13 - count height just to see like there's
39:17 - something moving across the screen that
39:19 - is not drawing a trail so we can have
39:22 - some things draw a trail we can have a
39:23 - lot of control over that trail being
39:25 - that what's the size of that trail do
39:28 - the objects do they change color do they
39:31 - animate that sort of thing so let me
39:34 - like to addictiveness I'm like at 15
39:36 - minutes you can just stop this and do
39:38 - something else but I want to do a couple
39:39 - more things with this so you see this
39:41 - basic example one thing that I think
39:43 - would be useful to demonstrate is to see
39:46 - that a common thing that you'll want to
39:48 - do is actually draw the trail as oh and
39:53 - I'm over here now so a common thing come
39:55 - on button a common thing that you might
39:57 - want to do is with this object draw the
40:00 - trail as a continuous set of lines like
40:04 - that and a way of doing that is with a
40:09 - begin shape and end shape so I'm going
40:12 - to comment out the ellipse and I can say
40:15 - begin shape at the beginning of the loop
40:18 - and n shape at the end of the loop and
40:20 - just say vertex
40:23 - pause dot X pause dot Y so what I'm
40:27 - actually doing here is making a new
40:28 - shape that's going to appear on this
40:30 - Green and all the vertices of that shape
40:32 - are going to be made up of the history
40:34 - of that object so if I run this and
40:37 - click you can see that shape now weirdly
40:40 - enough that shape is closed and it has a
40:42 - fill so a couple things I want to do is
40:44 - I want to say no fill the other thing I
40:46 - might want to do is I think I want to
40:48 - make this let this be a lot longer and
40:50 - let this be a hundred and we can run
40:53 - this and you can see now you can see
40:55 - that it's drawing this like squiggly
40:57 - line and again if you change this to
40:59 - have it move more smoothly or some other
41:01 - different algorithm you can imagine how
41:03 - useful this might be and again I can
41:05 - have all of them continue to do this now
41:08 - here's the other thing that's amazing
41:10 - about this not only do we have this
41:13 - history stored as data but because we
41:15 - have this history stored as data in an
41:17 - array those things can change so there's
41:20 - no reason why I couldn't say while the
41:22 - object is moving in its update function
41:24 - right it's update function does what it
41:27 - changes the X&Y location then it stores
41:30 - a copy of that exile on location in its
41:32 - history but there's no reason why while
41:34 - it's moving
41:35 - I couldn't also loop through the entire
41:40 - array and have history and I always
41:45 - forget that this this I could say this
41:48 - dot history index I dot X move randomly
41:54 - and index I dot y move randomly so what
41:58 - I've added here is I'm saying aha in
42:01 - addition to the object's location moving
42:03 - its history those points also move as
42:06 - well so now if I draw something you can
42:09 - see that its history is kind of like
42:11 - undulating as it moves as well
42:13 - all those vert vert X's vertices have
42:16 - their own kind of motion tips so again I
42:18 - don't really like necessarily my own
42:20 - visual result here because the only
42:22 - thing I'm using as the driving force
42:24 - behind the motion is randomness but you
42:27 - could imagine what sort of possibilities
42:29 - might there be there in terms of a
42:31 - creature design in terms of color in
42:34 - terms of smooth motion in terms of
42:36 - oscillating motion get boy like having
42:38 - all of those points like sort of
42:40 - oscillating is this if it's like a
42:41 - waving fish or something or waving
42:43 - there's just so many possibilities so I
42:45 - hope that I'm gonna upload this code
42:47 - example complete this upload this video
42:49 - upload the code example make a p5
42:51 - version make a processing version if you
42:53 - make something built off of this example
42:55 - please share it with me in the comments
42:56 - I don't understand how this video became
42:58 - 20 minutes long but it did and I hope
43:00 - that you found it somewhat useful
43:02 - goodbye and see you in the next video
43:04 - someday okay I'm coming back to the chat
43:09 - hope people aren't screaming at me
43:12 - saying that it didn't work okay hello
43:14 - everyone did you watch that there's
43:16 - still lost a lot of people okay there's
43:19 - a lot of questions here let me see if I
43:23 - can kind of like scroll back okay so I
43:28 - I'm just seeing more of a discussion but
43:31 - if you have some questions now about
43:32 - what I just showed or anything at all
43:34 - please ask them in the chat I'm gonna
43:36 - see if I can think of like one other
43:38 - little quick topic to do I have to go
43:40 - probably about 10-15 minutes but I'm
43:43 - gonna see if I can do one other thing
43:44 - you just have to bear with me for a
43:46 - second as I kind of look here okay I'm
43:58 - looking I'm gonna look at my where is my
44:00 - I here's my list of ideas yes connect I
44:06 - want to do recording movies out of
44:08 - processing ah this is something I'm
44:09 - gonna do this is perfect yeah everyone's
44:15 - always asking me about this so I'm gonna
44:17 - do this okay the next topic go back to
44:20 - the chat of see if you guys have
44:21 - questions I'm gonna do a quick okay
44:24 - somebody is asking is it possible to
44:27 - download the code later yes it 100% will
44:30 - be I'm going to show you right now where
44:31 - first of all this vid this this will get
44:33 - uploaded as a standalone video to my
44:35 - channel and then I have a github
44:40 - repository github.com slash Schiffman
44:43 - slash video lesson materials so I'm you
44:50 - can see where I am right now I'm gonna
44:51 - link to this in the video's description
44:53 - so you don't need to memorize this but
44:54 - here's where I keep all of the code that
44:57 - with these videos and here it'll
44:59 - probably be under code p5.js and it will
45:03 - this video will get a number or
45:05 - something and the code will be mapped to
45:08 - that based on this number in the title
45:10 - so you'll be able to find it here I will
45:11 - upload it after app you know some point
45:14 - later today
45:16 - is it possible to use p5 in autonomous
45:20 - agents that would be a great topic it's
45:22 - a little bit too big for right now I do
45:25 - have a bunch of videos already about
45:27 - autonomous agents in the processing
45:29 - nature of code playlists those of you
45:32 - are watching live if I go to slash
45:35 - Schiffman when I scroll down under under
45:42 - this one if you go to the nature of code
45:45 - simulating natural systems with
45:46 - processing there's a whole lot of it's
45:48 - more about vectors and chapter 6 is all
45:51 - about autonomous agents so you can take
45:53 - a look at those if you're interested is
45:55 - it possible to use p5 in after-effects
45:57 - great question and in fact it's
46:00 - essentially the next video I want to
46:02 - make the next quick little lesson I want
46:03 - to do will answer that question so it's
46:07 - a little bit tricky to use p5 and After
46:10 - Effects because the the way that I'm
46:11 - thinking about ok so ok there's a bunch
46:14 - of different possibilities here the
46:15 - stuff that you're programming in p5 are
46:17 - processing is logic and algorithms that
46:22 - generate graphics so what you need to do
46:24 - is store the graphics you've generated
46:27 - in some fashion to import it into
46:29 - after-effects easy a way to do that
46:31 - would be to just store every single
46:32 - frame of animation as an image file and
46:35 - then you have an image sequence you
46:36 - bring that into After Effects you do
46:37 - whatever you want with it
46:38 - so that's what I'm going to demonstrate
46:39 - how to do in processing in the next
46:41 - video but you could also think about
46:43 - what are you really doing you're making
46:46 - information so you could create
46:48 - everything as you know data files a big
46:51 - spreadsheet with the X&Y in size and
46:53 - color of every position of everything
46:55 - you're drawing and you could somehow
46:56 - import that and render it in a different
46:58 - way and there are standards for doing
46:59 - that so for example 3d 3d modeling you
47:02 - have these different kinds of formats
47:03 - and obj file and you that's just the
47:05 - data for the geometry and so for After
47:08 - Effects I think you could maybe save
47:10 - everything as
47:10 - vector files SVG files or even I don't
47:13 - know if you could import like JSON files
47:15 - somehow in this particular standard
47:17 - format I don't know after-effects well
47:18 - enough I'm sure somebody could
47:19 - contribute to this discussion well but
47:21 - you absolutely can thanks for your
47:26 - comments Simon that's great to hear
47:28 - while you read the whole nature of good
47:30 - code book in five days that is very
47:32 - exciting to hear all right so I'm gonna
47:35 - move on to the next topic that I want to
47:38 - do I'm just checking Twitter and I'm
47:43 - checking my email to see if anybody has
47:46 - written anything important like please
47:49 - get off the internet No so okay so the
47:51 - next thing I want to do I'm gonna close
47:53 - this and quit this close this save this
47:57 - the cameras are shutting off I'm going
47:58 - to open up prize this three point 0.1
48:01 - let me make sure that is so the next
48:03 - thing I'm going to do is in processing
48:14 - okay so the next topic that I want to
48:17 - demonstrate which also I get questions
48:19 - for a lot is how to record a video of
48:24 - something you made in processing which
48:27 - you could do to import into After
48:29 - Effects to incorporate in another
48:30 - project or just for documentation
48:31 - purposes that sort of thing so let's go
48:34 - I guess my question is what should I use
48:36 - as the demonstration for this I kind of
48:42 - like let's think of I could just do the
48:44 - flocking system mmm that would be the
48:49 - sort of obvious thing I'm looking under
48:50 - fractals oh you know what's kind of
48:52 - would might be nice
48:53 - let's do I got a good idea let me do the
48:57 - game of life let's record this into a
49:03 - movie file because I think what would be
49:06 - interesting about doing this is if I
49:11 - make it 1920 by 1080
49:15 - it runs actually runs remarkably fast
49:19 - let me look at the frame rate for that
49:27 - now that's only 12 frames per second
49:29 - okay so that's good sorry I'm so I'm
49:31 - going to do this but we'll start with
49:33 - 640 by 360 we're going to record this as
49:38 - a video render it as a video I'm going
49:41 - to take out this frame rate okay and
49:47 - take this out I don't need this either
49:52 - and I'm gonna delete this I'm gonna save
49:58 - this as a game of life game of life
50:07 - record and I'll put this on the desktop
50:13 - okay this would be a pretty short video
50:22 - okay okay so what I'm gonna do is
50:26 - demonstrate how to record this to a
50:29 - movie files that you could upload to
50:31 - Vimeo or YouTube or bring it into
50:33 - another project and we'll look at some
50:34 - different ways that you could start and
50:36 - stop recording that type of thing
50:38 - okay and I'm going to see how this goes
50:55 - okay sorry I've like lost my train of
50:57 - thought look at the little glider going
50:58 - on there okay uh here we go
51:03 - test test test oh you know what I'm
51:08 - gonna do I'm going to set this running
51:11 - and so it's running and then hit record
51:14 - hello and welcome in this video I'm
51:17 - going to show you how to take a
51:18 - processing sketch and render it to a
51:20 - movie so this comes up a lot there's
51:22 - probably a variety of ways that you
51:24 - could do this I'm gonna show you a
51:25 - particular technique that hopefully will
51:26 - be useful to you so you know I picked
51:28 - this arbitrarily it's one of the
51:30 - examples from my nature of code
51:32 - materials it is a simulation called the
51:36 - game of life a cellular automata system
51:38 - automata boy I'm never gonna get that
51:40 - right ever in my life and it's just it's
51:42 - a an arbitrary animation but anything
51:46 - anything at all that you draw to the
51:48 - screen and processing you can render as
51:50 - a video out of processing why would you
51:52 - want to do this
51:53 - well there's a variety of reasons one is
51:54 - you might want to upload something to
51:56 - Vimeo or YouTube or some other website
52:00 - to host a video you might want to bring
52:03 - this into another project maybe you're
52:04 - working on the animation and and
52:06 - something like After Effects and you
52:07 - want to have some elements that you've
52:08 - programmed in there I can think of some
52:11 - I'll try to include some examples of
52:12 - people have done this kind of work in a
52:14 - YouTube description below so you might
52:16 - want to take what you're doing
52:17 - incorporate into another project in
52:18 - video form another thing might be
52:20 - actually that you just the thing that
52:22 - you made is beautiful but it runs
52:23 - incredibly slow and you want to you
52:27 - don't need it to run in real time so you
52:28 - could render it as a video so that it
52:30 - could run at 30 frames per second and
52:31 - playback as as an installation or
52:34 - whatever it is you might be doing so
52:35 - let's look at how you might do that and
52:37 - there's there's there's a bunch of steps
52:39 - to it and I'll try to go through them so
52:42 - the first thing that I will show you and
52:45 - you know what this font is remarkably
52:47 - small so let me just show you in
52:48 - processing 3 I can go to the preferences
52:50 - I'm gonna change the editor font to 36
52:53 - and I think that's gonna be a little bit
52:55 - better hopefully you can see that okay
52:57 - so what's the first thing that I want to
52:59 - do to this so what I'm going to do is
53:02 - save so there's there may be some other
53:06 - processing libraries you can get
53:08 - render directly to a movie file but what
53:11 - I'm going to show you how to do instead
53:12 - of rendering directly to a movie file
53:14 - you can always just save what's on the
53:17 - screen as an image so for example if I
53:20 - put save the function save and I say gol
53:28 - dot PNG I'm just gonna put that in draw
53:31 - and I'm going to run it you can see
53:34 - first of all you're gonna if you can
53:35 - tell if it's running slow or not maybe
53:36 - it is maybe it's not I'm gonna close
53:38 - this and I'm gonna go to that sketch
53:40 - folder and you can see right there there
53:42 - now is a file called gol PNG and you can
53:45 - see it's a snapshot of what was on the
53:47 - screen now I was doing that and draw so
53:49 - it was doing it over and over and over
53:51 - again and what we're seeing now is just
53:53 - the last frame that it drew so the save
53:56 - function is away and you might put that
53:57 - in Mouse Prester it attaches you know
53:59 - you might at some point just want to use
54:01 - save just to save a snapshot of what's
54:03 - on the screen but if you use the save
54:05 - frame a function what the save frame
54:08 - function allows you to do is include the
54:12 - pound symbol the hash symbol and what it
54:16 - will do now is auto number the files so
54:19 - every time you call save frame it's
54:21 - going to save GOL underscore one gol
54:24 - underscore two so this now if I'm
54:27 - executing this in draw every time
54:29 - through draw I'm going to get a new
54:31 - image file and I'm gonna run this and
54:33 - I'm gonna try not to run it for very
54:35 - long oops I'll leave it running because
54:37 - now I'm gonna go in and be like oh my
54:39 - goodness and you can see there here it
54:42 - is I have an image file for every single
54:45 - thing that was saved every single frame
54:48 - now I don't like this this is kind of a
54:49 - disaster because I have the zillion
54:51 - files and it's polluting my file system
54:53 - here so I'm gonna delete these and I'm
54:55 - gonna show you what I think would be
54:57 - more useful to do I'm going to make just
54:59 - a directory I'm going to call it output
55:00 - slash gol pound pound pound pound and
55:04 - I'm gonna run this and I'm gonna let it
55:06 - run tempted incident didn't do okay that
55:12 - was enough time and now you can see I
55:15 - have this all here and I can just cycle
55:18 - through it and you can see there it is
55:19 - every single frame and by the way I'm
55:22 - using
55:22 - PNG file format which will save
55:25 - uncompressed so this way the full
55:27 - quality is there in each and every frame
55:29 - this way later on you could choose to
55:32 - compress it or different codec whatever
55:34 - you want to do with your video that's a
55:35 - bit outside the scope so now the
55:37 - question is what do you do with these
55:38 - files so you could bring them into Final
55:42 - Cut Pro or iMovie or MPEG Studio 15 9 zy
55:47 - Pluto magic thing rainbow I don't know
55:50 - it's a repo in there whatever it is you
55:52 - can find your own software lots of
55:53 - software can take an image sequence
55:54 - after-effects will do this for you and
55:56 - render to a movie it so happens that if
55:58 - you want this sort of quick way of doing
56:00 - it processing up here under the Tools
56:03 - menu under tools there is a moviemaker
56:06 - tool so if I go to click here moviemaker
56:09 - and select it it opens up an interface
56:11 - that says this tool and you know if you
56:13 - can read that this tool creates a
56:15 - QuickTime movie from a sequence of
56:16 - images bla bla bla gives you a bunch
56:18 - information all sorts of thing you can
56:20 - do what I'm going to do now is I'm going
56:23 - to go to the finder and I'm gonna find
56:26 - this output folder and I'm going to drag
56:28 - this output folder right here and then
56:31 - I'm gonna look here and say like ok my
56:36 - it's it's it's giving me a default
56:39 - height of 640 by 480 but I want to
56:41 - change that because my processing window
56:43 - itself was 640 by 360
56:45 - what's the frame rate that I want oh and
56:48 - I guess I could have clicked same size
56:49 - as originals in which case it would just
56:51 - use the size of the file and then I can
56:55 - pick whether I want to have some sort of
56:56 - compression I'm gonna pick animation
56:58 - which basically means no compression so
57:00 - I'm gonna get a very big file but I'll
57:02 - be able to bring it in to some other
57:04 - software again if I'm using this in
57:05 - after-effects it's gonna need to be
57:07 - recompressed later so I don't want to
57:09 - compress multiple times so I could also
57:11 - bring in a sound file if I wanted to
57:13 - include some sound with it I'm not going
57:14 - to worry about that and I'm going to hit
57:17 - create movie and it wants me to save it
57:19 - somewhere I'm gonna put it on the
57:22 - desktop as test movie move and hit save
57:25 - and did that already happen did it just
57:29 - like do it so fast normally shows a
57:33 - little progress window but maybe I just
57:34 - had so little
57:36 - a test movie move I'm gonna open this up
57:40 - come on quick time and yep okay so it
57:44 - just happened so fast you can see it
57:45 - there it is so now I have a movie file
57:47 - that I can save Wow amazingly if it was
57:50 - longer you would have probably seen a
57:51 - little progress bar for it rendering it
57:53 - and you can see this is just a QuickTime
57:56 - movie that I'm playing fantastic so
57:57 - that's the basic gist of it in six
58:00 - minutes I kind of showed you the main
58:01 - piece but I think we could do a little
58:04 - bit more here because you might be in a
58:06 - situation where you want to start and
58:08 - stop the rendering to a file you might
58:11 - want to be able to see some information
58:13 - on the screen whether it's rendering or
58:15 - not so I'm just gonna add a couple more
58:17 - pieces of this program just to make it a
58:20 - little bit more sophisticated okay so so
58:24 - one thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to
58:25 - create a boolean variable called
58:27 - recording and I'm going to assume that
58:30 - we're not recording when the program
58:31 - first starts so boolean recording equals
58:35 - false so and then I'm gonna say if
58:37 - recording this is where I should save
58:41 - those frames so the other thing I want
58:43 - to do by the way now that I finished and
58:44 - made that movie maybe you need backups
58:46 - and stuff but I'm just gonna go and
58:47 - delete that folder because I don't want
58:49 - to save the previous I don't need to
58:51 - save those previous RAW files I have
58:53 - everything that I need right here in
58:54 - QuickTime now and I will just save that
58:57 - the the movie file again so now only if
59:02 - only if the boolean variable recording
59:07 - is set to true will it actually save
59:10 - those frames that's a useful thing now
59:13 - what I'm going to do is say let's say
59:16 - what I want to do is have a way okay so
59:19 - if I say you know this isn't that
59:21 - interesting let's use key pressed so if
59:26 - I could say if key equals R or key
59:31 - equals capital R recording equals not
59:36 - recording so what this is going to do is
59:39 - when I'm in JavaScript land a rope
59:42 - function void what this is going to do
59:45 - is it's going to say anytime I press R
59:47 - on the keyboard it will start recording
59:48 - or
59:49 - recording it's gonna toggle the boolean
59:51 - state of recording if we're not true is
59:54 - false not false is true so recording
59:58 - equals not itself if it's false become
60:00 - true if it's true become false so that's
60:03 - gonna happen there anytime I toggle it
60:05 - and you can see like if I run this
60:06 - program and I go to the files we can see
60:12 - that it's not recording if I hit if I
60:15 - click in here and I hit R you can see
60:16 - suddenly new files are appearing
60:19 - if I hit R again those new files will
60:21 - have stopped so simply by adding a quick
60:24 - little something to the program I can
60:26 - kind of turn on and off the recording
60:27 - now also what would be nice here is for
60:30 - me be able to see some visual indication
60:32 - on the screen as to whether it's
60:34 - recording or not so what if I just right
60:38 - here I say okay Phil red otherwise Phil
60:47 - green and draw a circle I don't know at
60:52 - the middle of the screen towards the
60:55 - bottom that's like a circle so if we run
60:59 - this you can see there's a little green
61:01 - this is like terrible visual design but
61:04 - there's a little green circle there when
61:06 - it's not recording and when I hit record
61:08 - that circle turns red when I hit record
61:11 - again that circle turns green I don't
61:12 - know if those are the right colors the
61:13 - right visual indicators you want but you
61:15 - get the idea I can toggle the color of
61:17 - that circle and know whether I'm
61:18 - recording or not very useful but but are
61:21 - you thinking in your mind oh no there's
61:23 - a big problem I don't want a big ugly
61:24 - green or red circle in my video but one
61:28 - thing that's wonderful about the save
61:29 - frame function is it's going to save the
61:34 - current view of the processing window
61:36 - and guess what the circle is drawn after
61:39 - I call save frame so save frames gonna
61:42 - save what's in the window and then draw
61:44 - the circle on top of that that circle
61:46 - won't get saved to the file so we should
61:48 - be able to see if I go back to here and
61:54 - delete that I'm gonna run this and I
61:57 - want to start recording for a little bit
61:59 - it's recording it's recording it's
62:00 - recording recording I want to stop
62:01 - recording and then
62:02 - to close here I'm gonna go and look
62:05 - let's just look at these files
62:06 - no green or red circle so we've done it
62:10 - we're able to add a little visual
62:12 - indicator into our window as to whether
62:14 - it's recording or not I think that's the
62:18 - gist of it I try so let's just like show
62:21 - something sort of nice that we can do
62:22 - here which is that if I were to run this
62:25 - at 1920 by 1080 like super
62:28 - high-resolution and I'm gonna I'm just
62:32 - gonna put print line a frame rate in
62:35 - here so I'm gonna run this you can see
62:37 - that processing is not able to render
62:40 - the game of life it's might be hard for
62:42 - you see this in this sort of like
62:43 - captured video tutorial but it's not
62:45 - able to run this super fast at such high
62:47 - resolution and it's actually quite fast
62:51 - you could see the frame rate is about 14
62:53 - frames per second but I want to make
62:54 - this glorious game of life simulation
62:56 - that runs at 30 frames per second so now
62:59 - if I do this and I hit record you can
63:02 - see by the way it's slowing down
63:03 - also why recording because there is if
63:06 - there's some energy and computation and
63:08 - time that it takes to render these to a
63:10 - file if I run this now run this to
63:13 - render this to a file and I stop
63:16 - recording and I skip out of the program
63:18 - and I go back to tools movie maker and I
63:25 - whoops go up here and I get this output
63:27 - folder and I drag it into here it's the
63:30 - same folder now this needs to be 1920 by
63:34 - 1080 and of course I could just select
63:36 - the same size as originals framerate
63:38 - create movie and I want to do test movie
63:41 - night 1080 and hit save and you can see
63:45 - now you're seeing the little progress
63:47 - window is just not doing it as fast this
63:48 - time it's creating the movie
63:52 - and then it's finished and I'm gonna go
63:56 - to the desktop to look at what I've
63:59 - rendered and test movie 1080 I'm gonna
64:03 - open this up converting so that
64:07 - QuickTime can render it come on
64:10 - QuickTime
64:13 - okay there we go I'm gonna make this
64:15 - fullscreen and then play it you can see
64:17 - I've got my 30 frames per second game of
64:19 - life simulation all programmed in
64:22 - processing so I don't know what just
64:24 - happened some old files in there so it
64:27 - like rendered at the end that so it
64:29 - stitched two together it's stitched like
64:31 - the high-resolution one with the low
64:32 - resolution one together that's kind of
64:34 - interesting so anyway you can see all
64:36 - sorts of possibilities I hope that this
64:39 - helps you with things that you might be
64:41 - making a processing you can do this with
64:42 - 3d you could do this with just about
64:45 - anything and let me know how it goes for
64:47 - you so thanks for watching this video
64:49 - and I will be back soon with more videos
64:54 - and okay chat okay boy there's a lot of
65:02 - discussion in the chat Oh Java ya p5.js
65:06 - and javascript yeah and people are
65:07 - answering the questions okay so I don't
65:10 - know if anyone's still here live
65:12 - dashboard I can usually see wow there's
65:15 - quite a few people still here so I think
65:17 - this ends my time for today I did two
65:20 - quick video lessons about two random
65:23 - topics I don't know how far into the
65:26 - universe whatever I say now will make it
65:28 - but I'm probably not gonna be making too
65:30 - many more videos until March
65:32 - unfortunately I might do a couple the
65:34 - last week of February but starting in
65:36 - March the week of March 7th or 4th
65:41 - something like the second week of March
65:43 - I will be doing hopefully video lessons
65:45 - twice streams twice a week two to three
65:48 - hours each time with lots more content
65:49 - so stay tuned I'm gonna do that in March
65:52 - and in April and in May and in June I
65:54 - only have I don't very little travel
65:56 - then I'm gonna be doing it a lot so
65:59 - hoping to expand the audience and make
66:00 - more stuff and I'm always looking for
66:03 - suggestions and ideas and comments and
66:04 - feedback so let me know you have one or
66:08 - two minutes to ask question to the chat
66:09 - before I turn this thing off and I will
66:11 - look here just check a couple things
66:17 - I don't see anything super crazy check
66:27 - if the chat is going on more comments
66:29 - below
66:32 - you're welcome everybody okay so I don't
66:34 - see any questions in the chat so I'm
66:36 - going to assume this is good for today I
66:38 - have been doing this for only an hour
66:40 - and six minutes somehow I thought it was
66:44 - much longer maybe I should do one more
66:46 - topic look at my list that's all I was
66:50 - already doing this for two hours
66:53 - processing an eclipse oh yeah
66:55 - Oh instance mode in p5.js people have
66:58 - been asking me about that and I'm a
66:59 - little afraid to do that
67:11 - well I think I'm probably actually I'm
67:14 - gonna move on today very tempting but
67:17 - because I don't have that much time
67:18 - anyway so okay so thanks everybody
67:21 - I'm gonna turn this off in a second this
67:22 - whole thing will get archived it has
67:24 - about a half an hour of fail at the
67:25 - beginning where I was trying to fix the
67:26 - audio and then that's that's that so
67:42 - yeah okay so I'm going to turn this off
67:45 - I will be back soon sometime very soon I
67:48 - hope and thanks for listening trouble
67:51 - somebody wants to know how to work with
67:53 - the database these are all good
67:54 - questions yeah you know what you see I
67:57 - was about to make all these videos about
67:58 - parse calm and parse calm decided to
68:02 - close its doors I think was bought by
68:04 - somebody like Facebook or something like
68:05 - that I was thinking of you doing
68:07 - MongoDB labs database as service so this
68:13 - is something I'm gonna look into and do
68:14 - some videos about in the future okay
68:16 - thanks everybody and I'm gonna sign off
68:19 - and I will see you at the next live
68:22 - stream its lots more coming soon but the
68:24 - month of February is a bit tricky for me
68:26 - but I hope to do more and please be in
68:28 - touch
68:28 - okay goodbye everyone I'll still look at
68:31 - the chat even trouble pressing this
68:33 - button to say goodbye okay you're having
68:37 - to do it

in New York hello hello how does the focus okay check your chat voice not good okay one's gonna send the voices not good anyone here I'm going to the hole for a second because when we go too far for audio it's not good if you're watching this in the archives on ticket in 30 seconds yes the voice on the cracker okay let me see what I can do about that wine will be doing test chest is that better test test is this any better now sorry for this technical problem and this is very unfortunate test test tests work say I can yeah guess I could put on headphones I do it let me find my headphones my mic is kaput okay I'm trying to turn anywhere listen you test test test test test is this any better oh it's okay now is it okay now oh great okay okay give me a second everybody okay good I'm glad I fixed it bad cable somewhere if it's too might be too loud because I was turning things up and down let me just get myself resituated confirm that everything is good okay okay oh wait I have to click one thing here okay is it okay now is the audio okay I'm gonna listen with my headphones just to be sure oh great okay great okay so we are back I am back I am 10 minutes into this thing okay so the first 10 minutes of this is hogwash if that's a word that makes any sense to use this context I don't know welcome let me start over again I'm gonna my name is Dan I'm just moving some things around here I'm here live at ITP I actually have not recorded a video or been live sent I'm we're just gonna since 2015 in December was the last time that I recorded anything I've been away and a bunch of things have been going on I am hoping to starting in March my plan is to actually do this twice per week at a regular time where I will do a bunch of different things just random topics answer questions as well as perhaps follow some specific curriculum so there might be like a continuing hood it's kind of like things that you can watch just as a oneoff or things you can watch over time or a place where you can ask questions I haven't really figured at all yet out yet but I'm hoping to focus on this make more videos that sort of things so be in touch on Twitter and the YouTube comments that sort of thing so today I'm really I'm the least prepare for this that I've ever been in the sense that I just happened to be here at ITP so I thought I would turn the setup on and try to make some videos something that I thought about I think that the topic that I'll start with and you guys can think about if you have if you have other questions is something that comes up all the time in my courses is how to make an object like a thing that moves around the screen that stores a history of its path as it's moving around the screen and essentially draws a trail for itself and you can do this by just not erasing the background so you see the trail but what if you want to race the background what if you want to have its path also move and do respond to physics and that sort of thing so this I think is going to be a useful demonstration and then I'll take out so I'm going to do that it's probably 10 or 15 minutes and then I hopefully will think of some other things too or look at my list of topics or take questions and that sort of so so that's that I think I will do this in p5.js I could do it both processing and p5.js excuse me what I was like if like I was about to burp which would be an awkward thing to do in a live stream but it's certainly I'm sure that's happened before what I want to look for is p5.js org download and I want to go down to the editor yeah I don't think on this computer I there is a slightly newer version of the editor version 0.5 0.7 here it comes Donna could delete that and extract this and copy to the desktop replace so I think so yes I want to open it so what I'm going to do here it is first I'm sorry in getting width so I'm gonna get ready for this how am I going to get ready for this the first thing that I'll do is create an object that moves around the screen according to some set of rules maybe we'll do some combination randomness or some combination of Perlin noise so okay so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna make a like ten minute video lesson that's going to be the core material for this but and I'm gonna record that separately and in a post that as a separate video but as a warmup I'm gonna start getting ready for that so to get ready for that the first thing I'm going to do is make a another tab here in the p5 editor I'm just going to call it particle jf and I'm going to make a particle object and that particle object is going to have annex and you'll be able to make the particle object at any given X at any given Y so this this particular tutorial that I'm gonna do is sort of assumes all the foundation stuff with JavaScript programming and p5.js that I've already done in previous videos you guys give me an idea if you have an idea for how this thing should move around the screen that's maybe different than randomness but I'll make a update function and I forget that I'm making a constructor function so this dot update equals function and this dot render show I'm going to do show equals function and we'll make this thing a nice little circle that is perhaps some shade of gray with some alpha and maybe a black outline and update would be like just to get this going right now let's just move it randomly this is kind of not a very interesting thing to do so right now I'm making oh and I'm not I'm sort of out of practice with this I have this in the wrong place is this font size big enough can you get is this clear in watching the video um if you're in the chat well thirtyfive people are watching now that's crazy that's a lot more than I usually have in these like live streams who done this for a while it's a good sign okay hello people who are watching so I'm getting ready to do something interesting that I think will be useful for some of you who are learning about programming and stuff but I'm just sort of getting ready to it the first thing that I've done is just written a constructor function for a very generic particle a particle it just has an x and y the x and y change randomly and it has a function to draw itself as a circle so if I go now I'm going to save this just to the desktop here as history um let me say it make a folder with today's date which is February 9th and I'm going to save this as particle history 1 so now when I go to the main sketch I want to make a variable called P maybe I'll call it particle and say particle new particle 100/100 and I should create a canvas that is I don't know 400 by 300 and I should draw a background which will be slightly gray and I will say particle dot update particle dot show so I just wanted to get something very basic going here in preparation ok particle is not defined aha oh this really should be a feature of this nest nice editor so I need to go to the sidebar under index and I need to add a reference to the particle J s file I'm gonna hide the side I'm doing all this stuff quickly because this is just the preparatory stuff I'm gonna run it ok there we go we got our particle there it is moving randomly ok so I'm getting ready now let's think about this how should we have this particle move in a more interesting way could you please lift both your hands and yell I lost my hands thank you I don't know what that means but I got obliged a strange request to the chat it says I lost my hands I don't know why but well if you just type something the chat asked me to do it I'm not necessarily gonna do it though ok hello everyone live great it's great to see people here in the chat so I would like this particle to move around in a more interesting way how about we use Perlin noise to move it so first of all it's so tiny let's make it a little bit bigger I'll make it 24 that's good and let's have it move with some oh and the cameras are going let's have it move with some pearly noise that's a probably a hole actually you know I don't know if I want to do the purlin purlins noises then this video kind of depends on Perlin noise what if I have it move with well let's just have it be a bouncing ball that's sort of uh pick your nose let's have it just be a bit so let's have it be a bouncing ball so I'm gonna do why I'm gonna add a Y speed and have it change by Y speed only the Y and I'm going to add a gravity variable and I'm gonna have the this dot Y speed change by this gravity and honestly I don't think it makes sense for gravity to be part of the object just make that a global variable this is something interesting to think about a little bit of an aside as I get ready to do this particular lesson that I'm gonna launch into in a second which is that I'm making this thing called a particle and the particle has properties it has its position it has its speed and having to have a size it might have a color and I was about to give it the property of gravity but then I thought to myself gravity that's really conceptually part of the world it's not part of the object so instead I made it a variable outside of the object in this case I don't really matter so much you know all this is just sort of made up anyway for the purpose of something I'm going to show you in a moment and if we do this now if we run this we can see it's falling with gravity and probably under update then I should check if it gets if it goes beyond the screen then let's set its white pipe back onto the screen and reverse its speed into the other direction so now we have this bouncing object okay so we have this object that bounces great and let's have it it's bounced slowed down a little bit when it hits the bottom okay so I think I'm getting ready to do the first recording which will be uploaded as a separate standalone video and in this particular video what I'm going to demonstrate I'm going to say this again in two seconds is I'm going to demonstrate how to have this object store its own path without simple as an array inside of the object itself okay this comes up all the time I've seen people trying to do all sorts of thing with with this and yeah so this will be useful a plate okay sinewave sine wave would have been good too I think we'll do some people do something about sine simple harmonic motion and sine waves maybe in another quick video it's already 1130 because I lost all that time is a stupid audio okay so let me move over here for a second to drink some of this tea can you guys read this okay lighting in here and everything is fine okay I don't really love the bouncing ball things going off my hair okay the ball is going up yeah isn't that interesting I thought I think I just didn't run it again it's a little bit of a rounding issue now now that won't happen now that I open I'm over here okay all right I'm not definitely out of practice doing these so yeah it's good if I do the member I haven't done this in over a month I definitely need to do these every week okay please give it a name it's the name oh you're right it is still going up I guess no I don't know if this I guess I'll be a little bit more I know somebody suggest a name for this party it should be the rainbow blue rain ball rainbow ball ball bow it's a particle I don't like to use the word ball it's not really a ball there so it's really just a particle as a thing on the screen but anyway here we go I'm gonna get ready so I have this other system I got to make sure this works actually because I had a problem with this the other day and so when I have to test something really quickly that's fine record to disk I sim 2015 mp4 16 by 9 okay I'm going to I'm gonna hit record and I'm gonna do test test test this is a test test test I'm testing something to make sure it works okay and now I'm gonna look on the desktop of this computer you can't see what I'm doing and then I make sure something recorded it looks like it recorded and maybe I can I'm gonna turn the audio for a second okay that worked excellent so my recording thing works I got to turn the audio back off so I'm gonna get feedback and close this and it is still going up like crazy and stop it from doing that okay okay here we go I am ready now boy mmm really out of practice on this alright so let's see I'm now going to start hello and welcome to start over it's forever okay I'm gonna close this I'm gonna I'm gonna close my view of the chat and get going on this okay hello welcome in this video I'm going to demonstrate how to take let me run this again how to have an object on the screen store a history of its path now this object just happens to be a bouncing ball it's bouncing up and down but you could maybe have something move and spiral pattern or something move along a sine wave or use something called Perlin noise or move randomly or maybe you've watched them on my other videos where I show how to have things respond to forces the point is you have something that you've already programmed to move around the screen what if you want to draw a trail or to have that history of its path for some other purpose like this comes up a lot so on the one hand you might already say oh I know how to do this right because in the basics of using an environment like processing or p5.js there's this background function and the background function erases the background so if you were to take the background function from draw which is continuously erasing the background and move it in to set up now we can see this object is drawing a trail and you can barely see it moving anymore which is something that I should have considered probably but you can see that it's drawing a trail but it's kind of this is not really a good solution because a it's continuously drawing its trail forever I can't have some things draw one trail something's not draw a trail something's draw a long trail something's wrong sure trail I can't have the things in the trail changing color or moving according to their own set of principles so in order to do something anything any idea that you have that's a bit more sophisticated beyond just see the things sort of like smearing a trail of its path along the screen you're gonna need to keep that background in draw and figure out a way for the object itself to store a history of its own path so let's think about how we might do that I feel obligated to use the whiteboard for a second even though I don't know that it's necessary so let's kind of unpack this a little bit we have on the screen we have a circle maybe it's moving maybe it's your program it's some sort of like ants like insect like creature and it's moving around and what you want is for it to have almost like this like body that it pulls along along its path in some type of way oh this would be a good topic for a video looking at inverse kinematics all that stuff to create like a skeleton oh that's gonna be good it'll do that in another video here we just want the trail so the object if we think of this object as called a particle as a very generic term for a thing moving around the screen this particle has an X this particle has a Y and now what is this particle deed in addition to the X and the y it needs to have something that I'll call a history and that history can be an array because what this particle will do is it stores its X Y as its current location but another property of it is actually an array where it can keep track of older x and y's and older x and y's and older x and y's so let's look at how that might be done so if I come back over here to this particular example you can see the basics of the code right there's a particle object it makes a new particle object in setup and then that particle object update and show where all of the code world the stuff for that particle object is is over here in this constructor function and you can see it's just got some basic stuff it has an X and a Y variable it has a wide speed variable because all this thing is doing is moving up and down it changes Y by Y speed it changes Y speed by gravity it checks if it gets to the bottom then if it gets to the bottom it reverses its direction and then it also has a function to display itself so what I'm suggesting to you here is the first thing that we need to do is add another property to this object the way that we add a property this object is by saying this object this thing this particle thing that's going to be made through this constructor function this dot the name of that property and I'm going to call it a history and I'm going to make it an array so this is a wonderful thing about working in JavaScript I'm after I do this video I'll make a version of this code in processing and I'll upload both examples so you have the p5 and the processing version but the JavaScript version will be a little bit simpler because an array in JavaScript natively is a thing that you can just start as an empty thing and start filling it with stuff whereas in processing in Java I'll have to build the example with something called an ArrayList and I will link to other videos about how ArrayList worked at some point there so okay so this is our first start here we make this history variable so what do we do with that history variable every time the object updates its location every time it moves I want to store where it previously was how do I do that so how do I add something to an array so this is the update function right here right this is where the wat its X&Y location might change it's moving around the screen so what I want to do is add something here where I say this dot history and I want to somehow I would have like add something into this history so the way that you add something to an array in JavaScript it away that one there's many ways you can do it but one way you can sum to add something to the end of that array is with a function called push so if I were to say push dot X what I'm doing is I'm saying take this object's current X location and by the way I can't say X I have to say what JavaScript this dot X I have to take this object's current X and put it into the array so if I did this and ran this program every time an update it would say save its X in the array save its X in the array and that array would just become full of its ex locations and we could do something amusing I don't know how amusing this would be I'm gonna say print its history out and you can see here right I'm getting I'm printing out these arrays and there's just tons of values of 100 because it's X is never changing so why don't I put its Y in there and you can see I look the Y values are just being stored the history of its Y values are being stored in that array oh well maybe I should put both the X and the y and you could sort of see now that array has X Y XY XY X Y X Y so just think of the push function you could just push a bunch of things in the array by separating them but this is this while this is fine it's worth noting that's something that's going to make our life much easier to do this particular example is using something called a vector so let me come back over here for a second and talk briefly about what a vector is if you haven't encountered it before and I'm probably gonna do some other videos and that go through this stuff in more detail but let's say I have an object oh this pen is terrible let's say I have an object whose location is at an x and a y I could have separate x and y variables or I could have a variable that I'll call a vector and what I could do in p5 is I can call a function called create vector and give it two values can you see that you can I've gone off the here look live fixing live editing this is what I do a live editing just gonna move the camera a little bit so you can see that so instead of having a separate X&Y variable I can have a single variable using the create vector function to put an x and y in well why does that work why is that relevant well a vector is essentially one way of thinking of a vector is as an arrow or directions for how to get from one place to another and here in this case an object's location is a vector for how to get from the origin to where it's actually being displayed the you can think of this as a triangle with a y component and an X component so this arrow is a vector so instead of that big array that I want to fill instead of trying to put an X than a Y then an X than Y then an X than a y it'll be much simpler if I say let's put a vector an XY and then put another vector another XY so I can kind of group the history as its position is this XY then its position was this XY that history is a whole bunch of vectors so over here now if I come back to the code what I want to do is I'm gonna say var V V equals create vector this X this dot Y and I'm now going to push that vector into the array and run this again and so now as this program is running as this is running over and over again this history array is getting like bigger and bigger and bigger let's take a look at that let's let's look in the console at this dot history dot length so you can see as the program is running I'm just storing over and over again a vector for every single point that this object has ever been so right if I wanted to draw a trail of everywhere it's ever been then I can simply do that pretty easily because I have all those points in an array I feel like I pause fast questions but I can't pause because I'm just making this as a video okay so we've now we've got the core mechanic here now which is just this which is just like every time as the object gets updated take its current location save a copy of it stored in the array so let's do something with that now let's in the display function I could always now say I could have a loop to go through that entire array and I could draw and of course I'm forgetting to save this this and now this is a little bit what I think might be worth doing here's make a variable called position which is this dot history index I so here what I'm doing is right here this is an important little thing to look at for a second is I want when I'm going to draw this object in addition to drawing its current XY I'm gonna go through and loop through the entire history and pull out each and every spot in history index 0 index 1 index 2 and those things are vectors and I'm going to store them in a variable called pause for a position and now if I want to draw another circle there I can just say pause dot X pause dot Y and I'll make this a smaller circle and we can see now if I run this program you can see it is drawing a circle at every spot in its history and now you know what I I had this idea where like all a bouncing ball is gonna make sense and I just I just don't like it anymore let's let's get rid of this idea of Y speed and grab let's just be much simpler about this and let's just chain and let's get rid of this bouncing thing let's just do what I originally set out to do which I think will demonstrate this idea much better which is just to have it move randomly so I'm just changing this particle to instead of bouncing up and down to have it move randomly so you can see now as it's moving randomly it's leaving a circle everywhere it's ever been in its path and I do I am erasing I am erasing the background each time so this allows me to do lots of different things for example you know each one of those circles could be drawn randomly they're their size could be random you know just so you can see here I don't I don't know what the value of this is but you can see that those things can be animated in their own way I don't particularly like what I've done with randomness but there's a lot of possibilities there so this is the simple idea right that instead of just drawing a circle at its location also store a and a also keep track of an array that stores a copy of its location over time and draw something there so I want to add a few things to this number one is I think it might make sense to limit that history right so one thing we could say is if this dot history dot length is greater than 25 then this dot history dot splice splice is a function that allows you to pull out things from the array and the oldest thing in the array is the first thing index number 0 and I want to just take one thing out of the array so this place function takes two arguments the index where you want to delete something and how many things you want to delete which is just one so now if we run it you can see and let's have it move idle so you can see here and goodbye it left the screen those are too large let me I came back that was nice of it and we could do something like have its size just be I so you can see that come back okay well let's do something else too okay ah so here's the amazing thing about doing this I only have one particle and this is like at first I have this like tiny window so just so we can see more stuff happening let's put that in the middle so what's oh in its Oh ed etre you should have changed your size but you didn't so you can see that this gives you a lot more potential now in things that you can do in terms of having this thing store its own history I like barely scratch the surface if so many better ideas you probably have good ideas too but what I at least want to do is expand this now because the point of having done this and encapsulating this entire idea of the history inside of this object right the entire capturing the history inside of this object now what's possible is let me make this called particles let me not have any particles in setup and let me loop through I'm gonna let me make an array of all the possible particles and let me say particles index i dot update particles index i dot show so now what I've done is I've changed the main program from having just this one single particle to starting with an empty array of particles at any of the particles that are there they all should update in the all should show now of course there's none now why because we haven't added any so now what's exciting about this is let's say anytime I click the mouse let's add write adding something to an array with the push function new particle and let's add it where the mouse is so now if I run this look at this I click there click there all of these objects are all storing their own history and I can just keep making many of them so this is pretty great because now you know and just to demonstrate that the background is 100% the background is not being erased I can have something else move I'm gonna just move frame count modulus width I don't know this is gonna work boy I'm like oh let me not do this I'm just gonna say frame count zero frame count height just to see like there's something moving across the screen that is not drawing a trail so we can have some things draw a trail we can have a lot of control over that trail being that what's the size of that trail do the objects do they change color do they animate that sort of thing so let me like to addictiveness I'm like at 15 minutes you can just stop this and do something else but I want to do a couple more things with this so you see this basic example one thing that I think would be useful to demonstrate is to see that a common thing that you'll want to do is actually draw the trail as oh and I'm over here now so a common thing come on button a common thing that you might want to do is with this object draw the trail as a continuous set of lines like that and a way of doing that is with a begin shape and end shape so I'm going to comment out the ellipse and I can say begin shape at the beginning of the loop and n shape at the end of the loop and just say vertex pause dot X pause dot Y so what I'm actually doing here is making a new shape that's going to appear on this Green and all the vertices of that shape are going to be made up of the history of that object so if I run this and click you can see that shape now weirdly enough that shape is closed and it has a fill so a couple things I want to do is I want to say no fill the other thing I might want to do is I think I want to make this let this be a lot longer and let this be a hundred and we can run this and you can see now you can see that it's drawing this like squiggly line and again if you change this to have it move more smoothly or some other different algorithm you can imagine how useful this might be and again I can have all of them continue to do this now here's the other thing that's amazing about this not only do we have this history stored as data but because we have this history stored as data in an array those things can change so there's no reason why I couldn't say while the object is moving in its update function right it's update function does what it changes the X&Y location then it stores a copy of that exile on location in its history but there's no reason why while it's moving I couldn't also loop through the entire array and have history and I always forget that this this I could say this dot history index I dot X move randomly and index I dot y move randomly so what I've added here is I'm saying aha in addition to the object's location moving its history those points also move as well so now if I draw something you can see that its history is kind of like undulating as it moves as well all those vert vert X's vertices have their own kind of motion tips so again I don't really like necessarily my own visual result here because the only thing I'm using as the driving force behind the motion is randomness but you could imagine what sort of possibilities might there be there in terms of a creature design in terms of color in terms of smooth motion in terms of oscillating motion get boy like having all of those points like sort of oscillating is this if it's like a waving fish or something or waving there's just so many possibilities so I hope that I'm gonna upload this code example complete this upload this video upload the code example make a p5 version make a processing version if you make something built off of this example please share it with me in the comments I don't understand how this video became 20 minutes long but it did and I hope that you found it somewhat useful goodbye and see you in the next video someday okay I'm coming back to the chat hope people aren't screaming at me saying that it didn't work okay hello everyone did you watch that there's still lost a lot of people okay there's a lot of questions here let me see if I can kind of like scroll back okay so I I'm just seeing more of a discussion but if you have some questions now about what I just showed or anything at all please ask them in the chat I'm gonna see if I can think of like one other little quick topic to do I have to go probably about 1015 minutes but I'm gonna see if I can do one other thing you just have to bear with me for a second as I kind of look here okay I'm looking I'm gonna look at my where is my I here's my list of ideas yes connect I want to do recording movies out of processing ah this is something I'm gonna do this is perfect yeah everyone's always asking me about this so I'm gonna do this okay the next topic go back to the chat of see if you guys have questions I'm gonna do a quick okay somebody is asking is it possible to download the code later yes it 100% will be I'm going to show you right now where first of all this vid this this will get uploaded as a standalone video to my channel and then I have a github repository github.com slash Schiffman slash video lesson materials so I'm you can see where I am right now I'm gonna link to this in the video's description so you don't need to memorize this but here's where I keep all of the code that with these videos and here it'll probably be under code p5.js and it will this video will get a number or something and the code will be mapped to that based on this number in the title so you'll be able to find it here I will upload it after app you know some point later today is it possible to use p5 in autonomous agents that would be a great topic it's a little bit too big for right now I do have a bunch of videos already about autonomous agents in the processing nature of code playlists those of you are watching live if I go to slash Schiffman when I scroll down under under this one if you go to the nature of code simulating natural systems with processing there's a whole lot of it's more about vectors and chapter 6 is all about autonomous agents so you can take a look at those if you're interested is it possible to use p5 in aftereffects great question and in fact it's essentially the next video I want to make the next quick little lesson I want to do will answer that question so it's a little bit tricky to use p5 and After Effects because the the way that I'm thinking about ok so ok there's a bunch of different possibilities here the stuff that you're programming in p5 are processing is logic and algorithms that generate graphics so what you need to do is store the graphics you've generated in some fashion to import it into aftereffects easy a way to do that would be to just store every single frame of animation as an image file and then you have an image sequence you bring that into After Effects you do whatever you want with it so that's what I'm going to demonstrate how to do in processing in the next video but you could also think about what are you really doing you're making information so you could create everything as you know data files a big spreadsheet with the X&Y in size and color of every position of everything you're drawing and you could somehow import that and render it in a different way and there are standards for doing that so for example 3d 3d modeling you have these different kinds of formats and obj file and you that's just the data for the geometry and so for After Effects I think you could maybe save everything as vector files SVG files or even I don't know if you could import like JSON files somehow in this particular standard format I don't know aftereffects well enough I'm sure somebody could contribute to this discussion well but you absolutely can thanks for your comments Simon that's great to hear while you read the whole nature of good code book in five days that is very exciting to hear all right so I'm gonna move on to the next topic that I want to do I'm just checking Twitter and I'm checking my email to see if anybody has written anything important like please get off the internet No so okay so the next thing I want to do I'm gonna close this and quit this close this save this the cameras are shutting off I'm going to open up prize this three point 0.1 let me make sure that is so the next thing I'm going to do is in processing okay so the next topic that I want to demonstrate which also I get questions for a lot is how to record a video of something you made in processing which you could do to import into After Effects to incorporate in another project or just for documentation purposes that sort of thing so let's go I guess my question is what should I use as the demonstration for this I kind of like let's think of I could just do the flocking system mmm that would be the sort of obvious thing I'm looking under fractals oh you know what's kind of would might be nice let's do I got a good idea let me do the game of life let's record this into a movie file because I think what would be interesting about doing this is if I make it 1920 by 1080 it runs actually runs remarkably fast let me look at the frame rate for that now that's only 12 frames per second okay so that's good sorry I'm so I'm going to do this but we'll start with 640 by 360 we're going to record this as a video render it as a video I'm going to take out this frame rate okay and take this out I don't need this either and I'm gonna delete this I'm gonna save this as a game of life game of life record and I'll put this on the desktop okay this would be a pretty short video okay okay so what I'm gonna do is demonstrate how to record this to a movie files that you could upload to Vimeo or YouTube or bring it into another project and we'll look at some different ways that you could start and stop recording that type of thing okay and I'm going to see how this goes okay sorry I've like lost my train of thought look at the little glider going on there okay uh here we go test test test oh you know what I'm gonna do I'm going to set this running and so it's running and then hit record hello and welcome in this video I'm going to show you how to take a processing sketch and render it to a movie so this comes up a lot there's probably a variety of ways that you could do this I'm gonna show you a particular technique that hopefully will be useful to you so you know I picked this arbitrarily it's one of the examples from my nature of code materials it is a simulation called the game of life a cellular automata system automata boy I'm never gonna get that right ever in my life and it's just it's a an arbitrary animation but anything anything at all that you draw to the screen and processing you can render as a video out of processing why would you want to do this well there's a variety of reasons one is you might want to upload something to Vimeo or YouTube or some other website to host a video you might want to bring this into another project maybe you're working on the animation and and something like After Effects and you want to have some elements that you've programmed in there I can think of some I'll try to include some examples of people have done this kind of work in a YouTube description below so you might want to take what you're doing incorporate into another project in video form another thing might be actually that you just the thing that you made is beautiful but it runs incredibly slow and you want to you don't need it to run in real time so you could render it as a video so that it could run at 30 frames per second and playback as as an installation or whatever it is you might be doing so let's look at how you might do that and there's there's there's a bunch of steps to it and I'll try to go through them so the first thing that I will show you and you know what this font is remarkably small so let me just show you in processing 3 I can go to the preferences I'm gonna change the editor font to 36 and I think that's gonna be a little bit better hopefully you can see that okay so what's the first thing that I want to do to this so what I'm going to do is save so there's there may be some other processing libraries you can get render directly to a movie file but what I'm going to show you how to do instead of rendering directly to a movie file you can always just save what's on the screen as an image so for example if I put save the function save and I say gol dot PNG I'm just gonna put that in draw and I'm going to run it you can see first of all you're gonna if you can tell if it's running slow or not maybe it is maybe it's not I'm gonna close this and I'm gonna go to that sketch folder and you can see right there there now is a file called gol PNG and you can see it's a snapshot of what was on the screen now I was doing that and draw so it was doing it over and over and over again and what we're seeing now is just the last frame that it drew so the save function is away and you might put that in Mouse Prester it attaches you know you might at some point just want to use save just to save a snapshot of what's on the screen but if you use the save frame a function what the save frame function allows you to do is include the pound symbol the hash symbol and what it will do now is auto number the files so every time you call save frame it's going to save GOL underscore one gol underscore two so this now if I'm executing this in draw every time through draw I'm going to get a new image file and I'm gonna run this and I'm gonna try not to run it for very long oops I'll leave it running because now I'm gonna go in and be like oh my goodness and you can see there here it is I have an image file for every single thing that was saved every single frame now I don't like this this is kind of a disaster because I have the zillion files and it's polluting my file system here so I'm gonna delete these and I'm gonna show you what I think would be more useful to do I'm going to make just a directory I'm going to call it output slash gol pound pound pound pound and I'm gonna run this and I'm gonna let it run tempted incident didn't do okay that was enough time and now you can see I have this all here and I can just cycle through it and you can see there it is every single frame and by the way I'm using PNG file format which will save uncompressed so this way the full quality is there in each and every frame this way later on you could choose to compress it or different codec whatever you want to do with your video that's a bit outside the scope so now the question is what do you do with these files so you could bring them into Final Cut Pro or iMovie or MPEG Studio 15 9 zy Pluto magic thing rainbow I don't know it's a repo in there whatever it is you can find your own software lots of software can take an image sequence aftereffects will do this for you and render to a movie it so happens that if you want this sort of quick way of doing it processing up here under the Tools menu under tools there is a moviemaker tool so if I go to click here moviemaker and select it it opens up an interface that says this tool and you know if you can read that this tool creates a QuickTime movie from a sequence of images bla bla bla gives you a bunch information all sorts of thing you can do what I'm going to do now is I'm going to go to the finder and I'm gonna find this output folder and I'm going to drag this output folder right here and then I'm gonna look here and say like ok my it's it's it's giving me a default height of 640 by 480 but I want to change that because my processing window itself was 640 by 360 what's the frame rate that I want oh and I guess I could have clicked same size as originals in which case it would just use the size of the file and then I can pick whether I want to have some sort of compression I'm gonna pick animation which basically means no compression so I'm gonna get a very big file but I'll be able to bring it in to some other software again if I'm using this in aftereffects it's gonna need to be recompressed later so I don't want to compress multiple times so I could also bring in a sound file if I wanted to include some sound with it I'm not going to worry about that and I'm going to hit create movie and it wants me to save it somewhere I'm gonna put it on the desktop as test movie move and hit save and did that already happen did it just like do it so fast normally shows a little progress window but maybe I just had so little a test movie move I'm gonna open this up come on quick time and yep okay so it just happened so fast you can see it there it is so now I have a movie file that I can save Wow amazingly if it was longer you would have probably seen a little progress bar for it rendering it and you can see this is just a QuickTime movie that I'm playing fantastic so that's the basic gist of it in six minutes I kind of showed you the main piece but I think we could do a little bit more here because you might be in a situation where you want to start and stop the rendering to a file you might want to be able to see some information on the screen whether it's rendering or not so I'm just gonna add a couple more pieces of this program just to make it a little bit more sophisticated okay so so one thing I'm gonna do is I'm going to create a boolean variable called recording and I'm going to assume that we're not recording when the program first starts so boolean recording equals false so and then I'm gonna say if recording this is where I should save those frames so the other thing I want to do by the way now that I finished and made that movie maybe you need backups and stuff but I'm just gonna go and delete that folder because I don't want to save the previous I don't need to save those previous RAW files I have everything that I need right here in QuickTime now and I will just save that the the movie file again so now only if only if the boolean variable recording is set to true will it actually save those frames that's a useful thing now what I'm going to do is say let's say what I want to do is have a way okay so if I say you know this isn't that interesting let's use key pressed so if I could say if key equals R or key equals capital R recording equals not recording so what this is going to do is when I'm in JavaScript land a rope function void what this is going to do is it's going to say anytime I press R on the keyboard it will start recording or recording it's gonna toggle the boolean state of recording if we're not true is false not false is true so recording equals not itself if it's false become true if it's true become false so that's gonna happen there anytime I toggle it and you can see like if I run this program and I go to the files we can see that it's not recording if I hit if I click in here and I hit R you can see suddenly new files are appearing if I hit R again those new files will have stopped so simply by adding a quick little something to the program I can kind of turn on and off the recording now also what would be nice here is for me be able to see some visual indication on the screen as to whether it's recording or not so what if I just right here I say okay Phil red otherwise Phil green and draw a circle I don't know at the middle of the screen towards the bottom that's like a circle so if we run this you can see there's a little green this is like terrible visual design but there's a little green circle there when it's not recording and when I hit record that circle turns red when I hit record again that circle turns green I don't know if those are the right colors the right visual indicators you want but you get the idea I can toggle the color of that circle and know whether I'm recording or not very useful but but are you thinking in your mind oh no there's a big problem I don't want a big ugly green or red circle in my video but one thing that's wonderful about the save frame function is it's going to save the current view of the processing window and guess what the circle is drawn after I call save frame so save frames gonna save what's in the window and then draw the circle on top of that that circle won't get saved to the file so we should be able to see if I go back to here and delete that I'm gonna run this and I want to start recording for a little bit it's recording it's recording it's recording recording I want to stop recording and then to close here I'm gonna go and look let's just look at these files no green or red circle so we've done it we're able to add a little visual indicator into our window as to whether it's recording or not I think that's the gist of it I try so let's just like show something sort of nice that we can do here which is that if I were to run this at 1920 by 1080 like super highresolution and I'm gonna I'm just gonna put print line a frame rate in here so I'm gonna run this you can see that processing is not able to render the game of life it's might be hard for you see this in this sort of like captured video tutorial but it's not able to run this super fast at such high resolution and it's actually quite fast you could see the frame rate is about 14 frames per second but I want to make this glorious game of life simulation that runs at 30 frames per second so now if I do this and I hit record you can see by the way it's slowing down also why recording because there is if there's some energy and computation and time that it takes to render these to a file if I run this now run this to render this to a file and I stop recording and I skip out of the program and I go back to tools movie maker and I whoops go up here and I get this output folder and I drag it into here it's the same folder now this needs to be 1920 by 1080 and of course I could just select the same size as originals framerate create movie and I want to do test movie night 1080 and hit save and you can see now you're seeing the little progress window is just not doing it as fast this time it's creating the movie and then it's finished and I'm gonna go to the desktop to look at what I've rendered and test movie 1080 I'm gonna open this up converting so that QuickTime can render it come on QuickTime okay there we go I'm gonna make this fullscreen and then play it you can see I've got my 30 frames per second game of life simulation all programmed in processing so I don't know what just happened some old files in there so it like rendered at the end that so it stitched two together it's stitched like the highresolution one with the low resolution one together that's kind of interesting so anyway you can see all sorts of possibilities I hope that this helps you with things that you might be making a processing you can do this with 3d you could do this with just about anything and let me know how it goes for you so thanks for watching this video and I will be back soon with more videos and okay chat okay boy there's a lot of discussion in the chat Oh Java ya p5.js and javascript yeah and people are answering the questions okay so I don't know if anyone's still here live dashboard I can usually see wow there's quite a few people still here so I think this ends my time for today I did two quick video lessons about two random topics I don't know how far into the universe whatever I say now will make it but I'm probably not gonna be making too many more videos until March unfortunately I might do a couple the last week of February but starting in March the week of March 7th or 4th something like the second week of March I will be doing hopefully video lessons twice streams twice a week two to three hours each time with lots more content so stay tuned I'm gonna do that in March and in April and in May and in June I only have I don't very little travel then I'm gonna be doing it a lot so hoping to expand the audience and make more stuff and I'm always looking for suggestions and ideas and comments and feedback so let me know you have one or two minutes to ask question to the chat before I turn this thing off and I will look here just check a couple things I don't see anything super crazy check if the chat is going on more comments below you're welcome everybody okay so I don't see any questions in the chat so I'm going to assume this is good for today I have been doing this for only an hour and six minutes somehow I thought it was much longer maybe I should do one more topic look at my list that's all I was already doing this for two hours processing an eclipse oh yeah Oh instance mode in p5.js people have been asking me about that and I'm a little afraid to do that well I think I'm probably actually I'm gonna move on today very tempting but because I don't have that much time anyway so okay so thanks everybody I'm gonna turn this off in a second this whole thing will get archived it has about a half an hour of fail at the beginning where I was trying to fix the audio and then that's that's that so yeah okay so I'm going to turn this off I will be back soon sometime very soon I hope and thanks for listening trouble somebody wants to know how to work with the database these are all good questions yeah you know what you see I was about to make all these videos about parse calm and parse calm decided to close its doors I think was bought by somebody like Facebook or something like that I was thinking of you doing MongoDB labs database as service so this is something I'm gonna look into and do some videos about in the future okay thanks everybody and I'm gonna sign off and I will see you at the next live stream its lots more coming soon but the month of February is a bit tricky for me but I hope to do more and please be in touch okay goodbye everyone I'll still look at the chat even trouble pressing this button to say goodbye okay you're having to do it
