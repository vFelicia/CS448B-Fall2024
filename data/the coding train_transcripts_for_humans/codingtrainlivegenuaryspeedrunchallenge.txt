05:34 - thank you
05:41 - well hello everybody
05:44 - I'm a strange color
05:47 - hold on a second
05:50 - I really thought
05:52 - I had fixed everything and I'm gonna go
05:54 - to this camera and I'm just gonna put it
05:58 - on auto white balance
06:02 - Auto white balance okay hopefully that's
06:06 - going to make everything better
06:09 - hello happy Sunday welcome to a live
06:14 - episode of the coding train with me your
06:17 - host Dan wearing my Baltimore Orioles
06:20 - cap and really really just not sure at
06:24 - all
06:25 - if this is a good idea or not but I am
06:28 - going to Jump Right In let me just sort
06:30 - of like take a look at the chat
06:33 - um yeah I don't know what's going on
06:35 - with my camera settings maybe I look
06:37 - okay now uh maybe the lights a little
06:39 - bright I'm not going to get worried
06:41 - about it too much uh Raphael is in the
06:45 - chat Rafael Sable Ralph Sable wrath
06:47 - Sable Rafe
06:48 - is the inspiration for today although to
06:51 - be honest I did have this idea in my
06:54 - head although I would never have thought
06:56 - to call it a speed run or thought about
06:59 - it as like a thing just kind of like oh
07:02 - hey I'm not really having time for this
07:04 - January thing let me see if I could just
07:06 - do a live stream and like do a whole
07:07 - bunch of them that was as far as I had
07:09 - thought then I saw Rafael who has a
07:12 - wonderful twitch stream I think there's
07:14 - a link in the video description that you
07:15 - should check out he may actually be live
07:17 - streaming right now I'm not sure uh
07:20 - creative coding news and the weekly
07:22 - coding challenge so much stuff wonderful
07:24 - stuff going on there
07:26 - um that he is doing so you should
07:27 - definitely check out
07:29 - um Raphael's twitch stream so but I'm
07:31 - here
07:32 - to attempt
07:33 - uh you know what I think is a Young
07:35 - Person's game and I I am not a young
07:38 - person no more I was at one point in my
07:42 - life but when I was young there was no
07:44 - YouTube there really was no YouTube I
07:47 - had no way of bringing myself to you the
07:51 - viewers that I do now so I just have to
07:53 - do it as an old person and
07:56 - most of the time that involves me
07:58 - falling flat on my face and yet
08:00 - here we are again so you might not have
08:02 - seen me in a while I've been I've been
08:04 - kind of experimenting with YouTube
08:06 - shorts I know people love short form
08:08 - videos you can see it in the comments
08:10 - nobody ever has a negative thing to say
08:12 - about a short
08:14 - um but um which has been sort of a fun
08:16 - experiment I hope to do more of that I
08:18 - have a lot of ideas for them I just
08:19 - haven't figured out a kind of way of
08:21 - getting it into a regular weekly
08:23 - workflow a huge thanks to Bernie uh who
08:27 - has been working on the editing and
08:29 - production along with a creative team of
08:31 - folks that he works with
08:34 - um you know you can find out more about
08:35 - that if you check out my Twitter feed if
08:37 - you can bear to go on Twitter which I
08:39 - barely can these days but I'm still
08:41 - using it because I don't know what else
08:43 - to use YouTube Community posts
08:47 - anyway
08:48 - um
08:49 - ah so I I have a um I was on a year
08:52 - sabbatical and I had this whole list of
08:54 - projects and my sabbaticals now over and
08:56 - I'm still trying to do those projects
08:58 - one of which is a new full start to
09:01 - finish learn to code with processing
09:03 - complete beginner series I've recorded
09:06 - maybe a third of it now
09:09 - um hopefully you know certainly by the
09:11 - end of February I would hope that it
09:12 - would be out so that's kind of why I
09:14 - haven't been making new content because
09:15 - I'm recording this it's just gonna come
09:17 - out as one three or four hour Chunk on
09:21 - YouTube
09:22 - um I'm working on the nature of code
09:23 - book it did not hit my deadline but I am
09:25 - making progress without I would talk
09:27 - about all these things like I usually do
09:28 - on a live stream but we don't have time
09:30 - for that today
09:32 - um to Fox the bomb ass do I wear shorts
09:35 - in the winter well guess what I wore
09:38 - shorts today outside because I am now uh
09:40 - training for the Brooklyn half marathon
09:42 - which is on May 20th I had my first day
09:45 - of training today and that was like an
09:47 - easy two mile jog
09:49 - um and
09:51 - um
09:52 - uh yeah I wear shorts It's not that it's
09:55 - not that chilly today it's in the 40s in
09:57 - Fahrenheit that is
09:58 - okay
10:00 - um
10:02 - so I I'm reading the chat and I'm
10:06 - reading the comments what about Mastodon
10:08 - I have attempted it I have made
10:10 - tutorials in Mastodon I have a mastodon
10:12 - account
10:13 - I don't know I just haven't had um the
10:16 - time to really
10:18 - fully just just to like sort of move
10:21 - myself to a new platform I don't I
10:23 - barely use this stuff anyway so but yes
10:25 - I in in theory Mastodon is the perfect
10:29 - place for me and yet I can't seem to
10:31 - manage to do it
10:33 - um all right so
10:36 - go Seb for the London 10K
10:39 - I did actually run the London marathon
10:41 - is that the shirt that I'm wearing no
10:44 - this is a I got a a New York City
10:46 - marathon I have run three marathons I
10:48 - don't think I will ever do that again
10:50 - but a half marathon is I feel like a
10:52 - perfectly reasonable goal at my age and
10:55 - abilities
10:57 - um okay so
10:59 - um uh thank you Rafael for the if I
11:02 - point this way right for the live split
11:04 - that's showing up here let's move over
11:06 - here
11:07 - um I'm I don't know whether to use
11:08 - processing or P5 or something else even
11:10 - I just kind of have processing open
11:12 - let's go to the browser
11:15 - um I did make a repo a GitHub repo where
11:18 - I intend to and I would love help with
11:22 - this where I intend to document
11:24 - everything I do today here but I'm not
11:26 - going to do it while I'm coding so I'm
11:28 - gonna have to do this after the fact and
11:31 - anybody who wants to help with that I
11:32 - mean it's certainly uh you know help
11:35 - with it like pull request I don't know
11:37 - if it would make sense for you to like
11:38 - pull request stuff while I'm going or
11:39 - file issues but um yeah
11:43 - um all right lots of wonderful questions
11:44 - in the chat we don't got time for this
11:45 - today because Raphael completed this in
11:48 - five hours and 48 minutes
11:50 - and if I'm still here 5 hours and 48 for
11:53 - minutes from now we've got a big problem
11:55 - because I cannot stream for you know
11:58 - I've got children who need to have
12:00 - dinner uh do their homework I've got a
12:04 - dog who needs to be walked so
12:06 - I think that if I could go ease I could
12:10 - certainly go for two and a half hours
12:14 - um
12:15 - so
12:17 - let's see how it goes all right so just
12:20 - to talk about what this is if you're not
12:23 - familiar January
12:25 - January is a artificially generated
12:29 - month of time where we the community of
12:32 - people of the of Earth I don't know
12:35 - maybe the aliens or the aliens doing
12:36 - January build code that makes beautiful
12:39 - things I will not be making beautiful
12:41 - things today I will be building code
12:43 - over 744 hours for every 24 hours
12:46 - there's a new prompt you don't have to
12:48 - follow the prompt exactly or even at all
12:50 - but you know we put effort into this any
12:52 - language free framework or medium on any
12:55 - Planet see the millions are
12:58 - the aliens are doing January made of
13:00 - hashtags uh so you can do all that stuff
13:03 - tips and tricks so uh and then there are
13:06 - prompts so I'm going to start with
13:09 - January one you can see I have the live
13:10 - split thing here going it if it all goes
13:13 - according to plan as soon as I hit this
13:14 - key over here it will start when I
13:16 - finish this one I hit the key it goes on
13:18 - to the next one
13:20 - um let's set up some rules for myself
13:21 - let's I have a new whiteboard camera so
13:25 - I might as well come over here let's
13:26 - make up some rules and I'm um
13:31 - um
13:31 - um okay there is life split does have a
13:33 - pause but I don't tend to use it okay
13:36 - rule number one
13:38 - no rules
13:42 - who cares this is just for fun for
13:45 - educational slash entertainment purposes
13:48 - you pick one of those if it's both then
13:51 - boy I could just retire and this is the
13:53 - last live stream I will ever do no rules
13:55 - two
13:57 - um I but but if there were rules
14:00 - I can start
14:03 - from a coding challenge
14:06 - or any coding train video so I can start
14:09 - from any example that I've previously
14:10 - made but I don't want to just take the
14:14 - example and say I'm done
14:16 - so what is a threshold I must at least
14:19 - at least
14:22 - change
14:24 - uh one uh Behavior
14:29 - a behavior or visual element
14:36 - mildly
14:37 - significantly that's not proper English
14:40 - but you get the idea
14:42 - somebody I can ask chat GPT to clean
14:45 - that up for me
14:47 - um I am done
14:50 - uh prompt
14:53 - is complete
14:56 - when
14:58 - I see
15:01 - um
15:02 - uh uh what's a good Emoji for the chat
15:05 - the train emoji
15:07 - you can flood the chat with train emojis
15:11 - if you think I'm good to go or
15:13 - if I say so
15:18 - uh
15:20 - quantity
15:24 - over quality
15:26 - I'm trying to get through the whole
15:28 - thing they're not going to be brilliant
15:30 - they're not going to be sophisticated
15:32 - they're not going to be beautiful
15:33 - they're just going to be a thing that I
15:36 - did and like if you think about it if
15:38 - we're talking to let's say two hours 120
15:41 - Minutes
15:42 - that's like four minutes per prompt if
15:44 - there's 30 prompts there's 31 prompt but
15:46 - technically I could just do up to 29.
15:48 - since that's today and I could do the
15:50 - other two but it wouldn't be the full
15:51 - speed run all right I'm gonna go look at
15:53 - the chat to see if anybody has anything
15:54 - to say about these rules
15:59 - is that is that even in Focus I don't
16:01 - know but you get the idea okay
16:04 - um
16:06 - so
16:08 - uh okay
16:10 - um
16:12 - mildly significant digits is the name of
16:15 - my next band says Chris
16:19 - um
16:19 - uh Yaz hire yazarax asks been under a
16:24 - rock for a while welcome back I hope you
16:26 - had a nice time under your rock
16:29 - I'm on the wrong screen uh here we are
16:32 - um and
16:34 - um do you have any open AI videos yet uh
16:37 - not really I made one short which is
16:40 - kind of like a bit of a jokey thing with
16:42 - chat gbt and I have been working on a
16:46 - lot of experiments uh fine-tuning gpt3
16:49 - to my own bizarre tastes
16:53 - um and I've been enjoying that but I
16:56 - haven't made any videos about it yet
16:59 - okay anybody have anything they must say
17:05 - um before
17:08 - um do I take a drink of coffee every
17:10 - time you say oops rule number five I
17:13 - like that anybody else have anything
17:15 - else they want to say should I I will
17:19 - you indulge me with one plug
17:21 - um
17:22 - I have been working a lot with the
17:24 - wonderful streaming service called
17:25 - nebula and I have a new page on nebula
17:30 - um which is right here if you go to
17:34 - go.nebula.tv codingtrain this is a paid
17:37 - service it is a way of supporting the
17:38 - coding train uh I uh anybody who signs
17:41 - up to the coding train I I I'm a
17:43 - co-owner of nebula and there's a revenue
17:45 - sharing thing but I you know I'm I'm
17:47 - really interested in alternatives to
17:49 - YouTube and I think there's a lot of
17:50 - wonderful things about this platform
17:51 - that I can go on and on about in
17:53 - particular
17:55 - um all of these amazing originals and
17:58 - classes uh original content some really
18:00 - fantastic
18:01 - um so if you like sort of documentaries
18:03 - and educational content science if you
18:06 - like movies you're gonna find stuff
18:07 - Patrick Williams glasses this thumbnail
18:10 - is like this is like I aspire to make a
18:13 - thumbnail as good as this someday
18:16 - um so anyway please check that out if
18:18 - you're interested I made a class uh
18:19 - using an apple II that you would get it
18:21 - I I used to talk about this as a bundle
18:24 - with curiosity stream no
18:26 - forget about I mean curiosity stream
18:28 - great go sign up for curiosity stream
18:29 - I'm now encouraging people to actually
18:31 - just sign up for nebula directly it is
18:33 - four dollars a month with the discount
18:35 - if you go through

18:39 - mention that as my little plug thank you
18:40 - for that Indulgence now
18:44 - are you ready
18:46 - are we ready I see kvikbon is in the
18:50 - chat
18:52 - uh excellent I always like to have some
18:54 - moderators in the chat that are helping
18:55 - me out all right
18:57 - it's also cold in here because I I ran
19:00 - the heat I got this very loud uh heater
19:02 - because I'm in a garage it's just like
19:04 - an electric fan thing that hangs from
19:06 - the ceiling but I turned it off to
19:08 - stream so I might have to turn it on at
19:10 - some point if it gets too cold are you
19:12 - ready for this
19:18 - uh uh I should put on some music I feel
19:20 - like one thing also is I might try to do
19:23 - some of this without talking through it
19:25 - so much because uh it'll help you go
19:28 - faster and it'll also save my voice I'm
19:30 - back teaching again at NYU this semester
19:32 - I gave a presentation yesterday I'm
19:34 - streaming today I want to record videos
19:35 - tomorrow I've got to teach Wednesday and
19:36 - Thursday I have a problem losing my
19:38 - voice I should probably go to like a
19:40 - vocal coach
19:42 - to make sure I'm breathing and speaking
19:44 - correctly but um yeah so here we go
19:46 - everybody
20:04 - this would be really sad if this doesn't
20:06 - work
20:07 - ah shoot okay wait do I come on I set up
20:10 - my uh hotkeys
20:12 - number lock one go there we go okay here
20:16 - we go uh the timer's going okay perfect
20:20 - Loop infinite Loop endless gifts okay
20:22 - this would actually be a good time to
20:24 - use P5 because of the new safe get fun
20:27 - until I get into the B5 web editor hell
20:31 - okay uh let's name this so we can find
20:34 - all these later January 1.
20:37 - all right
20:39 - um
20:40 - I did a whole like short about save
20:42 - gifts let's go to save gif
20:46 - uh save GIF function no no no no no no
20:49 - no no no no no no
20:52 - um this is like the greatest thing ever
20:53 - uh let's let's do this
20:56 - okay
20:58 - um I'm gonna bring this copy pasting
21:01 - code from anywhere on the Internet is
21:04 - also okay
21:05 - just asking chat GPT to do it for me
21:08 - though not okay
21:11 - um okay I have my limits people okay
21:14 - save GIF five seconds buddy I want it to
21:16 - be a looping GIF so I want it to be
21:18 - frames there's a way that I do this it
21:22 - tells me here
21:24 - um duration options options can have a
21:29 - delay
21:31 - a string that can either be seconds or
21:34 - frames
21:35 - huh
21:37 - an optional object that can contain two
21:40 - or more arguments delay units okay
21:44 - so I want it to be like
21:47 - some number of frames and I want the
21:50 - units to be
21:52 - frames
21:55 - and let's say
21:57 - uh
21:58 - frames equals make a variable
22:04 - like like 360 frames I don't know what's
22:06 - going on here uh let's have an angle
22:11 - and then let's say uh angle mode degrees
22:18 - angle equals angle plus one all right so
22:22 - now we just need to do something with
22:23 - like sine or cosine
22:26 - um let's do line from okay let's do
22:31 - translate I I really have no idea what
22:34 - I'm doing here
22:35 - making this up as I go I wish I could
22:37 - look at the chat to get good suggestions
22:39 - uh translate to negative width divided
22:42 - by two
22:44 - zero with divided by 2 comma zero I
22:47 - don't okay let's just see let's put on
22:49 - auto refresh which is dangerous because
22:52 - okay so that's good I like this
22:55 - um let's say background zero with let's
22:56 - put some Alpha in there oh let's make
22:59 - that a variable like let r equal with
23:01 - divided by two
23:04 - negative r
23:07 - our stroke weight 4 stroke 255
23:13 - all right I've got a line uh let's have
23:16 - that be times cosine of the angle
23:20 - okay I like this and now let's also uh
23:24 - rotate by that angle
23:31 - okay yeah this is good it's a good start
23:34 - I've got something going here
23:36 - dude
23:38 - [Music]
23:40 - now the thing is if I'm doing this
23:42 - background thing
23:44 - I have a feeling it's not gonna like
23:46 - look like it's looping done still done
23:49 - yes I agree but the thing is so now I
23:51 - need to hit s all right let's see what
23:54 - happens
23:57 - delay parameter must be a number oh I
23:59 - forgot
24:01 - delay parameter must be a number it is a
24:03 - number 360. did I not do that right
24:07 - uh duration
24:10 - delay oh I have to have a delay
24:13 - okay
24:14 - uh
24:16 - come on delay
24:19 - zero
24:22 - okay
24:25 - and go
24:30 - all right let's get our gif
24:35 - okay downloading my gif
24:48 - I don't understand how that worked but
24:49 - it did awesome I'm done
24:52 - boom that was four minutes and 38
24:54 - seconds take that
24:57 - January
24:59 - that they're not my you're my friend
25:01 - January so take that just yay thank you
25:03 - okay prompt number two that was awesome
25:05 - okay
25:06 - prompt number two yeah four minutes
25:08 - that's what I got to do to get done in
25:09 - two and a half hours uh prompt
25:12 - made it ten minutes
25:19 - all right I have an idea let's just make
25:23 - a timer
25:24 - okay let's uh let's do a new sketch
25:29 - we're gonna call it January 2. did you
25:33 - all know that P5 has a Dom Library see
25:35 - this is my excuse for just doing
25:36 - something very basic which is that I'm
25:37 - going to teach you something
25:39 - um let's say no canvas
25:44 - let's go over here into style and say uh
25:48 - background
25:50 - color
25:53 - that should give me
25:55 - uh there we go
25:58 - um let's get rid of draw let's make a um
26:03 - timer
26:04 - which will be a oh I can I don't I'm
26:07 - just doing all this in setup so
26:11 - timer equals create p
26:14 - uh ten zero zero okay
26:18 - okay there we go then let's say timer
26:21 - uh also let's let's get rid of whoops
26:24 - one thing about Auto refresh is it will
26:26 - always I mean um
26:28 - Auto refresh will take you all the ways
26:31 - to sketch.js which I don't love let's
26:32 - get rid of margin and padding canvas is
26:35 - nothing we need to look at worry about
26:37 - okay
26:41 - uh timer
26:43 - uh uh Style
26:46 - font size you can apply CSS directly in
26:49 - P5
26:52 - through the um so I can create a HTML
26:55 - paragraph element I can apply CSS
26:58 - directly in P5 did you know that you
27:00 - could do this
27:01 - and now let's do a let timer equals so
27:08 - 10 minutes time see this is my loose
27:10 - interpretation of the idea 10 minutes
27:13 - times 60 Seconds
27:16 - because there's 60 seconds per minute
27:18 - and so then uh
27:22 - we're gonna say oh whoa whoa whoa whoa
27:26 - ah no no this is let timer paragraph
27:29 - timer
27:31 - paragraph style and the actual timer is
27:34 - going to start with this then I'm going
27:37 - to say set interval
27:40 - function
27:42 - timer minus minus
27:45 - timer P dot HTML timer
27:49 - and then a comma
27:53 - 1000 every second it will go down by one
27:56 - this is a terrible way of doing this but
27:58 - let's see what happens
28:02 - so this is going to count down 600
28:05 - seconds
28:06 - laughs
28:08 - I would like to change this to convert
28:11 - it to minutes and seconds I think we
28:13 - could do that I think we can manage that
28:15 - okay
28:17 - um
28:18 - so minutes
28:20 - equals timer divided by 60.
28:25 - floor
28:27 - and then seconds would equal timer
28:31 - modulo 60.
28:35 - and then I could say
28:39 - minute colon
28:42 - seconds and this is what's known as a
28:44 - string literal
28:49 - okay what did I get wrong here
28:51 - oh set no seconds
28:54 - and let's have it start like this
29:03 - no I have an error oh timer needs to be
29:06 - a string then oh no no oh I see it has
29:08 - to be
29:09 - oh I see but I can just do this
29:12 - okay
29:16 - great I mean the thing that I don't like
29:18 - here though is I want to number format
29:20 - this
29:23 - I'm taking up way too much time
29:25 - will this work
29:28 - I would like my auto Refresh on now
29:30 - please
29:35 - yep
29:39 - uh how do I set the font style font
29:43 - family
29:45 - Courier
29:48 - there we go
29:51 - this is not made in 10 minutes but this
29:54 - is a very quick timer in 10 minutes done
29:58 - I'm going for quantity not quality okay
30:01 - um
30:03 - okay so by the way uh if set interval is
30:07 - unfamiliar to you it is a way of saying
30:09 - execute a particular function which I've
30:11 - made an anonymous function in here every
30:13 - number of milliseconds that's a string
30:16 - literal which is a way of making a
30:17 - string of text out of
30:19 - [Music]
30:20 - um
30:21 - uh characters and values of variables
30:24 - number formats a great way to format
30:25 - numbers all right this is good okay
30:28 - moving on
30:30 - uh
30:32 - glitch art oh I like this glitch art
30:35 - this should be this shouldn't be too
30:37 - hard okay
30:38 - uh all right everybody let's uh
30:42 - glitch let's glitch a photo
30:50 - okay can I uh air drop this now this is
30:54 - a terrible photo of myself
30:57 - [Music]
30:57 - um
30:58 - all right this is silly
31:00 - Let's find let's let's uh let's get
31:03 - Gloria Gloria Gloria pickle
31:07 - no no
31:09 - I aspire
31:12 - to have really awesome SEO for Gloria
31:15 - pickle images okay I'm gonna have to
31:19 - I'm just gonna go over here while I dig
31:21 - up a picture of Gloria pickle
31:24 - um so just take a second I'm just gonna
31:26 - log into a different
31:27 - Google account
31:30 - for myself
31:32 - a search Gloria pickle
31:38 - and let's find a wonderfully cute
31:42 - picture of Gloria pickle I do like this
31:45 - one
31:47 - I think I could show this to you all
31:49 - it's just lots of beautiful pictures of
31:51 - Gloria pickle
31:53 - um but um I'm gonna pick one
31:56 - this one looks good
31:59 - uh download let's do this in processing
32:02 - okay everybody I feel like pixel stuff
32:04 - for me is a little bit easier in
32:06 - processing
32:07 - and this should be the picture that I
32:09 - downloaded oh going to processing Okay
32:12 - so
32:13 - what am I on January day three
32:17 - is this three okay
32:26 - oh no
32:32 - okay so uh downloads
32:37 - there we go
32:44 - whoops no no come on give me that give
32:47 - me a DOT there
32:48 - I cannot see
32:51 - okay uh also this is a huge file which
32:55 - is just going to cause US problems
32:57 - uh also let's let's crop it
33:07 - um 600 by 505 beautiful
33:11 - okay
33:12 - um
33:18 - size
33:21 - oh I think by the way I so I think in
33:24 - processing
33:25 - if I want to use
33:28 - a like the size of an image to be the
33:30 - size of the canvas I can use the
33:32 - settings functions and then I can say
33:34 - gloria.with
33:36 - gloria.height
33:38 - I don't think I need anything in setup
33:40 - but just let's draw image Gloria
33:43 - zero zero
33:47 - okay what happened what's wrong here
33:49 - people
33:51 - gloria.jpg
34:00 - the sketch path is not set
34:02 - oh interesting uh oh I'm so confused all
34:06 - right I'm gonna I'm gonna worry about
34:07 - this later
34:11 - and
34:15 - oh I never no I did load the image okay
34:19 - let's not get too fancy here
34:28 - what have I done
34:35 - January three
34:40 - I'm looking at the chat I'm looking at
34:42 - the chat
34:45 - uh oh Joseph these are good ideas
34:48 - I didn't see them until just now
34:52 - um
34:54 - what's going on here
34:57 - let's try this again
35:07 - I mean it really shouldn't matter but
35:10 - fine
35:11 - you want to be like that let's be like
35:14 - that
35:15 - yeah okay I'm not sure why I'm I I
35:19 - thought there was no issue in
35:21 - processing with loading an image outside
35:23 - of setup and draw but I guess I'm
35:25 - confused about that
35:27 - um but we're all good here
35:30 - um okay so this should do the trick
35:35 - okay here we go
35:38 - um all right so now we need to make some
35:40 - glitch art
35:43 - uh I want to glitch the image I have an
35:47 - idea
35:48 - let's just say
35:50 - um in draw
35:52 - I am going to pick a random X
36:01 - and a random y
36:09 - this is not going to be very exciting I
36:11 - can already tell this is not the
36:13 - greatest idea ever but let's try it I'm
36:15 - going to pick two random spots I'm going
36:18 - to get color one
36:19 - uh
36:22 - I'm gonna do the quick and dirty way of
36:25 - getting
36:27 - a pixel from an image
36:30 - and then I'm going to say
36:33 - uh Gloria dot set X X1 y1 C2
36:39 - Gloria dot set
36:42 - X
36:45 - 2 Y 2 C 1. and then image Gloria zero
36:52 - zero
36:53 - so I'm this should swap two pixels and
36:57 - now it's doing one pixel at a time
37:00 - however many times through draw
37:04 - [Laughter]
37:06 - let's just see uh if
37:09 - I do a hundred pixels at a time if this
37:12 - is actually happening I shouldn't have
37:14 - to do update pixels
37:16 - because
37:19 - oh yeah
37:22 - so it probably would make more sense for
37:24 - me to actually
37:26 - now this is just it has the appearance
37:28 - of adding noise to Gloria which I kind
37:31 - of like if I had more of a logic to how
37:34 - I was
37:36 - swapping the pixels that would be better
37:41 - um what if
37:43 - I were to always say something like this
37:50 - and Y2 equals y1 like with like if I
37:55 - swap them always like
38:00 - uh that's you know maybe slightly more
38:03 - interesting but not really
38:05 - I guess I should do like
38:07 - this is done though
38:09 - you can I'm sure this could get much
38:11 - better with more time we're already at
38:13 - like 20 minutes what prompt am I on I'm
38:15 - on prompt three so I'm not I gotta move
38:18 - on okay next one that's my glitch art
38:20 - quantity over quality
38:24 - intersections I'm excited about this one
38:27 - okay intersections
38:30 - um yeah I should not have just smeared
38:31 - the pixels that would have been better
38:32 - or like taking whole slices out using
38:34 - copy using copy would have been way
38:36 - better but I had this idea of just
38:37 - swapping pixels it wasn't a good idea
38:39 - but I'm moving on okay uh intersections
38:42 - oh this is going to be great oh I'm
38:44 - going to love this one okay let's go to
38:48 - uh examples and let's pick something
38:50 - from nature of code
38:52 - um just because
38:55 - um I said I I I like the idea of
38:58 - starting from scratch but
39:00 - um you know what there's something kind
39:01 - of nice about starting from scratch but
39:03 - I'm going to stick in processing
39:05 - um
39:07 - my good old my old friend
39:10 - bubble
39:12 - which has an X and A Y
39:14 - and an R
39:24 - okay
39:26 - is my bubble
39:28 - we're gonna uh can't call Float what's
39:31 - another word for float rise
39:35 - y equals y minus some random amount x
39:41 - equals X Plus
39:43 - some random amount
39:45 - uh
39:47 - R equals some random
39:51 - amount
39:53 - and then
39:56 - we're going to draw it as a you'll see
40:00 - we'll see what I'm doing here it's gonna
40:01 - be very exciting
40:03 - um
40:05 - uh
40:07 - uh Circle
40:09 - x y r times two
40:11 - a stroke 255.
40:13 - no fill for the moment okay
40:16 - um now oops uh so this is
40:21 - cancel oh January
40:24 - January
40:26 - what am I on for January 4 okay
40:30 - uh actually let's put this on another
40:33 - tab
40:35 - called Bubble
40:38 - and set up
40:43 - draw
41:22 - okay let's see if I did I do this right
41:24 - yeah all right awesome okay so now the
41:28 - bubbles they should really all start
41:30 - like uh below the screen
41:41 - like five times the radius below the
41:43 - screen let them go faster if they want a
41:46 - little more movement and then uh if
41:50 - if Y is less than not zero but like
41:54 - their size R then set y back to the
42:00 - bottom of the screen
42:02 - let's try making uh 50 of them
42:08 - okay here's all of our bubbles and
42:11 - floating up and now what I'm going to do
42:13 - is
42:15 - uh
42:18 - in draw I'm going to say
42:23 - for every bubble a
42:28 - and every bubble
42:30 - B
42:34 - as long as a is not equal to B
42:37 - uh the distance
42:39 - between a DOT X and a DOT Y and B dot X
42:42 - and B dot y if the distance is less than
42:46 - a DOT R plus b dot r that would be a way
42:48 - of checking if two circles are
42:50 - intersecting then let's draw a line from
42:53 - a DOT x a DOT y to B dot x b
42:56 - B dot y
42:58 - uh
43:00 - and the stroke weight will be that
43:04 - distance that might be really weird
43:06 - might be a terrible idea let's just make
43:08 - the stroke weight one right now
43:10 - and then let's no longer draw the
43:12 - bubbles
43:17 - okay what did I do wrong here
43:19 - stroke weight one
43:21 - stroke zero
43:24 - uh
43:31 - uh print line d
43:37 - we're getting distances everything's
43:39 - zero oh oh no wait
43:43 - the bubbles have an X and A Y
43:46 - are all the distances zero
43:50 - oh if a equals B
43:53 - if a does not equal V not equal I see it
43:56 - in the chat everybody thank you very
43:57 - much okay
44:02 - okay so now what am I oh is stroke 255
44:08 - well I shouldn't be making mistakes yet
44:10 - okay awesome
44:15 - now this would be more interesting if
44:17 - perhaps
44:19 - this is like a Casey Reese special here
44:21 - this would be more interesting if
44:24 - um
44:26 - there were some kind of more
44:28 - sophisticated logic perhaps to the
44:30 - motion of the bubbles where they
44:32 - actually interact with each other so I
44:34 - probably should have taken like my
44:35 - flocking example or something like that
44:37 - would be much more interesting
44:39 - so you should do that because I have to
44:41 - move on
44:43 - I'm just curious here to
44:47 - go for 200 bubbles
44:49 - and let it ride
44:53 - okay there we go
44:56 - intersection
44:58 - um
45:06 - I I I I I I I really need to stop what
45:10 - I'm doing right now
45:14 - I swear this is going to be it
45:19 - like this oh too much too much too much
45:21 - oh that's fine then I wanted to
45:24 - um why is the background Alpha not
45:26 - working uh I just wanted to see
45:28 - something stroke weight distance
45:33 - if this would actually be interesting
45:35 - okay everyone's telling me to be done
45:37 - not really
45:39 - okay
45:41 - wait I just understand why the alpha the
45:43 - best oh that doesn't work in uh
45:44 - processing
45:47 - uh
45:51 - just let me finish this off
46:00 - there we go
46:02 - but let's just make this back to two
46:04 - okay we're done
46:12 - I kind of like it actually it's kind of
46:15 - strange I'm good I I know I know I'm
46:17 - gonna move on let's go back to 50. uh
46:27 - okay
46:28 - we're done
46:31 - I'm on number five debug view okay
46:35 - we could make a debug view of this
46:37 - let's make a debug view of this okay so
46:40 - let me
46:41 - save as
46:43 - January 5.
46:46 - so
46:48 - um
46:50 - so okay so I'm gonna do
46:54 - oh this is interesting
46:59 - uh what should be a debug view of this
47:02 - hmm
47:04 - I mean I guess I want to see the circles
47:07 - okay
47:08 - so I know what to do
47:14 - watch this this is going to be kind of
47:16 - weird but
47:17 - um
47:24 - debug I'm just going to say
47:27 - um intersect
47:29 - intersect is false
47:36 - intersect is going to be false for all
47:38 - of them if they're intersecting
47:39 - something a DOT intersect is true
47:45 - and
47:47 - B dot intersect is false
47:52 - and then in Show
47:56 - um if a DOT intercept oh no if intersect
48:03 - fill
48:06 - like red
48:08 - but with some nice Alpha
48:10 - else fill
48:14 - green
48:15 - with some Alpha
48:20 - so this should look like this now
48:24 - and the debug view probably should have
48:27 - the regular background
48:34 - and let's
48:38 - say no stroke
48:40 - and let's make this even lighter
48:45 - so now
48:48 - that's the debug view so we can see
48:50 - which ones are intersecting and which
48:52 - ones aren't
48:54 - and if the lines are correct why is my
48:57 - rectangle still in there so the whole
48:59 - thing is like flickering like crazy
49:01 - oh whoops I left this in there no wonder
49:03 - okay hold on this will help
49:07 - all right I like this I like that as
49:10 - debug view okay we're done moving on
49:14 - what am I on steal like an artist oh
49:17 - right Chachi PT let's use Chachi be
49:19 - teeth I think
49:26 - well I'm gonna have to log in I don't
49:29 - shoot
49:30 - um yeah let's see
49:32 - oh somehow for some reason I've got my
49:34 - password saved in here for my chat gbt
49:37 - account all right that's fine I don't
49:39 - want my I definitely do not want my
49:40 - conversation history being shown right
49:42 - now no no no no okay good
49:45 - foreign
49:48 - I leave you to try to decipher what kind
49:51 - of life my my what my life is like that
49:53 - that's my
49:55 - GPT history okay
49:58 - um make me an artwork that is uh create
50:03 - actually what I should just be doing is
50:05 - going and stealing whatever oh I know
50:07 - what I should do uh Raphael do you have
50:10 - all of your January prompts somewhere
50:11 - can I just get your January 6th one that
50:14 - would be good
50:15 - create an artwork
50:17 - that is not original
50:20 - that I can copy for a P5 JS sketch that
50:25 - is very artistic
50:36 - yeah I know I can okay
50:37 - I'm feeling
50:40 - lazy would you mind
50:42 - just giving me the code thank you
50:50 - what okay yeah basic code template no I
50:54 - don't want a template
50:55 - oh please
50:58 - oh they're giving me more
51:00 - okay
51:03 - all right this is gonna be good
51:12 - okay all right yeah yeah that's what I'm
51:14 - gonna do I'm gonna build on my own okay
51:17 - what's this January six
51:22 - January
51:24 - six
51:28 - oh
51:29 - that does not look like starry night at
51:31 - all
51:33 - um let's make them swirl
51:47 - so let's make an array
51:49 - and
51:55 - um
51:57 - so let uh
52:00 - uh Stars let's just make it a vector
52:02 - push create vector
52:05 - X comma y
52:08 - then I'm going to say
52:12 - and then let's put this
52:16 - here
52:19 - uh then let's say four
52:23 - um
52:25 - for V of stars
52:29 - point
52:31 - V Dot X V Dot y
52:33 - stroke oh it should already Okay so
52:36 - let's see
52:37 - okay so those are the stars and now what
52:40 - I want to do is I want to say
52:44 - um
52:45 - uh
52:47 - uh okay how about this
52:50 - let's star
52:52 - of stars
52:56 - and then the vector is a P5 Vector
53:01 - subtract
53:04 - Center oh I should just do it this is so
53:08 - silly
53:09 - let's do Translate
53:13 - to the center
53:16 - we're going to make Starry Night people
53:17 - better than chat gbt ever could
53:21 - um
53:22 - uh minus
53:24 - width divided by 2
53:26 - minus height divided by two
53:29 - where do I have an error line 22
53:35 - so
53:36 - let a equal star dot heading
53:41 - a DOT rotate by pi divided by two
53:47 - um
53:50 - then
53:52 - um
53:53 - V equals
53:56 - Vector from angle a
54:00 - oh no no no okay
54:01 - no no no I'm going to rotate the oh I'm
54:04 - so confused
54:07 - yeah yeah yeah okay I got it I got it I
54:10 - got it star oh no I know
54:14 - this is very silly what I'm doing let V
54:17 - equals star dot copy there's so many
54:20 - other ways I could do this
54:21 - V Dot rotate pi divided by two
54:26 - that's what I want to do uh
54:28 - V Dot setmag to three
54:32 - or just a one let's just normalize it
54:36 - and then a star dot add V
54:43 - there we go
54:45 - Starry Night people
54:58 - okay starry night everybody moving on
55:03 - we're on Sample a color palette from
55:06 - your favorite okay hold on I gotta go
55:08 - look at the actual prompt there
55:12 - movie album cover all right I don't know
55:14 - what my favorite movie is
55:24 - uh
55:26 - um favorite movie how about 80 for Brady
55:30 - not seated do you know that there's a
55:32 - movie called 80 for Brady Brady for 80.
55:34 - I don't know it yeah sounds completely
55:36 - insane um let's do night of the coconut
55:40 - code not movie poster okay
55:44 - um night of the coconut
55:46 - because I am Patrick willem's number one
55:49 - fan
55:51 - um let's copy save this image
55:55 - Knight of the coconut let's go back and
55:58 - get our
56:01 - um
56:02 - oh this is actually kind of interesting
56:04 - the glitch of this actually became
56:07 - Cyclops Gloria this actually is working
56:09 - in a much more
56:11 - strange and wonderful way that I ever
56:14 - imagined it's quite horrifying but here
56:16 - we go
56:17 - uh okay yep well you're gonna have to
56:20 - sign up for nebula if you want to watch
56:21 - Night of the coconut
56:24 - nebula dot TV slash codingtree okay
56:29 - um
56:30 - so we are going to
56:34 - all right let's do this
56:37 - um we're gonna use this January 7th I'm
56:39 - gonna keep using this
56:41 - January 7 P image
56:44 - coconut
56:48 - coconut equals load image
56:53 - uh where is that image
56:56 - downloads
57:00 - light of the coconut
57:03 - um
57:08 - why I say NOC oh I'm like why does it
57:11 - say nature of code I name everything NOC
57:13 - for nature of code and I just named it
57:15 - NOC for Knight it's notc
57:19 - foreign
57:21 - really I'm just here pathetically uh um
57:25 - you know trying to uh put my name out
57:28 - there for a cameo in the sequel
57:31 - okay
57:33 - um
57:34 - notc dot jpeg
57:38 - um okay so now we've loaded that image
57:41 - it's missing or excess inaccessible
57:44 - oh who puts an e in their jpeg come on
57:49 - um
57:53 - um okay
57:54 - so uh int x equals floor random notc dot
58:00 - with this is a terrible way of doing
58:03 - this okay hold on a second let's look at
58:05 - the let's do something a little nicer
58:06 - the image is 1500 by 1500 okay that's a
58:09 - little bit nuts let's go and change it
58:11 - to
58:13 - um
58:14 - 800 by 800 perfectly reasonable size
58:16 - let's make our canvas
58:20 - 800 by 800 what was the prompt again I
58:23 - don't even remember
58:25 - sample a color palette okay and let's
58:32 - um
58:34 - oh yeah let's put this back in
58:36 - uh I'm not gonna worry about the
58:38 - intersecting bubbles anymore that was
58:40 - for another thing
58:42 - now
58:43 - we are just going to say uh
58:49 - color C equals notc did I call it notc
58:53 - here coconut that's not how you spell
58:55 - coconut notc
58:59 - uh notc.getxy
59:03 - fill
59:04 - C with some Alpha
59:09 - this is like me just recreating one of
59:12 - my sort of classic examples get int int
59:14 - for the Type image okay
59:17 - I'm going to convert it to an integer
59:25 - okay I like it I like it
59:28 - I like it a lot
59:30 - um let's make a
59:34 - 250 of these
59:40 - um
59:41 - let's do this
59:44 - start with background zero
59:47 - and let's make them much smaller
59:57 - and here we go
60:02 - everybody it is a night of the coconut
60:08 - okay we're done I'm moving on
60:12 - uh January 8th oh no sign distance
60:15 - functions I know sign distance functions
60:18 - do I have
60:21 - so I was learning these
60:26 - does this count because I think this is
60:28 - code that I wrote no it's code that I
60:31 - got for somebody else
60:33 - fascinating
60:35 - all right so wait let's let's make my
60:38 - own sign distance function
60:41 - assigned I really want to make a video
60:45 - about this sine distance function uh
60:48 - Circle rectangle no let's do Circle
60:50 - because this is a health we're going to
60:51 - do kind of hello world sign distance
60:53 - functions function which takes a
60:55 - position as an input and outputs the
60:57 - distance from that position to the
60:59 - nearest part of the shape
61:00 - okay
61:03 - um so many wonderful tutorials here uh
61:06 - okay so basically
61:10 - I would like to
61:13 - go let's make a new sketch
61:34 - we're gonna do a nested Loop
61:37 - to look at every single Pixel
61:52 - let's just make sure
61:55 - this is right
61:57 - and we're going to say
62:00 - um
62:02 - what is it called load pixels load
62:05 - pixels update pixels and I'm going to
62:09 - say no Loop just for right now let's run
62:11 - the sketch
62:12 - okay so this is giving me a random pixel
62:16 - a random grayscale value for every pixel
62:18 - and
62:20 - I would like to
62:26 - uh to save this January 8th is that what
62:29 - I'm on eight yeah sign distance function
62:30 - so now we need to write a function
62:32 - called SDF and it should receive
62:36 - an X
62:37 - and a y
62:40 - and it should return
62:42 - some kind of distance
62:45 - and then
62:49 - we're going to make
62:53 - a color out of it
62:55 - so in this case
62:57 - oh right one so um
63:01 - so let's imagine the distance is like
63:03 - kind of normalized between zero and one
63:04 - I don't know if that makes sense so now
63:06 - they're all white if I so I'm just hard
63:08 - coding a distance value I'm doing this
63:11 - in a terrible way let's let's actually
63:13 - return the distance
63:16 - and let's say
63:21 - and then color
63:23 - you know let's map the distance between
63:25 - zero and one to zero and two whatever
63:27 - the minimum and maximum is just to like
63:28 - set us up for Success later okay so this
63:32 - I believe is the idea of assigned
63:35 - distance function
63:36 - I receive any point and it's signed
63:39 - because I can actually return negative
63:41 - values for a distance which is something
63:43 - you wouldn't normally do because you
63:45 - can't have a negative distance but this
63:47 - is
63:47 - just talking about
63:51 - things in a abstract computer Graphics
63:54 - world
63:55 - so what would be the sign distance
63:58 - function oh no I don't want to for
64:03 - um like a circle
64:07 - I don't want sign distance field
64:08 - although that's probably the same thing
64:10 - so like
64:12 - 2DS distance to a given point would be
64:15 - right
64:16 - uh
64:18 - so the distance is the square root right
64:20 - so let's think about this
64:21 - so let's say I want stop stop stop no
64:25 - cancel cancel not now let's say I want
64:28 - to say the distance is the distance
64:31 - between
64:33 - x y and the center of the screen
64:38 - and
64:40 - um so I'm actually going to
64:42 - just now
64:45 - I don't need to map that
64:46 - so this I would get
64:48 - right so is this kind of like a
64:51 - scientist have I have I implemented this
64:54 - I want to do more with this but is this
64:57 - technically a sign distance function
64:58 - there's no negative
65:02 - um
65:03 - um I think I would do it as like a
65:05 - threshold uh like so for example
65:09 - I could say also say if distance is
65:11 - greater than 100 return one else
65:17 - returns zero
65:21 - um
65:23 - and that would get me
65:28 - something like this
65:31 - so I've written a function to draw a
65:33 - circle
65:34 - smooth step that would be uh not if
65:38 - there isn't the possibility of a
65:40 - negative but what do I do with the
65:41 - negative
65:51 - is that a sign distance function now
65:55 - Sable Rave says I'm done
65:59 - I need to really properly learn sign
66:01 - distance functions and do something more
66:03 - interesting with them I I did this over
66:04 - a course of a stream a while ago I think
66:06 - I should subtract yeah let's make it
66:08 - more interesting okay thank you
66:10 - um return well what do you mean like
66:12 - what do you mean by return subtract
66:17 - um
66:18 - distance minus well oh I see what you
66:21 - mean
66:22 - so and then ah okay
66:26 - so
66:27 - oh no okay okay come on yeah let's try
66:30 - this okay I see what you mean this would
66:32 - be
66:34 - what does this do yeah there we go
66:38 - this is a scientist's function yes now
66:41 - what if
66:46 - yeah oh how strange but why didn't it
66:53 - this I should see grayscale now
66:56 - shouldn't I
67:02 - this is some distance minus a hundred oh
67:04 - because I'm mapping between negative one
67:06 - and one so if I want to normalize that
67:08 - by like
67:10 - 200
67:12 - I see
67:14 - you know
67:19 - yeah I like this okay we're getting
67:20 - somewhere
67:22 - just map the negative to red and
67:25 - positive to Green Oh I like that okay
67:27 - map color equals
67:32 - um
67:49 - let's do this
67:56 - whoo okay I'm really using sign distance
67:58 - functions okay I'm done
68:00 - moving on Plants oh this is this is a
68:04 - good one
68:05 - um all right everybody plants
68:08 - should I just do a can I just now I sort
68:10 - of feel like what I'm doing here today
68:12 - is instead of starting from my coding
68:14 - challenges and changing them I'm just
68:16 - like okay I know how to make a fractal
68:18 - tree actually
68:20 - this is something that I really should
68:22 - do let me let me try I have been
68:26 - let's make a fractal tree let's do this
68:28 - and we're in processing right now
68:30 - let's make a fractal tree and we'll
68:32 - um
68:33 - what am I on number nine
68:36 - so this is going to be fun we're going
68:39 - to use a little Pearl and noise we're
68:40 - going to make a nice little plant we're
68:42 - going to use random seed it's going to
68:44 - be great
68:45 - it's going to be great
68:54 - uh
69:00 - and I'm going to say Translate
69:06 - and then I'm going to say branch
69:09 - and we have some length
69:12 - let's call it 100 Branch by the length
69:17 - and we have a function called branch
69:20 - which takes length
69:23 - and it draws a line
69:25 - from
69:27 - wherever it is
69:29 - to uh zero a negative length
69:33 - and uh the stroke weight
69:37 - is going to be 2.
69:39 - and we're going to take a look at this
69:42 - and stroke 255
69:46 - I think I'm faster in processing than P5
69:48 - which is kind of counter-intuitive but
69:51 - um
69:54 - we don't need a variable for that right
69:56 - now
69:56 - uh uh okay
69:58 - now
70:00 - there we go now we are going to say uh
70:04 - it um
70:08 - let's make it two-thirds of the length
70:10 - as long as length is greater than four
70:13 - pixels
70:16 - uh and then we need to translate to the
70:20 - end
70:22 - we need to rotate by an angle
70:28 - let's let's put this in here because I'm
70:30 - going to do something with this uh let's
70:32 - call it a pi divided by 4 just for right
70:34 - now we're going to rotate by that angle
70:36 - we're going to branch
70:39 - um
70:41 - by the length
70:43 - we're going to say push Matrix
70:46 - and pop Matrix
70:50 - and we're going to rotate by negative of
70:52 - the angle I'm going to do this in a
70:53 - different way maybe in a second and
70:55 - we're going to rotate by the branch
70:56 - again
70:59 - uh
71:00 - and do we have a fractal tree
71:03 - yes we have a rectal tree okay fractal
71:06 - tree are really bad
71:08 - um really fast
71:10 - really bad uh let's make it a little
71:13 - wider uh because nope okay okay fine
71:16 - fine fine
71:18 - so picky
71:20 - okay
71:21 - there we go so now what I would like to
71:23 - do is the following
71:24 - when we get to the end of the tree
71:27 - I always had this thing in my head about
71:30 - to draw the leaves at the end I need to
71:33 - create like a um
71:38 - a whole set of objects and keep track of
71:41 - where all the positions so I could place
71:42 - them there that's true if I want to
71:43 - animate them but if I just want to draw
71:45 - some leaves at the end
71:47 - that are green
71:49 - some Alpha
71:54 - uh
72:01 - uh this should do the trick
72:04 - see now I have some leaves on my tree I
72:06 - like that I would like them to like fly
72:08 - off but instead let's do the following
72:13 - let's say a random seed
72:18 - one and I want my random numbers to
72:20 - always be the same
72:22 - and uh I'm gonna do something weird
72:25 - which I'm not always going to Branch the
72:27 - tree if random one is less than 0.75
72:32 - uh uh branch
72:35 - to the right oh and this should this
72:39 - really needs a push in a pop also I mean
72:41 - it might I guess it doesn't need it
72:42 - technically but if random one is less
72:45 - than .75
72:48 - let's see if this does what I want it to
72:51 - do just to like yeah okay so I like this
72:54 - um because it's a little bit interesting
72:55 - and now
72:57 - we are going to say float a x offset
73:00 - equals zero
73:02 - and oh this needs to be always here x
73:06 - offset
73:08 - equals zero
73:10 - then
73:12 - um the angle is noise of X offset which
73:16 - goes to zero one which will go between 0
73:18 - and 2 well let's go between negative pi
73:21 - divided by 2 and pi divided by 2 and
73:24 - then X off plus equals 0.01
73:29 - why
73:31 - oh map noise of X offs okay sorry map
73:36 - noise of X offset to this range
73:41 - map noise of X offset which goes from
73:44 - zero and one to the okay so I only need
73:45 - one parenthesis there
73:48 - okay this is
73:51 - kind of strange
73:53 - but
73:55 - um let's let's okay okay how can I have
73:58 - many more
74:01 - um let's start with it shorter and let's
74:04 - not I'll let you all tweak this much
74:07 - more okay that kind of like that
74:11 - um
74:12 - let's do this two-thirds really makes
74:14 - more sense though
74:16 - um there I kind of like what I'm doing
74:17 - here okay so oh and now hold on I don't
74:21 - know what this is gonna do but X offset
74:25 - oh I should use 2D Berlin noise
74:29 - okay too fast too fast okay no no don't
74:31 - worry everybody don't worry X offset
74:35 - why offset
74:37 - and this is I should really do this with
74:45 - um I should really do this with like
74:46 - open Simplex noise I think it'll be much
74:48 - nicer okay
74:50 - there we go this is what I wanted yes
74:54 - [Music]
75:00 - okay moving on is the if repeated
75:03 - somebody's saying I do want to have
75:05 - these bees separate like and honestly
75:08 - like it should be much more rare that it
75:11 - doesn't branch
75:13 - and
75:15 - um
75:20 - I think this will actually be more fun
75:22 - if I go between pi and negative pi
75:29 - and if the stroke weight is also but I
75:32 - gotta stop I gotta stop there okay
75:33 - moving on
75:35 - I am by the way close to one-third
75:38 - generative music
75:40 - oh crud
75:42 - this is going to be tough for me
75:49 - all right how can I quickly make some
75:51 - generative music
75:53 - this I'm definitely gonna go to P5
75:55 - I'm gonna need an example
76:00 - uh
76:02 - uh generative music oh no what am I on
76:06 - January
76:07 - number 10.
76:09 - okay January General music um P5
76:12 - oscillator
76:15 - or envelope I want to let's use the P5
76:18 - envelope
76:19 - do I have hold on coding train oh no
76:23 - I'll never P5 uh envelope
76:27 - okay uh
76:31 - okay let's uh copy this
76:34 - so this is definitely not me starting
76:36 - from scratch but that's okay
76:38 - uh
76:42 - [Music]
76:47 - let's make it a sine wave which I think
76:49 - will be a little nicer
76:51 - okay now you're getting that sound right
76:54 - okay uh
76:57 - um okay okay let's see now I don't want
77:00 - to play the sound
77:02 - um
77:03 - with uh the mouse press
77:05 - I don't want a canvas I mean let's leave
77:08 - the canvas there just in case I want to
77:09 - do something with it and then play sound
77:12 - oscillator start envelope play where is
77:15 - the frequency set
77:19 - how do I change it if I wanted to play a
77:21 - different
77:24 - like where was
77:27 - where do I set the frequency
77:32 - hold on let's see
77:34 - um and let's see let's go to
77:38 - P5 oscillator
77:42 - oh note envelope this is an example
77:45 - by the way
77:47 - this would be helpful if I could just
77:50 - watch this video tutorial right here
77:53 - uh scale array okay that's interesting
77:56 - let's take a look at this
77:58 - set set range oscillator
78:03 - midi value midi to frequency oscillator
78:05 - frequency okay I like this so let's try
78:08 - to bring this in here
78:11 - that's a scale array which are midi
78:13 - notes
78:15 - and then
78:16 - uh scale array notes
78:20 - the note is what just like as okay zero
78:23 - okay
78:24 - so let's see midi to frequency
78:27 - I need that function oh that's a P5
78:29 - function midi to frequency that's nice
78:33 - um so I guess
78:37 - if I have this
78:40 - if what I do is I get a note
78:47 - um I try like did I get the notes yeah
78:49 - scale array scale array notes so let
78:52 - note equals zero
78:55 - and clay sound
79:00 - freak value wait what does it not know
79:05 - osc is not defined
79:07 - ah uh try osc so let's just call it I
79:12 - made it a sign oscillator so let's just
79:14 - call it osc
79:16 - open Sound control nope okay
79:26 - okay
79:29 - every time I play it okay so now
79:33 - um
79:34 - set interval
79:37 - play sound every uh second
79:42 - and then say note plus plus
79:44 - [Music]
79:57 - okay got it so now uh hey let's do a
80:03 - random walk we'll do a random walk note
80:06 - equals uh zero and we're going to say
80:10 - um uh let r e okay we're going to say if
80:14 - random is less if random is less than
80:18 - 0.5
80:19 - I mean we could certainly do a more
80:21 - exciting algorithm here but I don't got
80:23 - all day
80:25 - uh
80:27 - no plus plus
80:29 - else no minus minus
80:33 - let's get this right and then uh note
80:36 - equals constrain
80:39 - note between 0 and uh what is it
80:44 - scalearray.length
80:50 - so this should work and
80:53 - let's just give it a little bit more
80:54 - time
80:56 - [Music]
81:08 - let's have it here and
81:12 - let's have it go faster
81:20 - foreign
81:26 - music everybody moving on
81:31 - okay
81:33 - that was ten okay okay
81:36 - um
81:37 - no no gorilla sun is telling me to take
81:40 - my time I am not gonna take my time it
81:43 - is 2 30 in the afternoon I need to be
81:46 - done I need to be out here by like four
81:48 - o'clock
81:48 - uh number 11 suprematism I'm gonna have
81:52 - to look at what this prompt is
81:57 - supremacism early 20th century art
82:00 - movement focused on the fundamentals of
82:02 - geometry painted in a limited range of
82:04 - colors okay
82:07 - um what is that limited range
82:13 - um
82:14 - should I ask chat GPT to help me
82:17 - um
82:19 - no I don't want to regenerate a response
82:21 - um
82:22 - can can you provide
82:26 - me a list of RGB values for soup
82:31 - for me to make a Sue prematis I really
82:35 - don't like the idea of typing
82:36 - suprematist here because to me it has
82:39 - other connotations but I understand that
82:41 - it's something else
82:43 - but let's see what happens
82:52 - okay
82:55 - wow this is really basic
82:57 - I could have done this myself
83:01 - uh Dave is giving me a palette so we're
83:04 - gonna go with Dave thank you is was that
83:07 - on the prompt
83:09 - uh we're gonna go with Dave's palette
83:11 - although I don't have the chat up so I'm
83:12 - gonna have to retype it
83:15 - um okay let's let's go back to P5 for
83:18 - this one
83:20 - uh new January
83:25 - 11. so we're going to get a palette
83:33 - and let's go for all right here we go
83:36 - I've got this chat nobody type any chat
83:38 - message zero a080a
83:42 - I'm so glad that Dave is here
83:46 - um zero eight zero a0a
83:49 - um
83:50 - uh F 7 F 3 F2 if you're wondering why
83:54 - I'm looking over there that's where I
83:55 - see the chat
83:58 - um
84:00 - zero zero seven seven e one
84:06 - um
84:08 - f
84:09 - five D two one six
84:12 - okay
84:14 - uh F3
84:17 - fc3503 okay thank you
84:22 - um I really want
84:23 - nah it's fine okay so now
84:26 - we are going to
84:28 - limit myself to
84:30 - okay
84:32 - let's make it just with one rectangle
84:36 - one Circle ellipses always look funny to
84:39 - me and a lie
84:41 - so we're going to
84:44 - uh let color One Is Random from the
84:49 - palette
84:50 - but color two is a random from the
84:53 - palette
84:54 - you know what let's let's not do that I
84:56 - feel like we should be very prescriptive
84:58 - for this
85:00 - C of palette
85:03 - and if oh hold on
85:07 - I got it now four let I equal zero I is
85:11 - less than palette dot length I plus plus
85:16 - uh if I um
85:18 - uh if I modulo 3 is 0
85:24 - then let's draw a rectangle
85:29 - at
85:30 - [Music]
85:31 - um
85:31 - I
85:34 - uh all right let's we'll make this
85:36 - random
85:46 - and we're gonna say fill palette
85:50 - I
85:52 - uh no stroke
85:55 - and we'll start with a
85:58 - background
85:59 - palette
86:01 - zero
86:05 - and we're going to go from one
86:08 - else if I
86:13 - modular two is this what I'm doing is it
86:16 - well this doesn't make any sense
86:19 - um
86:25 - every third
86:30 - yeah
86:32 - um
86:35 - wait I'm like losing my mind here wait
86:37 - hold on let me pull the chat back up
86:39 - because it lost
86:41 - I put an S instead of a d on the fourth
86:44 - color
86:47 - thank you
86:50 - okay so now what I want to do is what
86:53 - I'm saying is when it's one I want it to
86:55 - be a let's say when it's zero rectangle
86:59 - one Circle
87:01 - three line four
87:05 - rectangle so if
87:10 - why am I why is my brain
87:13 - not working here
87:15 - this was projected on the oh look uh big
87:18 - Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was
87:23 - suggested earlier sorry I'm not doing a
87:24 - good job of keeping an eye on the
87:25 - Discord chat that's also going on
87:27 - simultaneously
87:29 - um all right I need to take a breath
87:31 - here for a second I've been go go go go
87:33 - going
87:38 - I think I could pick one of three random
87:41 - shapes is fine
87:43 - so let's just do it that way if random
87:47 - one
87:56 - if R is less than 0.33
88:00 - do a rectangle
88:05 - else if R is less than 0.67
88:09 - do a circle
88:18 - and
88:21 - otherwise
88:24 - let's go look let's look at the
88:25 - Wikipedia page again
88:29 - I lost that page oh suprematism here it
88:31 - is
88:33 - um
88:38 - Circle oh I like the guy oh is it just
88:41 - one thing oh no suprematism oh I like
88:45 - this oh I can rotate oh I like this okay
88:48 - let's be a little bit more let's let's
88:50 - be a little more okay
88:52 - so else
88:54 - um
88:55 - stroke Okay so
88:58 - no fill
89:01 - stroke
89:03 - weight four
89:06 - uh line
89:09 - um
89:11 - I think let's just do vertical or
89:13 - horizontal lines which would actually be
89:14 - just like a rectangle but
89:16 - um
89:18 - I'm kind of let's do Translate
89:27 - uh if random one is less than 0.5 rotate
89:33 - by pi divided by 2. it's really doing
89:35 - this weird uh and then the length is a
89:40 - random value between uh 10 and width
89:44 - divided by 2. so let's write a line that
89:47 - is from negative length 0 to positive
89:52 - length zero and
89:55 - it shouldn't matter but I'm just going
89:57 - to put push and pop around this just in
89:59 - case
90:00 - and let's run this
90:07 - okay where's my line people no fill a
90:10 - stroke
90:11 - C right
90:13 - what was it called palette I
90:19 - um
90:20 - let's do uh let's do 50 and then pilot I
90:25 - Mel um I
90:28 - modulo palette length I don't know why
90:32 - I'm choosing to do this in order and
90:33 - other things random
90:37 - um
90:39 - what's wrong now
90:47 - why does that not work I
90:54 - palette dot length I
90:58 - oh what no
91:01 - it doesn't matter
91:02 - oh there there there I see I see oh I've
91:06 - done this in such a silly way
91:09 - um okay yay okay now uh everything is
91:13 - way too big
91:24 - and
91:25 - um
91:27 - I think we should also allow for
91:32 - rotate
91:38 - not trans let's rotate by I'm just
91:40 - curious here so I do this okay there we
91:44 - go I kind of like what I did
91:47 - suprematism everybody
91:52 - oh I need the 45 degree rotation should
91:54 - I make it
92:03 - suprematism I kind of like this not so
92:06 - bad it's actually quite a bit better
92:08 - than I expected depalm I totally agree
92:10 - All Right Moving On
92:13 - oh wait what happened oh because I went
92:15 - into the chat okay
92:17 - all right tessellation
92:20 - tessellation this I should be able to do
92:23 - no problem
92:26 - so I get my wave function collapse
92:28 - example out
92:33 - um
92:36 - okay
92:38 - tessellation what do I want to do here
92:41 - what do I want to attempt
92:51 - let's see what is the let's see what the
92:53 - prompt says it has any nice
92:55 - details oh should we try one of these
92:58 - more specific ones oh oh I've see I've
93:00 - done a lot of this maybe I should go get
93:02 - my
93:04 - um
93:08 - I've always wanted to do try hexanal try
93:11 - hexagonal tiling that looks like kind of
93:13 - fun
93:14 - uh this one is wild same kind okay I got
93:17 - to do something simple
93:19 - uh like this
93:24 - this looks fun
93:27 - should we try to make this how hard
93:29 - could that be
93:31 - let's try to make this okay hexagons are
93:35 - fun all right let's do this in
93:36 - processing
93:38 - um
93:39 - yeah so
93:42 - it's just January what number am I on
93:44 - now
93:46 - I'm getting tired I'm only on 12. okay
93:50 - uh okay
93:51 - uh
93:55 - so I need a function to draw a hexagon
93:57 - that shouldn't be too hard right there's
93:59 - a lot of stuff here
94:02 - um let's write a function
94:04 - hexagon
94:06 - uh which gets a what an X and A Y
94:10 - and a um
94:12 - let's give it like an R for size
94:16 - so we are going to say push
94:19 - Matrix
94:21 - pop Matrix I think I'm going to need to
94:23 - turn the heat on people
94:25 - which I know creates a little bit of a
94:27 - noise in the background I'm going to
94:28 - just go ahead and do that
94:31 - because I'm getting very cold my hands
94:33 - can't type right now
94:42 - so you're going to hear a worrying of a
94:44 - fan momentarily
94:50 - uh hexagon
94:52 - has six sides
94:57 - and we want to say
95:00 - create shape
95:04 - is that it well begin shape
95:10 - end shape
95:15 - uh and then I want to say x equals R
95:20 - times
95:22 - okay uh let's say angle
95:25 - angle is map I between 0 and 6 to 0 and
95:29 - to Pi
95:32 - X is R times cosine of the angle
95:36 - Y is R times sine of the angle
95:41 - set a vertex
95:43 - at x y
95:46 - um
95:51 - that should be
95:53 - it right
95:55 - oh we've got a bit of oh okay no okay
95:57 - Translate
95:59 - to the X Y
96:01 - 'all it's fine uh
96:04 - I don't know it's complaining at me here
96:06 - so let's just do this
96:11 - I hate underscores as variable names but
96:13 - I'm just doing it now okay so what
96:15 - happens if I were to draw
96:19 - um let's say fill 255.
96:22 - hexagon
96:24 - [Music]
96:25 - um
96:26 - 200 200 100.
96:31 - okay oops
96:33 - too many pop matrixes matrices
96:39 - okay that looks like a hexagon
96:41 - there's a polygon function
96:45 - well I'm doing it myself they'll be like
96:47 - all sorts of wonderful possibilities
96:48 - here I should actually make my own
96:50 - polygon function
96:52 - polygon
96:54 - uh int n
96:56 - uh six
96:58 - polygon
97:01 - there
97:02 - take that
97:10 - polygon
97:13 - take that designers are processing
97:17 - that's a ninagon okay so now what do I
97:21 - need to do I need to where's that tile
97:23 - holders this tiling
97:26 - um so interesting so it looks like
97:28 - whatever my R is
97:31 - okay I think I understand what this is
97:33 - but I think I'm just going to kind of
97:35 - trial and error it
97:38 - so I'm going to say four
97:41 - and uh let's use a float X
97:45 - so let's have r equal 50. x equals let's
97:49 - try from negative r
97:51 - to X is less than width plus r x plus
97:55 - equal R looks like it was times two I'm
97:57 - just making this up
98:00 - I probably could read what the actual
98:02 - tiling is and then y
98:06 - probably needs to start like
98:09 - I think every other one is going to be
98:11 - slightly offset but that's fine r y is
98:15 - less than a height plus r and then y
98:18 - plus equal and then let's draw a polygon
98:25 - that is six-sided at X comma y with r
98:32 - okay we're getting somewhere
98:36 - so
98:38 - interesting
98:42 - interesting okay I really I need this
98:48 - four
98:50 - so if I'm starting here what I want to
98:52 - see is the first one
98:55 - um
98:58 - okay
99:06 - I think this is kind of like what I want
99:07 - to do
99:09 - whoa
99:12 - um I would like to see a stroke because
99:15 - it'll help me understand
99:17 - what's going on here
99:27 - okay so now I know that like the next
99:31 - one needs to be offset so I really
99:34 - should do this by columns and rows but
99:36 - I'll just do a counter
99:39 - so if
99:42 - counter
99:46 - oh I I also think I need to do the Y on
99:50 - the outside
99:51 - and it might not actually matter but
99:53 - that's going to help me understand
99:55 - so
99:57 - if counter mod
100:00 - 2 is zero
100:02 - then let's offset
100:04 - the row by r
100:08 - and this is this very silly way of doing
100:10 - this but
100:15 - uh let's do this
100:17 - okay
100:21 - oh and now every every time then counter
100:26 - goes up
100:31 - okay so I think this is by the way this
100:34 - is a nice tessellation and yes if I want
100:36 - to see the close of the stroke
100:39 - I should do this
100:42 - um
100:44 - I kind of like my tessellation anyway
100:48 - so haha uh
100:56 - I feel like I've made a nice
100:58 - tessellation even though it's not
100:59 - exactly yeah good enough I agree
101:01 - tessellation everybody
101:03 - moving on
101:06 - something you've always wanted to learn
101:08 - a sign distance functions
101:11 - maybe I should go learn sign distance
101:13 - functions a little bit more what's
101:14 - another thing oh 3js
101:22 - let's try 3js Okay uh hello world3.js
101:32 - uh all right chat GPT should be able to
101:34 - help me out here can you uh give me a
101:39 - blank boilerplate
101:42 - uh 3.js JavaScript example
101:52 - okay excellent excellent
101:54 - okay okay
102:00 - this looks pretty good
102:02 - all right all right
102:05 - so where am I going to put this code oh
102:07 - I guess I'm getting Visual Studio code
102:09 - up
102:11 - uh
102:13 - uh all right code
102:15 - yes
102:17 - where's Visual Studio code
102:23 - did I lose it applications
102:33 - I don't understand Visual Studio code
102:35 - here it is okay
102:37 - um
102:46 - uh I have no idea wait what I didn't
102:49 - even open how could there be changes
102:51 - already okay fine don't save
102:54 - uh
102:58 - save as
103:04 - a new file I forgot how to use a text
103:06 - editor Okay no Okay ah all right fine
103:10 - fine
103:12 - foreign
103:18 - 11 make a directory uh January
103:24 - uh uh 13. why did I say 11 when it's
103:27 - clearly 13.
103:29 - uh
103:36 - uh
103:42 - okay
103:49 - got my HTML file
103:52 - uh
103:54 - uh
103:57 - run a web server
104:00 - okay uh that's good
104:03 - um now let's go back
104:05 - so I get like a boilerplate
104:10 - okay
104:11 - uh
104:13 - oh that's okay
104:16 - uh
104:18 - index.j let's save this as uh
104:22 - index.js
104:26 - um
104:29 - uh
104:33 - uh may I have the HTML file to go along
104:37 - with this please
104:41 - okay so let's take a look oh whoops
104:45 - hey where'd it go
104:48 - copy code
104:52 - okay
104:53 - scene perspective render Cube oh I've
104:58 - got a cube here okay so I'll I'll try to
105:01 - do something a bit more
105:03 - with uh geometry box mesh material Cube
105:08 - okay maybe I'll make an array of cubes
105:10 - and spin them around
105:14 - um
105:21 - very slow this is good I get to take a
105:23 - little this is the only time I get to
105:24 - take a little break I'm halfway through
105:26 - at an hour and 25 minutes I think not
105:28 - halfway through but close to halfway
105:29 - through hour 25 minutes it's pretty good
105:31 - I'm almost done with my coffee
105:36 - foreign
105:41 - I could turn on
105:44 - um noise reduction but
105:46 - I feel like sometimes that um okay uh
105:50 - great
105:51 - is that the most recent 3js version that
105:54 - can't be right
105:57 - but it's fine
105:59 - um okay so now
106:04 - oh I see uh I do not want
106:11 - yeah so why isn't this
106:13 - doing anything
106:16 - here we go okay
106:19 - all right so I've got
106:21 - uh so I have got we're definitely not
106:25 - getting sub two hours I love that I have
106:27 - got something going in 3js so let's play
106:31 - around and make something myself so I'm
106:34 - going to try
106:37 - now let's just make a bunch of these
106:40 - uh
106:45 - uh one one one is just putting it in the
106:48 - scent oh Cube rotation
106:53 - hmm
106:54 - all right let's just try this
106:57 - um
106:59 - let's try making 10 of them
107:04 - and
107:13 - um scene add cubes cubes
107:16 - push Q Where do I do I give it a
107:20 - Translate
107:23 - um
107:24 - can I give everyone a
107:27 - uh
107:28 - uh Cube dot x equals random negative
107:32 - let's just try this
107:33 - I'm gonna add an X and A Y
107:37 - and what aren't I in 3D
107:40 - Okay so
107:42 - this and then
107:44 - if I say Cube
107:50 - all right hold on
107:52 - I don't know like Cube I'm just making
107:55 - up stuff Translate
108:01 - the variables don't need to be there I
108:03 - just was curious
108:05 - uh
108:07 - oh random is not defined okay that's
108:09 - fine no problem
108:14 - um
108:20 - let's try this
108:28 - translate has been removed translate on
108:30 - axis
108:32 - huh
108:34 - okay
108:39 - well what's the axis
108:41 - translate okay
108:43 - set a position of object in 3.js
108:49 - position
108:50 - oh I just give it a position
108:53 - a vector 3 default is zero zero zero how
108:56 - do I make a vector three
108:58 - okay ah okay
109:00 - distance two okay
109:06 - uh
109:20 - that one
109:24 - and then
109:27 - okay
109:29 - position
109:32 - so do I just say Cube position equals
109:40 - a new Vector three
109:46 - oh okay
109:49 - kind of sort of
109:56 - didn't seem to work oh there is a
109:58 - position here
110:00 - oh wait okay position.o
110:04 - no that's the camera
110:06 - uh okay so hold on
110:13 - uh four let cube of Cubes
110:22 - uh
110:27 - link them different sizes
110:34 - I think they're all on top of each other
110:36 - still
110:38 - how do I move them
110:42 - does anybody know
110:46 - position range is too small oh I just
110:48 - assumed everything's mapped between one
110:50 - to one
110:55 - how can I multiply the position how do I
110:58 - multiply a vector
111:02 - um
111:02 - well I'll just do it myself manually
111:14 - I don't know what the range of positions
111:16 - is
111:26 - okay
111:29 - I like this
111:46 - okay
111:55 - I'm pretty sure everything's kind of
111:57 - mapped and yeah all right I like this
111:59 - this is good
112:02 - okay
112:04 - um
112:15 - okay uh
112:25 - um
112:50 - okay a bunch of rotated cubes
112:55 - ah
112:59 - color
113:01 - I I would love to like change the way it
113:03 - looks but
113:05 - all right all right I learned 3js
113:07 - everybody moving on
113:10 - I didn't really learn 3js but maybe I'll
113:13 - add a sine wave into this in a bit
113:16 - moving on okay uh 14th
113:21 - acemic all right I'm gonna have to look
113:23 - at what this is
113:25 - 14
113:30 - is left to the right almost the way ah
113:33 - unreadable oh
113:37 - this is really interesting
113:40 - oh this is perfect for my
113:43 - um
113:45 - oh like handwriting
113:47 - oh this is
113:49 - awesome
113:51 - okay I got an idea
113:53 - okay
113:55 - um let's go to I have an exit coding
113:58 - challenge that I think will give me the
114:01 - beginning of what I want to do
114:07 - um I would like to get to the coding
114:08 - train page here it is
114:11 - uh not evolutionary all right fine
114:14 - everybody new coding Train website I
114:17 - don't need Google anymore uh
114:19 - steering behaviors
114:23 - this one is what I'm looking for
114:26 - uh okay
114:28 - so let's get rid of the okay so let's
114:31 - duplicate this
114:34 - uh January what am I on 14.
114:43 - let's get rid of the vehicles
114:46 - uh uh let's put this here let's get the
114:49 - points
114:51 - uh let's get rid of that
114:54 - uh let's get rid of that this
114:57 - okay
114:59 - so let's just see here okay what do I
115:01 - got train okay
115:03 - now
115:06 - um
115:08 - oh hi Henry
115:10 - exactly programming from A to Z although
115:12 - now I'm interpreting this as like the
115:14 - handwriting not the actual text itself
115:17 - so what I'd like to do is just say
115:20 - circle like just to see what I've got
115:22 - here Point dot y uh four
115:28 - um and then fill uh 255 no stroke
115:33 - okay and let's get rid of this
115:37 - there we go okay
115:39 - so now to make this
115:43 - unreadable
115:46 - and again shape and shape
115:50 - oh no
115:52 - um
115:55 - vertex
115:58 - uh
116:04 - okay
116:05 - stroke 255.
116:10 - and no fill
116:14 - interesting okay
116:17 - we're getting somewhere
116:18 - now let's use
116:23 - um and it would be really nice to
116:25 - animate this
116:26 - so let's
116:30 - put this in draw
116:38 - what do I got going on oh wait going
116:40 - back and forth between these two
116:42 - environments is definitely going to be a
116:44 - little tricky what did I miss
116:46 - great canvas background
116:53 - those are all extra curly bracket okay
116:56 - um okay so now what I'd like to do is
117:05 - um
117:11 - okay
117:13 - um we're going to for each point
117:15 - we're going to say x offset equals map
117:18 - Point dot x 0 to width to between 0 and
117:22 - 1.
117:23 - and the Y offset is going to be the same
117:29 - zero to height
117:31 - then Z offset is zero which we'll leave
117:36 - right now then I'm going to make an
117:38 - angle
117:40 - which is
117:45 - um noise X offset y offset Z offset
117:49 - times two pi
117:54 - then I want to make a vector
117:57 - from angle
117:59 - a
118:02 - and V Dot uh set magnitude we're just
118:06 - going to make it like 10 pixels right
118:08 - now and then this is going to be plus V
118:10 - Dot X
118:12 - Plus
118:13 - V Dot y I'm just curious what this is
118:15 - going to do
118:16 - okay and now let's try Z offset
118:20 - so these move wiggle around
118:24 - okay
118:26 - um what what error am I getting here P5
118:29 - reserved function reserved function with
118:33 - where did I use that
118:39 - where am I using like some weird word
118:43 - that I'm not supposed to be using but
118:44 - anyway
118:45 - um let's make this
118:47 - 50.
118:50 - and let's put
118:52 - um background zero here I like how it's
118:55 - smearing but okay
118:58 - this is pretty wild
119:01 - it's not real words okay uh so let's
119:07 - um
119:09 - so let's create I know uh uh
119:16 - well we could be more interesting about
119:18 - how we're picking the text
119:20 - um
119:23 - how did it get why do I have this weird
119:25 - font and
119:27 - size uh 12.
119:31 - why
119:33 - where is it getting oh it's getting it
119:36 - here
119:38 - um
119:40 - I didn't see that there were like
119:42 - arguments here
119:44 - sample Factor okay see ah I gotcha
119:48 - um
119:50 - okay so let's just do this
119:53 - let uh text
120:05 - um
120:19 - okay
120:24 - uh
120:28 - uh
120:34 - let's make some random text
120:46 - okay
120:47 - [Music]
120:48 - um zero
120:51 - zero is going to put it up there
120:55 - why is it yelling at me I want somebody
120:57 - to tell me why it's yelling at me what's
120:59 - going on
121:01 - um
121:06 - uh then what I'm going to do
121:09 - is if random 1 is less than uh
121:14 - every about every
121:17 - so many characters uh
121:23 - let's give it a line break
121:29 - and then
121:31 - let's use
121:33 - the text here
121:35 - why is it not giving me a line break
121:39 - I don't really care I guess
121:42 - uh
121:50 - uh 150
121:53 - okay there we go
122:02 - enjoy my very strange
122:05 - text
122:07 - all right
122:09 - uh this is January 14. moving on
122:14 - sine waves oh look at this let's add a
122:17 - sine wave oh this is beautiful
122:20 - um okay
122:21 - uh so this is January 15. we're gonna
122:25 - make this in a sign into a sine wave
122:28 - um so the angle is actually the mapping
122:33 - hmm
122:34 - okay how do I want to do this I want
122:36 - each letter essentially each point
122:41 - two okay I got it I got it I got it zero
122:44 - to width zero to two pi
122:49 - and this will just be the angle
122:52 - and then uh whoa
122:56 - um
122:57 - now what I want to do is
123:02 - sine of the angle times 50.
123:06 - okay so the text is in a sine wave
123:10 - but
123:12 - um
123:13 - plus Z off
123:17 - uh
123:21 - and maybe
123:24 - the I don't know why this isn't working
123:26 - I can figure that out later
123:31 - and let's change the text now to
123:42 - line wave
123:50 - all right
123:54 - oh wait I see it's this here that that
123:57 - doesn't actually matter up there
124:09 - okay there we go sine wave everybody
124:14 - reflection of a reflection ah we're
124:18 - gonna keep going with this one oh no did
124:20 - I forget to save as no I
124:23 - 15 was sine waves did I do a duplicate I
124:27 - hope I did I don't remember but now I'm
124:29 - doing a duplicate again
124:34 - um
124:36 - so now we're going to do a reflection
124:40 - so oops
124:44 - so let's
124:47 - reflect this
124:51 - by saying height minus
124:57 - foreign
125:04 - it's kind of a reflection but now I want
125:08 - to do a reflection of a reflection
125:10 - so we're going to start with it uh and I
125:14 - have so little room for my code
125:17 - um
125:19 - okay so now we're going to
125:22 - uh
125:23 - uh let's make it a little bit higher
125:26 - oh whoa that's what I meant
125:30 - hold on but uh this this is what I want
125:35 - um I now I want this
125:39 - and then
125:40 - uh what we're gonna do is we're gonna
125:43 - say
125:44 - four
125:45 - let I equals zero I is less than two I
125:48 - plus plus
125:50 - do this twice
125:56 - still why is it still complaining to me
126:01 - about
126:03 - this
126:05 - this is driving me crazy I is being
126:07 - redeclared yeah I don't I know okay
126:10 - that's fine
126:13 - okay okay why do I still have weird
126:16 - errors make sure you have used a P5
126:19 - reserve two pi
126:21 - yeah I know but I I'm using it I'm not
126:24 - declaring it
126:26 - maybe it's because of this the VAR what
126:29 - is going on okay I'm just gonna have to
126:32 - ignore that by the way this is getting
126:34 - really slow
126:36 - so let's make the sample distance one
126:40 - why is it running so slow all of a
126:42 - sudden
126:49 - is it my computer
126:51 - okay
126:54 - this is going
127:01 - this is going
127:10 - okay
127:13 - okay thank you Depot spending I messed
127:16 - up not saving 14 so we'll have to get
127:18 - back to that
127:20 - um okay take your time I cannot take my
127:24 - time
127:25 - um okay why is this suddenly
127:28 - going so slow
127:38 - I I'm not using a particularly powerful
127:40 - machine here I've got lots of extra text
127:44 - that I don't need
127:46 - okay there we go we're back I've got to
127:49 - figure out what this is it's making me
127:51 - crazy you have used a p5.js reserve
127:54 - variable two five
127:56 - two Pi I know
127:58 - I know
128:00 - I used it on purpose
128:07 - look at that message went away
128:11 - that message came back
128:21 - with
128:23 - what is going on
128:25 - you cannot go on until I figure this out
128:29 - why is it complaining about how I'm
128:31 - using these variables
128:44 - oh oh the nested Lube thank you
128:50 - that is a disaster
128:53 - that must be that must have messed
128:55 - things up but is that really going to
128:57 - mess this up
128:59 - foreign
129:05 - okay I'm gonna have to just let this go
129:09 - and come back to another time and just
129:11 - be fine with those error messages okay
129:14 - sine wave sine wave
129:19 - okay good okay now
129:21 - let's come back to this
129:26 - okay now let's do this twice
129:32 - and then let's say translate
129:36 - n times
129:39 - height divided by two
129:44 - it's commas oh zero
129:49 - okay but now what I want to do is
129:53 - actually reap so and then I need to say
129:56 - scale
129:59 - 1 negative one
130:03 - oh no uh uh sorry uh
130:07 - if n equals one let's just do this for a
130:11 - second okay
130:17 - how can I get the other one
130:23 - below it and reversed
130:34 - I'm feeling okay so
130:38 - I'm translating to there and then oh I
130:41 - see
130:42 - so I really need to translate to the
130:46 - center
130:47 - uh oh no the center should be
130:51 - this and then
130:55 - because oh I see
130:58 - point Y is not I I got it I got it I got
131:00 - it this actually needs to be zero
131:06 - and then what I'm doing here is
131:11 - translating to
131:14 - uh
131:19 - oh I like
131:21 - you know what this looks pretty good
131:24 - I think we got reflection of a
131:26 - reflection
131:29 - there's so much I could do visually to
131:30 - make this more interesting uh
131:37 - it's also just so darn slow
131:41 - um
131:43 - uh and then this one is
131:54 - [Music]
131:56 - I really should stop this
131:58 - I know what I'm doing now
132:00 - uh translate 100 plus this
132:04 - there we go and then
132:14 - what did that do
132:25 - now it's going to take it off
132:29 - translating and then I should scale it
132:31 - should flip it
132:33 - but it looks
132:35 - they look identical
132:55 - foreign
132:58 - yeah weird it is working but I don't
133:01 - know why I guess if I flip I don't
133:03 - actually want to flip it
133:06 - it's a way that's a reflection of a
133:09 - reflection okay I'm on a four hour Pace
133:11 - okay reflection of reflection we're good
133:13 - this was number 16. a grid inside of a
133:17 - grid inside of a grid oh this one makes
133:18 - me so happy
133:20 - okay I mean I could just do like a quad
133:21 - tree but somebody has got
133:25 - if somebody could figure out what the
133:27 - hey ho is going on with the error
133:29 - messages in the sketch I would be
133:30 - forever grateful but I'm sorry that
133:32 - you're gonna have to like type in this
133:34 - horrible URL
133:37 - there okay
133:39 - um let's go back to processing
133:41 - okay I know what to do here this one I'm
133:43 - really excited about
133:45 - uh okay
133:52 - by the way it's gotten quite warm in
133:53 - here now so let me go adjust the Heat
133:57 - okay
134:07 - uh
134:08 - uh
134:11 - um okay size 800 by 800. background
134:15 - let's just do this in draw background uh
134:18 - zero and let's also say uh the width is
134:23 - going to be 80.
134:32 - so let's first just draw a grid
134:43 - I have an idea let's do this recursively
134:47 - oh my God this is a little crazy
134:49 - this is such a bad idea
134:51 - uh
134:53 - we're gonna do float X float y float
134:58 - uh W float H and then float R for size
135:02 - okay so it's going to always assume
135:06 - it is a
135:10 - it's going to always assume it's a
135:13 - rectangle
135:14 - so I equals zero
135:17 - uh J equals zero let's use I and J it's
135:21 - a little bit clunky what I'm doing here
135:23 - uh
135:29 - um I mean honestly I could just do this
135:32 - all right no no it's fine it's fine plus
135:35 - equal r
135:37 - I is less than w
135:40 - I is less than h
135:43 - uh so I actually should equal x
135:50 - plus W let's just do the offset
135:54 - let's just do the offset here so now I'm
135:57 - going to say rectangle X Plus i y plus j
136:01 - r r
136:05 - and I'm going to say stroke 255 fill
136:12 - let's just give it like 175.
136:15 - okay and then this is
136:17 - this is January what what day am I on
136:20 - 17. oh yeah January 17. okay
136:25 - um
136:26 - so now if I were to say draw grid
136:30 - from zero zero with height uh with a you
136:35 - know 80 as this should give me
136:39 - a grid awesome this is what I want to
136:42 - see now
136:44 - um for any one of these
136:47 - if random one
136:50 - is less than there's a 10 chance and
136:54 - R is less is greater than
136:58 - one pixel
137:00 - let's just say two pixels
137:02 - I could draw a grid
137:05 - from X like where I am
137:07 - y Plus
137:10 - J
137:12 - and then
137:14 - the width is r and then the actual
137:19 - amount of grid stuff is like just just
137:21 - say r divided by 10.
137:25 - this is nuts
137:27 - is that actually like does this make
137:29 - sense
137:32 - infinite Loop here
137:36 - let's make it like a very low
137:38 - probability
137:40 - no not R is greater than if w
137:44 - you know that's fine W and H are always
137:46 - going to be the same
137:50 - the width and height is the thing that
137:53 - I'm doing and then it's going to be 10
137:54 - by 10. so let's try this
137:58 - okay
138:00 - maybe I just never got one
138:11 - just see
138:12 - uh
138:24 - oh I'm in draw
138:26 - no Loop is what I meant to do but
138:34 - so it did it
138:36 - a bunch of them
138:41 - let's see
138:44 - update the version of P5 that's what the
138:47 - error is someone's telling me
138:52 - um okay
138:53 - so why
138:59 - why oh why is this not working
139:05 - two
139:15 - let's just say w is greater than uh 80.
139:23 - there okay so this is right this is what
139:25 - I'm attempting to do
139:27 - and apologies for the um
139:30 - I think that can just be
139:37 - oh I see it's just so okay so let's
139:40 - start with
139:43 - 800 by 800. let's start with 200 okay
139:49 - okay there we go
139:51 - this is what I'm looking to do but
139:55 - I don't think my exit condition is
139:57 - working
140:05 - I don't want to do it if the individual
140:11 - size is smaller than eight let's see
140:15 - okay
140:19 - there okay it's working this is what I
140:21 - meant to do
140:22 - uh
140:24 - cool grid within a grid within a grid
140:27 - now
140:28 - I was kind of imagining uh that this
140:31 - would be a little bit more interesting
140:33 - so let's actually start with it should
140:36 - actually be
140:38 - 400
140:42 - but most of the time the probability
140:44 - should really be based on
140:51 - um
140:52 - okay ah this is what it should be
140:56 - foreign
140:58 - yeah so I'm kind of making a little
141:00 - quad tree-esque like thing there we go
141:04 - I like this better now
141:11 - all right I'm sure you can improve this
141:15 - but grade with integrid within a grid
141:18 - moving on definitely not a grid
141:23 - um let's revise this one to be January
141:25 - 18.
141:27 - so how could I do this but have it not
141:31 - be a grid
141:36 - um
141:44 - oh and then
141:50 - okay I love it definitely not a grid
141:56 - art deco
141:59 - that was my fastest one yet
142:02 - all right deck that might be my favorite
142:03 - one uh art deco
142:07 - Art Deco I need some help here
142:16 - I need some inspiration for this
142:23 - um
142:23 - [Music]
142:25 - oh dear this is tough
142:37 - let's make the Chrysler Building
142:39 - let's make the Chrysler Building in
142:42 - um
142:45 - black and white not deck oh Am I Wrong
142:47 - oh black and white black and white oh
142:49 - look at this
142:52 - hold on
142:55 - okay so this is black and white
142:59 - let's just
143:01 - adjust this yes I got it everybody
143:04 - to for number 90.
143:09 - the problem is it's already black and
143:10 - white I should have made it maybe I
143:11 - should make it colorful and then that
143:14 - would be the previous one I'll swap them
143:16 - uh okay let's um
143:27 - okay
143:38 - uh
143:40 - uh and
143:43 - um black and white black and white
143:45 - um
143:46 - let's actually do this
143:49 - um
143:52 - yeah this is pretty interesting actually
143:54 - why it's doing it in the a different
143:57 - order than I imagined
144:02 - all right
144:04 - I kind of like this
144:07 - black and white
144:10 - I mean I could start adding grayscale
144:13 - but I kind of love this
144:16 - is the strangest thing I've ever made
144:18 - and yet
144:20 - it's actually nicer than anything good
144:22 - enough done okay Chad's telling me I'm
144:25 - done Art Deco okay we're gonna make the
144:27 - Chrysler Building
144:30 - or something like the Chrysler Building
144:32 - okay
144:33 - so I'm taking this as inspiration let's
144:36 - look at this image
144:37 - okay so this is like Okay so let's go to
144:40 - P5
144:43 - uh oh
144:45 - something bad is happening
144:48 - from another window but I have no other
144:50 - windows open
144:53 - so I might have to recreate
144:58 - some of these
145:00 - which one is this by the way
145:04 - uh
145:08 - did somebody who has access to the
145:10 - coding train account actually update
145:12 - this that's what it seems like uh let's
145:14 - make a new sketch
145:16 - okay so now we're going to say
145:18 - background zero
145:21 - um
145:21 - let's draw let's do I have an idea okay
145:25 - what if I draw an ellipse that's at zero
145:28 - that's that width divided by 2 comma
145:30 - height
145:31 - that is thin like 50 and is like 300
145:35 - pixels High
145:38 - and if I were to say stroke 255 no fill
145:42 - you know this should be a rounded
145:44 - rectangle I think that would be better
145:48 - um and then uh rect mode
145:53 - you know what let's Center
145:55 - and let's actually
145:59 - wear a wrecked P5
146:03 - I always forget how the okay so this
146:06 - which one do I want
146:07 - I think I want like this rounded Corners
146:10 - so I just
146:12 - give it like a radius for the rounding
146:18 - okay so now I need to do a bunch of
146:22 - these
146:24 - for
146:33 - and then let's just say height minus I
146:36 - just times 10. just to start
146:39 - oh where's my auto refresh okay uh
146:45 - uh uh
146:48 - uh okay let's make it ah okay I see so I
146:52 - really need to think about how I'm doing
146:54 - this
146:55 - so the rectangles all should be ah not
147:00 - their location it's their height that I
147:02 - want to change
147:04 - that's actually going to make it much
147:05 - easier uh
147:10 - okay great
147:12 - and then
147:15 - their width should be minus I times five
147:19 - something like this
147:21 - oh
147:27 - pretty good okay moving on
147:30 - uh Art Deco this was sorry what was that
147:34 - that was January 20.
147:39 - Art Deco everyone okay uh Shadows ooh
147:45 - Shadows oh hmm what if I did something
147:49 - with my like Ray casting
147:51 - um that could be interesting
147:53 - or
147:55 - just kind of like negative space
147:59 - uh let's we could use that hexagon again
148:01 - we could make shadows with it I'm I'm
148:03 - kind of like I don't have an idea for
148:05 - this one oh I'm not even on it's Persian
148:08 - rug
148:09 - Persian rug
148:13 - sorry I'm always looking at the bottom
148:15 - of my screen Persian rug oh dear this
148:17 - one's going to be hard
148:20 - um Persian carpet
148:23 - wow
148:26 - wow okay
148:30 - wow
148:34 - uh
148:44 - wow okay so I do have an idea
148:49 - for how to do something that's really
148:50 - it's going to be really a poor facsimile
148:53 - for this like it's but I think we can do
148:58 - uh let's try just drawing stuff out from
149:01 - the center and reflecting it
149:04 - so let's go to P5
149:08 - uh this is January 21.
149:13 - the heat didn't come on I turned it off
149:15 - I turned it down to low
149:17 - very cold now I can't get the
149:19 - temperature right
149:20 - okay uh I also just if you let me just
149:23 - check my phone to make sure nobody in my
149:25 - family is like the house is on fire
149:27 - anything like that although presumably
149:30 - I would notice okay I'm getting a lot of
149:33 - okay yeah okay okay no no
149:36 - emergency
149:39 - uh so I think everything's good okay
149:42 - what am I on
149:43 - Persian rug okay
149:47 - um
149:48 - Persian rug yeah image processing one
149:50 - that's not a bad idea uh fractal tree
149:53 - reflected that's so Paradise demon
149:55 - that's kind of what I was thinking so I
149:58 - was going to create
150:00 - a just let's just make a vector
150:05 - uh which will start in the center
150:10 - and I'm going to draw a circle at V Dot
150:14 - X V Dot Y and have it be like 20 pixels
150:18 - and let's put background zero
150:24 - and Okay so
150:27 - What if I
150:28 - 4
150:30 - let I equal zero I is less than 10 I
150:34 - plus plus
150:37 - and this should be zero zero
150:41 - and I need to translate to width divided
150:43 - by 2 height divided by 2.
150:48 - and then I am just going to rotate by 2
150:52 - pi
150:53 - divided by 10.
150:58 - okay and this should be a number
151:04 - this could also work for reflections so
151:07 - now if I were to just say V Dot X Plus
151:10 - whoops
151:15 - this should I should see this there we
151:17 - go okay this is what I was hoping to see
151:20 - um
151:23 - okay I know stroke
151:29 - a fill 255 10. now
151:33 - let's have it
151:36 - start to I was gonna have a branch
151:40 - so this should actually be
151:45 - uh Dot
152:00 - uh and then
152:02 - um
152:07 - foreign
152:17 - function
152:25 - um and then
152:27 - uh
152:31 - uh
152:35 - so now I need a uh dots is an array
152:43 - uh dots push new DOT
152:49 - and
152:51 - uh for uh every dot uh dot of dots
152:59 - a dot dot update
153:06 - what do I what am I doing wrong here
153:09 - what's
153:14 - dot dot update dots class dot dots push
153:19 - new DOT
153:27 - here at line eight in dot update
153:32 - oh this
153:33 - [Laughter]
153:36 - oh
153:46 - [Music]
153:49 - okay excellent
154:04 - why
154:09 - okay great
154:14 - it's going so fast
154:20 - this should be the same oh I don't want
154:23 - to update sorry ah I definitely need
154:27 - no wonder no wonder no wonder
154:33 - show
154:37 - um okay so show
154:43 - um this is a silly way to do it but
154:49 - okay
154:50 - great now
154:54 - um
154:55 - what I want to do is change the way okay
154:59 - so
155:02 - this is the position
155:11 - now uh
155:14 - the direction is uh
155:17 - I don't want to make it random
155:23 - but I guess I could
155:31 - uh let's just do uh P5 dot Vector let's
155:36 - just try random to start
155:39 - and then
155:45 - okay and then
155:47 - this dot d i r rotate
155:52 - uh
155:53 - I don't know I don't know what I'm doing
155:55 - exactly
155:58 - okay
155:59 - so
156:02 - what I'm thinking is
156:07 - thank you
156:12 - um
156:13 - that at any given point
156:18 - to too slow
156:21 - um and
156:23 - let's make this smaller
156:26 - um
156:29 - there could be
156:33 - if let's just try this if random one
156:38 - is less than
156:40 - 01
156:42 - we're going to say
156:45 - dot stop push
156:47 - new DOT
156:50 - this dot pause
156:54 - so what I mean by that is uh and
157:00 - dot dot length is less than 10 let's
157:03 - just say that for right now
157:07 - okay
157:08 - but it is kind of doing what I wanted it
157:11 - to do but and um
157:16 - the thing is the dot needs
157:21 - to get a
157:24 - uh pause
157:27 - uh if pause this stop pause
157:31 - equals pause dot copy
157:34 - else this dot pause equals else
157:39 - stop pause equals create vector
157:42 - so
157:47 - um
157:49 - so uh now it's way too like perfectly
157:52 - swirly
157:54 - that's not really what I meant for it to
157:56 - do so also this dot rot
158:01 - for rotation equals a random value
158:03 - between negative
158:05 - 0.2 0.02 and
158:10 - this dot rot
158:14 - and I should probably give it some nice
158:16 - color
158:21 - what do we think anything resembling a
158:24 - Persian rug
158:27 - if I think if I gave this color
158:30 - okay I'm just so bad at color uh this
158:33 - dot color equals I need where's that
158:37 - palette
158:38 - didn't I have a palette
158:40 - um
158:43 - okay uh
158:49 - um would you mind
158:52 - giving me an array of strings in
158:56 - JavaScript that are hex codes for
159:00 - Persian
159:01 - rug colors
159:04 - there's no chance this works right
159:13 - [Laughter]
159:17 - oh I got one from Sable Ray but I can't
159:20 - copy paste from the chat is my problem I
159:23 - really have a problem that I'm not set
159:25 - up well
159:26 - to uh do that okay
159:30 - uh
159:31 - uh this
159:33 - dot color
159:35 - equals random from the Persian rug
159:39 - colors
159:40 - uh and then uh Phil
159:44 - is it gonna let me add an alpha to a
159:46 - color this way no
159:49 - that's cruel
159:51 - but we're just gonna have to leave it
159:53 - like this
160:06 - okay it's it's a little too like
160:10 - kaleidoscopy
160:11 - [Music]
160:12 - it's snow flaky
160:14 - MB lab says it has a Persian I approve I
160:17 - think I did my best effort
160:20 - um it could definitely be improved
160:22 - it's annoying me that I can't just give
160:24 - it the string plus an alpha
160:27 - um
160:28 - hold on
160:30 - this is gonna this is the worst thing I
160:32 - could ever do
160:33 - but
161:01 - all right I
161:05 - oh you can do color this color set Alpha
161:08 - good point okay I kind of like this it's
161:10 - not a Persian rug at all but I made
161:12 - something moving on
161:13 - Shadows
161:16 - um Shadows this is where I was stuck
161:19 - okay I have an idea
161:21 - let's just adapt this
161:25 - duplicate uh 22.
161:29 - so we're gonna duplicate this
161:31 - we are going to set the color
161:35 - to zero
161:37 - uh how do you do those ternary things
161:41 - random one
161:43 - is less than zero then I can turn it up
161:47 - right here I can never learn something
161:49 - new how about the Syntax for a ternary
161:52 - operator that I can never remember
161:54 - question mark yeah or colon I kind of
161:56 - had it right question mark color zero
162:01 - colon color 255.
162:08 - and now ironically
162:11 - I don't want the
162:13 - uh this dot color
162:16 - and let's do a square and wrecked mode
162:22 - Center
162:24 - all right
162:26 - and oh
162:34 - right oh less than 0.5
162:46 - it's pretty interesting actually
162:50 - um
162:53 - I I know this is a very loose
162:55 - interpretation of shadow
162:57 - but I quite like this okay but I had a
163:00 - thought of how to make this much better
163:03 - um so let's add something here which is
163:05 - that the dot gets a size
163:09 - I'm just using 24 and this dot r
163:14 - and
163:16 - um
163:18 - so the first dot should be
163:21 - uh
163:23 - uh shoot
163:24 - I've really
163:28 - okay hold on so if it's the first one
163:32 - other uh
163:34 - okay I got it this is very awkward and
163:38 - it absolutely could be confused
163:40 - improve R equals 100 the stud r
163:45 - otherwise this dot R equals r
163:49 - and then what I'm going to do is
163:52 - [Music]
163:54 - by the way I that was just so it didn't
163:57 - go completely insane but
164:00 - um
164:01 - and this dot R is less than
164:06 - it's greater than like five pixels
164:10 - because what I'm going to do stop stop
164:12 - stop stop is when I make it I'm going to
164:15 - say uh this dot R times 0.5 so it's
164:19 - going to okay
164:24 - why are they not actually oh the squares
164:27 - are
164:29 - why do the oh because the rotation
164:30 - sometimes
164:34 - so strange
164:37 - I really don't know what I've done here
164:39 - but this is my interpretation
164:42 - of Shadows
164:47 - I like it
164:48 - moving on
164:51 - what whoa moire
164:54 - uh okay uh uh boy this is I I really
165:00 - need to also constrain the length let me
165:02 - just fix this
165:04 - and this dot dots oh dots dot length
165:10 - is
165:12 - less than like 100. it's probably what I
165:15 - should do
165:19 - I don't understand
165:22 - why it makes whatever it makes
165:25 - but
165:27 - I'll take it uh
165:33 - this is pretty
165:35 - not what I expected and yet I really
165:37 - like it okay but I'm moving on the next
165:39 - one okay
165:41 - um what am I on 23 is more moire let's
165:46 - see if it has anything for me
165:49 - so yes okay
165:53 - so I mean
165:55 - uh oh I like this ooh interesting
165:59 - Mare
166:01 - overlapping two sets of concentric
166:04 - circles that looks nice
166:06 - okay let's just go
166:09 - uh
166:14 - okay so 400 400
166:18 - um
166:21 - no fill
166:23 - no stroke 255
166:27 - for let I equal zero I is less than a
166:30 - width
166:31 - I plus equals two
166:34 - Circle
166:37 - 200 200 I
166:45 - okay well
166:48 - uh
166:52 - okay uh
167:01 - I know we need an angle
167:14 - okay
167:16 - uh
167:25 - okay and
167:30 - let's do
167:33 - I should really have translated to the
167:35 - center here but
167:37 - what are you going to do
168:02 - oh I don't have the background on
168:05 - I wonder
168:16 - there you go I don't know what this
168:18 - looks like on YouTube
168:20 - um swap black and white I like this idea
168:25 - um
168:32 - um
168:59 - what what did I just do to ruin this
169:07 - oh
169:09 - that's plus eight okay fine
169:18 - okay done this is good kind of some
169:20 - interesting moire stuff uh let's just do
169:23 - this though
169:26 - this will be interesting
169:53 - pleased to be enjoying my moire pattern
169:55 - okay
169:58 - textile
170:00 - didn't I just do Persian rugs
170:03 - it's a textile
170:05 - uh what textile
170:08 - textile
170:11 - textile what do I do for textile
170:17 - hmm
170:21 - I like the idea of like creating this
170:23 - little tube like things I like this I
170:26 - guess to make something very texturey
170:28 - looking
170:29 - is kind of cool
170:33 - my brain is not is starting to melt a
170:37 - little bit
170:42 - oh by the way I forgot to put in the
170:44 - number for this one this was January 23.
170:51 - now uh textile
170:55 - hmm
170:57 - something with pixels
171:00 - like melting pixel neighbories
171:04 - do plaid or textile pattern Vector
171:08 - Fields good idea copy paste Persian rug
171:11 - yeah just don't do weaving okay why not
171:15 - okay how about I like the idea what uh I
171:18 - like the idea of um a flow field so
171:22 - um
171:23 - let's make a flow field
171:25 - oh wait a sec
171:27 - let's make a flow field but with my grid
171:30 - within a grid thing so which one was
171:33 - that
171:36 - oh yeah this moved everything crazy off
171:39 - of the grid so 17
171:44 - K let's start with this I gotta I got a
171:47 - weird idea here that kind of makes no
171:49 - sense but I'm going to do it anyway
171:51 - um
171:54 - textile 24.
172:00 - okay so in draw grid there is no longer
172:03 - a rectangle rather I am going to draw
172:08 - a line
172:11 - which goes from
172:14 - uh X Plus i y plus J to X plus I
172:20 - plus r y plus J
172:23 - okay
172:25 - uh and we're gonna say stroke 55 no fill
172:27 - let's just say stroke
172:30 - weight uh
172:33 - R uh divided by four just out of
172:36 - curiosity
172:38 - whoa Okay so not exactly what I meant to
172:42 - happen but it's a good start
172:45 - because this is kind of what I was
172:47 - thinking but
172:49 - um
172:51 - let's do r divided by 16.
172:55 - our r divided by 8 because essentially
172:58 - when it's the smallest I want it to be
172:59 - one pixel okay
173:02 - okay so now what I'm thinking is
173:08 - um so I'm going to need to say I'm going
173:10 - to need Loop
173:11 - gonna need to say random seed so it does
173:15 - the same
173:17 - grid within a grid I also want it to be
173:20 - I think more frequent to be perfectly
173:22 - honest
173:28 - it's funny how it's picking the top two
173:29 - twice in a row or did I just
173:34 - really
173:36 - put my thumb on the scale oh cause a
173:38 - random seed
173:41 - that's fine
173:43 - um
173:44 - that's fine
173:46 - but
173:49 - let's just get a different random seed
173:51 - there we go okay perfect okay so this is
173:54 - my textile start
173:55 - uh and now what I'm thinking of doing is
174:01 - changing this to translate X Plus i y
174:05 - plus J
174:06 - whoops not here
174:10 - remember the line is okay
174:12 - so push Matrix
174:17 - pot Matrix
174:21 - translate to X Plus then this is much
174:23 - easier now zero zero
174:26 - to R comma zero
174:28 - this should be exactly the same
174:30 - great
174:32 - and now what I would like to do is
174:37 - um
174:38 - uh
174:41 - let's get an angle
174:45 - float angle equals noise
174:49 - uh
174:51 - uh X oh this is so ridiculous
174:54 - um hold on
174:56 - hold on let's just do
175:02 - um that's fine you know what let's do
175:04 - this uh X offset equals X plus I divided
175:08 - by 100 I'm doing this late the lazy
175:12 - coder's way
175:16 - uh
175:19 - uh
175:22 - uh two pi
175:25 - times that rotate by that angle
175:35 - uh no no no no no no no no no thank you
175:37 - very much the rotate goes there
175:41 - okay
175:43 - uh not the most textiley thing ever
175:47 - but
175:55 - nothing like a little Z offset
176:07 - okay to lead the way uh
176:11 - okay I want to do it hold on
176:15 - don't like the way that I did this
176:17 - translate X plus I plus r divided by two
176:21 - plus r divided by two negative r divided
176:25 - by two r divided by two let's do it this
176:28 - way
176:32 - and stroke weight uh 10
176:38 - and oh no that's not the stroke weight
176:40 - is
176:42 - uh
176:44 - and stroke 10 and background here
176:50 - all right
176:53 - oh no whoops that's not set up
176:58 - uh
177:03 - [Music]
177:05 - wow this grid is really weird here
177:09 - so I don't know why I just didn't do
177:11 - like a regular flow feel because the
177:13 - grid is really kind of making it insane
177:16 - and there's like
177:18 - um so I have a weird idea I have some
177:20 - weird ideas to make this more textiley
177:23 - uh color would certainly help
177:27 - um
177:30 - it's very slow
177:33 - uh
177:41 - hold on sorry I'm thinking I'm thinking
177:43 - I'm thinking I'm thinking
177:46 - um
177:52 - add color and I've got it
177:55 - yeah
177:58 - uh
178:02 - okay
178:05 - um
178:17 - ah come on
178:21 - uh
178:32 - I don't know what I'm doing anymore I
178:34 - really like
178:35 - lost it here
178:42 - all right
178:46 - just stop after a set number of frames I
178:48 - also should do that right or I should do
178:51 - the um
179:03 - all right we got a nice pallet uh
179:10 - is this how you do that in Java
179:49 - all right
179:51 - um
179:55 - I'm gonna have that Alpha again issue
179:59 - um
180:17 - oh I can't put a string in there
180:36 - because I think it'll let me oh what
180:43 - is it gonna like
180:45 - is processing gonna be smart enough to
180:47 - do this
180:51 - I don't think so
180:59 - oh there we go awesome
181:25 - done this is not at all textiles but you
181:29 - could you could keep going with this
181:31 - okay
181:32 - all right we've got to look up this
181:33 - particular artist now I think I need to
181:35 - stop building off of what I did before
181:38 - um
181:40 - let's look at these
181:47 - oh bright polka dots oh amazing
181:50 - Infinity Room
181:52 - oh my God these look incredible oh wow
181:58 - wow okay so I definitely want to use
182:01 - these colors that I just got or like a
182:03 - red and a yellow this is incredible
182:07 - uh
182:09 - um oh my goodness I love this so much
182:11 - I'm never gonna be able to do something
182:13 - as beautiful as this
182:16 - um but let's give it a try
182:18 - um okay let's go to JavaScript I think
182:22 - um
182:24 - and
182:26 - let's
182:29 - um
182:30 - anyone want to give me in the chats um
182:33 - uh colors
182:35 - for this okay
182:38 - um oh you know what I want to use
182:45 - let's go to this
182:46 - coding challenge
182:50 - I really need to work on my
182:53 - Google they really should really should
182:55 - come up with
182:56 - this
183:03 - I think this could be a nice start
183:06 - okay let's
183:09 - let's use this
183:11 - duplicate
183:13 - January uh 25.
183:18 - four o'clock people let's just see so
183:20 - this is the example
183:21 - that I guess I made in that video
183:25 - uh just red blue green orange okay oh
183:28 - Emily says I got to see one of her
183:30 - exhibits in person okay so this is what
183:33 - I want to do maybe this is actually
183:36 - not right but let's give this a try
183:39 - first of all let's update this with the
183:41 - new sp5 it's a good chance for us to
183:44 - whoa okay one point 5.0
183:54 - still going okay great
183:57 - um
184:05 - I'm just curious here what are some okay
184:07 - great and then K is like 20.
184:11 - what does the K do
184:21 - I don't I I did this whole thing and I
184:23 - made a whole video about it I don't
184:24 - remember maybe this is just too
184:26 - elaborate right now
184:28 - but it is kind of a nice
184:31 - starting point what I want I think I
184:33 - have an idea though
184:35 - uh
184:37 - uh where am I drawing them oh geez
184:40 - I hate not having any room okay
184:45 - okay
184:47 - done no it's that can't be done
184:50 - for that I already made
184:52 - so let's have the colors
184:55 - be
184:57 - um
185:01 - um based on
185:09 - um so okay
185:16 - at the ordered Point uh let's get the
185:20 - distance between point dot X Point dot y
185:23 - and
185:26 - the center uh width divided by 2 height
185:30 - divided by two
185:32 - and
185:34 - um
185:35 - stroke weight r
185:37 - point and then I can say
185:40 - Point dot X Point dot y
185:44 - um whoops where did I go
185:48 - and what I want to do here is say
185:50 - palette
185:52 - equals
185:56 - um
185:57 - ff000
186:00 - ff0
186:06 - and what was another
186:10 - um it was another color like I saw
186:15 - uh red yellow
186:18 - let's just do red yellow and
186:21 - black
186:24 - and then
186:28 - um okay so what I'm thinking is
186:31 - uh then float
186:35 - and then uh int no no no let index
186:40 - equals floor d
186:44 - stroke palette
186:50 - index so I want to see like concentric
186:53 - circles
186:56 - uh and what did I miss here
186:59 - object arguments is not a valid color
187:02 - representation
187:05 - what am I missing here
187:12 - palette a stroke
187:19 - okay
187:29 - okay
187:35 - floor
187:37 - of the distance
187:39 - oh oh oh
187:42 - modulo
187:44 - palette dot length
187:51 - huh
187:52 - oh and the the black ones you don't
187:54 - really see
187:57 - um but I bet you you would if I made the
188:01 - background white
188:08 - okay and then oh it doesn't doesn't look
188:11 - good I don't like this
188:15 - and
188:17 - it's not doing what I thought it would
188:19 - do which is
188:22 - give me like nice concentric circles
188:26 - um
188:35 - yeah that there we go this is what I was
188:38 - imagining
188:40 - uh background pink
188:42 - okay
188:44 - oh also
188:46 - well that's doing anything weird but
188:50 - um
188:59 - hold on let's just now
189:07 - if it's bigger it's better
189:13 - so I uh orange instead of yellow
189:18 - I want the sizes to be bigger
189:21 - I want them to change size
189:26 - I probably should do Circle I really
189:29 - should do Circle packing not this
189:32 - I don't know what K does
189:43 - yeah that was a mistake
189:46 - restart please
189:50 - uh can I
189:54 - make R change over time
189:58 - total is 25.
190:02 - R ti times equals 0.99
190:07 - oh no no no each time you draw sorry
190:12 - oh no now they're just shrinking
190:28 - it's kind of strange I should probably
190:29 - move on
190:32 - uh
190:34 - I should probably move on
190:36 - I think actually this might look nicer
191:01 - not what I intended
191:03 - but kind of interesting
191:11 - done done the German flag now in circles
191:21 - I I have an idea
191:37 - oh it never stops
191:48 - I don't like that I started with this
191:49 - it's good enough okay
191:55 - I kind of like whatever this did
192:05 - just to understand what's going on
192:07 - better oh yeah
192:09 - awful awful okay
192:19 - just give me one more moment
192:22 - to feel better about this one I do not
192:25 - like what I've made but I I really do
192:27 - just need to move on
192:29 - um
192:36 - there
192:38 - okay
192:41 - perfect
192:42 - okay
192:45 - my kid could have made that this kind of
192:47 - works
192:48 - uh um
192:52 - my kid could have made that
192:56 - this is an interesting prompt
192:58 - okay how about
193:03 - um
193:08 - 4 15 January 26th
193:12 - um
193:13 - my kid could have made that
193:43 - I like those colors
193:46 - um
193:47 - I've kind of lost them though
193:50 - um
193:51 - I did a terrible job I feel so I was so
193:53 - excited by that one I think it
193:55 - overwhelmed me okay
194:38 - okay ready
194:46 - I made a little nice drawing program
194:50 - just a random color every time you click
194:53 - the mouse did I do something weird that
194:55 - it only is shades of blue and green
194:57 - it's never oh there we go okay
195:00 - done
195:01 - my kid could have done that
195:05 - because that's how I've taught them how
195:06 - to do that in P5 in the style of Clone
195:10 - okay
195:12 - uh January 27th I'm really getting tired
195:15 - everybody
195:16 - oh these look amazing
195:20 - okay
195:21 - um oh I like this let's do this
195:24 - let's make something that looks like
195:26 - this
195:26 - that is beautiful we can do this okay
195:30 - all right
195:31 - okay uh I will do this in P5
195:37 - uh let me close a bunch of these windows
195:42 - that I don't need anymore
195:44 - goodbye chat GPT
195:47 - okay so we are going to say
195:50 - background
195:53 - red
195:56 - then our colors are going to be blue all
195:59 - right so then let's make we're gonna I
196:02 - want it to be different each time so
196:04 - what I need is a function that draws two
196:09 - arcs
196:10 - so I'm going to write my own function
196:12 - called arcs which is not Arc
196:16 - and I need I'm not gonna work I just
196:18 - need a size
196:22 - um I need a
196:24 - size and an out a stroke and a fill
196:29 - color I know sorry for my variable names
196:33 - or actually no it's just a fill color
196:36 - so it's just a size and a color
196:39 - so a color one and color two
196:44 - so to do this I need to draw so let's
196:47 - let's just translate to the center
196:54 - and I need to draw one Arc so let's just
196:57 - make it white first
196:59 - one Arc that is zero zero R times two
197:05 - let's just make a diameter because I
197:07 - don't think the r matters here
197:09 - so diameter diameter and then zero
197:14 - zero to Pi it's probably going to be and
197:17 - then another one
197:20 - that is pi
197:23 - to 2 pi
197:27 - uh no stroke
197:31 - and a fill zero
197:37 - let's do
197:39 - um oh and so I really should be color
197:42 - one
197:43 - color two
197:45 - and I'm going to say arcs
197:49 - 100 0 255.
197:53 - Okay so
197:55 - life
197:57 - how lazy am I rotate pi divided by two I
198:02 - could rewrite my code or just do that
198:04 - okay so then this first one the back one
198:07 - should be so now I need to say four let
198:10 - I equal uh
198:12 - uh with
198:15 - divided by 2
198:17 - uh I is greater than or equal to
198:21 - 24. I
198:24 - let's just say zero I is greater than
198:26 - zero I minus equals 50. let's just see
198:32 - what this does
198:34 - and
198:36 - uh I
198:40 - okay now we're not seeing them because
198:44 - the colors are the same
198:56 - okay
198:57 - uh
199:01 - and
199:04 - um 50 seems kind of arbitrary
199:07 - uh oh well actually
199:09 - so let's
199:14 - uh oh I like how this one it could be so
199:17 - let's just pick from a few different
199:18 - colors
199:19 - so let's make a palette
199:24 - which has
199:27 - uh
199:28 - black
199:31 - White
199:36 - um oh I you know interestingly how this
199:38 - side is oh let's just do that so it's
199:41 - this side is only black or white
199:43 - and Palette one
199:46 - can only be black or white
199:49 - and Palette two
199:51 - can be uh like
199:55 - yellow
199:58 - it's like
200:00 - pink
200:02 - it's like blue like a light blue
200:08 - um blue kind of a yellowish I mean
200:11 - somebody with more talent for color will
200:14 - make a nice version of this
200:21 - it's kind of a nice orangey
200:24 - um
200:34 - okay I'm making up some colors
200:37 - uh
200:39 - uh so arcs
200:41 - random palette
200:43 - one
200:45 - random palette two
200:48 - okay
200:52 - I like this
200:55 - I like this
200:57 - we are done
200:58 - that is oh January 27 Oh my God
201:06 - okay
201:12 - boom generative poetry
201:15 - yeah
201:18 - um
201:19 - oh I have so many examples that make
201:22 - generative poetry
201:23 - so like what should I do right now
201:28 - maybe I should pick one of my I should
201:30 - just give up cut myself some slack here
201:35 - generative poetry coding train
201:42 - um
201:52 - poetry
201:54 - diastic
201:59 - all right let's create something new
202:02 - um let's use an API
202:05 - um
202:07 - so what was it that I was using that was
202:09 - like project Muse or something
202:12 - API this is it
202:18 - okay Muse
202:21 - there's something called The Muse API
202:23 - word dictionary
202:25 - something called like data Muse
202:28 - word yeah maybe this is it yes this is
202:30 - it
202:31 - okay
202:33 - um because I think this is a free easy
202:34 - to use API
202:36 - so
202:38 - um
202:42 - means like sounds like spelled like
202:44 - related word
202:48 - topics
202:50 - uh
202:51 - yeah
202:53 - uh
202:56 - bring the results
203:02 - meaning words related to duck
203:07 - so okay start with okay let's let's see
203:10 - words
203:12 - okay
203:13 - so
203:15 - let's go to P5
203:19 - new sketch
203:22 - uh January 28th
203:26 - uh
203:28 - uh we are going to ah I have an idea
203:31 - okay this is going to be the generative
203:32 - poetry thing okay great uh let's say
203:36 - okay so first of all
203:38 - give me a second here to say background
203:47 - okay
203:49 - uh
203:54 - okay
203:55 - um we are going to make a canvas
204:00 - and uh
204:04 - and
204:06 - create uh in input equals create input
204:16 - okay and uh
204:20 - why why why why why
204:23 - oh I am that is a reserved word okay
204:26 - um get
204:28 - uh user input
204:31 - poem start
204:33 - poem start okay so poem start Dot
204:39 - what is it changed
204:42 - right poem
204:46 - and then function write poem
204:50 - is going to be an async function and I'm
204:53 - going to say response equals await fetch
204:59 - I'm not going to use low Json because I
205:00 - I really want to just do this with async
205:03 - I think
205:04 - um and so now we're going to go to here
205:11 - um
205:15 - and then
205:17 - um I'm going to say let prompt
205:20 - equals poem start
205:24 - dot no right
205:26 - yeah poem start dot value
205:29 - and so here now we're going to say
205:34 - um
205:35 - whoops
205:37 - prompt
205:46 - um and then this is going to be
205:50 - asleep
205:54 - thank you
205:55 - so much oh come on just to add one
205:58 - you're insane okay
206:01 - then
206:14 - okay uh rainbow
206:20 - okay fine fine fine fine fine fine
206:28 - and I'm gonna not I'm just gonna put
206:30 - rainbow in here now so I don't have to
206:35 - and I'm actually just gonna say right
206:38 - I'll make it work eventually that and am
206:42 - I standing in front of the code too much
206:45 - sorry about that
206:47 - uh okay
206:49 - um I just wanna see if this works
206:53 - oh
206:54 - console.log Json
206:58 - okay great I got a hundred words
207:02 - fry
207:04 - okay
207:05 - yeah so uh okay
207:08 - so now I'm going to
207:20 - next let's call this next word
207:23 - poem start value
207:32 - prompt
207:35 - and then
207:40 - why doesn't this work now
207:42 - oh next word
207:46 - okay so now
207:50 - um
207:53 - I should be able to
207:58 - get any word
208:01 - from a random one so let word equal
208:05 - random Json
208:09 - uh fill 255
208:13 - and uh
208:15 - uh let x equal random with
208:18 - let y equal random height
208:22 - text
208:24 - uh word
208:26 - X comma y
208:29 - text align
208:32 - Center Center
208:35 - and it's saying object object because it
208:38 - is word.word
208:41 - word dot word
208:44 - okay and
208:47 - uh
208:48 - uh
208:49 - size
208:54 - should be uh like 64 to start
208:58 - okay
208:59 - so now the idea is that I have
209:03 - is that I would then do
209:09 - set time out
209:14 - another async function
209:18 - a weight
209:20 - next word word dot word size
209:25 - uh like 75 percent
209:28 - and then do that like no no one second
209:31 - later
209:40 - uh and then the whole thing should not
209:42 - start
209:46 - foreign
209:55 - poem
210:01 - okay
210:02 - and let's make this
210:05 - 800
210:07 - by 800
210:13 - I have so um okay hold on
210:17 - let's make this uh
210:21 - 800 800 by 600
210:26 - and okay so let's use the word
210:30 - kitten oh rotate them by 90 degrees I
210:32 - like that idea
210:40 - I'm probably gonna go and all right so
210:43 - uh
210:44 - yeah
210:46 - so I like the idea of rotating them
210:53 - thank you
210:57 - uh
210:59 - translate I'm so tired rotate pi divided
211:04 - by 2 times random
211:12 - rotate uh random one
211:15 - let's just say
211:17 - if random one is less than 0.5 rotate pi
211:22 - divided by two draw the text at 0 0.
211:28 - um I don't think the size should go down
211:31 - by very much
211:33 - so now let's try
211:35 - [Music]
211:36 - um
211:37 - uh rainbow
211:40 - hit enter
211:46 - what just happened
211:49 - did I ruin it
211:54 - next word
211:56 - prompt.value size get the word text size
212:00 - oh push Matrix is not
212:02 - the function
212:12 - did the rotate mess it up
212:20 - [Music]
212:32 - what have I done to destroy this
212:43 - push pop yes okay uh console.log word
212:48 - dot word are we getting something
212:55 - I think the event isn't happening
212:57 - anymore
213:18 - I mean this is a terrible way to display
213:20 - a poem
213:22 - but I'm not sure why my change stopped
213:24 - working
213:28 - oh maybe you actually have to write in
213:29 - it you can't just hit enter and I
213:31 - probably should have a button
213:46 - okay so now okay okay relax relax okay
213:52 - here we go ready generate there we go
213:54 - okay
213:56 - all right everyone
213:58 - this could be vastly improved
214:02 - but it was an interesting exploration of
214:04 - using this API and now we are moving on
214:07 - to
214:09 - maximalism
214:11 - maximalism that's the opposite of
214:14 - minimalism I suppose
214:21 - maximalism oh my God
214:24 - I'm so close to being done
214:26 - ah
214:27 - so close to being done uh maximalism
214:34 - maximalism
214:40 - well this could be maximalist
214:46 - like here's a way of making this
214:47 - maximalist
214:51 - but no let's not do that let's start
214:53 - over Okay let's go to processing
215:01 - oh
215:05 - maximal okay
215:07 - January 29 January 29th
215:13 - okay now
215:15 - we're definitely going to use full
215:17 - screen
215:20 - but maybe not just yet
215:29 - maximalist okay
215:31 - how about I use
215:35 - every possible polygon and every
215:37 - possible color
215:39 - okay I have an idea so where's that
215:42 - polygon function I have I just have to
215:44 - rewrite it because it'll be faster oh
215:47 - there is a polygon function in
215:48 - processing okay polygon
215:51 - processing reference
215:56 - it's an example I don't think there is
215:58 - one
216:00 - there's like a p shape
216:05 - I don't believe that there's a polycon
216:09 - okay I don't believe that there's a pot
216:11 - okay
216:12 - this is going to be maximalist
216:15 - s
216:16 - where's my polygon function let's find
216:19 - it anybody remember what day I did the
216:21 - polygon draw a grid no it was before
216:23 - that wasn't it
216:24 - 12 polygon here it is awesome
216:28 - uh here's my polygon function January
216:30 - 12.
216:35 - okay
216:37 - so
216:39 - void draw
216:43 - four okay we're gonna do every possible
216:46 - polygon
216:48 - uh and I equals one I is less than
216:53 - a 50 a gone
216:59 - no
217:01 - let's go let's just go up to a
217:05 - is it a decagon is that what 10 is
217:09 - um
217:11 - and 4 would be a rectangle so let's No 3
217:14 - would be a triangle so let's do that 2
217:16 - would be a line
217:19 - one would be a point okay maximalist
217:22 - uh um
217:39 - oh the I is first
217:46 - okay this is looking good
217:54 - okay I kind of have an idea here
217:58 - four
218:02 - int
218:04 - W equals we'll start with 100
218:09 - W is greater than we'll go down to 10.
218:15 - we'll go down to zero we'll say w minus
218:19 - equals
218:21 - 20.
218:26 - 10 20. I don't I've kind of lost what
218:28 - I'm doing here
218:31 - then we're going to say for uh x equals
218:36 - zero X is less than W X plus equals w
218:42 - aximalist Y is less than h y plus equal
218:48 - w y is nothing with some height
218:53 - uh and counter equals zero
218:59 - um
219:05 - counter
219:08 - and this is
219:11 - w
219:15 - uh
219:22 - a little grid uh
219:26 - uh counter equals counter plus one
219:33 - modulo 10.
219:39 - do I have too many oh
219:44 - okay this is this is what I was thinking
219:47 - now
219:48 - the polygon function draws it at the
219:51 - center
219:51 - [Music]
219:52 - so this should really be offset
220:02 - so if I were just doing let's get rid of
220:05 - this outer loop for a second because
220:07 - this makes no sense
220:09 - no idea what I'm talking about here
220:13 - that didn't work
220:24 - I want to draw a grid of the polygons
220:28 - what is wrong with me and I want to
220:30 - rotate through okay
220:33 - let's make this 10 for a second
220:36 - oh it's the whole oh no no it is doing
220:39 - what I think it's supposed to do it's
220:40 - just ah
220:42 - uh polygon counter plus one
220:48 - counter plus two there at least needs to
220:50 - be two
220:53 - and it should be stroke 255 fill 255
220:57 - just for right now okay
221:01 - oh wait
221:03 - okay and then
221:06 - it should be half
221:08 - the size
221:12 - okay and then
221:14 - y should be on the Outer Loop
221:18 - I'll evenly divides
221:21 - um okay so we're gonna pick a random one
221:24 - so forget about the counter
221:30 - int random between one and
221:35 - 11.
221:39 - uh
221:43 - uh no no no no
221:46 - this is very weird what I'm doing but
221:48 - it's it's gonna be maximalist you'll see
221:51 - okay
221:52 - uh so if W is a hundred this is going to
221:55 - be maximalist okay great
221:59 - now
222:03 - um what I wanted to do was this
222:11 - okay good good
222:14 - uh
222:16 - uh now the color palette is going to be
222:22 - um
222:28 - okay
222:30 - uh
222:46 - and
222:49 - um
222:53 - um
223:03 - uh how am I going to do the color
223:09 - s
223:12 - tie d t d e x d I have no idea what
223:16 - anybody's talking about in the chat
223:19 - um okay wait wait wait this is gonna be
223:21 - maximalist
223:24 - um
223:26 - okay what's I know
223:28 - color mode HSB
223:32 - uh
223:33 - uh 360.
223:35 - 255 255. okay
223:38 - so this is going to be
223:42 - just out of curiosity let me just
223:45 - check a color
223:53 - okay perfect
223:55 - now it is going to be
223:59 - um
224:01 - counter
224:04 - counter
224:11 - I'm just gonna make it a float for no
224:12 - good reason
224:16 - I mean I could make it random
224:19 - I kind of like the idea of it being in
224:21 - some sort of order though
224:33 - no
224:49 - foreign
224:51 - what have I done
224:54 - um
224:59 - am I doing the biggest ones first okay
225:01 - hold on
225:10 - okay
225:11 - this is what I meant to happen
225:16 - I guess it just covered oh you know what
225:23 - I now I understand what I wanted to do
225:27 - okay I understand what I wanted to do
225:29 - that's maximalist
225:35 - done no no no no no no
225:38 - trust me just give me a second here
226:12 - yes this is what I was looking to do
226:16 - only it's much less than I imagined so
226:21 - let's start with
226:26 - I was thinking of something different
226:28 - but this is close enough okay
226:31 - and
226:32 - now we're gonna just forget about this
226:34 - counter
226:35 - lovely idea
226:39 - let's make it horrifyingly random
226:45 - there we go maximalism
227:01 - just just bear with me
227:04 - just bear with me
227:07 - there we go maximum okay hold on
227:18 - maximalism okay moving on
227:22 - minimalism minimalism okay
227:25 - we're gonna do this one can I get out of
227:28 - here how do I get out of this
227:30 - okay minimalism
227:32 - oh my God I'm so close to being done
227:35 - three hours and 27 minutes
227:39 - okay minimalism
228:24 - no no no no no no no
228:27 - why does that not
228:31 - oh
228:38 - minimalism
228:42 - deliberately break one of your previous
228:45 - images
228:49 - and works and ruin it
228:51 - huh
228:54 - well all right folks which one should I
228:58 - do I got 30 prompts
229:01 - anybody have a have a uh request
229:09 - which one should I break and ruin
229:15 - the No No I have to do 31. I'm not done
229:18 - I'm not done
229:21 - I need to break one of them
229:24 - remove semicolon from your last one I
229:27 - mean I guess I could you know what I'm
229:28 - gonna do I'm gonna write but I try to
229:31 - ruin this one
229:32 - that's a really good idea
229:35 - uh okay
229:38 - I have a really good idea just just hold
229:40 - on
229:40 - okay
229:43 - I know how to ruin this one
229:45 - um
229:50 - so hold on uh columns is with divided by
229:56 - with
229:57 - rows equals height divided by width
230:03 - um
230:04 - hold on I'm just going to do this a
230:07 - different way
230:09 - just trust me I have a really insane
230:11 - idea
230:13 - oh wait wait wait
230:15 - uh it's fine I'm just gonna recreate
230:17 - this but write the code a different way
230:23 - and then I'll I'll move on when I plus e
230:26 - plus plus
230:41 - same exact thing
230:43 - okay that's and now I'm going to ruin
230:46 - this one
230:48 - uh so January 31
230:52 - I'm gonna make it so annoying to look at
230:56 - um
230:58 - int
231:00 - uh
231:02 - call uh just R1 equals int random calls
231:12 - and R2
231:14 - and Rose
231:16 - okay
231:17 - uh
231:19 - Translate
231:52 - there we go
231:55 - foreign
231:57 - I have ruined it
232:04 - why no did it not oh because the rotate
232:06 - I made I didn't even like not what I
232:08 - meant to do this is what I meant to do
232:16 - it's it's this one down in the corner
232:21 - it's just off like a couple of things
232:24 - I kind of love this
232:27 - I also think I should say Phil 253.
232:33 - and then stroke
232:36 - uh
232:37 - uh uh stroke weight 0.1 I mean this is
232:41 - now ridiculous now I'm ruining it too
232:44 - much it's making it too obvious but
232:51 - yeah this never mind never mind with
232:53 - that it's gonna ruin the fill slightly
232:57 - going to be like a little bit more
232:58 - noticeable
233:01 - all right I think we're good done
233:05 - three minutes 32 seconds right now three
233:09 - hours three to three hours 32 minutes
233:13 - and 50 seconds
233:15 - I have completed all of January uh all
233:19 - in this one live stream thank you to uh
233:22 - Rafael for you know really for inspiring
233:25 - me with the idea for this
233:27 - I would love to figure out a way to
233:29 - compile all of these
233:30 - I'm sure there's a nice way this stream
233:32 - could be like edited into something
233:34 - I did not record all the feeds
233:36 - separately though so I doubt I will do
233:38 - that but I would like to put everything
233:41 - up
233:42 - uh at that GitHub repo
233:46 - I'm I'm spent
233:49 - um
233:51 - I don't even I don't even know what to
233:53 - say anymore
233:55 - so I'm gonna try to document everything
233:57 - here
233:59 - um I do feel pretty good about this
234:01 - record time
234:02 - I felt like there were some good
234:04 - projects in there actually some seeds of
234:06 - things
234:07 - if anybody wants to take anything I made
234:10 - today and make something out of it I
234:13 - would be so thrilled that you have full
234:16 - permission
234:17 - to just take you know take the the
234:20 - things that I made and put them out into
234:22 - the world with your own creative Twist
234:25 - on them I'm gonna be getting a good
234:27 - night's sleep and I'll be back in here
234:28 - recording
234:30 - um my intro to coding with processing
234:33 - videos tomorrow
234:35 - and that's all I've got to say anybody
234:37 - have any last things they want to say
234:39 - this is it it's the end I don't know
234:41 - like I wish I could like run through
234:42 - them now like a screenshot of each
234:44 - anybody wants to help me compile what I
234:47 - did today into some like quick slide
234:49 - show or something I would totally accept
234:51 - that gonna try to put everything here
234:55 - um here's what I'm gonna do actually let
234:57 - me do this it's gonna need to be
234:59 - reorganized
235:01 - but
235:03 - I mean at least at a minimum do this
235:06 - let me quit processing I actually feel
235:07 - like a little bit dizzy
235:11 - so I think it's gonna be fine though
235:13 - processing
235:15 - January so
235:19 - wait a second are these from last year
235:22 - there might be some from last year shoot
235:25 - um hold on hold on ah
235:28 - I know how to use a computer
235:31 - okay no
235:32 - great these are all from today so let's
235:34 - at least do this
235:41 - so I'm gonna just upload these whatever
235:43 - they might be
235:47 - good luck on your exam tomorrow Lucian
235:51 - I'm going to commit these changes the
235:54 - rest of so here's what I would love
235:57 - and I'll work on this myself I'm not
235:59 - asking any all of you to do like free
236:01 - labor for me but I know people do enjoy
236:03 - contributing so I think I would love to
236:05 - have like a readme that has like a nice
236:08 - grid of images of everything
236:11 - then all of the code nicely organized
236:14 - and numbered so the P5 code should
236:16 - probably be linked to the web editor and
236:21 - um but maybe it makes sense to also
236:22 - include it as separate files I'm not
236:24 - sure but if you go to this URL
236:28 - that should you should be able to see
236:31 - all of the P5 uh sketches
236:34 - so
236:36 - um anybody who wants to help uh with
236:38 - this repo maybe file an issue just to
236:40 - say I'd like to work on this like I'd
236:41 - like to work on the screenshots the
236:43 - readme I'd like to help clean up the
236:47 - the processing code or help to like add
236:49 - the P5 code I'm open to anybody doing
236:51 - that
236:52 - um
236:53 - and
236:55 - um that's it I'm gonna go I'm gonna put
236:57 - on my little song where I say goodbye
237:00 - I don't know why I've just had this
237:02 - forever
237:05 - and if anybody has any questions in the
237:08 - Discord or in the YouTube chat I will
237:10 - let this play out
237:13 - um
237:14 - I feel like I should have a I should
237:17 - make a thumbnail for this video
237:19 - let's which is the most
237:23 - I really like the
237:26 - um
237:27 - definitely not a grid black and white
237:29 - one I think or sh let's look at that
237:31 - January 19th
237:33 - is that processing
237:36 - hold on
237:38 - I'm gonna make like a screenshot that I
237:40 - can use as a thumbnail
237:42 - for this video
237:48 - I hope you learned something or enjoyed
237:50 - this what was it
237:53 - black and white was 19. here we go
238:01 - [Music]
238:05 - this is going to be very artificial but
238:10 - let's try it again
238:14 - [Music]
238:19 - I don't like what it's giving me
238:24 - [Music]
238:29 - all right that's fine
238:32 - okay
238:33 - this is my screenshot
238:42 - there could use that image and
238:44 - completed January
238:46 - all 30 prompts 31.
238:54 - thanks everybody I really appreciate you
238:57 - joining me for this
238:58 - I have to admit I really didn't want to
239:00 - do it I mean
239:02 - I was feeling lazy I want to just sit
239:04 - around on the couch all afternoon
239:06 - I have a lot of work to do back teaching
239:09 - but this was really fun and I feel very
239:11 - accomplished and I've kind of also like
239:13 - was feeling sad that I wasn't doing
239:15 - January so there we go foreign
239:18 - [Music]
239:22 - so I'm gonna be here for another 30
239:24 - seconds
239:27 - three and a half hours is pretty good
239:29 - [Music]
239:30 - five o'clock
239:33 - I guess I talked for a half an hour
239:35 - before
239:35 - [Music]
239:36 - and then I I I'm wasting some time now
239:40 - [Applause]
239:42 - back hurts all right everybody that's
239:45 - the end of the song I'll see you next
239:47 - time I live stream uh join the Discord
239:50 - say hi on Twitter uh say hi in the
239:52 - comments all those things love you all
239:54 - see you in the future
239:58 - as always I always forget that this dot
240:00 - this stock this dot this dot this stuff
240:03 - this stuff
240:04 - this stop this stop this stop stop just
240:09 - stop just stop
240:11 - this stop this stop this dots

foreign hi I think you're hearing my voice right I think the audio is not coming from the right source should be HDMI 2. foreign thank you foreign foreign foreign foreign thank you thank you thank you well hello everybody I'm a strange color hold on a second I really thought I had fixed everything and I'm gonna go to this camera and I'm just gonna put it on auto white balance Auto white balance okay hopefully that's going to make everything better hello happy Sunday welcome to a live episode of the coding train with me your host Dan wearing my Baltimore Orioles cap and really really just not sure at all if this is a good idea or not but I am going to Jump Right In let me just sort of like take a look at the chat um yeah I don't know what's going on with my camera settings maybe I look okay now uh maybe the lights a little bright I'm not going to get worried about it too much uh Raphael is in the chat Rafael Sable Ralph Sable wrath Sable Rafe is the inspiration for today although to be honest I did have this idea in my head although I would never have thought to call it a speed run or thought about it as like a thing just kind of like oh hey I'm not really having time for this January thing let me see if I could just do a live stream and like do a whole bunch of them that was as far as I had thought then I saw Rafael who has a wonderful twitch stream I think there's a link in the video description that you should check out he may actually be live streaming right now I'm not sure uh creative coding news and the weekly coding challenge so much stuff wonderful stuff going on there um that he is doing so you should definitely check out um Raphael's twitch stream so but I'm here to attempt uh you know what I think is a Young Person's game and I I am not a young person no more I was at one point in my life but when I was young there was no YouTube there really was no YouTube I had no way of bringing myself to you the viewers that I do now so I just have to do it as an old person and most of the time that involves me falling flat on my face and yet here we are again so you might not have seen me in a while I've been I've been kind of experimenting with YouTube shorts I know people love short form videos you can see it in the comments nobody ever has a negative thing to say about a short um but um which has been sort of a fun experiment I hope to do more of that I have a lot of ideas for them I just haven't figured out a kind of way of getting it into a regular weekly workflow a huge thanks to Bernie uh who has been working on the editing and production along with a creative team of folks that he works with um you know you can find out more about that if you check out my Twitter feed if you can bear to go on Twitter which I barely can these days but I'm still using it because I don't know what else to use YouTube Community posts anyway um ah so I I have a um I was on a year sabbatical and I had this whole list of projects and my sabbaticals now over and I'm still trying to do those projects one of which is a new full start to finish learn to code with processing complete beginner series I've recorded maybe a third of it now um hopefully you know certainly by the end of February I would hope that it would be out so that's kind of why I haven't been making new content because I'm recording this it's just gonna come out as one three or four hour Chunk on YouTube um I'm working on the nature of code book it did not hit my deadline but I am making progress without I would talk about all these things like I usually do on a live stream but we don't have time for that today um to Fox the bomb ass do I wear shorts in the winter well guess what I wore shorts today outside because I am now uh training for the Brooklyn half marathon which is on May 20th I had my first day of training today and that was like an easy two mile jog um and um uh yeah I wear shorts It's not that it's not that chilly today it's in the 40s in Fahrenheit that is okay um so I I'm reading the chat and I'm reading the comments what about Mastodon I have attempted it I have made tutorials in Mastodon I have a mastodon account I don't know I just haven't had um the time to really fully just just to like sort of move myself to a new platform I don't I barely use this stuff anyway so but yes I in in theory Mastodon is the perfect place for me and yet I can't seem to manage to do it um all right so go Seb for the London 10K I did actually run the London marathon is that the shirt that I'm wearing no this is a I got a a New York City marathon I have run three marathons I don't think I will ever do that again but a half marathon is I feel like a perfectly reasonable goal at my age and abilities um okay so um uh thank you Rafael for the if I point this way right for the live split that's showing up here let's move over here um I'm I don't know whether to use processing or P5 or something else even I just kind of have processing open let's go to the browser um I did make a repo a GitHub repo where I intend to and I would love help with this where I intend to document everything I do today here but I'm not going to do it while I'm coding so I'm gonna have to do this after the fact and anybody who wants to help with that I mean it's certainly uh you know help with it like pull request I don't know if it would make sense for you to like pull request stuff while I'm going or file issues but um yeah um all right lots of wonderful questions in the chat we don't got time for this today because Raphael completed this in five hours and 48 minutes and if I'm still here 5 hours and 48 for minutes from now we've got a big problem because I cannot stream for you know I've got children who need to have dinner uh do their homework I've got a dog who needs to be walked so I think that if I could go ease I could certainly go for two and a half hours um so let's see how it goes all right so just to talk about what this is if you're not familiar January January is a artificially generated month of time where we the community of people of the of Earth I don't know maybe the aliens or the aliens doing January build code that makes beautiful things I will not be making beautiful things today I will be building code over 744 hours for every 24 hours there's a new prompt you don't have to follow the prompt exactly or even at all but you know we put effort into this any language free framework or medium on any Planet see the millions are the aliens are doing January made of hashtags uh so you can do all that stuff tips and tricks so uh and then there are prompts so I'm going to start with January one you can see I have the live split thing here going it if it all goes according to plan as soon as I hit this key over here it will start when I finish this one I hit the key it goes on to the next one um let's set up some rules for myself let's I have a new whiteboard camera so I might as well come over here let's make up some rules and I'm um um um okay there is life split does have a pause but I don't tend to use it okay rule number one no rules who cares this is just for fun for educational slash entertainment purposes you pick one of those if it's both then boy I could just retire and this is the last live stream I will ever do no rules two um I but but if there were rules I can start from a coding challenge or any coding train video so I can start from any example that I've previously made but I don't want to just take the example and say I'm done so what is a threshold I must at least at least change uh one uh Behavior a behavior or visual element mildly significantly that's not proper English but you get the idea somebody I can ask chat GPT to clean that up for me um I am done uh prompt is complete when I see um uh uh what's a good Emoji for the chat the train emoji you can flood the chat with train emojis if you think I'm good to go or if I say so uh quantity over quality I'm trying to get through the whole thing they're not going to be brilliant they're not going to be sophisticated they're not going to be beautiful they're just going to be a thing that I did and like if you think about it if we're talking to let's say two hours 120 Minutes that's like four minutes per prompt if there's 30 prompts there's 31 prompt but technically I could just do up to 29. since that's today and I could do the other two but it wouldn't be the full speed run all right I'm gonna go look at the chat to see if anybody has anything to say about these rules is that is that even in Focus I don't know but you get the idea okay um so uh okay um mildly significant digits is the name of my next band says Chris um uh Yaz hire yazarax asks been under a rock for a while welcome back I hope you had a nice time under your rock I'm on the wrong screen uh here we are um and um do you have any open AI videos yet uh not really I made one short which is kind of like a bit of a jokey thing with chat gbt and I have been working on a lot of experiments uh finetuning gpt3 to my own bizarre tastes um and I've been enjoying that but I haven't made any videos about it yet okay anybody have anything they must say um before um do I take a drink of coffee every time you say oops rule number five I like that anybody else have anything else they want to say should I I will you indulge me with one plug um I have been working a lot with the wonderful streaming service called nebula and I have a new page on nebula um which is right here if you go to go.nebula.tv codingtrain this is a paid service it is a way of supporting the coding train uh I uh anybody who signs up to the coding train I I I'm a coowner of nebula and there's a revenue sharing thing but I you know I'm I'm really interested in alternatives to YouTube and I think there's a lot of wonderful things about this platform that I can go on and on about in particular um all of these amazing originals and classes uh original content some really fantastic um so if you like sort of documentaries and educational content science if you like movies you're gonna find stuff Patrick Williams glasses this thumbnail is like this is like I aspire to make a thumbnail as good as this someday um so anyway please check that out if you're interested I made a class uh using an apple II that you would get it I I used to talk about this as a bundle with curiosity stream no forget about I mean curiosity stream great go sign up for curiosity stream I'm now encouraging people to actually just sign up for nebula directly it is four dollars a month with the discount if you go through um this link okay I just wanted to mention that as my little plug thank you for that Indulgence now are you ready are we ready I see kvikbon is in the chat uh excellent I always like to have some moderators in the chat that are helping me out all right it's also cold in here because I I ran the heat I got this very loud uh heater because I'm in a garage it's just like an electric fan thing that hangs from the ceiling but I turned it off to stream so I might have to turn it on at some point if it gets too cold are you ready for this uh uh I should put on some music I feel like one thing also is I might try to do some of this without talking through it so much because uh it'll help you go faster and it'll also save my voice I'm back teaching again at NYU this semester I gave a presentation yesterday I'm streaming today I want to record videos tomorrow I've got to teach Wednesday and Thursday I have a problem losing my voice I should probably go to like a vocal coach to make sure I'm breathing and speaking correctly but um yeah so here we go everybody this would be really sad if this doesn't work ah shoot okay wait do I come on I set up my uh hotkeys number lock one go there we go okay here we go uh the timer's going okay perfect Loop infinite Loop endless gifts okay this would actually be a good time to use P5 because of the new safe get fun until I get into the B5 web editor hell okay uh let's name this so we can find all these later January 1. all right um I did a whole like short about save gifts let's go to save gif uh save GIF function no no no no no no no no no no no no um this is like the greatest thing ever uh let's let's do this okay um I'm gonna bring this copy pasting code from anywhere on the Internet is also okay just asking chat GPT to do it for me though not okay um okay I have my limits people okay save GIF five seconds buddy I want it to be a looping GIF so I want it to be frames there's a way that I do this it tells me here um duration options options can have a delay a string that can either be seconds or frames huh an optional object that can contain two or more arguments delay units okay so I want it to be like some number of frames and I want the units to be frames and let's say uh frames equals make a variable like like 360 frames I don't know what's going on here uh let's have an angle and then let's say uh angle mode degrees angle equals angle plus one all right so now we just need to do something with like sine or cosine um let's do line from okay let's do translate I I really have no idea what I'm doing here making this up as I go I wish I could look at the chat to get good suggestions uh translate to negative width divided by two zero with divided by 2 comma zero I don't okay let's just see let's put on auto refresh which is dangerous because okay so that's good I like this um let's say background zero with let's put some Alpha in there oh let's make that a variable like let r equal with divided by two negative r our stroke weight 4 stroke 255 all right I've got a line uh let's have that be times cosine of the angle okay I like this and now let's also uh rotate by that angle okay yeah this is good it's a good start I've got something going here dude now the thing is if I'm doing this background thing I have a feeling it's not gonna like look like it's looping done still done yes I agree but the thing is so now I need to hit s all right let's see what happens delay parameter must be a number oh I forgot delay parameter must be a number it is a number 360. did I not do that right uh duration delay oh I have to have a delay okay uh come on delay zero okay and go all right let's get our gif okay downloading my gif I don't understand how that worked but it did awesome I'm done boom that was four minutes and 38 seconds take that January that they're not my you're my friend January so take that just yay thank you okay prompt number two that was awesome okay prompt number two yeah four minutes that's what I got to do to get done in two and a half hours uh prompt made it ten minutes all right I have an idea let's just make a timer okay let's uh let's do a new sketch we're gonna call it January 2. did you all know that P5 has a Dom Library see this is my excuse for just doing something very basic which is that I'm going to teach you something um let's say no canvas let's go over here into style and say uh background color that should give me uh there we go um let's get rid of draw let's make a um timer which will be a oh I can I don't I'm just doing all this in setup so timer equals create p uh ten zero zero okay okay there we go then let's say timer uh also let's let's get rid of whoops one thing about Auto refresh is it will always I mean um Auto refresh will take you all the ways to sketch.js which I don't love let's get rid of margin and padding canvas is nothing we need to look at worry about okay uh timer uh uh Style font size you can apply CSS directly in P5 through the um so I can create a HTML paragraph element I can apply CSS directly in P5 did you know that you could do this and now let's do a let timer equals so 10 minutes time see this is my loose interpretation of the idea 10 minutes times 60 Seconds because there's 60 seconds per minute and so then uh we're gonna say oh whoa whoa whoa whoa ah no no this is let timer paragraph timer paragraph style and the actual timer is going to start with this then I'm going to say set interval function timer minus minus timer P dot HTML timer and then a comma 1000 every second it will go down by one this is a terrible way of doing this but let's see what happens so this is going to count down 600 seconds laughs I would like to change this to convert it to minutes and seconds I think we could do that I think we can manage that okay um so minutes equals timer divided by 60. floor and then seconds would equal timer modulo 60. and then I could say minute colon seconds and this is what's known as a string literal okay what did I get wrong here oh set no seconds and let's have it start like this no I have an error oh timer needs to be a string then oh no no oh I see it has to be oh I see but I can just do this okay great I mean the thing that I don't like here though is I want to number format this I'm taking up way too much time will this work I would like my auto Refresh on now please yep uh how do I set the font style font family Courier there we go this is not made in 10 minutes but this is a very quick timer in 10 minutes done I'm going for quantity not quality okay um okay so by the way uh if set interval is unfamiliar to you it is a way of saying execute a particular function which I've made an anonymous function in here every number of milliseconds that's a string literal which is a way of making a string of text out of um uh characters and values of variables number formats a great way to format numbers all right this is good okay moving on uh glitch art oh I like this glitch art this should be this shouldn't be too hard okay uh all right everybody let's uh glitch let's glitch a photo okay can I uh air drop this now this is a terrible photo of myself um all right this is silly Let's find let's let's uh let's get Gloria Gloria Gloria pickle no no I aspire to have really awesome SEO for Gloria pickle images okay I'm gonna have to I'm just gonna go over here while I dig up a picture of Gloria pickle um so just take a second I'm just gonna log into a different Google account for myself a search Gloria pickle and let's find a wonderfully cute picture of Gloria pickle I do like this one I think I could show this to you all it's just lots of beautiful pictures of Gloria pickle um but um I'm gonna pick one this one looks good uh download let's do this in processing okay everybody I feel like pixel stuff for me is a little bit easier in processing and this should be the picture that I downloaded oh going to processing Okay so what am I on January day three is this three okay oh no okay so uh downloads there we go whoops no no come on give me that give me a DOT there I cannot see okay uh also this is a huge file which is just going to cause US problems uh also let's let's crop it um 600 by 505 beautiful okay um size oh I think by the way I so I think in processing if I want to use a like the size of an image to be the size of the canvas I can use the settings functions and then I can say gloria.with gloria.height I don't think I need anything in setup but just let's draw image Gloria zero zero okay what happened what's wrong here people gloria.jpg the sketch path is not set oh interesting uh oh I'm so confused all right I'm gonna I'm gonna worry about this later and oh I never no I did load the image okay let's not get too fancy here what have I done January three I'm looking at the chat I'm looking at the chat uh oh Joseph these are good ideas I didn't see them until just now um what's going on here let's try this again I mean it really shouldn't matter but fine you want to be like that let's be like that yeah okay I'm not sure why I'm I I thought there was no issue in processing with loading an image outside of setup and draw but I guess I'm confused about that um but we're all good here um okay so this should do the trick okay here we go um all right so now we need to make some glitch art uh I want to glitch the image I have an idea let's just say um in draw I am going to pick a random X and a random y this is not going to be very exciting I can already tell this is not the greatest idea ever but let's try it I'm going to pick two random spots I'm going to get color one uh I'm gonna do the quick and dirty way of getting a pixel from an image and then I'm going to say uh Gloria dot set X X1 y1 C2 Gloria dot set X 2 Y 2 C 1. and then image Gloria zero zero so I'm this should swap two pixels and now it's doing one pixel at a time however many times through draw [Laughter] let's just see uh if I do a hundred pixels at a time if this is actually happening I shouldn't have to do update pixels because oh yeah so it probably would make more sense for me to actually now this is just it has the appearance of adding noise to Gloria which I kind of like if I had more of a logic to how I was swapping the pixels that would be better um what if I were to always say something like this and Y2 equals y1 like with like if I swap them always like uh that's you know maybe slightly more interesting but not really I guess I should do like this is done though you can I'm sure this could get much better with more time we're already at like 20 minutes what prompt am I on I'm on prompt three so I'm not I gotta move on okay next one that's my glitch art quantity over quality intersections I'm excited about this one okay intersections um yeah I should not have just smeared the pixels that would have been better or like taking whole slices out using copy using copy would have been way better but I had this idea of just swapping pixels it wasn't a good idea but I'm moving on okay uh intersections oh this is going to be great oh I'm going to love this one okay let's go to uh examples and let's pick something from nature of code um just because um I said I I I like the idea of starting from scratch but um you know what there's something kind of nice about starting from scratch but I'm going to stick in processing um my good old my old friend bubble which has an X and A Y and an R okay is my bubble we're gonna uh can't call Float what's another word for float rise y equals y minus some random amount x equals X Plus some random amount uh R equals some random amount and then we're going to draw it as a you'll see we'll see what I'm doing here it's gonna be very exciting um uh uh Circle x y r times two a stroke 255. no fill for the moment okay um now oops uh so this is cancel oh January January what am I on for January 4 okay uh actually let's put this on another tab called Bubble and set up draw okay let's see if I did I do this right yeah all right awesome okay so now the bubbles they should really all start like uh below the screen like five times the radius below the screen let them go faster if they want a little more movement and then uh if if Y is less than not zero but like their size R then set y back to the bottom of the screen let's try making uh 50 of them okay here's all of our bubbles and floating up and now what I'm going to do is uh in draw I'm going to say for every bubble a and every bubble B as long as a is not equal to B uh the distance between a DOT X and a DOT Y and B dot X and B dot y if the distance is less than a DOT R plus b dot r that would be a way of checking if two circles are intersecting then let's draw a line from a DOT x a DOT y to B dot x b B dot y uh and the stroke weight will be that distance that might be really weird might be a terrible idea let's just make the stroke weight one right now and then let's no longer draw the bubbles okay what did I do wrong here stroke weight one stroke zero uh uh print line d we're getting distances everything's zero oh oh no wait the bubbles have an X and A Y are all the distances zero oh if a equals B if a does not equal V not equal I see it in the chat everybody thank you very much okay okay so now what am I oh is stroke 255 well I shouldn't be making mistakes yet okay awesome now this would be more interesting if perhaps this is like a Casey Reese special here this would be more interesting if um there were some kind of more sophisticated logic perhaps to the motion of the bubbles where they actually interact with each other so I probably should have taken like my flocking example or something like that would be much more interesting so you should do that because I have to move on I'm just curious here to go for 200 bubbles and let it ride okay there we go intersection um I I I I I I I really need to stop what I'm doing right now I swear this is going to be it like this oh too much too much too much oh that's fine then I wanted to um why is the background Alpha not working uh I just wanted to see something stroke weight distance if this would actually be interesting okay everyone's telling me to be done not really okay wait I just understand why the alpha the best oh that doesn't work in uh processing uh just let me finish this off there we go but let's just make this back to two okay we're done I kind of like it actually it's kind of strange I'm good I I know I know I'm gonna move on let's go back to 50. uh okay we're done I'm on number five debug view okay we could make a debug view of this let's make a debug view of this okay so let me save as January 5. so um so okay so I'm gonna do oh this is interesting uh what should be a debug view of this hmm I mean I guess I want to see the circles okay so I know what to do watch this this is going to be kind of weird but um debug I'm just going to say um intersect intersect is false intersect is going to be false for all of them if they're intersecting something a DOT intersect is true and B dot intersect is false and then in Show um if a DOT intercept oh no if intersect fill like red but with some nice Alpha else fill green with some Alpha so this should look like this now and the debug view probably should have the regular background and let's say no stroke and let's make this even lighter so now that's the debug view so we can see which ones are intersecting and which ones aren't and if the lines are correct why is my rectangle still in there so the whole thing is like flickering like crazy oh whoops I left this in there no wonder okay hold on this will help all right I like this I like that as debug view okay we're done moving on what am I on steal like an artist oh right Chachi PT let's use Chachi be teeth I think well I'm gonna have to log in I don't shoot um yeah let's see oh somehow for some reason I've got my password saved in here for my chat gbt account all right that's fine I don't want my I definitely do not want my conversation history being shown right now no no no no okay good foreign I leave you to try to decipher what kind of life my my what my life is like that that's my GPT history okay um make me an artwork that is uh create actually what I should just be doing is going and stealing whatever oh I know what I should do uh Raphael do you have all of your January prompts somewhere can I just get your January 6th one that would be good create an artwork that is not original that I can copy for a P5 JS sketch that is very artistic yeah I know I can okay I'm feeling lazy would you mind just giving me the code thank you what okay yeah basic code template no I don't want a template oh please oh they're giving me more okay all right this is gonna be good okay all right yeah yeah that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna build on my own okay what's this January six January six oh that does not look like starry night at all um let's make them swirl so let's make an array and um so let uh uh Stars let's just make it a vector push create vector X comma y then I'm going to say and then let's put this here uh then let's say four um for V of stars point V Dot X V Dot y stroke oh it should already Okay so let's see okay so those are the stars and now what I want to do is I want to say um uh uh okay how about this let's star of stars and then the vector is a P5 Vector subtract Center oh I should just do it this is so silly let's do Translate to the center we're going to make Starry Night people better than chat gbt ever could um uh minus width divided by 2 minus height divided by two where do I have an error line 22 so let a equal star dot heading a DOT rotate by pi divided by two um then um V equals Vector from angle a oh no no no okay no no no I'm going to rotate the oh I'm so confused yeah yeah yeah okay I got it I got it I got it star oh no I know this is very silly what I'm doing let V equals star dot copy there's so many other ways I could do this V Dot rotate pi divided by two that's what I want to do uh V Dot setmag to three or just a one let's just normalize it and then a star dot add V there we go Starry Night people okay starry night everybody moving on we're on Sample a color palette from your favorite okay hold on I gotta go look at the actual prompt there movie album cover all right I don't know what my favorite movie is uh um favorite movie how about 80 for Brady not seated do you know that there's a movie called 80 for Brady Brady for 80. I don't know it yeah sounds completely insane um let's do night of the coconut code not movie poster okay um night of the coconut because I am Patrick willem's number one fan um let's copy save this image Knight of the coconut let's go back and get our um oh this is actually kind of interesting the glitch of this actually became Cyclops Gloria this actually is working in a much more strange and wonderful way that I ever imagined it's quite horrifying but here we go uh okay yep well you're gonna have to sign up for nebula if you want to watch Night of the coconut nebula dot TV slash codingtree okay um so we are going to all right let's do this um we're gonna use this January 7th I'm gonna keep using this January 7 P image coconut coconut equals load image uh where is that image downloads light of the coconut um why I say NOC oh I'm like why does it say nature of code I name everything NOC for nature of code and I just named it NOC for Knight it's notc foreign really I'm just here pathetically uh um you know trying to uh put my name out there for a cameo in the sequel okay um notc dot jpeg um okay so now we've loaded that image it's missing or excess inaccessible oh who puts an e in their jpeg come on um um okay so uh int x equals floor random notc dot with this is a terrible way of doing this okay hold on a second let's look at the let's do something a little nicer the image is 1500 by 1500 okay that's a little bit nuts let's go and change it to um 800 by 800 perfectly reasonable size let's make our canvas 800 by 800 what was the prompt again I don't even remember sample a color palette okay and let's um oh yeah let's put this back in uh I'm not gonna worry about the intersecting bubbles anymore that was for another thing now we are just going to say uh color C equals notc did I call it notc here coconut that's not how you spell coconut notc uh notc.getxy fill C with some Alpha this is like me just recreating one of my sort of classic examples get int int for the Type image okay I'm going to convert it to an integer okay I like it I like it I like it a lot um let's make a 250 of these um let's do this start with background zero and let's make them much smaller and here we go everybody it is a night of the coconut okay we're done I'm moving on uh January 8th oh no sign distance functions I know sign distance functions do I have so I was learning these does this count because I think this is code that I wrote no it's code that I got for somebody else fascinating all right so wait let's let's make my own sign distance function assigned I really want to make a video about this sine distance function uh Circle rectangle no let's do Circle because this is a health we're going to do kind of hello world sign distance functions function which takes a position as an input and outputs the distance from that position to the nearest part of the shape okay um so many wonderful tutorials here uh okay so basically I would like to go let's make a new sketch we're gonna do a nested Loop to look at every single Pixel let's just make sure this is right and we're going to say um what is it called load pixels load pixels update pixels and I'm going to say no Loop just for right now let's run the sketch okay so this is giving me a random pixel a random grayscale value for every pixel and I would like to uh to save this January 8th is that what I'm on eight yeah sign distance function so now we need to write a function called SDF and it should receive an X and a y and it should return some kind of distance and then we're going to make a color out of it so in this case oh right one so um so let's imagine the distance is like kind of normalized between zero and one I don't know if that makes sense so now they're all white if I so I'm just hard coding a distance value I'm doing this in a terrible way let's let's actually return the distance and let's say and then color you know let's map the distance between zero and one to zero and two whatever the minimum and maximum is just to like set us up for Success later okay so this I believe is the idea of assigned distance function I receive any point and it's signed because I can actually return negative values for a distance which is something you wouldn't normally do because you can't have a negative distance but this is just talking about things in a abstract computer Graphics world so what would be the sign distance function oh no I don't want to for um like a circle I don't want sign distance field although that's probably the same thing so like 2DS distance to a given point would be right uh so the distance is the square root right so let's think about this so let's say I want stop stop stop no cancel cancel not now let's say I want to say the distance is the distance between x y and the center of the screen and um so I'm actually going to just now I don't need to map that so this I would get right so is this kind of like a scientist have I have I implemented this I want to do more with this but is this technically a sign distance function there's no negative um um I think I would do it as like a threshold uh like so for example I could say also say if distance is greater than 100 return one else returns zero um and that would get me something like this so I've written a function to draw a circle smooth step that would be uh not if there isn't the possibility of a negative but what do I do with the negative is that a sign distance function now Sable Rave says I'm done I need to really properly learn sign distance functions and do something more interesting with them I I did this over a course of a stream a while ago I think I should subtract yeah let's make it more interesting okay thank you um return well what do you mean like what do you mean by return subtract um distance minus well oh I see what you mean so and then ah okay so oh no okay okay come on yeah let's try this okay I see what you mean this would be what does this do yeah there we go this is a scientist's function yes now what if yeah oh how strange but why didn't it this I should see grayscale now shouldn't I this is some distance minus a hundred oh because I'm mapping between negative one and one so if I want to normalize that by like 200 I see you know yeah I like this okay we're getting somewhere just map the negative to red and positive to Green Oh I like that okay map color equals um let's do this whoo okay I'm really using sign distance functions okay I'm done moving on Plants oh this is this is a good one um all right everybody plants should I just do a can I just now I sort of feel like what I'm doing here today is instead of starting from my coding challenges and changing them I'm just like okay I know how to make a fractal tree actually this is something that I really should do let me let me try I have been let's make a fractal tree let's do this and we're in processing right now let's make a fractal tree and we'll um what am I on number nine so this is going to be fun we're going to use a little Pearl and noise we're going to make a nice little plant we're going to use random seed it's going to be great it's going to be great uh and I'm going to say Translate and then I'm going to say branch and we have some length let's call it 100 Branch by the length and we have a function called branch which takes length and it draws a line from wherever it is to uh zero a negative length and uh the stroke weight is going to be 2. and we're going to take a look at this and stroke 255 I think I'm faster in processing than P5 which is kind of counterintuitive but um we don't need a variable for that right now uh uh okay now there we go now we are going to say uh it um let's make it twothirds of the length as long as length is greater than four pixels uh and then we need to translate to the end we need to rotate by an angle let's let's put this in here because I'm going to do something with this uh let's call it a pi divided by 4 just for right now we're going to rotate by that angle we're going to branch um by the length we're going to say push Matrix and pop Matrix and we're going to rotate by negative of the angle I'm going to do this in a different way maybe in a second and we're going to rotate by the branch again uh and do we have a fractal tree yes we have a rectal tree okay fractal tree are really bad um really fast really bad uh let's make it a little wider uh because nope okay okay fine fine fine so picky okay there we go so now what I would like to do is the following when we get to the end of the tree I always had this thing in my head about to draw the leaves at the end I need to create like a um a whole set of objects and keep track of where all the positions so I could place them there that's true if I want to animate them but if I just want to draw some leaves at the end that are green some Alpha uh uh this should do the trick see now I have some leaves on my tree I like that I would like them to like fly off but instead let's do the following let's say a random seed one and I want my random numbers to always be the same and uh I'm gonna do something weird which I'm not always going to Branch the tree if random one is less than 0.75 uh uh branch to the right oh and this should this really needs a push in a pop also I mean it might I guess it doesn't need it technically but if random one is less than .75 let's see if this does what I want it to do just to like yeah okay so I like this um because it's a little bit interesting and now we are going to say float a x offset equals zero and oh this needs to be always here x offset equals zero then um the angle is noise of X offset which goes to zero one which will go between 0 and 2 well let's go between negative pi divided by 2 and pi divided by 2 and then X off plus equals 0.01 why oh map noise of X offs okay sorry map noise of X offset to this range map noise of X offset which goes from zero and one to the okay so I only need one parenthesis there okay this is kind of strange but um let's let's okay okay how can I have many more um let's start with it shorter and let's not I'll let you all tweak this much more okay that kind of like that um let's do this twothirds really makes more sense though um there I kind of like what I'm doing here okay so oh and now hold on I don't know what this is gonna do but X offset oh I should use 2D Berlin noise okay too fast too fast okay no no don't worry everybody don't worry X offset why offset and this is I should really do this with um I should really do this with like open Simplex noise I think it'll be much nicer okay there we go this is what I wanted yes okay moving on is the if repeated somebody's saying I do want to have these bees separate like and honestly like it should be much more rare that it doesn't branch and um I think this will actually be more fun if I go between pi and negative pi and if the stroke weight is also but I gotta stop I gotta stop there okay moving on I am by the way close to onethird generative music oh crud this is going to be tough for me all right how can I quickly make some generative music this I'm definitely gonna go to P5 I'm gonna need an example uh uh generative music oh no what am I on January number 10. okay January General music um P5 oscillator or envelope I want to let's use the P5 envelope do I have hold on coding train oh no I'll never P5 uh envelope okay uh okay let's uh copy this so this is definitely not me starting from scratch but that's okay uh let's make it a sine wave which I think will be a little nicer okay now you're getting that sound right okay uh um okay okay let's see now I don't want to play the sound um with uh the mouse press I don't want a canvas I mean let's leave the canvas there just in case I want to do something with it and then play sound oscillator start envelope play where is the frequency set how do I change it if I wanted to play a different like where was where do I set the frequency hold on let's see um and let's see let's go to P5 oscillator oh note envelope this is an example by the way this would be helpful if I could just watch this video tutorial right here uh scale array okay that's interesting let's take a look at this set set range oscillator midi value midi to frequency oscillator frequency okay I like this so let's try to bring this in here that's a scale array which are midi notes and then uh scale array notes the note is what just like as okay zero okay so let's see midi to frequency I need that function oh that's a P5 function midi to frequency that's nice um so I guess if I have this if what I do is I get a note um I try like did I get the notes yeah scale array scale array notes so let note equals zero and clay sound freak value wait what does it not know osc is not defined ah uh try osc so let's just call it I made it a sign oscillator so let's just call it osc open Sound control nope okay okay every time I play it okay so now um set interval play sound every uh second and then say note plus plus okay got it so now uh hey let's do a random walk we'll do a random walk note equals uh zero and we're going to say um uh let r e okay we're going to say if random is less if random is less than 0.5 I mean we could certainly do a more exciting algorithm here but I don't got all day uh no plus plus else no minus minus let's get this right and then uh note equals constrain note between 0 and uh what is it scalearray.length so this should work and let's just give it a little bit more time let's have it here and let's have it go faster foreign music everybody moving on okay that was ten okay okay um no no gorilla sun is telling me to take my time I am not gonna take my time it is 2 30 in the afternoon I need to be done I need to be out here by like four o'clock uh number 11 suprematism I'm gonna have to look at what this prompt is supremacism early 20th century art movement focused on the fundamentals of geometry painted in a limited range of colors okay um what is that limited range um should I ask chat GPT to help me um no I don't want to regenerate a response um can can you provide me a list of RGB values for soup for me to make a Sue prematis I really don't like the idea of typing suprematist here because to me it has other connotations but I understand that it's something else but let's see what happens okay wow this is really basic I could have done this myself uh Dave is giving me a palette so we're gonna go with Dave thank you is was that on the prompt uh we're gonna go with Dave's palette although I don't have the chat up so I'm gonna have to retype it um okay let's let's go back to P5 for this one uh new January 11. so we're going to get a palette and let's go for all right here we go I've got this chat nobody type any chat message zero a080a I'm so glad that Dave is here um zero eight zero a0a um uh F 7 F 3 F2 if you're wondering why I'm looking over there that's where I see the chat um zero zero seven seven e one um f five D two one six okay uh F3 fc3503 okay thank you um I really want nah it's fine okay so now we are going to limit myself to okay let's make it just with one rectangle one Circle ellipses always look funny to me and a lie so we're going to uh let color One Is Random from the palette but color two is a random from the palette you know what let's let's not do that I feel like we should be very prescriptive for this C of palette and if oh hold on I got it now four let I equal zero I is less than palette dot length I plus plus uh if I um uh if I modulo 3 is 0 then let's draw a rectangle at um I uh all right let's we'll make this random and we're gonna say fill palette I uh no stroke and we'll start with a background palette zero and we're going to go from one else if I modular two is this what I'm doing is it well this doesn't make any sense um every third yeah um wait I'm like losing my mind here wait hold on let me pull the chat back up because it lost I put an S instead of a d on the fourth color thank you okay so now what I want to do is what I'm saying is when it's one I want it to be a let's say when it's zero rectangle one Circle three line four rectangle so if why am I why is my brain not working here this was projected on the oh look uh big Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was suggested earlier sorry I'm not doing a good job of keeping an eye on the Discord chat that's also going on simultaneously um all right I need to take a breath here for a second I've been go go go go going I think I could pick one of three random shapes is fine so let's just do it that way if random one if R is less than 0.33 do a rectangle else if R is less than 0.67 do a circle and otherwise let's go look let's look at the Wikipedia page again I lost that page oh suprematism here it is um Circle oh I like the guy oh is it just one thing oh no suprematism oh I like this oh I can rotate oh I like this okay let's be a little bit more let's let's be a little more okay so else um stroke Okay so no fill stroke weight four uh line um I think let's just do vertical or horizontal lines which would actually be just like a rectangle but um I'm kind of let's do Translate uh if random one is less than 0.5 rotate by pi divided by 2. it's really doing this weird uh and then the length is a random value between uh 10 and width divided by 2. so let's write a line that is from negative length 0 to positive length zero and it shouldn't matter but I'm just going to put push and pop around this just in case and let's run this okay where's my line people no fill a stroke C right what was it called palette I um let's do uh let's do 50 and then pilot I Mel um I modulo palette length I don't know why I'm choosing to do this in order and other things random um what's wrong now why does that not work I palette dot length I oh what no it doesn't matter oh there there there I see I see oh I've done this in such a silly way um okay yay okay now uh everything is way too big and um I think we should also allow for rotate not trans let's rotate by I'm just curious here so I do this okay there we go I kind of like what I did suprematism everybody oh I need the 45 degree rotation should I make it suprematism I kind of like this not so bad it's actually quite a bit better than I expected depalm I totally agree All Right Moving On oh wait what happened oh because I went into the chat okay all right tessellation tessellation this I should be able to do no problem so I get my wave function collapse example out um okay tessellation what do I want to do here what do I want to attempt let's see what is the let's see what the prompt says it has any nice details oh should we try one of these more specific ones oh oh I've see I've done a lot of this maybe I should go get my um I've always wanted to do try hexanal try hexagonal tiling that looks like kind of fun uh this one is wild same kind okay I got to do something simple uh like this this looks fun should we try to make this how hard could that be let's try to make this okay hexagons are fun all right let's do this in processing um yeah so it's just January what number am I on now I'm getting tired I'm only on 12. okay uh okay uh so I need a function to draw a hexagon that shouldn't be too hard right there's a lot of stuff here um let's write a function hexagon uh which gets a what an X and A Y and a um let's give it like an R for size so we are going to say push Matrix pop Matrix I think I'm going to need to turn the heat on people which I know creates a little bit of a noise in the background I'm going to just go ahead and do that because I'm getting very cold my hands can't type right now so you're going to hear a worrying of a fan momentarily uh hexagon has six sides and we want to say create shape is that it well begin shape end shape uh and then I want to say x equals R times okay uh let's say angle angle is map I between 0 and 6 to 0 and to Pi X is R times cosine of the angle Y is R times sine of the angle set a vertex at x y um that should be it right oh we've got a bit of oh okay no okay Translate to the X Y 'all it's fine uh I don't know it's complaining at me here so let's just do this I hate underscores as variable names but I'm just doing it now okay so what happens if I were to draw um let's say fill 255. hexagon um 200 200 100. okay oops too many pop matrixes matrices okay that looks like a hexagon there's a polygon function well I'm doing it myself they'll be like all sorts of wonderful possibilities here I should actually make my own polygon function polygon uh int n uh six polygon there take that polygon take that designers are processing that's a ninagon okay so now what do I need to do I need to where's that tile holders this tiling um so interesting so it looks like whatever my R is okay I think I understand what this is but I think I'm just going to kind of trial and error it so I'm going to say four and uh let's use a float X so let's have r equal 50. x equals let's try from negative r to X is less than width plus r x plus equal R looks like it was times two I'm just making this up I probably could read what the actual tiling is and then y probably needs to start like I think every other one is going to be slightly offset but that's fine r y is less than a height plus r and then y plus equal and then let's draw a polygon that is sixsided at X comma y with r okay we're getting somewhere so interesting interesting okay I really I need this four so if I'm starting here what I want to see is the first one um okay I think this is kind of like what I want to do whoa um I would like to see a stroke because it'll help me understand what's going on here okay so now I know that like the next one needs to be offset so I really should do this by columns and rows but I'll just do a counter so if counter oh I I also think I need to do the Y on the outside and it might not actually matter but that's going to help me understand so if counter mod 2 is zero then let's offset the row by r and this is this very silly way of doing this but uh let's do this okay oh and now every every time then counter goes up okay so I think this is by the way this is a nice tessellation and yes if I want to see the close of the stroke I should do this um I kind of like my tessellation anyway so haha uh I feel like I've made a nice tessellation even though it's not exactly yeah good enough I agree tessellation everybody moving on something you've always wanted to learn a sign distance functions maybe I should go learn sign distance functions a little bit more what's another thing oh 3js let's try 3js Okay uh hello world3.js uh all right chat GPT should be able to help me out here can you uh give me a blank boilerplate uh 3.js JavaScript example okay excellent excellent okay okay this looks pretty good all right all right so where am I going to put this code oh I guess I'm getting Visual Studio code up uh uh all right code yes where's Visual Studio code did I lose it applications I don't understand Visual Studio code here it is okay um uh I have no idea wait what I didn't even open how could there be changes already okay fine don't save uh save as a new file I forgot how to use a text editor Okay no Okay ah all right fine fine foreign 11 make a directory uh January uh uh 13. why did I say 11 when it's clearly 13. uh uh okay got my HTML file uh uh run a web server okay uh that's good um now let's go back so I get like a boilerplate okay uh oh that's okay uh index.j let's save this as uh index.js um uh uh may I have the HTML file to go along with this please okay so let's take a look oh whoops hey where'd it go copy code okay scene perspective render Cube oh I've got a cube here okay so I'll I'll try to do something a bit more with uh geometry box mesh material Cube okay maybe I'll make an array of cubes and spin them around um very slow this is good I get to take a little this is the only time I get to take a little break I'm halfway through at an hour and 25 minutes I think not halfway through but close to halfway through hour 25 minutes it's pretty good I'm almost done with my coffee foreign I could turn on um noise reduction but I feel like sometimes that um okay uh great is that the most recent 3js version that can't be right but it's fine um okay so now oh I see uh I do not want yeah so why isn't this doing anything here we go okay all right so I've got uh so I have got we're definitely not getting sub two hours I love that I have got something going in 3js so let's play around and make something myself so I'm going to try now let's just make a bunch of these uh uh one one one is just putting it in the scent oh Cube rotation hmm all right let's just try this um let's try making 10 of them and um scene add cubes cubes push Q Where do I do I give it a Translate um can I give everyone a uh uh Cube dot x equals random negative let's just try this I'm gonna add an X and A Y and what aren't I in 3D Okay so this and then if I say Cube all right hold on I don't know like Cube I'm just making up stuff Translate the variables don't need to be there I just was curious uh oh random is not defined okay that's fine no problem um let's try this translate has been removed translate on axis huh okay well what's the axis translate okay set a position of object in 3.js position oh I just give it a position a vector 3 default is zero zero zero how do I make a vector three okay ah okay distance two okay uh that one and then okay position so do I just say Cube position equals a new Vector three oh okay kind of sort of didn't seem to work oh there is a position here oh wait okay position.o no that's the camera uh okay so hold on uh four let cube of Cubes uh link them different sizes I think they're all on top of each other still how do I move them does anybody know position range is too small oh I just assumed everything's mapped between one to one how can I multiply the position how do I multiply a vector um well I'll just do it myself manually I don't know what the range of positions is okay I like this okay I'm pretty sure everything's kind of mapped and yeah all right I like this this is good okay um okay uh um okay a bunch of rotated cubes ah color I I would love to like change the way it looks but all right all right I learned 3js everybody moving on I didn't really learn 3js but maybe I'll add a sine wave into this in a bit moving on okay uh 14th acemic all right I'm gonna have to look at what this is 14 is left to the right almost the way ah unreadable oh this is really interesting oh this is perfect for my um oh like handwriting oh this is awesome okay I got an idea okay um let's go to I have an exit coding challenge that I think will give me the beginning of what I want to do um I would like to get to the coding train page here it is uh not evolutionary all right fine everybody new coding Train website I don't need Google anymore uh steering behaviors this one is what I'm looking for uh okay so let's get rid of the okay so let's duplicate this uh January what am I on 14. let's get rid of the vehicles uh uh let's put this here let's get the points uh let's get rid of that uh let's get rid of that this okay so let's just see here okay what do I got train okay now um oh hi Henry exactly programming from A to Z although now I'm interpreting this as like the handwriting not the actual text itself so what I'd like to do is just say circle like just to see what I've got here Point dot y uh four um and then fill uh 255 no stroke okay and let's get rid of this there we go okay so now to make this unreadable and again shape and shape oh no um vertex uh okay stroke 255. and no fill interesting okay we're getting somewhere now let's use um and it would be really nice to animate this so let's put this in draw what do I got going on oh wait going back and forth between these two environments is definitely going to be a little tricky what did I miss great canvas background those are all extra curly bracket okay um okay so now what I'd like to do is um okay um we're going to for each point we're going to say x offset equals map Point dot x 0 to width to between 0 and 1. and the Y offset is going to be the same zero to height then Z offset is zero which we'll leave right now then I'm going to make an angle which is um noise X offset y offset Z offset times two pi then I want to make a vector from angle a and V Dot uh set magnitude we're just going to make it like 10 pixels right now and then this is going to be plus V Dot X Plus V Dot y I'm just curious what this is going to do okay and now let's try Z offset so these move wiggle around okay um what what error am I getting here P5 reserved function reserved function with where did I use that where am I using like some weird word that I'm not supposed to be using but anyway um let's make this 50. and let's put um background zero here I like how it's smearing but okay this is pretty wild it's not real words okay uh so let's um so let's create I know uh uh well we could be more interesting about how we're picking the text um how did it get why do I have this weird font and size uh 12. why where is it getting oh it's getting it here um I didn't see that there were like arguments here sample Factor okay see ah I gotcha um okay so let's just do this let uh text um okay uh uh let's make some random text okay um zero zero is going to put it up there why is it yelling at me I want somebody to tell me why it's yelling at me what's going on um uh then what I'm going to do is if random 1 is less than uh every about every so many characters uh let's give it a line break and then let's use the text here why is it not giving me a line break I don't really care I guess uh uh 150 okay there we go enjoy my very strange text all right uh this is January 14. moving on sine waves oh look at this let's add a sine wave oh this is beautiful um okay uh so this is January 15. we're gonna make this in a sign into a sine wave um so the angle is actually the mapping hmm okay how do I want to do this I want each letter essentially each point two okay I got it I got it I got it zero to width zero to two pi and this will just be the angle and then uh whoa um now what I want to do is sine of the angle times 50. okay so the text is in a sine wave but um plus Z off uh and maybe the I don't know why this isn't working I can figure that out later and let's change the text now to line wave all right oh wait I see it's this here that that doesn't actually matter up there okay there we go sine wave everybody reflection of a reflection ah we're gonna keep going with this one oh no did I forget to save as no I 15 was sine waves did I do a duplicate I hope I did I don't remember but now I'm doing a duplicate again um so now we're going to do a reflection so oops so let's reflect this by saying height minus foreign it's kind of a reflection but now I want to do a reflection of a reflection so we're going to start with it uh and I have so little room for my code um okay so now we're going to uh uh let's make it a little bit higher oh whoa that's what I meant hold on but uh this this is what I want um I now I want this and then uh what we're gonna do is we're gonna say four let I equals zero I is less than two I plus plus do this twice still why is it still complaining to me about this this is driving me crazy I is being redeclared yeah I don't I know okay that's fine okay okay why do I still have weird errors make sure you have used a P5 reserve two pi yeah I know but I I'm using it I'm not declaring it maybe it's because of this the VAR what is going on okay I'm just gonna have to ignore that by the way this is getting really slow so let's make the sample distance one why is it running so slow all of a sudden is it my computer okay this is going this is going okay okay thank you Depot spending I messed up not saving 14 so we'll have to get back to that um okay take your time I cannot take my time um okay why is this suddenly going so slow I I'm not using a particularly powerful machine here I've got lots of extra text that I don't need okay there we go we're back I've got to figure out what this is it's making me crazy you have used a p5.js reserve variable two five two Pi I know I know I used it on purpose look at that message went away that message came back with what is going on you cannot go on until I figure this out why is it complaining about how I'm using these variables oh oh the nested Lube thank you that is a disaster that must be that must have messed things up but is that really going to mess this up foreign okay I'm gonna have to just let this go and come back to another time and just be fine with those error messages okay sine wave sine wave okay good okay now let's come back to this okay now let's do this twice and then let's say translate n times height divided by two it's commas oh zero okay but now what I want to do is actually reap so and then I need to say scale 1 negative one oh no uh uh sorry uh if n equals one let's just do this for a second okay how can I get the other one below it and reversed I'm feeling okay so I'm translating to there and then oh I see so I really need to translate to the center uh oh no the center should be this and then because oh I see point Y is not I I got it I got it I got it this actually needs to be zero and then what I'm doing here is translating to uh oh I like you know what this looks pretty good I think we got reflection of a reflection there's so much I could do visually to make this more interesting uh it's also just so darn slow um uh and then this one is I really should stop this I know what I'm doing now uh translate 100 plus this there we go and then what did that do now it's going to take it off translating and then I should scale it should flip it but it looks they look identical foreign yeah weird it is working but I don't know why I guess if I flip I don't actually want to flip it it's a way that's a reflection of a reflection okay I'm on a four hour Pace okay reflection of reflection we're good this was number 16. a grid inside of a grid inside of a grid oh this one makes me so happy okay I mean I could just do like a quad tree but somebody has got if somebody could figure out what the hey ho is going on with the error messages in the sketch I would be forever grateful but I'm sorry that you're gonna have to like type in this horrible URL there okay um let's go back to processing okay I know what to do here this one I'm really excited about uh okay by the way it's gotten quite warm in here now so let me go adjust the Heat okay uh uh um okay size 800 by 800. background let's just do this in draw background uh zero and let's also say uh the width is going to be 80. so let's first just draw a grid I have an idea let's do this recursively oh my God this is a little crazy this is such a bad idea uh we're gonna do float X float y float uh W float H and then float R for size okay so it's going to always assume it is a it's going to always assume it's a rectangle so I equals zero uh J equals zero let's use I and J it's a little bit clunky what I'm doing here uh um I mean honestly I could just do this all right no no it's fine it's fine plus equal r I is less than w I is less than h uh so I actually should equal x plus W let's just do the offset let's just do the offset here so now I'm going to say rectangle X Plus i y plus j r r and I'm going to say stroke 255 fill let's just give it like 175. okay and then this is this is January what what day am I on 17. oh yeah January 17. okay um so now if I were to say draw grid from zero zero with height uh with a you know 80 as this should give me a grid awesome this is what I want to see now um for any one of these if random one is less than there's a 10 chance and R is less is greater than one pixel let's just say two pixels I could draw a grid from X like where I am y Plus J and then the width is r and then the actual amount of grid stuff is like just just say r divided by 10. this is nuts is that actually like does this make sense infinite Loop here let's make it like a very low probability no not R is greater than if w you know that's fine W and H are always going to be the same the width and height is the thing that I'm doing and then it's going to be 10 by 10. so let's try this okay maybe I just never got one just see uh oh I'm in draw no Loop is what I meant to do but so it did it a bunch of them let's see update the version of P5 that's what the error is someone's telling me um okay so why why oh why is this not working two let's just say w is greater than uh 80. there okay so this is right this is what I'm attempting to do and apologies for the um I think that can just be oh I see it's just so okay so let's start with 800 by 800. let's start with 200 okay okay there we go this is what I'm looking to do but I don't think my exit condition is working I don't want to do it if the individual size is smaller than eight let's see okay there okay it's working this is what I meant to do uh cool grid within a grid within a grid now I was kind of imagining uh that this would be a little bit more interesting so let's actually start with it should actually be 400 but most of the time the probability should really be based on um okay ah this is what it should be foreign yeah so I'm kind of making a little quad treeesque like thing there we go I like this better now all right I'm sure you can improve this but grade with integrid within a grid moving on definitely not a grid um let's revise this one to be January 18. so how could I do this but have it not be a grid um oh and then okay I love it definitely not a grid art deco that was my fastest one yet all right deck that might be my favorite one uh art deco Art Deco I need some help here I need some inspiration for this um oh dear this is tough let's make the Chrysler Building let's make the Chrysler Building in um black and white not deck oh Am I Wrong oh black and white black and white oh look at this hold on okay so this is black and white let's just adjust this yes I got it everybody to for number 90. the problem is it's already black and white I should have made it maybe I should make it colorful and then that would be the previous one I'll swap them uh okay let's um okay uh uh and um black and white black and white um let's actually do this um yeah this is pretty interesting actually why it's doing it in the a different order than I imagined all right I kind of like this black and white I mean I could start adding grayscale but I kind of love this is the strangest thing I've ever made and yet it's actually nicer than anything good enough done okay Chad's telling me I'm done Art Deco okay we're gonna make the Chrysler Building or something like the Chrysler Building okay so I'm taking this as inspiration let's look at this image okay so this is like Okay so let's go to P5 uh oh something bad is happening from another window but I have no other windows open so I might have to recreate some of these which one is this by the way uh did somebody who has access to the coding train account actually update this that's what it seems like uh let's make a new sketch okay so now we're going to say background zero um let's draw let's do I have an idea okay what if I draw an ellipse that's at zero that's that width divided by 2 comma height that is thin like 50 and is like 300 pixels High and if I were to say stroke 255 no fill you know this should be a rounded rectangle I think that would be better um and then uh rect mode you know what let's Center and let's actually wear a wrecked P5 I always forget how the okay so this which one do I want I think I want like this rounded Corners so I just give it like a radius for the rounding okay so now I need to do a bunch of these for and then let's just say height minus I just times 10. just to start oh where's my auto refresh okay uh uh uh uh okay let's make it ah okay I see so I really need to think about how I'm doing this so the rectangles all should be ah not their location it's their height that I want to change that's actually going to make it much easier uh okay great and then their width should be minus I times five something like this oh pretty good okay moving on uh Art Deco this was sorry what was that that was January 20. Art Deco everyone okay uh Shadows ooh Shadows oh hmm what if I did something with my like Ray casting um that could be interesting or just kind of like negative space uh let's we could use that hexagon again we could make shadows with it I'm I'm kind of like I don't have an idea for this one oh I'm not even on it's Persian rug Persian rug sorry I'm always looking at the bottom of my screen Persian rug oh dear this one's going to be hard um Persian carpet wow wow okay wow uh wow okay so I do have an idea for how to do something that's really it's going to be really a poor facsimile for this like it's but I think we can do uh let's try just drawing stuff out from the center and reflecting it so let's go to P5 uh this is January 21. the heat didn't come on I turned it off I turned it down to low very cold now I can't get the temperature right okay uh I also just if you let me just check my phone to make sure nobody in my family is like the house is on fire anything like that although presumably I would notice okay I'm getting a lot of okay yeah okay okay no no emergency uh so I think everything's good okay what am I on Persian rug okay um Persian rug yeah image processing one that's not a bad idea uh fractal tree reflected that's so Paradise demon that's kind of what I was thinking so I was going to create a just let's just make a vector uh which will start in the center and I'm going to draw a circle at V Dot X V Dot Y and have it be like 20 pixels and let's put background zero and Okay so What if I 4 let I equal zero I is less than 10 I plus plus and this should be zero zero and I need to translate to width divided by 2 height divided by 2. and then I am just going to rotate by 2 pi divided by 10. okay and this should be a number this could also work for reflections so now if I were to just say V Dot X Plus whoops this should I should see this there we go okay this is what I was hoping to see um okay I know stroke a fill 255 10. now let's have it start to I was gonna have a branch so this should actually be uh Dot uh and then um foreign function um and then uh uh so now I need a uh dots is an array uh dots push new DOT and uh for uh every dot uh dot of dots a dot dot update what do I what am I doing wrong here what's dot dot update dots class dot dots push new DOT here at line eight in dot update oh this [Laughter] oh okay excellent why okay great it's going so fast this should be the same oh I don't want to update sorry ah I definitely need no wonder no wonder no wonder show um okay so show um this is a silly way to do it but okay great now um what I want to do is change the way okay so this is the position now uh the direction is uh I don't want to make it random but I guess I could uh let's just do uh P5 dot Vector let's just try random to start and then okay and then this dot d i r rotate uh I don't know I don't know what I'm doing exactly okay so what I'm thinking is thank you um that at any given point to too slow um and let's make this smaller um there could be if let's just try this if random one is less than 01 we're going to say dot stop push new DOT this dot pause so what I mean by that is uh and dot dot length is less than 10 let's just say that for right now okay but it is kind of doing what I wanted it to do but and um the thing is the dot needs to get a uh pause uh if pause this stop pause equals pause dot copy else this dot pause equals else stop pause equals create vector so um so uh now it's way too like perfectly swirly that's not really what I meant for it to do so also this dot rot for rotation equals a random value between negative 0.2 0.02 and this dot rot and I should probably give it some nice color what do we think anything resembling a Persian rug if I think if I gave this color okay I'm just so bad at color uh this dot color equals I need where's that palette didn't I have a palette um okay uh um would you mind giving me an array of strings in JavaScript that are hex codes for Persian rug colors there's no chance this works right [Laughter] oh I got one from Sable Ray but I can't copy paste from the chat is my problem I really have a problem that I'm not set up well to uh do that okay uh uh this dot color equals random from the Persian rug colors uh and then uh Phil is it gonna let me add an alpha to a color this way no that's cruel but we're just gonna have to leave it like this okay it's it's a little too like kaleidoscopy it's snow flaky MB lab says it has a Persian I approve I think I did my best effort um it could definitely be improved it's annoying me that I can't just give it the string plus an alpha um hold on this is gonna this is the worst thing I could ever do but all right I oh you can do color this color set Alpha good point okay I kind of like this it's not a Persian rug at all but I made something moving on Shadows um Shadows this is where I was stuck okay I have an idea let's just adapt this duplicate uh 22. so we're gonna duplicate this we are going to set the color to zero uh how do you do those ternary things random one is less than zero then I can turn it up right here I can never learn something new how about the Syntax for a ternary operator that I can never remember question mark yeah or colon I kind of had it right question mark color zero colon color 255. and now ironically I don't want the uh this dot color and let's do a square and wrecked mode Center all right and oh right oh less than 0.5 it's pretty interesting actually um I I know this is a very loose interpretation of shadow but I quite like this okay but I had a thought of how to make this much better um so let's add something here which is that the dot gets a size I'm just using 24 and this dot r and um so the first dot should be uh uh shoot I've really okay hold on so if it's the first one other uh okay I got it this is very awkward and it absolutely could be confused improve R equals 100 the stud r otherwise this dot R equals r and then what I'm going to do is by the way I that was just so it didn't go completely insane but um and this dot R is less than it's greater than like five pixels because what I'm going to do stop stop stop stop is when I make it I'm going to say uh this dot R times 0.5 so it's going to okay why are they not actually oh the squares are why do the oh because the rotation sometimes so strange I really don't know what I've done here but this is my interpretation of Shadows I like it moving on what whoa moire uh okay uh uh boy this is I I really need to also constrain the length let me just fix this and this dot dots oh dots dot length is less than like 100. it's probably what I should do I don't understand why it makes whatever it makes but I'll take it uh this is pretty not what I expected and yet I really like it okay but I'm moving on the next one okay um what am I on 23 is more moire let's see if it has anything for me so yes okay so I mean uh oh I like this ooh interesting Mare overlapping two sets of concentric circles that looks nice okay let's just go uh okay so 400 400 um no fill no stroke 255 for let I equal zero I is less than a width I plus equals two Circle 200 200 I okay well uh okay uh I know we need an angle okay uh okay and let's do I should really have translated to the center here but what are you going to do oh I don't have the background on I wonder there you go I don't know what this looks like on YouTube um swap black and white I like this idea um um what what did I just do to ruin this oh that's plus eight okay fine okay done this is good kind of some interesting moire stuff uh let's just do this though this will be interesting pleased to be enjoying my moire pattern okay textile didn't I just do Persian rugs it's a textile uh what textile textile textile what do I do for textile hmm I like the idea of like creating this little tube like things I like this I guess to make something very texturey looking is kind of cool my brain is not is starting to melt a little bit oh by the way I forgot to put in the number for this one this was January 23. now uh textile hmm something with pixels like melting pixel neighbories do plaid or textile pattern Vector Fields good idea copy paste Persian rug yeah just don't do weaving okay why not okay how about I like the idea what uh I like the idea of um a flow field so um let's make a flow field oh wait a sec let's make a flow field but with my grid within a grid thing so which one was that oh yeah this moved everything crazy off of the grid so 17 K let's start with this I gotta I got a weird idea here that kind of makes no sense but I'm going to do it anyway um textile 24. okay so in draw grid there is no longer a rectangle rather I am going to draw a line which goes from uh X Plus i y plus J to X plus I plus r y plus J okay uh and we're gonna say stroke 55 no fill let's just say stroke weight uh R uh divided by four just out of curiosity whoa Okay so not exactly what I meant to happen but it's a good start because this is kind of what I was thinking but um let's do r divided by 16. our r divided by 8 because essentially when it's the smallest I want it to be one pixel okay okay so now what I'm thinking is um so I'm going to need to say I'm going to need Loop gonna need to say random seed so it does the same grid within a grid I also want it to be I think more frequent to be perfectly honest it's funny how it's picking the top two twice in a row or did I just really put my thumb on the scale oh cause a random seed that's fine um that's fine but let's just get a different random seed there we go okay perfect okay so this is my textile start uh and now what I'm thinking of doing is changing this to translate X Plus i y plus J whoops not here remember the line is okay so push Matrix pot Matrix translate to X Plus then this is much easier now zero zero to R comma zero this should be exactly the same great and now what I would like to do is um uh let's get an angle float angle equals noise uh uh X oh this is so ridiculous um hold on hold on let's just do um that's fine you know what let's do this uh X offset equals X plus I divided by 100 I'm doing this late the lazy coder's way uh uh uh two pi times that rotate by that angle uh no no no no no no no no no thank you very much the rotate goes there okay uh not the most textiley thing ever but nothing like a little Z offset okay to lead the way uh okay I want to do it hold on don't like the way that I did this translate X plus I plus r divided by two plus r divided by two negative r divided by two r divided by two let's do it this way and stroke weight uh 10 and oh no that's not the stroke weight is uh and stroke 10 and background here all right oh no whoops that's not set up uh wow this grid is really weird here so I don't know why I just didn't do like a regular flow feel because the grid is really kind of making it insane and there's like um so I have a weird idea I have some weird ideas to make this more textiley uh color would certainly help um it's very slow uh hold on sorry I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking I'm thinking um add color and I've got it yeah uh okay um ah come on uh I don't know what I'm doing anymore I really like lost it here all right just stop after a set number of frames I also should do that right or I should do the um all right we got a nice pallet uh is this how you do that in Java all right um I'm gonna have that Alpha again issue um oh I can't put a string in there because I think it'll let me oh what is it gonna like is processing gonna be smart enough to do this I don't think so oh there we go awesome done this is not at all textiles but you could you could keep going with this okay all right we've got to look up this particular artist now I think I need to stop building off of what I did before um let's look at these oh bright polka dots oh amazing Infinity Room oh my God these look incredible oh wow wow okay so I definitely want to use these colors that I just got or like a red and a yellow this is incredible uh um oh my goodness I love this so much I'm never gonna be able to do something as beautiful as this um but let's give it a try um okay let's go to JavaScript I think um and let's um anyone want to give me in the chats um uh colors for this okay um oh you know what I want to use let's go to this coding challenge I really need to work on my Google they really should really should come up with this I think this could be a nice start okay let's let's use this duplicate January uh 25. four o'clock people let's just see so this is the example that I guess I made in that video uh just red blue green orange okay oh Emily says I got to see one of her exhibits in person okay so this is what I want to do maybe this is actually not right but let's give this a try first of all let's update this with the new sp5 it's a good chance for us to whoa okay one point 5.0 still going okay great um I'm just curious here what are some okay great and then K is like 20. what does the K do I don't I I did this whole thing and I made a whole video about it I don't remember maybe this is just too elaborate right now but it is kind of a nice starting point what I want I think I have an idea though uh uh where am I drawing them oh geez I hate not having any room okay okay done no it's that can't be done for that I already made so let's have the colors be um um based on um so okay at the ordered Point uh let's get the distance between point dot X Point dot y and the center uh width divided by 2 height divided by two and um stroke weight r point and then I can say Point dot X Point dot y um whoops where did I go and what I want to do here is say palette equals um ff000 ff0 and what was another um it was another color like I saw uh red yellow let's just do red yellow and black and then um okay so what I'm thinking is uh then float and then uh int no no no let index equals floor d stroke palette index so I want to see like concentric circles uh and what did I miss here object arguments is not a valid color representation what am I missing here palette a stroke okay okay floor of the distance oh oh oh modulo palette dot length huh oh and the the black ones you don't really see um but I bet you you would if I made the background white okay and then oh it doesn't doesn't look good I don't like this and it's not doing what I thought it would do which is give me like nice concentric circles um yeah that there we go this is what I was imagining uh background pink okay oh also well that's doing anything weird but um hold on let's just now if it's bigger it's better so I uh orange instead of yellow I want the sizes to be bigger I want them to change size I probably should do Circle I really should do Circle packing not this I don't know what K does yeah that was a mistake restart please uh can I make R change over time total is 25. R ti times equals 0.99 oh no no no each time you draw sorry oh no now they're just shrinking it's kind of strange I should probably move on uh I should probably move on I think actually this might look nicer not what I intended but kind of interesting done done the German flag now in circles I I have an idea oh it never stops I don't like that I started with this it's good enough okay I kind of like whatever this did just to understand what's going on better oh yeah awful awful okay just give me one more moment to feel better about this one I do not like what I've made but I I really do just need to move on um there okay perfect okay my kid could have made that this kind of works uh um my kid could have made that this is an interesting prompt okay how about um 4 15 January 26th um my kid could have made that I like those colors um I've kind of lost them though um I did a terrible job I feel so I was so excited by that one I think it overwhelmed me okay okay ready I made a little nice drawing program just a random color every time you click the mouse did I do something weird that it only is shades of blue and green it's never oh there we go okay done my kid could have done that because that's how I've taught them how to do that in P5 in the style of Clone okay uh January 27th I'm really getting tired everybody oh these look amazing okay um oh I like this let's do this let's make something that looks like this that is beautiful we can do this okay all right okay uh I will do this in P5 uh let me close a bunch of these windows that I don't need anymore goodbye chat GPT okay so we are going to say background red then our colors are going to be blue all right so then let's make we're gonna I want it to be different each time so what I need is a function that draws two arcs so I'm going to write my own function called arcs which is not Arc and I need I'm not gonna work I just need a size um I need a size and an out a stroke and a fill color I know sorry for my variable names or actually no it's just a fill color so it's just a size and a color so a color one and color two so to do this I need to draw so let's let's just translate to the center and I need to draw one Arc so let's just make it white first one Arc that is zero zero R times two let's just make a diameter because I don't think the r matters here so diameter diameter and then zero zero to Pi it's probably going to be and then another one that is pi to 2 pi uh no stroke and a fill zero let's do um oh and so I really should be color one color two and I'm going to say arcs 100 0 255. Okay so life how lazy am I rotate pi divided by two I could rewrite my code or just do that okay so then this first one the back one should be so now I need to say four let I equal uh uh with divided by 2 uh I is greater than or equal to 24. I let's just say zero I is greater than zero I minus equals 50. let's just see what this does and uh I okay now we're not seeing them because the colors are the same okay uh and um 50 seems kind of arbitrary uh oh well actually so let's uh oh I like how this one it could be so let's just pick from a few different colors so let's make a palette which has uh black White um oh I you know interestingly how this side is oh let's just do that so it's this side is only black or white and Palette one can only be black or white and Palette two can be uh like yellow it's like pink it's like blue like a light blue um blue kind of a yellowish I mean somebody with more talent for color will make a nice version of this it's kind of a nice orangey um okay I'm making up some colors uh uh so arcs random palette one random palette two okay I like this I like this we are done that is oh January 27 Oh my God okay boom generative poetry yeah um oh I have so many examples that make generative poetry so like what should I do right now maybe I should pick one of my I should just give up cut myself some slack here generative poetry coding train um poetry diastic all right let's create something new um let's use an API um so what was it that I was using that was like project Muse or something API this is it okay Muse there's something called The Muse API word dictionary something called like data Muse word yeah maybe this is it yes this is it okay um because I think this is a free easy to use API so um means like sounds like spelled like related word topics uh yeah uh bring the results meaning words related to duck so okay start with okay let's let's see words okay so let's go to P5 new sketch uh January 28th uh uh we are going to ah I have an idea okay this is going to be the generative poetry thing okay great uh let's say okay so first of all give me a second here to say background okay uh okay um we are going to make a canvas and uh and create uh in input equals create input okay and uh why why why why why oh I am that is a reserved word okay um get uh user input poem start poem start okay so poem start Dot what is it changed right poem and then function write poem is going to be an async function and I'm going to say response equals await fetch I'm not going to use low Json because I I really want to just do this with async I think um and so now we're going to go to here um and then um I'm going to say let prompt equals poem start dot no right yeah poem start dot value and so here now we're going to say um whoops prompt um and then this is going to be asleep thank you so much oh come on just to add one you're insane okay then okay uh rainbow okay fine fine fine fine fine fine and I'm gonna not I'm just gonna put rainbow in here now so I don't have to and I'm actually just gonna say right I'll make it work eventually that and am I standing in front of the code too much sorry about that uh okay um I just wanna see if this works oh console.log Json okay great I got a hundred words fry okay yeah so uh okay so now I'm going to next let's call this next word poem start value prompt and then why doesn't this work now oh next word okay so now um I should be able to get any word from a random one so let word equal random Json uh fill 255 and uh uh let x equal random with let y equal random height text uh word X comma y text align Center Center and it's saying object object because it is word.word word dot word okay and uh uh size should be uh like 64 to start okay so now the idea is that I have is that I would then do set time out another async function a weight next word word dot word size uh like 75 percent and then do that like no no one second later uh and then the whole thing should not start foreign poem okay and let's make this 800 by 800 I have so um okay hold on let's make this uh 800 800 by 600 and okay so let's use the word kitten oh rotate them by 90 degrees I like that idea I'm probably gonna go and all right so uh yeah so I like the idea of rotating them thank you uh translate I'm so tired rotate pi divided by 2 times random rotate uh random one let's just say if random one is less than 0.5 rotate pi divided by two draw the text at 0 0. um I don't think the size should go down by very much so now let's try um uh rainbow hit enter what just happened did I ruin it next word prompt.value size get the word text size oh push Matrix is not the function did the rotate mess it up what have I done to destroy this push pop yes okay uh console.log word dot word are we getting something I think the event isn't happening anymore I mean this is a terrible way to display a poem but I'm not sure why my change stopped working oh maybe you actually have to write in it you can't just hit enter and I probably should have a button okay so now okay okay relax relax okay here we go ready generate there we go okay all right everyone this could be vastly improved but it was an interesting exploration of using this API and now we are moving on to maximalism maximalism that's the opposite of minimalism I suppose maximalism oh my God I'm so close to being done ah so close to being done uh maximalism maximalism well this could be maximalist like here's a way of making this maximalist but no let's not do that let's start over Okay let's go to processing oh maximal okay January 29 January 29th okay now we're definitely going to use full screen but maybe not just yet maximalist okay how about I use every possible polygon and every possible color okay I have an idea so where's that polygon function I have I just have to rewrite it because it'll be faster oh there is a polygon function in processing okay polygon processing reference it's an example I don't think there is one there's like a p shape I don't believe that there's a polycon okay I don't believe that there's a pot okay this is going to be maximalist s where's my polygon function let's find it anybody remember what day I did the polygon draw a grid no it was before that wasn't it 12 polygon here it is awesome uh here's my polygon function January 12. okay so void draw four okay we're gonna do every possible polygon uh and I equals one I is less than a 50 a gone no let's go let's just go up to a is it a decagon is that what 10 is um and 4 would be a rectangle so let's No 3 would be a triangle so let's do that 2 would be a line one would be a point okay maximalist uh um oh the I is first okay this is looking good okay I kind of have an idea here four int W equals we'll start with 100 W is greater than we'll go down to 10. we'll go down to zero we'll say w minus equals 20. 10 20. I don't I've kind of lost what I'm doing here then we're going to say for uh x equals zero X is less than W X plus equals w aximalist Y is less than h y plus equal w y is nothing with some height uh and counter equals zero um counter and this is w uh a little grid uh uh counter equals counter plus one modulo 10. do I have too many oh okay this is this is what I was thinking now the polygon function draws it at the center so this should really be offset so if I were just doing let's get rid of this outer loop for a second because this makes no sense no idea what I'm talking about here that didn't work I want to draw a grid of the polygons what is wrong with me and I want to rotate through okay let's make this 10 for a second oh it's the whole oh no no it is doing what I think it's supposed to do it's just ah uh polygon counter plus one counter plus two there at least needs to be two and it should be stroke 255 fill 255 just for right now okay oh wait okay and then it should be half the size okay and then y should be on the Outer Loop I'll evenly divides um okay so we're gonna pick a random one so forget about the counter int random between one and 11. uh uh no no no no this is very weird what I'm doing but it's it's gonna be maximalist you'll see okay uh so if W is a hundred this is going to be maximalist okay great now um what I wanted to do was this okay good good uh uh now the color palette is going to be um okay uh and um um uh how am I going to do the color s tie d t d e x d I have no idea what anybody's talking about in the chat um okay wait wait wait this is gonna be maximalist um okay what's I know color mode HSB uh uh 360. 255 255. okay so this is going to be just out of curiosity let me just check a color okay perfect now it is going to be um counter counter I'm just gonna make it a float for no good reason I mean I could make it random I kind of like the idea of it being in some sort of order though no foreign what have I done um am I doing the biggest ones first okay hold on okay this is what I meant to happen I guess it just covered oh you know what I now I understand what I wanted to do okay I understand what I wanted to do that's maximalist done no no no no no no trust me just give me a second here yes this is what I was looking to do only it's much less than I imagined so let's start with I was thinking of something different but this is close enough okay and now we're gonna just forget about this counter lovely idea let's make it horrifyingly random there we go maximalism just just bear with me just bear with me there we go maximum okay hold on maximalism okay moving on minimalism minimalism okay we're gonna do this one can I get out of here how do I get out of this okay minimalism oh my God I'm so close to being done three hours and 27 minutes okay minimalism no no no no no no no why does that not oh minimalism deliberately break one of your previous images and works and ruin it huh well all right folks which one should I do I got 30 prompts anybody have a have a uh request which one should I break and ruin the No No I have to do 31. I'm not done I'm not done I need to break one of them remove semicolon from your last one I mean I guess I could you know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna write but I try to ruin this one that's a really good idea uh okay I have a really good idea just just hold on okay I know how to ruin this one um so hold on uh columns is with divided by with rows equals height divided by width um hold on I'm just going to do this a different way just trust me I have a really insane idea oh wait wait wait uh it's fine I'm just gonna recreate this but write the code a different way and then I'll I'll move on when I plus e plus plus same exact thing okay that's and now I'm going to ruin this one uh so January 31 I'm gonna make it so annoying to look at um int uh call uh just R1 equals int random calls and R2 and Rose okay uh Translate there we go foreign I have ruined it why no did it not oh because the rotate I made I didn't even like not what I meant to do this is what I meant to do it's it's this one down in the corner it's just off like a couple of things I kind of love this I also think I should say Phil 253. and then stroke uh uh uh stroke weight 0.1 I mean this is now ridiculous now I'm ruining it too much it's making it too obvious but yeah this never mind never mind with that it's gonna ruin the fill slightly going to be like a little bit more noticeable all right I think we're good done three minutes 32 seconds right now three hours three to three hours 32 minutes and 50 seconds I have completed all of January uh all in this one live stream thank you to uh Rafael for you know really for inspiring me with the idea for this I would love to figure out a way to compile all of these I'm sure there's a nice way this stream could be like edited into something I did not record all the feeds separately though so I doubt I will do that but I would like to put everything up uh at that GitHub repo I'm I'm spent um I don't even I don't even know what to say anymore so I'm gonna try to document everything here um I do feel pretty good about this record time I felt like there were some good projects in there actually some seeds of things if anybody wants to take anything I made today and make something out of it I would be so thrilled that you have full permission to just take you know take the the things that I made and put them out into the world with your own creative Twist on them I'm gonna be getting a good night's sleep and I'll be back in here recording um my intro to coding with processing videos tomorrow and that's all I've got to say anybody have any last things they want to say this is it it's the end I don't know like I wish I could like run through them now like a screenshot of each anybody wants to help me compile what I did today into some like quick slide show or something I would totally accept that gonna try to put everything here um here's what I'm gonna do actually let me do this it's gonna need to be reorganized but I mean at least at a minimum do this let me quit processing I actually feel like a little bit dizzy so I think it's gonna be fine though processing January so wait a second are these from last year there might be some from last year shoot um hold on hold on ah I know how to use a computer okay no great these are all from today so let's at least do this so I'm gonna just upload these whatever they might be good luck on your exam tomorrow Lucian I'm going to commit these changes the rest of so here's what I would love and I'll work on this myself I'm not asking any all of you to do like free labor for me but I know people do enjoy contributing so I think I would love to have like a readme that has like a nice grid of images of everything then all of the code nicely organized and numbered so the P5 code should probably be linked to the web editor and um but maybe it makes sense to also include it as separate files I'm not sure but if you go to this URL that should you should be able to see all of the P5 uh sketches so um anybody who wants to help uh with this repo maybe file an issue just to say I'd like to work on this like I'd like to work on the screenshots the readme I'd like to help clean up the the processing code or help to like add the P5 code I'm open to anybody doing that um and um that's it I'm gonna go I'm gonna put on my little song where I say goodbye I don't know why I've just had this forever and if anybody has any questions in the Discord or in the YouTube chat I will let this play out um I feel like I should have a I should make a thumbnail for this video let's which is the most I really like the um definitely not a grid black and white one I think or sh let's look at that January 19th is that processing hold on I'm gonna make like a screenshot that I can use as a thumbnail for this video I hope you learned something or enjoyed this what was it black and white was 19. here we go this is going to be very artificial but let's try it again I don't like what it's giving me all right that's fine okay this is my screenshot there could use that image and completed January all 30 prompts 31. thanks everybody I really appreciate you joining me for this I have to admit I really didn't want to do it I mean I was feeling lazy I want to just sit around on the couch all afternoon I have a lot of work to do back teaching but this was really fun and I feel very accomplished and I've kind of also like was feeling sad that I wasn't doing January so there we go foreign so I'm gonna be here for another 30 seconds three and a half hours is pretty good five o'clock I guess I talked for a half an hour before and then I I I'm wasting some time now back hurts all right everybody that's the end of the song I'll see you next time I live stream uh join the Discord say hi on Twitter uh say hi in the comments all those things love you all see you in the future as always I always forget that this dot this stock this dot this dot this stuff this stuff this stop this stop this stop stop just stop just stop this stop this stop this dots on this stop this dots this dot this stock this stock this is thank you Vista never forget this stuff I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this dot this Dot Song never forget the this Dot somebody compose that song for me
