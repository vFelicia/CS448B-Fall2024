00:01 - hello welcome to part three of my p5
00:04 - Jeff and sound tutorials in this video
00:07 - I'm going to show you how to jump to a
00:10 - particular point of time in a song how
00:12 - to know where you are in the song how to
00:14 - trigger a particular drawing to happen
00:16 - in a particular point in the song all
00:18 - sorts of possibilities dealing with time
00:20 - and a sound file so where I last left
00:23 - off was a simple example where I could
00:25 - play and pause a particular sound file
00:28 - and one of the things I want to do now
00:30 - is add a button I want to add a button
00:32 - here that's called jump where when I
00:34 - press that button I jump to a particular
00:36 - point in time in the video so let me go
00:39 - to code and in this in here I'm gonna
00:43 - show you a bunch of functions so the
00:44 - functions that I'm trying to demonstrate
00:45 - here are jump which allows you to jump
00:48 - to a particular point of time and I said
00:49 - in the video but it's a sound file to
00:51 - song duration which is telling you which
00:54 - is a function that will I don't know
00:55 - telling you I don't know what tells you
00:57 - anything but that function returns a
00:58 - value which is the length of a
01:00 - particular sound file in seconds so the
01:03 - key measurement by the way of time here
01:04 - is seconds so if it's a minute long
01:08 - you're gonna get 60 and you're getting
01:10 - floating-point numbers so it's if it's a
01:12 - minute and half a second long you're
01:14 - gonna get sixty point five so duration
01:16 - is a function that returns the value
01:18 - which is the total duration of a sound
01:20 - file in seconds and current time is a
01:23 - function that returns to the current
01:24 - time where the playback currently is and
01:27 - jump is a function that sets the
01:29 - particular time so if I were to say jump
01:30 - 0 that's like rewinding back to zero
01:33 - there may actually be a rewind function
01:34 - I'm not sure but you could always say
01:35 - jump zero so let's just look at a few of
01:38 - these functions the first thing I'll do
01:40 - is I'm gonna add a button I'll call it
01:42 - jump button and I'll say a jump button
01:45 - equals create button and I'm just gonna
01:48 - say jump and then what I'm gonna do is
01:52 - say jump button dot mousepressed and I'm
01:57 - gonna create a function called jump song
02:01 - you can come up with better names and
02:04 - then I'm gonna write a function called
02:05 - jump song I should mention by the way
02:10 - that everything I'm doing here with
02:11 - these callbacks kind of work
02:13 - because I just have one button and one
02:15 - song and you know I have using global
02:17 - variables to communicate across them at
02:19 - some point someone should remind me to
02:21 - make a video that shows what if I have
02:23 - like 10 different songs and ten
02:24 - different buttons can I reuse the same
02:26 - callback function you also might see
02:28 - this function written directly in there
02:30 - as an anonymous function and I think
02:31 - I've referred to that in another video
02:32 - somewhere but these are some issues that
02:34 - could be coming up in your head but I
02:35 - digress let me get back to the matter at
02:37 - hand
02:38 - which is right here I want to say var
02:42 - I'm gonna just say length equals song
02:45 - duration so what this is going to do is
02:50 - it's going to give me the total duration
02:52 - of the song in seconds and put it here
02:54 - in this variable called le n for length
02:56 - and then what I'm going to say is song
02:59 - jump length divided by 2 so in that
03:05 - sense I am just want to jump to the
03:07 - middle of the song and you know I could
03:10 - look at the mp3 file and figure out how
03:12 - long it is I just picked like you know I
03:14 - I could actually just say junk to jump
03:15 - to 20 seconds let's do that right now
03:17 - really quickly just to see so I'm gonna
03:19 - run this you should see a jump button
03:22 - first thing to play it and then I can
03:24 - jump that work
03:28 - listen closely yeah I'm always jumping
03:35 - to that point by clicking the jump
03:38 - button now I could by the way this might
03:40 - be interesting is to try this let's just
03:43 - jump to a random point in the song right
03:45 - random is going to give me a value
03:47 - between zero and the duration of the
03:48 - song so every time I press this button
03:50 - now let me play it and hold on let's
03:58 - look by the way at I'm gonna make a
04:01 - variable there T equals that random t4
04:05 - time that random point in the song and
04:07 - I'm gonna jump to that the reason why
04:09 - I'm doing that is I want to just look at
04:11 - it see it in the console so now song is
04:14 - loaded I'm gonna play it so that's 28
04:23 - seconds
04:25 - two minutes in I like this part
04:38 - okay whatever oh I think I'm knocking
04:43 - over things down I lost my own the music
04:46 - makes me lost in my own world pause okay
04:50 - so where are we so let me look back at
04:53 - my list over here I'm now talked about
04:55 - jump and duration ah so so okay so there
04:59 - is a function called current time so
05:01 - what if I want something to happen based
05:03 - on a moment of time in the song so
05:06 - current time is always going to give me
05:08 - that moment of time in the song so if I
05:10 - come over here and if I know I just run
05:12 - this I could say song current time I can
05:16 - look at this in the console we're at 5
05:19 - seconds 7 seconds 8 seconds well I love
05:23 - this I love that part of 9 seconds so I
05:25 - could jump to 9 seconds lots of
05:26 - possibilities here but let's say I go
05:30 - back and I add the draw function and
05:34 - what do I want to do in the draw
05:36 - function what I want to say is something
05:38 - like if current if song got and we're
05:43 - gonna have a problem here but let's see
05:45 - let's see if that problem comes up if
05:46 - song current time is greater than 5 then
05:49 - background 255 0 255 so I suddenly want
05:54 - to see a lovely pinkish background as
05:57 - soon as I get past 5 seconds now I'm
06:01 - anticipating perhaps a problem because
06:04 - draw is going to trigger immediately and
06:08 - the song sound file might not be loaded
06:11 - yet and so this might say I can't deal
06:13 - with this because the sound file isn't
06:14 - load gift maybe Peapod yes we'll handle
06:16 - this gracefully behind the scenes I'm
06:18 - not sure let's find out
06:19 - Oh actually there's no problem because
06:23 - I'm not even playing it at the beginning
06:24 - so actually it handle to gracefully
06:27 - behind the scenes so I'm gonna hit play
06:29 - and count one one thousand two one
06:32 - thousand three one thousand so we can
06:37 - see that triggered something to happen
06:38 - at a particular point in the music now
06:42 - here's the thing I'm showing you that
06:45 - just as something that you could use
06:46 - current time as of as a way of knowing
06:50 - where you are in the music but actually
06:52 - there's a better way of doing that with
06:53 - this cueing function so you know it
06:55 - might be more like something that I
06:56 - might use current time for more likely
06:58 - would be something like this like let me
07:02 - actually just whoops let me actually
07:04 - just set the color according to the time
07:06 - in the music that's like a variable
07:08 - that's constantly changing and you can
07:13 - see now as you know as we get closer and
07:17 - closer to 255 seconds do you see the
07:21 - color changing nope this is working
07:27 - demand let's get the code while we're
07:29 - waiting song current time 0 255 that
07:33 - seems like that should work let's see
07:36 - where we are yeah I guess 25 just 25
07:42 - seconds is it very much so just to make
07:46 - this work let me multiply that by 10 and
07:52 - we should see the color changing as the
07:55 - sons play yes yes yes
08:07 - it most definitely is I see a purplish
08:10 - hue coming in okay so highlight off you
08:13 - hopefully you skipped this last like
08:15 - five seconds be rambling because what I
08:16 - really want to show you here ups and I
08:18 - lost I lost what I'm working with here
08:21 - so what I really want to show you here
08:25 - is how to use the add cue function so
08:27 - psalm current time is a variable that
08:29 - gives you where you are currently in the
08:31 - particular piece of music but you can
08:36 - also do something called add cue so that
08:40 - what add cue does is I could say song
08:43 - got add cue and to add a cue I need
08:46 - three things I need well I actually only
08:49 - need two things but optionally I can
08:50 - have a third thing so let's let me start
08:53 - with two things I need the time and
08:55 - seconds where I want the thing to happen
08:58 - and then I need the that I need a
09:02 - function that gets called at that time
09:04 - in seconds so I'm gonna say function add
09:07 - cue five seconds I want to add like a
09:11 - heart or something but I'm just gonna
09:12 - I'm just going to call change but I'm
09:14 - gonna do something really not that
09:15 - interesting I'm gonna make a function
09:18 - call change background and I'm gonna
09:20 - call this function change background and
09:25 - what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make a
09:27 - random background so what I've done here
09:33 - is I've added a cue to that song at five
09:36 - seconds whenever that song is playing
09:38 - back in five seconds call this function
09:40 - change background whoops not ready to
09:45 - play it if I ever press the play button
09:48 - before it's loaded at the moment
09:51 - I got to five second time so you can see
09:57 - so I wonder actually if I jump by the
10:00 - way back to the beginning I'm gonna jump
10:04 - back to the beginning if it'll does it
10:05 - again so at five seconds I have to wait
10:10 - five seconds
10:12 - I got a random back on the jump back to
10:14 - the beginning of the song does that Q
10:17 - occur again at five seconds it does so
10:21 - that Q is permanently in there even if
10:23 - the song is looping and if you ever jump
10:25 - back to previously before that Q now
10:28 - let's let's say that what I want and
10:32 - pause the music let's say that what I
10:34 - want is actually at five seconds to
10:36 - change the background to blue well one
10:41 - of the nice things about the add Q
10:42 - function is it allows you to add a third
10:46 - argument and I'm gonna make a color the
10:48 - color blue and what it does is it takes
10:51 - where of that third argument is and
10:52 - passes it into the callback function so
10:56 - I can make that a variable called like
10:59 - Co L for color and do this so they said
11:02 - let me make this at two seconds just so
11:04 - it happens a little bit more quickly I'm
11:06 - gonna refresh this and I'm now gonna say
11:09 - play and a two seconds you should see a
11:13 - blue background and now I can add
11:15 - another cue with that same callback and
11:19 - four seconds with this color and I can
11:22 - add another cue with white at six
11:26 - seconds and if I run this again oops
11:30 - we've got blue
11:35 - turquoise sir light blue wait jump back
11:40 - to the beginning blue turquoise so
11:47 - anyway if you knew about certain like
11:49 - flourishes and the music where you want
11:52 - to burst the particles to come on the
11:53 - scene or you want to change the way if
11:55 - you're creating music visualizer we're
11:57 - at this point of time the music you want
11:58 - to completely change what it's doing
12:00 - this add cue function will allow you do
12:02 - a lot more than just change the
12:03 - background certainly and in addition to
12:07 - that the cues could be dynamic based on
12:09 - you reading the sound file I mean later
12:11 - I might actually look at beat detection
12:13 - so you could have something happen like
12:14 - with the beat but if you pre knew the
12:16 - sort of tempo and knew the moments of
12:18 - time of the beat in advance you could
12:20 - create all sorts of interesting things
12:22 - to happen in fact you could listen to a
12:23 - song and kind of play along with it on
12:25 - the keyboard and save time codes and
12:27 - then load that is like a JSON data file
12:30 - and have all those time codes trigger
12:32 - certain things to happen with a certain
12:33 - piece of planet there's lots of
12:34 - possibilities of here what you could do
12:35 - with sort of cueing and jumping along
12:37 - with a piece of music so I hope you
12:39 - enjoyed that and learned a little bit
12:40 - about time in a sound file and I'm not
12:43 - sure what I'm doing in the next video
12:44 - but there's gonna be a whole lot more
12:45 - stuff about sound in p5.js
12:48 - to come thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to part three of my p5 Jeff and sound tutorials in this video I'm going to show you how to jump to a particular point of time in a song how to know where you are in the song how to trigger a particular drawing to happen in a particular point in the song all sorts of possibilities dealing with time and a sound file so where I last left off was a simple example where I could play and pause a particular sound file and one of the things I want to do now is add a button I want to add a button here that's called jump where when I press that button I jump to a particular point in time in the video so let me go to code and in this in here I'm gonna show you a bunch of functions so the functions that I'm trying to demonstrate here are jump which allows you to jump to a particular point of time and I said in the video but it's a sound file to song duration which is telling you which is a function that will I don't know telling you I don't know what tells you anything but that function returns a value which is the length of a particular sound file in seconds so the key measurement by the way of time here is seconds so if it's a minute long you're gonna get 60 and you're getting floatingpoint numbers so it's if it's a minute and half a second long you're gonna get sixty point five so duration is a function that returns the value which is the total duration of a sound file in seconds and current time is a function that returns to the current time where the playback currently is and jump is a function that sets the particular time so if I were to say jump 0 that's like rewinding back to zero there may actually be a rewind function I'm not sure but you could always say jump zero so let's just look at a few of these functions the first thing I'll do is I'm gonna add a button I'll call it jump button and I'll say a jump button equals create button and I'm just gonna say jump and then what I'm gonna do is say jump button dot mousepressed and I'm gonna create a function called jump song you can come up with better names and then I'm gonna write a function called jump song I should mention by the way that everything I'm doing here with these callbacks kind of work because I just have one button and one song and you know I have using global variables to communicate across them at some point someone should remind me to make a video that shows what if I have like 10 different songs and ten different buttons can I reuse the same callback function you also might see this function written directly in there as an anonymous function and I think I've referred to that in another video somewhere but these are some issues that could be coming up in your head but I digress let me get back to the matter at hand which is right here I want to say var I'm gonna just say length equals song duration so what this is going to do is it's going to give me the total duration of the song in seconds and put it here in this variable called le n for length and then what I'm going to say is song jump length divided by 2 so in that sense I am just want to jump to the middle of the song and you know I could look at the mp3 file and figure out how long it is I just picked like you know I I could actually just say junk to jump to 20 seconds let's do that right now really quickly just to see so I'm gonna run this you should see a jump button first thing to play it and then I can jump that work listen closely yeah I'm always jumping to that point by clicking the jump button now I could by the way this might be interesting is to try this let's just jump to a random point in the song right random is going to give me a value between zero and the duration of the song so every time I press this button now let me play it and hold on let's look by the way at I'm gonna make a variable there T equals that random t4 time that random point in the song and I'm gonna jump to that the reason why I'm doing that is I want to just look at it see it in the console so now song is loaded I'm gonna play it so that's 28 seconds two minutes in I like this part okay whatever oh I think I'm knocking over things down I lost my own the music makes me lost in my own world pause okay so where are we so let me look back at my list over here I'm now talked about jump and duration ah so so okay so there is a function called current time so what if I want something to happen based on a moment of time in the song so current time is always going to give me that moment of time in the song so if I come over here and if I know I just run this I could say song current time I can look at this in the console we're at 5 seconds 7 seconds 8 seconds well I love this I love that part of 9 seconds so I could jump to 9 seconds lots of possibilities here but let's say I go back and I add the draw function and what do I want to do in the draw function what I want to say is something like if current if song got and we're gonna have a problem here but let's see let's see if that problem comes up if song current time is greater than 5 then background 255 0 255 so I suddenly want to see a lovely pinkish background as soon as I get past 5 seconds now I'm anticipating perhaps a problem because draw is going to trigger immediately and the song sound file might not be loaded yet and so this might say I can't deal with this because the sound file isn't load gift maybe Peapod yes we'll handle this gracefully behind the scenes I'm not sure let's find out Oh actually there's no problem because I'm not even playing it at the beginning so actually it handle to gracefully behind the scenes so I'm gonna hit play and count one one thousand two one thousand three one thousand so we can see that triggered something to happen at a particular point in the music now here's the thing I'm showing you that just as something that you could use current time as of as a way of knowing where you are in the music but actually there's a better way of doing that with this cueing function so you know it might be more like something that I might use current time for more likely would be something like this like let me actually just whoops let me actually just set the color according to the time in the music that's like a variable that's constantly changing and you can see now as you know as we get closer and closer to 255 seconds do you see the color changing nope this is working demand let's get the code while we're waiting song current time 0 255 that seems like that should work let's see where we are yeah I guess 25 just 25 seconds is it very much so just to make this work let me multiply that by 10 and we should see the color changing as the sons play yes yes yes it most definitely is I see a purplish hue coming in okay so highlight off you hopefully you skipped this last like five seconds be rambling because what I really want to show you here ups and I lost I lost what I'm working with here so what I really want to show you here is how to use the add cue function so psalm current time is a variable that gives you where you are currently in the particular piece of music but you can also do something called add cue so that what add cue does is I could say song got add cue and to add a cue I need three things I need well I actually only need two things but optionally I can have a third thing so let's let me start with two

so I wonder actually if I jump by the way back to the beginning I'm gonna jump back to the beginning if it'll does it again so at five seconds I have to wait five seconds I got a random back on the jump back to the beginning of the song does that Q occur again at five seconds it does so that Q is permanently in there even if the song is looping and if you ever jump back to previously before that Q now let's let's say that what I want and pause the music let's say that what I want is actually at five seconds to change the background to blue well one of the nice things about the add Q function

two seconds you should see a blue background and now I can add another cue with that same callback and four seconds with this color and I can add another cue with white at six seconds and if I run this again oops we've got blue turquoise sir light blue wait jump back to the beginning blue turquoise so anyway if you knew about certain like flourishes and the music where you want to burst the particles to come on the scene or you want to change the way if you're creating music visualizer we're at this point of time the music you want to completely change what it's doing this add cue function will allow you do a lot more than just change the background certainly and in addition to that the cues could be dynamic based on you reading the sound file I mean later I might actually look
