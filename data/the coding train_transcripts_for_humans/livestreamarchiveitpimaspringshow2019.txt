With timestamps:

00:05 - we started ok let me just see my
00:08 - recording this hello everyone I'm
00:09 - live-streaming apparently from the
00:13 - interactive media arts program and ITP
00:15 - at New York University's Tisch School of
00:17 - the Arts so my name is dan you're
00:19 - watching the coding train which is this
00:21 - YouTube channel I feel very awkward
00:22 - embarrassing right now I want to just
00:25 - get a couple of logistic things out of
00:26 - the way this microphone is not actually
00:29 - doing anything it is recording audio as
00:32 - like backup audio but there is a new mic
00:34 - attached to the phone that we're
00:35 - live-streaming and so hopefully you can
00:38 - hear me people can hear me yeah ok great
00:41 - so just hopefully let us know in the
00:43 - chat how the audio is oh look at the
00:47 - camera oh I'm looking at the mic yes
00:49 - lettuce thank you let us know in the
00:53 - chat if how the audio is doing hopefully
00:55 - it's going to be better this year than
00:56 - any other year before so this is what
00:58 - you're tuning into there are two
01:01 - programs here there's an undergraduate
01:02 - program called ima interactive media
01:04 - arts there's a graduate program called
01:06 - ITP interactive telecommunications
01:08 - program is a two-year master's program
01:10 - both of these programs are at Tisch
01:12 - School of the Arts which is this
01:13 - building 721 Broadway in Manhattan in
01:17 - New York City and then a part of New
01:20 - York University so this is the end of
01:22 - semester show of all the students work
01:24 - there probably over a hundred projects I
01:26 - don't know how many we'll get to we've
01:27 - gotten to like 30-plus projects before
01:30 - go for an hour or two or two we all into
01:33 - the steam I'm dead Adie who's behind the
01:36 - camera and be true here is helping
01:38 - monitor
01:40 - and so I'm just gonna wander around and
01:43 - show you projects what else do I want to
01:46 - say anything important I think that's
01:49 - good
01:54 - and then at some point I'll also
01:56 - probably try to make an edited
01:58 - compilation video of just the highlight
02:00 - some of the projects alright so let's
02:03 - move
02:04 - hey Kenny how's it going over there you
02:06 - want to be our first project okay so
02:09 - we're gonna come on over here so um tell
02:15 - us your game and a few seconds about
02:17 - your project then we'll get some kind of
02:18 - [Music]
02:24 - you know that you can play in the
02:27 - browser like several ways dad was pretty
02:35 - vicious no uses facial recognition too
02:41 - [Music]
02:47 - and then the other way of putting it is
02:49 - here the touchscreen
02:59 - [Music]
03:06 - I'm familiar with the bumpier maybe tell
03:10 - us a little about the origins mister the
03:13 - thumb piano
03:13 - I just been I'm interested in the thumb
03:21 - piano as the shapes are like meeting the
03:31 - calabash which is round because this is
03:36 - like a modern version
03:39 - you know which is like a square glass
03:40 - you know with a resonator in the middle
03:42 - I made it actually for people with
03:45 - finger muscles or like an adaptive twin
03:55 - browser we're not having to worry about
03:57 -  the notes you know with p5 for
04:07 - now there's no requirement to use b5
04:11 - Jesse relieving to use p5 to do it
04:19 - because you know it gives you all the
04:20 - tools instant like it's an ml 5 pho this
04:30 - [Music]
04:34 - okay
04:36 - [Music]
04:45 - we try this project here can you tell us
04:48 - about it tell us their names
04:54 - [Music]
05:06 - [Music]
05:22 - [Music]
05:29 - [Music]
05:33 - created okay so that's the next person
05:38 - won't necessarily get that compliment
05:39 - look at a random one but that one is
05:41 - just I love the idea of just like a
05:50 - database yeah okay yeah we'll just tell
06:04 - people to talk louder so that doesn't
06:05 - surprise me they we we have we've never
06:07 - had like a great audio at least I'm
06:10 - capturing this audio and we'll be able
06:12 - to put stuff together afterwards but
06:14 - thank you so for the first time ever
06:24 - perhaps oh I remember something I want
06:26 - to talk about the first time ever but
06:29 - it's been a little while but now this
06:33 - year at the ITV show there is a
06:35 - performance room and this is actually
06:36 - the performance schedule so at 4:26 p.m.
06:39 - Matt Ross will be performing pillow talk
06:41 - oh there's an introduction before that
06:44 - Emma will be producing complication of
06:47 - the computer mouse at 4:54 p.m. can you
06:49 - tell us what that's enough yes sure
06:53 - a lecture based on about six months of
06:57 - research on the computer house as an
06:58 - object also talking about how gender is
07:01 - an active
07:04 - through the materiality of yeah don't
07:07 - worry about speaking up into business
07:08 - it's this mic that's actually picking
07:10 - you up
07:14 - cool great well we're gonna try to sneak
07:17 - in to catch some the performances that
07:18 - would be great we're gonna be right on
07:19 - time okay okay great
07:22 - all right all right you do you want to
07:28 - tell us quickly about your projects I
07:30 - just tell us your name and if you worry
07:32 - about what we're seeing here my name is
07:34 - Michael bloom my name is Michael Blum
07:37 - and this is a platform to help educate
07:40 - users about some of the recent advances
07:43 - in natural language generating
07:44 - technology which are are basically you
07:46 - can consider algorithms that are capable
07:48 - of generating text similar to what you
07:51 - or I would would write and I think it's
07:54 - important to sort of learn more about
07:55 - them and know more about them
07:57 - because not only would be better able to
08:01 - sort of harness these technologies were
08:03 - creative ends but also just be more
08:06 - conscious of some of the sort of
08:09 - not-so-great things about them I mean
08:11 - there's a lot of issues surrounding bias
08:13 - and misuse so those are some things that
08:16 - I'd like to sort of shine some light on
08:17 - maybe we'll find this online if they're
08:19 - looking for it it is not currently
08:26 - I'm playing okay great well we're gonna
08:29 - include links in the video's description
08:30 - to all the different projects so
08:31 - hopefully if this goes online people
08:33 - will find it through there great kid
08:35 - awesome okay let's come check this out
08:37 - yeah - so you can Jeana and this is
08:44 - p5.js shaders I worked on with my
08:47 - partner Lisa LSL and it's essentially a
08:50 - collection of examples of shaders in p5
08:54 - that are basically and a guide to
08:58 - basically show people what they can do
08:59 - with Jada's and p5 why they want to use
09:02 - stairs and p5 versus your load pixel
09:04 - function webcam and haven't been running
09:17 - in my browser it's not slowing down
09:20 - they're very perform it just might let
09:22 - me a since I want to use them here's the
09:26 - documentation case
09:29 - go through the why the what the how and
09:32 - like this is just like some kittens with
09:35 - using load pixels to increase the
09:37 - brightness depending on distance mounted
09:40 - using shaders and weight faster you just
09:45 - switched from low pixel shader by
09:47 - clicking that button yeah oh wow so what
09:50 - would you say if people are they maybe
09:52 - they know a little p5 they know a little
09:53 -  but have never done any change
09:55 - before the idea of shaders completely
09:56 - dude yeah well how where would you
09:58 - suggest that they get started is this a
09:59 - place where they could get started with
10:01 - yeah you can definitely get started here
10:03 - we go through what shaders on how to get
10:07 - them set up and peopIe and even I like
10:10 - some explanation about what's actually
10:12 - going on in the background
10:15 - yeah it's if you want to and even how to
10:19 - use this resource with other resources
10:21 - like book of shaders right and this is
10:26 - the URL up there yeah also bitly /p
10:30 - fighters okay so that's a bit ly /p v
10:33 - shaders
10:37 - cool maybe I get that requested a lot
10:39 - yeah pearls are shaders and I have never
10:41 - done that so this will be helpful great
10:44 - thank you
10:44 - great ok coming this way hey you want to
10:49 - join us in a little while in a little
10:50 - while yeah we're gonna maybe take a
10:53 - little break from me and have a Spanish
10:55 - language version of the live stream okay
10:58 - let's come let's stop here talk about
10:59 - the feedback mer no you tell us your
11:01 - name and a little bit about your
11:03 - [Music]
11:05 - processing it's using using the letter
11:08 - AI to visualize the camera image but
11:11 - it's also measuring the overall image to
11:14 - create some sort of feedback ice
11:16 - adjustable
11:18 - [Music]
11:35 - [Music]
11:44 - so when you started now I can understand
11:47 - what's going on much more now so this is
11:50 - very clear to me I see the one-to-one
11:51 - relationship between pixel um kind of
11:53 - angle of this line when you started that
11:55 - had this almost like swirling fluid like
11:58 - quality to it what what's that a factor
12:15 - they stock so that's off right now
12:22 - because it depends on the value you call
12:40 - in set up so even if you change it
12:43 - afterwards
12:43 - it just stays that way so these are
12:46 - exact same two things but this one is
12:49 - and it is 3d effects outside so under
12:52 - strong language
12:53 - it's a very unique you know seen lots of
12:57 - variations of this kind of idea but this
12:58 - idea of having this extra feedback angle
13:01 - it's very unique and creates beautiful
13:02 - effects okay this is the crater creator
13:12 - super fun game
13:16 - pick up Billy's bread you tell us your
13:19 - name and a little bit about your project
13:20 - sure my name's Billy Bennett and I have
13:23 - a c5 sketch with some particles which he
13:26 - may recognize in the nature of code see
13:30 - yeah I I rigged up this musical wand to
13:34 - play music as you swing it across
13:39 - [Music]
13:48 - [Music]
13:54 - [Music]
14:08 - in a way that surprised you or they
14:10 - weren't expecting um all right you'll
14:12 - see a lot of waiting around it's mostly
14:14 - a lot of waving around and confusion
14:16 - they're like what do I do
14:17 - but once they kind of get to the left
14:19 - and right motion yeah I really love the
14:26 - way instigating these moments of the
14:28 - ball popping up it's very like really
14:31 - cool thanks
14:36 - okay I know this might be hard to
14:40 - explain in this context well let's give
14:42 - it a try
14:43 - sure so will you tell us your name and a
14:44 - little bit about your project sure my
14:46 - name is Dan ovett and this is my thesis
14:48 - that I can either self-driving in it
14:50 - it's about what does the future feel
14:53 - like when our device sir making
14:54 - decisions for us some that are very
14:56 - uncomfortable so yeah don't worry about
15:00 - this microphone okay so making when a
15:02 - future where the devices are making
15:03 - decisions for us that might make you
15:04 - know make us uncomfortable so I made a
15:07 - artificial intelligent device that makes
15:09 - me do what's very uncomfortable which is
15:11 - talking to strangers and the way it
15:13 - works is it when it identifies people it
15:16 - I don't you can see here at the camera
15:18 - so there's like it's identifying people
15:20 - using a quarrel which is a machine
15:22 - learning piece of hardware it gives me
15:25 - an instruction and then I basically went
15:29 - around parks in New York and Subway's
15:33 - talking to strangers and here's
15:35 - documentation video
15:38 - and yeah it's it's a better experience
15:42 - with sound off but you can check out my
15:43 - website and see like the nice
15:44 - documentation video but yeah it was a
15:47 - great project I spoke to a lot of people
15:50 - and then found bent boundaries I never
15:53 - thought would have existed yeah and can
15:56 - you talk about so for someone who might
15:58 - be familiar with a little bit with
15:59 - machine learning yet maybe has done some
16:01 - stuff like on just either javascript in
16:05 - the browser or using tentacle on Python
16:07 - what's what do they need to know or
16:08 - figure out to get it to run on a
16:09 - Raspberry Pi like you've done here sure
16:11 - so this this Raspberry Pi is using
16:14 - what's called a coral edge GPU
16:15 - accelerator which can do machine
16:17 - learning locally without you know
16:19 - sending indicative internet and
16:20 - basically the API is super simple you
16:22 - just send this thing an image and then
16:25 - it'll give you back detection boxes
16:28 - boxes where it estimates a person is or
16:32 - a chair or a cup and you actually don't
16:36 - need to really know that much about
16:36 - machine learning to use this because
16:38 - it's a few key lines of Python code
16:40 - where all that stuff is extracted away
16:42 - and it's using a preach what's called a
16:44 - pre Turing machine learning model which
16:46 - has been trained to recognize about 70
16:48 - objects whether Yolo models mobile not
16:51 - mobile net okay it's mobile yeah but at
16:53 - some research that's something I didn't
16:55 - get to finish for this would be was
16:56 - being able to trade custom models to
16:58 - recognize specific objects but I want to
17:00 - work on that on the summer so that
17:02 - people could basically create any kind
17:03 - of detection model and then upload it to
17:06 - the gross they can create a machine on
17:08 - your device that's best for that's
17:09 - what's best for them
17:11 - custom personalized myself yeah great
17:13 - job yeah I just have you changed your
17:15 - behavior now when you're not using this
17:16 - yeah I mean I start start asking liquor
17:19 - he says today go and get like really
17:21 - nice responses that I would've never I
17:23 - mean I don't really to be honest like
17:25 - it's just made me understand new things
17:27 - about people yeah and I don't really use
17:28 - it that much anymore but it's just to
17:30 - change my perception and yeah yeah just
17:34 - a more more aware people on the street
17:38 - yeah
17:40 - [Music]
17:48 - so tell us a little bit about what you
17:51 - made and I worked on a project where I
17:56 - looked for people in the Library of
17:58 - Congress who are featured in The New
18:02 - York Times is overlooked obituary
18:03 - feature so I put together a day to say
18:09 - the 16 people who are about half the
18:11 - people who have been recently given
18:13 - obituaries only for the first time so
18:16 - some people you might be surprised and
18:18 - they didn't receive it on
18:19 - time to die so I decided to ask like in
18:23 - another institution
18:24 - have they been overlooked it there as
18:26 - well so I asked some questions put
18:29 - together some data by like searching the
18:31 - online collections of the Library of
18:33 - Congress and use that to kind of power
18:35 - the interaction here so the questions
18:39 - down here correspond to the buttons that
18:41 - you can press to find out like are they
18:44 - in the library promise at all do they
18:47 - have a name authority file do they have
18:50 - a subject heading
18:51 - [Music]
18:52 - and you can see that you like to start
18:54 - to fade away kind of representing how
18:56 - they might define what it's like today
19:06 - and then I started become extensions
19:09 - which is on my laptop over there
19:15 - [Music]
19:17 - playful an exhibit of someone and then
19:21 - I'm interested in like collaborating and
19:22 - like working on the dataset with others
19:24 - I know can you tell us a little bit
19:28 - about the class because this class was a
19:29 - collaboration with the Library of
19:31 - Congress and did you get what feedback
19:32 - did you get from them and what was it
19:34 - how did that process work yeah so some
19:38 - of us I think you were in a class taught
19:40 - by Jared or old artists in the archives
19:43 - and he was an innovator in residence at
19:46 - the Library of Congress for the last
19:47 - year
19:47 - so through Jer like this group of
19:49 - students got to build projects on top of
19:52 - the collections
19:55 - like the help and feedback I got was
19:57 - really great
19:57 - so like through that class I got to talk
19:59 - with bank Metcalfe who is a recommending
20:01 - officer at the library for like gender
20:04 - and sexuality so it was great to get her
20:07 - take on like how our items in the
20:11 - library like decoded with data and how
20:14 - are they find a bowl from her
20:15 - perspective and me even got to go on a
20:17 - field trip to the library which was
20:18 - super fun so we got to see a lot of
20:20 - things in the Library of Congress is an
20:22 - amazing place you can visit you should
20:24 - visit anybody can just go in there you
20:26 - get a library card you can check out
20:28 - stuff nobody's there anymore compared to
20:30 - used to be that researchers would have
20:32 - to make their Bogalusa Library of
20:34 - Congress find information to their
20:36 - research but now there's so much beauty
20:38 - and wonder there
20:39 - now it's really cool and you can still
20:42 - go down to the floor and see the card
20:46 - catalyst it still experience what it
20:48 - would be like to find things
20:50 - awesome great job okay
20:55 - okay oh we've got VR projects you can't
20:58 - really test VR project but you could
21:00 - give us the ones version of what is
21:04 - Island and it is actually based on my
21:07 - the memory the travel memory helped my
21:09 - grandma so basically in their VR sees
21:11 - the user will be welcoming a wood house
21:13 - you will be creating by my grandma and
21:15 - then she asks you do you want her grab
21:17 - her for me have you say yes and then you
21:20 - will have to finish two tasks so this is
21:22 - kind of be a game as well
21:23 - the first status you would feed the
21:25 - chicken so the chicken is aware you feed
21:27 - the chickens you become into edit this
21:29 - is your first tag and the second tax
21:31 - will be you help my grandma to pick up
21:32 - the badges in order to have the
21:34 - breakfast so this will be a very
21:36 - interactive VR games not just sitting
21:38 - there you have to like you know okay so
21:48 - tell us your name and a little bit your
21:49 - project is a lot of stuff to look at
21:51 - here so maybe we can just have you
21:52 - explain it for a little bit and then we
21:54 - can kind of have the camera walk around
21:55 - and speak loud into that microphone so
22:01 - my name is Yao and this is my business
22:04 - project for life in a nutshell there is
22:07 - two parts the first part is a series of
22:09 - sculptures they have 13 from birds with
22:13 - that as
22:15 - and the second part is an interactive
22:17 - installation people can interact with it
22:20 - and they need to make a post exactly
22:22 - like what the sculpture shows and then
22:25 - they will become part of the character
22:26 - to experience different stages of life
22:29 - did you throughout the process of making
22:32 - this was there because you were there
22:34 - new discoveries that you found about how
22:36 - the history of these characters and what
22:38 - they mean and how they out and you have
22:40 - a juicer sense of them as you use them
22:42 - in daily life by doing this project I
22:47 - was also very inspired by this project I
22:50 - made so they are actually deriving from
22:52 - the ancient Chinese character called
22:54 - Oracle bone script the Oracle bone
22:56 - script were considered as the first
22:58 - fully functional and mature Chinese
23:00 - written language so from a lot of the
23:04 - discoveries and findings from scholars
23:06 - we found that since they were pictogram
23:09 - and based on the findings also my design
23:12 - I put human character in each of this
23:14 - Chinese written character some of them
23:17 - has one human being but most some of
23:20 - them have two human being so as you can
23:22 - see here so for example this character
23:25 - this means first it means that the first
23:28 - sprout freaked out from the ground and
23:31 - that means first and for the other
23:34 - character
23:35 - like home it means that two people they
23:39 - hug each other's under under this small
23:42 - roof and then it means home and for
23:44 - example sky you can see that from Asian
23:48 - peoples I actually sky is very small sky
23:51 - just a little difficult little squares
23:53 - so that's all our imagination about the
23:56 - world about sky and also the cards and
24:01 - happiness happiness is so simple it's
24:04 - just like playing and dancing to music
24:06 - like an instrument things happiness and
24:09 - here is love it means two people holding
24:13 - hands with each other and love forms and
24:16 - here our hometown hometown nice to
24:19 - people having meal with each other and
24:21 - they will chat and they will change and
24:25 - then share their memories about their
24:27 - hometown their native place and here are
24:30 - that that is like one people one people
24:34 - gone one who is God and the other people
24:38 - who still alive and those people who
24:40 - still alive groups for the people who
24:42 - already gone so it means that in Chinese
24:45 - characters
24:47 - documentation footage of your
24:49 - installation it's really remarkable
24:51 - effect of characters and the particles
24:57 - going back forth between the human form
25:00 - in the character form easily
25:06 - [Music]
25:20 - all right we're gonna try to interact
25:21 - with this project click on the backpack
25:28 - [Music]
25:39 - like a very rare sight at iGPS a Windows
25:42 - computer never see that here
25:46 - [Music]
25:58 - [Music]
26:52 - [Music]
27:02 - [Music]
27:12 - how many stages where they're all
27:13 - together
27:15 - [Music]
27:19 - and if people want to see I don't want
27:21 - to see all the different stages you have
27:23 - this the video documentation online
27:25 - somewhere you tell us where it is people
27:27 - get fired
27:29 - [Music]
27:31 - yeah
27:33 - [Music]
27:39 - [Music]
27:41 - beautiful work it's it's really magical
27:44 - to have it simply recognize your phone
27:46 - and for the
27:50 - [Music]
27:53 - how you easy to break
28:03 - backpack pretended
28:06 - I got that affect on computer I can walk
28:13 - I can also now wave and I'm pleased that
28:15 - can I work it's kind of hard to show
28:22 - anyo this would be our brother okay so
28:26 - yeah give us your tell us your name in a
28:28 - short explanation of your thank you for
28:34 - visiting the Museum of Technology
28:36 - history today we have a really exciting
28:38 - exhibit
28:40 - it's a rare artifact in the early 21st
28:42 - century as you all know
28:49 - Automation
28:52 - what a lot of people started through the
28:56 - underground weeding experiences starting
28:57 - to be created and people made these
29:00 - virtual waiting speakeasies so in this
29:04 - the yards of it even you start in our
29:06 - virtual museum and then you can go down
29:11 - a hallway into one of these historic
29:13 - waiting awesome cool and as anybody's we
29:19 - actually this may surprise you or
29:22 - yeah it's really really it's been a good
29:26 - Congress
29:31 - it's been great
29:34 - big job all right countries countries
29:41 - [Music]
29:45 - now let's sit here it looks cool
29:53 - okay let's
29:55 - all right thank you guys you guys are
29:58 - together you polish your games you have
30:01 - to keep up so did this microphone to
30:03 - [Music]
30:04 - speak up and touch your native village
30:07 - my name is Tony Capraro I'm Adrian
30:10 - Batista TV one and we still have two
30:14 - other group research which is Karen do
30:17 - and it's
30:18 - [Music]
30:19 - yeah are you ready to start yes yeah
30:22 - sure no process here we like that you
30:25 - can tell that's accepted well what
30:26 - you're gonna be doing to be joining the
30:28 - CRISPR detective unit today your goal is
30:31 - to find members of the metastasis mafia
30:33 - these are the genes that cause cancer
30:35 - cells to metastasize and spread
30:36 - throughout the body so obviously we want
30:38 - to be able to identify those and we'll
30:41 - give you just a couple seconds to review
30:43 - the evidence board to get an overview
30:44 - about DNA and genes a little refresher
30:47 - but I guess
30:48 - well people online somehow participate
30:50 - in the chat can like solve the mystery
30:54 - whoa what we're gonna need to play a
30:57 - game so we need two players is there
31:00 - anybody who could play it with like Dan
31:02 - with you like Veronica would you like to
31:04 - be welcome to your first mission this is
31:10 - the pre-christian era where genetic
31:12 - research was a little bit cumbersome not
31:13 - always accurate now it's the most
31:14 - efficient so to illustrate that point
31:17 - you're gonna be doing here is using your
31:18 - sense of touch gonna be trying to find
31:20 - the bad kid the ones that cause
31:21 - metastasis they have an etching okay so
31:24 - the genetic civilians the ones that no
31:26 - effect on metastasis are gonna be smooth
31:28 - so put your hand in the jar when you
31:30 - find metastases mafia gene member will
31:33 - pull it out and you'll go back in for
31:34 - more and get 30 seconds
31:36 - right it's my left hand sure we're good
31:38 - disadvantage or both are you ready okay
31:40 - ready as you can see it's a little
31:48 - cumbersome it's a little frustrating and
31:49 - editing day was like
31:55 - [Music]
32:19 - the little scrap give you see does that
32:22 - what you can do now is enter the modern
32:25 - era where people like you identify and
32:50 - then a DNA sequence is faster and
32:52 - cheaper than ever before
32:55 - Christopher makes it possible to eat a
32:57 - thousand genes at once and evaluations
33:00 - it becomes an experience of members of
33:02 - the metastasis amount
33:04 - Chris Berg has opened up over to new
33:06 - research opportunities for scientists in
33:08 - genetics detectives can help save our
33:11 - genetic Police Department's a lot of
33:13 - time
33:16 - we're still searching for members on
33:18 - metastasis mafia many as you can
33:23 - detective each fingerprint to me tape
33:27 - with Christopher and the machine
33:40 - but if one oh and so okay
33:43 - and what if I find one what do I do it
33:45 - you put it okay
33:53 - [Music]
34:14 - [Music]
34:22 - [Music]
34:39 - if you get goal was to try to simplify
34:42 - how crisper what use use now and how to
34:46 - technology was before to make the user
34:48 - feel like frustratedly was like really
34:50 - slow and we did money if I faster and
34:54 - it's like more like what's what's the
34:56 - best anyone's done with maximum I wanted
35:02 - to make it we started with just one we
35:04 - realize what's going to frustrated yeah
35:06 - but still you so like today we see yeah
35:10 - now it wasn't to make it slow and really
35:12 - frustrating great job yes really amazing
35:16 - full fully fleshed-out project of
35:18 - installation thank you okay
35:28 - can you tell us about your project this
35:36 - is my forget I call it no your English
35:38 - conversation because I'm so tired about
35:42 - people taking photos in your dreams and
35:44 - extension
35:45 - sometimes they really don't care about
35:47 - our work itself the only one is a post
35:50 - on Instagram so I mean very Instagram
35:52 - goal and when you're trying to take a
35:56 - photo of it is soft so maybe you can try
35:59 - it feature do you want to come use your
36:01 - phone and pretend you're taking a
36:02 - picture join a club use your phone and
36:03 - pretend you're taking a particular
36:09 - [Music]
36:17 - give me a second
36:27 - [Music]
36:30 - and what are you what technology using
36:33 - the detective Bowman I used something
36:35 - called open holes if the library can see
36:38 - now you may have the scarlet antibodies
36:40 - right so it's actually not looking for
36:41 - the I know in fact it would do the same
36:43 - thing with me just doing this we are
36:59 - taking photos the kind of gesture are
37:01 - very similar so that's why I'm a little
37:04 - with have a scholarship
37:07 - [Music]
37:19 - dimension and this project of pull out
37:23 - shown you on TV
37:24 - those three creatures are from Chinese
37:27 - mythical stories of the have special
37:30 - policy to like to the great music or
37:33 - listen everything happen in the world so
37:36 - actually it's a it's kind of like
37:38 - performance but 12 right now is a
37:41 - exhibition that I will bring step by
37:44 - step so back to this interface all those
37:48 - interface our web page so everyone who
37:50 - has internet access to those two page
37:53 - this is like playing page and this one
37:58 - is it's a submission page that the
38:01 - audience can participate as damage
38:04 - new way for
38:06 - [Music]
38:09 - maybe
38:18 - and well automatically show here be real
38:23 - time and
38:27 - it's done random
38:37 - [Music]
38:40 - and this this is the controller of the
38:43 - of the program
38:47 - [Applause]
38:55 - [Music]
39:01 - [Music]
39:09 - [Music]
39:21 - [Applause]
39:24 - [Music]
39:34 - [Music]
39:41 - the audience Ament and we also fought em
39:45 - alone when they combine they become a
39:47 - sound
39:50 - [Music]
40:13 - [Music]
40:24 - [Applause]
40:35 - [Music]
40:43 - thank you so much thank you okay let's
40:46 - keep moving this way
40:47 - [Music]
40:57 - [Music]
40:59 - about your spaceship so I'm eating it
41:01 - right so tell us a little about your
41:03 - budget
41:04 - hi I'm James this is 100 days of
41:08 - spaceships before it was all for a class
41:11 - called 100 days of making the class 100
41:18 - days of making which was about iterating
41:20 - on a theme so for a hundred days each
41:22 - day you have to make something new and
41:25 - part of the class is about trying to
41:27 - break free from the chains of
41:29 - perfectionism it doesn't matter if it's
41:31 - good or not you just have to post it and
41:33 - another part of the class was posting it
41:36 - publicly so this was all on Instagram
41:38 - and each of these posters represents two
41:41 - days of spaceship making the first day
41:44 - was modeling a spaceship and in the
41:45 - second was animating the spaceship
41:48 - and this is basically the results this
41:51 - is all 100 no this is all 100 well 50
41:55 - but because they're animated and modeled
41:59 - he so I also wrote a little description
42:02 - for each ship and that's what's that's
42:05 - what's logged here with all those
42:06 - printouts and then on this side is the
42:09 - final animations finish as well as the
42:11 - process
42:13 - did you use the same tool for every
42:15 - single one right I did work with
42:16 - something that I wanted to do is learn
42:18 - this tool it's called blender I use the
42:21 - open source 3d modeling software called
42:23 - blender I wanted to get to know it a
42:25 - little bit better so I use that for all
42:28 - hundred days great job thank you thanks
42:31 - for stopping by
42:38 - the wall to come in you tell us your
42:53 - name and about your project yes so my
42:55 - name is Johnny and this is a project for
42:58 - a team of three Helen and Jenna and
43:00 - they're also in this project
43:02 - and we're making a music box for our
43:04 - children specifically age from 4 to 6
43:07 - and we just want to deliver a very
43:10 - playful experience to encourage them to
43:12 - be more interested with music making and
43:15 - also maybe become DJ or composer when
43:19 - they're young so we're just wanting to
43:29 - actually inspired by traditional music
43:33 - box and then if you'll turn it faster
43:35 - allied watching truster and the future a
43:38 - slow
43:38 - [Music]
43:48 - you wanna switch places
43:54 - [Music]
43:55 - and also there's a the card is some
43:57 - occasion for different instrument by
44:00 - inserting we're just hiking the stops
44:04 - making
44:12 - and then this is the key or turning it
44:16 - off so face turn off ownership yeah yes
44:26 - that actually one of them so simple and
44:34 - elegant and just the interaction is so
44:36 - satisfying remember turning that it's a
44:38 - really great job what when how many of
44:41 - these could you possibly like imagine
44:43 - baking so radically it can be like a lot
44:47 - but right now we're using stretches
44:50 - right so right now there's only three
44:51 - combinations and we have to make it on
44:54 - symmetrical because children especially
44:56 - like though they don't have an order
44:59 - so we're just making it more like stable
45:01 - for having like two different so I got
45:04 - symmetrical connection but ideally we
45:07 - want to make more options and even more
45:09 - children maybe one day they can just cry
45:11 - there on the card and then just awesome
45:14 - great job thank you so much
45:18 - hey didn't you tell us your name and a
45:20 - little bit about your project you have
45:24 - to speak up probably a little bit yeah
45:26 - go meow trade and it's a lab that is
45:29 - turning the movement of the algae under
45:32 - a microscope into the movement of the
45:34 - white here it's a webcam based
45:36 - microscope and by attorney different
45:40 - ways
45:43 - sometimes they're smaller in nature
45:49 - see that the light actually
45:54 - [Music]
45:56 - I wish it could be put into maybe
45:59 - bathroom or someplace that so that we
46:01 - can have a really wide feeling about
46:04 - life
46:08 - great job
46:13 - sorry we can't do the VR projects of it
46:18 - can you tell us your name about this
46:21 - project
46:21 - my name is Koopa and my project is
46:25 - called cat
46:26 - it is my experiment on generate film
46:30 - completely using AI and this is like the
46:33 - very very first step of doing that so
46:36 - what you're seeing now is my first
46:38 - experiment on using neural network to
46:42 - combine human portraits with different
46:45 - things that are ubiquitous in our lives
46:46 - so what you see at the top is include
46:49 - human Porter mixed with cats bitmoji
46:53 - donut power all that ripped jeans and
46:56 - the video is showing how we could do
47:01 - animations for atom human tortured
47:04 - mixtures by manipulating the laitanan
47:07 - factor in neural network so you're say
47:10 - we're seeing a rendered version of it or
47:12 - if it's running in real time and how
47:16 - long did it like what's the amount of
47:18 - time for frame
47:22 - it's 30 frames 30 frames per second and
47:26 - it is because my laptop's not powerful
47:28 - enough
47:29 - so that's like pre-render than generated
47:31 - oh no I just meant like how long does it
47:33 - take you to record
47:34 - oh it's like did you have to run it for
47:35 - days just an hour I think it's about the
47:38 - two hours yeah some very cute and also
47:44 - incredibly creepy castle yeah some
47:46 - people would say it's like putting icing
47:48 - yeah to us yeah great job thank you okay
47:58 - you need a peek behind the scenes money
48:01 - there's no way for you to avoid being on
48:02 - the camera now okay all right tell us
48:06 - your name and a little about your hi I'm
48:07 - Brent
48:08 - I made an AI mirror that uses face
48:11 - recognition to only work as a mirror for
48:13 - me which is very vain in retrospect I'm
48:17 - not sure how well it will show up on
48:18 - camera but like you can try looking in
48:20 - there and it's best in simple alright
48:27 - yeah see it just kind of glitches out
48:29 - when you're in there
48:32 - and I go up to it and stand very still
48:35 - [Music]
48:37 - yeah we'll turn back into a beer there
48:39 - we go
48:42 - alright let's come and check out these
48:44 - plants and then after decide it's not a
48:50 - place anybody wants to be alright tell
48:57 - us your names and about your project
49:00 - well why don't you stand next to this
49:05 - pleasure principle and it aligns the
49:07 - bodies in built-in reward system with
49:10 - creativity and essentially it loves the
49:13 - amount of time you use this drawing app
49:14 - which we've made a vibe to charge this
49:18 - pleasure device as I will call it for
49:22 - future use and right now we were
49:24 - featuring it in live mode so it will
49:26 - actually react when we draw
49:30 - oh my gosh I'm bout it right-handed
49:32 - drawing I'm a lefty and it was made for
49:35 - quantified humanists with Joey was an
49:37 - amazing oh cool it's a behavioral
49:39 - intervention uh-huh
49:41 - do you create an internalized incentive
49:44 - towards creativity what's the camera for
49:58 - anyway they can I think art is Terry for
50:03 - Humanity and I think as much as as much
50:06 - as pleasure is I mean we wouldn't be
50:08 - here without it you know so good job
50:11 - thank you
50:13 - [Music]
50:19 - you can tell us about your project I'll
50:21 - stand in front of it sound that so yeah
50:25 - this is just a large-scale interactive
50:27 - interface that suppose reacts to touch
50:30 - and there's light animations and
50:32 - different sounds depending on what mode
50:33 - it's in so it's a MIDI piano and one
50:35 - mode right now it's in like a other note
50:38 - solenoid mode but yeah just you know get
50:42 - people to come up and play around
50:44 - awesome very colorful and delightful I
50:52 - didn't turn bright red
50:56 - all right let's we're gonna moving along
51:03 - [Music]
51:05 - all right we're like we've we've hit
51:07 - like quite a bit of this show how you do
51:09 - how's your shoulder how's everything
51:10 - going to err glance which
51:14 - [Music]
51:26 - okay so this is Alex right so your name
51:29 - for okay I'm Tampa and if you take city
51:32 - and this is a project like water
51:38 - this is simply chop down and make a song
51:41 - it's a feather in the half on the butt
51:43 - yeah
51:58 - [Music]
52:03 - you can keep shooting that
52:14 - [Music]
52:25 - but the surface like this is like that
52:28 - like an acrylic sheet and then we pen in
52:30 - it with like water resistant spray so
52:32 - that's mind Waters has been helping like
52:34 - that and how do you do this sensing
52:36 - that's the camera right so this is what
52:41 - we're going to talk about a lot which is
52:43 - that you can create a computer vision
52:46 - project where you can control the
52:48 - environment you have an incredibly high
52:50 - contrasting
52:51 - thick space you can do so much with yeah
52:53 - this is like the perfect here for that
52:55 - but it's a testament to that so beauty
52:57 - of this project could it never occurred
52:59 - to me to even look and it's just so
53:17 - [Music]
53:28 - first peter is random like that Connor
53:32 - say it's not bill it's just being so
53:34 - reading back to see the top water and
53:42 - those apps in meadow there are actually
53:44 - trying to send both water and water it
53:47 - never goes off yet sometimes yeah that's
53:54 - a beautiful job thank you project later
54:00 - okay let's
54:08 - tell us about your project hell surname
54:11 - in America project date except for the
54:14 - customer from Japan and my TV first year
54:17 - and I my daughter actually made his life
54:29 - [Music]
54:47 - [Music]
54:55 - we get made together
55:06 - I like the way you put the lights under
55:21 - - it gives it a very
55:23 - blowing like politics
55:26 - and people how do you have kids at the
55:29 - show come and play with it
55:39 - [Music]
55:48 - [Music]
55:52 - I wish we had the baby playing with your
55:54 - pocket right now
55:55 - [Music]
55:59 - about what to me
56:09 - and I created a project called ENIAC
56:12 - girls program and pretend so what it is
56:15 - is a speculative playset for girls to
56:18 - get them interested in programming but
56:20 - the place that also references the
56:22 - history of inequality surrounding women
56:24 - in computing so here it is the motions
56:36 - of being a programmer and the first
56:44 - so you can move around like you can turn
56:47 - knobs and like rearrange connections
56:49 - just like the ENIAC girls of the 1940s
56:53 - in
56:56 - [Music]
57:01 - yesterday there was a person here who
57:05 - just was like it seems to me like they
57:07 - were here for 45 minutes
57:21 - oh look there's a giant dinosaur
57:27 - [Music]
57:43 - why don't you tell us your I'm sorry am
57:46 - i interrupting here never know gets
57:47 - that's my head interrupting it felt so
57:51 - first thing machine and then introduce
57:53 - your dinosaur Maya through it
57:58 - d Dino Dino Dino Dino Dino
58:07 - for the states we partnered with dr.
58:10 - Michael Graham he know who's a geologist
58:12 - and also a researcher at NYU and he
58:16 - specifically studies mass extinctions so
58:18 - we made an AR app we're going Friday to
58:21 - become a geologist by standing the rock
58:24 - layers for evidence of the station and
58:27 - more information about her sister
58:29 - enviable
58:31 - so the way it works is this is usually
58:34 - and if you find an object you can scan
58:37 - it in an AR component will appear so
58:39 - this one's one of our favorites if we
58:41 - call him ancestors true because he is
58:43 - the ancestor of all placental mammals so
58:48 - we really wanted to kind of emphasize
58:49 - this idea of fieldwork and there's so
58:51 - many sense of discovery that you have as
58:52 - a scientist you can actually read a
58:56 - little bit more about it our our ideal
58:59 - setting is definitely like a museum or
59:02 - something so if someone wanted to read a
59:03 - little bit more they could you can exit
59:05 - out back into this search mode and then
59:09 - look for other things summer animations
59:16 - which are like these are like fungal
59:19 - spores
59:22 - a little bit more and then we have some
59:25 - static components - so like for example
59:27 - our favorite dinosaur
59:39 - yeah that's mass extinction not
59:41 - everything on the wall will trigger an
59:43 - AR component because science is hard and
59:46 - you have to search for the answers to
59:48 - your question what was the collaboration
59:50 - process like with the scientists who
59:52 - work with and have you gotten any
59:53 - feedback or as the scientists coming to
59:56 - see it here at the show it was really
60:01 - cool we just got to sort of talk to him
60:02 - about his work he was definitely like
60:05 - hands-on enough to give us all the
60:07 - information but also it's just like I
60:09 - give you sort of ownership over what
60:11 - you'd like to do like how you want to
60:13 - communicate it so it's a really fun way
60:16 - of using AR
60:19 - the scale of what you have built is it
60:21 - really makes it work I've been because
60:22 - he imagine if you didn't have this tall
60:25 - size thing you could really imagine
60:26 - building this out even with a larger
60:28 - scale in his hands
60:32 - years
60:34 - [Music]
60:40 - Wow
60:45 - [Music]
60:55 - [Music]
60:59 - tell us about your project my project is
61:07 - a sound exploration in they are so my
61:10 - idea was to see what happens if I said
61:13 - sound sources and sound source elements
61:15 - in the space and we can move around
61:17 - without out that kind of meant about the
61:19 - beautiful aspect understand
61:22 - that's basically waiting maybe maybe you
61:25 - can move around the tip to Dublin I'm
61:26 - proposin writer
61:32 - [Music]
61:49 - [Music]
61:51 - [Applause]
61:53 - yeah
61:57 - [Music]
62:18 - [Music]
62:28 - super-fun the process music is really
62:31 - nice it's very soothing and soothing and
62:34 - lovely to listen to thank you so much
62:38 - [Music]
62:48 - Sonic Youth's instrument a set of
62:53 - instruments I made for a final
62:55 - performance as it for this class down in
62:57 - space using 17 speakers okay
63:07 - [Music]
63:14 - [Music]
64:06 - [Music]
64:12 - [Music]
64:39 - [Music]
64:42 - we've been going for about an hour I
64:46 - could do it let's go talk to Ty about
64:51 - his back
64:58 - working the weather though
65:00 - okay so my name is it I need and this is
65:04 - my thesis project that's me the story
65:06 - basically it is storytelling application
65:09 - for parents and kids
65:11 - let's see how it works
65:15 - [Applause]
65:18 - telling the Machine what kind of story
65:21 - you want today
65:22 - [Music]
65:33 - then lion and a man channel travelin
65:37 - company the forest
65:40 - and there's the lion
65:43 - what happened next Daniel I have to say
65:47 - something
65:52 - the man has a lion if you would like
65:55 - something to eat
66:01 - see
66:02 - story
66:06 - bird you said they're going to become
66:13 - the bird become a sandwich
66:16 - yeah
66:20 - [Music]
66:22 - and how does it arrive at the end what
66:24 - happened to be introduced in the end
66:28 - [Music]
66:35 - yeah based on the labels benefit their
66:39 - morale India they want to find out more
66:44 - dot XYZ
66:52 - thank you
66:58 - Jessie can we check out your project
67:00 - yeah sure could you just tell us her
67:02 - name a little bit on your project yeah
67:04 - my name is Jessie Simpson I moved a
67:07 - catchable MIDI controller that uses
67:10 - fiber-optic cables to patch between
67:12 - light sources and light sensors for
67:16 - triggering MIDI values and MIDI notes
67:18 - and my computer software so
67:20 - unfortunately we're hooked up with
67:22 - headphones right now so you can't hear
67:25 - it but this is essentially how it works
67:27 - where we have a step sequencer down here
67:31 - on the bottom and as these different
67:34 - placements cross over these buttons that
67:38 - are activated they send pulses of light
67:40 - through these cables and then activate
67:43 - different sensor this sensor grid here
67:49 - [Music]
67:54 - what
67:57 - here why don't we give audio little
67:59 - break okay
68:01 - and you could say hello the IQ show
68:05 - happy videos I'm working a TB y vamos a
68:09 - ver la projector could be an end i
68:10 - worked and emerson aki gala - une
68:13 - metabolic o gente Chile Matabele
68:15 - comentary Colombia a Gila present and
68:19 - Superman hello first moment we do when
68:25 - our Joe saw a Brahma war so he technical
68:28 - mental age among educational
68:30 - technologies but realm is necessarily
68:33 - about web I'm a web developer pride to
68:35 - be and it's a great place to be maybe
68:40 - sooner also become a student
68:46 - so deprecated somebody though which
68:49 - prices have you seen already
68:51 - [Music]
69:00 - so basically to see if they are perfect
69:29 - in terms of being equal having like
69:33 - equal resolve between the six numbers so
69:36 - basically you're trying to prove that
69:38 - the each number will have will come at
69:41 - six of the time as you wrote to be
69:48 - surprised about how the dye each dye is
69:51 - the different from another which ways
69:55 - make a portrait of the knife and reveal
69:57 - its native tangled right security so
70:03 - it's a now you get to so the dice is
70:09 - also dancing the music
70:15 - [Music]
70:22 - [Music]
70:34 - [Music]
70:45 - [Music]
70:54 - suffice I surveyed my humans
70:58 - [Music]
71:01 - but it's very close to suit this has
71:03 - been running for I guess we each
71:05 - numbered like three thousand times
71:14 - [Music]
71:25 - maybe a Latin America nice nose do you
71:33 - wanna suspended
71:47 - venison imagine automatic okay hey Sam
71:57 - thought I get on come on yourself a
71:59 - little down haladki
72:08 - see I'm gonna power Depot
72:24 - [Music]
72:37 - [Music]
72:47 - [Music]
72:49 - when I check out
72:54 - all right okay yeah so hi my name is
73:07 - jeff fretts and this is my project is
73:11 - project it I think
73:12 - and my thesis project is write a
73:17 - statement which I practiced a million
73:19 - times is my thesis is about applying a
73:23 - style transfer to to 360 imagery so a
73:27 - style transfer is a computational
73:28 - technique where you can reimagine to
73:30 - photograph in the style of a painting
73:32 - and I using images from Google
73:34 - Streetview
73:35 - I'm able to create art that forms a
73:39 - connection that inspires the viewer to
73:43 - connect with the actual locations yeah
73:47 - we can do that over here so we are Penn
73:50 - tech so we're using web PR we've got
73:55 - good look at this
73:58 - it's immersive she can look around
74:02 - everything looks the style is applied
74:05 - even look is this pre-business
74:07 - pre-process yes pre-rendered so it takes
74:09 - about five minutes for each one
74:11 - this particular each of these images
74:13 - have about two and a half K resolution
74:16 - and I need to use more GPUs no harder
74:19 - gunfire so I'll do that after the
74:21 - semester is over but the neat thing
74:23 - about this is the stylism is even in
74:27 - continuous and there are no seats which
74:29 - is different yeah yeah exactly learn
74:42 - more about how you did that there will
74:46 - be yeah I'm ready to reach this paper
74:47 - explaining how it works but the data
74:49 - structure is called a tensor shear which
74:52 - is a spherical data structure that
74:54 - supports indexing using spherical
74:56 - coordinates which is like latitude last
74:58 - year and because of that I was able
75:00 - do this
75:03 - so yes when people Street here nice yeah
75:09 - so using their API I was able to collect
75:11 - some pictures that I do that into my
75:15 - algorithm this figure one looking at
75:18 - here is there a watercolor painting that
75:20 - I made as part of my thesis research
75:46 - [Music]
75:48 - everyone's in here
75:49 - [Music]
76:17 - [Music]
76:30 - so what happens Mitch Pacwa system
76:34 - and how these ladies networks and then
76:39 - also the repercussions of it like how
76:42 - you can be tracked what these are and
76:49 - basically just being more aware about
76:52 - your privacy okay Japan and how to kind
76:55 - of be more secure internet advertisers
77:01 - parking
77:05 - it's very hard to explain topics like
77:07 - this we give this in like 40 pages yeah
77:11 - you can also find us online
77:14 - yeah privacy you can print your own and
77:22 - I just follow that it off and you have
77:23 - your team
77:37 - [Music]
77:41 - now you going letting you out of you a
77:43 - little bit
77:44 - yeah if you guys want okay with it is
77:47 - this fun okay here we are with guest
77:53 - host planet hi how are you your project
77:57 - yeah my name is Sean first year student
78:01 - here at ITP my project is called the
78:04 - choice and it is basically a scenario
78:08 - based fictional narrative that walks the
78:10 - player or the reader through different
78:14 - scenarios of the main characters saying
78:16 - where he has to make choices in the
78:19 - world or the age of surveillance and so
78:22 - my message through this project is
78:25 - there's no right or wrong choice but
78:27 - there are well informed choices when it
78:29 - comes to surveillance and data
78:31 - collection so let's educate ourselves
78:33 - thank you
78:37 - so is this online can somebody play this
78:40 - yeah also ruse is Kirikou to play the
78:44 - game
78:44 - [Music]
78:57 - [Music]
79:05 - Gary looking will you tell us your name
79:08 - and about this project yes my name is su
79:10 - Kenya this is the collaboration with
79:12 - Nick who's run away right now
79:14 - it's a project prevalence it's
79:17 - essentially a router and the router
79:19 - leaks liquid as data is leaking through
79:22 - our bodies as you browse the internet so
79:24 - I can we go to BuzzFeed for example so
79:33 - these are the sort of domains it's
79:35 - hitting which are not force field these
79:37 - are third parties and as you can see
79:39 - there's like this liquid that starts
79:41 - running
79:55 - but it's basically just to shed light on
79:57 - the fact that there's this whole
80:00 - industry going around on surveillance
80:02 - for profit and sort of tracking up a
80:04 - neighbor online and creating these
80:06 - profiles of you we have a new guest host
80:20 - now and whoever holds the microphone has
80:22 - to get to can you introduce yourself and
80:24 - say who you are people might recognize
80:26 - from previous ideas I'm not evil in see
80:29 - a no current Ana
80:39 - okay I'm good I'm good right now I'm
80:41 - enjoying this job you want to tell sir I
80:46 - took a bus to our project coffee and
80:56 - hiked working together so the concept is
80:58 - like insect social media that will but
81:03 - when you buy some product you feel like
81:06 - you've got a product when you buy
81:08 - sneakers you got a box right but
81:10 - Facebook users download it from the App
81:12 - Store it seems like so easy but our
81:15 - concept is this when service is free you
81:19 - know the customer you are the poorest
81:21 - nation yeah so we make the concept of a
81:27 - box this is the face pop that be boring
81:30 - so we imagine that Facebook
81:37 - happy Diwali product and the d-string
81:40 - but actually it's not because yeah this
81:44 - is the product and to raise awareness of
81:48 - that we use Facebook and read the
81:55 - instruction to create an account with
81:58 - your personal info it's a user treatment
82:02 - provide activities data to us as much as
82:04 - you could to make sure that you will get
82:08 - a personalized advertisement that can
82:10 - return and help us by sharing feet fake
82:14 - news and political messages that
82:16 - influence your online friends during
82:18 - elections okay I said listener when you
82:22 - open the box it will like secretly like
82:24 - capture yes by face detection and upload
82:28 - you to web server so if the web server
82:32 - is running I think it should be here
82:36 - yeah yeah so now you become a part of
82:42 - the product so according to a research
82:45 - that last year Facebook make $24 per
82:49 - user and tono gonna be like 55 billion
82:51 - dollars
82:52 - so actually we keep the tamil print we
82:56 - see but you know print a receipt yeah
82:58 - for you guys but so you can take a
83:03 - photos or like yeah enjoy with this
83:08 - furniture in class this is all so I
83:11 - combined me and my partner Mike we work
83:13 - on this we combine too fast like
83:15 - villains about social security web
83:18 - server so we combined security and video
83:25 - together and if economies and
83:45 - project it's called I can't breathe
83:49 - it's a homage peace to Eric Garner's
83:52 - last words and then the documentation of
83:54 - how who died it's a data visualization
83:57 - face of black deaths at the hands of
84:00 - police brutality so essentially what
84:04 - happens is the street goes through the
84:07 - days of on a date where there were no
84:11 - deaths of and on a day where life to the
84:22 - hand of an officer the calendar pauses
84:26 - the lungs completely deflate and shrivel
84:30 - and crunch week before the calendar the
84:36 - next day
84:43 - come to work everyday which is now
84:46 - moving backwards to January 23rd which
84:49 - is a cumulative of 80% of which have had
84:55 - no judicial investigation and 73% which
84:59 - were unarmed
85:00 - so my next iteration hopefully will
85:03 - account for like an entire dataset but
85:05 - it takes two hours just to witness
85:07 - January 2018 alone so that's what I have
85:10 - today and use this programmable error
85:13 - which is a circuit board that was
85:16 - invented by a second year and ITV named
85:19 - on the table and so it's a it's a
85:21 - Arduino compatible instead of like like
85:25 - pumps and motors that allow you to like
85:27 - code just like you would an LED or any
85:30 - other kind of electronic device when you
85:32 - want to push air into
85:53 - a location-tracking slash surveillance
86:00 - project goal is to identify devices and
86:04 - see where
86:07 - so what we're doing is we're basically
86:09 - scanning the n-body web and looking at
86:12 - different passes wires and seeing who's
86:14 - connected to which I explained it and if
86:16 - we know who's connected which at this
86:18 - point we kind of know in that radius
86:27 - [Music]
86:35 - the floor map and the different access
86:37 - points located and we start visualizing
86:40 - the MAC address of the devices we see
86:44 - right now we see 60 90 people on the
86:47 - floor and it keeps changing over time
86:58 - with huge antennas
87:11 - [Music]
87:15 - visualised I'm using up to five
87:19 - just interested in learning more about
87:21 - like surveillance technology and privacy
87:23 - underdog
87:50 - so my name is Stefan Stefan step back
87:55 - that's like anyway so what you're
87:59 - looking at is a USB device that is
88:01 - connected that reactor through your
88:05 - browser used if your internet so if you
88:08 - visit a bandwidth heavy web site it will
88:11 - switch from what it's in now it's
88:13 - cooling mode which is actually pulling
88:15 - the inside to heating and and when you
88:19 - what's in here is actually a iceberg st.
88:22 - Ice Cube and so when you switch to
88:23 - heating mode like dramatically increases
88:27 - the speed at which the iceberg melts and
88:30 - and once enough of it has melted it will
88:32 - actually trigger a simulated
88:33 - short-circuit which leads to all the
88:37 - monitor setting off and prevent you from
88:38 - using the device any further
88:40 - so the ideas that it's called
88:42 - representative of the way in which
88:46 - bandwidth heavy web browsing is
88:49 - destructive but also based on the
88:51 - structure in the sense that in this case
88:54 - it means you can use your computer
88:56 - anymore and obviously in the larger
88:58 - scale there's a pretty severe
89:00 - consequence of climate change
89:04 - so the idea so I can even show you how
89:06 - it works essentially right now if I were
89:14 - to visit say Netflix this is my example
89:18 - that I've been showing a lot and do
89:22 - something like show you planet Earth you
89:24 - can actually see that it's switched to
89:27 - heating mode now so it's actually both
89:30 - the color but also the temperature isn't
89:32 - so it's now actually
89:33 - heating up inside there
89:38 - [Music]
89:51 - obviously there is a certain electron
89:57 - like trick amount of energy electricity
89:58 - it suits us to run your devices but
90:00 - ultimately the large majority of the
90:02 - vibrates applause for this sort of
90:05 - activity especially streaming is that
90:08 - there are these massive server farms and
90:11 - a lot of with a lot of which are running
90:12 - on non-renewable energy so it's like
90:14 - it's you know the electricity to run the
90:16 - computer that's the electricity to to
90:18 - keep the whole spaces pool to function
90:22 - optimally and Netflix is one of these
90:25 - you know all all the all the major tech
90:28 - companies are helpers and athletes is
90:30 - particularly bad when it comes to making
90:32 - use of
90:34 - renewable energy in that server
90:38 - maintenance so it sort of yeah exactly
90:43 - so it's sort of like the goal really is
90:45 - to just bring attention to this
90:47 - environmental cost that is generally
90:49 - invisible to consumers because there's
90:51 - no it's not usually
90:53 - [Music]
90:57 - thank you thank you thank you for being
90:59 - the the host Thanks
91:13 - [Music]
91:20 - my name's Lauren rays I'm a designer and
91:22 - I participatory design with low vision
91:27 - of blind designers and makers to convert
91:30 - all the material that's used to teach
91:31 - physical computing and itv2 tactile so
91:36 - these are the original symbols from the
91:40 - P comp site I printed them out and I
91:43 - random let's call this well-formed
91:44 - machine which reacts to carbon and black
91:47 - ink what they did to puff up and then
91:49 - this is the 11th iteration of each
91:52 - symbol using the door design so a lot of
91:57 - the elements are hollow with the solid
91:59 - symbols are less discernible
92:02 - we have brown is changed significantly
92:04 - because shapes are more eternal so just
92:08 - getting them to be a quick read and then
92:11 - after I took all these learnings I
92:12 - applied them to all 50 of the Wisconsin
92:15 - attics so we have 50 of the schematics
92:19 - used to teach this company tactile and
92:21 - what happened after that was it became
92:25 - like a funnel so if somebody needed a
92:27 - schematic that was tactile they've come
92:28 - to me and I realized I was the only one
92:30 - making them so what I did was I created
92:32 - a style guide with templates so teachers
92:35 - and students
92:42 - some slides this time
92:47 - the Braille
92:59 - these are how to handle leader lines and
93:02 - labels so just some examples of what you
93:04 - get when you check out there's also a
93:07 - birch movement of the worktop of
93:15 - the next phase of this research as I
93:18 - wanted I want to find out if I can use
93:20 - these to actually hook up the circuits
93:24 - themselves and then I want to start
93:27 - materials for this benefit
93:35 - [Music]
93:37 - okay
93:57 - this is super fun
94:09 - the budget white flag my name is Cameron
94:13 - Party I'm a first year and I made a game
94:16 - called colour crazy
94:19 - we said explain the game so I made a
94:23 - aqua to reality mobile application and
94:25 - the goal of this is just to make
94:27 - something fun I'm an aqua to the reality
94:29 - and also to trick your mind because
94:31 - you're tapping on the color not the word
94:34 - of like different colors around here
94:41 - okay
94:47 - to tap on all the blues and it's the
94:49 - dark blue
94:57 - and feel free to walk around
95:01 - [Music]
95:14 - [Music]
95:19 - what's your - why do you think 46
95:25 - 19 or something
95:49 - our application
95:56 - well Marilyn later on a friend to share

97:38 - light it's a medium for creating
97:40 - volumetric light sculptures yeah and
97:43 - basically it's it's using movement of
97:46 - separate motors and the light of LEDs
97:48 - and the darkness
97:49 - Troughton produced by like a projected
97:51 - shadow on like object attached to the
97:53 - stepper motor to create like a lot of
97:54 - different volumes of like different
97:57 - volumetric pattern so I can play with
97:58 - different colors essentially like I
98:00 - really like abstract painting and I kind
98:01 - of want to put it like into like a
98:03 - 3-dimensional object using light that
98:05 - wasn't the whole concept you know
98:11 - there's no interactivity in that sense
98:12 - right now it's mostly I just established
98:14 - some kind of the mechanism to create
98:16 - this box but I will add like stuff like

101:16 - to two percent never is dark and
101:19 - immersive the studio so the purpose of
101:21 - this is to allow people to practice if
101:23 - they're a breathing meditation and how
101:25 - this breathing as a primary notice thing
101:27 - to nature in the environment that we
101:29 - always notice that our breathing is part
101:32 - of the nature but we don't see it right
101:33 - away so I want to use breathing and some
101:36 - hard way to Arabic words understand the
101:38 - breathing meditation activity and also
101:40 - under them has to understand that the
101:42 - small changes of breathing's affecting
101:44 - the environment very very more impactful
101:47 - way
101:50 - - Network result all the sensors
101:53 - so right now let's assume in a weird

103:38 - mark I don't call machine where people
103:40 - Khoisan I call grab the toys so like in
103:43 - this game is an interactive animation so
103:46 - like instead of being a human player
103:47 - that is outside the car machine you did
103:49 - some become like a toy inside the car
103:51 - machine and you have like different toys
103:53 - around to you can talk to you like they
103:56 - each have like a different opinion that
103:58 - like whether or not the cause I like
104:00 - going to the outside war is good or bad

104:10 - have like a bunch of weapon bosses front
104:12 - of you that you can throw to them and so
104:15 - to save your friends
104:16 - but like you only have limited boss so
104:18 - you can't you need to choose like

105:28 - two projects so the first one that I'm
105:31 - presenting is for class I took this
105:33 - semester called 100 days of making in
105:36 - which you take an idea and work on it
105:39 - 400 days straight
105:40 - so I took a concept that I came up with
105:42 - about a year ago called broken fluidity
105:44 - with that concept I take cylinders and I
105:46 - create abstractions objects characters
105:49 - words you name it I'm in the second
105:51 - project that I'm presenting is a VR
105:53 - sculpture garden of the digital pieces
105:56 - that I made over the hundred days
105:59 - just got a message by the way that's bad
106:03 - okay this might just suddenly come on
106:08 - [Music]
106:10 - okay okay okay okay we're gonna keep it
106:12 - we can't we can't look at the VRS gasps
106:14 - show us their yeah
106:21 - okay
106:26 - and always a reconnection yeah the
106:31 - digital deuces
106:35 - Oh interesting okay so the priority I
106:39 - would have to I have an adapter they do
106:41 - have long it does both well it's uh
106:43 - let's see if we could get you to explain
106:45 - explain your project this is a simulator
106:52 - that teaches you how to be a successful
106:54 - artist and mr. grammage and it is very
106:57 - simply pressure wave inspired it's an
107:02 - abstract representation of how I feel
107:03 - about being a young creative in this era
107:06 - and you get to sign a consent gives us
107:10 - all your your rights your physical
107:12 - presence your mental presence we copy it
107:14 - we use it after you die thank you
107:32 - you have to do action
107:37 - [Music]
107:49 - this is my project a school party
107:51 - simulator for homeschool boys it's a
107:53 - simulator for going to school then we're
107:57 - never able to go twice party it's like a

108:33 - I'm good
108:38 - we can't really we can't really show the
108:41 - VR project so we're unfortunately but
108:44 - you can give us an explanation of it
108:49 - please right it's a kind of construct
108:53 - e360 we are film I made two cinema story
108:58 - in each of them into version I use the
109:01 - face to see camera for shooting whole
109:03 - small video and for each version I want
109:07 - on I shoot the video close to them guys
109:11 - in the same perspective and one time
109:14 - close to the woman's perspective and the
109:16 - user will have to appreciate you to use
109:18 - to bother to switch between the
109:21 - perspective and think about the details
109:23 - that make them different from each other
109:25 - so they will just put on the headset and
109:28 - see the video and can switch between
109:30 - them whenever they want to compare and
109:33 - see more body details
109:37 - [Music]
109:38 - and we talked about 10011
109:43 - you know what talking but so many
109:46 - details because they have different
109:48 - feelings for each other
109:49 - and it makes me whole experience
109:51 - different and I try to make another kind
109:56 - of situation it is impossible in the
109:59 - real life
110:07 - considering so many other perspective to
110:10 - and try to just take more about this
110:12 - challenge relationship that's always how
110:14 - can there may be problems yeah I hope
110:16 - that kept out people just better think
110:19 - about it

110:50 - [Music]
110:56 - [Music]
111:09 - yeah and I'm a second-year students and
111:12 - graduating and this might be a project
111:14 - let's call the magical pencil the editor
111:18 - is whatever you draw in this game
111:20 - because the field so you don't need to
111:23 - find an item we don't need it whenever
111:25 - you need something just choice
111:28 - you're gonna use it with no puzzles on
111:30 - the journey I'd say that that mainly
111:42 - [Music]
111:46 - you better create a car or something
111:50 - I know that in the work
111:54 - the kool-aid something you tried it
111:56 - appears in the game
112:11 - yeah
112:15 - yeah
112:19 - [Music]
112:33 - actually the blue is their buddy
112:45 - [Music]

113:54 - come on Ames everyone they're gonna
113:56 - check out this performance
114:06 - should we try we're gonna attempt to
114:07 - plug in it let's not talk too long
114:11 - [Music]
114:13 - alright the battery is running low so
114:17 - we're gonna attempt something the audio
114:20 - is definitely gonna cut out for a minute
114:23 - so the way that this would work
114:31 - I'm live on the internet right now yes
114:36 - so let's see so this this comes out the
114:44 - audio is now
114:47 - [Music]
114:54 - here
114:59 - sorry
115:01 - so the question is is this the
115:04 - microphone that's on that would be the
115:06 - question did we do we still have this
115:08 - microphone
115:10 - anyone in the chat could let us know by
115:14 - tap this microphone does that register
115:18 - or we're fine anyway okay let's go see
115:22 - if we can catch it
115:23 - [Music]
115:37 - okay great
115:39 - so I'm so sure native talk about what
115:42 - Antonio I'm a first-year 90 feet
115:46 - and this is a haptic watch so it has a
115:50 - 3d printed case with Velcro around out
115:53 - over it is a lid it's also 3d printed
115:57 - there's a button up atop and it tells
116:00 - time by way of vibrations when I press
116:04 - it and you're touching it you feel
116:07 - different vibrations say it's five
116:09 - o'clock five something now it's almost
116:10 - 5:30 so it'll vibrate like five really
116:13 - short like that and then for ten zero
116:15 - most almost like a heartbeat and the one
116:20 - vibrations are like a little longer like
116:23 - that so if there's another person that
116:27 - can touch it but I'll touch it and now
116:29 - press it and it'll go five
116:32 - funny 30 so it's 5:30 now
116:36 - can I try feeling it sure here you go
116:40 - five down on
116:45 - dirty yeah well and then here is a
116:48 - haptic motor with the gemma board and a
116:51 - battery and some circuitry
116:55 - have you have you spent time wearing and
116:58 - wearing this and some last night the
117:02 - battery power is not that great
117:04 - it just has a 100 milliamp hour battery
117:06 - in it that it has to be you know this
117:10 - has to be taken apart
117:14 - unplug and recharged there's another one
117:16 - that's charging back here
117:26 - here charging the battery that's the
117:28 - battery
117:30 - right there the tiny things about it
117:39 - it's really it's like it's really very
117:42 - distinct like it's certainly even you're
117:44 - not being experienced with a lot of
117:46 - haptic devices I can really feel those
117:48 - pulses yeah
117:52 - I try to design it to have
117:56 - figure out a way to add them up so that
117:58 - it doesn't take too long ready to tell
118:01 - the time
118:02 - great job ready to work
118:07 - here hello would you like to tell us
118:10 - your name I would love to knock and this
118:15 - is untouched and it's an experiment and
118:19 - giving garments like worse so it was
118:24 - made in the where of intro to wearables
118:26 - and
118:28 - or should I touch it but maybe you
118:31 - should touch it right so if we touch it
118:34 - a little bit it responds a little bit
118:36 - right so a little bit of attention is
118:39 - not used everybody likes a little bit of
118:40 - attention but did you hang in there and
118:42 - use yeah so yeah it was we were
118:52 - experimenting kind of technologies
118:54 - wearable technologies and my thing was
118:58 - how to make fashion you like fashion and
119:02 - like too much technology actually has a
119:05 - lot and have you tried wearing it's
119:11 - fresh out of the oven but but we are
119:14 - very interested to see how the wear
119:15 - would feel with the eight vibrating
119:17 - motors on the studio that could be a
119:20 - inside/outside kind of experience yeah
119:23 - good job yeah thank you

128:39 - venmo app here
128:42 - this is very exciting I've never bought
128:44 - anything at the ITV show before I don't
128:47 - know why this feels like so much fun
128:53 - like yesterday about $80 yeah
129:03 - let's fire no no this is this is now
129:06 - documented oh yeah hired they're big
129:09 - fans of the coding tree yeah
129:18 - I'm going for six at Miami on Ben mo
129:23 - yeah you can buy don't know if you can
129:25 - like tweet you could order for like a
129:26 - later delivery I'm not sure yeah we
129:28 - could well be to work something out yeah
129:31 - I know I know how to find it great so
129:36 - which one which one would you like first
129:37 - what why don't you the personality is
129:39 - coming with a new personality the
129:43 - opportunity to choose the new name for
129:45 - it so what would you like that new names
129:48 - if you can you can keep your old name
129:49 - and people still think a lot of pressure
129:52 - how about choo choo like ch ch ch ch ch
129:57 - great and what kind of job would you
130:00 - like to have in the future musical
130:03 - theater director musical theater
130:05 - director okay wonderful
130:12 - [Applause]
130:16 - Saracens like 30 seconds of dinner no
130:22 - it's fine
130:22 - this is like a grid we're two and a half
130:25 - hours all right
130:30 - okay I paid all right
130:36 - these are you capture at 6:00 on a scale
130:38 - of one to ten with one being the lowest
130:39 - and ten being the highest
130:41 - so for teamwork you have 8.4 I think
130:44 - that'll do very well as a musical
130:49 - musical theater yeah musical theater
130:52 - director sounds excellent for that
130:54 - future vision the only 3.0 you're more
130:57 - range in terms of the past so you are
130:58 - close to the future
131:00 - analytics 9.1 so you're excellent and
131:03 - analytics you're very good analytical
131:05 - tasks which I don't know how much of
131:06 - that you'll you'll end up end up doing
131:08 - yeah we'll see tinkering 5.4 so you're
131:12 - pretty good at tinkering it's not your
131:14 - strongest suit but they're good at
131:15 - working with mechanical objects
131:17 - collection 3.9 so you tend to prefer to
131:20 - throw things away rather than hold on to
131:22 - them and project management 4.7 not a
131:26 - great project manager you know worst
131:28 - ambition that was just 3.4 it's about
131:30 - not very ambitious
131:32 - your legs are considering only the
131:35 - evidence that supports conclusions
131:37 - you've already drawn feeling to think
131:40 - things through and becoming caught up
131:42 - and unhealthy codependency your dislikes
131:46 - are doing research thinking over your
131:49 - plans before putting them into action
131:50 - and longing for someone or something so
131:54 - it's a new personality I'll wrap it up
131:56 - for you and then you can keep it you can
131:58 - keep it close in case you're better okay
131:59 - forget who you are you'll have this to
132:02 - refer soon
132:06 - [Music]
132:11 - after the creep
132:13 - [Music]
132:21 - there you go and then
132:26 - all right and then for the
132:28 - for the ethnic juiciness crying we can
132:34 - have
132:36 - look into my Scryer I don't need every
132:44 - time they put my eye all the way up onto
132:48 - [Music]
132:56 - all right so looks like you are
132:58 - surprised okay so let's get you a charm
133:10 - could you focus this might be a little
133:15 - bit difficult but hold this zoom into
133:17 - the jar and then depress the button I
133:19 - can look I can also could switch the
133:20 - knife again it's really just back up
133:23 - audience okay and then press the button
133:27 - until the stars
133:35 - [Applause]
133:37 - [Music]
133:40 - wonderful way is just
134:10 - label it so there's your surprise you
134:15 - can have this for later hopefully it
134:18 - comes in handy
134:19 - and then I'll have the results of the
134:21 - yes
134:32 - my back pocket what do you think the
134:34 - chicks are I'm gonna sit on it explode
134:37 - okay up in my friend pot maybe you can
134:41 - pick it up later I really would like to
134:42 - keep from the results of your strike it
134:51 - seems like 96.7 eight percent of your
134:56 - atoms come from the solar system it's
134:58 - very it's very normal for it to be that
134:59 - nice don't worry one point three eight
135:02 - percent come from a blue snowball nebula
135:04 - which is very exciting but very far away
135:08 - and 1.4 percent comes from other that
135:11 - doesn't necessarily mean that they're
135:12 - not from the other two categories it
135:14 - just means we couldn't figure out what
135:16 - it looks like your interests are social
135:19 - media market diners camping hunting and
135:24 - dance so if you're not aware of any of
135:27 - those interests sometimes with my and
135:34 - then I ask for your future don't relax
135:37 - yet there's more to come and but don't
135:41 - be surprised by a personal attack and
135:44 - it's time to do back on that I'm not the
135:49 - best resolved unfortunately so here I'll
135:51 - wrap this up for you
136:06 - [Music]
136:06 - [Applause]
136:08 - all right thank you very much this is a
136:11 - very satisfying retail experience rating
136:15 - qui baby we'll check out a couple more
136:18 - projects
136:21 - okay
136:27 - hi my name is Chang Chau Chau and the
136:30 - project is my PC project taught one new
136:33 - time it is about personal time and
136:35 - harness affected by geography
136:37 - it was inspired by me where time is now
136:41 - absolute and more
136:44 - active power so I was trying to
136:48 - visualize
136:52 - our change based on our committee so I
136:58 - can assure you got it sure so this is
137:01 - the winding key and
137:04 - the combined debt cap your wine it and
137:07 - it's gonna so there is the video the
137:11 - video is our past 1000 troops and it's
137:15 - playing backwards and so that's why
137:17 - people are working backwards in this
137:18 - video and the camera to capture and
137:20 - there are three three of us in from the
137:23 - camera so it's generating
137:26 - and this one is not that sketchy but his
137:35 - two are chachi and this - employer
137:37 - judging
137:39 - so it is kind of demonstrate how our
137:43 - moving speaking to a back
137:50 - it's a really nice way to tie in the
137:52 - slitscan style effect yeah the concept
137:55 - of time ago today yeah
137:58 - thank you okay okay let's see I think
138:03 - maybe
138:03 - [Music]
138:07 - we can pull we'll say goodbye over at
138:10 - the front
138:23 - this your project can you introduce
138:26 - yourselves and tell us about yeah so
138:39 - this is sanad this is a 1-bit adder
138:42 - circuit where the inputs are two
138:45 - different solar panels
138:56 - what we think is competition when we
138:58 - think is information we found some
139:00 - definitions information is just like
139:02 - relative differences and we found that
139:04 - like oh right that's really similar to
139:06 - like constant voltage and the concept of
139:09 - light there's a constant amount of
139:13 - energy in the universe and when we think
139:14 - of a power plant that's really just a
139:16 - relative density of energy in one place
139:19 - at a point in time with a potential in
139:21 - the future to return to that's erupting
139:34 - without the water with which classes
139:38 - energy and it's just like when there's
139:45 - excess when times are good when kinds of
139:48 - sun shining are good it'll charge a
139:51 - battery because it can get in this stain
139:56 - where there's not enough light to
139:59 - generate enough current to turn on the
140:01 - LED but there's enough to just have the
140:02 - voltage height enough to be like
140:05 - it is on so it's just like a little
140:08 - backup battery that is dead well it's a
140:14 - nice merging and sort of like feature
140:16 - oh yeah I've been we've been saying this
140:24 - we've been saying our part it's a it's a
140:28 - the basics of the personal computer or
140:31 - the target user is Assad yeah and we're
140:34 - waiting for some we're trying to attack
140:36 - some VC funding right now yeah check out
140:40 - from the planet I mean I was gonna make
140:43 - some superman breakfast forgot my brain
140:46 - is melted never I think we're now at
140:48 - like we're almost at two and a half
140:50 - hours all right great job
140:53 - what's the planet in Superman zoran or
140:56 - something no by the chat definitely
140:59 - gonna no not be very embarrassing just
141:06 - to school the arts photography
141:07 - installation okay let's go over to the
141:10 - front
141:11 - I think we're we've done all we can
141:14 - we've experienced the show that is the
141:17 - IPTV
141:19 - yeah we wanted to say thank you're live
141:26 - on the Internet Parsons yeah awesome and
141:35 - are you are you continuing the thank you
141:44 - well we're just wrapping up here this
142:06 - has been almost three hours now I don't
142:09 - know we i we did to hit a lot of project
142:11 - always that just like an enormous guilt
142:13 - that I look for the next few days of
142:14 - projects that I've missed
142:17 - yeah okay so what should you stand
142:20 - together sorry
142:25 - tell us your names and tell us about
142:27 - this project well credit captures I'm
142:30 - Donna hi nice to meet you I'm indeed yes
142:35 - yeah this is a project that we found at
142:38 - two flat portables we created it in a
142:40 - critical object class and okay so I
142:46 - would say art installation that me and
142:48 - animate as a statement about flagpole
142:52 - protocols and black both protocols
142:55 - basically say when a flagpole when
142:57 - you're allowed to breathe the flag to
143:00 - full staff or lowered to half-staff me
143:04 - and Donna feel that those protocols
143:06 - don't necessarily represent always the
143:10 - maybe causes that people would want to
143:13 - lower the flag to half-mast or
143:17 - half-staff and that the people that look
143:20 - at the flags to get a sense of community
143:24 - or mourning as a community don't
143:27 - necessarily get to decide those
143:28 - decisions and so we made this dance
143:31 - digital dance between two flat poles
143:33 - trying to make a statement about how
143:35 - sometimes when one
143:37 - is that the other country's flag
143:40 - necessarily actual and what does that
143:44 - mean and sometimes when we leave in the
143:48 - same country and the flag staff has is
143:51 - pooled which you don't necessarily
143:52 - necessarily identify would that cause is
143:55 - there some universality to this concept
143:59 - of I mean all countries have flags sort
144:02 - of like a convention and they all have
144:04 - protocols but this those you know most
144:11 - cultures I guess have this and this is
144:15 - what we were going with these two very
144:18 - clear statement zero and one yes perhaps
144:22 - that boost up commemoration or victory
144:26 - or civics that's very serious yes oh
144:29 - that's crazy here we are the thing here
144:34 - okay okay well I have to
144:38 - don't like figure this out okay okay
144:42 - yeah so we just wanted to see if we can
144:45 - neutralize that situation and maybe
144:47 - without sides we could be on the same
144:49 - side and it seems to be a very just in
144:54 - tensional choice that the flags are just
144:56 - clear plastic is looking you thought
144:57 - about it right yeah definitely I think
144:59 - that me and Donna coming from the same
145:01 - country when we see our national flag we
145:04 - automatically have an emotion towards
145:08 - that flag and I think they didn't want
145:10 - to make a statement about a certain
145:11 - place or a certain fact but we wanted to
145:14 - neutralize that my so every person
145:17 - looking at the object decide what they
145:20 - feel or what flag they see or don't see
145:23 - in this work
145:24 - we also created this line trying to
145:31 - identify would one side it was just like
145:33 - an experiment because we've got this
145:35 - tree right so that design is that I'm
145:38 - work I think experiences would view this
145:40 - from here but really the ideas for to be
145:43 - outside and then there's contextual
145:45 - information in terms of that is very
145:48 - powerful actually that's just automate
145:50 - anything up and down yeah I've never
145:51 - really thought about the code is also
145:53 - kind of a test if there's one way to go
145:55 - like every function is like half staff
145:57 - whose path it was nice to write it yeah
145:59 - yeah yeah technology wise it's stepper
146:04 - motors we learned a lot about step
146:06 - reporters and area calibrated by twelve
146:13 - sensors
146:21 - thank you for being this is a bit I
146:24 - think an appropriate project for the
146:25 - last project it's very dramatic it's
146:27 - right here in the lobby all right so I
146:37 - think we can wrap this up I'm tempted to
146:41 - go outside to wrap things up but I have
146:43 - a bad feeling that the Wi-Fi will go
146:44 - down so I stand in front of which is a
146:52 - nice symbol so thank you for tuning into
146:54 - this move people
146:57 - thank you for tuning in to this live
146:59 - stream of the ITP Spring Show 2019 also
147:03 - with ima interactive media arts the
147:05 - undergrad program if you want to find
147:07 - out more about these programs you could
147:09 - go to ITP NYU vtu as well as ITP dot NYU
147:13 - vu / ima this is a kind of momentous
147:16 - occasion in the sense that the whole
147:18 - program is moving to a new NYU building
147:20 - in downtown Berkeley next year so this
147:22 - is presumably the last ITP show on the
147:25 - fourth floor ITP is also having its 40th
147:28 - anniversary if you can believe that this
147:30 - fall I don't know what what anniversary
147:32 - show this is the shows weren't around
147:34 - for the first however many years so I
147:37 - don't know I feel a little bit of a
147:38 - moment here but and so what we're just
147:41 - going to do the same old awkward thing
147:43 - where at some point we're gonna have to
147:44 - like all move around and try to find the
147:46 - right button to press so let me thank
147:47 - both body and me true so much thank you
147:49 - guys for help
147:51 - - like with the camera and doing some
147:53 - guest hosting thank you - Lennon who
147:55 - gave his little spanish-language hosting
147:57 - there and all the other people who work
147:59 - at ITP and make this stuff go through if
148:02 - you're wondering what's happening Cody
148:03 - train wise in terms of tutorials this is
148:06 - a very light month so I don't think
148:07 - there will be another livestream
148:08 - actually until June I'll be at the IO
148:10 - Festival in Minneapolis if you're there
148:13 - please say hi but there will be a lot of
148:15 - new videos coming out because I've been
148:17 - recording a whole set of tutorial series
148:18 - about node and data and api's and save
148:21 - them to a database and all that stuff so
148:23 - that'll all be coming out there's almost
148:24 - 20 new videos actually coming out in the
148:26 - next couple weeks so stay tuned for that
148:29 - it's 6 p.m. go and do whatever it is you
148:32 - need to do for the rest of the day or
148:34 - evening if you're staying up too late go
148:35 - to sleep thank you so much again and
148:39 - I'll see you on a future
148:42 - okay think it's as easy as 2 X X X there
148:51 - it is

Cleaned transcript:

we started ok let me just see my recording this hello everyone I'm livestreaming apparently from the interactive media arts program and ITP at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts so my name is dan you're watching the coding train which is this YouTube channel I feel very awkward embarrassing right now I want to just get a couple of logistic things out of the way this microphone is not actually doing anything it is recording audio as like backup audio but there is a new mic attached to the phone that we're livestreaming and so hopefully you can hear me people can hear me yeah ok great so just hopefully let us know in the chat how the audio is oh look at the camera oh I'm looking at the mic yes lettuce thank you let us know in the chat if how the audio is doing hopefully it's going to be better this year than any other year before so this is what you're tuning into there are two programs here there's an undergraduate program called ima interactive media arts there's a graduate program called ITP interactive telecommunications program is a twoyear master's program both of these programs are at Tisch School of the Arts which is this building 721 Broadway in Manhattan in New York City and then a part of New York University so this is the end of semester show of all the students work there probably over a hundred projects I don't know how many we'll get to we've gotten to like 30plus projects before go for an hour or two or two we all into the steam I'm dead Adie who's behind the camera and be true here is helping monitor and so I'm just gonna wander around and show you projects what else do I want to say anything important I think that's good and then at some point I'll also probably try to make an edited compilation video of just the highlight some of the projects alright so let's move hey Kenny how's it going over there you want to be our first project okay so we're gonna come on over here so um tell us your game and a few seconds about your project then we'll get some kind of you know that you can play in the browser like several ways dad was pretty vicious no uses facial recognition too and then the other way of putting it is here the touchscreen I'm familiar with the bumpier maybe tell us a little about the origins mister the thumb piano I just been I'm interested in the thumb piano as the shapes are like meeting the calabash which is round because this is like a modern version you know which is like a square glass you know with a resonator in the middle I made it actually for people with finger muscles or like an adaptive twin browser we're not having to worry about the notes you know with p5 for now there's no requirement to use b5 Jesse relieving to use p5 to do it because you know it gives you all the tools instant like it's an ml 5 pho this okay we try this project here can you tell us about it tell us their names created okay so that's the next person won't necessarily get that compliment look at a random one but that one is just I love the idea of just like a database yeah okay yeah we'll just tell people to talk louder so that doesn't surprise me they we we have we've never had like a great audio at least I'm capturing this audio and we'll be able to put stuff together afterwards but thank you so for the first time ever perhaps oh I remember something I want to talk about the first time ever but it's been a little while but now this year at the ITV show there is a performance room and this is actually the performance schedule so at 426 p.m. Matt Ross will be performing pillow talk oh there's an introduction before that Emma will be producing complication of the computer mouse at 454 p.m. can you tell us what that's enough yes sure a lecture based on about six months of research on the computer house as an object also talking about how gender is an active through the materiality of yeah don't worry about speaking up into business it's this mic that's actually picking you up cool great well we're gonna try to sneak in to catch some the performances that would be great we're gonna be right on time okay okay great all right all right you do you want to tell us quickly about your projects I just tell us your name and if you worry about what we're seeing here my name is Michael bloom my name is Michael Blum and this is a platform to help educate users about some of the recent advances in natural language generating technology which are are basically you can consider algorithms that are capable of generating text similar to what you or I would would write and I think it's important to sort of learn more about them and know more about them because not only would be better able to sort of harness these technologies were creative ends but also just be more conscious of some of the sort of notsogreat things about them I mean there's a lot of issues surrounding bias and misuse so those are some things that I'd like to sort of shine some light on maybe we'll find this online if they're looking for it it is not currently I'm playing okay great well we're gonna include links in the video's description to all the different projects so hopefully if this goes online people will find it through there great kid awesome okay let's come check this out yeah so you can Jeana and this is p5.js shaders I worked on with my partner Lisa LSL and it's essentially a collection of examples of shaders in p5 that are basically and a guide to basically show people what they can do with Jada's and p5 why they want to use stairs and p5 versus your load pixel function webcam and haven't been running in my browser it's not slowing down they're very perform it just might let me a since I want to use them here's the documentation case go through the why the what the how and like this is just like some kittens with using load pixels to increase the brightness depending on distance mounted using shaders and weight faster you just switched from low pixel shader by clicking that button yeah oh wow so what would you say if people are they maybe they know a little p5 they know a little but have never done any change before the idea of shaders completely dude yeah well how where would you suggest that they get started is this a place where they could get started with yeah you can definitely get started here we go through what shaders on how to get them set up and peopIe and even I like some explanation about what's actually going on in the background yeah it's if you want to and even how to use this resource with other resources like book of shaders right and this is the URL up there yeah also bitly /p fighters okay so that's a bit ly /p v shaders cool maybe I get that requested a lot yeah pearls are shaders and I have never done that so this will be helpful great thank you great ok coming this way hey you want to join us in a little while in a little while yeah we're gonna maybe take a little break from me and have a Spanish language version of the live stream okay let's come let's stop here talk about the feedback mer no you tell us your name and a little bit about your processing it's using using the letter AI to visualize the camera image but it's also measuring the overall image to create some sort of feedback ice adjustable so when you started now I can understand what's going on much more now so this is very clear to me I see the onetoone relationship between pixel um kind of angle of this line when you started that had this almost like swirling fluid like quality to it what what's that a factor they stock so that's off right now because it depends on the value you call in set up so even if you change it afterwards it just stays that way so these are exact same two things but this one is and it is 3d effects outside so under strong language it's a very unique you know seen lots of variations of this kind of idea but this idea of having this extra feedback angle it's very unique and creates beautiful effects okay this is the crater creator super fun game pick up Billy's bread you tell us your name and a little bit about your project sure my name's Billy Bennett and I have a c5 sketch with some particles which he may recognize in the nature of code see yeah I I rigged up this musical wand to play music as you swing it across in a way that surprised you or they weren't expecting um all right you'll see a lot of waiting around it's mostly a lot of waving around and confusion they're like what do I do but once they kind of get to the left and right motion yeah I really love the way instigating these moments of the ball popping up it's very like really cool thanks okay I know this might be hard to explain in this context well let's give it a try sure so will you tell us your name and a little bit about your project sure my name is Dan ovett and this is my thesis that I can either selfdriving in it it's about what does the future feel like when our device sir making decisions for us some that are very uncomfortable so yeah don't worry about this microphone okay so making when a future where the devices are making decisions for us that might make you know make us uncomfortable so I made a artificial intelligent device that makes me do what's very uncomfortable which is talking to strangers and the way it works is it when it identifies people it I don't you can see here at the camera so there's like it's identifying people using a quarrel which is a machine learning piece of hardware it gives me an instruction and then I basically went around parks in New York and Subway's talking to strangers and here's documentation video and yeah it's it's a better experience with sound off but you can check out my website and see like the nice documentation video but yeah it was a great project I spoke to a lot of people and then found bent boundaries I never thought would have existed yeah and can you talk about so for someone who might be familiar with a little bit with machine learning yet maybe has done some stuff like on just either javascript in the browser or using tentacle on Python what's what do they need to know or figure out to get it to run on a Raspberry Pi like you've done here sure so this this Raspberry Pi is using what's called a coral edge GPU accelerator which can do machine learning locally without you know sending indicative internet and basically the API is super simple you just send this thing an image and then it'll give you back detection boxes boxes where it estimates a person is or a chair or a cup and you actually don't need to really know that much about machine learning to use this because it's a few key lines of Python code where all that stuff is extracted away and it's using a preach what's called a pre Turing machine learning model which has been trained to recognize about 70 objects whether Yolo models mobile not mobile net okay it's mobile yeah but at some research that's something I didn't get to finish for this would be was being able to trade custom models to recognize specific objects but I want to work on that on the summer so that people could basically create any kind of detection model and then upload it to the gross they can create a machine on your device that's best for that's what's best for them custom personalized myself yeah great job yeah I just have you changed your behavior now when you're not using this yeah I mean I start start asking liquor he says today go and get like really nice responses that I would've never I mean I don't really to be honest like it's just made me understand new things about people yeah and I don't really use it that much anymore but it's just to change my perception and yeah yeah just a more more aware people on the street yeah so tell us a little bit about what you made and I worked on a project where I looked for people in the Library of Congress who are featured in The New York Times is overlooked obituary feature so I put together a day to say the 16 people who are about half the people who have been recently given obituaries only for the first time so some people you might be surprised and they didn't receive it on time to die so I decided to ask like in another institution have they been overlooked it there as well so I asked some questions put together some data by like searching the online collections of the Library of Congress and use that to kind of power the interaction here so the questions down here correspond to the buttons that you can press to find out like are they in the library promise at all do they have a name authority file do they have a subject heading and you can see that you like to start to fade away kind of representing how they might define what it's like today and then I started become extensions which is on my laptop over there playful an exhibit of someone and then I'm interested in like collaborating and like working on the dataset with others I know can you tell us a little bit about the class because this class was a collaboration with the Library of Congress and did you get what feedback did you get from them and what was it how did that process work yeah so some of us I think you were in a class taught by Jared or old artists in the archives and he was an innovator in residence at the Library of Congress for the last year so through Jer like this group of students got to build projects on top of the collections like the help and feedback I got was really great so like through that class I got to talk with bank Metcalfe who is a recommending officer at the library for like gender and sexuality so it was great to get her take on like how our items in the library like decoded with data and how are they find a bowl from her perspective and me even got to go on a field trip to the library which was super fun so we got to see a lot of things in the Library of Congress is an amazing place you can visit you should visit anybody can just go in there you get a library card you can check out stuff nobody's there anymore compared to used to be that researchers would have to make their Bogalusa Library of Congress find information to their research but now there's so much beauty and wonder there now it's really cool and you can still go down to the floor and see the card catalyst it still experience what it would be like to find things awesome great job okay okay oh we've got VR projects you can't really test VR project but you could give us the ones version of what is Island and it is actually based on my the memory the travel memory helped my grandma so basically in their VR sees the user will be welcoming a wood house you will be creating by my grandma and then she asks you do you want her grab her for me have you say yes and then you will have to finish two tasks so this is kind of be a game as well the first status you would feed the chicken so the chicken is aware you feed the chickens you become into edit this is your first tag and the second tax will be you help my grandma to pick up the badges in order to have the breakfast so this will be a very interactive VR games not just sitting there you have to like you know okay so tell us your name and a little bit your project is a lot of stuff to look at here so maybe we can just have you explain it for a little bit and then we can kind of have the camera walk around and speak loud into that microphone so my name is Yao and this is my business project for life in a nutshell there is two parts the first part is a series of sculptures they have 13 from birds with that as and the second part is an interactive installation people can interact with it and they need to make a post exactly like what the sculpture shows and then they will become part of the character to experience different stages of life did you throughout the process of making this was there because you were there new discoveries that you found about how the history of these characters and what they mean and how they out and you have a juicer sense of them as you use them in daily life by doing this project I was also very inspired by this project I made so they are actually deriving from the ancient Chinese character called Oracle bone script the Oracle bone script were considered as the first fully functional and mature Chinese written language so from a lot of the discoveries and findings from scholars we found that since they were pictogram and based on the findings also my design I put human character in each of this Chinese written character some of them has one human being but most some of them have two human being so as you can see here so for example this character this means first it means that the first sprout freaked out from the ground and that means first and for the other character like home it means that two people they hug each other's under under this small roof and then it means home and for example sky you can see that from Asian peoples I actually sky is very small sky just a little difficult little squares so that's all our imagination about the world about sky and also the cards and happiness happiness is so simple it's just like playing and dancing to music like an instrument things happiness and here is love it means two people holding hands with each other and love forms and here our hometown hometown nice to people having meal with each other and they will chat and they will change and then share their memories about their hometown their native place and here are that that is like one people one people gone one who is God and the other people who still alive and those people who still alive groups for the people who already gone so it means that in Chinese characters documentation footage of your installation it's really remarkable effect of characters and the particles going back forth between the human form in the character form easily all right we're gonna try to interact with this project click on the backpack like a very rare sight at iGPS a Windows computer never see that here how many stages where they're all together and if people want to see I don't want to see all the different stages you have this the video documentation online somewhere you tell us where it is people get fired yeah beautiful work it's it's really magical to have it simply recognize your phone and for the how you easy to break backpack pretended I got that affect on computer I can walk I can also now wave and I'm pleased that can I work it's kind of hard to show anyo this would be our brother okay so yeah give us your tell us your name in a short explanation of your thank you for visiting the Museum of Technology history today we have a really exciting exhibit it's a rare artifact in the early 21st century as you all know Automation what a lot of people started through the underground weeding experiences starting to be created and people made these virtual waiting speakeasies so in this the yards of it even you start in our virtual museum and then you can go down a hallway into one of these historic waiting awesome cool and as anybody's we actually this may surprise you or yeah it's really really it's been a good Congress it's been great big job all right countries countries now let's sit here it looks cool okay let's all right thank you guys you guys are together you polish your games you have to keep up so did this microphone to speak up and touch your native village my name is Tony Capraro I'm Adrian Batista TV one and we still have two other group research which is Karen do and it's yeah are you ready to start yes yeah sure no process here we like that you can tell that's accepted well what you're gonna be doing to be joining the CRISPR detective unit today your goal is to find members of the metastasis mafia these are the genes that cause cancer cells to metastasize and spread throughout the body so obviously we want to be able to identify those and we'll give you just a couple seconds to review the evidence board to get an overview about DNA and genes a little refresher but I guess well people online somehow participate in the chat can like solve the mystery whoa what we're gonna need to play a game so we need two players is there anybody who could play it with like Dan with you like Veronica would you like to be welcome to your first mission this is the prechristian era where genetic research was a little bit cumbersome not always accurate now it's the most efficient so to illustrate that point you're gonna be doing here is using your sense of touch gonna be trying to find the bad kid the ones that cause metastasis they have an etching okay so the genetic civilians the ones that no effect on metastasis are gonna be smooth so put your hand in the jar when you find metastases mafia gene member will pull it out and you'll go back in for more and get 30 seconds right it's my left hand sure we're good disadvantage or both are you ready okay ready as you can see it's a little cumbersome it's a little frustrating and editing day was like the little scrap give you see does that what you can do now is enter the modern era where people like you identify and then a DNA sequence is faster and cheaper than ever before Christopher makes it possible to eat a thousand genes at once and evaluations it becomes an experience of members of the metastasis amount Chris Berg has opened up over to new research opportunities for scientists in genetics detectives can help save our genetic Police Department's a lot of time we're still searching for members on metastasis mafia many as you can detective each fingerprint to me tape with Christopher and the machine but if one oh and so okay and what if I find one what do I do it you put it okay if you get goal was to try to simplify how crisper what use use now and how to technology was before to make the user feel like frustratedly was like really slow and we did money if I faster and it's like more like what's what's the best anyone's done with maximum I wanted to make it we started with just one we realize what's going to frustrated yeah but still you so like today we see yeah now it wasn't to make it slow and really frustrating great job yes really amazing full fully fleshedout project of installation thank you okay can you tell us about your project this is my forget I call it no your English conversation because I'm so tired about people taking photos in your dreams and extension sometimes they really don't care about our work itself the only one is a post on Instagram so I mean very Instagram goal and when you're trying to take a photo of it is soft so maybe you can try it feature do you want to come use your phone and pretend you're taking a picture join a club use your phone and pretend you're taking a particular give me a second and what are you what technology using the detective Bowman I used something called open holes if the library can see now you may have the scarlet antibodies right so it's actually not looking for the I know in fact it would do the same thing with me just doing this we are taking photos the kind of gesture are very similar so that's why I'm a little with have a scholarship dimension and this project of pull out shown you on TV those three creatures are from Chinese mythical stories of the have special policy to like to the great music or listen everything happen in the world so actually it's a it's kind of like performance but 12 right now is a exhibition that I will bring step by step so back to this interface all those interface our web page so everyone who has internet access to those two page this is like playing page and this one is it's a submission page that the audience can participate as damage new way for maybe and well automatically show here be real time and it's done random and this this is the controller of the of the program the audience Ament and we also fought em alone when they combine they become a sound thank you so much thank you okay let's keep moving this way about your spaceship so I'm eating it right so tell us a little about your budget hi I'm James this is 100 days of spaceships before it was all for a class called 100 days of making the class 100 days of making which was about iterating on a theme so for a hundred days each day you have to make something new and part of the class is about trying to break free from the chains of perfectionism it doesn't matter if it's good or not you just have to post it and another part of the class was posting it publicly so this was all on Instagram and each of these posters represents two days of spaceship making the first day was modeling a spaceship and in the second was animating the spaceship and this is basically the results this is all 100 no this is all 100 well 50 but because they're animated and modeled he so I also wrote a little description for each ship and that's what's that's what's logged here with all those printouts and then on this side is the final animations finish as well as the process did you use the same tool for every single one right I did work with something that I wanted to do is learn this tool it's called blender I use the open source 3d modeling software called blender I wanted to get to know it a little bit better so I use that for all hundred days great job thank you thanks for stopping by the wall to come in you tell us your name and about your project yes so my name is Johnny and this is a project for a team of three Helen and Jenna and they're also in this project and we're making a music box for our children specifically age from 4 to 6 and we just want to deliver a very playful experience to encourage them to be more interested with music making and also maybe become DJ or composer when they're young so we're just wanting to actually inspired by traditional music box and then if you'll turn it faster allied watching truster and the future a slow you wanna switch places and also there's a the card is some occasion for different instrument by inserting we're just hiking the stops making and then this is the key or turning it off so face turn off ownership yeah yes that actually one of them so simple and elegant and just the interaction is so satisfying remember turning that it's a really great job what when how many of these could you possibly like imagine baking so radically it can be like a lot but right now we're using stretches right so right now there's only three combinations and we have to make it on symmetrical because children especially like though they don't have an order so we're just making it more like stable for having like two different so I got symmetrical connection but ideally we want to make more options and even more children maybe one day they can just cry there on the card and then just awesome great job thank you so much hey didn't you tell us your name and a little bit about your project you have to speak up probably a little bit yeah go meow trade and it's a lab that is turning the movement of the algae under a microscope into the movement of the white here it's a webcam based microscope and by attorney different ways sometimes they're smaller in nature see that the light actually I wish it could be put into maybe bathroom or someplace that so that we can have a really wide feeling about life great job sorry we can't do the VR projects of it can you tell us your name about this project my name is Koopa and my project is called cat it is my experiment on generate film completely using AI and this is like the very very first step of doing that so what you're seeing now is my first experiment on using neural network to combine human portraits with different things that are ubiquitous in our lives so what you see at the top is include human Porter mixed with cats bitmoji donut power all that ripped jeans and the video is showing how we could do animations for atom human tortured mixtures by manipulating the laitanan factor in neural network so you're say we're seeing a rendered version of it or if it's running in real time and how long did it like what's the amount of time for frame it's 30 frames 30 frames per second and it is because my laptop's not powerful enough so that's like prerender than generated oh no I just meant like how long does it take you to record oh it's like did you have to run it for days just an hour I think it's about the two hours yeah some very cute and also incredibly creepy castle yeah some people would say it's like putting icing yeah to us yeah great job thank you okay you need a peek behind the scenes money there's no way for you to avoid being on the camera now okay all right tell us your name and a little about your hi I'm Brent I made an AI mirror that uses face recognition to only work as a mirror for me which is very vain in retrospect I'm not sure how well it will show up on camera but like you can try looking in there and it's best in simple alright yeah see it just kind of glitches out when you're in there and I go up to it and stand very still yeah we'll turn back into a beer there we go alright let's come and check out these plants and then after decide it's not a place anybody wants to be alright tell us your names and about your project well why don't you stand next to this pleasure principle and it aligns the bodies in builtin reward system with creativity and essentially it loves the amount of time you use this drawing app which we've made a vibe to charge this pleasure device as I will call it for future use and right now we were featuring it in live mode so it will actually react when we draw oh my gosh I'm bout it righthanded drawing I'm a lefty and it was made for quantified humanists with Joey was an amazing oh cool it's a behavioral intervention uhhuh do you create an internalized incentive towards creativity what's the camera for anyway they can I think art is Terry for Humanity and I think as much as as much as pleasure is I mean we wouldn't be here without it you know so good job thank you you can tell us about your project I'll stand in front of it sound that so yeah this is just a largescale interactive interface that suppose reacts to touch and there's light animations and different sounds depending on what mode it's in so it's a MIDI piano and one mode right now it's in like a other note solenoid mode but yeah just you know get people to come up and play around awesome very colorful and delightful I didn't turn bright red all right let's we're gonna moving along all right we're like we've we've hit like quite a bit of this show how you do how's your shoulder how's everything going to err glance which okay so this is Alex right so your name for okay I'm Tampa and if you take city and this is a project like water this is simply chop down and make a song it's a feather in the half on the butt yeah you can keep shooting that but the surface like this is like that like an acrylic sheet and then we pen in it with like water resistant spray so that's mind Waters has been helping like that and how do you do this sensing that's the camera right so this is what we're going to talk about a lot which is that you can create a computer vision project where you can control the environment you have an incredibly high contrasting thick space you can do so much with yeah this is like the perfect here for that but it's a testament to that so beauty of this project could it never occurred to me to even look and it's just so first peter is random like that Connor say it's not bill it's just being so reading back to see the top water and those apps in meadow there are actually trying to send both water and water it never goes off yet sometimes yeah that's a beautiful job thank you project later okay let's tell us about your project hell surname in America project date except for the customer from Japan and my TV first year and I my daughter actually made his life we get made together I like the way you put the lights under it gives it a very blowing like politics and people how do you have kids at the show come and play with it I wish we had the baby playing with your pocket right now about what to me and I created a project called ENIAC girls program and pretend so what it is is a speculative playset for girls to get them interested in programming but the place that also references the history of inequality surrounding women in computing so here it is the motions of being a programmer and the first so you can move around like you can turn knobs and like rearrange connections just like the ENIAC girls of the 1940s in yesterday there was a person here who just was like it seems to me like they were here for 45 minutes oh look there's a giant dinosaur why don't you tell us your I'm sorry am i interrupting here never know gets that's my head interrupting it felt so first thing machine and then introduce your dinosaur Maya through it d Dino Dino Dino Dino Dino for the states we partnered with dr. Michael Graham he know who's a geologist and also a researcher at NYU and he specifically studies mass extinctions so we made an AR app we're going Friday to become a geologist by standing the rock layers for evidence of the station and more information about her sister enviable so the way it works is this is usually and if you find an object you can scan it in an AR component will appear so this one's one of our favorites if we call him ancestors true because he is the ancestor of all placental mammals so we really wanted to kind of emphasize this idea of fieldwork and there's so many sense of discovery that you have as a scientist you can actually read a little bit more about it our our ideal setting is definitely like a museum or something so if someone wanted to read a little bit more they could you can exit out back into this search mode and then look for other things summer animations which are like these are like fungal spores a little bit more and then we have some static components so like for example our favorite dinosaur yeah that's mass extinction not everything on the wall will trigger an AR component because science is hard and you have to search for the answers to your question what was the collaboration process like with the scientists who work with and have you gotten any feedback or as the scientists coming to see it here at the show it was really cool we just got to sort of talk to him about his work he was definitely like handson enough to give us all the information but also it's just like I give you sort of ownership over what you'd like to do like how you want to communicate it so it's a really fun way of using AR the scale of what you have built is it really makes it work I've been because he imagine if you didn't have this tall size thing you could really imagine building this out even with a larger scale in his hands years Wow tell us about your project my project is a sound exploration in they are so my idea was to see what happens if I said sound sources and sound source elements in the space and we can move around without out that kind of meant about the beautiful aspect understand that's basically waiting maybe maybe you can move around the tip to Dublin I'm proposin writer yeah superfun the process music is really nice it's very soothing and soothing and lovely to listen to thank you so much Sonic Youth's instrument a set of instruments I made for a final performance as it for this class down in space using 17 speakers okay we've been going for about an hour I could do it let's go talk to Ty about his back working the weather though okay so my name is it I need and this is my thesis project that's me the story basically it is storytelling application for parents and kids let's see how it works telling the Machine what kind of story you want today then lion and a man channel travelin company the forest and there's the lion what happened next Daniel I have to say something the man has a lion if you would like something to eat see story bird you said they're going to become the bird become a sandwich yeah and how does it arrive at the end what happened to be introduced in the end yeah based on the labels benefit their morale India they want to find out more dot XYZ thank you Jessie can we check out your project yeah sure could you just tell us her name a little bit on your project yeah my name is Jessie Simpson I moved a catchable MIDI controller that uses fiberoptic cables to patch between light sources and light sensors for triggering MIDI values and MIDI notes and my computer software so unfortunately we're hooked up with headphones right now so you can't hear it but this is essentially how it works where we have a step sequencer down here on the bottom and as these different placements cross over these buttons that are activated they send pulses of light through these cables and then activate different sensor this sensor grid here what here why don't we give audio little break okay and you could say hello the IQ show happy videos I'm working a TB y vamos a ver la projector could be an end i worked and emerson aki gala une metabolic o gente Chile Matabele comentary Colombia a Gila present and Superman hello first moment we do when our Joe saw a Brahma war so he technical mental age among educational technologies but realm is necessarily about web I'm a web developer pride to be and it's a great place to be maybe sooner also become a student so deprecated somebody though which prices have you seen already so basically to see if they are perfect in terms of being equal having like equal resolve between the six numbers so basically you're trying to prove that the each number will have will come at six of the time as you wrote to be surprised about how the dye each dye is the different from another which ways make a portrait of the knife and reveal its native tangled right security so it's a now you get to so the dice is also dancing the music suffice I surveyed my humans but it's very close to suit this has been running for I guess we each numbered like three thousand times maybe a Latin America nice nose do you wanna suspended venison imagine automatic okay hey Sam thought I get on come on yourself a little down haladki see I'm gonna power Depot when I check out all right okay yeah so hi my name is jeff fretts and this is my project is project it I think and my thesis project is write a statement which I practiced a million times is my thesis is about applying a style transfer to to 360 imagery so a style transfer is a computational technique where you can reimagine to photograph in the style of a painting and I using images from Google Streetview I'm able to create art that forms a connection that inspires the viewer to connect with the actual locations yeah we can do that over here so we are Penn tech so we're using web PR we've got good look at this it's immersive she can look around everything looks the style is applied even look is this prebusiness preprocess yes prerendered so it takes about five minutes for each one this particular each of these images have about two and a half K resolution and I need to use more GPUs no harder gunfire so I'll do that after the semester is over but the neat thing about this is the stylism is even in continuous and there are no seats which is different yeah yeah exactly learn more about how you did that there will be yeah I'm ready to reach this paper explaining how it works but the data structure is called a tensor shear which is a spherical data structure that supports indexing using spherical coordinates which is like latitude last year and because of that I was able do this so yes when people Street here nice yeah so using their API I was able to collect some pictures that I do that into my algorithm this figure one looking at here is there a watercolor painting that I made as part of my thesis research everyone's in here so what happens Mitch Pacwa system and how these ladies networks and then also the repercussions of it like how you can be tracked what these are and basically just being more aware about your privacy okay Japan and how to kind of be more secure internet advertisers parking it's very hard to explain topics like this we give this in like 40 pages yeah you can also find us online yeah privacy you can print your own and I just follow that it off and you have your team now you going letting you out of you a little bit yeah if you guys want okay with it is this fun okay here we are with guest host planet hi how are you your project yeah my name is Sean first year student here at ITP my project is called the choice and it is basically a scenario based fictional narrative that walks the player or the reader through different scenarios of the main characters saying where he has to make choices in the world or the age of surveillance and so my message through this project is there's no right or wrong choice but there are well informed choices when it comes to surveillance and data collection so let's educate ourselves thank you so is this online can somebody play this yeah also ruse is Kirikou to play the game Gary looking will you tell us your name and about this project yes my name is su Kenya this is the collaboration with Nick who's run away right now it's a project prevalence it's essentially a router and the router leaks liquid as data is leaking through our bodies as you browse the internet so I can we go to BuzzFeed for example so these are the sort of domains it's hitting which are not force field these are third parties and as you can see there's like this liquid that starts running but it's basically just to shed light on the fact that there's this whole industry going around on surveillance for profit and sort of tracking up a neighbor online and creating these profiles of you we have a new guest host now and whoever holds the microphone has to get to can you introduce yourself and say who you are people might recognize from previous ideas I'm not evil in see a no current Ana okay I'm good I'm good right now I'm enjoying this job you want to tell sir I took a bus to our project coffee and hiked working together so the concept is like insect social media that will but when you buy some product you feel like you've got a product when you buy sneakers you got a box right but Facebook users download it from the App Store it seems like so easy but our concept is this when service is free you know the customer you are the poorest nation yeah so we make the concept of a box this is the face pop that be boring so we imagine that Facebook happy Diwali product and the dstring but actually it's not because yeah this is the product and to raise awareness of that we use Facebook and read the instruction to create an account with your personal info it's a user treatment provide activities data to us as much as you could to make sure that you will get a personalized advertisement that can return and help us by sharing feet fake news and political messages that influence your online friends during elections okay I said listener when you open the box it will like secretly like capture yes by face detection and upload you to web server so if the web server is running I think it should be here yeah yeah so now you become a part of the product so according to a research that last year Facebook make $24 per user and tono gonna be like 55 billion dollars so actually we keep the tamil print we see but you know print a receipt yeah for you guys but so you can take a photos or like yeah enjoy with this furniture in class this is all so I combined me and my partner Mike we work on this we combine too fast like villains about social security web server so we combined security and video together and if economies and project it's called I can't breathe it's a homage peace to Eric Garner's last words and then the documentation of how who died it's a data visualization face of black deaths at the hands of police brutality so essentially what happens is the street goes through the days of on a date where there were no deaths of and on a day where life to the hand of an officer the calendar pauses the lungs completely deflate and shrivel and crunch week before the calendar the next day come to work everyday which is now moving backwards to January 23rd which is a cumulative of 80% of which have had no judicial investigation and 73% which were unarmed so my next iteration hopefully will account for like an entire dataset but it takes two hours just to witness January 2018 alone so that's what I have today and use this programmable error which is a circuit board that was invented by a second year and ITV named on the table and so it's a it's a Arduino compatible instead of like like pumps and motors that allow you to like code just like you would an LED or any other kind of electronic device when you want to push air into a locationtracking slash surveillance project goal is to identify devices and see where so what we're doing is we're basically scanning the nbody web and looking at different passes wires and seeing who's connected to which I explained it and if we know who's connected which at this point we kind of know in that radius the floor map and the different access points located and we start visualizing the MAC address of the devices we see right now we see 60 90 people on the floor and it keeps changing over time with huge antennas visualised I'm using up to five just interested in learning more about like surveillance technology and privacy underdog so my name is Stefan Stefan step back that's like anyway so what you're looking at is a USB device that is connected that reactor through your browser used if your internet so if you visit a bandwidth heavy web site it will switch from what it's in now it's cooling mode which is actually pulling the inside to heating and and when you what's in here is actually a iceberg st. Ice Cube and so when you switch to heating mode like dramatically increases the speed at which the iceberg melts and and once enough of it has melted it will actually trigger a simulated shortcircuit which leads to all the monitor setting off and prevent you from using the device any further so the ideas that it's called representative of the way in which bandwidth heavy web browsing is destructive but also based on the structure in the sense that in this case it means you can use your computer anymore and obviously in the larger scale there's a pretty severe consequence of climate change so the idea so I can even show you how it works essentially right now if I were to visit say Netflix this is my example that I've been showing a lot and do something like show you planet Earth you can actually see that it's switched to heating mode now so it's actually both the color but also the temperature isn't so it's now actually heating up inside there obviously there is a certain electron like trick amount of energy electricity it suits us to run your devices but ultimately the large majority of the vibrates applause for this sort of activity especially streaming is that there are these massive server farms and a lot of with a lot of which are running on nonrenewable energy so it's like it's you know the electricity to run the computer that's the electricity to to keep the whole spaces pool to function optimally and Netflix is one of these you know all all the all the major tech companies are helpers and athletes is particularly bad when it comes to making use of renewable energy in that server maintenance so it sort of yeah exactly so it's sort of like the goal really is to just bring attention to this environmental cost that is generally invisible to consumers because there's no it's not usually thank you thank you thank you for being the the host Thanks my name's Lauren rays I'm a designer and I participatory design with low vision of blind designers and makers to convert all the material that's used to teach physical computing and itv2 tactile so these are the original symbols from the P comp site I printed them out and I random let's call this wellformed machine which reacts to carbon and black ink what they did to puff up and then this is the 11th iteration of each symbol using the door design so a lot of the elements are hollow with the solid symbols are less discernible we have brown is changed significantly because shapes are more eternal so just getting them to be a quick read and then after I took all these learnings I applied them to all 50 of the Wisconsin attics so we have 50 of the schematics used to teach this company tactile and what happened after that was it became like a funnel so if somebody needed a schematic that was tactile they've come to me and I realized I was the only one making them so what I did was I created a style guide with templates so teachers and students some slides this time the Braille these are how to handle leader lines and labels so just some examples of what you get when you check out there's also a birch movement of the worktop of the next phase of this research as I wanted I want to find out if I can use these to actually hook up the circuits themselves and then I want to start materials for this benefit okay this is super fun the budget white flag my name is Cameron Party I'm a first year and I made a game called colour crazy we said explain the game so I made a aqua to reality mobile application and the goal of this is just to make something fun I'm an aqua to the reality and also to trick your mind because you're tapping on the color not the word of like different colors around here okay to tap on all the blues and it's the dark blue and feel free to walk around what's your why do you think 46 19 or something our application well Marilyn later on a friend to share their secrets and the Morris the cat is our daughter her name is bird and when you feel very lonely you can share your secrets and Morris like the international students started alone you tell us about the physiology behind asleep introduced Cody and this animation just to use that obviously thoughts and explore with the PMD sequence by with the collie yeah hi hello my name is Jason Jung this is my thesis project it's called the conjunctiva and it's not like a light it's a medium for creating volumetric light sculptures yeah and basically it's it's using movement of separate motors and the light of LEDs and the darkness Troughton produced by like a projected shadow on like object attached to the stepper motor to create like a lot of different volumes of like different volumetric pattern so I can play with different colors essentially like I really like abstract painting and I kind of want to put it like into like a 3dimensional object using light that wasn't the whole concept you know there's no interactivity in that sense right now it's mostly I just established some kind of the mechanism to create this box but I will add like stuff like react to the sound okay hello hi okay my boyfriend's watching right now hi Vince okay so basically what this is is as you may or may not know world Pride it is happening to June and it is for the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots basically that was like a huge it was a little bar fight or a very famous um thing that happened that basically launched the the gay civil rights LGBT civil rights movement in New York so now you may or may not know this but the arch in Washington so on the half centennial anniversary of the LGBT civil rights star what better way than to commemorate the founding mothers and fathers so this is my project basically what I'm trying to do is tell the story of what's happened in 50 years in New York you know between you know the early pride marches to the AIDS epidemic into the 90s the rise of folk culture Paris burning kinds of things and and just really time to thought so do you imagine during projection met and yes you know if any and and whiting administrators are hearing me I'm trying really hard York City what pride to do this on the actual arch and yeah and this is something that I would really love to do that's my project thank you I'm hoping so because there's so many people from all over the world that are coming to celebrate and I want them to see those impactful people like Hector extravaganza Sylvia Rivera Marshall ki Johnson people that really made pride what it is so ok that's what I got thank you so much breathing meditation experiences could you introduce yourself oh I'm sorry I'm Ella nice to meet you guys so I'm graduating this year and this is my thesis project which is called brass wheelie and breathing meditation for one to two percent never is dark and immersive the studio so the purpose of this is to allow people to practice if they're a breathing meditation and how this breathing as a primary notice thing to nature in the environment that we always notice that our breathing is part of the nature but we don't see it right away so I want to use breathing and some hard way to Arabic words understand the breathing meditation activity and also under them has to understand that the small changes of breathing's affecting the environment very very more impactful way Network result all the sensors so right now let's assume in a weird answer is checking their birth name and when you move in a very nice to do that thank you thank you so much everybody talking about how much energy we're heading to the Under this is exciting actually no idea with thank you I have it go this is Miami over here and then dissing so we can try to catch up these projects so should I clock look here yeah hi my name is Rui and this is our project first virtual reality I'm working with my partner Roger Xu who has already flying to China so this one is called claw machine so like in a game mark I don't call machine where people Khoisan I call grab the toys so like in this game is an interactive animation so like instead of being a human player that is outside the car machine you did some become like a toy inside the car machine and you have like different toys around to you can talk to you like they each have like a different opinion that like whether or not the cause I like going to the outside war is good or bad so like you are the park I'm glad you're feeling boy among all the other toys that can like move your hands and we have like a bunch of weapon bosses front of you that you can throw to them and so to save your friends but like you only have limited boss so you can't you need to choose like whether or not to save the boss to save yourself right to say isn't it we're like kids my name is Rosie I'm actually presenting two projects so the first one that I'm presenting is for class I took this semester called 100 days of making in which you take an idea and work on it 400 days straight so I took a concept that I came up with about a year ago called broken fluidity with that concept I take cylinders and I create abstractions objects characters words you name it I'm in the second project that I'm presenting is a VR sculpture garden of the digital pieces that I made over the hundred days just got a message by the way that's bad okay this might just suddenly come on okay okay okay okay we're gonna keep it we can't we can't look at the VRS gasps show us their yeah okay and always a reconnection yeah the digital deuces Oh interesting okay so the priority I would have to I have an adapter they do have long it does both well it's uh let's see if we could get you to explain explain your project this is a simulator that teaches you how to be a successful artist and mr. grammage and it is very simply pressure wave inspired it's an abstract representation of how I feel about being a young creative in this era and you get to sign a consent gives us all your your rights your physical presence your mental presence we copy it we use it after you die thank you you have to do action this is my project a school party simulator for homeschool boys it's a simulator for going to school then we're never able to go twice party it's like a comedy leash the pr2 watch it at home it ends with a magical moment I'm good we can't really we can't really show the VR project so we're unfortunately but you can give us an explanation of it please right it's a kind of construct e360 we are film I made two cinema story in each of them into version I use the face to see camera for shooting whole small video and for each version I want on I shoot the video close to them guys in the same perspective and one time close to the woman's perspective and the user will have to appreciate you to use to bother to switch between the perspective and think about the details that make them different from each other so they will just put on the headset and see the video and can switch between them whenever they want to compare and see more body details and we talked about 10011 you know what talking but so many details because they have different feelings for each other and it makes me whole experience different and I try to make another kind of situation it is impossible in the real life considering so many other perspective to and try to just take more about this challenge relationship that's always how can there may be problems yeah I hope that kept out people just better think about it thank you thank you oh yeah yeah and I'm a secondyear students and graduating and this might be a project let's call the magical pencil the editor is whatever you draw in this game because the field so you don't need to find an item we don't need it whenever you need something just choice you're gonna use it with no puzzles on the journey I'd say that that mainly you better create a car or something I know that in the work the koolaid something you tried it appears in the game yeah yeah actually the blue is their buddy you're on the negative rate come on Ames everyone they're gonna check out this performance should we try we're gonna attempt to plug in it let's not talk too long alright the battery is running low so we're gonna attempt something the audio is definitely gonna cut out for a minute so the way that this would work I'm live on the internet right now yes so let's see so this this comes out the audio is now here sorry so the question is is this the microphone that's on that would be the question did we do we still have this microphone anyone in the chat could let us know by tap this microphone does that register or we're fine anyway okay let's go see if we can catch it okay great so I'm so sure native talk about what Antonio I'm a firstyear 90 feet and this is a haptic watch so it has a 3d printed case with Velcro around out over it is a lid it's also 3d printed there's a button up atop and it tells time by way of vibrations when I press it and you're touching it you feel different vibrations say it's five o'clock five something now it's almost 530 so it'll vibrate like five really short like that and then for ten zero most almost like a heartbeat and the one vibrations are like a little longer like that so if there's another person that can touch it but I'll touch it and now press it and it'll go five funny 30 so it's 530 now can I try feeling it sure here you go five down on dirty yeah well and then here is a haptic motor with the gemma board and a battery and some circuitry have you have you spent time wearing and wearing this and some last night the battery power is not that great it just has a 100 milliamp hour battery in it that it has to be you know this has to be taken apart unplug and recharged there's another one that's charging back here here charging the battery that's the battery right there the tiny things about it it's really it's like it's really very distinct like it's certainly even you're not being experienced with a lot of haptic devices I can really feel those pulses yeah I try to design it to have figure out a way to add them up so that it doesn't take too long ready to tell the time great job ready to work here hello would you like to tell us your name I would love to knock and this is untouched and it's an experiment and giving garments like worse so it was made in the where of intro to wearables and or should I touch it but maybe you should touch it right so if we touch it a little bit it responds a little bit right so a little bit of attention is not used everybody likes a little bit of attention but did you hang in there and use yeah so yeah it was we were experimenting kind of technologies wearable technologies and my thing was how to make fashion you like fashion and like too much technology actually has a lot and have you tried wearing it's fresh out of the oven but but we are very interested to see how the wear would feel with the eight vibrating motors on the studio that could be a inside/outside kind of experience yeah good job yeah thank you you can come check out these project my name is Anna first years and then my cruiser is April video controller because when I'm cooking a music watching a YouTube video but I don't want to pause my iPad in my grizzy so if I'm wearing this apron I don't know if I can control video with this right now have you tried this and actually cooked was wearing these yet yeah what did you make the design astray because I couldn't even really notice at first kind of the simulator is a fling button the pause button is very abstract so it's falling to it okay we tell us your name and about your project I guess what comes Stan usually give me in front of you application and the address here is displayed on this loom what is what what because all right let's come back this way say your names and then tell us about your project open yet and this is our project this would be so comfy to wear it's like a physical therapy and in the back like a mental therapy it's just this show others like a woman's statement like a free every release and like to be practice it's like a breezy like calm down read them they just assured that America is and the in the middle part is rabbit straight is dressing from the bottom to the top issues that my love energy through the current I would love to I feel like it would be good for like wrap up I know you you have to go yes so we're going to go there's a few more projects downstairs in the lobby that I'm going to take us to go see well I recall last time we did this the WiFi cut out while we're in the stairwell so the stream might go down for a minute hopefully we get downstairs it'll check itself back up so rest assured we're coming back I will say good bye when it's time to say goodbye all right so let's head down the stairs there any stairwell very exciting no not for flights by the way the new IT teams will be in downtown Brooklyn will also be on the fourth floor we'll come back but this is gets a little more relaxed down here and we can kind of take a place to sort of finish up back all right I think we're back we reconnected we're in the lobby of the Tisch School of the Arts and we're gonna look at a few more projects for a little bit longer and then I will say goodbye but this full livestream will be left archived online so you'll be able to watch it later if you the futures market we do some time every day Toronto well you look so official look like microphones that camera can we do some shopping here yes you want to tell us your name and about the market sure my name is my name is Alton Jones and futures market is a store that I made to solve a variety of different speculative products and services oh you take that moment I do take okay I'm gonna buy something okay great I don't know what's about good personality and the chat can weigh in here I'm a very frugal person just be aware although I kind of want to buy the information straight let's see so there's the personality reassignment personality scrambler biomedics crying yeah so I can I gotta use reading and ethic juice job yeah I could explain these a little bit so for the personality reassignment I would generate a new personality for you it's very simple and I was gonna get a little scroll like this with your new information on it I'm actually not selling the personality of scrambler today I usually someone a USB Drive it's just a software that I wrote that you can find with the panics prodding I would use my sprite over here to reveal all the pics about for my refuge reader if you have anything you're planning on throwing away I could use my trash analyzer over here to analyze that objects and then basically what results is an analysis you would tell us deeper insights about you you might not have realized in the phonetic juice jar I could take care of my things and literally bottle them up for later use you would come in a little bottle like this and the way you would apply the emotion leader is just to open the bottle and dispensing it upon your head and today with any effort juice jar that I'm selling I'm also throwing in a free by the next time oh wow cuz I was gonna say I was I was kind of interested in both the personality reassignment and the effect juice job alright I was gonna get both of them and then I would get the by Nick Kurt's trying yeah I would say also anybody watching this should feel free to venmo and buy something for me but I'm gonna purchase this myself all right we're just gonna open up the venmo app here this is very exciting I've never bought anything at the ITV show before I don't know why this feels like so much fun like yesterday about $80 yeah let's fire no no this is this is now documented oh yeah hired they're big fans of the coding tree yeah I'm going for six at Miami on Ben mo yeah you can buy don't know if you can like tweet you could order for like a later delivery I'm not sure yeah we could well be to work something out yeah I know I know how to find it great so which one which one would you like first what why don't you the personality is coming with a new personality the opportunity to choose the new name for it so what would you like that new names if you can you can keep your old name and people still think a lot of pressure how about choo choo like ch ch ch ch ch great and what kind of job would you like to have in the future musical theater director musical theater director okay wonderful Saracens like 30 seconds of dinner no it's fine this is like a grid we're two and a half hours all right okay I paid all right these are you capture at 600 on a scale of one to ten with one being the lowest and ten being the highest so for teamwork you have 8.4 I think that'll do very well as a musical musical theater yeah musical theater director sounds excellent for that future vision the only 3.0 you're more range in terms of the past so you are close to the future analytics 9.1 so you're excellent and analytics you're very good analytical tasks which I don't know how much of that you'll you'll end up end up doing yeah we'll see tinkering 5.4 so you're pretty good at tinkering it's not your strongest suit but they're good at working with mechanical objects collection 3.9 so you tend to prefer to throw things away rather than hold on to them and project management 4.7 not a great project manager you know worst ambition that was just 3.4 it's about not very ambitious your legs are considering only the evidence that supports conclusions you've already drawn feeling to think things through and becoming caught up and unhealthy codependency your dislikes are doing research thinking over your plans before putting them into action and longing for someone or something so it's a new personality I'll wrap it up for you and then you can keep it you can keep it close in case you're better okay forget who you are you'll have this to refer soon after the creep there you go and then all right and then for the for the ethnic juiciness crying we can have look into my Scryer I don't need every time they put my eye all the way up onto all right so looks like you are surprised okay so let's get you a charm could you focus this might be a little bit difficult but hold this zoom into the jar and then depress the button I can look I can also could switch the knife again it's really just back up audience okay and then press the button until the stars wonderful way is just label it so there's your surprise you can have this for later hopefully it comes in handy and then I'll have the results of the yes my back pocket what do you think the chicks are I'm gonna sit on it explode okay up in my friend pot maybe you can pick it up later I really would like to keep from the results of your strike it seems like 96.7 eight percent of your atoms come from the solar system it's very it's very normal for it to be that nice don't worry one point three eight percent come from a blue snowball nebula which is very exciting but very far away and 1.4 percent comes from other that doesn't necessarily mean that they're not from the other two categories it just means we couldn't figure out what it looks like your interests are social media market diners camping hunting and dance so if you're not aware of any of those interests sometimes with my and then I ask for your future don't relax yet there's more to come and but don't be surprised by a personal attack and it's time to do back on that I'm not the best resolved unfortunately so here I'll wrap this up for you all right thank you very much this is a very satisfying retail experience rating qui baby we'll check out a couple more projects okay hi my name is Chang Chau Chau and the project is my PC project taught one new time it is about personal time and harness affected by geography it was inspired by me where time is now absolute and more active power so I was trying to visualize our change based on our committee so I can assure you got it sure so this is the winding key and the combined debt cap your wine it and it's gonna so there is the video the video is our past 1000 troops and it's playing backwards and so that's why people are working backwards in this video and the camera to capture and there are three three of us in from the camera so it's generating and this one is not that sketchy but his two are chachi and this employer judging so it is kind of demonstrate how our moving speaking to a back it's a really nice way to tie in the slitscan style effect yeah the concept of time ago today yeah thank you okay okay let's see I think maybe we can pull we'll say goodbye over at the front this your project can you introduce yourselves and tell us about yeah so this is sanad this is a 1bit adder circuit where the inputs are two different solar panels what we think is competition when we think is information we found some definitions information is just like relative differences and we found that like oh right that's really similar to like constant voltage and the concept of light there's a constant amount of energy in the universe and when we think of a power plant that's really just a relative density of energy in one place at a point in time with a potential in the future to return to that's erupting without the water with which classes energy and it's just like when there's excess when times are good when kinds of sun shining are good it'll charge a battery because it can get in this stain where there's not enough light to generate enough current to turn on the LED but there's enough to just have the voltage height enough to be like it is on so it's just like a little backup battery that is dead well it's a nice merging and sort of like feature oh yeah I've been we've been saying this we've been saying our part it's a it's a the basics of the personal computer or the target user is Assad yeah and we're waiting for some we're trying to attack some VC funding right now yeah check out from the planet I mean I was gonna make some superman breakfast forgot my brain is melted never I think we're now at like we're almost at two and a half hours all right great job what's the planet in Superman zoran or something no by the chat definitely gonna no not be very embarrassing just to school the arts photography installation okay let's go over to the front I think we're we've done all we can we've experienced the show that is the IPTV yeah we wanted to say thank you're live on the Internet Parsons yeah awesome and are you are you continuing the thank you well we're just wrapping up here this has been almost three hours now I don't know we i we did to hit a lot of project always that just like an enormous guilt that I look for the next few days of projects that I've missed yeah okay so what should you stand together sorry tell us your names and tell us about this project well credit captures I'm Donna hi nice to meet you I'm indeed yes yeah this is a project that we found at two flat portables we created it in a critical object class and okay so I would say art installation that me and animate as a statement about flagpole protocols and black both protocols basically say when a flagpole when you're allowed to breathe the flag to full staff or lowered to halfstaff me and Donna feel that those protocols don't necessarily represent always the maybe causes that people would want to lower the flag to halfmast or halfstaff and that the people that look at the flags to get a sense of community or mourning as a community don't necessarily get to decide those decisions and so we made this dance digital dance between two flat poles trying to make a statement about how sometimes when one is that the other country's flag necessarily actual and what does that mean and sometimes when we leave in the same country and the flag staff has is pooled which you don't necessarily necessarily identify would that cause is there some universality to this concept of I mean all countries have flags sort of like a convention and they all have protocols but this those you know most cultures I guess have this and this is what we were going with these two very clear statement zero and one yes perhaps that boost up commemoration or victory or civics that's very serious yes oh that's crazy here we are the thing here okay okay well I have to don't like figure this out okay okay yeah so we just wanted to see if we can neutralize that situation and maybe without sides we could be on the same side and it seems to be a very just in tensional choice that the flags are just clear plastic is looking you thought about it right yeah definitely I think that me and Donna coming from the same country when we see our national flag we automatically have an emotion towards that flag and I think they didn't want to make a statement about a certain place or a certain fact but we wanted to neutralize that my so every person looking at the object decide what they feel or what flag they see or don't see in this work we also created this line trying to identify would one side it was just like an experiment because we've got this tree right so that design is that I'm work I think experiences would view this from here but really the ideas for to be outside and then there's contextual information in terms of that is very powerful actually that's just automate anything up and down yeah I've never really thought about the code is also kind of a test if there's one way to go like every function is like half staff whose path it was nice to write it yeah yeah yeah technology wise it's stepper motors we learned a lot about step reporters and area calibrated by twelve sensors thank you for being this is a bit I think an appropriate project for the last project it's very dramatic it's right here in the lobby all right so I think we can wrap this up I'm tempted to go outside to wrap things up but I have a bad feeling that the WiFi will go down so I stand in front of which is a nice symbol so thank you for tuning into this move people thank you for tuning in to this live stream of the ITP Spring Show 2019 also with ima interactive media arts the undergrad program if you want to find out more about these programs you could go to ITP NYU vtu as well as ITP dot NYU vu / ima this is a kind of momentous occasion in the sense that the whole program is moving to a new NYU building in downtown Berkeley next year so this is presumably the last ITP show on the fourth floor ITP is also having its 40th anniversary if you can believe that this fall I don't know what what anniversary show this is the shows weren't around for the first however many years so I don't know I feel a little bit of a moment here but and so what we're just going to do the same old awkward thing where at some point we're gonna have to like all move around and try to find the right button to press so let me thank both body and me true so much thank you guys for help like with the camera and doing some guest hosting thank you Lennon who gave his little spanishlanguage hosting there and all the other people who work at ITP and make this stuff go through if you're wondering what's happening Cody train wise in terms of tutorials this is a very light month so I don't think there will be another livestream actually until June I'll be at the IO Festival in Minneapolis if you're there please say hi but there will be a lot of new videos coming out because I've been recording a whole set of tutorial series about node and data and api's and save them to a database and all that stuff so that'll all be coming out there's almost 20 new videos actually coming out in the next couple weeks so stay tuned for that it's 6 p.m. go and do whatever it is you need to do for the rest of the day or evening if you're staying up too late go to sleep thank you so much again and I'll see you on a future okay think it's as easy as 2 X X X there it is
