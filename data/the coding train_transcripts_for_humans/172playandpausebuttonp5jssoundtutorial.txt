00:00 - hello and welcome to part two of my
00:02 - videos about sound in p5.js
00:05 - now I forgot a few things in my previous
00:08 - video that I want to briefly mention so
00:10 - the first thing I want to mention and
00:12 - let me just mute this tab here is that
00:14 - when you're working with sound in p5.js
00:18 - you want to make sure that you've also
00:19 - got the p5 just sounds library reference
00:22 - in your index of HTML file if you're
00:24 - downloading any of my code off the link
00:26 - on github it will already be there but
00:28 - what I'm what I'm talking about here is
00:30 - you want to make sure that in addition
00:34 - to the p5 a reference to the actual p5
00:37 - just library itself you have a reference
00:39 - to p5 dot sound digest and you have that
00:42 - file in your directory of JavaScript
00:45 - files that you're using I'm also using
00:46 - the Dom library for the sliders and that
00:48 - sort of things and that leads me to the
00:50 - next thing that I forgot that I want to
00:51 - mention which is there is a highly
00:55 - convenient function in wit that goes
00:58 - along with the sound file called is
01:00 - playing and the isblank function just
01:03 - returns true or false
01:05 - whether the saw sound is playing or
01:07 - isn't playing and this actually comes up
01:09 - a lot we're actually going to see this
01:11 - in a future video that I have in mind
01:13 - where you have a sound effect that you
01:14 - want to like play over and over again
01:16 - and you don't want it to sound like this
01:18 - so you only want to like restart the
01:20 - playing if it's not already playing and
01:22 - as my camera shuts off just as I'm
01:25 - talking to you ok so let me come back
01:28 - over here and let's just let the add a
01:30 - feature to this let's create a button
01:33 - and I'm going to say button equals
01:37 - create button and I'm going to say play
01:40 - and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
01:44 - also then say button dot Mouse pressed
01:49 - play oh whoops
01:52 - I'll become this toggle toggle playing
01:56 - so I'm going to write a function now
01:59 - where I'm going to toggle whether the
02:01 - sound is playing or not so I could just
02:05 - say song dot play right so in this sense
02:07 - this toggle play is the callback
02:09 - whenever I press the button the code in
02:11 - here will happen so in this sense if
02:13 - just run this right now you can hear the
02:16 - song is not playing but if I click play
02:20 - do you hear it I don't hear it why is
02:27 - that oh whoops
02:30 - I've already playing it here what's
02:31 - going on here let's try this again hold
02:35 - on we're gonna make this work let's look
02:36 - at the code here I'm loading the sound I
02:39 - don't actually really care about the
02:41 - callback so much right now because
02:43 - conceivably by the time I hit the button
02:45 - it'll be ready to play create button
02:48 - play button mouse press toggle playing
02:50 - and when I press that button I should
02:52 - hear song play now I'm going to just
02:54 - wait to set the volume until here
02:56 - because I think that makes more sense -
02:58 - oops loaded is not defined so just in
03:01 - case I'm gonna have an empty call I'm
03:04 - gonna just say I'm gonna list log swing
03:08 - to the console now the song is loaded
03:12 - and I hit play I muted my tab
03:19 - I can't really like edit this but I use
03:23 - gonna have to lose good I cleaned up my
03:25 - code a little bit and you did my tab
03:32 - oh I might've pulled something a little
03:37 - bit olden whatever okay thank you chat
03:40 - room for your kind help okay so I needed
03:43 - my tab but what I want to do is while
03:46 - it's playing I want this change to
03:48 - change to pause and then when I press it
03:51 - it'll change back to play okay so let's
03:54 - go back and here so what do I want to do
03:56 - here in toggle play I want to say if not
04:00 - song is playing we're getting further in
04:06 - the song we ever had before
04:08 - so here now you see only if it's not
04:12 - playing play the song otherwise let's
04:18 - try song got pause and what do I want to
04:23 - do now I want my button
04:30 - to say play
04:33 - when it's playing I want the button to
04:36 - say pause so now in addition to whether
04:39 - it's playing or not playing it or
04:41 - pausing it I'm going to have this video
04:45 - by the way is not about jump or add cue
04:47 - I'll put that in the next thing this is
04:48 - just a follow-up video with stopping and
04:50 - starting it is playing that's that's
04:52 - what this video is okay so now I'm gonna
04:54 - hit refresh and you can see it says play
04:56 - and I press play we hear the song it's
05:00 - about to come in and then I'm getting
05:03 - ready feeling it oh we're playing what's
05:05 - that trees dance you guys have kids
05:07 - is that what's called musical freeze
05:09 - whatever so you're you're dancing you're
05:12 - dancing you're dancing there you have to
05:14 - freeze and it says play okay so you get
05:20 - the idea so I can play and pause it now
05:23 - interestingly enough I used pause
05:24 - because when I play it again it's gonna
05:26 - pick up from where it last left off but
05:29 - if I were to change this to stop and
05:33 - change that to stop also and hit play
05:38 - what's gonna play now if I press stop
05:43 - it's like it's paused but when I hit
05:46 - play again it's gonna have gone back to
05:48 - the beginning so that's a key difference
05:50 - but stop function stops it from playing
05:53 - but rewinds back to the beginning
05:56 - whereas the pause function stops it from
05:57 - playing but keeps the play at at a
05:59 - current moment in time okay so I'm gonna
06:01 - let this video and here we added these
06:02 - features to it of just the play and
06:04 - pause button that's what this video is
06:05 - how to add a play and pause button and
06:08 - in the next video I'm going to look at
06:09 - jump and add cue how to how to like deal
06:12 - with sort of time in a particular piece
06:14 - of music

hello and welcome to part two of my videos about sound in p5.js now I forgot a few things in my previous video that I want to briefly mention so the first thing I want to mention and let me just mute this tab here is that when you're working with sound in p5.js you want to make sure that you've also got the p5 just sounds library reference in your index of HTML file if you're downloading any of my

have a reference to p5 dot sound digest and you have that file in your directory of JavaScript files that you're using I'm also using the Dom library for the sliders and that sort of things and that leads me to the next thing that I forgot that I want to mention which is there is a highly convenient function in wit that goes along with the sound file called is playing and the isblank function just returns true or false whether the saw sound is playing or isn't playing and this actually comes up a lot we're actually going to see this in a future video that I have in mind where you have a sound effect that you want to like play over and over again and you don't want it to sound like this so you only want to like restart the playing if it's not already playing and as my camera shuts off just as I'm talking to you ok so let me come back over here and let's just let the add a feature to this let's create a button and I'm going to say button equals create button and I'm going to say play and what I'm going to do is I'm going to also then say button dot Mouse pressed play oh whoops I'll become this toggle toggle playing so I'm going to write a function now where I'm going to

okay so let's go back and here so what do I want to do here in toggle play I want to say if not song is playing we're getting further in the song we ever had before so here now you see only if it's not playing play the song otherwise let's try song got pause and what do I want to do now I want my button to say play when it's playing I want the button to say pause so now in addition to whether it's playing or not playing it or pausing it I'm going to have this video by the way is not about jump or add cue I'll put that in the next thing this is just a followup video with stopping and starting it is playing that's that's what this video is okay so now I'm gonna hit refresh and you can see it says play and I press play we hear the song it's about to come in and then I'm getting
