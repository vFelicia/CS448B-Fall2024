00:00 - hello welcome to another session for the
00:05 - course programming from A to Z and
00:07 - accept accept if you're watching this
00:10 - video it's called programming with text
00:12 - on YouTube because programming from A to
00:15 - Z sounds like it's a beginner course and
00:17 - this course is really for people have
00:19 - already gone through my foundations of
00:20 - JavaScript stuff and I want to do more
00:22 - things with programming with text
00:24 - generating text analyzing text and a lot
00:26 - of different things like that so one of
00:29 - the what what is this playlist going to
00:31 - be about this playlist is about Chrome
00:34 - extensions and words that I can't say
00:36 - bookmarklets I like to say bookmark lay
00:39 - know that does make any sense I was like
00:41 - the French for the book Barclay no
00:43 - bookmarklets it's very hard to say
00:45 - bookmarklets so why is why is this
00:47 - interesting why is this important so all
00:50 - of my sessions in this particular course
00:54 - have all been about I mean this is not
00:57 - entirely true but this is a web browser
01:00 - the sessions have all been about
01:02 - programming kind of what happens inside
01:05 - here inside the actual content of the
01:09 - page by creating your own I know it's a
01:13 - vacuum cleaner because I live in the
01:15 - real world where the things happen like
01:17 - vacuuming but I'm gonna just go on my
01:22 - own eyes my mind lives in its own
01:25 - universe though which hopefully makes
01:27 - these videos somewhat watchable but or
01:29 - not anyway so this is what we've been
01:31 - focusing on and maybe you make an HTML
01:35 - file and a JavaScript file all sorts of
01:39 - things to make things happen in here but
01:42 - working in working with text so you make
01:44 - a web page it generates a poem and it
01:46 - makes a chatbot with the user all these
01:48 - kinds of things that I've looked at
01:50 - analyzes text that a user typed in but
01:53 - what if what you really want to do is
01:55 - affect the browsing experience as a
01:58 - whole so what if what you want to do is
02:01 - say when the user is on the website
02:03 - github or when the user is on the
02:06 - website of a particular newspaper their
02:08 - experience the that users experience of
02:11 - browsing that web
02:12 - age changes now this is typically done
02:16 - and so a way to do this is with two
02:19 - different things one is called a book
02:22 - mark lint which is a way of creating a
02:26 - simple bookmark button that can live up
02:29 - here that can run some JavaScript code
02:32 - to alter and change your view of the
02:36 - current web page you're on the other is
02:39 - called a Chrome extension now you can
02:43 - imagine here the reason one sort of one
02:47 - what limitation of me making this
02:50 - tutorial video is that it is a Chrome
02:52 - extension it is only for the browser
02:54 - Chrome but it allows you to essentially
02:58 - make if you think about chrome like you
03:00 - might think about your phone you could
03:02 - develop an app for your phone to alter
03:04 - your experience of using your phone a
03:06 - Chrome extension is like an app for the
03:08 - web browser Chrome itself that allows
03:10 - you to alter the behavior of the browser
03:12 - beyond just what's happening in the page
03:14 - so you can add interface elements you
03:16 - can know about what people are typing
03:18 - into the address bar you can create a
03:21 - page that shows up whenever somebody has
03:23 - a new tab you could know that somebody
03:25 - said new tab you could know you could
03:27 - you could pop up a timer whenever our
03:29 - user is on you know some sort of like
03:32 - social media website to tell them you
03:35 - only have five more minutes to look at
03:36 - this website and then close the tab for
03:37 - them anything you could do to alter
03:40 - subvert change the browsing experience
03:42 - now this exists as a business model
03:45 - because companies can make Chrome
03:47 - extensions to you know offer you a
03:49 - coupon or I don't know have pop-up chat
03:54 - pop-up that get offers to give you help
03:56 - on that page I use a Chrome extension
03:57 - called two buddy I'm now projecting out
03:59 - by accident promoting which gives me
04:01 - extra features to see how to manipulate
04:04 - and know my stats and all the sort of
04:06 - stuff while I'm browsing YouTube so
04:08 - that's really but what I want to think
04:10 - about in this playlist are this idea I'm
04:14 - just gonna call it for lack of a better
04:15 - word creative Chrome extensions so what
04:18 - if you use a crow what if you create a
04:20 - Chrome extension to subvert distort
04:22 - change our browsing experience for the
04:25 - purpose of social commentary
04:26 - or art or activism and I should mention
04:29 - there's something important about this
04:31 - this is not something that you can just
04:33 - put on somebody's computer you can make
04:35 - a webpage put it on a web server email
04:38 - all your friends they come to my webpage
04:40 - but you you can't put a Chrome extension
04:43 - on somebody's computer without them
04:45 - opting into that we'll see that in a
04:47 - moment as we look at the Chrome
04:48 - extension
04:49 - store however I'm not really in this
04:51 - playlist going to focus at all about how
04:53 - you can deploy your Chrome extension to
04:55 - the store I'm gonna show you how to use
04:57 - a Chrome extension in what's called
04:59 - developer mode so you can write and
05:02 - create and debug and edit and change
05:04 - your Chrome extension right there on
05:06 - your own computer if it's something that
05:09 - you then want to distribute you can
05:11 - package it and put it into the chrome
05:13 - store and I'm just super some kind of
05:15 - approval process there but we're gonna
05:17 - stay with a sort of local development
05:18 - environment so this is kind of the
05:21 - overall picture and so in the first two
05:25 - first tutorial what I'm going to do is
05:28 - has a warm up kind of looking a
05:30 - bookmarklet which is kind of a much
05:34 - simpler lower look lower barrier of
05:38 - entry point to just do something
05:40 - interesting with manipulating the
05:41 - browsing experience so I'm gonna start
05:43 - with that and that so if you--if you
05:44 - want to get to the code stuff you can
05:46 - stop this video now just go to the next
05:47 - one but what I'm going to do before I
05:51 - get to that is let's look at some
05:52 - examples of some different Chrome
05:54 - extensions all right so let's look at a
05:56 - couple examples of things that I'm
05:57 - thinking about this is a bookmarklet
06:00 - called the deletion ascent to me on
06:03 - Twitter and I believe it actually
06:05 - relates to something that I did a
06:07 - previous video about erase your poetry
06:08 - kind of which is that let's try it so a
06:11 - bookmarklet is a thing that I can drag
06:14 - into the bookmark bar and then in theory
06:18 - when I press this button ooh
06:21 - it got rid of stuff so let's go to let's
06:26 - go to github.com and let me click the
06:31 - deletion nest well and it got rid this
06:33 - is actually very very similar to one of
06:35 - my favorite bookmarklets called wordless
06:38 - web which actually gets rid of
06:40 - everything on a webpage that is text
06:42 - which has some really surprising and
06:44 - interesting effects trying to think of
06:46 - one more website that's not going to
06:49 - make me feel so awkward and
06:50 - uncomfortable to go to to demonstrate
06:53 - this idea but anyway I encourage you to
06:56 - play with the deletion so this is
06:57 - something I'm Mabel will make a
06:59 - bookmarklet that replaces every image on
07:02 - the webpage with like kitten kitten
07:04 - images or something like that we'll do
07:05 - that another Chrome extension that I
07:09 - wanted to show you is by one of my
07:10 - favorite artists um addy wagenknecht her
07:14 - website is places I've never been calm
07:16 - this is a Chrome extension that she
07:18 - created called girls versus get I'll
07:21 - just read to you what it does every
07:23 - username on github is replaced with a
07:25 - generic female username every Gravatar
07:27 - is a place with a Gravatar of a woman or
07:29 - female type image why there is a death
07:33 - of women contribute to open source
07:34 - software this plug-in is presented as a
07:35 - filter to challenge assumptions about
07:37 - gender roles and software and to rewire
07:39 - your brain so you can see here you can
07:41 - imagine this is a chrome one something
07:43 - you can do with a Chrome extension is it
07:45 - only activates when you're on certain
07:46 - web pages and changes your view of that
07:49 - web page and so you can see this is uh
07:51 - this is on github I will include links
07:54 - to all these chrome extensions and
07:55 - bookmarklets in the video description
07:59 - I'm going to come back to wordless web
08:01 - this is a Chrome extension that was
08:04 - submitted by I'm just want to make sure
08:08 - I have the right name looking in the
08:10 - slack channel here
08:12 - I believe sorry Noah van boven I
08:16 - apologize for pronouncing the name
08:18 - incorrectly called
08:19 - web paint let's try adding it so if you
08:21 - make a Chrome extension that's in the
08:23 - actual chrome extension store you can
08:27 - just go and hit add to Chrome now here's
08:30 - something really important this is what
08:32 - I mean by opting in Chrome extensions
08:35 - get a lot more permission to do stuff
08:37 - beyond what you would normally have just
08:39 - in a generic regular web page so if this
08:42 - Chrome extension says it can read and
08:44 - change all your data on the websites you
08:46 - visit presumably this has been vetted by
08:48 - Google I suppose and
08:50 - in the chrome store because it doesn't
08:51 - do stuff like you know steal all your
08:54 - passwords but this is certainly other
08:57 - certainly security and privacy issues
08:59 - that are at play here but I'm gonna add
09:01 - this extension and then what I'm going
09:05 - to do is I'm going to go back to
09:06 - github.com Schiffman a-to-z I'm gonna
09:10 - let know one thing a Chrome extension
09:11 - can do and we're gonna see this is you
09:13 - can add menu options to the menu like
09:16 - this button so now I'm gonna click this
09:19 - button oh wait look you can even do a
09:22 - pop-up all I'm gonna show you how to do
09:23 - pop-ups too and I'm gonna pick this
09:26 - pencil and now I'm gonna just start
09:28 - doodling or it's so this is by the way
09:30 - this is very similar to a what else can
09:34 - we do this is so fun this is way better
09:36 - than my example ah anyway I clicked off
09:38 - of it but you can see this is something
09:39 - that I intend to make as part of this
09:42 - playlist a Chrome extension that allows
09:43 - you use p5.js to draw and make a canvas
09:47 - overlay over your over the webpage that
09:51 - you're currently browsing on ok another
09:53 - Chrome extension is one called code
09:56 - doodles this is something you can do - I
09:58 - forgot what it's called but to create a
10:01 - webpage that appears so right now if I
10:02 - make a new tab I don't have a Chrome
10:04 - extension that replaces the default
10:07 - chrome new tab which just shows me the
10:09 - Google search bar and some recently
10:10 - visited sites but momentum is another
10:13 - one all my students will have this one I
10:15 - should probably install it let's try the
10:16 - code doodles one so I'm going to add
10:18 - this one it says this one all I can do
10:20 - is replace the page you see when opening
10:22 - a new tab add extension and so now every
10:27 - time I make a new tab I get whoa I get
10:30 - some cool interesting code doodle
10:34 - project oh so I would have to research
10:38 - this more - no credits wise like who
10:41 - these are coming from I wonder if it's
10:44 - still oh it's loading wow these are all
10:45 - like super crazy WebGL 3d things which
10:48 - is kind of wild so so you can see the
10:51 - range of possibilities this is a Chrome
10:53 - extension by Melanie Hoff called deco
10:56 - Delia and I don't know if I pronounced
10:58 - that right it's a Chrome extension and
10:59 - glasses set that uses basic principles
11:01 - of color theory to read
11:03 - your browsers content visible only with
11:05 - the use of rennes red tinted glasses so
11:07 - you can see here I can't see what's
11:09 - going on here but if I happen to have
11:11 - the red tinted glasses so I could
11:13 - essentially if I'm in a coffee shop and
11:16 - I didn't want anybody to see what I'm
11:17 - doing I could wear my glasses and use my
11:20 - computer without anyone be able to see
11:21 - you know this is probably a nice video
11:23 - summary Melanie is an alum of both the
11:26 - school for a point of computation and
11:28 - ITP the graduate program where I teach
11:30 - so I encourage you to check out this
11:32 - wonderful Chrome extension I just want
11:35 - to see if there's a right so so you can
11:37 - search for some like things on your so
11:41 - this is obviously a kind of like an art
11:43 - project but it actually does work I've
11:45 - seen it it's great but I also want to
11:48 - mention a wordless Web which is one of
11:51 - my favorite projects very similar to the
11:56 - wordless web sorry by Corey Forsythe and
12:01 - Gigli which this is a Chrome extension
12:04 - that takes whatever website you're on so
12:06 - you can see this is an image of Facebook
12:07 - and just gets rid of all the words and
12:09 - all you're left with are just the images
12:12 - be interesting to think about doing one
12:13 - that does the others so I hope this
12:15 - video gives you kind of a general
12:17 - introduction to the it's the words
12:19 - diagram ever overview of why it is we're
12:22 - here and a range of some kind of
12:24 - creative and artistic possibilities and
12:26 - what I'm gonna do in the next bunch of
12:28 - videos is just really go through the
12:30 - nuts and bolts of how to make these
12:32 - things and then at some point hopefully
12:34 - towards the end I'll do a couple coding
12:36 - challenges to make some quirky Chrome
12:38 - extension or bookmarklet projects okay
12:41 - thanks for watching and I'll see you
12:42 - maybe in the next video
12:48 - [Music]
12:53 - you

Cleaned transcript:

hello welcome to another session for the course programming from A to Z and accept accept if you're watching this video it's called programming with text on YouTube because programming from A to Z sounds like it's a beginner course and this course is really for people have already gone through my foundations of JavaScript stuff and I want to do more things with programming with text generating text analyzing text and a lot of different things like that so one of the what what is this playlist going to be about this playlist is about Chrome extensions and words that I can't say bookmarklets I like to say bookmark lay know that does make any sense I was like the French for the book Barclay no bookmarklets it's very hard to say bookmarklets so why is why is this interesting why is this important so all of my sessions in this particular course have all been about I mean this is not entirely true but this is a web browser the sessions have all been about programming kind of what happens inside here inside the actual content of the page by creating your own I know it's a vacuum cleaner because I live in the real world where the things happen like vacuuming but I'm gonna just go on my own eyes my mind lives in its own universe though which hopefully makes these videos somewhat watchable but or not anyway so this is what we've been focusing on and maybe you make an HTML file and a JavaScript file all sorts of things to make things happen in here but working in working with text so you make a web page it generates a poem and it makes a chatbot with the user all these kinds of things that I've looked at analyzes text that a user typed in but what if what you really want to do is affect the browsing experience as a whole so what if what you want to do is say when the user is on the website github or when the user is on the website of a particular newspaper their experience the that users experience of browsing that web age changes now this is typically done and so a way to do this is with two different things one is called a book mark lint which is a way of creating a simple bookmark button that can live up here that can run some JavaScript code to alter and change your view of the current web page you're on the other is called a Chrome extension now you can imagine here the reason one sort of one what limitation of me making this tutorial video is that it is a Chrome extension it is only for the browser Chrome but it allows you to essentially make if you think about chrome like you might think about your phone you could develop an app for your phone to alter your experience of using your phone a Chrome extension is like an app for the web browser Chrome itself that allows you to alter the behavior of the browser beyond just what's happening in the page so you can add interface elements you can know about what people are typing into the address bar you can create a page that shows up whenever somebody has a new tab you could know that somebody said new tab you could know you could you could pop up a timer whenever our user is on you know some sort of like social media website to tell them you only have five more minutes to look at this website and then close the tab for them anything you could do to alter subvert change the browsing experience now this exists as a business model because companies can make Chrome extensions to you know offer you a coupon or I don't know have popup chat popup that get offers to give you help on that page I use a Chrome extension called two buddy I'm now projecting out by accident promoting which gives me extra features to see how to manipulate and know my stats and all the sort of stuff while I'm browsing YouTube so that's really but what I want to think about in this playlist are this idea I'm just gonna call it for lack of a better word creative Chrome extensions so what if you use a crow what if you create a Chrome extension to subvert distort change our browsing experience for the purpose of social commentary or art or activism and I should mention there's something important about this this is not something that you can just put on somebody's computer you can make a webpage put it on a web server email all your friends they come to my webpage but you you can't put a Chrome extension on somebody's computer without them opting into that we'll see that in a moment as we look at the Chrome extension store however I'm not really in this playlist going to focus at all about how you can deploy your Chrome extension to the store I'm gonna show you how to use a Chrome extension in what's called developer mode so you can write and create and debug and edit and change your Chrome extension right there on your own computer if it's something that you then want to distribute you can package it and put it into the chrome store and I'm just super some kind of approval process there but we're gonna stay with a sort of local development environment so this is kind of the overall picture and so in the first two first tutorial what I'm going to do is has a warm up kind of looking a bookmarklet which is kind of a much simpler lower look lower barrier of entry point to just do something interesting with manipulating the browsing experience so I'm gonna start with that and that so if youif you want to get to the code stuff you can stop this video now just go
