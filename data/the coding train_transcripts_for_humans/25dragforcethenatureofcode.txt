00:01 - okay now that we've looked at friction I
00:04 - want to look at another case study of a
00:07 - formula that we defined in a physics
00:08 - textbook and how we could unpack and
00:10 - understand that formula and apply it in
00:12 - a piece of code in a processing
00:14 - simulation you know with circle moving
00:16 - around the screen because that's what we
00:17 - do with our lives we sit around and we
00:19 - move circles around the screen okay so
00:21 - what I want to look at is a drag force
00:23 - now drag force also known as viscous
00:26 - force fluid resistance air resistance
00:29 - we're talking about a force when a body
00:31 - comes into contact with a liquid or gas
00:33 - it experiences a force again in the
00:35 - opposite direction something falling
00:37 - experiences an air resistance of force
00:39 - pushing it back up so let's take a look
00:42 - at the first so it's very similar to
00:44 - friction conceptually but it actually is
00:45 - a operates in a different way which is
00:47 - kind of interesting to look at so let's
00:49 - take a look at the formula okay first of
00:54 - all have to remember this formula and I
00:56 - might fail but I'm gonna give this a try
00:57 - okay the force of drag I have a way of
01:00 - looking it up equals plus I go is just
01:04 - start this video over negative one half
01:06 - times Rho times V squared which I really
01:11 - mean the magnitude of velocity the
01:13 - velocity squared the speed squared maybe
01:16 - I'll put do this times a times the
01:21 - coefficient of drag times velocity unit
01:27 - vector okay look at this formula oh this
01:33 - one really looks awful right like how
01:35 - are we gonna figure out all these pieces
01:36 - but you know it's axe first of all the
01:39 - formula itself is really simple it's
01:41 - this times this times this times this
01:43 - times this times this so if we just know
01:45 - what each one of those things are we
01:47 - just multiply them all together you know
01:49 - it looks a little fancy because it's
01:50 - kind of like got some Greek letters in
01:51 - it and we don't know what all these
01:52 - things that has one row but and I didn't
01:54 - even write that very well but the point
01:57 - is these formulas actually aren't that
01:58 - difficult to understand even if they
02:00 - look a little bit kind of unapproachable
02:03 - but the thing about this formula we have
02:06 - to ask ourselves is what do we really
02:08 - need here so what are all the elements
02:11 - of this form
02:12 - okay well negative 1/2 that's clearly a
02:16 - constant roh-roh stands for density so
02:23 - density you can think of as you know how
02:26 - dense the material is that you're moving
02:28 - through air versus water versus mud
02:32 - versus something else v squared so V is
02:36 - the velocity the magnitude the velocity
02:37 - squared the magnitude of velocity
02:39 - squared magnitude of velocity you can
02:40 - think of a speed how fast is something
02:42 - going I'm recording so that's kind of
02:46 - interesting right we can see just by
02:48 - this formula here that the faster
02:51 - something is moving the more air
02:52 - resistance it will more sorry drag it
02:55 - will experience that is a very important
02:58 - factor right in fact it's such an
03:00 - important fact that something have is a
03:04 - different Clementine that's the same
03:05 - line that this Clementine right if it's
03:08 - not moving right now if I could hold it
03:10 - perfectly still no drag resistance on it
03:14 - whatsoever only if it's moving
03:15 - is it experiencing that force and the
03:17 - faster it's moving the stronger that
03:20 - force this is very important and this is
03:23 - kind of like the thing about all of this
03:25 - is and I need to say this at the
03:26 - appropriate time but I'm just gonna say
03:27 - it now the point of looking at this
03:30 - stuff is not because aha you want to
03:33 - make interesting things in processing
03:34 - and programming and graphics fluid
03:38 - resistance is the answer to everything
03:39 - you ever imagined that's not at all the
03:41 - case here this is just saying like look
03:44 - if we can understand how to do this
03:46 - number one a we can invent our own
03:48 - forces and B we might be able to find
03:50 - other forces and be able to understand
03:52 - how to unpack those formulas and use
03:53 - them so it's really not about using this
03:55 - particular force but you know in these
03:57 - videos I gotta have something to start
03:59 - with so this is really why I like to say
04:00 - sort of like a case study and looking at
04:02 - something but what's really I think
04:03 - useful about this in particulars
04:05 - realizing I could have something that's
04:07 - tied to an object's probably the
04:09 - properties of that object a force that's
04:11 - tied to how fast it moves how big it is
04:13 - what color it is there's so many things
04:15 - that you could kind of choose to do in a
04:17 - creative way so but here the speed
04:20 - squared a so this is speed squared
04:24 - a is a surface-area right there's a big
04:30 - difference in the air resistance this
04:35 - will experience versus this will
04:37 - experience this really aerodynamic dry
04:40 - erase marker versus the kind of surface
04:43 - area on the bottom of this Clementine is
04:44 - much larger than the pointy end of this
04:47 - marker terrible you know I don't know
04:50 - what did physics people who teach
04:51 - physics must have all these like props
04:53 - and things to demonstrate with this like
04:55 - clementines okay so the good see how
04:57 - surface area is important and then aha
04:59 - coefficient of drag this is the
05:02 - coefficient of drag well again this is
05:07 - just like the coefficient of friction
05:08 - what are the two things that are coming
05:10 - in contact with each other what what's
05:13 - what's the liquid or gas what's the
05:14 - object there's a coefficient there that
05:16 - will describe the strength of that force
05:17 - and then you know velocity unit vector
05:20 - because AHA there's a negative here and
05:22 - there's a velocity unit vector we're
05:24 - going in the opposite direction of our
05:26 - velocity so a cold by the way do you
05:30 - tell coming on okay so looking at all
05:35 - this stuff let's ask ourselves a
05:36 - question what is the density I have an
05:41 - idea the density is 1 what is the
05:44 - surface area I have an idea the surface
05:47 - area is 1 like we might someday have a
05:50 - simulation where we really want to model
05:52 - that where we have strangely shaped
05:54 - polygons and the actual and as they're
05:56 - moving through this like liquidy thing
05:58 - and the surface area actually makes a
05:59 - difference in how they move but right
06:01 - now if you recall you have a circle or
06:03 - gray circle moving around the surface
06:06 - area it's gonna be the same for all the
06:07 - circles whatever let's not worry about
06:09 - it let's make our let let's make we just
06:12 - want it to look kind of like air
06:13 - resistance so let's just make our life
06:14 - easier let's set that equal to 1 but
06:18 - really you know that's a constant that's
06:20 - a constant negative 1/2 as a constant
06:22 - coefficient drag is a constant all of
06:24 - these things are constants we could
06:27 - really simplify this formula to say we
06:30 - have negative some constant times the
06:36 - sorry the velocity
06:38 - squared times the velocity unit vector
06:42 - right we could simplify the form and say
06:44 - all of these things are constants we
06:46 - just need we just need to know is the a
06:48 - is the fluid is the drag force strong or
06:50 - weak is it like water jelly light
06:56 - refreshing air I don't know what is it
06:58 - is it strong or weak how fast is it
07:00 - going and what's the direction so this
07:02 - is really good and we can just we can
07:03 - start to we can start to write our code
07:06 - now we can start to say what is the
07:08 - again we need to know direction and
07:10 - magnitude same thing as friction
07:11 - direction and magnitude well the truth
07:13 - of the matter is I wish I hadn't erased
07:15 - what we had there before because
07:16 - Direction is exactly the same thing we
07:20 - want to I'm gonna call this drag we want
07:23 - to get velocity we want to normalize
07:31 - velocity and then we want to multiply it
07:36 - by negative one that's getting the
07:40 - direction we've taken care of the
07:43 - direction the force again remember what
07:45 - we're doing here whenever we want to
07:46 - calculate a force we need to know what
07:48 - ways the force pointing and how strong
07:49 - is it first let's get the direction
07:51 - let's get a unit vector pointing in the
07:52 - right direction
07:53 - then let's calculate the magnitude and
07:55 - let's scale that vector now we need to
07:57 - calculate the magnitude what is the
07:58 - magnitude well we did earlier up here we
08:02 - got a copy of the velocity vector so we
08:04 - probably couldn't might make sense to
08:06 - insert a line of code up there where we
08:08 - say speed equals that velocities
08:15 - magnitude right next we don't need to
08:18 - put it up there because we can just do
08:20 - it down here speed equals that
08:21 - velocities magnitude and then some
08:24 - constant C equals you know some value
08:30 - 0.01 and now drag we just need to
08:34 - multiply it by that constant times the
08:37 - speed times the speed right we've got
08:42 - the form we've got the formula formula
08:44 - boils down to a constant times the speed
08:46 - squared times the content of speed
08:50 - squared times the velocity unit vector
08:51 - and the opposite
08:52 - we already got the vector in the
08:53 - opposite direction now we have the
08:56 - magnitude is a constant times the speed
08:58 - times the speed speed squared great we
09:00 - did it it's really as simple as doing
09:02 - this and this I hopefully will give us
09:05 - some interesting results that we can
09:07 - look at so let's try to apply this now
09:09 - in our code or it's gonna rewrite
09:10 - exactly what we mapped out here into our
09:12 - code okay we're back and we're looking
09:15 - at this and we're kind of gonna do the
09:17 - same thing I'm gonna rename it drag and
09:19 - I'm also need to get the speed that's
09:22 - the only thing we don't have from before
09:24 - am i over here yeah the speed is the
09:27 - Ville of the movers velocity magnitude
09:30 - and then and actually you know what's
09:33 - kind of amazing about things sometimes I
09:37 - don't know this is not amazing but it
09:39 - just occurred to me right I could say
09:41 - speed equals speed times two right now
09:43 - now times two uh this video I really
09:46 - should restart it speed equals speed
09:48 - times speed I could say speed times
09:50 - speed but and that's what I should do I
09:53 - don't know what but there is by the way
09:55 - a function in processing yeah maybe it's
10:02 - just not and maybe it's just not turning
10:03 - blue because it's not in yeah it's fine
10:06 - um so there's a function called mag sq
10:08 - which actually gives you the magnitude
10:09 - squared so we could actually ask the
10:13 - velocity vector to give us its speed
10:15 - squared just from it but III thought I
10:18 - went off on a tangent there and somebody
10:19 - will download this video and edit this
10:21 - part out and then send it to me but and
10:24 - then we're back right here and we're
10:25 - looking at the magnitude and now we're
10:28 - going to say hey let's multiply to scale
10:30 - it according to the coefficient of drag
10:33 - times speed squared and then let's apply
10:38 - that force to the object and now look
10:44 - okay so we have this thing falling
10:45 - bouncing up and down and as soon as I
10:47 - click the mouse we're gonna see a drag
10:49 - force and you can see that it actually
10:51 - it kind of it's a little bit
10:53 - overwhelmingly strong so let's just sort
10:56 - of tune it down a little bit tone it
10:58 - down a little bit and let's try it again
10:59 - but you can see you can see it kind of
11:05 - it's still pretty strong but you can see
11:06 - it's really working and what's
11:08 - interesting about it is it almost
11:10 - reaches this what you might look like a
11:12 - terminal velocity and this is what
11:14 - happens there's a point where the air is
11:17 - when something is falling where the air
11:19 - resistance and the force of gravity
11:21 - become essentially equal and so there's
11:24 - the net result of those two forces is
11:27 - zero and the object falls at a constant
11:29 - velocity right because the faster and
11:31 - faster it's going air resistance gets
11:33 - gets larger and larger and larger
11:35 - because the speed is part of that air
11:37 - resistance magnitude so let me just so
11:39 - you can see one thing that I should
11:40 - point out about these examples is I'm
11:41 - just kind of like writing some code
11:43 - getting velocities make it to Forces
11:45 - blah blah blah blah blah here in the
11:46 - main program where are we we're in draw
11:48 - right we have a mover we make a new
11:50 - mover we say update edges display for
11:52 - this mover and you know somewhere here
11:54 - I'm calculating this drag force but
11:55 - really there's a plenty better
11:57 - object-oriented programming way that we
11:58 - could do this and I just want to look at
12:00 - that here's an example that I'm going to
12:02 - show you this is an example two point
12:04 - five in the book and what's one thing
12:06 - about this that I think is useful to
12:07 - look at is that first of all the objects
12:10 - they don't experience air resistance
12:11 - here they're only experiencing a fluid
12:13 - resistance when they land in when they
12:16 - when they're in this sort of darker area
12:18 - at the bottom so you can see that
12:20 - they're falling at this speed and then
12:21 - they slow down when they hit there and
12:22 - what's interesting about this is the
12:24 - smaller ones right D so much more slowly
12:28 - than the larger ones why is that
12:30 - remember acceleration equals force
12:32 - divided by mass so they may all
12:34 - experience the same drag force but their
12:37 - accelerations can be scaled according to
12:38 - how big they are the bigger ones are
12:40 - able to like plow right through that
12:41 - liquid which the smaller ones aren't
12:44 - able to do that as easily but what I
12:46 - wanted to look at this though is just to
12:48 - say look you can't really see this but
12:50 - there is up here now a liquid class so
12:53 - in addition to a mover I've made a
12:55 - liquid class and the liquid class
12:57 - describes this kind of rectangular area
12:59 - here and if we look at it we can see the
13:02 - liquid has an X Y a width and height in
13:05 - a coefficient of drag so it's defining
13:06 - an area and a coefficient how strong is
13:09 - it and what's interesting about this as
13:12 - you can see we have some functions if
13:14 - the liquid contains the mover then the
13:18 - liquid to dry
13:19 - that mover so we've taken that formula
13:22 - we learned and we put it into a function
13:25 - essentially inside the liquid class this
13:30 - is a function which says let me receive
13:32 - a mover let me calculate that drag force
13:34 - through all the methodology we just did
13:37 - and then return it back so this is
13:39 - actually quite a useful thing when you
13:41 - want objects to exert forces on each
13:44 - other
13:44 - you need one object to receive as an
13:47 - argument another object and then compute
13:50 - that force and then apply it or return
13:52 - it or whatever the sort of structure
13:54 - you're doing is so the perhaps sometime
13:57 - this merits kind of its own video or
13:59 - discussion about how objects might talk
14:02 - to each other in a way and that's really
14:03 - what we're doing here I don't know maybe
14:05 - I'll hear from some people to hear
14:07 - whether this is unclear and we need some
14:08 - to sort of elaborate on this but that's
14:11 - what I wanted to point out about this
14:12 - particular video so one thing you might
14:15 - do now is take a look at this and see
14:16 - could you create a more elaborate
14:18 - scenario could you create a larger sort
14:20 - of space on the screen with all sorts of
14:22 - different pockets of resistance some
14:26 - weak some strong and what if you made
14:28 - something that actually sort of weirdly
14:29 - caused the object to speed up as it goes
14:31 - through it this sort of like inverse
14:33 - drag force I mean that may not really
14:35 - exist in the world but you could sort of
14:37 - think of some type of interactive system
14:39 - that you could make where you're trying
14:40 - to avoid the parts that slow you down
14:42 - and get into the parts that speed you up
14:44 - so these are some ideas for some things
14:46 - you might want to play around with in
14:47 - looking through and these formulas these
14:50 - examples or something okay uh thank you
14:54 - for listening I very grateful I really
14:57 - but noise brought it you know it's Riya
14:59 - at this point anymore so no one just
15:01 - heard me say that but that's fine you
15:02 - don't need to hear any of this okay
15:03 - goodbye I'll see you again in
15:05 - momentarily perhaps in the next video or
15:07 - Never I don't know if I'm really seeing
15:08 - I'm gonna press the button now

Cleaned transcript:

okay now that we've looked at friction I want to look at another case study of a formula that we defined in a physics textbook and how we could unpack and understand that formula and apply it in a piece of code in a processing simulation you know with circle moving around the screen because that's what we do with our lives we sit around and we move circles around the screen okay so what I want to look at is a drag force now drag force also known as viscous force fluid resistance air resistance we're talking about a force when a body comes into contact with a liquid or gas it experiences a force again in the opposite direction something falling experiences an air resistance of force pushing it back up so let's take a look at the first so it's very similar to friction conceptually but it actually is a operates in a different way which is kind of interesting to look at so let's take a look at the formula okay first of all have to remember this formula and I might fail but I'm gonna give this a try okay the force of drag I have a way of looking it up equals plus I go is just start this video over negative one half times Rho times V squared which I really mean the magnitude of velocity the velocity squared the speed squared maybe I'll put do this times a times the coefficient of drag times velocity unit vector okay look at this formula oh this one really looks awful right like how are we gonna figure out all these pieces but you know it's axe first of all the formula itself is really simple it's this times this times this times this times this times this so if we just know what each one of those things are we just multiply them all together you know it looks a little fancy because it's kind of like got some Greek letters in it and we don't know what all these things that has one row but and I didn't even write that very well but the point is these formulas actually aren't that difficult to understand even if they look a little bit kind of unapproachable but the thing about this formula we have to ask ourselves is what do we really need here so what are all the elements of this form okay well negative 1/2 that's clearly a constant rohroh stands for density so density you can think of as you know how dense the material is that you're moving through air versus water versus mud versus something else v squared so V is the velocity the magnitude the velocity squared the magnitude of velocity squared magnitude of velocity you can think of a speed how fast is something going I'm recording so that's kind of interesting right we can see just by this formula here that the faster something is moving the more air resistance it will more sorry drag it will experience that is a very important factor right in fact it's such an important fact that something have is a different Clementine that's the same line that this Clementine right if it's not moving right now if I could hold it perfectly still no drag resistance on it whatsoever only if it's moving is it experiencing that force and the faster it's moving the stronger that force this is very important and this is kind of like the thing about all of this is and I need to say this at the appropriate time but I'm just gonna say it now the point of looking at this stuff is not because aha you want to make interesting things in processing and programming and graphics fluid resistance is the answer to everything you ever imagined that's not at all the case here this is just saying like look if we can understand how to do this number one a we can invent our own forces and B we might be able to find other forces and be able to understand how to unpack those formulas and use them so it's really not about using this particular force but you know in these videos I gotta have something to start with so this is really why I like to say sort of like a case study and looking at something but what's really I think useful about this in particulars realizing I could have something that's tied to an object's probably the properties of that object a force that's tied to how fast it moves how big it is what color it is there's so many things that you could kind of choose to do in a creative way so but here the speed squared a so this is speed squared a is a surfacearea right there's a big difference in the air resistance this will experience versus this will experience this really aerodynamic dry erase marker versus the kind of surface area on the bottom of this Clementine is much larger than the pointy end of this marker terrible you know I don't know what did physics people who teach physics must have all these like props and things to demonstrate with this like clementines okay so the good see how surface area is important and then aha coefficient of drag this is the coefficient of drag well again this is just like the coefficient of friction what are the two things that are coming in contact with each other what what's what's the liquid or gas what's the object there's a coefficient there that will describe the strength of that force and then you know velocity unit vector because AHA there's a negative here and there's a velocity unit vector we're going in the opposite direction of our velocity so a cold by the way do you tell coming on okay so looking at all this stuff let's ask ourselves a question what is the density I have an idea the density is 1 what is the surface area I have an idea the surface area is 1 like we might someday have a simulation where we really want to model that where we have strangely shaped polygons and the actual and as they're moving through this like liquidy thing and the surface area actually makes a difference in how they move but right now if you recall you have a circle or gray circle moving around the surface area it's gonna be the same for all the circles whatever let's not worry about it let's make our let let's make we just want it to look kind of like air resistance so let's just make our life easier let's set that equal to 1 but really you know that's a constant that's a constant negative 1/2 as a constant coefficient drag is a constant all of these things are constants we could really simplify this formula to say we have negative some constant times the sorry the velocity squared times the velocity unit vector right we could simplify the form and say all of these things are constants we just need we just need to know is the a is the fluid is the drag force strong or weak is it like water jelly light refreshing air I don't know what is it is it strong or weak how fast is it going and what's the direction so this is really good and we can just we can start to we can start to write our code now we can start to say what is the again we need to know direction and magnitude same thing as friction direction and magnitude well the truth of the matter is I wish I hadn't erased what we had there before because Direction is exactly the same thing we want to I'm gonna call this drag we want to get velocity we want to normalize velocity and then we want to multiply it by negative one that's getting the direction we've taken care of the direction the force again remember what we're doing here whenever we want to calculate a force we need to know what ways the force pointing and how strong is it first let's get the direction let's get a unit vector pointing in the right direction then let's calculate the magnitude and let's scale that vector now we need to calculate the magnitude what is the magnitude well we did earlier up here we got a copy of the velocity vector so we probably couldn't might make sense to insert a line of code up there where we say speed equals that velocities magnitude right next we don't need to put it up there because we can just do it down here speed equals that velocities magnitude and then some constant C equals you know some value 0.01 and now drag we just need to multiply it by that constant times the speed times the speed right we've got the form we've got the formula formula boils down to a constant times the speed squared times the content of speed squared times the velocity unit vector and the opposite we already got the vector in the opposite direction now we have the magnitude is a constant times the speed times the speed speed squared great we did it it's really as simple as doing this and this I hopefully will give us some interesting results that we can look at so let's try to apply this now in our code or it's gonna rewrite exactly what we mapped out here into our code okay we're back and we're looking at this and we're kind of gonna do the same thing I'm gonna rename it drag and I'm also need to get the speed that's the only thing we don't have from before am i over here yeah the speed is the Ville of the movers velocity magnitude and then and actually you know what's kind of amazing about things sometimes I don't know this is not amazing but it just occurred to me right I could say speed equals speed times two right now now times two uh this video I really should restart it speed equals speed times speed I could say speed times speed but and that's what I should do I don't know what but there is by the way a function in processing yeah maybe it's just not and maybe it's just not turning blue because it's not in yeah it's fine um so there's a function called mag sq which actually gives you the magnitude squared so we could actually ask the velocity vector to give us its speed squared just from it but III thought I went off on a tangent there and somebody will download this video and edit this part out and then send it to me but and then we're back right here and we're looking at the magnitude and now we're going to say hey let's multiply to scale it according to the coefficient of drag times speed squared and then let's apply that force to the object and now look okay so we have this thing falling bouncing up and down and as soon as I click the mouse we're gonna see a drag force and you can see that it actually it kind of it's a little bit overwhelmingly strong so let's just sort of tune it down a little bit tone it down a little bit and let's try it again but you can see you can see it kind of it's still pretty strong but you can see it's really working and what's interesting about it is it almost reaches this what you might look like a terminal velocity and this is what happens there's a point where the air is when something is falling where the air resistance and the force of gravity become essentially equal and so there's the net result of those two forces is zero and the object falls at a constant velocity right because the faster and faster it's going air resistance gets gets larger and larger and larger because the speed is part of that air resistance magnitude so let me just so you can see one thing that I should point out about these examples is I'm just kind of like writing some code getting velocities make it to Forces blah blah blah blah blah here in the main program where are we we're in draw right we have a mover we make a new mover we say update edges display for this mover and you know somewhere here I'm calculating this drag force but really there's a plenty better objectoriented programming way that we could do this and I just want to look at that here's an example that I'm going to show you this is an example two point five in the book and what's one thing about this that I think is useful to look at is that first of all the objects they don't experience air resistance here they're only experiencing a fluid resistance when they land in when they when they're in this sort of darker area at the bottom so you can see that they're falling at this speed and then they slow down when they hit there and what's interesting about this is the smaller ones right D so much more slowly than the larger ones why is that remember acceleration equals force divided by mass so they may all experience the same drag force but their accelerations can be scaled according to how big they are the bigger ones are able to like plow right through that liquid which the smaller ones aren't able to do that as easily but what I wanted to look at this though is just to say look you can't really see this but there is up here now a liquid class so in addition to a mover I've made a liquid class and the liquid class describes this kind of rectangular area here and if we look at it we can see the liquid has an X Y a width and height in a coefficient of drag so it's defining an area and a coefficient how strong is it and what's interesting about this as you can see we have some functions if the liquid contains the mover then the liquid to dry that mover so we've taken that formula we learned and we put it into a function essentially inside the liquid class this is a function which says let me receive a mover let me calculate that drag force through all the methodology we just did and then return it back so this is actually quite a useful thing when you want objects to exert forces on each other you need one object to receive as an argument another object and then compute that force and then apply it or return it or whatever the sort of structure you're doing is so the perhaps sometime this merits kind of its own video or discussion about how objects might talk to each other in a way and that's really what we're doing here I don't know maybe I'll hear from some people to hear whether this is unclear and we need some to sort of elaborate on this but that's what I wanted to point out about this particular video so one thing you might do now is take a look at this and see could you create a more elaborate scenario could you create a larger sort of space on the screen with all sorts of different pockets of resistance some weak some strong and what if you made something that actually sort of weirdly caused the object to speed up as it goes through it this sort of like inverse drag force I mean that may not really exist in the world but you could sort of think of some type of interactive system that you could make where you're trying to avoid the parts that slow you down and get into the parts that speed you up so these are some ideas for some things you might want to play around with in looking through and these formulas these examples or something okay uh thank you for listening I very grateful I really but noise brought it you know it's Riya at this point anymore so no one just heard me say that but that's fine you don't need to hear any of this okay goodbye I'll see you again in momentarily perhaps in the next video or Never I don't know if I'm really seeing I'm gonna press the button now
