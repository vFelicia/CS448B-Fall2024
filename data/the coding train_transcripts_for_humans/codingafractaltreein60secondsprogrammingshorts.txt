00:05 - easy on myself and start with the
00:07 - recursive tree which was only about a 15
00:09 - minute video in the first place step
00:11 - number one start with a blank canvas set
00:13 - a line color and a stroke weight
00:14 - translate to the bottom middle of the
00:16 - canvas which is where the tree will grow
00:18 - from then write a function draw a branch
00:20 - which is just a single vertical line
00:21 - with the magic of recursion the branch
00:24 - function can call itself shrinking the
00:26 - length of the next time but this would
00:28 - end up in an infinite Loop so we better
00:29 - have an exit condition to stop drawing
00:32 - when the branch gets too short then we
00:33 - can add an angle translate to the end of
00:36 - the branch to draw the next one then we
00:38 - can rotate off to the right by some
00:39 - angle we can also recursively rotate off
00:41 - to the left throw a little push and pop
00:43 - in there so that each time we draw a
00:45 - branch we're starting from the right
00:46 - position there we go a fractal Tree in
