00:01 - now here do you see me here do you see
00:04 - me here I'm live in two places at once
00:07 - on YouTube or this is not
00:09 - working I have no idea what's GNA happen
00:12 - is it the same URL or is this one just
00:14 - going to take
00:15 - over um someone please let me know
00:18 - what's going
00:20 - on
00:21 - uh it's working fine on both fantastic
00:25 - okay so um we'll just keep so people are
00:27 - asking what is this other live stream I
00:29 - don't know which one you are that's the
00:31 - thing man whoa um I don't know there's
00:35 - two live streams going on one is the
00:37 - camera that I'm talking to you directly
00:39 - right here this is my usual live stream
00:40 - that's going out through a computer down
00:42 - there through wirecast onto YouTube over
00:45 - here I'm talking to you right now you
00:46 - are my phone hi phone you are
00:48 - broadcasting through the YouTube mobile
00:50 - app what before I started you this
00:52 - camera over here I did this camera over
00:55 - here and I walked it around to show a
00:56 - walkthrough of my studio this eventually
00:58 - will end and they'll both be
01:00 - archived um so do you see the phone you
01:03 - see the phone I don't know what's going
01:05 - on okay um so I don't know I'm I'm like
01:09 - surrounded by computer screens and
01:10 - cameras I'm going a little bit crazy uh
01:13 - yeah the phone live stream does not seem
01:15 - to have a delay on it which is kind of
01:17 - amazing and this one uh really does seem
01:19 - to have a quite a big delay as it always
01:21 - has had okay um where will you hear the
01:26 - train whistle where will the train
01:28 - whistle go
01:32 - okay first thing first which is not the
01:34 - first thing but the last thing or the
01:35 - the not last thing I need to uh quit
01:39 - this silly thing I need to go onto up
01:42 - I'm there I need to uh get my
01:47 - soundboard uh for those of you who are
01:50 - on the uh this is a very ancient old
01:54 - iPad that I dug out of the closet at
01:58 - home uh and and if I turn it on and go
02:03 - to airplay this is me continuing now my
02:06 - walkthrough of the studio last step ah
02:09 - how come that's not oh it must be logged
02:11 - onto the wrong Wi-Fi network hold on
02:14 - everyone I'm going to go to settings oh
02:17 - this is terrible what time is it by the
02:18 - way 609 okay oh no I'm on the right
02:21 - Wi-Fi I'm not going to worry about this
02:22 - too much
02:24 - because uh I don't want to waste your
02:26 - time while I try to hook this
02:27 - up what if I go here and say this is on
02:30 - the right Wi-Fi and what if I go to here
02:33 - and say uh rebroadcast
02:36 - Services um okay let's see if that
02:41 - works huh weird all right whatever no
02:44 - soundboard right
02:47 - now uh what is my best dad joke
02:53 - um thank you Josh gorin on Twitter this
02:56 - is not my best one she the only one I
02:57 - can think of right now you know I've
02:59 - been thinking a lot about the creators
03:01 - of Mad Libs and they must be laughing
03:04 - all the way to the
03:07 - shoe oh if only had my soundboard I
03:09 - could play my butum chunk or something
03:10 - let me I don't understand why is this
03:12 - not airplane I'm GNA just T power it
03:17 - off and I'm I'm going to power it back
03:20 - on I'm going to quit this this is really
03:22 - this is a totally unnecessary uh
03:26 - thing uh and I'm on this particular WiFi
03:29 - Network yes um that's not even a joke
03:34 - yeah uh what did the um why why did the
03:39 - um you know one of my my kids used to
03:42 - love to um tell the interrupting cow
03:45 - knock knock joke knock knock who's there
03:48 - the interrupting cow the interrupting
03:49 - cow moo but he would always just say the
03:51 - moo after you said the whole thing the
03:53 - interrupting cow moo thought that was so
03:56 - funny okay um okay um so what am I here
04:00 - so I did a live stream earlier this
04:03 - morning uh where I did a bunch of
04:05 - tutorials about a physics Library called
04:07 - matter.js
04:09 - and I am back I am back and I'm here to
04:14 - continue and I would like to
04:17 - do uh oh there's some good jokes in the
04:19 - chat why did the shy Pebble want to be
04:21 - when she grew up I'm a little bit afraid
04:22 - maybe am I am I am I starting a joke
04:24 - that's going to be inappropriate I hope
04:26 - not
04:27 - um uh so I but here's my okay here's my
04:31 - dad joke except I have nobody to do this
04:33 - with I have to do it with myself knock
04:36 - knock who's
04:38 - there the interrupting coefficient of
04:41 - friction the interrupting coefficient of
04:43 - friction
04:44 - Mew there you go okay um let's see if
04:49 - this works I'm going to try to airplay
04:53 - this wow it's
04:56 - completely this this is the I need a new
04:59 - I just definitely need a new way of
05:00 - doing these sound effects this way is
05:02 - the worst this ancient iPad doesn't even
05:06 - have the airplay option is like totally
05:08 - gone now I don't know what happened to
05:11 - it this is
05:13 - here I really should just give up on
05:16 - this instead what I'll do is give up on
05:20 - this okay I'll come back to it later
05:21 - okay um now I think some people really
05:25 - enjoyed that actually strangely enough
05:29 - uh okay
05:31 - okay yeah I I I I just this uh okay so I
05:36 - still oh so okay somebody tell me how
05:39 - many people are in the actual YouTube
05:41 - chat which is this camera right here
05:42 - because right now I see that there are
05:44 - 540 in my green wall
05:46 - chat
05:48 - um okay uh come on come on soundboard I
05:52 - just feel oh
05:53 - airplan ah there it is
06:00 - mirroring turn on
06:05 - mirroring
06:07 - appear this is the worst this is the
06:09 - worst this is like debugging a totally
06:12 - unnecessary
06:13 - thing it just it appeared so I thought
06:16 - okay this will work now and now I've
06:18 - made it even worse because it doesn't
06:20 - work uh oh so sad so sad so sad because
06:27 - now at least when it's Friday evening
06:28 - there's nobody on this floor and I don't
06:29 - worry too much about making a lot of
06:31 - noise and I can uh play music and be a
06:34 - little bit more loud and ridiculous so I
06:37 - feel like you know hey
06:40 - music um okay so I'm gonna give up on
06:42 - this uh and I'm going to get with you
06:46 - know you know what the thing
06:48 - is I can play my music
06:52 - anyway it just uh won't go through
06:56 - wirecast let's see what happens
07:00 - I always
07:11 - [Music]
07:16 - forg kind of works I don't know if you
07:18 - can hear that through the mic um okay
07:22 - wow I'm looking at everybody's awesome
07:24 - screenshots of me streaming in multiple
07:26 - directions okay let's see what's going
07:29 - on here
07:30 - I'm going to open up
07:32 - atom I am going to open up
07:35 - terminal I am going to run a server I'm
07:38 - going to minimize
07:39 - terminal I am going to open up a
07:42 - browser which apparently is already open
07:44 - I'm going to go to Local Host and I'm
07:46 - going to check out the last example I
07:48 - made which was this one there it is The
07:50 - Swinging
07:52 - circles um and what I would like to do
07:54 - first is do a coding Challenge and that
07:57 - coding challenge is I'm sure
08:00 - yeah I'm going to do the coding
08:04 - Challenge and
08:06 - I um I'm going to do a coding Challenge
08:09 - and the coding challenge I'm going to do
08:10 - is to make Plinko Plinko with matter.js
08:14 - um how's that going to go what do you
08:17 - guys think about
08:18 - that this is 100% something I have never
08:22 - done before sometimes a coding challenge
08:24 - is like I did it like a couple years ago
08:26 - or like this is an example that I
08:28 - already have that I know I looked at
08:30 - this other person's thing I have no no
08:32 - plan whatsoever other than the words
08:34 - Plinko p5js and matter.js
08:40 - are you with
08:42 - me
08:43 - okay
08:45 - affirmative I take that as an
08:47 - affirmative okay
08:50 - so uh what do I first need to do I would
08:53 - like to uh grab something that I can use
08:56 - like this folder and I'm going to call
08:58 - this uh
09:02 - Plinko and now I'm going to go to Adam
09:05 - and I'm going to go to Plinko and I
09:07 - think I'm going to delete
09:10 - that and I'm going to go to
09:13 - sketch I'm going to delete everything
09:15 - but
09:16 - setup and
09:18 - draw and ah goodbye camera
09:24 - okay
09:26 - um okay
09:29 - that mug from the phone oh did I put the
09:31 - I put the mug
09:36 - in got to stay
09:40 - hydrated okay um this is by the way uh
09:44 - okay oh my slack disconnected oh try now
09:46 - try now come on come back okay um sorry
09:50 - about that
09:52 - everybody okay now ah you over there you
09:55 - over there you over there that's me okay
10:00 - create
10:01 - canvas
10:04 - 400400 background 51 this is what I'll
10:08 - do
10:09 - beforehand and whoops let's go to
10:12 - Plinko and let's think about this now I
10:17 - um that's really what it is let's give
10:20 - myself a bit more space
10:23 - 600400 make it a little bigger and then
10:26 - let's go to index.html
10:29 - and get rid of box.
10:32 - JS um I might want to use the Dom
10:35 - library at some point I might want to
10:37 - use the Sound
10:39 - Library
10:41 - interesting okay so I think we're ready
10:44 - for Plinko ready for party parrot Plinko
10:48 - time okay uh all
10:53 - right how long till the my phone battery
10:55 - dies that's a real question I do have a
10:56 - charger plug and I could try to plug in
10:58 - in or something ah why isn't this I kind
11:00 - of like I want to restart my computer
11:02 - let me I let me just do just give me one
11:05 - little bear with me for one second I'm
11:07 - GNA turn my Wi-Fi off
11:09 - here I'm gonna
11:12 - um I'm going to go to settings here and
11:16 - I'm going to go turn my Wi-Fi off here
11:19 - then I'm going to turn I'm going to
11:22 - unplug and plug back in this
11:25 - router just give it another chance
11:29 - one last
11:30 - chance and it is booting up
11:35 - router is starting
11:38 - up so now I should be able to let me
11:41 - quit this air server thing let me turn
11:44 - this back on last chance I swear this is
11:46 - the last time I'm going to try this then
11:48 - I'm moving
11:49 - on uh then I'm going to try to log into
11:52 - this oops no no
11:54 - no there we go I'm going to go there
11:57 - wi-fi back on
12:00 - let's
12:01 - connect uh then I'm going to turn back
12:04 - on air
12:08 - server and I am going
12:11 - to go to airplay Mac
12:19 - Pro ah there we go air server there we
12:21 - go it
12:22 - worked all right so now we're live with
12:25 - the soundboard we're going to go to the
12:27 - soundboard open that
12:31 - [Music]
12:38 - up good evening welcome to the coding
12:42 - rainbow ah I mean
12:44 - shoot good
12:47 - evening welcome to the coding
12:52 - train as we pull into the
12:55 - station getting ready to play a nice
12:57 - game of Plinko let let's continue
12:59 - reading from the coding train story book
13:03 - a million random digits with 100,000
13:05 - normal
13:11 - deviates uh when we last left
13:14 - [Music]
13:15 - off
13:18 - 9888 and now
13:22 - 66,9
13:24 - [Music]
13:25 - 6,830 53,6 56
13:29 - [Music]
13:33 - 14663 tune in next time on the coding
13:36 - train and we'll continue our story
13:40 - book I'm going to put this down over
13:42 - here
13:43 - now I need some new stick come on people
13:46 - help me out here I I got a I got I got
13:48 - some time so little time in the week to
13:50 - even prepare so I can't even come up
13:52 - with new material okay uh
13:55 - now uh here we go
14:02 - let's get ready for this coating
14:10 - challenge I really want it to have like
14:12 - a sound of Dan first of all it's an
14:14 - incredibly long snare drum and then at
14:16 - the end it doesn't do
14:18 - anything okay let me just kind of Google
14:22 - image search Plinko for a second I'm not
14:25 - sure I know exactly what Plinko
14:27 - is ah yes this is Plinko I do know what
14:30 - Plinko is uh but do I have to be kind of
14:33 - exact about this uh we're going to be
14:36 - let's see what's a nice Plinko look at
14:38 - this I can get Plinko all these Plinko
14:40 - things I can buy this looks like a good
14:43 - image uh okay I'm not going to worry
14:45 - about this I'm going to make my own
14:46 - Plinko ready here we
14:53 - go um yeah itd be interesting for
14:55 - somebody to edit together some sort of
14:57 - version of the uh or split screen the
15:00 - two camera views I'm happy for you know
15:02 - anybody who wants to mess around with
15:03 - that after these get archived I'm happy
15:05 - for that to happen
15:15 - Okay All
15:19 - Aboard it's Friday evening here on the
15:21 - coding train and I am here ready to
15:25 - create a coding Challenge and today's
15:27 - coding challenge is going to be
15:32 - ah never mind never mind all this
15:33 - nonsense Plinko so I'm going to attempt
15:35 - to make Plinko um using a physics engine
15:38 - known as matter.js what is Plinko you
15:40 - may ask good question I don't really I'm
15:43 - not entirely sure but I think Plinko is
15:45 - a thing where you have a bunch of balls
15:47 - that uh that fall from the top of a a
15:51 - two-dimensional it's a physical thing
15:53 - you drop the balls at the top there's
15:55 - all these little things that they bounce
15:56 - into and they end up somewhere on the
15:58 - bottom that was a terrible
16:00 - explanation I should redo this whole
16:02 - video I'm going to make it and then you
16:04 - guys can if you don't know what Plinko
16:05 - is pause and go try to look it up and
16:07 - then come back okay I have a sort of
16:09 - vague idea in my head okay so uh yes and
16:11 - I'm being reminded by Ala in the chat to
16:13 - stay
16:15 - hydrated now that I've lost half of the
16:18 - people who maybe were going to watch
16:19 - this video the rest of you let's go okay
16:22 - so the first thing that I want to do
16:24 - here is
16:25 - um boy let's h I'm trying to think about
16:30 - this here there's a lot of pieces to
16:31 - this boy this is going to be this is
16:32 - going to be hard um let's think about
16:34 - this over on the Whiteboard for a
16:37 - second and apologies to Mata who will
16:40 - now have to edit this
16:42 - part and I might as well come over here
16:46 - and just erase this for a
16:50 - second
16:53 - uh so now I'm going to artificially
16:55 - pretend that I'm doing this again
16:59 - okay so how does Plinko work I can use
17:01 - the Whiteboard to explain it Plinko is a
17:04 - thing where there is a grid of
17:08 - stationary I would call them like knobs
17:10 - in a way and I think each
17:11 - row would be offset from whoops offset
17:14 - from the one below it so it would be
17:16 - something like this um all the way to
17:19 - the bottom and then the idea is that you
17:20 - would drop things from the top and it
17:22 - would fall right down and bounce here
17:24 - and you know ideally the ideas would be
17:26 - a 50% chance of it going this way and a
17:28 - 50% chance of going that way then it
17:31 - would hit here and there would be a 50%
17:33 - chance of going this way versus a 50%
17:34 - going and interestingly enough if we do
17:36 - this correctly which I'm sure we won't
17:38 - there's no CH we it's me there no chance
17:40 - I'm going to do it correctly we would
17:41 - see a nice normal Gan distribution of
17:44 - where they land like they would mostly
17:45 - land in the center with a few outliers
17:47 - boy isn't there some like TV show now
17:49 - called the wall I should just put like I
17:52 - could probably could create some sort of
17:53 - like clickbait title for this video but
17:55 - I'm not going to do that so then the
17:57 - idea so then they'll they'll fill up in
17:58 - the we could use this to like you know
18:00 - you win certain amount of money or
18:01 - whatever so this is the simulation so
18:02 - what I need is I need some mechanism for
18:05 - catching everything in different slots
18:08 - so these would be kind of stationary in
18:09 - the physics engine I could probably make
18:11 - these stationary
18:12 - rectangles if that's a thing then these
18:15 - would be and static is the word I'm
18:16 - looking for static uh Circle objects
18:19 - that are around and then I'm going to
18:20 - have Dynamic Circle objects falling from
18:22 - the top so I need really three kinds of
18:25 - things I'm going to call these particles
18:28 - because uh that's a good name for them
18:30 - I'm going to call these um
18:33 - pinkos because we're making Plinko and
18:36 - then this is going to be a bucket we'll
18:39 - call these buckets to catch the thing so
18:40 - I need to make three kinds of objects
18:43 - and so I'm kind of planning this out I
18:45 - guess I know I'm going to need arrays
18:46 - for all these things um so let's sort of
18:50 - see how this goes let's try making just
18:52 - the particles
18:53 - first okay so um what I'm going to do is
18:58 - oh cup is in front again sorry everybody
19:00 - I have a you don't want to know what's
19:02 - going on here with my multiple camera
19:04 - system
19:05 - craziness um okay um so what I'm going
19:08 - to do is I'm going to add a Javascript
19:10 - file and I'm going to call it particle.
19:12 - JS and I'm going to say function
19:16 - particle uh and I'm going to when I
19:19 - create a particle the thing falling from
19:20 - the top I want to create it at an XY
19:22 - location now here's the thing I'm using
19:25 - a physics engine called matter.js and I
19:27 - already have an index .html a reference
19:30 - to the matter.js library now I also have
19:33 - a reference to the p5js library that's
19:35 - the library I'm using for drawing and
19:36 - that's the library that I use in just
19:37 - about in many of my videos almost all of
19:39 - them but matter.js is new and if you
19:42 - want to learn more about matter.js I
19:43 - will link to a set of tutorial videos
19:45 - about matter separately I'm just going
19:47 - to kind of rapidly go through adding
19:49 - stuff for matter without maybe
19:50 - explaining everything but I do have
19:51 - separate tutorial videos okay now I do
19:54 - need to go to the matter.js website and
19:57 - I want to Google matter get
19:59 - started maybe Wiki um because I know
20:03 - that this is going to have some of the
20:04 - code that I want on it like this for
20:06 - example so one thing is uh matter is a
20:09 - library where all of the objects and
20:11 - functions that you might call of call
20:13 - from are
20:14 - namespaced uh they all start with matter
20:16 - do something and I'm going to definitely
20:17 - need an engine and a ren I don't need a
20:19 - render actually because I'm using P5 an
20:21 - engine a world bodies so this is a way
20:23 - of just sort of aliasing them so I don't
20:24 - have to say matter dot all the
20:27 - time and and so what I need is uh I want
20:32 - to have an
20:35 - engine I want to have a world I want to
20:38 - have a bunch of particles that's what
20:40 - I'm starting with engine world and a
20:41 - bunch of particles okay so uh engine
20:45 - equals matter dot no no engine. create I
20:51 - don't know World equals engine. world
20:55 - what's the chance that that's right so I
20:56 - need to create an engine and then I want
20:58 - to refence refence to the world that
20:59 - that engine creates sort of seems
21:01 - unlikely that that's correct oh it is
21:02 - correct engine equals engine. create and
21:05 - the world is you can see later engine.
21:07 - World okay great now what I want to do
21:09 - is I want to start creating um some
21:12 - bodies so the way I'm going to do that
21:13 - is I'm going to say VAR P equals a new
21:16 - particle and I just want to put it uh at
21:19 - at the top in the middle 300 comma uh 50
21:22 - so I want to make a single new particle
21:25 - now I'm calling the new particle
21:27 - Constructor function so over here now
21:29 - what I need to do is I actually need to
21:31 - make a something called a body and body
21:35 - comes from B do so bodies is a thing
21:38 - that matter dos will make matter is the
21:39 - physics engine it's going to handle
21:41 - moving everything and doing all that so
21:43 - my particle object is just a wrapper for
21:45 - a matter.js circle thing so I want to
21:49 - make a matter.js circle thing at X and Y
21:52 - and it needs to have a
21:54 - radius uh uh this do r so oh but not
21:59 - this.r all right so I think I think
22:02 - that's right so I should look in the
22:04 - documentation I don't have matter.js uh
22:06 - memorized so I'm going to have to pull
22:08 - up the documentation here go under
22:12 - documentation uh go under bodies and now
22:14 - I'm looking for Circle XY radius now
22:16 - there's options and all sorts of other
22:18 - things which I might get into but this
22:19 - looks like I'm doing well so far here x
22:22 - y r okay now the other thing I need to
22:25 - do is I need to say world. add world
22:29 - um this. body what's this doing I have
22:33 - to not only do I have to make a body
22:35 - that's a matter body that can exist and
22:37 - have physics I need to tell the world
22:38 - that I actually want that body to be in
22:40 - the world it seems a little bit
22:41 - redundant but you know you might want to
22:43 - make objects that you don't actually
22:44 - they don't participate in the physics
22:45 - yet so those two things are separated
22:48 - and then I want to write a
22:50 - function where I can display it um and I
22:53 - should I should use H let's use the
22:54 - Prototype thing I have some videos that
22:55 - explain prototypes so let's throw
22:57 - caution to the wind prototype. show
23:00 - equals function so if you're wondering
23:01 - about this prototype P way of attaching
23:04 - methods to objects um I'll link to a
23:06 - video about prototype but this is a way
23:08 - of saying particles all particles are
23:10 - going to have a show function and in the
23:12 - show function I'm going to say what am I
23:14 - going to say I'm going to say Phil uh
23:18 - 255 uh stroke 255 ellipse and where is
23:23 - the body now here's the thing normally
23:24 - when I make an object I give it an X and
23:26 - a y or a position Vector but not here
23:30 - right now I am relying on matter.js to
23:33 - do all the physics for me so it's up to
23:35 - me to say
23:36 - Hey you know that body that's a
23:39 - matter.js body could you please tell me
23:42 - what its position is currently and then
23:44 - I can say and you know what I'm going to
23:46 - do I know that eventually I'm going to
23:48 - want rotation so I'm going to say
23:50 - translate this uh pause.
23:54 - X pause. Y instead of setting the
23:57 - ellipse to that location and then I'm
23:59 - going to draw the ellipse at 0 and I
24:01 - want to give it a a diameter which is
24:05 - its own radius time 2 now this do R
24:06 - doesn't actually exist so I don't think
24:09 - that the um oops and I have got an error
24:12 - there um uh I my I seem to remember
24:15 - looking at the matter.js documentation
24:16 - the circle body doesn't actually keep
24:18 - track of its radius in a property so I'm
24:20 - just going to make an extra property
24:22 - myself to keep track of it and that way
24:24 - I can draw it that way so now I've made
24:26 - a body I've added it to the world and I
24:28 - showed it I have a my own particle
24:30 - object that is a wrapper for a matter.js
24:33 - body essentially um so now whoops if I
24:37 - go to sketch. JS and I just say uh
24:43 - particles. push p and then I say p.show
24:47 - let's see if it shows up I hope so I
24:50 - hope so I hope so I hope so I would do
24:53 - my drum roll thing now but that doesn't
24:54 - never seem to work ah okay particle is
24:57 - not defined uh of course I always forget
24:59 - this this is almost as much as I forget
25:03 - the fail fail static oh it's super loud
25:07 - oh my God okay hold on hold
25:09 - on sorry you know what I'm sorry for
25:11 - everybody's
25:13 - ears uh Mato let me do that again and
25:16 - let's not have the music cue when we
25:17 - edit this
25:21 - together I always forget uh to add um
25:25 - the reference to uh the new JavaScript
25:28 - file yeah and the sound was laggy the
25:30 - new JavaScript file um to uh the index
25:35 - HTML so uh I need to add that here what
25:37 - did I call it particle. JS so I'm G to
25:39 - add that here uh okay now I'm going hit
25:41 - refresh okay what did I miss cannot read
25:44 - property body of undefined at
25:47 - object I must have done something wrong
25:49 - okay object.create bodies. Circle so
25:52 - where did I miss miss mess this up so
25:55 - let's comment out oh look at this this
25:57 - is for first of all nonsense that should
26:00 - be particles index zero. show because
26:02 - that's a local variable that I use just
26:03 - to add to the
26:04 - array and uh and you know what this is
26:07 - going to be I have a feeling this is
26:08 - going to be a
26:09 - two-part uh a multi-part coding
26:12 - challenge I'm just saying that right now
26:13 - so I'll think about that as I go um
26:16 - because I can see that this is getting
26:17 - more complicated uh what am I missing
26:20 - cannot read property
26:22 - undefined uh and it create it must be oh
26:26 - bodies no this body equal bodies. Circle
26:30 - wait wait wait I'm still getting the
26:32 - error message even with oh no I haven't
26:33 - commented out let me comment this out to
26:35 - make sure that it's happening when I
26:36 - create the
26:37 - particle ah okay well okay that's fine
26:40 - we comment this out okay no error this
26:42 - is a good way of debugging comments
26:44 - everything out no errors let me just try
26:46 - to make the
26:49 - object oh I forgot to add the
26:53 - R I added an r and so it needs to have a
26:56 - radius otherwise what's it going to do
26:58 - well let's see if that fixes it I I'm
27:00 - guessing that fixed
27:02 - it and now we're going to see the
27:04 - particle there we go so there's the
27:06 - particle that single particle now it has
27:08 - no physics why does it have no physics
27:10 - well here's the thing a physics engine
27:12 - requires me to say hey go to the next
27:15 - Moment In Time move ahead in time and
27:18 - time can mean a lot of different things
27:20 - but it can mean real world time it can
27:21 - mean frame of animation and in this case
27:24 - I want to tie each frame each time
27:27 - through the draw Loop to a new moment in
27:29 - time and the easiest way to do that
27:30 - there's there's a lot of options that
27:32 - way that you can configure this is I'm
27:33 - just going to say engine. update I think
27:36 - that's all I say engine. update or maybe
27:39 - I have to say engine.
27:43 - update well let's try engine. update
27:45 - does that do it no engine. update is not
27:48 - a function engine. update engine it
27:52 - might be that the function update is
27:53 - namespaced in engine and then you pass
27:56 - in the thing you want to update that's
27:58 - it okay so you can see there's my Plinko
28:01 - particle falling down so we're in good
28:03 - shape we've got the Plinko particle now
28:06 - maybe what I want to do also is just to
28:09 - kind of
28:10 - um is to do something like let's
28:14 - have uh if frame count modulus 60 equals
28:19 - z so modulus is the remainder of
28:22 - division so this will equal zero when
28:24 - frame count is zero 60 120 180 240 300
28:28 - Etc so I'm going to say uh add a new
28:32 - particle every 60 frames which is
28:35 - approximately two seconds let's do this
28:38 - uh show of undefined oh right and then
28:41 - silly
28:42 - me I should someday use a for each
28:47 - Loop but right now I'm just going to
28:49 - Loop through all the particles and show
28:52 - them and here we go so now we should see
28:54 - two seconds and about two seconds later
29:02 - oh boy something must be wrong here I'm
29:03 - not seeing any new where are those where
29:05 - are those blinko particles uh if frame
29:08 - count modulus 60 equals zero add a new
29:10 - one that looks good to me what have I
29:12 - done wrong uh let's console log frame
29:15 - count just to make sure that's a thing
29:19 - yeah looks like it's it started with one
29:20 - by the way so I'm not sure why uh what
29:23 - did I miss um okay the oh no this seem
29:28 - right put a new one I'm looking through
29:30 - all of them okay why okay hold
29:33 - on every let's console log every
29:39 - 60 every
29:42 - 60 ah so that's happening why do I not
29:45 - see a second
29:48 - one uh H that's strange let's look at
29:51 - first of all let's make this a little
29:52 - more often just so we don't have to
29:54 - wasit so much
29:56 - time and let me
30:03 - uh let me let me just see if that array
30:06 - is
30:07 - growing yeah the array is growing did I
30:10 - mess up in the particle object world.
30:13 - add this. body it's getting a new body
30:15 - each
30:17 - time what have I
30:19 - missed P
30:22 - Global uh should be New bodies. Circle
30:25 - did I do that wrong oh
30:28 - yes look at this thank you to somebody
30:31 - in the chat whose name scrolled
30:34 - by I think I called this incorrectly
30:37 - let's look at the
30:39 - documentation uh this is hopefully I
30:42 - would have um let's look at H I don't
30:46 - know if that's actually the case no look
30:48 - at this when I make a rectangular
30:50 - documentation I don't have to say new
30:52 - the function is designed to so what am I
30:55 - missing here H H oh oh I know what the
30:58 - problem
30:59 - [Music]
31:00 - is you guys see it now look it's right
31:03 - here it's right here right there
31:06 - translate pause. X pause.
31:09 - Y so I I knew I was going to I meant to
31:11 - add this earlier when I was doing it I
31:13 - thought whatever so translations are
31:16 - cumulative so when I translate to the
31:18 - position of one particle the next
31:20 - particle I draw will be relative to that
31:21 - one and so these are all getting
31:23 - translated way off the screen I need to
31:25 - not have them be relative to each other
31:27 - rather I need to say
31:29 - push and I need to say pop and now uh so
31:33 - what push and pop does is it's like save
31:36 - translate restore so it undoes the
31:38 - translation and now if I go back to my
31:41 - code there we go look at all my Plinko
31:44 - things every 10 frames my little Plinko
31:47 - particles falling down so we can go back
31:49 - to sketch and I can take out this
31:53 - console log nonsense and I can put it
31:56 - back to 60 and we can kind of oh and
31:59 - there's still another console log
32:00 - happening where's that other console log
32:01 - oh particles. length uh and so we can
32:03 - see here and you know what I'm It's
32:05 - upsetting me that there's not one at the
32:07 - beginning so I'm also going to what I'm
32:10 - going to do is I'm going to write a
32:11 - function new particle that just
32:16 - does that those two lines of code and
32:19 - oops and I'm going to say new particle
32:21 - here and I'm also going to have a new
32:23 - particle instantaneously in setup at the
32:25 - very beginning so now we get a particle
32:27 - and 2 seconds later we get particle and
32:29 - 2 seconds later we get particle I'm a
32:31 - little bit behind Okay um now the nice
32:34 - thing is it's the physics is already
32:37 - working as you might have noticed when I
32:38 - made this like if I make this every five
32:40 - frames you can see they're kind of like
32:42 - hitting each other it's a little bit
32:43 - funny that's a little bit like of a
32:44 - weird but but let's we're going to get
32:45 - to more physics later okay
32:48 - now I'm going to do I think I'm going to
32:50 - do this as a two-part challenge so um so
32:53 - let me go a little bit further let me at
32:55 - least add the stationary Plinko
32:58 - so I want to now try to add these
33:00 - stationary plos and the truth of the
33:01 - matter is I could probably reuse this
33:03 - particle object and just make particle
33:06 - objects here and give them like an
33:08 - argument that setss them to static but
33:10 - I'm going to make some a seriously
33:12 - redundant code just for like sort of
33:14 - ease right now and I could think I could
33:15 - use inheritance in a nice way to have
33:17 - them relate but I just want to make a
33:18 - separate object that just keeps track of
33:20 - these stationary Plinko because I I just
33:22 - want to treat them differently so um
33:24 - that's how I feel today okay you you can
33:26 - you can you can uh refactor my code
33:28 - later to make it uh better okay so let's
33:30 - come back here and let's go to particle
33:32 - DS and I'm going to do save as this is
33:34 - really I'm I'm a little bit
33:35 - uncomfortable with what I'm doing here
33:37 - I'm going to say Plinko JS and I'm going
33:40 - to say function
33:41 - Plinko and uh Plinko I really should use
33:45 - inheritance here come back and use
33:47 - inheritance another time Plinko
33:48 - prototype. show and something I'm going
33:50 - to do here is I'm going to add uh
33:53 - another variable called options so when
33:55 - you create a physics object in matter.js
33:58 - in addition to giving it that Circle
34:01 - body in x a y and a radius I can give it
34:03 - some options and the option I want right
34:04 - now is is static oh and I'm editing no
34:07 - I'm editing the right file is static
34:09 - true so and then I want to pass this
34:11 - fourth argument as options there might
34:14 - be a way that I could just make all
34:15 - these options actually could I make the
34:16 - X Y I don't know if that's true but
34:17 - anyway that fourth argument is options
34:19 - and there's other options I'm going to
34:20 - be I'll add later like friction and
34:22 - other physics settings but let's leave
34:23 - that out for now is static makes it
34:26 - something that doesn't move and doesn't
34:27 - doesn't experience uh doesn't experience
34:30 - um geometry okay um now that's right I
34:34 - forgot that the phone is still going I
34:36 - should I turn that off okay but okay so
34:40 - um uh that's not relevant to this
34:43 - particular video maybe we can edit that
34:44 - little thing
34:46 - out okay so
34:48 - now in and here's the thing I could Pro
34:51 - um matter.js also has uh these concept
34:54 - as a composite so I could tell it to
34:56 - make a stack of things with rows and
34:58 - columns so I could probably use that
35:00 - let's look at that for a
35:01 - second no I just not the kind of I I
35:04 - think that's great but I I feel like I
35:06 - just need to like set them in my own
35:08 - location right now without using the
35:10 - composite thing so I'm going to say VAR
35:14 - Plinko and what I'm going to do is I'm
35:16 - going to say for VAR x
35:19 - equals um let's use I andj actually I
35:22 - equals z i is less than let's make the
35:24 - Plinko thing 10 by 10 maybe or 10x 5 I I
35:27 - know 5 by I don't know what should be I
35:30 - I should have some variables for maybe
35:32 - columns let's do that and
35:35 - rows and uh so we're gonna have this
35:38 - many columns and then I need a
35:41 - spacing so I'm going to make a a sort of
35:43 - a double Loop here uh nested Loop to go
35:47 - through all the rows and probably rows
35:49 - should be on the outside actually well
35:52 - whatever I'm not so sure just yet um
35:55 - because I I is the X so actually I think
35:57 - think the way I'm going to think about
35:58 - this is to put I on the inner part of
36:00 - the loop so I'm doing a nested Loop
36:02 - right because I want to say set all of
36:05 - these then go down here and set all of
36:07 - these so for every row do all the
36:09 - columns next row do all the columns or
36:11 - for every y do all the X's okay so now
36:14 - what I want to do is I want to say VAR P
36:18 - equals new plink
36:20 - go at I * spacing comma J * spacing now
36:24 - I haven't figured out what spacing
36:26 - should be but I just want to know wants
36:27 - to be at every column and row location
36:29 - with however far apart they're supposed
36:31 - to be and let's just say right now
36:34 - spacing equals the width of the window
36:37 - divided by the number of columns so
36:40 - because I need five across and that's
36:41 - about the spacing I'm sure I'm going to
36:42 - have to massage this a little bit and
36:45 - then I'm going to say here
36:47 - Plinko pushp so now I'm adding the
36:50 - Plinko I like the I love the word Plinko
36:53 - it's such a great word Plinko Plinko
36:54 - Plinko let's make a song about Plinko uh
36:57 - um and now I want another loop
37:01 - here to go through all of the Plinko and
37:05 - show them and just to be 100% certain
37:08 - that they're different uh I would like
37:12 - to uh give them like a different color
37:15 - or something so let's make them uh like
37:18 - a green color color not being my
37:21 - strength here but let's just do that so
37:23 - what's going on now what's plink plink
37:25 - is not defined so a lot of things I
37:27 - probably first of all I don't know where
37:28 - that happened where did I say plink
37:30 - plink is not as good of a word as Plinko
37:32 - I much prefer the word Plinko oh plink
37:34 - Plinko and now I'm going to go to index.
37:37 - HTML and I now I need to remember this I
37:40 - remembered at this time I need to add a
37:42 - reference to
37:44 - Plinko and now I'm going to refresh it
37:47 - and what am I missing cannot read I've
37:49 - got some sort of like thing that I
37:51 - forgot already again I probably forgot
37:52 - the r again right I probably forgot to
37:54 - pass into
37:55 - radius um I certainly did so let's give
37:58 - each one of these things that's
37:59 - separated by spacing a radius of four
38:02 - pixels and now I don't see anything I
38:06 - see these things falling uh I wonder if
38:09 - I have an i and J issue I'm seeing
38:11 - they're called pegs I'm being told in
38:12 - the chat by C many that they're not
38:14 - called Plinko they're called pegs that
38:16 - would be a good name for them okay fine
38:17 - the whole thing is Plinko uh I times
38:20 - spacing J time spacing I put j i J's
38:24 - Less in rows columns rows this looks
38:26 - reasonable um let's just look here do I
38:29 - act let's look at the
38:31 - array let's make sure it's F full of
38:33 - stuff it only has one thing in it that's
38:36 - a little bit weird oh and look at it
38:37 - it's all the way up there which makes no
38:39 - sense whatsoever so plus equals spacing
38:43 - in the for
38:44 - Loop uh uh I oh columns no no no no no
38:49 - no yeah yeah this is wrong the whole
38:51 - point of doing this is I want to be able
38:53 - to think of the rows and columns as
38:55 - individual numbers I and j 0 1 two 3
38:58 - four and when I'm drawing to the screen
38:59 - I want to add the spacing aspect so now
39:03 - we can see there they are now it's not
39:05 - in any place that's logical so one thing
39:07 - that I need is for the center column
39:11 - right I need I need an odd number of
39:13 - columns well I don't need an odd number
39:15 - but I need a column to line up with
39:16 - where the thing is falling so first of
39:18 - all uh if the I want the let me I can
39:20 - get rid of this now I want the the
39:23 - particles to actually just stop start at
39:25 - the actual top
39:28 - camera
39:30 - moment this can get this is a little
39:32 - nice little edit moment
39:37 - here as I have a sip my half of my head
39:39 - got chopped off there um so um I forgot
39:44 - what I was
39:46 - doing um yeah I should definitely make
39:49 - the canvas longer okay I'm forgot what I
39:51 - was doing where was I where was I where
39:53 - was
39:54 - I
39:56 - uh um
39:58 - I'm thinking I'm
40:00 - thinking if I press the Bell it'll make
40:02 - my brain have light up and have the idea
40:05 - was the last thing I said spacing yeah
40:08 - you guys are G me good suggestions of
40:09 - what to do next what's spacing okay I
40:11 - don't know um I'll just go back to
40:14 - something okay so I need to have one of
40:16 - these columns in the center I need to
40:18 - have one of these columns in the center
40:20 - so let me think about how to do that and
40:22 - also I want the particles to start at
40:24 - the top yes so particles starting at the
40:27 - top top and I want that I need to make
40:29 - the whole thing much taller so let's go
40:31 - down to 800 pixels great so now we can
40:34 - see it's going down to 800 pixels I want
40:35 - to shift everything down right
40:37 - everything should start at um and I'm
40:41 - actually going to do this varx equal I +
40:43 - one times spacing
40:46 - because no no no no no X is fine at I *
40:51 - spacing and uh y should be spacing plus
40:56 - I * spacing just to kind of offset
40:59 - everything by and then I'm going to just
41:00 - put X and Y here this will make it a
41:01 - little easier to work out whoa what did
41:04 - I do wrong there uh spacing plus a j
41:07 - thank you very much okay so that's a
41:09 - little bit better but I I also want to
41:11 - shift everything over by half of spacing
41:15 - I think so I want to shift everything
41:17 - over by spacing divided by
41:19 - two there we go ah look at that so okay
41:23 - so first of all couple things it's
41:26 - pretty great actually look at it just
41:28 - like get stuck and kind of roll over so
41:30 - one thing
41:32 - is um I this this going to be this
41:35 - definitely going to be a puzzle here of
41:36 - having uh working out the spacing but
41:38 - one thing is let's give these things
41:39 - some bounce so the way that we think
41:41 - give things bounce in matter.js is by
41:45 - working with the friction and
41:46 - restitution so restitution is a term for
41:49 - elasticity a high restitution will make
41:51 - it very bouncy and so what I want to do
41:53 - and this is why I should be using is I
41:56 - want to add this options thing both to
41:58 - particle and Plinko which really should
42:01 - be a
42:01 - Peg and this these are not static I'm
42:04 - going to just work only in the particle
42:05 - for a second restitution and I want that
42:08 - to be one which is as bouncy as possible
42:11 - so let's just add that
42:15 - options that didn't really seem to
42:17 - change anything right so let's Also
42:20 - let's get rid of any
42:23 - friction um so now the particles should
42:25 - have a high restitution and no
42:29 - friction that's a little bit better
42:31 - right you can see it's kind of bouncing
42:32 - but I probably need to work on the pegs
42:34 - I really know the Plinko the pegs uh so
42:36 - let's actually take these same variables
42:39 - I'm not sure what it would do here to
42:41 - have sort of different amounts but let's
42:44 - um let's add a high restitution and a
42:46 - low friction also to the the pegs wow I
42:50 - really would expect this to be um more
42:53 - bouncy with those numbers but maybe it
42:54 - just hasn't gathered oh I spelled
42:56 - restitution
42:58 - wrong that's one of the things about
43:00 - JavaScript it's not going to tell you
43:02 - this is a really unfortunate thing if I
43:04 - was working in another environment it
43:05 - would be like I don't know what that is
43:08 - restitution restitution what's the
43:10 - chance I got that right
43:12 - now
43:15 - restitution boing there we go boing bo
43:19 - bo boing Bo well it's going to be fun to
43:21 - add sound effects to this so you know we
43:24 - can see now we've got something we've
43:26 - got these things kind of kind of
43:27 - bouncing along here now they're all
43:28 - taking exactly the same path how are we
43:31 - going to get it to have like a 50%
43:32 - chance of going why is it going to the
43:34 - left so interesting this is super okay
43:37 - well first of all what I want to do is I
43:39 - want to shift uh every other row and and
43:43 - um so let's let's uh let's maybe reduce
43:47 - the restitution a little bit yeah that's
43:49 - a little bit better um and then let me
43:51 - alternate where uh the rows are so what
43:54 - I want to do is uh
43:57 - in sketch.
43:59 - JS I want to say every other row right
44:04 - which
44:05 - is if J is the row right if J modulus 2
44:11 - equals z then uh
44:15 - so so then let's or equals one there got
44:21 - to be a nicer way to do this so I'm
44:23 - setting X then what I want to do is xus
44:27 - I'll just sort of like take that let's
44:28 - do it this way xal I plus spacing and
44:31 - then if it's an even row then I'm going
44:34 - to add in offset it by spacing divided
44:37 - by two let's see if that works there we
44:40 - go so this looks a bit more now here's
44:41 - the thing I probably need to really
44:44 - calibrate this in some way that they
44:46 - kind of you know bounce but let's just
44:50 - let's not worry about that too much and
44:51 - let's actually um just make this let's
44:54 - just give ourselves a lot more columns
44:56 - and rows
44:58 - and see what happens um and why is the
45:00 - top one now oh because it's not
45:03 - even uh I want to have uh 11 columns
45:07 - yeah there we go so
45:11 - um and I think I want so there's going
45:14 - to be some there's probably like a
45:15 - specific layout that I that's going to
45:17 - work pretty optimally well but this is a
45:19 - good start so um this completes part one
45:22 - of this coding Challenge and what I'm
45:24 - going to do in part two is I'm going to
45:27 - do a couple things I don't know what I
45:29 - what am I going to do in part two I'm
45:31 - going to add buckets to the bottom to
45:33 - catch them and maybe think about the
45:35 - layout and spacing a little bit more
45:37 - okay so that's what I'm going to do in
45:39 - part
45:40 - two does it really make sense how long
45:42 - have I been doing this for this live
45:43 - stream has been going on for 45
45:46 - minutes um yeah it should be way more
45:48 - bouncy right um I
45:51 - think
45:53 - uh one thing so I'm oops how's my how's
45:57 - my phone live stream going I'm at least
45:59 - taking a break I I don't know if MAA is
46:01 - watching I don't think MAA is watching
46:02 - this live chat I'm so it make the pegs
46:05 - bigger yeah that's probably a good thing
46:07 - they're all going initially to the left
46:08 - so that's one thing can you modify the
46:11 - parameters to look like a normal gravity
46:13 - one thing is the time step here so um
46:17 - I'm seeing a lot of great suggestions
46:18 - add Randomness they to drop in from
46:20 - random points oh yeah dropping in from
46:21 - random points would be good um so um
46:25 - there's lots of things I can add oh but
46:27 - mostly what I want to do stronger
46:29 - gravity so I'm taking a little break
46:31 - here to think about
46:33 - this um and then I'll put the stuff in
46:36 - the video
46:38 - tutorial how could what so I'm trying to
46:40 - think about the stronger gravity let's
46:42 - look on the matter.js I think the the
46:44 - matter.js website is there
46:50 - world I mean right now it's it's
46:52 - starting to get really really slow over
46:54 - time uh is there a way to set
46:57 - gravity oh M as Gravity the gravity the
47:01 - gravity scale gravity object so the
47:04 - world when I say world.
47:08 - create oh I can give boundaries for
47:11 - Collision that's kind of
47:12 - useful uh the world sorry where was that
47:16 - world.
47:18 - create
47:23 - um options and one of those options can
47:26 - be gravity
47:27 - I need to destroy the offscreen particle
47:29 - so I need to add that as well yeah yeah
47:31 - definitely going to do that so those are
47:33 - let me make a list of things I need to
47:34 - do in part
47:35 - two uh oops this camera's
47:43 - off uh increase or
47:49 - gravity
47:51 - delete
47:53 - particles add bounds
47:57 - and then um I'm standing for add
48:02 - bounds uh add
48:06 - buckets and I don't know maybe I could
48:09 - like count a listener I might be
48:10 - interesting to try like a listener to
48:13 - count uh to count which buckets the
48:15 - things land in although they're not the
48:16 - buckets are going to fill up so they're
48:17 - not going to hit the bottom I'm I'm not
48:19 - going to worry about that that'll be
48:21 - somebody else's problem as a followup uh
48:23 - reusing them instead of deleting them is
48:25 - a good suggestion from Big Apple in the
48:27 - chat I could definitely do that um
48:29 - engine. world.
48:31 - gravity. uh thank you okay um so let me
48:35 - uh let me see here how's my phone B
48:38 - there's still 148 people somehow
48:41 - watching and 75 minutes into this live
48:44 - stream on the phone I thing about this
48:47 - phone live stream is now nobody's going
48:48 - to want to watch my studio walk through
48:50 - when they see it's like a threeh hour
48:51 - video but whatever can edit I can edit
48:54 - something out maybe maybe something
48:55 - could get edited out of that
48:57 - that'll be more useful anyway okay
49:01 - um I know so C Manny is saying I can say
49:03 - engine. world. gravity doy even rows
49:07 - need another column oh yeah that's
49:10 - interesting let me let me look
49:12 - here yeah so they're missing it's
49:15 - missing like a last piece there so that
49:17 - I can add um and then also let's see
49:20 - what we can do about the gravity just um
49:24 - so what you're saying is I can say world
49:27 - old.
49:29 - gravity. y equals you know 100 or
49:33 - something okay that
49:36 - worked yeah that's good so that's
49:43 - good it's interesting how it's able to
49:46 - fit like all the way through um so
49:50 - that's what is it what is the default at
49:51 - one maybe yeah so maybe if I just double
49:54 - it
49:56 - um oh but Collision listening I can use
49:58 - for playing sound so um Collision
50:01 - listening so but what I wanted to do
50:03 - when I when I come back I think I would
50:05 - prefer
50:07 - to oh engine. create so I'll just do it
50:11 - I'll do it that way that's fine
50:14 - okay okay
50:17 - uh hello jello in the UK thanks for
50:20 - watching okay so what time is it 7
50:24 - o'clock yeah
50:29 - so I'm going
50:31 - to maybe make the pegs a bigger size
50:34 - that's a good suggestion as well okay so
50:36 - I'm going to now move into part two of
50:39 - this uh coding challenge okay so I made
50:41 - my list uh does and so
50:46 - um sound plus listening that might
50:50 - actually be a part
50:52 - three so I think I can do these things
50:55 - increase gravity delete part particles
50:57 - add boundaries and add the buckets I
50:59 - think I can do that in part two and then
51:01 - maybe part three we'll be adding sound
51:03 - so that's sort of like its own thing
51:07 - okay uh here I
51:12 - am okay welcome to part two of Plinko
51:15 - coding challenge I actually just during
51:17 - the little break I just took between
51:19 - part one and part two I made a quick
51:20 - list with help from the chat here's the
51:22 - things that I'm going to do I'm going to
51:23 - increase the gravity of the world so
51:24 - that things don't look so sluggish as
51:26 - they're falling I got to make sure I
51:28 - delete any particles that leave the
51:30 - window although at some point I'm going
51:31 - to put boundaries so actually I might
51:33 - hold off on that because I was going to
51:35 - add boundaries around the whole world so
51:36 - that they can't leave the window because
51:38 - the idea is to fill up the buckets at
51:39 - the bottom but uh um then I uh and then
51:43 - I want to add buckets at the bottom to
51:44 - fill those things up and then I actually
51:46 - might make this a part three let's see
51:47 - if we can add a little bit of sound with
51:49 - they as they hit the things as little
51:50 - like ding ding sounds or whatever maybe
51:52 - I can record the Bell really quickly and
51:54 - use that sound okay uh so um here we are
51:58 - so first thing I could do is so gravity
52:00 - is part of the world um and so if I look
52:03 - at if I just look in the console if I
52:06 - look at world we can see here that there
52:08 - are a lot of properties there's bounds
52:10 - which don't There's No Boundaries to the
52:12 - worlds right now that's something I'm
52:13 - going to set um there's no constraints
52:16 - but there's gravity here which is an
52:17 - object and you can see the scale is
52:20 - 0.001 X is zero Y is
52:23 - two why is Y 2 oh because I already
52:26 - changed it as I was
52:30 - practicing
52:32 - um why is one
52:35 - ah it's fine it's fine let me redo that
52:39 - part and I I I I'm using my one redo
52:42 - ticket even though I do that over and
52:43 - over again um okay so hold
52:49 - on where was I okay um
52:57 - so let me look over here and see what I
53:00 - can do so gravity is part of something
53:03 - so there conceptually there's a world
53:05 - and there's particles and there's Plinko
53:07 - gravity is not part of a Plinko or Peg
53:10 - or a particle it's part of the world so
53:12 - I can actually look here in the console
53:14 - and I can just type world to look and
53:15 - see what the properties of the world are
53:17 - there's bounds which is something I want
53:18 - to look at which has a maximum and a
53:20 - minimum X and Y whoops which is ah I
53:22 - clicked the wrong thing come on click
53:24 - again you can see those are Infinity
53:26 - because I haven't said any bounds and
53:27 - then there's gravity which has a scale I
53:29 - don't 100% know what that is I should
53:31 - look it up in the documentation but I
53:32 - have an X and A Y so one thing I
53:34 - consider the Y is one right now I can
53:36 - actually just say world.
53:39 - gravity doy equals 2 so let me double
53:42 - the Y so it points down a little bit
53:44 - more and you can see can you see that
53:45 - that's moving let's just make it more
53:47 - extreme just so you can really see let's
53:49 - make this 10 and you can see that
53:51 - gravity is so much stronger right now so
53:54 - that's kind of useful in terms of
53:55 - getting things to fall a bit
53:57 - more pause for a second ah sorry live
54:00 - stream I needed a Kleenex and the the uh
54:03 - the the
54:04 - phone um that's if let me see what the
54:08 - battery is here should I those of you
54:10 - watching this right now hold on
54:11 - everybody those of you watching I'm at
54:13 - 20% battery do you does does anybody
54:15 - want me to really like keep this
54:18 - going is it okay should I turn it off or
54:20 - should I keep it
54:24 - going nobody's nobody's answering me I'm
54:27 - talking to you leave it on okay so I
54:29 - need to get a
54:31 - plug I have a plug for it and what I
54:34 - will do is I I will plug it in to this
54:38 - uh USB port here on this actually let me
54:41 - plug it into this laptop so I'm so it
54:44 - doesn't like appear by accident on my
54:45 - screen as a device uh and then let me
54:48 - bring this over here and plug it
54:53 - in is it plugged in oh my seriously that
54:57 - didn't
54:59 - work USB ports on this laptop don't work
55:02 - can I turn this over rotated the
55:05 - device no don't lock did that work no ah
55:09 - live stream okay hold on a second
55:11 - everybody sorry for this uh digression
55:14 - for the regular live stream I am
55:15 - changing to this camera for a second as
55:18 - I'm going to plug this into my laptop
55:20 - and I don't just want my yeah I know I
55:22 - was upside
55:23 - down uh
55:26 - uh let's see I can't tell if it's
55:29 - charging or not because it doesn't give
55:30 - me a
55:32 - view doesn't let me change it's locked
55:35 - it doesn't tell me if it's
55:39 - charging YouTube get with the program
55:41 - man how come I can't see if I if I go
55:44 - out of this app is it going to stop live
55:45 - streaming hold on a sec all right I'm
55:48 - just gonna have to hope that it's
55:49 - charging I assume that it's charging
55:51 - right now
55:57 - and now going to use the yellow mug and
56:01 - this keyboard to keep it propped up okay
56:06 - uh so if it dies it
56:11 - dies okay there you go okay
56:15 - so oh it's definitely plugged in because
56:18 - okay okay I'm
56:20 - back okay where did I stop I changed the
56:23 - gravity to two
56:31 - okay so I'm changing the gravity back to
56:34 - two and let's just leave it at that for
56:36 - now now let's try adding some boundaries
56:38 - to the world so what were those again a
56:41 - world world. bounds. max. X so I think
56:47 - that would
56:48 - be world. bounds. max. X and i.x equals
56:56 - uh
56:59 - with if I really want to m.x is zero
57:03 - let's just try
57:04 - this will this do what I think and then
57:07 - uh the minimum
57:09 - X oh wait wait wait wait X and Y ah no
57:13 - no hold on Max dox and Y is is like
57:16 - confusing to think about I want the
57:18 - maximum X and Y and then I want the
57:20 - minimum X and Y and the maximum Y is
57:23 - height and the minimum X and Y are both
57:25 - zero okay that's right let's now run
57:27 - this again and
57:30 - see uh I can't tell if I'm actually
57:35 - so I don't think the boundaries does
57:38 - what I think it
57:39 - does um in that uh hold on let me let me
57:44 - make this just 600 by 600 just so I can
57:46 - see right if the boundaries and let's
57:48 - see hold on world I might have done
57:50 - something wrong world. bounds. max. Min
57:55 - right so wouldn't that cause it to have
57:58 - like a hard
58:00 - Edge I guess it
58:02 - doesn't I don't know matter.js to know
58:05 - well enough so I'm guess I'm going to go
58:07 - back and eliminate this
58:10 - whole
58:12 - uh I'm G to
58:17 - um I'm going to eliminate this whole
58:19 - boundary thing does anybody
58:21 - know
58:23 - yeah let's try different numbers
58:28 - just out of
58:29 - curiosity oh look at that so that
58:32 - definitely did something maybe bounds
58:33 - delete the object I don't know so I have
58:36 - no idea what it does you may need to
58:38 - change a parameter in order to allow
58:39 - bound collisions
58:43 - constraints switch the Max and
58:46 - Min uh
58:48 - interesting hold on I'm I'm no longer in
58:50 - this video tutorial this is um maybe
58:53 - bound stops thinking about bodies uh all
58:56 - right let's let's look at the
58:59 - documentation um
59:01 - bounds defines the world bounds for
59:03 - Collision detection so I think that
59:05 - means it just
59:06 - stops um it stops um doing the Collision
59:11 - detection afterwards okay so never mind
59:14 - that was a
59:16 - misdirection um I'm going
59:19 - to
59:21 - um delete this and I'm going to go back
59:26 - to where I just changed the
59:29 - gravity uh to
59:32 - two so I there might have been a weird
59:34 - edit right there but I I just tried
59:36 - something that didn't work out at all so
59:37 - I'm I'm not going to bother including it
59:39 - you can click a link to the live stream
59:41 - that has the full Archive of all my
59:42 - debugging but I'm going to get rid of
59:43 - this add bounds thing because the bounds
59:47 - doesn't actually do what I thought it
59:48 - does the bounds are something you can
59:50 - set just for where you're going to
59:51 - detect collisions but doesn't create
59:53 - hard edges that bounce off we need to
59:55 - actually create our own boundaries for
59:56 - that so actually add bounds
59:59 - should I don't need to go through
60:03 - that boy I was I I I should never stop
60:06 - because it totally kills my momentum and
60:08 - then
60:10 - I then I never um I I I have trouble
60:14 - getting it
60:17 - back okay I I know what I'm going to do
60:23 - now everything is fine with
60:29 - oh I don't know I know something
60:32 - somebody's post ala's posted something
60:34 - about GitHub and an issue but I'm gonna
60:36 - um I'm not going to
60:41 - um I'm not going to worry about that I'm
60:43 - looking here for what I changed
60:48 - 800 okay um the mobile stream could be
60:52 - angled up okay okay hey those of you
60:54 - watching this saying show your screen
60:57 - you're in the wrong live stream this is
60:59 - an extra live stream that's just going
61:00 - from my phone there's a full I'm in the
61:02 - wrong camera ah there's a full live
61:05 - stream over here just draw a box around
61:07 - the canvas is exactly what I'm going to
61:08 - do sorry everybody uh constraints is
61:11 - something else okay everything's
61:13 - everything's gone out of whack I'm gonna
61:14 - get back to momentum here okay
61:17 - everybody okay so Mata for you editing
61:21 - this later uh this is the moment where I
61:24 - just changed the gravity to two
61:28 - okay so changing the gravity to two I'm
61:30 - going to leave it for that right now the
61:32 - next thing on my list over here was add
61:34 - bounds and there is a thing in the world
61:36 - object in addition to gravity called
61:38 - bounds but I'm not going to use that
61:39 - that's more I think for where you're
61:41 - doing Collision detection instead what
61:43 - I'm going to do is just add some um
61:45 - objects myself so I'm going to yet again
61:48 - I'm going to just from particle. JS I'm
61:50 - going to do a save as and I'm going to
61:52 - call this a boundary boundary. JS I'm
61:55 - going to make an object that has a x a y
61:59 - and a width and a height it's going to
62:01 - be and this should be a a
62:04 - boundary and it has it's it is something
62:07 - that's uh
62:09 - static and instead of making a circle
62:12 - it's going to be a rectangle again I'm
62:14 - doing a lot of redundant code here but
62:16 - and then I'm going to keep track of the
62:19 - width and the height in separate
62:23 - variables and um I'm going to say
62:27 - boundary. prototype. show and this
62:29 - should be a rectangle with a width and a
62:32 - height so what I've done very quickly is
62:34 - show you how you can create a
62:37 - rectangular Body by using bodies.
62:39 - rectangle keeping graa a rdth and height
62:40 - instead of a radius otherwise everything
62:42 - else is the same ah I need to add
62:44 - rotation at some point don't let me
62:46 - forget because these things are rotating
62:47 - as they're moving around okay so for
62:49 - this what I'm going to do just really
62:51 - quickly is I'm also going to make an
62:53 - array call it bounds
62:57 - and I'm going to at the end of setup
62:59 - just put one at the bottom VAR b equals
63:03 - a new boundary and so the rectangle is
63:05 - actually thought of based on its Center
63:07 - matter. I'm going to say width divided
63:09 - by two it's going to be at uh
63:13 - height um and I'm actually going to like
63:17 - push it off so what I want is its
63:20 - location to be at height plus
63:23 - 50 because I want its uh width to be the
63:29 - entire width of the
63:31 - window and I want its height to be if
63:35 - it's plus 50 I want its height to be
63:36 - like 100 so it's actually not going to
63:38 - show up on the
63:40 - screen but and I'm oh boundary is not
63:42 - defined because of course I forgot to
63:44 - add it to my index. HTML so I have
63:48 - another Javascript file come on
63:50 - boundary. JS here we go and boundar is
63:55 - not defined and setup so what am I
63:57 - missing here um new boundary ah what did
64:00 - I probably boundary boundary boundary
64:03 - that looks right uh index.html I've got
64:06 - boundary. JS sketch b equals new
64:12 - boundary let's try that again syntax
64:15 - error line number three boundary. JS
64:17 - sorry about that uh is static true ah
64:19 - there should not be a semicolon there
64:21 - creating an object in JavaScript you
64:23 - separate the properties with commas with
64:25 - only one property I don't even need the
64:26 - commas okay apologies for that and here
64:29 - we go so now what we should see is I got
64:31 - to wait a little while but when the ball
64:33 - falls to the bottom there you got you
64:34 - can see that it's there's now a boundary
64:36 - down there so that's perfect that's what
64:38 - I want um and I I I guess I'm not going
64:40 - to make this 800 because it's um kind of
64:43 - going off a little too low down so let's
64:45 - just make this uh 600 by 700 just to
64:48 - push it up a little bit okay that's
64:50 - pretty good okay another thing that I
64:51 - could do here is if you notice every
64:53 - other I don't know if this is really
64:55 - necessary but does feel like there
64:56 - should be another particle right here
64:58 - another Peg right there so that is the
65:00 - odd row so in the odd row uh what if
65:05 - well what if I just did this would
65:07 - anybody really care yeah that's fine
65:09 - there's an extra one also for the even
65:11 - ones I could be more thoughtful about
65:12 - this but that's what I'm going to do
65:14 - right now Okay so we've got the stuff
65:15 - falling down and landing in the bottom
65:18 - okay I definitely need to do something I
65:20 - was wrong uh I do want to delete
65:22 - particles that fall off the edge because
65:24 - maybe they're not all going to end up in
65:26 - the bottom um so I should add something
65:29 - where I check if anything is way off
65:30 - screen to remove it to kind of keep
65:32 - things more efficient so let's add that
65:34 - next and what I need to do to do that is
65:37 - I need each particle is the only thing
65:39 - that's moving so I'm going to say
65:40 - particle. prototype uh do um
65:45 - offscreen equals a function and I'm just
65:48 - going to say
65:51 - um what makes it offscreen if x
65:55 - return X is less than zero
65:59 - that's let's let's say x is less than
66:02 - -00 not X okay so first of
66:04 - all x equals this. body. position dox so
66:10 - that's actually the object's location
66:11 - it's the body's positions X right
66:13 - physics the physics engine matter.js is
66:15 - controlling everything y equals and you
66:18 - know what I kind of wanted to make a
66:19 - nice if statement that I just return a
66:22 - Boolean not an if statement a nice
66:23 - Boolean expression that returns true or
66:24 - false let's just make this simpler if x
66:27 - is less than 50 or X is greater than I'm
66:31 - just going to use a buffer of 50 y + 50
66:34 - uh then return
66:36 - true uh else and I'm doing this in a
66:38 - radically inefficient way but I don't
66:40 - actually ever need to check the top so I
66:43 - can actually just say
66:45 - return if any of these is true if any of
66:48 - these are true then it's off the screen
66:50 - so I can use an or return the result of
66:54 - all of these or
66:56 - Y is greater than height + 50 I'm I'm
67:00 - like hearing the YouTube comments
67:02 - already don't use a long-winded if
67:04 - statement where you could do it in one
67:05 - line of code but this is like kind of
67:06 - cryptic to watch to read but if an or
67:09 - statement if any of things in an or
67:11 - statement are true like false or false
67:13 - or false or false or false or true the
67:16 - whole thing is true right if I'm you
67:19 - know uh yeah okay so if one of these
67:22 - things are true the whole thing's going
67:23 - to return true so now what I need to do
67:26 - is in this Loop here where I'm dealing
67:29 - with all the
67:30 - particles if particles index i. is off
67:38 - screen then I want to say particles
67:41 - index uh particles. splice I comma 1 so
67:46 - I just did this in a matter.js tutorial
67:48 - earlier I'll link to it where I kind of
67:50 - went through the pitfall here because
67:52 - I'm moving taking things out of the
67:54 - array while I'm iter in through it so
67:56 - really a a quick fix that I can do here
67:58 - is just um that I did in that video is I
68:01 - can just subtract one from I because the
68:03 - problem is if I'm removing the I element
68:06 - the other elements slide into it and
68:08 - then I add one I end up skipping over it
68:10 - so this is going to cause me not to skip
68:12 - anything and this should remove anything
68:14 - that's off the screen and of course I
68:16 - have an error particles index I is off
68:18 - screen is not a function uh why is it
68:20 - not a function particle oh I just called
68:23 - it offscreen let's call it is off
68:26 - screen there we go so one thing I want
68:28 - to do just to be sure this is really
68:29 - working is let's not check let's not
68:31 - check the bottom um let's
68:34 - check uh let's check you know to see if
68:38 - they go over 100 pixels so we should see
68:41 - them removed now I did I forgot
68:43 - something really important in addition
68:45 - to removing it from my array I need to
68:47 - tell matter.js that it's not part of the
68:49 - physics anymore so what I'm gonna do F
68:52 - I'm having like a groundhog day Deja Vu
68:55 - thing uh where I'm removing it I also
68:57 - need to
69:00 - say partic uh I need to say uh um
69:04 - particles no no no no
69:07 - world world. remove World particles
69:12 - index ibody I think that's it so I want
69:15 - to tell the matter.js world so I want to
69:18 - remove something from the matter.js
69:19 - world the world function is namespaced
69:21 - in the world object so world. remove
69:23 - from this world which is my world this
69:25 - particular particle's body so take this
69:28 - out of the physics world then delete it
69:29 - from the array then go back
69:38 - one so let's see if that
69:41 - works
69:42 - uh so one thing one way to check if this
69:45 - works by the way is now what I'm going
69:47 - to do is I'm not going to um I'm not
69:52 - going to remove it from my array but I'm
69:53 - going to remove it from the physics
69:54 - world so let's just take that out this
69:57 - is a good way of debugging to see if it
69:58 - works so let's see if after 100 the
70:00 - physics stopped so that that actually
70:02 - did work did I get I probably got like a
70:04 - weird why did it that's interesting how
70:06 - it stopped doing anything but I can see
70:08 - plainly that this is doing what I want
70:09 - it to do um I'm pretty sure this is
70:12 - right um anybody pretty anybody tell
70:16 - tell me if I've done something wrong but
70:17 - I think I've got this in the right order
70:19 - and I can go back to my particle object
70:22 - and change this to like height I don't
70:24 - actually need the height of at all CU I
70:26 - only care if it goes cuz the the bottom
70:28 - is the bottom has a hard boundary so I'm
70:30 - actually just going to take that out I
70:32 - don't need that at all so I actually
70:34 - don't need to check I'm only going to
70:36 - check if it's off screen on the
70:38 - why oh something
70:41 - froze oh I crashed this
70:44 - particular let's just see if this comes
70:46 - back and it works again okay um so this
70:48 - should be doing fine I want to check
70:50 - here's actually a way that I can check
70:51 - so nothing's been removed so far I can
70:54 - say um particles. length there's six
70:58 - right now um particles. length seven
71:01 - particles. length seven come on leave
71:03 - the world
71:04 - people checking if it's
71:07 - working boy these these there's too much
71:10 - friction at the bottom because what I'm
71:12 - going to do is I'm going to say world.
71:14 - bodies oh no this is never going to work
71:15 - because there's a gazillion thing
71:18 - okay edit this part out um it stopped
71:21 - completely because you commented out the
71:22 - splice but still did hold on I got to go
71:25 - back I I want how what's a good way to
71:28 - confirm this is really doing what I want
71:30 - it to do I think I just have to rely on
71:32 - it being
71:34 - correct um
71:36 - let's you may want to check the height
71:38 - if the pellets get off screen by the
71:40 - sides no they're going to
71:43 - fall um so the question is does is no I
71:47 - can figure this out right
71:49 - because um how many um sorry I'm off
71:55 - um the only things are the boundaries so
71:57 - plink
71:59 - .length okay hold
72:05 - on let me de
72:07 - whoops let me debug to see if this is
72:10 - really working and I I want to be
72:12 - thoughtful about this so because I I
72:14 - really want to make sure that I've done
72:15 - the code correctly and I think this will
72:16 - show you a good way to debug this is
72:18 - what I'm going to do is actually
72:20 - completely take out all the
72:22 - Plinko so now I have to have this oh
72:24 - look at that
72:27 - who that's oh no no I got to do this I
72:30 - okay now there's no Plinko okay so now
72:34 - that there's no Plinko and I'm also
72:35 - going to remove this
72:37 - boundary and then I I actually
72:40 - unfortunately now need to go back and
72:42 - add this y back in or Y is greater than
72:46 - height so the way that I'm going to know
72:48 - that this works is um uh put this back
72:52 - in the way that I'm going to know that
72:54 - this is actually working is by looking
72:57 - at the length of the array so particles.
73:01 - length is one it's never going to be
73:04 - more than one because by the time the
73:05 - next one comes one's been removed the
73:08 - question is world. bodies is what
73:10 - matter.js thinks is there is that also
73:13 - one it is so things are working right
73:16 - because if I took out my
73:20 - um if I took out this world. remove if I
73:24 - didn't remove it from the the matter.js
73:25 - world I could look at particles. length
73:28 - and I'm going to continuously see one
73:30 - but now there's going to be three in the
73:32 - world's body so I need to make sure it's
73:34 - being removed from both places so now
73:37 - that now that I feel confident that
73:38 - that's working I can put my boundary
73:41 - back in at the bottom and I can put the
73:45 - uh Plinko back in here okay here we go
73:49 - now looking at my list what do I have
73:53 - left
73:55 - I've increased the gravity I'm removing
73:57 - particles I added a boundary at the
73:58 - bottom I need to add buckets so what I
74:00 - want to do is just add some little
74:02 - separators here and I probably want to
74:04 - align them right with that first um with
74:07 - that first uh row that probably is the
74:10 - way I'm supposed to do it although I'm
74:11 - sure there's a specific layout okay
74:13 - let's add those so how many those need
74:17 - to um let's add those okay so what I
74:20 - need to do those are also going to be
74:22 - boundaries so I'm going to use that
74:24 - boundary array boundaries. push B and
74:28 - now I'm going to write a loop that's
74:30 - similar I only need to do it for one set
74:33 - of columns so let me say I equals um I
74:38 - equal z i is less than column I want to
74:40 - do all these
74:42 - columns uh and what I want to do is say
74:46 - the x is I *
74:49 - spacing right that's what it is
74:52 - for um let's just see let's see what
74:55 - goes on let me try X is X is I *
74:58 - spacing the Y is the bottom so let me
75:02 - think of a height here I'm going to
75:03 - those buckets are going to have a
75:05 - height they're going to be rectangles
75:07 - that are going to have a height of like
75:09 - I don't know let's just try like 30
75:10 - pixels and a width of like 10 pixels so
75:14 - the Y is going to be if I want it to be
75:17 - a boundary that sits um on top of the
75:20 - floor the Y is height minus h / to CU I
75:25 - need a rectangle this is confusing but
75:28 - basically uh if this is the bottom this
75:31 - is my rectangle this is its height this
75:34 - is this is the canvas's height minus
75:39 - height divided two is this location here
75:42 - so once I do that then I can create
75:46 - a new boundary and I'm reusing a
75:49 - variable name which is probably a bad
75:51 - idea but I can create another new
75:53 - boundary which is
75:55 - at X comma y with comma height because I
75:59 - calculated all that already and I can
76:01 - also say boundaries. push B and the
76:04 - reason why I want to put it into an
76:06 - array is because I also want to say
76:11 - um I also want to display all them so
76:14 - for all the boundaries uh boundaries
76:18 - index I doow now what does the boundary
76:21 - show function have it shows a rectangle
76:24 - and let let me I have let me say fill
76:27 - zero stroke zero let me get a different
76:29 - color here and uncaught reference error
76:32 - boundaries is not defined at
76:34 - setup boundaries boundaries boundar did
76:36 - I not make a boundaries
76:38 - array oh I called it bounds so that's
76:41 - nice because it's a little bit shorter
76:43 - of course now I have to change it
76:44 - everywhere so balance. push bounds. push
76:48 - and then I need to Loop through that
76:51 - balance array okay there we
76:53 - go those are so tiny look at the tiny I
76:57 - really okay so those are going to be uh
76:59 - have to be um much taller I guess I
77:03 - wasn't really thinking uh and I don't
77:05 - know why let's they can be white I don't
77:07 - know why I was like I had to change
77:08 - their color so um in the uh uh where am
77:12 - I boundary um let me make the color
77:17 - white and uh here let me color white and
77:21 - then uh what am I doing now on sketch
77:23 - where I create them let's make the
77:25 - height 100 my goodness why are you being
77:28 - so stingy okay does this so uh and then
77:31 - I could use one extra one right I could
77:33 - use one extra one
77:36 - here not cut that off with my laptops I
77:39 - could use an extra one I could use an
77:40 - extra one um so I already said columns
77:45 - plus one columns plus two wait why am I
77:48 - not getting oh because it's it's there
77:49 - but it's right off the screen
77:53 - no uh
77:57 - it must be
77:59 - right uh columns plus whoops so I don't
78:02 - know why am I not seeing this one here
78:04 - should be like half on the screen I
78:06 - would think because this one is oh but
78:10 - uh so let me just offset it a little bit
78:12 - uh 10
78:14 - plus yeah uh I just
78:18 - see um minus 10 just to offset it yeah
78:21 - yeah it's there so I just I have to
78:23 - finesse the spacing stuff a little bit
78:26 - um so I'm going to just leave it at that
78:30 - uh because there's one what I want is
78:32 - but it should be at the center right so
78:35 - X is I times spacing so X is zero um and
78:39 - the width is 10 so I should see five
78:42 - pixels on and five pixels off what if I
78:44 - change this to
78:45 - 20 what what am I doing wrong here oh I
78:49 - know what I'm doing wrong I have I'm not
78:52 - drawing it correctly no wonder
78:57 - so I don't know if that some of that
78:58 - thinking could be edited out I need to
79:00 - move this up again because it's too low
79:01 - for me um but uh I forgot a really
79:04 - really key thing if I go into the
79:06 - boundaries look at this I'm drawing the
79:08 - rectangles in the default way that P5
79:11 - thinks of rectangles with z0 in the top
79:13 - left and that's why they're actually so
79:15 - short I'm just drawing them in the
79:16 - completely wrong place whereas matter.js
79:19 - thinks of rectangles with the
79:20 - registration point in the center so I
79:22 - need to have I'm drawing match what
79:24 - matter. as things which I need to say w
79:26 - mode Center so here we
79:28 - go there we go so now it's right and you
79:30 - can see I that's what I expected it to
79:32 - do it had one sort of half off at the
79:34 - edge so you can see here are my uh
79:36 - Plinko things uh let me just do this
79:39 - oops no let me do this so um you can see
79:43 - it a little bit better uh okay let me
79:46 - make it a little bit um
79:48 - wider uh sketch. JS just to give us some
79:51 - more uh stuff to work with 700
79:55 - comma 800 let's try that there we go so
79:58 - now let's take a look at this oh I I did
80:01 - something weird oh the spacing mind why
80:03 - did I change this I I didn't mean to do
80:06 - that let's go back to what it was okay
80:09 - so here we go uh
80:12 - Plinko so this ends the second part what
80:16 - I'm going to do is um what I'm going to
80:19 - do right now is take a short break and
80:21 - I'm going to come back and add a few
80:23 - sounds to this and during that short
80:25 - break I might also oh one thing I really
80:27 - got to fix is look at it always goes to
80:30 - the left up there and the whole point of
80:32 - this iser to 50% of the time go to the
80:34 - left and 50% of the time go to the right
80:36 - so I need to I'm going to add a few
80:38 - features to improve this in the next
80:39 - video you can think about maybe how you
80:41 - would do that yourself and look at this
80:43 - they're really they're all Landing
80:44 - basically in the same spot too so I need
80:46 - to work on adding a little bit of
80:48 - Randomness to allow for um for uh things
80:52 - to change okay so I'll see you in the
80:53 - next third part part where I'm going to
80:55 - improve on this a little bit see
80:56 - there okay so now I'm going to take a
80:58 - little break and like scratch my nose
81:01 - yeah totally violates the so I need to
81:03 - change the drop point at the
81:06 - top to be slightly off to the left or
81:10 - right and then I want to um then I want
81:15 - to uh um add some sound so I need to do
81:20 - Collision listening so I can add some
81:22 - sound so first of all
81:26 - 7:30 I need to use my phone to text that
81:29 - I'm running a little bit late because I
81:31 - got to finish this um so I'm going
81:35 - to um um I want to go a quick
81:40 - time can I do a can I just make a quick
81:44 - a new audio recording this is like such
81:46 - a terrible
81:49 - idea okay everybody here we go live
81:52 - audio recording
82:06 - oh too loud too loud let's try that
82:10 - again that actually worked kind of well
82:13 - though uh let's do one more time new
82:15 - audio recording I'm just G to have it be
82:17 - further
82:17 - away it was so close to the microphone
82:20 - here we go
82:31 - that's pretty good people are getting
82:33 - confused with the double stream should I
82:35 - shut off the mobile stream um if you're
82:38 - watching this on the mobile stream you
82:40 - should switch to what what happens if
82:42 - you go to user shiftman live does that
82:46 - end up in the correct
82:48 - stream
82:50 - um
82:52 - uh okay um so let me save this as
82:58 - ding under
83:00 - desktop where's my desktop desktop
83:03 - matter.js
83:06 - Plinko
83:08 - um ding what is what kind of fil is it
83:10 - going to save it as and how big is it
83:13 - going to
83:15 - be uh it is oh it is what kind of weird
83:19 - CR oh no it's like an apple audio
83:20 - something nonsense Apple EG 4 audio is
83:24 - that going to work with p5js does
83:26 - anybody know what's its actual file name
83:29 - how come I it's not showing me the
83:30 - extensions I think it's must be MP4
83:33 - right okay
83:36 - um okay thank you uh math ma Mata making
83:40 - the phone stream is unlisted okay
83:42 - that'll
83:43 - help sorry everybody bigger pegs too is
83:45 - a good um it defaults to the mobile oh
83:51 - okay let's see if we can get that
83:53 - resolved um sorry for those of you
83:55 - watching this
83:56 - stream
83:58 - um um I'm looking at
84:02 - you uh this is surprisingly I I really
84:06 - need to deal with uh kind of
84:08 - interesting um so hopefully that's going
84:10 - to get worked out I can always turn off
84:11 - the mobile stream if that doesn't fix it
84:13 - okay so let me just see while we're
84:18 - waiting let me just add let me just test
84:21 - this function preload oh m4a that's
84:25 - never going to work
84:28 - right uh wait I can okay let's see
84:31 - what's the
84:33 - chance this is really I don't want to
84:35 - waste too much time on this um yeah ala
84:39 - would be great to try for your help but
84:41 - I don't have an easy way I I should set
84:42 - up like a shared Google drive or
84:44 - something that people can help me with
84:46 - files um during the where am I
84:49 - desktop uh matter.js let me um I think
84:52 - what I can do is go to a silly quick
84:56 - time well I have audacity I just showed
84:59 - me and I can um trim it to where it
85:03 - starts so I can do that
85:06 - trim and so that's going to that's going
85:08 - to make it start immediately by the way
85:10 - is that really loud is that like killing
85:12 - people's
85:16 - ears when and I should also trim the end
85:20 - because I have
85:21 - a shoot uh it's not too loud okay great
85:26 - so let me save this as ding
85:29 - two I'm also going to trim the end just
85:32 - a little bit
85:35 - here and hit save ding
85:40 - three okay um and then what I want to do
85:43 - is let me try
85:45 - export Audio
85:48 - Only and ah it's not giving me options I
85:51 - guess I could do it in um AAP
85:56 - it let's try opening it on
86:01 - Audacity and let me do
86:04 - export to MP3 that should
86:08 - work ding.
86:11 - MP3
86:14 - blinko yeah
86:18 - okay no it's not saved yet let's see if
86:21 - this works
86:24 - okay so I think I can delete I'm going
86:25 - to just save that
86:27 - original let me just put all this stuff
86:30 - somewhere well let me just I'm going to
86:31 - throw caution to the wind I'm GNA delete
86:34 - those other files they're in the trash
86:35 - if I need to get back okay so that
86:37 - should be the ding did is the
86:39 - um is the
86:43 - um is the Mobile versus live stream
86:46 - thing sort of worked out or it's that's
86:48 - still an issue um okay so this is really
86:52 - filling up here I need to do a different
86:54 - color let me think about this okay
86:58 - so um I'm going close this I'm going
87:01 - leave this running have my code up am I
87:03 - ready to
87:05 - go
87:07 - okay okay
87:11 - um okay wait
87:15 - no okay
87:20 - um okay here we are I'm in the last part
87:22 - three of the Plinko
87:25 - coding Challenge and you can see I
87:27 - actually left this running for a little
87:28 - bit you can see it's kind of like got a
87:30 - little bit of distribution that's skewed
87:32 - to the left there's a lot of stuff to
87:35 - add to this to make it better and I I'm
87:37 - I hope that uh um those of you watching
87:40 - these videos at the end you'll check the
87:42 - description for the link to the code
87:43 - you'll make their own your own version
87:45 - and you'll see when you look at the code
87:47 - at GitHub there's a readme file that if
87:49 - you make your own variation on it you
87:51 - can actually link to so I encourage you
87:53 - to do if you have questions about how to
87:55 - do that ask it in the comments or tweet
87:56 - me at shiftman but what I want to do is
87:58 - at least make a few improvements to this
87:59 - so number one is I really don't want
88:01 - them all to take the exact same path if
88:04 - you notice they're all taking the exact
88:06 - same path do hits that one hits that one
88:09 - hits that one so I need to introduce
88:10 - some variation here the other thing that
88:13 - I want to do is add a sound each time it
88:16 - hits one of these little pegs maybe I
88:19 - don't know if that's going to become
88:19 - incredibly annoying but I'm going to try
88:21 - that and then I also think that I should
88:23 - add maybe some color to these objects
88:25 - because right now it's very hard to sort
88:27 - of see what's going on with all these
88:29 - balls all these particles on top of each
88:31 - each other okay so uh let me hit refresh
88:34 - here this is what it looks like at the
88:35 - beginning so let's at least first add
88:37 - some rainbow colors for lack of a better
88:40 - idea um and I'm going to do kind of the
88:43 - worst design idea possible which is just
88:46 - say uh this. equals random equals a
88:49 - color that has a random and this is P5
88:52 - uh function to create a color
88:55 - variable so I'm going to give each
88:57 - object a color which is a random RG and
89:00 - B value and then I'm going to say uh
89:03 - fill with that color and stroke 255 so
89:06 - let's do that and now what uh oh and
89:08 - this should be this this do this do this
89:11 - do for color and now we can see okay at
89:14 - least this is going to help me look at
89:15 - this by getting a bunch of random colors
89:17 - so I like that that's kind of nice and
89:19 - then I also I don't there's no point for
89:21 - the pegs to be green anymore so let's
89:24 - make those pegs uh just plain
89:26 - oldfashioned white so now here's our
89:29 - Plinko board we've got now now let's add
89:31 - some Randomness now there's a few
89:32 - different ways I could do this number
89:35 - one is I could maybe like offset its X
89:38 - location by a little bit um I could give
89:42 - it kind of a little initial velocity or
89:43 - initial Force I could add kind of like a
89:45 - random wind there's so many ways but um
89:49 - yes I should okay okay okay uh hold on
89:53 - PA
89:55 - pause uh
89:58 - um so I'm getting some complaints about
90:01 - the color which I totally agree and also
90:03 - look at this they're kind of I'm getting
90:06 - some like I think the friction and
90:10 - restitution I should probably work on
90:12 - but I'm not going to worry about that
90:14 - randomize the Hue okay let's go
90:18 - back I'm Al I'm taking your suggestion a
90:20 - little bit too
90:22 - seriously um
90:25 - and I'm going to back back
90:27 - up to where I was filling the color and
90:31 - I'm at some point I'm G to say
90:35 - um and I'm going to say okay Matthew
90:38 - this would be a puzzle to edit this back
90:40 - in but pretend I just typed this and I'm
90:42 - going to fill with that color okay uh
90:45 - ala is making a good suggestion in the
90:46 - chat let me do it with color mode HSB um
90:49 - it'll it'll be a little bit nicer um so
90:51 - I'm going to say color mode uh HSB B
90:54 - which changes the colors to having their
90:56 - a hue saturation and brightness and so
90:59 - all I want to do actually is
91:01 - oops I went to that
91:06 - page
91:08 - um this this is a good suggestion it's a
91:10 - little when you by the way
91:12 - um uh thank you this is uh body.
91:17 - velocity is read only body Doos previous
91:20 - ah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so that's a
91:22 - great Point ala
91:24 - um and I maybe I'll bring it up but I'm
91:25 - still going to just randomize our
91:26 - location I think because that's I think
91:28 - too complex for this sorry everybody do
91:31 - [Music]
91:33 - over let me just go all the way
91:38 - back where am I
91:40 - here
91:42 - uh particle wait hold on I've got too
91:44 - many things
91:46 - open and what I'm going to do
91:49 - is put it back to what it was
91:54 - and try doing the color
91:57 - again there we go this is what it was
92:00 - before
92:02 - okay okay so let's now um let's now add
92:05 - color to these uh particles so what I'm
92:09 - going to do in the particle uh object is
92:11 - I'm just going to add a new variable
92:13 - this doc color and actually um ala was
92:16 - made the suggestion several times now in
92:17 - the chat I'm going to change the color
92:19 - mode to HSB so instead of creating a
92:22 - color as a red green and blue value I'm
92:24 - going to create a color as a hue
92:25 - saturation and brightness which I think
92:27 - will make it more rainbowy since that's
92:29 - the kind of that's about my only way of
92:32 - thinking of colors so I'm going to say
92:34 - and actually I'm just going to give it a
92:35 - hue of this. hue equals random 360 I
92:38 - believe the default range is between 0
92:40 - and 360 for Hue values in p5js so now I
92:44 - can say uh I can say fill uh that random
92:48 - Hue and we'll give it um a saturation of
92:50 - 255 and a brightness of 255 and let's um
92:54 - we'll take out the stroke we can also
92:57 - give it a little alpha or maybe it
92:58 - doesn't need Alpha and let's see what
93:00 - happens there we go oh look what I've
93:01 - done so this is giving me now um some
93:04 - colorful um particles but notice how
93:06 - everything else changed because
93:08 - everything else now is a huee saturation
93:10 - brightness so what I need to do is look
93:12 - at everything else that I color this is
93:14 - why I didn't want to do that but uh so
93:16 - I'm just going to change first of all
93:18 - I'm just going to make everything uh
93:19 - White the Plinko things and the
93:22 - boundaries can also be white and then
93:24 - the background can be
93:29 - um uh oh the background can be uh in
93:34 - boundary I've lost my oh no the
93:36 - background in sketch oh I've caused so
93:38 - many problems best of intentions the
93:41 - background can be uh black let's just do
93:44 - that there we go okay I don't know so
93:46 - color is not my strong suit here this is
93:48 - this is so ugly but it's going to have
93:50 - to do right now you are going to improve
93:52 - this and make it beautiful
93:55 - okay so um here we go but now the real
93:58 - important thing that I wanted to do is
94:00 - randomize how they're falling just a
94:02 - little bit so how can I do that um and
94:06 - uh I want to randomize how they're
94:07 - falling so there's a bunch of ways I
94:08 - could do this
94:10 - so uh there's you going to need to
94:13 - really read the documentation if you
94:14 - want to like give it kind of an initial
94:16 - velocity it really actually um there's
94:18 - some tricky ways to do it there's a set
94:20 - velocity function that you can use but
94:22 - I'm going to do something kind of
94:23 - simpler which is I just want to um I
94:27 - just want to give it kind of like a
94:29 - little bit of a random offset in its
94:31 - location so if I go to the particle
94:33 - object um where I where I set the
94:36 - particle location is here The Circle at
94:38 - X so what I'm going to do is I'm just
94:40 - going to say X plus equals
94:42 - random1 I'm just going to give it like a
94:44 - little bit of an offset either to the
94:46 - left or the right let's see what that
94:48 - does fell to the right oh fell to the
94:51 - left so I think this is better now so we
94:53 - can see that they're now moving to the
94:55 - left or the right and you know again I'm
94:57 - not sure if there's some Nuance here to
94:59 - really like how we need to like do all
95:01 - the spacing so they bounce against
95:03 - things um more properly well let's let
95:05 - this run for a little while maybe the
95:07 - buckets should be bigger maybe the you
95:09 - know there's lots of things you could do
95:10 - to affect this but I'm going to let this
95:11 - run for a little while and what I'm
95:13 - going to do is add sound now it's quite
95:15 - possible that the sound I recorded my
95:17 - bell so when it hits oh that's going to
95:19 - not be good because it's going to ring
95:21 - the bell quite a bit so I probably need
95:23 - a another and you can see that they're
95:25 - like going off the left and the right
95:27 - but I'm removing them that's fine
95:28 - there's all of you are going to fix this
95:30 - and make it much better let's at least
95:32 - add the sound so now what I have in the
95:35 - um the directory here uh I did this dur
95:39 - when I took a little break if I go to
95:41 - the Plinko example I have an MP3 file
95:44 - ding called
95:46 - Ding which makes a little ding I have a
95:49 - feeling this is going to be somewhat
95:51 - annoying that it's going to make a ding
95:53 - sound but let's let's give it a try
95:54 - anyway and see what happens I think it
95:56 - would be much more exciting to have them
95:57 - be musical notes and maybe in in a
95:59 - certain key or something and it plays a
96:01 - little song I hope you create that so um
96:04 - you can use sound synthesis so I am just
96:06 - going to add a function
96:09 - preload which is a an easy way to load
96:11 - some media assets before the sketch
96:14 - starts without a call back although I
96:15 - certainly could use a call back and I'm
96:17 - going to make a variable called Ding I'm
96:18 - going to say ding equals load sound uh
96:21 - ding. MP3 now one thing I need to make
96:23 - sure sure is in
96:25 - index.html I don't see oh I do have a
96:27 - reference to
96:28 - p5.js so you need to also load the sound
96:31 - library and now what I'm going to do is
96:35 - uh go back to here and I just want to
96:38 - play the sound so what I want to do is
96:40 - I'm just going to add
96:42 - function uh Mouse
96:46 - pressed uh and I'm just say ding.
96:49 - playay so let's just see what this
96:51 - does oh I I
96:57 - so that's basically all I need is that
96:59 - really loud I hope that's okay um I I
97:03 - think I have the volume kind of turned
97:04 - down as it goes in um so now here's the
97:07 - thing I thought oh this will be an easy
97:10 - problem all I have to do is play the
97:12 - sound every time a particle hits a
97:18 - Plinko or a peg oh boy I'm going to have
97:22 - to look at the matter.js documentation
97:25 - because the problem is M
97:28 - oops this camera's
97:34 - off I'm going to have to look at the
97:36 - matter.js
97:38 - documentation because the problem is I'm
97:41 - not in control of the physics remember I
97:43 - just set up the world and said put these
97:44 - things in in these locations and let it
97:48 - go about to sing a copyrighted song
97:50 - which I stopped myself to do okay you
97:53 - really don't want me to um so um how do
97:57 - I know if I'm not in control of the
97:59 - physics engine when a particle hits a
98:01 - peg you know I could start to look at
98:02 - their distance against each other but
98:04 - that's then I'm like the whole point of
98:06 - this I'm not um so Mo so I'm not the one
98:09 - I don't want to do that because then I'm
98:10 - rewriting the physics engine the physics
98:12 - engine is doing this so most physics
98:14 - engines come with some type of event
98:16 - listener a way that I can get a call
98:18 - back function that's triggered Whenever
98:20 - two bodies Collide so I actually have no
98:22 - idea how to do this I haven't tried to
98:24 - do this yet with matter.js I've done it
98:26 - with box 2D and other physics engines so
98:28 - let me come over here and I guess we're
98:30 - just going to have to start looking in
98:31 - the matter.js
98:33 - documentation um so I'm going to look in
98:37 - uh documentation what am I looking for
98:40 - events that sounds right Events off
98:44 - events on a call back function to a
98:46 - given event so this might be right
98:48 - trigger no events on I have a feeling
98:51 - that's it subscribe Now what are my
98:53 - possible event
98:55 - names and what is the
98:57 - object I need some more information here
98:59 - matter.js documentation so let me think
99:02 - about this maybe there's an
99:04 - example uh is there an example matter.js
99:08 - example Collision
99:12 - event uh uh um let's look at this event
99:16 - system issue Collision
99:21 - start um oh do I I do I need Collision
99:25 - matters. events object so Collision so
99:28 - this looks like what I want my oh the
99:30 - object is the engine and collisions
99:32 - start and then I get an event which has
99:34 - pair so this will do for me
99:42 - whoops okay so this looks like exactly
99:45 - what I want to do I want to know when a
99:47 - when a collision has started and I want
99:49 - to know which things have collided so
99:52 - let's grab this code and put it
99:57 - in right here so and okay so matters.
100:02 - event so what I'm going to do I'm gonna
100:03 - I'm going to keep with our way of doing
100:05 - things and I'm going to say events
100:06 - equals matter. events just to keep that
100:10 - in my list of aliases and I'm going to
100:12 - say events on and I should I need to do
100:15 - this in setup so as after I've made the
100:18 - engine I can create I want to assign a
100:21 - collision start event and I'm going to
100:23 - take this out here and say
100:26 - Collision so I'm GNA I think it'll be a
100:28 - little easier to read here if I have my
100:30 - own function called a collision that
100:33 - receives an argument called event so the
100:36 - idea here and I apologize for this not
100:38 - being let me see if I can move this over
100:39 - a little bit so the idea here is that
100:42 - I'm going to say I want to assign a
100:45 - collision start event with this
100:47 - particular engine to this function
100:48 - called collision and then this function
100:50 - Collision will automatically receive an
100:52 - argument called event which is going to
100:54 - have information about what's collided
100:56 - so I'm just going to say console.log
100:59 - event I just want to see what those
101:01 - events look like so let's see if this
101:05 - works ah okay okay stop stop there's too
101:08 - many just's too many of you I just want
101:10 - to look at one so what I see is
101:12 - Collision start a pair the pair has an
101:16 - object it has a body a and a body B I
101:19 - have a feeling that these are the two
101:21 - things that have collided body a and
101:23 - body B so that's good I need that
101:26 - there's probably other there's
101:28 - information about the Collision all
101:30 - sorts of par there's all sorts of stuff
101:31 - in there but I think it's enough for me
101:33 - to look at the event
101:36 - pairs index
101:39 - zero why could there be multip I guess
101:41 - there could be multiple pairs in the
101:42 - same time um that that come into one
101:44 - event but I'm going to um so I want to
101:46 - look at the pairs are event
101:50 - Pairs and then the
101:53 - um
101:56 - Collision is the I'm going to do a loop
101:59 - I'll do a loop that's fine there could
102:01 - be multiple pairs so this is an
102:06 - array probably unnecessary it looks like
102:08 - there's just one pair each time but I'm
102:10 - going to say body a equals pairs index
102:14 - I body a and body b equals pairs index I
102:20 - body B now bodies can have labels names
102:23 - and IDs which could allow you to uh and
102:26 - I think I'm going to need to do this
102:28 - actually I'm going to need to assign
102:29 - them a label um so uh let's just look at
102:32 - this for a second so let's look at what
102:34 - I'm getting and let's just look at
102:36 - console.log body
102:38 - a and body B oh maybe I need to do look
102:42 - at those separately let's just look at
102:44 - one of them let's just look at body a so
102:46 - here we go refresh wait hold on why is
102:49 - that stupid X thing there okay refresh
102:51 - so okay now I'm getting I'm getting a
102:53 - body oh look it even says Circle body it
102:56 - has a label and it has an ID so this one
103:00 - has a label it has a different ID so
103:03 - this is good so the thing that I want to
103:04 - know though is all these things can
103:07 - collide with each other I want to know
103:09 - only when a particle has collided with a
103:12 - Plinko I mean I might want to know when
103:14 - particles collide with each other or
103:15 - particles collide with the the ground
103:17 - body or the wall these bucket things but
103:19 - just for right now I want to know when
103:22 - so so so uh the way that I'm going to do
103:24 - this is there's probably a mechanism in
103:27 - matter.js that might handle this for me
103:30 - but here's the thing this is my thing
103:32 - particle my particle has a body in it
103:34 - and what I want to do is I'm going to
103:35 - say this do
103:38 - body dot uh I'm gonna this is what box2d
103:42 - does actually box2d allows you to sign
103:43 - user data so I'm just going to kind of I
103:46 - I'm trying to think of what's the best
103:47 - way you know actually I'm just say
103:50 - particle oh no no no uh I'm going to say
103:54 - type uh yeah I'm just to say type equals
103:57 - I'm just I'm just going to use a string
103:59 - so I'm adding my own property to the
104:02 - matter.js body called type and I could
104:05 - use the lab maybe I should just use its
104:07 - label I'm going to overwrite its label
104:09 - how about that and I'll call it particle
104:11 - because I'm not using the label for
104:12 - anything else I don't think internally
104:15 - particle. JS is using the label so I
104:17 - need to give particle a label and then
104:19 - in the Plinko thing I'm going to say
104:23 - I'm going to give it a label as
104:25 - Plinko so now what I want to do is in
104:29 - that
104:29 - listener right where I have this
104:32 - Collision I want to console log body. a.
104:36 - label let's look at
104:39 - this particle particle particle particle
104:42 - poo particle particle so let me look at
104:44 - body. a label and body. B label so now
104:48 - we're
104:49 - seeing particle and a plink go particle
104:51 - and Plinko particle and Plinko PLO and a
104:52 - partic particle Plinko and a particle
104:54 - Plinko and a particle particle in a
104:55 - rectangle body right that's the bottom
104:57 - so I only want to play the sound if it's
104:59 - a particle and a Plinko so what I can
105:02 - say now
105:06 - is if body
105:10 - a is a
105:13 - particle and body
105:17 - B oh label so hold on uh let's just call
105:21 - label a equals body A's
105:25 - label and label
105:27 - B is body's B's label got this whole
105:32 - extra Collision listening thing in this
105:34 - video tutorial all of a sudden so now I
105:36 - to say if label a is a particle and
105:39 - label B is a
105:44 - Plinko uh what is what was it called
105:46 - ding.
105:48 - playay and then uh this is a very silly
105:50 - way that I'm going to write this because
105:53 - there's all sorts of nicer ways I can
105:54 - write this but also you know if the
105:56 - first one was a Plinko and the second
105:57 - one is a particle also play the sound so
106:00 - let's give this a try and see what
106:05 - happens oh my
106:12 - God okay okay stop
106:16 - stop please nobody ever run this program
106:19 - again you get the idea though so I
106:21 - encourage you to think be more
106:23 - thoughtful about this let's comment this
106:25 - out right
106:27 - now let's comment that out to think
106:29 - about how could you you know have a
106:31 - different label or a different type for
106:33 - each row how could you have a bunch of
106:35 - different sound did that really hurt
106:36 - everybody's ears I'm so sorry um I there
106:40 - needs to be a warning is that going to
106:42 - be like do I need to do that again so
106:44 - hopefully this isn't ruining everybody's
106:46 - ears but I'm actually done with this
106:47 - this is Plinko I'm going to let it run
106:50 - uh for a little while uh thank you for
106:53 - watching this was
106:55 - uh I could have recorded my uh train
106:59 - whistle thing um so this is the Plinko
107:03 - coding challenge in matter.js I hope
107:05 - that you make a better version of this
107:07 - maybe you think of create I me you uh
107:10 - you think about the visual design of it
107:11 - you think about the sound aspect of it
107:13 - you think about why you're using it in
107:14 - the first place um perhaps you can use
107:17 - it as a part of a game or something else
107:19 - or a poetry generator um I'm sure there
107:21 - are like lots of in accuracies in terms
107:23 - of like an actual perfect Plinko board
107:27 - that creates a nice normalized
107:28 - distribution you should see a nice bell
107:30 - curve so maybe you can make a variation
107:32 - of it where you really see that bell
107:34 - curve U perfectly um so share those with
107:36 - me um share share the versions you make
107:39 - and uh I'll see you in another coating
107:41 - challenge someday thanks for
107:44 - watching
107:46 - okay
107:48 - um so there we go everybody it is8
107:52 - o'clock this always happens this has now
107:54 - been almost a two-hour live stream of
107:57 - the Plinko coding challenge the thing
107:59 - that I want to do let me see if I can
108:00 - find this example really quickly the
108:02 - thing that I didn't get to today but
108:04 - I'll give you a future teaser I I don't
108:05 - know when I'm going to get to this too
108:07 - many things I wanted to do today I wish
108:09 - I could just stay here all night and
108:11 - keep coding it's lots of fun um I'm
108:15 - going to go to my uh class syllabus
108:19 - github.com shiftman I'm just going to
108:21 - show you where this example is for any
108:22 - of you who are interested I'm going to
108:24 - go to uh repositories this is the
108:27 - current course that I'm teaching at NYU
108:29 - physics and animation I made an extra
108:31 - example so I'm just going to instead of
108:33 - cloning the repository I'm just going to
108:34 - download it and um I'm going to open it
108:38 - up and this is the other coding
108:41 - challenge that I hope to do and this one
108:43 - I've actually done already so unlike
108:45 - that Plinko one I'm kind of doing it
108:46 - from scratch this is
108:49 - essentially um
108:53 - this is um this is exactly my coding
108:57 - Challenge number something somebody can
108:59 - tell me in the chat it's a coding
109:00 - challenge where I made a cloth
109:02 - simulation in 3D this is exactly that
109:04 - cloth simulation 10,000 steps on my
109:06 - Fitbit um cloth simulation but instead
109:09 - of a cloth hanging down a cloth attached
109:11 - to a pole on the side with wind blowing
109:14 - it's a flag simulation and what I'm
109:16 - going to do really quickly before I run
109:18 - it for you is I'm just going to go to
109:20 - where I'm rendering it and I'm going to
109:21 - comment out out this uh texture and I'm
109:25 - going to say uh stroke 255 and I'm going
109:28 - to run
109:30 - it and oh you can't see that so um well
109:35 - what this is if I zoom in is it's a lot
109:37 - of uh hold
109:38 - on stroke weight
109:42 - one um you can see this is that mesh and
109:46 - uh you can see this is like a little
109:47 - flag simulation and there's a little
109:49 - pearing noise wind um uh pushing it to
109:52 - the right
109:53 - and what I can do the thing that I want
109:55 - to show you is in addition to seeing
109:57 - that mesh I can turn off the stroke and
109:59 - I don't remember what it's using it's
110:01 - using a cat uh this cat uh so I can
110:05 - texture it with that cat and now I have
110:09 - my cat flag so this is the thing that I
110:12 - wanted to do I guess I will pick this up
110:14 - next week I doesn't seem very likely
110:16 - that I'll have time to do a bonus live
110:18 - stream before next Friday so far in the
110:20 - last two days I did a live stream
110:21 - yesterday for two hours this morning for
110:23 - two hours and now for about 2 hours it's
110:25 - like 6 hours in two days which is pretty
110:26 - good thank you patrons for like helping
110:29 - motivate me to do this kind of stuff um
110:31 - but I will come back and uh show you
110:33 - this so someone's asking ah the reason
110:35 - why I wanted to show this is um I'm
110:38 - having trouble getting image texturing
110:40 - to work in P5 and I haven't dug into it
110:43 - I have a feeling it's mostly not
110:44 - implemented yet um but I have seen some
110:47 - texture examples this is running and
110:48 - processing and using 3D so um but you
110:52 - could do this in 2D texturing Works in
110:54 - 2D but I haven't really investigated how
110:56 - well this works in P5 so if anybody
110:57 - wants to download this example and sort
110:59 - of help figure out like what's working
111:01 - in P5 what's not working maybe dig into
111:03 - that maybe we could work together as a
111:05 - community to uh help add this feature to
111:07 - P5 to get this texturing working um
111:10 - that's something oh a gif on a flag yes
111:13 - that's got to happen right okay so
111:15 - anyway I encourage you to check out this
111:16 - example um I am now going to play my
111:18 - Goodbye
111:20 - song I have this mobile live stream is
111:23 - still going uh hello uh mobile live
111:27 - stream uh you can now uh see all the
111:31 - pieces for an action you can see here
111:34 - there's my computer there's my preview
111:37 - screen this is the chat that's going on
111:39 - right now just the simulation would be
111:41 - great in P5 without the texturing so
111:43 - that should work what well beard
111:44 - scratching noise is so nice oh did I
111:46 - have like a weird beard scratching noise
111:48 - um you know the Goodbye song is called
111:50 - uh rainbow from
111:53 - I believe I got it from I I think I got
111:56 - it from free music archive so I often
111:59 - use a free music archive to
112:03 - um to look for a royaltyfree uh public
112:07 - domain Creative Commons licensed music
112:11 - um
112:12 - Etc uh textures on a sphere you
112:14 - absolutely can do uh one nice thing
112:17 - about inp um Urban at work is asking one
112:19 - thing about processing if you want to
112:20 - texture a sphere is you can actually
112:22 - processing will texture it for you
112:24 - automatically if you use the pshape
112:26 - object so I'm doing it manually by
112:27 - setting all the vertices of the shape
112:30 - and the pixels but um a sphere you don't
112:32 - you don't you could do that uh yourself
112:34 - and I have a sphere geometry tutorial
112:36 - that you could watch um please read some
112:39 - numbers is there are people really
112:41 - requesting me to read
112:43 - numbers pause how do I how do I pause
112:47 - the that pauses
112:50 - everything that stops IT
112:54 - all right here's some more numbers for
112:55 - you guys you asked for it my children
112:58 - are probably going to bed right now
112:59 - course they're not going to bed right
113:00 - now on a Friday probably bouncing off
113:03 - the walls but tonight I won't read this
113:06 - to them what have we been reading that's
113:08 - good we've been reading some really good
113:09 - stuff
113:09 - recently uh I'm
113:13 - 24,179 78,500
113:15 - [Music]
113:22 - now I'm doing
113:23 - [Music]
113:25 - it okay Q&A not numbers yes I think
113:29 - that's a smart let me go back to my song
113:31 - started over so You' got an extra three
113:33 - minutes so I'm going to look for some
113:36 - questions in the
113:42 - chat um pi to 30,000
113:47 - digits four numbers read pie look here's
113:51 - the thing people people for those of you
113:53 - who are watching this book a million
113:57 - random digits I will read the entire
114:01 - book if I get to a million
114:04 - subscribers I will read the entire book
114:06 - I don't know if that's realistic or how
114:07 - I'm going to make that happened so I
114:10 - probably should really got to regret
114:11 - having said that cuz at least should
114:13 - read one page and figure out how long
114:15 - that takes cuz there's a lot of pages
114:17 - but that's my
114:19 - plan it would it be would it be possible
114:21 - to change that falling particle to a
114:23 - rectangle and change the color upon
114:24 - Collision right yes absolutely so and I
114:28 - forgot I never did anything about
114:29 - rotation so I completely forgot the
114:32 - rotation uh time uh so okay um can I
114:38 - solve the Rubik's Cube I'm not good at
114:39 - things like the Rubik's Cube no I'll
114:41 - just be sweating um why does this book
114:44 - exist it's actually a really there's
114:45 - actually a really good reason why this
114:47 - book exists this book is from the' 40s I
114:50 - believe and we take it for granted that
114:52 - we we could just have random number
114:54 - generators at are fingertips to run
114:56 - certain kinds of simulations to simulate
114:58 - how stock prices might to think about
115:00 - random walks so to speak and um you know
115:04 - I I could read you this introduction
115:05 - here the volume you are holding
115:06 - documents a remarkable undertaking by a
115:08 - group of mathematicians engineers and
115:09 - data processors that ran in the 1940s
115:11 - and 50s to create a very large assembly
115:14 - of randomly distributed numbers or
115:16 - digits so um you know there's a lot of
115:20 - cryptography problems all sorts of of
115:22 - scientific mathematical problems that
115:23 - require random numbers and in the 40s
115:26 - and 50s you couldn't just say math.
115:28 - random so is Plinko still running let's
115:32 - yeah I should always have a cat flag
115:34 - behind me
115:37 - uh yep Plinko is still running so this
115:40 - is not tuned very well so many of them
115:42 - it's not very full because so many of
115:43 - them are going off the edge so um I need
115:46 - to work on that uh what was your first
115:50 - computer and programming language my
115:52 - first computer was an Apple 2
115:54 - plus somewhere in elementary school and
115:57 - I did learn some basic when I had
116:00 - that
116:02 - um ah on your Vimeo page I saw a video
116:04 - called Neo Geo that that project was
116:07 - actually made with box 2D um so it's a
116:10 - sort of crazy it's a it's a
116:12 - collaboration with an artist named um
116:14 - Marina
116:16 - ziral um and so this is I'm looking for
116:20 - the one though
116:22 - I have like sort of high resolution yeah
116:24 - this one so um this is a video that is a
116:29 - kind of simulation of in a way like oil
116:32 - drilling not an accurate scientific
116:34 - unfortunately it's U I'm sure the
116:36 - YouTube compression is kind of a
116:38 - disaster here trying to reshow this but
116:40 - and in a little bit there'll be like a
116:42 - little bit of a
116:43 - gush of oil there we go um so this is
116:46 - all crazily done with box 2D it does not
116:49 - run in real time so all the physics were
116:52 - surrendered after the fact okay I got to
116:54 - get go and get home um I'm going to see
116:56 - if there's one last question anything in
116:58 - slack uh Plinko still running I checked
117:01 - so thank you everybody for watching
117:03 - thank you for your support um I hope to
117:05 - next week launch the coding train store
117:09 - uh if you're interested in sort of
117:10 - t-shirts and mugs I think is probably
117:12 - all we have at this point but I'm using
117:14 - a service called printful.com so I if
117:17 - people have real interest in other
117:18 - products I could definitely release them
117:20 - uh it's uh and then I might also if I
117:22 - have time then it's a you know it does
117:24 - ship internationally but is expensive so
117:26 - I might look for some other
117:26 - International options so that's one
117:28 - thing uh I talked about Google summer of
117:30 - code I meant to talk about it in uh
117:33 - that's the T-shirt I'm wearing in the
117:34 - earlier this morning live stream so um I
117:37 - should try to find but what I need to
117:39 - remember to do someone remind me is to
117:41 - tweet out a link to this morning's live
117:43 - stream the time code where I talk about
117:44 - Google summer of code so if you're
117:46 - interested I mentioned a bit about that
117:49 - um and can I sell this yellow it's not
117:52 - like a thing now uh that's sort of
117:55 - interesting idea well I'm going to have
117:56 - a coding train mug as soon as I get mine
117:58 - it just hasn't been shipped to me yet um
118:01 - I based in New York City show us the mug
118:04 - well I have this mug I have a magic mug
118:06 - look at this it's an invisible
118:09 - mug
118:11 - uh because as we
118:14 - know it's important when you're riding a
118:17 - train and coating to stay hydrated okay
118:20 - thank you everybody I'm going to go over
118:21 - here and click this this stop button uh
118:24 - I I appreciate all the support um uh you
118:26 - can send me messages on Twitter at
118:28 - shiffman you should subscribe I guess
118:30 - and like things that YouTube likes that
118:33 - I guess um it helps people find the
118:35 - videos you can share it with other
118:37 - people uh one thing I love if if you
118:39 - have a friend who wants to learn
118:42 - programming please share with them my
118:43 - beginner playlists um if if you think
118:46 - they would be helpful to that person
118:48 - because I'm always curious to see if
118:49 - someone can really learn from nothing
118:50 - through my channel uh
118:52 - and of course there's the patreon as
118:54 - well which ala posted in the chat thank
118:57 - you okay so I'm clicking the button and
118:59 - signing off it's 8 o'clock I'm an hour
119:01 - later than I said I would be so thank
119:03 - you uh family for uh tolerating me being
119:06 - late on a Friday as I've always been
119:07 - these last few weeks and I will see you
119:10 - um I will see you all soon

Cleaned transcript:

now here do you see me here do you see me here I'm live in two places at once on YouTube or this is not working I have no idea what's GNA happen is it the same URL or is this one just going to take over um someone please let me know what's going on uh it's working fine on both fantastic okay so um we'll just keep so people are asking what is this other live stream I don't know which one you are that's the thing man whoa um I don't know there's two live streams going on one is the camera that I'm talking to you directly right here this is my usual live stream that's going out through a computer down there through wirecast onto YouTube over here I'm talking to you right now you are my phone hi phone you are broadcasting through the YouTube mobile app what before I started you this camera over here I did this camera over here and I walked it around to show a walkthrough of my studio this eventually will end and they'll both be archived um so do you see the phone you see the phone I don't know what's going on okay um so I don't know I'm I'm like surrounded by computer screens and cameras I'm going a little bit crazy uh yeah the phone live stream does not seem to have a delay on it which is kind of amazing and this one uh really does seem to have a quite a big delay as it always has had okay um where will you hear the train whistle where will the train whistle go okay first thing first which is not the first thing but the last thing or the the not last thing I need to uh quit this silly thing I need to go onto up I'm there I need to uh get my soundboard uh for those of you who are on the uh this is a very ancient old iPad that I dug out of the closet at home uh and and if I turn it on and go to airplay this is me continuing now my walkthrough of the studio last step ah how come that's not oh it must be logged onto the wrong WiFi network hold on everyone I'm going to go to settings oh this is terrible what time is it by the way 609 okay oh no I'm on the right WiFi I'm not going to worry about this too much because uh I don't want to waste your time while I try to hook this up what if I go here and say this is on the right WiFi and what if I go to here and say uh rebroadcast Services um okay let's see if that works huh weird all right whatever no soundboard right now uh what is my best dad joke um thank you Josh gorin on Twitter this is not my best one she the only one I can think of right now you know I've been thinking a lot about the creators of Mad Libs and they must be laughing all the way to the shoe oh if only had my soundboard I could play my butum chunk or something let me I don't understand why is this not airplane I'm GNA just T power it off and I'm I'm going to power it back on I'm going to quit this this is really this is a totally unnecessary uh thing uh and I'm on this particular WiFi Network yes um that's not even a joke yeah uh what did the um why why did the um you know one of my my kids used to love to um tell the interrupting cow knock knock joke knock knock who's there the interrupting cow the interrupting cow moo but he would always just say the moo after you said the whole thing the interrupting cow moo thought that was so funny okay um okay um so what am I here so I did a live stream earlier this morning uh where I did a bunch of tutorials about a physics Library called matter.js and I am back I am back and I'm here to continue and I would like to do uh oh there's some good jokes in the chat why did the shy Pebble want to be when she grew up I'm a little bit afraid maybe am I am I am I starting a joke that's going to be inappropriate I hope not um uh so I but here's my okay here's my dad joke except I have nobody to do this with I have to do it with myself knock knock who's there the interrupting coefficient of friction the interrupting coefficient of friction Mew there you go okay um let's see if this works I'm going to try to airplay this wow it's completely this this is the I need a new I just definitely need a new way of doing these sound effects this way is the worst this ancient iPad doesn't even have the airplay option is like totally gone now I don't know what happened to it this is here I really should just give up on this instead what I'll do is give up on this okay I'll come back to it later okay um now I think some people really enjoyed that actually strangely enough uh okay okay yeah I I I I just this uh okay so I still oh so okay somebody tell me how many people are in the actual YouTube chat which is this camera right here because right now I see that there are 540 in my green wall chat um okay uh come on come on soundboard I just feel oh airplan ah there it is mirroring turn on mirroring appear this is the worst this is the worst this is like debugging a totally unnecessary thing it just it appeared so I thought okay this will work now and now I've made it even worse because it doesn't work uh oh so sad so sad so sad because now at least when it's Friday evening there's nobody on this floor and I don't worry too much about making a lot of noise and I can uh play music and be a little bit more loud and ridiculous so I feel like you know hey music um okay so I'm gonna give up on this uh and I'm going to get with you know you know what the thing is I can play my music anyway it just uh won't go through wirecast let's see what happens I always forg kind of works I don't know if you can hear that through the mic um okay wow I'm looking at everybody's awesome screenshots of me streaming in multiple directions okay let's see what's going on here I'm going to open up atom I am going to open up terminal I am going to run a server I'm going to minimize terminal I am going to open up a browser which apparently is already open I'm going to go to Local Host and I'm going to check out the last example I made which was this one there it is The Swinging circles um and what I would like to do first is do a coding Challenge and that coding challenge is I'm sure yeah I'm going to do the coding Challenge and I um I'm going to do a coding Challenge and the coding challenge I'm going to do is to make Plinko Plinko with matter.js um how's that going to go what do you guys think about that this is 100% something I have never done before sometimes a coding challenge is like I did it like a couple years ago or like this is an example that I already have that I know I looked at this other person's thing I have no no plan whatsoever other than the words Plinko p5js and matter.js are you with me okay affirmative I take that as an affirmative okay so uh what do I first need to do I would like to uh grab something that I can use like this folder and I'm going to call this uh Plinko and now I'm going to go to Adam and I'm going to go to Plinko and I think I'm going to delete that and I'm going to go to sketch I'm going to delete everything but setup and draw and ah goodbye camera okay um okay that mug from the phone oh did I put the I put the mug in got to stay hydrated okay um this is by the way uh okay oh my slack disconnected oh try now try now come on come back okay um sorry about that everybody okay now ah you over there you over there you over there that's me okay create canvas 400400 background 51 this is what I'll do beforehand and whoops let's go to Plinko and let's think about this now I um that's really what it is let's give myself a bit more space 600400 make it a little bigger and then let's go to index.html and get rid of box. JS um I might want to use the Dom library at some point I might want to use the Sound Library interesting okay so I think we're ready for Plinko ready for party parrot Plinko time okay uh all right how long till the my phone battery dies that's a real question I do have a charger plug and I could try to plug in in or something ah why isn't this I kind of like I want to restart my computer let me I let me just do just give me one little bear with me for one second I'm GNA turn my WiFi off here I'm gonna um I'm going to go to settings here and I'm going to go turn my WiFi off here then I'm going to turn I'm going to unplug and plug back in this router just give it another chance one last chance and it is booting up router is starting up so now I should be able to let me quit this air server thing let me turn this back on last chance I swear this is the last time I'm going to try this then I'm moving on uh then I'm going to try to log into this oops no no no there we go I'm going to go there wifi back on let's connect uh then I'm going to turn back on air server and I am going to go to airplay Mac Pro ah there we go air server there we go it worked all right so now we're live with the soundboard we're going to go to the soundboard open that up good evening welcome to the coding rainbow ah I mean shoot good evening welcome to the coding train as we pull into the station getting ready to play a nice game of Plinko let let's continue reading from the coding train story book a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates uh when we last left off 9888 and now 66,9 6,830 53,6 56 14663 tune in next time on the coding train and we'll continue our story book I'm going to put this down over here now I need some new stick come on people help me out here I I got a I got I got some time so little time in the week to even prepare so I can't even come up with new material okay uh now uh here we go let's get ready for this coating challenge I really want it to have like a sound of Dan first of all it's an incredibly long snare drum and then at the end it doesn't do anything okay let me just kind of Google image search Plinko for a second I'm not sure I know exactly what Plinko is ah yes this is Plinko I do know what Plinko is uh but do I have to be kind of exact about this uh we're going to be let's see what's a nice Plinko look at this I can get Plinko all these Plinko things I can buy this looks like a good image uh okay I'm not going to worry about this I'm going to make my own Plinko ready here we go um yeah itd be interesting for somebody to edit together some sort of version of the uh or split screen the two camera views I'm happy for you know anybody who wants to mess around with that after these get archived I'm happy for that to happen Okay All Aboard it's Friday evening here on the coding train and I am here ready to create a coding Challenge and today's coding challenge is going to be ah never mind never mind all this nonsense Plinko so I'm going to attempt to make Plinko um using a physics engine known as matter.js what is Plinko you may ask good question I don't really I'm not entirely sure but I think Plinko is a thing where you have a bunch of balls that uh that fall from the top of a a twodimensional it's a physical thing you drop the balls at the top there's all these little things that they bounce into and they end up somewhere on the bottom that was a terrible explanation I should redo this whole video I'm going to make it and then you guys can if you don't know what Plinko is pause and go try to look it up and then come back okay I have a sort of vague idea in my head okay so uh yes and I'm being reminded by Ala in the chat to stay hydrated now that I've lost half of the people who maybe were going to watch this video the rest of you let's go okay so the first thing that I want to do here is um boy let's h I'm trying to think about this here there's a lot of pieces to this boy this is going to be this is going to be hard um let's think about this over on the Whiteboard for a second and apologies to Mata who will now have to edit this part and I might as well come over here and just erase this for a second uh so now I'm going to artificially pretend that I'm doing this again okay so how does Plinko work I can use the Whiteboard to explain it Plinko is a thing where there is a grid of stationary I would call them like knobs in a way and I think each row would be offset from whoops offset from the one below it so it would be something like this um all the way to the bottom and then the idea is that you would drop things from the top and it would fall right down and bounce here and you know ideally the ideas would be a 50% chance of it going this way and a 50% chance of going that way then it would hit here and there would be a 50% chance of going this way versus a 50% going and interestingly enough if we do this correctly which I'm sure we won't there's no CH we it's me there no chance I'm going to do it correctly we would see a nice normal Gan distribution of where they land like they would mostly land in the center with a few outliers boy isn't there some like TV show now called the wall I should just put like I could probably could create some sort of like clickbait title for this video but I'm not going to do that so then the idea so then they'll they'll fill up in the we could use this to like you know you win certain amount of money or whatever so this is the simulation so what I need is I need some mechanism for catching everything in different slots so these would be kind of stationary in the physics engine I could probably make these stationary rectangles if that's a thing then these would be and static is the word I'm looking for static uh Circle objects that are around and then I'm going to have Dynamic Circle objects falling from the top so I need really three kinds of things I'm going to call these particles because uh that's a good name for them I'm going to call these um pinkos because we're making Plinko and then this is going to be a bucket we'll call these buckets to catch the thing so I need to make three kinds of objects and so I'm kind of planning this out I guess I know I'm going to need arrays for all these things um so let's sort of see how this goes let's try making just the particles first okay so um what I'm going to do is oh cup is in front again sorry everybody I have a you don't want to know what's going on here with my multiple camera system craziness um okay um so what I'm going to do is I'm going to add a Javascript file and I'm going to call it particle. JS and I'm going to say function particle uh and I'm going to when I create a particle the thing falling from the top I want to create it at an XY location now here's the thing I'm using a physics engine called matter.js and I already have an index .html a reference to the matter.js library now I also have a reference to the p5js library that's the library I'm using for drawing and that's the library that I use in just about in many of my videos almost all of them but matter.js is new and if you want to learn more about matter.js I will link to a set of tutorial videos about matter separately I'm just going to kind of rapidly go through adding stuff for matter without maybe explaining everything but I do have separate tutorial videos okay now I do need to go to the matter.js website and I want to Google matter get started maybe Wiki um because I know that this is going to have some of the code that I want on it like this for example so one thing is uh matter is a library where all of the objects and functions that you might call of call from are namespaced uh they all start with matter do something and I'm going to definitely need an engine and a ren I don't need a render actually because I'm using P5 an engine a world bodies so this is a way of just sort of aliasing them so I don't have to say matter dot all the time and and so what I need is uh I want to have an engine I want to have a world I want to have a bunch of particles that's what I'm starting with engine world and a bunch of particles okay so uh engine equals matter dot no no engine. create I don't know World equals engine. world what's the chance that that's right so I need to create an engine and then I want to refence refence to the world that that engine creates sort of seems unlikely that that's correct oh it is correct engine equals engine. create and the world is you can see later engine. World okay great now what I want to do is I want to start creating um some bodies so the way I'm going to do that is I'm going to say VAR P equals a new particle and I just want to put it uh at at the top in the middle 300 comma uh 50 so I want to make a single new particle now I'm calling the new particle Constructor function so over here now what I need to do is I actually need to make a something called a body and body comes from B do so bodies is a thing that matter dos will make matter is the physics engine it's going to handle moving everything and doing all that so my particle object is just a wrapper for a matter.js circle thing so I want to make a matter.js circle thing at X and Y and it needs to have a radius uh uh this do r so oh but not this.r all right so I think I think that's right so I should look in the documentation I don't have matter.js uh memorized so I'm going to have to pull up the documentation here go under documentation uh go under bodies and now I'm looking for Circle XY radius now there's options and all sorts of other things which I might get into but this looks like I'm doing well so far here x y r okay now the other thing I need to do is I need to say world. add world um this. body what's this doing I have to not only do I have to make a body that's a matter body that can exist and have physics I need to tell the world that I actually want that body to be in the world it seems a little bit redundant but you know you might want to make objects that you don't actually they don't participate in the physics yet so those two things are separated and then I want to write a function where I can display it um and I should I should use H let's use the Prototype thing I have some videos that explain prototypes so let's throw caution to the wind prototype. show equals function so if you're wondering about this prototype P way of attaching methods to objects um I'll link to a video about prototype but this is a way of saying particles all particles are going to have a show function and in the show function I'm going to say what am I going to say I'm going to say Phil uh 255 uh stroke 255 ellipse and where is the body now here's the thing normally when I make an object I give it an X and a y or a position Vector but not here right now I am relying on matter.js to do all the physics for me so it's up to me to say Hey you know that body that's a matter.js body could you please tell me what its position is currently and then I can say and you know what I'm going to do I know that eventually I'm going to want rotation so I'm going to say translate this uh pause. X pause. Y instead of setting the ellipse to that location and then I'm going to draw the ellipse at 0 and I want to give it a a diameter which is its own radius time 2 now this do R doesn't actually exist so I don't think that the um oops and I have got an error there um uh I my I seem to remember looking at the matter.js documentation the circle body doesn't actually keep track of its radius in a property so I'm just going to make an extra property myself to keep track of it and that way I can draw it that way so now I've made a body I've added it to the world and I showed it I have a my own particle object that is a wrapper for a matter.js body essentially um so now whoops if I go to sketch. JS and I just say uh particles. push p and then I say p.show let's see if it shows up I hope so I hope so I hope so I hope so I would do my drum roll thing now but that doesn't never seem to work ah okay particle is not defined uh of course I always forget this this is almost as much as I forget the fail fail static oh it's super loud oh my God okay hold on hold on sorry you know what I'm sorry for everybody's ears uh Mato let me do that again and let's not have the music cue when we edit this together I always forget uh to add um the reference to uh the new JavaScript file yeah and the sound was laggy the new JavaScript file um to uh the index HTML so uh I need to add that here what did I call it particle. JS so I'm G to add that here uh okay now I'm going hit refresh okay what did I miss cannot read property body of undefined at object I must have done something wrong okay object.create bodies. Circle so where did I miss miss mess this up so let's comment out oh look at this this is for first of all nonsense that should be particles index zero. show because that's a local variable that I use just to add to the array and uh and you know what this is going to be I have a feeling this is going to be a twopart uh a multipart coding challenge I'm just saying that right now so I'll think about that as I go um because I can see that this is getting more complicated uh what am I missing cannot read property undefined uh and it create it must be oh bodies no this body equal bodies. Circle wait wait wait I'm still getting the error message even with oh no I haven't commented out let me comment this out to make sure that it's happening when I create the particle ah okay well okay that's fine we comment this out okay no error this is a good way of debugging comments everything out no errors let me just try to make the object oh I forgot to add the R I added an r and so it needs to have a radius otherwise what's it going to do well let's see if that fixes it I I'm guessing that fixed it and now we're going to see the particle there we go so there's the particle that single particle now it has no physics why does it have no physics well here's the thing a physics engine requires me to say hey go to the next Moment In Time move ahead in time and time can mean a lot of different things but it can mean real world time it can mean frame of animation and in this case I want to tie each frame each time through the draw Loop to a new moment in time and the easiest way to do that there's there's a lot of options that way that you can configure this is I'm just going to say engine. update I think that's all I say engine. update or maybe I have to say engine. update well let's try engine. update does that do it no engine. update is not a function engine. update engine it might be that the function update is namespaced in engine and then you pass in the thing you want to update that's it okay so you can see there's my Plinko particle falling down so we're in good shape we've got the Plinko particle now maybe what I want to do also is just to kind of um is to do something like let's have uh if frame count modulus 60 equals z so modulus is the remainder of division so this will equal zero when frame count is zero 60 120 180 240 300 Etc so I'm going to say uh add a new particle every 60 frames which is approximately two seconds let's do this uh show of undefined oh right and then silly me I should someday use a for each Loop but right now I'm just going to Loop through all the particles and show them and here we go so now we should see two seconds and about two seconds later oh boy something must be wrong here I'm not seeing any new where are those where are those blinko particles uh if frame count modulus 60 equals zero add a new one that looks good to me what have I done wrong uh let's console log frame count just to make sure that's a thing yeah looks like it's it started with one by the way so I'm not sure why uh what did I miss um okay the oh no this seem right put a new one I'm looking through all of them okay why okay hold on every let's console log every 60 every 60 ah so that's happening why do I not see a second one uh H that's strange let's look at first of all let's make this a little more often just so we don't have to wasit so much time and let me uh let me let me just see if that array is growing yeah the array is growing did I mess up in the particle object world. add this. body it's getting a new body each time what have I missed P Global uh should be New bodies. Circle did I do that wrong oh yes look at this thank you to somebody in the chat whose name scrolled by I think I called this incorrectly let's look at the documentation uh this is hopefully I would have um let's look at H I don't know if that's actually the case no look at this when I make a rectangular documentation I don't have to say new the function is designed to so what am I missing here H H oh oh I know what the problem is you guys see it now look it's right here it's right here right there translate pause. X pause. Y so I I knew I was going to I meant to add this earlier when I was doing it I thought whatever so translations are cumulative so when I translate to the position of one particle the next particle I draw will be relative to that one and so these are all getting translated way off the screen I need to not have them be relative to each other rather I need to say push and I need to say pop and now uh so what push and pop does is it's like save translate restore so it undoes the translation and now if I go back to my code there we go look at all my Plinko things every 10 frames my little Plinko particles falling down so we can go back to sketch and I can take out this console log nonsense and I can put it back to 60 and we can kind of oh and there's still another console log happening where's that other console log oh particles. length uh and so we can see here and you know what I'm It's upsetting me that there's not one at the beginning so I'm also going to what I'm going to do is I'm going to write a function new particle that just does that those two lines of code and oops and I'm going to say new particle here and I'm also going to have a new particle instantaneously in setup at the very beginning so now we get a particle and 2 seconds later we get particle and 2 seconds later we get particle I'm a little bit behind Okay um now the nice thing is it's the physics is already working as you might have noticed when I made this like if I make this every five frames you can see they're kind of like hitting each other it's a little bit funny that's a little bit like of a weird but but let's we're going to get to more physics later okay now I'm going to do I think I'm going to do this as a twopart challenge so um so let me go a little bit further let me at least add the stationary Plinko so I want to now try to add these stationary plos and the truth of the matter is I could probably reuse this particle object and just make particle objects here and give them like an argument that setss them to static but I'm going to make some a seriously redundant code just for like sort of ease right now and I could think I could use inheritance in a nice way to have them relate but I just want to make a separate object that just keeps track of these stationary Plinko because I I just want to treat them differently so um that's how I feel today okay you you can you can you can uh refactor my code later to make it uh better okay so let's come back here and let's go to particle DS and I'm going to do save as this is really I'm I'm a little bit uncomfortable with what I'm doing here I'm going to say Plinko JS and I'm going to say function Plinko and uh Plinko I really should use inheritance here come back and use inheritance another time Plinko prototype. show and something I'm going to do here is I'm going to add uh another variable called options so when you create a physics object in matter.js in addition to giving it that Circle body in x a y and a radius I can give it some options and the option I want right now is is static oh and I'm editing no I'm editing the right file is static true so and then I want to pass this fourth argument as options there might be a way that I could just make all these options actually could I make the X Y I don't know if that's true but anyway that fourth argument is options and there's other options I'm going to be I'll add later like friction and other physics settings but let's leave that out for now is static makes it something that doesn't move and doesn't doesn't experience uh doesn't experience um geometry okay um now that's right I forgot that the phone is still going I should I turn that off okay but okay so um uh that's not relevant to this particular video maybe we can edit that little thing out okay so now in and here's the thing I could Pro um matter.js also has uh these concept as a composite so I could tell it to make a stack of things with rows and columns so I could probably use that let's look at that for a second no I just not the kind of I I think that's great but I I feel like I just need to like set them in my own location right now without using the composite thing so I'm going to say VAR Plinko and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say for VAR x equals um let's use I andj actually I equals z i is less than let's make the Plinko thing 10 by 10 maybe or 10x 5 I I know 5 by I don't know what should be I I should have some variables for maybe columns let's do that and rows and uh so we're gonna have this many columns and then I need a spacing so I'm going to make a a sort of a double Loop here uh nested Loop to go through all the rows and probably rows should be on the outside actually well whatever I'm not so sure just yet um because I I is the X so actually I think think the way I'm going to think about this is to put I on the inner part of the loop so I'm doing a nested Loop right because I want to say set all of these then go down here and set all of these so for every row do all the columns next row do all the columns or for every y do all the X's okay so now what I want to do is I want to say VAR P equals new plink go at I * spacing comma J * spacing now I haven't figured out what spacing should be but I just want to know wants to be at every column and row location with however far apart they're supposed to be and let's just say right now spacing equals the width of the window divided by the number of columns so because I need five across and that's about the spacing I'm sure I'm going to have to massage this a little bit and then I'm going to say here Plinko pushp so now I'm adding the Plinko I like the I love the word Plinko it's such a great word Plinko Plinko Plinko let's make a song about Plinko uh um and now I want another loop here to go through all of the Plinko and show them and just to be 100% certain that they're different uh I would like to uh give them like a different color or something so let's make them uh like a green color color not being my strength here but let's just do that so what's going on now what's plink plink is not defined so a lot of things I probably first of all I don't know where that happened where did I say plink plink is not as good of a word as Plinko I much prefer the word Plinko oh plink Plinko and now I'm going to go to index. HTML and I now I need to remember this I remembered at this time I need to add a reference to Plinko and now I'm going to refresh it and what am I missing cannot read I've got some sort of like thing that I forgot already again I probably forgot the r again right I probably forgot to pass into radius um I certainly did so let's give each one of these things that's separated by spacing a radius of four pixels and now I don't see anything I see these things falling uh I wonder if I have an i and J issue I'm seeing they're called pegs I'm being told in the chat by C many that they're not called Plinko they're called pegs that would be a good name for them okay fine the whole thing is Plinko uh I times spacing J time spacing I put j i J's Less in rows columns rows this looks reasonable um let's just look here do I act let's look at the array let's make sure it's F full of stuff it only has one thing in it that's a little bit weird oh and look at it it's all the way up there which makes no sense whatsoever so plus equals spacing in the for Loop uh uh I oh columns no no no no no no yeah yeah this is wrong the whole point of doing this is I want to be able to think of the rows and columns as individual numbers I and j 0 1 two 3 four and when I'm drawing to the screen I want to add the spacing aspect so now we can see there they are now it's not in any place that's logical so one thing that I need is for the center column right I need I need an odd number of columns well I don't need an odd number but I need a column to line up with where the thing is falling so first of all uh if the I want the let me I can get rid of this now I want the the particles to actually just stop start at the actual top camera moment this can get this is a little nice little edit moment here as I have a sip my half of my head got chopped off there um so um I forgot what I was doing um yeah I should definitely make the canvas longer okay I'm forgot what I was doing where was I where was I where was I uh um I'm thinking I'm thinking if I press the Bell it'll make my brain have light up and have the idea was the last thing I said spacing yeah you guys are G me good suggestions of what to do next what's spacing okay I don't know um I'll just go back to something okay so I need to have one of these columns in the center I need to have one of these columns in the center so let me think about how to do that and also I want the particles to start at the top yes so particles starting at the top top and I want that I need to make the whole thing much taller so let's go down to 800 pixels great so now we can see it's going down to 800 pixels I want to shift everything down right everything should start at um and I'm actually going to do this varx equal I + one times spacing because no no no no no X is fine at I * spacing and uh y should be spacing plus I * spacing just to kind of offset everything by and then I'm going to just put X and Y here this will make it a little easier to work out whoa what did I do wrong there uh spacing plus a j thank you very much okay so that's a little bit better but I I also want to shift everything over by half of spacing I think so I want to shift everything over by spacing divided by two there we go ah look at that so okay so first of all couple things it's pretty great actually look at it just like get stuck and kind of roll over so one thing is um I this this going to be this definitely going to be a puzzle here of having uh working out the spacing but one thing is let's give these things some bounce so the way that we think give things bounce in matter.js is by working with the friction and restitution so restitution is a term for elasticity a high restitution will make it very bouncy and so what I want to do and this is why I should be using is I want to add this options thing both to particle and Plinko which really should be a Peg and this these are not static I'm going to just work only in the particle for a second restitution and I want that to be one which is as bouncy as possible so let's just add that options that didn't really seem to change anything right so let's Also let's get rid of any friction um so now the particles should have a high restitution and no friction that's a little bit better right you can see it's kind of bouncing but I probably need to work on the pegs I really know the Plinko the pegs uh so let's actually take these same variables I'm not sure what it would do here to have sort of different amounts but let's um let's add a high restitution and a low friction also to the the pegs wow I really would expect this to be um more bouncy with those numbers but maybe it just hasn't gathered oh I spelled restitution wrong that's one of the things about JavaScript it's not going to tell you this is a really unfortunate thing if I was working in another environment it would be like I don't know what that is restitution restitution what's the chance I got that right now restitution boing there we go boing bo bo boing Bo well it's going to be fun to add sound effects to this so you know we can see now we've got something we've got these things kind of kind of bouncing along here now they're all taking exactly the same path how are we going to get it to have like a 50% chance of going why is it going to the left so interesting this is super okay well first of all what I want to do is I want to shift uh every other row and and um so let's let's uh let's maybe reduce the restitution a little bit yeah that's a little bit better um and then let me alternate where uh the rows are so what I want to do is uh in sketch. JS I want to say every other row right which is if J is the row right if J modulus 2 equals z then uh so so then let's or equals one there got to be a nicer way to do this so I'm setting X then what I want to do is xus I'll just sort of like take that let's do it this way xal I plus spacing and then if it's an even row then I'm going to add in offset it by spacing divided by two let's see if that works there we go so this looks a bit more now here's the thing I probably need to really calibrate this in some way that they kind of you know bounce but let's just let's not worry about that too much and let's actually um just make this let's just give ourselves a lot more columns and rows and see what happens um and why is the top one now oh because it's not even uh I want to have uh 11 columns yeah there we go so um and I think I want so there's going to be some there's probably like a specific layout that I that's going to work pretty optimally well but this is a good start so um this completes part one of this coding Challenge and what I'm going to do in part two is I'm going to do a couple things I don't know what I what am I going to do in part two I'm going to add buckets to the bottom to catch them and maybe think about the layout and spacing a little bit more okay so that's what I'm going to do in part two does it really make sense how long have I been doing this for this live stream has been going on for 45 minutes um yeah it should be way more bouncy right um I think uh one thing so I'm oops how's my how's my phone live stream going I'm at least taking a break I I don't know if MAA is watching I don't think MAA is watching this live chat I'm so it make the pegs bigger yeah that's probably a good thing they're all going initially to the left so that's one thing can you modify the parameters to look like a normal gravity one thing is the time step here so um I'm seeing a lot of great suggestions add Randomness they to drop in from random points oh yeah dropping in from random points would be good um so um there's lots of things I can add oh but mostly what I want to do stronger gravity so I'm taking a little break here to think about this um and then I'll put the stuff in the video tutorial how could what so I'm trying to think about the stronger gravity let's look on the matter.js I think the the matter.js website is there world I mean right now it's it's starting to get really really slow over time uh is there a way to set gravity oh M as Gravity the gravity the gravity scale gravity object so the world when I say world. create oh I can give boundaries for Collision that's kind of useful uh the world sorry where was that world. create um options and one of those options can be gravity I need to destroy the offscreen particle so I need to add that as well yeah yeah definitely going to do that so those are let me make a list of things I need to do in part two uh oops this camera's off uh increase or gravity delete particles add bounds and then um I'm standing for add bounds uh add buckets and I don't know maybe I could like count a listener I might be interesting to try like a listener to count uh to count which buckets the things land in although they're not the buckets are going to fill up so they're not going to hit the bottom I'm I'm not going to worry about that that'll be somebody else's problem as a followup uh reusing them instead of deleting them is a good suggestion from Big Apple in the chat I could definitely do that um engine. world. gravity. uh thank you okay um so let me uh let me see here how's my phone B there's still 148 people somehow watching and 75 minutes into this live stream on the phone I thing about this phone live stream is now nobody's going to want to watch my studio walk through when they see it's like a threeh hour video but whatever can edit I can edit something out maybe maybe something could get edited out of that that'll be more useful anyway okay um I know so C Manny is saying I can say engine. world. gravity doy even rows need another column oh yeah that's interesting let me let me look here yeah so they're missing it's missing like a last piece there so that I can add um and then also let's see what we can do about the gravity just um so what you're saying is I can say world old. gravity. y equals you know 100 or something okay that worked yeah that's good so that's good it's interesting how it's able to fit like all the way through um so that's what is it what is the default at one maybe yeah so maybe if I just double it um oh but Collision listening I can use for playing sound so um Collision listening so but what I wanted to do when I when I come back I think I would prefer to oh engine. create so I'll just do it I'll do it that way that's fine okay okay uh hello jello in the UK thanks for watching okay so what time is it 7 o'clock yeah so I'm going to maybe make the pegs a bigger size that's a good suggestion as well okay so I'm going to now move into part two of this uh coding challenge okay so I made my list uh does and so um sound plus listening that might actually be a part three so I think I can do these things increase gravity delete part particles add boundaries and add the buckets I think I can do that in part two and then maybe part three we'll be adding sound so that's sort of like its own thing okay uh here I am okay welcome to part two of Plinko coding challenge I actually just during the little break I just took between part one and part two I made a quick list with help from the chat here's the things that I'm going to do I'm going to increase the gravity of the world so that things don't look so sluggish as they're falling I got to make sure I delete any particles that leave the window although at some point I'm going to put boundaries so actually I might hold off on that because I was going to add boundaries around the whole world so that they can't leave the window because the idea is to fill up the buckets at the bottom but uh um then I uh and then I want to add buckets at the bottom to fill those things up and then I actually might make this a part three let's see if we can add a little bit of sound with they as they hit the things as little like ding ding sounds or whatever maybe I can record the Bell really quickly and use that sound okay uh so um here we are so first thing I could do is so gravity is part of the world um and so if I look at if I just look in the console if I look at world we can see here that there are a lot of properties there's bounds which don't There's No Boundaries to the worlds right now that's something I'm going to set um there's no constraints but there's gravity here which is an object and you can see the scale is 0.001 X is zero Y is two why is Y 2 oh because I already changed it as I was practicing um why is one ah it's fine it's fine let me redo that part and I I I I'm using my one redo ticket even though I do that over and over again um okay so hold on where was I okay um so let me look over here and see what I can do so gravity is part of something so there conceptually there's a world and there's particles and there's Plinko gravity is not part of a Plinko or Peg or a particle it's part of the world so I can actually look here in the console and I can just type world to look and see what the properties of the world are there's bounds which is something I want to look at which has a maximum and a minimum X and Y whoops which is ah I clicked the wrong thing come on click again you can see those are Infinity because I haven't said any bounds and then there's gravity which has a scale I don't 100% know what that is I should look it up in the documentation but I have an X and A Y so one thing I consider the Y is one right now I can actually just say world. gravity doy equals 2 so let me double the Y so it points down a little bit more and you can see can you see that that's moving let's just make it more extreme just so you can really see let's make this 10 and you can see that gravity is so much stronger right now so that's kind of useful in terms of getting things to fall a bit more pause for a second ah sorry live stream I needed a Kleenex and the the uh the the phone um that's if let me see what the battery is here should I those of you watching this right now hold on everybody those of you watching I'm at 20% battery do you does does anybody want me to really like keep this going is it okay should I turn it off or should I keep it going nobody's nobody's answering me I'm talking to you leave it on okay so I need to get a plug I have a plug for it and what I will do is I I will plug it in to this uh USB port here on this actually let me plug it into this laptop so I'm so it doesn't like appear by accident on my screen as a device uh and then let me bring this over here and plug it in is it plugged in oh my seriously that didn't work USB ports on this laptop don't work can I turn this over rotated the device no don't lock did that work no ah live stream okay hold on a second everybody sorry for this uh digression for the regular live stream I am changing to this camera for a second as I'm going to plug this into my laptop and I don't just want my yeah I know I was upside down uh uh let's see I can't tell if it's charging or not because it doesn't give me a view doesn't let me change it's locked it doesn't tell me if it's charging YouTube get with the program man how come I can't see if I if I go out of this app is it going to stop live streaming hold on a sec all right I'm just gonna have to hope that it's charging I assume that it's charging right now and now going to use the yellow mug and this keyboard to keep it propped up okay uh so if it dies it dies okay there you go okay so oh it's definitely plugged in because okay okay I'm back okay where did I stop I changed the gravity to two okay so I'm changing the gravity back to two and let's just leave it at that for now now let's try adding some boundaries to the world so what were those again a world world. bounds. max. X so I think that would be world. bounds. max. X and i.x equals uh with if I really want to m.x is zero let's just try this will this do what I think and then uh the minimum X oh wait wait wait wait X and Y ah no no hold on Max dox and Y is is like confusing to think about I want the maximum X and Y and then I want the minimum X and Y and the maximum Y is height and the minimum X and Y are both zero okay that's right let's now run this again and see uh I can't tell if I'm actually so I don't think the boundaries does what I think it does um in that uh hold on let me let me make this just 600 by 600 just so I can see right if the boundaries and let's see hold on world I might have done something wrong world. bounds. max. Min right so wouldn't that cause it to have like a hard Edge I guess it doesn't I don't know matter.js to know well enough so I'm guess I'm going to go back and eliminate this whole uh I'm G to um I'm going to eliminate this whole boundary thing does anybody know yeah let's try different numbers just out of curiosity oh look at that so that definitely did something maybe bounds delete the object I don't know so I have no idea what it does you may need to change a parameter in order to allow bound collisions constraints switch the Max and Min uh interesting hold on I'm I'm no longer in this video tutorial this is um maybe bound stops thinking about bodies uh all right let's let's look at the documentation um bounds defines the world bounds for Collision detection so I think that means it just stops um it stops um doing the Collision detection afterwards okay so never mind that was a misdirection um I'm going to um delete this and I'm going to go back to where I just changed the gravity uh to two so I there might have been a weird edit right there but I I just tried something that didn't work out at all so I'm I'm not going to bother including it you can click a link to the live stream that has the full Archive of all my debugging but I'm going to get rid of this add bounds thing because the bounds doesn't actually do what I thought it does the bounds are something you can set just for where you're going to detect collisions but doesn't create hard edges that bounce off we need to actually create our own boundaries for that so actually add bounds should I don't need to go through that boy I was I I I should never stop because it totally kills my momentum and then I then I never um I I I have trouble getting it back okay I I know what I'm going to do now everything is fine with oh I don't know I know something somebody's post ala's posted something about GitHub and an issue but I'm gonna um I'm not going to um I'm not going to worry about that I'm looking here for what I changed 800 okay um the mobile stream could be angled up okay okay hey those of you watching this saying show your screen you're in the wrong live stream this is an extra live stream that's just going from my phone there's a full I'm in the wrong camera ah there's a full live stream over here just draw a box around the canvas is exactly what I'm going to do sorry everybody uh constraints is something else okay everything's everything's gone out of whack I'm gonna get back to momentum here okay everybody okay so Mata for you editing this later uh this is the moment where I just changed the gravity to two okay so changing the gravity to two I'm going to leave it for that right now the next thing on my list over here was add bounds and there is a thing in the world object in addition to gravity called bounds but I'm not going to use that that's more I think for where you're doing Collision detection instead what I'm going to do is just add some um objects myself so I'm going to yet again I'm going to just from particle. JS I'm going to do a save as and I'm going to call this a boundary boundary. JS I'm going to make an object that has a x a y and a width and a height it's going to be and this should be a a boundary and it has it's it is something that's uh static and instead of making a circle it's going to be a rectangle again I'm doing a lot of redundant code here but and then I'm going to keep track of the width and the height in separate variables and um I'm going to say boundary. prototype. show and this should be a rectangle with a width and a height so what I've done very quickly is show you how you can create a rectangular Body by using bodies. rectangle keeping graa a rdth and height instead of a radius otherwise everything else is the same ah I need to add rotation at some point don't let me forget because these things are rotating as they're moving around okay so for this what I'm going to do just really quickly is I'm also going to make an array call it bounds and I'm going to at the end of setup just put one at the bottom VAR b equals a new boundary and so the rectangle is actually thought of based on its Center matter. I'm going to say width divided by two it's going to be at uh height um and I'm actually going to like push it off so what I want is its location to be at height plus 50 because I want its uh width to be the entire width of the window and I want its height to be if it's plus 50 I want its height to be like 100 so it's actually not going to show up on the screen but and I'm oh boundary is not defined because of course I forgot to add it to my index. HTML so I have another Javascript file come on boundary. JS here we go and boundar is not defined and setup so what am I missing here um new boundary ah what did I probably boundary boundary boundary that looks right uh index.html I've got boundary. JS sketch b equals new boundary let's try that again syntax error line number three boundary. JS sorry about that uh is static true ah there should not be a semicolon there creating an object in JavaScript you separate the properties with commas with only one property I don't even need the commas okay apologies for that and here we go so now what we should see is I got to wait a little while but when the ball falls to the bottom there you got you can see that it's there's now a boundary down there so that's perfect that's what I want um and I I I guess I'm not going to make this 800 because it's um kind of going off a little too low down so let's just make this uh 600 by 700 just to push it up a little bit okay that's pretty good okay another thing that I could do here is if you notice every other I don't know if this is really necessary but does feel like there should be another particle right here another Peg right there so that is the odd row so in the odd row uh what if well what if I just did this would anybody really care yeah that's fine there's an extra one also for the even ones I could be more thoughtful about this but that's what I'm going to do right now Okay so we've got the stuff falling down and landing in the bottom okay I definitely need to do something I was wrong uh I do want to delete particles that fall off the edge because maybe they're not all going to end up in the bottom um so I should add something where I check if anything is way off screen to remove it to kind of keep things more efficient so let's add that next and what I need to do to do that is I need each particle is the only thing that's moving so I'm going to say particle. prototype uh do um offscreen equals a function and I'm just going to say um what makes it offscreen if x return X is less than zero that's let's let's say x is less than 00 not X okay so first of all x equals this. body. position dox so that's actually the object's location it's the body's positions X right physics the physics engine matter.js is controlling everything y equals and you know what I kind of wanted to make a nice if statement that I just return a Boolean not an if statement a nice Boolean expression that returns true or false let's just make this simpler if x is less than 50 or X is greater than I'm just going to use a buffer of 50 y + 50 uh then return true uh else and I'm doing this in a radically inefficient way but I don't actually ever need to check the top so I can actually just say return if any of these is true if any of these are true then it's off the screen so I can use an or return the result of all of these or Y is greater than height + 50 I'm I'm like hearing the YouTube comments already don't use a longwinded if statement where you could do it in one line of code but this is like kind of cryptic to watch to read but if an or statement if any of things in an or statement are true like false or false or false or false or false or true the whole thing is true right if I'm you know uh yeah okay so if one of these things are true the whole thing's going to return true so now what I need to do is in this Loop here where I'm dealing with all the particles if particles index i. is off screen then I want to say particles index uh particles. splice I comma 1 so I just did this in a matter.js tutorial earlier I'll link to it where I kind of went through the pitfall here because I'm moving taking things out of the array while I'm iter in through it so really a a quick fix that I can do here is just um that I did in that video is I can just subtract one from I because the problem is if I'm removing the I element the other elements slide into it and then I add one I end up skipping over it so this is going to cause me not to skip anything and this should remove anything that's off the screen and of course I have an error particles index I is off screen is not a function uh why is it not a function particle oh I just called it offscreen let's call it is off screen there we go so one thing I want to do just to be sure this is really working is let's not check let's not check the bottom um let's check uh let's check you know to see if they go over 100 pixels so we should see them removed now I did I forgot something really important in addition to removing it from my array I need to tell matter.js that it's not part of the physics anymore so what I'm gonna do F I'm having like a groundhog day Deja Vu thing uh where I'm removing it I also need to say partic uh I need to say uh um particles no no no no world world. remove World particles index ibody I think that's it so I want to tell the matter.js world so I want to remove something from the matter.js world the world function is namespaced in the world object so world. remove from this world which is my world this particular particle's body so take this out of the physics world then delete it from the array then go back one so let's see if that works uh so one thing one way to check if this works by the way is now what I'm going to do is I'm not going to um I'm not going to remove it from my array but I'm going to remove it from the physics world so let's just take that out this is a good way of debugging to see if it works so let's see if after 100 the physics stopped so that that actually did work did I get I probably got like a weird why did it that's interesting how it stopped doing anything but I can see plainly that this is doing what I want it to do um I'm pretty sure this is right um anybody pretty anybody tell tell me if I've done something wrong but I think I've got this in the right order and I can go back to my particle object and change this to like height I don't actually need the height of at all CU I only care if it goes cuz the the bottom is the bottom has a hard boundary so I'm actually just going to take that out I don't need that at all so I actually don't need to check I'm only going to check if it's off screen on the why oh something froze oh I crashed this particular let's just see if this comes back and it works again okay um so this should be doing fine I want to check here's actually a way that I can check so nothing's been removed so far I can say um particles. length there's six right now um particles. length seven particles. length seven come on leave the world people checking if it's working boy these these there's too much friction at the bottom because what I'm going to do is I'm going to say world. bodies oh no this is never going to work because there's a gazillion thing okay edit this part out um it stopped completely because you commented out the splice but still did hold on I got to go back I I want how what's a good way to confirm this is really doing what I want it to do I think I just have to rely on it being correct um let's you may want to check the height if the pellets get off screen by the sides no they're going to fall um so the question is does is no I can figure this out right because um how many um sorry I'm off um the only things are the boundaries so plink .length okay hold on let me de whoops let me debug to see if this is really working and I I want to be thoughtful about this so because I I really want to make sure that I've done the code correctly and I think this will show you a good way to debug this is what I'm going to do is actually completely take out all the Plinko so now I have to have this oh look at that who that's oh no no I got to do this I okay now there's no Plinko okay so now that there's no Plinko and I'm also going to remove this boundary and then I I actually unfortunately now need to go back and add this y back in or Y is greater than height so the way that I'm going to know that this works is um uh put this back in the way that I'm going to know that this is actually working is by looking at the length of the array so particles. length is one it's never going to be more than one because by the time the next one comes one's been removed the question is world. bodies is what matter.js thinks is there is that also one it is so things are working right because if I took out my um if I took out this world. remove if I didn't remove it from the the matter.js world I could look at particles. length and I'm going to continuously see one but now there's going to be three in the world's body so I need to make sure it's being removed from both places so now that now that I feel confident that that's working I can put my boundary back in at the bottom and I can put the uh Plinko back in here okay here we go now looking at my list what do I have left I've increased the gravity I'm removing particles I added a boundary at the bottom I need to add buckets so what I want to do is just add some little separators here and I probably want to align them right with that first um with that first uh row that probably is the way I'm supposed to do it although I'm sure there's a specific layout okay let's add those so how many those need to um let's add those okay so what I need to do those are also going to be boundaries so I'm going to use that boundary array boundaries. push B and now I'm going to write a loop that's similar I only need to do it for one set of columns so let me say I equals um I equal z i is less than column I want to do all these columns uh and what I want to do is say the x is I * spacing right that's what it is for um let's just see let's see what goes on let me try X is X is I * spacing the Y is the bottom so let me think of a height here I'm going to those buckets are going to have a height they're going to be rectangles that are going to have a height of like I don't know let's just try like 30 pixels and a width of like 10 pixels so the Y is going to be if I want it to be a boundary that sits um on top of the floor the Y is height minus h / to CU I need a rectangle this is confusing but basically uh if this is the bottom this is my rectangle this is its height this is this is the canvas's height minus height divided two is this location here so once I do that then I can create a new boundary and I'm reusing a variable name which is probably a bad idea but I can create another new boundary which is at X comma y with comma height because I calculated all that already and I can also say boundaries. push B and the reason why I want to put it into an array is because I also want to say um I also want to display all them so for all the boundaries uh boundaries index I doow now what does the boundary show function have it shows a rectangle and let let me I have let me say fill zero stroke zero let me get a different color here and uncaught reference error boundaries is not defined at setup boundaries boundaries boundar did I not make a boundaries array oh I called it bounds so that's nice because it's a little bit shorter of course now I have to change it everywhere so balance. push bounds. push and then I need to Loop through that balance array okay there we go those are so tiny look at the tiny I really okay so those are going to be uh have to be um much taller I guess I wasn't really thinking uh and I don't know why let's they can be white I don't know why I was like I had to change their color so um in the uh uh where am I boundary um let me make the color white and uh here let me color white and then uh what am I doing now on sketch where I create them let's make the height 100 my goodness why are you being so stingy okay does this so uh and then I could use one extra one right I could use one extra one here not cut that off with my laptops I could use an extra one I could use an extra one um so I already said columns plus one columns plus two wait why am I not getting oh because it's it's there but it's right off the screen no uh it must be right uh columns plus whoops so I don't know why am I not seeing this one here should be like half on the screen I would think because this one is oh but uh so let me just offset it a little bit uh 10 plus yeah uh I just see um minus 10 just to offset it yeah yeah it's there so I just I have to finesse the spacing stuff a little bit um so I'm going to just leave it at that uh because there's one what I want is but it should be at the center right so X is I times spacing so X is zero um and the width is 10 so I should see five pixels on and five pixels off what if I change this to 20 what what am I doing wrong here oh I know what I'm doing wrong I have I'm not drawing it correctly no wonder so I don't know if that some of that thinking could be edited out I need to move this up again because it's too low for me um but uh I forgot a really really key thing if I go into the boundaries look at this I'm drawing the rectangles in the default way that P5 thinks of rectangles with z0 in the top left and that's why they're actually so short I'm just drawing them in the completely wrong place whereas matter.js thinks of rectangles with the registration point in the center so I need to have I'm drawing match what matter. as things which I need to say w mode Center so here we go there we go so now it's right and you can see I that's what I expected it to do it had one sort of half off at the edge so you can see here are my uh Plinko things uh let me just do this oops no let me do this so um you can see it a little bit better uh okay let me make it a little bit um wider uh sketch. JS just to give us some more uh stuff to work with 700 comma 800 let's try that there we go so now let's take a look at this oh I I did something weird oh the spacing mind why did I change this I I didn't mean to do that let's go back to what it was okay so here we go uh Plinko so this ends the second part what I'm going to do is um what I'm going to do right now is take a short break and I'm going to come back and add a few sounds to this and during that short break I might also oh one thing I really got to fix is look at it always goes to the left up there and the whole point of this iser to 50% of the time go to the left and 50% of the time go to the right so I need to I'm going to add a few features to improve this in the next video you can think about maybe how you would do that yourself and look at this they're really they're all Landing basically in the same spot too so I need to work on adding a little bit of Randomness to allow for um for uh things to change okay so I'll see you in the next third part part where I'm going to improve on this a little bit see there okay so now I'm going to take a little break and like scratch my nose yeah totally violates the so I need to change the drop point at the top to be slightly off to the left or right and then I want to um then I want to uh um add some sound so I need to do Collision listening so I can add some sound so first of all 730 I need to use my phone to text that I'm running a little bit late because I got to finish this um so I'm going to um um I want to go a quick time can I do a can I just make a quick a new audio recording this is like such a terrible idea okay everybody here we go live audio recording oh too loud too loud let's try that again that actually worked kind of well though uh let's do one more time new audio recording I'm just G to have it be further away it was so close to the microphone here we go that's pretty good people are getting confused with the double stream should I shut off the mobile stream um if you're watching this on the mobile stream you should switch to what what happens if you go to user shiftman live does that end up in the correct stream um uh okay um so let me save this as ding under desktop where's my desktop desktop matter.js Plinko um ding what is what kind of fil is it going to save it as and how big is it going to be uh it is oh it is what kind of weird CR oh no it's like an apple audio something nonsense Apple EG 4 audio is that going to work with p5js does anybody know what's its actual file name how come I it's not showing me the extensions I think it's must be MP4 right okay um okay thank you uh math ma Mata making the phone stream is unlisted okay that'll help sorry everybody bigger pegs too is a good um it defaults to the mobile oh okay let's see if we can get that resolved um sorry for those of you watching this stream um um I'm looking at you uh this is surprisingly I I really need to deal with uh kind of interesting um so hopefully that's going to get worked out I can always turn off the mobile stream if that doesn't fix it okay so let me just see while we're waiting let me just add let me just test this function preload oh m4a that's never going to work right uh wait I can okay let's see what's the chance this is really I don't want to waste too much time on this um yeah ala would be great to try for your help but I don't have an easy way I I should set up like a shared Google drive or something that people can help me with files um during the where am I desktop uh matter.js let me um I think what I can do is go to a silly quick time well I have audacity I just showed me and I can um trim it to where it starts so I can do that trim and so that's going to that's going to make it start immediately by the way is that really loud is that like killing people's ears when and I should also trim the end because I have a shoot uh it's not too loud okay great so let me save this as ding two I'm also going to trim the end just a little bit here and hit save ding three okay um and then what I want to do is let me try export Audio Only and ah it's not giving me options I guess I could do it in um AAP it let's try opening it on Audacity and let me do export to MP3 that should work ding. MP3 blinko yeah okay no it's not saved yet let's see if this works okay so I think I can delete I'm going to just save that original let me just put all this stuff somewhere well let me just I'm going to throw caution to the wind I'm GNA delete those other files they're in the trash if I need to get back okay so that should be the ding did is the um is the um is the Mobile versus live stream thing sort of worked out or it's that's still an issue um okay so this is really filling up here I need to do a different color let me think about this okay so um I'm going close this I'm going leave this running have my code up am I ready to go okay okay um okay wait no okay um okay here we are I'm in the last part three of the Plinko coding Challenge and you can see I actually left this running for a little bit you can see it's kind of like got a little bit of distribution that's skewed to the left there's a lot of stuff to add to this to make it better and I I'm I hope that uh um those of you watching these videos at the end you'll check the description for the link to the code you'll make their own your own version and you'll see when you look at the code at GitHub there's a readme file that if you make your own variation on it you can actually link to so I encourage you to do if you have questions about how to do that ask it in the comments or tweet me at shiftman but what I want to do is at least make a few improvements to this so number one is I really don't want them all to take the exact same path if you notice they're all taking the exact same path do hits that one hits that one hits that one so I need to introduce some variation here the other thing that I want to do is add a sound each time it hits one of these little pegs maybe I don't know if that's going to become incredibly annoying but I'm going to try that and then I also think that I should add maybe some color to these objects because right now it's very hard to sort of see what's going on with all these balls all these particles on top of each each other okay so uh let me hit refresh here this is what it looks like at the beginning so let's at least first add some rainbow colors for lack of a better idea um and I'm going to do kind of the worst design idea possible which is just say uh this. equals random equals a color that has a random and this is P5 uh function to create a color variable so I'm going to give each object a color which is a random RG and B value and then I'm going to say uh fill with that color and stroke 255 so let's do that and now what uh oh and this should be this this do this do this do for color and now we can see okay at least this is going to help me look at this by getting a bunch of random colors so I like that that's kind of nice and then I also I don't there's no point for the pegs to be green anymore so let's make those pegs uh just plain oldfashioned white so now here's our Plinko board we've got now now let's add some Randomness now there's a few different ways I could do this number one is I could maybe like offset its X location by a little bit um I could give it kind of a little initial velocity or initial Force I could add kind of like a random wind there's so many ways but um yes I should okay okay okay uh hold on PA pause uh um so I'm getting some complaints about the color which I totally agree and also look at this they're kind of I'm getting some like I think the friction and restitution I should probably work on but I'm not going to worry about that randomize the Hue okay let's go back I'm Al I'm taking your suggestion a little bit too seriously um and I'm going to back back up to where I was filling the color and I'm at some point I'm G to say um and I'm going to say okay Matthew this would be a puzzle to edit this back in but pretend I just typed this and I'm going to fill with that color okay uh ala is making a good suggestion in the chat let me do it with color mode HSB um it'll it'll be a little bit nicer um so I'm going to say color mode uh HSB B which changes the colors to having their a hue saturation and brightness and so all I want to do actually is oops I went to that page um this this is a good suggestion it's a little when you by the way um uh thank you this is uh body. velocity is read only body Doos previous ah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so that's a great Point ala um and I maybe I'll bring it up but I'm still going to just randomize our location I think because that's I think too complex for this sorry everybody do over let me just go all the way back where am I here uh particle wait hold on I've got too many things open and what I'm going to do is put it back to what it was and try doing the color again there we go this is what it was before okay okay so let's now um let's now add color to these uh particles so what I'm going to do in the particle uh object is I'm just going to add a new variable this doc color and actually um ala was made the suggestion several times now in the chat I'm going to change the color mode to HSB so instead of creating a color as a red green and blue value I'm going to create a color as a hue saturation and brightness which I think will make it more rainbowy since that's the kind of that's about my only way of thinking of colors so I'm going to say and actually I'm just going to give it a hue of this. hue equals random 360 I believe the default range is between 0 and 360 for Hue values in p5js so now I can say uh I can say fill uh that random Hue and we'll give it um a saturation of 255 and a brightness of 255 and let's um we'll take out the stroke we can also give it a little alpha or maybe it doesn't need Alpha and let's see what happens there we go oh look what I've done so this is giving me now um some colorful um particles but notice how everything else changed because everything else now is a huee saturation brightness so what I need to do is look at everything else that I color this is why I didn't want to do that but uh so I'm just going to change first of all I'm just going to make everything uh White the Plinko things and the boundaries can also be white and then the background can be um uh oh the background can be uh in boundary I've lost my oh no the background in sketch oh I've caused so many problems best of intentions the background can be uh black let's just do that there we go okay I don't know so color is not my strong suit here this is this is so ugly but it's going to have to do right now you are going to improve this and make it beautiful okay so um here we go but now the real important thing that I wanted to do is randomize how they're falling just a little bit so how can I do that um and uh I want to randomize how they're falling so there's a bunch of ways I could do this so uh there's you going to need to really read the documentation if you want to like give it kind of an initial velocity it really actually um there's some tricky ways to do it there's a set velocity function that you can use but I'm going to do something kind of simpler which is I just want to um I just want to give it kind of like a little bit of a random offset in its location so if I go to the particle object um where I where I set the particle location is here The Circle at X so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say X plus equals random1 I'm just going to give it like a little bit of an offset either to the left or the right let's see what that does fell to the right oh fell to the left so I think this is better now so we can see that they're now moving to the left or the right and you know again I'm not sure if there's some Nuance here to really like how we need to like do all the spacing so they bounce against things um more properly well let's let this run for a little while maybe the buckets should be bigger maybe the you know there's lots of things you could do to affect this but I'm going to let this run for a little while and what I'm going to do is add sound now it's quite possible that the sound I recorded my bell so when it hits oh that's going to not be good because it's going to ring the bell quite a bit so I probably need a another and you can see that they're like going off the left and the right but I'm removing them that's fine there's all of you are going to fix this and make it much better let's at least add the sound so now what I have in the um the directory here uh I did this dur when I took a little break if I go to the Plinko example I have an MP3 file ding called Ding which makes a little ding I have a feeling this is going to be somewhat annoying that it's going to make a ding sound but let's let's give it a try anyway and see what happens I think it would be much more exciting to have them be musical notes and maybe in in a certain key or something and it plays a little song I hope you create that so um you can use sound synthesis so I am just going to add a function preload which is a an easy way to load some media assets before the sketch starts without a call back although I certainly could use a call back and I'm going to make a variable called Ding I'm going to say ding equals load sound uh ding. MP3 now one thing I need to make sure sure is in index.html I don't see oh I do have a reference to p5.js so you need to also load the sound library and now what I'm going to do is uh go back to here and I just want to play the sound so what I want to do is I'm just going to add function uh Mouse pressed uh and I'm just say ding. playay so let's just see what this does oh I I so that's basically all I need is that really loud I hope that's okay um I I think I have the volume kind of turned down as it goes in um so now here's the thing I thought oh this will be an easy problem all I have to do is play the sound every time a particle hits a Plinko or a peg oh boy I'm going to have to look at the matter.js documentation because the problem is M oops this camera's off I'm going to have to look at the matter.js documentation because the problem is I'm not in control of the physics remember I just set up the world and said put these things in in these locations and let it go about to sing a copyrighted song which I stopped myself to do okay you really don't want me to um so um how do I know if I'm not in control of the physics engine when a particle hits a peg you know I could start to look at their distance against each other but that's then I'm like the whole point of this I'm not um so Mo so I'm not the one I don't want to do that because then I'm rewriting the physics engine the physics engine is doing this so most physics engines come with some type of event listener a way that I can get a call back function that's triggered Whenever two bodies Collide so I actually have no idea how to do this I haven't tried to do this yet with matter.js I've done it with box 2D and other physics engines so let me come over here and I guess we're just going to have to start looking in the matter.js documentation um so I'm going to look in uh documentation what am I looking for events that sounds right Events off events on a call back function to a given event so this might be right trigger no events on I have a feeling that's it subscribe Now what are my possible event names and what is the object I need some more information here matter.js documentation so let me think about this maybe there's an example uh is there an example matter.js example Collision event uh uh um let's look at this event system issue Collision start um oh do I I do I need Collision matters. events object so Collision so this looks like what I want my oh the object is the engine and collisions start and then I get an event which has pair so this will do for me whoops okay so this looks like exactly what I want to do I want to know when a when a collision has started and I want to know which things have collided so let's grab this code and put it in right here so and okay so matters. event so what I'm going to do I'm gonna I'm going to keep with our way of doing things and I'm going to say events equals matter. events just to keep that in my list of aliases and I'm going to say events on and I should I need to do this in setup so as after I've made the engine I can create I want to assign a collision start event and I'm going to take this out here and say Collision so I'm GNA I think it'll be a little easier to read here if I have my own function called a collision that receives an argument called event so the idea here and I apologize for this not being let me see if I can move this over a little bit so the idea here is that I'm going to say I want to assign a collision start event with this particular engine to this function called collision and then this function Collision will automatically receive an argument called event which is going to have information about what's collided so I'm just going to say console.log event I just want to see what those events look like so let's see if this works ah okay okay stop stop there's too many just's too many of you I just want to look at one so what I see is Collision start a pair the pair has an object it has a body a and a body B I have a feeling that these are the two things that have collided body a and body B so that's good I need that there's probably other there's information about the Collision all sorts of par there's all sorts of stuff in there but I think it's enough for me to look at the event pairs index zero why could there be multip I guess there could be multiple pairs in the same time um that that come into one event but I'm going to um so I want to look at the pairs are event Pairs and then the um Collision is the I'm going to do a loop I'll do a loop that's fine there could be multiple pairs so this is an array probably unnecessary it looks like there's just one pair each time but I'm going to say body a equals pairs index I body a and body b equals pairs index I body B now bodies can have labels names and IDs which could allow you to uh and I think I'm going to need to do this actually I'm going to need to assign them a label um so uh let's just look at this for a second so let's look at what I'm getting and let's just look at console.log body a and body B oh maybe I need to do look at those separately let's just look at one of them let's just look at body a so here we go refresh wait hold on why is that stupid X thing there okay refresh so okay now I'm getting I'm getting a body oh look it even says Circle body it has a label and it has an ID so this one has a label it has a different ID so this is good so the thing that I want to know though is all these things can collide with each other I want to know only when a particle has collided with a Plinko I mean I might want to know when particles collide with each other or particles collide with the the ground body or the wall these bucket things but just for right now I want to know when so so so uh the way that I'm going to do this is there's probably a mechanism in matter.js that might handle this for me but here's the thing this is my thing particle my particle has a body in it and what I want to do is I'm going to say this do body dot uh I'm gonna this is what box2d does actually box2d allows you to sign user data so I'm just going to kind of I I'm trying to think of what's the best way you know actually I'm just say particle oh no no no uh I'm going to say type uh yeah I'm just to say type equals I'm just I'm just going to use a string so I'm adding my own property to the matter.js body called type and I could use the lab maybe I should just use its label I'm going to overwrite its label how about that and I'll call it particle because I'm not using the label for anything else I don't think internally particle. JS is using the label so I need to give particle a label and then in the Plinko thing I'm going to say I'm going to give it a label as Plinko so now what I want to do is in that listener right where I have this Collision I want to console log body. a. label let's look at this particle particle particle particle poo particle particle so let me look at body. a label and body. B label so now we're seeing particle and a plink go particle and Plinko particle and Plinko PLO and a partic particle Plinko and a particle Plinko and a particle particle in a rectangle body right that's the bottom so I only want to play the sound if it's a particle and a Plinko so what I can say now is if body a is a particle and body B oh label so hold on uh let's just call label a equals body A's label and label B is body's B's label got this whole extra Collision listening thing in this video tutorial all of a sudden so now I to say if label a is a particle and label B is a Plinko uh what is what was it called ding. playay and then uh this is a very silly way that I'm going to write this because there's all sorts of nicer ways I can write this but also you know if the first one was a Plinko and the second one is a particle also play the sound so let's give this a try and see what happens oh my God okay okay stop stop please nobody ever run this program again you get the idea though so I encourage you to think be more thoughtful about this let's comment this out right now let's comment that out to think about how could you you know have a different label or a different type for each row how could you have a bunch of different sound did that really hurt everybody's ears I'm so sorry um I there needs to be a warning is that going to be like do I need to do that again so hopefully this isn't ruining everybody's ears but I'm actually done with this this is Plinko I'm going to let it run uh for a little while uh thank you for watching this was uh I could have recorded my uh train whistle thing um so this is the Plinko coding challenge in matter.js I hope that you make a better version of this maybe you think of create I me you uh you think about the visual design of it you think about the sound aspect of it you think about why you're using it in the first place um perhaps you can use it as a part of a game or something else or a poetry generator um I'm sure there are like lots of in accuracies in terms of like an actual perfect Plinko board that creates a nice normalized distribution you should see a nice bell curve so maybe you can make a variation of it where you really see that bell curve U perfectly um so share those with me um share share the versions you make and uh I'll see you in another coating challenge someday thanks for watching okay um so there we go everybody it is8 o'clock this always happens this has now been almost a twohour live stream of the Plinko coding challenge the thing that I want to do let me see if I can find this example really quickly the thing that I didn't get to today but I'll give you a future teaser I I don't know when I'm going to get to this too many things I wanted to do today I wish I could just stay here all night and keep coding it's lots of fun um I'm going to go to my uh class syllabus github.com shiftman I'm just going to show you where this example is for any of you who are interested I'm going to go to uh repositories this is the current course that I'm teaching at NYU physics and animation I made an extra example so I'm just going to instead of cloning the repository I'm just going to download it and um I'm going to open it up and this is the other coding challenge that I hope to do and this one I've actually done already so unlike that Plinko one I'm kind of doing it from scratch this is essentially um this is um this is exactly my coding Challenge number something somebody can tell me in the chat it's a coding challenge where I made a cloth simulation in 3D this is exactly that cloth simulation 10,000 steps on my Fitbit um cloth simulation but instead of a cloth hanging down a cloth attached to a pole on the side with wind blowing it's a flag simulation and what I'm going to do really quickly before I run it for you is I'm just going to go to where I'm rendering it and I'm going to comment out out this uh texture and I'm going to say uh stroke 255 and I'm going to run it and oh you can't see that so um well what this is if I zoom in is it's a lot of uh hold on stroke weight one um you can see this is that mesh and uh you can see this is like a little flag simulation and there's a little pearing noise wind um uh pushing it to the right and what I can do the thing that I want to show you is in addition to seeing that mesh I can turn off the stroke and I don't remember what it's using it's using a cat uh this cat uh so I can texture it with that cat and now I have my cat flag so this is the thing that I wanted to do I guess I will pick this up next week I doesn't seem very likely that I'll have time to do a bonus live stream before next Friday so far in the last two days I did a live stream yesterday for two hours this morning for two hours and now for about 2 hours it's like 6 hours in two days which is pretty good thank you patrons for like helping motivate me to do this kind of stuff um but I will come back and uh show you this so someone's asking ah the reason why I wanted to show this is um I'm having trouble getting image texturing to work in P5 and I haven't dug into it I have a feeling it's mostly not implemented yet um but I have seen some texture examples this is running and processing and using 3D so um but you could do this in 2D texturing Works in 2D but I haven't really investigated how well this works in P5 so if anybody wants to download this example and sort of help figure out like what's working in P5 what's not working maybe dig into that maybe we could work together as a community to uh help add this feature to P5 to get this texturing working um that's something oh a gif on a flag yes that's got to happen right okay so anyway I encourage you to check out this example um I am now going to play my Goodbye song I have this mobile live stream is still going uh hello uh mobile live stream uh you can now uh see all the pieces for an action you can see here there's my computer there's my preview screen this is the chat that's going on right now just the simulation would be great in P5 without the texturing so that should work what well beard scratching noise is so nice oh did I have like a weird beard scratching noise um you know the Goodbye song is called uh rainbow from I believe I got it from I I think I got it from free music archive so I often use a free music archive to um to look for a royaltyfree uh public domain Creative Commons licensed music um Etc uh textures on a sphere you absolutely can do uh one nice thing about inp um Urban at work is asking one thing about processing if you want to texture a sphere is you can actually processing will texture it for you automatically if you use the pshape object so I'm doing it manually by setting all the vertices of the shape and the pixels but um a sphere you don't you don't you could do that uh yourself and I have a sphere geometry tutorial that you could watch um please read some numbers is there are people really requesting me to read numbers pause how do I how do I pause the that pauses everything that stops IT all right here's some more numbers for you guys you asked for it my children are probably going to bed right now course they're not going to bed right now on a Friday probably bouncing off the walls but tonight I won't read this to them what have we been reading that's good we've been reading some really good stuff recently uh I'm 24,179 78,500 now I'm doing it okay Q&A not numbers yes I think that's a smart let me go back to my song started over so You' got an extra three minutes so I'm going to look for some questions in the chat um pi to 30,000 digits four numbers read pie look here's the thing people people for those of you who are watching this book a million random digits I will read the entire book if I get to a million subscribers I will read the entire book I don't know if that's realistic or how I'm going to make that happened so I probably should really got to regret having said that cuz at least should read one page and figure out how long that takes cuz there's a lot of pages but that's my plan it would it be would it be possible to change that falling particle to a rectangle and change the color upon Collision right yes absolutely so and I forgot I never did anything about rotation so I completely forgot the rotation uh time uh so okay um can I solve the Rubik's Cube I'm not good at things like the Rubik's Cube no I'll just be sweating um why does this book exist it's actually a really there's actually a really good reason why this book exists this book is from the' 40s I believe and we take it for granted that we we could just have random number generators at are fingertips to run certain kinds of simulations to simulate how stock prices might to think about random walks so to speak and um you know I I could read you this introduction here the volume you are holding documents a remarkable undertaking by a group of mathematicians engineers and data processors that ran in the 1940s and 50s to create a very large assembly of randomly distributed numbers or digits so um you know there's a lot of cryptography problems all sorts of of scientific mathematical problems that require random numbers and in the 40s and 50s you couldn't just say math. random so is Plinko still running let's yeah I should always have a cat flag behind me uh yep Plinko is still running so this is not tuned very well so many of them it's not very full because so many of them are going off the edge so um I need to work on that uh what was your first computer and programming language my first computer was an Apple 2 plus somewhere in elementary school and I did learn some basic when I had that um ah on your Vimeo page I saw a video called Neo Geo that that project was actually made with box 2D um so it's a sort of crazy it's a it's a collaboration with an artist named um Marina ziral um and so this is I'm looking for the one though I have like sort of high resolution yeah this one so um this is a video that is a kind of simulation of in a way like oil drilling not an accurate scientific unfortunately it's U I'm sure the YouTube compression is kind of a disaster here trying to reshow this but and in a little bit there'll be like a little bit of a gush of oil there we go um so this is all crazily done with box 2D it does not run in real time so all the physics were surrendered after the fact okay I got to get go and get home um I'm going to see if there's one last question anything in slack uh Plinko still running I checked so thank you everybody for watching thank you for your support um I hope to next week launch the coding train store uh if you're interested in sort of tshirts and mugs I think is probably all we have at this point but I'm using a service called printful.com so I if people have real interest in other products I could definitely release them uh it's uh and then I might also if I have time then it's a you know it does ship internationally but is expensive so I might look for some other International options so that's one thing uh I talked about Google summer of code I meant to talk about it in uh that's the Tshirt I'm wearing in the earlier this morning live stream so um I should try to find but what I need to remember to do someone remind me is to tweet out a link to this morning's live stream the time code where I talk about Google summer of code so if you're interested I mentioned a bit about that um and can I sell this yellow it's not like a thing now uh that's sort of interesting idea well I'm going to have a coding train mug as soon as I get mine it just hasn't been shipped to me yet um I based in New York City show us the mug well I have this mug I have a magic mug look at this it's an invisible mug uh because as we know it's important when you're riding a train and coating to stay hydrated okay thank you everybody I'm going to go over here and click this this stop button uh I I appreciate all the support um uh you can send me messages on Twitter at shiffman you should subscribe I guess and like things that YouTube likes that I guess um it helps people find the videos you can share it with other people uh one thing I love if if you have a friend who wants to learn programming please share with them my beginner playlists um if if you think they would be helpful to that person because I'm always curious to see if someone can really learn from nothing through my channel uh and of course there's the patreon as well which ala posted in the chat thank you okay so I'm clicking the button and signing off it's 8 o'clock I'm an hour later than I said I would be so thank you uh family for uh tolerating me being late on a Friday as I've always been these last few weeks and I will see you um I will see you all soon
