00:00 - This is a short tutorial to show
you how to take a p5.js sketch and
00:06 - host it with GitHub Pages.
00:07 - So, in order to follow this tutorial it assumes two things [sic]: you have a GitHub account and
00:12 - you have a p5.js sketch. And
the p5.js sketch–
00:15 - I'm going to show you– is this
one which is just a little
00:19 - little simple game demonstration where
there's an obstacle coming at you
00:22 - and you've got hit the space bar in
time to jump over the obstacle.
00:25 - Okay, so you can see that's the basic
sketch. Now, what is this sketch?
00:29 - It is a directory. In the directory it's
called RunningGame.
00:32 - I don't know why I called it that. And it has a set of
files associated with it. It has an HTML file,
00:36 - two JavaScript files and
library files.
00:39 - The point of GitHub pages, though, is that you can
host anything. You can make whatever you want.
00:43 - You can have as many CSS files,
HTML files, as many JavaScript files,
00:45 - you can have directories, images...
00:47 - All that sort of stuff.
00:48 - But I'm going to just take this core directory
00:51 - and host it on GitHub using GitHub Pages.
00:54 - So, the first thing that I need
to do in my GitHub account
00:57 - under RainbowCoder, is I just need to make a new 
repository.
01:02 - I'm going to make a new repository.
01:03 - I'm going to call it p5js_sketch.
01:06 - Obviously you should call it something
better but that will work fine.
01:11 - “Showing how to host p5.js sketch
01:14 - with GitHub Pages”
01:16 - I want it to be public.
01:18 - So people can see it.
01:20 - I'm going to
initialize it with a README so
01:22 - it has something in it to start and then
I'm just going to hit create repository.
01:26 - Then I'm going to add
a branch. This is key.
01:29 - I need to go under here. Branch master. I need
to add a branch called “gh-pages”.
01:35 - I'm going to create that branch.
01:37 - Then what I want to do just for
safety reasons I want to go to settings
01:41 - under branches and I want to switch
the default branch to gh-pages.
01:47 - I'm going through this a little bit
quickly because you can watch my previous video
01:49 - where I do this in a bit more detail,
01:51 - but I'm showing the steps again here but more quickly.
01:53 - So, all I need to do is hit “Update”.
01:55 - I wanna say “I understand,
update the default branch”.
01:58 - I want the default branch
always to be “gh-pages”
02:01 - Only the stuff that's in that branch is
viewable and hosted online as a web page.
02:06 - So then, the other thing
I'm going to do, just also for
02:09 - safety is I'm going to go back to my repository.
02:12 - I'm going to click here under branches and
02:14 - I'm just going to under “master” here
I'm going to click this trash icon
02:17 - all the way over on the right because I
just want to delete the master branch.
02:20 - So there's no more master branch this
particular part of all only has a
02:25 - gh-pages branch.
02:27 - So here we are. I have an empty
repository with nothing in it.
02:31 - A gh-pages branch and
now I need to commit those files,
02:35 - my sketch, to the branch. Now, there's a bunch
of different ways I could do it.
02:38 - I could clone this repository down.
02:40 - I could add the files and I could push it
back, but just for simplicity right now.
02:44 - I am going to just actually grab this
whole directory and drag it in here.
02:48 - So, um...
02:51 - GitHub pages, as a tool, it allows me
02:53 - to upload files directly to it and
so it's uploading everything and
02:58 - now I'm to say uploading my p5.js sketch.
03:03 - And I'm going to say commit
directly to the gh-pages
03:07 - branch and
hit commit. Processing my files.
03:10 - It takes a minute and there you go.
03:12 - Now one thing you'll notice here is
my files are in a directory called
03:15 - running game.
03:16 - I could have had them in the core
03:19 - directory. I mean the root directory
which probably would make some sense.
03:23 - Maybe I'll show you that in a second, but
you can see that the files are there.
03:27 - So now where do I find–
03:29 - Where do I see the stuff?
03:30 - So the URL is always
03:32 - .github.io/
03:39 - But if you don't want to remember that you can always just click on settings
03:42 - and then scroll down and you'll find
03:44 - you're under GitHub pages.
It'll say your site is published here.
03:48 - So I can click here.
03:49 - Now the irony here is it's going
to say it can't find anything.
03:53 - I'm getting a 404 error.
03:54 - That's because I actually have my index.html
file in a directory called “RunningGame”.
03:59 - So I've got to go add that directory right here
04:01 - RunningGame. And I'm
going to hit, oh I spelled it wrong.
04:04 - I'm going to hit RunningGame and
now you should see there it is.
04:08 - So there's my sketch online and
I have a permanent U.R.L. to that sketch.
04:11 - So there it is there it is
posted on GitHub Pages.
04:14 - Now if you want it to just appear
at the root directory,
04:18 - p5js_sketch
04:21 - what I would recommend doing,
is I'm going to go back to
04:24 - the repository. And actually I'm
I'm going to clone it.
04:27 - I'm going to fix this by cloning it.
04:29 - So I'm going to go.
04:33 - Sorry, everyone. I'm going to go
to this repository. Rainbow...
04:39 - Where am I? p5js_sketch.
04:42 - I'm going to grab the URL
for cloning it.
04:45 - And I'm going to go here. And I'm going
to cd back up to my desktop.
04:51 - I'm going to say git clone. Here.
I'm going to open that directory
04:57 - here and I'm going to look at RunningGame. So,
let's look at this.
04:59 - Whoops no no no no.
05:01 - p5js_sketch
05:03 - So in p5js_sketch, this is
what's in that particular repository
05:07 - I'm just going to take those files and I'm
going to put them in the root directory.
05:11 - And then delete that folder and
when I go back here.
05:16 - I can say cd into p5js_sketch and
I can say git status.
05:23 - So you can see it's telling me I moved
all these files around, I did all sorts of
05:26 - stuff. So I'm going to say “add . -A”
to add everything and delete everything.
05:32 - Then I'm going to say “git commit
"move files to root directory"”.
05:37 - And then I'm going to
“git push origin” and
05:39 - now the really key thing I want
to put those changes back up.
05:43 - I don't want to “git push origin master”.
Remember everything happens in gh-pages
05:48 - So I'm going to push everything up and
I'm already authenticated it might ask for
05:53 - username and password.
Now I should be able to go here and
05:56 - you can see all of the files
are now here just in the root directory
06:00 - There's no more RunningGame directory
06:02 - I can actually just now go to
06:05 - rainbowcoder.github.io/p5js_sketch
06:12 - You can see this is the URL
that I'm going to. I can hit enter.
06:15 - And there is my sketch.
06:17 - So you can easily just have the files in
your get have a positive rate as long as
06:21 - you're in the gh-pages branch.
06:23 - Then you know where to view
those pages hosted on the web.
06:27 - So I showed you all the possibilities. I
showed you uploaded files just through
06:30 - the GitHub interface.
06:31 - I showed you cloning and
making changes, but
06:33 - you can work
entirely through the GitHub interface,
06:36 - you can work entirely
locally through terminal.
06:38 - All those possibilities are open to you.
06:40 - The only thing you have to know, is
to make sure that all of your work
06:43 - is happening in gh-pages and
that you know the URL
06:47 - which is .github.io /.
06:52 - Incidentally you can also
have a custom URL
06:55 - that involves creating something called a CNAME file.
I'm going to make another tutorial,
06:59 - which will be like part nine, at some
point of the series on how to do that
07:02 - or part ten. Somewher in this Git and GitHub tutorial series will be that video as well.
07:06 - Okay, so hopefully you found this helpful and
07:09 - I will see you in some other part
of the universe somehow I hope.
