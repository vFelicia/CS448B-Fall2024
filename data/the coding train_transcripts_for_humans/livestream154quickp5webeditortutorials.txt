00:00 - [Music]
00:12 - hello this is a total surprise I was
00:16 - just up here doing some stuff and I was
00:19 - like a half an hour this is what I've
00:21 - always dreamed of I just have a little
00:23 - extra time I believe to get to something
00:25 - I'm just gonna like turn on the live
00:27 - streaming and be here the live stream
00:32 - them the cool the main live stream for
00:34 - this week not to mention the one I did
00:36 - yesterday the kids will be this coming
00:38 - Friday and so today I don't know how
00:40 - much it's gonna interest those of you
00:41 - who might actually be tuning in right
00:43 - now but I have a little gap in my intro
00:47 - videos let me see if I can find those
00:50 - let me turn off the sound here for a sec
00:53 - and go to here and go to here so I need
01:01 - to feed this so you know this year I
01:04 - remade I really need to read I want to
01:07 - remake what I remade Irene may i remade
01:13 - one two three four five six no one's
01:18 - telling me that I you did my microphone
01:20 - by accident today that's good
01:21 - all the way up to 1.6 were remade so
01:24 - these I made this fall and then I don't
01:27 - I don't have time to just continuously
01:29 - remake all these tutorials and they
01:30 - still apply but at some point at some
01:34 - point at some point here I create and
01:42 - let me just look through this video at
01:44 - some point I start I make a class maybe
01:49 - in a separate JavaScript file let's see
01:53 - I'm not signed in with my YouTube
01:55 - premium I need to sign over my YouTube
01:56 - premium so here already okay no I don't
02:01 - have a separate bubble j/s file so I
02:03 - haven't shown how to do that do I at
02:07 - some point anybody watch these recently
02:10 - no what about at the end of the video
02:14 - no look at that okay so this that's
02:20 - where this would go so right now I'm
02:23 - gonna make a quick video that will be
02:27 - six point four I mean it's gonna be just
02:31 - like a couple minutes long so I need to
02:35 - grab that code so I think now if I go to
02:40 - coding train website and go to code
02:49 - tutorials p5.js if I just six six point
02:57 - three here we go
03:00 - and I bring this into here that's great
03:06 - oh how lovely so let me move this over
03:13 - to here let me move this over to here
03:20 - all right so here we go I'm ready for
03:23 - this right now oh hello there it is me
03:33 - from the future entering into your
03:35 - playlist of intro to programming with
03:37 - p5.js in the previous video that you
03:40 - were watching about object-oriented
03:41 - programming I was using a text editor
03:44 - known as the atom text editor the p5 web
03:47 - editor didn't exist yet
03:49 - now if you started this whole playlist
03:51 - from the very beginning you'll notice
03:53 - that I started with the p5 web editor
03:54 - because I made the intro videos just
03:57 - like a month ago and then the other
03:58 - videos about object were last year and
04:00 - some of them were two years ago the
04:01 - narrative follows but the videos are all
04:03 - made at different times so I'm stepping
04:05 - in here for a moment just to show you a
04:07 - bit about working with objects and
04:10 - classes in the p5 web editor and one of
04:13 - the things that you'll want to do
04:14 - probably so this is the example from the
04:16 - previous video six point six point three
04:21 - so I'm making six point four right now
04:23 - and what I'm going to show you here is
04:26 - what if you know I'm gonna eventually
04:28 - make a much more complex sketch and it's
04:31 - gonna have you know bubbles and rainbows
04:34 - and unicorns and cupcakes and puppies
04:37 - and turtles right so I might have a
04:39 - class turtle class puppy and class
04:41 - unicorn you know this this one sketch JS
04:44 - file could get quite long and quite
04:46 - large so one of the things I could do is
04:49 - I can actually make a separate
04:51 - JavaScript file I can call it anything I
04:53 - want I'm gonna call it bubble Jas and I
04:55 - can put the bubble class in that file
04:58 - and allow me to sort of know that when I
05:00 - want to make changes of the bubble I go
05:02 - to that bubble file when I want to make
05:03 - changes to set up and draw I go to
05:04 - sketch touch yes when I want to make
05:06 - changes of turtle I go to turtle touch
05:07 - yes so that's what I want to show you
05:09 - it's not really necessary for this but
05:11 - it'll help you sort of scale up as you
05:13 - move forward now you can actually it
05:15 - doesn't just this isn't just only for
05:17 - putting classes in separate JavaScript
05:19 - files it's just a good time for me to
05:20 - show you that you get a multiple
05:21 - JavaScript files for one sketch in the
05:24 - web editor all right so if I this is
05:26 - where you want to look and I should also
05:28 - reference to you casee tarik Asia and
05:30 - the creator of the p5 web editor meeting
05:32 - nice 20 minute video about all of the
05:35 - features which are also referenced which
05:37 - goes through a lot of different pieces
05:38 - of the web editor I'm just kind of
05:40 - highlighting this one thing so I want to
05:41 - go over here and click this and you can
05:43 - see now I have the project folder and
05:45 - look all of the secrets are revealed all
05:48 - this time you've just been working with
05:51 - sketch jas that's your JavaScript code
05:53 - but the sketch digest code is only
05:55 - executed because it is referenced inside
05:58 - of this other files hidden file index on
06:00 - HTML this is actually just a plain old
06:03 - HTML file and we don't know about HTML
06:04 - maybe you do in my next playlist about
06:07 - like p5 the p5 Dom library we get into
06:10 - what that HTML file is a bit more but if
06:13 - I look at it we can see that I look at
06:15 - this there's this reference script
06:18 - there's a script its source is the file
06:21 - sketch j/s if I want to have a new
06:24 - JavaScript file I'm going to need to
06:26 - edit this file and I'm gonna need to
06:28 - make a reference to button dot J so I
06:30 - need to make a reference not button
06:31 - bubble whatever I was doing an example
06:34 - earlier that was button bubble once I've
06:36 - added that I can then go here and back
06:38 - to this
06:39 - a little error right here I can click
06:40 - this and I can say add file are you
06:43 - seeing that and then I can zoom back out
06:45 - and I'm going to name this bubble J s
06:47 - and you can see it appeared right there
06:50 - I'm going to click on it it's empty I'm
06:52 - gonna close this I'm gonna go to sketch
06:54 - guess I'm gonna grab my bubble class all
06:58 - of this code and I'm gonna go over here
07:02 - I'm gonna paste it in here I'm gonna hit
07:04 - save and now I'm gonna run it again it's
07:07 - the same exact thing nothing has changed
07:10 - the difference is my code for setup and
07:13 - draw is just right here and my code for
07:17 - the bubble class is now in a separate
07:18 - file so when it's time for me to think
07:20 - like you know what I want the bubble to
07:22 - move faster then I can just do this and
07:26 - change these numbers here I'm gonna put
07:28 - on auto refresh so that it updates
07:30 - automatically whenever I make these
07:31 - changes so you can see ah it's going
07:36 - faster then it's like slower but mostly
07:38 - to the right and then I want to change
07:40 - the you know the color a little bit too
07:43 - you know so I'm changing things but now
07:48 - in if I want to change stuff with the
07:50 - sketch I want to change where the bubble
07:52 - starts then I want to change this here
07:54 - so you can see I have now just resource
07:56 - organization to enter of the URL for it
08:04 - duplicate this sketch into your own
08:05 - account try to add another class and
08:07 - another JavaScript file or maybe you
08:10 - like just add like another JavaScript
08:11 - file and put the mousepressed function
08:13 - in that reorganize your code with
08:14 - multiple files don't forget to go in and
08:16 - reference them in index.html hold on you
08:20 - can set which modifier key in the
08:22 - settings I mentioned oh people are
08:25 - talking about something unrelated in the
08:27 - live chat going on okay good bye later
08:30 - ok there that was fast oo I know what I
08:36 - went to mention hold on let me match it
08:38 - was like good to know a perfect know
08:40 - edit video that I'm gonna have to adjust
08:42 - cut out that thing about me looking at
08:43 - the chat
08:47 - and I would say okay so okay so you now
08:52 - you've wrapped up this section on making
08:55 - classes and objects in JavaScript if you
08:58 - want a little exercise here what I might
08:59 - suggest is duplicate this sketch the URL
09:02 - to it will be in the video's description
09:03 - um see if you can add yet another
09:05 - JavaScript file maybe put like the
09:08 - mousepressed function in it or maybe add
09:10 - some other sort of object turtle that I
09:13 - keep referencing you know this little
09:15 - turtle that moves across the screen can
09:16 - you have a separate class I'll give that
09:18 - a try I will also note and I'm gonna do
09:20 - this in a separate video that's gonna
09:21 - come in the next like it's actually
09:23 - going to it will appear around objects
09:29 - and images or somewhere I got to look
09:31 - where it should go but I'm gonna do
09:33 - another video where I show you how to
09:35 - add media assets to the project which
09:39 - you can load so thanks for watching this
09:42 - and I will see you soon goodbye okay so
09:52 - that was good a little quick quick I
09:55 - wasn't kidding when I said quick videos
10:00 - so now let me see here I guess I mean in
10:08 - this playlist let's look at what happens
10:10 - in this one I really I have YouTube
10:14 - premium so that specifically said that
10:17 - ads don't show but okay so this is a no
10:22 - have I and I still still did it make a
10:27 - separate okay so I wonder what I'm
10:33 - saying here I have to listen to myself
10:34 - for a second
10:52 - and so there's a couple ideas
10:57 - one is I could leave this video as is
11:02 - and just make a separate video that
11:05 - comes before to show like in the next
11:07 - video I'm gonna use these kittens and
11:09 - flowers but I'm going to show you how to
11:11 - get them in the web better that's
11:12 - probably what I should do
11:13 - we could also I could also unlist I'm
11:15 - never gonna delete a video but unless
11:16 - this video and I have Matt you edit in
11:19 - like like right here like stop I'm going
11:22 - to show you how to get these things in
11:23 - the web editor and then have it go on
11:24 - probably the safer thing is to do a
11:26 - separate video so I think I'm gonna do a
11:29 - video here so let me go back and the
11:36 - other thing I need to do is then get get
11:40 - in section 7 here this one so I need all
11:48 - these images I think I have this code
11:54 - somewhere desktop maybe
12:03 - Desktop website yes yes yes tutorials
12:08 - p5.js by the way anybody wants projects
12:14 - helping me think the read organize all
12:16 - this stuff would be amazing
12:18 - eight seven actually one thing I want to
12:21 - do is now that there web better just it
12:22 - just means everything everything I ever
12:24 - do on my channel I want to have a web
12:26 - editor version that you can just click
12:28 - on in the videos descriptions of that if
12:30 - you that I could would love help with
12:32 - but that's not what I'm doing right now
12:34 - I am going for here object images
12:39 - kittens so let's just move this to the
12:42 - oh no not move it let's paste it on the
12:45 - desktop just minimize this for a second
12:51 - move it over here and move it here how
12:57 - do I get a nice yeah there we go
13:01 - [Music]
13:05 - no I want this yeah there we go I'm like
13:12 - obsessively kittens and kittens and
13:15 - kittens there we go
13:22 - now the web editor and this goes here
13:31 - this can be here and appeared in Roswell
13:41 - asked beard inferior to the one in the
13:44 - video true okay so now this one is gonna
13:49 - come right here alright so this is gonna
13:57 - be like a prequel 27.8 I don't know
14:01 - whether we should renumber them or what
14:02 - figure that out later I'm gonna cycle
14:05 - the camera
14:17 - hello again it's me from the future
14:19 - inserting myself into your playlist of
14:22 - videos I am making a video to go right
14:24 - here in between seven point seven and
14:26 - seven point eight I don't know how you
14:28 - ended up here but this is best the
14:30 - intended point of watching between these
14:32 - two in this tutorial series so what I'm
14:35 - going to show you but you could also
14:36 - just be here because you want to know
14:37 - how to add images to the p5 web editor
14:40 - so this is in a series about
14:42 - object-oriented programming and in seven
14:45 - point eight this next video I look at
14:47 - how to use an image in an object and
14:49 - then have multiple objects each showing
14:51 - a different image all sorts of fun so
14:53 - but in both of these videos I'm using
14:55 - the atom text editor and just opening up
14:58 - my JavaScript p5 sketch in the Chrome
15:01 - browser directly and now I want to show
15:04 - you how to do this oh and here I'm in
15:06 - the p5 web editor so I'm gonna create a
15:08 - new sketch let me just save this and
15:12 - create a new sketch I mean it okay cuz
15:14 - that's something else going on and okay
15:17 - so what I want to do is just look at
15:18 - what let's say I am I've made this
15:21 - beautiful sketch it is this beautiful
15:23 - rectangle it's just this lovely shade of
15:26 - gray but what I really want is a kitten
15:28 - to appear there oh I just so happen to
15:31 - have this nice directory of little tiny
15:33 - kitten images I like this one and what I
15:37 - want to do is load this kitten JPEG into
15:40 - my sketch so code wise there are two
15:43 - functions that I need to know about one
15:44 - is a function called load image and
15:46 - another is a function called image so I
15:48 - might as well talk about those two while
15:50 - I'm here although I think I probably
15:51 - talked about those in the next video as
15:52 - well but more importantly the purpose of
15:54 - this video is how do I actually get this
15:56 - image this image into this sketch so
16:00 - once again this is a time for me to go
16:02 - over here and reveal pull back the
16:04 - curtain of the p5 web editor I've done
16:07 - this before when I made a second
16:08 - JavaScript file we can see that there's
16:10 - also an HTML file and a style dot CSS
16:13 - file what goes on in these files are
16:15 - things that I get into in a future
16:16 - playlist about the p5 Dom library but
16:19 - right here what I want to do is I want
16:21 - to go here and I want to say add file I
16:23 - did this is exactly what I did when I
16:25 - made a new
16:27 - like bubble Jas file ad file but here
16:30 - instead I can say oh you know what I
16:33 - have a feeling by the way this is the
16:34 - high contrast this is sorry this is
16:37 - maleeh this will be irrelevant that I'm
16:39 - saying this soon this is the high
16:41 - contrast theme this doesn't look like it
16:43 - passes the line pause for a second I
16:51 - we're going to file a bug report here
16:54 - color contrast checker we're going to
17:01 - coming down this download this or kind
17:04 - of just use it here or I can use it here
17:06 - so somebody help me out here there's a
17:08 - way to like there's a tool that I
17:09 - there's an app that you can download
17:11 - let me see color conscious analyzer Mac
17:15 - OS yeah let me grab this one let's see
17:26 - if this works
17:27 - sorry for this digression but this is
17:30 - super important let me run this okay do
17:36 - this no come on come on people
17:41 - what is it control option I can never
17:44 - remember command no option
17:48 - no I forget there's a way to do control
17:55 - if I control privacy no privacy privacy
18:00 - privacy privacy security privacy privacy
18:02 - security security privacy
18:08 - general yes open anyway thank you very
18:11 - much
18:13 - okay now let's check this the foreground
18:19 - color is there's a way I feel like
18:24 - there's a way that I can actually just
18:27 - know this there's a way to have this
18:34 - grab the color from here how do I do
18:37 - that
18:38 - color analyzer edit there's a color
18:41 - picker here I guess I could just look at
18:45 - the CSS whoops I'm determined to use
18:48 - this in a way that I saw a demo of this
18:51 - recently that was amazing but I don't
18:56 - remember how do I have to take like
19:02 - anybody know how to do this
19:04 - [Music]
19:15 - hold on I'm sort of I went off the rails
19:21 - here but I'm I'm I'm a stubborn stubborn
19:29 - person oh can I use this oh there we go
19:33 - that's what I want to look at okay I
19:35 - figured it out okay so I want to pick
19:37 - this color I'm gonna pick the darkest
19:39 - and the background color is white yeah
19:42 - look at this this fails the high
19:48 - contrast so close this let me take a
19:52 - screenshot of it let's go to p5.js web
20:00 - editor here we go
20:07 - issues now could there be one already
20:12 - what should i search for like high
20:18 - contrast I'll just search for contrast
20:34 - let me see
20:38 - ability to run multiple tabs so you can
20:40 - move the Bunco code no that's a
20:42 - different thing
20:46 - all right so this is something else okay
20:49 - so I'm going to erase this because I'm
20:52 - confident in well I'm gonna say new file
21:06 - new file drop zone low contrast in high
21:11 - contrast drag and drop instructions so
21:27 - can I give it a label like accessibility
21:31 - is there no accessibility label
21:39 - I won't worry about a label new file
21:44 - drag and drop drop low contrast in the
21:51 - high contrast mode on Mac OS Chrome
21:56 - browser
21:58 - the instructions drop files here to
22:07 - upload actually can I just get that from
22:09 - here drop files here to upload is not a
22:23 - high contrast and then now I'm going to
22:30 - drag this over here preview it yep
22:35 - okay and
22:38 - [Music]
23:00 - contrast tests alright I think that's
23:03 - good enough submit this issue there we
23:07 - go and I will reference this in the
23:13 - video's description and I'm gonna come
23:16 - back to here
23:17 - and I am going to all right back okay
23:25 - all right ah all right so now I can go
23:29 - here just like I did when I added a new
23:32 - bubble das file I'm gonna go add file
23:34 - and then here instead of creating a new
23:37 - file what I could do is actually drag a
23:39 - new file right in here or I can click
23:41 - here to select a file but I have my
23:44 - where'd my kittens go shoot I messed
23:51 - this up try this one more time I'm too
23:58 - easily distracted which is a bit of a
24:00 - problem sometimes okay okay so I want to
24:08 - look for this little arrow here again
24:11 - and click Add hold on
24:14 - yeah so I want to look for that little
24:18 - arrow again and click Add file just like
24:21 - what I did before when I added a new
24:22 - JavaScript file like bubbles yes but now
24:25 - instead of typing in a new file
24:27 - I actually am just going to drag a file
24:29 - over here into this region I could also
24:31 - click here and it's gonna open up a kind
24:33 - of like finder thing but I'm just gonna
24:34 - come over here I'm gonna grab my kitten
24:35 - this lovely little kitten I'm gonna drag
24:37 - it over here and then it's going to
24:39 - upload it is done and we can see kitten
24:42 - do dot JPEG is now part of this project
24:45 - you should realize though there is a
24:47 - limit I can't remember it's like five
24:48 - megabytes or ten megabytes you can't
24:50 - upload really big files to the web
24:52 - editor at present you know maybe in the
24:54 - future we'll figure out ways of managing
24:55 - the data so that you can okay so now
24:58 - just to just to finish this off I said I
25:02 - want to have a variable called image and
25:04 - that's the image where I want to that's
25:06 - the variable where I want to load the
25:08 - file into and then when I once I have
25:12 - that I want to draw
25:13 - that image to the canvas of course it's
25:15 - giving me an error now cannot read
25:17 - property with of undefined cannot read
25:21 - property with of undefined but because
25:24 - the image is not there okay so I need to
25:26 - actually load the image and then you
25:28 - might think like okay well there's a
25:30 - load image function so why not just use
25:32 - load image and in quotes reference the
25:35 - name of that JPEG well this doesn't work
25:37 - because I cannot call p5 functions
25:40 - outside of set up or draw it doesn't
25:43 - actually know what a p5 function is so
25:45 - what I could do is then say all right
25:48 - well image needs to be a global variable
25:51 - and I'm over explaining this but I think
25:54 - it's worth sort of noting all this so
25:56 - let me put load image in setup and there
25:59 - it worked
25:59 - there's the image of the kitten hmm why
26:02 - did this work though weird let me run
26:03 - this again did you see how like the
26:06 - kitten wasn't there at first for like a
26:08 - little bit like what if I say here no
26:11 - loop the kitten doesn't appear even
26:16 - though it Kim's being loaded and set up
26:18 - and then being drawn and draw so one of
26:21 - the things you have to start getting
26:22 - used to is the asynchronous nature of
26:25 - JavaScript and this will come more and
26:27 - more as you go into the videos about
26:29 - working with data and the Dom library
26:31 - but when we asked to load an image it's
26:34 - not going to be immediately ready it
26:36 - takes some time for it to go and grab
26:38 - those pixels and load them into memory
26:39 - but p5 and there's ways of using
26:42 - something called a callback which I will
26:43 - get to in a future video but the best
26:46 - way for you to do this right now so use
26:48 - a function called preload and preload is
26:51 - a special function it's kind of like the
26:53 - prequel to set up set up is where
26:56 - everything begins but before setup we
26:58 - have preload and what preload does is it
27:01 - as a place where you can load any media
27:03 - or data assets and make sure they are
27:05 - ready before setup and draw happen so in
27:08 - this case even with no loop that kittens
27:10 - always going to be there and just
27:12 - incidentally while we're here we should
27:13 - note that you know image the image
27:15 - function drawing this particular image
27:17 - which maybe I should be more clear about
27:20 - my variable naming and name it kitten
27:22 - this is exactly like the rectangle
27:26 - I am drawing a rectangle at 0-0 the only
27:30 - difference is I'm filling that rectangle
27:31 - with the pixels from that image but I
27:33 - can do things like give it a width and a
27:35 - height and you can see I've stretched
27:36 - the kitten this could be these could be
27:38 - variables and you can see now I'm it's
27:43 - gonna resize it's just a rectangle I
27:45 - could do things like say X and have a
27:49 - variable called X and I could say you
27:55 - know X plus plus and now the kitten is
27:58 - slowly moving I couldn't change the Y
28:00 - value so it's just another thing to draw
28:03 - that you can rotate and twist and color
28:05 - and turn and all that and in the next
28:07 - video if you are here if you happen to
28:09 - be watching this as part of this
28:11 - playlist what I'm actually going to show
28:13 - you in the next video you can sort of
28:14 - see it in the thumbnail is to make a
28:17 - whole bunch of objects that are images
28:18 - and animate them around the window okay
28:21 - so I hope help this clarify a little bit
28:23 - about using the p5 web editor with all
28:25 - these other surrounding videos and a55
28:28 - mmm didn't get it right here you're
28:29 - confused please let me know in the
28:31 - comments and I look forward to seeing
28:32 - you in a future video okay now I just
28:40 - want to look at something I sort of
28:42 - think that also this
28:49 - I doubt is high contrast enough okay so
28:51 - let's look at this and now I want to go
28:56 - to how did I do this
28:58 - I go here how did I get that picker
29:00 - again oh here and then I get the dropper
29:03 - so I want to get I'm gonna get the
29:08 - brightest part of the letter and then
29:12 - the background color is picker here yeah
29:20 - this also fails
29:28 - wait let me
29:36 - we also file this where was I there
29:48 - p5 JJ s web editor
30:08 - and now let me upload this one and then
30:11 - I've got to go
30:21 - all right that looks good okay um I
30:28 - don't know what's being discussed in the
30:31 - chat Oh sook so uh says there's a
30:34 - contrast test in the yeah in the chrome
30:39 - developer tools that's right there's a
30:40 - lot of accessibility testing in the
30:42 - chrome developer tools I don't know how
30:43 - to use that off the top of my head
30:48 - what's disabled I'm just curious so I've
30:54 - got to go that's really all I came on to
30:56 - do I'm gonna hit stop recording in case
30:58 - I also like is this gonna crash this
31:00 - darn thing is gonna crash they didn't
31:02 - crash which is lucky and yeah Mastodon
31:10 - BOTS
31:11 - oh I'm just about ready to release the
31:13 - leases you coding challenge video I
31:16 - still don't have youtube premieres
31:18 - unlock for my account I mention that
31:20 - already and yeah I ever do this like
31:28 - live streaming for like this is
31:29 - literally under a half an hour I think
31:34 - no 31 minutes and 20 seconds and there
31:37 - are apparently 463 people watching do
31:44 - you have to law 8 honest you have to log
31:46 - in to use the uploading feature yes you
31:48 - cannot save Oh super chat is disabled
31:51 - that's interesting I wonder if I
31:54 - disabled that or if it's just disabled
32:01 - on YouTube in general now I'm curious
32:03 - not that I really care settings is the
32:16 - join disabled just curious I didn't put
32:20 - slow mode on interesting I don't know
32:28 - don't really care
32:31 - oh yeah interesting all right anybody
32:37 - have any questions they want to ask
32:38 - before I go and play my new outro music
32:42 - thanks for watching today's episode of
32:47 - the coded rain about the movie 5gs web
32:49 - editor actually I do have a little
32:52 - curiosity thing I would like anybody to
32:55 - test this for me
32:57 - this is totally please turn this off
33:00 - right now if you don't want to feel like
33:02 - someone's selling something to you but I
33:04 - do have a new store that I've been kind
33:06 - of mentioning teespring teespring calm
33:09 - slash stores slash slash coating train
33:14 - let's see how this is working
33:16 - so this are some new t-shirts and things
33:19 - that I have available like for example
33:22 - if I click on this one which is one of
33:24 - my favorites
33:24 - I'll refractor this later you can get
33:29 - this and a few different styles are on a
33:31 - mug there's like the onesie and the kids
33:34 - they're supposed to be a women style a
33:38 - fitted shirt and a tank and a hoodie but
33:41 - none of those have shown up and also
33:43 - it's supposed to be like if I go here
33:46 - and you click and I click Buy It Now and
33:49 - I do not live in the United States if I
33:52 - live in the EU for example I don't know
33:54 - what happens if you're in other
33:55 - countries besides the US or Europe and I
33:57 - hit this and I click Add to Cart it
34:03 - should automatically figure out that I'm
34:06 - through my IP address or account or
34:08 - whatever that I am NOT a u.s. person
34:11 - when I go proceed to checkout it's going
34:14 - to give me a nice inexpensive in euros
34:17 - or pounds shipping price and not like
34:20 - twelve dollars in u.s. dollars because
34:22 - it's shipping from the US could you let
34:23 - me know if that we don't have to buy it
34:24 - just get to this step and let me know
34:27 - what shipping price you see and then you
34:30 - can feel free to write to support a
34:33 - teespring which I will cuz I've been
34:34 - kind of asking all day to see if we can
34:37 - get that fixed ok I want to mention that
34:42 - and that's it this dot later this week
34:53 - on coding trade
34:54 - [Music]
34:56 - now soon this Friday at 11 a.m. I will
35:02 - have a guess Nabeel Husein who will be
35:05 - very loud who will be here to show you
35:10 - how to train a long short-term memory
35:13 - network it's a neural network design for
35:15 - sequences and what he's going to do is
35:21 - use a text corpus train the model and
35:23 - then generate new text based on that
35:25 - corpus it's going to run on the spell
35:27 - platform so check that out most recent
35:31 - upload os-- is a unique style transfer
35:34 - series which is also using the spell
35:36 - platform and tensor flow and ml5 Jas I
35:38 - did a bunch of videos on mastodons
35:40 - yesterday where is oh it's and coming -
35:45 - coming out tomorrow morning the Lisa jus
35:47 - coding challenge video I'm just waiting
35:49 - for the captioning to be done 12:50
35:52 - shipping $12 in germany just shipping
35:54 - yes this is not what it's supposed to be
35:57 - so you can actually go to
36:00 - [Music]
36:02 - so you can go to teespring stores I
36:08 - think it's like the - coating train - EU
36:15 - so this is a URL which will take you to
36:20 - a place where it would give you like you
36:23 - shipping let's try this
36:25 - I like this color maybe do I that's a
36:28 - little weird it's also like it's the
36:30 - wrong colors but whatever let's say I do
36:33 - this and then I say I want the large and
36:38 - I do this and then I'm gonna proceed to
36:43 - checkout I don't understand now I got
36:50 - $4.99 for shipping for this one cuz it's
36:52 - from the EU store it's supposed to like
36:54 - Auto figure it out but it doesn't seem
36:59 - to be working so III it's not working I
37:05 - don't know why I got so I don't know
37:07 - what to do about this but if anyway but
37:11 - the stuff is there if you're so
37:13 - interested but I haven't actually like
37:16 - officially launched it yet because I
37:17 - would like it to a I would like to have
37:18 - the fitted and tanks and I would like it
37:21 - to figure out the shipping in a way
37:23 - that's not going to break the bank for
37:25 - people okay um any other questions I
37:30 - think I know it's 542 I've really got to
37:33 - go let's finish my song
37:38 - [Music]
37:44 - I'll be back on Friday Friday morning at
37:47 - 11 a.m. with guests Nabil Hussein stay
37:51 - tuned for the Lisa's you coding
37:52 - challenge video make your Lisa shoe
37:54 - patterns and all that stuff
37:58 - [Music]
38:04 - and the thing is a very bad idea
38:07 - live control room yeah this spring I
38:14 - want to do more reinforcement learning
38:17 - stuff when I do the nature of code class
38:19 - again build on top of that with tensor
38:22 - flow Jas goodbye see you next week on me
38:25 - on Friday or maybe tomorrow if I do
38:27 - another special box in half an hour
38:28 - livestream

Cleaned transcript:

hello this is a total surprise I was just up here doing some stuff and I was like a half an hour this is what I've always dreamed of I just have a little extra time I believe to get to something I'm just gonna like turn on the live streaming and be here the live stream them the cool the main live stream for this week not to mention the one I did yesterday the kids will be this coming Friday and so today I don't know how much it's gonna interest those of you who might actually be tuning in right now but I have a little gap in my intro videos let me see if I can find those let me turn off the sound here for a sec and go to here and go to here so I need to feed this so you know this year I remade I really need to read I want to remake what I remade Irene may i remade one two three four five six no one's telling me that I you did my microphone by accident today that's good all the way up to 1.6 were remade so these I made this fall and then I don't I don't have time to just continuously remake all these tutorials and they still apply but at some point at some point at some point here I create and let me just look through this video at some point I start I make a class maybe in a separate JavaScript file let's see I'm not signed in with my YouTube premium I need to sign over my YouTube premium so here already okay no I don't have a separate bubble j/s file so I haven't shown how to do that do I at some point anybody watch these recently no what about at the end of the video no look at that okay so this that's where this would go so right now I'm gonna make a quick video that will be six point four I mean it's gonna be just like a couple minutes long so I need to grab that code so I think now if I go to coding train website and go to code tutorials p5.js if I just six six point three here we go and I bring this into here that's great oh how lovely so let me move this over to here let me move this over to here all right so here we go I'm ready for this right now oh hello there it is me from the future entering into your playlist of intro to programming with p5.js in the previous video that you were watching about objectoriented programming I was using a text editor known as the atom text editor the p5 web editor didn't exist yet now if you started this whole playlist from the very beginning you'll notice that I started with the p5 web editor because I made the intro videos just like a month ago and then the other videos about object were last year and some of them were two years ago the narrative follows but the videos are all made at different times so I'm stepping in here for a moment just to show you a bit about working with objects and classes in the p5 web editor and one of the things that you'll want to do probably so this is the example from the previous video six point six point three so I'm making six point four right now and what I'm going to show you here is what if you know I'm gonna eventually make a much more complex sketch and it's gonna have you know bubbles and rainbows and unicorns and cupcakes and puppies and turtles right so I might have a class turtle class puppy and class unicorn you know this this one sketch JS file could get quite long and quite large so one of the things I could do is I can actually make a separate JavaScript file I can call it anything I want I'm gonna call it bubble Jas and I can put the bubble class in that file and allow me to sort of know that when I want to make changes of the bubble I go to that bubble file when I want to make changes to set up and draw I go to sketch touch yes when I want to make changes of turtle I go to turtle touch yes so that's what I want to show you it's not really necessary for this but it'll help you sort of scale up as you move forward now you can actually it doesn't just this isn't just only for putting classes in separate JavaScript files it's just a good time for me to show you that you get a multiple JavaScript files for one sketch in the web editor all right so if I this is where you want to look and I should also reference to you casee tarik Asia and the creator of the p5 web editor meeting nice 20 minute video about all of the features which are also referenced which goes through a lot of different pieces of the web editor I'm just kind of highlighting this one thing so I want to go over here and click this and you can see now I have the project folder and look all of the secrets are revealed all this time you've just been working with sketch jas that's your JavaScript code but the sketch digest code is only executed because it is referenced inside of this other files hidden file index on HTML this is actually just a plain old HTML file and we don't know about HTML maybe you do in my next playlist about like p5 the p5 Dom library we get into what that HTML file is a bit more but if I look at it we can see that I look at this there's this reference script there's a script its source is the file sketch j/s if I want to have a new JavaScript file I'm going to need to edit this file and I'm gonna need to make a reference to button dot J so I need to make a reference not button bubble whatever I was doing an example earlier that was button bubble once I've added that I can then go here and back to this a little error right here I can click this and I can say add file are you seeing that and then I can zoom back out and I'm going to name this bubble J s and you can see it appeared right there I'm going to click on it it's empty I'm gonna close this I'm gonna go to sketch guess I'm gonna grab my bubble class all of this code and I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna paste it in here I'm gonna hit save and now I'm gonna run it again it's the same exact thing nothing has changed the difference is my code for setup and draw is just right here and my code for the bubble class is now in a separate file so when it's time for me to think like you know what I want the bubble to move faster then I can just do this and change these numbers here I'm gonna put on auto refresh so that it updates automatically whenever I make these changes so you can see ah it's going faster then it's like slower but mostly to the right and then I want to change the you know the color a little bit too you know so I'm changing things but now in if I want to change stuff with the sketch I want to change where the bubble starts then I want to change this here so you can see I have now just resource organization to enter of the URL for it duplicate this sketch into your own account try to add another class and another JavaScript file or maybe you like just add like another JavaScript file and put the mousepressed function in that reorganize your code with multiple files don't forget to go in and reference them in index.html hold on you can set which modifier key in the settings I mentioned oh people are talking about something unrelated in the live chat going on okay good bye later ok there that was fast oo I know what I went to mention hold on let me match it was like good to know a perfect know edit video that I'm gonna have to adjust cut out that thing about me looking at the chat and I would say okay so okay so you now you've wrapped up this section on making classes and objects in JavaScript if you want a little exercise here what I might suggest is duplicate this sketch the URL to it will be in the video's description um see if you can add yet another JavaScript file maybe put like the mousepressed function in it or maybe add some other sort of object turtle that I keep referencing you know this little turtle that moves across the screen can you have a separate class I'll give that a try I will also note and I'm gonna do this in a separate video that's gonna come in the next like it's actually going to it will appear around objects and images or somewhere I got to look where it should go but I'm gonna do another video where I show you how to add media assets to the project which you can load so thanks for watching this and I will see you soon goodbye okay so that was good a little quick quick I wasn't kidding when I said quick videos so now let me see here I guess I mean in this playlist let's look at what happens in this one I really I have YouTube premium so that specifically said that ads don't show but okay so this is a no have I and I still still did it make a separate okay so I wonder what I'm saying here I have to listen to myself for a second and so there's a couple ideas one is I could leave this video as is and just make a separate video that comes before to show like in the next video I'm gonna use these kittens and flowers but I'm going to show you how to get them in the web better that's probably what I should do we could also I could also unlist I'm never gonna delete a video but unless this video and I have Matt you edit in like like right here like stop I'm going to show you how to get these things in the web editor and then have it go on probably the safer thing is to do a separate video so I think I'm gonna do a video here so let me go back and the other thing I need to do is then get get in section 7 here this one so I need all these images I think I have this code somewhere desktop maybe Desktop website yes yes yes tutorials p5.js by the way anybody wants projects helping me think the read organize all this stuff would be amazing eight seven actually one thing I want to do is now that there web better just it just means everything everything I ever do on my channel I want to have a web editor version that you can just click on in the videos descriptions of that if you that I could would love help with but that's not what I'm doing right now I am going for here object images kittens so let's just move this to the oh no not move it let's paste it on the desktop just minimize this for a second move it over here and move it here how do I get a nice yeah there we go no I want this yeah there we go I'm like obsessively kittens and kittens and kittens there we go now the web editor and this goes here this can be here and appeared in Roswell asked beard inferior to the one in the video true okay so now this one is gonna come right here alright so this is gonna be like a prequel 27.8 I don't know whether we should renumber them or what figure that out later I'm gonna cycle the camera hello again it's me from the future inserting myself into your playlist of videos I am making a video to go right here in between seven point seven and seven point eight I don't know how you ended up here but this is best the intended point of watching between these two in this tutorial series so what I'm going to show you but you could also just be here because you want to know how to add images to the p5 web editor so this is in a series about objectoriented programming and in seven point eight this next video I look at how to use an image in an object and then have multiple objects each showing a different image all sorts of fun so but in both of these videos I'm using the atom text editor and just opening up my JavaScript p5 sketch in the Chrome browser directly and now I want to show you how to do this oh and here I'm in the p5 web editor so I'm gonna create a new sketch let me just save this and create a new sketch I mean it okay cuz that's something else going on and okay so what I want to do is just look at what let's say I am I've made this beautiful sketch it is this beautiful rectangle it's just this lovely shade of gray but what I really want is a kitten to appear there oh I just so happen to have this nice directory of little tiny kitten images I like this one and what I want to do is load this kitten JPEG into my sketch so code wise there are two functions that I need to know about one is a function called load image and another is a function called image so I might as well talk about those two while I'm here although I think I probably talked about those in the next video as well but more importantly the purpose of this video is how do I actually get this image this image into this sketch so once again this is a time for me to go over here and reveal pull back the curtain of the p5 web editor I've done this before when I made a second JavaScript file we can see that there's also an HTML file and a style dot CSS file what goes on in these files are things that I get into in a future playlist about the p5 Dom library but right here what I want to do is I want to go here and I want to say add file I did this is exactly what I did when I made a new like bubble Jas file ad file but here instead I can say oh you know what I have a feeling by the way this is the high contrast this is sorry this is maleeh this will be irrelevant that I'm saying this soon this is the high contrast theme this doesn't look like it passes the line pause for a second I we're going to file a bug report here color contrast checker we're going to coming down this download this or kind of just use it here or I can use it here so somebody help me out here there's a way to like there's a tool that I there's an app that you can download let me see color conscious analyzer Mac OS yeah let me grab this one let's see if this works sorry for this digression but this is super important let me run this okay do this no come on come on people what is it control option I can never remember command no option no I forget there's a way to do control if I control privacy no privacy privacy privacy privacy security privacy privacy security security privacy general yes open anyway thank you very much okay now let's check this the foreground color is there's a way I feel like there's a way that I can actually just know this there's a way to have this grab the color from here how do I do that color analyzer edit there's a color picker here I guess I could just look at the CSS whoops I'm determined to use this in a way that I saw a demo of this recently that was amazing but I don't remember how do I have to take like anybody know how to do this hold on I'm sort of I went off the rails here but I'm I'm I'm a stubborn stubborn person oh can I use this oh there we go that's what I want to look at okay I figured it out okay so I want to pick this color I'm gonna pick the darkest and the background color is white yeah look at this this fails the high contrast so close this let me take a screenshot of it let's go to p5.js web editor here we go issues now could there be one already what should i search for like high contrast I'll just search for contrast let me see ability to run multiple tabs so you can move the Bunco code no that's a different thing all right so this is something else okay so I'm going to erase this because I'm confident in well I'm gonna say new file new file drop zone low contrast in high contrast drag and drop instructions so can I give it a label like accessibility is there no accessibility label I won't worry about a label new file drag and drop drop low contrast in the high contrast mode on Mac OS Chrome browser the instructions drop files here to upload actually can I just get that from here drop files here to upload is not a high contrast and then now I'm going to drag this over here preview it yep okay and contrast tests alright I think that's good enough submit this issue there we go and I will reference this in the video's description and I'm gonna come back to here and I am going to all right back okay all right ah all right so now I can go here just like I did when I added a new bubble das file I'm gonna go add file and then here instead of creating a new file what I could do is actually drag a new file right in here or I can click here to select a file but I have my where'd my kittens go shoot I messed this up try this one more time I'm too easily distracted which is a bit of a problem sometimes okay okay so I want to look for this little arrow here again and click Add hold on yeah so I want to look for that little arrow again and click Add file just like what I did before when I added a new JavaScript file like bubbles yes but now instead of typing in a new file I actually am just going to drag a file over here into this region I could also click here and it's gonna open up a kind of like finder thing but I'm just gonna come over here I'm gonna grab my kitten this lovely little kitten I'm gonna drag it over here and then it's going to upload it is done and we can see kitten do dot JPEG is now part of this project you should realize though there is a limit I can't remember it's like five megabytes or ten megabytes you can't upload really big files to the web editor at present you know maybe in the future we'll figure out ways of managing the data so that you can okay so now just to just to finish this off I said I want to have a variable called image and that's the image where I want to that's the variable where I want to load the file into and then when I once I have that I want to draw that image to the canvas of course it's giving me an error now cannot read property with of undefined cannot read property with of undefined but because the image is not there okay so I need to actually load the image and then you might think like okay well there's a load image function so why not just use load image and in quotes reference the name of that JPEG well this doesn't work because I cannot call p5 functions outside of set up or draw it doesn't actually know what a p5 function is so what I could do is then say all right well image needs to be a global variable and I'm over explaining this but I think it's worth sort of noting all this so let me put load image in setup and there it worked there's the image of the kitten hmm why did this work though weird let me run this again did you see how like the kitten wasn't there at first for like a little bit like what if I say here no loop the kitten doesn't appear even though it Kim's being loaded and set up and then being drawn and draw so one of the things you have to start getting used to is the asynchronous nature of JavaScript and this will come more and more as you go into the videos about working with data and the Dom library but when we asked to load an image it's not going to be immediately ready it takes some time for it to go and grab those pixels and load them into memory but p5 and there's ways of using something called a callback which I will get to in a future video but the best way for you to do this right now so use a function called preload and preload is a special function it's kind of like the prequel to set up set up is where everything begins but before setup we have preload and what preload does is it as a place where you can load any media or data assets and make sure they are ready before setup and draw happen so in this case even with no loop that kittens always going to be there and just incidentally while we're here we should note that you know image the image function drawing this particular image which maybe I should be more clear about my variable naming and name it kitten this is exactly like the rectangle I am drawing a rectangle at 00 the only difference is I'm filling that rectangle with the pixels from that image but I can do things like give it a width and a height and you can see I've stretched the kitten this could be these could be variables and you can see now I'm it's gonna resize it's just a rectangle I could do things like say X and have a variable called X and I could say you know X plus plus and now the kitten is slowly moving I couldn't change the Y value so it's just another thing to draw that you can rotate and twist and color and turn and all that and in the next video if you are here if you happen to be watching this as part of this playlist what I'm actually going to show you in the next video you can sort of see it in the thumbnail is to make a whole bunch of objects that are images and animate them around the window okay so I hope help this clarify a little bit about using the p5 web editor with all these other surrounding videos and a55 mmm didn't get it right here you're confused please let me know in the comments and I look forward to seeing you in a future video okay now I just want to look at something I sort of think that also this I doubt is high contrast enough okay so let's look at this and now I want to go to how did I do this I go here how did I get that picker again oh here and then I get the dropper so I want to get I'm gonna get the brightest part of the letter and then the background color is picker here yeah this also fails wait let me we also file this where was I there p5 JJ s web editor and now let me upload this one and then I've got to go all right that looks good okay um I don't know what's being discussed in the chat Oh sook so uh says there's a contrast test in the yeah in the chrome developer tools that's right there's a lot of accessibility testing in the chrome developer tools I don't know how to use that off the top of my head what's disabled I'm just curious so I've got to go that's really all I came on to do I'm gonna hit stop recording in case I also like is this gonna crash this darn thing is gonna crash they didn't crash which is lucky and yeah Mastodon BOTS oh I'm just about ready to release the leases you coding challenge video I still don't have youtube premieres unlock for my account I mention that already and yeah I ever do this like live streaming for like this is literally under a half an hour I think no 31 minutes and 20 seconds and there are apparently 463 people watching do you have to law 8 honest you have to log in to use the uploading feature yes you cannot save Oh super chat is disabled that's interesting I wonder if I disabled that or if it's just disabled on YouTube in general now I'm curious not that I really care settings is the join disabled just curious I didn't put slow mode on interesting I don't know don't really care oh yeah interesting all right anybody have any questions they want to ask before I go and play my new outro music thanks for watching today's episode of the coded rain about the movie 5gs web editor actually I do have a little curiosity thing I would like anybody to test this for me this is totally please turn this off right now if you don't want to feel like someone's selling something to you but I do have a new store that I've been kind of mentioning teespring teespring calm slash stores slash slash coating train let's see how this is working so this are some new tshirts and things that I have available like for example if I click on this one which is one of my favorites I'll refractor this later you can get this and a few different styles are on a mug there's like the onesie and the kids they're supposed to be a women style a fitted shirt and a tank and a hoodie but none of those have shown up and also it's supposed to be like if I go here and you click and I click Buy It Now and I do not live in the United States if I live in the EU for example I don't know what happens if you're in other countries besides the US or Europe and I hit this and I click Add to Cart it should automatically figure out that I'm through my IP address or account or whatever that I am NOT a u.s. person when I go proceed to checkout it's going to give me a nice inexpensive in euros or pounds shipping price and not like twelve dollars in u.s. dollars because it's shipping from the US could you let me know if that we don't have to buy it just get to this step and let me know what shipping price you see and then you can feel free to write to support a teespring which I will cuz I've been kind of asking all day to see if we can get that fixed ok I want to mention that and that's it this dot later this week on coding trade now soon this Friday at 11 a.m. I will have a guess Nabeel Husein who will be very loud who will be here to show you how to train a long shortterm memory network it's a neural network design for sequences and what he's going to do is use a text corpus train the model and then generate new text based on that corpus it's going to run on the spell platform so check that out most recent upload os is a unique style transfer series which is also using the spell platform and tensor flow and ml5 Jas I did a bunch of videos on mastodons yesterday where is oh it's and coming coming out tomorrow morning the Lisa jus coding challenge video I'm just waiting for the captioning to be done 1250 shipping $12 in germany just shipping yes this is not what it's supposed to be so you can actually go to so you can go to teespring stores I think it's like the coating train EU so this is a URL which will take you to a place where it would give you like you shipping let's try this I like this color maybe do I that's a little weird it's also like it's the wrong colors but whatever let's say I do this and then I say I want the large and I do this and then I'm gonna proceed to checkout I don't understand now I got $4.99 for shipping for this one cuz it's from the EU store it's supposed to like Auto figure it out but it doesn't seem to be working so III it's not working I don't know why I got so I don't know what to do about this but if anyway but the stuff is there if you're so interested but I haven't actually like officially launched it yet because I would like it to a I would like to have the fitted and tanks and I would like it to figure out the shipping in a way that's not going to break the bank for people okay um any other questions I think I know it's 542 I've really got to go let's finish my song I'll be back on Friday Friday morning at 11 a.m. with guests Nabil Hussein stay tuned for the Lisa's you coding challenge video make your Lisa shoe patterns and all that stuff and the thing is a very bad idea live control room yeah this spring I want to do more reinforcement learning stuff when I do the nature of code class again build on top of that with tensor flow Jas goodbye see you next week on me on Friday or maybe tomorrow if I do another special box in half an hour livestream
