07:16 - found the one i wanted to use plugged
07:18 - the batteries into charge overnight i
07:20 - pulled them out of the socket this
07:21 - morning they were dead so i have no idea
07:23 - what happened i moved them to another
07:25 - socket i think they're charging but this
07:27 - is the microphone that i am currently
07:30 - using
07:31 - so um
07:33 - hopefully you can hear me okay there

07:58 - i will be launching more officially as
08:00 - the school year begins in september to
08:02 - make a lot of tutorial videos and do all
08:04 - sorts of live streams and coding
08:05 - training stuff but that is not

08:11 - to do uh today i am here to celebrate 20
08:15 - years of processing or p5 this is uh

08:47 - total of
08:48 - we can do this two thousand dollars the
08:50 - fundraiser will extend beyond today
08:52 - there's lots of other ways to give to

09:21 - fine place to start um if you want to

17:13 - the first edition of processing was
17:15 - released if you'll indulge me for a
17:16 - moment in my own story this is not about
17:18 - me

17:21 - my first year as a student at itp which
17:23 - is the program where i teach now i took
17:26 - my first course in programming not using
17:29 - processing using macromedia director i
17:31 - know that stig in the chat had mentioned
17:34 - um

17:39 - mentioned also that he was using uh
17:41 - macromedia director at the time that is
17:44 - uh exactly what i was learning on i
17:46 - discovered processing a couple years
17:48 - later uh i taught my first course in

22:36 - basically the processing website was
22:37 - still running on like you know 15 plus
22:40 - years old pearl scripts that casey reese
22:43 - has developed over the years during the
22:44 - documentation this is an initiative from
22:47 - design systems international who uh
22:50 - generously donated their time design
22:53 - systems international uh is a design
22:56 - company roon matson and martine bravo
22:58 - and many others i got a little project
23:00 - going on with them as well more about
23:02 - that another time
23:04 - they uh redid uh the visual identity for
23:08 - the prostate foundation its projects and
23:09 - the new website so i encourage you to
23:11 - check out this twitter thread um you can
23:13 - see sort of like some fun images of how
23:15 - they imagine it this is a really cool
23:17 - little
23:18 - video here which i could just go to the
23:20 - actual web page but it's showing you
23:22 - kind of this little editor and how the
23:24 - logo itself is programmatic
23:27 - so it's centered around a program to
23:29 - drive logos from a simple set of rules
23:32 - right hey my whole life is based on
23:34 - making things off of simple sets of
23:36 - rules at this point draw three lines or
23:38 - curves in the intersections of an 8x8
23:40 - grid and this is one of the things that
23:42 - i really love about
23:44 - computational media creative coding and
23:46 - open source communities like processing
23:48 - and p5.js is the ability to take your
23:51 - ideas
23:53 - execute them and and and create new new
23:56 - designs new interfaces new animations uh
23:59 - just from rules and your own creativity
24:02 - so kudos this is really wonderful fun to
24:04 - play with i should click over there to
24:06 - look at it um you can sort of see some
24:08 - more stuff i encourage you to read all
24:09 - about it learn more about design systems
24:12 - international you can see the different
24:14 - logos and various things um and i'm
24:17 - going to i think now move back to just
24:20 - looking at the website itself so uh
24:23 - somebody had asked in the chat um
24:26 - if you
24:27 - uh can't
24:29 - uh if you if you're not able to donate
24:30 - via the youtube link and you would like
24:32 - to donate there's a donate button here
24:35 - which is just a direct um credit card uh
24:38 - payment powered by donorbox so this is a
24:40 - way that you can donate as well um and
24:44 - also there's the i don't know how to
24:45 - pronounce it
24:47 - hick nunk
24:48 - um fundraiser that you can also join uh
24:51 - but i encourage you to donate look at
24:52 - this i love this is my this is my
24:54 - absolute favorite thing
24:55 - you know you know as you can probably
24:57 - tell from my all my little like coding
24:59 - trained characters i love putting little
25:00 - eyeballs on anything i want to code this
25:02 - so i want to make my own version so if
25:04 - you want to learn about the code for the
25:06 - new logo i i feel like there should be
25:07 - more things i want to look at on the
25:09 - website but
25:11 - i guess i will hold off on that what i
25:13 - wanted to look at oh yeah open editor so
25:15 - this is the really cool thing here um i
25:18 - can click on this and sort of like play
25:20 - around with the colors
25:22 - um
25:23 - and uh i can start to i know i actually
25:27 - have not used this until right now but i
25:29 - think i can rewrite some of the code or
25:31 - i can like move things around i don't
25:33 - know how to do it oh yeah look at that
25:34 - whoa what am i doing this is wild uh and
25:38 - i can hit reset so lots of fun stuff one
25:40 - of the things i was sort of curious to
25:41 - do i wonder if i can copy paste this i'm
25:43 - having trouble copy pasting this
25:46 - anybody has an idea for how i could do
25:47 - that copy um
25:49 - from this code editor but um one of the
25:52 - things i was curious to do is what is
25:54 - the earliest version
25:57 - of
25:58 - processing that i can get this code to
26:02 - run on
26:03 - if somebody could as a little favor to
26:05 - me right now maybe
26:06 - figure out a way to put this code into
26:08 - like a github gist or something i'm
26:10 - probably just you know i'm
26:12 - i'm fairly inept using the computer i'm
26:14 - not sure if you've noticed
26:17 - you really should be instant i should be
26:18 - fired from my
26:19 - this is not a job
26:21 - but if i could be fired from it i
26:23 - absolutely should be fired um but if i
26:26 - could get this code um i would love to
26:29 - um
26:30 - uh see where i could get it to run all
26:32 - right so what is what else
26:35 - what else all right i think we're gonna
26:36 - move on now so again this is this won't
26:39 - be a super i'm just sorry looking at the
26:41 - chat is java running in the browser how
26:43 - did they do that asks armor um good
26:46 - question i seriously doubt java is
26:49 - running in the browser
26:50 - um but um most likely this is using some
26:55 - um like javascript behind the scenes
26:57 - whether it's p5.js in some magic way or
26:59 - there's a there is a project called
27:01 - processing.js i don't i'm i'm
27:04 - you know i shouldn't speculate but um
27:07 - if anyone from dsi is in the chat um you
27:10 - can uh absolutely chime in here all
27:12 - right
27:16 - okay i've calmed down a little bit
27:19 - all right we're gonna go now to ben
27:21 - fry's twitter
27:23 - this is uh by the way so from november
27:26 - 2020
27:27 - back in november 2020
27:30 - hold on this is perfect for me to play
27:32 - this
27:34 - it was a month before
27:37 - the processing 2020 fundraiser i really
27:40 - got to make those videos for the
27:41 - processing fundraiser but they're coming
27:42 - out
27:43 - uh the bezier curve one is coming out
27:45 - this summer so um august 2021 this was
27:48 - in november announced will be the 20th
27:49 - anniversary of processing how should
27:52 - [Music]
27:56 - all right this is my this is the theme
27:58 - song from the prosthetic fundraiser but
28:00 - uh we'll move on i'll play that at the
28:02 - end as an outro maybe um so um ben frye
28:06 - tweeted
28:07 - we're looking for your ideas i i don't
28:09 - know was his idea maybe for me to come
28:11 - on to a live stream with this with with
28:13 - my precious
28:15 - precious little little black box here
28:17 - that i'm about to turn on and plug in
28:19 - and show you maybe otherwise i'll be
28:21 - doing a presentation ben you could uh
28:24 - i'm not too far from you get in the car
28:25 - you could make it here still you could
28:27 - do your presentation on how we determine
28:29 - the exact time now i think there has
28:32 - been some latest breaking news about
28:33 - when the exact time might have actually
28:35 - been but i'll hold off i don't have that
28:37 - information at bay
28:39 - at hand
28:41 - on how we determine the exact time of
28:43 - the first release from a corrupted
28:45 - archive using a combo of hex editor the
28:48 - stuff it file format specs some code and
28:51 - knowledge of how 1984 style mac date
28:54 - timestamps work
28:55 - so
28:56 - this uh
28:58 - this all of this led to and by the way i
29:00 - have this file
29:03 - right here on my computer
29:05 - um
29:06 - that i totally know how to use
29:08 - totally know how to use this computer
29:10 - right here this is the file right there
29:13 - and you can see by the way thank you ben
29:15 - frye for providing me with all these
29:16 - look at this look at this treasure trove
29:18 - of versions of processing from the early
29:20 - days oh
29:22 - they're so beautiful and wonderful oh
29:24 - i'm so excited uh this one though
29:26 - however is uh corrupted so i'm not able
29:29 - to open it but fortunately the fixed one
29:32 - is here i have it i'm going to run it
29:34 - for you in a moment
29:35 - using my precious
29:37 - you think my batteries have charged is
29:39 - the audio fine let me know if i should
29:41 - bother um
29:42 - uh bother trying to go and get my
29:45 - batteries that are charging for my
29:47 - non-prop microphone i guess i could like
29:49 - you know clip it to my glasses or
29:51 - something i don't know
29:52 - hat
29:54 - okay oh stretch everybody get up and
29:56 - stretch you've been watching a live
29:57 - stream on youtube before i don't have a
29:59 - watch on i don't know 36 minutes 35
30:02 - minutes
30:03 - you should stretch i'm just checking my
30:05 - phone because my kids are by themselves
30:07 - in the house i swear did i mention put
30:10 - out breakfast home there they're like
30:12 - practically teenagers they'll be fine
30:14 - um
30:16 - uh
30:17 - oh there's batteries in the kitchen
30:19 - they're telling me so i could go get
30:20 - those
30:21 - um all right all right all right i did
30:22 - not look at my phone anymore i just
30:24 - wanna make sure no emergency like i was
30:26 - trying to cook some eggs and the house
30:27 - is on fire
30:29 - texts everything's fine sound is good
30:31 - echo reverb is there's a bit of an echo
30:33 - yeah i'm thank you zack knight for your
30:35 - donation apologies i'm not catching all
30:37 - these donations i can see that we're up
30:38 - to 402
30:41 - all right i see the processing.org logo
30:43 - code has been uh gifted to me in discord
30:46 - i will come back to that
30:49 - all right so
30:51 - this is how
30:53 - uh i believe
30:54 - uh the the exact date and time was
30:57 - determined which um
31:00 - i'm trying to um
31:04 - right now it's in the video description
31:05 - of what you're watching right now
31:06 - somebody pasted the chat so i want to go
31:09 - back though i want to go back and look
31:11 - at so did you know
31:12 - that processing well there's been uh
31:14 - from what i understand and you should
31:16 - you know
31:17 - again i was not there so i am speaking
31:20 - third hand or from my memory of what
31:21 - people have told me
31:23 - but um there's been there were a few
31:24 - different names uh to what processing
31:27 - might have been called before processing
31:29 - i will not reveal those but at the time
31:32 - the website was process fiving with
31:35 - fives instead of the essence
31:37 - this is why you see the shorthand logo
31:40 - sometimes for processing as p5 and where
31:43 - the javascript version from the
31:44 - processing foundation created by lauren
31:45 - mccarthy and maintained by so many
31:48 - amazing people i can someone just print
31:51 - me a list of all their names so i could
31:52 - read them right now
31:53 - um
31:54 - uh process fiving that's where so i i
31:58 - believe that perhaps the domain was not
32:00 - available
32:02 - and that uh searching made doing an
32:04 - internet search for processing was
32:06 - always difficult so the fives were kind
32:08 - of a way of
32:10 - um
32:11 - creating more of a unique identifier and
32:14 - if we go back what's really fun about
32:16 - this and let's see if i can get to this
32:18 - one i'm going to try to go back
32:20 - and i'm going to go back on the internet
32:22 - wayback machine and we're going to look
32:23 - now at the 2001
32:28 - uh and again i looked at this stuff like
32:30 - a week ago but i haven't looked at it
32:31 - recently i can't remember i might have
32:32 - to click onto 2002 i don't recall we're
32:34 - gonna click back here
32:36 - uh to 2001
32:38 - uh november 30th so this is presumably
32:41 - august 9th being the original first
32:44 - release we're now a few months later
32:46 - looking at the first website uh
32:50 - for pro surviving
32:52 - and here it is
32:56 - uh process fiving we're gonna read this
32:58 - right now 20th of october 2001.
33:00 - processing is an environment for
33:03 - programming images
33:05 - movement and interaction it is a
33:06 - sketchbook for developing ideas a tool
33:09 - for creating prototypes and a context
33:11 - for learning the fundamentals of
33:12 - computer programming i would say all
33:14 - that holds true today and this is my
33:17 - favorite thing look at this look at all
33:18 - these variations
33:21 - process processing now with the yeses
33:23 - but a zero and a one
33:25 - environment is in its early stages and
33:27 - will continue to develop it just had a
33:28 - fun project idea to like make a text
33:31 - generator program that makes all
33:32 - versions of the word processing with
33:33 - different numbers
33:36 - processing with parentheses now is
33:38 - written in java and enables the creation
33:40 - of java applications and applets oh i
33:43 - miss you applets
33:45 - within a carefully designed set of
33:47 - constraints it uses a 2d 3d java
33:51 - rendering api that is a cross between
33:53 - postscript style imaging and 2d and 3d
33:56 - rendering with opengl i don't know if
33:58 - you all realize how amazingly innovative
34:00 - this was
34:02 - into that what uh like in
34:04 - incredible invention now this isn't to
34:06 - say that processing is the first example
34:09 - of so-called creative coding or that
34:11 - there aren't
34:12 - um many uh other systems that processing
34:15 - drew heavy inspiration from just to name
34:18 - a few a logo the well-known turtle
34:21 - graphics programming language and
34:23 - environment pioneered by uh many
34:25 - different people that i will not uh mess
34:27 - up the names of right now
34:30 - and then of course
34:31 - if you're not familiar with design by
34:33 - numbers
34:34 - design by numbers is a programming
34:36 - environment created by john mida who is
34:39 - the professor at mit media lab for casey
34:42 - and ben
34:44 - and
34:45 - designed my numbers was a programming
34:47 - system for uh designers to be able to
34:50 - learn to code and create computational
34:52 - designs i think for me and i'm speaking
34:54 - for myself here the innovation here of
34:57 - building upon that work of the design by
34:59 - number system and i wish i had a lot of
35:01 - historical stuff to pull up for you
35:03 - about design by numbers no prepared
35:05 - presentation here with slides or
35:06 - anything as you can see um but is this
35:09 - suddenly
35:10 - working with java
35:13 - by taking this idea of simple code you
35:16 - know
35:17 - i i have a from a presentation a slide i
35:19 - should pull this up of like how to draw
35:21 - a line in java without processing and
35:23 - it's like you know public main class
35:25 - string args blah blah blah it's like
35:27 - this crazy thing and then in processing
35:29 - you just say line this idea of
35:31 - simplifying boiling down
35:34 - all of the sort of logic to create a
35:37 - graphics content context
35:39 - and draw a line into a single line of
35:41 - code but placing that within a
35:44 - programming language like java which
35:46 - suddenly can do networking and serial
35:48 - and
35:49 - uh data and just anything that you could
35:51 - basically imagine i mean there's a sort
35:53 - of joke of like java is not the best at
35:56 - anything as a programming language but
35:58 - it's
35:58 - the best at doing everything i i'm
36:00 - paraphrasing i don't really get that
36:02 - right so that is really the uh i think
36:04 - amazing incredible and flash of course
36:06 - i'm forgetting to uh thank you to uh
36:08 - copper who mentioned flash i never
36:10 - really used flash so that's why i think
36:11 - it like falls out of my memory but also
36:13 - the lingo programming language created
36:15 - by um john henry thompson who um uh is a
36:20 - research fellow at itp and has done
36:22 - guest a guest video on a coding train
36:25 - that you should definitely check out as
36:26 - well those are other um presents all
36:27 - right
36:28 - so i love seeing this let's look at the
36:30 - reference
36:32 - so this is the full reference
36:35 - this is really fun
36:37 - so i don't know why i love it so much pr
36:39 - parentheses parenthesis
36:40 - ce51ng
36:42 - i just love all this okay environment
36:44 - coordinates programming modes default
36:46 - pro okay point line wrecked circle
36:48 - bezier curve bezier curve was their cat
36:51 - low rom curve that's not in there
36:53 - anymore look at that kavo rom curve try
36:56 - typing that in processing today good
36:57 - luck to you boy this violated everything
37:00 - i always knew about processing was
37:03 - the core ethos of processing is all
37:06 - about
37:07 - only two words to name a function that's
37:09 - three
37:10 - that's three that's a violation
37:12 - sphere sphere there was sphere even in
37:16 - the beginning the maybe sphere was is
37:18 - like instead of another circle wow
37:20 - circle was back in the original version
37:22 - of processing
37:23 - it went away was replaced by ellipse and
37:25 - now it's back again color
37:28 - all this stuff all right so um i guess
37:31 - what i want to do now
37:32 - uh get to the good stuff is look at this
37:36 - standard control numbers i'm sorry i'm
37:38 - just fascinated by this oh translate and
37:40 - rotate we're right there from the
37:41 - beginning lights on i mean
37:43 - was there a 3d renderer just even from
37:45 - the start i don't recall
37:47 - um
37:48 - okay
37:50 - now
37:51 - what i would like to do
37:53 - the cat mill rom curve is just curved
37:55 - now it says alka that is correct
37:58 - um what i would like to do now is switch
38:01 - over to my precious
38:04 - um i'm gonna just actually like i'm
38:06 - gonna grab my phone
38:08 - just give me a second here
38:11 - um and i'm going to go to woo do you can
38:14 - you see the sweat pouring down my
38:16 - face how's my lighting by the way in the
38:19 - the key of the green screen this is a
38:21 - whole new setup that i haven't used yet
38:23 - so any feedback on that i would love to
38:25 - hear it you definitely need to do more
38:26 - work on the sound
38:28 - um wait i'm looking for uh epocam pro
38:32 - okay let's see connect connect connect
38:35 - connect
38:39 - this was working yesterday without a
38:41 - hitch
38:42 - are you kidding me
38:46 - i do have backup
38:48 - all right well
38:49 - there's also this possibility
38:51 - i don't want to
38:53 - i don't know why this is not working
38:58 - i'm on
39:00 - let's see if i do
39:03 - this
39:05 - look see this is me trying to connect to
39:07 - this camera
39:10 - but i don't know why settings connection
39:13 - wi-fi
39:15 - uh
39:19 - all right i'm going to give this one
39:20 - more try
39:26 - and see
39:31 - oh i wonder if that's the
39:33 - um
39:36 - people are telling me the quality of my
39:37 - video isn't great
39:41 - of course
39:42 - this is not working
39:45 - all right it's you know i had to restart
39:46 - my
39:47 - router if some internet issues or i'm
39:49 - coming back to this all right so that's
39:51 - that's a little bit of a fail it's just
39:52 - going to show you a picture of this
39:54 - laptop but instead
39:56 - i'm going to press a button
39:58 - should pick up this microphone so you
39:59 - can hear the beautiful noise ready here
40:01 - we go
40:08 - this is i believe a 1999 era thinkpad
40:12 - computer it is the uh about the same
40:15 - computer that ben frye was using to
40:18 - develop the original version processing
40:20 - um and i got this off of ebay for 75
40:24 - i'm making a little computer museum for
40:26 - myself here in this garage
40:28 - um in upstate new york um i am get i'm
40:32 - getting my childhood apple ii plus
40:33 - computer i've got some old macs a
40:35 - clamshell mac i'm trying to get my hands
40:36 - on so if you've got an old computer that
40:39 - kind of still works you want to unload
40:41 - you can send it to me get in touch
40:44 - this is my new thing i love i love i
40:46 - just cannot get enough of using these
40:48 - older computers so
40:51 - i'm going to go unplug a cable and plug
40:54 - another cable back in and if all goes
40:56 - according to plan you will now be seeing
40:59 - the output of this thinkpad on the live
41:01 - stream this took me by the way i can't
41:03 - tell you how many hours i put into
41:06 - getting this computer to work
41:08 - to run old versions of processing and to
41:11 - uh get the output i shouldn't be saying
41:13 - this before it even works get the output
41:15 - the vga output into open broadcast
41:18 - studio to stream so here we go
41:20 - uh
41:23 - here we go unplugging a cable
41:27 - plugging a new cable in
41:29 - i'm really hoping you see this right now
41:31 - i don't know yet because i'm trying to
41:32 - stand up and not bang my head
41:35 - ah you do there it is
41:46 - all right so uh if you don't uh remember
41:49 - this this is windows 2000 again i
41:52 - believe this is i don't know what model
41:54 - number this is like but it's an ibm
41:56 - thinkpad this is actually the one of the
41:58 - compute this is a computer i used to use
42:00 - oh this is an x30 ibm thinkpad x30 um if
42:04 - i look on the bottom
42:06 - we'll see that
42:08 - the model number that's the serial
42:10 - number which i guess i probably
42:11 - shouldn't give out or i don't know if
42:12 - that matters it has a mac address anyway
42:15 - where's the model number i can't my
42:16 - eyesight is not good enough to see so
42:20 - um i have been enjoying using this
42:22 - computer updating my norton antivirus
42:25 - 2001. you can never be too careful
42:27 - doesn't matter if i've got a 1999
42:29 - thinkpad that's not connected to the
42:31 - internet
42:32 - better update i've got like a a cd-rom
42:34 - drive that plugs into it it's amazing
42:37 - i should go pull that out for you it's
42:39 - got a bunch of different things on the
42:41 - back i was going to show all this with
42:42 - you with my phone it actually has an
42:44 - ethernet port and i was
42:46 - ah oh great uh roon is in the chat from
42:48 - design systems international there you
42:50 - go um
42:52 - so um this what was i saying here um i
42:56 - actually was able to get this hooked up
42:57 - to the internet but it won't load barely
43:01 - any web pages because they all are https
43:03 - and the javascript stuff and like the
43:05 - browsers don't support you know i didn't
43:06 - want to so here we go without further
43:09 - ado
43:12 - i am now going to for you open up and by
43:16 - the way i should say
43:17 - i'll note that if you're interested in
43:20 - running old versions of processing you
43:22 - actually don't need a 1999 or 2000 era
43:26 - pc i have a maybe five-year-old pc i
43:29 - didn't actually try the one on windows
43:31 - 10 but it's like running a what's before
43:33 - windows 10. anyway i was able to run all
43:35 - the old versions on windows
43:38 - you could just on a modern windows
43:39 - computer you can go back and run every
43:41 - version of processing pretty much the
43:43 - problem is
43:44 - these things that were all that i cannot
43:46 - i cannot quit you
43:49 - right the power pc to intel to m1
43:52 - apple's
43:53 - voraciously and aggressively
43:57 - um
43:58 - deprecates things and i have been trying
44:01 - my darndest i even i have an old 2008
44:04 - mac but it has an upgrade it has os x on
44:08 - it and i've been trying to install tiger
44:10 - but it's not powered pc i've spent like
44:12 - a whole day trying to get old versus the
44:15 - processing around that but you really
44:17 - are you're it's a lost cause in many
44:18 - ways um i hope i can get an old some
44:21 - older macs to do it um to run older
44:23 - versions of processing but
44:25 - windows
44:26 - the stuff just works it continues to
44:28 - work and it works but it's more fun to
44:31 - run it on the original hardware itself
44:35 - oh my
44:36 - sound board doesn't work because i'm
44:39 - connected to the right so i forgot that
44:41 - my sound board
44:44 - is um
44:46 - connected through this laptop
44:48 - into the streaming system so when i
44:50 - unplug this laptop uh i so um i did buy
44:54 - an additional hdmi capture card it just
44:58 - did not show i think i even paid for
44:59 - expedited shipping so i could have them
45:01 - both going but it did not show up i'm in
45:03 - the boonies now so
45:05 - who knows who knows how it works up here
45:07 - all right um so a mental note no sound
45:10 - effects
45:11 - while i'm playing this um it actually
45:13 - has uh
45:15 - there's actually an audio cable here
45:17 - that i could get the audio out of but
45:19 - let's not worry about that all right
45:21 - no drum roll i'll just do it myself
45:26 - 001
45:28 - okay so look at this first of all let's
45:29 - just look let's just um and by the way
45:32 - i'm using the original
45:34 - why won't my phone work
45:38 - why won't it work to connect it's like
45:40 - i just keep doing it again and again
45:42 - thinking it's just gonna work this time
45:44 - you know what i'm gonna do
45:45 - i'm going to turn off my phone i'm going
45:47 - to restart my phone
45:50 - and uh see if that helps
45:53 - obviously i'm not going to restart the
45:54 - pc that'll be although i wonder if i can
45:57 - i really should i'm so stubborn i really
45:59 - shouldn't try this stuff while i'm live
46:00 - streaming
46:02 - epocam viewer let's open that up
46:05 - oh camera in use by another application
46:07 - oh that's weird
46:09 - um i bet you i could fix this but i
46:12 - gotta
46:15 - i gotta
46:16 - i gotta not not do it okay uh all right
46:19 - so let's do let's do view
46:22 - details
46:24 - okay so we see there's uh just this
46:27 - batch script a batch script is basically
46:30 - a text file do you think i could look at
46:33 - it
46:33 - uh edit
46:35 - yeah this is what it does bin jerry cp
46:39 - i'm sorry that i can't zoom in on this
46:41 - for you i could probably like through
46:43 - obs make this bigger but hopefully you
46:45 - can see it this is running
46:47 - pde.jar so even from the beginning from
46:50 - the very beginning pde processing
46:53 - development environment
46:55 - this is the original java command i
46:57 - don't know what echo off does does that
46:59 - mean don't bother to like spit out stuff
47:02 - to the command line but this is what it
47:04 - runs
47:05 - and you'll see here it's running these
47:07 - compiled java files which are here in
47:11 - as jars inside of the lib folder and
47:14 - there's always fun things to look at in
47:16 - here go back to details here like we can
47:18 - see here if i open up this
47:21 - these are all the original
47:24 - like icon designs just
47:26 - what did this just open this up in i
47:28 - don't know right you can see i want to
47:29 - like i'm trying to do all my mac
47:31 - commands
47:32 - these are all the original icons just
47:34 - right there in one single gif file that
47:36 - is really wild to see look at the colors
47:38 - and the looks of them what this idea of
47:40 - a play button
47:41 - uh a new you know obviously a play
47:44 - button is not a new concept but the idea
47:46 - of using it um can people see this okay
47:50 - um if
47:53 - my audio is not working somebody says i
47:55 - think it's just the audio from the
47:56 - computer but that's fine um
48:00 - windows 8
48:03 - um okay so um you can see pde properties
48:05 - fonta
48:07 - dbn.pde what is that
48:12 - that can i open this with something uh
48:14 - like text edit is there like a notepad
48:17 - or something on this computer
48:18 - notepad yeah
48:21 - ah this is oh that's dbn the very first
48:24 - program that's what it's actually going
48:25 - to open up
48:26 - i'm curious about this stuff all right
48:28 - all right without further ado
48:29 - what's in bin
48:32 - just some java you stuff some dlls
48:35 - good old dlls
48:37 - okay i'm going to run it now
48:41 - i can't click click there we go look
48:45 - there it is
48:46 - uh the original
48:48 - version of prostate so let's try to
48:50 - write some code so first of all i have
48:52 - no idea i love that it says there's no
48:54 - logo it says processing up in the top
48:57 - um
49:00 - we've got setup look at this can you see
49:02 - that
49:03 - that says i i know it's so small are
49:05 - there preferences
49:08 - can i can i raise the font size
49:11 - uh dbn stands for design by numbers that
49:13 - is correct asks um esteban um so one
49:16 - thing you'll notice here is void loop we
49:19 - could all be living in a world right the
49:22 - multiverse is is i don't know you know
49:24 - the multiverse of madness right what if
49:27 - not not to just make too many marvel
49:28 - references here um
49:30 - but uh the original there's no syntax
49:33 - highlighting but before there was draw
49:35 - there was loop and i guess if you've
49:37 - ever used arduino um i have from time to
49:39 - time you know things tend to explode or
49:41 - light on fire when i use arduino
49:44 - but um
49:46 - loop was the original name for the draw
49:49 - function because it is as i have said
49:51 - probably a hundred a thousand times in
49:53 - intro coding tutorials
49:56 - setup is the part of the program that
49:58 - runs once at the beginning
49:59 - loop is the part that runs over and over
50:02 - again so let's just actually run this
50:04 - sketch now
50:06 - and look there it is and i'm moving my
50:08 - mouse and look at it it's like a window
50:10 - with no borders no fanfare can i make it
50:13 - bigger
50:15 - let's see i'm
50:16 - let's make it uh bigger
50:23 - let's do 640 by 480. i don't know what
50:25 - color color scale must be like color
50:27 - mode
50:29 - oh it made the color scale 100 because
50:32 - the pixel width is 100 so if i do this i
50:35 - would want to make it
50:39 - and i would love to take your
50:40 - suggestions in the chat now for what i
50:42 - should try to code so i should make it
50:44 - 640 now does with work was with a
50:47 - built-in variable at the very beginning
50:49 - let's see
50:52 - syntax error unexpected token oh i
50:54 - forgot my semicolon
50:56 - too many years of moving to javascript
51:00 - whoa what's going on
51:02 - oh flickery flackery
51:04 - that's not 640x480 well i have a bug
51:07 - report can somebody please find me the
51:09 - um
51:11 - what would have been cvs
51:13 - subversion
51:14 - repository do i do i send my bug report
51:17 - by carrier pigeon how do i how do i get
51:20 - to 2001 ben fry
51:23 - this bug report of uh this not working
51:26 - all right let's try let's go back to
51:28 - could
51:29 - i just want to try let's try like
51:31 - the color scale like width is that one
51:33 - messed it up let's go back to color
51:35 - scale 100.
51:37 - oh my god i can't
51:38 - i've never typed so slow or move the
51:41 - mouse so slow in my life
51:44 - oh look at this
51:46 - we're getting some weird like yellow and
51:48 - stuff
51:49 - very interesting
51:51 - in dbn you could only use grayscale
51:53 - colors just being able to choose rgb
51:55 - colors and processing was mind-blowing
51:57 - thank you stig
52:01 - so let's go back now to uh
52:08 - all right let's let's try
52:09 - [Music]
52:11 - let's try some other stuff i i think i
52:12 - should quickly move on to like
52:15 - version like release like 68 or
52:17 - something which is only like six months
52:19 - later because there's
52:20 - you know background zero let's see does
52:22 - line work
52:24 - line zero zero
52:27 - uh 200 200
52:29 - let's see the stroke work look there's
52:31 - no it doesn't automatically indent
52:33 - where's my auto format ctrl t
52:36 - no
52:38 - oh i hit control r worked
52:40 - oh do you see that line
52:42 - oh the color scale is 100
52:44 - oh but background zero
52:47 - what
52:48 - i don't understand i don't understand
52:51 - i don't understand how to code and
52:53 - processing version one
52:57 - okay should we move on
52:58 - should we move on
53:02 - uh size oh is it size height width
53:04 - it seems like it might be
53:06 - look at that
53:07 - is its size
53:09 - was height first
53:11 - oh my god shocker scandalous
53:16 - okay do you guys hear that buzzing
53:18 - it's not the hummingbird that lives
53:20 - outside my window that loves its little
53:22 - hummingbird feeder
53:24 - it's like probably a large carpenter bee
53:28 - it's terrifying
53:30 - okay
53:31 - oh my god scary okay nope 300 200 now
53:34 - that worked 100 equals 255
53:38 - but why is background zero giving me
53:42 - let's just try like 10.
53:48 - i
53:50 - there we go
53:51 - whoa it's it's revert it's inverted
53:55 - right now i'm getting
53:56 - lower numbers to be white and higher
53:58 - numbers to be black
54:02 - amazing
54:03 - uh look at this look at this beautiful
54:05 - thing that we've done
54:08 - um so
54:09 - mark is saying lower the desktop
54:11 - resolution that is an excellent idea
54:16 - but hold on
54:19 - we're not done
54:20 - well i'm going to close this out let's
54:22 - go
54:23 - so i don't know if i should skip right
54:24 - ahead to um
54:26 - processing version oh i have three here
54:29 - let's try three i don't i didn't realize
54:31 - i had version three here i don't know
54:32 - what happened to version two let's try
54:34 - version three
54:36 - see what changed
54:38 - looks pretty similar
54:42 - so i don't see uh it's not obvious now i
54:45 - don't know if i have i don't think there
54:46 - were
54:48 - changes.txt files or anything like that
54:51 - that i could look at
54:52 - temporary so let's go okay so first of
54:54 - all
54:55 - let me get my thumb drive so this was
54:57 - also an adventure
55:00 - for a while i couldn't get any this
55:02 - laptop this thinkpad to recognize any
55:05 - thumb drive but let me copy um
55:08 - some more versions
55:10 - um so if you will
55:12 - uh bear with me for a second
55:15 - um
55:17 - oh you don't hear the music i forgot
55:20 - um i'm just going onto my
55:23 - mac laptop now
55:25 - obviously i should have done this in
55:26 - advance
55:27 - does anybody have a request of what
55:29 - version you would like to see
55:34 - i would copy them all
55:36 - let me i wonder if i can unzip files on
55:40 - the pc let's find that out i don't think
55:43 - so let me let me unzip oh let me unzip
55:45 - this bunch a bunch
55:47 - six seven you know i'm just going to do
55:48 - them all 8
55:50 - 9
55:51 - 11
55:52 - 12
55:54 - 13
55:55 - 14
55:56 - 15 here would you like to see what i'm
55:58 - doing
56:05 - so right now
56:08 - i've got my directory
56:11 - of all
56:14 - versions of processing
56:16 - and uh i am unzipping them because i'm
56:19 - not sure if my windows computer will do
56:21 - this i mean i'm not going to sit through
56:22 - and run every single one of these
56:25 - maybe there's some
56:27 - i guess i uh
56:33 - and i wish i could figure out how to get
56:35 - the dates of these
56:37 - oops whoa
56:40 - um here now you can probably
56:42 - there we go
56:46 - ah what's happening
56:51 - [Music]
56:58 - look at this you can see different
57:00 - versions from mac os 9 naso mac os 10
57:05 - sensibly zip
57:08 - [Music]
57:10 - let's see all right let's go to like 83
57:14 - [Music]
57:15 - 81 let's just go to some of these at the
57:17 - end here
57:19 - [Music]
57:24 - all right that's pretty good where is my
57:26 - thumb drive
57:29 - can't unplug any of these things okay
57:42 - the number of adapters
57:44 - that i've tried and had to use over
57:47 - okay there we go now
57:49 - let's see
57:51 - uh
57:52 - desktop
57:55 - this is four gig no problem
58:02 - [Music]
58:06 - and by the way i have over here uh which
58:08 - i um
58:11 - processing a version of one of you know
58:13 - eventually there was release 1.0
58:15 - um
58:17 - and uh so i want to run before i leave
58:19 - today 1.5 2.2 and 3.5 so a version of
58:24 - one two three and then for the grand
58:26 - finale
58:28 - we've got um processing
58:30 - um
58:33 - uh processing four uh all right i'm
58:35 - looking at the chat
58:37 - ah don't forget to stretch and drink
58:39 - some water yes
58:40 - okay wait wait wait wait wait
58:42 - as i'm copying this stuff wait how long
58:44 - is it gonna take
58:47 - 39 minutes
58:48 - what
58:50 - [Laughter]
58:51 - no
58:53 - you gotta be kidding me oh usb 2.0
58:58 - [Music]
58:59 - this is not good okay
59:01 - we're gonna pick and choose okay clearly
59:04 - i should have done this before today
59:07 - but you know you know how it is with me
59:09 - did i mention that i was moving
59:11 - [Music]
59:12 - the kids are making themselves breakfast
59:14 - this month's noon it should be lunch by
59:16 - now
59:17 - late schedule okay um hold on a sec
59:20 - let's be a little bit more strategic
59:21 - about this
59:25 - what should we do like prime numbers
59:28 - uh
59:29 - go by base two
59:32 - let's see
59:34 - um desktop processing alpha
59:37 - all right let's start here
59:40 - with uh
59:42 - version three let's look at some let's
59:44 - let's do these early ones
59:46 - five six
59:48 - seven eight
59:50 - nine eleven
59:51 - [Music]
59:57 - should be faster
59:58 - i think like there's a bunch of mac
60:01 - versions which are huge probably or
60:04 - let's go like now to um
60:07 - 16.
60:10 - [Music]
60:15 - 16
60:17 - 32
60:23 - 32
60:25 - [Music]
60:29 - 64.
60:31 - 68 i know is one that i used quite a bit
60:34 - [Music]
60:36 - and if you if we go back onto um
60:40 - wayback machine
60:41 - i believe oops
60:46 - what happened to 64.
60:48 - [Music]
60:52 - okay
60:54 - let's try 65.
60:57 - all right we're going to 65
60:59 - [Music]
61:05 - 68 i already have there
61:08 - 70
61:11 - let's grab some of the 80s well let's
61:13 - grab 84
61:15 - which is the most recent the the latest
61:18 - oldest one i have
61:21 - okay
61:25 - [Music]
61:29 - this shouldn't take i don't know why
61:31 - it's saying it's going to take so long
61:33 - all right while we're doing this
61:38 - while we are doing this
61:41 - um
61:44 - maybe i shouldn't have like set a bunch
61:45 - to go at once is that like kind of
61:47 - slowing it down while we're doing this
61:49 - let's go back to the wayback machine
61:51 - because i think it's interesting to look
61:52 - at the website you're gonna there's some
61:54 - really excellent um
61:56 - nuggets we're gonna find so i'm gonna go
61:58 - to um
62:02 - let's see
62:03 - i'm gonna go back to
62:05 - whoops
62:08 - here
62:09 - just uh
62:11 - so we're back to the wayback machine i'm
62:13 - going to now click ahead to may 2003 so
62:16 - we're getting close around then might
62:18 - have been when i
62:19 - first saw processing
62:21 - and look at this look at this beautiful
62:23 - website
62:25 - again
62:26 - this is the same website
62:29 - as this
62:31 - right
62:33 - this is sorry
62:35 - this this website is the same as i mean
62:39 - the current version of this so let's see
62:41 - what we can find so first of all we can
62:43 - find some early stuff
62:45 - so um
62:48 - so processing was used as a tool this is
62:50 - in may of 2001.
62:53 - wait how is that possible
62:57 - oh no this must be is this european
62:59 - dating like december 1st 2005 no
63:03 - or december 5th 2001 must be that right
63:06 - yeah because there's no month 14. okay
63:09 - european dating
63:12 - so december 5th 2001 processing was used
63:15 - as a tool for exploring the intersection
63:17 - of the physical and the virtual in nas
63:19 - 968 a course in computational media
63:22 - design talked by john maida at the mit
63:24 - media lab
63:25 - anybody in the chat
63:28 - at mit sitting in this course i would
63:30 - love to know what's the chance of that
63:32 - um
63:34 - okay december 14 2001 over the course of
63:38 - two evenings ambitious students at the
63:40 - interaction design institute evreya in
63:42 - italy took part in an exploratory
63:44 - processing workshop anybody here from
63:47 - the old days of the interaction design
63:49 - institute in ivraya
63:51 - please shout out in the chat
63:54 - january 12
63:56 - 2002 processing workshop at hyper work
63:59 - now what's the chance
64:02 - i'm just curious that any of these links
64:03 - work i mean they are going to
64:06 - uh way back machine we can see the
64:07 - interaction instant uh the interaction
64:09 - institute
64:11 - here is the hyperwork
64:14 - amazing to see
64:15 - i just love the wayback machine
64:18 - okay let's move on uh we could look at
64:20 - the examples reference info i'm curious
64:22 - about info actually that
64:24 - um
64:27 - so here's more about info and let's look
64:30 - at download
64:31 - out of curiosity here
64:34 - so right this is why
64:36 - uh most of these versions that i have
64:37 - you will not find ah angelo
64:40 - from ivrea yay
64:43 - uh
64:46 - um
64:47 - so the
64:48 - um
64:50 - so most i'm looking for where the first
64:53 - download is available so that's one of
64:54 - the things i'm trying to keep my eye out
64:56 - for how are my
64:58 - file copying going a minute 23 minutes
65:00 - three hours i think this will all speed
65:02 - up once these other ones finish
65:04 - probably should have done them more one
65:06 - at a time
65:07 - okay it's 12 10.
65:10 - uh liz and ivory that's great oh you
65:13 - heard the b okay
65:15 - um all right so let's go back to
65:18 - uh here
65:19 - i'm going to keep moving along here
65:22 - eventually we're gonna switch oh no
65:23 - eventually i need to switch to
65:25 - processing.org i don't know when that
65:27 - switch happened
65:29 - oh look this is so sad
65:31 - there's supposed to be like a java
65:32 - applet here
65:34 - um now we're going to september 2003
65:39 - maybe
65:42 - am i there already no i'm in june 2004
65:44 - start june 2002
65:47 - processing 1.0 alpha
65:51 - was it actually called 1.0 alpha at one
65:53 - point that's oh that's amazing
65:55 - um
65:58 - so you can see here the origins of both
66:00 - the mit media lab where ben frye was and
66:03 - the um working on his phd dissertation
66:06 - and the interaction design institute in
66:08 - ivrea where um
66:10 - casey was i believe
66:12 - um
66:14 - version oh os x interesting so i should
66:16 - be able to run some of these versions
66:19 - but i guess they're os x on powerpc
66:23 - there was a two day parisian workshop in
66:25 - 2002
66:28 - posters exploring genomic cartography
66:31 - exhibit in london i just love seeing the
66:34 - track of all these the list of all these
66:36 - happenings ah now we're getting good we
66:38 - can see a bunch of these early examples
66:41 - so these are early examples which we
66:43 - should be able to run on these early
66:45 - versions of processing
66:47 - you can see look at this
66:49 - example's forthcoming oh
66:53 - oh beautiful i'd love to see all this
66:54 - future categories or include
66:57 - uh did all this come to to fruition
66:59 - artificial life information
67:01 - visualization emergent systems adaptive
67:03 - interface sound synthesis anybody ever
67:05 - use sonia a really early sound library
67:08 - by amit pataru
67:10 - that's a great one that i think we'll
67:12 - see appearing
67:13 - getting started nope okay so i think
67:17 - this must be where i can move to
67:19 - processing.org
67:22 - let's go back
67:24 - because i think i'll get better traction
67:27 - if i look for processing.org at a
67:29 - certain point
67:30 - um and let's go back we were in like
67:33 - 2003.
67:36 - maybe let's try 2004.
67:43 - yeah here we go look at this now we're
67:45 - starting to see the exhibition
67:47 - so let's look at the early stuff in the
67:49 - exhibition
67:51 - oh i want to look at these essays
67:56 - so this is really beautiful to see some
67:59 - of these early projects by names you may
68:01 - or not may not recognize
68:03 - um oh i love i remember this by julia
68:05 - stunnat this bees project is really
68:07 - beautiful
68:08 - view source
68:11 - no that's sad so most of these probably
68:14 - won't oh moovel i remember jared tarble
68:16 - a real pioneer in generative art
68:19 - um
68:22 - so and you can see here um there's all
68:24 - these uh the exhibitions all of these
68:27 - projects
68:28 - um listed here let's go to download are
68:31 - we do we have download yet
68:34 - yes oh we're on version 87 already so
68:37 - this is where if you want to try running
68:40 - one of these you know good luck to you
68:42 - if you're going to try to download the
68:43 - mac os x version i mean uh may 2005 i
68:48 - assume there's no way this is going to
68:49 - work for me but usually like oh yeah
68:50 - it's a stuff it file but um you
68:54 - i i definitely if i go back you'll find
68:56 - version 68 was here
68:58 - um but we can keep going here i guess
69:00 - we're in 2005 now oh we're in beta
69:03 - processing's in beta you can start to
69:05 - see the design of the website changing
69:07 - sign up for an email list
69:11 - let me get also
69:13 - let me find let me just i'm just moving
69:15 - to this for a second because i'm going
69:17 - to find the code for the new processing
69:19 - logo
69:21 - which i have in discord
69:25 - i think if i go into the live chat
69:33 - alco where did you send that to me
69:37 - scrolling scrolling ah got it okay
69:40 - um so i have the
69:42 - um
69:45 - live chat i'm sorry i have the uh the
69:48 - code for the logo right now
69:52 - let's just see first of all while we're
69:53 - here
69:54 - let's see if this runs in processing
69:56 - version 1.5
69:59 - uh which i would love somebody to like
70:00 - look up and oh
70:02 - okay no no no no problem
70:06 - i i
70:07 - where i was running this earlier that's
70:09 - so weird um
70:12 - open
70:14 - i could have sworn i was running this
70:20 - okay
70:23 - no
70:24 - fail see this is the bra i could have
70:25 - sworn i was running this one earlier on
70:28 - this mac maybe it was on a old different
70:29 - mac of mine all right let's go to uh
70:32 - let's go to processing two let's see if
70:34 - we can get uh and i'm probably gonna
70:35 - have the same thing let's open
70:37 - let's see if we can get processing too
70:38 - oh yay processing two runs on my modern
70:41 - mac
70:42 - uh let's just see if the logo works in
70:45 - this version processing doesn't look too
70:47 - different probably from what you see now
70:50 - and yes there we go we have got so we
70:52 - know for a fact that the processing logo
70:56 - will appear as written in code in
70:58 - version two i'm not sure why 1.5 is not
71:01 - running for me right now so let me get
71:04 - this let me just make a little text file
71:08 - um
71:10 - boy i had so many ambitions of doing so
71:12 - much more today than i thought it was
71:13 - going to do
71:15 - let me save this onto the thumb drive as
71:18 - logo.txt
71:24 - and uh let me save that onto the thumb
71:28 - drive
71:30 - save
71:34 - and let's see how's my copying going
71:39 - about a minute about an hour oh what
71:41 - have i done
71:45 - everybody stretch
71:49 - this like
71:50 - alan writes this is like looking at baby
71:53 - pictures of a friend
71:55 - uh on their birthday
71:57 - yeah and the grim says are you running
71:59 - catalina is p1 a 32-bit app maybe
72:02 - incompatible with the strictly 64-bit
72:04 - yeah
72:07 - come on old versions
72:12 - i did not anticipate this slow copying
72:15 - why is it so slow
72:20 - all right hold on i'm going to
72:22 - uh take some more drastic action here
72:27 - or should i should i should i i should
72:28 - exercise some patience all right let's
72:31 - let's take a look while this is copying
72:32 - let's take a look at processing four
72:35 - because i can definitely do this
72:45 - [Music]
72:46 - all right processing for everything we
72:48 - always wanted in wait it says rustic
72:51 - 3.5.4 at the top
72:54 - how do i know if this is really oh
72:55 - because i have that open
72:57 - oh you know what
72:59 - this was not processing too
73:01 - what is going on okay hold on
73:06 - don't save did i had processing open
73:08 - already
73:12 - there we go
73:14 - i knew that was like not processing
73:17 - two now we've got processing two
73:20 - sorry about that false alarm and and and
73:23 - i was getting that correctly from the
73:25 - chat was telling me
73:27 - yeah so i should definitely try copying
73:29 - the zips instead can i i must be able to
73:32 - let me check on my windows machine
73:35 - i must be able to extract a zip file
73:38 - right
73:40 - i don't have one we're about to find out
73:42 - i'm going to let this
73:44 - yeah let's let's take
73:48 - let's cancel this one cancel this one
73:52 - these should really be done super fast
73:54 - uh all right we're now gonna try
73:58 - running the processing new logo on
74:03 - processing version two this is 2.2.1
74:08 - let's see
74:13 - all right we know that it works
74:16 - on version two
74:19 - uh windows file explorer should be able
74:21 - to open zips natively all right so i i
74:24 - should be less
74:26 - uh precious i should everyone's telling
74:28 - me
74:30 - close out come on cancel
74:33 - cancel
74:34 - cancel
74:35 - these are so close
74:37 - i don't want to cancel all of them
74:39 - stopping come on stop
74:45 - i mean what's taking so long here people
74:50 - 21 items 20.
74:53 - [Music]
74:57 - i just want to let this finish because
74:59 - it's so close
75:04 - so
75:07 - zip should be findable for windows 2000
75:09 - windows file explorer should be open to
75:10 - zips natively all right everyone's
75:12 - telling me this but i cannot stop
75:14 - i just have like a minute left of these
75:16 - then i'll go and get zips
75:20 - um all right so let's move back over to
75:25 - let's look at version 68.
75:28 - let's move back over to the other
75:30 - machine
75:39 - okay
75:41 - here we go
75:43 - all right i'm on
75:44 - uh so let's try something here let's try
75:46 - to make this bigger for people
75:49 - and i do have kind of like i do have to
75:51 - finish by
75:53 - oh i'm okay
75:55 - ideally 12 30 but
75:57 - somehow i don't think that's going to
75:58 - happen
75:59 - uh control panel display oh it's so hot
76:04 - can you guys hear like the i think it's
76:06 - the cicadas
76:09 - do you guys hear that
76:11 - um i'm basically outdoors
76:16 - uh
76:16 - and eventually i'll have a setup where
76:18 - you can sort of see the outdoors i have
76:19 - a plan but
76:21 - um okay settings
76:23 - uh let's go to let's try 800x600
76:26 - okay
76:28 - no signal
76:33 - oh oh obs but i can enlarge this in obs
76:37 - so just give me a second here
76:40 - uh
76:41 - where am i
76:43 - where am i
76:44 - oh no
76:45 - what happened
76:49 - oh it went back because i didn't click
76:50 - okay
76:52 - should i go to 640 by 480 that should be
76:54 - fine
76:58 - let's hit yes
76:59 - okay now
77:01 - this should make it easier for it to see
77:05 - now how do i do this
77:07 - [Music]
77:09 - laptop
77:13 - that's the laptop
77:15 - unlock
77:18 - put it in the corner here like there
77:21 - and then make it big
77:25 - this is going to totally mess it up when
77:26 - i go back to
77:28 - my mac but
77:31 - too big
77:38 - this should help everybody see it oh it
77:40 - finished copying
77:42 - it's got a little sound effect in my ear
77:44 - okay
77:45 - okay this should be good oh it's like a
77:48 - little bit smaller so you can
77:52 - just want to get the whole thing on
77:53 - screen okay great
77:55 - so now we've got um
77:58 - this much bigger it's 640 by 480 oh my
78:01 - god this is gonna be so hard to use
78:05 - let me
78:07 - get
78:08 - my thumb drive which finished copying
78:11 - let me get um
78:13 - i'm just gonna copy some
78:16 - zip files also
78:17 - like arbitrarily i'm arbitrarily picking
78:20 - like
78:22 - um
78:24 - 52
78:26 - uh now i'm just like picking random ones
78:28 - i only had like some kind of random
78:30 - number generator at my disposal
78:34 - i'm just copying a few more
78:38 - because why not estimated time remaining
78:44 - estimated time remaining
78:47 - it won't tell me
78:49 - but it's already a quarter of the way
78:51 - through
79:00 - oh you can't hear the music i always
79:01 - forget
79:03 - i could play it out through the speakers
79:05 - then the microphone would catch it
79:06 - alright i'm almost there everybody we're
79:08 - almost there let's look at processing
79:09 - 68.
79:12 - so look at this we've got oh there's fun
79:14 - things to see here because we've got
79:15 - little bits of source code we can start
79:17 - first of all let's look at oh this is my
79:18 - favorite thing ever so let's look at the
79:20 - readme
79:24 - come on open up read me
79:26 - okay
79:31 - by the way i always said
79:33 - if there was a pulitzer prize a pulitzer
79:35 - prize given out for code comments
79:37 - release notes
79:39 - ben frye should win this prize
79:43 - okay
79:45 - release notes and developer soapbox
79:47 - herein follows lots of random notes
79:49 - about the alpha release hold on
79:54 - the alpha release of processing more
79:56 - up-to-date details can be found in
79:58 - revisions.txt and if you think i'm not
80:00 - going to read to you revisions.txt
80:02 - you're wrong i'm reading that which has
80:04 - notes about individual releases
80:07 - um you'll have to pardon the chatty
80:09 - detail in some spots as this will also
80:12 - serve as a response to many of the
80:13 - frequently asked questions that we have
80:17 - getting started
80:18 - double-click the processing application
80:20 - select something from the examples menu
80:22 - file open examples
80:24 - hit the run button which looks like the
80:26 - play button on a vcr or a tape deck
80:31 - lather rinse repeat as necessary
80:34 - thanks to the many people who have been
80:36 - helping us out it's huge i'll get a nice
80:38 - long list of y'all in here soon
80:41 - at least until the final 1.0 version
80:44 - which
80:45 - if someone could get me the date of that
80:51 - i would love to hear it
80:53 - we'll be using four digit numbers for
80:55 - the release this is why they're calling
80:57 - revision0043
80:59 - the first alpha so 0 0 4 3 is the first
81:02 - alpha so that's one i should definitely
81:04 - look at
81:05 - i'm copying that one i think i actually
81:08 - did that one coincidentally yeah i did
81:10 - that one that one is on the thumb drive
81:11 - so let's remember to look at that
81:14 - there will be a few more numbered
81:15 - releases leading up to a beta release
81:18 - uh i found a bug
81:20 - a cultured software elite such as
81:22 - yourself should use the gentleman's term
81:24 - issue
81:26 - okay this was a different time first be
81:28 - sure to check under the notes for your
81:30 - specific platform to make sure it isn't
81:31 - a known issue or that there isn't a
81:33 - simple fix look at this note avoid the
81:36 - urge to just email us at processing
81:39 - media.mit.edu
81:41 - okay
81:42 - does that oh casey reese in the chat
81:47 - hi casey
81:48 - um
81:49 - all right
81:50 - well will that go where will that go now
81:52 - somebody now actually maybe don't maybe
81:54 - don't let's see does that email casey's
81:56 - in the chat if we send an email does it
81:58 - go there
81:59 - um
82:01 - while you may prefer the privacy of an
82:03 - email it's much quicker for you to ask
82:04 - the whole gang who are super helpful
82:07 - so this is
82:08 - 1.0 is january 17th 2004. thank you
82:11 - jonathan sims
82:13 - appreciate that
82:15 - um
82:16 - wow in my mind 1.0 was like 2009.
82:19 - but i'm just like it seems so much
82:22 - okay all right i can read it from here
82:24 - uh where was i next check the b board
82:26 - the b board
82:27 - there was a b board a bulletin board
82:30 - it's just the discourse our best math is
82:32 - opposed to the bulletin board the
82:34 - bulletin board
82:38 - at processing.org discourse we prefer
82:40 - for you to use the b board
82:42 - b board for bugs since we like to use
82:45 - the b board as a way to track bugs casey
82:47 - and ben can't always respond quickly to
82:49 - email
82:50 - you know who's also terrible responding
82:52 - quickly to the email
82:53 - thank you
82:54 - acting
82:55 - um
82:56 - and there are several knowledgeable
82:57 - people on the b board if you want to go
82:59 - straight to the bugs page it's
83:01 - oh my god i really want to go straight
83:03 - to that page
83:04 - i really want to go straight at that
83:05 - page i don't think it will work we can
83:06 - find out the way back between we're
83:07 - reporting this bug please include
83:09 - information about what the revision
83:10 - number operating system this this all
83:12 - still applies
83:14 - details are the error which may be the
83:15 - last few lines from the files
83:17 - standardout.txt
83:19 - or standarderror.txt from the lib folder
83:22 - stranger errors you may also look inside
83:24 - the build folder which is an
83:26 - intermediate translated to java version
83:28 - of your code i have so much to say about
83:30 - all of this
83:32 - this by the way i'm now realizing i've
83:34 - got this this could be like you know
83:36 - 100 hours of live streaming content just
83:38 - going through all of this stuff we want
83:40 - the minimum amount of code that will
83:41 - still replicate the bug so by the way
83:43 - this is all still really good advice
83:46 - like
83:48 - basically like all of this still applies
83:51 - uh to filing a github issue in today's
83:53 - modern times
83:54 - occasionally we may need you to pack up
83:56 - a copy pack up a copy of your sketchbook
83:58 - hold on i'm gonna pack up get my bag
84:01 - over here gonna gather all my papers and
84:04 - print out my code and pack it up into my
84:06 - bag and bring it somewhere
84:08 - um
84:09 - to replicate the weirdness on our own
84:11 - machine like right you couldn't just
84:13 - like what did you do you had to pack it
84:15 - up in like a zip file and could you even
84:17 - email that as an attachment would you
84:19 - mail a what were those things called
84:21 - those
84:23 - those are zip drives actually those are
84:25 - called um
84:26 - rest assured we have no interest in
84:28 - messages especially with your own fancy
84:30 - creations or stealing your ideas
84:33 - the p5 team is a bear but this is really
84:36 - from a different era straight lays boys
84:38 - who help from the midwestern us who are
84:40 - brought up better than that as we often
84:41 - lack enough time to build our own
84:43 - projects
84:44 - the the nuggets that are in these old
84:46 - readmes are just amazing goodies and
84:49 - semi-hidden features shift-click on the
84:51 - run button to go straight to present
84:52 - mode
84:54 - for quick renaming just click on the
84:56 - sketch title
84:58 - the processing belmont runs best on
85:00 - windows 2000
85:02 - that's right people
85:04 - windows 2000
85:08 - windows is the superior platform for
85:09 - running java applications it's not
85:11 - because we like windows the best sorry
85:13 - to the zealots and all other courses
85:14 - like can you believe what's in there
85:16 - this is like a treasure trove of like
85:18 - pros poetic pros
85:21 - uh we all think osx will be a great bet
85:23 - for the future and apple's putting all
85:24 - their people weight behind it yeah how's
85:26 - that how's that working out for
85:27 - everybody so hopefully it will evolve
85:29 - somewhere
85:30 - developing the version for mac os 9 is a
85:31 - big headache but we think lots of people
85:33 - still use the crusty operating system
85:36 - the guess is that a lot of schools are
85:37 - still using in their labs and since
85:39 - schools are a significant target for the
85:40 - environment you got to play along
85:43 - windows 9598 emmy is a piece of crap
85:47 - but since lots of people are often
85:49 - forced to use it we'll try and support
85:51 - for the linux version you can support
85:53 - yourselves
85:55 - if you're enough of that boy
85:56 - [Music]
85:58 - this is like
85:59 - unbelievable
86:01 - uh
86:02 - minimum requirements processing requires
86:04 - at least mac os 10.1
86:08 - i got to get some other old computers
86:09 - going
86:10 - but i could just read through all of
86:11 - these
86:12 - uh mac os 9 we've temporary services
86:14 - development for mac os 9 because we
86:16 - don't have time to fight with this dios
86:17 - before beta
86:20 - windows win2k and winxp
86:23 - ah yes this is interesting i remember
86:25 - this the release is now split between
86:27 - standard and expert versions because it
86:29 - comes with a working java virtual
86:31 - machine
86:33 - um
86:33 - but you could get the expert if you
86:35 - don't want to deal if you don't want to
86:36 - deal with the 20 megabyte download right
86:38 - oh my goodness the 20 megabyte download
86:41 - oh i'm going to go carry that over here
86:44 - 20 megabytes oh my god it's so much how
86:46 - i ever fit that onto my
86:49 - megabyte zip cartridge
86:55 - mouse issues by default windows seems to
86:57 - skip every other pixel on screen oh
86:59 - that's that's glorious
87:02 - video input oh my god who remembers this
87:05 - who remembers this this was like the
87:07 - bane of my existence for so long
87:10 - vdig.com win v dig oh my god v dig win v
87:14 - dick i used to have like
87:16 - flop usb drives or floppy drives or zip
87:19 - drives was like every version of windy
87:21 - dig and every version of quicktime on it
87:23 - to like get stuff to work
87:25 - uh
87:26 - all right all right i can't read all
87:28 - this it's just too great ah let's look
87:29 - at this this is good
87:32 - what is sketchbook
87:34 - so this i think also is i don't remember
87:37 - what design by numbers called a
87:40 - sketch for lack of a better term if it
87:41 - was called a sketch and design by
87:42 - numbers but to me this is also i think a
87:44 - really important um
87:47 - uh
87:48 - historical i don't want to say footnote
87:50 - it's not a footnote it's like a
87:51 - momentous thing to like
87:54 - to see this first naming of the idea of
87:56 - sketching with code and again i'm sure
87:58 - it was used prior to processing but
88:00 - definitely an early this early idea of a
88:03 - sketchbook integrated development
88:04 - environment so microsoft visual studio
88:07 - code world code warrior j builder those
88:10 - were the ides of the time tend to be
88:12 - overkill for the type of audience we're
88:14 - targeting with processing this is such a
88:17 - major thing for me for me i just
88:18 - remember i was working in visual studio
88:21 - code i was working in macromedia
88:23 - director which has its wonderful
88:25 - qualities but these are big bloated
88:27 - environments for this reason we've
88:28 - introduced the sketchbook which is a
88:31 - more lightweight way to organize
88:32 - projects as trained designers we'd like
88:34 - the process of coding to be a lot more
88:36 - like sketching look at this it's right
88:38 - there it's all there the sketchbook and
88:40 - the history menu under sketch are
88:42 - attempts in that direction why java oh
88:45 - this is going to be good
88:48 - i wish i could play my music this really
88:50 - needs like my sound effects and music
88:52 - it's fine
88:53 - the power of my voice will carry forward
88:59 - we didn't set out to make the ultimate
89:01 - language for visual programming we set
89:03 - out to make something that was a
89:05 - sketchbook for our own work simplifying
89:07 - the majority of tasks that we undertake
89:10 - a teaching environment for that kind of
89:11 - process and a point of transition to a
89:14 - more complicated or difficult language
89:16 - like full-blown java or c-plus plus
89:20 - at the intersection of these points is a
89:22 - trade-off between speed and simplicity
89:24 - of use if we didn't care about speed
89:26 - python or other scripting languages
89:28 - would make far more sense if we didn't
89:30 - care about transition to more advanced
89:32 - languages we'd get rid of the crummy c
89:34 - style well algol really syntax
89:36 - processing is not intended as the
89:38 - ultimate environment language in fact
89:40 - the language is just java but without
89:43 - another graphics api but with another
89:46 - graphics api and some simplifications
89:48 - it's just putting together several years
89:50 - of experience in building things and
89:52 - trying to simplify the parts that should
89:54 - be easier now i also believe i'm i'm
89:57 - missing
89:58 - um
90:00 - i'm missing another historical precedent
90:04 - to processing and i was not part of the
90:06 - mit media lab i was not there so i have
90:08 - no idea what i'm talking about but i
90:10 - believe there was an in-house c plus
90:13 - plus
90:14 - um
90:16 - creative coding kind of package or
90:17 - library it had a name to it that was
90:20 - also kind of being developed and used at
90:22 - the time
90:24 - um
90:24 - [Music]
90:26 - and maybe that is one of the um
90:28 - the what's the word i'm looking for the
90:30 - the
90:31 - not pre the
90:32 - something that precedes open frameworks
90:34 - perhaps
90:35 - external files fonts reading data files
90:38 - why is it called processing
90:40 - at their core computers are processing
90:43 - machines they modify move and combine
90:45 - symbols at a low level to construct
90:47 - higher level representations processing
90:50 - allows people to control these actions
90:52 - and representations through writing
90:53 - their own programs the project also
90:55 - focuses on the process the process of
90:58 - creation rather than end results oh my
91:00 - god to me i mean it's like it sounds
91:03 - corny the journey it's not it's the
91:05 - journey not the end but this has been so
91:07 - true for me in everything that i do i
91:10 - never know where i'm going with coding
91:11 - an example or a tutorial or trying out
91:14 - an idea it always ends up somewhere
91:16 - different that process is so vital to
91:19 - the methodology the ethos the community
91:21 - spirit of uh the processing community
91:24 - and creative coding
91:26 - processing process of fiving is the
91:27 - spelling we formally use for the url
91:29 - processing.net being unavailable and
91:31 - while it's a combination of numbers and
91:32 - letters but it's simply pronounced
91:33 - processing you might also see p5 use the
91:35 - shorthand
91:37 - uh version of the name
91:38 - free to download free to use source code
91:41 - i mean i kind of want to read all this
91:42 - but
91:43 - let's get to
91:45 - let's get to the good stuff
91:47 - so
91:48 - let's check my thumb drive
91:52 - let's uh
91:55 - okay so we're about to
91:58 - um
92:01 - um i am about to eject it i ejected it
92:05 - done drive
92:06 - this is what i'm using
92:08 - uh works with that um i had to order
92:10 - this off of the internet because like
92:12 - none of my like
92:14 - this is my i don't know if you can see
92:15 - this can't see it the lighting is no
92:17 - good up here and my
92:19 - other camera my roving camera is not
92:21 - working
92:22 - i'm gonna plug this in
92:28 - okay
92:30 - okay welcome thank you for joining back
92:32 - as a member i have sort of
92:34 - um
92:36 - you know today i'm asking people to
92:37 - donate to the processing foundation so
92:39 - i'm not really going to plug the coding
92:40 - terrain membership but i thank uk
92:43 - um all right oh let's look okay i can't
92:45 - resist bugs
92:50 - uh this is this is like some fun stuff
92:52 - to read also it doesn't have line breaks
92:55 - in it revisions.txt i should look at
92:57 - that all right let's take a look
92:59 - at um
93:02 - where are we
93:03 - my computer removable disk d
93:08 - come on
93:10 - wake up thumb drive
93:12 - oh please work
93:17 - oh joseph has already made a processing
93:19 - name variation generator i've got to
93:22 - take a look at that
93:23 - okay
93:25 - so 43 did i extract that one no i did
93:28 - not so let's um
93:31 - i have so little space to work with in
93:33 - 640
93:35 - by 480 43.
93:38 - let's try copying that to the desktop
93:42 - i mean this is giving me such like
93:44 - nostalgia this little like a copying bar
93:50 - i know i should be reading revisions.txt
93:53 - how am i going to read all of this i
93:54 - gotta my children need me to take care
93:56 - of them
93:58 - they're so everybody should send them
94:00 - like a cupcake or something oh oh my god
94:02 - my phone went off
94:05 - hopefully there's no so my emergency i
94:07 - mean they could walk out and find me
94:10 - uh they know where i am okay so let's
94:11 - right click on this we think that this
94:13 - is going to be able to extract extract
94:15 - files here
94:17 - oh i'm so silly
94:19 - all along this of course this works
94:22 - all right so this from what i understand
94:24 - based on the uh release notes
94:28 - this version um
94:30 - which is 68 no
94:33 - 43 that's three this version 43
94:36 - is what is considered the first alpha
94:39 - release maybe i can't remember what it
94:41 - said i was reading those notes and my
94:43 - brain has melted
94:45 - um so let's run this now
94:48 - but hold on before we do that
94:50 - can i get another like finder window
94:53 - open this is so hard to use
94:55 - my documents no i don't want to go to my
94:58 - documents
95:00 - i want to get the i mean
95:02 - there's no way
95:04 - the logo
95:06 - uh works
95:07 - in processing 43 but by golly we're
95:10 - going to try
95:11 - oh my goodness like weird line break
95:13 - issues between different file formats
95:16 - okay so now we're gonna run processing
95:17 - 43
95:21 - okay ah so news new we have a logo in
95:25 - the top left the p5 logo do we have a
95:28 - sketchbook
95:29 - there's no examples yet
95:32 - no no sketchbook no examples we do have
95:34 - a serial port
95:36 - option that is pretty exciting
95:39 - um
95:42 - right
95:43 - uh
95:44 - hold on important messages breaking news
95:47 - might be coming in
95:51 - i may have received messages
95:53 - yeah no kidding
95:56 - no kidding signal
96:02 - what is happening now
96:06 - why is my phone talking to me clubhouse
96:08 - open what
96:10 - hey hold on
96:13 - uh i'm getting breaking news
96:16 - breaking news on my phone i think
96:22 - uh processing 20 okay great great thank
96:24 - you i'm going to show this thank you
96:26 - okay um
96:27 - hold on
96:29 - uh all right so wait
96:31 - so let's see what's the chance
96:37 - oh gosh oh so painful
96:44 - that's right it's not that the code's
96:45 - not that long
96:50 - this is like a really fruitless endeavor
96:52 - but i'm doing it you can't stop me
96:55 - i mean
97:00 - there's something about these kind of
97:01 - like weird tedious tasks that i really
97:04 - enjoy mean i'm assuming these line
97:07 - breaks will be errors but or is it just
97:09 - me who can't stand to look at it
97:13 - it's not that many lines of code
97:16 - bezier i somehow i doubt bezier is going
97:18 - to work we're about to find out
97:26 - and probably do some kind of find and
97:28 - replace
97:33 - i'm almost there people no no don't
97:35 - delete
97:37 - enter
97:38 - oh no what did i do
97:43 - oh my god help me everybody
97:47 - don't
97:50 - no
97:51 - why is that not working
97:54 - it won't put a line break there
97:57 - okay
98:04 - oh because
98:06 - let's do this
98:09 - okay
98:12 - this is very silly what i'm doing
98:14 - because i don't know if i'll be able to
98:16 - save this but i should be able to copy
98:17 - paste it
98:20 - back into my text file
98:28 - hi everybody
98:29 - are you still watching
98:32 - i have no music to play no sound effects
98:38 - wait what is going on oh that's a for
98:41 - loop okay
98:44 - oh this is drawing the grid
98:46 - okay we're almost there people
99:00 - where's my auto format
99:02 - ctrl t
99:05 - ctrl s oh it saved it
99:08 - okay
99:09 - hold on we've got some weird oh yeah
99:10 - size
99:13 - void draw
99:15 - now let's look at this code what is the
99:17 - chance
99:18 - that this is going to run of course you
99:20 - know me
99:21 - i cannot tolerate code that's not
99:23 - indented properly
99:25 - i love the no syntax highlighting
99:28 - classic classic processing
99:32 - okay actually i think i'm
99:33 - this oh wait i'm missing a closed curly
99:36 - bracket here it looks like right
99:39 - and then
99:43 - i guess i could have gotten rid of the
99:44 - draw grid
99:47 - this is very important to me i must do
99:49 - this
99:51 - i will not be able to sleep tonight
99:54 - oh it is so hot
100:01 - okay everybody
100:02 - it's time
100:04 - we're going to attempt to draw
100:07 - oh and it was loop so
100:10 - uh you know i'd rather see the error but
100:12 - let's just change it to loop
100:15 - thank you for that that was tito in the
100:17 - chat
100:21 - um and hit save again so this is saved
100:23 - now we're gonna hit run everybody okay
100:25 - everyone
100:28 - everybody stretch take a deep breath
100:31 - we're gonna hit run we're gonna get
100:33 - errors we're gonna work it out
100:36 - stroke weight
100:38 - all right doesn't appear to be a method
100:40 - called stroke weight
100:42 - do comments work i can't tell they've
100:44 - got to work right that's a
100:46 - stroke weight okay
100:48 - no stroke weight in version 43. how did
100:51 - you how did anybody live no stroke cap
100:55 - okay that's fine
100:58 - where is it it's running
101:00 - is it behind the window
101:02 - no
101:06 - where are you
101:10 - wait a sec
101:14 - i think it didn't get too
101:19 - all right hold on a second everybody
101:21 - we're gonna have to debug this
101:24 - without stroke weight it won't work why
101:26 - not
101:29 - but i should at least see a window
101:31 - all right let's
101:36 - let's get something
101:38 - to appear
101:40 - background
101:42 - 255
101:43 - let's make it red
101:54 - i cannot manifest it i see like a little
101:57 - window popping up let's see i sort of
101:59 - feel like
102:00 - all right hold on let's let's do this
102:04 - like is it behind it is it not fitting
102:06 - on the screen like this 640 by 480 thing
102:08 - is really messing me up
102:10 - so i think i might need to go at least
102:12 - 800 by 600
102:16 - right
102:17 - oh the fan is worrying
102:22 - anybody have any ideas
102:28 - color scale might mess it up but i don't
102:30 - know i call in color scale
102:34 - how come i'm not getting a window
102:36 - 600 by 600 not possible
102:40 - oh yeah because the weakling
102:42 - 600 by 600 won't even fit on the
102:46 - no that didn't do anything
102:49 - all right what pro what was the address
102:51 - again
102:52 - sitting at me oh the bulletin board i
102:54 - could go report my bug to the bulletin
102:56 - board
102:57 - yeah
102:59 - windows key plus m to minimize all
103:02 - there's no windows key i don't have a
103:04 - what kind of computer do you think i'm
103:06 - on there's no windows key
103:11 - change size i changed the size you guys
103:13 - are a little bit behind me here all
103:14 - right
103:17 - all that effort
103:19 - um let's go to
103:22 - save sketch yes
103:24 - let's go to 68.
103:27 - we're going to go to 68 which i have
103:29 - used
103:30 - jikes bugs
103:35 - getting more messages
103:39 - um
103:40 - okay
103:41 - come on processing 68 okay
103:45 - so let's just first of all see if i get
103:47 - a window
103:51 - oh is it oh there it is look i got a
103:53 - window i got a sketch window i got a
103:56 - sketch window yay first sketch window
103:59 - all right now
104:01 - uh let's go back to
104:04 - oh how do i open is there a sketchbook
104:07 - yeah oh add file show sketch folder
104:10 - history
104:12 - use external editor look at all this
104:14 - stuff create font add file so much now
104:16 - present stop stop no no auto format i
104:20 - need my auto format
104:22 - oh was there a bug
104:24 - and maybe i wasn't getting an oh
104:26 - maybe i had a bug okay hold on
104:29 - don't worry here's
104:31 - the code now let's try running this and
104:33 - see what happens
104:37 - okay stroke cap
104:40 - square kill let's take this off
104:43 - comment this out
104:46 - look at
104:46 - this look at this everybody oh
104:52 - this is the processing logo
104:54 - running on
104:56 - um
104:57 - wow
105:01 - wow syntax highlighting too wow 68 is
105:04 - like a major new it's a whole new world
105:08 - so we can see the syntax highlighting
105:10 - happened
105:11 - um stroke weight is there bezier works
105:14 - all this stuff works
105:17 - so what was i going to do i was going to
105:19 - attempt to code
105:21 - do i do it edit edit beautify beautify
105:24 - control b
105:26 - beautify
105:27 - beautify is here ah amazing
105:32 - oh this is so amazing okay
105:35 - so let's go to 800 by 600
105:37 - if you will all
105:40 - uh indulge me here in
105:43 - let's go to 800 by 600 so that
105:45 - we can see a bit more on screen i think
105:47 - you'll still be able to read the font
105:50 - um let's go to 800 by 600
105:55 - i don't want the wallpaper no
105:58 - i guess i clicked on some wallpaper
106:00 - accent yes
106:06 - okay so here we are in version 68
106:11 - and this is what we see now
106:14 - can we kind of
106:17 - what's
106:18 - i want to look at the logo i wish i had
106:21 - yeah so um so i have so much my mind is
106:24 - like exploding here um
106:28 - so let's see if stroke cap
106:31 - but it's like not does stroke cap a
106:33 - function do we have help
106:36 - reference
106:38 - come on come on open in the browser you
106:40 - can do it i remember processing used to
106:42 - come with a local copy of the reference
106:46 - but
106:47 - ah look at this
106:50 - 1.0 alpha
106:52 - this is the reference
106:54 - stroke weight
106:58 - stroke
107:00 - no stroke cap
107:03 - so i bet you i could get that same
107:05 - effect with just like an arc probably
107:08 - um
107:09 - like which is that the bezier curve
107:17 - yeah
107:18 - like and what's you oh is that the like
107:20 - is that a scaling factor
107:23 - like if i make this six
107:26 - oh there we go
107:28 - this is another way to let's it was 60
107:31 - is that what it was
107:32 - i don't even remember now undo does undo
107:35 - work
107:37 - yeah so let's make that half
107:41 - 30
107:42 - and make it 300 by 300.
107:45 - oh oh you're you're seeing it but it's
107:48 - um
107:50 - let me
107:52 - just bear with me for a second here
107:55 - let me allow you to see more of the
107:56 - computer
108:03 - there we go
108:04 - so sorry the font is so slow low small
108:10 - um but now
108:12 - let's run it
108:14 - okay
108:18 - early days of processing this is
108:20 - processing version 68.
108:24 - so the only thing that's not working for
108:27 - this new logo design is the is it's not
108:30 - the bezier curve the bezier curve works
108:33 - it's the uh
108:35 - stroke cap
108:38 - so
108:39 - let's put the bezier curve
108:41 - back
108:44 - and we can see that
108:47 - the curve with this thick stroke weight
108:51 - is like not joining the caps of it
108:54 - somehow properly with squares
108:57 - i'm just curious to try
109:00 - arc well let's just try is ellipse even
109:02 - a function
109:05 - in this version
109:08 - four times u
109:12 - one is that a 1 times u
109:16 - 5 times u
109:18 - 5 times u i don't know what i'm doing
109:20 - here
109:23 - okay
109:27 - ellipse works
109:28 - so in theory
109:30 - i could do
109:33 - an arc how could i get this without
109:34 - stroke cap
109:38 - an arc
109:39 - which goes from like negative pi divided
109:42 - by two to pi divided by two
109:45 - that would be similar ooh
109:48 - no method named arc
109:50 - no arc function
109:58 - i'm just curious what if we like used
110:00 - a smaller stroke weight just like four
110:04 - did it not seem so oh and had the bezier
110:07 - instead
110:11 - there we go
110:13 - this is my version of the new processing
110:15 - logo
110:20 - sorry put the stroke cap back yes oh no
110:23 - that's an old message is it one o'clock
110:25 - yet
110:26 - oh my god it's almost one o'clock i
110:27 - can't believe i've been doing this for
110:28 - two hours and this is all i've gotten to
110:31 - all right let's look at some more
110:33 - uh let's let's kind of scan through some
110:35 - more later versions of processing um and
110:38 - i'm just going to encourage you to make
110:39 - your own cake i'll get you started with
110:41 - it i'm going to i'm going to sort of
110:43 - race through some stuff here
110:44 - okay so where is
110:47 - my thumb drive we were just looking at
110:49 - 68.
110:50 - uh so let's go to 84
110:55 - which i actually already unzipped so
110:57 - i can do this
110:59 - let's just look at 84 to see what that
111:01 - looks like
111:03 - i'm seeing messages here
111:10 - and hold on getting some breaking news
111:12 - here
111:13 - breaking news
111:21 - um
111:23 - there was a version zero on august 2nd
111:28 - that was a test run
111:37 - benfry.com
111:38 - bagel okay hold on
111:41 - hold on hold on everybody
111:49 - all right i have something else
111:52 - to show you all in a moment and i think
111:54 - we just got a donation i can't see the
111:56 - name of it
112:04 - okay
112:05 - so we are i'm attempting to run 84
112:09 - and i might look at revisions.txt just
112:12 - to find some other glorious nuggets
112:16 - um where is processing 84
112:18 - oh okay
112:19 - we're gonna try running did i just copy
112:21 - it then i just copy it here it is
112:23 - oh look at this new logo
112:26 - new logo faq
112:30 - uh processing beta
112:34 - no what's this oh that's css oh look at
112:36 - this what is this
112:39 - oh this is like the faq
112:42 - where can i download processing and how
112:43 - much does it cost
112:45 - how do i learn to use processing
112:47 - read some of the tutorials
112:51 - did i have any tutorials here yet
112:53 - i can't remember this is passed when i
112:55 - started teaching with processing i think
112:57 - oh my god this is there's so much great
112:59 - stuff here
113:00 - um
113:02 - this is not 1.0 software it's buggy and
113:05 - it may kill people
113:08 - i think we can say that no one has been
113:13 - cross fingers behind back throw salt all
113:16 - of that and processing is not uh
113:20 - it's not caused the death of anyone just
113:22 - yet okay people let's look
113:25 - people
113:26 - people look at these people oh simon
113:28 - greenwald doing some lighting in 3d
113:31 - documentation look at these names oh yes
113:32 - sony i was referring to hernando
113:36 - uh
113:36 - i'm just seeing names of people i
113:37 - recognize look at all these wonderful uh
113:40 - folks here um
113:42 - discourse um
113:44 - okay
113:46 - uh links all right so hold on we're
113:48 - gonna run this version of processing
113:50 - i wasn't looking for revisions.txt oh my
113:53 - god
113:54 - so hard faq java
113:57 - bin
114:00 - uh no i i just like to look through all
114:02 - the files to see like where all the like
114:05 - libraries maybe
114:06 - how to oh they're libraries now
114:09 - javascript what
114:11 - what year is this all right we're
114:12 - running this people
114:14 - oh no no
114:17 - okay let's try run. let's try this
114:22 - oh no
114:24 - sorry version 84.
114:26 - okay that was so sad uh let's try going
114:30 - to
114:33 - let's let's try uh
114:37 - could it be that i extracted it on the
114:39 - mac i don't think so though
114:41 - that's possible
114:45 - let's try 77.
114:56 - all right we're gonna try
114:59 - this has been fun folks i definitely
115:01 - have to wrap this up
115:03 - and i got to go back to
115:04 - reviewing all the links and things i was
115:06 - talking about so
115:08 - let's try let's just try 77 extract
115:12 - here
115:22 - okay
115:27 - version 77 yeah this looks more
115:29 - promising
115:33 - oh i feel it running
115:35 - yes version 77 we have running i wish i
115:38 - knew the date of this release
115:40 - uh to sort of like think about if this
115:42 - was one that i was using
115:44 - but uh we can go now we see
115:46 - uh sketch
115:48 - where did the examples show up
115:49 - sketchbook ah here they are sketchbook
115:51 - examples
115:53 - now we can start to see library video
115:56 - loading quicktime particles
115:58 - wait a second here
116:03 - oh this is simon greenwald's particle
116:05 - systems
116:08 - oh translate with a z coordinate can
116:10 - only be used with
116:11 - depth
116:13 - boy that i don't underst was that like
116:17 - was it this
116:18 - was the early p3d like
116:21 - no name depth sort no i don't know how
116:23 - to enable i don't know all right that
116:25 - was not an example that i could get to
116:26 - run little known fact
116:29 - simon and greedwald and i were uh
116:32 - college classmates
116:34 - and computational mama is in the chat
116:37 - everybody should check out computational
116:38 - mama's youtube channel and
116:40 - various amazing activities and
116:43 - fellowship
116:45 - all right
116:46 - sketch
116:47 - tools remember tools auto format we lost
116:51 - beautify we've auto format create font
116:53 - archive sketch
116:54 - okay renderer oh
116:57 - if i switch to opengl
117:00 - i have to switch the
117:08 - renderer it didn't work but that was
117:10 - exciting there was a menu option to
117:13 - switch to opengl i don't remember that
117:15 - but that is cool all right let's go to
117:17 - some different
117:19 - where was that again sketch renderer go
117:22 - to processing let's go to sketch
117:25 - examples i don't know why i tried to do
117:27 - a 3d example edit file sketch
117:33 - uh
117:35 - tools where were the examples
117:38 - i'm
117:39 - i'm losing my mind here
117:41 - a sketchbook here they are
117:43 - sketchbook examples
117:48 - spring
117:52 - i don't know why i'm
117:53 - no
117:55 - oh my god glenn murphy smoke
117:59 - completed november 2
118:04 - oh look at this
118:06 - look at this
118:08 - oh look at this glorious examples of
118:10 - early i mean this is like
118:12 - everything
118:13 - that's in my nature code book now in
118:16 - like this crazy old code example with
118:18 - two dimensional arrays and v-square this
118:20 - is like a fluid simulation smoke
118:23 - wow
118:24 - that's incredible drag the mouse
118:28 - it's running so slow but it's just
118:29 - beautiful
118:31 - this is from 2002 folks
118:36 - 30 000 particles in java and processing
118:38 - random gust does it have this purlin
118:41 - noise in
118:42 - this
118:44 - look at this code it is just glorious
118:46 - class particle
118:49 - oh lowercase class names
118:53 - amazing
118:54 - okay this is so fun to see all right
118:56 - let's try once again
119:00 - well let's make a new sketch
119:06 - let's try running this
119:08 - oh
119:11 - we've got the processing logo looking
119:13 - better now
119:17 - we've got it looking better now
119:21 - so if i go back to u equals 30
119:27 - oh no and make it there we go and make
119:29 - it uh
119:33 - so stroke cap
119:35 - is now in
119:37 - version 77.
119:41 - there we go it's like it looks a little
119:43 - wonky
119:45 - but
119:46 - looking pretty good so here we go we've
119:47 - got the new
119:49 - processing logo
119:52 - running in processing 77 alpha
119:56 - i wish i knew the dates of these
120:00 - i'm not organized i'm a little bit
120:02 - exhausted now i've been streaming for
120:03 - two hours
120:04 - uh marcel bro
120:06 - thank you
120:07 - for your donation to the processing
120:09 - foundation all right i think i need to
120:11 - wrap things up here i kind of had so
120:13 - many ambitions of so much more stuff
120:15 - that i was going to do and get to run i
120:17 - think this has mostly been a success
120:20 - everybody can like snapshot this or
120:23 - share it on i don't know you know but i
120:25 - don't know what i hope i'm hoping people
120:27 - are enjoying this
120:28 - um
120:30 - um i
120:32 - um i want to look at a few i want to
120:34 - sort of wrap things up and say goodbye
120:36 - and kind of review a bunch of things
120:37 - about events are happening this weekend
120:39 - so i am going to switch back to my mac
120:42 - the only way i can do that is by
120:46 - changing the cable
120:49 - and then
120:51 - i need to
120:53 - do this
120:54 - transform
120:56 - reset transform there we go
120:58 - 77 is march 2005. thank you jonathan
121:02 - sims
121:03 - um really appreciate that
121:06 - all right so a couple things i wanted to
121:08 - note is um
121:10 - um if you want to really do a deep dive
121:13 - into the history of processing you
121:15 - should take a look at this page called
121:16 - bagel
121:17 - an architecture project i've been
121:19 - developing as a basis for some of my
121:20 - other work it's a 2d 3d rendering api
121:22 - that runs in java to cross between
121:24 - postscript style imaging and 2d and 3d
121:26 - rendering with opengl
121:29 - so bagel is the original graphics engine
121:33 - that
121:34 - is built inside of processing and if you
121:37 - actually look at some of the source code
121:39 - like you can actually
121:41 - um
121:43 - this might take me a minute to get to
121:46 - but i'm gonna do it anyway
121:48 - like if you go to the releases on github
121:52 - um
121:53 - there's got to be a better way for me to
121:54 - do this but i'm just going to keep
121:56 - hitting next until somebody in the chat
121:58 - tells me how to get to the oldest thing
122:00 - here
122:02 - you can definitely find good stuff here
122:07 - but i
122:08 - this is ridiculous what i'm doing
122:11 - i don't know how many pages there are
122:14 - eventually it's going to go a lot faster
122:17 - yeah
122:18 - and get to the end here
122:21 - there's like in the url i don't see any
122:22 - pagination and i don't know
122:25 - the names of things to say after
122:29 - so this is helpful for dating things i
122:32 - think
122:33 - yeah i think the dates are accurate here
122:35 - i mean github didn't exist so all this
122:38 - has been brought over
122:41 - but i want to go back i just want to go
122:42 - back
122:46 - 2008
122:50 - 2008
122:51 - 2008
122:54 - 2007
122:56 - 2007
122:58 - 2006.
123:01 - we're getting there people
123:06 - 99.
123:08 - ah whoa oh i exceeded a rate limit oh
123:12 - you're so mean to me oh the list of tags
123:18 - no
123:24 - don't you know i'm just an innocent
123:26 - person in a garage
123:28 - with a green screen and a computer who
123:30 - just can't be bothered to actually
123:32 - figure out the names of the tags to get
123:34 - to the right place and i'm just clicking
123:35 - through
123:37 - so cruel all right maybe somebody could
123:39 - give me the link to that last page
123:43 - uh in discord but what i was going to
123:46 - show you is you can find and uh i think
123:48 - you can find like java files called like
123:50 - bagel.java or pbagel.java
123:53 - uh interesting to note um and see um and
123:56 - so this this you'll definitely want to
123:58 - um take a look at
124:00 - um and you can see here this is back
124:02 - from summer of 2001. so this is a sort
124:05 - of early incarnation or name of um the
124:09 - processing project otherwise known i
124:11 - like to refer to it
124:12 - in a friendly way as onion bagel i don't
124:15 - know why but that's what i like to do
124:18 - after equals processing dash 68
124:21 - i think it's not gonna
124:23 - well that should have been obvious to me
124:27 - there we go nope
124:36 - well i got to there anyway let's see if
124:37 - it'll
124:40 - this is going to rate limit me again
124:42 - 59 oh how far back am i going to be able
124:45 - to go here
124:48 - seven
124:50 - all right
124:51 - let's download this and see what's in
124:53 - there so i you know by the way i want to
124:54 - thank dusk
124:56 - uh who does a lot of work on coding
124:58 - train source code and website who really
125:00 - had the idea that's what i should do for
125:02 - the live stream is run early versions of
125:04 - processing and we can see here
125:08 - the bagelpublic.pl
125:11 - what is that oh we can look at some of
125:13 - this code let's look at let's look at um
125:15 - i don't know pde applet.java
125:20 - um visual studio code let's see what's
125:22 - in there
125:32 - because it's the player version cut out
125:33 - all the other crap so this file is as
125:35 - small as possible
125:37 - this is really oh dbm see dbn
125:39 - preprocessor so that's designed by
125:41 - numbers
125:42 - uh sort of
125:44 - um parent of processing in a way program
125:47 - karat equals not a scheme don't beautify
125:50 - if it's python not scheme
125:52 - i love the comments
125:55 - if beautify editor do beautify
125:57 - look some commented out stuff
125:59 - doesn't get any better than this this is
126:01 - used by pde fancy
126:04 - pde fancy what's pde fancy
126:09 - get up time to take a break yeah paint
126:11 - look at this
126:12 - pde fancy
126:17 - pde excess exception processing apples
126:19 - so i just want to look through all the
126:20 - stuff but i gotta i gotta i gotta be
126:22 - done
126:23 - what's in here
126:25 - bagel public
126:27 - bagel.java
126:29 - look at this
126:31 - look at this ancient code i don't know
126:32 - what this does
126:35 - i don't know what this does but i love
126:37 - it
126:38 - uh okay
126:40 - um
126:42 - look at this you can see
126:43 - the original buttons here are the
126:46 - original graphics the buttons from this
126:48 - version three
126:50 - of processing anyway i i obviously could
126:52 - go on and do this stuff forever i got to
126:54 - stop all right folks
126:56 - bringing things to a close here
127:00 - i want to do some reminders

127:06 - new processing website
127:08 - take a look enjoy it uh take a look at
127:11 - the thread
127:12 - from design systems international
127:14 - describing all about the new logo and
127:16 - the website
127:17 - um
127:19 - go to the processing foundation 20th

127:55 - processing foundation um i can help you
127:58 - do that it's pretty easy actually if you
127:59 - just go to your youtube studio
128:02 - go to monetization giving join
128:04 - fundraiser search for processing you
128:05 - should find it um there's also the hick
128:08 - at nunc fundraiser i believe tomorrow
128:11 - there will be a zoom workshop of how to
128:13 - participate in this information
128:15 - somewhere
128:16 - uh
128:18 - uh i'll try to retweet this stuff from
128:20 - my twitter or i have been um i don't

128:24 - um
128:26 - thanks to all these people for
128:27 - organizing uh thanks to all of you for
128:29 - tuning in to this um what i wanted to do
128:32 - and i i unfortunately i'm just way out
128:34 - of time
128:36 - and let me actually run processing four
128:39 - you should download go to the new
128:41 - processing website go to download there
128:44 - is a 4.0 beta one
128:47 - there are new ways to report bugs and
128:50 - more information about supported
128:51 - platforms all the stuff we were looking
128:53 - at from 20 years ago is still there
128:56 - and i want to really run this version
128:58 - because i was not running it there we go
129:02 - um here we go
129:05 - processing ah look at this
129:07 - read about the status of the 4.0 release
129:10 - some sketches from processing two or
129:11 - three may not be compatible so i got to
129:13 - come back and do another live stream
129:14 - really diving into processing four it's
129:17 - not happening today i'm going to follow
129:19 - their instructions and click to create a
129:20 - new sketchbook
129:24 - and i'm going to make it just in
129:26 - in my documents file
129:31 - i don't know i guess i messed that up
129:37 - let's try that again
129:38 - let's make a new folder called uh
129:40 - processing four
129:44 - that should work
129:45 - maybe that didn't work i don't know
129:46 - what's happening let's just get started
129:49 - look at the new design some new colors
129:52 - what i wanted to do
129:54 - and let's just see if we can make the
129:55 - quickest version of this
129:58 - i wanted to make a birthday cake um you
130:00 - know for inspiration
130:04 - um you can see this wonderful uh
130:06 - birthday message that
130:07 - um
130:10 - everybody did
130:11 - uh not everybody sorry that um a bye
130:14 - simon and starbuck yeah made um i'm
130:16 - encouraging people to make their own
130:18 - celebratory processing in p5.js sketch
130:21 - um coming back to me here boy am i
130:23 - exhausted um we're gonna we're gonna do
130:25 - a really quick and dirty birthday cake
130:27 - okay
130:29 - it's going to be a two layer cake
130:31 - i'm not going to think about anything
130:33 - like color
130:35 - all of you are going to be assigned to
130:37 - make your own version of this and share
130:40 - it
130:41 - let's make the window
130:43 - i wanted to do this in the ancient
130:44 - versions of processing but let's do it
130:46 - in processing four as a celebration
130:49 - so let's say
130:50 - 100
130:53 - 300
130:54 - 500
130:56 - 100
130:58 - fill
131:00 - so this will be the bottom of the cake
131:03 - i can't do math right now
131:05 - 400
131:09 - there we go
131:10 - bottom layer
131:11 - now let's do a rectangle
131:14 - that's at uh
131:16 - 200
131:19 - that is um
131:21 - starting at 200 that is just
131:25 - 300 wide
131:30 - i can't do math in my okay so maybe it
131:32 - should be 200 wide
131:35 - there we go
131:37 - i want it to be a little bit um so let's
131:39 - do 150
131:41 - and 250 i think that should do it
131:44 - or i mean 300 that's what i've had 300
131:47 - 50 times two
131:49 - okay here's the start of our cake
131:53 - now i'm going to use a for loop
131:56 - we should put the logo right in there
131:59 - hold on
132:00 - let's go grab
132:05 - let's go grab this logo oh right i need
132:08 - to get it from the gist
132:10 - um
132:15 - so let's make a function called p5 logo
132:20 - let's put this in here
132:23 - um we don't need i don't want draw grid
132:25 - because i'm not going to draw the grid
132:28 - i don't want
132:30 - show grid or setup
132:34 - our background
132:40 - so let's say
132:42 - p5 let's just see where it puts it
132:47 - and so let's uh make it smaller
132:53 - and let's do
132:54 - um
133:00 - push i'm going to move it around with
133:01 - translate and rotate push matrix
133:04 - pop matrix and i'm sorry i'm standing in
133:06 - front of the code here
133:08 - push matrix translate
133:11 - uh i don't know
133:13 - is it centered probably is right so what
133:16 - did i make 300 let's just let's just
133:19 - guestimate
133:21 - let's move it back
133:23 - make a little smaller
133:28 - and move it down
133:34 - this feels like it's gonna be about
133:35 - right there we go uh
133:38 - there we go okay the processing cake
133:40 - with the logo on it that's
133:42 - good and now we just need a little for
133:46 - loop
133:49 - oh uh into x equals
133:53 - the top of the cake which starts at 150
133:56 - x is less than 300. x plus equal so if
133:59 - the width is 300
134:02 - and we need 20 candles
134:07 - um
134:09 - we need 20 candles
134:11 - is this going to be right and we just
134:13 - want to draw a rectangle
134:16 - from
134:19 - x
134:20 - comma
134:21 - where's the y here 200 minus let's try
134:25 - like 180
134:27 - dx like half the candle will be like 20
134:30 - percent of that size
134:31 - and it's just 20 pixels high
134:34 - what would i do
134:38 - wrong that 20 or is that 10.
134:44 - one two three four that's only ten
134:47 - three
134:48 - oh is it um
134:51 - is it because
134:54 - no i don't have floats what did i do
134:56 - wrong here people how do i get 20
134:58 - candles
134:59 - 150 oh no no no the width is going all
135:03 - the way up to 450. there we go
135:06 - 155
135:08 - 455.
135:10 - okay look
135:12 - there's my 20 candles
135:14 - i'll make them a little thicker
135:17 - and a little taller all this stuff
135:18 - should be variables there we go here's
135:21 - my cake
135:23 - 20 candles
135:24 - now we're gonna put little we're gonna
135:26 - light them
135:28 - okay so we're gonna go to uh
135:31 - happy birthday this is the last thing
135:33 - i'm doing
135:36 - my poor children
135:39 - then i'm going to
135:42 - um
135:44 - i am going to what am i doing ah okay
135:46 - wait let's just see
135:47 - uh examples
135:49 - um add examples
135:51 - uh
135:52 - nature of code
135:54 - install
136:00 - just
136:04 - okay so now
136:06 - um let's go to
136:08 - and i could have used that original
136:09 - smoke example but i just know my code
136:12 - better
136:13 - so i'm gonna go to contributed examples
136:14 - nature of code
136:16 - systems
136:18 - i've updated these examples since but
136:20 - let's go to this one let's try smoke
136:23 - here
136:26 - great perfect this will be our candle
136:28 - so we just need particle
136:35 - and we just need particle system
136:42 - and now
136:44 - we need an array
136:47 - of particle systems
136:52 - we're going to call this
137:00 - we need 20 candles that are particle
137:02 - systems
137:04 - and i actually just need this same loop
137:06 - here
137:10 - and i should be saying
137:12 - um
137:15 - this is a terrible way to do it but it's
137:17 - the way i'm gonna do it can't stop me
137:22 - uh
137:26 - can't stop me because i've got to do
137:27 - this fast
137:29 - so i and let's call this i i'm kind of
137:31 - like i have a loop which is already
137:32 - giving me the right x positions so i'm
137:34 - just going to separately count i there's
137:36 - probably a way to put it inside the
137:37 - floor loop i'm going to say candles
137:39 - index i equals new particle system
137:42 - and uh
137:44 - x comma 150
137:48 - would be the initial location is that
137:51 - not what it wants
137:54 - oh it needs an image
137:57 - oh let's do this without images because
138:00 - and i don't know why i wrote birthday
138:02 - with a capital d there i'm so used to
138:05 - so what we're gonna do here is just
138:09 - get rid of the image oh and it it needs
138:11 - a vector okay but that's fine
138:14 - we're gonna get rid of the image
138:17 - boy this is some old code this is not my
138:19 - updated version
138:21 - so also i need to say
138:24 - [Music]
138:26 - new vector
138:28 - xy
138:29 - and we're going to put
138:31 - just
138:32 - five particles in to start
138:35 - and then here
138:37 - instead of this
138:39 - we're going to say for
138:41 - every
138:43 - candle
138:44 - in candles
138:47 - candle dot add particle
138:49 - can't i don't remember what the
138:50 - functions are
138:52 - candle
138:54 - add particle
138:57 - candle run
138:59 - candle run
139:02 - uh new
139:05 - that's so weird and oh so particle
139:07 - doesn't have an image anymore
139:11 - but what just happened
139:15 - oh no wrong passer what's going on
139:18 - okay that was just a momentary hiccup
139:21 - boy this is all well don't look at this
139:23 - code i gotta update it it's all using
139:24 - some old processing stuff my examples
139:26 - are updated
139:29 - uh yep so let's just do it with a circle
139:34 - because i want to make them maybe
139:39 - no image
139:42 - no image
139:48 - uh this circle should be
139:51 - i don't know
139:52 - 16 16.
139:56 - there we go look at that oh i need the
139:57 - lines i got rid of the lines why did i
139:59 - get rid of the lines
140:11 - uh where's my dx
140:13 - let's just make that a global there's so
140:15 - many ways this could be improved there
140:17 - we go
140:18 - here's my processing cape
140:21 - i made it
140:22 - yes now the question is
140:25 - oh no i have to make a p5 version of
140:27 - this okay everybody
140:28 - i gotta go
140:30 - happy birthday processing i what i'd
140:32 - like to do is i would like to so
140:34 - i'm gonna figure out a way uh join the
140:36 - coding train discord follow me on
140:38 - twitter at some point today um i'm gonna
140:41 - get this code how can i get this out
140:43 - there right now ah i know what to do
140:46 - so just give me a second here i'm going
140:49 - to open up discord so
140:51 - if you're not in the coding train
140:52 - discord i am
140:54 - going to uh
140:56 - just go to thecodingtrain.com discord
140:59 - um
141:00 - and then here
141:03 - um in the discord
141:05 - um
141:07 - i have a channel
141:09 - called links
141:10 - and what i'm going to do right now
141:13 - is i'm just going to
141:15 - [Music]
141:19 - come on columns
141:21 - uh
141:22 - compress this i think it'll let me do
141:23 - this i'm hoping discord will let me do
141:25 - this
141:26 - i'm just going to share
141:28 - uh
141:29 - birthday processing
141:31 - birthday cake so for those of you who
141:34 - want to grab that code right now
141:37 - if you oh and i'm in the i'm not on the
141:39 - screen if you join the discord
141:41 - uh the coding trend and i'll get this in
141:43 - a better places like somehow like linked
141:45 - from the video description or on social
141:47 - media later but i've gotta run
141:50 - so if you join the coding train discord
141:52 - the
141:53 - discord uh you have to go uh to the um
141:58 - read me and like react to the code of
142:00 - conduct and then you'll see all the
142:02 - channels if you go here under links
142:04 - you'll see uh the birthday cake code um
142:07 - i will make a p5 version of it uh at
142:10 - some point
142:11 - i want you to add color to it make it
142:13 - your own make your own version of it
142:16 - share it on twitter on instagram on
142:19 - discord on youtube wherever um join for
142:23 - all of the events um happening this
142:26 - weekend
142:27 - um here they are um advocacies uh
142:30 - processing foundation.org advocacy pcd
142:33 - 2021
142:34 - i'm hoping to raise 2 000
142:37 - and make a matching donation from the
142:38 - coding train um to the processing
142:40 - foundation so far we've raised 519
142:44 - stay tuned for my bezier curve video is
142:46 - coming out the fundraiser will be
142:47 - attached to that i don't know what else
142:49 - to say
142:50 - um smoke rainbow algorithm i will

142:54 - in the chat um i'm going to
142:58 - zoom in on this
143:01 - and take you out
143:03 - uh with some music um this is the
143:06 - processing foundation coding train
143:08 - fundraiser theme song from
143:11 - uh
143:12 - from
143:14 - 20
143:15 - from december i'm going to play that and

144:03 - everyone who's been watching and viewing
144:05 - and joining and saying nice things in
144:07 - the chat uh super appreciate it and um
144:09 - i'll be back more classic computing is
144:12 - coming on the coding train i had so much
144:13 - fun with my precious thinkpad here that
144:16 - i think uh i got more plans got an apple
144:18 - 2 plus
144:20 - that i hope to be live streaming from at
144:21 - some point in the future all right see

144:56 - [Music]
145:01 - and the processing foundation lets us
145:04 - keep the engine going on the coding
145:07 - train
145:09 - it comes along and then it takes you
145:11 - away
145:13 - into a world where all that matters is
145:16 - the this dot and p5js

Cleaned transcript:

so do do do hello everyone test one two this is not the mic i intended to use but i had a little bit of a um issue finding properly charged batteries so hopefully you can hear me okay let me in you know in the chat we will i will be beginning in just a couple minutes uh and the batteries are charging so i will switch to a different mic maybe about a half an hour hello good morning oh boy this new train whistle really requires quite a lot of breath happy friday happy coding train day happy birthday processing ready everybody with me are you with me happy birthday to you i really should have like prerecorded some background instrumentals or something happy birthday to you are you all everybody throughout the world all across the internet are you singing this with me happy birthday dear processing happy birthday to you okay we got that done with uh welcome my name is dan perhaps this is the first time you're ever tuning into a coding train live stream if so welcome uh this is a bit of an unusual live stream although to be perfectly frank um they're all kind of a bit of a mess and unusual in their own way there's a lot of things at play here number one is i have this uh wonderful prop microphone hello this microphone does not work because in my um amazing preparedness i spent an hour getting this setup going yesterday tested a bunch of different microphones found the one i wanted to use plugged the batteries into charge overnight i pulled them out of the socket this morning they were dead so i have no idea what happened i moved them to another socket i think they're charging but this is the microphone that i am currently using so um hopefully you can hear me okay there might be a little bit of an echo in here i've been in a very large garage space i have a pile of sound foam over there that i intend to tape across the ceiling tape i don't know mount to the ceiling i've got some sound blankets hanging this is a green screen curtain i don't know if i um behind me but i will come back another time and talk about my new streaming setup which i will be launching more officially as the school year begins in september to make a lot of tutorial videos and do all sorts of live streams and coding training stuff but that is not by no means at all what i am here today to do uh today i am here to celebrate 20 years of processing or p5 this is uh well it's redrawn but this is the original uh one of the original logos from processing alpha thank you to chris orban um for your donation let's see if i can get this going thank you chris you have donated 25 to processing i see it in the chat i don't know if i'm gonna catch all these we've raised 90 so far um my goal here and i will be making a matching donation from the coding train is to raise a total of we can do this two thousand dollars the fundraiser will extend beyond today there's lots of other ways to give to the processing foundation that i will show um and um there's lots of other events this weekend and if any by the way if anybody is watching who is uh releasing a video or doing a live stream on youtube this weekend the donation button that you see to the left of me over there is a youtube fundraiser that i um initiated and any video can be attached to it so just get in touch daniel at thecodingtrain.com would be a fine place to start um if you want to know how to attach the fundraiser to your youtube video it can even be a youtube video from like three years ago if you want but uh you know the idea is i think for people who are releasing things or doing live streams this weekend so speaking of which julian nichols has donated i don't know if i'm going to play this sound effect every time we get a donation but i'm playing it right now for julian thank you your kind generous donation will hopefully bring about 20 more years of the wonderful uh software and community that we all know and love as uh processing and p5.js and processing python and android processing and all the things i have so much to show you today we have so many by the way this you're in for a real treat i mean normally i would never say that because normally the coding train i'm trying to tell you please leave don't watch it's a mess i'm not prepared i don't know what i'm doing my life is actually there's lots of wonderful things about my life but i'm i'm having a really hard time right now um i'm moving uh my kids are alone i i put breakfast out for them i wrote them a note so my wife is in uh brooklyn who's like packing up the house and there's a lot of stuff going on so thank you bear with me i'm gonna be here for about an hour um and then i will come back hopefully raring to go in september with more content but um before i get too uh far rambling i want to make sure i talk about some stuff and show some things so first of all um if you're not aware of all the events happening this weekend i'm calling this like a kickoff event but it's not actually officially a kickoff event i just happened to schedule it first i was like i'll go on friday and then i can be a kickoff event um so uh celebrate the 20th anniversary of processing with the community on august 20th to 22nd by sharing events zines cakes and artworks who's in um you can see here there's a bunch of different information for you but this is what i want to show you in terms of the events so this is what you're watching right now coding with processing release so that's the real treat you're in for this eye if you can sort of figure guess if anybody can guess what this is over here some of you know because i ran some tests yesterday with members and anonymous donated we're up to 120 this is fantastic i feel like i'm like a live telethon can you call in hello thank you for oh yes i will can i have your credit card number please is that how it works i don't know mail me the cash what do they do when they have phone calls red hand donated 20 pounds anonymous donated 20 euros this is amazing okay and for your donation which you don't need to have to make a donation for you can also check out uh processing 2021 latino america from nicolas torranasco friday august 20th i wonder what time that is hopefully i'm not conflicting with that um there's an inperson event uh chris coleman is running in denver this is a limited attendance but um here are a few there's many more things processing community day 2021 from tim rhoden broker if you're not aware of tim rodenbroker's youtube channel his courses his website definitely check it out tim is doing what i wish that i had the capacity to do which is organize a whole event with a bunch of different speakers and a lot of different things this is just me turning pressing a button stream or rambling i did do some work to get this little ah my my precious my precious here for you that i'm going to show you in a little bit thank you sauron uh [Laughter] soren slip of code there's so many donations rolling in i cannot possibly keep track of them i'm thrilled and amazed uh amar's asking is there any other way to donate i will get to that i will get to that so many questions um so check out tim's um processing community day uh check out all of his uh work actually coming soon well there's a little bit of it's not an aside really but i have been making some videos that were requested by donors to the winter fundraiser for processing last december i'm going a little bit slow the bezier curve video is coming out this weekend to celebrate uh i just gave it away the first video which is about the bezier curve anonymous code guppy oh my god i cannot i cannot believe this um all of this is um uh what was i saying oh yeah the my first video in this series is coming out this weekend it's all done ready to go just finishing the captions making the web page for it you know cleaning up the code examples thank you to all the folks who helped me with the coding train that i would like to name right now but i got to move on um but tim is also a donor from the winter fundraiser and requested a particular video and i have recorded that one and it's got a really cool example in it i just it's not finished yet so that will be coming out soon thank you to tim for that okay processing community hangout in japan uh saturday august 21st pcd seoul saturday august 21st uh creative code jam online edition creative code there are so many more events than the last time i checked by the way uh processing community day india saturday august 21st i guess i need to sign up for i don't know how i'm going to catch all these but um i would love to join for all of these his young thank you for your donation amazing and i really want to make a big plug here for uh creative coding fest sauber khan education community director of processing foundation hopefully got that title right uh on sunday august 21st creative coding fest is an event that i participated in many iterations of we we've we used to have them in person in new york city uh there's been some in california and now they're you know happening online it's really it's a free inclusive event i cannot recommend it more if you're new to creative coding if you're a teacher let's just uh click on the link to take a look you can it's free um and you can still get tickets and i i wanted to see um i feel like i wanted to see who the um i wanted to make sure i got this right i don't want to say it wrong the keynote speakers are super exciting um but i think i might be ah here let me go here uh schedule yeah miles barry and evelyn maso if you're not familiar with their work you should be dave webb donated 20 pounds the prostate foundation oh yeah okay thank you uh and so you should definitely check this out i'm going to be participating to the extent that i can but i did i mentioned that i'm moving right now oh my god it's it's a it's a it's it's a lot okay um all right where where do i want to be okay closing this out or we got some more events for me to plug um processing community copenhagen from andreas restguard saturday october 2nd uh looking for speakers so you if you're just learning about this today and want to organize your own processing community today get in touch with the processing foundation there's a form there's information all on this page check it out somebody post this link into the chat for me um pcdr house from winnie soon saturday october 9th but i also i want to mention uh here we go we've got some exciting stuff coming up listen to this ben frye and casey reese the original creators of the first version of processing 20 years ago in august 2001 will be interviewed on art blocks it's a live stream type of thing somehow i could click on the link sure would tell me this is not to be missed i hope it's recorded so i can watch it later if i miss it but i would really try to attend um you're not going to want to miss that um thank you know i i have to say that um for me the work that i didn't i didn't discover processing i think until about 2003 um interestingly enough um august 2001 when the first edition of processing was released if you'll indulge me for a moment in my own story this is not about me but i was just entering about to enter my first year as a student at itp which is the program where i teach now i took my first course in programming not using processing using macromedia director i know that stig in the chat had mentioned um and i see there's more donations coming in thank you so much um stig had uh mentioned also that he was using uh macromedia director at the time that is uh exactly what i was learning on i discovered processing a couple years later uh i taught my first course in processing around 2004 i think i made a forum post around 2003 and um i just kept doing it here i am today in a garage in upstate new york for the first time live streaming lots more about this new space i have for the coding train um that i'm very excited about also it's very humid in here this is not an air it's a beautiful cool area of new york state but it is very hot and humid today there is no air conditioning in this garage and actually a bird i have the garage door open a bird just flew in it was like fluttering about anyway okay um yeah by the way um i uh people in the chat are talking about how 2001 was 20 years ago i feel old um i was uh 27 at the time oh no 28 i think i just turned 28 when processing um was first released a little factoid there for you but i didn't was not aware of it okay ah and now here's another thing that i want to talk about so and i know very little about this i'm not an expert i'm not using this platform yet or i don't know if i will but there is something called hicket nunc uh which is a um tzos i guess uh they call them the nfts i don't i can't click on this but there's a fundraiser going on uh which um i should know more about there we go uh if you click on this it's being organized by wonderful people uh in particular just a shout out i believe well i actually i think it's tomorrow a whole bunch of these folks are doing a workshop um maybe somebody in the chat can let me know um i know here's where my preparation has fallen apart because i was sort of expecting to see more information here but if you want to participate in this uh hashtag sketch for processing um search uh twitch raphael decorville oh yes it's a zoom workshop happening tomorrow where's the link to it i saw it in the processing newsletter today did i just miss it um so maybe it's not on this page here but i'm sure we could find out find the information there's a zoom workshop i believe and apologies if i'm missing names but i know that melissa rafael and casey are participating in the zoom workshop tomorrow maybe some of these other folks ah sorin is posting uh hick dot link slash processing so check that out it's another way to participate in the 20th anniversary to raise money but you know as much as i'm here i would very much like to raise money for the continued mission and work of the protesting foundation um you know there are a lot of you watching this or who knows where you're around the world who knows what you're able to do you are able to you don't have to donate to participate you can join into the events make it bake a real life cake i'm going to try to code like a birthday cake or something today maybe that's sort of my loose plan um you can see here if i go back to uh this screen uh i should have mentioned i meant to mention this right at the outset um thank you to um abbay i'm always mispronouncing it by his name but hopefully i got it right uh simon three uh viewers i bel uh i know that i i know um simon and abbay are but viewers of the coding train who made this wonderful um processing um animation uh happy birthday animation i encourage you to make something like this yourself and i guess share it on social media i don't know sketch for processing pcd2021 i don't know peter is saying uh 20 years ago i was not born which is my i'm always floored by the youth of my audience because you know uh i just assume who wants to watching me like uh wilderness dan by the way is returning a little bit here just streaming on the youtube trying to be youthful i don't know thank you for watching it's very kind of you all right we gotta we gotta get moving oh it's 11 26 and i said only an hour i have so much to do okay okay let's see here we're gonna get to the good stuff we're gonna get to the good stuff so for next next up i want to talk about this have you seen this have you seen this have you seen this this is the new processing website uh there's a new logo i'm gonna talk about that and show that but you should you should check that go to this url processing.org and bask bask in its beauty and elegance uh i know that casey up until like you know a month ago basically the processing website was still running on like you know 15 plus years old pearl scripts that casey reese has developed over the years during the documentation this is an initiative from design systems international who uh generously donated their time design systems international uh is a design company roon matson and martine bravo and many others i got a little project going on with them as well more about that another time they uh redid uh the visual identity for the prostate foundation its projects and the new website so i encourage you to check out this twitter thread um you can see sort of like some fun images of how they imagine it this is a really cool little video here which i could just go to the actual web page but it's showing you kind of this little editor and how the logo itself is programmatic so it's centered around a program to drive logos from a simple set of rules right hey my whole life is based on making things off of simple sets of rules at this point draw three lines or curves in the intersections of an 8x8 grid and this is one of the things that i really love about computational media creative coding and open source communities like processing and p5.js is the ability to take your ideas execute them and and and create new new designs new interfaces new animations uh just from rules and your own creativity so kudos this is really wonderful fun to play with i should click over there to look at it um you can sort of see some more stuff i encourage you to read all about it learn more about design systems international you can see the different logos and various things um and i'm going to i think now move back to just looking at the website itself so uh somebody had asked in the chat um if you uh can't uh if you if you're not able to donate via the youtube link and you would like to donate there's a donate button here which is just a direct um credit card uh payment powered by donorbox so this is a way that you can donate as well um and also there's the i don't know how to pronounce it hick nunk um fundraiser that you can also join uh but i encourage you to donate look at this i love this is my this is my absolute favorite thing you know you know as you can probably tell from my all my little like coding trained characters i love putting little eyeballs on anything i want to code this so i want to make my own version so if you want to learn about the code for the new logo i i feel like there should be more things i want to look at on the website but i guess i will hold off on that what i wanted to look at oh yeah open editor so this is the really cool thing here um i can click on this and sort of like play around with the colors um and uh i can start to i know i actually have not used this until right now but i think i can rewrite some of the code or i can like move things around i don't know how to do it oh yeah look at that whoa what am i doing this is wild uh and i can hit reset so lots of fun stuff one of the things i was sort of curious to do i wonder if i can copy paste this i'm having trouble copy pasting this anybody has an idea for how i could do that copy um from this code editor but um one of the things i was curious to do is what is the earliest version of processing that i can get this code to run on if somebody could as a little favor to me right now maybe figure out a way to put this code into like a github gist or something i'm probably just you know i'm i'm fairly inept using the computer i'm not sure if you've noticed you really should be instant i should be fired from my this is not a job but if i could be fired from it i absolutely should be fired um but if i could get this code um i would love to um uh see where i could get it to run all right so what is what else what else all right i think we're gonna move on now so again this is this won't be a super i'm just sorry looking at the chat is java running in the browser how did they do that asks armor um good question i seriously doubt java is running in the browser um but um most likely this is using some um like javascript behind the scenes whether it's p5.js in some magic way or there's a there is a project called processing.js i don't i'm i'm you know i shouldn't speculate but um if anyone from dsi is in the chat um you can uh absolutely chime in here all right okay i've calmed down a little bit all right we're gonna go now to ben fry's twitter this is uh by the way so from november 2020 back in november 2020 hold on this is perfect for me to play this it was a month before the processing 2020 fundraiser i really got to make those videos for the processing fundraiser but they're coming out uh the bezier curve one is coming out this summer so um august 2021 this was in november announced will be the 20th anniversary of processing how should all right this is my this is the theme song from the prosthetic fundraiser but uh we'll move on i'll play that at the end as an outro maybe um so um ben frye tweeted we're looking for your ideas i i don't know was his idea maybe for me to come on to a live stream with this with with my precious precious little little black box here that i'm about to turn on and plug in and show you maybe otherwise i'll be doing a presentation ben you could uh i'm not too far from you get in the car you could make it here still you could do your presentation on how we determine the exact time now i think there has been some latest breaking news about when the exact time might have actually been but i'll hold off i don't have that information at bay at hand on how we determine the exact time of the first release from a corrupted archive using a combo of hex editor the stuff it file format specs some code and knowledge of how 1984 style mac date timestamps work so this uh this all of this led to and by the way i have this file right here on my computer um that i totally know how to use totally know how to use this computer right here this is the file right there and you can see by the way thank you ben frye for providing me with all these look at this look at this treasure trove of versions of processing from the early days oh they're so beautiful and wonderful oh i'm so excited uh this one though however is uh corrupted so i'm not able to open it but fortunately the fixed one is here i have it i'm going to run it for you in a moment using my precious you think my batteries have charged is the audio fine let me know if i should bother um uh bother trying to go and get my batteries that are charging for my nonprop microphone i guess i could like you know clip it to my glasses or something i don't know hat okay oh stretch everybody get up and stretch you've been watching a live stream on youtube before i don't have a watch on i don't know 36 minutes 35 minutes you should stretch i'm just checking my phone because my kids are by themselves in the house i swear did i mention put out breakfast home there they're like practically teenagers they'll be fine um uh oh there's batteries in the kitchen they're telling me so i could go get those um all right all right all right i did not look at my phone anymore i just wanna make sure no emergency like i was trying to cook some eggs and the house is on fire texts everything's fine sound is good echo reverb is there's a bit of an echo yeah i'm thank you zack knight for your donation apologies i'm not catching all these donations i can see that we're up to 402 all right i see the processing.org logo code has been uh gifted to me in discord i will come back to that all right so this is how uh i believe uh the the exact date and time was determined which um i'm trying to um right now it's in the video description of what you're watching right now somebody pasted the chat so i want to go back though i want to go back and look at so did you know that processing well there's been uh from what i understand and you should you know again i was not there so i am speaking third hand or from my memory of what people have told me but um there's been there were a few different names uh to what processing might have been called before processing i will not reveal those but at the time the website was process fiving with fives instead of the essence this is why you see the shorthand logo sometimes for processing as p5 and where the javascript version from the processing foundation created by lauren mccarthy and maintained by so many amazing people i can someone just print me a list of all their names so i could read them right now um uh process fiving that's where so i i believe that perhaps the domain was not available and that uh searching made doing an internet search for processing was always difficult so the fives were kind of a way of um creating more of a unique identifier and if we go back what's really fun about this and let's see if i can get to this one i'm going to try to go back and i'm going to go back on the internet wayback machine and we're going to look now at the 2001 uh and again i looked at this stuff like a week ago but i haven't looked at it recently i can't remember i might have to click onto 2002 i don't recall we're gonna click back here uh to 2001 uh november 30th so this is presumably august 9th being the original first release we're now a few months later looking at the first website uh for pro surviving and here it is uh process fiving we're gonna read this right now 20th of october 2001. processing is an environment for programming images movement and interaction it is a sketchbook for developing ideas a tool for creating prototypes and a context for learning the fundamentals of computer programming i would say all that holds true today and this is my favorite thing look at this look at all these variations process processing now with the yeses but a zero and a one environment is in its early stages and will continue to develop it just had a fun project idea to like make a text generator program that makes all versions of the word processing with different numbers processing with parentheses now is written in java and enables the creation of java applications and applets oh i miss you applets within a carefully designed set of constraints it uses a 2d 3d java rendering api that is a cross between postscript style imaging and 2d and 3d rendering with opengl i don't know if you all realize how amazingly innovative this was into that what uh like in incredible invention now this isn't to say that processing is the first example of socalled creative coding or that there aren't um many uh other systems that processing drew heavy inspiration from just to name a few a logo the wellknown turtle graphics programming language and environment pioneered by uh many different people that i will not uh mess up the names of right now and then of course if you're not familiar with design by numbers design by numbers is a programming environment created by john mida who is the professor at mit media lab for casey and ben and designed my numbers was a programming system for uh designers to be able to learn to code and create computational designs i think for me and i'm speaking for myself here the innovation here of building upon that work of the design by number system and i wish i had a lot of historical stuff to pull up for you about design by numbers no prepared presentation here with slides or anything as you can see um but is this suddenly working with java by taking this idea of simple code you know i i have a from a presentation a slide i should pull this up of like how to draw a line in java without processing and it's like you know public main class string args blah blah blah it's like this crazy thing and then in processing you just say line this idea of simplifying boiling down all of the sort of logic to create a graphics content context and draw a line into a single line of code but placing that within a programming language like java which suddenly can do networking and serial and uh data and just anything that you could basically imagine i mean there's a sort of joke of like java is not the best at anything as a programming language but it's the best at doing everything i i'm paraphrasing i don't really get that right so that is really the uh i think amazing incredible and flash of course i'm forgetting to uh thank you to uh copper who mentioned flash i never really used flash so that's why i think it like falls out of my memory but also the lingo programming language created by um john henry thompson who um uh is a research fellow at itp and has done guest a guest video on a coding train that you should definitely check out as well those are other um presents all right so i love seeing this let's look at the reference so this is the full reference this is really fun so i don't know why i love it so much pr parentheses parenthesis ce51ng i just love all this okay environment coordinates programming modes default pro okay point line wrecked circle bezier curve bezier curve was their cat low rom curve that's not in there anymore look at that kavo rom curve try typing that in processing today good luck to you boy this violated everything i always knew about processing was the core ethos of processing is all about only two words to name a function that's three that's three that's a violation sphere sphere there was sphere even in the beginning the maybe sphere was is like instead of another circle wow circle was back in the original version of processing it went away was replaced by ellipse and now it's back again color all this stuff all right so um i guess what i want to do now uh get to the good stuff is look at this standard control numbers i'm sorry i'm just fascinated by this oh translate and rotate we're right there from the beginning lights on i mean was there a 3d renderer just even from the start i don't recall um okay now what i would like to do the cat mill rom curve is just curved now it says alka that is correct um what i would like to do now is switch over to my precious um i'm gonna just actually like i'm gonna grab my phone just give me a second here um and i'm going to go to woo do you can you see the sweat pouring down my face how's my lighting by the way in the the key of the green screen this is a whole new setup that i haven't used yet so any feedback on that i would love to hear it you definitely need to do more work on the sound um wait i'm looking for uh epocam pro okay let's see connect connect connect connect this was working yesterday without a hitch are you kidding me i do have backup all right well there's also this possibility i don't want to i don't know why this is not working i'm on let's see if i do this look see this is me trying to connect to this camera but i don't know why settings connection wifi uh all right i'm going to give this one more try and see oh i wonder if that's the um people are telling me the quality of my video isn't great of course this is not working all right it's you know i had to restart my router if some internet issues or i'm coming back to this all right so that's that's a little bit of a fail it's just going to show you a picture of this laptop but instead i'm going to press a button should pick up this microphone so you can hear the beautiful noise ready here we go this is i believe a 1999 era thinkpad computer it is the uh about the same computer that ben frye was using to develop the original version processing um and i got this off of ebay for 75 i'm making a little computer museum for myself here in this garage um in upstate new york um i am get i'm getting my childhood apple ii plus computer i've got some old macs a clamshell mac i'm trying to get my hands on so if you've got an old computer that kind of still works you want to unload you can send it to me get in touch this is my new thing i love i love i just cannot get enough of using these older computers so i'm going to go unplug a cable and plug another cable back in and if all goes according to plan you will now be seeing the output of this thinkpad on the live stream this took me by the way i can't tell you how many hours i put into getting this computer to work to run old versions of processing and to uh get the output i shouldn't be saying this before it even works get the output the vga output into open broadcast studio to stream so here we go uh here we go unplugging a cable plugging a new cable in i'm really hoping you see this right now i don't know yet because i'm trying to stand up and not bang my head ah you do there it is all right so uh if you don't uh remember this this is windows 2000 again i believe this is i don't know what model number this is like but it's an ibm thinkpad this is actually the one of the compute this is a computer i used to use oh this is an x30 ibm thinkpad x30 um if i look on the bottom we'll see that the model number that's the serial number which i guess i probably shouldn't give out or i don't know if that matters it has a mac address anyway where's the model number i can't my eyesight is not good enough to see so um i have been enjoying using this computer updating my norton antivirus 2001. you can never be too careful doesn't matter if i've got a 1999 thinkpad that's not connected to the internet better update i've got like a a cdrom drive that plugs into it it's amazing i should go pull that out for you it's got a bunch of different things on the back i was going to show all this with you with my phone it actually has an ethernet port and i was ah oh great uh roon is in the chat from design systems international there you go um so um this what was i saying here um i actually was able to get this hooked up to the internet but it won't load barely any web pages because they all are https and the javascript stuff and like the browsers don't support you know i didn't want to so here we go without further ado i am now going to for you open up and by the way i should say i'll note that if you're interested in running old versions of processing you actually don't need a 1999 or 2000 era pc i have a maybe fiveyearold pc i didn't actually try the one on windows 10 but it's like running a what's before windows 10. anyway i was able to run all the old versions on windows you could just on a modern windows computer you can go back and run every version of processing pretty much the problem is these things that were all that i cannot i cannot quit you right the power pc to intel to m1 apple's voraciously and aggressively um deprecates things and i have been trying my darndest i even i have an old 2008 mac but it has an upgrade it has os x on it and i've been trying to install tiger but it's not powered pc i've spent like a whole day trying to get old versus the processing around that but you really are you're it's a lost cause in many ways um i hope i can get an old some older macs to do it um to run older versions of processing but windows the stuff just works it continues to work and it works but it's more fun to run it on the original hardware itself oh my sound board doesn't work because i'm connected to the right so i forgot that my sound board is um connected through this laptop into the streaming system so when i unplug this laptop uh i so um i did buy an additional hdmi capture card it just did not show i think i even paid for expedited shipping so i could have them both going but it did not show up i'm in the boonies now so who knows who knows how it works up here all right um so a mental note no sound effects while i'm playing this um it actually has uh there's actually an audio cable here that i could get the audio out of but let's not worry about that all right no drum roll i'll just do it myself 001 okay so look at this first of all let's just look let's just um and by the way i'm using the original why won't my phone work why won't it work to connect it's like i just keep doing it again and again thinking it's just gonna work this time you know what i'm gonna do i'm going to turn off my phone i'm going to restart my phone and uh see if that helps obviously i'm not going to restart the pc that'll be although i wonder if i can i really should i'm so stubborn i really shouldn't try this stuff while i'm live streaming epocam viewer let's open that up oh camera in use by another application oh that's weird um i bet you i could fix this but i gotta i gotta i gotta not not do it okay uh all right so let's do let's do view details okay so we see there's uh just this batch script a batch script is basically a text file do you think i could look at it uh edit yeah this is what it does bin jerry cp i'm sorry that i can't zoom in on this for you i could probably like through obs make this bigger but hopefully you can see it this is running pde.jar so even from the beginning from the very beginning pde processing development environment this is the original java command i don't know what echo off does does that mean don't bother to like spit out stuff to the command line but this is what it runs and you'll see here it's running these compiled java files which are here in as jars inside of the lib folder and there's always fun things to look at in here go back to details here like we can see here if i open up this these are all the original like icon designs just what did this just open this up in i don't know right you can see i want to like i'm trying to do all my mac commands these are all the original icons just right there in one single gif file that is really wild to see look at the colors and the looks of them what this idea of a play button uh a new you know obviously a play button is not a new concept but the idea of using it um can people see this okay um if my audio is not working somebody says i think it's just the audio from the computer but that's fine um windows 8 um okay so um you can see pde properties fonta dbn.pde what is that that can i open this with something uh like text edit is there like a notepad or something on this computer notepad yeah ah this is oh that's dbn the very first program that's what it's actually going to open up i'm curious about this stuff all right all right without further ado what's in bin just some java you stuff some dlls good old dlls okay i'm going to run it now i can't click click there we go look there it is uh the original version of prostate so let's try to write some code so first of all i have no idea i love that it says there's no logo it says processing up in the top um we've got setup look at this can you see that that says i i know it's so small are there preferences can i can i raise the font size uh dbn stands for design by numbers that is correct asks um esteban um so one thing you'll notice here is void loop we could all be living in a world right the multiverse is is i don't know you know the multiverse of madness right what if not not to just make too many marvel references here um but uh the original there's no syntax highlighting but before there was draw there was loop and i guess if you've ever used arduino um i have from time to time you know things tend to explode or light on fire when i use arduino but um loop was the original name for the draw function because it is as i have said probably a hundred a thousand times in intro coding tutorials setup is the part of the program that runs once at the beginning loop is the part that runs over and over again so let's just actually run this sketch now and look there it is and i'm moving my mouse and look at it it's like a window with no borders no fanfare can i make it bigger let's see i'm let's make it uh bigger let's do 640 by 480. i don't know what color color scale must be like color mode oh it made the color scale 100 because the pixel width is 100 so if i do this i would want to make it and i would love to take your suggestions in the chat now for what i should try to code so i should make it 640 now does with work was with a builtin variable at the very beginning let's see syntax error unexpected token oh i forgot my semicolon too many years of moving to javascript whoa what's going on oh flickery flackery that's not 640x480 well i have a bug report can somebody please find me the um what would have been cvs subversion repository do i do i send my bug report by carrier pigeon how do i how do i get to 2001 ben fry this bug report of uh this not working all right let's try let's go back to could i just want to try let's try like the color scale like width is that one messed it up let's go back to color scale 100. oh my god i can't i've never typed so slow or move the mouse so slow in my life oh look at this we're getting some weird like yellow and stuff very interesting in dbn you could only use grayscale colors just being able to choose rgb colors and processing was mindblowing thank you stig so let's go back now to uh all right let's let's try let's try some other stuff i i think i should quickly move on to like version like release like 68 or something which is only like six months later because there's you know background zero let's see does line work line zero zero uh 200 200 let's see the stroke work look there's no it doesn't automatically indent where's my auto format ctrl t no oh i hit control r worked oh do you see that line oh the color scale is 100 oh but background zero what i don't understand i don't understand i don't understand how to code and processing version one okay should we move on should we move on uh size oh is it size height width it seems like it might be look at that is its size was height first oh my god shocker scandalous okay do you guys hear that buzzing it's not the hummingbird that lives outside my window that loves its little hummingbird feeder it's like probably a large carpenter bee it's terrifying okay oh my god scary okay nope 300 200 now that worked 100 equals 255 but why is background zero giving me let's just try like 10. i there we go whoa it's it's revert it's inverted right now i'm getting lower numbers to be white and higher numbers to be black amazing uh look at this look at this beautiful thing that we've done um so mark is saying lower the desktop resolution that is an excellent idea but hold on we're not done well i'm going to close this out let's go so i don't know if i should skip right ahead to um processing version oh i have three here let's try three i don't i didn't realize i had version three here i don't know what happened to version two let's try version three see what changed looks pretty similar so i don't see uh it's not obvious now i don't know if i have i don't think there were changes.txt files or anything like that that i could look at temporary so let's go okay so first of all let me get my thumb drive so this was also an adventure for a while i couldn't get any this laptop this thinkpad to recognize any thumb drive but let me copy um some more versions um so if you will uh bear with me for a second um oh you don't hear the music i forgot um i'm just going onto my mac laptop now obviously i should have done this in advance does anybody have a request of what version you would like to see i would copy them all let me i wonder if i can unzip files on the pc let's find that out i don't think so let me let me unzip oh let me unzip this bunch a bunch six seven you know i'm just going to do them all 8 9 11 12 13 14 15 here would you like to see what i'm doing so right now i've got my directory of all versions of processing and uh i am unzipping them because i'm not sure if my windows computer will do this i mean i'm not going to sit through and run every single one of these maybe there's some i guess i uh and i wish i could figure out how to get the dates of these oops whoa um here now you can probably there we go ah what's happening look at this you can see different versions from mac os 9 naso mac os 10 sensibly zip let's see all right let's go to like 83 81 let's just go to some of these at the end here all right that's pretty good where is my thumb drive can't unplug any of these things okay the number of adapters that i've tried and had to use over okay there we go now let's see uh desktop this is four gig no problem and by the way i have over here uh which i um processing a version of one of you know eventually there was release 1.0 um and uh so i want to run before i leave today 1.5 2.2 and 3.5 so a version of one two three and then for the grand finale we've got um processing um uh processing four uh all right i'm looking at the chat ah don't forget to stretch and drink some water yes okay wait wait wait wait wait as i'm copying this stuff wait how long is it gonna take 39 minutes what [Laughter] no you gotta be kidding me oh usb 2.0 this is not good okay we're gonna pick and choose okay clearly i should have done this before today but you know you know how it is with me did i mention that i was moving the kids are making themselves breakfast this month's noon it should be lunch by now late schedule okay um hold on a sec let's be a little bit more strategic about this what should we do like prime numbers uh go by base two let's see um desktop processing alpha all right let's start here with uh version three let's look at some let's let's do these early ones five six seven eight nine eleven should be faster i think like there's a bunch of mac versions which are huge probably or let's go like now to um 16. 16 32 32 64. 68 i know is one that i used quite a bit and if you if we go back onto um wayback machine i believe oops what happened to 64. okay let's try 65. all right we're going to 65 68 i already have there 70 let's grab some of the 80s well let's grab 84 which is the most recent the the latest oldest one i have okay this shouldn't take i don't know why it's saying it's going to take so long all right while we're doing this while we are doing this um maybe i shouldn't have like set a bunch to go at once is that like kind of slowing it down while we're doing this let's go back to the wayback machine because i think it's interesting to look at the website you're gonna there's some really excellent um nuggets we're gonna find so i'm gonna go to um let's see i'm gonna go back to whoops here just uh so we're back to the wayback machine i'm going to now click ahead to may 2003 so we're getting close around then might have been when i first saw processing and look at this look at this beautiful website again this is the same website as this right this is sorry this this website is the same as i mean the current version of this so let's see what we can find so first of all we can find some early stuff so um so processing was used as a tool this is in may of 2001. wait how is that possible oh no this must be is this european dating like december 1st 2005 no or december 5th 2001 must be that right yeah because there's no month 14. okay european dating so december 5th 2001 processing was used as a tool for exploring the intersection of the physical and the virtual in nas 968 a course in computational media design talked by john maida at the mit media lab anybody in the chat at mit sitting in this course i would love to know what's the chance of that um okay december 14 2001 over the course of two evenings ambitious students at the interaction design institute evreya in italy took part in an exploratory processing workshop anybody here from the old days of the interaction design institute in ivraya please shout out in the chat january 12 2002 processing workshop at hyper work now what's the chance i'm just curious that any of these links work i mean they are going to uh way back machine we can see the interaction instant uh the interaction institute here is the hyperwork amazing to see i just love the wayback machine okay let's move on uh we could look at the examples reference info i'm curious about info actually that um so here's more about info and let's look at download out of curiosity here so right this is why uh most of these versions that i have you will not find ah angelo from ivrea yay uh um so the um so most i'm looking for where the first download is available so that's one of the things i'm trying to keep my eye out for how are my file copying going a minute 23 minutes three hours i think this will all speed up once these other ones finish probably should have done them more one at a time okay it's 12 10. uh liz and ivory that's great oh you heard the b okay um all right so let's go back to uh here i'm going to keep moving along here eventually we're gonna switch oh no eventually i need to switch to processing.org i don't know when that switch happened oh look this is so sad there's supposed to be like a java applet here um now we're going to september 2003 maybe am i there already no i'm in june 2004 start june 2002 processing 1.0 alpha was it actually called 1.0 alpha at one point that's oh that's amazing um so you can see here the origins of both the mit media lab where ben frye was and the um working on his phd dissertation and the interaction design institute in ivrea where um casey was i believe um version oh os x interesting so i should be able to run some of these versions but i guess they're os x on powerpc there was a two day parisian workshop in 2002 posters exploring genomic cartography exhibit in london i just love seeing the track of all these the list of all these happenings ah now we're getting good we can see a bunch of these early examples so these are early examples which we should be able to run on these early versions of processing you can see look at this example's forthcoming oh oh beautiful i'd love to see all this future categories or include uh did all this come to to fruition artificial life information visualization emergent systems adaptive interface sound synthesis anybody ever use sonia a really early sound library by amit pataru that's a great one that i think we'll see appearing getting started nope okay so i think this must be where i can move to processing.org let's go back because i think i'll get better traction if i look for processing.org at a certain point um and let's go back we were in like 2003. maybe let's try 2004. yeah here we go look at this now we're starting to see the exhibition so let's look at the early stuff in the exhibition oh i want to look at these essays so this is really beautiful to see some of these early projects by names you may or not may not recognize um oh i love i remember this by julia stunnat this bees project is really beautiful view source no that's sad so most of these probably won't oh moovel i remember jared tarble a real pioneer in generative art um so and you can see here um there's all these uh the exhibitions all of these projects um listed here let's go to download are we do we have download yet yes oh we're on version 87 already so this is where if you want to try running one of these you know good luck to you if you're going to try to download the mac os x version i mean uh may 2005 i assume there's no way this is going to work for me but usually like oh yeah it's a stuff it file but um you i i definitely if i go back you'll find version 68 was here um but we can keep going here i guess we're in 2005 now oh we're in beta processing's in beta you can start to see the design of the website changing sign up for an email list let me get also let me find let me just i'm just moving to this for a second because i'm going to find the code for the new processing logo which i have in discord i think if i go into the live chat alco where did you send that to me scrolling scrolling ah got it okay um so i have the um live chat i'm sorry i have the uh the code for the logo right now let's just see first of all while we're here let's see if this runs in processing version 1.5 uh which i would love somebody to like look up and oh okay no no no no problem i i where i was running this earlier that's so weird um open i could have sworn i was running this okay no fail see this is the bra i could have sworn i was running this one earlier on this mac maybe it was on a old different mac of mine all right let's go to uh let's go to processing two let's see if we can get uh and i'm probably gonna have the same thing let's open let's see if we can get processing too oh yay processing two runs on my modern mac uh let's just see if the logo works in this version processing doesn't look too different probably from what you see now and yes there we go we have got so we know for a fact that the processing logo will appear as written in code in version two i'm not sure why 1.5 is not running for me right now so let me get this let me just make a little text file um boy i had so many ambitions of doing so much more today than i thought it was going to do let me save this onto the thumb drive as logo.txt and uh let me save that onto the thumb drive save and let's see how's my copying going about a minute about an hour oh what have i done everybody stretch this like alan writes this is like looking at baby pictures of a friend uh on their birthday yeah and the grim says are you running catalina is p1 a 32bit app maybe incompatible with the strictly 64bit yeah come on old versions i did not anticipate this slow copying why is it so slow all right hold on i'm going to uh take some more drastic action here or should i should i should i i should exercise some patience all right let's let's take a look while this is copying let's take a look at processing four because i can definitely do this all right processing for everything we always wanted in wait it says rustic 3.5.4 at the top how do i know if this is really oh because i have that open oh you know what this was not processing too what is going on okay hold on don't save did i had processing open already there we go i knew that was like not processing two now we've got processing two sorry about that false alarm and and and i was getting that correctly from the chat was telling me yeah so i should definitely try copying the zips instead can i i must be able to let me check on my windows machine i must be able to extract a zip file right i don't have one we're about to find out i'm going to let this yeah let's let's take let's cancel this one cancel this one these should really be done super fast uh all right we're now gonna try running the processing new logo on processing version two this is 2.2.1 let's see all right we know that it works on version two uh windows file explorer should be able to open zips natively all right so i i should be less uh precious i should everyone's telling me close out come on cancel cancel cancel these are so close i don't want to cancel all of them stopping come on stop i mean what's taking so long here people 21 items 20. i just want to let this finish because it's so close so zip should be findable for windows 2000 windows file explorer should be open to zips natively all right everyone's telling me this but i cannot stop i just have like a minute left of these then i'll go and get zips um all right so let's move back over to let's look at version 68. let's move back over to the other machine okay here we go all right i'm on uh so let's try something here let's try to make this bigger for people and i do have kind of like i do have to finish by oh i'm okay ideally 12 30 but somehow i don't think that's going to happen uh control panel display oh it's so hot can you guys hear like the i think it's the cicadas do you guys hear that um i'm basically outdoors uh and eventually i'll have a setup where you can sort of see the outdoors i have a plan but um okay settings uh let's go to let's try 800x600 okay no signal oh oh obs but i can enlarge this in obs so just give me a second here uh where am i where am i oh no what happened oh it went back because i didn't click okay should i go to 640 by 480 that should be fine let's hit yes okay now this should make it easier for it to see now how do i do this laptop that's the laptop unlock put it in the corner here like there and then make it big this is going to totally mess it up when i go back to my mac but too big this should help everybody see it oh it finished copying it's got a little sound effect in my ear okay okay this should be good oh it's like a little bit smaller so you can just want to get the whole thing on screen okay great so now we've got um this much bigger it's 640 by 480 oh my god this is gonna be so hard to use let me get my thumb drive which finished copying let me get um i'm just gonna copy some zip files also like arbitrarily i'm arbitrarily picking like um 52 uh now i'm just like picking random ones i only had like some kind of random number generator at my disposal i'm just copying a few more because why not estimated time remaining estimated time remaining it won't tell me but it's already a quarter of the way through oh you can't hear the music i always forget i could play it out through the speakers then the microphone would catch it alright i'm almost there everybody we're almost there let's look at processing 68. so look at this we've got oh there's fun things to see here because we've got little bits of source code we can start first of all let's look at oh this is my favorite thing ever so let's look at the readme come on open up read me okay by the way i always said if there was a pulitzer prize a pulitzer prize given out for code comments release notes ben frye should win this prize okay release notes and developer soapbox herein follows lots of random notes about the alpha release hold on the alpha release of processing more uptodate details can be found in revisions.txt and if you think i'm not going to read to you revisions.txt you're wrong i'm reading that which has notes about individual releases um you'll have to pardon the chatty detail in some spots as this will also serve as a response to many of the frequently asked questions that we have getting started doubleclick the processing application select something from the examples menu file open examples hit the run button which looks like the play button on a vcr or a tape deck lather rinse repeat as necessary thanks to the many people who have been helping us out it's huge i'll get a nice long list of y'all in here soon at least until the final 1.0 version which if someone could get me the date of that i would love to hear it we'll be using four digit numbers for the release this is why they're calling revision0043 the first alpha so 0 0 4 3 is the first alpha so that's one i should definitely look at i'm copying that one i think i actually did that one coincidentally yeah i did that one that one is on the thumb drive so let's remember to look at that there will be a few more numbered releases leading up to a beta release uh i found a bug a cultured software elite such as yourself should use the gentleman's term issue okay this was a different time first be sure to check under the notes for your specific platform to make sure it isn't a known issue or that there isn't a simple fix look at this note avoid the urge to just email us at processing media.mit.edu okay does that oh casey reese in the chat hi casey um all right well will that go where will that go now somebody now actually maybe don't maybe don't let's see does that email casey's in the chat if we send an email does it go there um while you may prefer the privacy of an email it's much quicker for you to ask the whole gang who are super helpful so this is 1.0 is january 17th 2004. thank you jonathan sims appreciate that um wow in my mind 1.0 was like 2009. but i'm just like it seems so much okay all right i can read it from here uh where was i next check the b board the b board there was a b board a bulletin board it's just the discourse our best math is opposed to the bulletin board the bulletin board at processing.org discourse we prefer for you to use the b board b board for bugs since we like to use the b board as a way to track bugs casey and ben can't always respond quickly to email you know who's also terrible responding quickly to the email thank you acting um and there are several knowledgeable people on the b board if you want to go straight to the bugs page it's oh my god i really want to go straight to that page i really want to go straight at that page i don't think it will work we can find out the way back between we're reporting this bug please include information about what the revision number operating system this this all still applies details are the error which may be the last few lines from the files standardout.txt or standarderror.txt from the lib folder stranger errors you may also look inside the build folder which is an intermediate translated to java version of your code i have so much to say about all of this this by the way i'm now realizing i've got this this could be like you know 100 hours of live streaming content just going through all of this stuff we want the minimum amount of code that will still replicate the bug so by the way this is all still really good advice like basically like all of this still applies uh to filing a github issue in today's modern times occasionally we may need you to pack up a copy pack up a copy of your sketchbook hold on i'm gonna pack up get my bag over here gonna gather all my papers and print out my code and pack it up into my bag and bring it somewhere um to replicate the weirdness on our own machine like right you couldn't just like what did you do you had to pack it up in like a zip file and could you even email that as an attachment would you mail a what were those things called those those are zip drives actually those are called um rest assured we have no interest in messages especially with your own fancy creations or stealing your ideas the p5 team is a bear but this is really from a different era straight lays boys who help from the midwestern us who are brought up better than that as we often lack enough time to build our own projects the the nuggets that are in these old readmes are just amazing goodies and semihidden features shiftclick on the run button to go straight to present mode for quick renaming just click on the sketch title the processing belmont runs best on windows 2000 that's right people windows 2000 windows is the superior platform for running java applications it's not because we like windows the best sorry to the zealots and all other courses like can you believe what's in there this is like a treasure trove of like pros poetic pros uh we all think osx will be a great bet for the future and apple's putting all their people weight behind it yeah how's that how's that working out for everybody so hopefully it will evolve somewhere developing the version for mac os 9 is a big headache but we think lots of people still use the crusty operating system the guess is that a lot of schools are still using in their labs and since schools are a significant target for the environment you got to play along windows 9598 emmy is a piece of crap but since lots of people are often forced to use it we'll try and support for the linux version you can support yourselves if you're enough of that boy this is like unbelievable uh minimum requirements processing requires at least mac os 10.1 i got to get some other old computers going but i could just read through all of these uh mac os 9 we've temporary services development for mac os 9 because we don't have time to fight with this dios before beta windows win2k and winxp ah yes this is interesting i remember this the release is now split between standard and expert versions because it comes with a working java virtual machine um but you could get the expert if you don't want to deal if you don't want to deal with the 20 megabyte download right oh my goodness the 20 megabyte download oh i'm going to go carry that over here 20 megabytes oh my god it's so much how i ever fit that onto my megabyte zip cartridge mouse issues by default windows seems to skip every other pixel on screen oh that's that's glorious video input oh my god who remembers this who remembers this this was like the bane of my existence for so long vdig.com win v dig oh my god v dig win v dick i used to have like flop usb drives or floppy drives or zip drives was like every version of windy dig and every version of quicktime on it to like get stuff to work uh all right all right i can't read all this it's just too great ah let's look at this this is good what is sketchbook so this i think also is i don't remember what design by numbers called a sketch for lack of a better term if it was called a sketch and design by numbers but to me this is also i think a really important um uh historical i don't want to say footnote it's not a footnote it's like a momentous thing to like to see this first naming of the idea of sketching with code and again i'm sure it was used prior to processing but definitely an early this early idea of a sketchbook integrated development environment so microsoft visual studio code world code warrior j builder those were the ides of the time tend to be overkill for the type of audience we're targeting with processing this is such a major thing for me for me i just remember i was working in visual studio code i was working in macromedia director which has its wonderful qualities but these are big bloated environments for this reason we've introduced the sketchbook which is a more lightweight way to organize projects as trained designers we'd like the process of coding to be a lot more like sketching look at this it's right there it's all there the sketchbook and the history menu under sketch are attempts in that direction why java oh this is going to be good i wish i could play my music this really needs like my sound effects and music it's fine the power of my voice will carry forward we didn't set out to make the ultimate language for visual programming we set out to make something that was a sketchbook for our own work simplifying the majority of tasks that we undertake a teaching environment for that kind of process and a point of transition to a more complicated or difficult language like fullblown java or cplus plus at the intersection of these points is a tradeoff between speed and simplicity of use if we didn't care about speed python or other scripting languages would make far more sense if we didn't care about transition to more advanced languages we'd get rid of the crummy c style well algol really syntax processing is not intended as the ultimate environment language in fact the language is just java but without another graphics api but with another graphics api and some simplifications it's just putting together several years of experience in building things and trying to simplify the parts that should be easier now i also believe i'm i'm missing um i'm missing another historical precedent to processing and i was not part of the mit media lab i was not there so i have no idea what i'm talking about but i believe there was an inhouse c plus plus um creative coding kind of package or library it had a name to it that was also kind of being developed and used at the time um and maybe that is one of the um the what's the word i'm looking for the the not pre the something that precedes open frameworks perhaps external files fonts reading data files why is it called processing at their core computers are processing machines they modify move and combine symbols at a low level to construct higher level representations processing allows people to control these actions and representations through writing their own programs the project also focuses on the process the process of creation rather than end results oh my god to me i mean it's like it sounds corny the journey it's not it's the journey not the end but this has been so true for me in everything that i do i never know where i'm going with coding an example or a tutorial or trying out an idea it always ends up somewhere different that process is so vital to the methodology the ethos the community spirit of uh the processing community and creative coding processing process of fiving is the spelling we formally use for the url processing.net being unavailable and while it's a combination of numbers and letters but it's simply pronounced processing you might also see p5 use the shorthand uh version of the name free to download free to use source code i mean i kind of want to read all this but let's get to let's get to the good stuff so let's check my thumb drive let's uh okay so we're about to um um i am about to eject it i ejected it done drive this is what i'm using uh works with that um i had to order this off of the internet because like none of my like this is my i don't know if you can see this can't see it the lighting is no good up here and my other camera my roving camera is not working i'm gonna plug this in okay okay welcome thank you for joining back as a member i have sort of um you know today i'm asking people to donate to the processing foundation so i'm not really going to plug the coding terrain membership but i thank uk um all right oh let's look okay i can't resist bugs uh this is this is like some fun stuff to read also it doesn't have line breaks in it revisions.txt i should look at that all right let's take a look at um where are we my computer removable disk d come on wake up thumb drive oh please work oh joseph has already made a processing name variation generator i've got to take a look at that okay so 43 did i extract that one no i did not so let's um i have so little space to work with in 640 by 480 43. let's try copying that to the desktop i mean this is giving me such like nostalgia this little like a copying bar i know i should be reading revisions.txt how am i going to read all of this i gotta my children need me to take care of them they're so everybody should send them like a cupcake or something oh oh my god my phone went off hopefully there's no so my emergency i mean they could walk out and find me uh they know where i am okay so let's right click on this we think that this is going to be able to extract extract files here oh i'm so silly all along this of course this works all right so this from what i understand based on the uh release notes this version um which is 68 no 43 that's three this version 43 is what is considered the first alpha release maybe i can't remember what it said i was reading those notes and my brain has melted um so let's run this now but hold on before we do that can i get another like finder window open this is so hard to use my documents no i don't want to go to my documents i want to get the i mean there's no way the logo uh works in processing 43 but by golly we're going to try oh my goodness like weird line break issues between different file formats okay so now we're gonna run processing 43 okay ah so news new we have a logo in the top left the p5 logo do we have a sketchbook there's no examples yet no no sketchbook no examples we do have a serial port option that is pretty exciting um right uh hold on important messages breaking news might be coming in i may have received messages yeah no kidding no kidding signal what is happening now why is my phone talking to me clubhouse open what hey hold on uh i'm getting breaking news breaking news on my phone i think uh processing 20 okay great great thank you i'm going to show this thank you okay um hold on uh all right so wait so let's see what's the chance oh gosh oh so painful that's right it's not that the code's not that long this is like a really fruitless endeavor but i'm doing it you can't stop me i mean there's something about these kind of like weird tedious tasks that i really enjoy mean i'm assuming these line breaks will be errors but or is it just me who can't stand to look at it it's not that many lines of code bezier i somehow i doubt bezier is going to work we're about to find out and probably do some kind of find and replace i'm almost there people no no don't delete enter oh no what did i do oh my god help me everybody don't no why is that not working it won't put a line break there okay oh because let's do this okay this is very silly what i'm doing because i don't know if i'll be able to save this but i should be able to copy paste it back into my text file hi everybody are you still watching i have no music to play no sound effects wait what is going on oh that's a for loop okay oh this is drawing the grid okay we're almost there people where's my auto format ctrl t ctrl s oh it saved it okay hold on we've got some weird oh yeah size void draw now let's look at this code what is the chance that this is going to run of course you know me i cannot tolerate code that's not indented properly i love the no syntax highlighting classic classic processing okay actually i think i'm this oh wait i'm missing a closed curly bracket here it looks like right and then i guess i could have gotten rid of the draw grid this is very important to me i must do this i will not be able to sleep tonight oh it is so hot okay everybody it's time we're going to attempt to draw oh and it was loop so uh you know i'd rather see the error but let's just change it to loop thank you for that that was tito in the chat um and hit save again so this is saved now we're gonna hit run everybody okay everyone everybody stretch take a deep breath we're gonna hit run we're gonna get errors we're gonna work it out stroke weight all right doesn't appear to be a method called stroke weight do comments work i can't tell they've got to work right that's a stroke weight okay no stroke weight in version 43. how did you how did anybody live no stroke cap okay that's fine where is it it's running is it behind the window no where are you wait a sec i think it didn't get too all right hold on a second everybody we're gonna have to debug this without stroke weight it won't work why not but i should at least see a window all right let's let's get something to appear background 255 let's make it red i cannot manifest it i see like a little window popping up let's see i sort of feel like all right hold on let's let's do this like is it behind it is it not fitting on the screen like this 640 by 480 thing is really messing me up so i think i might need to go at least 800 by 600 right oh the fan is worrying anybody have any ideas color scale might mess it up but i don't know i call in color scale how come i'm not getting a window 600 by 600 not possible oh yeah because the weakling 600 by 600 won't even fit on the no that didn't do anything all right what pro what was the address again sitting at me oh the bulletin board i could go report my bug to the bulletin board yeah windows key plus m to minimize all there's no windows key i don't have a what kind of computer do you think i'm on there's no windows key change size i changed the size you guys are a little bit behind me here all right all that effort um let's go to save sketch yes let's go to 68. we're going to go to 68 which i have used jikes bugs getting more messages um okay come on processing 68 okay so let's just first of all see if i get a window oh is it oh there it is look i got a window i got a sketch window i got a sketch window yay first sketch window all right now uh let's go back to oh how do i open is there a sketchbook yeah oh add file show sketch folder history use external editor look at all this stuff create font add file so much now present stop stop no no auto format i need my auto format oh was there a bug and maybe i wasn't getting an oh maybe i had a bug okay hold on don't worry here's the code now let's try running this and see what happens okay stroke cap square kill let's take this off comment this out look at this look at this everybody oh this is the processing logo running on um wow wow syntax highlighting too wow 68 is like a major new it's a whole new world so we can see the syntax highlighting happened um stroke weight is there bezier works all this stuff works so what was i going to do i was going to attempt to code do i do it edit edit beautify beautify control b beautify beautify is here ah amazing oh this is so amazing okay so let's go to 800 by 600 if you will all uh indulge me here in let's go to 800 by 600 so that we can see a bit more on screen i think you'll still be able to read the font um let's go to 800 by 600 i don't want the wallpaper no i guess i clicked on some wallpaper accent yes okay so here we are in version 68 and this is what we see now can we kind of what's i want to look at the logo i wish i had yeah so um so i have so much my mind is like exploding here um so let's see if stroke cap but it's like not does stroke cap a function do we have help reference come on come on open in the browser you can do it i remember processing used to come with a local copy of the reference but ah look at this 1.0 alpha this is the reference stroke weight stroke no stroke cap so i bet you i could get that same effect with just like an arc probably um like which is that the bezier curve yeah like and what's you oh is that the like is that a scaling factor like if i make this six oh there we go this is another way to let's it was 60 is that what it was i don't even remember now undo does undo work yeah so let's make that half 30 and make it 300 by 300. oh oh you're you're seeing it but it's um let me just bear with me for a second here let me allow you to see more of the computer there we go so sorry the font is so slow low small um but now let's run it okay early days of processing this is processing version 68. so the only thing that's not working for this new logo design is the is it's not the bezier curve the bezier curve works it's the uh stroke cap so let's put the bezier curve back and we can see that the curve with this thick stroke weight is like not joining the caps of it somehow properly with squares i'm just curious to try arc well let's just try is ellipse even a function in this version four times u one is that a 1 times u 5 times u 5 times u i don't know what i'm doing here okay ellipse works so in theory i could do an arc how could i get this without stroke cap an arc which goes from like negative pi divided by two to pi divided by two that would be similar ooh no method named arc no arc function i'm just curious what if we like used a smaller stroke weight just like four did it not seem so oh and had the bezier instead there we go this is my version of the new processing logo sorry put the stroke cap back yes oh no that's an old message is it one o'clock yet oh my god it's almost one o'clock i can't believe i've been doing this for two hours and this is all i've gotten to all right let's look at some more uh let's let's kind of scan through some more later versions of processing um and i'm just going to encourage you to make your own cake i'll get you started with it i'm going to i'm going to sort of race through some stuff here okay so where is my thumb drive we were just looking at 68. uh so let's go to 84 which i actually already unzipped so i can do this let's just look at 84 to see what that looks like i'm seeing messages here and hold on getting some breaking news here breaking news um there was a version zero on august 2nd that was a test run benfry.com bagel okay hold on hold on hold on everybody all right i have something else to show you all in a moment and i think we just got a donation i can't see the name of it okay so we are i'm attempting to run 84 and i might look at revisions.txt just to find some other glorious nuggets um where is processing 84 oh okay we're gonna try running did i just copy it then i just copy it here it is oh look at this new logo new logo faq uh processing beta no what's this oh that's css oh look at this what is this oh this is like the faq where can i download processing and how much does it cost how do i learn to use processing read some of the tutorials did i have any tutorials here yet i can't remember this is passed when i started teaching with processing i think oh my god this is there's so much great stuff here um this is not 1.0 software it's buggy and it may kill people i think we can say that no one has been cross fingers behind back throw salt all of that and processing is not uh it's not caused the death of anyone just yet okay people let's look people people look at these people oh simon greenwald doing some lighting in 3d documentation look at these names oh yes sony i was referring to hernando uh i'm just seeing names of people i recognize look at all these wonderful uh folks here um discourse um okay uh links all right so hold on we're gonna run this version of processing i wasn't looking for revisions.txt oh my god so hard faq java bin uh no i i just like to look through all the files to see like where all the like libraries maybe how to oh they're libraries now javascript what what year is this all right we're running this people oh no no okay let's try run. let's try this oh no sorry version 84. okay that was so sad uh let's try going to let's let's try uh could it be that i extracted it on the mac i don't think so though that's possible let's try 77. all right we're gonna try this has been fun folks i definitely have to wrap this up and i got to go back to reviewing all the links and things i was talking about so let's try let's just try 77 extract here okay version 77 yeah this looks more promising oh i feel it running yes version 77 we have running i wish i knew the date of this release uh to sort of like think about if this was one that i was using but uh we can go now we see uh sketch where did the examples show up sketchbook ah here they are sketchbook examples now we can start to see library video loading quicktime particles wait a second here oh this is simon greenwald's particle systems oh translate with a z coordinate can only be used with depth boy that i don't underst was that like was it this was the early p3d like no name depth sort no i don't know how to enable i don't know all right that was not an example that i could get to run little known fact simon and greedwald and i were uh college classmates and computational mama is in the chat everybody should check out computational mama's youtube channel and various amazing activities and fellowship all right sketch tools remember tools auto format we lost beautify we've auto format create font archive sketch okay renderer oh if i switch to opengl i have to switch the renderer it didn't work but that was exciting there was a menu option to switch to opengl i don't remember that but that is cool all right let's go to some different where was that again sketch renderer go to processing let's go to sketch examples i don't know why i tried to do a 3d example edit file sketch uh tools where were the examples i'm i'm losing my mind here a sketchbook here they are sketchbook examples spring i don't know why i'm no oh my god glenn murphy smoke completed november 2 oh look at this look at this oh look at this glorious examples of early i mean this is like everything that's in my nature code book now in like this crazy old code example with two dimensional arrays and vsquare this is like a fluid simulation smoke wow that's incredible drag the mouse it's running so slow but it's just beautiful this is from 2002 folks 30 000 particles in java and processing random gust does it have this purlin noise in this look at this code it is just glorious class particle oh lowercase class names amazing okay this is so fun to see all right let's try once again well let's make a new sketch let's try running this oh we've got the processing logo looking better now we've got it looking better now so if i go back to u equals 30 oh no and make it there we go and make it uh so stroke cap is now in version 77. there we go it's like it looks a little wonky but looking pretty good so here we go we've got the new processing logo running in processing 77 alpha i wish i knew the dates of these i'm not organized i'm a little bit exhausted now i've been streaming for two hours uh marcel bro thank you for your donation to the processing foundation all right i think i need to wrap things up here i kind of had so many ambitions of so much more stuff that i was going to do and get to run i think this has mostly been a success everybody can like snapshot this or share it on i don't know you know but i don't know what i hope i'm hoping people are enjoying this um um i um i want to look at a few i want to sort of wrap things up and say goodbye and kind of review a bunch of things about events are happening this weekend so i am going to switch back to my mac the only way i can do that is by changing the cable and then i need to do this transform reset transform there we go 77 is march 2005. thank you jonathan sims um really appreciate that all right so a couple things i wanted to note is um um if you want to really do a deep dive into the history of processing you should take a look at this page called bagel an architecture project i've been developing as a basis for some of my other work it's a 2d 3d rendering api that runs in java to cross between postscript style imaging and 2d and 3d rendering with opengl so bagel is the original graphics engine that is built inside of processing and if you actually look at some of the source code like you can actually um this might take me a minute to get to but i'm gonna do it anyway like if you go to the releases on github um there's got to be a better way for me to do this but i'm just going to keep hitting next until somebody in the chat tells me how to get to the oldest thing here you can definitely find good stuff here but i this is ridiculous what i'm doing i don't know how many pages there are eventually it's going to go a lot faster yeah and get to the end here there's like in the url i don't see any pagination and i don't know the names of things to say after so this is helpful for dating things i think yeah i think the dates are accurate here i mean github didn't exist so all this has been brought over but i want to go back i just want to go back 2008 2008 2008 2007 2007 2006. we're getting there people 99. ah whoa oh i exceeded a rate limit oh you're so mean to me oh the list of tags no don't you know i'm just an innocent person in a garage with a green screen and a computer who just can't be bothered to actually figure out the names of the tags to get to the right place and i'm just clicking through so cruel all right maybe somebody could give me the link to that last page uh in discord but what i was going to show you is you can find and uh i think you can find like java files called like bagel.java or pbagel.java uh interesting to note um and see um and so this this you'll definitely want to um take a look at um and you can see here this is back from summer of 2001. so this is a sort of early incarnation or name of um the processing project otherwise known i like to refer to it in a friendly way as onion bagel i don't know why but that's what i like to do after equals processing dash 68 i think it's not gonna well that should have been obvious to me there we go nope well i got to there anyway let's see if it'll this is going to rate limit me again 59 oh how far back am i going to be able to go here seven all right let's download this and see what's in there so i you know by the way i want to thank dusk uh who does a lot of work on coding train source code and website who really had the idea that's what i should do for the live stream is run early versions of processing and we can see here the bagelpublic.pl what is that oh we can look at some of this code let's look at let's look at um i don't know pde applet.java um visual studio code let's see what's in there because it's the player version cut out all the other crap so this file is as small as possible this is really oh dbm see dbn preprocessor so that's designed by numbers uh sort of um parent of processing in a way program karat equals not a scheme don't beautify if it's python not scheme i love the comments if beautify editor do beautify look some commented out stuff doesn't get any better than this this is used by pde fancy pde fancy what's pde fancy get up time to take a break yeah paint look at this pde fancy pde excess exception processing apples so i just want to look through all the stuff but i gotta i gotta i gotta be done what's in here bagel public bagel.java look at this look at this ancient code i don't know what this does i don't know what this does but i love it uh okay um look at this you can see the original buttons here are the original graphics the buttons from this version three of processing anyway i i obviously could go on and do this stuff forever i got to stop all right folks bringing things to a close here i want to do some reminders number one new processing website take a look enjoy it uh take a look at the thread from design systems international describing all about the new logo and the website um go to the processing foundation 20th anniversary community celebration page all the different events that are happening this weekend check them out a lot of them are virtual big shout out to tim rodenberger's community coming tomorrow if you are running if you are doing something on youtube please be in touch you can attach this um you can attach the fundraiser which we've raised 519 so far for the processing foundation um to your video if you like if you would like to contribute to help raise money to processing foundation um i can help you do that it's pretty easy actually if you just go to your youtube studio go to monetization giving join fundraiser search for processing you should find it um there's also the hick at nunc fundraiser i believe tomorrow there will be a zoom workshop of how to participate in this information somewhere uh uh i'll try to retweet this stuff from my twitter or i have been um i don't know if there's information here um thanks to all these people for organizing uh thanks to all of you for tuning in to this um what i wanted to do and i i unfortunately i'm just way out of time and let me actually run processing four you should download go to the new processing website go to download there is a 4.0 beta one there are new ways to report bugs and more information about supported platforms all the stuff we were looking at from 20 years ago is still there and i want to really run this version because i was not running it there we go um here we go processing ah look at this read about the status of the 4.0 release some sketches from processing two or three may not be compatible so i got to come back and do another live stream really diving into processing four it's not happening today i'm going to follow their instructions and click to create a new sketchbook and i'm going to make it just in in my documents file i don't know i guess i messed that up let's try that again let's make a new folder called uh processing four that should work maybe that didn't work i don't know what's happening let's just get started look at the new design some new colors what i wanted to do and let's just see if we can make the quickest version of this i wanted to make a birthday cake um you know for inspiration um you can see this wonderful uh birthday message that um everybody did uh not everybody sorry that um a bye simon and starbuck yeah made um i'm encouraging people to make their own celebratory processing in p5.js sketch um coming back to me here boy am i exhausted um we're gonna we're gonna do a really quick and dirty birthday cake okay it's going to be a two layer cake i'm not going to think about anything like color all of you are going to be assigned to make your own version of this and share it let's make the window i wanted to do this in the ancient versions of processing but let's do it in processing four as a celebration so let's say 100 300 500 100 fill so this will be the bottom of the cake i can't do math right now 400 there we go bottom layer now let's do a rectangle that's at uh 200 that is um starting at 200 that is just 300 wide i can't do math in my okay so maybe it should be 200 wide there we go i want it to be a little bit um so let's do 150 and 250 i think that should do it or i mean 300 that's what i've had 300 50 times two okay here's the start of our cake now i'm going to use a for loop we should put the logo right in there hold on let's go grab let's go grab this logo oh right i need to get it from the gist um so let's make a function called p5 logo let's put this in here um we don't need i don't want draw grid because i'm not going to draw the grid i don't want show grid or setup our background so let's say p5 let's just see where it puts it and so let's uh make it smaller and let's do um push i'm going to move it around with translate and rotate push matrix pop matrix and i'm sorry i'm standing in front of the code here push matrix translate uh i don't know is it centered probably is right so what did i make 300 let's just let's just guestimate let's move it back make a little smaller and move it down this feels like it's gonna be about right there we go uh there we go okay the processing cake with the logo on it that's good and now we just need a little for loop oh uh into x equals the top of the cake which starts at 150 x is less than 300. x plus equal so if the width is 300 and we need 20 candles um we need 20 candles is this going to be right and we just want to draw a rectangle from x comma where's the y here 200 minus let's try like 180 dx like half the candle will be like 20 percent of that size and it's just 20 pixels high what would i do wrong that 20 or is that 10. one two three four that's only ten three oh is it um is it because no i don't have floats what did i do wrong here people how do i get 20 candles 150 oh no no no the width is going all the way up to 450. there we go 155 455. okay look there's my 20 candles i'll make them a little thicker and a little taller all this stuff should be variables there we go here's my cake 20 candles now we're gonna put little we're gonna light them okay so we're gonna go to uh happy birthday this is the last thing i'm doing my poor children then i'm going to um i am going to what am i doing ah okay wait let's just see uh examples um add examples uh nature of code install just okay so now um let's go to and i could have used that original smoke example but i just know my code better so i'm gonna go to contributed examples nature of code systems i've updated these examples since but let's go to this one let's try smoke here great perfect this will be our candle so we just need particle and we just need particle system and now we need an array of particle systems we're going to call this we need 20 candles that are particle systems and i actually just need this same loop here and i should be saying um this is a terrible way to do it but it's the way i'm gonna do it can't stop me uh can't stop me because i've got to do this fast so i and let's call this i i'm kind of like i have a loop which is already giving me the right x positions so i'm just going to separately count i there's probably a way to put it inside the floor loop i'm going to say candles index i equals new particle system and uh x comma 150 would be the initial location is that not what it wants oh it needs an image oh let's do this without images because and i don't know why i wrote birthday with a capital d there i'm so used to so what we're gonna do here is just get rid of the image oh and it it needs a vector okay but that's fine we're gonna get rid of the image boy this is some old code this is not my updated version so also i need to say new vector xy and we're going to put just five particles in to start and then here instead of this we're going to say for every candle in candles candle dot add particle can't i don't remember what the functions are candle add particle candle run candle run uh new that's so weird and oh so particle doesn't have an image anymore but what just happened oh no wrong passer what's going on okay that was just a momentary hiccup boy this is all well don't look at this code i gotta update it it's all using some old processing stuff my examples are updated uh yep so let's just do it with a circle because i want to make them maybe no image no image uh this circle should be i don't know 16 16. there we go look at that oh i need the lines i got rid of the lines why did i get rid of the lines uh where's my dx let's just make that a global there's so many ways this could be improved there we go here's my processing cape i made it yes now the question is oh no i have to make a p5 version of this okay everybody i gotta go happy birthday processing i what i'd like to do is i would like to so i'm gonna figure out a way uh join the coding train discord follow me on twitter at some point today um i'm gonna get this code how can i get this out there right now ah i know what to do so just give me a second here i'm going to open up discord so if you're not in the coding train discord i am going to uh just go to thecodingtrain.com discord um and then here um in the discord um i have a channel called links and what i'm going to do right now is i'm just going to come on columns uh compress this i think it'll let me do this i'm hoping discord will let me do this i'm just going to share uh birthday processing birthday cake so for those of you who want to grab that code right now if you oh and i'm in the i'm not on the screen if you join the discord uh the coding trend and i'll get this in a better places like somehow like linked from the video description or on social media later but i've gotta run so if you join the coding train discord the discord uh you have to go uh to the um read me and like react to the code of conduct and then you'll see all the channels if you go here under links you'll see uh the birthday cake code um i will make a p5 version of it uh at some point i want you to add color to it make it your own make your own version of it share it on twitter on instagram on discord on youtube wherever um join for all of the events um happening this weekend um here they are um advocacies uh processing foundation.org advocacy pcd 2021 i'm hoping to raise 2
