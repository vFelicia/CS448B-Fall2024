00:00 - [Music]
00:14 - hello again welcome to the wasting time
00:17 - portion of the Kotick train my name is
00:22 - Dan Schiffman and I have about 40
00:24 - minutes before I have to go I just
00:26 - finished an hour of code tutorial and
00:28 - the camera of course just shut off where
00:30 - I made this project that tracks your
00:34 - nose it tracks your nose with P 5 ml 5
00:38 - and the PostNet model and I'm here now
00:41 - to waste your time because I have a
00:43 - bunch of things I want to experiment
00:45 - with and discuss but you should probably
00:47 - just go about with your day um if I can
00:49 - manage their good a quoting challenge in
00:51 - before I go I would like to do that so
00:53 - one thing I want to test here and I
00:56 - don't know why this isn't working let me
00:57 - try refreshing this again alright so I'm
00:59 - planning by the way it's probably gonna
01:01 - be December 20th I am planning a
01:05 - fundraiser for the processing foundation
01:08 - processing foundation org if you're not
01:13 - familiar with the processing foundation
01:14 - the processing foundation is the non for
01:17 - profit entity that that that manages the
01:22 - processing project p5.js processing on
01:25 - Python and also a lot of community and
01:28 - education initiatives around art and
01:30 - code and all sorts of stuff so read the
01:32 - mission statement come hang out with us
01:34 - at any number of processing days around
01:40 - the world which is happening in 2019 and
01:45 - I will be at processing Los Angeles and
01:48 - hopefully at pressing NYC as well
01:50 - alright that aside I wanted to figure
01:52 - out I have this processing is a 501c3
01:55 - non for profit and this setting I don't
01:59 - see it I wanted to enable super chat for
02:00 - good to see if I can to see if I can
02:08 - figure out how to get live donations and
02:10 - then I can also build something which
02:12 - actually shows the live chat but maybe
02:15 - what I first need to do hold on them so
02:17 - what I'm doing over here is I'm in my
02:18 - admin panel and I maybe I'll just build
02:24 - something that manually pops up
02:26 - something when there's a super
02:28 - but why do I not have going to I'm going
02:32 - to live streaming I'm going into events
02:37 - a live edit there's 214 of you
02:46 - apparently watching right now
02:48 - and under advanced settings under chat
02:55 - it's not there so they I used to have an
02:57 - option that was super chat for good and
02:59 - I could enable the processing foundation
03:01 - so nevermind I wanted to test that now
03:03 - I'm gonna have to figure that out and
03:04 - test that another time oh look it's me
03:07 - with googly eyes thank you - Bruno
03:10 - Ruchika who made this a wonderful sketch
03:12 - all right so let's close all this out
03:16 - the other thing that's goofy oh okay so
03:19 - I don't know what to do now hello how
03:23 - are you
03:24 - hopefully that hopefully that yeah I
03:28 - should make you know what I should do
03:30 - for the fundraiser is on the fundraiser
03:33 - I should write ap 5 sketch that
03:36 - communicates with the YouTube API and
03:38 - like makes a little like heart or
03:40 - something whenever somebody makes a
03:41 - donation but you need to get that super
03:43 - chat for good thing working ok so well
03:49 - if anybody knows if I mean I I'll
03:50 - contact YouTube but if anybody knows
03:52 - about that or has worked with the
03:54 - YouTube API actually I know you can
03:58 - write bots and things for the chat so
04:01 - that's actually probably what I that's
04:02 - that's something I should look into and
04:03 - do so what can I do right now I'm at 35
04:06 - I had this idea actually this is
04:07 - probably insane to try to do this I'm
04:10 - doing like a flocking simulation let's
04:21 - go to coding train on github Oh am I not
04:28 - will signed in
04:30 - I'm gonna need my authentication here
04:43 - [Music]
04:45 - let me look up the Authenticator oh I'm
04:53 - I'm streaming and recording so weird and
04:57 - go down here hit sign-in oh no that's
05:04 - that's not my password that's my ah now
05:14 - everybody knows my authentication code
05:16 - but it's already gone alright let's go
05:20 - here only 871 871 ideas regarding your
05:31 - previous stream if you define a 2d shape
05:33 - in relation to the points surely you can
05:35 - in 3d as well yeah absolutely
05:40 - alright no I really I have no plan
05:48 - nothing whatsoever Schrodinger equation
05:51 - create a gaffing revisiting pixel
05:54 - sorting would love to do the quicksort
05:58 - coding challenge right now but I don't
05:59 - think I'm going to triple pendulum chain
06:01 - we're actually marching cubes ooh that
06:03 - would be a good one stolen necklace
06:05 - drunken bishop spiral map projection
06:09 - coding challenge maybe what we could do
06:16 - you know I have this like weird idea
06:17 - that I would like to do which is because
06:22 - infinite recursion into the TV thing I
06:24 - feel like we should just program that
06:26 - that would be fun I was doing video
06:29 - stuff but I don't know
06:35 - plotter soft body simulation Roman
06:40 - numerals clicking on object in 3d space
06:41 - lizard visualization what is that of a
06:47 - movement of a lizard
06:48 - the lizard should have a triangle like
06:50 - head body legs should go to the point
06:52 - where them is very specific should go to
06:55 - the point it should go to the point
07:02 - where the mouse was clicked the hard
07:05 - part will be the way the lizard moves it
07:07 - should turn and move at the same time
07:08 - and travel the least distance ideally
07:12 - when the lizard is facing one direction
07:13 - and when mouse is clicked it should
07:15 - start moving like a real lizard
07:16 - resetboys okay I don't think I'm gonna
07:20 - get to this right now
07:20 - so I don't know why but in my head this
07:22 - morning I thought I should do the
07:24 - flocking as a coding challenge
07:27 - Boyd's Boyd's chance look I even assign
07:33 - this no there's no thumbs-up on this one
07:35 - I'll give it a thumbs up could this be
07:38 - done in a half an hour that's the
07:40 - question why come on github come on
07:43 - computer may refresh the page it doesn't
07:46 - even want to let me give it a thumbs up
07:48 - yeah there we go how many thumbs up how
07:53 - many thumbs up can I get on this page
07:55 - right now I'd like to see clock at
07:58 - destined Dustin is destined Destin's
08:01 - office from smarter every day I don't I
08:04 - didn't I don't know about that clock
08:05 - from smarter every day but but I'm
08:10 - always interested oh right we do a do
08:14 - weird complex number math on the image
08:16 - to make that spiral pattern in Matt
08:18 - Parker's videos I also want to do I want
08:23 - to do some like fluid dynamic stuff
08:25 - because I have been watching a lot of
08:26 - the smartereveryday videos about
08:31 - shockwaves and I think that would be an
08:34 - interesting thing to do a shockwave
08:36 - visualization oh I think that no
08:42 - nobody's thumbs up in this
08:45 - just me I'm the only thumbs up emoji -
08:48 - yes all right come on everybody by the
08:58 - way this is my this is my live stream
09:01 - for if I can get that to ten I'm gonna
09:04 - do it this is my live stream for the
09:08 - week tomorrow I'm actually doing some
09:10 - school visits for hour of code which is
09:13 - gonna be fun we got to number five for
09:16 - six and what I wanted to say by the way
09:21 - I am planning Obama's night okay are
09:30 - there any oh let's check if there's any
09:31 - coding faces tweets and please do I'm
09:36 - just going to I'm now always afraid I'm
09:41 - afraid of the internet so I'm going to
09:44 - the coding faces page oh look at this
09:46 - we have got some you've got one from
09:50 - Carol oops here we go
09:58 - Carol posted Carol d @d r ka ro L on
10:04 - Twitter three minutes ago posted my
10:05 - first ml experiments with coding faces
10:09 - awesome what number are we at now 15
10:12 - okay - thumbs down this is really like
10:32 - wild to me to see this happen 2200
10:35 - people are watching all right but I have
10:37 - to I have to go I have a meeting to be
10:39 - at do you think we could do the flocking
10:41 - all right let's get prepared we'll check
10:44 - back on coding phases
10:46 - let's get prepared to do this so
10:49 - flocking video
10:51 - Schiffman let's see if that comes up a
10:53 - little bit that's interesting I don't
10:58 - know
10:59 - let's go Craig Reynolds steering no not
11:05 - videos oh let's original 1986 Boyd
11:09 - simulation awesome
11:11 - I want this page
11:15 - Boyd's here we go and then nature of
11:19 - code read now a ton of agents here we go
11:37 - what those diagrams are better here we
11:39 - go here we go okay all right
11:46 -  okay so I've got my references I
11:53 - have got
12:03 - [Music]
12:06 - and here and we're gonna do this I think
12:11 - this requires I don't want to do this in
12:15 - the web editor I think there's too much
12:16 - involved with the complexity of this
12:19 - that that I think what I want to do is
12:32 - use us I'm just gonna run my own server
12:45 - way the console and I am going to oh hey
12:56 - I already have the code editor open I'm
12:58 - gonna get rid of this and someday I'm
13:03 - gonna like make myself a little template
13:05 - here but today is not that day oh I need
13:11 - the CDN
13:25 - and let's just in case I need the Dom
13:29 - library let's get this and let's get
13:39 - shot Jay s so just give it a fixed-size
13:45 - background everyone and what's going on
13:55 - here
14:00 - Oh No Oh tonight
14:06 - can I reset the bra I think I reset the
14:08 - browser here and yeah this is not
14:13 - selected anymore there we go so now this
14:23 - can be minimized I don't need that open
14:27 - I don't need this open and don't say
14:34 - don't save so and then here this so how
14:43 - am i doing I'm standing here that's good
14:46 - so I'm not in front of the code so I can
14:49 - actually do this sighs and I've got this
14:54 - here which can actually also be over cuz
14:57 - it can just be above me there we go
15:03 - and look some more room in the console
15:10 - okay perfect
15:12 - all right 32 all right we're gonna do
15:19 - the flocking the Boyd's challenge this
15:21 - is definitely gonna take a longer than a
15:23 - half an hour this is a really
15:25 - complicated complicated project Simon
15:32 - yes I know I haven't redone the beginner
15:34 - p5 tutorials I think I may be me I need
15:36 - to schedule a time to do more of those
15:39 - okay so let me actually just go to oh
15:51 - this is what I'm looking for by the way
15:58 - here we go all right
16:04 - why is that so slow
16:10 - let's open up processing oh shoot
16:28 - [Music]
16:53 - [Music]
17:39 - [Music]
18:16 - so yeah like I kind of put an image
18:18 - behind me that'll be interesting it's
18:20 - like I'm spending forever tweaking heads
18:23 - it was really wasting time when I should
18:25 - just be coding
18:28 - [Music]
18:45 - all right
18:51 - okay I think I'm ready now
19:09 - okay the house definitely gonna need the
19:14 - whiteboard so let me erase that
19:26 - okay let me just send a quick message
19:39 - here let me let me just send a quick
19:58 - message that I need to send sorry hold
20:00 - on just I'm gonna be a little late
20:17 - okay all right close enough close enough
20:27 - should get some water but whatever we're
20:29 - just gonna we're gonna move forward with
20:30 - this just let me just it's just that
20:40 - like a few more and make them theirs
20:43 - they're too big let's make them a little
20:45 - bit smaller
20:50 - Oh perfect now it's perfect
20:55 - okay hello welcome to a coding challenge
21:01 - in this coding challenge I am going to
21:03 - attempt a program using the p5 library
21:06 - from starting from no code except for
21:08 - the what we're chance yeah I have this
21:13 - like hang-up where when I say from
21:14 - scratch people are always the youtube
21:16 - knowledge well it's not actually from
21:17 - scratch because you and yours it the p5
21:19 - library huh you know what what what what
21:22 - can I do here we go hello welcome to
21:35 - coding challenge I am going to in this
21:37 - coding challenge make this this is a
21:39 - processing sketch thank you
21:47 - 72 475 okay have a random number
21:50 - everything's gonna be fine
21:52 - let me cycle the camera what's the
21:54 - chance that I can be done in a half an
21:55 - hour very very little chance well so I
21:59 - haven't eaten lunch this is not gonna go
22:01 - well hello welcome to a coding challenge
22:07 - in this coding challenge I probably
22:09 - should go eat lunch but I'm gonna just
22:10 - try this coding challenge I am going to
22:13 - attempt to program this this is a
22:14 - flocking simulation what you're seeing
22:16 - right now is an example that I made many
22:18 - years ago of a flocking simulation a
22:21 - void system running in processing so I'm
22:24 - gonna try to make exactly this or close
22:27 - to it in JavaScript with the p5
22:29 - libraries
22:30 - from no code at all obviously besides
22:33 - the dependencies okay so this is the
22:36 - example running so let me just give you
22:37 - a leg Reynolds you can go to this link
22:40 - to read this explanation of it and if
22:44 - find many other links and resources down
22:46 - here well that's a lot of stuff have fun
22:48 - see you in a few weeks you can also
22:51 - check out this YouTube video of the
22:53 - original 1986 flocking simulation love
23:01 - that and you can also find an
23:03 - explanation of it as part of my nature
23:06 - of code book online with some diagrams
23:09 - and code written in processing and an
23:11 - exercise that you could try which I'll
23:12 - refer to back at the end but I am going
23:15 - to start from this a blank slate I just
23:18 - have a canvas you have some amount of
23:20 - pixels in it there is nothing happening
23:22 - in the console and I've got this code
23:26 - set up and draw alright so what do I
23:30 - need to do now there's definitely going
23:33 - to be a big need to refactor the code
23:38 - that I'm going to write so if you look
23:40 - at my example it's hopefully somewhat
23:44 - well-organized but I'm gonna
23:47 - [Music]
23:52 - Thank You Matsuya for for me alright let
23:57 - me just let me let me double back for a
23:58 - second so I'm gonna write this code
24:02 - without worrying about being like
24:04 - perfectly organized and and being able
24:06 - to scale it very easily I just want to
24:08 - try to get the algorithm working but of
24:10 - course
24:12 - where's the button and if you want to
24:15 - see a refactored example of any probably
24:18 - so in looking actually at my finished
24:20 - version in the nature code I'll also
24:21 - link to so the first thing that I want
24:24 - to do though is I want to add another
24:25 - JavaScript file called particle JSI
24:33 - actually you know what I should rename
24:34 - this to Boyd dot Jas so what is this
24:39 - term Boyd when Craig Reynolds invented
24:42 - this algorithm for simulating a flocking
24:45 - system like a flock of birds or a swarm
24:48 - of bees I suppose you didn't want to use
24:52 - the term bird but it is kind of like
24:54 - birds
24:55 - so Boyd it's kind of like droid but Boyd
24:57 - go read the original paper about
25:00 - steering behaviors and flocking systems
25:02 - and you'll find out more about the
25:03 - history about this but I am going to
25:05 - make a class called Boyd and I am going
25:10 - to use the p5 vector object and so eat
25:18 - this climbing to make Boyd objects and
25:20 - each each time I made a Boyd object I
25:23 - need a constructor and I am going to
25:25 - give each Boyd a position I'm going to
25:30 - give each Boyd a velocity and I'm going
25:36 - to give each Boyd and acceleration and
25:39 - all of those are going to be vectors so
25:41 - I'm doing this in 2d you should after
25:43 - you watch this if super you watch this
25:45 - you should make your own 3d version of
25:47 - this all the math will work exactly the
25:49 - same way but you'll just need to rethink
25:51 - how you're visualizing this and just to
25:55 - give things a start let's just put the
25:58 - the position like in the middle of the
26:01 - window
26:02 - and let's write a function called like
26:04 - show which will just draw them as a
26:07 - circle right now I'll just even use
26:08 - point like stroke weight 16 stroke 255
26:14 - point this dot position x2 I think
26:20 - visual studio code will do this for me
26:22 - no weird it fixed that for me once I had
26:27 - the enemy of whatever okay so this dot a
26:30 - pointer event well I'm not a pointer
26:32 - event I'm a point okay so now if I were
26:36 - to then here make a flock which is an
26:41 - array and I probably should make a flock
26:44 - class that might be a thing to refactor
26:46 - later but I'm just gonna say a flock dot
26:50 - push new Boyd and then I just want to
26:54 - say for every Boyd in the flock and
26:59 - music of a music a for of loop and I
27:01 - said in because that's the way I feel
27:03 - right now
27:03 - a boy dot show and then I need to make
27:07 - sure I am also referencing boy KS in my
27:11 - index.html so I have the basic Boyd
27:14 - class which just creates a position
27:16 - velocity acceleration and draws it as a
27:18 - point and then I have my sketch where I
27:21 - make one Boyd and I draw it in the
27:23 - center of the screen there it is there's
27:25 - my boy step one complete I probably
27:28 - should plan this out but I have one boy
27:30 - that's good now let's have that Boyd
27:33 - move so let's actually write in the Boyd
27:36 - object a function called update and this
27:40 - is this I probably covered ad nauseam
27:42 - and a lot of other videos and a whole
27:43 - nature of code series but the idea here
27:46 - is that position is updated based on the
27:50 - objects based on the Boyd's velocity and
27:53 - its velocity is updated based on the
27:57 - Boyd's acceleration so if I now actually
28:00 - create a P five dot vector a random 2d
28:06 - believe this is a function that will
28:08 - give me a random velocity vector and I
28:11 - now go in here and say Boyd update
28:17 - okay cannot read property add of
28:19 - undefined oh no I have the Vista oh I
28:29 - just spelled it wrong I thought I'd
28:31 - missed then this dots okay there we go
28:33 - look it's moving it's moving with a
28:36 - random velocity each time okay now let's
28:40 - just make a bunch of these now I have a
28:50 - system of a hundred buoyantly
28:52 - interesting look at this it fades out in
28:54 - this Purple's perfect circle do you know
28:56 - why that is because I make a boy and I
29:02 - give it a random velocity that random
29:06 - vector is always of unit length one the
29:09 - direction is something different so
29:11 - they're all actually moving with the
29:13 - same speed if I wanted them to have and
29:15 - this is not an important detail to the
29:16 - flocking stuff but just to sort of get a
29:18 - sense of how this vector stuff works I
29:20 - could say this dot velocity set mag
29:24 - which is set the magnitude to a random
29:28 - value between like 0.5 and 1.5 and now
29:33 - you can see now they're all moving with
29:36 - a slightly different velocity so this is
29:38 - by the way a nice little like almost
29:40 - like explosion motif and I could have
29:42 - them with a real big burst and they slow
29:44 - down there's all sorts of physics see
29:45 - stuff I could do in this but I just want
29:46 - to do flocking
29:47 - so how oh wow how do i do flocking let's
29:52 - return to this paper here this is the
29:55 - key behind Craig Reynolds flocking
29:58 - algorithm three rules separation steer
30:04 - to avoid crowding local flock Nate's
30:07 - alignment steer towards the average
30:10 - heading of local flock mates cohesion
30:13 - steer to move toward the average
30:16 - position of local flock mates something
30:18 - so crucial in that description is the
30:21 - word local local local what does that
30:24 - mean so let's just do I think
30:27 - easiest one to do actually is alignment
30:30 - let's do alignment first so alignment
30:36 - let's make our own diagram okay so let's
30:41 - say there are five Boyd's actually let's
30:45 - make a lot more of them these are all of
30:48 - my Boyd's this is the one that I'm
30:51 - currently operating around and it has a
30:54 - velocity vector like this let me just
30:56 - make up let's just pretend like the ones
30:58 - around it are kind of moving all in the
31:00 - same direction because that'll be easier
31:01 - to think about so this is the current
31:04 - one that I'm looking at so and maybe
31:07 - some of these others are also moving in
31:09 - other directions also I could take the
31:13 - approach to say this particular Boyd
31:15 - needs to align itself to everything but
31:19 - this is not really how complex systems
31:23 - in nature actually work the emergent
31:26 - phenomena comes from this Boyd having a
31:28 - limited perception of its environment so
31:32 - maybe it's actually only able to see
31:33 - things that are in front of it or behind
31:35 - it or to the right or what's probably
31:37 - the most the simplest thing to implement
31:38 - is within some radius so I only want to
31:42 - look at the Boyd's that are within this
31:44 - radius meaning this one this one this
31:46 - one this one this one this one so what
31:49 - if I iterate over all of these ones that
31:51 - are within some distance average all of
31:54 - their velocities and shift this velocity
31:56 - in the direction of all those velocities
31:58 - that's what we want to do so I am going
32:01 - to write a function now I'm going to put
32:06 - it in the Boyd I'm going to call it a
32:07 - line and it's going to get presumably an
32:11 - array of other Boyd's like the idea is
32:14 - this function a line this Boyd with all
32:17 - the other Boyd's so what do I need to do
32:20 - I'm gonna make a variable called average
32:22 - which is going to be a vector then I am
32:26 - going to iterate over and I could do all
32:30 - of these with like reduce probably in
32:32 - some higher order array functions that's
32:34 - a great thing for you to
32:37 - [Music]
32:38 - refactor it later but I'm just gonna do
32:42 - it this this way I'm gonna say I'm
32:44 - actually going to use I cuz that's maybe
32:48 - good that's maybe gonna help me I'm not
32:50 - really sure but I'm gonna use I right
32:51 - now actually no no I'll still do use a
32:53 - four of loop let I'm gonna call it other
32:57 - of boyd's and I'm gonna just say average
33:02 - dot add other dot velocity so I'm adding
33:08 - up all of the velocities this is how you
33:10 - do an average write vectors right again
33:13 - you might want to go watch some of my
33:14 - videos about how vectors work but a
33:16 - vector a p5 vector just holds an X and a
33:19 - Y or an X and a wine is Z so I want to
33:21 - average the vector it's represent it as
33:23 - an arrow with an X component of Y
33:24 - component but on average it just like I
33:26 - might average under array of numbers I
33:27 - add them all up and divide by the total
33:29 - and then I would say average dot divided
33:33 - by Boyd's dot length this would be a way
33:38 - of getting a way of getting the average
33:41 - velocity of all of the voids but
33:44 - remember I only want the ones within
33:47 - some distance so actually let's
33:48 - implement that right now let's let's
33:52 - have some sort of distance like Max or
33:56 - uncle like perception equals let's just
33:59 - make it through arbitrary like 100 and
34:01 - then I'm going to now say if the
34:04 - distance between the distance between
34:07 - this dot position X or you know what I
34:11 - think there's a p5 this is fine it's
34:14 - just going to be it's kind of long the
34:16 - way I'm writing this but I don't mind if
34:18 - the distance let's actually make it in a
34:19 - variable D equals the distance between
34:23 - this boyd's position and the other
34:27 - boyd's position x and y and if that
34:35 - distance is less than 100 look at that
34:40 - look at this fancy thing that it's doing
34:42 - I have something like a prettier stuff
34:45 - that like doesn't 1 what you learned a
34:46 - long line of code I guess I'll keep that
34:48 - in there for right
34:48 - now so I'm calculating the distance
34:51 - between this Boyd's position the other
34:52 - Boyd's position and if that distance is
34:54 - less than 100 I'm adding it up and I
34:57 - should say I should also probably have a
35:00 - total number total equals zero add it up
35:04 - I also should probably ignore myself and
35:09 - if other well I should does not equal
35:14 - this right
35:16 - so I basically and I might as well put
35:19 - that first right as long as the other
35:21 - thing is not me and the distance is less
35:25 - than 100 add it up and then divide by
35:28 - the total but obviously I only want to
35:31 - divide by the total if total is greater
35:37 - than zero all right so this is kind of a
35:39 - little bit of a long-winded algorithm
35:40 - now but what oh and perception if d is
35:45 - less than perception so okay I'm
35:47 - starting with a perception a radius of
35:49 - 100 maybe that would be better as I call
35:52 - it like perception radius that's really
35:54 - what it is I'm starting with a
35:56 - perception radius of 100 an empty vector
35:58 - I'm adding up the velocity is of any
36:01 - vector any any Boyd that's near me
36:04 - dividing by the total and as long as I
36:07 - found one dividing by that total and you
36:10 - know I probably should like run this to
36:12 - check this code but I'm just gonna I'm
36:14 - gonna keep going so now here's the thing
36:17 - I could just say like for example I
36:19 - could do something weird this would be
36:20 - really weird I could just say this dot
36:22 - velocity equals average like what if I
36:25 - did that and then I said Boyd like here
36:30 - I said Boyd dot align flock and I don't
36:36 - know what's gonna happen here but let's
36:37 - refresh this right they just basically
36:40 - don't go anywhere because they're all
36:41 - instantly equal to each other's velocity
36:44 - so that's not really a good way what I
36:46 - need to do now is I if I don't want to
36:48 - actually assign its velocity to that
36:51 - average directly I want to steer towards
36:55 - it and this is where Craig Reynolds
36:57 - steering formula comes in a steer
37:01 - force equals some desired velocity minus
37:07 - the current actual velocity it's kind of
37:10 - like the error right if I and moving
37:14 - this way so if I'm sorry moving this way
37:17 - but I want to move this way the way I'm
37:20 - moving - the way I want to move is oh no
37:25 - sorry where's my eraser desired minus
37:28 - velocity the way I want to move - the
37:34 - way I am moving is the steering force
37:37 - meaning push me in that direction so
37:40 - apply a force maybe I'm gonna turn the
37:43 - steering wheel you could think of these
37:44 - as bees or cars or Birds or whatever but
37:47 - this formula desired - velocity will
37:50 - give me the steering force and what is
37:52 - the desired velocity here the desired
37:55 - velocity is actually that average so I'm
37:57 - actually going to rename this to desired
37:58 - and I'm going to add it up and divide by
38:04 - total and then I'm going to say this dot
38:06 - velocity equals no I'm not gonna say
38:08 - that I'm gonna say steering equals and I
38:16 - can actually just I should actually call
38:18 - this steering because I could do all
38:20 - this I can I don't need to save anything
38:23 - as I'm going so I'm gonna call that the
38:24 - steering force I'm gonna add all the
38:28 - velocities I'm gonna divide by the total
38:30 - and then I'm going to say steering force
38:34 - is the desired subtract this dot
38:38 - velocity and I'm going to say returned
38:41 - steering so I want this function to
38:45 - basically I want this function to return
38:47 - that force so really what I should be
38:49 - doing is I should have I'm gonna write a
38:51 - function called flock that's maybe a or
38:53 - like yeah flock with some number of
38:58 - Boyd's and then I'm gonna say a line
39:03 - meant equals a line with those Boyd's so
39:09 - I'm gonna get this force and I suppose
39:16 - we're okay steering is here so you know
39:21 - what I should always return steering so
39:24 - I want to always return a vector but if
39:26 - it didn't find anything I'll just return
39:28 - the zero vector and then what I'm going
39:30 - to do is I'm going to say acceleration
39:33 - add alignment so the idea the way that
39:38 - if that a physics engine works and this
39:40 - has to do with and this is like a very
39:43 - simple kind of crude physics engine but
39:46 - force equals mass times acceleration
39:48 - this is Newton's law of motion or
39:52 - acceleration equals force divided by
39:54 - mass or in a world where the mass of
39:56 - everything is one acceleration equals
39:58 - force so if I want to apply a force to
40:01 - this object I just need to set the
40:03 - acceleration to that force and actually
40:05 - so that's what I'm going to do just
40:06 - starting out here I'm going to say
40:08 - acceleration equals alignment okay so
40:13 - now if I go back to sketch and I say
40:17 - Boyd dot flock Boyd's we should now have
40:23 - all the Boyd's
40:25 - you doing that one with just just
40:28 - implemented with that align alignment
40:30 - rule let's see Boyd's is not defined
40:34 - sketch touch is line 14 oh it's called
40:37 - flock oh this is my variable naming is
40:39 - terrible but I'm gonna leave it that way
40:43 - right now a line is not defined Boyd is
40:46 - a line Boyd's oh this dotted line this
40:52 - dotted line Boyd's oops acceleration is
40:57 - not define oh my goodness
41:01 - [Music]
41:06 - that's not much better ah okay
41:08 - so let's think about this I so so it's
41:10 - kind of working
41:12 - let me um let me give them a much higher
41:14 - burst of speed because I think and all
41:21 - them starting in the same place actually
41:23 - also let's let's do a couple things let
41:26 - me actually not have them all start in
41:27 - the same place because that is just to
41:30 - see this effect happen let me actually
41:33 - start them in random places on the
41:35 - screen so we changed that let me make
41:39 - the perception race a little bit smaller
41:40 - and I don't know why this matters but
41:43 - let me draw them like a little bit
41:45 - smaller okay so you can see and let me
41:48 - actually have them start out going quite
41:51 - a bit faster so you can see as they get
41:57 - near each other they start to they start
41:59 - to get each other's velocity sort to
42:02 - average each other velocity with their
42:04 - neighbors and you can start to see these
42:05 - clumps moving together
42:06 - now these Boyd's to steer with like
42:12 - infinite power in a way like I'm saying
42:15 - hey your your steering force is the
42:18 - difference between your desired velocity
42:20 - and your current velocity and this apply
42:22 - that directly to the acceleration but if
42:24 - you think about it if you're driving a
42:26 - car you know in a car racing game for
42:29 - example is this concept of handling like
42:31 - how well can that car steer so we should
42:34 - probably have a variable we should
42:40 - probably have a variable I'm gonna call
42:43 - it max force and I'm gonna set it equal
42:47 - to one for a second and then what I'm
42:49 - going to do is here I'm gonna say a
42:52 - steering limit this dot max force so
42:57 - this what this does is it limits the
42:59 - magnitude the length of that vector to
43:01 - some maximum force so this should be
43:03 - exactly the same right we're not seeing
43:05 - anything different but if I were to make
43:08 - maximum force like 0.01 like really
43:11 - small right now you're gonna see like
43:13 - they're not actually change
43:15 - their velocity they are but very very
43:17 - slowly and the other thing we're really
43:20 - gonna need to do I just have to like
43:21 - give up and do this I'm gonna add some
43:24 - something for the edges here so I'm
43:26 - gonna say if this dot position dot X is
43:30 - greater than the width this dot position
43:33 - dot X should equal 0 else if this stop
43:38 - position dot X is less than 0 this stop
43:42 - position
43:42 - dot x equals width so and then I'm just
43:45 - gonna do that for the Y why are you here
43:49 - why did the terminal open I have no idea
43:52 - I think I hit like a key command that
43:55 - made that happen and then we're going to
43:56 - do this for y and I could do this in so
44:01 - many different more thoughtful or
44:03 - refactored ways but this is gonna be
44:06 - good oh no what am i doing okay with
44:09 - with xx YY YY y xx xx xx with with
44:13 - alright now here let's do buoyed edges
44:21 - so we should see them reappear wrapping
44:25 - around and now let's go back to the boid
44:29 - and let's make this like point 2 is kind
44:33 - of reasonable ish so interestingly
44:38 - enough there kind of like it slows them
44:42 - down which is sort of which is
44:43 - interesting and there's but I'm only
44:45 - doing alignment right now but you could
44:47 - see how this works right you can see
44:48 - they're all starting to align with each
44:49 - other what I could keep them going it's
44:51 - a minimum velocity which might make
44:53 - sense and you could see how these are
44:54 - like kind of going back and forth but
44:56 - you get the idea or Alanna why are they
44:58 - all slowing down is that just like a
45:01 - coincidence one thing I could do is one
45:06 - thing I could do this this is actually
45:07 - gonna be worth it because I should also
45:09 - give them a maximum speed like they like
45:12 - I this is going to be a parameter of a
45:14 - variable that's gonna allow me to
45:15 - control the system pretty well and I
45:16 - could consider their desired velocity in
45:20 - the alignment to not actually be the
45:25 - actual average velocity but just the
45:27 - average direction
45:29 - because I could then say steering dot
45:31 - set magnitude to this dot maximum speed
45:34 - so basically I'm saying like I always
45:36 - want to go in the direction of my
45:37 - neighbors but at maximum speed and I
45:39 - don't know that that's really an
45:40 - important detail but if I add that in
45:42 - here we might get the effect that I was
45:44 - sort of hoping to get which now this is
45:46 - what I was expecting to see as they get
45:48 - near each other they're all starting to
45:50 - align together let me refresh that one
45:52 - more time you can see that they're
45:53 - clumping and as they group they all
45:56 - start to align so this is the alignment
45:58 - rule this is a very simple rule it's
46:00 - predictable it's obvious this is
46:02 - alignment
46:04 - how many more rules do we have to do at
46:07 - one point I messed up the camera didn't
46:09 - I well whatever some fancy
46:11 - post-production thing that not you can
46:14 - maybe do let me pause for a second
46:17 - there's gonna be an edit point alright
46:28 - 12:06 all right all right
46:30 - half an hour so far all right it's going
46:34 - to move faster now I think let me uh
46:36 - cycle the cameras
46:47 - okay
46:53 - so that is alignment whoo-hoo alignment
46:58 - now all we need to do is add cohesion
47:01 - and separation so separation is going to
47:03 - be the hardest one to do so let's do
47:05 - cohesion next so the same thing we're
47:08 - going to look at our neighbors we should
47:10 - go back to what the rule is actually
47:11 - defined as let's go back to Craig
47:13 - Reynolds original page cohesion steer to
47:17 - move toward the average position of
47:19 - local flock mates okay this is actually
47:21 - not going to be that hard because we've
47:24 - already calculated the average velocity
47:26 - of local flock mates now let's just
47:29 - duplicate that code and I know I know we
47:32 - could refactor it I won't play the song
47:33 - because we could probably do this all in
47:35 - one fell swoop there's so many
47:37 - possibilities but now I just want to get
47:39 - the average location of my local flock
47:41 - mates and steer towards that all right
47:43 - so I'm gonna the way I'm gonna do that
47:45 - in and I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go
47:50 - nuts and copy/paste this whole thing and
47:55 - call it cohesion and I'm gonna keep the
48:00 - perception radius I'm gonna keep this
48:01 - idea of steering keep this idea of total
48:03 - go through all the Boyd's check the
48:05 - distance between myself and the other
48:08 - ones as long as they're not myself and
48:09 - within the perception radius what am i
48:11 - doing steering ad not the others
48:13 - velocity but the others position then
48:16 - right so this should clearly be
48:17 - refactored into its own function what
48:19 - whatever then as long as I have at least
48:23 - one I'm going to divide by the total now
48:26 - I don't want to set the magnitude to the
48:27 - maximum speed so what I have now in
48:30 - steering is the average location so if
48:33 - this is the average location well let's
48:38 - say it's over here then what I need is a
48:39 - vector that probably that's clearly not
48:41 - the average location but let's just say
48:43 - it was the average location is kind of
48:45 - like where this Boyd is but I want to
48:47 - steer in that direction
48:48 - so to get a vector in that direction I
48:50 - take the average location minus the
48:53 - current position of me which is
48:56 - basically saying now what I want to do
48:58 - is say steering subtract this stop
49:03 - position
49:04 - so subtract my position out I have a
49:07 - vector that's pointing from me to the
49:09 - average location remember which is in
49:11 - the steering variable then let's say I
49:13 - want to go at maximum speed and then I
49:16 - want to though so this is now my desired
49:19 - velocity I'm going to subtract out my
49:21 - current velocity limit it to max force
49:23 - and there we go that's cohesion so now
49:26 - in where is that in flock let cohesion
49:36 - equal this dot cohesion boyd's and then
49:40 - oh we have a big problem this dot
49:42 - acceleration equals alignment this dot
49:44 - acceleration equals cohesion so how can
49:46 - I set the acceleration to two different
49:48 - forces but before I even answer that
49:51 - there's an easy answer to that question
49:53 - let's just comment out alignment and
49:55 - let's watch cohesion happen right we can
50:01 - see they start to group together this is
50:03 - cohesion happening bate and that
50:05 - neighbor radius by the way is a super
50:07 - important value right that neighbor
50:10 - radius if I were to change that and I
50:14 - have a different one that perception
50:15 - radius if I were to change that to like
50:18 - ten thousand right they're all going to
50:22 - come together as one because they all
50:23 - see everybody if I were to change that
50:26 - to 10 right there really those little
50:30 - pairs like you could see that kind of
50:32 - get in little groups of two the force
50:34 - though isn't so strong so like if I were
50:37 - to change the maximum force right to
50:39 - like one now you see them they should
50:43 - almost like these little like electron
50:45 - thingies that like start magnetic things
50:48 - that start to like spin around each
50:49 - other and then fan off ah okay
50:51 - so there's so many possibilities here
50:53 - you know I can make the maximum speed to
50:56 - oh I'm not actually limiting you could
50:58 - see there we go that's what I was
50:59 - looking for you can see they get into
51:00 - these little groups but let me go back
51:02 - and say maximum speed is for the maximum
51:05 - force is point two and I realized this
51:07 - maximum of speed is not actually a
51:08 - maximum speed because in update if I
51:11 - really wanted it to be a maximum speed I
51:14 - would want to say this dot velocity
51:17 - limit this dot max speed
51:21 - so let's actually add that in and see
51:24 - what we get this is oh and let's put the
51:26 - perception radius back at 100 and there
51:31 - we go so now we have cohesion so we have
51:33 - cohesion what happens if we have
51:34 - cohesion and alignment how do we get
51:37 - cohesion and alignment okay this is
51:40 - really working it's gonna be a really
51:42 - long video
51:43 - all right cohesion and alignment the
51:45 - problem rests here it's is actually a
51:49 - really easy thing to solve because this
51:51 - is called force acute the answer yours
51:53 - force accumulation in physics if two
51:57 - forces are acting on an object the
51:59 - resulting acceleration is the sum of
52:01 - those forces so all I need to do is say
52:03 - acceleration dot add alignment and
52:06 - acceleration dot add cohesion right
52:09 - because why is this not falling because
52:13 - the force of gravity is pointed this way
52:16 - and the other force of my hands holding
52:19 - it up is pointed in the other direction
52:21 - and with an equal magnitude therefore it
52:23 - is at rest those two forces have a net
52:26 - added together have a net acceleration
52:28 - of zero but obviously so I need to add
52:32 - them together but there is this if I
52:33 - actually do this right now we're gonna
52:35 - see some really crazy behavior this
52:37 - looks like it's kind of working but it
52:39 - really isn't because what it should also
52:42 - have is this acceleration shouldn't
52:45 - accumulate over time at every moment in
52:47 - time I start with a net acceleration an
52:50 - acceleration of zero and add all the
52:52 - forces together so what I should do
52:54 - right before I flock is say this dot
52:56 - acceleration set zero zero this is
53:00 - setting its values to zero and zero
53:01 - another way I could do that is just
53:03 - multiplying it by zero
53:04 - there's multiplying a vector by zero
53:06 - takes everything out it could make a new
53:08 - vector or whatever but this will work
53:10 - nicely and technically this also might
53:12 - make more sense here this is kind of
53:14 - like after I finish updating the
53:16 - velocity then I can reset the
53:17 - acceleration in case there's other
53:18 - things at play so now we can see both
53:22 - cohesion and separation I'm sorry
53:26 - cohesion and alignment are at play look
53:28 - at this eventually they're just all
53:29 - going to become this
53:30 - one clump come on you can catch up catch
53:35 - up one club okay um one thing I would
53:40 - like to do I really want to attach
53:42 - sliders to those parameters but I've got
53:44 - to resist because we got to add
53:45 - separation hey we've got alignment and
53:48 - cohesion separation this one's a little
53:52 - bit hard let's look at it hmm
53:58 - wait come on scroll steer to avoid
54:03 - crowding local flock mates steer to
54:10 - avoid crowding local flock mates okay so
54:14 - we have the idea where's my eraser we
54:18 - have the idea of a local flock mate
54:24 - let's kind of erase this for a second to
54:26 - just deal with two here's me that's me
54:32 - here's my local flock mate
54:34 - if this local flock mate is too close
54:37 - it's within some sort of distance
54:40 - threshold
54:40 - I want to steer to avoid that what would
54:44 - be my desired velocity my desired
54:46 - velocity would be to move in the
54:49 - opposite direction so the idea is my
54:53 - desired velocity is in the observer but
54:55 - what if there is one here my desired
54:59 - velocity would also be in this opposite
55:00 - direction so then my net desired
55:03 - velocity would be the average of these
55:05 - two and it even would make sense for the
55:07 - magnitude of that desired velocity to be
55:11 - proportional to the distance so if this
55:14 - one is here I maybe want to avoid it but
55:16 - I only really need to think about
55:19 - avoiding it a little bit if this one's
55:20 - really close I need to avoid it a lot so
55:22 - the magnitude of the vector is inversely
55:24 - proportional to the distance of the
55:27 - local flock mate and so this might end
55:29 - up with kind of like a desired velocity
55:30 - of something like this if I'm averaging
55:33 - those two together okay so let's see if
55:35 - we can implement that not gonna be super
55:37 - easy but let's do it okay so the nice
55:42 - thing is I'm gonna start with cohesion
55:44 - because we've kind of cohesion as close
55:47 - to separation and again boy
55:50 - [Music]
55:59 - I should show you that I'm wearing my I
56:01 - will effective displayed our t-shirt by
56:03 - the way
56:04 - okay so separation so I'm gonna leave
56:07 - this at a hundred steering I think I
56:11 - might need to use more like I I kind of
56:14 - like the idea of just having one vector
56:15 - that ends up is it's sort of the average
56:17 - here then it's kind of like the
56:20 - difference but I think I need I think I
56:23 - need to think I need that's the one step
56:26 - at a time so I'm creating this vector if
56:29 - so this is the same if it's not me
56:31 - and it's within the perception radius
56:33 - what do I need I need a vector I'm gonna
56:39 - call it difference which is the others
56:46 - I want a vector sorry that points from I
56:50 - want a vector that points from the other
56:53 - from the other to me because I want that
56:56 - to what go to the opposite direction so
56:58 - it's my position - the other so I want a
57:05 - vector a new vector which is the diff
57:08 - subtraction between my position and the
57:13 - others position so this is a way of
57:17 - calling the subtract function which
57:19 - doesn't operate on a vector but
57:21 - subtracts two vectors and gives us a new
57:23 - vector which is difference then I want
57:27 - the difference to be inversely
57:29 - proportional to that distance so I'm
57:34 - going to multiply it or set its
57:35 - magnitude something like that I mean
57:37 - this is making it I'm gonna devour
57:38 - divided by distance I could just say
57:40 - divided by distance right it's inversely
57:44 - proportional the farther away it is the
57:46 - lower the the higher the the farther
57:49 - away it is the lower the magnitude the
57:51 - closer the higher the magnitude okay and
57:53 - the distance I guess technically that
57:55 - distance could be zero and that would be
57:56 - problematic but with floating point math
57:58 - we're almost never going to get a value
58:00 - of zero okay then I want to add then
58:02 - that is the thing I add up that's the
58:06 - thing I want to average all those
58:07 - vectors that are pointed away from the
58:09 - things near me I think we're actually in
58:11 - pretty good shape here this isn't as
58:13 - hard
58:13 - I thought oh that was done this is the
58:15 - tricky part here so get a vector that's
58:17 - pointing away from the local flock mate
58:19 - make it inversely proportional to the
58:21 - distance add it up then this is the same
58:24 - because oh no no I don't need to
58:27 - subtract position I kind of don't know
58:29 - if I want to I let's leave this it's
58:32 - let's leave this whole always go at
58:34 - maximum speed thing and then the rest is
58:36 - the same the rest of the same right once
58:38 - I have that just average it set it to
58:41 - max speed subtract out the velocity and
58:43 - limit it to maximum force and that's the
58:46 - end okay so let's see so now just to be
58:49 - sure that this is right pause for a
58:53 - second okay just to be sure that this is
59:00 - right let's go into boid let's go to
59:06 - flock let's add that lets up separation
59:12 - equal this dot separation and then let's
59:16 - add in separation and I want to not
59:22 - bother adding cohesion and alignment so
59:24 - I just want to see separation right now
59:26 - oh and William in the chat is saying 1
59:29 - divided by distance squared maybe that's
59:31 - probably a good idea squaring the
59:33 - distance that's to make it quadratic or
59:36 - whatever that's probably smart I bet you
59:38 - if you read this full explanation it
59:40 - does something like that but let's just
59:42 - see
59:43 - so are these separating yeah it looks
59:46 - like they are it looks like that when
59:48 - they get close to each other they're
59:49 - kind of moving away from each other
59:52 - weird weird behavior do I have this
59:54 - isn't it look exactly like what I
59:55 - expected
59:56 - let's let's give them maximum force like
59:59 - just like really let them be super
60:01 - strong about separating yeah there we go
60:04 - okay so that's more like what actually
60:05 - that's way too strong yeah why do they
60:09 - feel like there something is weird here
60:15 - like I think my inversely proportional
60:19 - thing is wrong what's going on let's go
60:24 - back to separate Oh it's perception race
60:26 - is one
60:27 - and there's just so many of them that
60:30 - they can't all separate with this is
60:31 - what I expected to see and I think it
60:33 - actually it wasn't really a bug in my
60:34 - code it's sort of a bug in my conceptual
60:37 - sense of how this works and also maybe
60:40 - the inversely proportional thing so a
60:42 - couple things that I might do here it's
60:44 - like what if I take this out and then
60:48 - also let's try dividing by distance
60:50 - Square to kind of like that idea to make
60:52 - that whoa that's weird that makes them
60:58 - want to stop
60:59 - is that because oh because their desired
61:06 - velocity ends up being oh yeah it
61:07 - actually has to be maximum speed because
61:09 - if if in other words if their desired
61:12 - velocity is like oh I'm far enough apart
61:13 - I my desired velocity is now zero then
61:17 - it's going to make me want to like stop
61:18 - yes because I'm already always returning
61:20 - an empty vector ah what I could do is
61:23 - instead of returning an empty vector I
61:25 - return a null vector and don't bother
61:27 - adding that as a force but that all
61:29 - aside let's leave it at there's so many
61:31 - ways you could change or alter this
61:32 - though this is pretty good this is what
61:34 - I wanted to see this is separation only
61:36 - so now we should be able to see and
61:38 - let's I'm gonna do this really quickly
61:41 - I'm going to not be thoughtful at all
61:44 - about the interface but just so I can
61:47 - debug this effectively I am going to
61:51 - going to sketch j/s I am gonna say let a
61:55 - line slider cohesion slider and
62:01 - separation slider and I should use oh
62:05 - and I'm just gonna say a line slider
62:08 - equals create slider I'm gonna give it a
62:11 - range between 1 and 5 with and actually
62:14 - just give it a range between zero sorry
62:15 - zero and five with a starting value of
62:19 - one and increment value of 0.1 so I want
62:23 - to do this for all of these sliders
62:26 - cohesion slider separation slider and
62:30 - then in Boyde i want to say where i
62:33 - calling flock I want to just scale them
62:36 - so I'm gonna say separation sly oops
62:39 - separation dot
62:41 - multiply separation slider value and
62:44 - then I'm gonna do this also for cohesion
62:47 - and for alignment doesn't really matter
62:50 - the order but I probably should be
62:51 - consistent just for like just gonna
62:56 - always mean the order doesn't matter at
62:58 - all but I'm so this is separation slider
62:59 - a line slider and cohesion slider or
63:03 - those the names so again I'm not
63:05 - thinking about design or interaction
63:07 - design or visual designer any of that
63:09 - just wanted to quickly put three sliders
63:10 - in there and now so by the way flocking
63:17 - so this is now the flocking simulation I
63:19 - didn't draw in this triangles they're
63:20 - not rotating but this is the flocking
63:22 - simulation but just for the sake of
63:24 - argument this should be what order did I
63:26 - make them in like they're not labeled
63:28 - alignment cohesion so I want to do yeah
63:31 - alignment cohesion separation that's the
63:33 - order that I thought of them in so let's
63:35 - just turn all the way up separation oh
63:37 - boy let's let's turn off right this is
63:42 - only separation now turn that off let's
63:46 - turn on only alignment whoa wait no
63:49 - that's oh they're just the alignment is
63:52 - so strong when the alignment is so
63:54 - strong it makes them like go in circles
63:57 - around each other I'll talk about why so
64:00 - let me just decrease those ranges so
64:03 - there's a little bit of an issue here
64:05 - which is that look at with the previous
64:07 - ones updated value right instead of
64:10 - taking a snapshot of all their current
64:12 - velocities and then each one updates
64:14 - based on that snapshot I start with a
64:17 - set of velocities I update the first one
64:18 - based on that set of velocities and now
64:20 - its new velocity is there so when the
64:22 - next one it's actually updating itself
64:23 - based on the previous one that I updated
64:25 - which is not how the world works it's
64:26 - not how time works but that's causing
64:29 - them to like ripple into each other
64:30 - based on the order and go in circles
64:31 - that is something that you might want to
64:33 - consider fixing I'm not going to fix
64:35 - that but now I can really play with
64:37 - these I can get different sort of
64:39 - qualities of flocking based on how
64:40 - strong I make these rules so no
64:42 - alignment a lot of cohesion no
64:45 - separation add a lot of separation less
64:49 - cohesion I mean separation I shouldn't
64:51 - make too strong but it's important and
64:53 - let's add some alignment back in and
64:54 - there we go flocking whoa okay this
64:59 - coding challenge is complete it is done
65:01 - I will be uploading the code you will if
65:03 - you want you can look in the video
65:04 - description to find the code as a
65:06 - snapshot as exactly what it is let's go
65:08 - make a list let's make a list on the
65:10 - board of things you might try to do and
65:14 - I'm going to take suggestions from the
65:15 - chat and make your own version of this
65:17 - and you can hashtag coding flocking
65:21 - coding train flocking I don't know but
65:25 - let's let me make a list of some things
65:27 - you might try number one is do deal
65:32 - shoot okay I'm hold on time out and ity
65:40 - edit this I'm throwing away these
65:42 - markers that don't work me in the
65:43 - hallway there we go okay alright number
65:58 - one snapshot of all velocities that's
66:03 - gonna be my code for that number two op
66:06 - an optimization you can do is called a
66:11 - spatial subdivision or a quadtree
66:13 - optimization one of the things that
66:16 - makes this really slow and I'll just
66:18 - show you here for a second is if I were
66:21 - to try to do this with a thousand Boyd's
66:25 - right look how slow this is but you have
66:28 - to realize it's not a big deal for p5 to
66:34 - draw a thousand things moving why it's
66:36 - fine drawing a thousand things moving
66:38 - but as soon as I put flock the flock
66:40 - function in it's super slow the reason
66:42 - that is is because it's got to do and
66:45 - every boyd again check every board
66:48 - against every other boy check and so
66:50 - there's a way of subdividing the space
66:54 - spatial subdivision into bins or buckets
66:57 - and have the boys only checked ones that
66:59 - are near each other in the same buckets
67:00 - and that's called you know i probably
67:03 - have a lot of distance the distance
67:04 - calculation i could reduce
67:06 - the number of times I call it but for
67:08 - this quadtree or just simple spatial sum
67:13 - of subdivision so these are things you
67:15 - could try these are just code
67:17 - refactoring really actually the other
67:20 - okay the other thing you could try
67:22 - another thing you could try is hold on
67:28 - sorry I lost my train of thought oh
67:30 - train of thought because it was related
67:35 - to this spatial subdivision thing
67:37 - optimize well maybe there's some
67:40 - suggestions in the chat right now had
67:43 - attractors or trees multiple yeah fix
67:47 - the velocity snap trapezoid make believe
67:49 - that I'm just looking at the chat I had
67:51 - something in my head that was the third
67:53 - thing snapshot of all the velocities
67:55 - optimized quadtree and subdivision oh
68:01 - yeah I said reduce the distance squared
68:06 - whatever okay another thing you could
68:10 - try to do is really build a more
68:13 - sophisticated interface and there's lots
68:16 - of other parameters that you could
68:18 - control and try right there's the
68:20 - perception radius so we saw that you
68:24 - could change the weights to the weights
68:27 - for alignment cohesion and separation
68:29 - but there's also the perception radius
68:31 - there's maximum maximum force
68:36 - there's maximum speed you know each rule
68:42 - could have a set different perception
68:43 - radius so many possibilities so this is
68:47 - this is the stuff that you could do to
68:48 - like really control and tweak all the
68:50 - values and play with it you could
68:53 - another thing you could do is just
68:55 - design visual design like are they
68:58 - triangle circles are they flapping
69:01 - butterflies like how do you design of
69:03 - the voids like make your own beautiful
69:06 - visualization of how you design and draw
69:08 - them tadpole like how there's so many
69:11 - ideas there another thing you could try
69:14 - to do is 3d can you extrapolate this
69:16 - into 3d
69:18 - and and if you see the word quaternion
69:20 - anywhere you start to research you might
69:22 - want to turn back but but you could you
69:25 - could extrapolate this into 3d look
69:30 - there were some interesting suggestions
69:31 - oh right Boyd's with different
69:34 - parameters yeah so a sort of another
69:41 - suggestion which came from the chat
69:42 - thank you is Boyd's with different
69:46 - parameters right so there's no reason
69:49 - why every Boyd has to have the same max
69:51 - speed or maximum force they could same
69:54 - perception radius you could implement
69:57 - this thing called the view rule which is
70:01 - kind of interesting to think about I
70:02 - don't know why I'm going to I have a
70:04 - diagram of it but it's one of the things
70:05 - that right now is each Boyd there's two
70:08 - things about this one each boy can see
70:10 - everything around it but what if the
70:12 - Boyd itself could actually only see if
70:15 - it's moving in this direction things
70:17 - that are within its particular view in
70:19 - front of it maybe it doesn't deal with
70:21 - anything that's behind it doesn't try to
70:23 - use a cohesion or alignment or
70:25 - separation and then the view rule which
70:27 - is posited by flake in the book the
70:30 - computational beauty of nature I'll link
70:32 - to that book also it's a wonderful book
70:34 - with tons I'm probably like 90% of the
70:36 - things on my channel are all from the
70:38 - computational beauty of nature book but
70:40 - the flake positive to this additional
70:43 - rule that you always want to keep your
70:44 - view empty so if there is a Boyd in
70:48 - front of you you want to steer that way
70:50 - to keep your void your your view empty
70:54 - clear and this might result the theory
70:57 - is that this will result in something
70:58 - that looks more like that pattern that
71:01 - you'll see of actual birds flocking
71:02 - where they kind of appear almost in this
71:05 - triangular pattern so what's interesting
71:07 - about this right you see a pattern like
71:09 - this you think AHA this is a top-down
71:12 - behavior there is a leader this bird who
71:15 - is saying to all the other birds fan out
71:17 - for me and follow me but yet this type
71:20 - of intelligent behavior emergent
71:23 - phenomena can come actually only from
71:25 - simple local rules of in
71:27 - action and that's by the way this is
71:28 - what this whole video was about if you
71:30 - didn't gather that already okay buzz
71:33 - what are some other ideas other ideas
71:42 - might be open other ideas might be
71:49 - adding obstacles other forces there's
71:53 - you know thinking about these living in
71:56 - a world where they're interacting with
71:57 - other things maybe there's a predator
71:58 - that comes in and it's chasing them all
72:00 - sorts of unique and interesting
72:03 - possibilities okay so thank you everyone
72:06 - for watching this coding challenge put
72:08 - your other ideas for things people could
72:10 - do in the comments and then if you make
72:12 - your own version of this flocking code
72:14 - please go to the coding training com
72:16 - challenge page and submit a link to the
72:19 - - what you made I will also make a
72:20 - virtue of this the runs in the web
72:22 - editor and linked to all those resources
72:24 - like the Craig Reynolds original paper
72:25 - about flocking the video on YouTube and
72:29 - the chapter in my nature of code book ok
72:30 - thanks for watching this coding
72:32 - challenge flocking and I'll see you soon
72:36 - okay alright everybody
72:40 - oh boy it's 12:30 I definitely have to
72:42 - go I'm glad that I fit in this extra
72:45 - coding challenge and I'm actually
72:46 - recording it to disk so this can be
72:48 - edited I assume this is at least an hour
72:50 - right but hopefully this was useful
73:01 - thank you all these nice comments so
73:04 - when will I be back a week from tomorrow
73:07 - if I have to guess so there will be no
73:09 - live stream tomorrow this was today's
73:11 - coda train episode the next time I will
73:14 - be back is a week from tomorrow next
73:17 - Friday
73:18 - upcoming soon is a live stream from the
73:21 - ITP winter show if you're in the New
73:24 - York City area I highly recommend you to
73:26 - come to this this is the show of
73:30 - students work at ITP Sunday December
73:32 - I'll probably do a livestream from the
73:34 - show in the afternoon of Monday December
73:37 - 17th and then later that week hopefully
73:39 - on December 20
73:40 - I'm gonna do a fundraiser telethon for
73:43 - the processing foundation but I got to
73:45 - figure out this super chat thing so
73:47 - that's that what else do I want to tell
73:49 - you ah if you live in Europe possibly in
73:53 - France or near the city of Paris
73:55 - coming soon I'm hoping to announce a
73:58 - workshop slash meetup that I'll be doing
74:00 - in Paris in early January so don't to
74:02 - say anything more about that because
74:03 - it's not settled I don't even like know
74:05 - exactly which date yet but stay tuned
74:07 - I'll announce it on Twitter I'll mention
74:09 - it again here but that I'm hoping to I'm
74:12 - have that which is the first ever
74:13 - possibly like I mean obviously I go to
74:15 - things and I've met people in my own
74:19 - little room here but anyway but this is
74:24 - exciting to me to try that especially I
74:26 - get to practice my terrible terrible
74:27 - French alright perfect hi yes Alka okay
74:33 - let's talk offline Alka about your
74:35 - suggestion to fly to New York City to
74:37 - help with the livestream for the effect
74:39 - actually I'm like it this is this is
74:41 - something I would seriously take under
74:43 - consideration okay motion TX thank you
74:49 - new member wait I want to figure this
74:53 - out there's a way that I can make a page
74:56 - and I have to like log in to my other
74:58 - guy I guess I can okay I want to make a
75:00 - pop-up thing happen when I get a new a
75:02 - new member in for math music says
75:07 - workshop in Paris I live in Paris
75:10 - excellent I would love to go everywhere
75:12 - frankly traveling is hard inexpensive
75:14 - and uses a lot of energy both the
75:16 - world's energy and my own energy and I
75:19 - have like these small children that I
75:20 - spend a lot of time with and a family
75:23 - and so I can't really just go everywhere
75:25 - but I dream of going everywhere I would
75:27 - really like to go to Japan I'm willing
75:29 - to go I've ever been to anywhere in the
75:31 - Middle East
75:32 - ever been to Japan urban Africa I've
75:34 - never been to Australia New Zealand
75:35 - these are just things that are popping
75:36 - I've been to a lot of places in Europe
75:38 - and Canada been very very few places in
75:40 - South America I don't know world tour
75:43 - coding train World Tour coming soon
75:45 - thanks everybody
75:47 - and in for mock music if you
75:51 - to the Meetup you will see me I will be
75:53 - bringing my stickers I will be bringing
75:56 - the coding train stickers thanks
75:59 - everyone and yeah Norway
76:05 - ah I have been to Norway so lol elo
76:08 - leaves just thinking what can I tell you
76:10 - about my favorite place one of my
76:11 - favorite places in the world rune de
76:13 - Norway this small island off the coast
76:19 - of Norway called rune de which I believe
76:21 - means bird island is one of my absolute
76:24 - favorite places at certain times of year
76:27 - you can go see the puffins I went on
76:30 - this like six-hour hike mostly six out
76:33 - really long hike all the way to this
76:35 - lighthouse that you can only get to by
76:36 - hiking and then you can just sleep there
76:38 - overnight didn't we like back but this
76:39 - place is amazing I really want to go
76:41 - back there there's a centre there which
76:46 - is like a bird science site anyway if
76:49 - someone can figure out a way that we can
76:51 - do like a live coding train from the
76:52 - island of rune de that would be awesome
76:56 - Dominican Republic that would be a
76:58 - Brazil all these amazing places all over
77:01 - the world here's a nice picture of
77:04 - runa-san unda it was where did I stay I
77:07 - stayed at the this the bird center there
77:11 - Environmental Center
77:12 - yeah research safe so I stayed here you
77:13 - can actually just stay there like it's
77:15 - for scientists but you can also just
77:17 - book a room there because I am NOT a
77:18 - scientist the Runet environment is as a
77:20 - research station with four main
77:22 - activities
77:22 - oh this is perfect for flocking let's
77:25 - let's look up actually I was in a
77:27 - Norwegian I'm not kidding
77:29 - anybody could find this I had it buried
77:31 - in my computer somewhere I was I'm in a
77:34 - Norwegian Travel Magazine with my family
77:36 - because they were there shooting photos
77:39 - to be like I think it was a Travel
77:42 - Magazine and we were like the only
77:43 - people standing on the island because it
77:45 - was like kind of the wrong time of year
77:46 - to visit there were no puffins rune de
77:49 - Norway puffins al it's near ålesund
77:54 - um so yeah these are the puffins of rune
77:57 - de noir Yeah right
77:58 - it's bit I see these photos and I'm like
78:00 - terrified because they're all through
78:01 - these like cliffs you could go right up
78:02 - to the edge
78:03 - like we were doing that I think about it
78:05 - and like oh my god we're we doing
78:06 - something really dangerous this place is
78:08 - amazing
78:08 - Cody train is sponsored by the Norwegian
78:12 - travel Council no not at all
78:15 - but you know it's very expensive in
78:18 - Norway I mean I think I won I don't
78:21 - think hopefully it's not for people who
78:22 - live there because they have excellent
78:26 - services you know health care and those
78:29 - types of things but as a tourist there's
78:31 - incredibly expensive food food was so
78:34 - that is and I don't know I have to say
78:36 - it didn't love the food or oh yeah I had
78:39 - some really interesting things to eat
78:40 - and I spent a little time in Oslo and
78:42 - there's some like really awesome
78:43 - restaurants there but there was just I
78:46 - don't know maybe it's hard like it's
78:47 - like dark and wintry I love you Norway
78:54 - all right I think by the way the author
78:57 - of the Iowa factor the Sun is
79:02 - I have to go I'm like super lazy alright
79:06 - goodbye everybody
79:07 - please refactor my pocket code I got to
79:10 - get it in the editor or the coding train
79:11 - account soon this challenge will
79:13 - probably be up edited next week sometime
79:15 - and I will see you I'm going to I am
79:19 - going to stop the livestream on this
79:24 - page where's that page shoot I don't
79:29 - have it open okay
79:30 - no live control room one thing that I by
79:35 - the way one thing that I'm planning on
79:36 - doing mpj gave me this idea I mean I
79:39 - could have thought of this myself but
79:40 - lots of people do this is getting a loop
79:43 - for like stream about to start loop for
79:46 - thanks for watching and like a loop for
79:48 - like be right back like fun little
79:49 - coding train animation thingies anybody
79:51 - wants to make some of those I mean I
79:53 - would be glad to hire somebody in you
79:56 - know Matthew who does video editing has
79:58 - a lot of talents and might be interested
79:59 - in working on this I don't mean to ask
80:00 - for things for free but if you're
80:02 - interested if you're an animator and you
80:04 - like rainbows and coding stuff and you
80:06 - wanna help me make some crazy
80:08 - interstitial stuff that I could put an
80:10 - open broadcast studio get in touch okay
80:17 - stop streaming and I'll see you all
80:19 - later

Cleaned transcript:

hello again welcome to the wasting time portion of the Kotick train my name is Dan Schiffman and I have about 40 minutes before I have to go I just finished an hour of code tutorial and the camera of course just shut off where I made this project that tracks your nose it tracks your nose with P 5 ml 5 and the PostNet model and I'm here now to waste your time because I have a bunch of things I want to experiment with and discuss but you should probably just go about with your day um if I can manage their good a quoting challenge in before I go I would like to do that so one thing I want to test here and I don't know why this isn't working let me try refreshing this again alright so I'm planning by the way it's probably gonna be December 20th I am planning a fundraiser for the processing foundation processing foundation org if you're not familiar with the processing foundation the processing foundation is the non for profit entity that that that manages the processing project p5.js processing on Python and also a lot of community and education initiatives around art and code and all sorts of stuff so read the mission statement come hang out with us at any number of processing days around the world which is happening in 2019 and I will be at processing Los Angeles and hopefully at pressing NYC as well alright that aside I wanted to figure out I have this processing is a 501c3 non for profit and this setting I don't see it I wanted to enable super chat for good to see if I can to see if I can figure out how to get live donations and then I can also build something which actually shows the live chat but maybe what I first need to do hold on them so what I'm doing over here is I'm in my admin panel and I maybe I'll just build something that manually pops up something when there's a super but why do I not have going to I'm going to live streaming I'm going into events a live edit there's 214 of you apparently watching right now and under advanced settings under chat it's not there so they I used to have an option that was super chat for good and I could enable the processing foundation so nevermind I wanted to test that now I'm gonna have to figure that out and test that another time oh look it's me with googly eyes thank you Bruno Ruchika who made this a wonderful sketch all right so let's close all this out the other thing that's goofy oh okay so I don't know what to do now hello how are you hopefully that hopefully that yeah I should make you know what I should do for the fundraiser is on the fundraiser I should write ap 5 sketch that communicates with the YouTube API and like makes a little like heart or something whenever somebody makes a donation but you need to get that super chat for good thing working ok so well if anybody knows if I mean I I'll contact YouTube but if anybody knows about that or has worked with the YouTube API actually I know you can write bots and things for the chat so that's actually probably what I that's that's something I should look into and do so what can I do right now I'm at 35 I had this idea actually this is probably insane to try to do this I'm doing like a flocking simulation let's go to coding train on github Oh am I not will signed in I'm gonna need my authentication here let me look up the Authenticator oh I'm I'm streaming and recording so weird and go down here hit signin oh no that's that's not my password that's my ah now everybody knows my authentication code but it's already gone alright let's go here only 871 871 ideas regarding your previous stream if you define a 2d shape in relation to the points surely you can in 3d as well yeah absolutely alright no I really I have no plan nothing whatsoever Schrodinger equation create a gaffing revisiting pixel sorting would love to do the quicksort coding challenge right now but I don't think I'm going to triple pendulum chain we're actually marching cubes ooh that would be a good one stolen necklace drunken bishop spiral map projection coding challenge maybe what we could do you know I have this like weird idea that I would like to do which is because infinite recursion into the TV thing I feel like we should just program that that would be fun I was doing video stuff but I don't know plotter soft body simulation Roman numerals clicking on object in 3d space lizard visualization what is that of a movement of a lizard the lizard should have a triangle like head body legs should go to the point where them is very specific should go to the point it should go to the point where the mouse was clicked the hard part will be the way the lizard moves it should turn and move at the same time and travel the least distance ideally when the lizard is facing one direction and when mouse is clicked it should start moving like a real lizard resetboys okay I don't think I'm gonna get to this right now so I don't know why but in my head this morning I thought I should do the flocking as a coding challenge Boyd's Boyd's chance look I even assign this no there's no thumbsup on this one I'll give it a thumbs up could this be done in a half an hour that's the question why come on github come on computer may refresh the page it doesn't even want to let me give it a thumbs up yeah there we go how many thumbs up how many thumbs up can I get on this page right now I'd like to see clock at destined Dustin is destined Destin's office from smarter every day I don't I didn't I don't know about that clock from smarter every day but but I'm always interested oh right we do a do weird complex number math on the image to make that spiral pattern in Matt Parker's videos I also want to do I want to do some like fluid dynamic stuff because I have been watching a lot of the smartereveryday videos about shockwaves and I think that would be an interesting thing to do a shockwave visualization oh I think that no nobody's thumbs up in this just me I'm the only thumbs up emoji yes all right come on everybody by the way this is my this is my live stream for if I can get that to ten I'm gonna do it this is my live stream for the week tomorrow I'm actually doing some school visits for hour of code which is gonna be fun we got to number five for six and what I wanted to say by the way I am planning Obama's night okay are there any oh let's check if there's any coding faces tweets and please do I'm just going to I'm now always afraid I'm afraid of the internet so I'm going to the coding faces page oh look at this we have got some you've got one from Carol oops here we go Carol posted Carol d @d r ka ro L on Twitter three minutes ago posted my first ml experiments with coding faces awesome what number are we at now 15 okay thumbs down this is really like wild to me to see this happen 2200 people are watching all right but I have to I have to go I have a meeting to be at do you think we could do the flocking all right let's get prepared we'll check back on coding phases let's get prepared to do this so flocking video Schiffman let's see if that comes up a little bit that's interesting I don't know let's go Craig Reynolds steering no not videos oh let's original 1986 Boyd simulation awesome I want this page Boyd's here we go and then nature of code read now a ton of agents here we go what those diagrams are better here we go here we go okay all right okay so I've got my references I have got and here and we're gonna do this I think this requires I don't want to do this in the web editor I think there's too much involved with the complexity of this that that I think what I want to do is use us I'm just gonna run my own server way the console and I am going to oh hey I already have the code editor open I'm gonna get rid of this and someday I'm gonna like make myself a little template here but today is not that day oh I need the CDN and let's just in case I need the Dom library let's get this and let's get shot Jay s so just give it a fixedsize background everyone and what's going on here Oh No Oh tonight can I reset the bra I think I reset the browser here and yeah this is not selected anymore there we go so now this can be minimized I don't need that open I don't need this open and don't say don't save so and then here this so how am i doing I'm standing here that's good so I'm not in front of the code so I can actually do this sighs and I've got this here which can actually also be over cuz it can just be above me there we go and look some more room in the console okay perfect all right 32 all right we're gonna do the flocking the Boyd's challenge this is definitely gonna take a longer than a half an hour this is a really complicated complicated project Simon yes I know I haven't redone the beginner p5 tutorials I think I may be me I need to schedule a time to do more of those okay so let me actually just go to oh this is what I'm looking for by the way here we go all right why is that so slow let's open up processing oh shoot so yeah like I kind of put an image behind me that'll be interesting it's like I'm spending forever tweaking heads it was really wasting time when I should just be coding all right okay I think I'm ready now okay the house definitely gonna need the whiteboard so let me erase that okay let me just send a quick message here let me let me just send a quick message that I need to send sorry hold on just I'm gonna be a little late okay all right close enough close enough should get some water but whatever we're just gonna we're gonna move forward with this just let me just it's just that like a few more and make them theirs they're too big let's make them a little bit smaller Oh perfect now it's perfect okay hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt a program using the p5 library from starting from no code except for the what we're chance yeah I have this like hangup where when I say from scratch people are always the youtube knowledge well it's not actually from scratch because you and yours it the p5 library huh you know what what what what can I do here we go hello welcome to coding challenge I am going to in this coding challenge make this this is a processing sketch thank you 72 475 okay have a random number everything's gonna be fine let me cycle the camera what's the chance that I can be done in a half an hour very very little chance well so I haven't eaten lunch this is not gonna go well hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I probably should go eat lunch but I'm gonna just try this coding challenge I am going to attempt to program this this is a flocking simulation what you're seeing right now is an example that I made many years ago of a flocking simulation a void system running in processing so I'm gonna try to make exactly this or close to it in JavaScript with the p5 libraries from no code at all obviously besides the dependencies okay so this is the example running so let me just give you a leg Reynolds you can go to this link to read this explanation of it and if find many other links and resources down here well that's a lot of stuff have fun see you in a few weeks you can also check out this YouTube video of the original 1986 flocking simulation love that and you can also find an explanation of it as part of my nature of code book online with some diagrams and code written in processing and an exercise that you could try which I'll refer to back at the end but I am going to start from this a blank slate I just have a canvas you have some amount of pixels in it there is nothing happening in the console and I've got this code set up and draw alright so what do I need to do now there's definitely going to be a big need to refactor the code that I'm going to write so if you look at my example it's hopefully somewhat wellorganized but I'm gonna Thank You Matsuya for for me alright let me just let me let me double back for a second so I'm gonna write this code without worrying about being like perfectly organized and and being able to scale it very easily I just want to try to get the algorithm working but of course where's the button and if you want to see a refactored example of any probably so in looking actually at my finished version in the nature code I'll also link to so the first thing that I want to do though is I want to add another JavaScript file called particle JSI actually you know what I should rename this to Boyd dot Jas so what is this term Boyd when Craig Reynolds invented this algorithm for simulating a flocking system like a flock of birds or a swarm of bees I suppose you didn't want to use the term bird but it is kind of like birds so Boyd it's kind of like droid but Boyd go read the original paper about steering behaviors and flocking systems and you'll find out more about the history about this but I am going to make a class called Boyd and I am going to use the p5 vector object and so eat this climbing to make Boyd objects and each each time I made a Boyd object I need a constructor and I am going to give each Boyd a position I'm going to give each Boyd a velocity and I'm going to give each Boyd and acceleration and all of those are going to be vectors so I'm doing this in 2d you should after you watch this if super you watch this you should make your own 3d version of this all the math will work exactly the same way but you'll just need to rethink how you're visualizing this and just to give things a start let's just put the the position like in the middle of the window and let's write a function called like show which will just draw them as a circle right now I'll just even use point like stroke weight 16 stroke 255 point this dot position x2 I think visual studio code will do this for me no weird it fixed that for me once I had the enemy of whatever okay so this dot a pointer event well I'm not a pointer event I'm a point okay so now if I were to then here make a flock which is an array and I probably should make a flock class that might be a thing to refactor later but I'm just gonna say a flock dot push new Boyd and then I just want to say for every Boyd in the flock and music of a music a for of loop and I said in because that's the way I feel right now a boy dot show and then I need to make sure I am also referencing boy KS in my index.html so I have the basic Boyd class which just creates a position velocity acceleration and draws it as a point and then I have my sketch where I make one Boyd and I draw it in the center of the screen there it is there's my boy step one complete I probably should plan this out but I have one boy that's good now let's have that Boyd move so let's actually write in the Boyd object a function called update and this is this I probably covered ad nauseam and a lot of other videos and a whole nature of code series but the idea here is that position is updated based on the objects based on the Boyd's velocity and its velocity is updated based on the Boyd's acceleration so if I now actually create a P five dot vector a random 2d believe this is a function that will give me a random velocity vector and I now go in here and say Boyd update okay cannot read property add of undefined oh no I have the Vista oh I just spelled it wrong I thought I'd missed then this dots okay there we go look it's moving it's moving with a random velocity each time okay now let's just make a bunch of these now I have a system of a hundred buoyantly interesting look at this it fades out in this Purple's perfect circle do you know why that is because I make a boy and I give it a random velocity that random vector is always of unit length one the direction is something different so they're all actually moving with the same speed if I wanted them to have and this is not an important detail to the flocking stuff but just to sort of get a sense of how this vector stuff works I could say this dot velocity set mag which is set the magnitude to a random value between like 0.5 and 1.5 and now you can see now they're all moving with a slightly different velocity so this is by the way a nice little like almost like explosion motif and I could have them with a real big burst and they slow down there's all sorts of physics see stuff I could do in this but I just want to do flocking so how oh wow how do i do flocking let's return to this paper here this is the key behind Craig Reynolds flocking algorithm three rules separation steer to avoid crowding local flock Nate's alignment steer towards the average heading of local flock mates cohesion steer to move toward the average position of local flock mates something so crucial in that description is the word local local local what does that mean so let's just do I think easiest one to do actually is alignment let's do alignment first so alignment let's make our own diagram okay so let's say there are five Boyd's actually let's make a lot more of them these are all of my Boyd's this is the one that I'm currently operating around and it has a velocity vector like this let me just make up let's just pretend like the ones around it are kind of moving all in the same direction because that'll be easier to think about so this is the current one that I'm looking at so and maybe some of these others are also moving in other directions also I could take the approach to say this particular Boyd needs to align itself to everything but this is not really how complex systems in nature actually work the emergent phenomena comes from this Boyd having a limited perception of its environment so maybe it's actually only able to see things that are in front of it or behind it or to the right or what's probably the most the simplest thing to implement is within some radius so I only want to look at the Boyd's that are within this radius meaning this one this one this one this one this one this one so what if I iterate over all of these ones that are within some distance average all of their velocities and shift this velocity in the direction of all those velocities that's what we want to do so I am going to write a function now I'm going to put it in the Boyd I'm going to call it a line and it's going to get presumably an array of other Boyd's like the idea is this function a line this Boyd with all the other Boyd's so what do I need to do I'm gonna make a variable called average which is going to be a vector then I am going to iterate over and I could do all of these with like reduce probably in some higher order array functions that's a great thing for you to refactor it later but I'm just gonna do it this this way I'm gonna say I'm actually going to use I cuz that's maybe good that's maybe gonna help me I'm not really sure but I'm gonna use I right now actually no no I'll still do use a four of loop let I'm gonna call it other of boyd's and I'm gonna just say average dot add other dot velocity so I'm adding up all of the velocities this is how you do an average write vectors right again you might want to go watch some of my videos about how vectors work but a vector a p5 vector just holds an X and a Y or an X and a wine is Z so I want to average the vector it's represent it as an arrow with an X component of Y component but on average it just like I might average under array of numbers I add them all up and divide by the total and then I would say average dot divided by Boyd's dot length this would be a way of getting a way of getting the average velocity of all of the voids but remember I only want the ones within some distance so actually let's implement that right now let's let's have some sort of distance like Max or uncle like perception equals let's just make it through arbitrary like 100 and then I'm going to now say if the distance between the distance between this dot position X or you know what I think there's a p5 this is fine it's just going to be it's kind of long the way I'm writing this but I don't mind if the distance let's actually make it in a variable D equals the distance between this boyd's position and the other boyd's position x and y and if that distance is less than 100 look at that look at this fancy thing that it's doing I have something like a prettier stuff that like doesn't 1 what you learned a long line of code I guess I'll keep that in there for right now so I'm calculating the distance between this Boyd's position the other Boyd's position and if that distance is less than 100 I'm adding it up and I should say I should also probably have a total number total equals zero add it up I also should probably ignore myself and if other well I should does not equal this right so I basically and I might as well put that first right as long as the other thing is not me and the distance is less than 100 add it up and then divide by the total but obviously I only want to divide by the total if total is greater than zero all right so this is kind of a little bit of a longwinded algorithm now but what oh and perception if d is less than perception so okay I'm starting with a perception a radius of 100 maybe that would be better as I call it like perception radius that's really what it is I'm starting with a perception radius of 100 an empty vector I'm adding up the velocity is of any vector any any Boyd that's near me dividing by the total and as long as I found one dividing by that total and you know I probably should like run this to check this code but I'm just gonna I'm gonna keep going so now here's the thing I could just say like for example I could do something weird this would be really weird I could just say this dot velocity equals average like what if I did that and then I said Boyd like here I said Boyd dot align flock and I don't know what's gonna happen here but let's refresh this right they just basically don't go anywhere because they're all instantly equal to each other's velocity so that's not really a good way what I need to do now is I if I don't want to actually assign its velocity to that average directly I want to steer towards it and this is where Craig Reynolds steering formula comes in a steer force equals some desired velocity minus the current actual velocity it's kind of like the error right if I and moving this way so if I'm sorry moving this way but I want to move this way the way I'm moving the way I want to move is oh no sorry where's my eraser desired minus velocity the way I want to move the way I am moving is the steering force meaning push me in that direction so apply a force maybe I'm gonna turn the steering wheel you could think of these as bees or cars or Birds or whatever but this formula desired velocity will give me the steering force and what is the desired velocity here the desired velocity is actually that average so I'm actually going to rename this to desired and I'm going to add it up and divide by total and then I'm going to say this dot velocity equals no I'm not gonna say that I'm gonna say steering equals and I can actually just I should actually call this steering because I could do all this I can I don't need to save anything as I'm going so I'm gonna call that the steering force I'm gonna add all the velocities I'm gonna divide by the total and then I'm going to say steering force is the desired subtract this dot velocity and I'm going to say returned steering so I want this function to basically I want this function to return that force so really what I should be doing is I should have I'm gonna write a function called flock that's maybe a or like yeah flock with some number of Boyd's and then I'm gonna say a line meant equals a line with those Boyd's so I'm gonna get this force and I suppose we're okay steering is here so you know what I should always return steering so I want to always return a vector but if it didn't find anything I'll just return the zero vector and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say acceleration add alignment so the idea the way that if that a physics engine works and this has to do with and this is like a very simple kind of crude physics engine but force equals mass times acceleration this is Newton's law of motion or acceleration equals force divided by mass or in a world where the mass of everything is one acceleration equals force so if I want to apply a force to this object I just need to set the acceleration to that force and actually so that's what I'm going to do just starting out here I'm going to say acceleration equals alignment okay so now if I go back to sketch and I say Boyd dot flock Boyd's we should now have all the Boyd's you doing that one with just just implemented with that align alignment rule let's see Boyd's is not defined sketch touch is line 14 oh it's called flock oh this is my variable naming is terrible but I'm gonna leave it that way right now a line is not defined Boyd is a line Boyd's oh this dotted line this dotted line Boyd's oops acceleration is not define oh my goodness that's not much better ah okay so let's think about this I so so it's kind of working let me um let me give them a much higher burst of speed because I think and all them starting in the same place actually also let's let's do a couple things let me actually not have them all start in the same place because that is just to see this effect happen let me actually start them in random places on the screen so we changed that let me make the perception race a little bit smaller and I don't know why this matters but let me draw them like a little bit smaller okay so you can see and let me actually have them start out going quite a bit faster so you can see as they get near each other they start to they start to get each other's velocity sort to average each other velocity with their neighbors and you can start to see these clumps moving together now these Boyd's to steer with like infinite power in a way like I'm saying hey your your steering force is the difference between your desired velocity and your current velocity and this apply that directly to the acceleration but if you think about it if you're driving a car you know in a car racing game for example is this concept of handling like how well can that car steer so we should probably have a variable we should probably have a variable I'm gonna call it max force and I'm gonna set it equal to one for a second and then what I'm going to do is here I'm gonna say a steering limit this dot max force so this what this does is it limits the magnitude the length of that vector to some maximum force so this should be exactly the same right we're not seeing anything different but if I were to make maximum force like 0.01 like really small right now you're gonna see like they're not actually change their velocity they are but very very slowly and the other thing we're really gonna need to do I just have to like give up and do this I'm gonna add some something for the edges here so I'm gonna say if this dot position dot X is greater than the width this dot position dot X should equal 0 else if this stop position dot X is less than 0 this stop position dot x equals width so and then I'm just gonna do that for the Y why are you here why did the terminal open I have no idea I think I hit like a key command that made that happen and then we're going to do this for y and I could do this in so many different more thoughtful or refactored ways but this is gonna be good oh no what am i doing okay with with xx YY YY y xx xx xx with with alright now here let's do buoyed edges so we should see them reappear wrapping around and now let's go back to the boid and let's make this like point 2 is kind of reasonable ish so interestingly enough there kind of like it slows them down which is sort of which is interesting and there's but I'm only doing alignment right now but you could see how this works right you can see they're all starting to align with each other what I could keep them going it's a minimum velocity which might make sense and you could see how these are like kind of going back and forth but you get the idea or Alanna why are they all slowing down is that just like a coincidence one thing I could do is one thing I could do this this is actually gonna be worth it because I should also give them a maximum speed like they like I this is going to be a parameter of a variable that's gonna allow me to control the system pretty well and I could consider their desired velocity in the alignment to not actually be the actual average velocity but just the average direction because I could then say steering dot set magnitude to this dot maximum speed so basically I'm saying like I always want to go in the direction of my neighbors but at maximum speed and I don't know that that's really an important detail but if I add that in here we might get the effect that I was sort of hoping to get which now this is what I was expecting to see as they get near each other they're all starting to align together let me refresh that one more time you can see that they're clumping and as they group they all start to align so this is the alignment rule this is a very simple rule it's predictable it's obvious this is alignment how many more rules do we have to do at one point I messed up the camera didn't I well whatever some fancy postproduction thing that not you can maybe do let me pause for a second there's gonna be an edit point alright 1206 all right all right half an hour so far all right it's going to move faster now I think let me uh cycle the cameras okay so that is alignment whoohoo alignment now all we need to do is add cohesion and separation so separation is going to be the hardest one to do so let's do cohesion next so the same thing we're going to look at our neighbors we should go back to what the rule is actually defined as let's go back to Craig Reynolds original page cohesion steer to move toward the average position of local flock mates okay this is actually not going to be that hard because we've already calculated the average velocity of local flock mates now let's just duplicate that code and I know I know we could refactor it I won't play the song because we could probably do this all in one fell swoop there's so many possibilities but now I just want to get the average location of my local flock mates and steer towards that all right so I'm gonna the way I'm gonna do that in and I'm just gonna I'm just gonna go nuts and copy/paste this whole thing and call it cohesion and I'm gonna keep the perception radius I'm gonna keep this idea of steering keep this idea of total go through all the Boyd's check the distance between myself and the other ones as long as they're not myself and within the perception radius what am i doing steering ad not the others velocity but the others position then right so this should clearly be refactored into its own function what whatever then as long as I have at least one I'm going to divide by the total now I don't want to set the magnitude to the maximum speed so what I have now in steering is the average location so if this is the average location well let's say it's over here then what I need is a vector that probably that's clearly not the average location but let's just say it was the average location is kind of like where this Boyd is but I want to steer in that direction so to get a vector in that direction I take the average location minus the current position of me which is basically saying now what I want to do is say steering subtract this stop position so subtract my position out I have a vector that's pointing from me to the average location remember which is in the steering variable then let's say I want to go at maximum speed and then I want to though so this is now my desired velocity I'm going to subtract out my current velocity limit it to max force and there we go that's cohesion so now in where is that in flock let cohesion equal this dot cohesion boyd's and then oh we have a big problem this dot acceleration equals alignment this dot acceleration equals cohesion so how can I set the acceleration to two different forces but before I even answer that there's an easy answer to that question let's just comment out alignment and let's watch cohesion happen right we can see they start to group together this is cohesion happening bate and that neighbor radius by the way is a super important value right that neighbor radius if I were to change that and I have a different one that perception radius if I were to change that to like ten thousand right they're all going to come together as one because they all see everybody if I were to change that to 10 right there really those little pairs like you could see that kind of get in little groups of two the force though isn't so strong so like if I were to change the maximum force right to like one now you see them they should almost like these little like electron thingies that like start magnetic things that start to like spin around each other and then fan off ah okay so there's so many possibilities here you know I can make the maximum speed to oh I'm not actually limiting you could see there we go that's what I was looking for you can see they get into these little groups but let me go back and say maximum speed is for the maximum force is point two and I realized this maximum of speed is not actually a maximum speed because in update if I really wanted it to be a maximum speed I would want to say this dot velocity limit this dot max speed so let's actually add that in and see what we get this is oh and let's put the perception radius back at 100 and there we go so now we have cohesion so we have cohesion what happens if we have cohesion and alignment how do we get cohesion and alignment okay this is really working it's gonna be a really long video all right cohesion and alignment the problem rests here it's is actually a really easy thing to solve because this is called force acute the answer yours force accumulation in physics if two forces are acting on an object the resulting acceleration is the sum of those forces so all I need to do is say acceleration dot add alignment and acceleration dot add cohesion right because why is this not falling because the force of gravity is pointed this way and the other force of my hands holding it up is pointed in the other direction and with an equal magnitude therefore it is at rest those two forces have a net added together have a net acceleration of zero but obviously so I need to add them together but there is this if I actually do this right now we're gonna see some really crazy behavior this looks like it's kind of working but it really isn't because what it should also have is this acceleration shouldn't accumulate over time at every moment in time I start with a net acceleration an acceleration of zero and add all the forces together so what I should do right before I flock is say this dot acceleration set zero zero this is setting its values to zero and zero another way I could do that is just multiplying it by zero there's multiplying a vector by zero takes everything out it could make a new vector or whatever but this will work nicely and technically this also might make more sense here this is kind of like after I finish updating the velocity then I can reset the acceleration in case there's other things at play so now we can see both cohesion and separation I'm sorry cohesion and alignment are at play look at this eventually they're just all going to become this one clump come on you can catch up catch up one club okay um one thing I would like to do I really want to attach sliders to those parameters but I've got to resist because we got to add separation hey we've got alignment and cohesion separation this one's a little bit hard let's look at it hmm wait come on scroll steer to avoid crowding local flock mates steer to avoid crowding local flock mates okay so we have the idea where's my eraser we have the idea of a local flock mate let's kind of erase this for a second to just deal with two here's me that's me here's my local flock mate if this local flock mate is too close it's within some sort of distance threshold I want to steer to avoid that what would be my desired velocity my desired velocity would be to move in the opposite direction so the idea is my desired velocity is in the observer but what if there is one here my desired velocity would also be in this opposite direction so then my net desired velocity would be the average of these two and it even would make sense for the magnitude of that desired velocity to be proportional to the distance so if this one is here I maybe want to avoid it but I only really need to think about avoiding it a little bit if this one's really close I need to avoid it a lot so the magnitude of the vector is inversely proportional to the distance of the local flock mate and so this might end up with kind of like a desired velocity of something like this if I'm averaging those two together okay so let's see if we can implement that not gonna be super easy but let's do it okay so the nice thing is I'm gonna start with cohesion because we've kind of cohesion as close to separation and again boy I should show you that I'm wearing my I will effective displayed our tshirt by the way okay so separation so I'm gonna leave this at a hundred steering I think I might need to use more like I I kind of like the idea of just having one vector that ends up is it's sort of the average here then it's kind of like the difference but I think I need I think I need to think I need that's the one step at a time so I'm creating this vector if so this is the same if it's not me and it's within the perception radius what do I need I need a vector I'm gonna call it difference which is the others I want a vector sorry that points from I want a vector that points from the other from the other to me because I want that to what go to the opposite direction so it's my position the other so I want a vector a new vector which is the diff subtraction between my position and the others position so this is a way of calling the subtract function which doesn't operate on a vector but subtracts two vectors and gives us a new vector which is difference then I want the difference to be inversely proportional to that distance so I'm going to multiply it or set its magnitude something like that I mean this is making it I'm gonna devour divided by distance I could just say divided by distance right it's inversely proportional the farther away it is the lower the the higher the the farther away it is the lower the magnitude the closer the higher the magnitude okay and the distance I guess technically that distance could be zero and that would be problematic but with floating point math we're almost never going to get a value of zero okay then I want to add then that is the thing I add up that's the thing I want to average all those vectors that are pointed away from the things near me I think we're actually in pretty good shape here this isn't as hard I thought oh that was done this is the tricky part here so get a vector that's pointing away from the local flock mate make it inversely proportional to the distance add it up then this is the same because oh no no I don't need to subtract position I kind of don't know if I want to I let's leave this it's let's leave this whole always go at maximum speed thing and then the rest is the same the rest of the same right once I have that just average it set it to max speed subtract out the velocity and limit it to maximum force and that's the end okay so let's see so now just to be sure that this is right pause for a second okay just to be sure that this is right let's go into boid let's go to flock let's add that lets up separation equal this dot separation and then let's add in separation and I want to not bother adding cohesion and alignment so I just want to see separation right now oh and William in the chat is saying 1 divided by distance squared maybe that's probably a good idea squaring the distance that's to make it quadratic or whatever that's probably smart I bet you if you read this full explanation it does something like that but let's just see so are these separating yeah it looks like they are it looks like that when they get close to each other they're kind of moving away from each other weird weird behavior do I have this isn't it look exactly like what I expected let's let's give them maximum force like just like really let them be super strong about separating yeah there we go okay so that's more like what actually that's way too strong yeah why do they feel like there something is weird here like I think my inversely proportional thing is wrong what's going on let's go back to separate Oh it's perception race is one and there's just so many of them that they can't all separate with this is what I expected to see and I think it actually it wasn't really a bug in my code it's sort of a bug in my conceptual sense of how this works and also maybe the inversely proportional thing so a couple things that I might do here it's like what if I take this out and then also let's try dividing by distance Square to kind of like that idea to make that whoa that's weird that makes them want to stop is that because oh because their desired velocity ends up being oh yeah it actually has to be maximum speed because if if in other words if their desired velocity is like oh I'm far enough apart I my desired velocity is now zero then it's going to make me want to like stop yes because I'm already always returning an empty vector ah what I could do is instead of returning an empty vector I return a null vector and don't bother adding that as a force but that all aside let's leave it at there's so many ways you could change or alter this though this is pretty good this is what I wanted to see this is separation only so now we should be able to see and let's I'm gonna do this really quickly I'm going to not be thoughtful at all about the interface but just so I can debug this effectively I am going to going to sketch j/s I am gonna say let a line slider cohesion slider and separation slider and I should use oh and I'm just gonna say a line slider equals create slider I'm gonna give it a range between 1 and 5 with and actually just give it a range between zero sorry zero and five with a starting value of one and increment value of 0.1 so I want to do this for all of these sliders cohesion slider separation slider and then in Boyde i want to say where i calling flock I want to just scale them so I'm gonna say separation sly oops separation dot multiply separation slider value and then I'm gonna do this also for cohesion and for alignment doesn't really matter the order but I probably should be consistent just for like just gonna always mean the order doesn't matter at all but I'm so this is separation slider a line slider and cohesion slider or those the names so again I'm not thinking about design or interaction design or visual designer any of that just wanted to quickly put three sliders in there and now so by the way flocking so this is now the flocking simulation I didn't draw in this triangles they're not rotating but this is the flocking simulation but just for the sake of argument this should be what order did I make them in like they're not labeled alignment cohesion so I want to do yeah alignment cohesion separation that's the order that I thought of them in so let's just turn all the way up separation oh boy let's let's turn off right this is only separation now turn that off let's turn on only alignment whoa wait no that's oh they're just the alignment is so strong when the alignment is so strong it makes them like go in circles around each other I'll talk about why so let me just decrease those ranges so there's a little bit of an issue here which is that look at with the previous ones updated value right instead of taking a snapshot of all their current velocities and then each one updates based on that snapshot I start with a set of velocities I update the first one based on that set of velocities and now its new velocity is there so when the next one it's actually updating itself based on the previous one that I updated which is not how the world works it's not how time works but that's causing them to like ripple into each other based on the order and go in circles that is something that you might want to consider fixing I'm not going to fix that but now I can really play with these I can get different sort of qualities of flocking based on how strong I make these rules so no alignment a lot of cohesion no separation add a lot of separation less cohesion I mean separation I shouldn't make too strong but it's important and let's add some alignment back in and there we go flocking whoa okay this coding challenge is complete it is done I will be uploading the code you will if you want you can look in the video description to find the code as a snapshot as exactly what it is let's go make a list let's make a list on the board of things you might try to do and I'm going to take suggestions from the chat and make your own version of this and you can hashtag coding flocking coding train flocking I don't know but let's let me make a list of some things you might try number one is do deal shoot okay I'm hold on time out and ity edit this I'm throwing away these markers that don't work me in the hallway there we go okay alright number one snapshot of all velocities that's gonna be my code for that number two op an optimization you can do is called a spatial subdivision or a quadtree optimization one of the things that makes this really slow and I'll just show you here for a second is if I were to try to do this with a thousand Boyd's right look how slow this is but you have to realize it's not a big deal for p5 to draw a thousand things moving why it's fine drawing a thousand things moving but as soon as I put flock the flock function in it's super slow the reason that is is because it's got to do and every boyd again check every board against every other boy check and so there's a way of subdividing the space spatial subdivision into bins or buckets and have the boys only checked ones that are near each other in the same buckets and that's called you know i probably have a lot of distance the distance calculation i could reduce the number of times I call it but for this quadtree or just simple spatial sum of subdivision so these are things you could try these are just code refactoring really actually the other okay the other thing you could try another thing you could try is hold on sorry I lost my train of thought oh train of thought because it was related to this spatial subdivision thing optimize well maybe there's some suggestions in the chat right now had attractors or trees multiple yeah fix the velocity snap trapezoid make believe that I'm just looking at the chat I had something in my head that was the third thing snapshot of all the velocities optimized quadtree and subdivision oh yeah I said reduce the distance squared whatever okay another thing you could try to do is really build a more sophisticated interface and there's lots of other parameters that you could control and try right there's the perception radius so we saw that you could change the weights to the weights for alignment cohesion and separation but there's also the perception radius there's maximum maximum force there's maximum speed you know each rule could have a set different perception radius so many possibilities so this is this is the stuff that you could do to like really control and tweak all the values and play with it you could another thing you could do is just design visual design like are they triangle circles are they flapping butterflies like how do you design of the voids like make your own beautiful visualization of how you design and draw them tadpole like how there's so many ideas there another thing you could try to do is 3d can you extrapolate this into 3d and and if you see the word quaternion anywhere you start to research you might want to turn back but but you could you could extrapolate this into 3d look there were some interesting suggestions oh right Boyd's with different parameters yeah so a sort of another suggestion which came from the chat thank you is Boyd's with different parameters right so there's no reason why every Boyd has to have the same max speed or maximum force they could same perception radius you could implement this thing called the view rule which is kind of interesting to think about I don't know why I'm going to I have a diagram of it but it's one of the things that right now is each Boyd there's two things about this one each boy can see everything around it but what if the Boyd itself could actually only see if it's moving in this direction things that are within its particular view in front of it maybe it doesn't deal with anything that's behind it doesn't try to use a cohesion or alignment or separation and then the view rule which is posited by flake in the book the computational beauty of nature I'll link to that book also it's a wonderful book with tons I'm probably like 90% of the things on my channel are all from the computational beauty of nature book but the flake positive to this additional rule that you always want to keep your view empty so if there is a Boyd in front of you you want to steer that way to keep your void your your view empty clear and this might result the theory is that this will result in something that looks more like that pattern that you'll see of actual birds flocking where they kind of appear almost in this triangular pattern so what's interesting about this right you see a pattern like this you think AHA this is a topdown behavior there is a leader this bird who is saying to all the other birds fan out for me and follow me but yet this type of intelligent behavior emergent phenomena can come actually only from simple local rules of in action and that's by the way this is what this whole video was about if you didn't gather that already okay buzz what are some other ideas other ideas might be open other ideas might be adding obstacles other forces there's you know thinking about these living in a world where they're interacting with other things maybe there's a predator that comes in and it's chasing them all sorts of unique and interesting possibilities okay so thank you everyone for watching this coding challenge put your other ideas for things people could do in the comments and then if you make your own version of this flocking code please go to the coding training com challenge page and submit a link to the what you made I will also make a virtue of this the runs in the web editor and linked to all those resources like the Craig Reynolds original paper about flocking the video on YouTube and the chapter in my nature of code book ok thanks for watching this coding challenge flocking and I'll see you soon okay alright everybody oh boy it's 1230 I definitely have to go I'm glad that I fit in this extra coding challenge and I'm actually recording it to disk so this can be edited I assume this is at least an hour right but hopefully this was useful thank you all these nice comments so when will I be back a week from tomorrow if I have to guess so there will be no live stream tomorrow this was today's coda train episode the next time I will be back is a week from tomorrow next Friday upcoming soon is a live stream from the ITP winter show if you're in the New York City area I highly recommend you to come to this this is the show of students work at ITP Sunday December I'll probably do a livestream from the show in the afternoon of Monday December 17th and then later that week hopefully on December 20 I'm gonna do a fundraiser telethon for the processing foundation but I got to figure out this super chat thing so that's that what else do I want to tell you ah if you live in Europe possibly in France or near the city of Paris coming soon I'm hoping to announce a workshop slash meetup that I'll be doing in Paris in early January so don't to say anything more about that because it's not settled I don't even like know exactly which date yet but stay tuned I'll announce it on Twitter I'll mention it again here but that I'm hoping to I'm have that which is the first ever possibly like I mean obviously I go to things and I've met people in my own little room here but anyway but this is exciting to me to try that especially I get to practice my terrible terrible French alright perfect hi yes Alka okay let's talk offline Alka about your suggestion to fly to New York City to help with the livestream for the effect actually I'm like it this is this is something I would seriously take under consideration okay motion TX thank you new member wait I want to figure this out there's a way that I can make a page and I have to like log in to my other guy I guess I can okay I want to make a popup thing happen when I get a new a new member in for math music says workshop in Paris I live in Paris excellent I would love to go everywhere frankly traveling is hard inexpensive and uses a lot of energy both the world's energy and my own energy and I have like these small children that I spend a lot of time with and a family and so I can't really just go everywhere but I dream of going everywhere I would really like to go to Japan I'm willing to go I've ever been to anywhere in the Middle East ever been to Japan urban Africa I've never been to Australia New Zealand these are just things that are popping I've been to a lot of places in Europe and Canada been very very few places in South America I don't know world tour coding train World Tour coming soon thanks everybody and in for mock music if you to the Meetup you will see me I will be bringing my stickers I will be bringing the coding train stickers thanks everyone and yeah Norway ah I have been to Norway so lol elo leaves just thinking what can I tell you about my favorite place one of my favorite places in the world rune de Norway this small island off the coast of Norway called rune de which I believe means bird island is one of my absolute favorite places at certain times of year you can go see the puffins I went on this like sixhour hike mostly six out really long hike all the way to this lighthouse that you can only get to by hiking and then you can just sleep there overnight didn't we like back but this place is amazing I really want to go back there there's a centre there which is like a bird science site anyway if someone can figure out a way that we can do like a live coding train from the island of rune de that would be awesome Dominican Republic that would be a Brazil all these amazing places all over the world here's a nice picture of runasan unda it was where did I stay I stayed at the this the bird center there Environmental Center yeah research safe so I stayed here you can actually just stay there like it's for scientists but you can also just book a room there because I am NOT a scientist the Runet environment is as a research station with four main activities oh this is perfect for flocking let's let's look up actually I was in a Norwegian I'm not kidding anybody could find this I had it buried in my computer somewhere I was I'm in a Norwegian Travel Magazine with my family because they were there shooting photos to be like I think it was a Travel Magazine and we were like the only people standing on the island because it was like kind of the wrong time of year to visit there were no puffins rune de Norway puffins al it's near ålesund um so yeah these are the puffins of rune de noir Yeah right it's bit I see these photos and I'm like terrified because they're all through these like cliffs you could go right up to the edge like we were doing that I think about it and like oh my god we're we doing something really dangerous this place is amazing Cody train is sponsored by the Norwegian travel Council no not at all but you know it's very expensive in Norway I mean I think I won I don't think hopefully it's not for people who live there because they have excellent services you know health care and those types of things but as a tourist there's incredibly expensive food food was so that is and I don't know I have to say it didn't love the food or oh yeah I had some really interesting things to eat and I spent a little time in Oslo and there's some like really awesome restaurants there but there was just I don't know maybe it's hard like it's like dark and wintry I love you Norway all right I think by the way the author of the Iowa factor the Sun is I have to go I'm like super lazy alright goodbye everybody please refactor my pocket code I got to get it in the editor or the coding train account soon this challenge will probably be up edited next week sometime and I will see you I'm going to I am going to stop the livestream on this page where's that page shoot I don't have it open okay no live control room one thing that I by the way one thing that I'm planning on doing mpj gave me this idea I mean I could have thought of this myself but lots of people do this is getting a loop for like stream about to start loop for thanks for watching and like a loop for like be right back like fun little coding train animation thingies anybody wants to make some of those I mean I would be glad to hire somebody in you know Matthew who does video editing has a lot of talents and might be interested in working on this I don't mean to ask for things for free but if you're interested if you're an animator and you like rainbows and coding stuff and you wanna help me make some crazy interstitial stuff that I could put an open broadcast studio get in touch okay stop streaming and I'll see you all later
