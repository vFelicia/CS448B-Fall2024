00:01 - hello uh this is probably one of the
00:03 - strangest videos I've ever made I
00:05 - haven't actually made it yet but I see
00:07 - into the future this uh but I I found a
00:10 - strange bug issue in P5 Jazz I just
00:12 - don't know what to do about it at all so
00:14 - I'm kind of filing a GitHub Video issue
00:17 - I will type an actual GitHub issue but
00:20 - this might be useful for some of you
00:21 - wondering about open source how it works
00:24 - where things are and there's probably a
00:26 - lot of stuff I'm going to gloss over
00:28 - here but maybe you'll find this useful
00:29 - to watch watch maybe you won't but let
00:31 - me give you some background here I was
00:32 - making a simple p5js
00:36 - sketch I'm I'm going to I'm doing this
00:38 - in Sublime with the Chrome browser all
00:41 - this sketch is doing is creating a video
00:43 - element and what I wanted to do was look
00:45 - at the pixels of this
00:48 - video but the video by
00:51 - default the video by default is 3 well
00:55 - well you'll see in a second is if I
00:57 - rerun this it's coming in from my web
00:59 - camera at 64 by 480 but I want to shrink
01:02 - it down and I want those pixels to be
01:03 - shrunk down so I call the P5 size
01:08 - function and once I call the P5 size
01:11 - function it shrinks the video and the
01:14 - pixels should also shrink so let me show
01:16 - you what I mean in the Chrome console
01:18 - here I can say video. load pixels this
01:21 - is a function that would then make the
01:23 - pixels available of that video now so
01:26 - I've loaded the pixels now if I were to
01:29 - look at at the pixel array where all the
01:31 - pixels are you'd think I would have a an
01:35 - array that has this many spots in it for
01:40 - every single color there are four spots
01:42 - in the array red green blue Alpha the
01:46 - width of the video image now is 320 the
01:48 - height is 240 so the total number of
01:50 - pixels should be 320 * 240 *
01:54 - 4 which is this particular number
01:58 - 37,200 however ever if I say video.
02:02 - pixels.
02:05 - length I get this weird
02:08 - number Wella that's not what should have
02:10 - happened hold on a second
02:11 - here everybody just
02:14 - relax and by everybody I mean
02:17 - me um I think I might have uh messed
02:20 - something up so uh I just need to very
02:23 - quickly make sure I'm using the actual
02:27 - um oh this video is rude
02:30 - uh skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead
02:33 - um uh I'm going to I going to make sure
02:36 - I'm getting the uh most recent I I was
02:39 - fussing with the Dom
02:41 - library and
02:45 - uh I probably made it do something it
02:48 - shouldn't have done so I'm going to go
02:51 - and paste this in there then I am going
02:55 - to uh refresh this and I'm going to do
02:58 - the same exact thing video . pix pixels.
03:02 - length you can see that's of course zero
03:04 - because I haven't called load pixels yet
03:06 - once I do that yes okay so I had already
03:11 - fed with the Dom library in trying to
03:13 - debug this but now I'm using the actual
03:16 - current state of the Dom library look at
03:18 - that particular number right remember we
03:20 - said it should be 320 * 240 * 4 which is
03:23 - that number what is that number that
03:25 - number is 640 by 480 * 4 because even
03:29 - though I've resized the video the pixels
03:32 - are still at the original resolution
03:33 - which is not what I want the P5 library
03:35 - to do why is this happening so um what I
03:40 - can do is actually go in now I'm
03:42 - actually this is actually the P5 Dom
03:44 - Library it's a ton of code we could be
03:46 - here for like the next four hours going
03:48 - through all of it I happen to know that
03:51 - very deep in this code is a
03:53 - place where when I call load pixels this
03:56 - thing happens where it makes it behind
03:59 - the sc's canvas and the canvas is made
04:01 - with the video width and the video
04:03 - height I want that canvas to be made
04:05 - 320x
04:07 - 240 now a long time ago I don't know
04:11 - when I can look it up here I actually
04:14 - posted a GitHub issue so now I'm on
04:16 - GitHub I'm in the p5js repository on
04:18 - GitHub and there is a particular issue I
04:21 - posted called P5 media element size and
04:24 - this is uh I'm writing a description
04:27 - Lauren McCarthy and I just talked about
04:29 - blah blah blah blah blah blah and I
04:30 - noticed that there's a problem where the
04:33 - canvas is being set to video width and
04:35 - video height where it actually should
04:37 - get the Dom elements width and height
04:39 - and this somehow like fixes this problem
04:42 - and in fact we can say oh thanks for
04:45 - catching this Lauren this is there was
04:47 - something tricky with this Lauren made a
04:49 - commit that changes it we can actually
04:51 - look at this commit right here oops
04:55 - sorry right here and I can pinpoint this
04:58 - is the commit it used to be video width
05:01 - video
05:03 - height and it used and that got changed
05:06 - to width and height so let's go and make
05:08 - that change in the actual code I'm going
05:10 - to go here right I could just check that
05:12 - I'm going to change that to width change
05:14 - this to width change this to height and
05:17 - I'm going to run my sketch
05:20 - again we can see what if I call now
05:22 - video. load
05:26 - pixels okay I called that and now I say
05:30 - what's that
05:31 - number what's that number it worked so
05:34 - that fixed it that line of code for this
05:36 - particular thing that I'm trying to do
05:38 - should be width and height not video
05:41 - width and video height which are still
05:42 - 640 x480 because they're referring to
05:44 - the original video width and video
05:46 - height now strangely enough that commit
05:50 - if I go back to the browser right that
05:54 - commit happened on January 15th what's
05:56 - today's date March something boy that
05:58 - was March 29
06:00 - I have no idea what the date is on my
06:02 - watch here ah it's March 29th Tuesday
06:03 - March 29th so I did some investigation
06:06 - and I went through and strangely enough
06:08 - I found another commit look at this this
06:11 - commit is 26 days ago early in March
06:13 - where this got changed back also by
06:17 - Lauren McCarthy well why did this happen
06:20 - so this is closing issue
06:22 - 1274 here's
06:24 - 1274 somebody else uh Keith O'Hara
06:27 - posted an issue they were running into
06:29 - problems using get blah blah blah so for
06:31 - some reason that change caused another
06:33 - problem and it got reverted forgetting
06:35 - that that would cause some other problem
06:36 - so we're in this like horrible circular
06:39 - problem causing so what do we do now I
06:41 - don't know the right answer but I have
06:43 - spent I spent at least two hours today
06:46 - not two hours I spent a lot of time
06:47 - because looking through digging through
06:49 - trying to pinpoint the exact commits
06:50 - where this has happened so I think live
06:53 - on air live from the school for poetic
06:55 - computation this sounds very grandiose
06:57 - it's not grandiose I'm in I'm just like
06:59 - a person typing at a computer but I
07:01 - would like to uh uh contribute to this
07:04 - discussion and see if we can figure this
07:05 - out so I don't know there's a couple
07:08 - options here I could reopen this
07:13 - issue that might make the most sense
07:15 - this was the original place where I was
07:16 - discussing this and this is where this
07:18 - exact I'm showing this exact change
07:21 - needs to happen so this might make the
07:22 - most sense I could just comment on this
07:26 - particular commit there's a place here I
07:28 - could comment on the
07:30 - commit uh I could also like reopen this
07:33 - issue and say hey I think this caused a
07:35 - problem with another issue I don't know
07:37 - where the right places and by the way
07:38 - this is something that happens when
07:39 - you're like trying to file GitHub issues
07:41 - you always feel like you're doing it
07:42 - wrong and someone's going to yell at you
07:45 - and that does actually happen because
07:46 - people sometimes
07:47 - aren't they just aren't thinking and
07:49 - maybe typing tone is lost or sometimes
07:52 - people are just like not nice actually
07:54 - but I want to say to you that p5js is a
07:57 - place where anybody in the world can
07:58 - post a GI issue and there's no way to do
08:00 - it wrong so post away and if someone
08:04 - tells you you did it wrong come and find
08:06 - me because there's no way that was
08:08 - possible um but it's a welcoming place
08:10 - that anyone should be able to try to
08:11 - participate in this open source stuff so
08:14 - let me I don't I'm also not entirely
08:16 - sure the best way to do this but I'm
08:18 - gonna I'm going to just try reopening
08:20 - this particular issue so one um so one
08:24 - thing I'm going to do here is type into
08:26 - this uh box here and you guys can type
08:29 - with me or not type with me I'm gonna
08:31 - think okay um this particular fix was
08:36 - changed back due to issue so now I need
08:41 - to refer to this particular
08:43 - issue which is number
08:47 - 1274 1274 you can see how this
08:54 - commit which was this one which has this
08:57 - commit one thing you can always do is
08:58 - like see these like crazy numbers that
09:00 - GitHub makes these are like hash numbers
09:03 - it's like a unique identifier for that
09:05 - particular change so I can copy that and
09:08 - I can put that into my comment this
09:11 - changes uh and if I do a single tick by
09:14 - the way that makes it like code
09:16 - formatted changes video dot oh uh video
09:21 - dowith no no this
09:23 - dowith so hold on this is this. elt
09:28 - dowith
09:32 - back to
09:34 - this. el.
09:37 - videoi we seem to be in an
09:40 - endless cycle of changing this code back
09:45 - and
09:47 - forth um Can how do we how do we best
09:51 - resolve both of these
09:56 - issues
09:58 - um
10:00 - so I
10:02 - think
10:04 - um um I am making a video about this
10:10 - exact issue and when I upload that
10:15 - video I will post a link
10:19 - here um what else would be helpful in
10:23 - this GitHub issue so um just to be clear
10:28 - again the code that makes this issue
10:32 - that
10:34 - resolves this issue is so one thing you
10:38 - can do and you're going to add code into
10:40 - a GitHub issue is you can do three ticks
10:42 - and then if you want it syntax
10:43 - highlighted you can write the language
10:45 - there
10:47 - JavaScript and I need to grab this
10:56 - makes this makes this work the code that
11:03 - resolves um the other issue was 1274
11:08 - 1274
11:12 - is and then I can go looks like
11:21 - this can
11:24 - we how can we resolve
11:28 - both
11:31 - what code would
11:34 - resolve both
11:38 - okay so I think now one thing I can do
11:41 - is I can hit preview and you can see
11:42 - here now I can reread this it a little
11:47 - bigger this particular fixed was changed
11:49 - back due to issue
11:51 - 1274 and no longer works maybe I should
11:54 - say you can see how this Commit This
11:57 - commit how the commit let me let me fix
12:00 - this uh this particular fix was
12:07 - reverted and the
12:10 - pixels array length is does not
12:15 - match the
12:18 - specified size anymore you can see how
12:21 - the
12:23 - commit you can see how the commit this
12:25 - changes this. elt dowith back to this.
12:28 - el. video withth we seem to be an
12:29 - endless cycle changes code back and
12:31 - forth how do we best resolve both of
12:32 - these issues I'm making a video about
12:34 - this this
12:36 - question I'm making a video about this
12:39 - question and when I upload that video
12:41 - I'll post a link here just to be clear
12:43 - code resolves this issue the code that
12:44 - resolves this which what code will
12:46 - resolve both all right I think that's
12:49 - good
12:49 - enough I'm going to hit reopen and
12:52 - comment and see no I'm afraid like I'm
12:54 - afraid someone's going to yell at me but
12:55 - no of course no one's going to yell at
12:56 - me because for the whole world should be
12:59 - a welcoming place but sometimes on
13:01 - GitHub it can feel a little intimidating
13:02 - or confusing I want to say again p5js is
13:05 - an open community that welcomes
13:08 - everybody whatever your level or
13:10 - knowledge is there is no way to post a
13:12 - GitHub issue incorrectly um and so we
13:15 - should just give it a try and somebody
13:17 - will will tell me if I uh if I've
13:20 - there's a better way I could have done
13:21 - it or something like that I'm going to
13:22 - press this button and this concludes
13:25 - this particular video I'm just going to
13:26 - check by the way because I have a live
13:28 - chat going this is a recording and see
13:31 - um if anybody uh is has any
13:37 - comments uh yep okay nobody has any
13:40 - comments so I'm going to hit stop and
13:42 - this concludes this video see if this
13:45 - follow up we'll make we'll follow up in
13:46 - the comments in the threads in the
13:48 - description if this issue gets resolved

Cleaned transcript:

hello uh this is probably one of the strangest videos I've ever made I haven't actually made it yet but I see into the future this uh but I I found a strange bug issue in P5 Jazz I just don't know what to do about it at all so I'm kind of filing a GitHub Video issue I will type an actual GitHub issue but this might be useful for some of you wondering about open source how it works where things are and there's probably a lot of stuff I'm going to gloss over here but maybe you'll find this useful to watch watch maybe you won't but let me give you some background here I was making a simple p5js sketch I'm I'm going to I'm doing this in Sublime with the Chrome browser all this sketch is doing is creating a video element and what I wanted to do was look at the pixels of this video but the video by default the video by default is 3 well well you'll see in a second is if I rerun this it's coming in from my web camera at 64 by 480 but I want to shrink it down and I want those pixels to be shrunk down so I call the P5 size function and once I call the P5 size function it shrinks the video and the pixels should also shrink so let me show you what I mean in the Chrome console here I can say video. load pixels this is a function that would then make the pixels available of that video now so I've loaded the pixels now if I were to look at at the pixel array where all the pixels are you'd think I would have a an array that has this many spots in it for every single color there are four spots in the array red green blue Alpha the width of the video image now is 320 the height is 240 so the total number of pixels should be 320 * 240 * 4 which is this particular number 37,200 however ever if I say video. pixels. length I get this weird number Wella that's not what should have happened hold on a second here everybody just relax and by everybody I mean me um I think I might have uh messed something up so uh I just need to very quickly make sure I'm using the actual um oh this video is rude uh skip ahead skip ahead skip ahead um uh I'm going to I going to make sure I'm getting the uh most recent I I was fussing with the Dom library and uh I probably made it do something it shouldn't have done so I'm going to go and paste this in there then I am going to uh refresh this and I'm going to do the same exact thing video . pix pixels. length you can see that's of course zero because I haven't called load pixels yet once I do that yes okay so I had already fed with the Dom library in trying to debug this but now I'm using the actual current state of the Dom library look at that particular number right remember we said it should be 320 * 240 * 4 which is that number what is that number that number is 640 by 480 * 4 because even though I've resized the video the pixels are still at the original resolution which is not what I want the P5 library to do why is this happening so um what I can do is actually go in now I'm actually this is actually the P5 Dom Library it's a ton of code we could be here for like the next four hours going through all of it I happen to know that very deep in this code is a place where when I call load pixels this thing happens where it makes it behind the sc's canvas and the canvas is made with the video width and the video height I want that canvas to be made 320x 240 now a long time ago I don't know when I can look it up here I actually posted a GitHub issue so now I'm on GitHub I'm in the p5js repository on GitHub and there is a particular issue I posted called P5 media element size and this is uh I'm writing a description Lauren McCarthy and I just talked about blah blah blah blah blah blah and I noticed that there's a problem where the canvas is being set to video width and video height where it actually should get the Dom elements width and height and this somehow like fixes this problem and in fact we can say oh thanks for catching this Lauren this is there was something tricky with this Lauren made a commit that changes it we can actually look at this commit right here oops sorry right here and I can pinpoint this is the commit it used to be video width video height and it used and that got changed to width and height so let's go and make that change in the actual code I'm going to go here right I could just check that I'm going to change that to width change this to width change this to height and I'm going to run my sketch again we can see what if I call now video. load pixels okay I called that and now I say what's that number what's that number it worked so that fixed it that line of code for this particular thing that I'm trying to do should be width and height not video width and video height which are still 640 x480 because they're referring to the original video width and video height now strangely enough that commit if I go back to the browser right that commit happened on January 15th what's today's date March something boy that was March 29 I have no idea what the date is on my watch here ah it's March 29th Tuesday March 29th so I did some investigation and I went through and strangely enough I found another commit look at this this commit is 26 days ago early in March where this got changed back also by Lauren McCarthy well why did this happen so this is closing issue 1274 here's 1274 somebody else uh Keith O'Hara posted an issue they were running into problems using get blah blah blah so for some reason that change caused another problem and it got reverted forgetting that that would cause some other problem so we're in this like horrible circular problem causing so what do we do now I don't know the right answer but I have spent I spent at least two hours today not two hours I spent a lot of time because looking through digging through trying to pinpoint the exact commits where this has happened so I think live on air live from the school for poetic computation this sounds very grandiose it's not grandiose I'm in I'm just like a person typing at a computer but I would like to uh uh contribute to this discussion and see if we can figure this out so I don't know there's a couple options here I could reopen this issue that might make the most sense this was the original place where I was discussing this and this is where this exact I'm showing this exact change needs to happen so this might make the most sense I could just comment on this particular commit there's a place here I could comment on the commit uh I could also like reopen this issue and say hey I think this caused a problem with another issue I don't know where the right places and by the way this is something that happens when you're like trying to file GitHub issues you always feel like you're doing it wrong and someone's going to yell at you and that does actually happen because people sometimes aren't they just aren't thinking and maybe typing tone is lost or sometimes people are just like not nice actually but I want to say to you that p5js is a place where anybody in the world can post a GI issue and there's no way to do it wrong so post away and if someone tells you you did it wrong come and find me because

I'm gonna think okay um this particular fix was changed back due to issue so now I need to refer to this particular issue which is number 1274 1274 you can see how this commit which was this one which has this commit one thing you can always do is like see these like crazy numbers that GitHub makes these are like hash numbers it's like a unique identifier for that particular change so I can copy that and I can put that into my comment this changes uh and if I do a single tick by the way that makes it like code formatted changes video dot oh uh video dowith no no this dowith so hold on this is this. elt dowith back to this. el. videoi we seem to be in an endless cycle of changing this code back and forth um Can how do we how do we best resolve both of these issues um so I think um um I am making a video about this exact issue and when I upload that video I will post a link here um what else would be helpful in this GitHub issue so um just to be clear again the code that makes this issue that resolves this issue is so one thing you can do and you're going to add code into a GitHub issue is you can do three ticks and then if you want it syntax highlighted you can write the language there JavaScript and I need to grab this makes this makes this work the code that resolves um the other issue was 1274 1274 is and then I can go looks like this can we how can we resolve both what code would resolve both okay so I think now one thing I can do is I can hit preview and you can see here now I can reread this it a little bigger this particular fixed was changed back due to issue 1274 and no longer works maybe I should say you can see how this Commit This commit how the commit let me let me fix this uh this particular fix was reverted and the pixels array length is does not match the specified size anymore you can see how the commit you can see how the commit this changes this. elt dowith back to this. el. video withth we seem to be an endless cycle changes code back and forth how do we best resolve both of these issues I'm making a video about this this question I'm making a video about this question and when I upload that video I'll post a link here just to be clear code resolves this issue the code that resolves this which what code will resolve both all right I think that's good enough I'm going to hit reopen and comment and see no I'm afraid like I'm afraid someone's going to yell at me but no of course no one's going to yell at me because for the whole world should be a welcoming place but sometimes on GitHub it can feel a little intimidating or
