00:13 - hello I am here I am back
00:17 - it is Friday it is 4:30 p.m.
00:21 - wouldn't it be 9:00 in New York City
00:23 - wouldn't it be nice to just say it's
00:26 - five o'clock on a Friday I'm out of here
00:28 - weekend time but no I'm gonna code
00:35 - something before I go I have done
00:37 - something to my back
00:39 - I have often had like back strain and I
00:43 - do a lot of exercises and stretching
00:45 - unfortunately this morning I was helping
00:48 - my daughter get ready for school
00:50 - I like we were in a rush I like reached
00:52 - over and I did something so I'm a little
00:54 - bit off of my game and I was so thrilled
00:58 - to have Stefania visit the coding train
01:01 - goes like oh good I'm not feeling so
01:03 - great today and I hadn't have a guess
01:05 - it's this really interesting topic and
01:07 - she's so dynamic so that was wonderful
01:09 - thank you if you don't know what I'm
01:10 - talking about
01:11 - between 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock I had a
01:14 - livestream with a guest stephania
01:16 - doodoo guide you can go back and watch
01:18 - that from Romania her wonderful project
01:22 - kogda means okay so but I kind of I feel
01:25 - like I need to send the weekend off with
01:27 - a coding challenge I have a bunch of
01:29 - topics that I'm really trying to do as
01:31 - part of my kind of more multi-session
01:34 - course materials word Tyvek is kind of
01:37 - what I am focusing on right now some
01:40 - more machine learning topics and some
01:42 - other things that I have in the back of
01:43 - my mind but I think I'd like to just
01:45 - code something ridiculous and fun and
01:47 - nice that maybe people could make their
01:49 - own version of and then go and start the
01:51 - weekend and do a lot of like resting and
01:53 - stretching and that sort of thing all
01:56 - right so all right so a continuous line
02:04 - drawing I wondered if you could recreate
02:08 - although I'm looking at this looking at
02:11 - this topic suggested by Nate
02:13 - here in the chat let me look at this I
02:16 - have an idea by the way it's for what to
02:18 - do
02:20 - using processing to scribble curves
02:23 - based on image brightness whoa that is
02:28 - really cool huh hold I'm looking at this
02:38 - let me go find this one I really I do
02:39 - like this idea this is definitely
02:41 - something I could do something around
02:44 - let me go to rainbow topics github.com
02:52 - slash coding train so this is where I
02:55 - kind of keep a list of topics one that I
02:59 - was thinking of doing was turtle
03:02 - graphics Oh continuous line drawing here
03:06 - it is open three days ago
03:07 - why not so look at this to scribble
03:13 - curves based on image brightness
03:16 - this is q-tip of A Tribe Called Quest to
03:20 - commemorate the release of the Low End
03:22 - Theory 27 years ago I like this idea
03:25 - thinking about this I hope you think
03:26 - about how I would do this I mean I guess
03:29 - I could read so first of all I'm always
03:31 - wary of taking somebody else's idea and
03:37 - then making co-opting somebody else's
03:40 - idea in a way that's not appropriate I
03:41 - think this could be a fun thing to try
03:45 - crediting this I guess reddit author as
03:50 - the originator of this idea and it
03:52 - doesn't look like the code I guess I
03:56 - have to read this it's more complicated
03:57 - but for three different brightness
03:59 - ranges the code starts shape at a random
04:02 - non-white pixel from the image then it
04:04 - randomly checks the other XY coordinates
04:06 - for pixels from the image that are close
04:09 - and brightness and close in location it
04:11 - finds one it adds as a curve vertex and
04:13 - marks the surrounding pixels as done so
04:16 - they won't get picked up by the
04:17 - algorithm in subsequent loots after it
04:19 - finds a lot of points that add a curve
04:20 - vertex to it ends the shape and moves
04:22 - to the next brightness range interesting
04:26 - interesting
04:28 - there's a lot of random point guessing
04:30 - which makes the algorithm inefficient
04:31 - but it can draw one of these images in
04:33 - five to ten seconds and I like the
04:34 - random search result all right let's
04:36 - let's try to do this
04:38 - why not what's the wide beam I bail and
04:43 - by moving really slowly today oh I'm
04:46 - definitely do this is this great because
04:48 - I can do this in processing I'm sure it
05:04 - won't make something as nice as this but
05:09 - I like it
05:10 - alright hold on let me read that again
05:13 - three different brightness ranges the
05:17 - code starts a shape at a random not
05:18 - white pixel it then randomly checks the
05:22 - other XY coordinates four pixels from
05:24 - the image that are close in brightness
05:26 - and close in location oh all right so I
05:30 - had a different way of doing this maybe
05:32 - I'll try my way this way it's probably
05:34 - better this way it's better I'm sure
05:40 - Valerio is asking for my opinion on the
05:42 - whole christie's ai artwork fiasco I
05:45 - know please don't make me try to talk
05:47 - about that I'm just gonna cry so ya know
05:53 - pac-man sorry a lot of people are asking
05:55 - for pac-man that's I'm not gonna do that
05:57 - today I was thinking what if I tried to
06:03 - trace yeah yeah maybe I should try this
06:19 - I'm a little weary I just like God I
06:22 - feel like this person has invented
06:24 - something really interesting and I
06:26 - should let that without their permission
06:27 - I should let them have the opportunity
06:29 - to publish their code so I'm actually
06:31 - gonna hold off on this but I do like
06:33 - this idea if somebody wants to contact
06:35 - this author
06:36 - find out the next five minutes but I
06:39 - think I wouldn't want to do this without
06:41 - their permission
06:44 - okay
06:45 - so I'm gonna hold off for a little bit
06:48 - on that I do like that idea though go
06:51 - back to the chat here all right okay
06:56 - Nathan sorry not my idea yes one thing I
06:59 - wanted to do is actually just program a
07:00 - turtle graphics engine which just means
07:02 - all you could do is say forward forward
07:04 - left right which would be kind of
07:06 - interesting and people could build on
07:09 - top of that and then I have this other
07:13 - idea so something that I'm to do that
07:15 - we're doing here at ITP where I teach
07:17 - which is a workshop about generating
07:19 - project ideas and this tool is something
07:22 - that's in progress don't than p5 which
07:25 - will generate a random project idea make
07:29 - a project about imagination that spins a
07:36 - motor with pong I don't have a motor so
07:38 - I gotta expand it again make a project
07:48 - about hunger
07:50 - that tickles with a particle system hmm
07:57 - logo
07:58 - let's make logo let's make logo these
08:02 - are great I'll come back and use this
08:04 - let's make logo coding challenge logo
08:08 - should we use processing probably we
08:11 - should use p5.js shall we use the web
08:14 - editor why not
08:22 - so what is logo like what are the
08:27 - Wikipedia what are the Felix says maybe
08:32 - try a simple Tetris implementation no I
08:34 - the things that I would like to do next
08:36 - when I want to do a Rubik's Cube
08:39 - everyone keeps asking about that and
08:40 - there was another one that was in my
08:41 - head I don't know I can't remember now
08:47 - but there's another one that was in my
08:48 - head
08:49 - no not this logo logo turtle graphics
08:54 - look turtle is there a disambiguation
08:57 - page turtle graphics logo there we go is
09:05 - what I'm looking for so we are going to
09:07 - create them so what are the actual
09:09 - elements of the language is there a way
09:13 - that I could the original logo from 1967
09:16 - is there a way I could find out what the
09:18 - commands were so commands in logo commit
09:29 - original logo commands logo tutorial
09:36 - could this be it from 1997 forward
09:43 - backward right left clear screen okay
09:48 - each of these commands are followed by
09:50 - one value called its argument the
09:53 - arguments for forward and backward are
09:55 - units those of right and left are angles
09:59 - I say forward units backwards right an
10:02 - angle left an angle CS clear screen so
10:05 - what I want to make is a logo
10:08 - interpreter so I'll use like a text box
10:14 - I'll use a text box that the user can
10:20 - enter in these commands I'm gonna need
10:23 - to I don't think I think this is gonna
10:24 - be complicated enough that I'm not gonna
10:25 - want to use the P 5 web editor for this
10:28 - is pen up and pen down
10:31 - simple logo drawing commands does anyone
10:33 - fact right this is what I want to be
10:35 - able to do I want to be able to oh and
10:38 - then it also the repeat command alright
10:41 - why not I can parse for this Oh
10:44 - and then another okay I might not be
10:47 - able to do all of these okay this is
10:49 - great this is great this is I'm totally
10:51 - doing this oh I really really hurt
10:55 - myself here this is this is fine this is
10:57 - gonna be good
10:58 - alright let's go to I term
11:02 - I guess I could I would do this in
11:04 - processing except it's not going to be
11:06 - easy to have I mean I could load a text
11:11 - file with the commands in it that could
11:13 - be one way of approaching it but I'm not
11:18 - and so I could have like just a text
11:20 - editor open maybe I should do that let's
11:26 - do that okay of course we will make a
11:33 - okay and then now let me just test out
11:38 - this idea oh but regular expressions for
11:42 - split and everything is gonna be so
11:44 - awkward be so much nicer to use
11:46 - JavaScript regular expressions probably
11:49 - I think I have to do this in JavaScript
11:52 - I think this is complex enough though
11:58 - that I am going to want to whoops
12:02 - use pin up and pen down will certainly
12:12 - be useful yes hello oh okay native
12:33 - JavaScript please and how did chance
12:35 - I appreciate it i I don't think I'd be
12:39 - able to do this with native JavaScript
12:44 - something is very unstable here gonna be
12:48 - standing still while coding today maybe
12:52 - this wasn't a good idea well didn't I
12:59 - just install that Oh
13:05 - huh huh what did I do to my path well
13:14 - I'm not gonna worry about that place I'm
13:16 - not gonna worry about that I'll just get
13:17 - a get one of my previous things that
13:22 - I've been doing like we're Tyvek or
13:25 - something oh yeah let me just grab one
13:27 - of my word Tyvek examples go to the
13:30 - desktop logo I don't need this get rid
13:45 - of everything
13:56 - get rid of everything okay
14:10 - something has gone wrong with my zsh
14:12 - what has gone on with my zsh setup is
14:18 - this the problem let's just restart
14:24 - terminal
14:31 - I don't want to get lost in this but
14:40 - hmm this looks good I don't see anything
14:45 - in here that's missing where am i know'd
14:48 - did I lose my like note packages note is
14:53 - there or of course oh you know what all
15:03 - right hold on sorry I'm gonna have to do
15:12 - this cuz this is making me crazy I think
15:17 - maybe I forgot a little thing here which
15:23 - is this do I have any who am I using NPM
15:25 - global I do this yes this is where
15:34 - that's where my packages are and I did
15:40 - that and I think that I don't have this
15:42 - in my path so I don't know why I don't
15:45 - have that in my path that should do it
15:53 - I apologize if you don't know what I'm
15:56 - doing I don't have the energy to explain
15:58 - it right now but it is kind of in my
16:01 - there we go it is in my workflow videos
16:04 - okay let me just explain what just
16:06 - happened there I know global node
16:10 - modules are a thing that I can have
16:12 - included in my path meaning any global
16:14 - node module I have installed like HTTP
16:16 - server I can just run with the HTTP
16:18 - server command however I did not have
16:22 - that that my terminal my console didn't
16:25 - know about that directory and p.m.
16:27 - global or I'm installing the stuff so I
16:28 - had to add this and I'm using Zee shell
16:31 - so what it's called but whatever shell
16:33 - you are you need to have the path know
16:35 - about that directory okay that aside now
16:40 - I should be able to go to a my run it I
16:44 - should be able to go to here and oh did
16:48 - I quit it and see oh I'm like
16:53 - let me go back to a desktop logo HTTP
17:01 - server and we've got a little console
17:08 - going here and then let's think about
17:11 - this I'm just gonna add before I start a
17:20 - text area is that what is called ID
17:25 - equals code I mean a text area let's see
17:31 - I don't want to have to figure this out
17:33 - and then what's the thing do I say like
17:34 - cols equals 80 or something you know and
17:45 - then rows something like that oh that's
17:49 - way too much and then can I put stuff in
17:53 - there like the ideas I can put stuff in
17:56 - there like oh shoot how do I where'd
18:02 - those logo commands go oh this is like
18:13 - this
18:29 - I just want to see is this
18:48 - and then here there we go yep
18:59 - there we go okay let's make it the
19:09 - canvas 200 200 and a text that big so I
19:21 - just didn't want to have to do this in
19:23 - the coding challenge because this is
19:24 - like a lot of configuration e stuff
19:38 - okay great there we go
19:42 - okay I think I'm set okay okay
19:48 - everyone's gonna be okay
19:50 - Oh put things in quotes okay
19:53 - yeah I'm supposed to put these in quotes
20:02 - this is gonna be a me not moving around
20:05 - so much coding challenged oh boy let me
20:11 - just give me a second here case I need
20:14 - to use the whiteboard cycle the camera
20:29 - okay and let me close things that don't
20:36 - need to be open
20:48 - this can be minimized and code is
20:53 - visible this is visible and we are ready
20:57 - to go how's everybody doing okay all
21:15 - those temperatures get ride that chair
21:17 - and sit and I actually have a chair in
21:18 - this room I'm just curious what happens
21:20 - if I use the chair just give me a second
21:23 - here
21:25 - sher might provide me a little support
21:29 - it's a little bit weird for me to use a
21:31 - chair it's a little kind of tool Oh
21:36 - weird how do you guys feel about me
21:44 - using this chair I'm gonna use this
21:45 - chair today I've never done this but I
21:49 - actually feel much more stable using the
21:55 - chair I especially like and I'll get up
21:59 - if I have to but this is gonna be much
22:01 - better for my back today standing was a
22:03 - little bit of an issue okay I'm like
22:08 - doing everything sitting for the whole
22:10 - rest of this when the camera goes up at
22:12 - half an hour I'm gonna have to get up
22:14 - okay
22:15 - put books on the seat I wish the seat
22:19 - would go yeah people will the seat go
22:23 - higher oh they little knobby thing that
22:30 - raises it up it's broken but it might be
22:32 - as high as it goes okay cherish dick how
22:44 - much lower today because I'm sitting in
22:45 - a chair this coding challenge requires a
22:47 - chair just me that needs the chair today
22:50 - okay
22:51 - I feel so organized it's like any papers
22:54 - like I'm a newscaster or something
22:56 - welcome to the coding training coding
22:58 - challenge today I'm going to make logo
23:00 - what do you mean you're gonna make logos
23:02 - so logo is an educational programming
23:05 - language designed in 1967 by all these
23:07 - people listed here and you can go read
23:09 - the Wikipedia page to learn more about
23:10 - the history I actually did learn in my
23:14 - youth maybe some of you did so what I
23:16 - mean by making logo is I want to create
23:19 - and pause
23:27 - look I want to create a interpreter I
23:37 - wouldn't I want to create a programming
23:39 - environment in the browser that
23:40 - basically does logo so I as the it's
23:44 - like spell checking me here how weird I
23:47 - can write logo commands and then watch
23:50 - my logo commands be executed in this
23:53 - canvas and probably what I should do is
23:56 - have a button that's like a run button
23:57 - but maybe I could be continuously
23:59 - interpreting it who knows so what are
24:01 - the logo commands so the idea of logo is
24:04 - turtle graphics the idea is that you're
24:06 - controlling a turtle to move around the
24:08 - screen the turtle move and the turtle
24:10 - could do a number of things and I found
24:12 - this tutorial from Brown University to a
24:15 - course you can find a link up here and
24:18 - these are the these are the drawing
24:21 - commands I can move forward by a certain
24:23 - amount I can go backwards by a certain
24:25 - amount I can turn right
24:26 - I could turn left by some angle and I
24:28 - can clear screen there are also other
24:31 - commands and there's like a repeat
24:34 - command and there's pen up pen down it's
24:36 - very straight a high turtle show turtle
24:40 - home label set XY so many possibilities
24:43 - I'm not going to implement everything
24:44 - because but I'm gonna do something or
24:48 - release this code and you the viewer
24:51 - will probably make your own magical logo
24:52 - interpreter maybe you don't even want to
24:54 - make a logo interpreter but just this
24:56 - idea of drawing in this way will inspire
24:59 - you to do something so and what would be
25:01 - interesting is it could I make a logo
25:03 - interpreter that then I paste something
25:06 - in here that would actually generate
25:08 - this particular pattern this example
25:10 - logo output so that's kind of like a bit
25:12 - of a challenge certainly I would need a
25:14 - repeat to be able to do that and this
25:16 - video will be approximately seven and a
25:19 - half hours long are you ready let's go
25:23 - alright so the first thing that I want
25:25 - to do Oh what do I want to do I guess I
25:27 - need to parse this so okay what did I
25:30 - what do I have already so I have already
25:33 - an HTML page that has a text area in it
25:36 - and that text area has this sort of like
25:37 - logo code written in there
25:41 - so what I can do and I'm using the p5.js
25:43 - library and now what I can do is I can
25:46 - say I'm gonna make a something called
25:51 - editor I'm gonna say editor equals
25:53 - select code and then I'm going to say
25:57 - console dot log editor dot value I'm
26:01 - gonna call the value function was that
26:02 - what it's gonna be
26:03 - let's see whoops refresh there we go
26:07 - okay so that's how I get the code so I
26:09 - could say a let code equals editor dot
26:14 - value then what do I need to do I need
26:18 - to parse this and looks to me like I can
26:21 - quite easily parse this with a space
26:23 - this fitting is weird
26:25 - I've also read in front of phone I don't
26:27 - like it this went away okay everyone's
26:38 - saying everyone's telling me to just
26:40 - embrace the chairman embrace the chair
26:45 - okay
26:46 - so where was I
26:50 - thank you much always for your editing
26:52 - support okay so the delimiter here the
26:57 - thing that defines each block here is a
27:00 - space so I can really nicely I can do
27:03 - say something like let tokens tokens as
27:05 - I sort of word that's often used in
27:08 - computational things to describe a
27:10 - single unit a token of text a word token
27:14 - a sentence token a character token
27:15 - because what I want to do is say split
27:17 - and it's the most simplest level
27:19 - I just want to split that text up by by
27:24 - spaces and I can do all sorts of fancy
27:26 - stuff in here like use a regular
27:27 - expression and split it in fancier ways
27:29 - and I'm going to need error handling I'm
27:31 - not going to worry about any of that I
27:32 - am just going to go ahead and say look
27:35 - at this
27:35 - alright look at this oh look this is
27:38 - weird extra carriage return thing but
27:41 - I'm not gonna worry about that we can
27:42 - see now I have something that splits up
27:44 - everything by that splits up everything
27:50 - by
27:51 - [Music]
27:53 - like water is over there one second
27:58 - everyone
28:17 - it splits up everything into an element
28:20 - of an array and actually I'm getting a
28:22 - nice suggestion from the chat that if I
28:24 - call console table it might I might be
28:27 - able to see it in a nice other way like
28:28 - oh that's really nice good that console
28:30 - dot table like my favorite thing ever
28:32 - okay so there we go so we can see
28:35 - there's the array all right so what do I
28:37 - want to do I have like a crazy idea
28:40 - let's build a dictionary what I mean by
28:44 - a dictionary let's make a JavaScript
28:45 - object we're each one of these each one
28:49 - of these commands is a function is is it
28:53 - is math each one of these keys the
28:54 - command is mapped to a function why what
28:56 - what am I talking about let me show you
28:58 - with code so let's let's actually make a
29:03 - another javascript file called turtle j
29:06 - s and normally i would make like a
29:08 - turtle graphics a turtle object which
29:10 - would really make sense i'm actually
29:12 - let's do that let's make a turtle claw
29:14 - object because the turtle is going to
29:16 - need the turtle is the thing that's
29:19 - moving and drawing so the turtle is
29:21 - going to have an x value maybe it'll be
29:25 - initialized somewhere the turtle will
29:28 - have a Y value and that's good right now
29:30 - and the turtle might have functions like
29:32 - you know forward backward backward
29:40 - because this idea that I had was to then
29:43 - also have an object like commands equal
29:49 - and then like forward would be a key
29:53 - mapped to a particular function and in
29:57 - that function we would you know
30:01 - translate by some amount by you know
30:07 - some length or something maybe I'm
30:10 - always gonna move forward along the
30:11 - x-axis all have to be wrote right I
30:13 - could I could do that
30:15 - so I was thinking about doing this but
30:17 - it kind of makes sense to have an object
30:19 - hmm hmm oh right it definitely needs a
30:23 - direction this is very important like I
30:25 - might call it angle like it needs a
30:27 - direction
30:28 - I don't know if it makes it's called
30:29 - direction or angle maybe the direction
30:32 - but it's eat it's initialized as an
30:34 - angle but I kind of so I'm gonna do this
30:37 - right now and this by the way would be
30:40 - what was the actual command its FD for
30:43 - forward so I'm gonna put this away for a
30:46 - little bit and what I'm going to do is
30:50 - I'm going to say let turtle and I'm
30:55 - gonna make a turtle turtles a new turtle
31:01 - and it's going to start in the middle of
31:04 - the window with an angle of zero so this
31:11 - is going to be the initial turtle and
31:13 - then let's think so let's forget about
31:15 - the fact that I have to follow the logo
31:17 - commands and let's just for a second
31:20 - actually program the things I would do
31:22 - so if I'm gonna go forward by some
31:24 - amount I'm going to say translate by
31:29 - that amount
31:30 - I'm gonna everything's gonna be like
31:32 - along the x-axis if I'm gonna go
31:36 - backward watch this I could say forward
31:40 - by negative amount this dot forward whoa
31:43 - visual studio coach has corrected that
31:45 - for me
31:45 - let me try that again forward scary look
31:51 - it's like how Gmail writes their email
31:53 - for you now this dot forward negative
31:56 - amount right so backward is moving
31:58 - forward by a negative amount what were
32:00 - some of the other commands where were
32:03 - they right so right would be I'm gonna
32:09 - say right
32:09 - oh by the way so I actually when I read
32:13 - the command I don't need to have forward
32:14 - and backward cuz I'm just gonna use my
32:17 - forward command so anyway we'll see but
32:19 - like right would be by some angle I
32:25 - would say rotate no don't autocorrect
32:29 - for me by that some angle so that's what
32:33 - I'm gonna do I couldn't so I'm probably
32:35 - going to use the fact that p5 has this
32:38 - whole transformation matrix
32:41 - and I have some video tutorials about
32:42 - that pushpop translate rotate so I can
32:45 - actually control the turtle that way I
32:46 - could do all that math with trigonometry
32:48 - but I'm gonna stick with that and every
32:52 - song me that like that this dot thing
32:54 - this table this blog um has been around
32:57 - for quite a while in in Visual Studio
33:01 - code okay
33:02 - never forget that this dot now I won't
33:04 - be able to forget but I want to forget
33:06 - it like what if I did this uh we can I
33:09 - never uh am I never gonna forget again
33:12 - like what if I did something weird like
33:13 - this it doesn't change it it did it with
33:15 - functions it didn't know to change my
33:16 - instance variable okay alright so let's
33:19 - stick with this for a second and I am
33:23 - going to also I need to know whether if
33:28 - so uh the turtles gonna need a Penn
33:30 - State so let's make a variable called
33:33 - Penn that's true when the pen is drawing
33:36 - and false when the pen is not drawing so
33:38 - I would say if and then ooh oh I don't
33:41 - need the XY so do I need I need the
33:44 - starting point so the starting point
33:46 - would actually just be translate to that
33:49 - XY and interestingly enough I don't
33:55 - necessarily need to keep track of these
33:56 - things let's think about that I might
33:58 - and then rotate by that angle so when I
34:01 - create it I'm actually just like
34:03 - translating and rotating then forward if
34:06 - this dot pen I want to say line by some
34:11 - amount Oh from zero zero to the amount
34:16 - comma zero like I want to draw a line
34:17 - I'm considering the x-axis to be the
34:19 - kind of universal access I'm gonna
34:21 - rotate from there
34:22 - that makes sense for it to be the y-axis
34:23 - to be honest cuz we might think of it
34:25 - starting going up but whatever I can
34:26 - always change that I'm gonna draw that
34:28 - line and actually so I want to draw the
34:31 - line first and then translate to the end
34:34 - of the line that's what I want to do and
34:35 - rotate is just rotate okay so if I have
34:39 - forward and right I don't think that I
34:41 - need backward what I'm going to do now
34:45 - in here is I'm gonna say for every token
34:51 - on tokens
34:55 - let oh no I have that already yeah let's
34:59 - do this in like a ridiculous way for a
35:01 - second if token equals forward then
35:05 - amount equals oh no I should use an
35:08 - inner I should use a an index here but I
35:12 - because I'm gonna want to look at the
35:14 - next one I is less than tokens dot
35:16 - length I plus plus you know what I'm
35:19 - gonna be even crazier and I'm gonna say
35:22 - index equals zero
35:24 - while index is less than tokens dot
35:26 - length I'm gonna manually kind of
35:29 - iterate over this thing and I'm gonna
35:32 - say let token equal tokens index then
35:40 - I'm gonna say if token equals forward
35:45 - and I want to think of like a different
35:46 - way of organizing this code for sure
35:48 - switch statement I know you're all
35:50 - thinking if token equals forward then
35:53 - amount should be tokens index plus one
35:58 - and then I could say turtle forward
36:02 - amount right so what's in the actual
36:09 - instructions forward right forward right
36:12 - oh this is good only forward and right
36:14 - that's perfect
36:16 - else if token equals right then let
36:24 - angle equal also the next one and then
36:30 - turtle right so I say is it right I mean
36:36 - maybe I should make this turn whatever
36:37 - right by the angle oh and I should say
36:41 - angle mode degrees because the the angle
36:45 - is being given in degrees not in radians
36:47 - if that's not a familiar concept to you
36:49 - I refer you to some other video that
36:51 - they have about radians and angles okay
36:55 - so now okay so now yes so people in the
37:00 - chat are telling me I can say index plus
37:03 - plus so why can I say that let me show
37:06 - you why so let's say I have
37:09 - a variable like I equals zero well we
37:12 - know that I plus plus is the same as
37:15 - saying I equals I plus one so I plus
37:18 - plus but it also returns that value so
37:20 - it resets the value and returns it it
37:22 - actually allows me to move forward so I
37:24 - was going to lazily just say at the end
37:26 - I plus equal to but it would make sense
37:31 - for me to actually say index and index
37:34 - not I index plus plus in here which is
37:36 - like go to the next one and use the
37:40 - value of the next one all at the same
37:42 - time and then afterwards I could go one
37:45 - more because I need to go to the next
37:46 - one okay because not everything will be
37:49 - in a pair we'll see all right so let's
37:51 - look at that and I'm gonna hit refresh
37:53 - mmm and I have an error somewhere Oh -
37:57 - too many curly brackets I'm gonna put
38:04 - this here and here we go whoops nope
38:06 - refresh ah tokens is not defined code
38:11 - split why is tokens not defined
38:14 - where's tokens out to find Sketch up
38:16 - Jess line six Oh
38:18 - because I had I was console logging in I
38:21 - don't need to console log anymore but
38:23 - let's leave that in there turtle is not
38:28 - to fight okay so of course I need to
38:30 - also here reference and add my other
38:35 - JavaScript script which has turtle J yes
38:38 - okay ready so one thing I have to think
38:44 - about here is hmm let's set up a stroke
38:49 - of I got a really deal someone's gonna
38:53 - help me figure out how to turn off this
38:54 - autocomplete that I don't want in Visual
38:56 - Studio code I think someone already did
38:59 - tell me this and I forgot to look at it
39:00 - I think it was Nathan
39:01 - Thank You Nathan oh and there's plus
39:04 - plus index and index plus plus which is
39:06 - something from the chest Becky maybe
39:07 - I'll come back and talk about that a
39:09 - second all right a stroke 255 let's just
39:13 - add stroke wait one just we actually
39:16 - don't need to add that that's fine
39:17 - actually let's make it a little thicker
39:18 - just so it's easier to see stroke wait
39:21 - - oh yeah let's see hmm
39:28 - so why am I not seeing anything so let's
39:29 - console.log some stuff a little
39:31 - debugging here console dot log token and
39:38 - console dot log forward let's see if
39:41 - that happens okay forward for ya
39:44 - ford forward right forward forward so it
39:46 - is getting forward let's look at oh you
39:50 - know what this is a string turtle dot
39:54 - forward amount is gonna have puff
39:56 - trouble understanding that I wonder if I
39:58 - should have this I'm sorry I should
40:01 - probably convert I could do something
40:05 - like this converts it to a number or
40:07 - like parse int might be good let's do
40:10 - parse in that might be a little more
40:12 - Universal so let's add that I was
40:17 - thinking that might be the problem let's
40:18 - console.log amount ooh not a number not
40:30 - a number huh I hold on everybody
40:34 - something is terribly wrong
40:36 - oh so it's actually no thank you
40:40 - breaking news from the chat I actually
40:46 - have to use the plus plus index this is
40:48 - why I didn't want to use that so the
40:50 - chat is going crazy over this mistake
40:52 - listen to the chat please I'm just
40:54 - sitting in a chair it's hard for me to
40:56 - see the chat okay I don't use these
41:00 - things I like to be long-winded in how I
41:02 - code so let's go back to here ha so sad
41:05 - let's let's look here at right so let's
41:09 - let's go and investigate in I equals 0 I
41:12 - plus plus I'm going to see it actually
41:15 - is returning 0 I plus plus you know I
41:21 - could say console.log I plus plus that
41:25 - is giving me the next value but I huh is
41:32 - actually 2 now
41:33 - that doesn't make any sense I'm so
41:36 - confused but plus plus I owe because it
41:39 - already was one right hold on let's
41:41 - start over again I equals zero
41:44 - console.log I plus plus that gives me
41:49 - zero right because even though I is now
41:53 - 1 I plus plus returns the original value
41:56 - of I there we go so that's actually not
41:58 - giving me the correct thing but plus
42:02 - plus I actually returns now getting 2
42:05 - because it already went on to the next
42:07 - one so this increases the value of I and
42:09 - gives you back that new value so that I
42:11 - see this in shorthand all the time it's
42:13 - kind of like a ternary thing that I'm
42:14 - finally getting myself to use so this
42:17 - actually needs to be this plus plus
42:19 - index maybe that I plus plus so gave gap
42:23 - Gabriel in the chat saying I plus plus
42:25 - increments and returns the previous
42:27 - number plus plus I increments and
42:29 - returns the next number that's a nice
42:30 - succinct way of saying it all right so
42:33 - here we go so forward 60 60 so now
42:37 - things are looking up the turtle is
42:40 - printing out the right amount
42:44 - so let's console.log the amount here and
42:50 - let's give this a try all right so I
42:55 - don't need to console.log the token
42:57 - there's too many console logs here 63
43:00 - times how come I didn't see I don't see
43:04 - a line look look at the chat I don't
43:10 - want to look at the chat that's the
43:10 - thing I like to figure these things out
43:11 - myself how come I don't see a line so
43:14 - turtle forward amount when I created the
43:17 - turtle I made it in the middle oh you
43:19 - know it's a little bit weird here is so
43:24 - this is this is not so good I'm a little
43:28 - suspicious that translate and stuff is
43:30 - not going to work the way I want in
43:31 - setup I need to move on to the draw loop
43:34 - like for example if I say translate 100
43:37 - 100 and then ellipse 400 0 0 200 200
43:43 - let's just run this for a second
43:47 - also what why am I not drawing anything
43:53 - Oh
43:55 - draw background zero this whole thing
44:01 - I'm calling background I can see the
44:02 - chat actually saying that now I've been
44:05 - calling background this whole time what
44:07 - a terrible problem okay let's go back
44:09 - and see if my logic now is sound my
44:13 - brain operates more slowly when sitting
44:16 - apparently okay let's try this all right
44:20 - weird I don't know what just happened
44:22 - there Oh background zero let's draw the
44:24 - background zero here there we go look at
44:28 - that turtle graphics um now I kind of
44:33 - feel like forward 60 should probably
44:35 - start pointing up does anybody know how
44:37 - logo actually works turning right it
44:39 - definitely turned the right direction
44:40 - like left would be the other way
44:42 - I don't know that this matters so much
44:43 - I'll leave it like this okay so alright
44:47 - we're kind of good I've got to deal with
44:49 - other commands anyone have an idea I
44:52 - would love to take an idea about how to
44:56 - I mean I could use a switch statement
44:58 - but I kind of like the idea of a lookup
45:01 - table what if what I did is I hat took
45:05 - this idea I wanna try this idea of my
45:07 - commands I have an idea
45:10 - oh this will work if I have it totally
45:14 - have a crazy idea so forward is a
45:17 - function that calls that calls oh boy
45:32 - no it goes here anonymous function is a
45:38 - function that calls a turtle got forward
45:43 - I have to figure out how to do the
45:47 - argument then backward is the same thing
45:53 - but maybe it calls it with so can I give
45:56 - it how do I give this an argument cuz I
45:58 - want to self execute
46:00 - I have to think about this somebody
46:01 - somebody think about this I can bind it
46:03 - with something what is this is this a
46:05 - sound strategy right is then a function
46:11 - that calls turtle dot right in other
46:16 - words what I want to do is say oh but I
46:20 - still I want to say I want to say
46:27 - basically commands token execute oh yeah
46:35 - I can give it an argument huh of course
46:37 - tokens plus plus index look at this so
46:40 - this should do exactly what I was doing
46:42 - right the token is forward execute the
46:45 - function with that command with the
46:46 - argument yeah so I don't need an if
46:50 - statement here all I need is this right
46:55 - because now it's going to and so the
46:58 - argument goes here the argument for
47:03 - backward goes here and I just do
47:05 - negative amount then right is the angle
47:09 - turn right the angle and then this is I
47:13 - don't know if this is a sound solution
47:15 - but I'm intrigued by it left is turn
47:18 - right but by negative the angle okay so
47:24 - this your work this is a little bit nuts
47:26 - looking but let me unpack this for you
47:28 - if I had a function right if I had a
47:30 - function that's you know forward with an
47:33 - amount this is actually what this is
47:36 - doing because I have this resolves
47:39 - itself to this number that's the
47:42 - argument after the command and this
47:45 - resolves itself to a function that's
47:47 - defined up here that I'm calling so I
47:50 - think this is gonna work let's try this
47:53 - and for some reason I feel like having
47:55 - this in a separate I feel like having
48:00 - this in here let me zoom back out like
48:03 - this just makes more sense to me to have
48:05 - this with the turtle class because they
48:06 - kind of go together okay no commands
48:11 - token is not a function why not
48:14 - okay commands is a function commands
48:21 - token mm-hmm or use es6 proxy someone's
48:28 - telling me about mmm I don't know about
48:31 - es6 process so console.log token
48:36 - console.log commands let me just see
48:41 - what's going on here
48:42 - so oh no I just got to the end so it got
48:47 - to the end because there was an invalid
48:49 - token there so so first thing I need to
48:52 - do is make sure if commands token even
48:57 - exists so I want to make sure it exists
49:00 - and if not I want to skip it so this is
49:02 - a little bit of you know kind of
49:03 - pathetic error handling but should work
49:06 - and now I can say whew look at that
49:09 - we've got turtle graphics right I could
49:12 - add another you know left left 64 word
49:17 - 50 oh I don't have any way oh I'm not so
49:21 - I need to real-time interprets real-time
49:24 - interpret this what do I mean by that so
49:27 - what I mean by that is I have already
49:29 - did I didn't really explain these pieces
49:31 - I just realized at the beginning so I
49:34 - made a text area I think I did with an
49:37 - ID and then I used the p5 Dom library
49:39 - okay I did explain this alright so but
49:41 - what I can do is I can attach an event
49:42 - and the event that I want to attach is
49:44 - editor input and then and then basically
49:52 - I want to say like go turtle so anytime
49:55 - I make any change and actually maybe I
49:58 - want it let's start with changed let's
50:01 - just start with change so change is an
50:02 - event that that like only executes when
50:06 - you've finished a task like you hit
50:07 - enter or you tab out of thing so and now
50:11 - I could take all of this and this is my
50:15 - function go turtle and again I'm kind of
50:17 - not really using a more modern es6
50:20 - javascript here but i think that's fine
50:22 - oh the camera
50:25 - back Dan back problem Dan is coming over
50:28 - to the camera by the way the microphone
50:30 - hopefully is like the batteries are low
50:32 - so thank you Matt so once again how my
50:36 - time wise 523 is pretty good yeah I
50:43 - don't know what an es 6 proxy is okay
50:51 - okay all right my back so let me what
50:58 - was I doing
50:58 - yeah okay so now I have goat turtle it
51:02 - should execute whenever I change
51:03 - anything in the editor so let's delete
51:07 - all this and tab out of it ah code dot
51:11 - split is not a function why not oh I've
51:13 - got to get the new stuff from the editor
51:17 - and you know I could select it I know
51:20 - it's a little silly have this global
51:21 - variable but whatever it's fine okay
51:23 - refresh if I do this tab out I got this
51:27 - now I can say you know write 100 but I
51:31 - wanted to live interpret why not right
51:33 - it should be I should be able to write
51:35 - enough error handling that it can like
51:37 - interpret the code live so I'm gonna
51:38 - change this to input and you'll see like
51:41 - when I oh if I had space right oh but I
51:46 - also need to redraw the background ooh
51:51 - this is fun okay so now I can start
51:53 - deleting stuff weird oh and guess what
51:57 - another thing I need to do I need to say
52:00 - push and push and pop because I don't
52:05 - want it to pick up from where it last
52:07 - left off I always wanted to start from
52:10 - the beginning okay I can see all the
52:14 - comments of people helping me fix by
52:15 - Visual Studio studio code okay
52:17 - now this should so first of all I want
52:20 - it to run once at the beginning so I
52:22 - also need to call go turtle at least
52:25 - once all right and now if I start
52:30 - deleting look at that it's actually real
52:35 - time interpreting so I could say forward
52:39 - 510 left one left 90 forward 100 look at
52:46 - that oh I love this
52:47 - it's like real-time interpreting what
52:50 - kind of dare I say somewhat done with
52:53 - this coding challenge but we can't stop
52:56 - here right I mean everybody tells me
52:59 - don't make a video on YouTube that's
53:00 - longer than 20 minutes that's what it's
53:02 - gonna be as long as it is because I want
53:05 - to be able to do this and I think
53:07 - there's a lot more to implement like I
53:09 - should implement pen up and pen down
53:12 - that would be a pretty easy one to do
53:13 - let's do that let's implement that just
53:16 - to show you but I'm gonna ask you I'm
53:18 - gonna ask you maybe we'll make this a
53:20 - community project um I will release the
53:22 - code as is the finished version of this
53:25 - coding challenge on github the coding
53:27 - train website but I will also make a new
53:29 - repository look at the videos link for
53:32 - for a version that people could
53:33 - contribute to so if I do what is pen up
53:36 - and pen down PU I'm so immature
53:40 - PU function would be turtle dot pen
53:45 - equals true right and then PD would be a
53:51 - function that is turtle dot pen equals
53:55 - false so I should be able to use those
53:57 - now right so for example if I just
54:00 - refresh my code here if I say right here
54:04 - pan up it should okay so something
54:09 - didn't work let's think about this
54:11 - turtle pan equals true oh it still moves
54:15 - but it doesn't draw the line that's
54:17 - right so let's look at this again it
54:21 - shouldn't move on you just move on by
54:23 - one index I guess we're gonna have to
54:25 - console.log here let's be let's debug
54:28 - this forward 60
54:31 - let's do forward 40 right 90 pen up
54:36 - forward 100 right 90 forward 50 huh so
54:45 - what happened
54:49 - when it's up you won't write which is I
54:52 - don't want it to but I want it to still
54:54 - move forward like it still should
54:57 - translate let's let's console.log what
55:00 - am i console logging this amount and
55:03 - we're - how'd it get in there with not a
55:05 - number that's weird I don't want it to
55:09 - ever do that so let's look at let's make
55:13 - sure
55:14 - let's count back and console hog this is
55:18 - a it's gonna be a little debugging here
55:19 - going on the chat will probably tell me
55:22 - what's wrong but I'm gonna say console
55:24 - and and let me just actually here now
55:27 - let me just change this to something
55:29 - that I want to test right 90 Ford 50
55:33 - right ninety pen up Ford 50 right ninety
55:39 - oh I need to pen down that's why maybe
55:42 - it's working I never did pen down let's
55:47 - see pen down forward fifty maybe it
55:51 - actually worked
55:52 - okay forward fifty right ninety forward
55:56 - 50 right ninety pen up forward fifty
55:58 - right 90 pen no I should see a line here
56:00 - I should see a last line there it
56:03 - expects a number it shouldn't oh oh
56:08 - because it's actually oh interesting
56:11 - it's doing this for every command so it
56:15 - only should do this if command token so
56:20 - how do I of course so it needs to know
56:22 - not to do this so I could yeah don't
56:31 - increment the token index again
56:33 - yeah but I'm trying to do this within a
56:36 - like elegant way without an if statement
56:38 - like right like somehow I want to like
56:41 - return something to tell it not to go up
56:45 - but I already going up to get the angle
56:47 - so I mean I could like certainly I could
56:51 - say if commands right I mean I could do
56:54 - something like if token so what's a like
56:58 - starts with P like index of P
57:02 - equals zero right that's a quick way to
57:05 - see a car at this is more this makes
57:09 - work car at zero equals as long as token
57:15 - all right if token car at zero equals P
57:19 - someone's going to suggest a better way
57:20 - to do this but let's just get this
57:24 - working right now then commands token
57:29 - hmm just execute it without any
57:33 - arguments else execute it with this and
57:40 - go up by one so this should do the trick
57:42 - right based on what the token is yeah
57:46 - what are like return the amount but I
57:47 - feel like I got to think about this more
57:49 - let's just get let's just make this work
57:51 - let's make this work
57:54 - sketch 32 okay so I have I'm out of I'm
57:58 - incorrect in my like land of brackets if
58:02 - there is an actual command if oh no that
58:05 - if it equals P by the way this should be
58:07 - if it equals P if token car at 0 equals
58:12 - P then just execute the command with no
58:16 - argument otherwise execute commands for
58:17 - the next argument what's wrong here I
58:19 - guess I'm just missing another curly
58:21 - bracket somehow very good for working
58:26 - around forward 50 right 94 what happened
58:31 - here clop what's called that matching oh
58:33 - whoa that pop has to be out here okay
58:36 - there we go
58:37 - right forward 50 right 90 forward 50
58:41 - right 90 pen up didn't go forward 50 pen
58:46 - up which should make the pen be false
58:51 - and then it should go then forward still
58:59 - remove the nut yeah I already got that
59:01 - part
59:01 - the chat's behind me and oh yes a better
59:09 - way would be to have Nathan in the chat
59:11 - so the better way would be to have
59:13 - additional methods in the commands
59:14 - to tell it how many arguments take but
59:15 - hold on I'm gonna like debug why is this
59:17 - not working because let's go look at my
59:21 - turtle object forward if this up and it
59:27 - should stuff it should still move
59:29 - forward even without drawing the amount
59:31 - so why didn't it do that so I guess I'm
59:40 - gonna have to do some console logging I
59:42 - mixed up pen down and pen up
59:43 - that's why thank you very much is that
59:46 - really why pen up oh yeah and down there
59:52 - we go oh look at the chat going crazy I
60:02 - inverted pan up and pen down all right
60:04 - but this is exciting because I can
60:06 - change this to pen down ooh wait
60:09 - it froze do I have some sort of bad
60:12 - infinite loop here hold on I have a
60:15 - problem oh this has to this I always
60:19 - need to go up by the next index bad
60:21 - infinite loop problem hold on edit this
60:28 - little second out okay this was a big
60:30 - problem my index plus plus I need to
60:33 - always go to the next one so I'm gonna
60:34 - have to this this this page is frozen
60:37 - I'm gonna have to kill it somehow and
60:40 - there we go okay so now I should be able
60:42 - to change things around again oh no it's
60:45 - still oh because it didn't
60:47 - it was cached because I didn't have the
60:51 - console of it can I get it back no try
60:56 - again you know I'm just gonna do is kill
60:57 - the server let's kill the server I've
61:00 - got a little local server running with
61:03 - HTTP server let's see if that manages to
61:06 - get get me back here and let me open up
61:10 - the console and this should be good now
61:13 - okay yeah all right I'm back
61:16 - pen down right we can we can make up
61:19 - whatever we want forward 100 forward 10
61:23 - right 10 forward 10 left
61:28 - left 90 pen up forward ooh what just
61:36 - happened
61:39 - something happened something broke
61:42 - background ooh what's this background
61:46 - should be here hmm let's try this again
61:49 - why did things break just there what
61:53 - bugs do I have stroke zero on pen up oh
61:55 - that's an interesting idea
61:57 - that's I love that idea that's a really
61:59 - good idea maybe I won't do that right
62:00 - now because people might want to play
62:02 - with color in a different way but why
62:05 - did it break
62:08 - forward okay forward 10 right 90 forward
62:15 - 20 right 90 pen up why does that kill it
62:23 - and then it doesn't come back there's no
62:26 - error there's a really weird bug I've
62:30 - done index plus plus in two locations no
62:33 - that's right this should move on an
62:34 - extra one with the argument why as soon
62:39 - as I do pen up whereas at the beginning
62:41 - the pen up is fine right if I take this
62:45 - out yeah that's so weird
62:54 - is it depend not getting you rerun the
62:59 - input I need haha
63:01 - CJ coding garden with CJ shout-out to
63:04 - watch go to garden with CJ Thank You CJ
63:06 - for this I sort of forgot that the
63:09 - turtles not this is right here
63:12 - everything this is the sort of
63:14 - reinitializing everything like
63:16 - background re initializes everything the
63:18 - pop here undoes what it does so in a way
63:21 - the transformations are initialized
63:23 - again and then I get the the code from
63:26 - the editor from scratch but I didn't
63:28 - reset the turtle so I should really have
63:30 - a function that says like turtle reset I
63:33 - mean there's a lot of different ways I
63:34 - could do this but let's actually do that
63:36 - so let's let's actually keep all these
63:40 - things
63:41 - put this in a function called reset and
63:47 - say this dot X this dot y this angle and
63:51 - watch this we're gonna watch the magic a
63:53 - Visual Studio code to type my this dot
63:56 - in for me okay so now that should fix
64:01 - that problem X is not defined because I
64:06 - forgot oh wait hmm where's that X is not
64:11 - defined in turtle digest line 30 huh
64:16 - there we go okay so why don't I see
64:19 - anything out this duck pen equals true
64:23 - oh no oh because aha no go turtle oh why
64:31 - isn't it that was such a good idea but
64:34 - oh maybe turtle reset needs to be here
64:36 - before I do push this dot dr now I are
64:41 - not this dot angle there we go thank you
64:45 - thank you to the chat it's this variable
64:49 - this dot Direction dir okay didn't seem
64:55 - to fix anything here okay well let's
65:04 - let's let's be let's actually do some
65:07 - debugging here console dot log this dot
65:10 - X this dot y this dot dir let's look at
65:13 - those things 100 hundred zero right
65:16 - that's good why did I see that twice
65:17 - just now oh because when I initialized
65:20 - the turtle that's fine though so I
65:22 - actually don't need to call this dot
65:24 - reset here whoops if I'm doing it well
65:27 - there we go good now it's not do it it's
65:34 - doing the right thing so now I should be
65:35 - able to just start deleting stuff this
65:38 - is gonna freak it out like so I'm not
65:40 - doing total error checking but now I can
65:42 - say forward 100 there we go for 10 right
65:46 - 90 forward 50 left 90 pen up forward
65:54 - and left 94 100 all right so what did I
66:02 - I broke it so is this invalid forward 10
66:07 - hi over there I'm still here with you
66:10 - right 90 forward 50 left 90 left 90
66:17 - would be go this way pen up forward 10
66:21 - left 90 oh I didn't do pen down bend
66:25 - down there we go it's working all right
66:31 - here's the thing so we've got we've got
66:34 - turtle graphics now we really need to do
66:37 - that the last thing I need to do at
66:39 - least is the repeat button the repeat
66:41 - command I kind of don't want to do the
66:43 - repeat command because it's gonna create
66:45 - a huge set of complications but I can't
66:49 - let this finish at 30 seconds five you
66:52 - say cut down I can't let this go without
66:54 - that because I really want to see they
66:57 - really want to see this at the end and I
66:59 - feel like somebody work out what the
67:01 - logo commands are for this I mean this
67:03 - is kind of like my phyllotaxis spiral
67:05 - kind of thing so let's see if we can get
67:08 - repeat working so again what are the
67:11 - commands I haven't done hi turtle show
67:13 - turtle oh that would be great because we
67:14 - gotta have a turtle also be really nice
67:17 - to animate it going that I haven't done
67:20 - but let's at least think about repeat
67:22 - okay and then you need to use the
67:24 - bracket okay so the idea is that I am
67:29 - going to have something like let me just
67:32 - grab this right this would be like a
67:34 - square or triangle this is what I had
67:36 - before
67:36 - okay all right this should be doable
67:40 - this should be doable I might need some
67:42 - kind of crazy recursion but I think if I
67:45 - just think about only being able to do
67:47 - one repeat right now it'll be a little
67:49 - easier so I definitely need now a new
67:52 - command repeat and I need to change the
67:57 - way I'm splitting up the text so
67:59 - actually yeah some kind of recursion
68:03 - here is gonna be necessary let's
68:04 - actually let's split up
68:06 - array of arrays here
68:07 - go okay I got it so what if I first
68:10 - split by let's look at this basically I
68:15 - want to split by this I want to have
68:21 - token token and then this a full token
68:25 - so I want to split by well if I just
68:32 - split by I feel like I'm thinking show a
68:39 - train of course it should be the train
68:42 - I'm thinking this could be a little this
68:44 - could be a little moment to like edit
68:46 - out well I think here I could just use a
68:52 - regular expression because I could
68:55 - basically match but it's got to be a way
68:58 - to split it up by the problem is like I
69:03 - want to split by this space but not by
69:06 - this space so it needs to be a I could
69:09 - probably like look ahead and look behind
69:11 - right any space that's not in between
69:15 - brackets right look ahead does anybody
69:20 - know look ahead look behind in regular
69:21 - expressions that's what I think I need
69:23 - to do here right no space that's inside
69:28 - of brackets all right so I thought about
69:36 - this for a bit and my idea is to use a
69:38 - regular expression because whoops whoops
69:40 - whoops whoops whoops tries again okay I
69:44 - thought about this for a bit my idea is
69:45 - to use a regular expression oh oh
69:47 - actually Adam is saying you should parse
69:51 - the input sequentially that's also
69:54 - another idea hold on timeout
69:57 - implement a stack push when oh yeah oh
70:03 - that's a token oh that's ah okay usually
70:09 - you don't start by splitting splitting
70:12 - with space won't work just space your
70:14 - key words right doesn't have look behind
70:20 - no no no this is actually a really good
70:22 - idea not to use rep I should use a stack
70:25 - and actually yes so I actually want yeah
70:37 - okay let me think about this boy this is
70:40 - really hard I knew I shouldn't have done
70:41 - the repeat because let's just let me
70:46 - I'll come back to this in a second hold
70:47 - on I got to check my messages here hold
70:53 - on a sec I might have to go this this
70:57 - video might have to end and I'll have to
70:58 - come back into a part two with repeat
71:16 - I didn't realize was 5:45 so I might
71:19 - have to wrap this up I think I'm gonna
71:21 - have to wrap this up and yeah so what I
71:24 - can do I think actually is basically I
71:28 - want I want this bracket to also be a
71:32 - token so basically like just for a
71:36 - second here
71:37 - let's look at how we would split this
71:39 - and I'm gonna have to come back back and
71:41 - do this I'm gonna wrap up this enough to
71:44 - finish this another time
71:47 - because right and I could write I could
71:52 - pull the things out one at a time and
71:54 - then parse it differently that would
71:56 - make more sense actually
72:00 - you need to stream tokens as they go a
72:03 - token stops at a space scanner should be
72:07 - feeding with one character till the
72:08 - whole sentence is read
72:11 - yes okay so I'm gonna stop here so okay
72:21 - because I have to go and this was fun
72:30 - also to be perfectly honest I have some
72:33 - like which I think should figure out the
72:39 - number of art yes and these are all such
72:40 - great suggestions and I'm gonna do it in
72:43 - a part two so and I'll do that next week
72:46 - so let me try to like back up here for
72:50 - me somewhere where I was here okay where
72:52 - I went to say I have to do repeat
72:55 - alright so thank you for free
73:01 - okay so this works now I could put in
73:04 - any kind of commands that I want and get
73:07 - the result of the turtle graphics
73:09 - drawing but I really really want to see
73:12 - this pattern and I could do some kind of
73:15 - crazy thing to generate the text that
73:17 - does this pattern that would be kind of
73:18 - a fun thing to do a little challenge for
73:20 - you watching to actually generate the
73:22 - text which would be very long to then
73:24 - render that but what would be better
73:26 - would be to actually implement this
73:28 - repeat command and so what the repeat
73:31 - command does it basically says repeat
73:33 - has an argument three and then it looks
73:35 - for the commands that are within these
73:37 - square brackets and does those commands
73:39 - three times so I'm gonna have to
73:41 - completely rethink the way that I split
73:44 - the text up just splitting it by like
73:46 - spaces is no good in fact you're
73:48 - probably gonna want to like parse the
73:50 - text as I go it could maybe do some kind
73:52 - of recursion or like a regular
73:54 - expression so this is my challenge to
73:57 - you implement the repeat command I will
74:00 - come back in a future coding challenge
74:02 - and do it based on the way you did it
74:04 - but I'm not gonna do that part of this
74:07 - challenge so right now this is wrapping
74:08 - up look in this video's description two
74:11 - links to the code exactly the way that I
74:14 - left it as well as perhaps a community
74:16 - project where I will accept pull
74:18 - requests to add keeping it simple add
74:20 - some features and and other commands
74:23 - that are part of turtle graphics also we
74:26 - need to Train okay let's just at least
74:28 - add the trained coding tree logo this is
74:35 - how I'm finding it there we go you know
74:39 - what whatever note somebody will find
74:41 - the puget Edit point again also also you
74:51 - know like a grammar some type of like
74:53 - thinking about like a grammar might be
74:56 - away it's like we're really in the weeds
74:57 - of how like compilers and things work in
74:59 - a way we're interpreting in real time
75:01 - somebody else's code and executing it
75:03 - wow this is fun it does need a train so
75:05 - instead of a turtle could have a train
75:07 - or you can make a train a turtle or a
75:08 - train I don't know anymore
75:10 - I'm gonna go thank you for watching this
75:12 - coding
75:12 - where I implemented part of the original
75:16 - logo programming language and stay tuned
75:18 - for part two where I finished this off
75:20 - at least with the repeat command so it
75:22 - can generate some more interesting
75:23 - patterns and I look forward to your your
75:26 - own versions of this please share them
75:28 - with me
75:28 - on Twitter on the coding train comm
75:30 - website and in the comments here ok
75:32 - thank you good bye
75:35 - alright that's gonna be the end of this
75:44 - cuz I am gonna go I am however standing
75:49 - up now so one thing that I want to just
75:58 - mention is a beta testing soft launching
76:02 - a new store design with a design by
76:11 - humans coding train let's see if it
76:14 - comes up in Google well it is if I go to
76:19 - the coding train website and click here
76:22 - now yeah this should take me there so
76:26 - you can see this is some new stuff some
76:28 - new designs that thank you - Jason hey
76:30 - Glen the the illustrator designer this
76:33 - is like my favorite this coding is
76:35 - magical little group but anyway so if
76:37 - you're interested people often ask and
76:39 - so I'm making this available these are
76:41 - also gifts that I will send out for
76:42 - patreon subscribers
76:43 - I gotta admit something those of you who
76:46 - are members are patreon subscribers i am
76:49 - i've already was behind on the mailing
76:52 - stuff that I'm doing and I had a
76:54 - wonderful person who would help me once
76:56 - a month in New York with getting
76:57 - mailings out and who's no longer
77:00 - available so I need to find a new person
77:01 - and I really said at the end of the
77:03 - month I have a backlog so apologies
77:05 - about that I love a bunch of you have
77:07 - met direct message to me and slack I
77:09 - will write back to you I see those like
77:10 - notes pop up and my heart sinks and a
77:13 - part of me wants to like take away the
77:16 - levels of funding where I send people
77:18 - gifts cuz I'm so bad at I do get them to
77:20 - eventually but so bad at it but I don't
77:23 - know but if you want as your patron
77:25 - gift one of these that's really easy and
77:28 - I could actually do that for you
77:29 - instantly because I don't have to like
77:30 - sign and mail myself so bla bla bla bla
77:33 - bla I am going to go oh go Dodgers you
77:40 - go watch the World Series no worry old
77:44 - school reals that doesn't really thank
77:45 - you Raghav and thank you again to stuff
77:51 - chef Anya for being here I learned by
77:53 - the way that the pronunciation of her
77:54 - name is jeff' Anya I don't even think
77:57 - Stefan yeah I might not be saying it
77:59 - correctly but I'm attempting to and yeah
78:03 - so I'll be back next Friday next Friday
78:05 - is a really tricky day for me to be
78:07 - honest I have a whole workshop that I'm
78:09 - teaching next Friday so hopefully I'll
78:11 - be back next Friday for some reason I'm
78:12 - not back next Friday I'll make make that
78:14 - time up maybe the following week is also
78:16 - I got a kind of take some time to
78:18 - stretch and relax so hopefully I won't
78:22 - be gone for too long thank you to
78:24 - everyone and you're nice so I think
78:26 - there is a dis dot sticker so if like I
78:28 - click here someone's asking like you can
78:31 - get this as a sticker as well I haven't
78:33 - actually ordered any of these I can
78:35 - order them in bulk on sticker mule so
78:38 - I'm gonna try to do that as well so you
78:39 - can get this as a sticker as well for a
78:42 - low low price of three dollars so and
78:45 - please send your thoughts and comments
78:48 - and Sebastian of support and to Jason
78:51 - hagglund who did all these designs okay
78:58 - Dan will you ever finish agario part
79:01 - three I would like to say yes I have a
79:06 - bad habit of starting things and saying
79:08 - I'm gonna do another part and never
79:09 - getting to them I hope that's not true
79:11 - of this logo challenge so I got to do a
79:14 - better job of that I don't know what to
79:16 - tell you I don't have a good system for
79:18 - keeping track of things right now I'm
79:20 - feeling like to be honest like very over
79:22 - overwhelmed with all the things I have
79:24 - to do it's which comes with like having
79:26 - a full time job and trying to do this
79:28 - YouTube stuff but things open up for me
79:30 - a lot in January in the spring semester
79:32 - so remind me about these things I will
79:34 - try to get to them and release the code
79:39 - so we could try making it on our own let
79:41 - me do that right now what's the best way
79:45 - for me to do that
79:47 - so let's make a repo let me do this real
79:50 - quick before I go okay a couple things
80:00 - let me just do this what should I call
80:06 - this logo I'll just call this logo
80:11 - coding train look I'll just call it logo
80:14 - like I might rename the repository repo
80:19 - for implementation of logo in JavaScript
80:23 - p5 initialized with the readme license
80:31 - and oh sorry about that you'll have to
80:33 - excuse me for slowly walking over to
80:35 - turn the camera on and then of fr3 foo
80:47 - asks do you check your email info the
80:48 - current cycle eventually yes eventually
80:53 - I do check it I actually I probably read
80:56 - the comments on the YouTube channel
80:57 - before I get to that so now there's
81:01 - probably a totally different way to
81:03 - organize this repo and everything but
81:05 - I'm just going to do this commit code
81:09 - from livestream and I'm going to do this
81:12 - and I am also going to settings pages
81:28 - I'll turn that on and we're good to go
81:32 - okay everybody good bye thank you for
81:35 - watching I'll be back soon I hope all
81:38 - you have to do is uh check the page of
81:41 - the channel when I schedule a new
81:42 - livestream it appears they're typically
81:44 - on Fridays at some arbitrary time these
81:46 - days later in the afternoon Eastern Time
81:48 - but who knows if you have if you're able
81:51 - to join as a member
81:52 - that's great I'll give Sun you a slack
81:54 - invite and I kind of keep people up to
81:56 - date on my schedule in there too okay
81:58 - goodbye everybody thank you so much for
82:01 - tuning in today Wow oh I don't I'm not
82:04 - ready to turn the stream off here it is
82:08 - where is that page stop streaming here
82:10 - it is goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hello I am here I am back it is Friday it is 430 p.m. wouldn't it be 900 in New York City wouldn't it be nice to just say it's five o'clock on a Friday I'm out of here weekend time but no I'm gonna code something before I go I have done something to my back I have often had like back strain and I do a lot of exercises and stretching unfortunately this morning I was helping my daughter get ready for school I like we were in a rush I like reached over and I did something so I'm a little bit off of my game and I was so thrilled to have Stefania visit the coding train goes like oh good I'm not feeling so great today and I hadn't have a guess it's this really interesting topic and she's so dynamic so that was wonderful thank you if you don't know what I'm talking about between 3 o'clock and 4 o'clock I had a livestream with a guest stephania doodoo guide you can go back and watch that from Romania her wonderful project kogda means okay so but I kind of I feel like I need to send the weekend off with a coding challenge I have a bunch of topics that I'm really trying to do as part of my kind of more multisession course materials word Tyvek is kind of what I am focusing on right now some more machine learning topics and some other things that I have in the back of my mind but I think I'd like to just code something ridiculous and fun and nice that maybe people could make their own version of and then go and start the weekend and do a lot of like resting and stretching and that sort of thing all right so all right so a continuous line drawing I wondered if you could recreate although I'm looking at this looking at this topic suggested by Nate here in the chat let me look at this I have an idea by the way it's for what to do using processing to scribble curves based on image brightness whoa that is really cool huh hold I'm looking at this let me go find this one I really I do like this idea this is definitely something I could do something around let me go to rainbow topics github.com slash coding train so this is where I kind of keep a list of topics one that I was thinking of doing was turtle graphics Oh continuous line drawing here it is open three days ago why not so look at this to scribble curves based on image brightness this is qtip of A Tribe Called Quest to commemorate the release of the Low End Theory 27 years ago I like this idea thinking about this I hope you think about how I would do this I mean I guess I could read so first of all I'm always wary of taking somebody else's idea and then making coopting somebody else's idea in a way that's not appropriate I think this could be a fun thing to try crediting this I guess reddit author as the originator of this idea and it doesn't look like the code I guess I have to read this it's more complicated but for three different brightness ranges the code starts shape at a random nonwhite pixel from the image then it randomly checks the other XY coordinates for pixels from the image that are close and brightness and close in location it finds one it adds as a curve vertex and marks the surrounding pixels as done so they won't get picked up by the algorithm in subsequent loots after it finds a lot of points that add a curve vertex to it ends the shape and moves to the next brightness range interesting interesting there's a lot of random point guessing which makes the algorithm inefficient but it can draw one of these images in five to ten seconds and I like the random search result all right let's let's try to do this why not what's the wide beam I bail and by moving really slowly today oh I'm definitely do this is this great because I can do this in processing I'm sure it won't make something as nice as this but I like it alright hold on let me read that again three different brightness ranges the code starts a shape at a random not white pixel it then randomly checks the other XY coordinates four pixels from the image that are close in brightness and close in location oh all right so I had a different way of doing this maybe I'll try my way this way it's probably better this way it's better I'm sure Valerio is asking for my opinion on the whole christie's ai artwork fiasco I know please don't make me try to talk about that I'm just gonna cry so ya know pacman sorry a lot of people are asking for pacman that's I'm not gonna do that today I was thinking what if I tried to trace yeah yeah maybe I should try this I'm a little weary I just like God I feel like this person has invented something really interesting and I should let that without their permission I should let them have the opportunity to publish their code so I'm actually gonna hold off on this but I do like this idea if somebody wants to contact this author find out the next five minutes but I think I wouldn't want to do this without their permission okay so I'm gonna hold off for a little bit on that I do like that idea though go back to the chat here all right okay Nathan sorry not my idea yes one thing I wanted to do is actually just program a turtle graphics engine which just means all you could do is say forward forward left right which would be kind of interesting and people could build on top of that and then I have this other idea so something that I'm to do that we're doing here at ITP where I teach which is a workshop about generating project ideas and this tool is something that's in progress don't than p5 which will generate a random project idea make a project about imagination that spins a motor with pong I don't have a motor so I gotta expand it again make a project about hunger that tickles with a particle system hmm logo let's make logo let's make logo these are great I'll come back and use this let's make logo coding challenge logo should we use processing probably we should use p5.js shall we use the web editor why not so what is logo like what are the Wikipedia what are the Felix says maybe try a simple Tetris implementation no I the things that I would like to do next when I want to do a Rubik's Cube everyone keeps asking about that and there was another one that was in my head I don't know I can't remember now but there's another one that was in my head no not this logo logo turtle graphics look turtle is there a disambiguation page turtle graphics logo there we go is what I'm looking for so we are going to create them so what are the actual elements of the language is there a way that I could the original logo from 1967 is there a way I could find out what the commands were so commands in logo commit original logo commands logo tutorial could this be it from 1997 forward backward right left clear screen okay each of these commands are followed by one value called its argument the arguments for forward and backward are units those of right and left are angles I say forward units backwards right an angle left an angle CS clear screen so what I want to make is a logo interpreter so I'll use like a text box I'll use a text box that the user can enter in these commands I'm gonna need to I don't think I think this is gonna be complicated enough that I'm not gonna want to use the P 5 web editor for this is pen up and pen down simple logo drawing commands does anyone fact right this is what I want to be able to do I want to be able to oh and then it also the repeat command alright why not I can parse for this Oh and then another okay I might not be able to do all of these okay this is great this is great this is I'm totally doing this oh I really really hurt myself here this is this is fine this is gonna be good alright let's go to I term I guess I could I would do this in processing except it's not going to be easy to have I mean I could load a text file with the commands in it that could be one way of approaching it but I'm not and so I could have like just a text editor open maybe I should do that let's do that okay of course we will make a okay and then now let me just test out this idea oh but regular expressions for split and everything is gonna be so awkward be so much nicer to use JavaScript regular expressions probably I think I have to do this in JavaScript I think this is complex enough though that I am going to want to whoops use pin up and pen down will certainly be useful yes hello oh okay native JavaScript please and how did chance I appreciate it i I don't think I'd be able to do this with native JavaScript something is very unstable here gonna be standing still while coding today maybe this wasn't a good idea well didn't I just install that Oh huh huh what did I do to my path well I'm not gonna worry about that place I'm not gonna worry about that I'll just get a get one of my previous things that I've been doing like we're Tyvek or something oh yeah let me just grab one of my word Tyvek examples go to the desktop logo I don't need this get rid of everything get rid of everything okay something has gone wrong with my zsh what has gone on with my zsh setup is this the problem let's just restart terminal I don't want to get lost in this but hmm this looks good I don't see anything in here that's missing where am i know'd did I lose my like note packages note is there or of course oh you know what all right hold on sorry I'm gonna have to do this cuz this is making me crazy I think maybe I forgot a little thing here which is this do I have any who am I using NPM global I do this yes this is where that's where my packages are and I did that and I think that I don't have this in my path so I don't know why I don't have that in my path that should do it I apologize if you don't know what I'm doing I don't have the energy to explain it right now but it is kind of in my there we go it is in my workflow videos okay let me just explain what just happened there I know global node modules are a thing that I can have included in my path meaning any global node module I have installed like HTTP server I can just run with the HTTP server command however I did not have that that my terminal my console didn't know about that directory and p.m. global or I'm installing the stuff so I had to add this and I'm using Zee shell so what it's called but whatever shell you are you need to have the path know about that directory okay that aside now I should be able to go to a my run it I should be able to go to here and oh did I quit it and see oh I'm like let me go back to a desktop logo HTTP server and we've got a little console going here and then let's think about this I'm just gonna add before I start a text area is that what is called ID equals code I mean a text area let's see I don't want to have to figure this out and then what's the thing do I say like cols equals 80 or something you know and then rows something like that oh that's way too much and then can I put stuff in there like the ideas I can put stuff in there like oh shoot how do I where'd those logo commands go oh this is like this I just want to see is this and then here there we go yep there we go okay let's make it the canvas 200 200 and a text that big so I just didn't want to have to do this in the coding challenge because this is like a lot of configuration e stuff okay great there we go okay I think I'm set okay okay everyone's gonna be okay Oh put things in quotes okay yeah I'm supposed to put these in quotes this is gonna be a me not moving around so much coding challenged oh boy let me just give me a second here case I need to use the whiteboard cycle the camera okay and let me close things that don't need to be open this can be minimized and code is visible this is visible and we are ready to go how's everybody doing okay all those temperatures get ride that chair and sit and I actually have a chair in this room I'm just curious what happens if I use the chair just give me a second here sher might provide me a little support it's a little bit weird for me to use a chair it's a little kind of tool Oh weird how do you guys feel about me using this chair I'm gonna use this chair today I've never done this but I actually feel much more stable using the chair I especially like and I'll get up if I have to but this is gonna be much better for my back today standing was a little bit of an issue okay I'm like doing everything sitting for the whole rest of this when the camera goes up at half an hour I'm gonna have to get up okay put books on the seat I wish the seat would go yeah people will the seat go higher oh they little knobby thing that raises it up it's broken but it might be as high as it goes okay cherish dick how much lower today because I'm sitting in a chair this coding challenge requires a chair just me that needs the chair today okay I feel so organized it's like any papers like I'm a newscaster or something welcome to the coding training coding challenge today I'm going to make logo what do you mean you're gonna make logos so logo is an educational programming language designed in 1967 by all these people listed here and you can go read the Wikipedia page to learn more about the history I actually did learn in my youth maybe some of you did so what I mean by making logo is I want to create and pause look I want to create a interpreter I wouldn't I want to create a programming environment in the browser that basically does logo so I as the it's like spell checking me here how weird I can write logo commands and then watch my logo commands be executed in this canvas and probably what I should do is have a button that's like a run button but maybe I could be continuously interpreting it who knows so what are the logo commands so the idea of logo is turtle graphics the idea is that you're controlling a turtle to move around the screen the turtle move and the turtle could do a number of things and I found this tutorial from Brown University to a course you can find a link up here and these are the these are the drawing commands I can move forward by a certain amount I can go backwards by a certain amount I can turn right I could turn left by some angle and I can clear screen there are also other commands and there's like a repeat command and there's pen up pen down it's very straight a high turtle show turtle home label set XY so many possibilities I'm not going to implement everything because but I'm gonna do something or release this code and you the viewer will probably make your own magical logo interpreter maybe you don't even want to make a logo interpreter but just this idea of drawing in this way will inspire you to do something so and what would be interesting is it could I make a logo interpreter that then I paste something in here that would actually generate this particular pattern this example logo output so that's kind of like a bit of a challenge certainly I would need a repeat to be able to do that and this video will be approximately seven and a half hours long are you ready let's go alright so the first thing that I want to do Oh what do I want to do I guess I need to parse this so okay what did I what do I have already so I have already an HTML page that has a text area in it and that text area has this sort of like logo code written in there so what I can do and I'm using the p5.js library and now what I can do is I can say I'm gonna make a something called editor I'm gonna say editor equals select code and then I'm going to say console dot log editor dot value I'm gonna call the value function was that what it's gonna be let's see whoops refresh there we go okay so that's how I get the code so I could say a let code equals editor dot value then what do I need to do I need to parse this and looks to me like I can quite easily parse this with a space this fitting is weird I've also read in front of phone I don't like it this went away okay everyone's saying everyone's telling me to just embrace the chairman embrace the chair okay so where was I thank you much always for your editing support okay so the delimiter here the thing that defines each block here is a space so I can really nicely I can do say something like let tokens tokens as I sort of word that's often used in computational things to describe a single unit a token of text a word token a sentence token a character token because what I want to do is say split and it's the most simplest level I just want to split that text up by by spaces and I can do all sorts of fancy stuff in here like use a regular expression and split it in fancier ways and I'm going to need error handling I'm not going to worry about any of that I am just going to go ahead and say look at this alright look at this oh look this is weird extra carriage return thing but I'm not gonna worry about that we can see now I have something that splits up everything by that splits up everything by like water is over there one second everyone it splits up everything into an element of an array and actually I'm getting a nice suggestion from the chat that if I call console table it might I might be able to see it in a nice other way like oh that's really nice good that console dot table like my favorite thing ever okay so there we go so we can see there's the array all right so what do I want to do I have like a crazy idea let's build a dictionary what I mean by a dictionary let's make a JavaScript object we're each one of these each one of these commands is a function is is it is math each one of these keys the command is mapped to a function why what what am I talking about let me show you with code so let's let's actually make a another javascript file called turtle j s and normally i would make like a turtle graphics a turtle object which would really make sense i'm actually let's do that let's make a turtle claw object because the turtle is going to need the turtle is the thing that's moving and drawing so the turtle is going to have an x value maybe it'll be initialized somewhere the turtle will have a Y value and that's good right now and the turtle might have functions like you know forward backward backward because this idea that I had was to then also have an object like commands equal and then like forward would be a key mapped to a particular function and in that function we would you know translate by some amount by you know some length or something maybe I'm always gonna move forward along the xaxis all have to be wrote right I could I could do that so I was thinking about doing this but it kind of makes sense to have an object hmm hmm oh right it definitely needs a direction this is very important like I might call it angle like it needs a direction I don't know if it makes it's called direction or angle maybe the direction but it's eat it's initialized as an angle but I kind of so I'm gonna do this right now and this by the way would be what was the actual command its FD for forward so I'm gonna put this away for a little bit and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say let turtle and I'm gonna make a turtle turtles a new turtle and it's going to start in the middle of the window with an angle of zero so this is going to be the initial turtle and then let's think so let's forget about the fact that I have to follow the logo commands and let's just for a second actually program the things I would do so if I'm gonna go forward by some amount I'm going to say translate by that amount I'm gonna everything's gonna be like along the xaxis if I'm gonna go backward watch this I could say forward by negative amount this dot forward whoa visual studio coach has corrected that for me let me try that again forward scary look it's like how Gmail writes their email for you now this dot forward negative amount right so backward is moving forward by a negative amount what were some of the other commands where were they right so right would be I'm gonna say right oh by the way so I actually when I read the command I don't need to have forward and backward cuz I'm just gonna use my forward command so anyway we'll see but like right would be by some angle I would say rotate no don't autocorrect for me by that some angle so that's what I'm gonna do I couldn't so I'm probably going to use the fact that p5 has this whole transformation matrix and I have some video tutorials about that pushpop translate rotate so I can actually control the turtle that way I could do all that math with trigonometry but I'm gonna stick with that and every song me that like that this dot thing this table this blog um has been around for quite a while in in Visual Studio code okay never forget that this dot now I won't be able to forget but I want to forget it like what if I did this uh we can I never uh am I never gonna forget again like what if I did something weird like this it doesn't change it it did it with functions it didn't know to change my instance variable okay alright so let's stick with this for a second and I am going to also I need to know whether if so uh the turtles gonna need a Penn State so let's make a variable called Penn that's true when the pen is drawing and false when the pen is not drawing so I would say if and then ooh oh I don't need the XY so do I need I need the starting point so the starting point would actually just be translate to that XY and interestingly enough I don't necessarily need to keep track of these things let's think about that I might and then rotate by that angle so when I create it I'm actually just like translating and rotating then forward if this dot pen I want to say line by some amount Oh from zero zero to the amount comma zero like I want to draw a line I'm considering the xaxis to be the kind of universal access I'm gonna rotate from there that makes sense for it to be the yaxis to be honest cuz we might think of it starting going up but whatever I can always change that I'm gonna draw that line and actually so I want to draw the line first and then translate to the end of the line that's what I want to do and rotate is just rotate okay so if I have forward and right I don't think that I need backward what I'm going to do now in here is I'm gonna say for every token on tokens let oh no I have that already yeah let's do this in like a ridiculous way for a second if token equals forward then amount equals oh no I should use an inner I should use a an index here but I because I'm gonna want to look at the next one I is less than tokens dot length I plus plus you know what I'm gonna be even crazier and I'm gonna say index equals zero while index is less than tokens dot length I'm gonna manually kind of iterate over this thing and I'm gonna say let token equal tokens index then I'm gonna say if token equals forward and I want to think of like a different way of organizing this code for sure switch statement I know you're all thinking if token equals forward then amount should be tokens index plus one and then I could say turtle forward amount right so what's in the actual instructions forward right forward right oh this is good only forward and right that's perfect else if token equals right then let angle equal also the next one and then turtle right so I say is it right I mean maybe I should make this turn whatever right by the angle oh and I should say angle mode degrees because the the angle is being given in degrees not in radians if that's not a familiar concept to you I refer you to some other video that they have about radians and angles okay so now okay so now yes so people in the chat are telling me I can say index plus plus so why can I say that let me show you why so let's say I have a variable like I equals zero well we know that I plus plus is the same as saying I equals I plus one so I plus plus but it also returns that value so it resets the value and returns it it actually allows me to move forward so I was going to lazily just say at the end I plus equal to but it would make sense for me to actually say index and index not I index plus plus in here which is like go to the next one and use the value of the next one all at the same time and then afterwards I could go one more because I need to go to the next one okay because not everything will be in a pair we'll see all right so let's look at that and I'm gonna hit refresh mmm and I have an error somewhere Oh too many curly brackets I'm gonna put this here and here we go whoops nope refresh ah tokens is not defined code split why is tokens not defined where's tokens out to find Sketch up Jess line six Oh because I had I was console logging in I don't need to console log anymore but let's leave that in there turtle is not to fight okay so of course I need to also here reference and add my other JavaScript script which has turtle J yes okay ready so one thing I have to think about here is hmm let's set up a stroke of I got a really deal someone's gonna help me figure out how to turn off this autocomplete that I don't want in Visual Studio code I think someone already did tell me this and I forgot to look at it I think it was Nathan Thank You Nathan oh and there's plus plus index and index plus plus which is something from the chest Becky maybe I'll come back and talk about that a second all right a stroke 255 let's just add stroke wait one just we actually don't need to add that that's fine actually let's make it a little thicker just so it's easier to see stroke wait oh yeah let's see hmm so why am I not seeing anything so let's console.log some stuff a little debugging here console dot log token and console dot log forward let's see if that happens okay forward for ya ford forward right forward forward so it is getting forward let's look at oh you know what this is a string turtle dot forward amount is gonna have puff trouble understanding that I wonder if I should have this I'm sorry I should probably convert I could do something like this converts it to a number or like parse int might be good let's do parse in that might be a little more Universal so let's add that I was thinking that might be the problem let's console.log amount ooh not a number not a number huh I hold on everybody something is terribly wrong oh so it's actually no thank you breaking news from the chat I actually have to use the plus plus index this is why I didn't want to use that so the chat is going crazy over this mistake listen to the chat please I'm just sitting in a chair it's hard for me to see the chat okay I don't use these things I like to be longwinded in how I code so let's go back to here ha so sad let's let's look here at right so let's let's go and investigate in I equals 0 I plus plus I'm going to see it actually is returning 0 I plus plus you know I could say console.log I plus plus that is giving me the next value but I huh is actually 2 now that doesn't make any sense I'm so confused but plus plus I owe because it already was one right hold on let's start over again I equals zero console.log I plus plus that gives me zero right because even though I is now 1 I plus plus returns the original value of I there we go so that's actually not giving me the correct thing but plus plus I actually returns now getting 2 because it already went on to the next one so this increases the value of I and gives you back that new value so that I see this in shorthand all the time it's kind of like a ternary thing that I'm finally getting myself to use so this actually needs to be this plus plus index maybe that I plus plus so gave gap Gabriel in the chat saying I plus plus increments and returns the previous number plus plus I increments and returns the next number that's a nice succinct way of saying it all right so here we go so forward 60 60 so now things are looking up the turtle is printing out the right amount so let's console.log the amount here and let's give this a try all right so I don't need to console.log the token there's too many console logs here 63 times how come I didn't see I don't see a line look look at the chat I don't want to look at the chat that's the thing I like to figure these things out myself how come I don't see a line so turtle forward amount when I created the turtle I made it in the middle oh you know it's a little bit weird here is so this is this is not so good I'm a little suspicious that translate and stuff is not going to work the way I want in setup I need to move on to the draw loop like for example if I say translate 100 100 and then ellipse 400 0 0 200 200 let's just run this for a second also what why am I not drawing anything Oh draw background zero this whole thing I'm calling background I can see the chat actually saying that now I've been calling background this whole time what a terrible problem okay let's go back and see if my logic now is sound my brain operates more slowly when sitting apparently okay let's try this all right weird I don't know what just happened there Oh background zero let's draw the background zero here there we go look at that turtle graphics um now I kind of feel like forward 60 should probably start pointing up does anybody know how logo actually works turning right it definitely turned the right direction like left would be the other way I don't know that this matters so much I'll leave it like this okay so alright we're kind of good I've got to deal with other commands anyone have an idea I would love to take an idea about how to I mean I could use a switch statement but I kind of like the idea of a lookup table what if what I did is I hat took this idea I wanna try this idea of my commands I have an idea oh this will work if I have it totally have a crazy idea so forward is a function that calls that calls oh boy no it goes here anonymous function is a function that calls a turtle got forward I have to figure out how to do the argument then backward is the same thing but maybe it calls it with so can I give it how do I give this an argument cuz I want to self execute I have to think about this somebody somebody think about this I can bind it with something what is this is this a sound strategy right is then a function that calls turtle dot right in other words what I want to do is say oh but I still I want to say I want to say basically commands token execute oh yeah I can give it an argument huh of course tokens plus plus index look at this so this should do exactly what I was doing right the token is forward execute the function with that command with the argument yeah so I don't need an if statement here all I need is this right because now it's going to and so the argument goes here the argument for backward goes here and I just do negative amount then right is the angle turn right the angle and then this is I don't know if this is a sound solution but I'm intrigued by it left is turn right but by negative the angle okay so this your work this is a little bit nuts looking but let me unpack this for you if I had a function right if I had a function that's you know forward with an amount this is actually what this is doing because I have this resolves itself to this number that's the argument after the command and this resolves itself to a function that's defined up here that I'm calling so I think this is gonna work let's try this and for some reason I feel like having this in a separate I feel like having this in here let me zoom back out like this just makes more sense to me to have this with the turtle class because they kind of go together okay no commands token is not a function why not okay commands is a function commands token mmhmm or use es6 proxy someone's telling me about mmm I don't know about es6 process so console.log token console.log commands let me just see what's going on here so oh no I just got to the end so it got to the end because there was an invalid token there so so first thing I need to do is make sure if commands token even exists so I want to make sure it exists and if not I want to skip it so this is a little bit of you know kind of pathetic error handling but should work and now I can say whew look at that we've got turtle graphics right I could add another you know left left 64 word 50 oh I don't have any way oh I'm not so I need to realtime interprets realtime interpret this what do I mean by that so what I mean by that is I have already did I didn't really explain these pieces I just realized at the beginning so I made a text area I think I did with an ID and then I used the p5 Dom library okay I did explain this alright so but what I can do is I can attach an event and the event that I want to attach is editor input and then and then basically I want to say like go turtle so anytime I make any change and actually maybe I want it let's start with changed let's just start with change so change is an event that that like only executes when you've finished a task like you hit enter or you tab out of thing so and now I could take all of this and this is my function go turtle and again I'm kind of not really using a more modern es6 javascript here but i think that's fine oh the camera back Dan back problem Dan is coming over to the camera by the way the microphone hopefully is like the batteries are low so thank you Matt so once again how my time wise 523 is pretty good yeah I don't know what an es 6 proxy is okay okay all right my back so let me what was I doing yeah okay so now I have goat turtle it should execute whenever I change anything in the editor so let's delete all this and tab out of it ah code dot split is not a function why not oh I've got to get the new stuff from the editor and you know I could select it I know it's a little silly have this global variable but whatever it's fine okay refresh if I do this tab out I got this now I can say you know write 100 but I wanted to live interpret why not right it should be I should be able to write enough error handling that it can like interpret the code live so I'm gonna change this to input and you'll see like when I oh if I had space right oh but I also need to redraw the background ooh this is fun okay so now I can start deleting stuff weird oh and guess what another thing I need to do I need to say push and push and pop because I don't want it to pick up from where it last left off I always wanted to start from the beginning okay I can see all the comments of people helping me fix by Visual Studio studio code okay now this should so first of all I want it to run once at the beginning so I also need to call go turtle at least once all right and now if I start deleting look at that it's actually real time interpreting so I could say forward 510 left one left 90 forward 100 look at that oh I love this it's like realtime interpreting what kind of dare I say somewhat done with this coding challenge but we can't stop here right I mean everybody tells me don't make a video on YouTube that's longer than 20 minutes that's what it's gonna be as long as it is because I want to be able to do this and I think there's a lot more to implement like I should implement pen up and pen down that would be a pretty easy one to do let's do that let's implement that just to show you but I'm gonna ask you I'm gonna ask you maybe we'll make this a community project um I will release the code as is the finished version of this coding challenge on github the coding train website but I will also make a new repository look at the videos link for for a version that people could contribute to so if I do what is pen up and pen down PU I'm so immature PU function would be turtle dot pen equals true right and then PD would be a function that is turtle dot pen equals false so I should be able to use those now right so for example if I just refresh my code here if I say right here pan up it should okay so something didn't work let's think about this turtle pan equals true oh it still moves but it doesn't draw the line that's right so let's look at this again it shouldn't move on you just move on by one index I guess we're gonna have to console.log here let's be let's debug this forward 60 let's do forward 40 right 90 pen up forward 100 right 90 forward 50 huh so what happened when it's up you won't write which is I don't want it to but I want it to still move forward like it still should translate let's let's console.log what am i console logging this amount and we're how'd it get in there with not a number that's weird I don't want it to ever do that so let's look at let's make sure let's count back and console hog this is a it's gonna be a little debugging here going on the chat will probably tell me what's wrong but I'm gonna say console and and let me just actually here now let me just change this to something that I want to test right 90 Ford 50 right ninety pen up Ford 50 right ninety oh I need to pen down that's why maybe it's working I never did pen down let's see pen down forward fifty maybe it actually worked okay forward fifty right ninety forward 50 right ninety pen up forward fifty right 90 pen no I should see a line here I should see a last line there it expects a number it shouldn't oh oh because it's actually oh interesting it's doing this for every command so it only should do this if command token so how do I of course so it needs to know not to do this so I could yeah don't increment the token index again yeah but I'm trying to do this within a like elegant way without an if statement like right like somehow I want to like return something to tell it not to go up but I already going up to get the angle so I mean I could like certainly I could say if commands right I mean I could do something like if token so what's a like starts with P like index of P equals zero right that's a quick way to see a car at this is more this makes work car at zero equals as long as token all right if token car at zero equals P someone's going to suggest a better way to do this but let's just get this working right now then commands token hmm just execute it without any arguments else execute it with this and go up by one so this should do the trick right based on what the token is yeah what are like return the amount but I feel like I got to think about this more let's just get let's just make this work let's make this work sketch 32 okay so I have I'm out of I'm incorrect in my like land of brackets if there is an actual command if oh no that if it equals P by the way this should be if it equals P if token car at 0 equals P then just execute the command with no argument otherwise execute commands for the next argument what's wrong here I guess I'm just missing another curly bracket somehow very good for working around forward 50 right 94 what happened here clop what's called that matching oh whoa that pop has to be out here okay there we go right forward 50 right 90 forward 50 right 90 pen up didn't go forward 50 pen up which should make the pen be false and then it should go then forward still remove the nut yeah I already got that part the chat's behind me and oh yes a better way would be to have Nathan in the chat so the better way would be to have additional methods in the commands to tell it how many arguments take but hold on I'm gonna like debug why is this not working because let's go look at my turtle object forward if this up and it should stuff it should still move forward even without drawing the amount so why didn't it do that so I guess I'm gonna have to do some console logging I mixed up pen down and pen up that's why thank you very much is that really why pen up oh yeah and down there we go oh look at the chat going crazy I inverted pan up and pen down all right but this is exciting because I can change this to pen down ooh wait it froze do I have some sort of bad infinite loop here hold on I have a problem oh this has to this I always need to go up by the next index bad infinite loop problem hold on edit this little second out okay this was a big problem my index plus plus I need to always go to the next one so I'm gonna have to this this this page is frozen I'm gonna have to kill it somehow and there we go okay so now I should be able to change things around again oh no it's still oh because it didn't it was cached because I didn't have the console of it can I get it back no try again you know I'm just gonna do is kill the server let's kill the server I've got a little local server running with HTTP server let's see if that manages to get get me back here and let me open up the console and this should be good now okay yeah all right I'm back pen down right we can we can make up whatever we want forward 100 forward 10 right 10 forward 10 left left 90 pen up forward ooh what just happened something happened something broke background ooh what's this background should be here hmm let's try this again why did things break just there what bugs do I have stroke zero on pen up oh that's an interesting idea that's I love that idea that's a really good idea maybe I won't do that right now because people might want to play with color in a different way but why did it break forward okay forward 10 right 90 forward 20 right 90 pen up why does that kill it and then it doesn't come back there's no error there's a really weird bug I've done index plus plus in two locations no that's right this should move on an extra one with the argument why as soon as I do pen up whereas at the beginning the pen up is fine right if I take this out yeah that's so weird is it depend not getting you rerun the input I need haha CJ coding garden with CJ shoutout to watch go to garden with CJ Thank You CJ for this I sort of forgot that the turtles not this is right here everything this is the sort of reinitializing everything like background re initializes everything the pop here undoes what it does so in a way the transformations are initialized again and then I get the the code from the editor from scratch but I didn't reset the turtle so I should really have a function that says like turtle reset I mean there's a lot of different ways I could do this but let's actually do that so let's let's actually keep all these things put this in a function called reset and say this dot X this dot y this angle and watch this we're gonna watch the magic a Visual Studio code to type my this dot in for me okay so now that should fix that problem X is not defined because I forgot oh wait hmm where's that X is not defined in turtle digest line 30 huh there we go okay so why don't I see anything out this duck pen equals true oh no oh because aha no go turtle oh why isn't it that was such a good idea but oh maybe turtle reset needs to be here before I do push this dot dr now I are not this dot angle there we go thank you thank you to the chat it's this variable this dot Direction dir okay didn't seem to fix anything here okay well let's let's let's be let's actually do some debugging here console dot log this dot X this dot y this dot dir let's look at those things 100 hundred zero right that's good why did I see that twice just now oh because when I initialized the turtle that's fine though so I actually don't need to call this dot reset here whoops if I'm doing it well there we go good now it's not do it it's doing the right thing so now I should be able to just start deleting stuff this is gonna freak it out like so I'm not doing total error checking but now I can say forward 100 there we go for 10 right 90 forward 50 left 90 pen up forward and left 94 100 all right so what did I I broke it so is this invalid forward 10 hi over there I'm still here with you right 90 forward 50 left 90 left 90 would be go this way pen up forward 10 left 90 oh I didn't do pen down bend down there we go it's working all right here's the thing so we've got we've got turtle graphics now we really need to do that the last thing I need to do at least is the repeat button the repeat command I kind of don't want to do the repeat command because it's gonna create a huge set of complications but I can't let this finish at 30 seconds five you say cut down I can't let this go without that because I really want to see they really want to see this at the end and I feel like somebody work out what the logo commands are for this I mean this is kind of like my phyllotaxis spiral kind of thing so let's see if we can get repeat working so again what are the commands I haven't done hi turtle show turtle oh that would be great because we gotta have a turtle also be really nice to animate it going that I haven't done but let's at least think about repeat okay and then you need to use the bracket okay so the idea is that I am going to have something like let me just grab this right this would be like a square or triangle this is what I had before okay all right this should be doable this should be doable I might need some kind of crazy recursion but I think if I just think about only being able to do one repeat right now it'll be a little easier so I definitely need now a new command repeat and I need to change the way I'm splitting up the text so actually yeah some kind of recursion here is gonna be necessary let's actually let's split up array of arrays here go okay I got it so what if I first split by let's look at this basically I want to split by this I want to have token token and then this a full token so I want to split by well if I just split by I feel like I'm thinking show a train of course it should be the train I'm thinking this could be a little this could be a little moment to like edit out well I think here I could just use a regular expression because I could basically match but it's got to be a way to split it up by the problem is like I want to split by this space but not by this space so it needs to be a I could probably like look ahead and look behind right any space that's not in between brackets right look ahead does anybody know look ahead look behind in regular expressions that's what I think I need to do here right no space that's inside of brackets all right so I thought about this for a bit and my idea is to use a regular expression because whoops whoops whoops whoops whoops tries again okay I thought about this for a bit my idea is to use a regular expression oh oh actually Adam is saying you should parse the input sequentially that's also another idea hold on timeout implement a stack push when oh yeah oh that's a token oh that's ah okay usually you don't start by splitting splitting with space won't work just space your key words right doesn't have look behind no no no this is actually a really good idea not to use rep I should use a stack and actually yes so I actually want yeah okay let me think about this boy this is really hard I knew I shouldn't have done the repeat because let's just let me I'll come back to this in a second hold on I got to check my messages here hold on a sec I might have to go this this video might have to end and I'll have to come back into a part two with repeat I didn't realize was 545 so I might have to wrap this up I think I'm gonna have to wrap this up and yeah so what I can do I think actually is basically I want I want this bracket to also be a token so basically like just for a second here let's look at how we would split this and I'm gonna have to come back back and do this I'm gonna wrap up this enough to finish this another time because right and I could write I could pull the things out one at a time and then parse it differently that would make more sense actually you need to stream tokens as they go a token stops at a space scanner should be feeding with one character till the whole sentence is read yes okay so I'm gonna stop here so okay because I have to go and this was fun also to be perfectly honest I have some like which I think should figure out the number of art yes and these are all such great suggestions and I'm gonna do it in a part two so and I'll do that next week so let me try to like back up here for me somewhere where I was here okay where I went to say I have to do repeat alright so thank you for free okay so this works now I could put in any kind of commands that I want and get the result of the turtle graphics drawing but I really really want to see this pattern and I could do some kind of crazy thing to generate the text that does this pattern that would be kind of a fun thing to do a little challenge for you watching to actually generate the text which would be very long to then render that but what would be better would be to actually implement this repeat command and so what the repeat command does it basically says repeat has an argument three and then it looks for the commands that are within these square brackets and does those commands three times so I'm gonna have to completely rethink the way that I split the text up just splitting it by like spaces is no good in fact you're probably gonna want to like parse the text as I go it could maybe do some kind of recursion or like a regular expression so this is my challenge to you implement the repeat command I will come back in a future coding challenge and do it based on the way you did it but I'm not gonna do that part of this challenge so right now this is wrapping up look in this video's description two links to the code exactly the way that I left it as well as perhaps a community project where I will accept pull requests to add keeping it simple add some features and and other commands that are part of turtle graphics also we need to Train okay let's just at least add the trained coding tree logo this is how I'm finding it there we go you know what whatever note somebody will find the puget Edit point again also also you know like a grammar some type of like thinking about like a grammar might be away it's like we're really in the weeds of how like compilers and things work in a way we're interpreting in real time somebody else's code and executing it wow this is fun it does need a train so instead of a turtle could have a train or you can make a train a turtle or a train I don't know anymore I'm gonna go thank you for watching this coding where I implemented part of the original logo programming language and stay tuned for part two where I finished this off at least with the repeat command so it can generate some more interesting patterns and I look forward to your your own versions of this please share them with me on Twitter on the coding train comm website and in the comments here ok thank you good bye alright that's gonna be the end of this cuz I am gonna go I am however standing up now so one thing that I want to just mention is a beta testing soft launching a new store design with a design by humans coding train let's see if it comes up in Google well it is if I go to the coding train website and click here now yeah this should take me there so you can see this is some new stuff some new designs that thank you Jason hey Glen the the illustrator designer this is like my favorite this coding is magical little group but anyway so if you're interested people often ask and so I'm making this available these are also gifts that I will send out for patreon subscribers I gotta admit something those of you who are members are patreon subscribers i am i've already was behind on the mailing stuff that I'm doing and I had a wonderful person who would help me once a month in New York with getting mailings out and who's no longer available so I need to find a new person and I really said at the end of the month I have a backlog so apologies about that I love a bunch of you have met direct message to me and slack I will write back to you I see those like notes pop up and my heart sinks and a part of me wants to like take away the levels of funding where I send people gifts cuz I'm so bad at I do get them to eventually but so bad at it but I don't know but if you want as your patron gift one of these that's really easy and I could actually do that for you instantly because I don't have to like sign and mail myself so bla bla bla bla bla I am going to go oh go Dodgers you go watch the World Series no worry old school reals that doesn't really thank you Raghav and thank you again to stuff chef Anya for being here I learned by the way that the pronunciation of her name is jeff' Anya I don't even think Stefan yeah I might not be saying it correctly but I'm attempting to and yeah so I'll be back next Friday next Friday is a really tricky day for me to be honest I have a whole workshop that I'm teaching next Friday so hopefully I'll be back next Friday for some reason I'm not back next Friday I'll make make that time up maybe the following week is also I got a kind of take some time to stretch and relax so hopefully I won't be gone for too long thank you to everyone and you're nice so I think there is a dis dot sticker so if like I click here someone's asking like you can get this as a sticker as well I haven't actually ordered any of these I can order them in bulk on sticker mule so I'm gonna try to do that as well so you can get this as a sticker as well for a low low price of three dollars so and please send your thoughts and comments and Sebastian of support and to Jason hagglund who did all these designs okay Dan will you ever finish agario part three I would like to say yes I have a bad habit of starting things and saying I'm gonna do another part and never getting to them I hope that's not true of this logo challenge so I got to do a better job of that I don't know what to tell you I don't have a good system for keeping track of things right now I'm feeling like to be honest like very over overwhelmed with all the things I have to do it's which comes with like having a full time job and trying to do this YouTube stuff but things open up for me a lot in January in the spring semester so remind me about these things I will try to get to them and release the code so we could try making it on our own let me do that right now what's the best way for me to do that so let's make a repo let me do this real quick before I go okay a couple things let me just do this what should I call this logo I'll just call this logo coding train look I'll just call it logo like I might rename the repository repo for implementation of logo in JavaScript p5 initialized with the readme license and oh sorry about that you'll have to excuse me for slowly walking over to turn the camera on and then of fr3 foo asks do you check your email info the current cycle eventually yes eventually I do check it I actually I probably read the comments on the YouTube channel before I get to that so now there's probably a totally different way to organize this repo and everything but I'm just going to do this commit code from livestream and I'm going to do this and I am also going to settings pages I'll turn that on and we're good to go okay everybody good bye thank you for watching I'll be back soon I hope all you have to do is uh check the page of the channel when I schedule a new livestream it appears they're typically on Fridays at some arbitrary time these days later in the afternoon Eastern Time but who knows if you have if you're able to join as a member that's great I'll give Sun you a slack invite and I kind of keep people up to date on my schedule in there too okay goodbye everybody thank you so much for tuning in today Wow oh I don't I'm not ready to turn the stream off here it is where is that page stop streaming here it is goodbye
