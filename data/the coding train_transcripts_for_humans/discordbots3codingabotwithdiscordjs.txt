00:00 - oh dear i gotta get that other whistle
00:03 - back
00:03 - hello welcome back this is the third
00:05 - video oh we're getting to the good stuff
00:07 - in my how to make a discord bot series
00:10 - uh at this point by the end of this
00:11 - video i want my bot
00:13 - to say hello back to me say hello back
00:15 - to me bot please
00:16 - talk to me i'm lonely um and so that's
00:19 - going to happen by the end of this video
00:20 - so
00:21 - hopefully if you've come through the
00:23 - first two you've already created your
00:25 - own
00:26 - discord client application and bought
00:28 - and also you hopefully have
00:30 - terminal access to your computer with
00:33 - node installed so if you don't have
00:35 - those go back to the previous videos
00:36 - or look for the video descriptions for
00:38 - those steps that you need to follow but
00:40 - if you've got all that
00:41 - you're ready to go so i want to write
00:44 - some code
00:45 - i'm going to create a node application
00:47 - what is what do i mean by node
00:49 - application
00:49 - so typically in a lot of my other videos
00:52 - i've used node to write a web server to
00:54 - host a website
00:55 - or to maybe actually communicate with
00:57 - twitter in a twitter bot series
00:59 - so i tend to use node as a kind of
01:01 - catch-all javascript
01:02 - programming environment as a glue that
01:05 - connects different projects so maybe i
01:06 - want to talk to an api i want to set up
01:08 - a web server
01:09 - most of my videos are just using p5.js
01:11 - which is all client-side code
01:13 - that operates in the web browser this
01:15 - code that i'm going to write
01:16 - in my text editor and run from my
01:18 - console is just running locally here on
01:20 - this computer
01:21 - and it's running because i'm typing in
01:23 - commands to tell it to run and
01:24 - eventually we'll get to how we might
01:26 - deploy it somewhere else later
01:27 - but that's really the way i'm using node
01:29 - it's a programming environment to write
01:30 - my own software that runs on this
01:32 - computer
01:33 - it just so happens that the software has
01:34 - no interface whatsoever
01:36 - so i happen to have a folder on my
01:39 - computer called
01:40 - choo choo bot it's completely empty my
01:43 - console
01:43 - is now pointed at that folder and i can
01:46 - say pwd to confirm it's on the desktop
01:49 - of the coding train user choo choo bot
01:51 - and if i have node installed in order to
01:53 - start my node project
01:55 - the first thing i want to type is npm
01:58 - init so npm is node package manager
02:01 - it is a part of node and it allows you
02:03 - to manage your packages
02:05 - that makes sense now right but basically
02:07 - this is the command for i want to start
02:10 - a node project
02:11 - um so if i run that it's going to give
02:13 - me some prompts to say like oh why don't
02:15 - you tell me some stuff about this
02:17 - project like its name and its license
02:18 - and the author of it
02:20 - and you should be thoughtful and you can
02:22 - even set up some like settings on your
02:23 - computer to have it auto fill with
02:25 - key information but just to move through
02:26 - this kind of quickly right now
02:28 - i'm just gonna hit enter and i'm gonna
02:30 - say okay
02:31 - so all the defaults are now there uh and
02:35 - entered in for this project and if i go
02:36 - back to the folder i'll see that oh look
02:39 - at that
02:39 - i have a package.json file that is the
02:42 - configuration file for this particular
02:44 - project
02:45 - let's take a look at that file and to do
02:47 - that i can open up
02:50 - this folder in my text editor visual
02:52 - studio code
02:54 - i'm in code i go to file open
02:57 - and i select choo choo bot hit open
03:02 - let's look at package.json and there it
03:05 - is
03:05 - i also need to create now another file
03:09 - in package.json it says the main script
03:12 - that's part of this program the spot is
03:15 - index.js so of course i could name this
03:17 - anything i want and just to make that
03:18 - point let me change this to bot.js
03:20 - and then i'm going to create a new file
03:22 - called bot.js
03:24 - and i'm just going to say console.log
03:26 - beep beep
03:28 - and now i've got index.js package.json
03:31 - and if i go back to my console
03:34 - and i run the command node bot.js
03:38 - this is me running the code that's in
03:40 - bot.js
03:42 - beep beep now for this project i want to
03:44 - make use of something
03:46 - called discord.js discord.js
03:49 - is a node module that allows you to
03:51 - interact with the
03:52 - discord api very easily and that's
03:55 - exactly what i want
03:57 - and i've got the command right here to
03:59 - get going with it
04:00 - npm install discord.js
04:03 - i can type that command here
04:06 - this is going to add that module to my
04:09 - project
04:11 - i can go back and check package.json and
04:14 - you'll see
04:14 - right here it is now one of the
04:16 - dependencies so i have access
04:18 - to using the discord.js node module in
04:21 - my project
04:22 - now amazingly i have a full example
04:25 - right here
04:26 - i could just copy base this whole all of
04:28 - this code and i'm basically done with
04:30 - the bot
04:30 - already but i kind of want to work on it
04:32 - uh piece by piece
04:34 - um so i'll bring in these these elements
04:36 - uh one at a time
04:37 - but let me at least start by just copy
04:39 - pasting these first two lines of code
04:41 - which are a little hard for me to just
04:42 - sort of memorize
04:43 - the require function is a function that
04:45 - essentially imports
04:46 - the discord.js module and then i want to
04:49 - create a client
04:50 - the client is the object the javascript
04:53 - object
04:53 - that connects to the discord api itself
04:56 - to manage to run the bot
04:58 - but i need to very specifically
05:01 - authenticate
05:02 - with the discord api with that
05:04 - particular bot so this is now where i
05:06 - need to say client.login
05:08 - and this is where i need to put my bot
05:11 - token so i would say generally speaking
05:15 - it's a pretty bad idea to just hard code
05:17 - your bot
05:18 - token right into your code ultimately
05:21 - i'm going to want to like keep that in a
05:22 - separate configuration file
05:24 - a dot env file is something that i've
05:26 - used before and i have other video
05:27 - tutorials about that i'll come back and
05:28 - do that with this project
05:30 - but just to get it working and if you're
05:32 - following along just for testing i'm
05:33 - just going to paste
05:34 - my token right in there and of course by
05:37 - the time you're watching this i'll have
05:38 - regenerated my token
05:40 - so that won't be the valid one that you
05:42 - that you so you know so that nobody
05:44 - could
05:44 - watch this video and take over my bot so
05:46 - i'm back on
05:47 - the discord developer portal in my
05:49 - application on the bot page and i can
05:51 - click copy to get my token
05:54 - and then i can paste it right here and
05:57 - let's run this again
06:04 - well it's just sitting there how do i
06:06 - know if it worked
06:07 - so probably i want to have a callback a
06:10 - function that's called
06:11 - when it's successfully authenticated
06:13 - probably i would get an error if i had
06:15 - used the wrong token but it's not very
06:17 - helpful to have no message here
06:18 - the way that i implement this is with an
06:20 - event handler and there's actually lots
06:22 - of different kind of events
06:23 - i can handle like i want to handle event
06:25 - when somebody emoji reacts to my message
06:27 - or when a new
06:28 - uh user joins the discord right now i
06:30 - just want to know when i'm ready
06:32 - so i could say client dot on this is to
06:35 - handle
06:35 - any particular event and the event has
06:38 - to have a name and this event this event
06:40 - is called ready
06:40 - and then i want a function that is
06:42 - called when that event happens
06:44 - and i could put an anonymous function in
06:46 - here and that's probably what i should
06:47 - do i could use the arrow syntax
06:49 - i'm going to call that function ready
06:50 - discord
06:52 - and we'll define that function ready
06:56 - discord
06:57 - and i'll just put a console log with a
07:00 - nice little like
07:01 - heart i like to console vlog emojis
07:04 - that's how i debug
07:06 - and so hopefully now if i run this again
07:11 - ah we got the heart so it authenticated
07:13 - successfully and it's ready to go
07:15 - let's go back to the discord server choo
07:18 - choo bot
07:19 - look at that choo choo bot is online
07:23 - right now so choo choo bot is online
07:25 - because it's connected
07:27 - so what's next i mean there's so many
07:29 - things i could have the spot do
07:30 - one thing i should really mention is
07:32 - that this might be a point where you
07:33 - pause
07:34 - and go take a look at a website called
07:36 - discord.js.guide
07:37 - this website has a ton of resources and
07:40 - examples for things you can do
07:41 - and how to do more advanced stuff and
07:44 - all sorts of ideas
07:45 - so there's a lot there i'm gonna just do
07:47 - the most basic basic kind of hello world
07:50 - thing with the bot
07:51 - where if it reads a particular message
07:53 - that i say
07:54 - it responds in a particular way
07:55 - typically the message
07:57 - the example that you'll see here on the
08:00 - um
08:00 - the discord.js website is you say ping i
08:03 - say pong
08:04 - um well i'll do something train themed
08:06 - probably but let's basically do that
08:08 - in order to make that happen i'm going
08:10 - to write another event handler
08:12 - this time the event is message
08:18 - this event will happen anytime anyone
08:21 - sends a message to the discord
08:22 - whatsoever
08:23 - so this is going to happen a lot all the
08:25 - channels all the users
08:26 - like if i were to just write uh
08:29 - console.log
08:30 - message we're gonna see just like crazy
08:33 - stuff happening in the console let's try
08:35 - let's see what happens
08:42 - i'll wait there we go now i've got a
08:45 - message and probably there'll be some
08:46 - more coming along but you see there's
08:48 - tons of metadata associated with all the
08:50 - various uh messages that are being sent
08:53 - reactions and mentions and there's
08:55 - something called a web hook and flags
08:57 - time stamps so much stuff we could begin
09:00 - to work with
09:01 - but i want to be simple about things and
09:04 - i'm going to just look at
09:05 - the message content so let's just say
09:08 - for example
09:09 - if the message content is equal to
09:13 - choo choo i will
09:17 - send a message so message.content is one
09:19 - of the properties in the message object
09:21 - i happen to know that but there's a lot
09:23 - of properties and i'll
09:24 - as i do some more videos with some more
09:26 - functionality you'll see more
09:28 - so i'm just going to check anytime the
09:30 - messages choo choo
09:33 - i'm going to reply with train
09:36 - rainbow sparkly heart all right
09:39 - if you say choo choo exactly case
09:42 - sensitive everything about
09:44 - javascript and string comparison applies
09:46 - here
09:48 - if you say choo choo i will say this
09:49 - back to you let's run this again
09:54 - and i'm going to go over to discord
09:58 - and i'm going to type choo choo
10:01 - yay and here's all these people who are
10:03 - now participating
10:05 - uh by entertyping in choo choo and
10:07 - getting replies from the bot
10:08 - now let's just be sure about this if i
10:10 - type in choo choo with the capital c
10:12 - i'm not going to get a reply and if i go
10:14 - back over here
10:16 - into the console we'll see that the
10:18 - messages are coming through
10:20 - i'm console logging the message content
10:22 - and by the way
10:23 - i'm not just console logging the choo
10:24 - choo the replies are also being console
10:26 - logged
10:27 - one thing you have to be really careful
10:28 - of is if you wrote your code like if i
10:31 - wrote the code
10:32 - like this i commented this out
10:35 - and i just say reply to every message
10:38 - first of all be spamming the server like
10:40 - crazy
10:41 - but also the bot messages itself will
10:44 - trigger message events
10:46 - so if the bot says this the bot then
10:48 - replies to that which then replies to
10:49 - that which then replies
10:50 - i'll be stuck in an infinite loop so you
10:52 - can really wreak havoc on your server
10:54 - by starting to do this but having this
10:56 - protection here
10:58 - is pretty good i want to add before i
10:59 - wrap this video up one additional
11:01 - feature i want to
11:02 - only reply to the message choo choo
11:05 - in that particular channel so if i come
11:08 - back to discord
11:10 - one thing i can do under the bot testing
11:12 - channel is i can right click
11:14 - and i can go all the way down to the
11:16 - bottom here and you can see
11:18 - there's an option for copy id
11:21 - now you won't necessarily see that
11:24 - you're only going to see that
11:26 - is if you have your developer mode
11:28 - enabled in the discord client
11:31 - where you do that is under settings
11:33 - under appearance
11:35 - and then scrolling down under advanced
11:38 - so you can see i have developer mode
11:40 - enabled as soon as you have that enabled
11:42 - i can go back and i can right click and
11:45 - i can get copy id
11:46 - the reason why i want that id is because
11:49 - i'm going to go back to my code
11:51 - and i'm going to also say if message dot
11:55 - channel dot id equals
11:58 - that particular id and let's take out
12:00 - this console log
12:01 - now i'm adding another check only if the
12:05 - message is part of this channel
12:07 - and the contents is choo choo then reply
12:09 - with that reply
12:10 - let's see what happens back to discord
12:14 - and let's mention
12:15 - uh choo choo
12:19 - i've got my reply right there and i'm
12:22 - actually going to go to this other
12:23 - channel called bot talk
12:24 - i don't know what's going on in here ah
12:26 - guess what it's the disstream bot
12:28 - this is one of the bots that maintains
12:31 - and does has a lot of functionality for
12:32 - the coding trained server let me come
12:34 - back to that in a second
12:35 - so you can see another example here and
12:37 - i'm going to go
12:39 - type choo choo here and i do not get a
12:41 - reply
12:42 - because now i have limited the replies
12:44 - only to bot testing
12:46 - i should also mention one thing you
12:48 - notice here is that it's always
12:50 - at mentioning me which is something that
12:52 - you might want
12:53 - but not necessarily what you want so
12:56 - something that i could do
12:57 - in this particular case is i could
12:59 - change the way i'm replying
13:01 - by saying message.channel
13:04 - so a particular channel and then send
13:08 - and then let me just use the same emojis
13:10 - i think this is the code
13:12 - so instead of using the reply function
13:15 - which is a quick
13:16 - way to just immediately reply and at
13:18 - mention the particular
13:20 - person who wrote that message i can just
13:22 - change it to this
13:23 - let me restart the server i'm going to
13:26 - type choo choo
13:28 - and there we go now i just get the emoji
13:30 - reply without
13:32 - the app mentioned just to make this do
13:34 - something
13:35 - slightly more interesting what if i were
13:38 - to create an array
13:41 - called replies and i were to repo
13:44 - put a few different replies in there
13:46 - like this
13:50 - here i now have an array with four
13:51 - different replies maybe what i want to
13:54 - do
13:54 - is pick a random number
13:57 - multiply with this math.random picks a
13:59 - random number between
14:00 - 0 and 1 multiply it by the length of the
14:03 - array
14:04 - and then also make sure that's an
14:08 - integer index to an array so i'm going
14:10 - to add math.floor
14:12 - around that math.floor takes any decimal
14:16 - number like 3.6 and just takes off the
14:18 - decimal
14:19 - makes it 3. so now i can say send
14:22 - replies index r and maybe i want to call
14:25 - this variable index
14:29 - and now what i'm doing is i can see like
14:32 - this is this is what i'm getting to get
14:33 - your creative juices flowing
14:35 - the world is your proverbial oyster your
14:38 - bot oyster right here where you can
14:41 - actually
14:42 - um add any logic you want for how you
14:45 - want to interact with that particular
14:47 - user who wrote that message all right
14:49 - here we go
14:51 - restart the server type choo choo
14:55 - never forget this dot
14:59 - we can see now the different messages
15:01 - come up okay
15:03 - what should you try to do so one thing
15:06 - that you could do and this comes from
15:07 - the coding garden with cj
15:08 - example that i made with cj in a live
15:12 - stream on
15:12 - on his channel um what if you made a
15:15 - magic eight ball bot
15:16 - so if you ask the bot a question the
15:19 - magic 8 ball is an old toy i think from
15:21 - the 80s or so maybe the 90s who knows i
15:23 - definitely had one when i was
15:24 - young you ask it a question you shake it
15:27 - up and it gives you an answer to that
15:28 - question could you make a magic 8-ball
15:30 - bot that answers your questions from
15:33 - a list of of pre-made replies
15:36 - also let's go into bot talk and let's
15:39 - see
15:39 - what some of the features of the bot
15:41 - that's in coding train right now the
15:43 - disk stream bot
15:44 - are so for example i can type
15:46 - exclamation point
15:47 - ping and this is actually pretty good
15:49 - practice for your bot
15:51 - if it's receiving messages to have some
15:53 - kind of set of characters that indicate
15:55 - it's a bot message as opposed to just
15:57 - general chatter
15:58 - so for example if i typed ping like
16:00 - maybe that's not something that i
16:02 - actually want
16:03 - to be communicating with a bot but
16:06 - exclamation point ping
16:07 - will actually give me message back from
16:09 - the bot it will say pong back
16:12 - it will say how long it took um to
16:15 - receive that message
16:16 - and to reply i don't know there's a
16:18 - bunch of metadata here
16:19 - that's going on i can ask for help now
16:22 - i'm getting a list of available commands
16:24 - that i can use with this particular bot
16:26 - let's try
16:27 - uh user info
16:30 - it's telling me about me my name is
16:32 - shiffman i am not playing a game i
16:34 - created my account about a year ago
16:37 - and this person is not a bot i am not a
16:40 - bot
16:42 - can i say user info choo choo bot
16:48 - there we go i'm getting the user info
16:49 - about choo choo bot and it says bleep
16:51 - bleep
16:51 - i am a bot so this is something you
16:53 - could think about as an exercise like
16:55 - how could you make
16:56 - a bot reply with all this kind of
16:58 - information using the discord api
17:00 - um how could you make a magic 8 ball bot
17:02 - what kind of creative ideas do
17:04 - you have so many possibilities and if
17:06 - you want to look at the disk streambot
17:08 - source code and learn more about what
17:09 - this streambot is
17:11 - this is a bot and also a chat manager
17:13 - for
17:14 - streamers it's created by kobe and david
17:15 - two members of the coding train
17:17 - community
17:17 - it has a ton of features and lots of
17:19 - things you could do with live streaming
17:21 - on twitch and with discord and bot
17:22 - i won't get into all that but check out
17:24 - the website so this really wraps up this
17:26 - video
17:27 - um i haven't shown you very much i mean
17:29 - this is an exciting moment if you've
17:31 - gotten all these pieces to work
17:33 - you actually have a bot that listens to
17:35 - messages and sends messages
17:37 - but there are so many things more things
17:38 - that i want to show you honestly i
17:39 - haven't really learned how to do all the
17:41 - things
17:42 - so it might be a little while before the
17:43 - next videos come out but
17:45 - please give me your suggestions or ask
17:47 - your questions about features you'd like
17:49 - to see implemented
17:50 - in the future videos leave those in the
17:52 - comments join the discord community and
17:54 - chat with us there i'd absolutely love
17:56 - to hear about any discord bots you make
17:58 - poetry bots creative art spots weird
18:01 - weird strange useless bots
18:03 - or maybe you've made something very
18:04 - practical or useful that that has a
18:07 - in a particular context um i'd love to
18:09 - just hear about all of the stuff so
18:10 - you could tweet me at shiffman why am i
18:12 - talking about twitter or this is the
18:13 - discord bot series
18:14 - join the disc coding discord um you can
18:17 - share stuff there
18:18 - there's also a webpage associated with
18:20 - this video that has a way of
18:21 - if you if you have documentation or
18:23 - information about your bot online
18:24 - somewhere
18:25 - you can link to it from there um so i'll
18:27 - see you it'll be a little while i'll be
18:28 - wearing a different shirt but in the
18:30 - next videos hopefully
18:31 - more exciting things to come in
18:32 - particular i definitely have to show you
18:34 - how to hide your token
18:35 - but if you want to do that right now um
18:37 - check out my video already about the
18:39 - sort
18:39 - env node package that's what i'm going
18:41 - to use in this series as well all right
18:43 - thanks everybody see you soon make your
18:44 - pot beep beep beep beep bye but sheep
18:54 - goodbye
18:58 - you

Cleaned transcript:

oh dear i gotta get that other whistle back hello welcome back this is the third video oh we're getting to the good stuff in my how to make a discord bot series uh at this point by the end of this video i want my bot to say hello back to me say hello back to me bot please talk to me i'm lonely um and so that's going to happen by the end of this video so hopefully if you've come through the first two you've already created your own discord client application and bought and also you hopefully have terminal access to your computer with node installed so if you don't have those go back to the previous videos or look for the video descriptions for those steps that you need to follow but if you've got all that you're ready to go so i want to write some code i'm going to create a node application what is what do i mean by node application so typically in a lot of my other videos i've used node to write a web server to host a website or to maybe actually communicate with twitter in a twitter bot series so i tend to use node as a kind of catchall javascript programming environment as a glue that connects different projects so maybe i want to talk to an api i want to set up a web server most of my videos are just using p5.js which is all clientside code that operates in the web browser this code that i'm going to write in my text editor and run from my console is just running locally here on this computer and it's running because i'm typing in commands to tell it to run and eventually we'll get to how we might deploy it somewhere else later but that's really the way i'm using node it's a programming environment to write my own software that runs on this computer it just so happens that the software has no interface whatsoever so i happen to have a folder on my computer called choo choo bot it's completely empty my console is now pointed at that folder and i can say pwd to confirm it's on the desktop of the coding train user choo choo bot and if i have node installed in order to start my node project the first thing i want to type is npm init so npm is node package manager it is a part of node and it allows you to manage your packages that makes sense now right but basically this is the command for i want to start a node project um so if i run that it's going to give me some prompts to say like oh why don't you tell me some stuff about this project like its name and its license and the author of it and you should be thoughtful and you can even set up some like settings on your computer to have it auto fill with key information but just to move through this kind of quickly right now i'm just gonna hit enter and i'm gonna say okay so all the defaults are now there uh and entered in for this project and if i go back to the folder i'll see that oh look at that i have a package.json file that is the configuration file for this particular project let's take a look at that file and to do that i can open up this folder in my text editor visual studio code i'm in code i go to file open and i select choo choo bot hit open let's look at package.json and there it is i also need to create now another file in package.json it says the main script that's part of this program the spot is index.js so of course i could name this anything i want and just to make that point let me change this to bot.js and then i'm going to create a new file called bot.js and i'm just going to say console.log beep beep and now i've got index.js package.json and if i go back to my console and i run the command node bot.js this is me running the code that's in bot.js beep beep now for this project i want to make use of something called discord.js discord.js is a node module that allows you to interact with the discord api very easily and that's exactly what i want and i've got the command right here to get going with it npm install discord.js i can type that command here this is going to add that module to my project i can go back and check package.json and you'll see right here it is now one of the dependencies so i have access to using the discord.js node module in my project now amazingly i have a full example right here i could just copy base this whole all of this code and i'm basically done with the bot already but i kind of want to work on it uh piece by piece um so i'll bring in these these elements uh one at a time but let me at least start by just copy pasting these first two lines of code which are a little hard for me to just sort of memorize the require function is a function that essentially imports the discord.js module and then i want to create a client the client is the object the javascript object that connects to the discord api itself to manage to run the bot but i need to very specifically authenticate with the discord api with that particular bot so this is now where i need to say client.login and this is where i need to put my bot token so i would say generally speaking it's a pretty bad idea to just hard code your bot token right into your code ultimately i'm going to want to like keep that in a separate configuration file a dot env file is something that i've used before and i have other video tutorials about that i'll come back and do that with this project but just to get it working and if you're following along just for testing i'm just going to paste my token right in there and of course by the time you're watching this i'll have regenerated my token so that won't be the valid one that you that you so you know so that nobody could watch this video and take over my bot so i'm back on the discord developer portal in my application on the bot page and i can click copy to get my token and then i can paste it right here and let's run this again well it's just sitting there how do i know if it worked so probably i want to have a callback a function that's called when it's successfully authenticated probably i would get an error if i had used the wrong token but it's not very helpful to have no message here the way that i implement this is with an event handler and there's actually lots of different kind of events i can handle like i want to handle event when somebody emoji reacts to my message or when a new uh user joins the discord right now i just want to know when i'm ready so i could say client dot on this is to handle any particular event and the event has to have a name and this event this event is called ready and then i want a function that is called when that event happens and i could put an anonymous function in here and that's probably what i should do i could use the arrow syntax i'm going to call that function ready discord and we'll define that function ready discord and i'll just put a console log with a nice little like heart i like to console vlog emojis that's how i debug and so hopefully now if i run this again ah we got the heart so it authenticated successfully and it's ready to go let's go back to the discord server choo choo bot look at that choo choo bot is online right now so choo choo bot is online because it's connected so what's next i mean there's so many things i could have the spot do one thing i should really mention is that this might be a point where you pause and go take a look at a website called discord.js.guide this website has a ton of resources and examples for things you can do and how to do more advanced stuff and all sorts of ideas so there's a lot there i'm gonna just do the most basic basic kind of hello world thing with the bot where if it reads a particular message that i say it responds in a particular way typically the message the example that you'll see here on the um the discord.js website is you say ping i say pong um well i'll do something train themed probably but let's basically do that in order to make that happen i'm going to write another event handler this time the event is message this event will happen anytime anyone sends a message to the discord whatsoever so this is going to happen a lot all the channels all the users like if i were to just write uh console.log message we're gonna see just like crazy stuff happening in the console let's try let's see what happens i'll wait there we go now i've got a message and probably there'll be some more coming along but you see there's tons of metadata associated with all the various uh messages that are being sent reactions and mentions and there's something called a web hook and flags time stamps so much stuff we could begin to work with but i want to be simple about things and i'm going to just look at the message content so let's just say for example if the message content is equal to choo choo i will send a message so message.content is one of the properties in the message object i happen to know that but there's a lot of properties and i'll as i do some more videos with some more functionality you'll see more so i'm just going to check anytime the messages choo choo i'm going to reply with train rainbow sparkly heart all right if you say choo choo exactly case sensitive everything about javascript and string comparison applies here if you say choo choo i will say this back to you let's run this again and i'm going to go over to discord and i'm going to type choo choo yay and here's all these people who are now participating uh by entertyping in choo choo and getting replies from the bot now let's just be sure about this if i type in choo choo with the capital c i'm not going to get a reply and if i go back over here into the console we'll see that the messages are coming through i'm console logging the message content and by the way i'm not just console logging the choo choo the replies are also being console logged one thing you have to be really careful of is if you wrote your code like if i wrote the code like this i commented this out and i just say reply to every message first of all be spamming the server like crazy but also the bot messages itself will trigger message events so if the bot says this the bot then replies to that which then replies to that which then replies i'll be stuck in an infinite loop so you can really wreak havoc on your server by starting to do this but having this protection here is pretty good i want to add before i wrap this video up one additional feature i want to only reply to the message choo choo in that particular channel so if i come back to discord one thing i can do under the bot testing channel is i can right click and i can go all the way down to the bottom here and you can see there's an option for copy id now you won't necessarily see that you're only going to see that is if you have your developer mode enabled in the discord client where you do that is under settings under appearance and then scrolling down under advanced so you can see i have developer mode enabled as soon as you have that enabled i can go back and i can right click and i can get copy id the reason why i want that id is because i'm going to go back to my code and i'm going to also say if message dot channel dot id equals that particular id and let's take out this console log now i'm adding another check only if the message is part of this channel and the contents is choo choo then reply with that reply let's see what happens back to discord and let's mention uh choo choo i've got my reply right there and i'm actually going to go to this other channel called bot talk i don't know what's going on in here ah guess what it's the disstream bot this is one of the bots that maintains and does has a lot of functionality for the coding trained server let me come back to that in a second so you can see another example here and i'm going to go type choo choo here and i do not get a reply because now i have limited the replies only to bot testing i should also mention one thing you notice here is that it's always at mentioning me which is something that you might want but not necessarily what you want so something that i could do in this particular case is i could change the way i'm replying by saying message.channel so a particular channel and then send and then let me just use the same emojis i think this is the code so instead of using the reply function which is a quick way to just immediately reply and at mention the particular person who wrote that message i can just change it to this let me restart the server i'm going to type choo choo and there we go now i just get the emoji reply without the app mentioned just to make this do something slightly more interesting what if i were to create an array called replies and i were to repo put a few different replies in there like this here i now have an array with four different replies maybe what i want to do is pick a random number multiply with this math.random picks a random number between 0 and 1 multiply it by the length of the array and then also make sure that's an integer index to an array so i'm going to add math.floor around that math.floor takes any decimal number like 3.6 and just takes off the decimal makes it 3. so now i can say send replies index r and maybe i want to call this variable index and now what i'm doing is i can see like this is this is what i'm getting to get your creative juices flowing the world is your proverbial oyster your bot oyster right here where you can actually um add any logic you want for how you want to interact with that particular user who wrote that message all right here we go restart the server type choo choo never forget this dot we can see now the different messages come up okay what should you try to do so one thing that you could do and this comes from the coding garden with cj example that i made with cj in a live stream on on his channel um what if you made a magic eight ball bot so if you ask the bot a question the magic 8 ball is an old toy i think from the 80s or so maybe the 90s who knows i definitely had one when i was young you ask it a question you shake it up and it gives you an answer to that question could you make a magic 8ball bot that answers your questions from a list of of premade replies also let's go into bot talk and let's see what some of the features of the bot that's in coding train right now the disk stream bot are so for example i can type exclamation point ping and this is actually pretty good practice for your bot if it's receiving messages to have some kind of set of characters that indicate it's a bot message as opposed to just general chatter so for example if i typed ping like maybe that's not something that i actually want to be communicating with a bot but exclamation point ping will actually give me message back from the bot it will say pong back it will say how long it took um to receive that message and to reply i don't know there's a bunch of metadata here that's going on i can ask for help now i'm getting a list of available commands that i can use with this particular bot let's try uh user info it's telling me about me my name is shiffman i am not playing a game i created my account about a year ago and this person is not a bot i am not a bot can i say user info choo choo bot there we go i'm getting the user info about choo choo bot and it says bleep bleep i am a bot so this is something you could think about as an exercise like how could you make a bot reply with all this kind of information using the discord api um how could you make a magic 8 ball bot what kind of creative ideas do you have so many possibilities and if you want to look at the disk streambot source code and learn more about what this streambot is this is a bot and also a chat manager for streamers it's created by kobe and david two members of the coding train community it has a ton of features and lots of things you could do with live streaming on twitch and with discord and bot i won't get into all that but check out the website so this really wraps up this video um i haven't shown you very much i mean this is an exciting moment if you've gotten all these pieces to work you actually have a bot that listens to messages and sends messages but there are so many things more things that i want to show you honestly i haven't really learned how to do all the things so it might be a little while before the next videos come out but please give me your suggestions or ask your questions about features you'd like to see implemented in the future videos leave those in the comments join the discord community and chat with us there i'd absolutely love to hear about any discord bots you make poetry bots creative art spots weird weird strange useless bots or maybe you've made something very practical or useful that that has a in a particular context um i'd love to just hear about all of the stuff so you could tweet me at shiffman why am i talking about twitter or this is the discord bot series join the disc coding discord um you can share stuff there there's also a webpage associated with this video that has a way of if you if you have documentation or information about your bot online somewhere you can link to it from there um so i'll see you it'll be a little while i'll be wearing a different shirt but in the next videos hopefully more exciting things to come in particular i definitely have to show you how to hide your token but if you want to do that right now um check out my video already about the sort env node package that's what i'm going to use in this series as well all right thanks everybody see you soon make your pot beep beep beep beep bye but sheep goodbye you
