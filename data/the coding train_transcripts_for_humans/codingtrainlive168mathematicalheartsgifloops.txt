00:08 - hello my stream oh yes I am
00:21 - [Music]
00:28 - attracts me like no other function I
00:37 - can't I can't get anything right
00:49 - [Music]
01:05 - I don't want to stop coding now this
01:23 - song is dedicated to processing my first
01:28 - love my true huh happy February
01:32 - 13th one of my favorite days of the year
01:35 - I did you hear that rattle at least the
01:44 - ukulele it has a weird rattle and so me
01:48 - being the mechanically minded person
01:50 - that I am I'm very mechanically you know
01:53 - really good with tools and building and
01:55 - putting things together that's sarcasm
01:58 - you hear my voice
02:00 - I found this screwdriver and I tried
02:04 - tightening all these different screws
02:05 - that I found all over this thing but I
02:07 - don't know still rattles so if anybody
02:15 - wants to submit other love ODEs to
02:18 - processing or maybe to p5.js or other
02:22 - types of programming things I will sync
02:26 - those later on today's heart themed
02:30 - coding training episode alright so
02:38 - welcome good morning my name is Dan
02:40 - and Buster the Kotick train this is a
02:43 - live YouTube stream that now happens
02:45 - every Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. Eastern
02:48 - believe that I have an actual regularly
02:50 - scheduled time so all of you been asking
02:53 - just come here next week at this exact
02:56 - time and I will be here except for when
02:58 - I cancel or something happens there's
03:00 - like a snowstorm or a mistake or like
03:02 - beating came up that day that day
03:06 - hopefully no I haven't I can't bring
03:09 - myself to actually put on the top on the
03:12 - YouTube banner like every went live
03:14 - every Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. because
03:16 - I'm afraid that will jinx myself but
03:19 - that's what that's my plan so yeah
03:25 - people are eric is asking shouldn't the
03:27 - yellow colors fade to blue as time goes
03:29 - on Oh
03:31 - alexandros I think hey it's probably
03:33 - from the nut or the action you should
03:36 - check the trust rod I have no idea what
03:38 - any of that stuff is I hope you're not
03:40 - that's not like but that probably has to
03:43 - do with parts of the ukulele so yes so
03:49 - this is a this is the result of the
03:52 - coding challenge that I did last week
03:54 - and I don't remember where what the
03:57 - settings here are somewhat arbitrary in
03:59 - terms of the fading and let me in terms
04:05 - of some of these values let me run this
04:07 - again so I kind of wanted to continue
04:11 - with this this week but I don't know
04:14 - things didn't go well for me in the last
04:16 - week after putting this code together
04:19 - but I do want to talk about how I still
04:21 - want to do some follow up videos about
04:23 - that so let me begin by talking a little
04:26 - bit about fluid simulation and where my
04:30 - head is at with that so I want to want
04:32 - to talk about a few things so this is
04:34 - what you're seeing here is the result of
04:36 - me porting code from my cache it's a
04:40 - blog post called fluid dynamics or fluid
04:43 - simulation or something like that for
04:44 - dummies that code that blog post was
04:48 - written based on the seminal paper from
04:51 - 2003 I think real-time fluid
04:54 - Amyx for games from by jos stam and so
04:58 - this is like kind of a 15th generation
05:01 - version of that in processing and it
05:04 - works in this nice way to create this
05:07 - fluid like feeling I mean feels looks
05:09 - the visual appearance here is much more
05:11 - like smoke but with changing the way you
05:15 - render the design changing with various
05:17 - parameters of the design you could
05:19 - probably create a variety of different
05:21 - kinds of fluid like simulations however
05:23 - this is not many people have gone before
05:27 - me to create versions of this in more
05:29 - thoughtful and sophisticated ways so my
05:31 - original plan was just to port the code
05:33 - which I did the next step I was going to
05:36 - try to refactor the code and I started
05:39 - working on that a little bit I want to
05:40 - show you where I got to because maybe
05:42 - some of you might have some suggestions
05:44 - so I'm gonna go to github.com slash
05:47 - Schiffman slash CFD the CFD stands for
05:51 - computational fluid dynamics and these
05:54 - were some like these were some like test
05:57 - bits of code that I put together before
05:59 - I did the actual live stream if you want
06:01 - to find the actual code from the live
06:03 - stream you can just go to here you will
06:06 - see the video here this is on the coding
06:08 - training comm this link will take you
06:10 - ups this link will take you to the code
06:12 - and then one person who this is exciting
06:15 - we have one community contribution so
06:17 - let's take a look at this community
06:18 - contribution really quickly from Juan
06:20 - Carlos Punk's Campuzano flow around
06:23 - circle incompressible non viscous fluid
06:26 - I love this so this looks like it is a
06:31 - particle based fluid simulation which is
06:33 - really where I want to get to with all
06:35 - this stuff and you can see the path of
06:38 - these dots kind of moving around this
06:40 - circle can I move that circle I can move
06:42 - the circle that's kind of cool
06:45 - I might suggest it sort of surprised me
06:47 - that it went the color of the background
06:49 - when I clicked it so I might if I were
06:51 - giving my quick off-the-cuff feedback
06:53 - here I might consider a different color
06:55 - change or when I click and drag but I
06:58 - can let's try let's click on trace so
07:01 - that's cool so we can see the trails of
07:03 - these particles let's click on speed oh
07:05 - it says drag circle right there
07:07 - what does radius do Oh
07:08 - that makes the radius of this
07:09 - interesting only much smaller so let's
07:11 - make that big let me drag it around cool
07:14 - so that's great so I'd be curious to
07:16 - look and III would want I would love
07:18 - some documentation here about and I
07:21 - wonder it's probably in the source code
07:22 - if I click here some documentation about
07:25 - what what what algorithms led you to
07:28 - this particular simulation or did you
07:30 - invent them yourself or what was the
07:32 - sort of technique employed here that's
07:34 - terrific
07:36 - okay so but where I was getting to is
07:40 - over here I started refactoring the code
07:43 - and if we look at my code from last week
07:45 - which is just again a port of other
07:47 - people's code what you'll see is that we
07:54 - go here to the fluid class what you'll
07:55 - see is all of the data that's part of
07:59 - this fluid simulation is a set of six
08:03 - different individual arrays there is a
08:06 - velocity vector associated with each
08:09 - spot on the canvas each spot on that
08:13 - grid of pixels and that velocity vector
08:17 - is described by an X and a y this zero
08:21 - notate the sort of previous velocity
08:23 - vector so we always need to know
08:24 - historically what was the velocity
08:26 - before this moment in time and this is
08:29 - very common a lot of different cellular
08:31 - automata algorithms that involve data on
08:33 - a grid and then also there's this idea
08:37 - of density which which I might think
08:39 - about renaming to die because it's the
08:41 - amount of dye at any spot in the fluid
08:44 - and that's how we end up visualizing
08:46 - whether we're using we've mapped that
08:48 - amount of dye to a hue or to a
08:50 - brightness value and then s is the
08:52 - previous amount of dye so I had this
08:54 - idea that let me let me and I was gonna
08:57 - do this live but I thought I would just
08:59 - try the first steps of it which you can
09:01 - see here and I am this is my fluid
09:04 - refactor and if I go here I had this
09:05 - idea okay
09:06 - well what if I had like this idea of a
09:10 - velocity object and it was actually a P
09:12 - vector object and the velocity object
09:14 - knew a current velocity in a previous
09:16 - velocity so a I'm just like trying to
09:17 - get some new variable
09:19 - aiming to make the code a bit more
09:20 - readable but also if and then if I had a
09:23 - dye object which would just be a scalar
09:25 - so the velocity object is a vector the
09:27 - dye object-- is a scalar and then this
09:30 - would allow me to have the fluid class
09:32 - have just these two arrays like the
09:34 - array of velocities in the array of dyes
09:36 - and then I could start the code would
09:39 - sort of like simplify into like this I
09:41 - kept going down this road and this is
09:43 - this doesn't work but then this is my
09:44 - idea oh then I could apply the different
09:47 - steps of this particular simulation
09:49 - diffusion projection diffuse project
09:52 - Advent and I would diffuse and project
09:54 - the velocity and add back to project the
09:56 - velocity and diffuse and add back the
09:58 - density and then I started realizing the
10:01 - whole way the code is written if we go
10:05 - into those functions that perform these
10:08 - operations is to operate off of a single
10:11 - generic array so I guess I could
10:14 - overload the fun of two different
10:15 - versions of each functions whether
10:17 - they're getting a vector or an array
10:18 - then I started to get lost and I was
10:20 - like I don't know the best way to do
10:21 - this and that was like late at night
10:24 - last videos but I got the live stream
10:26 - about this tomorrow morning so I you
10:29 - know I rather than take up all of
10:31 - today's live stream trying to refactor
10:34 - this code what I'm asking for you is
10:36 - your suggestion so if you're watching
10:38 - this right now and I want to think about
10:40 - this have some ideas for me let me know
10:42 - let me know because my goal is to
10:44 - refactor it in a way that's more
10:46 - readable maybe turn it into a library
10:47 - maybe ported the JavaScript maybe
10:49 - optimize it there's lots of
10:50 - possibilities here but then I was sort
10:52 - of thinking what am I doing here am I
10:55 - really the person in the world who's
10:56 - going to invent a new fluid simulation
10:59 - like library and algorithm and organize
11:01 - it I mean probably not to me maybe and
11:04 - certainly with the help that I've found
11:06 - with this wonderful internet community
11:07 - of people who watch this channel I'm
11:08 - sure there are lots lots of people
11:10 - watching who really could thoughtfully
11:12 - contribute this idea but there are many
11:16 - other there are this is not a new idea
11:19 - and in fact researching this a bit more
11:21 - I found another library called pixel
11:24 - flow it's last commit was pretty recent
11:28 - so that does it oh no that's not pretty
11:30 - that's a year ago last commit was a year
11:32 - ago but you can see it has a lot of
11:35 - functionality for this these ideas and
11:39 - if you you can download and I actually
11:41 - ran some these examples which are quite
11:43 - oh here we go
11:44 - which you can see are quite exciting and
11:47 - amazing so this is an interesting
11:49 - possibility for me to look into actually
11:52 - just using a library where all of this
11:54 - has already been sort of refactored and
11:56 - reorganized in a way that makes it
11:58 - useful for for like making the projects
12:01 - there is also MSA fluid which is a
12:05 - library that I used many years ago which
12:08 - is the exact same algorithm that I
12:11 - implemented but thoughtfully packaged
12:13 - into a library but not currently
12:16 - compatible with processing 3 I quickly
12:18 - checked I think this would require a
12:20 - small amount of work work that I could
12:22 - actually to to update it to work with
12:24 - processing 3 more easily so that's a
12:26 - possibility but the I've been in touch a
12:29 - little bit with Gabriel Y mouth let me
12:32 - find Gabriel y mouth on Twitter
12:35 - Gabriel y mouth is a researcher
12:38 - specifically in fluid structure
12:40 - interactions and based in the UK this is
12:43 - the website and Gabriel y mouth has
12:45 - created something called a lilypad
12:49 - processing which is and and let me just
12:54 - download this I'm gonna let's let's take
12:57 - a moment because this will actually just
12:58 - run right off the bat so I want to show
13:00 - this to you because this is really
13:01 - really phenomenal and why why why is my
13:05 - zsh broken let me actually go to the
13:09 - desktop and let me clone this repo real
13:12 - quick let me open here and let me open
13:22 - this up in processing i'm gonna go to
13:24 - lily pad lily pad and i'm gonna run this
13:30 - so look at this let me zoom into this
13:34 - here we can see we've got a really
13:36 - excellent and more dynamic and probably
13:40 - accurate fluid fluid simulation
13:43 - and there's so much there's so much to
13:45 - this like this this quick demo this is
13:48 - like scratching the surface of what this
13:51 - example I don't know what to call it
13:52 - example demo open source code project
13:55 - does but to me and and there's and it's
13:59 - really well organized thoughtfully in an
14:02 - object-oriented fashion but for for me
14:07 - to use it and to like there's just like
14:12 - so much going on here and is probably
14:16 - fairly well documented here
14:18 - documentation on the solver guides are
14:20 - contributing the project simple
14:22 - instructions there's lots of
14:23 - documentation here but what I think
14:25 - might be useful would be to turn this
14:27 - into a processing library and by that I
14:30 - mean something that I can do actually
14:32 - just through here import library add
14:34 - library for example if I look for a
14:37 - pixel flow is it here yeah pixel flow is
14:39 - right here so I'm gonna I'm gonna find
14:42 - pixel flow in the libraries I'm gonna
14:44 - hit install I'm gonna install it and
14:47 - then let me go find one of the pixel
14:49 - flow examples so I can go over to
14:51 - examples and I can go to contributed
14:55 - libraries and go to pixel flow so we can
14:59 - pick any of these let's just try fluid
15:01 - 2d fluid basic and then we can run this
15:04 - and ah so look at this the package
15:10 - control p5 doesn't exist which means
15:12 - this is dependent on another library let
15:15 - me quit this these by the way because
15:17 - they're so sketch import library add
15:20 - library I'm gonna add control p5 which
15:25 - is an interface library which it's much
15:30 - harder to do interface elements in an
15:33 - elegant and flexible way and processing
15:36 - in p5.js because you're in the browser
15:39 - being able to manipulate text boxes and
15:41 - buttons and sliders and and and and
15:43 - create an interface there's so many more
15:45 - possibilities given the rich set of
15:47 - features that a browser affords okay so
15:49 - let me now try running this again so
15:54 - there we go okay so we can see this
15:56 - is a similar idea of yet another fluid
15:59 - simulation example so so this is where
16:04 - I'm struggling with how to how to move
16:08 - forward first of all I got a lot of
16:09 - stuff a fluid simulation I'm so
16:13 - fascinated by it I want to oh I want to
16:18 - but
16:20 - so one path which of my original path
16:23 - was to kind of refactor my code make it
16:25 - a little bit try to understand how the
16:27 - algorithms work a little bit more and
16:28 - explain those things that will take some
16:30 - time and research on my part which is a
16:33 - little atypical for how I do things
16:35 - which is more fly by the seat of my
16:38 - pants so that's one possibility the
16:43 - other possibility would be to leave that
16:44 - fluid video alone and go straight to
16:48 - using a library whether it's pixel flow
16:51 - NS a fluid or lily pad all three so
16:55 - that's what I'm looking for thoughts and
16:56 - suggestions about but I'm going to leave
16:59 - that now I'm I'm like looking over here
17:04 - and I'm seeing some would say he is not
17:05 - looking at chat question mark so no I am
17:10 - not looking at jack except for every
17:12 - once in a while when I to look at the
17:14 - chat okay so I want to put that aside
17:17 - and today I want to focus on the heart
17:24 - let me quit this
17:34 - okay wait oh let's also go and go to the
17:48 - DVD logo challenge since there were
17:50 - several community contributions let's
17:54 - take a look at some of these so let's
17:56 - look first at bouncing DVD logo by Bruno
18:00 - in 3d that's pretty great that's pretty
18:05 - awesome thank you for submitting that
18:07 - let's look at verlet DVD logo by Anurag
18:14 - this is cool so look so add rope there
18:18 - we go so now these are looks like on
18:20 - Iraq who created this actually made an
18:23 - entire verlan physics library Berlet J
18:25 - yes I typically have used toxic lips yes
18:27 - for my veux lip physics that's really
18:30 - cool to see the thing about alternative
18:32 - physics for this DVD video bouncing 90s
18:34 - screensaver look beautiful let's see
18:42 - what else do we got here
18:44 - bouncing DVD with corner detection and
18:46 - more oh look at this I love this
18:51 - so it's counting the number of
18:52 - collisions the number of corners the
18:55 - corner threshold I guess is like how
18:57 - close does it have to be the size is the
19:00 - size of the logo the speed let's make it
19:02 - go fast all right come on everyone
19:10 - ah would hit the corner I missed it
19:14 - [Music]
19:18 - and then changeable speed track and hit
19:21 - the corner detection by temporary pride
19:23 - I like this press T to enable/disable
19:30 - the track of the logo cool scroll the
19:34 - mouse wheel to speed oh I love that I
19:36 - can scroll the mouse wheel which speeds
19:39 - it up or slows it down and background
19:42 - switches if the logo hits the corner
19:44 - logo color switches if the logo hits the
19:46 - edge ah so we know if it hits the corner
19:48 - I'd at the corner if the logo at the
19:52 - edge wonderful okay so thanks for those
19:55 - I'm really trying to spend more time
19:57 - keeping this site up and so each coding
20:03 - challenge has a card first of all thank
20:06 - you to all the people who have
20:08 - contributed to this website this is not
20:10 - a project I made or designed it myself
20:12 - this is a community developed project
20:15 - let me just go to github here and click
20:17 - on contributors and I you know rather
20:21 - than rather than name people I can like
20:23 - just sort of scroll here and we can see
20:24 - a lot of people who have contributed to
20:25 - this website so there's actually another
20:28 - project which is a sort of like coding
20:30 - train website 2.0 that's on the horizon
20:33 - but what I my goal is to really have a
20:36 - place for the community to be able to
20:38 - share work that they're doing and for me
20:40 - to also make sure I'm crediting all the
20:43 - different sources and things that I use
20:44 - so for each and YouTube description
20:47 - works and the playlists work to some
20:49 - extent but this is basically each
20:51 - challenge has a card if I go here I'm
20:53 - gonna go to the DVD logo one or actual
20:55 - let me just go to this Fourier transform
20:56 - one so if I go to the challenge this is
20:59 - the video obviously but you can see
21:02 - here's the code there will be on the my
21:04 - goal is to have p5.js web editor and
21:06 - processing code for each challenge and I
21:08 - know that David Schneider a viewer has
21:10 - made a processing version of this so
21:12 - hopefully that'll get up on the site
21:13 - soon you can download the code see it
21:14 - live I might need it I don't know if
21:16 - that's the right terminology but that
21:19 - will just I'll give you a link to the
21:21 - actual demo run
21:22 - in the browser and then various other
21:24 - things that are related to the video are
21:26 - discussed here and this is the important
21:28 - part that I wanted to highlight this is
21:30 - where you can submit your own version so
21:32 - right now there's no kind of elegant you
21:37 - know web form type thing this is all has
21:40 - to be done through a pull request which
21:42 - can be somewhat daunting and a little
21:44 - confusing how to do that but there are
21:47 - these links will take you to
21:48 - instructions on how to do that and don't
21:50 - be afraid come we are welcoming and
21:52 - friendly in the coding train github
21:57 - repository if you've made something and
21:58 - you have no idea how it's a minute open
22:00 - up an issue say you need help try a pull
22:03 - request don't worry if you get it
22:04 - doesn't work it breaks there's a bug
22:06 - just give it a try I hear this from so
22:08 - many people
22:09 - oh I'm no good at that github thing I
22:11 - wish I could contribute something
22:12 - sometimes you just have to get over that
22:14 - first hurdle and you need people to be
22:16 - there helping you get over that hurdle
22:17 - and so Cody Drake there are lots of
22:20 - other places that our wonderful
22:22 - community is open-source communities
22:24 - helping people to get started
22:25 - contributing I hope that coding train
22:27 - can be one of those so it's just my
22:29 - little pitch to encourage you to
22:31 - contribute okay I'm not using a timer
22:37 - today I will use my Bell live demo yeah
22:46 - live demo probably would make more sense
22:48 - mark sheriff writes in the chat that is
22:51 - a good question on you are been asked do
22:54 - these live streams get saved in the
22:56 - channel yes so let me take you to the
23:00 - coding train on YouTube you can see here
23:04 - that I'm live streaming now if you go
23:05 - back I'm just gonna go to uploads this
23:09 - is everything that's on the Chola I'm
23:11 - logged in and you're seeing my unlisted
23:12 - videos here we switch accounts just for
23:17 - a second I meant to be on oh I don't
23:21 - know
23:22 - everything is all messed up all my
23:23 - accounts and everything are now being
23:25 - shown things are coming up unlisted
23:30 - videos
23:32 - view as okay wait now I'm gonna get ads
23:41 - okay fail to the first fail of today
23:45 - alright here's my chairs my videos this
23:48 - is what you would get if you were not
23:50 - logged in to YouTube and you would see
23:53 - all these different videos what I'm
23:56 - looking for is yes so these are
23:58 - typically what the live streams look
24:00 - like this is live stream number 100 the
24:03 - last one what we're a little bit behind
24:05 - so you can see these are some recent
24:06 - live streams that haven't that don't
24:08 - have like a thumbnail and and a title
24:10 - with a number on them so a little bit
24:11 - behind at that but the live streams
24:13 - usually get numbered and then everything
24:16 - else on the channel is mostly redundant
24:18 - content edited out of the live streams
24:20 - so as always anybody has a suggestion
24:23 - for how I could organize this stuff
24:25 - better you know a lot some people on
24:26 - YouTube have separate channels one for
24:28 - live-streaming one for uploaded content
24:30 - I'm just kind of doing everything all in
24:31 - one channel it's in one place anyway
24:36 - there I'm joking there's nothing there
24:37 - particularly private I will just mention
24:39 - that I make I have some videos that are
24:41 - for a course that I teach at NYU that
24:44 - are unlisted because they're
24:45 - specifically only for that course but
24:46 - they're there just add administrative
24:48 - videos my sort of technique for the way
24:50 - that I do it is when I have content
24:51 - videos for a course I have those public
24:53 - on YouTube okay okay what am I trying to
25:02 - do right so what am i doing today what
25:10 - am i doing today ah so I want to let me
25:13 - pull up the oh my goodness Simon Wow
25:20 - so first let me talk about Simon Simon
25:23 - is a viewer of the coding train I'm
25:25 - gonna do Simon Tiger let me go back to
25:28 - me logged in I'm a search for Simon
25:32 - Tiger and we're gonna get Simon's
25:35 - YouTube channel and we're gonna click
25:37 - over here - Simon speaking of processing
25:39 - Community Day and I'm gonna click over
25:42 - here and then go to Mythology hard
25:44 - of mathematics this particular video
25:49 - then I'm going to close this close this
25:53 - and close this so this is a very famous
26:00 - pattern in mathematics called the
26:02 - cardioid there is a video on the
26:05 - mythology YouTube channel which is a
26:07 - fantastic use of do Tube channel about
26:09 - mathematics about using x tables to to
26:14 - visualize this cardioid shape the
26:16 - cardioid shape appears in the Mandelbrot
26:18 - said it appears in diagrams of kind of
26:21 - like patterns there's a an explanation
26:23 - in this video of how you can see the
26:26 - cardioid pattern and I in the top of a
26:29 - coffee cup based on like the way the
26:31 - light bounces off of it and reflects off
26:33 - the coffee all sorts of fascinating
26:34 - stuff here Simon
26:36 - creates Ivan created a created a poster
26:41 - I have which I have downstairs hanging
26:42 - in my office I sure brought it up here
26:44 - to show you visualizing all of the times
26:47 - tables in in-processing inspired by this
26:50 - particular video and this is Simon
26:54 - giving a presentation about it at
26:55 - processing community de Amsterdam so
26:59 - these are my two inspirations I think
27:01 - vihart also has some videos about the
27:05 - cardioid and about general and generally
27:08 - speaking vihart has amazing wonderful
27:12 - one mind filling soul beautifying videos
27:18 - about mathematics and different types of
27:21 - things so I encourage you to check out
27:23 - the work of thy heart if you don't
27:27 - already I never look at the chat so slow
27:37 - mode is not again not on again I know
27:40 - why I'm forgetting to not put slow mode
27:41 - on in the chat oh well we'll see if I
27:44 - need to
27:45 - we'll see if I need to we'll see if I
27:48 - need to pull this car over kids
27:54 - well of the car over so I would like to
27:57 - do this and so in honor of I'm trying to
28:02 - avoid saying Valentine's Day by just to
28:04 - say Valentine's Day once in honor of
28:06 - tomorrow I would like to make a heart I
28:09 - would like to express my love for
28:11 - processing and we're gonna do that here
28:14 - by visualizing the times tables and get
28:17 - this pattern and I there's a I would
28:19 - like to recreate the animation I'll just
28:21 - click over to it I'm gonna I'm gonna let
28:28 - this play
28:30 - this is masala Jers content not mine a
28:32 - mythology are here I probably just gonna
28:35 - let it play for a few seconds so I'm
28:37 - gonna try to kind of recreate this
28:38 - animation I'm gonna stop it now because
28:40 - I want to be careful about repurposing
28:42 - other content encourage you to go check
28:44 - out the mythology video um but I want to
28:46 - see if I can create my own version of
28:47 - this animation ok we refresh this page
28:52 - refresh this page there we go
28:57 - cardioid there are lots of techniques
29:00 - for creating the cardioid shape this
29:04 - being the most common this is super
29:06 - related to the epicycles video I
29:08 - recently did I don't know if it makes
29:11 - sense for me to make a video just
29:12 - programming this way of generating it
29:14 - but it's useful to see that and then I
29:19 - could also get where's my Mandelbrot set
29:21 - challenge and have that ready to go
29:27 - let's see here here we go let's grab the
29:34 - processing code so what I want see you
29:39 - live let's do that so a little long
29:45 - let's grab the processing code and see
29:52 - what happens here
29:57 - because why would I avoid Valentine's
30:02 - Day the reason I would avoid valentines
30:03 - day because it's a fake holiday to just
30:06 - excuse corporation to sell greeting
30:08 - cards loves is a real thing
30:11 - I embrace hearts and puppies and
30:14 - rainbows and all of those things but not
30:15 - this candy scum rock commerce nonsense
30:23 - it's my okay let's take a look at this
30:28 - alright so in processing I should be
30:31 - able to make this let's try to make this
30:33 - 1280 960 yeah so there you can see the
30:40 - cardioid shape right here and then of
30:43 - course what it's been another half an
30:45 - hour
30:45 - geez Louise got started doing something
30:51 - get my ukulele out again okay why is
30:58 - this let's just do this okay this this I
31:17 - have this I have this okay
31:30 - what's interest what's here what's what
31:33 - machine what is what is machine learning
31:34 - think I should watch next interesting
31:36 - fascinating okay alright so this is
31:46 - legitimately sometimes it's not
31:49 - sometimes it's something that I've
31:50 - programmed hundreds of times not hundred
31:52 - times but several times before but maybe
31:54 - not in years sometimes it's something
31:56 - that I'm completely looking at for the
31:58 - first time and try to code and sometimes
32:01 - it's something that I like practice the
32:03 - day before and then I'm recoding again
32:05 - usually it's this which is like I kind
32:08 - of understand how this works I watched
32:09 - this video a couple times this seems
32:12 - very similar to other things that I
32:13 - programmed how hard could it be but I'm
32:17 - about to attempt this for the first time
32:19 - I have never tried to program this
32:21 - particular visualization I'm definitely
32:23 - going to need the whiteboard camera so
32:32 - should I just say Valentine's Day
32:34 - there's nothing wrong with saying
32:34 - Valentine's Day I'm going to draw a nice
32:42 - heart here
32:51 - I'm going to attempt to draw the p3 logo
32:57 - which kind of looks like a 1 and then it
33:00 - has kind of like a 3 like that I really
33:11 - like like live on YouTube drawing a
33:13 - heart and like my own very poorly drawn
33:15 - version of the processing logo
33:17 - apparently I am ok here we go
33:21 - so let's cycle the camera and let's get
33:24 - started actually I think what I'll do is
33:30 - I'll start with this and what's
33:40 - Oh interesting this is kind of envelope
33:44 - of a pencil of line so this is basically
33:46 - the others as they say the same thing
33:48 - okay okay
33:51 - Oh whoops sorry you can't see me all
33:53 - right I'm gonna start with this on my
33:55 - screen all right here we go
34:07 - Valentine's Day with Pete with
34:08 - processing don't make me get out my
34:11 - ukulele behave chat don't make me get
34:13 - out my ukulele do I have a love song
34:23 - here I have the lullaby that's not where
34:26 - you love song this is kind of lovey
34:33 - lovey dovey
34:38 - all right okay maybe we won't do any
34:40 - music well add some some very impressive
34:43 - music in post
34:47 - all right here we go
34:51 - hello happy Valentine's Day from the
34:55 - coding tree I'm gonna say it once I can
35:16 - be serious for mine hello
35:19 - there's something in my heart that I
35:22 - love and here on this day February 13th
35:25 - although you might be watching this on
35:26 - February 14th there's some other day in
35:28 - the future I want to express my love for
35:30 - processing processing a programming
35:33 - language and environment that started in
35:36 - 2001 created by Casey Risa and Ben fry
35:39 - please read all about the history of
35:40 - processing in the processing foundation
35:42 - it's work right now
35:44 - Crossing foundation org and I forgot to
35:53 - blow my train whistle at least there's
35:58 - no timer right Snape the ACE let's let's
36:02 - move this along people hello I'm here
36:06 - it's February 13th I am feeling the love
36:09 - I would like to express my love for
36:11 - processing my first programming love my
36:14 - one true love process express it by
36:18 - creating this this is a famous shape in
36:21 - mathematics called the cardioid if I'm
36:24 - pronouncing that correctly cardioid like
36:25 - heart it's kind of like a heart and
36:27 - today it might be some other videos
36:28 - after this one where I make all sorts of
36:30 - kind of heart patterns but I just want
36:31 - to make this pattern now if you want to
36:33 - learn more about this shape and where it
36:36 - appears in mathematics I want to point
36:38 - out to you this wonderful youtube
36:39 - channel called mythology mythology has a
36:42 - video called times tables Mandelbrot and
36:45 - the heart the heart of mathematics
36:47 - with mathematics and processing and code
36:51 - and all that sort of stuff now I should
36:53 - also point out that rendering an
36:56 - animation of these times tables in
36:58 - processing has been done before and most
37:01 - notably by Simon Tiger and one of the
37:04 - things I love about processing this year
37:06 - is where there's been this worldwide set
37:08 - of processing community days recently in
37:10 - Amsterdam
37:10 - Simon presented his work on creating
37:12 - this very large poster about the times
37:15 - tables across the community Amsterdam I
37:17 - was just at processing Community Day New
37:18 - York over the weekend and like my heart
37:21 - is definitely full of like love and
37:23 - wonder with all the things people are
37:24 - doing with processing so this video is
37:26 - dedicated to all the people who are
37:28 - working on processing in p5 GS and
37:30 - fellowships and and everything I love
37:32 - you all
37:33 - now everything's gonna go wrong because
37:36 - I'm gonna start coding but you know so
37:38 - this this shape um you know you can find
37:41 - it in looking at the waves light
37:44 - reflects around a circle
37:45 - I mentioned the Mandelbrot set you can
37:47 - see it right here as in this bulb of the
37:50 - sort of like first bulb of the
37:52 - Mandelbrot fractal set is a cardioid
37:54 - shape and it's kind of amazing that it
37:56 - appears in this context of time tables
37:58 - so and then I think we're gonna if you
38:01 - watch the end of the mythology or video
38:03 - there's this like animation at the end
38:04 - then I was just like wow that looks so
38:06 - cool I gotta show it to you now but I'm
38:09 - just gonna program it and hopefully
38:10 - it'll be at the end of this video
38:12 - somehow I'll program it so let me talk
38:13 - about how this works okay so happy happy
38:18 - almost happy February 13th to everybody
38:20 - I love processing okay now let's say and
38:26 - this is good timing because in my course
38:27 - at NYU this week just today we were yes
38:30 - yesterday we're talking about polar
38:31 - coordinate so I'm gonna need to make
38:32 - heavy use of polar coordinates for this
38:34 - particular visualization so we're gonna
38:36 - start with a circle and we are going to
38:40 - divide this circle equally into parts
38:44 - basically almost like a pie chart but
38:46 - the way I'm gonna represent that is just
38:48 - by spacing out equally spacing out a set
38:50 - of dots so I think of the mythology
38:52 - video he starts with 10 that seems like
38:54 - a good number so and probably makes
38:57 - sense from you start
38:58 - here 0 1 2 wait a second I think it's
39:02 - gonna work if I get the three over here
39:03 - right three four five six blades and all
39:08 - we have our first fail record scratch
39:33 - this just just ignore me I'm over here
39:35 - looking at something yeah okay oh that
39:39 - makes it oh yes yes one two one two
39:41 - three four ah okay okay okay let's try
39:48 - that again
39:48 - I have one I have two now I need eight
39:53 - more so I need four along the top and
39:55 - four along the bottom this is for me to
39:57 - get ten so one two three no that's three
40:03 - one two three four one two three four
40:08 - okay I did an okay job there so this is
40:11 - my circle whoa my ukulele this really
40:20 - shouldn't be here what you're saying
40:26 - yeah there's gonna be some interesting
40:27 - editing in this I'm okay everybody don't
40:33 - worry that was it sounded worse I mean
40:34 - if anything my glasses are might be
40:36 - broken I didn't actually get my head
40:41 - into glasses okay all right I have my
40:44 - circle with the evenly spaced out dots
40:47 - so now let me number them zero one two
40:50 - three four five six seven eight nine
40:55 - so I want to do times tables meaning I
40:59 - want to multiply each one of these
41:01 - numbers by two and whatever number I get
41:04 - then I want to connect it to that so two
41:08 - times zero is what zero so that's just
41:11 - 1 times 2 is what - so that connects
41:14 - here 2 times 2 is what's 4 3 goes to 6 4
41:18 - goes to up shoot I'm gonna have an
41:25 - easier time programming this than
41:26 - drawing it that's for sure
41:27 - 4 goes to 8 5 goes to 10 there's no 10
41:31 - while we wrap around we use the modulo
41:33 - operator so we use the remainder
41:35 - basically if we keep counting like this
41:38 - will be 9 10 11 12
41:39 - so 5 goes to 10 6 goes to 12 7 goes to
41:43 - 14 and 8 goes to 16 9 goes to 18 etc etc
41:49 - etc yes so you can see here that this
41:54 - shape is sort of starting to emerge I
41:56 - did a terrible job drawing this I feel
41:58 - like there's a mistake somewhere
41:59 - but whatever close enough you get the
42:02 - idea so let's first start by just
42:05 - creating exactly this all right Oh
42:18 - matchy let's edit it - let me close
42:21 - these other things out just because I
42:24 - don't need them open I don't need this
42:26 - let's let's save this on the desktop as
42:33 - times tables and let me just add whoops
42:44 - oh I don't want the debugger on let me
42:47 - add void setup void draw let me say size
42:53 - is 6 let's make it a square right 640
42:58 - 640 actually hold on let's just see what
43:01 - that looks like that's pretty good
43:06 - oh my god I'm not in the right camera
43:11 - sorry everybody
43:14 - so why it used to be I swear in an old
43:18 - version of processing wherever I would
43:20 - leave the window it would kind of
43:21 - remember it and then when I would run it
43:23 - again it would end up there but just
43:24 - doesn't do that anymore it really makes
43:27 - me crazy there's probably a way I could
43:28 - modify like you can do like I don't want
43:31 - to get lost in this but just give me a
43:33 - second just curious
43:38 - no this doesn't work anymore I'll have
43:41 - to investigate that all right all right
43:51 - all right so let me start writing some
43:59 - code circle hmm okay so now what I need
44:04 - is I need a number of points so let me
44:07 - call this like this is the sir
44:09 - what's this scale the devised or I know
44:11 - what to call this total points just call
44:18 - it total all right so and I'm gonna make
44:20 - it a float let's keep it as an integer
44:22 - for right now I'm gonna change it to a
44:24 - float in a little bit you'll see why so
44:28 - now I'm going to I need to do a loop and
44:35 - draw all those points I want the center
44:38 - of my visualization I want everything to
44:43 - be well I let everything to be oriented
44:45 - around the center so I'm gonna translate
44:47 - to the center width / 2 height divided
44:50 - by 2 and then this is where that polar
44:53 - coordinate thing comes in I need to
44:56 - figure out the way I'm gonna find all
44:57 - those points is right there are how many
45:00 - slices of pie here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
45:05 - oh 10 how convenient so each one of
45:08 - these angles is 2 pi divided by 10 so
45:12 - that's how much I need to that's where
45:13 - each one of these points goes so I'm
45:16 - gonna say
45:19 - a delta this sort of like Delta angle
45:21 - I'll just call it Delta equals 2pi
45:25 - divided by total and then another
45:32 - actually another thing that way I could
45:33 - do is I could just use map so I could
45:35 - say angle equals map I which goes
45:37 - between zero and total to between 0 and
45:39 - 2pi
45:40 - it might be an easier way then I'm
45:41 - actually need this Delta and then I need
45:44 - a radius so which is basically I need to
45:47 - know like well how what is the radius of
45:50 - this circle that I'm visualizing and so
45:53 - for that let's just make the radius the
45:56 - width of the window divided by 2 so
45:59 - let's call that R which is the width of
46:02 - the window divided by 2 and then I want
46:04 - to say x equals R times cosine of the
46:08 - angle y equals R times sine of the angle
46:11 - and I will refer you to my video about
46:14 - polar coordinates to understand these
46:15 - particular formula pause for a second I
46:19 - see that there's some super chats flying
46:20 - by thank you so much when I finish this
46:23 - coding challenge I will thank you more
46:25 - properly thank you okay
46:29 - all right and then the next thing I just
46:32 - want to do is draw a point so I'm gonna
46:33 - say I'm gonna make an ellipse fill 255
46:36 - ellipse at X Y and oh oh thank you Ben
46:42 - fry I'm going to call this circle
46:45 - there's a circle function now 16 I love
46:49 - using these ok so let's see what do I
46:52 - get there we go look you could see
46:56 - there's my 10 dots around the circle now
46:58 - I probably want to be able to see that
47:00 - circle that would be nice too so let me
47:03 - say stroke 255 no fill ellipse and this
47:11 - the translate needs to come before
47:12 - drawing this I just want to draw I know
47:15 - it's a circle it's a circle at 0 0 R
47:19 - times 2 right because the circle
47:21 - function expects the diameter the radius
47:24 - times 2 so now we can see there we go oh
47:26 - I have my circle with all my points now
47:29 - I need to do
47:31 - my math thing all right so I'm gonna
47:35 - have a value I'm gonna call this n so n
47:42 - is going to be what is the x amount that
47:47 - I'm going to multiply each number by so
47:49 - there's total pot there's a lot of
47:50 - different parameters in the system and
47:51 - you can play with them to create all
47:52 - sorts of different kinds of patterns
47:53 - hopefully we'll see some of those by the
47:55 - time I get to the end but right now I'm
47:57 - going to make this a two times table to
47:59 - try to get that heart that cardioid so
48:02 - I'm gonna call that maybe I should call
48:03 - that factor let's call that factor
48:06 - let's I'm gonna put that up here int in
48:10 - factor equals two and I I'm sure there's
48:13 - a nice way I could do all this together
48:16 - but I'm gonna do this as a separate loop
48:18 - so now I'm gonna do this again I mean
48:20 - obviously I'm just reap I I will
48:22 - refactor this later as I like to say but
48:24 - what I want to do is I want to say hey
48:28 - is I like I want to go from point A to
48:31 - point B which is I times factor those
48:35 - are essentially my indices of like where
48:37 - where I'm connecting the lines so 0 goes
48:40 - from 0 1 goes to 2 2 goes to 4 and then
48:43 - I need a function it actually this could
48:45 - be really useful for me to write a
48:47 - function that returns a P vector giving
48:53 - me the giving me a given a P vector for
48:57 - any given index so so get vector for any
49:03 - given index and then so basically I can
49:06 - say the angle is map that index but
49:10 - which goes between 0 and total between 0
49:12 - and 2pi and then the vector equals a new
49:17 - P vector at and this should be a global
49:19 - variable R I cannot set the width up
49:24 - here because it doesn't know what the
49:25 - width is so I'm gonna make this R here
49:28 - and then I'm gonna say R equals with / -
49:30 - I couldn't make that an argument to this
49:32 - function but just gonna keep that as a
49:33 - global variable make a new P vector R R
49:36 - times cosine actually P vector class has
49:42 - something in it
49:43 - P
49:44 - vector from angle angle that'll make the
49:47 - vector pointing in that direction and
49:49 - then I just want to multiply it by the R
49:51 - to set it to be that and then right so
49:54 - I'm using some vector stuff here which I
49:56 - realized is now maybe a little bit
49:57 - beyond the scope of if you were coming
49:59 - to this video just without knowledge of
50:01 - how the P vector class works in
50:03 - processing or in p5 which is a p5 vector
50:06 - it's just an object that has an x and a
50:08 - y so it's a nice way for me to store the
50:10 - X and the y together and I can make the
50:14 - x and y components from an angle and
50:16 - then I can scale that by multiplying it
50:18 - by some radius so it's really it's
50:20 - really got that sort of polar coordinate
50:21 - thing built into it so when I multiply
50:24 - it by r and say return R and then
50:28 - actually since I'm here refactoring this
50:31 - I could say right here P vector V equals
50:38 - what did I call that function get vector
50:41 - based on I and then I should be able say
50:43 - V X V dot Y so I basically just took
50:45 - that code and put it into a function
50:47 - because I'm probably gonna need to do
50:48 - this quite a bit I don't want to return
50:50 - our I want to return V well this is
50:52 - liking what I'm doing so far I think
50:55 - this might actually work okay so now I
50:57 - want to say get vector for I and then
51:01 - get vector for I times factor but guess
51:04 - what it's not just I times factor right
51:07 - what so first of all why oh this should
51:10 - be a peeve Ector this should be a PE
51:12 - vector so it's not just I times factor
51:16 - although I guess I could rewrite this
51:18 - function it depends on where I want to
51:21 - put this actually I'm gonna put it here
51:22 - so I need somewhere to deal with the
51:25 - fact that when I do 6 times 2 I get 12
51:28 - but I really just want to because 12
51:31 - divided by 10 is 1 remainder 2 so 12
51:34 - modulo 10 is to the modulo operator
51:37 - which I have a video thank you goal 11
51:39 - about modulo is also linked now up there
51:44 - somewhere in a corner of this screen
51:46 - okay so now right here I could just add
51:49 - that here modulo total okay all right so
51:53 - I don't think I'd actually drew those
51:54 - lines but this is still working that's
51:56 - there now I should be able to
51:58 - a line a dot X a dot y bx b dot y there
52:05 - we go it's backwards well why is that I
52:07 - mean it's not backwards oh because I
52:09 - started over there interesting so a
52:12 - couple things I could do I could just
52:13 - call like the scale function to flip it
52:15 - the other way
52:16 - I mean what's backwards what's forwards
52:17 - who knows I'm just saying in terms of
52:19 - watching that mythology or video it was
52:21 - oriented the other direction I also feel
52:24 - like our she needs to be a little bit
52:25 - smaller than the actual size of the
52:27 - window so let's make our equal like
52:30 - let's give it a little bit of buffer
52:31 - like 16 pixels that's a little bit nicer
52:34 - to see again my my visual talent skills
52:38 - are so non-existent and I know people
52:41 - are watching this word designers and
52:42 - with artistic vision and you will make
52:44 - something beautiful out of this and I
52:45 - can't wait to see so ah ah aha I saw a
52:52 - chat message to go by which is really
52:54 - quite smart which is that I could just
52:56 - hear if this is the angle right this is
52:59 - the angle all I have to do is just if I
53:00 - wanted to start on the other side I can
53:01 - just add PI being 180 degrees so if if
53:04 - I'm starting with the angle here which
53:06 - if this is zero if I always just add PI
53:09 - I'll get here if I'm here I'll get there
53:10 - not type of thing and when I say PI I
53:12 - mean the number pi not a delicious
53:15 - blueberry vegan blueberry pie okay
53:24 - have to blow my nose where my tissues
53:29 - it's dripping
53:44 - [Music]
53:47 - okay all right let's give this a try oh
53:54 - it looks right okay now now we're
53:57 - getting somewhere
53:58 - so but the mythology uses the number 200
54:00 - I'm just gonna let's go to 20 and see
54:02 - what we get Lou that's kind of
54:04 - interesting let's go to 200 Wow there we
54:07 - go
54:08 - mwah what there is the Cardiac oh that
54:11 - is like beautiful just on its own and by
54:13 - the way what's interesting about this is
54:15 - this is very similar if not precisely
54:18 - the pattern you would see if there were
54:20 - a light source here and reflected or
54:22 - bounced around this particular this
54:26 - particular circle so okay all right oh
54:32 - it needs to be red it needs to be orient
54:34 - the other way need to have like an arrow
54:35 - through an example baby Cupid flying by
54:37 - lots of things all right but I want to
54:40 - make this animation so there's a there's
54:42 - a bunch of different things we could do
54:43 - for example this this could be a
54:46 - variable so let's just look at that
54:49 - really briefly just to see I'm gonna say
54:52 - float I'm gonna make it a variable here
54:54 - equals 200 or I'm gonna say sorry int
54:56 - total equals map mouse X I'm going to
55:00 - take the map function Mouse X goes
55:01 - between 0 and width and I'm going to map
55:04 - that between 0 and 200 and then I'm
55:08 - going to convert that to an integer so
55:11 - now as a whoops oh so then good point
55:16 - this let's have this take a total and
55:19 - then the get vector function should have
55:24 - the total passed in maybe there's a
55:27 - different way of doing it but now we can
55:28 - see basically based on the number of
55:32 - circles we can see as I move the mouse
55:34 - left and right that increasing so that's
55:36 - one way I could animate this I think
55:39 - it's probably us to decide like a
55:41 - different way of animating this which I
55:43 - will get to in a second I think is
55:44 - probably more interesting and it's
55:45 - varying the factor like what happens if
55:47 - this is a three times table by the way
55:49 - we could just try that right now so let
55:52 - me make this back to 200 and let's make
55:57 - the factor 3
56:00 - look at that interesting now by the way
56:04 - I die I shouldn't do this but I'm gonna
56:07 - try this let me go to the mandelbrot
56:10 - code
56:10 - okay now the mandelbrot code creates
56:15 - this pattern why it creates this pattern
56:20 - because of this formula Z equals Z
56:24 - squared plus C why is there an M there
56:26 - the kupets what if I change this to a
56:31 - three that would mean oh that's gonna
56:38 - change I can't do that so easily without
56:40 - it I need a complex number library this
56:42 - is about I thought like oh I could just
56:43 - in my head I was like I could just do
56:45 - this that's interesting okay I'll come
56:50 - back to that later
56:51 - maybe we should this is this is the math
57:01 - for squaring the complex number and I
57:06 - would have to like rewrite this entirely
57:10 - okay so this won't this won't make it
57:12 - nephrite thank you this won't make it in
57:15 - the final edit for this I'm looking at
57:23 - the chat okay all right
57:38 - nice idea but I'll I'll come back - all
57:41 - right
57:48 - breaking news I'm being told toward from
57:51 - the chat that this shape is called a
57:53 - nephrite so this is an F roid and if I
57:56 - would go to say factor for look what
58:00 - I've got now so this and interestingly
58:03 - enough we could actually make these
58:05 - floating-point numbers let's just see if
58:07 - I have to change anything in my code if
58:09 - I do that I'm going to I think but let's
58:14 - see so I'm gonna do this
58:16 - alright so immediately we're stuck here
58:19 - like oh these are no longer integers so
58:21 - what if I make this a float and this a
58:25 - flow list of everything B floats there
58:27 - we go that work let's let's be sure
58:28 - about this right so that was factor 3
58:31 - let's try factor 2 point 5 yeah this is
58:35 - looking like I should look so this is
58:38 - actually doing these same exact math but
58:40 - it's allowing for the spaces in between
58:43 - so what if I have two point two that
58:46 - could should connect to four point four
58:48 - and we can do modulo also because seven
58:53 - point one would connect to fourteen
58:55 - point one modulo 10 would still be sorry
58:58 - seven point one kick to fourteen point
59:00 - two modulo ten would still be a point
59:03 - four four point two so this works with
59:06 - floating points and now we can create
59:08 - that animation and so what I'm gonna do
59:10 - is I'm going to make this the global
59:13 - variable factor I'm going to start it at
59:17 - zero and then I'm just going to slowly
59:21 - over time say factor plus equals 0.01
59:30 - interesting oh there's the cardioid
59:31 - there's the nephrite isn't that lovely
59:36 - and beautiful and amazing I just I just
59:39 - love this now think of the possibilities
59:42 - I have done the most basic thing to just
59:45 - create this animation and at some point
59:48 - it's gonna get it's like really crazy
59:50 - stuff it's gonna start to
59:51 - but there's so many other parameters
59:52 - there's ways you could think about color
59:54 - here I'm gonna make a JavaScript version
59:57 - of this that will run the browser that I
59:59 - will publish that you can look at which
60:00 - is basically exactly the same code I
60:02 - could look at this forever I hope you
60:05 - enjoyed this dedication long-distance
60:07 - dedication to my true love the heart of
60:10 - mathematics and processing no wait wait
60:15 - I don't want to go just yet I'd love
60:19 - that it just keeps going it's like never
60:20 - stops so what I want to do actually
60:24 - before I leave
60:26 - besides to make it all rainbow coloured
60:28 - is I wanted to show you this is a nice
60:31 - way to increase the factor but I want
60:34 - I'm gonna make another video that's
60:36 - about making a perfect gift loop and I
60:39 - think this is an opportunity for us to
60:40 - make a perfect gift loop so where would
60:44 - be a part that matches up so one thing I
60:46 - could do with this this this factor oh
60:58 - so one thing I could do with this factor
61:01 - is they like map it to a sine wave so
61:03 - for example what if I have a variable
61:06 - called T which is gonna be like I'm
61:08 - gonna keep track of time and I also have
61:10 - a variable called like DT which is like
61:12 - my time step and maybe I'll just go up
61:14 - by 0.1 and so what I want to do is
61:17 - factor equals map the sine of T which
61:22 - comes out to negative 1 and 1 between 0
61:25 - and 200 oh yeah we go all the way up to
61:29 - 200 I don't know how high we should go
61:31 - there but let's try it let's try it up
61:33 - to 200 and then T plus equals zero point
61:36 - one so this would now have the factor
61:39 - value not just increase over time but
61:41 - smoothly oscillate with like an easing
61:43 - function a sine easing function there's
61:45 - lots of other easing functions you can
61:46 - use all the way up to 200 and all the
61:49 - way back down to 0 which would be a
61:50 - perfect loop so let's try that it's a
61:55 - little bit too fast
61:57 - well maybe 200 was too high let's have
62:01 - it just go up to 50
62:04 - still whoa okay so I have to figure out
62:06 - what makes sense here five there we go
62:11 - so you could do that hit five and now
62:13 - it's coming all the way back down to
62:16 - zero and back up to five so I don't know
62:18 - that I've hit on this exactly right
62:20 - let's make this go up to 20 let's have
62:22 - tea go up even slower why does it
62:26 - starting oh because sign no sign of zero
62:29 - is zero
62:31 - opposite over adjacent oh no no it
62:35 - starts at zero so Oh weird I wanted to
62:38 - start at zero so let's make this what
62:46 - happens if I give it a negative number
62:48 - I'm just curious
62:49 - I was interesting
62:59 - so I'm just seeing what's happening it's
63:01 - going all the way up to 20
63:03 - [Music]
63:10 - let me just actually have a go too - oh
63:16 - wait
63:26 - yeah
63:28 - interesting that's weird within what it
63:30 - does with the negative so I don't want
63:32 - the negatives so here's this is the
63:35 - simplest hopefully the lot of stuff just
63:38 - got cut out there I was confused the
63:40 - issue was sign goes between negative one
63:43 - and one you know all you need to do is
63:45 - have time start at like poem hopefully
63:55 - there was a little edit point there what
63:57 - might what it wasn't doing what I wanted
63:58 - to do because I wanted to start with
64:00 - times table 0 but sign of 0
64:04 - while it is 0 is then in if I'm mapping
64:07 - between the range negative 1 1 it starts
64:09 - at 1 so I could just change this to
64:11 - cosine because that would start at this
64:16 - is that would start at negative 1 or it
64:19 - actually starts it sorry yeah no it
64:24 - starts at 2 sine of sine of what is
64:31 - negative 1 I should know this right let
64:36 - me just show you how I figure this out
64:41 - it's PI over 2 R like group right so why
64:45 - did this not come on because so one of
64:56 - the things I love about thing about sine
64:58 - is like Y is sine as Y is sine of the
65:05 - angle Y is sine of 0 0 degrees 0 well if
65:11 - this is the angle sine is opposite over
65:14 - adjacent or I could I could call this
65:17 - the Y in this the hypotenuse or
65:18 - something so Y divided by H and imagine
65:22 - as this angle gets smaller and smaller
65:23 - and smaller and smaller and smaller like
65:25 - this
65:25 - eventually the if the angle is 0 the
65:29 - length of this side of the right
65:30 - triangle sine Roy trying anymore
65:31 - is 0 so even though the hypotenuse is
65:33 - whatever it is 0 divided bat so sine of
65:35 - 0 is 0
65:36 - now sign of what is 1 well if the the
65:40 - angle
65:42 - 90 degrees right the angle were 90
65:45 - degrees than that that side of that
65:47 - right triangle basically which isn't a
65:49 - right triangle anymore it would be equal
65:50 - to the hypotenuse so it's 1 so 90
65:52 - degrees is 1 so it must be like negative
65:55 - 90 would be negative 1 right so if I
66:00 - start it at like if I just say print
66:02 - line print line sine of negative PI
66:05 - divided by 2 negative 1 right so that's
66:09 - where I want to start so I'm gonna I'm
66:14 - gonna make this have some continuity
66:16 - here oh wait did it just work by
66:25 - accident no I don't know what's going on
66:28 - anymore why did it start at 0
66:41 - use trig circle yes a units big circle
66:44 - would be better
66:45 - I always think in weird ways though trig
66:48 - circle would tell me better
66:49 - oh because you're so weird
66:53 - just let me just I've ruined this video
66:56 - it's going so well
66:57 - this is what I want oh that's okay zero
67:05 - everything connects to zero I actually
67:07 - wanted to start at one as I want it to
67:10 - be it doesn't actually matter I was I
67:13 - was thinking that zero makes everything
67:16 - you see nothing but I'm totally wrong
67:18 - about that when the factor is zero
67:20 - everything connects back to zero when
67:23 - the factor is 1 you see nothing so in a
67:25 - way I actually want to start at 1 which
67:28 - is no no no applause please I want to
67:31 - start at 1 which is pi divided by 2 or
67:38 - but how come that oh that's starting at
67:46 - 2 so negative 100 it's actually perfect
67:49 - I had it right all along it just was
67:57 - like such a high number whatever I
68:01 - should have gone gone with this let me
68:04 - just go back I'm gonna like ignore that
68:07 - I thought this will like an interesting
68:08 - idea you think it's just it happened so
68:16 - fast at the beginning so in a way I
68:20 - wanted to this is not the sort of like
68:29 - oh because it starts at 5 when it's zero
68:35 - to two it's always in the middle so I
68:39 - want T actually to very specifically I
68:43 - see I get it now I get it now I always
68:48 - want if I always want it to start at one
68:53 - I always want to start it at whatever
68:56 - sigh whatever this number is / - I
69:05 - always wanted to be 10% of the in this
69:09 - case so if we're 20 I would need this to
69:12 - start it - this is so silly what I'm
69:19 - doing I don't think I'm right now I'm
69:29 - mostly just alright so let me think
69:35 - about this more for a second so this
69:38 - could actually I could actually have
69:39 - this be a number so I always want the
69:43 - starting point to be whatever so I can
69:45 - just do arcsine right so for example if
69:48 - I were to say let me just figure this
69:49 - out for a second if this were factor max
69:54 - factor is 20 right then what I want is
69:59 - and this would be max factor this is no
70:05 - longer a global variable T should start
70:09 - at arcsine of Max Factor / - right
70:54 - I'm trying to think about this
70:57 - sign of T 0 to 1 1 to 20 oh that's a
71:01 - smart way of doing it yes it would be so
71:05 - much easier if I just multiplied Max
71:06 - Factor by sign or if I add one cosine of
71:13 - T plus 1 that's a good solution you know
71:17 - I was doing so well and then I then I
71:19 - went off I'm too many tanned that's an
71:22 - interesting idea let's try that
71:35 - no map okay hold on I can work this out
71:43 - so many ways to do it on 0 to 2 and 1
71:46 - Damien no that's not gonna work use
71:49 - frame that set location in the draw
71:51 - function that's interesting hold on I
71:55 - want to make this start always at
71:58 - wherever it's going up to this is so
72:06 - silly
72:07 - it's lonely do it this way because this
72:10 - will be an easier way to think of it
72:11 - factor equals sine of t plus 1 times max
72:22 - factor
72:32 - and then this is the same thing I had
72:35 - before but if I'm just getting rid of
72:37 - the map function to think this through
72:39 - all I could do from C that's actually a
72:41 - really good idea right because the map
72:43 - function doesn't care if I say map
72:46 - sine of T with a range between 0 and 1
72:54 - and I always want to start it whatever
72:56 - whenever it's 0 I want it to be 1 Max
72:59 - Factor yeah there we go yeah that's
73:07 - that's what I want yeah ok I don't know
73:14 - why I couldn't couldn't think of that so
73:18 - what did I have before yes
73:31 - okay sorry sorry for that digression
73:34 - everybody lost my mind there for a
73:36 - minute it's very hot very stressful to
73:37 - do this in front pool I bought all right
73:46 - I'm I'm back I I went off on like a hold
73:49 - down a whole rabbit hole of like
73:51 - figuring out something which was
73:52 - actually quite simple which is that I
73:53 - was wondering why it wasn't starting
73:55 - what I wanted it to do I wanted to start
73:57 - I wanted to start like this if I put
74:00 - this at two I want it to start where the
74:04 - factor is one
74:05 - I want the factor to be one because I
74:08 - want it to sort of start in this loop
74:10 - with it always at with with you just
74:13 - seeing the outer circle and if
74:15 - everything is multiplied by itself then
74:17 - zero connectors are one we have no lines
74:19 - but if I increase and this works if I'm
74:22 - going between zero and two because sine
74:24 - of 0 is 0 and in this mapping function I
74:27 - end up with 1 but if I were to change
74:29 - this to 0 to 3 then it's starting
74:34 - somewhere else so that's not what I want
74:37 - and actually a trick that I can do with
74:39 - the map function is I could just sort
74:40 - even though the range is really negative
74:41 - 1 to 1 it's gonna figure out what to do
74:44 - even with something negative so I can
74:46 - actually make tell it the range is from
74:48 - 0 to 1 and then but whenever sine of T
74:53 - is 0 it should always equal 1 and then
74:56 - go up to like 20 that should work
75:01 - although it's really fast if this is
75:04 - just like way too fast
75:11 - still pretty fast but that's because I'm
75:13 - going so high let's just go to five I
75:15 - just want to see like a smoother
75:16 - animation there we go this is what I'm
75:17 - looking for so you can see start at zero
75:19 - and it's sort of like coming up to four
75:21 - of those little bulbs and then back down
75:23 - to zero and then back up
75:25 - so Oh tea is supposed to increase by DT
75:29 - ah whoops yeah I don't know why I made
75:32 - this DT variable and then didn't use it
75:34 - oh there we go
75:37 - I was also a mystic DT that whole time
75:42 - so I could control it and we could
75:44 - probably make this 20 now yeah and we
75:47 - could sort of see there we go this is a
75:48 - little bit better so I just wanted to
75:50 - see it's sort of like smoothly breathing
75:52 - animation that Luke's so it's going to
75:54 - go all the way up and back down I know
75:56 - this video was going so well at the
75:58 - beginning and became a bit of mess here
76:00 - at the end but I am really excited to
76:01 - see what kinds of things do you create
76:04 - from this the heart of mathematics the
76:07 - cardioid shape thank you for watching
76:09 - and I'll see you in a future coding
76:10 - challenge goodbye
76:15 - [Music]
76:19 - so really slows down is it good up there
76:22 - isn't it in fact sweeping negative 5 to
76:25 - 5 ah I think you're right
76:45 - hmm
76:50 - all right let's let's do let's let's
76:53 - understand how this works I should
77:01 - really do this in like right if sign
77:08 - whoops if I get the value one sorry if I
77:14 - get the value zero zero
77:16 - this should print I should see a 1
77:18 - that's exactly what I want if I see the
77:21 - value 1 I should see a 5 what if I get
77:26 - met do negative 1 negative 3
77:29 - yeah so I this isn't really right the
77:37 - problem is
77:51 - so there's a nicer way to do this which
77:55 - is I could just say all right I could
78:00 - have T start at negative PI divided by 2
78:03 - and map sine of T
78:17 - yeah that's what I want what's wrong
78:20 - with me this is what I want or I could
78:24 - use cosine because cosine will start at
78:26 - zero I don't need to go back down to
78:34 - zero
78:40 - cosine of zero is no cosine zero is not
78:44 - negative one so yeah okay well we redo
78:50 - that again ah this is even like simpler
78:59 - than what I had
79:12 - sorry Mathieu negative cosine oh you you
79:21 - smart people in the audience I'm gonna
79:23 - do it cosine starts at one I know so I
79:27 - could map it from 1 to negative 1
79:29 - there's so many ways there's like a
79:30 - hundred thousand different ways I could
79:31 - do it it's actually not that complicated
79:32 - I've just lost in my own thoughts here
79:34 - which is the thing that seems to happen
79:35 - a lot ok all right there's a weird edit
79:39 - point this is actually working the way I
79:40 - want it to work but it's not starting at
79:43 - the right spot like let me just run this
79:45 - again it kinda like starts in the middle
79:47 - and I want it to start where I wanted to
79:51 - start where the factor is 1 because I
79:54 - want all the points to connect to
79:56 - themselves which is what I don't see
79:57 - anything because I don't see any lines
79:58 - because every line is drawn from the
79:59 - point to the point so actually there's a
80:01 - really simple way to deal with this
80:03 - which is that sign I'm at T starts at 0
80:06 - and sine of 0 is 0 so like the factor is
80:10 - actually starting at 5 here because if
80:13 - I'm in the middle of the range that I'm
80:14 - about I know I'm just gonna change this
80:16 - range I don't I don't care about the
80:17 - range between 0 and 1 actually for the
80:19 - purpose of the animation so I start the
80:20 - range at 1 and then sine of what is
80:23 - negative 1 it is negative PI divided by
80:26 - 2 so I gotta just start at negative PI
80:28 - divided by 2 which will mean sine of 0
80:30 - will be at negative 1 and then you
80:34 - should see this there we go
80:36 - so it starts I want this to loop all the
80:38 - way up to this number of Bowl however
80:41 - I'm going up to 10 and then all the way
80:44 - back down to 0 so now I have some stuff
80:48 - that I could play with in terms of like
80:50 - oh I could have this go up to 50 I could
80:52 - change DT to be like twice as fast and I
80:55 - don't know it's way too fast probably to
80:57 - like get the effect of the animation
80:59 - yanks but you get the idea
81:01 - sorry for how crazy that looked let's
81:03 - make this do this like even slower see
81:07 - it start to form so this will now be a
81:10 - nice slow animation all the way up until
81:12 - 50 I'll take this out I am excited to
81:14 - see what you make out of this what
81:16 - happens when you think about the
81:18 - geometry in a different way you think
81:19 - about rendering this in a different way
81:21 - you think about color you think about
81:22 - multiple dimensions you think about
81:24 - different styles of animation what if
81:26 - you like we're actually like draw all
81:27 - the lines as there's so many
81:29 - possibilities here I hope you explore
81:31 - this and make your own version of the
81:33 - cardioid to express your love for
81:35 - somebody on this day on our every day of
81:39 - the year
81:40 - thanks very much and I will see you in a
81:41 - future coded challenge yeah three pie
81:51 - divided by two equals negative one but
81:53 - it's the same it's the same thing it can
81:55 - be negative right all right now with
81:59 - colors I'm gonna let everybody make
82:00 - their own version of this let me just
82:05 - quickly put this in the web editor so we
82:07 - have it but I actually kind of this
82:16 - didn't like the looping of this didn't
82:19 - work the way I kind of imagined it would
82:20 - so I think I might actually prefer to
82:24 - just leave it at I mean this I think
82:34 - this actually was a nicer animation to
82:36 - be perfectly honest
82:45 - hey Espen Larsen joined as a new member
82:48 - Espen Larsen is the creator the singer
82:53 - the composer of
83:12 - no I'm not leaving that was just the end
83:15 - sine squared from 0 to PI that's
83:19 - interesting all right sorry this is like
83:28 - way too much fun to watch I feel like I
83:31 - want to do this actually I want to do
83:34 - this
83:45 - oh it's slow interesting uh why is it
83:48 - slow let me sorry I just I can't help
83:50 - myself
83:51 - let me just like play with this for a
83:52 - little bit just a little bit longer
83:53 - before I go into the next coding
83:54 - challenge I feel like these circles are
84:00 - which ones are unnecessary will I get
84:11 - just as much value out of like fewer
84:16 - lines
84:30 - I just want to I just want to give it a
84:35 - little a little something
84:52 - and what happens if I do this with
84:55 - hardware acceleration there we go all
85:04 - right let's take a little break and let
85:06 - this play I'll do some thumbnails okay
85:26 - so let me let me do some thank yous I'm
85:30 - here where where is this thank you to
85:34 - Israel
85:36 - ah hoo ho sorry thanks for your passion
85:41 - I learned a lot with you thank you to
85:42 - otaku's thank you welcome to new member
85:45 - akre technologies and new member Espen
85:48 - Larsen
85:54 - [Music]
86:09 - so let me just say so
86:12 - membership wise there is a join button
86:14 - on YouTube I also have a patreon if I'm
86:17 - constantly thinking about whether I'm
86:18 - gonna keep the patreon or not but I
86:22 - don't have a lot of benefits for people
86:25 - who join as members I do mail you a
86:27 - sticker or not a cigar a bunch of coding
86:30 - train stickers you can see some of them
86:31 - here and and then I sometimes do live
86:39 - streams where I'm trying to like test
86:42 - out an idea or fix something that will
86:44 - just be for members only that's pretty
86:46 - rare wouldn't count on that and then we
86:47 - have a slack channel so again I should
86:49 - mention that if you if you have recently
86:53 - joined as a Youtube member but you don't
86:55 - have a slack invite check the community
86:57 - tab and there's it's probably just I'll
86:59 - post me much I post a new one the only
87:01 - way I can get you a slack invite us
87:02 - through a Google Form I forgot another
87:03 - way to do it
87:04 - so so to ekor technologies and Espen
87:08 - sandal Larsen hopefully I can get you
87:10 - your slack invite soon okay the song by
87:13 - the way is manfred writes you've got to
87:16 - make this song long longer there
87:18 - actually is a full version of the song
87:20 - on Spotify that you can find but and I
87:24 - will ship the stickers anywhere
87:25 - internationally it's very inexpensive to
87:27 - send something in the I mean it just
87:29 - costs a dollar or two so I'm very happy
87:31 - to send you the stickers wherever you
87:32 - are in the world the thing that I have a
87:34 - problem with is I don't get to it very
87:35 - quickly and so sometimes you have to bug
87:39 - me a little bit about that and I
87:40 - apologize for that you shouldn't have to
87:42 - but um you know if yeah so okay
87:50 - it's just by the way what's interesting
87:51 - is it just still going I should really
87:53 - put what the factor number is this would
87:55 - be interesting too let's just do this
87:57 - for a second
88:04 - text factor
88:10 - number four minute number format by the
88:13 - way is a function and processing that
88:15 - will control the number of decimal
88:16 - places you show and so we can go like
88:18 - this whoops Oh text is a little weird
88:21 - and PGD will this work
88:23 - whoops oh I forgot because I am so now
88:35 - we should see that's the factor up in
88:38 - the top left so we'll see that's kind of
88:43 - interesting to see what number it is by
88:45 - the time it gets to different patterns
88:49 - so you can see that's five usually the
88:53 - number of bulbs is one less than number
88:55 - six all right so what else am I gonna do
89:00 - today it is noon I've got another hour
89:03 - so in me here oh oh I want to do the I
89:14 - definitely want to do the next thing I
89:16 - want to do is the gift loop thing okay
89:18 - so if to think about this
89:26 - I just like letting this run can I let
89:29 - it run in the background while I do
89:30 - other stuff yes
89:32 - so let's look for hold on I've gotta
89:36 - find some messages sent to me from goal
89:42 - on 11 just sit here no oh it's cuz it's
90:01 - not with the G this is good and this is
90:08 - good okay I'm looking for this I
90:27 - [Music]
90:43 - also looking for Saskia
91:05 - where's the best way is it tumblr yeah
91:09 - okay and what's this
91:25 - No
91:32 - this and then there was something else
91:39 - when I'm looking for gift loop gallery
91:44 - okay
91:46 - interactivity and computation if loop
91:51 - gallery I think this is what I'm looking
91:56 - for okay awesome oh-ho I love this
92:08 - that's really great
92:17 - I love all these okay
92:33 - okay so I think I am ready for the next
92:37 - coding challenge where are we now we're
92:38 - up at factor equals 75 Simon and Simon's
92:46 - poster I wonder how many go up to Max
92:52 - Factor then reverse the sign of DT and
92:54 - you get back to zero and then reverse
92:55 - again yeah whoa it's interesting how it
93:03 - sort of comes back to what it was of
93:05 - course at the beginning okay all right
93:19 - right
93:23 - yeah a slider would certainly be an
93:26 - option okay so let me just I just want
93:33 - to put this back yeah
93:47 - I'm just getting the code into a place
93:49 - where I can release it fine all right
93:56 - great okay
94:12 - okay
94:32 - [Music]
94:37 - let me just look at
94:48 - let's look at Golan's code for a second
94:52 - so I want to make like a simpler version
94:54 - of it but it's super good to see so
94:59 - let's look at this one if I run this
95:03 - alright so this is what it's doing so
95:07 - the technique here the technique here is
95:10 - to have a counter that basically goes
95:13 - from 0 to 1 that's like a percentage
95:18 - complete of the loop it looks like and
95:20 - there's a you specify like the total
95:23 - number of frames so like if I change
95:25 - that to 500 it's really the same thing
95:28 - but it's just running slower because
95:30 - there's like more frames if I change
95:32 - this to 50 we'd see it like this ok
95:39 - and then then this will start recording
95:42 - it so if you're recording it you compute
95:48 - always computer percentage and then you
95:49 - oh you call like a render function with
95:51 - that percent that's pretty interesting
95:53 - and then it takes a percent between 0 1
95:58 - and then there are two different
96:00 - graphical techniques for example like
96:04 - this spinning thing and Hutt's % times 2
96:07 - pi that makes sense and then
96:10 - transformations a percent times 2 pi
96:13 - times negative 0.25 interesting linearly
96:17 - moving percent plus 0.5 modulus one map
96:23 - percent for 0 to 1 okay that's like
96:25 - linear sigmoid aliy moving pink square
96:29 - function double exponential sigmoid Oh
96:31 - fascinating
96:32 - oh I see there's all these different
96:36 - easing functions mmm how much do I want
96:39 - to get into all this traveling sine wave
96:42 - % that's super interesting ok ok alright
96:52 - so easing functions
97:07 - yeah
97:10 - so like different easing functions you
97:12 - could use
97:20 - [Music]
97:31 - got it okay okay I think I have used
97:36 - cosine square what's that
97:44 - okay so I think I'm ready to give this a
97:48 - start
97:58 - [Music]
98:01 - all right
98:03 - all right let's let's get this going
98:20 - okay hold on erase this
98:38 - I really want to adjust my Mandelbrot
98:40 - code to being able to do to be able to
98:46 - do the complex numbers to like the third
98:49 - power the fourth power that should be an
98:51 - interesting thing to do so maybe I'll
98:53 - get to that at some point let me just
98:55 - check the chat here oh my goodness I
99:09 - forgot to record this to disk it's fine
99:12 - we'll have to get it down from YouTube
99:13 - but I need to do some green screen
99:16 - thumbnail shots later
99:18 - oh sorry Matt shoot what's here's a hint
99:23 - for you what's this I don't know what's
99:29 - going on here oh this is something
99:34 - happening in the chat that's not look
99:41 - the quality on this live stream was
99:43 - hopefully okay because I'm gonna have to
99:44 - when I edit this together it's gonna
99:46 - when Matt gets it it's gonna have to be
99:47 - the YouTube archive that gets edited
99:49 - because I forgot to hit record to disk
99:51 - use a tan to to get angle and modulus to
99:54 - get length and maybe the chat is
99:56 - discussing something that has nothing to
99:58 - do with me right now I need to to to
100:01 - move along I'm saying lag was it lagging
100:11 - before hopefully it'll be fine hopefully
100:17 - it will be fine all right
100:24 - anyway I'm recording this to disk now so
100:26 - everything else from now will be
100:32 - okay what I want to know is it was not
100:42 - lagging during the challenge okay great
100:44 - okay great all right well we can always
100:55 - fix some things in post by like
100:57 - overlaying the visuals if we have to but
101:04 - I'm gonna move on all right okay I get
101:09 - that as lagging theirs let me just check
101:10 - the my yeah bad it's so that I don't
101:16 - know
101:17 - it says the stream status is currently
101:19 - bad I don't know what to do about that
101:24 - all right
101:36 - all right here we go
101:40 - hello I am here today to do a coding
101:44 - chit chat oh my god I think I have to
101:51 - minimize the chat yeah try it slow mode
101:56 - I don't know hello I am here today to
102:05 - make a coding challenge about making a
102:08 - perfect well whatever I make won't be
102:11 - perfect but you might make something
102:12 - perfect gift loop so what does it gets
102:14 - loop why am I talking about gift loops
102:15 - so one way that artists who work with
102:19 - computational media and computer
102:20 - graphics are distributing their work and
102:23 - and and expressing themselves is through
102:25 - posting gifts to various different
102:27 - online platforms an artist I would like
102:30 - to highlight is Saskia freak who has
102:33 - been making daily animated artworks for
102:38 - quite a long time in fact maybe there
102:40 - have been at least 1500 of them which is
102:42 - mind-blowing and you can see a whole
102:45 - variety of them here on her tumblr
102:47 - there's some other I think she would a
102:49 - medium article about this process
102:50 - they're amazing a very famous gift
102:52 - artist that I have referenced in
102:55 - previous videos if I did a whole coding
102:56 - challenge trying to recreate his cube
102:58 - wave is cube wave is bees and bombs so
103:01 - bees and bombs creates looping gifts
103:04 - through algorithms and math and graphics
103:07 - in all sorts of astonishing mind-blowing
103:10 - ways so I encourage you to check out
103:12 - bees and bombs also tumblr to see all of
103:16 - the kinds of gifts that he has created
103:19 - I'm goal on Leben at Carnegie Mellon
103:20 - University professor Carnegie Mellon
103:22 - University gives an assignment every
103:24 - semester in his course interactivity and
103:26 - computation to create a gift gallery and
103:29 - so these create a gift and this is a
103:31 - gallery of gifts that students made in
103:34 - his course just this past fall and Golan
103:37 - has a lecture about loops throughout the
103:42 - history of art you know all it's very
103:44 - easy to think as we work on programming
103:46 - computer and make algorithms visual and
103:48 - happen in javascript in the browser with
103:50 - your open GL shaders WebGL magic that
103:52 - this is the first time any doesn't
103:53 - happen but this kind of work has been
103:55 - happening for years and years and
103:57 - predates the dawn of computers
103:59 - themselves so this is a wonderful set of
104:03 - historical references to different kinds
104:06 - of Luc's that people have been making
104:09 - and of course here's the iconic
104:10 - Muybridge galloping horse that you can
104:13 - see here so I encourage you to check out
104:14 - all of these resources read about loops
104:16 - and in fact you don't even need to watch
104:18 - this video you can go right here to gold
104:22 - ons Luke templates which has templates
104:23 - for Java
104:25 - I'm sorry processing Java p5.js
104:27 - JavaScript and Python processing as well
104:29 - so what I'm gonna do though in this
104:31 - video is I'm gonna make my own I'm not
104:32 - worrying about making something artistic
104:34 - or innovative or beautiful I'm just
104:37 - gonna try to show the process from start
104:39 - to finish of writing code in processing
104:41 - rendering it out to files and then
104:43 - compacting that up as a gift that you
104:45 - could post I'm also gonna come back and
104:48 - do a follow up video there's a new p5
104:50 - JavaScript gift library that some
104:52 - students of mine worked on last semester
104:54 - in a course about open source and so I
104:56 - will come back and show that in a future
104:58 - video as well so let's get started so
105:00 - what is the driving principle of making
105:03 - a loop so if you look at Golan's code
105:06 - examples the core idea is to have to
105:09 - have first a total number of frames so a
105:12 - gift an animation is just rendering a
105:17 - whole bunch of images in sequence at
105:19 - some framerate for your eye to see and
105:22 - it appears like animation and if
105:25 - whatever it is in the last frame or
105:29 - really what would be the last frame the
105:31 - sort of like frame before the last frame
105:33 - matches up exactly with the first one
105:36 - then you have a loop so in other words
105:38 - if I'm drawing a circle here and then it
105:40 - goes to here and then it goes to here I
105:43 - don't need that many frames and then it
105:50 - goes to here and then maybe it
105:53 - disappears I have a blank frame then in
105:56 - theory the next frame I want to see it
105:59 - would be it entering the screen that
106:00 - but instead I go back and show the first
106:02 - one so this will look like it's a loop
106:04 - that's going on forever
106:05 - whereas reality is just starting at the
106:07 - beginning and the last frame matches
106:09 - that and so as it goes back to the
106:11 - beginning
106:11 - it appears infinite so this is the idea
106:13 - so one couple things we need to do we
106:15 - need to keep track of like what is the
106:18 - total frames we want so we're going to
106:20 - need some sort of variable like total
106:22 - frames like in this case I want to have
106:24 - one two three four five and I'm really
106:27 - going to use the number six because I'm
106:29 - not gonna I'm gonna read this is zero
106:30 - zero one two three four five
106:36 - wait hold let me think about this if I
106:38 - don't want to render out the last frame
106:40 - but the idea has six anyway Oh
106:48 - everything's gonna be okay
106:50 - just take a break take a deep breath
106:54 - [Music]
107:04 - am I supposed to look at the chat now
107:06 - and probably everybody saying aye why
107:08 - does he look at the chat I can tell
107:09 - that's what's in the chat I didn't have
107:10 - to look at the chat to know everybody
107:11 - the chat is that just me look at the
107:13 - chat I'm gonna go look at the chat oh no
107:18 - I knew it I knew it I knew what this
107:21 - would happen I knew enough to pull this
107:23 - car over I'm pulling this car over
107:27 - [Music]
107:30 - Giff with a G some people like to say
107:40 - good and some people like to say yeah
107:45 - but I like to say good but I don't mind
107:49 - and if people say
107:52 - because we can all where's my dad
108:30 - where's my pen the G is silent if I
108:36 - think that's a good way pronounce it if
108:38 - I lost my pen my marker and I have to go
108:44 - I have to go be a human being somewhere
108:48 - else in the world today how come I lost
108:51 - that marker I have a sweater I have like
108:53 - a keyboard I have oh here's a marker is
108:55 - this the marker I was using maybe all
109:00 - right I don't want to get lost in the
109:02 - details of the total here let's just say
109:05 - the idea is that the animation itself
109:07 - has six frames 0 1 2 3 4 5 into that's
109:15 - the frame count and then I might not
109:18 - include the last frame 1 actually stitch
109:19 - it together because the last frame like
109:21 - is really back to the first frame again
109:23 - but the point is the total number of
109:24 - frames need the total number frames and
109:27 - then I also want to have a variable
109:30 - called percent and the idea is that
109:33 - percent will always be the current frame
109:36 - count will be in the current frame the
109:40 - current frame number divided by the
109:43 - total number of frames and what you'll
109:46 - see in Golan's example let's do the same
109:47 - thing is if we have the the ubiquitous
109:51 - processing draw loop draws looping over
109:54 - and over we could actually put our code
109:56 - somewhere else like maybe I'll write a
109:58 - function called render and we would just
110:00 - call that function render passing in the
110:03 - percent so this is a fun
110:05 - that knows how to render some kind of
110:08 - design based on what percentage of the
110:11 - way through the design it is and as long
110:13 - as the design is his is thought of in a
110:17 - way where the end matches the beginning
110:19 - then this is going to work out all the
110:22 - other stuff about like saving frames and
110:24 - all that kind of is it recording is it
110:25 - not recording that could be in the draw
110:26 - loop okay this is way too much
110:28 - explanation because it's in essence like
110:30 - quite a bit quite a bit more simple but
110:33 - there's something to say that it was the
110:38 - king of yeah why there's two more things
110:44 - I want to say about this one is Golan
110:47 - writes in his instructions as student
110:49 - sketch on paper first so I really
110:52 - recommend you you do that if this is
110:54 - something you want to create try working
110:56 - this out with crayons markers charcoal
110:58 - pencil that's a really helpful going
111:01 - into that sort of like analog drawing
111:02 - process will really help you think
111:04 - through your ideas number two is what
111:07 - are the kinds of algorithms that move a
111:11 - value from one number to another number
111:14 - and in fact maybe like by the wrap back
111:17 - around and there are all sorts of
111:18 - different kinds of ways of doing this um
111:20 - probably yours if you've watched any of
111:23 - my videos before you might be thinking
111:25 - of the sine function the sine function
111:26 - is an excellent function to use for a
111:28 - gift loop because if it's start as a
111:31 - sine function if I were to graph the
111:33 - sine function right it sort of it where
111:36 - it starts it and it repeats it's a
111:38 - repeating pattern over and over again
111:40 - you could also use and then there's a
111:42 - ton of different kinds of easing
111:44 - functions so there's this lovely website
111:47 - called easing functions easiness net
111:50 - which is an easing function cheat sheet
111:52 - and I highly recommend you explore some
111:54 - of these other easing functions to think
111:56 - about how you might move a value through
111:58 - this loop and if you go to Golan's code
112:02 - I'll just click on the click on the
112:03 - processing one for a second you can see
112:05 - like even in the code here there is a
112:09 - this like double exponential sigmoid
112:13 - easing function so anyway that's a
112:15 - that's a like exports you can do
112:17 - separately from this video let's just
112:18 - get the basic
112:19 - mechanics working so for example I'm
112:22 - gonna go back to processing actually let
112:25 - me make a new sketch where do I have a
112:26 - sketch already whatever like a new
112:29 - sketch what I call it gif gif loop
112:36 - [Music]
112:41 - sometimes I just like start to MI at two
112:45 - hours yet once I get to two hours like I
112:47 - stopped being so I like reading the chat
113:01 - sometimes all right so I have a blank
113:09 - processing sketch now and I'm going to
113:12 - go set up I'm gonna draw I'm gonna I'm
113:17 - gonna let's let's make it a square like
113:18 - 400 by 400 let's make the background
113:21 - zero ah but no no no no let's make
113:25 - another function called render and this
113:31 - function is going to take a value like
113:33 - percent and what I'm gonna do is I'm
113:37 - gonna say render percent I'm gonna say
113:40 - the percent is the by the I'm gonna I'm
113:46 - gonna make my own variable called
113:47 - counter divided by the total frames so
113:52 - this means I need to say like okay well
113:54 - I want to have a hundred and twenty
113:56 - total frames in this gif I want to have
113:58 - a counter equal to zero and now here
114:03 - what I'm gonna do let's just do
114:04 - something like say the ellipse an
114:08 - ellipse is at % x with this would be a
114:12 - linear function now at height divided by
114:17 - 2 and which is like 20 by 20 so we can
114:22 - see now if I say counter plus plus and
114:28 - I'm going to say afloat
114:33 - let's just see if this works for a
114:35 - second so this is the idea that I have a
114:38 - total number of frames I have a counter
114:40 - that's gonna go up and I really want it
114:42 - after I I want to start the counter at
114:44 - zero and then count up by one after
114:46 - render and this the idea here is that a
114:48 - much more complex sophisticated design
114:50 - with all sorts of different kinds of
114:51 - easing equations could be in here but
114:55 - let's just see if this works I have some
114:58 - brackets out of place what so I have
114:59 - some weird extra slash here so let's see
115:02 - what happens there we go so we can see
115:03 - it's moving across it's almost like the
115:05 - ball is moving because it's being drawn
115:07 - based on a percent now how do i how
115:11 - would I determine how I want to render
115:13 - this so if I'm record like I'm just
115:15 - gonna have mine start recording right
115:16 - when the program starts so if you look
115:18 - at goal lines examples a bit more
115:19 - sophisticated you press a key it starts
115:21 - recording but here what I'm going to do
115:23 - is I'm just going to say right here save
115:28 - frame gif - pound pound pound pound
115:34 - which are hash PNG and I'm gonna I'm
115:37 - gonna make a folder called output so
115:39 - what this function does is it saves an
115:45 - image to the directory output associated
115:48 - with this processing sketch as a PNG
115:50 - those hash symbols or pound symbols
115:52 - indicate to processing that you don't
115:54 - you want the file name to be numbered
115:56 - based on the frame count hmm I'm gonna
116:01 - do this a different way oh because I'm I
116:07 - want to use my own counter this is going
116:09 - to use the automatic frame count which
116:11 - is probably fine but what I want to do
116:17 - is I'm gonna say plus number format
116:20 - counter 4 + PG so I'm gonna add the
116:25 - counter number in here manually I think
116:28 - that's gonna be all about this number
116:29 - format function says use four digits no
116:31 - matter what I guess I can just use three
116:33 - because I know I'm going to have a
116:36 - hundred 20 frames only need three dot
116:38 - PNG and then what I could say is if
116:42 - counter equals total frames
116:46 - I'm gonna just basically say exit here
116:48 - so I'm gonna tell the program to stop so
116:52 - let's run this okay now let's look it I
117:02 - have a folder called output I look in
117:04 - there and we can see there we go I have
117:06 - all my images so these there are tons of
117:09 - ways now I could take this and stitch it
117:12 - together as a gift let's actually do
117:15 - that really quickly so for example I'll
117:18 - pause for a second
117:29 - sorry I'm looking at the chat okay I'm
117:38 - trying to say if I want to do this I'm
117:39 - not gonna do the stitching now okay so
117:43 - I'll show you how to do the stitching
117:45 - later in fact this new p5 library
117:47 - actually will just create the gift for
117:49 - you too but it's kind of nice to have
117:50 - them as separate images and we do have
117:52 - this question of like do I have it
117:54 - matching up correctly like we should see
117:55 - the last one should be 119 and it's
117:58 - there so you know my algorithm is
118:00 - perhaps like not the best like really
118:04 - like this percent times width
118:05 - isn't really like a perfect loop so
118:08 - that's something I might need to improve
118:09 - but let's let's make something that I
118:11 - know will be a perfect loop so for
118:13 - example one thing that I could do now is
118:15 - I could say alright let's let's use
118:18 - rotate so I'm going to say angle equals
118:21 - percent times 2pi and i'm going to
118:27 - translate to the center of the window
118:30 - I'm going to say wrecked mode Center I'm
118:34 - gonna say no stroke I mean no fill
118:39 - stroke weight too and then I'm gonna say
118:42 - rectangle at zero rotate by some angle
118:48 - rectangle lets you square square at zero
118:51 - zero with a side length of 100 so let's
118:57 - look at this what just happened no fill
119:02 - o stroke to 55 and this should have a
119:05 - fill of 255 so now we can see this is
119:11 - spinning now in theory that's gonna
119:15 - match up perfectly because that rotation
119:18 - at 2pi equals the rotation at zero and
119:21 - I'm rendering the very last frame right
119:24 - before percent would be one in which
119:26 - case it would actually be 2pi so this
119:28 - should match up perfectly
119:30 - so let's now I'm going to comment this
119:34 - out let's do this one more time let that
119:38 - spin stop now let's actually make it a
119:42 - gift all right so I need to look
119:43 - up really quickly I need to look up
119:52 - really quickly how I would um what's the
119:58 - let me just look oh I think it's on
120:01 - Golan's homework assignment like some
120:04 - recommended websites like easy gift or
120:07 - something
120:07 - I guess I could just Google one I just
120:10 - want to find like a reputable gift
120:13 - stitching website gif I mean you could
120:17 - do it in Photoshop but I don't want to I
120:19 - don't wanna use Photoshop gifts tip it
120:21 - open source gifts somebody's going to
120:24 - recommend one for me
120:35 - Oh posted assignments okay let me look
120:37 - prices ins I'm sorry I'm looking at a
120:39 - different computer right now tips for
120:42 - making gifts gift maker dot me let's try
121:02 - gif maker dot me
121:11 - giffy I like but the giffy tool just
121:15 - lets you capture it so let's let's go to
121:19 - gif maker dot me
121:21 - yeah let's just do this okay all right
121:29 - so I picking just this website that was
121:31 - recommended on Golan Levin's page gif
121:33 - maker dot me you can also make a gift
121:35 - for the Photoshop their countless all
121:36 - include some other resources of how you
121:37 - can do it but what's nice about here is
121:39 - I can click this upload images and I can
121:42 - go to the desktop to this gift loop and
121:46 - oh whoops
121:48 - hold on that's this sketch oh I didn't
121:52 - even save it oh my god I'm such a loser
121:54 - hold on hold on let's delete that and
122:04 - let's go to the desktop let's run it
122:11 - [Music]
122:16 - and I can click upload images I can go
122:23 - to the desktop I can go to my processing
122:26 - sketch called gif loop I can find this
122:27 - output folder and then I can just do
122:29 - select all hit open and it is uploading
122:34 - all the images oh I'm putting my gift
123:23 - out of the oven it's ready ding yes all
123:25 - right and now you can see look I have
123:27 - this control panel which lets me do
123:32 - stuff and change the animation speed and
123:34 - bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla
123:37 - bla bla bla bla bla create gif animation
123:41 - what do I do now
123:44 - download the gif and then I go here let
123:49 - me find it oh it's so slow so let's uh
123:57 - there must be animation speed does that
124:00 - make it faster or slower laughter like
124:02 - look at this
124:10 - no slower oh yeah oh I see
124:27 - so hold on so we can see the gift here
124:31 - it's actually like running really really
124:34 - slow
124:35 - that's because if these animation speed
124:37 - is set at 200 milliseconds in between
124:39 - each frame so if I change this to like
124:41 - 10 maybe even just like 2
124:44 - unless maybe too fat let's make that 5
124:47 - there's a 10 there we go so we can see
124:50 - that looks good now can you see is that
124:52 - a perfect loop looks like a perfect loop
124:53 - to me so now I should be able to do
124:56 - create gif Craig if Craig if and then
125:01 - hit download the kif sorry was there and
125:04 - then if I look at it in finder know what
125:10 - let me just why it does not work you the
125:21 - gift
125:23 - no it's still so slow
125:34 - why
125:37 - [Music]
125:47 - why am I not able to get that speed
125:50 - [Music]
126:02 - [Music]
126:08 - if i refresh this is it
126:16 - let's try that again the Skippy cricket
126:38 - hold on hold on so there's the gift
126:43 - maker on giffy which I use but I thought
126:45 - oh let's do this alright I'm ready to
126:56 - make my gift now and so what I'm gonna
126:59 - do is I'm gonna use a giffy has a gift
127:03 - maker here at goofy calm slash create
127:05 - slash gift maker and I can add multiple
127:07 - images to create a gift slideshow oh I'm
127:11 - making a slideshow I have no idea so I'm
127:13 - gonna do this by the way I'm arty my
127:15 - finder is already pointed to this folder
127:17 - but basically I just need to find my
127:18 - processing sketch which is here on the
127:20 - desktop under gif loop I saved
127:22 - everything into output and then so now
127:24 - if I click here and do command a4 select
127:27 - all and open it is now uploading all my
127:31 - files look at this oh this is so cool so
127:34 - now I could see all of the images and I
127:38 - could probably I could delete some I
127:39 - could I could change them so I could do
127:40 - something like editing here and then if
127:43 - I want the whole thing to be one second
127:45 - interesting so like I could change this
127:49 - is it giving me like a preview that's
127:52 - the preview oh this is very very slow oh
127:56 - I want each image to be one second I do
127:59 - not want that so if I want like 30
128:02 - frames per second then I want each image
128:04 - to be oh I just have to use the slider
128:08 - well is that like the only options I get
128:10 - I can only do ten frames for a second
128:14 - seriously it doesn't let me have any
128:17 - more control over it than that
128:26 - that's not good I guess that's kind of
128:30 - reasonable to do but I want to have more
128:32 - a faster frame rate well let's at least
128:34 - see if this works continue to decorate
128:38 - Oh 15.9 duration exceeds a master
128:44 - maximum of 15 seconds well no so this is
128:53 - the disc gift makers no good apparently
128:56 - we need to the old website was better
128:58 - alright let's go back to that no wonder
129:04 - goal on didn't recommend this one
129:06 - alright here we are
129:07 - can I just drag and drop it by the way
129:14 - just curious if it lets me do that no
129:18 - that would be nice wouldn't it
129:22 - [Music]
129:25 - all right I found this website thank you
129:28 - to the recommendation from Golan gif
129:30 - maker dot me there are so many different
129:31 - ways you could make a gift you can do it
129:33 - in Photoshop there I will include reach
129:35 - links to other websites that allow you
129:36 - to do this ugh if he has one though it
129:38 - has some limitations I just found out
129:39 - because I just tried it and what I need
129:41 - to do here is click this upload images
129:43 - and basically I want to take this folder
129:46 - and upload all of the images I saved out
129:49 - to that website so I am now going to
129:51 - click upload images and luckily my
129:54 - browser is already into that folder oh I
129:56 - wonder why but you would have to
129:58 - navigate to find it I'm gonna hit
129:59 - command a which does select all open and
130:02 - then now I wait for these things to
130:04 - upload
130:05 - [Music]
130:36 - [Music]
130:43 - oh it uploaded and now I take my gift
131:02 - out of the oven and present it to you
131:03 - here all right so we can see that it's
131:07 - going it's very very slow so if I want
131:10 - it to be that's because it is the
131:12 - animation speed is 500 milliseconds
131:14 - which I assume is the amount of time for
131:16 - each image and I believe 30 frames per
131:20 - second would be like 16 is that right so
131:23 - if I do that we can see how that looks
131:24 - right so that's like 30 frames per
131:26 - second and then I want to do create gif
131:29 - animation click that please wait a
131:32 - moment then I'm just gonna click view
131:35 - the gif it opens up a new tab that's
131:37 - still really slow right
131:39 - that's not 30 frames per second why is
131:44 - this not working
132:07 - all right let's try downloading it see
132:08 - if that helps so now I've downloaded the
132:13 - gif it's not 30 frames per second is it
132:23 - just that I and it's just like when it's
132:27 - smaller it looks so much faster 16 is 60
132:30 - yeah 16 is 60 sorry yeah he had sixteen
132:41 - point seven seven probably ffmpeg yeah I
132:46 - should do I was just trying to avoid
132:47 - like ffmpeg cuz it's like a whole thing
132:49 - people have to install gizmo calm easing
132:59 - is that for making gifts or that's for
133:02 - easing change the animation speed before
133:07 - you upload the image last time I use ten
133:11 - yeah I guess I could use Photoshop I
133:14 - just I wanted to use something that
133:15 - everybody could use not everybody will
133:17 - have Photoshop and not everybody all
133:24 - right let's try easy gift / maker that's
133:27 - another one use the gift comm slash
133:35 - maker try number 15 million all right
133:42 - let's try this
133:49 - okay let's try this
134:00 - alright I can't get have things make my
134:04 - oven joke one more time alright you can
134:16 - use yeah we're trying to do something
134:19 - that you don't have to install and you
134:21 - don't have to pay for although these
134:23 - things have like we're doing on ads on
134:24 - them but
134:37 - all right we'll try this okay all right
134:44 - so now that I've made all those images
134:45 - and save them to the output folder I'm
134:47 - going to try stitching them together as
134:49 - a gif
134:49 - I'm using this website called easy gift
134:52 - comm it's must be easy cuz it says so so
134:55 - I'm assuming this is gonna work great
134:57 - but there's lots of other ways you can
134:59 - use Photoshop you can use ffmpeg there's
135:02 - all sorts of different tools software
135:04 - tools you can use to stitch images
135:06 - together into a gif but let's see what
135:08 - happens if I select Choose files luckily
135:11 - for me it's already going straight to my
135:12 - output directory but you'd have to find
135:14 - that on your through the fear your
135:16 - through your finder or whatever operates
135:19 - that's music I'm gonna do select all I'm
135:20 - gonna click open and then I'm going to
135:23 - say upload and make a gif and this is
135:26 - gonna work right look so we can see well
135:32 - look at this we can see all of it the
135:34 - delay is 20 so 20 milliseconds would be
135:38 - I guess that's like somewhere between 30
135:41 - and 60 frames per second and somewhere
135:47 - here I should be able to say oh I can
135:51 - change the delay time so 60 frames per
135:53 - second would be like 16.7 let's just
135:54 - leave it at 20 loop count loop forever
135:57 - I'm not gonna worry I'm not gonna
135:59 - crossfade frames what's interesting that
136:01 - it has that effect let's try this make a
136:03 - gif oh but have to wait now it's baking
136:06 - the oven
136:23 - very slow
136:25 - oh that's in 1/100 of a second that's
136:36 - not milliseconds okay it says right
136:41 - there on the page in 1/100 of a second
136:44 - one one thousandth of a second is a
136:46 - millisecond so like 32 milliseconds of
136:49 - delay is like maybe around 30 let's make
136:52 - this three we want three one hundredth
136:54 - of a second let's just try that let's
136:56 - see what happens I mean you might want
136:58 - it slower but I want it to kind of like
136:59 - look like how it looked in processing so
137:00 - let me click this again there we go look
137:04 - there's my gift
137:05 - there's my gift is it perfectly looping
137:07 - sort of hard to tell but let's now I
137:09 - should be able to download it I can
137:10 - probably just like right click and do
137:12 - save image as and say put it on the
137:15 - desktop and then I can look at it here
137:20 - and there it is yay okay so you get the
137:28 - idea look what to showed you next I
137:32 - don't know if I really want to show you
137:34 - much more make a gif calm pictures to
137:41 - give
137:52 - okay now all right so you know
137:54 - ultimately the creativity of what you
137:57 - design is really the is is really the
138:01 - thing that I'm hoping that you will
138:03 - discover in yourself to make something I
138:05 - mean I've just made a rotating square
138:06 - but I think in order to be able to
138:08 - explore your creativity you're gonna
138:09 - need the tool you're working with to be
138:12 - a bit more flexible because right now
138:14 - the way that I set this up is it kind of
138:18 - runs it once and then quits but I really
138:21 - want to be able to watch the thing loop
138:24 - and if and then like change the code and
138:26 - run it again and change the code and run
138:27 - it again and then when I'm ready kind of
138:29 - hit record so let's do that this way
138:31 - what I could do that through an
138:32 - interface but I'm just gonna make a
138:34 - boolean variable called record and I'm
138:38 - gonna set that equal to right now I'm
138:39 - gonna set that equal to false okay so
138:42 - what I'm gonna say here is if um I'm
138:46 - gonna say float I'm gonna say float
138:48 - percent equals zero and this is very
138:50 - similar to Golan's
138:51 - if record then I am going to use this
138:57 - counter that I have and and then I am
139:06 - also going to do all this stuff like
139:08 - saving the frame otherwise I am just
139:13 - going to say percent equals float the
139:21 - actual frame count I mean I could always
139:23 - use the counter this is silly I should
139:24 - just always use the counter but frame
139:26 - count modulus total frames divided by
139:30 - total frames and so this should really
139:38 - be this is a little bit goofy but I'm
139:40 - gonna put the percentage around here the
139:42 - parentheses around there okay
139:44 - so let me give myself a little bit more
139:45 - room to look at this code this is a
139:46 - weird I gotta I gotta explain this for a
139:48 - second and why why why there we go okay
139:52 - so what I want to do here is I want to
139:56 - have the frame count always cycle back
139:58 - to zero and I want to which I use the
140:01 - modulo operator and I want
140:03 - then I want to divide that by total
140:05 - frames but I want to convert that into a
140:07 - float and so I don't need these extra
140:11 - parentheses or this parentheses yeah no
140:13 - yes
140:14 - this is what I want sorry about that
140:16 - this is what I want I want to do frame
140:19 - count modulus Topher this is so silly
140:21 - I'm just gonna use the counter for
140:22 - everything there is a built in frame
140:24 - count variable and so really uh so it's
140:33 - really just about what I'm using the
140:38 - modulus or not
140:48 - so now that recording is false this is
140:53 - just going to play the loop forever and
140:55 - ever again and I know that if I ever
140:57 - want to now record it right if I like my
141:01 - design I can go and delete what was
141:03 - there before which I don't have to it'll
141:04 - overwrite it and I can hit I can change
141:07 - recording to true and then I can run it
141:09 - it will do the recording and then it
141:12 - will quit out so there you go you know
141:21 - what there's a mistake here I am
141:24 - recording the last frame and I don't
141:27 - want to let's look at the let's look at
141:31 - the output here
141:33 - yeah 1:20 I don't want 120 because 119
141:38 - is the frame right before the starting
141:40 - frame the way that I've coded this so
141:42 - this say frame has to be here so that's
141:47 - a quick fix let me delete that again let
141:53 - me run this here goes record it's going
141:58 - to draw that last one but that's fine
142:00 - now we should see the very last four
142:05 - shouldn't it exit before it does that
142:09 - didn't
142:16 - all right well let's do it this way
142:18 - let's just check if it gets to the end
142:21 - if it gets to the end so frame before
142:25 - the last one then quit and now here we
142:33 - go
142:33 - ah that works I can see just based on
142:36 - where it stopped okay great so this is
142:39 - why why I want the last frame to match
142:41 - up before the first one okay great
142:44 - so there's so much other stuff we could
142:46 - do I could use like a sine wave again I
142:49 - would encourage you to look at different
142:52 - easing functions and try all sorts of
142:56 - different kinds of designs and your only
142:59 - limitation for yourself is that the end
143:01 - matches up with the beginning but
143:04 - matching up can mean a variety of
143:06 - different things because something can
143:07 - leave the window and then enter again so
143:10 - there's as long as the as long as
143:12 - there's a visual continuity your gif
143:15 - will loop so I will come back I will
143:17 - show you also how to do this in p5.js in
143:19 - the browser with a special new p5 gift
143:22 - library that I've been testing thanks to
143:25 - the creators of that library and I'll
143:26 - come back to show that to you in a
143:27 - future video and please share your gift
143:30 - loops we're gonna have them all over the
143:32 - place I don't know coding trained gift
143:34 - loop know what what should it be just
143:36 - share them just look at this video's
143:40 - description I'll explain how to share
143:41 - them good bye thank you
144:00 - it was 120 still there uh hold on and I
144:10 - just didn't delete it let's see let's
144:11 - see I'm pretty sure I deleted it I feel
144:16 - like I need to do this whole video again
144:21 - know then that weird it's even though it
144:25 - exits exit is like it must be
144:27 - asynchronous or something because it's
144:30 - it oh you know what it must say it must
144:32 - say it says exit when you get to the end
144:35 - of draw so draw it's probably more like
144:38 - an indicator like if I really did I
144:40 - wonder if I did like system exit zero or
144:45 - something yeah that worked
144:50 - interesting interesting so the
144:52 - processing exit function let make sure
144:54 - that draw finishes that's an interesting
144:58 - little tidbit make sure that draw
145:01 - finishes where system not exit actually
145:04 - forces the exit gift train but it's like
145:11 - a gift
145:38 - please share your gifts with me hashtag
145:41 - gift train it's like a gift in the rain
145:45 - see you next go to challenge good bye
145:59 - yeah I see what you mean this this is so
146:02 - flawed in so many ways but I'll decide
146:06 - if I need to come back and do this again
146:09 - all right let's make some more hearts oh
146:11 - it's one o'clock let's make a few more
146:16 - hearts oh I could say we returned that's
146:21 - a good idea let's make some more hearts
146:23 - so many hearts let's make some more
146:30 - hearts
146:43 - we can make it a gift loop all right
146:52 - okay
147:03 - all right everybody
147:38 - [Music]
147:53 - all right here we go it's time to finish
148:11 - up for this week
148:12 - oh I wanted to talk about the date of
148:14 - course I never get to it I really have
148:16 - to work on that oh my god oh my goodness
148:18 - oh my goodness all right do I need I'm
148:21 - not so sure that I need the board but in
148:25 - case that I do I guess I should erase I
148:32 - think that gift flute video is like kind
148:36 - of useless but we'll see you sometimes I
148:38 - think that and then I just I'm in my own
148:42 - head because and actually maybe there's
148:45 - a lot of stuff that's like new concepts
148:46 - for people okay all right I'm here to
149:01 - make some mathematical hearts look at
149:03 - these formulas if you plot these
149:04 - formulas you get a heart I mean what
149:06 - could be better than that this one here
149:07 - is might be my favorite although this
149:10 - one here is kind of interesting look at
149:11 - this so we could try any of these but I
149:14 - actually want to try something a little
149:15 - bit different here I mean I'm looking at
149:17 - this and I know what formula are there
149:18 - so what I'm about to is no in no way
149:21 - magic whatsoever but I want to try to
149:23 - get a little bit of an intuition for why
149:25 - that crazy formula makes a heart shape
149:28 - and how you might basically design your
149:31 - own parametric equations to generate
149:36 - different patterns so there are a
149:38 - variety of different techniques for this
149:39 - oh look rotated cardioid and we could
149:45 - just graph the cardia I just with like
149:47 - one minus sine of theta
149:48 - oh so many ways it could make the
149:50 - cardioid but let's let's let's go to
149:52 - processing my happy place my love my
149:55 - true love processing can I put like
149:57 - emojis in the in the comments
150:05 - hold on
150:07 - heart emoji Matt you you're gonna edit
150:10 - this part out let's just see if I do
150:12 - copy mmm no I cannot put emojis in the
150:21 - comments it's so sad how do you what did
150:27 - we do before there were emojis like this
150:29 - right okay
150:34 - now that we've gotten that out of the
150:35 - way that was a very important I'm gonna
150:37 - go back to the curb thing so first thing
150:40 - that I want to do is this is going to be
150:41 - a lot easier if I think of everything as
150:46 - oriented around the center of the window
150:48 - so I'm gonna translate the corner of the
150:50 - origins in the top-left then translate
150:52 - to the center by the way this channel I
150:54 - shouldn't call it the kodi train I
150:55 - should just call it here's another
150:57 - example of things you can do with polar
150:59 - coordinates based like every video I
151:01 - make it's the same but maybe that's the
151:04 - theme for this week so now what I want
151:06 - to do is I want to loop around all of
151:08 - the points of a circle you'll see you'll
151:11 - see why it's like I want to basically I
151:13 - want to say float on a four float a
151:17 - which will answer angle I'm gonna start
151:18 - at zero I'm gonna go all the way up to 2
151:20 - pi and I'm gonna go buy some increment
151:22 - I'm gonna pick that arbitrarily oh there
151:24 - might be reasons why I want to pick
151:25 - different increments at some point so
151:27 - I'm gonna have every angle from 0 to 2pi
151:29 - and I'm also going to make up a variable
151:32 - called R which is kind of like radius
151:34 - let's just go 200 right now and I'm
151:37 - gonna say once again here we go
151:39 - sing it with me it's the polar two
151:42 - Cartesian coordinates song auto-tune and
151:46 - the Internet will fix that for me R
151:48 - times cosine of the angle y equals R
151:51 - times sine of the angle what I want to
151:54 - do here is I'm gonna say no fill and
151:56 - Stroke 255 and begin shape because what
152:00 - I want to do is create my own custom
152:02 - shape based on all of these points
152:05 - oriented around this circular path
152:06 - hopefully this will all start to make
152:08 - more sense to you so then I can call
152:09 - vertex X Y and then I can say and shape
152:13 - and I can run this and you have this a
152:16 - circle
152:18 - I have made a circle the circle and and
152:21 - by the way if I were to change this
152:22 - increment value to something much higher
152:25 - you can sort of well let's make it like
152:27 - much more extreme you can see here like
152:33 - I'm I'm actually just moving around the
152:36 - edges of a circle and if I thought more
152:38 - carefully about like two pi divided by
152:41 - six then I might have a hexagon all
152:43 - sorts of possibilities like that right
152:44 - two pi divided by six there we go nice
152:51 - little hexagon there but this is not
152:52 - what I'm doing I am just tracing the
152:55 - contours of the circle now here's the
152:58 - thing I can start to futz with these
153:01 - equations for example what if I wanted
153:04 - to pinch a little bit
153:08 - hold on pause for a second you can put
153:15 - an emoji in JavaScript
153:24 - sorry I'm seeing some comments of other
153:26 - equations yeah this is the one that I'm
153:27 - doing the system 1 Simon
153:42 - okay sorry
153:52 - all right
153:55 - so what if what I wanted to do is like
153:58 - pinch the shape a little bit so
154:00 - interestingly enough what if I say like
154:02 - cosine of a times cosine of a let's see
154:05 - what that does
154:06 - Oh weird so you could see what that's
154:08 - doing I'm squaring the value so it's
154:11 - kind of squishing it a little bit long
154:13 - the x-axis but of course everything is
154:16 - on the right side because if I square
154:17 - negative I get a positive but I could go
154:19 - to the third power so why don't I say
154:21 - power of cosine of the angle to the
154:25 - third power
154:26 - look at this so you can see that even
154:29 - just doing that gets me this diamond
154:31 - like quality so that could that's really
154:35 - working for the bottom of the heart in a
154:37 - way that's the bottom of the heart but I
154:38 - need to change the top so I need to
154:40 - think about what I'm doing with the Y so
154:43 - again I'm just kind of this is vary in
154:45 - many ways like similar to my Fourier
154:48 - transform epicycles videos there's like
154:50 - conceptually tied here in that I'm
154:53 - messing with the oscillating values as I
154:55 - move around this kind of circular path
154:58 - now let's do something else like let's
155:01 - say well what if I take sine and I
155:07 - multiply the Y value what if I kind of
155:10 - multiply itself by sine of the angle but
155:14 - have like the frequency doubled so if I
155:21 - do this right well that's interesting
155:24 - look what kind of shape I get there hmm
155:27 - what if I multiply it by like a much
155:31 - more extreme amount like five whoa look
155:36 - at that
155:36 - so things are starting to happen and
155:39 - probably actually what would be much
155:41 - smarter for me to try to visually
155:42 - demonstrate this I have to think about
155:44 - this would be to animate the process of
155:46 - this and actually show the separate X
155:48 - and wha X's and Y's moving in similar to
155:51 - the Fourier transform videos but I'm
155:53 - going to kind of move from here and I'm
155:56 - looking over here because I'm I have the
155:58 - actual formula from that Wolfram page
156:00 - that I started with you can sort of see
156:02 - here okay ah look if I have and this is
156:06 - actually using sine 4x + cosine 4 but I
156:09 - think that's just gonna like put it on
156:10 - its side
156:11 - probably but let's let's let's um so
156:16 - let's put some more stuff in here to
156:17 - like think about let's look at this so
156:19 - five times starting with 13 times okay
156:24 - so changing the amplitudes as well so if
156:27 - we do this times a times well let's just
156:40 - give train yes spen it is gift tree I
156:44 - probably should have just put the
156:46 - formula in I don't know why I'm doing it
156:48 - this way I thought this would be
156:49 - interesting classic villain mustache the
157:01 - chat is saying that instead of a heart
157:03 - I've made a classic villain mustache all
157:05 - right I think it's time for me probably
157:06 - just to put the formula in I'm sort of
157:08 - interesting to explore the different
157:10 - possibilities here but ultimately if I'm
157:12 - seeing this equation what I want is
157:14 - third why these interesting numbers
157:16 - right well I'll get to that in a second
157:18 - but let's do cosine of T or - minus - I
157:21 - don't want to multiply this stuff
157:22 - together losing my mind here so I want
157:25 - to subtract out ah yes so as I'm getting
157:28 - to the top depending okay so this makes
157:30 - sense so let's let's actually put this
157:32 - stuff in let's change this to cosine
157:35 - let's change this to sign right no let's
157:38 - change this to sine sorry let's change
157:40 - this to cosine because I already have
157:41 - done that and then I'm going to say
157:43 - cosine and this is like I've got a 2 a 3
157:46 - and a 4 2 minus a 3 minus a 4 so you can
157:59 - see what's going on here but I need to
158:01 - see you could see that it's now actually
158:02 - a little bit more squished at that at
158:04 - the bottom then at the top and so what
158:07 - might be interesting here is to think of
158:08 - you know this as well if this is our and
158:13 - then maybe I want R times 2 times this
158:16 - oh look at that because now when it
158:18 - comes to
158:19 - I you can start to see the heart oh but
158:21 - it's upside down so I kind of want
158:23 - negative one times the whole thing
158:26 - because of the way the processing
158:27 - coordinate system is we can say look
158:30 - I've kind of getting a heart there but
158:31 - I've gone to extreme so I should
158:34 - probably get rid of this our thing let's
158:35 - just make r1 and use the actual numbers
158:37 - so we the actual numbers in the formula
158:40 - are 13 5 2 so I can say 13 5 whoops 5
158:51 - times
158:53 - whoa 13 5 2 and then a cosine of for a
159:01 - just has is not multiplied by any factor
159:03 - so now if I do this
159:09 - let's put parentheses around what am I
159:11 - doing here got too many parentheses here
159:14 - this there we go I look there's the
159:20 - heart and then now I could scale it up
159:27 - by a factor I mean I could just use the
159:29 - scale function but I could have you know
159:32 - basically scale it up by 10 and then I
159:34 - could say negative R times that and
159:35 - there we go so now you have made the
159:38 - heart let's animate it this was very
159:39 - silly my whole like trying to walk into
159:41 - this formula really I just want to like
159:42 - look it up but let's animate it let's
159:44 - have it trace the path of a heart
159:46 - because that'll be really nice so what
159:48 - I'm going to do now is I'm going to
159:50 - create a an ArrayList of P vector
159:54 - objects so if I were doing this in
159:59 - JavaScript this would be a much simpler
160:01 - just plain array and then what I'm going
160:05 - to do is I am going to not have this
160:08 - loop anymore but rather have a global
160:10 - variable called a and I am going to do
160:17 - this same exact thing but I am going to
160:21 - say here that the for loop sorry the for
160:25 - loop will be for every P vector V in the
160:31 - heart
160:33 - draw vertex at V X V Y and then what I'm
160:39 - going to do is each time through draw I
160:43 - am going to make a new vector I'm going
160:47 - to say heart dot add new P vector at
160:53 - some X&Y and then I'm going to increase
160:59 - the angle by a little bit so here we go
161:09 - okay with math I'm so happy my artistic
161:22 - talent is non-existent but let's at
161:25 - least make the stroke weight a little
161:27 - thicker let's let's add a fill someone
161:32 - give me a nice red color but I feel like
161:35 - it should be like a little bit more a
161:37 - little darker and a little pinkish so
161:40 - let's try that and let's make sure I add
161:44 - clothes here so it closes the shape whoa
161:47 - oh no no no no I do not want clothes I
161:51 - specifically do not want clothes yes
161:54 - that's what I want and now we are making
161:57 - this heart so I challenge you to go and
162:11 - look at these other formulas and try
162:14 - them I'm Simon Tiger has shared with me
162:16 - a ton of other formulism of maybe I'll
162:18 - see if any of those I want to try but
162:20 - you find a formula and make your own
162:22 - heart could you do it in 3d I bet you
162:24 - could make a 3d heart all sorts of stuff
162:26 - and share that with me coding hearts
162:30 - hash tag coding hearts coding love for
162:33 - this wonderful any day of the year we
162:36 - could be making we should be making
162:37 - hearts all day of the year
162:38 - no reason to just do it in February when
162:40 - it's cold outside
162:41 - almost like
162:42 - snow and sleet and everything anyway I
162:43 - love you thanks for watching the coding
162:46 - train and I'll see you soon
162:50 - it looks a little messy at the bottom
162:53 - how dare you yeah it does how dare you
162:56 - insult my heart they think it's probably
163:03 - cuz I have just too many points down
163:05 - there yeah that's better
163:11 - combining this with the fourier stuff
163:13 - would be good
163:23 - [Music]
163:26 - here here everybody our is a height
163:36 - divided by maybe like it's four hundred
163:39 - before he got ten so divided by forty
163:42 - let's try that oh this would be a good
163:48 - gift loop let's make the gift loop
163:52 - everybody hold on okay we're gonna make
163:59 - this a gift loop it's winter it's a
164:02 - snowflake yes I see that you have some
164:14 - 3d formulas in yours Simon that is
164:16 - fantastic I don't think I'm gonna get to
164:18 - those today but I really appreciate your
164:20 - your your suggestions you should make
164:25 - them and you should make a video about
164:26 - all your different heart formulas
164:28 - alright hold on hold on okay so hold on
164:39 - it's time for coding train
164:43 - I made this ridiculously terrible video
164:47 - about how to make a gift loop and you
164:49 - should really just go look at Golan
164:50 - Levin's amazing resources and different
164:52 - artists that I mentioned saskia freak
164:53 - and bees and bombs who are doing
164:55 - wonderful things then I made this video
164:57 - which I actually kind of love that makes
164:58 - a heart in-processing just using like a
165:01 - nice little math formula look at that
165:02 - each time to make a gift loop of the
165:06 - heart for Valentine's Day there I said
165:08 - it's Valentine's Day this is what we're
165:09 - doing alright so first that I need is
165:11 - for this to always end where it started
165:13 - so I have an idea for doing that which
165:16 - is that if what I'm doing is I'm adding
165:19 - these I'm adding the vertices of the
165:23 - heart over and over again when I get to
165:25 - the end all I want to do is start
165:27 - deleting the ones from the beginning so
165:29 - I should go back to that idea of percent
165:33 - so let me actually open up my other
165:36 - so I'm going to open up the gift loop
165:39 - code this is my design so what I need is
165:44 - this at the top I'm gonna go have too
165:49 - many things open oh oh my goodness
165:52 - I need this at the top then I need all
165:58 - my drawing stuff in I should leave that
166:03 - in there I mean oh my Dino I'm standing
166:05 - from the code but I'm just copy pasting
166:07 - from the last one and we get all my
166:09 - drawing stuff and I'm gonna put it in
166:12 - the render function and now the percent
166:16 - the percent is going to tell me what to
166:19 - do with a so that angle I'm gonna have
166:27 - to change legs so let's just first do it
166:28 - this way a equals map percent which goes
166:32 - between 0 and 1/2 between 0 and 2pi so
166:37 - right now if I run this with record and
166:40 - let me let me close this this should
166:42 - just be I've got my gift loop we just
166:46 - move everything out of the way I've got
166:49 - my gift loop here and I want record to
166:52 - false I don't want to record yet so now
166:54 - if I run this we can see it's making the
166:57 - heart oh oh right and then done okay so
167:04 - that's the right idea but it's not
167:05 - looping because ultimately I mean
167:08 - there's a bunch of things I could do
167:09 - because I could say if I record it I
167:12 - mean in a way I'm getting a loop but I
167:14 - want it to like shrink back down to 0 so
167:17 - I need the size so basically I want % I
167:21 - want this to be like actually 1% is
167:25 - between 0 and 0.5 halfway through I want
167:30 - to draw the heart so I'm going to say
167:33 - this is weird but if % is greater than
167:37 - 0.5 is less than 0.5 less than or equal
167:40 - to 0.5
167:42 - there's probably a better way to do this
167:44 - but I'm going to do it this way right
167:45 - now I'm going to add points
167:49 - otherwise I want to remove the number of
167:54 - points that I've added and I think it
167:57 - actually is just gonna work if I just
167:59 - say heart dot how do I get delete
168:02 - something out of I think if I just
168:05 - delete 0 that'll be like the oldest one
168:10 - as I get so let's try that that removes
168:17 - them all what's going on here oh but I
168:21 - still need to draw I always need to draw
168:23 - it ah so I'm always drawing it no matter
168:27 - what but I'm adding points for the first
168:30 - half and removing points for the second
168:32 - half there we go there's my loop okay so
168:38 - now guess what I should make to add some
168:42 - colors and things oh it should beat
168:44 - people are saying it should beat of
168:46 - course it should be okay okay we're
168:48 - gonna have we're gonna add beating to it
168:49 - okay so there's no reason why the size
168:53 - the size is being controlled by this
168:54 - thing are here so I should say map okay
169:05 - hold on the Wow oh wow no that's a
169:10 - totally separate thing while I'm drawing
169:11 - it ah so hold on so let's so actually
169:16 - let's take this out let's take this so
169:20 - this should this will make it small
169:21 - right right so that makes it small so I
169:24 - can control the size here just while I'm
169:26 - drawing it because I could say R times R
169:29 - times great so now what I want is the R
169:35 - to be so I want an angle to be mapped
169:39 - but the percent between 0 and 1 and
169:43 - maybe between 0 and like 2 pi but like
169:46 - times 4 like I probably want it to like
169:48 - beat like 4 times within just the 1 so
169:52 - I'm going to map that and then our
169:53 - equals
169:54 - map of sine of that angle which goes
169:58 - between negative 1 & 1/2 between like
170:02 - height divided by eighty to height
170:06 - divided by forty so I think this would
170:08 - like map the Sun whose size to a sine
170:11 - wave and the angle is getting mapped
170:13 - from the percent and so this would be
170:15 - and it should be a perfect loop of it
170:19 - beating okay I feel like I need to add
170:22 - more color and stuff to this and kind of
170:24 - off-center all right so let's see if
170:26 - this is a perfect loop I have no idea if
170:28 - it's a perfect loop its we if something
170:30 - was weird about it oh something is weird
170:34 - it's not deleting all the points this is
170:38 - crazy this is actually kind of a nice
170:40 - effect but I'm not deleting all of the
170:45 - points I did and am I just getting like
170:47 - some left over hold on let's make our I
170:51 - think I thought the math would just sort
170:53 - of work out let's let's take out the
170:59 - beating for a second whoa
171:07 - oh yeah it's not you could see there's
171:10 - like an extra point each time so it
171:12 - actually kind of works the first time
171:13 - but I think I need to remove else remove
171:19 - the heart and then I think actually here
171:27 - if where do I check I guess if percent
171:35 - is it gonna get to exactly one point oh
171:37 - let's say greater than or equal to I
171:39 - mean then heart dot clear
171:47 - no it's still getting an extra point
171:49 - Oh weird why is that point in there that
171:52 - doesn't else heart remove wait I have to
171:57 - think about this first I came close look
172:06 - at that 3d heart the point four percent
172:13 - equals 0.5 yeah
172:18 - right right this is flawed I mean I
172:27 - think it'll actually work when I record
172:30 - it because it's just doing it the first
172:32 - time but I would like it to actually
172:34 - loop
172:43 - I'm just thinking about this here
172:47 - otherwise remove let's just just be sure
172:57 - this is the issue all the way down to
172:59 - three all the way down to four yeah it's
173:06 - got extra points in it so why if I the
173:12 - why they're not the same number of
173:14 - frames oh it's as simple as that it's as
173:27 - simple as that guess what the problem is
173:35 - I'm adding an extra I'm adding that last
173:39 - vertex twice because I have less than
173:42 - equals there so this is actually as
173:44 - simple as just getting rid of that
173:46 - equals there I just want to use percent
173:47 - is less than 0.5 I'm sure somebody in
173:49 - the chat already said this but now you
173:51 - can see this loops perfectly so now what
173:55 - I can do is I can change let's make sure
174:00 - there's nothing in output let's delete
174:02 - whatever is there before I can change
174:05 - record to true I can run this and now we
174:13 - should see if I look in output if I look
174:16 - at all the images and I scroll through
174:19 - them and let's just look at the very
174:21 - last one you can see yep
174:23 - it's kind of that's the end of it so now
174:26 - I can go and I'm like edit this part out
174:29 - but I'm gonna go to where we can speed
174:33 - this up and I'm gonna go to what was the
174:34 - website I used easy gif maker yes so I'm
174:37 - gonna go to this website easy gift com
174:39 - I'm going to choose some files I don't
174:43 - need to I'm gonna wear tonight where is
174:46 - this now or these the hearts yes those
174:50 - are the hearts I mean hit open and
174:52 - upload and make a gift
174:56 - it's got those files I am now going to
174:59 - change the delay time to let's just make
175:02 - it three that seemed good from before
175:04 - three one hundreds of a second make a
175:06 - gif my cat is there making the gif
175:10 - making the gift oh the beating the heart
175:12 - beating cute so I'm gonna go from where
175:21 - I hear so let me also add the heart
175:24 - beating back in I'm gonna add where was
175:27 - that so now I'm gonna add the heart
175:29 - beating back in where I had our change
175:32 - and that oh I uh
176:02 - what time is it all right perfect
176:08 - let me add the heart beating back in so
176:11 - I had that from before where I had are
176:14 - mapped to the result of a sine function
176:16 - and so if I do that I'm pretty sure this
176:21 - is the perfect loop still is that
176:24 - beating too fast slower beating people
176:27 - are saying so it's a slowdown the
176:29 - beating I'm gonna just do 2 pi times 2
176:33 - is that better I think that's pretty
176:40 - good anyway you can work on you can make
176:42 - your own version of this this is fine
176:44 - for me right now I gotta end this video
176:46 - I am now gonna change record to true I'm
176:49 - going to hit run it's going to finish
176:53 - that I'm gonna look in the folder and I
176:56 - can see I have all the images there I'm
176:58 - just going to check the last one which
177:00 - looks like that and the first one yeah I
177:04 - think this will match up perfectly which
177:07 - basically the first one is empty so I
177:08 - think coming all the way down to zero
177:10 - and back up will work so I'm gonna go
177:12 - the website that I used whoops hold on
177:19 - so the website that I used before
177:21 - although there's a variety different
177:22 - ways you can make a gift stitched out of
177:24 - a bunch of images is this gif maker easy
177:28 - gift calm slash maker so I can click
177:31 - Choose files and I can go to my output
177:34 - directory where I have all those I can
177:35 - hit command a select all the files and
177:39 - then click upload and make a gift so
177:41 - it's now uploading all those images and
177:43 - we can see them all here now I could do
177:46 - all sorts of things to futz with them
177:47 - and I'm curious to add this crossfade
177:49 - frames let's try adding that Oh better
177:51 - bad idea I don't know let's make the
177:53 - delay time 3 100 of a second that's more
177:56 - like 30 frames per second and then it's
177:59 - not exact and then I'm gonna click make
178:00 - a gif and then the cat is going to wait
178:03 - for my gift
178:10 - oh and Mike if it's ready yeah now I can
178:23 - just do save image as and I'm gonna I'm
178:28 - excited to tweet this heart and I'll
178:38 - tweet it later there we go
178:40 - this is done there's my no that's not it
178:42 - where'd I put it hard kiss there it is
178:46 - thank you everybody
178:47 - I love you I hope you enjoyed this
178:50 - special about using special this vid me
178:53 - up about using Matt to draw a heart
178:55 - curve and then animating it as a
178:58 - infinitely looping gif and I I just
179:01 - can't wait to see all of different I
179:02 - just want to be flooded with heart gifts
179:04 - just flood me with art gifts make three
179:07 - big good 3d make them rainbow colors put
179:09 - stars in them and cupcakes and whatever
179:12 - you can think of I'll see you in a
179:13 - future coding challenge good bye MA oh
179:18 - wait what's uh what's the difference
179:26 - [Music]
179:31 - okay
179:37 - oh I love that 3d heart picture okay
179:43 - all right everybody yes finally kid Gopi
179:47 - says baa Raghava choked claw that's how
179:51 - I feel as well finally I can go drink I
179:53 - forgot to bring water with me today so
179:55 - I'm excited there's a bunch of videos
179:57 - that can come out and I will see you in
180:04 - Ojai Cody garden with CJ in the chat
180:06 - everyone should check out Cody garden or
180:08 - CJ's channel oh let me do some anymore
180:11 - thank yous that I might have missed okay
180:16 - let's thank you to all the other people
180:18 - watched art gift train and I don't know
180:23 - I think I'm done for today I will be
180:25 - back next Wednesday I'm gonna check my
180:27 - calendar but this is my plan now if
180:29 - you're watching this right now I am
180:30 - going to try to have at least for the
180:32 - next few weeks every week so the way
180:35 - that I work until someone tells me not
180:37 - to do this this way anymore is I do a
180:38 - livestream every Wednesday at 10:30 I do
180:41 - a bunch of things during the livestream
180:43 - and then a wonderful Matua Blanchette
180:46 - who works as the editor for the coding
180:48 - train takes everything from the
180:49 - livestream and chops it into separate
180:51 - smaller videos which then get uploaded
180:52 - into different playlists where there's
180:54 - coding challenges or courses I actually
180:56 - made a video yesterday that was not
180:58 - livestream it's like a little extra
180:59 - beginner lesson about create graphics
181:01 - and p5 so I might even upload that this
181:03 - afternoon but I just want to highlight
181:05 - I'm really I think I'm like a little bit
181:07 - stuck here data and api's Schiffman
181:10 - github please come and look let me just
181:16 - go to oh no it's on coding train github
181:19 - I am planning I should pin that repo
181:24 - here it is already pinned I am hoping to
181:28 - make a new playlist and I've been
181:30 - getting suggestions and discussions
181:32 - about what I might include in this think
181:34 - it's probably gonna be approximately 10
181:35 - to 15 videos and I want to cover really
181:39 - about I'm working with data and API is
181:41 - in JavaScript so things I haven't
181:42 - covered before or things that I covered
181:44 - before that are kind of out of date now
181:45 - from with for a total beginner but the
181:48 - focus won't necessarily be p5
181:50 - so I will also teach about the fetch
181:52 - function and also look at data API is in
181:54 - node and I will use p5 to do some
181:57 - drawing stuff but I'm at some point I
181:59 - gotta make an outline but if you have
182:02 - suggestions or things that would be good
182:04 - bite-size beginner and data sets I'm
182:06 - looking for cuz I want to look at
182:07 - something with like a CSV data set a
182:09 - mapping data set and maybe a news API
182:13 - these are the kind of things I want to
182:14 - look at okay thank you everybody I will
182:19 - see you next Wednesday or on the various
182:21 - uploads that come I'm so thrilled to
182:24 - have this strange thing happened to me
182:26 - in my life that I am here making videos
182:29 - on YouTube about coding with and and
182:31 - getting to be completely ridiculous if I
182:33 - feel like it which nobody seems to have
182:35 - complain about too much I get complaints
182:37 - a lot of people are like you should you
182:38 - should take yourself more seriously
182:40 - and/or like what kind of like whatever
182:42 - substance are you using to be this weird
182:44 - way that you are and I can assure you
182:46 - that it is just a mild chemical ginger
182:49 - tea tea and caffeine I do I do drink a
182:51 - lot of things with caffeine in it
182:53 - alright good bye
182:54 - I am going to sing you out with s new
182:57 - member s Ben
183:04 - oh wait wait wait wait
183:11 - Matt Chia always says give me some green
183:16 - screenshots of four thumbnails because
183:24 - look it's my invisible computer this is
183:35 - what people this I'm really just going
183:37 - for clicks right clickbait clickbait
183:39 - expressions alright that's good enough
184:15 - goodbye everybody

Cleaned transcript:

hello my stream oh yes I am attracts me like no other function I can't I can't get anything right I don't want to stop coding now this song is dedicated to processing my first love my true huh happy February 13th one of my favorite days of the year I did you hear that rattle at least the ukulele it has a weird rattle and so me being the mechanically minded person that I am I'm very mechanically you know really good with tools and building and putting things together that's sarcasm you hear my voice I found this screwdriver and I tried tightening all these different screws that I found all over this thing but I don't know still rattles so if anybody wants to submit other love ODEs to processing or maybe to p5.js or other types of programming things I will sync those later on today's heart themed coding training episode alright so welcome good morning my name is Dan and Buster the Kotick train this is a live YouTube stream that now happens every Wednesday at 1030 a.m. Eastern believe that I have an actual regularly scheduled time so all of you been asking just come here next week at this exact time and I will be here except for when I cancel or something happens there's like a snowstorm or a mistake or like beating came up that day that day hopefully no I haven't I can't bring myself to actually put on the top on the YouTube banner like every went live every Wednesday at 1030 a.m. because I'm afraid that will jinx myself but that's what that's my plan so yeah people are eric is asking shouldn't the yellow colors fade to blue as time goes on Oh alexandros I think hey it's probably from the nut or the action you should check the trust rod I have no idea what any of that stuff is I hope you're not that's not like but that probably has to do with parts of the ukulele so yes so this is a this is the result of the coding challenge that I did last week and I don't remember where what the settings here are somewhat arbitrary in terms of the fading and let me in terms of some of these values let me run this again so I kind of wanted to continue with this this week but I don't know things didn't go well for me in the last week after putting this code together but I do want to talk about how I still want to do some follow up videos about that so let me begin by talking a little bit about fluid simulation and where my head is at with that so I want to want to talk about a few things so this is what you're seeing here is the result of me porting code from my cache it's a blog post called fluid dynamics or fluid simulation or something like that for dummies that code that blog post was written based on the seminal paper from 2003 I think realtime fluid Amyx for games from by jos stam and so this is like kind of a 15th generation version of that in processing and it works in this nice way to create this fluid like feeling I mean feels looks the visual appearance here is much more like smoke but with changing the way you render the design changing with various parameters of the design you could probably create a variety of different kinds of fluid like simulations however this is not many people have gone before me to create versions of this in more thoughtful and sophisticated ways so my original plan was just to port the code which I did the next step I was going to try to refactor the code and I started working on that a little bit I want to show you where I got to because maybe some of you might have some suggestions so I'm gonna go to github.com slash Schiffman slash CFD the CFD stands for computational fluid dynamics and these were some like these were some like test bits of code that I put together before I did the actual live stream if you want to find the actual code from the live stream you can just go to here you will see the video here this is on the coding training comm this link will take you ups this link will take you to the code and then one person who this is exciting we have one community contribution so let's take a look at this community contribution really quickly from Juan Carlos Punk's Campuzano flow around circle incompressible non viscous fluid I love this so this looks like it is a particle based fluid simulation which is really where I want to get to with all this stuff and you can see the path of these dots kind of moving around this circle can I move that circle I can move the circle that's kind of cool I might suggest it sort of surprised me that it went the color of the background when I clicked it so I might if I were giving my quick offthecuff feedback here I might consider a different color change or when I click and drag but I can let's try let's click on trace so that's cool so we can see the trails of these particles let's click on speed oh it says drag circle right there what does radius do Oh that makes the radius of this interesting only much smaller so let's make that big let me drag it around cool so that's great so I'd be curious to look and III would want I would love some documentation here about and I wonder it's probably in the source code if I click here some documentation about what what what algorithms led you to this particular simulation or did you invent them yourself or what was the sort of technique employed here that's terrific okay so but where I was getting to is over here I started refactoring the code and if we look at my code from last week which is just again a port of other people's code what you'll see is that we go here to the fluid class what you'll see is all of the data that's part of this fluid simulation is a set of six different individual arrays there is a velocity vector associated with each spot on the canvas each spot on that grid of pixels and that velocity vector is described by an X and a y this zero notate the sort of previous velocity vector so we always need to know historically what was the velocity before this moment in time and this is very common a lot of different cellular automata algorithms that involve data on a grid and then also there's this idea of density which which I might think about renaming to die because it's the amount of dye at any spot in the fluid and that's how we end up visualizing whether we're using we've mapped that amount of dye to a hue or to a brightness value and then s is the previous amount of dye so I had this idea that let me let me and I was gonna do this live but I thought I would just try the first steps of it which you can see here and I am this is my fluid refactor and if I go here I had this idea okay well what if I had like this idea of a velocity object and it was actually a P vector object and the velocity object knew a current velocity in a previous velocity so a I'm just like trying to get some new variable aiming to make the code a bit more readable but also if and then if I had a dye object which would just be a scalar so the velocity object is a vector the dye object is a scalar and then this would allow me to have the fluid class have just these two arrays like the array of velocities in the array of dyes and then I could start the code would sort of like simplify into like this I kept going down this road and this is this doesn't work but then this is my idea oh then I could apply the different steps of this particular simulation diffusion projection diffuse project Advent and I would diffuse and project the velocity and add back to project the velocity and diffuse and add back the density and then I started realizing the whole way the code is written if we go into those functions that perform these operations is to operate off of a single generic array so I guess I could overload the fun of two different versions of each functions whether they're getting a vector or an array then I started to get lost and I was like I don't know the best way to do this and that was like late at night last videos but I got the live stream about this tomorrow morning so I you know I rather than take up all of today's live stream trying to refactor this code what I'm asking for you is your suggestion so if you're watching this right now and I want to think about this have some ideas for me let me know let me know because my goal is to refactor it in a way that's more readable maybe turn it into a library maybe ported the JavaScript maybe optimize it there's lots of possibilities here but then I was sort of thinking what am I doing here am I really the person in the world who's going to invent a new fluid simulation like library and algorithm and organize it I mean probably not to me maybe and certainly with the help that I've found with this wonderful internet community of people who watch this channel I'm sure there are lots lots of people watching who really could thoughtfully contribute this idea but there are many other there are this is not a new idea and in fact researching this a bit more I found another library called pixel flow it's last commit was pretty recent so that does it oh no that's not pretty that's a year ago last commit was a year ago but you can see it has a lot of functionality for this these ideas and if you you can download and I actually ran some these examples which are quite oh here we go which you can see are quite exciting and amazing so this is an interesting possibility for me to look into actually just using a library where all of this has already been sort of refactored and reorganized in a way that makes it useful for for like making the projects there is also MSA fluid which is a library that I used many years ago which is the exact same algorithm that I implemented but thoughtfully packaged into a library but not currently compatible with processing 3 I quickly checked I think this would require a small amount of work work that I could actually to to update it to work with processing 3 more easily so that's a possibility but the I've been in touch a little bit with Gabriel Y mouth let me find Gabriel y mouth on Twitter Gabriel y mouth is a researcher specifically in fluid structure interactions and based in the UK this is the website and Gabriel y mouth has created something called a lilypad processing which is and and let me just download this I'm gonna let's let's take a moment because this will actually just run right off the bat so I want to show this to you because this is really really phenomenal and why why why is my zsh broken let me actually go to the desktop and let me clone this repo real quick let me open here and let me open this up in processing i'm gonna go to lily pad lily pad and i'm gonna run this so look at this let me zoom into this here we can see we've got a really excellent and more dynamic and probably accurate fluid fluid simulation and there's so much there's so much to this like this this quick demo this is like scratching the surface of what this example I don't know what to call it example demo open source code project does but to me and and there's and it's really well organized thoughtfully in an objectoriented fashion but for for me to use it and to like there's just like so much going on here and is probably fairly well documented here documentation on the solver guides are contributing the project simple instructions there's lots of documentation here but what I think might be useful would be to turn this into a processing library and by that I mean something that I can do actually just through here import library add library for example if I look for a pixel flow is it here yeah pixel flow is right here so I'm gonna I'm gonna find pixel flow in the libraries I'm gonna hit install I'm gonna install it and then let me go find one of the pixel flow examples so I can go over to examples and I can go to contributed libraries and go to pixel flow so we can pick any of these let's just try fluid 2d fluid basic and then we can run this and ah so look at this the package control p5 doesn't exist which means this is dependent on another library let me quit this these by the way because they're so sketch import library add library I'm gonna add control p5 which is an interface library which it's much harder to do interface elements in an elegant and flexible way and processing in p5.js because you're in the browser being able to manipulate text boxes and buttons and sliders and and and and create an interface there's so many more possibilities given the rich set of features that a browser affords okay so let me now try running this again so there we go okay so we can see this is a similar idea of yet another fluid simulation example so so this is where I'm struggling with how to how to move forward first of all I got a lot of stuff a fluid simulation I'm so fascinated by it I want to oh I want to but so one path which of my original path was to kind of refactor my code make it a little bit try to understand how the algorithms work a little bit more and explain those things that will take some time and research on my part which is a little atypical for how I do things which is more fly by the seat of my pants so that's one possibility the other possibility would be to leave that fluid video alone and go straight to using a library whether it's pixel flow NS a fluid or lily pad all three so that's what I'm looking for thoughts and suggestions about but I'm going to leave that now I'm I'm like looking over here and I'm seeing some would say he is not looking at chat question mark so no I am not looking at jack except for every once in a while when I to look at the chat okay so I want to put that aside and today I want to focus on the heart let me quit this okay wait oh let's also go and go to the DVD logo challenge since there were several community contributions let's take a look at some of these so let's look first at bouncing DVD logo by Bruno in 3d that's pretty great that's pretty awesome thank you for submitting that let's look at verlet DVD logo by Anurag this is cool so look so add rope there we go so now these are looks like on Iraq who created this actually made an entire verlan physics library Berlet J yes I typically have used toxic lips yes for my veux lip physics that's really cool to see the thing about alternative physics for this DVD video bouncing 90s screensaver look beautiful let's see what else do we got here bouncing DVD with corner detection and more oh look at this I love this so it's counting the number of collisions the number of corners the corner threshold I guess is like how close does it have to be the size is the size of the logo the speed let's make it go fast all right come on everyone ah would hit the corner I missed it and then changeable speed track and hit the corner detection by temporary pride I like this press T to enable/disable the track of the logo cool scroll the mouse wheel to speed oh I love that I can scroll the mouse wheel which speeds it up or slows it down and background switches if the logo hits the corner logo color switches if the logo hits the edge ah so we know if it hits the corner I'd at the corner if the logo at the edge wonderful okay so thanks for those I'm really trying to spend more time keeping this site up and so each coding challenge has a card first of all thank you to all the people who have contributed to this website this is not a project I made or designed it myself this is a community developed project let me just go to github here and click on contributors and I you know rather than rather than name people I can like just sort of scroll here and we can see a lot of people who have contributed to this website so there's actually another project which is a sort of like coding train website 2.0 that's on the horizon but what I my goal is to really have a place for the community to be able to share work that they're doing and for me to also make sure I'm crediting all the different sources and things that I use so for each and YouTube description works and the playlists work to some extent but this is basically each challenge has a card if I go here I'm gonna go to the DVD logo one or actual let me just go to this Fourier transform one so if I go to the challenge this is the video obviously but you can see here's the code there will be on the my goal is to have p5.js web editor and processing code for each challenge and I know that David Schneider a viewer has made a processing version of this so hopefully that'll get up on the site soon you can download the code see it live I might need it I don't know if that's the right terminology but that will just I'll give you a link to the actual demo run in the browser and then various other things that are related to the video are discussed here and this is the important part that I wanted to highlight this is where you can submit your own version so right now there's no kind of elegant you know web form type thing this is all has to be done through a pull request which can be somewhat daunting and a little confusing how to do that but there are these links will take you to instructions on how to do that and don't be afraid come we are welcoming and friendly in the coding train github repository if you've made something and you have no idea how it's a minute open up an issue say you need help try a pull request don't worry if you get it doesn't work it breaks there's a bug just give it a try I hear this from so many people oh I'm no good at that github thing I wish I could contribute something sometimes you just have to get over that first hurdle and you need people to be there helping you get over that hurdle and so Cody Drake there are lots of other places that our wonderful community is opensource communities helping people to get started contributing I hope that coding train can be one of those so it's just my little pitch to encourage you to contribute okay I'm not using a timer today I will use my Bell live demo yeah live demo probably would make more sense mark sheriff writes in the chat that is a good question on you are been asked do these live streams get saved in the channel yes so let me take you to the coding train on YouTube you can see here that I'm live streaming now if you go back I'm just gonna go to uploads this is everything that's on the Chola I'm logged in and you're seeing my unlisted videos here we switch accounts just for a second I meant to be on oh I don't know everything is all messed up all my accounts and everything are now being shown things are coming up unlisted videos view as okay wait now I'm gonna get ads okay fail to the first fail of today alright here's my chairs my videos this is what you would get if you were not logged in to YouTube and you would see all these different videos what I'm looking for is yes so these are typically what the live streams look like this is live stream number 100 the last one what we're a little bit behind so you can see these are some recent live streams that haven't that don't have like a thumbnail and and a title with a number on them so a little bit behind at that but the live streams usually get numbered and then everything else on the channel is mostly redundant content edited out of the live streams so as always anybody has a suggestion for how I could organize this stuff better you know a lot some people on YouTube have separate channels one for livestreaming one for uploaded content I'm just kind of doing everything all in one channel it's in one place anyway there I'm joking there's nothing there particularly private I will just mention that I make I have some videos that are for a course that I teach at NYU that are unlisted because they're specifically only for that course but they're there just add administrative videos my sort of technique for the way that I do it is when I have content videos for a course I have those public on YouTube okay okay what am I trying to do right so what am i doing today what am i doing today ah so I want to let me pull up the oh my goodness Simon Wow so first let me talk about Simon Simon is a viewer of the coding train I'm gonna do Simon Tiger let me go back to me logged in I'm a search for Simon Tiger and we're gonna get Simon's YouTube channel and we're gonna click over here Simon speaking of processing Community Day and I'm gonna click over here and then go to Mythology hard of mathematics this particular video then I'm going to close this close this and close this so this is a very famous pattern in mathematics called the cardioid there is a video on the mythology YouTube channel which is a fantastic use of do Tube channel about mathematics about using x tables to to visualize this cardioid shape the cardioid shape appears in the Mandelbrot said it appears in diagrams of kind of like patterns there's a an explanation in this video of how you can see the cardioid pattern and I in the top of a coffee cup based on like the way the light bounces off of it and reflects off the coffee all sorts of fascinating stuff here Simon creates Ivan created a created a poster I have which I have downstairs hanging in my office I sure brought it up here to show you visualizing all of the times tables in inprocessing inspired by this particular video and this is Simon giving a presentation about it at processing community de Amsterdam so these are my two inspirations I think vihart also has some videos about the cardioid and about general and generally speaking vihart has amazing wonderful one mind filling soul beautifying videos about mathematics and different types of things so I encourage you to check out the work of thy heart if you don't already I never look at the chat so slow mode is not again not on again I know why I'm forgetting to not put slow mode on in the chat oh well we'll see if I need to we'll see if I need to we'll see if I need to pull this car over kids well of the car over so I would like to do this and so in honor of I'm trying to avoid saying Valentine's Day by just to say Valentine's Day once in honor of tomorrow I would like to make a heart I would like to express my love for processing and we're gonna do that here by visualizing the times tables and get this pattern and I there's a I would like to recreate the animation I'll just click over to it I'm gonna I'm gonna let this play this is masala Jers content not mine a mythology are here I probably just gonna let it play for a few seconds so I'm gonna try to kind of recreate this animation I'm gonna stop it now because I want to be careful about repurposing other content encourage you to go check out the mythology video um but I want to see if I can create my own version of this animation ok we refresh this page refresh this page there we go cardioid there are lots of techniques for creating the cardioid shape this being the most common this is super related to the epicycles video I recently did I don't know if it makes sense for me to make a video just programming this way of generating it but it's useful to see that and then I could also get where's my Mandelbrot set challenge and have that ready to go let's see here here we go let's grab the processing code so what I want see you live let's do that so a little long let's grab the processing code and see what happens here because why would I avoid Valentine's Day the reason I would avoid valentines day because it's a fake holiday to just excuse corporation to sell greeting cards loves is a real thing I embrace hearts and puppies and rainbows and all of those things but not this candy scum rock commerce nonsense it's my okay let's take a look at this alright so in processing I should be able to make this let's try to make this 1280 960 yeah so there you can see the cardioid shape right here and then of course what it's been another half an hour geez Louise got started doing something get my ukulele out again okay why is this let's just do this okay this this I have this I have this okay what's interest what's here what's what machine what is what is machine learning think I should watch next interesting fascinating okay alright so this is legitimately sometimes it's not sometimes it's something that I've programmed hundreds of times not hundred times but several times before but maybe not in years sometimes it's something that I'm completely looking at for the first time and try to code and sometimes it's something that I like practice the day before and then I'm recoding again usually it's this which is like I kind of understand how this works I watched this video a couple times this seems very similar to other things that I programmed how hard could it be but I'm about to attempt this for the first time I have never tried to program this particular visualization I'm definitely going to need the whiteboard camera so should I just say Valentine's Day there's nothing wrong with saying Valentine's Day I'm going to draw a nice heart here I'm going to attempt to draw the p3 logo which kind of looks like a 1 and then it has kind of like a 3 like that I really like like live on YouTube drawing a heart and like my own very poorly drawn version of the processing logo apparently I am ok here we go so let's cycle the camera and let's get started actually I think what I'll do is I'll start with this and what's Oh interesting this is kind of envelope of a pencil of line so this is basically the others as they say the same thing okay okay Oh whoops sorry you can't see me all right I'm gonna start with this on my screen all right here we go Valentine's Day with Pete with processing don't make me get out my ukulele behave chat don't make me get out my ukulele do I have a love song here I have the lullaby that's not where you love song this is kind of lovey lovey dovey all right okay maybe we won't do any music well add some some very impressive music in post all right here we go hello happy Valentine's Day from the coding tree I'm gonna say it once I can be serious for mine hello there's something in my heart that I love and here on this day February 13th although you might be watching this on February 14th there's some other day in the future I want to express my love for processing processing a programming language and environment that started in 2001 created by Casey Risa and Ben fry please read all about the history of processing in the processing foundation it's work right now Crossing foundation org and I forgot to blow my train whistle at least there's no timer right Snape the ACE let's let's move this along people hello I'm here it's February 13th I am feeling the love I would like to express my love for processing my first programming love my one true love process express it by creating this this is a famous shape in mathematics called the cardioid if I'm pronouncing that correctly cardioid like heart it's kind of like a heart and today it might be some other videos after this one where I make all sorts of kind of heart patterns but I just want to make this pattern now if you want to learn more about this shape and where it appears in mathematics I want to point out to you this wonderful youtube channel called mythology mythology has a video called times tables Mandelbrot and the heart the heart of mathematics with mathematics and processing and code and all that sort of stuff now I should also point out that rendering an animation of these times tables in processing has been done before and most notably by Simon Tiger and one of the things I love about processing this year is where there's been this worldwide set of processing community days recently in Amsterdam Simon presented his work on creating this very large poster about the times tables across the community Amsterdam I was just at processing Community Day New York over the weekend and like my heart is definitely full of like love and wonder with all the things people are doing with processing so this video is dedicated to all the people who are working on processing in p5 GS and fellowships and and everything I love you all now everything's gonna go wrong because I'm gonna start coding but you know so this this shape um you know you can find it in looking at the waves light reflects around a circle I mentioned the Mandelbrot set you can see it right here as in this bulb of the sort of like first bulb of the Mandelbrot fractal set is a cardioid shape and it's kind of amazing that it appears in this context of time tables so and then I think we're gonna if you watch the end of the mythology or video there's this like animation at the end then I was just like wow that looks so cool I gotta show it to you now but I'm just gonna program it and hopefully it'll be at the end of this video somehow I'll program it so let me talk about how this works okay so happy happy almost happy February 13th to everybody I love processing okay now let's say and this is good timing because in my course at NYU this week just today we were yes yesterday we're talking about polar coordinate so I'm gonna need to make heavy use of polar coordinates for this particular visualization so we're gonna start with a circle and we are going to divide this circle equally into parts basically almost like a pie chart but the way I'm gonna represent that is just by spacing out equally spacing out a set of dots so I think of the mythology video he starts with 10 that seems like a good number so and probably makes sense from you start here 0 1 2 wait a second I think it's gonna work if I get the three over here right three four five six blades and all we have our first fail record scratch this just just ignore me I'm over here looking at something yeah okay oh that makes it oh yes yes one two one two three four ah okay okay okay let's try that again I have one I have two now I need eight more so I need four along the top and four along the bottom this is for me to get ten so one two three no that's three one two three four one two three four okay I did an okay job there so this is my circle whoa my ukulele this really shouldn't be here what you're saying yeah there's gonna be some interesting editing in this I'm okay everybody don't worry that was it sounded worse I mean if anything my glasses are might be broken I didn't actually get my head into glasses okay all right I have my circle with the evenly spaced out dots so now let me number them zero one two three four five six seven eight nine so I want to do times tables meaning I want to multiply each one of these numbers by two and whatever number I get then I want to connect it to that so two times zero is what zero so that's just 1 times 2 is what so that connects here 2 times 2 is what's 4 3 goes to 6 4 goes to up shoot I'm gonna have an easier time programming this than drawing it that's for sure 4 goes to 8 5 goes to 10 there's no 10 while we wrap around we use the modulo operator so we use the remainder basically if we keep counting like this will be 9 10 11 12 so 5 goes to 10 6 goes to 12 7 goes to 14 and 8 goes to 16 9 goes to 18 etc etc etc yes so you can see here that this shape is sort of starting to emerge I did a terrible job drawing this I feel like there's a mistake somewhere but whatever close enough you get the idea so let's first start by just creating exactly this all right Oh matchy let's edit it let me close these other things out just because I don't need them open I don't need this let's let's save this on the desktop as times tables and let me just add whoops oh I don't want the debugger on let me add void setup void draw let me say size is 6 let's make it a square right 640 640 actually hold on let's just see what that looks like that's pretty good oh my god I'm not in the right camera sorry everybody so why it used to be I swear in an old version of processing wherever I would leave the window it would kind of remember it and then when I would run it again it would end up there but just doesn't do that anymore it really makes me crazy there's probably a way I could modify like you can do like I don't want to get lost in this but just give me a second just curious no this doesn't work anymore I'll have to investigate that all right all right all right so let me start writing some code circle hmm okay so now what I need is I need a number of points so let me call this like this is the sir what's this scale the devised or I know what to call this total points just call it total all right so and I'm gonna make it a float let's keep it as an integer for right now I'm gonna change it to a float in a little bit you'll see why so now I'm going to I need to do a loop and draw all those points I want the center of my visualization I want everything to be well I let everything to be oriented around the center so I'm gonna translate to the center width / 2 height divided by 2 and then this is where that polar coordinate thing comes in I need to figure out the way I'm gonna find all those points is right there are how many slices of pie here 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 oh 10 how convenient so each one of these angles is 2 pi divided by 10 so that's how much I need to that's where each one of these points goes so I'm gonna say a delta this sort of like Delta angle I'll just call it Delta equals 2pi divided by total and then another actually another thing that way I could do is I could just use map so I could say angle equals map I which goes between zero and total to between 0 and 2pi it might be an easier way then I'm actually need this Delta and then I need a radius so which is basically I need to know like well how what is the radius of this circle that I'm visualizing and so for that let's just make the radius the width of the window divided by 2 so let's call that R which is the width of the window divided by 2 and then I want to say x equals R times cosine of the angle y equals R times sine of the angle and I will refer you to my video about polar coordinates to understand these particular formula pause for a second I see that there's some super chats flying by thank you so much when I finish this coding challenge I will thank you more properly thank you okay all right and then the next thing I just want to do is draw a point so I'm gonna say I'm gonna make an ellipse fill 255 ellipse at X Y and oh oh thank you Ben fry I'm going to call this circle there's a circle function now 16 I love using these ok so let's see what do I get there we go look you could see there's my 10 dots around the circle now I probably want to be able to see that circle that would be nice too so let me say stroke 255 no fill ellipse and this the translate needs to come before drawing this I just want to draw I know it's a circle it's a circle at 0 0 R times 2 right because the circle function expects the diameter the radius times 2 so now we can see there we go oh I have my circle with all my points now I need to do my math thing all right so I'm gonna have a value I'm gonna call this n so n is going to be what is the x amount that I'm going to multiply each number by so there's total pot there's a lot of different parameters in the system and you can play with them to create all sorts of different kinds of patterns hopefully we'll see some of those by the time I get to the end but right now I'm going to make this a two times table to try to get that heart that cardioid so I'm gonna call that maybe I should call that factor let's call that factor let's I'm gonna put that up here int in factor equals two and I I'm sure there's a nice way I could do all this together but I'm gonna do this as a separate loop so now I'm gonna do this again I mean obviously I'm just reap I I will refactor this later as I like to say but what I want to do is I want to say hey is I like I want to go from point A to point B which is I times factor those are essentially my indices of like where where I'm connecting the lines so 0 goes from 0 1 goes to 2 2 goes to 4 and then I need a function it actually this could be really useful for me to write a function that returns a P vector giving me the giving me a given a P vector for any given index so so get vector for any given index and then so basically I can say the angle is map that index but which goes between 0 and total between 0 and 2pi and then the vector equals a new P vector at and this should be a global variable R I cannot set the width up here because it doesn't know what the width is so I'm gonna make this R here and then I'm gonna say R equals with / I couldn't make that an argument to this function but just gonna keep that as a global variable make a new P vector R R times cosine actually P vector class has something in it P vector from angle angle that'll make the vector pointing in that direction and then I just want to multiply it by the R to set it to be that and then right so I'm using some vector stuff here which I realized is now maybe a little bit beyond the scope of if you were coming to this video just without knowledge of how the P vector class works in processing or in p5 which is a p5 vector it's just an object that has an x and a y so it's a nice way for me to store the X and the y together and I can make the x and y components from an angle and then I can scale that by multiplying it by some radius so it's really it's really got that sort of polar coordinate thing built into it so when I multiply it by r and say return R and then actually since I'm here refactoring this I could say right here P vector V equals what did I call that function get vector based on I and then I should be able say V X V dot Y so I basically just took that code and put it into a function because I'm probably gonna need to do this quite a bit I don't want to return our I want to return V well this is liking what I'm doing so far I think this might actually work okay so now I want to say get vector for I and then get vector for I times factor but guess what it's not just I times factor right what so first of all why oh this should be a peeve Ector this should be a PE vector so it's not just I times factor although I guess I could rewrite this function it depends on where I want to put this actually I'm gonna put it here so I need somewhere to deal with the fact that when I do 6 times 2 I get 12 but I really just want to because 12 divided by 10 is 1 remainder 2 so 12 modulo 10 is to the modulo operator which I have a video thank you goal 11 about modulo is also linked now up there somewhere in a corner of this screen okay so now right here I could just add that here modulo total okay all right so I don't think I'd actually drew those lines but this is still working that's there now I should be able to a line a dot X a dot y bx b dot y there we go it's backwards well why is that I mean it's not backwards oh because I started over there interesting so a couple things I could do I could just call like the scale function to flip it the other way I mean what's backwards what's forwards who knows I'm just saying in terms of watching that mythology or video it was oriented the other direction I also feel like our she needs to be a little bit smaller than the actual size of the window so let's make our equal like let's give it a little bit of buffer like 16 pixels that's a little bit nicer to see again my my visual talent skills are so nonexistent and I know people are watching this word designers and with artistic vision and you will make something beautiful out of this and I can't wait to see so ah ah aha I saw a chat message to go by which is really quite smart which is that I could just hear if this is the angle right this is the angle all I have to do is just if I wanted to start on the other side I can just add PI being 180 degrees so if if I'm starting with the angle here which if this is zero if I always just add PI I'll get here if I'm here I'll get there not type of thing and when I say PI I mean the number pi not a delicious blueberry vegan blueberry pie okay have to blow my nose where my tissues it's dripping okay all right let's give this a try oh it looks right okay now now we're getting somewhere so but the mythology uses the number 200 I'm just gonna let's go to 20 and see what we get Lou that's kind of interesting let's go to 200 Wow there we go mwah what there is the Cardiac oh that is like beautiful just on its own and by the way what's interesting about this is this is very similar if not precisely the pattern you would see if there were a light source here and reflected or bounced around this particular this particular circle so okay all right oh it needs to be red it needs to be orient the other way need to have like an arrow through an example baby Cupid flying by lots of things all right but I want to make this animation so there's a there's a bunch of different things we could do for example this this could be a variable so let's just look at that really briefly just to see I'm gonna say float I'm gonna make it a variable here equals 200 or I'm gonna say sorry int total equals map mouse X I'm going to take the map function Mouse X goes between 0 and width and I'm going to map that between 0 and 200 and then I'm going to convert that to an integer so now as a whoops oh so then good point this let's have this take a total and then the get vector function should have the total passed in maybe there's a different way of doing it but now we can see basically based on the number of circles we can see as I move the mouse left and right that increasing so that's one way I could animate this I think it's probably us to decide like a different way of animating this which I will get to in a second I think is probably more interesting and it's varying the factor like what happens if this is a three times table by the way we could just try that right now so let me make this back to 200 and let's make the factor 3 look at that interesting now by the way I die I shouldn't do this but I'm gonna try this let me go to the mandelbrot code okay now the mandelbrot code creates this pattern why it creates this pattern because of this formula Z equals Z squared plus C why is there an M there the kupets what if I change this to a three that would mean oh that's gonna change I can't do that so easily without it I need a complex number library this is about I thought like oh I could just in my head I was like I could just do this that's interesting okay I'll come back to that later maybe we should this is this is the math for squaring the complex number and I would have to like rewrite this entirely okay so this won't this won't make it nephrite thank you this won't make it in the final edit for this I'm looking at the chat okay all right nice idea but I'll I'll come back all right breaking news I'm being told toward from the chat that this shape is called a nephrite so this is an F roid and if I would go to say factor for look what I've got now so this and interestingly enough we could actually make these floatingpoint numbers let's just see if I have to change anything in my code if I do that I'm going to I think but let's see so I'm gonna do this alright so immediately we're stuck here like oh these are no longer integers so what if I make this a float and this a flow list of everything B floats there we go that work let's let's be sure about this right so that was factor 3 let's try factor 2 point 5 yeah this is looking like I should look so this is actually doing these same exact math but it's allowing for the spaces in between so what if I have two point two that could should connect to four point four and we can do modulo also because seven point one would connect to fourteen point one modulo 10 would still be sorry seven point one kick to fourteen point two modulo ten would still be a point four four point two so this works with floating points and now we can create that animation and so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to make this the global variable factor I'm going to start it at zero and then I'm just going to slowly over time say factor plus equals 0.01 interesting oh there's the cardioid there's the nephrite isn't that lovely and beautiful and amazing I just I just love this now think of the possibilities I have done the most basic thing to just create this animation and at some point it's gonna get it's like really crazy stuff it's gonna start to but there's so many other parameters there's ways you could think about color here I'm gonna make a JavaScript version of this that will run the browser that I will publish that you can look at which is basically exactly the same code I could look at this forever I hope you enjoyed this dedication longdistance dedication to my true love the heart of mathematics and processing no wait wait I don't want to go just yet I'd love that it just keeps going it's like never stops so what I want to do actually before I leave besides to make it all rainbow coloured is I wanted to show you this is a nice way to increase the factor but I want I'm gonna make another video that's about making a perfect gift loop and I think this is an opportunity for us to make a perfect gift loop so where would be a part that matches up so one thing I could do with this this this factor oh so one thing I could do with this factor is they like map it to a sine wave so for example what if I have a variable called T which is gonna be like I'm gonna keep track of time and I also have a variable called like DT which is like my time step and maybe I'll just go up by 0.1 and so what I want to do is factor equals map the sine of T which comes out to negative 1 and 1 between 0 and 200 oh yeah we go all the way up to 200 I don't know how high we should go there but let's try it let's try it up to 200 and then T plus equals zero point one so this would now have the factor value not just increase over time but smoothly oscillate with like an easing function a sine easing function there's lots of other easing functions you can use all the way up to 200 and all the way back down to 0 which would be a perfect loop so let's try that it's a little bit too fast well maybe 200 was too high let's have it just go up to 50 still whoa okay so I have to figure out what makes sense here five there we go so you could do that hit five and now it's coming all the way back down to zero and back up to five so I don't know that I've hit on this exactly right let's make this go up to 20 let's have tea go up even slower why does it starting oh because sign no sign of zero is zero opposite over adjacent oh no no it starts at zero so Oh weird I wanted to start at zero so let's make this what happens if I give it a negative number I'm just curious I was interesting so I'm just seeing what's happening it's going all the way up to 20 let me just actually have a go too oh wait yeah interesting that's weird within what it does with the negative so I don't want the negatives so here's this is the simplest hopefully the lot of stuff just got cut out there I was confused the issue was sign goes between negative one and one you know all you need to do is have time start at like poem hopefully there was a little edit point there what might what it wasn't doing what I wanted to do because I wanted to start with times table 0 but sign of 0 while it is 0 is then in if I'm mapping between the range negative 1 1 it starts at 1 so I could just change this to cosine because that would start at this is that would start at negative 1 or it actually starts it sorry yeah no it starts at 2 sine of sine of what is negative 1 I should know this right let me just show you how I figure this out it's PI over 2 R like group right so why did this not come on because so one of the things I love about thing about sine is like Y is sine as Y is sine of the angle Y is sine of 0 0 degrees 0 well if this is the angle sine is opposite over adjacent or I could I could call this the Y in this the hypotenuse or something so Y divided by H and imagine as this angle gets smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller like this eventually the if the angle is 0 the length of this side of the right triangle sine Roy trying anymore is 0 so even though the hypotenuse is whatever it is 0 divided bat so sine of 0 is 0 now sign of what is 1 well if the the angle 90 degrees right the angle were 90 degrees than that that side of that right triangle basically which isn't a right triangle anymore it would be equal to the hypotenuse so it's 1 so 90 degrees is 1 so it must be like negative 90 would be negative 1 right so if I start it at like if I just say print line print line sine of negative PI divided by 2 negative 1 right so that's where I want to start so I'm gonna I'm gonna make this have some continuity here oh wait did it just work by accident no I don't know what's going on anymore why did it start at 0 use trig circle yes a units big circle would be better I always think in weird ways though trig circle would tell me better oh because you're so weird just let me just I've ruined this video it's going so well this is what I want oh that's okay zero everything connects to zero I actually wanted to start at one as I want it to be it doesn't actually matter I was I was thinking that zero makes everything you see nothing but I'm totally wrong about that when the factor is zero everything connects back to zero when the factor is 1 you see nothing so in a way I actually want to start at 1 which is no no no applause please I want to start at 1 which is pi divided by 2 or but how come that oh that's starting at 2 so negative 100 it's actually perfect I had it right all along it just was like such a high number whatever I should have gone gone with this let me just go back I'm gonna like ignore that I thought this will like an interesting idea you think it's just it happened so fast at the beginning so in a way I wanted to this is not the sort of like oh because it starts at 5 when it's zero to two it's always in the middle so I want T actually to very specifically I see I get it now I get it now I always want if I always want it to start at one I always want to start it at whatever sigh whatever this number is / I always wanted to be 10% of the in this case so if we're 20 I would need this to start it this is so silly what I'm doing I don't think I'm right now I'm mostly just alright so let me think about this more for a second so this could actually I could actually have this be a number so I always want the starting point to be whatever so I can just do arcsine right so for example if I were to say let me just figure this out for a second if this were factor max factor is 20 right then what I want is and this would be max factor this is no longer a global variable T should start at arcsine of Max Factor / right I'm trying to think about this sign of T 0 to 1 1 to 20 oh that's a smart way of doing it yes it would be so much easier if I just multiplied Max Factor by sign or if I add one cosine of T plus 1 that's a good solution you know I was doing so well and then I then I went off I'm too many tanned that's an interesting idea let's try that no map okay hold on I can work this out so many ways to do it on 0 to 2 and 1 Damien no that's not gonna work use frame that set location in the draw function that's interesting hold on I want to make this start always at wherever it's going up to this is so silly it's lonely do it this way because this will be an easier way to think of it factor equals sine of t plus 1 times max factor and then this is the same thing I had before but if I'm just getting rid of the map function to think this through all I could do from C that's actually a really good idea right because the map function doesn't care if I say map sine of T with a range between 0 and 1 and I always want to start it whatever whenever it's 0 I want it to be 1 Max Factor yeah there we go yeah that's that's what I want yeah ok I don't know why I couldn't couldn't think of that so what did I have before yes okay sorry sorry for that digression everybody lost my mind there for a minute it's very hot very stressful to do this in front pool I bought all right I'm I'm back I I went off on like a hold down a whole rabbit hole of like figuring out something which was actually quite simple which is that I was wondering why it wasn't starting what I wanted it to do I wanted to start I wanted to start like this if I put this at two I want it to start where the factor is one I want the factor to be one because I want it to sort of start in this loop with it always at with with you just seeing the outer circle and if everything is multiplied by itself then zero connectors are one we have no lines but if I increase and this works if I'm going between zero and two because sine of 0 is 0 and in this mapping function I end up with 1 but if I were to change this to 0 to 3 then it's starting somewhere else so that's not what I want and actually a trick that I can do with the map function is I could just sort even though the range is really negative 1 to 1 it's gonna figure out what to do even with something negative so I can actually make tell it the range is from 0 to 1 and then but whenever sine of T is 0 it should always equal 1 and then go up to like 20 that should work although it's really fast if this is just like way too fast still pretty fast but that's because I'm going so high let's just go to five I just want to see like a smoother animation there we go this is what I'm looking for so you can see start at zero and it's sort of like coming up to four of those little bulbs and then back down to zero and then back up so Oh tea is supposed to increase by DT ah whoops yeah I don't know why I made this DT variable and then didn't use it oh there we go I was also a mystic DT that whole time so I could control it and we could probably make this 20 now yeah and we could sort of see there we go this is a little bit better so I just wanted to see it's sort of like smoothly breathing animation that Luke's so it's going to go all the way up and back down I know this video was going so well at the beginning and became a bit of mess here at the end but I am really excited to see what kinds of things do you create from this the heart of mathematics the cardioid shape thank you for watching and I'll see you in a future coding challenge goodbye so really slows down is it good up there isn't it in fact sweeping negative 5 to 5 ah I think you're right hmm all right let's let's do let's let's understand how this works I should really do this in like right if sign whoops if I get the value one sorry if I get the value zero zero this should print I should see a 1 that's exactly what I want if I see the value 1 I should see a 5 what if I get met do negative 1 negative 3 yeah so I this isn't really right the problem is so there's a nicer way to do this which is I could just say all right I could have T start at negative PI divided by 2 and map sine of T yeah that's what I want what's wrong with me this is what I want or I could use cosine because cosine will start at zero I don't need to go back down to zero cosine of zero is no cosine zero is not negative one so yeah okay well we redo that again ah this is even like simpler than what I had sorry Mathieu negative cosine oh you you smart people in the audience I'm gonna do it cosine starts at one I know so I could map it from 1 to negative 1 there's so many ways there's like a hundred thousand different ways I could do it it's actually not that complicated I've just lost in my own thoughts here which is the thing that seems to happen a lot ok all right there's a weird edit point this is actually working the way I want it to work but it's not starting at the right spot like let me just run this again it kinda like starts in the middle and I want it to start where I wanted to start where the factor is 1 because I want all the points to connect to themselves which is what I don't see anything because I don't see any lines because every line is drawn from the point to the point so actually there's a really simple way to deal with this which is that sign I'm at T starts at 0 and sine of 0 is 0 so like the factor is actually starting at 5 here because if I'm in the middle of the range that I'm about I know I'm just gonna change this range I don't I don't care about the range between 0 and 1 actually for the purpose of the animation so I start the range at 1 and then sine of what is negative 1 it is negative PI divided by 2 so I gotta just start at negative PI divided by 2 which will mean sine of 0 will be at negative 1 and then you should see this there we go so it starts I want this to loop all the way up to this number of Bowl however I'm going up to 10 and then all the way back down to 0 so now I have some stuff that I could play with in terms of like oh I could have this go up to 50 I could change DT to be like twice as fast and I don't know it's way too fast probably to like get the effect of the animation yanks but you get the idea sorry for how crazy that looked let's make this do this like even slower see it start to form so this will now be a nice slow animation all the way up until 50 I'll take this out I am excited to see what you make out of this what happens when you think about the geometry in a different way you think about rendering this in a different way you think about color you think about multiple dimensions you think about different styles of animation what if you like we're actually like draw all the lines as there's so many possibilities here I hope you explore this and make your own version of the cardioid to express your love for somebody on this day on our every day of the year thanks very much and I will see you in a future coded challenge yeah three pie divided by two equals negative one but it's the same it's the same thing it can be negative right all right now with colors I'm gonna let everybody make their own version of this let me just quickly put this in the web editor so we have it but I actually kind of this didn't like the looping of this didn't work the way I kind of imagined it would so I think I might actually prefer to just leave it at I mean this I think this actually was a nicer animation to be perfectly honest hey Espen Larsen joined as a new member Espen Larsen is the creator the singer the composer of no I'm not leaving that was just the end sine squared from 0 to PI that's interesting all right sorry this is like way too much fun to watch I feel like I want to do this actually I want to do this oh it's slow interesting uh why is it slow let me sorry I just I can't help myself let me just like play with this for a little bit just a little bit longer before I go into the next coding challenge I feel like these circles are which ones are unnecessary will I get just as much value out of like fewer lines I just want to I just want to give it a little a little something and what happens if I do this with hardware acceleration there we go all right let's take a little break and let this play I'll do some thumbnails okay so let me let me do some thank yous I'm here where where is this thank you to Israel ah hoo ho sorry thanks for your passion I learned a lot with you thank you to otaku's thank you welcome to new member akre technologies and new member Espen Larsen so let me just say so membership wise there is a join button on YouTube I also have a patreon if I'm constantly thinking about whether I'm gonna keep the patreon or not but I don't have a lot of benefits for people who join as members I do mail you a sticker or not a cigar a bunch of coding train stickers you can see some of them here and and then I sometimes do live streams where I'm trying to like test out an idea or fix something that will just be for members only that's pretty rare wouldn't count on that and then we have a slack channel so again I should mention that if you if you have recently joined as a Youtube member but you don't have a slack invite check the community tab and there's it's probably just I'll post me much I post a new one the only way I can get you a slack invite us through a Google Form I forgot another way to do it so so to ekor technologies and Espen sandal Larsen hopefully I can get you your slack invite soon okay the song by the way is manfred writes you've got to make this song long longer there actually is a full version of the song on Spotify that you can find but and I will ship the stickers anywhere internationally it's very inexpensive to send something in the I mean it just costs a dollar or two so I'm very happy to send you the stickers wherever you are in the world the thing that I have a problem with is I don't get to it very quickly and so sometimes you have to bug me a little bit about that and I apologize for that you shouldn't have to but um you know if yeah so okay it's just by the way what's interesting is it just still going I should really put what the factor number is this would be interesting too let's just do this for a second text factor number four minute number format by the way is a function and processing that will control the number of decimal places you show and so we can go like this whoops Oh text is a little weird and PGD will this work whoops oh I forgot because I am so now we should see that's the factor up in the top left so we'll see that's kind of interesting to see what number it is by the time it gets to different patterns so you can see that's five usually the number of bulbs is one less than number six all right so what else am I gonna do today it is noon I've got another hour so in me here oh oh I want to do the I definitely want to do the next thing I want to do is the gift loop thing okay so if to think about this I just like letting this run can I let it run in the background while I do other stuff yes so let's look for hold on I've gotta find some messages sent to me from goal on 11 just sit here no oh it's cuz it's not with the G this is good and this is good okay I'm looking for this I also looking for Saskia where's the best way is it tumblr yeah okay and what's this No this and then there was something else when I'm looking for gift loop gallery okay interactivity and computation if loop gallery I think this is what I'm looking for okay awesome ohho I love this that's really great I love all these okay okay so I think I am ready for the next coding challenge where are we now we're up at factor equals 75 Simon and Simon's poster I wonder how many go up to Max Factor then reverse the sign of DT and you get back to zero and then reverse again yeah whoa it's interesting how it sort of comes back to what it was of course at the beginning okay all right right yeah a slider would certainly be an option okay so let me just I just want to put this back yeah I'm just getting the code into a place where I can release it fine all right great okay okay let me just look at let's look at Golan's code for a second so I want to make like a simpler version of it but it's super good to see so let's look at this one if I run this alright so this is what it's doing so the technique here the technique here is to have a counter that basically goes from 0 to 1 that's like a percentage complete of the loop it looks like and there's a you specify like the total number of frames so like if I change that to 500 it's really the same thing but it's just running slower because there's like more frames if I change this to 50 we'd see it like this ok and then then this will start recording it so if you're recording it you compute always computer percentage and then you oh you call like a render function with that percent that's pretty interesting and then it takes a percent between 0 1 and then there are two different graphical techniques for example like this spinning thing and Hutt's % times 2 pi that makes sense and then transformations a percent times 2 pi times negative 0.25 interesting linearly moving percent plus 0.5 modulus one map percent for 0 to 1 okay that's like linear sigmoid aliy moving pink square function double exponential sigmoid Oh fascinating oh I see there's all these different easing functions mmm how much do I want to get into all this traveling sine wave % that's super interesting ok ok alright so easing functions yeah so like different easing functions you could use got it okay okay I think I have used cosine square what's that okay so I think I'm ready to give this a start all right all right let's let's get this going okay hold on erase this I really want to adjust my Mandelbrot code to being able to do to be able to do the complex numbers to like the third power the fourth power that should be an interesting thing to do so maybe I'll get to that at some point let me just check the chat here oh my goodness I forgot to record this to disk it's fine we'll have to get it down from YouTube but I need to do some green screen thumbnail shots later oh sorry Matt shoot what's here's a hint for you what's this I don't know what's going on here oh this is something happening in the chat that's not look the quality on this live stream was hopefully okay because I'm gonna have to when I edit this together it's gonna when Matt gets it it's gonna have to be the YouTube archive that gets edited because I forgot to hit record to disk use a tan to to get angle and modulus to get length and maybe the chat is discussing something that has nothing to do with me right now I need to to to move along I'm saying lag was it lagging before hopefully it'll be fine hopefully it will be fine all right anyway I'm recording this to disk now so everything else from now will be okay what I want to know is it was not lagging during the challenge okay great okay great all right well we can always fix some things in post by like overlaying the visuals if we have to but I'm gonna move on all right okay I get that as lagging theirs let me just check the my yeah bad it's so that I don't know it says the stream status is currently bad I don't know what to do about that all right all right here we go hello I am here today to do a coding chit chat oh my god I think I have to minimize the chat yeah try it slow mode I don't know hello I am here today to make a coding challenge about making a perfect well whatever I make won't be perfect but you might make something perfect gift loop so what does it gets loop why am I talking about gift loops so one way that artists who work with computational media and computer graphics are distributing their work and and and expressing themselves is through posting gifts to various different online platforms an artist I would like to highlight is Saskia freak who has been making daily animated artworks for quite a long time in fact maybe there have been at least 1500 of them which is mindblowing and you can see a whole variety of them here on her tumblr there's some other I think she would a medium article about this process they're amazing a very famous gift artist that I have referenced in previous videos if I did a whole coding challenge trying to recreate his cube wave is cube wave is bees and bombs so bees and bombs creates looping gifts through algorithms and math and graphics in all sorts of astonishing mindblowing ways so I encourage you to check out bees and bombs also tumblr to see all of the kinds of gifts that he has created I'm goal on Leben at Carnegie Mellon University professor Carnegie Mellon University gives an assignment every semester in his course interactivity and computation to create a gift gallery and so these create a gift and this is a gallery of gifts that students made in his course just this past fall and Golan has a lecture about loops throughout the history of art you know all it's very easy to think as we work on programming computer and make algorithms visual and happen in javascript in the browser with your open GL shaders WebGL magic that this is the first time any doesn't happen but this kind of work has been happening for years and years and predates the dawn of computers themselves so this is a wonderful set of historical references to different kinds of Luc's that people have been making and of course here's the iconic Muybridge galloping horse that you can see here so I encourage you to check out all of these resources read about loops and in fact you don't even need to watch this video you can go right here to gold ons Luke templates which has templates for Java I'm sorry processing Java p5.js JavaScript and Python processing as well so what I'm gonna do though in this video is I'm gonna make my own I'm not worrying about making something artistic or innovative or beautiful I'm just gonna try to show the process from start to finish of writing code in processing rendering it out to files and then compacting that up as a gift that you could post I'm also gonna come back and do a follow up video there's a new p5 JavaScript gift library that some students of mine worked on last semester in a course about open source and so I will come back and show that in a future video as well so let's get started so what is the driving principle of making a loop so if you look at Golan's code examples the core idea is to have to have first a total number of frames so a gift an animation is just rendering a whole bunch of images in sequence at some framerate for your eye to see and it appears like animation and if whatever it is in the last frame or really what would be the last frame the sort of like frame before the last frame matches up exactly with the first one then you have a loop so in other words if I'm drawing a circle here and then it goes to here and then it goes to here I don't need that many frames and then it goes to here and then maybe it disappears I have a blank frame then in theory the next frame I want to see it would be it entering the screen that but instead I go back and show the first one so this will look like it's a loop that's going on forever whereas reality is just starting at the beginning and the last frame matches that and so as it goes back to the beginning it appears infinite so this is the idea so one couple things we need to do we need to keep track of like what is the total frames we want so we're going to need some sort of variable like total frames like in this case I want to have one two three four five and I'm really going to use the number six because I'm not gonna I'm gonna read this is zero zero one two three four five wait hold let me think about this if I don't want to render out the last frame but the idea has six anyway Oh everything's gonna be okay just take a break take a deep breath am I supposed to look at the chat now and probably everybody saying aye why does he look at the chat I can tell that's what's in the chat I didn't have to look at the chat to know everybody the chat is that just me look at the chat I'm gonna go look at the chat oh no I knew it I knew it I knew what this would happen I knew enough to pull this car over I'm pulling this car over Giff with a G some people like to say good and some people like to say yeah but I like to say good but I don't mind and if people say because we can all where's my dad where's my pen the G is silent if I think that's a good way pronounce it if I lost my pen my marker and I have to go I have to go be a human being somewhere else in the world today how come I lost that marker I have a sweater I have like a keyboard I have oh here's a marker is this the marker I was using maybe all right I don't want to get lost in the details of the total here let's just say the idea is that the animation itself has six frames 0 1 2 3 4 5 into that's the frame count and then I might not include the last frame 1 actually stitch it together because the last frame like is really back to the first frame again but the point is the total number of frames need the total number frames and then I also want to have a variable called percent and the idea is that percent will always be the current frame count will be in the current frame the current frame number divided by the total number of frames and what you'll see in Golan's example let's do the same thing is if we have the the ubiquitous processing draw loop draws looping over and over we could actually put our code somewhere else like maybe I'll write a function called render and we would just call that function render passing in the percent so this is a fun that knows how to render some kind of design based on what percentage of the way through the design it is and as long as the design is his is thought of in a way where the end matches the beginning then this is going to work out all the other stuff about like saving frames and all that kind of is it recording is it not recording that could be in the draw loop okay this is way too much explanation because it's in essence like quite a bit quite a bit more simple but there's something to say that it was the king of yeah why there's two more things I want to say about this one is Golan writes in his instructions as student sketch on paper first so I really recommend you you do that if this is something you want to create try working this out with crayons markers charcoal pencil that's a really helpful going into that sort of like analog drawing process will really help you think through your ideas number two is what are the kinds of algorithms that move a value from one number to another number and in fact maybe like by the wrap back around and there are all sorts of different kinds of ways of doing this um probably yours if you've watched any of my videos before you might be thinking of the sine function the sine function is an excellent function to use for a gift loop because if it's start as a sine function if I were to graph the sine function right it sort of it where it starts it and it repeats it's a repeating pattern over and over again you could also use and then there's a ton of different kinds of easing functions so there's this lovely website called easing functions easiness net which is an easing function cheat sheet and I highly recommend you explore some of these other easing functions to think about how you might move a value through this loop and if you go to Golan's code I'll just click on the click on the processing one for a second you can see like even in the code here there is a this like double exponential sigmoid easing function so anyway that's a that's a like exports you can do separately from this video let's just get the basic mechanics working so for example I'm gonna go back to processing actually let me make a new sketch where do I have a sketch already whatever like a new sketch what I call it gif gif loop sometimes I just like start to MI at two hours yet once I get to two hours like I stopped being so I like reading the chat sometimes all right so I have a blank processing sketch now and I'm going to go set up I'm gonna draw I'm gonna I'm gonna let's let's make it a square like 400 by 400 let's make the background zero ah but no no no no let's make another function called render and this function is going to take a value like percent and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna say render percent I'm gonna say the percent is the by the I'm gonna I'm gonna make my own variable called counter divided by the total frames so this means I need to say like okay well I want to have a hundred and twenty total frames in this gif I want to have a counter equal to zero and now here what I'm gonna do let's just do something like say the ellipse an ellipse is at % x with this would be a linear function now at height divided by 2 and which is like 20 by 20 so we can see now if I say counter plus plus and I'm going to say afloat let's just see if this works for a second so this is the idea that I have a total number of frames I have a counter that's gonna go up and I really want it after I I want to start the counter at zero and then count up by one after render and this the idea here is that a much more complex sophisticated design with all sorts of different kinds of easing equations could be in here but let's just see if this works I have some brackets out of place what so I have some weird extra slash here so let's see what happens there we go so we can see it's moving across it's almost like the ball is moving because it's being drawn based on a percent now how do i how would I determine how I want to render this so if I'm record like I'm just gonna have mine start recording right when the program starts so if you look at goal lines examples a bit more sophisticated you press a key it starts recording but here what I'm going to do is I'm just going to say right here save frame gif pound pound pound pound which are hash PNG and I'm gonna I'm gonna make a folder called output so what this function does is it saves an image to the directory output associated with this processing sketch as a PNG those hash symbols or pound symbols indicate to processing that you don't you want the file name to be numbered based on the frame count hmm I'm gonna do this a different way oh because I'm I want to use my own counter this is going to use the automatic frame count which is probably fine but what I want to do is I'm gonna say plus number format counter 4 + PG so I'm gonna add the counter number in here manually I think that's gonna be all about this number format function says use four digits no matter what I guess I can just use three because I know I'm going to have a hundred 20 frames only need three dot PNG and then what I could say is if counter equals total frames I'm gonna just basically say exit here so I'm gonna tell the program to stop so let's run this okay now let's look it I have a folder called output I look in there and we can see there we go I have all my images so these there are tons of ways now I could take this and stitch it together as a gift let's actually do that really quickly so for example I'll pause for a second sorry I'm looking at the chat okay I'm trying to say if I want to do this I'm not gonna do the stitching now okay so I'll show you how to do the stitching later in fact this new p5 library actually will just create the gift for you too but it's kind of nice to have them as separate images and we do have this question of like do I have it matching up correctly like we should see the last one should be 119 and it's there so you know my algorithm is perhaps like not the best like really like this percent times width isn't really like a perfect loop so that's something I might need to improve but let's let's make something that I know will be a perfect loop so for example one thing that I could do now is I could say alright let's let's use rotate so I'm going to say angle equals percent times 2pi and i'm going to translate to the center of the window I'm going to say wrecked mode Center I'm gonna say no stroke I mean no fill stroke weight too and then I'm gonna say rectangle at zero rotate by some angle rectangle lets you square square at zero zero with a side length of 100 so let's look at this what just happened no fill o stroke to 55 and this should have a fill of 255 so now we can see this is spinning now in theory that's gonna match up perfectly because that rotation at 2pi equals the rotation at zero and I'm rendering the very last frame right before percent would be one in which case it would actually be 2pi so this should match up perfectly so let's now I'm going to comment this out let's do this one more time let that spin stop now let's actually make it a gift all right so I need to look up really quickly I need to look up really quickly how I would um what's the let me just look oh I think it's on Golan's homework assignment like some recommended websites like easy gift or something I guess I could just Google one I just want to find like a reputable gift stitching website gif I mean you could do it in Photoshop but I don't want to I don't wanna use Photoshop gifts tip it open source gifts somebody's going to recommend one for me Oh posted assignments okay let me look prices ins I'm sorry I'm looking at a different computer right now tips for making gifts gift maker dot me let's try gif maker dot me giffy I like but the giffy tool just lets you capture it so let's let's go to gif maker dot me yeah let's just do this okay all right so I picking just this website that was recommended on Golan Levin's page gif maker dot me you can also make a gift for the Photoshop their countless all include some other resources of how you can do it but what's nice about here is I can click this upload images and I can go to the desktop to this gift loop and oh whoops hold on that's this sketch oh I didn't even save it oh my god I'm such a loser hold on hold on let's delete that and let's go to the desktop let's run it and I can click upload images I can go to the desktop I can go to my processing sketch called gif loop I can find this output folder and then I can just do select all hit open and it is uploading all the images oh I'm putting my gift out of the oven it's ready ding yes all right and now you can see look I have this control panel which lets me do stuff and change the animation speed and bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla create gif animation what do I do now download the gif and then I go here let me find it oh it's so slow so let's uh there must be animation speed does that make it faster or slower laughter like look at this no slower oh yeah oh I see so hold on so we can see the gift here it's actually like running really really slow that's because if these animation speed is set at 200 milliseconds in between each frame so if I change this to like 10 maybe even just like 2 unless maybe too fat let's make that 5 there's a 10 there we go so we can see that looks good now can you see is that a perfect loop looks like a perfect loop to me so now I should be able to do create gif Craig if Craig if and then hit download the kif sorry was there and then if I look at it in finder know what let me just why it does not work you the gift no it's still so slow why why am I not able to get that speed if i refresh this is it let's try that again the Skippy cricket hold on hold on so there's the gift maker on giffy which I use but I thought oh let's do this alright I'm ready to make my gift now and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna use a giffy has a gift maker here at goofy calm slash create slash gift maker and I can add multiple images to create a gift slideshow oh I'm making a slideshow I have no idea so I'm gonna do this by the way I'm arty my finder is already pointed to this folder but basically I just need to find my processing sketch which is here on the desktop under gif loop I saved everything into output and then so now if I click here and do command a4 select all and open it is now uploading all my files look at this oh this is so cool so now I could see all of the images and I could probably I could delete some I could I could change them so I could do something like editing here and then if I want the whole thing to be one second interesting so like I could change this is it giving me like a preview that's the preview oh this is very very slow oh I want each image to be one second I do not want that so if I want like 30 frames per second then I want each image to be oh I just have to use the slider well is that like the only options I get I can only do ten frames for a second seriously it doesn't let me have any more control over it than that that's not good I guess that's kind of reasonable to do but I want to have more a faster frame rate well let's at least see if this works continue to decorate Oh 15.9 duration exceeds a master maximum of 15 seconds well no so this is the disc gift makers no good apparently we need to the old website was better alright let's go back to that no wonder goal on didn't recommend this one alright here we are can I just drag and drop it by the way just curious if it lets me do that no that would be nice wouldn't it all right I found this website thank you to the recommendation from Golan gif maker dot me there are so many different ways you could make a gift you can do it in Photoshop there I will include reach links to other websites that allow you to do this ugh if he has one though it has some limitations I just found out because I just tried it and what I need to do here is click this upload images and basically I want to take this folder and upload all of the images I saved out to that website so I am now going to click upload images and luckily my browser is already into that folder oh I wonder why but you would have to navigate to find it I'm gonna hit command a which does select all open and then now I wait for these things to upload oh it uploaded and now I take my gift out of the oven and present it to you here all right so we can see that it's going it's very very slow so if I want it to be that's because it is the animation speed is 500 milliseconds which I assume is the amount of time for each image and I believe 30 frames per second would be like 16 is that right so if I do that we can see how that looks right so that's like 30 frames per second and then I want to do create gif animation click that please wait a moment then I'm just gonna click view the gif it opens up a new tab that's still really slow right that's not 30 frames per second why is this not working all right let's try downloading it see if that helps so now I've downloaded the gif it's not 30 frames per second is it just that I and it's just like when it's smaller it looks so much faster 16 is 60 yeah 16 is 60 sorry yeah he had sixteen point seven seven probably ffmpeg yeah I should do I was just trying to avoid like ffmpeg cuz it's like a whole thing people have to install gizmo calm easing is that for making gifts or that's for easing change the animation speed before you upload the image last time I use ten yeah I guess I could use Photoshop I just I wanted to use something that everybody could use not everybody will have Photoshop and not everybody all right let's try easy gift / maker that's another one use the gift comm slash maker try number 15 million all right let's try this okay let's try this alright I can't get have things make my oven joke one more time alright you can use yeah we're trying to do something that you don't have to install and you don't have to pay for although these things have like we're doing on ads on them but all right we'll try this okay all right so now that I've made all those images and save them to the output folder I'm going to try stitching them together as a gif I'm using this website called easy gift comm it's must be easy cuz it says so so I'm assuming this is gonna work great but there's lots of other ways you can use Photoshop you can use ffmpeg there's all sorts of different tools software tools you can use to stitch images together into a gif but let's see what happens if I select Choose files luckily for me it's already going straight to my output directory but you'd have to find that on your through the fear your through your finder or whatever operates that's music I'm gonna do select all I'm gonna click open and then I'm going to say upload and make a gif and this is gonna work right look so we can see well look at this we can see all of it the delay is 20 so 20 milliseconds would be I guess that's like somewhere between 30 and 60 frames per second and somewhere here I should be able to say oh I can change the delay time so 60 frames per second would be like 16.7 let's just leave it at 20 loop count loop forever I'm not gonna worry I'm not gonna crossfade frames what's interesting that it has that effect let's try this make a gif oh but have to wait now it's baking the oven very slow oh that's in 1/100 of a second that's not milliseconds okay it says right there on the page in 1/100 of a second one one thousandth of a second is a millisecond so like 32 milliseconds of delay is like maybe around 30 let's make this three we want three one hundredth of a second let's just try that let's see what happens I mean you might want it slower but I want it to kind of like look like how it looked in processing so let me click this again there we go look there's my gift there's my gift is it perfectly looping sort of hard to tell but let's now I should be able to download it I can probably just like right click and do save image as and say put it on the desktop and then I can look at it here and there it is yay okay so you get the idea look what to showed you next I don't know if I really want to show you much more make a gif calm pictures to give okay now all right so you know ultimately the creativity of what you design is really the is is really the thing that I'm hoping that you will discover in yourself to make something I mean I've just made a rotating square but I think in order to be able to explore your creativity you're gonna need the tool you're working with to be a bit more flexible because right now the way that I set this up is it kind of runs it once and then quits but I really want to be able to watch the thing loop and if and then like change the code and run it again and change the code and run it again and then when I'm ready kind of hit record so let's do that this way what I could do that through an interface but I'm just gonna make a boolean variable called record and I'm gonna set that equal to right now I'm gonna set that equal to false okay so what I'm gonna say here is if um I'm gonna say float I'm gonna say float percent equals zero and this is very similar to Golan's if record then I am going to use this counter that I have and and then I am also going to do all this stuff like saving the frame otherwise I am just going to say percent equals float the actual frame count I mean I could always use the counter this is silly I should just always use the counter but frame count modulus total frames divided by total frames and so this should really be this is a little bit goofy but I'm gonna put the percentage around here the parentheses around there okay so let me give myself a little bit more room to look at this code this is a weird I gotta I gotta explain this for a second and why why why there we go okay so what I want to do here is I want to have the frame count always cycle back to zero and I want to which I use the modulo operator and I want then I want to divide that by total frames but I want to convert that into a float and so I don't need these extra parentheses or this parentheses yeah no yes this is what I want sorry about that this is what I want I want to do frame count modulus Topher this is so silly I'm just gonna use the counter for everything there is a built in frame count variable and so really uh so it's really just about what I'm using the modulus or not so now that recording is false this is just going to play the loop forever and ever again and I know that if I ever want to now record it right if I like my design I can go and delete what was there before which I don't have to it'll overwrite it and I can hit I can change recording to true and then I can run it it will do the recording and then it will quit out so there you go you know what there's a mistake here I am recording the last frame and I don't want to let's look at the let's look at the output here yeah 120 I don't want 120 because 119 is the frame right before the starting frame the way that I've coded this so this say frame has to be here so that's a quick fix let me delete that again let me run this here goes record it's going to draw that last one but that's fine now we should see the very last four shouldn't it exit before it does that didn't all right well let's do it this way let's just check if it gets to the end if it gets to the end so frame before the last one then quit and now here we go ah that works I can see just based on where it stopped okay great so this is why why I want the last frame to match up before the first one okay great so there's so much other stuff we could do I could use like a sine wave again I would encourage you to look at different easing functions and try all sorts of different kinds of designs and your only limitation for yourself is that the end matches up with the beginning but matching up can mean a variety of different things because something can leave the window and then enter again so there's as long as the as long as there's a visual continuity your gif will loop so I will come back I will show you also how to do this in p5.js in the browser with a special new p5 gift library that I've been testing thanks to the creators of that library and I'll come back to show that to you in a future video and please share your gift loops we're gonna have them all over the place I don't know coding trained gift loop know what what should it be just share them just look at this video's description I'll explain how to share them good bye thank you it was 120 still there uh hold on and I just didn't delete it let's see let's see I'm pretty sure I deleted it I feel like I need to do this whole video again know then that weird it's even though it exits exit is like it must be asynchronous or something because it's it oh you know what it must say it must say it says exit when you get to the end of draw so draw it's probably more like an indicator like if I really did I wonder if I did like system exit zero or something yeah that worked interesting interesting so the processing exit function let make sure that draw finishes that's an interesting little tidbit make sure that draw finishes where system not exit actually forces the exit gift train but it's like a gift please share your gifts with me hashtag gift train it's like a gift in the rain see you next go to challenge good bye yeah I see what you mean this this is so flawed in so many ways but I'll decide if I need to come back and do this again all right let's make some more hearts oh it's one o'clock let's make a few more hearts oh I could say we returned that's a good idea let's make some more hearts so many hearts let's make some more hearts we can make it a gift loop all right okay all right everybody all right here we go it's time to finish up for this week oh I wanted to talk about the date of course I never get to it I really have to work on that oh my god oh my goodness oh my goodness all right do I need I'm not so sure that I need the board but in case that I do I guess I should erase I think that gift flute video is like kind of useless but we'll see you sometimes I think that and then I just I'm in my own head because and actually maybe there's a lot of stuff that's like new concepts for people okay all right I'm here to make some mathematical hearts look at these formulas if you plot these formulas you get a heart I mean what could be better than that this one here is might be my favorite although this one here is kind of interesting look at this so we could try any of these but I actually want to try something a little bit different here I mean I'm looking at this and I know what formula are there so what I'm about to is no in no way magic whatsoever but I want to try to get a little bit of an intuition for why that crazy formula makes a heart shape and how you might basically design your own parametric equations to generate different patterns so there are a variety of different techniques for this oh look rotated cardioid and we could just graph the cardia I just with like one minus sine of theta oh so many ways it could make the cardioid but let's let's let's go to processing my happy place my love my true love processing can I put like emojis in the in the comments hold on heart emoji Matt you you're gonna edit this part out let's just see if I do copy mmm no I cannot put emojis in the comments it's so sad how do you what did we do before there were emojis like this right okay now that we've gotten that out of the way that was a very important I'm gonna go back to the curb thing so first thing that I want to do is this is going to be a lot easier if I think of everything as oriented around the center of the window so I'm gonna translate the corner of the origins in the topleft then translate to the center by the way this channel I shouldn't call it the kodi train I should just call it here's another example of things you can do with polar coordinates based like every video I make it's the same but maybe that's the theme for this week so now what I want to do is I want to loop around all of the points of a circle you'll see you'll see why it's like I want to basically I want to say float on a four float a which will answer angle I'm gonna start at zero I'm gonna go all the way up to 2 pi and I'm gonna go buy some increment I'm gonna pick that arbitrarily oh there might be reasons why I want to pick different increments at some point so I'm gonna have every angle from 0 to 2pi and I'm also going to make up a variable called R which is kind of like radius let's just go 200 right now and I'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the polar two Cartesian coordinates song autotune and the Internet will fix that for me R times cosine of the angle y equals R times sine of the angle what I want to do here is I'm gonna say no fill and Stroke 255 and begin shape because what I want to do is create my own custom shape based on all of these points oriented around this circular path hopefully this will all start to make more sense to you so then I can call vertex X Y and then I can say and shape and I can run this and you have this a circle I have made a circle the circle and and by the way if I were to change this increment value to something much higher you can sort of well let's make it like much more extreme you can see here like I'm I'm actually just moving around the edges of a circle and if I thought more carefully about like two pi divided by six then I might have a hexagon all sorts of possibilities like that right two pi divided by six there we go nice little hexagon there but this is not what I'm doing I am just tracing the contours of the circle now here's the thing I can start to futz with these equations for example what if I wanted to pinch a little bit hold on pause for a second you can put an emoji in JavaScript sorry I'm seeing some comments of other equations yeah this is the one that I'm doing the system 1 Simon okay sorry all right so what if what I wanted to do is like pinch the shape a little bit so interestingly enough what if I say like cosine of a times cosine of a let's see what that does Oh weird so you could see what that's doing I'm squaring the value so it's kind of squishing it a little bit long the xaxis but of course everything is on the right side because if I square negative I get a positive but I could go to the third power so why don't I say power of cosine of the angle to the third power look at this so you can see that even just doing that gets me this diamond like quality so that could that's really working for the bottom of the heart in a way that's the bottom of the heart but I need to change the top so I need to think about what I'm doing with the Y so again I'm just kind of this is vary in many ways like similar to my Fourier transform epicycles videos there's like conceptually tied here in that I'm messing with the oscillating values as I move around this kind of circular path now let's do something else like let's say well what if I take sine and I multiply the Y value what if I kind of multiply itself by sine of the angle but have like the frequency doubled so if I do this right well that's interesting look what kind of shape I get there hmm what if I multiply it by like a much more extreme amount like five whoa look at that so things are starting to happen and probably actually what would be much smarter for me to try to visually demonstrate this I have to think about this would be to animate the process of this and actually show the separate X and wha X's and Y's moving in similar to the Fourier transform videos but I'm going to kind of move from here and I'm looking over here because I'm I have the actual formula from that Wolfram page that I started with you can sort of see here okay ah look if I have and this is actually using sine 4x + cosine 4 but I think that's just gonna like put it on its side probably but let's let's let's um so let's put some more stuff in here to like think about let's look at this so five times starting with 13 times okay so changing the amplitudes as well so if we do this times a times well let's just give train yes spen it is gift tree I probably should have just put the formula in I don't know why I'm doing it this way I thought this would be interesting classic villain mustache the chat is saying that instead of a heart I've made a classic villain mustache all right I think it's time for me probably just to put the formula in I'm sort of interesting to explore the different possibilities here but ultimately if I'm seeing this equation what I want is third why these interesting numbers right well I'll get to that in a second but let's do cosine of T or minus I don't want to multiply this stuff together losing my mind here so I want to subtract out ah yes so as I'm getting to the top depending okay so this makes sense so let's let's actually put this stuff in let's change this to cosine let's change this to sign right no let's change this to sine sorry let's change this to cosine because I already have done that and then I'm going to say cosine and this is like I've got a 2 a 3 and a 4 2 minus a 3 minus a 4 so you can see what's going on here but I need to see you could see that it's now actually a little bit more squished at that at the bottom then at the top and so what might be interesting here is to think of you know this as well if this is our and then maybe I want R times 2 times this oh look at that because now when it comes to I you can start to see the heart oh but it's upside down so I kind of want negative one times the whole thing because of the way the processing coordinate system is we can say look I've kind of getting a heart there but I've gone to extreme so I should probably get rid of this our thing let's just make r1 and use the actual numbers so we the actual numbers in the formula are 13 5 2 so I can say 13 5 whoops 5 times whoa 13 5 2 and then a cosine of for a just has is not multiplied by any factor so now if I do this let's put parentheses around what am I doing here got too many parentheses here this there we go I look there's the heart and then now I could scale it up by a factor I mean I could just use the scale function but I could have you know basically scale it up by 10 and then I could say negative R times that and there we go so now you have made the heart let's animate it this was very silly my whole like trying to walk into this formula really I just want to like look it up but let's animate it let's have it trace the path of a heart because that'll be really nice so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to create a an ArrayList of P vector objects so if I were doing this in JavaScript this would be a much simpler just plain array and then what I'm going to do is I am going to not have this loop anymore but rather have a global variable called a and I am going to do this same exact thing but I am going to say here that the for loop sorry the for loop will be for every P vector V in the heart draw vertex at V X V Y and then what I'm going to do is each time through draw I am going to make a new vector I'm going to say heart dot add new P vector at some X&Y and then I'm going to increase the angle by a little bit so here we go okay with math I'm so happy my artistic talent is nonexistent but let's at least make the stroke weight a little thicker let's let's add a fill someone give me a nice red color but I feel like it should be like a little bit more a little darker and a little pinkish so let's try that and let's make sure I add clothes here so it closes the shape whoa oh no no no no I do not want clothes I specifically do not want clothes yes that's what I want and now we are making this heart so I challenge you to go and look at these other formulas and try them I'm Simon Tiger has shared with me a ton of other formulism of maybe I'll see if any of those I want to try but you find a formula and make your own heart could you do it in 3d I bet you could make a 3d heart all sorts of stuff and share that with me coding hearts hash tag coding hearts coding love for this wonderful any day of the year we could be making we should be making hearts all day of the year no reason to just do it in February when it's cold outside almost like snow and sleet and everything anyway I love you thanks for watching the coding train and I'll see you soon it looks a little messy at the bottom how dare you yeah it does how dare you insult my heart they think it's probably cuz I have just too many points down there yeah that's better combining this with the fourier stuff would be good here here everybody our is a height divided by maybe like it's four hundred before he got ten so divided by forty let's try that oh this would be a good gift loop let's make the gift loop everybody hold on okay we're gonna make this a gift loop it's winter it's a snowflake yes I see that you have some 3d formulas in yours Simon that is fantastic I don't think I'm gonna get to those today but I really appreciate your your your suggestions you should make them and you should make a video about all your different heart formulas alright hold on hold on okay so hold on it's time for coding train I made this ridiculously terrible video about how to make a gift loop and you should really just go look at Golan Levin's amazing resources and different artists that I mentioned saskia freak and bees and bombs who are doing wonderful things then I made this video which I actually kind of love that makes a heart inprocessing just using like a nice little math formula look at that each time to make a gift loop of the heart for Valentine's Day there I said it's Valentine's Day this is what we're doing alright so first that I need is for this to always end where it started so I have an idea for doing that which is that if what I'm doing is I'm adding these I'm adding the vertices of the heart over and over again when I get to the end all I want to do is start deleting the ones from the beginning so I should go back to that idea of percent so let me actually open up my other so I'm going to open up the gift loop code this is my design so what I need is this at the top I'm gonna go have too many things open oh oh my goodness I need this at the top then I need all my drawing stuff in I should leave that in there I mean oh my Dino I'm standing from the code but I'm just copy pasting from the last one and we get all my drawing stuff and I'm gonna put it in the render function and now the percent the percent is going to tell me what to do with a so that angle I'm gonna have to change legs so let's just first do it this way a equals map percent which goes between 0 and 1/2 between 0 and 2pi so right now if I run this with record and let me let me close this this should just be I've got my gift loop we just move everything out of the way I've got my gift loop here and I want record to false I don't want to record yet so now if I run this we can see it's making the heart oh oh right and then done okay so that's the right idea but it's not looping because ultimately I mean there's a bunch of things I could do because I could say if I record it I mean in a way I'm getting a loop but I want it to like shrink back down to 0 so I need the size so basically I want % I want this to be like actually 1% is between 0 and 0.5 halfway through I want to draw the heart so I'm going to say this is weird but if % is greater than 0.5 is less than 0.5 less than or equal to 0.5 there's probably a better way to do this but I'm going to do it this way right now I'm going to add points otherwise I want to remove the number of points that I've added and I think it actually is just gonna work if I just say heart dot how do I get delete something out of I think if I just delete 0 that'll be like the oldest one as I get so let's try that that removes them all what's going on here oh but I still need to draw I always need to draw it ah so I'm always drawing it no matter what but I'm adding points for the first half and removing points for the second half there we go there's my loop okay so now guess what I should make to add some colors and things oh it should beat people are saying it should beat of course it should be okay okay we're gonna have we're gonna add beating to it okay so there's no reason why the size the size is being controlled by this thing are here so I should say map okay hold on the Wow oh wow no that's a totally separate thing while I'm drawing it ah so hold on so let's so actually let's take this out let's take this so this should this will make it small right right so that makes it small so I can control the size here just while I'm drawing it because I could say R times R times great so now what I want is the R to be so I want an angle to be mapped but the percent between 0 and 1 and maybe between 0 and like 2 pi but like times 4 like I probably want it to like beat like 4 times within just the 1 so I'm going to map that and then our equals map of sine of that angle which goes between negative 1 & 1/2 between like height divided by eighty to height divided by forty so I think this would like map the Sun whose size to a sine wave and the angle is getting mapped from the percent and so this would be and it should be a perfect loop of it beating okay I feel like I need to add more color and stuff to this and kind of offcenter all right so let's see if this is a perfect loop I have no idea if it's a perfect loop its we if something was weird about it oh something is weird it's not deleting all the points this is crazy this is actually kind of a nice effect but I'm not deleting all of the points I did and am I just getting like some left over hold on let's make our I think I thought the math would just sort of work out let's let's take out the beating for a second whoa oh yeah it's not you could see there's like an extra point each time so it actually kind of works the first time but I think I need to remove else remove the heart and then I think actually here if where do I check I guess if percent is it gonna get to exactly one point oh let's say greater than or equal to I mean then heart dot clear no it's still getting an extra point Oh weird why is that point in there that doesn't else heart remove wait I have to think about this first I came close look at that 3d heart the point four percent equals 0.5 yeah right right this is flawed I mean I think it'll actually work when I record it because it's just doing it the first time but I would like it to actually loop I'm just thinking about this here otherwise remove let's just just be sure this is the issue all the way down to three all the way down to four yeah it's got extra points in it so why if I the why they're not the same number of frames oh it's as simple as that it's as simple as that guess what the problem is I'm adding an extra I'm adding that last vertex twice because I have less than equals there so this is actually as simple as just getting rid of that equals there I just want to use percent is less than 0.5 I'm sure somebody in the chat already said this but now you can see this loops perfectly so now what I can do is I can change let's make sure there's nothing in output let's delete whatever is there before I can change record to true I can run this and now we should see if I look in output if I look at all the images and I scroll through them and let's just look at the very last one you can see yep it's kind of that's the end of it so now I can go and I'm like edit this part out but I'm gonna go to where we can speed this up and I'm gonna go to what was the website I used easy gif maker yes so I'm gonna go to this website easy gift com I'm going to choose some files I don't need to I'm gonna wear tonight where is this now or these the hearts yes those are the hearts I mean hit open and upload and make a gift it's got those files I am now going to change the delay time to let's just make it three that seemed good from before three one hundreds of a second make a gif my cat is there making the gif making the gift oh the beating the heart beating cute so I'm gonna go from where I hear so let me also add the heart beating back in I'm gonna add where was that so now I'm gonna add the heart beating back in where I had our change and that oh I uh what time is it all right perfect let me add the heart beating back in so I had that from before where I had are mapped to the result of a sine function and so if I do that I'm pretty sure this is the perfect loop still is that beating too fast slower beating people are saying so it's a slowdown the beating I'm gonna just do 2 pi times 2 is that better I think that's pretty good anyway you can work on you can make your own version of this this is fine for me right now I gotta end this video I am now gonna change record to true I'm going to hit run it's going to finish that I'm gonna look in the folder and I can see I have all the images there I'm just going to check the last one which looks like that and the first one yeah I think this will match up perfectly which basically the first one is empty so I think coming all the way down to zero and back up will work so I'm gonna go the website that I used whoops hold on so the website that I used before although there's a variety different ways you can make a gift stitched out of a bunch of images is this gif maker easy gift calm slash maker so I can click Choose files and I can go to my output directory where I have all those I can hit command a select all the files and then click upload and make a gift so it's now uploading all those images and we can see them all here now I could do all sorts of things to futz with them and I'm curious to add this crossfade frames let's try adding that Oh better bad idea I don't know let's make the delay time 3 100 of a second that's more like 30 frames per second and then it's not exact and then I'm gonna click make a gif and then the cat is going to wait for my gift oh and Mike if it's ready yeah now I can just do save image as and I'm gonna I'm excited to tweet this heart and I'll tweet it later there we go this is done there's my no that's not it where'd I put it hard kiss there it is thank you everybody I love you I hope you enjoyed this special about using special this vid me up about using Matt to draw a heart curve and then animating it as a infinitely looping gif and I I just can't wait to see all of different I just want to be flooded with heart gifts just flood me with art gifts make three big good 3d make them rainbow colors put stars in them and cupcakes and whatever you can think of I'll see you in a future coding challenge good bye MA oh wait what's uh what's the difference okay oh I love that 3d heart picture okay all right everybody yes finally kid Gopi says baa Raghava choked claw that's how I feel as well finally I can go drink I forgot to bring water with me today so I'm excited there's a bunch of videos that can come out and I will see you in Ojai Cody garden with CJ in the chat everyone should check out Cody garden or CJ's channel oh let me do some anymore thank yous that I might have missed okay let's thank you to all the other people watched art gift train and I don't know I think I'm done for today I will be back next Wednesday I'm gonna check my calendar but this is my plan now if you're watching this right now I am going to try to have at least for the next few weeks every week so the way that I work until someone tells me not to do this this way anymore is I do a livestream every Wednesday at 1030 I do a bunch of things during the livestream and then a wonderful Matua Blanchette who works as the editor for the coding train takes everything from the livestream and chops it into separate smaller videos which then get uploaded into different playlists where there's coding challenges or courses I actually made a video yesterday that was not livestream it's like a little extra beginner lesson about create graphics and p5 so I might even upload that this afternoon but I just want to highlight I'm really I think I'm like a little bit stuck here data and api's Schiffman github please come and look let me just go to oh no it's on coding train github I am planning I should pin that repo here it is already pinned I am hoping to make a new playlist and I've been getting suggestions and discussions about what I might include in this think it's probably gonna be approximately 10 to 15 videos and I want to cover really about I'm working with data and API is in JavaScript so things I haven't covered before or things that I covered before that are kind of out of date now from with for a total beginner but the focus won't necessarily be p5 so I will also teach about the fetch function and also look at data API is in node and I will use p5 to do some drawing stuff but I'm at some point I gotta make an outline but if you have suggestions or things that would be good bitesize beginner and data sets I'm looking for cuz I want to look at something with like a CSV data set a mapping data set and maybe a news API these are the kind of things I want to look at okay thank you everybody I will see you next Wednesday or on the various uploads that come I'm so thrilled to have this strange thing happened to me in my life that I am here making videos on YouTube about coding with and and getting to be completely ridiculous if I feel like it which nobody seems to have complain about too much I get complaints a lot of people are like you should you should take yourself more seriously and/or like what kind of like whatever substance are you using to be this weird way that you are and I can assure you that it is just a mild chemical ginger tea tea and caffeine I do I do drink a lot of things with caffeine in it alright good bye I am going to sing you out with s new member s Ben oh wait wait wait wait Matt Chia always says give me some green screenshots of four thumbnails because look it's my invisible computer this is what people this I'm really just going for clicks right clickbait clickbait expressions alright that's good enough goodbye everybody
