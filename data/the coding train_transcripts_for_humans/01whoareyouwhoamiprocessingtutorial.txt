00:01 - Okay, look, let's take a step back for a second
00:03 - and let me introduce myself a little more properly.
00:06 - My name is (this is absurd but I'm writing my name over here
00:09 - on the board but) my name is [enunciating] Daniel Sheef Mon
00:15 - pronounced 'Shiffman'
00:16 - but I don't know, you can say Sheef Mon if you want
00:20 - and I work at a place called ITP which you can find out more about at
00:24 - ITP.nyu.edu
00:26 - It's a two-year graduate program and I
00:29 - teach a lot of programming courses here, one of which
00:32 - in particular is a course called 'Introduction
00:35 - to Computational Media' in which the students
00:39 - learn - most them for the very first time - how to program the computer
00:43 - and we use for that course something else that I participate
00:47 - in developing, called, 'Processing,' and you can find out more about Processing
00:54 - at Processing.org so this is who I am the kind of context, at least, of what I'm doing
00:59 - I imagine I'm making these videos just to try them, to learn more about teaching -
01:04 - to learn more about teaching in this strange
01:06 - new context as well as to supplement the course that I'm teaching here
01:12 - but it is my hope that all the things will kind of feed into each other in a nice
01:16 - way and that there will be some population, however small, whether it's
01:20 - three people - three hundred - three thousand - three billion - that are
01:23 - interested in this content and that this stuff that I'm going to talk about
01:27 - and demonstrate over many many, many, many, many videos
01:30 - on will be interesting to help you with - [humorously] I don't know -
01:34 - I'm really trying too hard to justify this, but I'm just doing it, you can turn it off at
01:38 - anytime you like. Okay now, who are you?
01:41 - I don't know. I would be interested in hearing from you.
01:44 - But let me say a few things: this video series
01:48 - is for the complete and total beginner.
01:51 - You don't need to know anything.
01:52 - That's not entirely true. You do need to access to a computer -
01:55 - you probably already do if you're watching this video - you need to know
01:58 - some basic stuff:
01:59 - how to download a piece of software, how to install it,
02:02 - yeah, how to type - that kind of stuff but really that's it.
02:05 - I will assume no knowledge whatsoever about anything that has to do with
02:09 - programming.
02:10 - we're going to really, really slowly in great detail
02:13 - build-up stuff from the beginning.
02:15 - So if you already know some stuff about programming, the nice thing about these
02:20 - video series is I'm trying to keep the videos
02:22 - to between 2 and 20 minutes.
02:26 - really I want them to be like 5 or 10 minute videos but you can just skip some
02:29 - You can jump ahead. If all you're interested in how to, like, parse
02:32 - a JSON feed and get it into your Processing sketch, that's probably going to be video,
02:36 - like, number 50 or 30
02:39 - or 22 - somewhere further ahead
02:41 - (it's not made yet, by the way. It doesn't exist) but you can jump ahead and do that.
02:44 - The other thing I should mention it I made some videos last year
02:47 - so as you're watching them if you suddenly think that I look much younger
02:51 - or have a strangely different length of beard,
02:54 - it's because some of the videos from last year are going to be kind of spliced
02:58 - in here although I may end up
02:59 - remaking them if they're out-of-date
or needing some
03:04 - extra touch-up - or that sort of thing.
03:06 - So that's who I am. That's who you are -
03:10 - - or maybe you are, and you can let me know if
you are somebody different.
