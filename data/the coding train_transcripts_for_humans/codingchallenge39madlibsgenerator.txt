With timestamps:

00:00 - hello and welcome to another coding
00:02 - challenge in this coding challenge I'm
00:03 - gonna demonstrate a lot of different
00:04 - techniques and what I'm gonna do is I'm
00:06 - going to build a mad libs generator from
00:08 - scratch in the browser using javascript
00:11 - and reading data from a Google sheet so
00:14 - there's gonna be a lot of pieces to this
00:15 - but hopefully by the end you'll learn
00:17 - something and be able to take a creative
00:19 - riff on what I'm doing to do something
00:21 - that's more original than me just
00:22 - literally creating the exact Mad Libs
00:24 - now you might be wondering what mad libs
00:25 - are it's a word game where you have to
00:28 - come up with nouns and adjectives and
00:30 - adverbs words of different parts of
00:32 - speech and those get substituted into a
00:34 - story and then when you read the story
00:35 - it's funny you know I've been thinking a
00:37 - lot about the history of Mad Libs and
00:40 - the creators of Mad Libs Leonard Stern
00:42 - and Roger price and you know they must
00:45 - be laughing all the way to the shoe
00:47 - where's my drum roll boom - I have to
00:50 - credit Josh Gordon for that joke I don't
00:51 - know if he came up with it but I told me
00:53 - that joke that's okay but bad joke aside
00:57 - um let's see what happens if we can try
00:59 - to create a mad libs generator in the
01:01 - browser so the first thing I want to do
01:03 - first of all is come up with the actual
01:06 - structure of the mad libs itself so I
01:09 - have here a text file and this is what
01:12 - it's going to be blank exclamation point
01:17 - they said blankly as they jumped into
01:20 - their blank and flew off with their
01:23 - blankety-blank s-- so I need an
01:25 - exclamation an adverb a noun an
01:27 - adjective and a plural noun so I could
01:29 - say links they said joyfully as they
01:33 - jumped into their unicorn and flew off
01:36 - with their colorful rainbows right so
01:39 - this is the idea of a mad lib so the
01:41 - first thing I want to do is figure out
01:42 - where am I going to pull the words from
01:45 - you know with a project like this I
01:48 - probably shouldn't go straight to making
01:49 - the data source and I should just
01:51 - actually do the mad lib generation in a
01:54 - JavaScript program and then connect the
01:56 - data source but let's not take my own
01:58 - advice and go backwards so yeah nobody
02:02 - people thumb there's a lot of thumbs
02:03 - down a lot of dad joke yeah in sorry
02:09 - that was terrible maybe we'll edit the
02:11 - joke out anyway coming back
02:13 - start this video over so what not one
02:16 - thing I want to do is I first I want to
02:17 - make a Google sheet so I'm gonna make oh
02:19 - no I don't wanna make a Google sheet
02:21 - actually I'm gonna do this with a Google
02:23 - Form so I'm gonna make a new Google Form
02:25 - more Google form and this is my no
02:30 - thanks
02:31 - this is my mad libs form and I need to
02:35 - create a bunch of questions so I just
02:39 - want a text question where do where do I
02:41 - find short answer so I want an adverb
02:45 - and then uh and it's gonna be required
02:49 - and then I want a duplicate I want what
02:57 - did I say I wanted an adverb no
02:59 - exclamation exclamation then I want an
03:05 - adverb duplicate then I want a noun
03:11 - adjective plural noun noun noun
03:15 - duplicate adjective duplicate plural
03:21 - noun and then I can trash this one and
03:29 - save this is a matte lips form and what
03:35 - I want to do now is share this get a
03:38 - shareable link shortened URL those of
03:40 - you who are watching this on the live
03:42 - stream
03:43 - somebody copy the screenshot that copy
03:45 - that down share it in the chat
03:47 - I'm not gonna leave it up to Mark and
03:49 - then a police family friendly language
03:51 - please if you wouldn't mind and I should
03:54 - be able to do responses and connect this
03:57 - to a new spreadsheet and here now is my
04:01 - spreadsheet so as people submit
04:03 - responses I should see those responses
04:05 - appear in this particular spreadsheet
04:08 - and in the chat tell me if nobody was
04:10 - able to get it and I'll sort of pause
04:12 - making this video and edit the pause out
04:14 - but for right now I'm going to keep
04:15 - going okay and people in the chat are
04:18 - pointing out by the way that I could use
04:19 - one of my other video examples like the
04:22 - rita library which gives you random
04:23 - nouns and
04:24 - random words I could query something
04:25 - called word Nik but in this coding
04:27 - challenge I want to show you how to get
04:28 - aggregate data from users and use them
04:31 - in your JavaScript program and of course
04:32 - you could write a database program you
04:34 - could spin up a web server in my
04:36 - database and all this stuff or you could
04:38 - connect to some service and save your
04:40 - data but what I'm suggesting to you if
04:41 - you want to prototype your idea and get
04:43 - data from users really quickly a Google
04:45 - Form and a spreadsheet is a really quick
04:47 - and easy way to do it ok I'm back I
04:50 - paused for a bit to let people submit
04:51 - stuff and you can see now people are
04:53 - submitting into the Google form and I've
04:55 - got lots of exclamations lots of adverbs
04:57 - lots of nouns lots of adjectives so what
04:59 - I need to do now is get this data into
05:02 - my program and there are a variety of
05:04 - ways you could do this there's something
05:06 - called shih-tzu sh e ETSU comm there are
05:11 - probably other JavaScript libraries and
05:13 - frameworks for grabbing data from a
05:16 - Google sheet but I'm going to use
05:18 - something called tabletop J s1 it's open
05:21 - source and free and it's pretty easy to
05:23 - use so what I'm going to do here is the
05:26 - first thing I want to do is grab the
05:28 - tabletop J's library so I'm on this
05:30 - github repository all the links I'm
05:32 - using in this video will be in the
05:33 - description of this video and I
05:34 - apologize for my scratchy voice got a
05:36 - bit of a cold today so I'm gonna click
05:39 - under source I'm gonna go to tabletop j
05:42 - s then I'm gonna go to raw and I'm just
05:45 - gonna save this javascript library into
05:48 - my libraries folder tabletop J s so now
05:53 - you'll see in my code here what I have
05:56 - is I have a text file where I'm keeping
05:58 - track of my mad libs I've got my
06:00 - JavaScript code I've got an HTML file
06:03 - I have p5 libraries because I'm using p5
06:05 - as I usually do as I sort of base
06:08 - JavaScript framework to use for various
06:11 - Dom manipulation tasks and then also
06:13 - tabletop Jas for getting the data so now
06:16 - what I need to do is figure out how can
06:18 - I get the data from that spreadsheet so
06:21 - let's look here and oops let me go back
06:25 - to tabletop j/s and I'm gonna look at
06:29 - the readme so this is how easy all I
06:35 - need to do is call this tabletop dot and
06:37 - knit
06:38 - function and I need to give it a key and
06:40 - a callback function and simple sheet
06:43 - being true means I'm gonna work with the
06:45 - sheet that just only has one tab so this
06:48 - is gonna make things really really easy
06:50 - so all I need basically is to take this
06:53 - code I'm gonna copy paste this code and
06:55 - I'm gonna go to my code and I'm gonna
06:58 - put it in setup and let's just see what
07:01 - happens when I do this so now I'm gonna
07:05 - come back here that refresh now table
07:07 - top is not defined so I saved that
07:09 - JavaScript library but I forgot to add
07:12 - it to my index.html so I need to also
07:16 - have a reference to it in index.html
07:19 - let's try again and we can see this data
07:23 - came in now this data came in from some
07:25 - demo spreadsheet available from that
07:29 - table top makes available to use with an
07:31 - example I need to get the key to my
07:34 - spreadsheet so if I go over to my
07:36 - spreadsheet here where is the key well
07:38 - it's just this crazy long thing now this
07:40 - actually isn't going to work because I
07:42 - missed a crucial step but I'm gonna copy
07:43 - paste this long key here and I'm gonna
07:47 - come back here and where am I in my code
07:51 - I'm gonna add this here right so that's
07:54 - the key so if I add this here I should
07:56 - see everything in the spreadsheet here
07:58 - just in that data object so I'm gonna
08:01 - come back and hit refresh but I'm gonna
08:03 - get an error it says access control
08:05 - allow origin header is present on the
08:07 - requested resource it is not allowed
08:09 - access the reason why is not allowed
08:12 - access is in order for this spreadsheet
08:14 - to be available to this program in this
08:16 - very simple way without authenticating
08:18 - in any way whatsoever I need to publish
08:20 - it to the web so there's an option in
08:23 - Google sheet which is here where I can
08:25 - go under file and look here publish to
08:28 - the web so again I wouldn't do this with
08:31 - like hey everybody send me your social
08:32 - security numbers and/or username and
08:34 - passwords I wouldn't use a Google sheet
08:36 - for that but was the sort of quick
08:38 - crowdsourced forward you can do that so
08:42 - I'm gonna do publish to the web and it
08:44 - should say entire document web page I
08:48 - think that's all I need and I'm gonna
08:50 - say publish
08:52 - and I sure you want to publish yes okay
08:54 - and now it's published and I should be
08:59 - able to go back and refresh my program
09:02 - look at this this is beautiful this is
09:06 - live this is live as people every time i
09:09 - refresh as people enter submissions I've
09:11 - got more and more and you can look at
09:12 - this I've got an array of objects
09:14 - adjective adverb exclamation noun plural
09:17 - noun and the timestamp so there's not a
09:20 - lot of metadata here other than the
09:21 - timestamp but you know a Google Form you
09:23 - can ask people for lots of things you
09:25 - can say hey make a Google Form for
09:27 - people to type out their dreams so we
09:29 - wake up in the night enter their dreams
09:30 - you've got this vast spreadsheet mean
09:32 - you need to have an audience and figure
09:33 - out a way to people but this is a quick
09:34 - way to get data I'm excited about this I
09:37 - hope you are too
09:37 - so this is really easy now so now in my
09:40 - program what I want to do is I want to
09:43 - clean this up a little bit so one thing
09:45 - I want to do is I want to pull this
09:46 - function out because this is really
09:47 - where all my work is going to happen and
09:50 - I want to make this a separate function
09:52 - which is a generate Madlib actually you
09:57 - know what I want to do actually is I
09:58 - just want to I want to just say got data
10:00 - I'm just gonna call this got data and I
10:05 - what I want to do is have a global
10:07 - variable quick solution to just have a
10:09 - global variable called all data it could
10:14 - probably come up with a better name than
10:15 - that and I'm gonna say all data equals I
10:20 - know what I'm just gonna call it data I
10:21 - have to call it sheet now it's called
10:25 - data data equals and I'll just call this
10:32 - stuff so basically what I want to do
10:36 - here is when i refresh this page I now
10:39 - have a global variable called data that
10:41 - has all of the entries in it so now let
10:44 - me let me let me here also create a
10:47 - button let me say create button generate
10:52 - Madlib and I'm gonna save our button
10:55 - equals create button I'm gonna say
10:57 - button dot mousepressed
11:03 - button dot mousepressed generate so I'm
11:07 - gonna create a function that generates
11:12 - the Madlib here so I just want to make
11:14 - sure this is working
11:15 - I'm gonna say console dot log generate
11:19 - whoops and then I want to add something
11:22 - I want to go and just into my page I
11:24 - just want to take this and I want to put
11:27 - it into the page just so people can see
11:29 - it so I'm gonna make a paragraph at the
11:31 - top that has that so we can see oh and I
11:37 - forgot to add to my JavaScript code p5
11:40 - by default creates a html5 canvas for
11:43 - drawing but I don't need a canvas so you
11:45 - can see this is my page now it has it
11:50 - has sorry it has all of the it has the
11:52 - Mad Libs listed there and has a button
11:54 - now so whenever I click generate all I'm
11:56 - doing right now is console logging the
11:57 - word generate but I now want to generate
11:59 - a version of the Madlib from all the
12:03 - stuff that people have sent ok so now
12:05 - here we go
12:06 - so let's do that so first thing I need
12:08 - is this text and there's a variety of
12:13 - ways I could do this I'm gonna do
12:15 - something I'm gonna say text equals I'm
12:18 - gonna make this a global variable but
12:21 - what I'm gonna do instead of these
12:22 - blanks is I'm gonna create like a secret
12:24 - code for myself
12:27 - exclamation they said adverb I'm just
12:34 - gonna put this into their noun and flew
12:38 - off with their adjective and plural noun
12:47 - so I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna do
12:53 - this as like a secret code to myself
12:54 - because I what I'm saying is whenever I
12:57 - say dollar sign dollar sign the name of
12:59 - something dollar sign dollar sign this
13:01 - is something I want to search for in
13:02 - that string and replace so the first
13:04 - thing I just want to do is say create P
13:10 - create P what that text so let's just
13:14 - see if that appears
13:16 - okay so that appears now what I need to
13:18 - do is run I can use the replace function
13:20 - with regular expressions to replace
13:23 - those things with data that's coming
13:25 - from the database itself so let me look
13:27 - at this again the data is a big array
13:29 - and each object has now what I could do
13:33 - here oh I wish I had made do you think I
13:35 - could change this I wish I didn't have
13:37 - that space there that might cause me
13:38 - some issues it might be fine but I'm
13:41 - gonna go back to the spreadsheet just to
13:43 - be sure about this I'm gonna change this
13:45 - heading to just plural noun and then I'm
13:49 - going to I'm gonna go back to my code
13:52 - run it again when we look at data we
13:54 - look at one of them great plural now so
13:56 - what I actually want to do is I want to
13:59 - have these things match what's in here
14:01 - in the regular expression I don't know
14:03 - if this is really gonna be useful but
14:05 - let me just match it exactly exclamation
14:09 - adverb I'm going to add a noun adjective
14:18 - plural noun okay so I just wanted to
14:21 - adjust that have the capitalization
14:23 - match because what I want to do is what
14:27 - I'm gonna do the following
14:29 - okay thinking about this I want to say
14:31 - var Madlib equals text dot replace and I
14:35 - want to match anytime there's dollar
14:37 - sign dollar sign dot star question mark
14:40 - dollar sign dollar sign so I want to
14:42 - match any place where I have dollar sign
14:44 - dollar sign dot star and then I just
14:46 - want I'm gonna just have a function
14:47 - called replacer that way
14:49 - I can like kind of do this in its own
14:51 - function right remember with the replace
14:53 - method in JavaScript I can pass a
14:55 - callback and I want to capture this
15:01 - middle thing as a group so the arguments
15:07 - are the full match and then group one
15:09 - which is really the part of speech so
15:12 - what I want to do is now say I have this
15:15 - okay so let me just let me just return
15:19 - test let me just make sure this is
15:23 - working so this whole thing is working
15:25 - and I want to create P with that
15:27 - Madeline so what I did is I'm looking
15:29 - for
15:29 - anytime I put this secret code in the
15:32 - text I want to match it and then replace
15:35 - it with the word test so let's refresh
15:37 - this uh that didn't seem to work so
15:41 - let's let's look at text as that and
15:44 - let's uh let's let me try my regular
15:47 - expression oh you know what these are
15:50 - meta characters the dollar sign forgot
15:53 - is end of line so I need to escape that
15:55 - I totally forgot so these have to be
15:57 - escaped so I maybe I should have picked
16:00 - something else as my secret code but
16:01 - those have to be escaped so that should
16:04 - do it
16:04 - great so you can see test as oh and what
16:06 - did I forget now it only did the first
16:08 - one so I need the global flag so I need
16:11 - the slash g4 that's the global flag to
16:14 - do all of them so it tests they said
16:16 - test as they jumped into their test and
16:18 - flew off with their test test but now
16:21 - what I can do is I could replace it with
16:24 - the part of speech let's just see what
16:27 - that does
16:28 - exclamation they said adverb as they
16:30 - jumped into their noun and flew off with
16:32 - their adjective plural noun this is
16:33 - great because now I have the kind of
16:36 - thing it is which I can use to look up
16:41 - the particular thing in this array so
16:44 - the first thing I might want to do is
16:46 - just pick a random element from that
16:49 - array so let me pick a random element
16:52 - from an array so I'm gonna say entry
16:56 - equals random data now this data just an
17:00 - array itself it is so the random
17:03 - function in p5 is just a function if you
17:05 - give it an array it'll give you a random
17:07 - thing from that all right let me just
17:08 - show you here in the console random data
17:12 - I got one I got another one I got
17:15 - another one
17:16 - etc etc etc so you can see if somebody
17:19 - put that in someone's really trying to
17:21 - mess with me and put that in as an entry
17:23 - I see you out there who's ever doing
17:25 - that okay so I pick a random one and
17:29 - then what do I return data now normally
17:33 - in JavaScript this is a this is a thing
17:35 - that you might not be aware of oh I'm
17:37 - excited about this and I'm gonna be
17:39 - squished something's wrong with an
17:40 - aspect ratio of this camera
17:42 - if you have an object entry and I say
17:49 - now : why don't I say dog when I could
17:53 - say rainbow right so this is my object
17:57 - normally you would say entry dot noun
18:01 - and you would get rainbow but guess what
18:04 - another way to say this is entry bracket
18:08 - bracket now this looks like it suddenly
18:10 - is an array and I would need to give it
18:12 - an index but I don't have to if I give
18:14 - it a string like noun this is actually
18:17 - looking up the property that is named
18:19 - with the text inside that string so I
18:22 - can dynamically pull a particular thing
18:24 - based on what part of speech I matched
18:27 - by saying return entry bracket POS right
18:34 - remember I matched exclamation or adverb
18:38 - or noun and in those objects that's what
18:41 - those things are called exclamation
18:42 - adverb or noun so now if I do this and
18:45 - go back here oh Smurf they said lively
18:49 - as they jumped into their Phoebus and
18:50 - flew off with their low forms I'm a
18:52 - little bit afraid to just keep doing
18:54 - this because I'm hoping that people are
18:55 - using family friendly happy-go-lucky
18:59 - language but let's try let's be bold to
19:01 - try one more hooray they said carefully
19:04 - as they jumped into their lamb and flew
19:05 - off with their tall bananas so we've got
19:08 - some great options here and you can see
19:09 - instantly this every time i refresh the
19:12 - page I'm gonna get more and more
19:13 - possibilities and there's so many so
19:15 - much I could do more with this right you
19:17 - know this is a very simple Madlib I
19:18 - could do some natural language
19:20 - processing like I could make sure it's
19:22 - actually a plural noun and if it's not
19:23 - it could PluralEyes it or I could check
19:24 - to see if it is a valid down um there's
19:27 - so many things I could do in terms of
19:30 - how to making this better in terms of a
19:32 - mad libs generator but what I'm asking
19:34 - you to do it in a way that if you're
19:37 - watching this video is think about what
19:39 - might be a creative experiment that's
19:41 - your own weird word game possibility
19:44 - that you could do where you crowdsource
19:46 - data from people so make a Google Form
19:48 - ask your friends to fill out that google
19:51 - form get a JavaScript program that reads
19:53 - from that Google form and visualize what
19:55 - people
19:56 - entered mash it up make a poem out of it
19:59 - whatever I'm sure you have more creative
20:01 - ideas and strange weird internet things
20:04 - that you could try to make by doing this
20:06 - idea but it's a really quick way of
20:07 - having an instant database with
20:09 - crowd-sourced information so hopefully
20:12 - you got something from seeing this
20:13 - little Mad Libs generator if you make
20:15 - your own actual mad libs generator

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to another coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm gonna demonstrate a lot of different techniques and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to build a mad libs generator from scratch in the browser using javascript and reading data from a Google sheet so there's gonna be a lot of pieces to this but hopefully by the end you'll learn something and be able to take a creative riff on what I'm doing to do something that's more original than me just literally creating the exact Mad Libs now you might be wondering what mad libs are it's a word game where you have to come up with nouns and adjectives and adverbs words of different parts of speech and those get substituted into a story and then when you read the story it's funny you know I've been thinking a lot about the history of Mad Libs and the creators of Mad Libs Leonard Stern and Roger price and you know they must be laughing all the way to the shoe where's my drum roll boom I have to credit Josh Gordon for that joke I don't know if he came up with it but I told me that joke that's okay but bad joke aside um let's see what happens if we can try to create a mad libs generator in the browser so the first thing I want to do first of all is come up with the actual structure of the mad libs itself so I have here a text file and this is what it's going to be blank exclamation point they said blankly as they jumped into their blank and flew off with their blanketyblank s so I need an exclamation an adverb a noun an adjective and a plural noun so I could say links they said joyfully as they jumped into their unicorn and flew off with their colorful rainbows right so this is the idea of a mad lib so the first thing I want to do is figure out where am I going to pull the words from you know with a project like this I probably shouldn't go straight to making the data source and I should just actually do the mad lib generation in a JavaScript program and then connect the data source but let's not take my own advice and go backwards so yeah nobody people thumb there's a lot of thumbs down a lot of dad joke yeah in sorry that was terrible maybe we'll edit the joke out anyway coming back start this video over so what not one thing I want to do is I first I want to make a Google sheet so I'm gonna make oh no I don't wanna make a Google sheet actually I'm gonna do this with a Google Form so I'm gonna make a new Google Form more Google form and this is my no thanks this is my mad libs form and I need to create a bunch of questions so I just want a text question where do where do I find short answer so I want an adverb and then uh and it's gonna be required and then I want a duplicate I want what did I say I wanted an adverb no exclamation exclamation then I want an adverb duplicate then I want a noun adjective plural noun noun noun duplicate adjective duplicate plural noun and then I can trash this one and save this is a matte lips form and what I want to do now is share this get a shareable link shortened URL those of you who are watching this on the live stream somebody copy the screenshot that copy that down share it in the chat I'm not gonna leave it up to Mark and then a police family friendly language please if you wouldn't mind and I should be able to do responses and connect this to a new spreadsheet and here now is my spreadsheet so as people submit responses I should see those responses appear in this particular spreadsheet and in the chat tell me if nobody was able to get it and I'll sort of pause making this video and edit the pause out but for right now I'm going to keep going okay and people in the chat are pointing out by the way that I could use one of my other video examples like the rita library which gives you random nouns and random words I could query something called word Nik but in this coding challenge I want to show you how to get aggregate data from users and use them in your JavaScript program and of course you could write a database program you could spin up a web server in my database and all this stuff or you could connect to some service and save your data but what I'm suggesting to you if you want to prototype your idea and get data from users really quickly a Google Form and a spreadsheet is a really quick and easy way to do it ok I'm back I paused for a bit to let people submit stuff and you can see now people are submitting into the Google form and I've got lots of exclamations lots of adverbs lots of nouns lots of adjectives so what I need to do now is get this data into my program and there are a variety of ways you could do this there's something called shihtzu sh e ETSU comm there are probably other JavaScript libraries and frameworks for grabbing data from a Google sheet but I'm going to use something called tabletop J s1 it's open source and free and it's pretty easy to use so what I'm going to do here is the first thing I want to do is grab the tabletop J's library so I'm on this github repository all the links I'm using in this video will be in the description of this video and I apologize for my scratchy voice got a bit of a cold today so I'm gonna click under source I'm gonna go to tabletop j s then I'm gonna go to raw and I'm just gonna save this javascript library into my libraries folder tabletop J s so now you'll see in my code here what I have is I have a text file where I'm keeping track of my mad libs I've got my JavaScript code I've got an HTML file I have p5 libraries because I'm using p5 as I usually do as I sort of base JavaScript framework to use for various Dom manipulation tasks and then also tabletop Jas for getting the data so now what I need to do is figure out how can I get the data from that spreadsheet so let's look here and oops let me go back to tabletop j/s and I'm gonna look at the readme so this is how easy all I need to do is call this tabletop dot and knit function and I need to give it a key and a callback function and simple sheet being true means I'm gonna work with the sheet that just only has one tab so this is gonna make things really really easy so all I need basically is to take this code I'm gonna copy paste this code and I'm gonna go to my code and I'm gonna put it in setup and let's just see what happens when I do this so now I'm gonna come back here that refresh now table top is not defined so I saved that JavaScript library but I forgot to add it to my index.html so I need to also have a reference to it in index.html let's try again and we can see this data came in now this data came in from some demo spreadsheet available from that table top makes available to use with an example I need to get the key to my spreadsheet so if I go over to my spreadsheet here where is the key well it's just this crazy long thing now this actually isn't going to work because I missed a crucial step but I'm gonna copy paste this long key here and I'm gonna come back here and where am I in my code I'm gonna add this here right so that's the key so if I add this here I should see everything in the spreadsheet here just in that data object so I'm gonna come back and hit refresh but I'm gonna get an error it says access control allow origin header is present on the requested resource it is not allowed access the reason why is not allowed access is in order for this spreadsheet to be available to this program in this very simple way without authenticating in any way whatsoever I need to publish it to the web so there's an option in Google sheet which is here where I can go under file and look here publish to the web so again I wouldn't do this with like hey everybody send me your social security numbers and/or username and passwords I wouldn't use a Google sheet for that but was the sort of quick crowdsourced forward you can do that so I'm gonna do publish to the web and it should say entire document web page I think that's all I need and I'm gonna say publish and I sure you want to publish yes okay and now it's published and I should be able to go back and refresh my program look at this this is beautiful this is live this is live as people every time i refresh as people enter submissions I've got more and more and you can look at this I've got an array of objects adjective adverb exclamation noun plural noun and the timestamp so there's not a lot of metadata here other than the timestamp but you know a Google Form you can ask people for lots of things you can say hey make a Google Form for people to type out their dreams so we wake up in the night enter their dreams you've got this vast spreadsheet mean you need to have an audience and figure out a way to people but this is a quick way to get data I'm excited about this I hope you are too so this is really easy now so now in my program what I want to do is I want to clean this up a little bit so one thing I want to do is I want to pull this function out because this is really where all my work is going to happen and I want to make this a separate function which is a generate Madlib actually you know what I want to do actually is I just want to I want to just say got data I'm just gonna call this got data and I what I want to do is have a global variable quick solution to just have a global variable called all data it could probably come up with a better name than that and I'm gonna say all data equals I know what I'm just gonna call it data I have to call it sheet now it's called data data equals and I'll just call this stuff so basically what I want to do here is when i refresh this page I now have a global variable called data that has all of the entries in it so now let me let me let me here also create a button let me say create button generate Madlib and I'm gonna save our button equals create button I'm gonna say button dot mousepressed button dot mousepressed generate so I'm gonna create a function that generates the Madlib here so I just want to make sure this is working I'm gonna say console dot log generate whoops and then I want to add something I want to go and just into my page I just want to take this and I want to put it into the page just so people can see it so I'm gonna make a paragraph at the top that has that so we can see oh and I forgot to add to my JavaScript code p5 by default creates a html5 canvas for drawing but I don't need a canvas so you can see this is my page now it has it has sorry it has all of the it has the Mad Libs listed there and has a button now so whenever I click generate all I'm doing right now is console logging the word generate but I now want to generate a version of the Madlib from all the stuff that people have sent ok so now here we go so let's do that so first thing I need is this text and there's a variety of ways I could do this I'm gonna do something I'm gonna say text equals I'm gonna make this a global variable but what I'm gonna do instead of these blanks is I'm gonna create like a secret code for myself exclamation they said adverb I'm just gonna put this into their noun and flew off with their adjective and plural noun so I'm gonna I'm gonna just I'm gonna do this as like a secret code to myself because I what I'm saying is whenever I say dollar sign dollar sign the name of something dollar sign dollar sign this is something I want to search for in that string and replace so the first thing I just want to do is say create P create P what that text so let's just see if that appears okay so that appears now what I need to do is run I can use the replace function with regular expressions to replace those things with data that's coming from the database itself so let me look at this again the data is a big array and each object has now what I could do here oh I wish I had made do you think I could change this I wish I didn't have that space there that might cause me some issues it might be fine but I'm gonna go back to the spreadsheet just to be sure about this I'm gonna change this heading to just plural noun and then I'm going to I'm gonna go back to my code run it again when we look at data we look at one of them great plural now so what I actually want to do is I want to have these things match what's in here in the regular expression I don't know if this is really gonna be useful but let me just match it exactly exclamation adverb I'm going to add a noun adjective plural noun okay so I just wanted to adjust that have the capitalization match because what I want to do is what I'm gonna do the following okay thinking about this I want to say var Madlib equals text dot replace and I want to match anytime there's dollar sign dollar sign dot star question mark dollar sign dollar sign so I want to match any place where I have dollar sign dollar sign dot star and then I just want I'm gonna just have a function called replacer that way I can like kind of do this in its own function right remember with the replace method in JavaScript I can pass a callback and I want to capture this middle thing as a group so the arguments are the full match and then group one which is really the part of speech so what I want to do is now say I have this okay so let me just let me just return test let me just make sure this is working so this whole thing is working and I want to create P with that Madeline so what I did is I'm looking for anytime I put this secret code in the text I want to match it and then replace it with the word test so let's refresh this uh that didn't seem to work so let's let's look at text as that and let's uh let's let me try my regular expression oh you know what these are meta characters the dollar sign forgot is end of line so I need to escape that I totally forgot so these have to be escaped so I maybe I should have picked something else as my secret code but those have to be escaped so that should do it great so you can see test as oh and what did I forget now it only did the first one so I need the global flag so I need the slash g4 that's the global flag to do all of them so it tests they said test as they jumped into their test and flew off with their test test but now what I can do is I could replace it with the part of speech let's just see what that does exclamation they said adverb as they jumped into their noun and flew off with their adjective plural noun this is great because now I have the kind of thing it is which I can use to look up the particular thing in this array so the first thing I might want to do is just pick a random element from that array so let me pick a random element from an array so I'm gonna say entry equals random data now this data just an array itself it is so the random function in p5 is just a function if you give it an array it'll give you a random thing from that all right let me just show you here in the console random data I got one I got another one I got another one etc etc etc so you can see if somebody put that in someone's really trying to mess with me and put that in as an entry I see you out there who's ever doing that okay so I pick a random one and then what do I return data now normally in JavaScript this is a this is a thing that you might not be aware of oh I'm excited about this and I'm gonna be squished something's wrong with an aspect ratio of this camera if you have an object entry and I say now why don't I say dog when I could say rainbow right so this is my object normally you would say entry dot noun and you would get rainbow but guess what another way to say this is entry bracket bracket now this looks like it suddenly is an array and I would need to give it an index but I don't have to if I give it a string like noun this is actually looking up the property that is named with the text inside that string so I can dynamically pull a particular thing based on what part of speech I matched by saying return entry bracket POS right remember I matched exclamation or adverb or noun and in those objects that's what those things are called exclamation adverb or noun so now if I do this and go back here oh Smurf they said lively as they jumped into their Phoebus and flew off with their low forms I'm a little bit afraid to just keep doing this because I'm hoping that people are using family friendly happygolucky language but let's try let's be bold to try one more hooray they said carefully as they jumped into their lamb and flew off with their tall bananas so we've got some great options here and you can see instantly this every time i refresh the page I'm gonna get more and more possibilities and there's so many so much I could do more with this right you know this is a very simple Madlib I could do some natural language processing like I could make sure it's actually a plural noun and if it's not it could PluralEyes it or I could check to see if it is a valid down um there's so many things I could do in terms of how to making this better in terms of a mad libs generator but what I'm asking you to do it in a way that if you're watching this video is think about what might be a creative experiment that's your own weird word game possibility that you could do where you crowdsource data from people so make a Google Form ask your friends to fill out that google form get a JavaScript program that reads from that Google form and visualize what people entered mash it up make a poem out of it whatever I'm sure you have more creative ideas and strange weird internet things that you could try to make by doing this idea but it's a really quick way of having an instant database with crowdsourced information so hopefully you got something from seeing this little Mad Libs generator if you make your own actual mad libs generator please share it with me so I can take a look and be inspired by your own work and I'll see you in a future coding challenge
