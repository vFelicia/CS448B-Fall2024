00:12 - oh shoot
00:21 - [Music]
00:35 - [Music]
00:52 - [Music]
01:19 - alright this is my test to determine if
01:24 - YouTube is lying to me or not because
01:27 - very briefly before I started
01:31 - live-streaming I was poking around this
01:33 - audio library which browse and download
01:36 - free music for your project
01:38 - attribution not required of course I
01:40 - don't mind using music where attribution
01:42 - is required and I went to dark and I
01:45 - went to classical and I found
01:49 - Beethoven's fifth symphony there's all
01:51 - sorts of other stuff I could try as I
02:00 - feel like I need something for the 4th
02:02 - dimension because this is the coding
02:05 - train live episode where we will enter
02:10 - [Music]
02:12 - dimension that's how I said let's try
02:18 - this one where we will enter
02:22 - [Music]
02:28 - to mention
02:38 - all right anyway let me get a move on
02:41 - here I've got lots of time where do I
02:43 - got nowhere to be nothing to do so what
02:46 - you're seeing here by the way is what
02:52 - you're seeing here is a processing
02:54 - sketch that I made this morning let me
02:56 - correct the weird nonsense that I was
02:59 - playing with here messing around with it
03:04 - should be cosine negative sine sine
03:06 - cosine cosine negative sine cosine
03:10 - negative sine sine cosine okay so this
03:12 - should be if I've done everything
03:15 - correctly
03:16 - a spinning 3d cube with perspective but
03:23 - the renderer is the P 2d engine and this
03:29 - is my last piece of space melon it
03:34 - erases whatever is on my body revealing
03:37 - what is behind it will provide me with
03:41 - the energy that I need also must hope
03:54 - this camera is off erase this whiteboard
04:03 - I'm going to draw some diagrams and I'm
04:09 - just gonna get started this I feel
04:10 - remarkably ready to tackle this problem
04:15 - having done what I did this morning as
04:17 - much of a disasters that was I think I
04:20 - don't know I don't know about this white
04:24 - board eraser thingy that I've purchased
04:28 - from the internet is working a little
04:29 - bit better okay
04:35 - so just in case you didn't tune in this
04:38 - morning I did about a two-hour live
04:40 - stream programming this and the idea for
04:44 - me was I wanted to learn how do three
04:47 - end and the most basic level how do 3d
04:49 - engines work how does it work to create
04:52 - the illusion of three-dimensional
04:54 - perspective on a two-dimensional surface
04:58 - and the answer it deal is has to do with
05:02 - matrices projection matrices rotation
05:05 - matrices and there's much more to it
05:08 - than that but I did the basics and
05:09 - hopefully this will and let me just move
05:15 - to the slack channel here um let me just
05:22 - see move this out of the way
05:25 - I'm alright no no I'm Superboy oh okay
05:30 - hello wake up
05:36 - we go this is really like the free
05:40 - copyright music there aren't a lot of
05:42 - choices you have to pick like the most
05:43 - obvious famous classical music piece I'd
05:46 - love to do something more obscure a
05:47 - little mall or maybe I don't know it
05:48 - would be good for 14 inches I also made
05:53 - it like much louder is it way too loud
05:55 - now oh tesseract is in the chat from the
06:01 - fourth dimension to our dimension okay
06:03 - I'm gonna turn this back down okay so
06:10 - let's do the phone trying to think about
06:12 - this I think we're gonna leave to start
06:15 - with this code like dare start I think I
06:18 - want to start from scratch is the thing
06:19 - I mean I definitely need this matrix oh
06:28 - you know what though this is why I
06:32 - probably shouldn't have I'm gonna have
06:39 - to add some code to this okay yes Simon
06:45 - I have seen that video before thank you
06:47 - for posting it for me I try to not have
06:50 - too many things in the chat here that
06:52 - have a that open up a big thing is I
06:55 - have the font very large so I could see
06:57 - it and so okay so let's see trying to
07:05 - think here trying to think here how do I
07:12 - want to do this alright
07:20 - I want to make a video where somebody
07:24 - could mostly program the tesseract from
07:27 - scratch so I think what I want to do is
07:36 - I'm going to end up redoing some of my
07:39 - code
07:43 - [Music]
07:52 - so I am erasing all this I'm gonna end
07:59 - up rewriting a lot of this code now I
08:03 - feel silly but I think I want to start
08:05 - over from scratch and the tesseract okay
08:13 - you know what I'm gonna leave I'm gonna
08:15 - leave some bits in here let me see what
08:22 - bits can I leave in here okay so I'm
08:29 - going to leave the points for a cube I'm
08:32 - gonna leave this angle variable I'm
08:36 - going to leave the take this out I'm in
08:52 - P 3d now o p 3d
09:06 - and I'll leave this connect function
09:08 - okay I think this should do the trick
09:11 - mmm oh and I need to do scale I'm just
09:33 - thinking here I'll just do scale
09:50 - I forgot the scale affects the stroke
09:53 - wait here it's a little better oh and
10:08 - this has to be okay and then so this is
10:20 - annoying so I'm not gonna do it this way
10:28 - I'm gonna leave this the noise never
10:34 - it's you know it's always so quiet in
10:36 - here when I'm not live-streaming and
10:37 - since I started live-streaming there's
10:39 - always like right out in the hallway
10:41 - just right outside the door there's some
10:43 - construction and push them like
10:45 - furniture that has no wheels down this
10:48 - down the hallway make a loud scratching
10:50 - noise alright so what I'm gonna do is
10:54 - I'm going to say
11:04 - and then I'm just gonna use the scaled
11:06 - oh this is so silly what I'm doing oh
11:16 - this is so silly what I'm doing I have a
11:23 - better idea
11:36 - jammer goes off of course
11:49 - Jamie asks in the chat why is processing
11:52 - chosen for today's video
11:54 - do most people not prefer to follow
11:55 - along at p5 GS or is that just me you
11:58 - know I kind of go back and forth one of
12:00 - the reasons why I'm choosing to use
12:01 - processing right now is because I want
12:03 - to make use of its 3d rendering engine
12:05 - and I'm just much more confident using
12:10 - the 3d rendering engine of processing
12:12 - than the WebGL rendering engine of p5
12:14 - which is to say one is better than the
12:15 - other it's just my own personal comfort
12:17 - level ok so I made all these points
12:21 - we're drawing stroke stroke weight 16
12:25 - points connect them why do I not see my
12:30 - cube where's the cube everybody let's go
12:37 - scale 100 is still in there okay oh that
12:40 - was messing stuff up all right there we
12:42 - go now we can say rotate X by angle or
12:48 - something or rotate Y maybe all right
12:57 - alko writes I can make a fake tesseract
13:00 - without using actual 4d math yeah I was
13:03 - thinking of doing that that's where I
13:05 - that's what I started doing and then I
13:07 - was like jumping through so many hoops
13:08 - and I felt like I wanted to learn and
13:11 - think about the fourth dimension in a
13:13 - way that I hadn't thought about before
13:14 - and so that's why I'm going this route
13:16 - but that is a very good point all right
13:20 - so I think we are going to get started
13:31 - all right I need a marker
13:46 - alright how's everyone feeling this
13:49 - looks like this needs some triage ok ok
14:05 - alright I have to wake up I didn't I I
14:08 - was drinking a non caffeinated beverage
14:10 - this morning and then I just said the
14:15 - heck with that I thing is I don't know
14:23 - if it reads because I'm kind of tired at
14:26 - the end the day it's a Friday but I'm so
14:28 - excited to do this I hope that this
14:30 - becomes a video that is a good one Oh
14:37 - Marshall says I'm so excited get my
14:39 - coding train stickers I did a whole
14:42 - someone helped me with this today but a
14:44 - whole mailing of stickers went out today
14:47 - so if you signed up to be a member
14:49 - before August 1st your stickers are
14:52 - actually in the mail right now to you
14:54 - I'm so be on the lookout for those again
14:58 - I don't keep saying this
14:59 - someone's gonna actually like volunteer
15:02 - in the slack Channel I would love
15:03 - someone to help me spruce up the
15:06 - membership stuff so I want to add a
15:07 - whole bunch of emojis and icons and I'm
15:12 - thinking of maybe some additional
15:13 - rewards if that's of interest but if you
15:16 - would love to volunteer to help with
15:18 - that please let me know
15:21 - you should try Expo wet erase markers
15:28 - yeah that's what I got that's what these
15:32 - are I ordered them someone recommended
15:34 - these to me these are Expo wet erase
15:37 - markers I think right right isn't that
15:41 - what these are I have another one I got
15:42 - a pack of 2 I don't know where the
15:43 - second one went somebody tweeted is that
15:46 - me last week and I ordered them
15:47 - instantly from a company that rhymes
15:52 - with
15:53 - flam is on because I have a full I'm
15:57 - that runs his fly membership oh you know
16:00 - what something else about flam is on I
16:02 - guess I can mention flam is on now
16:04 - because I was working I had like I was
16:09 - kind of sitting somewhere where like I
16:11 - had to wait tonight there's nothing for
16:12 - me to do which very rarely happens and
16:14 - so I actually took a little time to work
16:17 - on amazon.com slash shop slash coding
16:20 - Train I think is the URL I have one of
16:23 - these new coding train slash shop maybe
16:30 - the coding train slash shop alright I
16:34 - know how to get to it if I go to YouTube
16:36 - the coding train and I click on I'm
16:40 - gonna get started coding soon Amazon
16:41 - here yes I don't know amazon.com slash
16:46 - shop slash the coding train I started
16:48 - organizing things into categories here
16:52 - of like stuff that I use and you could I
16:54 - mean this is really just a money-making
16:57 - thing you know hopefully this is like a
17:00 - helpful thing to you cause like you were
17:01 - looking for that book that I referenced
17:02 - it's here but this Amazon is set this
17:05 - kind of stuff up so that I can get a
17:06 - commission which is helpful I'm not
17:09 - gonna turn it down but uh really I
17:11 - recommend you check out this nice list
17:12 - because here's where you can get your
17:14 - own copy of a million random digits or
17:16 - the same exact train whistle that I use
17:18 - this is a unicorn floaty III I could not
17:22 - I actually have one of these and I
17:23 - couldn't stay on it so I know if I
17:24 - recommend it this is a train hat that's
17:26 - really that's what I look for but it has
17:29 - I have some other other stuff in here
17:31 - too and if you have ideas for things
17:33 - that you think I should include or
17:34 - things that I mentioned periodically I
17:36 - would love to include them in here
17:37 - alright that's the Amazon shop alright
17:44 - so now where am I what what happened to
17:46 - all my windows oh wait maybe that's fine
17:52 - okay okay this I don't need the audio
17:55 - library right now I'm not gonna worry
17:57 - about this I'm not gonna worry about
17:59 - this this is what I'm gonna worry about
18:04 - and this is also
18:06 - is there any way I can get this video
18:13 - this page to pop up let's then go here
18:18 - this is what I'll do
18:27 - I want this page to pop up without
18:29 - playing the video and just that the
18:31 - thumbnail but I guess that's not a thing
18:33 - that YouTube does woo wow this is super
18:38 - helpful to the four oh look why all
18:43 - these people make these nice animations
18:45 - and like that's just not me I'm gonna
18:48 - have to draw on the whiteboard okay
18:53 - include the spaceman yeah fill the cube
18:55 - for fun oh hello Denmark random numbers
18:59 - good and Todd good evening everybody
19:01 - alright so I think I'm ready to go to
19:02 - get going
19:04 - nobody can help me with this huh how can
19:07 - I make this show I turned off autoplay
19:12 - speed normal annotations quality how I
19:20 - want to show this page with the
19:23 - thumbnail nobody nobody will tell nobody
19:32 - will help me because it must not be
19:34 - possible I just know I've gotten to I
19:37 - have my expectations are too high I just
19:39 - think I can mention something the chat
19:42 - will tell me how to do it as my own
19:43 - personal technical support I need to be
19:47 - my own technical support I need to learn
19:49 - new things like visualizing a 4d
19:51 - tesseract okay so that's fine I'm just
19:54 - gonna find I'm going to do what I said I
19:56 - was gonna do before which is find a nice
19:58 - there we go a nice screen shot there we
20:03 - go hi be like why is fortnight
20:06 - recommended for you oh I am in one of my
20:10 - alternative universe YouTube accounts
20:14 - that my children use but what I'm trying
20:17 - to do by watching my educational videos
20:19 - in there is is embed embed the
20:23 - recommendation engine with some new
20:24 - stuff for them to watch ya autoplay is
20:29 - auto-playing the next video it's fine
20:34 - it's fine everything's good but let me
20:35 - let me login as myself which I'm always
20:38 - afraid to do
20:41 - but I think this is going to be better
20:45 - it ruined me it really knows that I like
20:47 - Tessa rocks okay
20:48 - so I'm gonna move here this is pretty
20:52 - good come on okay that's good that's
20:59 - good
20:59 - okay yes that's the image correct all
21:12 - right
21:13 - that's a very good me I'm Studios making
21:15 - an interesting solution I think I'm
21:16 - gonna live with this being visible can't
21:20 - resist I can't resist that suggestion
21:23 - hold on let me at least copy video URL
21:26 - to current time I mean I just can't
21:28 - resist this suggestion nope
21:44 - alright this is gonna do just fine
21:47 - tesseract okay and I have my code so
21:53 - this is minimize this is minimized this
21:56 - is up and running then I have my code so
21:58 - far okay
22:04 - too many nines indeed all right we're
22:06 - gonna get started I'm gonna get started
22:08 - let me cycle the cameras
22:30 - okay okay here we go
22:38 - where's the train whistle my lucky train
22:41 - whistle where did it go
22:43 - ah there this Oh welcome to a coding
22:56 - challenge
22:57 - where I will enter
23:00 - the fourth dimension well I don't really
23:08 - time I expected some dramatic moment to
23:10 - happen with the music there which didn't
23:11 - happen but all right so this is a coding
23:13 - challenge I'm so crazily excited about
23:17 - this if this actually works I think that
23:20 - I don't know what's gonna happen stuff
23:22 - just like smoke and brain matter will
23:25 - start just like leaking out of my
23:26 - nostrils I don't even know wait till the
23:29 - end of this video to see now what I'm
23:30 - starting with here looks like a plain
23:33 - old spinning cube and actually that's
23:35 - what it is what I want to do is not just
23:38 - make a plain old spinning cube in three
23:41 - dimensions I want to make a hypercube
23:44 - spinning in the fourth dimension so I
23:55 - want to make something that looks like
23:59 - this alright so this is a hypercube
24:02 - otherwise known as a tesseract and I'm
24:07 - gonna before I start coding any of this
24:09 - I'm gonna explain to you what that is
24:10 - exactly
24:11 - so let me come over here so I I think my
24:16 - favorite dimension is one dimension oh
24:18 - no zero let's pick let's start with zero
24:20 - dimensions a point is a shape that
24:24 - exists in zero D that's a zero now a
24:30 - line which is bound by two points is
24:35 - something that exists in one dimensional
24:37 - space this is one dimensional space a
24:41 - rectangle a square a plane which is
24:45 - bound by one two three four lines exists
24:50 - in two-dimensional space now notice a
24:52 - pattern here this is bound by two lines
24:56 - this is bound by four I'm sorry this is
25:02 - bound by two points this is bound by
25:03 - four lines now if I create two planes
25:09 - and then connect
25:13 - all the edges I have what is commonly
25:15 - referred to as a cube this is something
25:20 - that exists in three dimensions are that
25:22 - the number of dimensions that we live in
25:24 - on this planet where we live and it is
25:28 - bound by six planes so you can see a
25:31 - pattern here I was gonna say you double
25:33 - it but this is not bound by anything I
25:35 - guess so that sort of makes sense this
25:37 - is bound by zero things this is the
25:38 - beginning now what does it mean then to
25:42 - have four dimensions well I'm not really
25:47 - gonna be able to draw this too easily
25:48 - but we could make the case right if I'm
25:52 - following this pattern that four
25:55 - dimensions is bound by eight cubes and
25:59 - this is mathematically true this is
26:02 - accurate the problem is I'm gonna sit
26:06 - here I'm gonna visualize this in my head
26:11 - are you doing this with me I cannot do
26:15 - it at all human beings are not we did
26:17 - not evolve to understand the world in
26:20 - any dimensions higher than three there's
26:25 - a there's a there's any way I can keep
26:27 - going on about this but since this is a
26:30 - mathematical truth why isn't there a way
26:34 - that we could somehow unlock it and see
26:37 - this on a computer screen in some way
26:39 - and in fact there is so this is how how
26:43 - do we even see this how do we even see
26:46 - this 3d shape on a 2d computer screen
26:49 - well the way we do that is by writing
26:53 - code like this one that I've done right
26:55 - here now the truth of the matter is in
26:57 - processing which is the programming
26:58 - language environment I'm using right now
26:59 - I could just say box and I would get
27:01 - that because I'm in the P 3d render and
27:04 - the P 3d render knows how to take the
27:06 - mathematics of a 3d shape and project it
27:09 - into a 2d canvas to create the illusion
27:12 - of the third dimension and it totally
27:14 - makes sense to our brain because we're
27:15 - so used to 3d we can imagine we can see
27:17 - the 2d version of it and imagine it in
27:19 - three dimensions so and I did a a a you
27:25 - don't have to have watch
27:26 - that video to watch this one I did a
27:28 - whole previous coding challenge where I
27:30 - made exactly this but only using the P
27:32 - 2d renderer so I did the math of taking
27:35 - 3d points and projecting them into 2d so
27:38 - if I can do that why can't I take create
27:44 - the math for a 4d shape do the
27:46 - projection into 3d and render it with
27:49 - the P 3d render truth of the matter is I
27:52 - could then project it into 2d and render
27:53 - it with the P 2d renderer too but I'm
27:55 - lazy I'm just gonna do one projection
27:57 - and if this is true there's no reason
28:00 - why I couldn't create a 5d shape and a
28:02 - 60 shape and a 70 shape and I project 17
28:04 - to 16 and divide D into 40 and then into
28:06 - 3d and visualize it so this is what I'm
28:09 - going to attempt to do in this video it
28:11 - is going to require matrices there are
28:16 - ways to do it without it or to create
28:17 - the visual illusion of it but I'm going
28:19 - to be using matrices and the matrices
28:21 - are going to be used for a couple things
28:23 - I need a projection matrix this is a
28:28 - matrix that takes a 4d point and turns
28:32 - it into a 3d point and I'm going to also
28:35 - need a rotation matrix I don't need the
28:39 - rotation matrix but the rotation matrix
28:41 - is what's gonna make this fun because I
28:44 - can start to rotate around weird axes to
28:46 - see crazy things happen so this is good
28:50 - this is kind of like optional but this
28:51 - is what's gonna make the visualization
28:52 - here so I'm gonna do the most basic
28:54 - wireframe version of this and hopefully
28:58 - you are then going to make beautiful
28:59 - interesting weird things about this it's
29:02 - somebody watching this lets who can go
29:04 - to the highest dimension possible in
29:06 - processing I would like to see that as a
29:08 - challenge only one thing I forgot to
29:15 - mention I really should have mentioned
29:16 - it at the top of this video but and I
29:19 - could record a new introduction once I
29:22 - have it finished mm-hmm I guess I could
29:27 - just reference it now is fine
29:30 - [Music]
29:33 - okay okay nothing nobody's complained
29:36 - yet anywhere I'm getting a youtube
29:39 - notification that the ukulele channels
29:41 - that I watch as a new video out oh sorry
29:43 - I'm just gonna go and learn to play the
29:44 - song with ukulele okay if you are
29:48 - getting a ukulele notification right now
29:49 - that means we watch the same ukulele
29:51 - channel alright so I think it's probably
29:57 - fine for me to just reference this video
29:59 - now
29:59 - I meant to reference this at the top but
30:01 - that's fine so let me come back alright
30:05 - now if you want to learn more or CS sort
30:09 - of like condensed version of the
30:10 - explanation of what the tesseract is and
30:13 - how this works I would highly recommend
30:15 - this for me that's I'm making this
30:17 - coding challenge because of this
30:18 - particular video from how do you
30:23 - pronounce that anybody know how you say
30:24 - this what's the chance
30:27 - let me that's the chance that hold on
30:41 - [Music]
30:54 - lay OS o at layoffs OS I supremum Leo's
31:02 - Leos OS yes
31:06 - Leo's OS okay
31:08 - hello a rom well I lost the channel I'm
31:19 - in the wrong place
31:20 - lay Oz OS lay Oz OS lay Oz OS is that
31:26 - correct
31:26 - Alka why am i recording this again
31:31 - don't you have no the time just
31:33 - disappear just do the same thing over
31:35 - and over and over again lay Oz OS
31:44 - alright
31:51 - alka is typing oh I'm just guessing Oh
32:00 - may i
32:01 - oh yes all right
32:07 - Leo's OS all right I just have to guess
32:10 - I actually just messaged him to ask how
32:13 - to pronounce is gentle but I don't think
32:15 - I ever reply yet okay
32:19 - Leo's OS okay Leah Leah
32:23 - Leo's all right all right all right all
32:25 - right all right I've got to move on
32:29 - okay that's Tim Tim that's very funny
32:34 - Tim right there Android OS okay okay
32:40 - okay figure out how to pronounce it I'm
32:42 - gonna guess lay offs OS but there's a
32:44 - wonderful wonderful YouTube channel with
32:46 - many excellent explanatory videos and
32:48 - this one about understanding 40 the
32:50 - tesseract is excellent so you can pause
32:52 - this go watch that come back later
32:54 - all the above okay alright so now I
32:58 - think we're good we're good I minimize
33:00 - the browser and here I am okay all right
33:03 - now ah what do I need the first thing I
33:06 - need to do if I'm going to make
33:08 - something 4d to do something in 3d I
33:11 - make heavy use of this idea of a P
33:13 - vector which is a data structure that
33:16 - holds an X Y and a Z I need something
33:20 - that could hold an X Y to Z and W for
33:23 - that fourth dimension so I'm gonna make
33:25 - a new tab and I'm gonna call it P for
33:27 - vector and I'm gonna say class P P for
33:32 - vector and I'm going to say it has an X
33:35 - Y Z and W and it needs a constructor and
33:40 - it can get an X a Y as E and a W and
33:46 - then I'm gonna say X equal this dot X
33:50 - this is it fun when you have to use the
33:52 - Vista in Java cuz it's like so rare and
33:54 - then every once in a while you do Z W X
33:59 - Y Z W
34:01 - so now this is my P four-vector all
34:04 - right P for vector there we go
34:07 - and now I am going to make this cube
34:11 - this very cube all the points of the
34:14 - cube and actually one thing I want to do
34:15 - just just I'll leave it right now I'm
34:18 - gonna make it in 4000 0 0 the fourth
34:31 - dimension and then while I'm adding the
34:40 - fourth dimension I got to change these P
34:41 - for vector okay then I've got to change
34:47 - this P for vector P for vector P for
34:53 - vector and now okay this stuff I'm going
34:56 - to worry about later
35:01 - and let's see we're gonna watch it's
35:03 - gonna be four dimensions now everybody
35:04 - here comes four dimensions look away oh
35:10 - oh so this is the same exact cube right
35:13 - it's the same is that four dimensions oh
35:17 - I'm so confused huh well how are you
35:21 - gonna see this fourth dimensional first
35:24 - of all I all the points are on zero so
35:27 - what you can think about it is it's flat
35:29 - I took a four dimensional shape and
35:31 - flattened it flattened it you know we
35:34 - say flat cuz usually taking a three
35:35 - dimensional shape and flattening it into
35:37 - 2d so a cube if you flatten it would
35:39 - just be a square so I took this
35:41 - hypercube and flattened it and I just
35:43 - have the cube so I need to make the
35:45 - hypercube okay what I'm gonna do is I'm
35:52 - gonna make mmm all right
35:54 - oh boy oh boy you know what I'm gonna
35:57 - guess my better judgment I'm just gonna
36:01 - extend this array to have 16 points
36:04 - right a hypercube is made up of 16
36:07 - vertices because it's basically two
36:10 - cubes with all the points connected so I
36:13 - am going to I was gonna make like a cube
36:15 - object and hypercube is two cubes but
36:17 - I'm gonna just keep going so I'm gonna
36:19 - say 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and then I'm
36:28 - actually going to put this in 4d so all
36:31 - of these zeros right these should all be
36:33 - 100 these should all be 100 and then I'm
36:41 - gonna put the rest of them at negative 1
36:44 - ER I know I'm doing this highly in a
36:46 - highly manual way but first of all I
36:48 - find it kind of relaxing sometimes just
36:50 - a CEREC copy-paste the same thing over
36:53 - and over again you should try it it's
36:54 - very soothing and then also I can always
36:57 - refactor it later but just to like
36:59 - really know that it's working okay so
37:00 - I've got 16 four-dimensional points
37:04 - I am going to now draw again
37:15 - okay so it just looks like those points
37:20 - what's missing here well I'm not
37:23 - actually doing the projection so now
37:25 - it's time for me like I'm just taking
37:27 - the 4d point ignoring that VW part and
37:33 - then doing a projection so really what I
37:36 - need to do right now is think about how
37:39 - I do the projection so we have this idea
37:42 - of a projection matrix now I'm not going
37:45 - to go too much into detail of this you
37:47 - can watch my previous video where I made
37:49 - the 3d projected into 2d but basically
37:52 - the idea here is that if I have a four
37:57 - dimensional point X Y and I'm drawing
38:01 - that way too high did the camera get
38:06 - lower at some point like I don't know
38:11 - I'll leave the camera there cuz probably
38:12 - did i just mess up the focus just good I
38:20 - have I'm gonna try out what I was saying
38:24 - now I'm gonna create a projection matrix
38:28 - for a 4d point so this is the point x y
38:34 - wz the projection matrix to take a 4d
38:39 - point and turn it into a weight X Y Z W
38:44 - and project it into something that I can
38:47 - draw into 3d X Y Z the idea is like I
38:52 - want to look at the shadow of the 4d
38:54 - object in 3d just like I might look at
38:56 - the shadow of a 3d object in 2d so to do
39:01 - that I need a matrix that has four
39:05 - columns and 3 rows so the typical way to
39:10 - do that would be like this Z 1 0 0 0 0 1
39:15 - 0 0 0 0 1 0 I think I got everything the
39:23 - idea here if I actually use this matrix
39:25 - and perform matrix multiplication which
39:27 - link to two videos where I go through
39:29 - that
39:29 - or detail this actually gives me
39:31 - literally this it's like just chopping
39:34 - off the W so let's actually put this in
39:37 - our code and see what happens so I'm
39:41 - going to create up sudden okay so I'm
39:44 - gonna create a matrix now one thing I
39:46 - didn't mention is I'm working with a
39:48 - help set of helper functions and I work
39:51 - these functions out as a separate video
39:53 - if you're interested but it's not too
39:55 - much to wait too much to be in this
39:56 - video that has actually the matrix
39:59 - multiplication math in it as well as
40:02 - some helper stuff to do matrix
40:04 - multiplication with the matrix and a
40:05 - vector I'm gonna have to change this to
40:07 - P for vector I'm just realizing that but
40:09 - that's no problem okay so what I first
40:11 - want to do is create that projection
40:15 - matrix so I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm
40:18 - just gonna do it right here as a local
40:20 - variable and it'll make it a little bit
40:22 - later will sort of make sense why so I'm
40:24 - gonna say afloat projection equals so I
40:30 - need to make that matrix which is or an
40:32 - array of arrays so there are three rows
40:37 - 0 1 0 0 and then 0 1 0 0 1 0 this is the
40:46 - equivalent of orthographic projection if
40:48 - you've heard that term before okay so
40:51 - now we've done that then what I'm gonna
40:54 - say is P for vector P for actually P
40:59 - vector I don't need it to be a P for
41:01 - vector I'm taking the 3d point P vector
41:05 - projected equals matrix multiplication
41:10 - the projection times V okay so now it's
41:15 - telling me it doesn't know how to do
41:17 - matrix multiplication with a projection
41:19 - matrix and V which is a P for vector
41:23 - which is strange because if I go in here
41:25 - it as a function with a two matrix
41:28 - multiply a two dimensional array and a P
41:31 - vector but I need this to be a vector
41:36 - matrix ah doesn't know how to make a P
41:39 - for vector so I'm just going to change
41:40 - these functions to two
41:42 - to deal with 3d 4d sorry m3 equals B W
41:51 - so again if you want to see where I have
41:53 - a separate video where I wrote all this
41:55 - code and now I'm just adjusting it to
41:57 - add this fourth dimension and then
42:02 - matrix to Veck and us matrix to Veck is
42:05 - going to be yeah you know what I'm gonna
42:09 - always be doing this you know this is
42:13 - fine this stays the same so that stays
42:15 - the same because I still want what I'm
42:18 - gonna get is a 3d vector inside a matrix
42:20 - I don't want to turn into a P vector so
42:22 - let's see so nobody's complaining at me
42:25 - and and now I want to look at the
42:27 - projected points projected projected
42:31 - projected here we go oh what's wrong
42:36 - here vector matrix array index out of
42:42 - bounds exception where I have an error
42:44 - somewhere where is this called here oh
42:53 - this has to be a four this has to be a
42:56 - four so I forget that I'm in Java and I
42:59 - really have to specify types and lengths
43:01 - of things so that has to be a four is
43:03 - there anywhere else where I need to do
43:04 - that we'll find out soon enough
43:06 - okay let's try this one more time we're
43:09 - entering the fourth dimension why there
43:16 - are eight points in four dimensions well
43:18 - guess what if I took a cube and I showed
43:22 - it to you an orthographic projection
43:23 - facing the camera basically it would
43:26 - look like just four points the four
43:28 - points on the back of the cube would be
43:30 - sitting right exactly behind the four
43:32 - points of the front and you wouldn't see
43:33 - that as different same thing is going on
43:35 - here so what I actually need is not
43:38 - orthographic projection I need
43:40 - stereographic projection I need to
43:41 - create that perspective and the way to
43:43 - do that is with moving a sort of
43:48 - thinking of a light source that has a
43:49 - certain distance from the object that
43:52 - I'm casting a shadow so I'm going to
43:53 - create a variable did
43:56 - since and this is going to be you know
43:58 - one thing I really should do is I'm
44:00 - gonna take all these 100's and make them
44:02 - just the number one so I'm going to
44:04 - normalize my shape to just have all ones
44:07 - this looks like a completely insane
44:09 - person wrote this code and in fact a
44:11 - completely insane person did write that
44:13 - code so that way so I'm gonna think of
44:17 - the camera as to give sort of units away
44:21 - and then the projection W is one divided
44:26 - by that distance minus V V dot W this is
44:31 - a sort of tried-and-true formula for
44:33 - creating perspective projection and then
44:37 - I can put that W in here and now let's
44:41 - see what happens oh I'm so close I'm so
44:46 - close so I forgot that all my numbers
44:48 - are 1 so I'm just gonna scale there's so
44:50 - far i two ways i could scale things up
44:52 - but i'm just gonna do it right here
44:53 - so i multiply by 100 and now what kind
45:00 - of looks like sort of looks like that
45:01 - tesseract thing wait a second wait a
45:04 - second wait a second wait a second wait
45:06 - a sec oh this is crazy
45:07 - oh I gotta connect the lines so first of
45:09 - all I need more I guess I should make
45:10 - this smaller let's make this 50 do you
45:15 - see it that's that tesseract looking
45:17 - thing the fourth event so what kind of
45:19 - what is uh so if brains can't do this
45:21 - I'm connecting it will help I'm gonna
45:23 - connect all the lines let's do that so
45:26 - I'm gonna so I had a function that
45:29 - connects all the edges I think I did
45:32 - this in the video where I was just
45:33 - making a cube and these are p4 vectors
45:36 - now or no they're not they're still P
45:40 - vectors and so but I need to connect the
45:43 - oh I need to make all right I really
45:44 - everything's gonna be ok everybody I'm
45:47 - gonna make an array P vector projected
45:52 - projected 3d which is an array is a new
45:57 - P vector also with 16 points in it and
46:02 - I'm just gonna take projected 3d index I
46:07 - there's no index
46:09 - I'm gonna add an index cuz I'm not
46:11 - amusing this enhanced loop I probably
46:13 - should just make it a four loop let's
46:14 - make it a four loop I got time to do
46:16 - that you'll watch me do this for int I
46:19 - equals zero I is less than point length
46:22 - I plus plus and then P for vector V
46:28 - equals points index I so I'm manually
46:32 - iterating through it because now I can
46:33 - have this index and then with this index
46:36 - here I can say I equals that projected V
46:40 - projected and then I can I could still
46:45 - draw these here but now I can say
46:48 - projected 3d so I want to connect the
46:52 - various points there and so now I should
46:55 - see oh that's just one oh right because
46:57 - I got to do this twice oh no I got to do
47:01 - this all the way oh this is confusing I
47:06 - got to use the second half of the array
47:09 - which would be from like 8 to 12 I don't
47:14 - know oh I equals 8 that's not right
47:23 - 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 4 because if I
47:33 - want all the Obagi lists oh modulus 4
47:37 - plus 8 oh I'm really I've made a I made
47:41 - a horror show out of this ok I went out
47:47 - of bounds stop the presses
47:52 - [Music]
47:59 - I have to I have to rethink this before
48:07 - I do the connection stuff is like I
48:15 - should do that from scratch let me take
48:20 - the connection stuff out I think that's
48:25 - gonna be way too confusing
48:27 - mmm and I can go back although let me
48:31 - just go back here so this worked right
48:37 - if I just had to separate I should just
48:39 - make two separate arrays turn anything
48:46 - what's the best way to explain this oh I
48:53 - just had one off okay okay let me stop
48:58 - here let me go from here
48:59 - okay I now realized that I'd not to do
49:03 - this I try to have my videos to be very
49:05 - self-contained and there's a you know
49:07 - there's a few things that you might have
49:08 - to watch a previous video for but it's
49:10 - worth explaining this just for a second
49:14 - so basically what I did in this connect
49:17 - function is this is a connect function
49:19 - to just take two of the points and draw
49:21 - a line between them and to draw a cube
49:24 - right normally I might just say box or
49:26 - begin shape and shape and it's gonna
49:27 - sort of like make all these connections
49:28 - for me but what I'm doing
49:31 - what I'm doing is I basically have
49:35 - points 0 1 2 3 4 5 actually it's 0 1 2 3
49:44 - 4 5 6 7 so that function is basically
49:50 - saying connect 0 and 1 connect 1 and to
49:53 - connect 2 & 3 connects 3 and 0 connect 4
49:57 - & 5 connect 5 & 6 connect 6 & 7 connect
50:00 - 7 & 4 and then connect 0 & 4 1 & 5 2 & 6
50:05 - 3 & 7 that's what that function is doing
50:08 - and so now I have two of them if I have
50:11 - another one
50:12 - basically you know it's it's along the
50:15 - four-dimensional axis I don't even know
50:17 - where to draw that so first of all all
50:21 - of its points start at eight nine ten
50:24 - eleven twelve and this is not one
50:28 - somebody watching this will give me a
50:29 - some nice adjust about a completely
50:31 - refactor this in a better way but you
50:33 - can see now I just need to connect these
50:35 - so well the way that I think I'm gonna
50:36 - approach that is by I'm gonna add
50:40 - another I think if I just add like an
50:45 - offset like I can add an offset this is
50:47 - kind of silly here and then that offset
50:54 - could be 0 and then that offset could be
51:02 - could be 7 right because then I just
51:04 - want to do this and so this would just
51:06 - be I plus offset J plus offset so if I
51:13 - do this twice and again I could do this
51:19 - in one loop right I could add an offset
51:21 - that's 8 is it 8 I think it's eight
51:25 - there we go so now you can see I've
51:28 - connected both cubes so now
51:31 - interestingly enough where what's the
51:33 - fourth dimension with this kind of
51:34 - perspective the fourth dimension is
51:37 - actually like is w W is expressed as
51:41 - kind of a distance between these cubes I
51:43 - mean again we can only think about it I
51:45 - can only describe it to you in three
51:46 - dimensional terms so for example you see
51:50 - this here like if I were to put one of
51:53 - these points like at negative 5 look
51:58 - it's all the way out there
51:59 - so this hypercube isn't perfectly
52:02 - symmetrical one of the points it's W
52:04 - location is all the way out along that
52:06 - axis and I could make that it's a
52:07 - variable and I could slide it around and
52:09 - do stuff like that but I'm not going to
52:10 - do that what I want to do next so one
52:13 - thing is I really want to make all the
52:15 - connections so the nice thing is the lat
52:21 - hook I'm trippin I really want to make
52:30 - all the connections so the nice thing is
52:32 - the last set of connections is pretty
52:33 - easy whoops ah a William Wester says
52:47 - I've never once seen a good tesseract
52:49 - representation everyone gets the
52:51 - occlusion wrong am I getting the
52:52 - occlusion wrong so I'm just doing
52:53 - whatever else does oh boy everybody's
53:00 - giving me suggestions okay
53:02 - okay all right okay all right
53:06 - I really want I threw out what I was I'm
53:09 - gonna try to back up even though that's
53:10 - probably unnecessary all right what I
53:12 - really want to do is I want to I want to
53:15 - see all the connections it's gonna be I
53:16 - want the the edges of one bounding cube
53:20 - need to be connected to the other bound
53:22 - like you've they're not really bound to
53:23 - get oh it's so confusing I want all
53:27 - right
53:27 - I haven't actually finished the
53:29 - connections though because what I want
53:31 - here is I need to connect all these
53:33 - points to those points for the
53:34 - visualization to be fully complete
53:36 - that's actually gonna be pretty easy
53:37 - because all I'm doing it my array of 16
53:40 - points zero connect to eight one connect
53:42 - to nine four connect to twelve five
53:45 - connect to three so that's actually easy
53:46 - that's just a another loop all the way
53:52 - through all the points and I'm gonna
53:55 - have with an offset of zero I connected
54:00 - to I plus eight so this should do that
54:03 - last set of connections whoops no
54:06 - something's wrong here oh no no only I
54:11 - need to go through half the points cuz
54:13 - the first half of connect to the second
54:14 - one all right is this right this looks
54:17 - right to me oh why is it going towards
54:19 - the center something is wrong here okay
54:22 - something is wrong let me think about
54:26 - this I goes to I plus eight and I do
54:29 - them in the same order pretty sure that
54:32 - I did this is the problem
54:35 - you do things manually what's wrong
54:36 - something is wrong here let's take out
54:39 - these connections and these connections
54:42 - maybe that'll help us see it yeah what's
54:47 - wrong here
54:57 - anybody have any idea
55:08 - you connected 0 to 13 to 212 0 to 8 1 to
55:20 - 9 opposite vertices oh oh yeah yeah
55:34 - loop through every vertex and calculate
55:37 - distance to the other vertices and
55:38 - connect the ones with distance of 1 oh
55:40 - that's it oh that's really smart
55:42 - oh that's really smart
55:45 - what an awesome idea I'm connecting the
55:53 - furthest corner so what is it is it like
55:56 - like 16 - I or something plus 1 no no
56:08 - minus 1
56:08 - I mean which will be 15 no whoo that's
56:14 - not right that's closer all right let's
56:21 - just let's figure out so zero
56:28 - let's connect from so 0 to 8 is there oh
56:35 - yeah so that should be 0 to 4 no no not
56:41 - 0 to 4 that's 0 to 12 0 to 6 to 15 is
56:52 - that right no 0 to 11
56:56 - I'm guessing vertices oh my god I'm
56:59 - losing my mind you see your zero
57:01 - connects to that one which is which one
57:05 - is it
57:13 - robear can you see my solutions use the
57:17 - nearest neighbor idea it's really a cool
57:20 - idea 16 minus I minus 2 15 minus I 0 to
57:25 - 13 everyone's giving me excellent
57:27 - suggestions draw index as text on
57:29 - vertices that's such a cool idea
57:31 - all right let's try that text I
58:01 - always get stuck with these little
58:02 - things all right
58:04 - okay hold on let's not draw the points
58:16 - or Elbe
58:19 - let's do rotate you billboard them
58:30 - whoops
58:39 - okis
58:46 - oops that's the rotations in the wrong
58:49 - place sorry
58:51 - there we go okay and let me make the
58:54 - text size and fill 255 I can make it
59:04 - bigger okay
59:34 - all right so this I'm gonna match here
59:36 - this will be a part where I'll come back
59:38 - into the video yeah at some point it'll
59:40 - get cut and I'll come back to here
59:41 - because I think this is a good because I
59:43 - can see it's eight two six nine two
59:45 - seven ten to four fourteen to zero I
59:47 - mean I could just do the distance of one
59:49 - thing which kind of makes sense but yeah
59:59 - zero to fourteen 115 five to eleven yeah
60:03 - it's a weird it's like a weird formula
60:05 - alright okay so I was debugging that for
60:09 - a little while and I was making me crazy
60:10 - and so someone in the chat suggests to
60:12 - just draw the points as numbers so you
60:14 - can see I did this here I actually added
60:16 - a little code to draw the index I um and
60:20 - so now I can look at this and I can see
60:22 - okay zero should be connected to 14 1 to
60:24 - 15 5 to 11 4 to 10 3 to 13 2 to 12 but
60:29 - there's definitely a pattern there but
60:34 - but but but I think actually a nut
60:38 - someone else in the chat I wish I could
60:40 - remember the chat scrolling back so fast
60:42 - the name suggested you you know what you
60:44 - just want to connect every vertices
60:45 - every vertex that has a distance of 1 so
60:49 - actually this is a great idea I can
60:52 - actually eliminate this entire nonsense
60:58 - loop basically and I'm gonna I'm gonna
61:03 - do that let's try that right so what I'm
61:05 - gonna say is for every I'm gonna I'm
61:09 - gonna do it a nested loop for every I
61:11 - equals 0 I is less than points at length
61:15 - I plus plus then I'm gonna start with I
61:18 - plus 1 because I don't need to check a
61:20 - point against itself J is less than
61:23 - point points dot length J plus plus now
61:30 - what I need to do is calculate the
61:33 - distance between those points so I'm
61:36 - going to say float distance equal
61:38 - distance for D between and let's just
61:42 - put those in P for vector a equals
61:48 - P for vector a equals points index I P
61:52 - for vector B equals points index B so I
61:58 - am now going to calculate the distance
62:00 - for D between a and B oh guess what
62:03 - there's no distance for D function I
62:06 - will make one I'm gonna put it here on
62:07 - my helper function page I'm gonna say
62:10 - float distance for D I get a P for
62:14 - vector P for P for vector a this
62:18 - actually would make more sense on the P
62:20 - for vector tab so let's write this here
62:23 - and I could obviously make it a function
62:24 - that's a part of the class but P for
62:27 - vector B and so now what I need to do is
62:31 - I need to do D X equals ax minus B X dy
62:40 - equals a dot y minus B dot y I'm going
62:44 - to do this pretty manually just the
62:46 - difference between all the dimensions
62:48 - that's a W this is just Euclidean
62:51 - distance but in four dimensions then I
62:53 - need to say return the square root of DX
62:59 - times DX plus dy times dy plus DZ times
63:09 - DZ and you know forget the fact that
63:11 - this is kind of inefficient there's
63:13 - probably ways I could optimize this it's
63:15 - gonna work so now if if if T equals one
63:24 - then connect and this function is so
63:29 - silly I don't need the offset anymore
63:32 - shouldn't need that offset then connect
63:35 - I I and J points and these are not
63:41 - points these are not the points at all
63:43 - these are the projected 3d ones oh wait
63:49 - a second no no I want the distance
63:51 - between the points huh and then but I
63:53 - I'm checking the distance between those
63:55 - points but I'm connecting the
63:58 - corresponding ones in the projected 3d
64:01 - array
64:02 - so this is the BP four-vector no no this
64:06 - is p-vector oh it's so confusing points
64:09 - J project dead 3d okay right I'm looking
64:14 - at the piece the 4d values
64:16 - seeing their distance then connecting
64:18 - the corresponding ones let's see Hey
64:23 - look it's all numbers uh hold on a sec
64:29 - everybody I must have made a mistake
64:30 - somewhere so let me let me get rid of
64:33 - all this let me put this back to just
64:37 - the points I want to believe that it's
64:40 - gonna work okay so the points are there
64:44 - I'm not seeing any of the cannot seeing
64:46 - any of the connections yes I can pre
64:48 - calculate the connections in setup that
64:50 - is a very good point let's see what kind
64:54 - of distance values am I getting is it
64:56 - doing some sort of rounding thing where
64:57 - it's not actually equal to one okay so
65:00 - first of all I think I meant to say two
65:03 - distances too because I they're actually
65:06 - like the the distance is two because I'm
65:11 - from the center the each along each axis
65:14 - I'm extruding by one both directions the
65:16 - distance is two not one
65:18 - there we go because I'm drawing them
65:27 - flipped
65:45 - yeah I didn't work who's gonna get this
65:56 - whole swabs are gonna get edited out and
66:00 - I guess I could just manually do the
66:02 - what why I was really thinking it would
66:04 - be so easy to connect our negative and
66:06 - inverted row bears like said there's
66:08 - like 15 times the brothers this chat
66:11 - scrolls by very fast so unless I could
66:13 - capture somebody can capture something
66:15 - and put it into the smaller slack
66:16 - channel because I can't catch it so
66:19 - they're inverted I'm gonna try to scroll
66:24 - back its 32 edges so it should be like
66:34 - the opposite one
66:35 - I should just made it 2 and I need to
66:42 - look at the projection the projection
66:47 - point you're using is making the
66:49 - negative ones get projected to the
66:50 - opposite side of the zero point so could
66:52 - I actually change that in the projection
66:54 - like you know some weird thing like this
66:57 - or something yeah I can scroll that's a
67:07 - good point
67:07 - just go back to the old message using 16
67:10 - minus I minus 2 and 3 perhaps the points
67:15 - are value are correct what they're
67:16 - represented rotated okay I'm gonna try
67:19 - to figure this out myself all right that
67:21 - was a nice digression and was
67:23 - interesting to solve but didn't actually
67:25 - do anything let me just comment this out
67:29 - for right now wait I need my connections
67:32 - back
67:33 - I need my connections back I deleted
67:35 - them I was so confident so hold on let
67:38 - me put this somewhere else just to save
67:41 - this this was a digression that I maybe
67:48 - I'm gonna go back track
67:54 - and I'm gonna go back stop I'm gonna go
67:57 - back to where I just had the numbers
68:03 - let's see how far processing will let me
68:06 - undo
68:23 - not very far huh
68:33 - okay all right I'm back to this
68:40 - so
68:58 - okay let me just allow myself to control
69:00 - this completely I'm gonna write these
69:04 - down isn't the distance between
69:09 - connection from between all zero for two
69:12 - every time somebody will figure this out
69:16 - somebody much smarter than me we'll
69:18 - figure this out I look forward to that
69:19 - day
69:20 - okay let's see I'm going all the way
69:24 - back to where I was just explaining
69:25 - about the text so you can just cut out
69:29 - huge amounts of stuff
69:33 - hi oh it's a weird edit point probably
69:35 - cuz I mean like I just spent and if you
69:38 - want to watch I'll link to the live
69:39 - stream where I just probably spent like
69:40 - a half an hour trying to figure out a
69:42 - pattern here and I'm sure there is one
69:43 - and somebody watching this video will
69:46 - come up with one but what I did to debug
69:48 - this I think I'll make our lives a
69:49 - little easier is first I just decided to
69:51 - write instead of drawing points for all
69:54 - those points I'm just drawing the index
69:56 - value of the array using the text
69:58 - function and translate into that
70:00 - projected location and then I also just
70:03 - made the angle the mouse X so I could
70:05 - control this so I can actually write
70:06 - this down I'm gonna get a piece of paper
70:09 - or I could put it as notes in my code
70:13 - but I feel like a piece of paper would
70:15 - really be just like an exciting moment
70:17 - here on the coding train but I have like
70:21 - a whiteboard or something to write this
70:23 - stuff down
70:23 - okay so now let's look at this nine
70:29 - connects to seven ten connects to four I
70:34 - should really start with one or zero
70:37 - where zero let's let's go and order zero
70:41 - connects to 14 that makes sense one
70:45 - connects to 15 that makes sense
70:48 - where's that 11 no no that's one two
70:51 - connects to 12 the pattern is going to
70:54 - come up I expect three connects to 13
71:00 - for connects to 10 then we could speed
71:06 - this up I guess this part up
71:10 - connects five connects to eleven five
71:14 - goes to 11
71:15 - six connects to eight and seven connects
71:20 - to what's the only one left should be
71:22 - nine right nine okay
71:25 - guess what here's a way to write this
71:27 - code now guess what to do connect zero I
71:34 - still need that offset thing right zero
71:36 - 0 14 projected 3d oh this is lovely
71:41 - oh this is so beautiful this code 0 14
71:47 - 115 212 yes I'm doing this
71:52 - 3/3 I'm not looking at the chat I don't
71:54 - want it I don't want it I don't want to
71:55 - hear it you don't want to hear it
72:02 - 6 8 I'm starting to see the pattern is
72:09 - coming into my head 7 9 and now this
72:19 - looks good this looks good let's put
72:21 - those points back in let's take out this
72:24 - text I'm gonna leave that in there just
72:25 - like comment it in the code and let's
72:27 - put this back in I'm gonna just let it
72:32 - rotate automatically now and we are
72:36 - entering
72:38 - the fourth dimension
72:45 - okay we're finally ready for something
72:48 - exciting sort of alright so what's
72:51 - what's the deal here no look at this how
72:53 - am i rotating that how the shape is
72:56 - spinning in 3d I want to do 4d rotations
73:00 - 4d rotations so this is now the moment
73:04 - we're going to start to get something
73:05 - pretty interesting visually going on
73:06 - where I now want to create not a
73:12 - projection matrix but a rotation matrix
73:16 - so here's the thing in 2d a 2d I I want
73:21 - to draw up here but I don't think you
73:22 - can see it I'm gonna draw it here if we
73:24 - go and and I'm gonna go to a Wikipedia
73:29 - page rotation matrix we're gonna see
73:34 - that a rotation matrix looks something
73:36 - like this and I'm gonna write this down
73:38 - duplicate this over here because we're
73:40 - gonna want to memorize this it's cosine
73:42 - of the angle a negative sine of the
73:46 - angle and then I already forgot it's
73:48 - sine of the angle cosine in a way of
73:49 - course and if we were to take this
73:54 - rotation matrix and multiply it by an XY
73:59 - point this is basically doing regular
74:01 - plane rotation in two-dimensional space
74:04 - based on an angle and that's what
74:06 - happens when you've just in P 2d you
74:08 - just call rotate it's applying a
74:10 - rotation matrix like this so if I scroll
74:13 - down further onto this page we can start
74:18 - to see oh look at this
74:20 - wrote I mean it's going on look at this
74:22 - these are like 3d rotations around the
74:25 - x-axis we put a 1 in the first spot and
74:29 - then we have that sort of like four
74:30 - rotation values in the bottom right
74:32 - because it is rotating around the x axis
74:36 - using the y and z axes this is rotating
74:40 - around the y axis using the using the x
74:42 - and z so this is the idea that I need to
74:44 - extrapolate to four dimensions so now if
74:47 - I want to rotate in four dimensions I
74:50 - would just put cosine theta negative
74:54 - sine theta zero zero sine
75:00 - theta cosine theta 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1
75:08 - this is the idea this is now a rotation
75:13 - matrix that will rotate you can see well
75:17 - rotate around the X using the XY axes x
75:22 - and y no Z no W so this should look sort
75:28 - of familiar to us if we apply this in
75:30 - the code so let's go to the code and I'm
75:33 - going to this is this is the important
75:35 - part right this is where I'm doing the
75:37 - projection now I want to rotate before I
75:39 - project so I'm going to create a p4
75:43 - vector oh boy
75:45 - we're gonna need some more vector math
75:46 - stuff rotated equals matrix
75:52 - multiplication a rotation matrix times V
75:55 - and my rotation matrix I'm gonna copy
75:59 - paste this and I'm gonna make a rotation
76:02 - matrix it's going to have a cosine of
76:05 - the angle negative sine of the angle
76:10 - sine of the angle cosine of the angle a
76:17 - 1 and then a 1 this is I'm sticking with
76:22 - 4 dimensions here right so this should
76:25 - give me a 4d point out of it I'm just
76:29 - rotating that 4d point according to the
76:31 - XY axis all right the problem is my nice
76:34 - beautiful mat mol function doesn't know
76:41 - how to we stop for a second I can't
76:48 - overload this
76:55 - I want this to be matrix to Veck for the
77:06 - rejection is missing the brackets and it
77:08 - makes me sad the 4th rotation is wrong
77:11 - okay all right hold on I'm to work out
77:14 - the matrix multiplication but
77:15 - everybody's blaring at me that I have
77:17 - mistakes in my code separate from that
77:19 - so let's fix those this is wrong thank
77:22 - you this needs to be a zero and then in
77:25 - the projection something is wrong in the
77:27 - projection your projection is missing
77:30 - the brackets and it made me sad where
77:32 - where
77:43 - yeah
77:50 - zero zero zero zero zero zero one all
77:53 - right I fixed that zero zero one thing
77:54 - you guys are so far behind me in time me
78:06 - I am so Mia's typing W equals 1 divided
78:11 - by distance - oh that's been wrong all
78:14 - along parentheses we call those
78:20 - parentheses for 45 point I just fixed
78:32 - this mistake and then I was like sitting
78:35 - here and I think this is like a major
78:37 - error I don't know how it happened to
78:39 - work that those parentheses need to be
78:43 - there this formula has been wrong for a
78:45 - very long time in this video it's fixed
78:50 - now let me for a second then just get
78:54 - rid of the rotation and just make sure
78:56 - everything still looks kind of normal
78:57 - ish okay that's what was messing up
79:05 - those connections could that really be
79:21 - true I'll have to go way back in time is
79:33 - interesting that digression though to
79:35 - like debug it in that way
79:37 - it was useful don't mind me I'm just
79:44 - over here checking something
79:54 - just ignore me just over here checking
79:57 - something
80:08 - [Laughter]
80:13 - if I could turn back okay okay this is a
80:22 - good thing because the actual finished
80:25 - version of this video there was a point
80:35 - so here's the thing in fear I'm gonna
80:39 - you know I'm gonna just go back I'm
80:43 - gonna take this out is we're nice
80:45 - interesting digressions I hate to lose
80:47 - them but I'm losing them I'm gonna put
80:50 - this mistake back in so this is actually
80:55 - this is the point I need to go back to
80:57 - oh do the to distance thing so now I
81:01 - could do the to distance thing this is
81:07 - actually the point I can go back to
81:08 - don't go back I'm not going back really
81:11 - I'm just gonna excise all that out of
81:14 - the final edited version of this coding
81:16 - challenge which would be sad I guess and
81:22 - I could do the nearest neighbors yes I
81:25 - know I could do the nearest neighbor
81:26 - stuff I will mention that oh oh boy all
81:32 - right oh hell oh no not I can do the Olo
81:41 - thing that's too much of a cliche
81:45 - we're gonna do this this will work well
81:51 - okay so that was like a very abrupt edit
81:54 - I will link to the live stream where I
81:57 - am currently right now live doing this
82:00 - coding challenge you just I've just
82:02 - probably edited out about 45 minutes of
82:04 - doing all sorts of crazy debugging I was
82:06 - doing some stuff I was putting numbers
82:08 - where they were trying to figure out the
82:09 - connections and there was actually just
82:12 - a bug which you may have already noticed
82:14 - and been typing in the comments or
82:16 - shouting at me or maybe just singing it
82:17 - to me in a lovely friendly way this was
82:20 - a mistake this here this formula for
82:23 - doing the aah this here this formula for
82:35 - doing the perspective projection needs
82:39 - to have parentheses here because I'm
82:41 - saying 1 divided by the distance from
82:43 - the camera minus the actual W point not
82:46 - 1 divided by distance - the W point
82:48 - that's the actual formula you can go
82:51 - watch that any other material about the
82:54 - that you'll find that formula ok so now
82:56 - if I do that now this looks like I
83:01 - expected it to look like and in fact up
83:03 - during that time I also tried a
83:05 - different solution which I would
83:06 - recommend doing as an exercise to
83:07 - yourself one thing that was pointed out
83:10 - by the chat whoops let me just oh nice I
83:18 - was afk for 45 minutes you know what
83:20 - since the camera went off and I all
83:22 - tabbed into this page that I didn't mean
83:24 - to alt tab into one more one once more
83:27 - with feeling once more with feeling
83:45 - okay so abrupt edit you're watching if
83:49 - you're watching this not watching this
83:50 - live you're watching a recorded version
83:51 - just spent about 45 minutes trying to
83:54 - debug a problem when I went off
83:55 - completely in the wrong direction well
83:57 - it was a really interesting that's
83:59 - interesting tangents like courage I'll
84:01 - link to the time code of the livestream
84:03 - where you either watch that whole part
84:04 - but I was trying to figure out why these
84:07 - points aren't connecting properly and I
84:09 - started doing things like drawing
84:10 - numbers where all the points were and
84:12 - also stuff but actually the mistake
84:14 - which you may have already seen and been
84:16 - singing to me about it perhaps um is
84:19 - right here there needs to be parentheses
84:20 - here the formula for the perspective
84:22 - projection requires one minus one
84:25 - divided by the distance minus the actual
84:27 - W point as soon as I put that in now all
84:30 - of the points are in the right place and
84:32 - those connections are doing what they
84:35 - should do I though the actual drawn
84:38 - points are a little bit too large for my
84:40 - taste right now I'm gonna take this to
84:42 - eight and this looks better now okay so
84:46 - there we can see there's our hypercube
84:48 - in 3d sort of okay gonna take a deep
84:53 - breath here cuz there's a lot of stuff
84:54 - and I got to figure out where I am
84:56 - Oh oh yes rotation okay pause for a
85:02 - second nurse somebody actually sponsored
85:05 - this Thank You Alec bear off so here's
85:10 - the thing oh yeah so okay before I get
85:15 - to rotation actually let me just mention
85:16 - one more thing about this it was pointed
85:18 - out in the chat by many people that
85:20 - instead of like trying to write some
85:22 - kind of kooky nonsensical crazy person
85:25 - algorithm like I did here to figure out
85:27 - where all the connections are that you
85:28 - could actually just test for unit
85:30 - distance between the points right
85:31 - because you think about a square right
85:33 - you don't connect the diagonals because
85:35 - they're not distance they'd have a
85:36 - different distance so if I look at the
85:38 - distance between all the points I'll
85:40 - find all the connections there so that's
85:41 - an interesting side project for any of
85:43 - you as an exercise to do while you're
85:44 - watching this but I want to talk about
85:46 - rotation now while I was debugging I
85:51 - can't talk about it again so there's
85:54 - some stuff
85:55 - the white porcupine ever go race it
85:57 - pause oh this cameras off so I think I
86:08 - have to do the rotation explanation
86:10 - again because I don't see any other way
86:12 - of approaching it there's now that I
86:20 - have it fixed I mean we could edit out
86:23 - of order time sequence wise but this is
86:27 - gonna be a big project good thing I'm
86:28 - going away by the way I'm going away for
86:29 - like three weeks but still have a lot of
86:32 - time to edit this I also could just
86:35 - start over and do it again but I think
86:36 - this this coding challenge so what was
86:39 - in here before it was just the it was
86:42 - just the yeah it was the projection
86:46 - matrix okay great okay okay here we are
86:56 - alright so how is this even rotating in
87:04 - the first place how is it rotating in
87:08 - the first place tonight so I like that
87:10 - thing where I move to point out yeah it
87:14 - made sense okay I think that's in there
87:16 - sorry - all right okay so how is this
87:20 - rotation even happening in the first
87:21 - place I'm rotating in the third
87:23 - dimension which is not really what I
87:24 - want to do I want to rotate in the
87:26 - fourth dimension then project that down
87:28 - to the third dimension so let's let's
87:30 - try to back up let's try to create
87:31 - exactly this by rotating in the fourth
87:34 - dimension and then projecting back down
87:36 - to the third dimension the reason why
87:37 - I'm not actually doing the rotation in
87:39 - the fourth dimension is because the
87:40 - rotation is happening right here with
87:42 - the built-in native rotate Y function
87:45 - that means rotating around the y axis so
87:47 - how does rotation actually happen well
87:49 - rotation happens with a rotation matrix
87:54 - so here I am on the wikipedia page and
87:56 - you can see this rotation matrix right
87:58 - here
87:58 - so let's come back over here and let's
88:01 - think about that so this is a rotation
88:03 - matrix cosine of theta negative sine of
88:07 - the
88:08 - sine of theta cosine of theta did I get
88:11 - that right looks like I did alright so
88:14 - this is a 2d rotation matrix if I were
88:17 - to take this rotation matrix and do
88:20 - matrix multiplication with any given 2d
88:23 - point this is exactly the math behind
88:27 - rotate in processing bike data this is
88:31 - exactly that so then what is the math
88:34 - behind rotate Y or rotate X or rotate Z
88:40 - and in fact it is indeed also a rotation
88:43 - matrix only it's 3x3 rotation matrix and
88:46 - in fact if I come over here on this
88:49 - Wikipedia page about rotation matrices
88:51 - and keep scrolling keep scrolling and
88:53 - keep scrolling and scrolling there we go
88:55 - here it is this is the rotation matrix
88:57 - for around the y axis and you can see a
89:00 - pattern here right that's that 2d
89:02 - rotation but it's here within the y&z
89:05 - which is rotating on the x axis same
89:07 - pattern but between the X and the Z
89:09 - between the X and the y that's how I get
89:11 - all those different rotations but I want
89:14 - to do this in four dimensions so what I
89:16 - need to do rotation in four dimensions
89:20 - is the following I need to pick which
89:24 - axes I want and I need a four by four
89:26 - matrix and in this case the axes that I
89:31 - want I'm going to use the x and y axes
89:33 - and I'm gonna say cosine theta negative
89:38 - sine theta sine theta cosine theta so
89:43 - this is o and this has to be a 1
89:44 - apologies and this has to be a 1 right
89:47 - because it's the identity matrix for y&z
89:50 - basically the identity being heard just
89:53 - a 1 in those in those areas so I don't
89:57 - know if that's actually the right way to
89:57 - phrase it
89:58 - back away so this is the rotation matrix
90:00 - I'm going to call this 4 4 D this is
90:03 - rotation X Y so let's and actually what
90:06 - I was doing rotate Y would be XZ but
90:09 - anyway let's come back and now try to
90:10 - add that in so what I'm going to do now
90:13 - go back to my code I'm gonna comment out
90:17 - the rotate Y and instead oh look it's
90:20 - already in there
90:21 - take that out so I forgot I did this
90:24 - earlier hold on I'm gonna go back to my
90:31 - code and I'm gonna comment out this
90:34 - rotate Y so now there is no rotation for
90:37 - free from processing I'm just seeing the
90:40 - hypercube the 4d hypercube projected
90:42 - into 3d I am going to create whoops this
90:46 - just shouldn't be here what I was
90:49 - feeling okay come back to the computer
91:04 - I'm going to comment out rotate Y so now
91:09 - there's no rotation and actually I'm
91:11 - going to start with just to be clear I'm
91:14 - gonna start with rotate X no rotate Z I
91:16 - think that'll be the simplest so I'm
91:18 - gonna start with rotate Z so I'm gonna
91:20 - recreate exactly this this doesn't look
91:22 - super interesting because of how flat it
91:24 - is but I'm that's what I'm gonna start
91:25 - with so let me because I think that'll
91:27 - be the easiest one to do I want to
91:28 - recreate that with a matrix so the first
91:31 - thing I have to do is before I do the
91:33 - projection I have to create a rotation
91:37 - matrix and I'm going to call this XY
91:38 - rotation and that is going to equal a
91:42 - matrix that has I forgot already cosine
91:45 - of the angle negative sine of the angle
91:48 - 0 0 sine of the angle cosine of the
91:54 - angle 0 0 and then 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 so
92:04 - this is my rotation X Y matrix
92:10 - autoformat there we go
92:12 - rotation X Y matrix now I want to say
92:18 - you know what I can do here actually
92:25 - so I'm thinking I'm thinking
92:42 - Oh layoffs OS Thank You Laelius OS is in
92:47 - the chat eyes right mispronounced earn
92:49 - the name of your channel earlier
92:51 - apologies for that
92:52 - then we could dub that in or if I end up
92:55 - doing another intro to this ok ok so now
93:00 - what I need to do is I need to say P for
93:05 - vector right I want to get a rotated
93:08 - point which is the rotation which is the
93:11 - matrix multiplication result of the
93:13 - rotation matrix XY with V that point V
93:18 - now this is telling me it doesn't know
93:20 - how to do this so I have member I have
93:22 - all those helper functions the helper
93:24 - functions do these matrix multiplication
93:26 - operations well I do have a helper
93:28 - function that does alright does look at
93:34 - this it does I was like oh look it does
93:36 - this a matrix times a p4 vector I have
93:38 - that but look at it it returns a P
93:41 - vector because I have the one to give me
93:43 - a 3 3 P vector back I should probably
93:46 - just leave everything as p4 vectors
93:48 - would make our life so much easier
93:49 - there's not really any reason for me to
93:50 - use P vector at this point because I can
93:52 - always but I'm gonna ii-i've done what
93:55 - I've done I mean we can think about
93:57 - refactoring it later which is like a
93:59 - little bit of my mantra and I'm going to
94:01 - say this still works so I want to say if
94:08 - so this is matrix Tyvek I need another
94:12 - one of these which does I'm just gonna
94:17 - write this function I don't think I need
94:19 - this anymore because it's always gonna
94:20 - have three dimensions that was sort of
94:22 - an extra thing just to simplify this I'm
94:24 - gonna make another function that's going
94:27 - to be called matrix to Veck 4 and I make
94:30 - a pee 4 vector and then I'm gonna say V
94:32 - dot W is this so I made a different
94:35 - function and this returns a p4 vector P
94:38 - 4 vector so I just made a helper
94:40 - function that takes 8 oh I don't have
94:43 - that up 0 0 0 0 that basically takes a
94:49 - takes a matrix that has one column right
94:55 - this
94:55 - is what it is it's a matrix with one
94:58 - column in four rows and turns this into
95:00 - a p4 vector I need that
95:03 - because down here I now want to say I'm
95:10 - gonna say result equals mat mole a and M
95:17 - and then I'm going to say if result dot
95:21 - length so how many rows do I have four
95:24 - rows are not equals four
95:27 - then return oh no wait I can't return
95:32 - two different types I just have to do
95:34 - this
95:34 - ah Java is a weird place right I can't
95:39 - return something of a different type so
95:43 - I'm gonna just pass a boolean in I'm
95:46 - gonna pass I'm gonna pass our dimensions
95:49 - like int dim so I don't even need to
95:52 - figure it out
95:53 - if dimensions equal 4 oh no it's the
95:57 - same problem oh oh I can oh no I could
96:01 - just overload it all right I'm gonna
96:03 - overload sorry everybody
96:04 - so this is sorry for this digressions
96:09 - making this video extra long this is
96:13 - what it was before right returning a a
96:18 - matrix to Veck oh no return sorry sorry
96:26 - everybody this there this is what it was
96:29 - before now what I'm gonna do is I'm
96:32 - going to just this is very awkward but
96:34 - I'm gonna add I'm gonna say a boolean or
96:39 - forth this is sort of silly and now I'm
96:43 - just gonna say matrix Tyvek 4 and it
96:46 - returns a P 4 vector ok so I made two
96:48 - versions of this function this is very
96:51 - silly I should just made it but but it
96:54 - is what it is ok can we get back to what
96:56 - we were doing which was important so now
96:59 - I'm gonna say Matt mole rotation X Y
97:01 - true so this should return a 4d vector
97:05 - then
97:06 - now I want to get the W of the rotated
97:14 - vector right because I'm about to
97:15 - calculate the projection matrix I don't
97:18 - want to use the original point I want to
97:20 - use the point that's been calculated
97:21 - after the rotation and now we should see
97:26 - no wait
97:29 - sine of angle angle hmm P for vector
97:38 - what did I do wrong
97:44 - aha I projected V again so this down
97:50 - here needs to be rotated also there we
97:54 - go I have now created exactly zero
98:01 - tation with my own rotation matrix oh
98:03 - we're getting really close everybody
98:04 - this is very exciting
98:06 - so now now I have a rotation XY just to
98:10 - prove a point
98:11 - let's do rotation what was the one we
98:14 - saw with it's spinning like this let's
98:16 - do rotation X Z meaning a zero goes here
98:23 - meaning a one goes here the zero goes
98:31 - here this is how I like now let's look
98:36 - at this is this right I think this is
98:38 - rotation with X and Z 1 in the Y and 1
98:42 - in the W so let's now change that to XZ
98:46 - here and look there we go I have it just
98:51 - rotating around what looks like the y
98:53 - axis okay what if I want to apply more
98:58 - than one rotation
99:01 - so here I've rotated by XZ now I can
99:06 - just rotate again by rotating by X Y
99:12 - what's wrong here multiply rotation X Y
99:15 - by rotated true oh so I don't want to
99:18 - read eclair the variable
99:21 - and here we go now we see both rotation
99:24 - okay but everything still feels very
99:26 - much like all I did was make two 3d
99:29 - cubes and connect the corners so that's
99:31 - what you're seeing right because that's
99:33 - the shadow of what the four dimensional
99:38 - shape in our only way our brains can
99:40 - process 3d but let's really try to
99:43 - stretch our brains for a second what if
99:46 - I include this is really where things
99:47 - are gonna go nuts what if I include the
99:51 - W axis what does it mean to rotate
99:54 - around the W axis think about that for a
99:55 - second okay rotate around the Y rotate
99:59 - around the X right eight around the z
100:01 - move can't even that W axis that was
100:06 - kind of like extruder who knows what
100:09 - that's even gonna be let's see what that
100:10 - looks like we are now really about to
100:12 - enter the fourth dimension
100:13 - okay let's try what do I want XW I don't
100:19 - know what's a good one to start with
100:20 - let's try X W so I'm gonna make a
100:24 - rotation matrix X W okay here we go
100:27 - so X then a zero goes here then that
100:32 - stays the same then this should be in
100:35 - the bottom and a zero goes here get rid
100:38 - of this comma get rid of this zero and
100:41 - then the one goes here so let's actually
100:45 - just for I'm afraid to add too many
100:49 - rotations so X Z let's do X W and then
100:56 - let's comment these out so I am only
101:01 - using rotation around the X W access
101:21 - this isn't right something is wrong
101:29 - there did something interesting though
101:33 - all right what's it that oh you know
101:36 - what most people do I think actually is
101:38 - uh not ZW so let's do the W let's put
101:44 - this here and then these go away I mean
101:50 - I just want to see that I'm doing this
101:53 - correctly and then this would be 1 0 0 1
101:58 - so let's try ZW let's see what this does
102:06 - okay this is actually correct now it
102:09 - looks really weird but I think I think
102:13 - I'm gonna be able to fix this I'm just
102:16 - gonna do something really quickly just
102:17 - as a test I just wanna like rotate it on
102:20 - its side mmm I'm gonna be this side no
102:31 - something is still wrong I've done
102:35 - something wrong all right I'm looking at
102:38 - the chat why do I be rotated a bit
102:44 - around yeah I've done something wrong
102:50 - cosine negative sine sine cosine
102:55 - rotation ZW you know I just this really
103:01 - shouldn't matter but I just want to
103:05 - check something real quick oh boy
103:10 - I just changed every number 1 - that was
103:14 - a bad idea don't do that
103:24 - hold on I just broke too many things cuz
103:28 - if I'm worried about that I could just
103:31 - make this this
103:37 - what have I done wrong projection
103:48 - yes so let me let me do what what is
103:51 - typically seen would be this now it's
104:00 - not right though it's interesting unless
104:06 - I actually and don't like to take this
104:11 - off now something is off let me look at
104:18 - this other example I made the other day
104:42 - I'm not sure about my virtus I'm not
104:45 - sure about anything who asking are you
104:47 - sure about rotate X negative PI over 2
104:49 - oh I just was looking at it from the
104:57 - wrong direction weird
105:16 - Thank You mr. Wiggles XZ is wrong so now
105:28 - I've got it order matters Oh
105:31 - order matters I mean I should just do
105:37 - this in one rotation matrix
105:55 - yeah same thing interesting
106:15 - 964 you still have a V well it's working
106:17 - now I just don't understand oh no no
106:24 - that's right
106:25 - so the first rotation the first rotation
106:28 - is off of V and then I just continue to
106:31 - rotate
106:48 - yeah so it's actually it's just I'm
106:50 - looking at it wasn't this wasn't what I
106:52 - saw when I originally did it though was
106:53 - it when I originally did it seamless no
107:04 - oh I have lost track of where I was I
107:13 - mean don't get me wrong I was just gonna
107:15 - do all the rotations XY XZ ZW we could
107:20 - just keep going with craziness well now
107:25 - I'm gonna wait til the sound dies down
107:27 - color the points and lines that would be
107:29 - nice
107:32 - no I'm just just noise in the hallway
107:34 - what time is it it's only 6 o'clock I'm
107:41 - just trying to think of where I should
107:42 - go back to mmm because there was the
107:47 - point where I would I want to go back to
107:50 - is when I thought I did the fourth
107:52 - dimension the first time oh maybe that
107:55 - was just this
108:05 - weird
108:09 - yeah I'm definitely want to make the
108:11 - rotation interactive and everything I'm
108:13 - just trying to think I don't know where
108:15 - I I don't remember where I where I was
108:24 - cuz I could go back on you look good
108:26 - someone go back like ten minutes in the
108:28 - wolf livestream I was trying to do XY
108:34 - and Z W right when I did XY and z w
108:47 - wasn't that where I said I'm entering
108:50 - the fourth dimension and then that I
108:53 - tried then did I try to and it was that
108:56 - but then did I do this we're trying to
109:05 - find though the place where it like
109:07 - looked oh yeah yeah this is where I was
109:09 - okay yeah I just went to the wrong side
109:11 - got it alright okay it's just a viewing
109:16 - angle yeah okay okay so guess what this
109:23 - is actually correct I just had the wrong
109:25 - viewing angle so like basically what
109:29 - we're doing right now if I if I just do
109:31 - the two rotations the at sorry there's
109:39 - something over here that noise is so
109:41 - distracting give me a second people
109:48 - so
110:07 - okay
110:13 - yeah but sir I'm just waiting for the
110:17 - sound to die down which might be a lost
110:20 - cause let me take a look outside
110:23 - [Applause]
110:30 - okay that's a while Scott let's do B
110:34 - they'll be sound in the video that's the
110:35 - problem
110:37 - okay why this was a hard problem now I
110:42 - understand why people who make youtube
110:44 - videos they like script things and
110:47 - practice they dig like a whole week to
110:49 - make something someday
111:04 - okay so I'm back again I was trying to
111:10 - figure out why this is wrong and then I
111:12 - realized oh this is actually right it's
111:14 - I just I'm used to seeing a certain
111:17 - pattern and I've just got the viewing
111:19 - angle slightly wrong or slightly
111:21 - different so basically let me comment
111:23 - this line rotate Y out the two rotations
111:26 - that I'm doing right now are X Y Z W and
111:30 - if we do that without just natively the
111:33 - way that I drew the cube you sort of see
111:35 - the Z rotation and that W rotation that
111:38 - in in the projection of the 3d world is
111:40 - like kind of coming in and out almost
111:42 - looks like breathing and so what I
111:44 - actually want to do is just rotate it on
111:46 - the x axis to put things on the side and
111:48 - I could do that with a rotation matrix
111:49 - because I have a full 3d renderer
111:52 - I'm going to say rotate X negative pi
111:55 - divided by 2 and there we go now this
111:58 - should look like
111:59 - the tesseract visualization that you're
112:02 - used to seeing this is that W rotation
112:06 - like rotating and by the way we have now
112:11 - entered
112:16 - you know there's a little bit
112:17 - anticlimactic I guess but here we're
112:19 - done this coding challenge is complete
112:21 - and I just want to stop I'm not gonna do
112:25 - any more because I'm gonna leave this
112:27 - for you let's think about let's think
112:38 - about all the kinds of things you could
112:40 - do to this to make this more beautiful
112:42 - or interesting or weird first of all you
112:46 - know what are all sorts of other
112:47 - rotation matrices you can apply like
112:50 - what's like a three axis rotation you
112:52 - could certainly do that right
112:55 - what multi how many this is a double
112:58 - rotation cuz you do a triple or
112:59 - quadruple what if you try a bunch of
113:01 - different other axes with the W axis you
113:04 - know I'm just drawing these little
113:07 - points and connecting them with lines
113:09 - there are probably so many other ways
113:12 - you could think to visualize the pattern
113:14 - of the tesseract you can now enter the
113:17 - fourth dimension projected into the
113:19 - third dimension and see a result I will
113:22 - try to make a JavaScript version of this
113:24 - with the p5.js library has a WebGL
113:25 - renderer so that will be released also
113:28 - with this uncoding challenge and there
113:31 - was something else that I just thought
113:33 - of a second ago Oh
113:47 - I will try to make a JavaScript version
113:51 - I will make up jobs I will also make a
113:53 - JavaScript version of this using the p5
113:55 - just library which has a WebGL renderer
113:57 - although in theory I don't even need a
113:58 - 3d renderer
113:59 - because I could project the 4d points to
114:02 - 3d and then project the 3d points to do
114:04 - t 2d if you really want a hard problem
114:06 - try doing that ah but really I ask you
114:09 - how many how what dimension can you can
114:12 - you project down into three dimensions
114:14 - and visualize can you get up to five -
114:16 - six - seven what happens so I encourage
114:19 - you I challenge you to try all sorts of
114:21 - weird stuff to make some beautiful art
114:22 - and enjoy spending time in the fourth
114:30 - dimension
114:50 - okay that music better not get me a
114:57 - copyright violation it says from a
115:00 - YouTube website that that's music you
115:02 - can use let's go double check let's find
115:07 - it otherwise I'm gonna redo this coding
115:11 - challenge again which actually would be
115:12 - fun to do now that I know all the
115:14 - mistakes that I made not you might tell
115:17 - me he I have to redo it which I would
115:18 - totally understand no not here not here
115:20 - not here not here where where did I did
115:26 - I closed that out oh no wait where is it
115:29 - no it's on the history audio library
115:37 - free music what did I do
115:43 - genre cinematic mood dark it's this one
115:50 - you're free to use this song and
115:53 - monetize your video
116:02 - all right oh you heard it here okay well
116:10 - I said I was gonna make a tesseract
116:13 - I made a test right now the question is
116:15 - let's just I need some I need a
116:23 - thumbnail let's make sure we have a good
116:24 - thumbnail I'm sure there was something
116:26 - in there but I just want to make it a
116:28 - little bigger
116:31 - let's do full screen P 3d and then I'm
116:38 - going to when I scale it up just do with
116:43 - / - let's see what happens when you do
116:45 - that whoo what did I do
116:52 - oh no it's not sorry false the function
116:56 - is fullscreen
117:04 - okay that's not good let's try with /
117:08 - for
117:15 - that's close to what I was sort of
117:18 - hoping to see with divided by eight okay
117:25 - that looks good
117:27 - now what do I want too let's slow the
117:31 - angle down a little bit let's make the
117:33 - stroke wait for and the stroke wait like
117:38 - 16 let's try this okay there we go and
117:43 - maybe we should make this is it is it
117:46 - actually better without the points I
117:49 - just don't see what it looks like
117:52 - like I don't need to draw the points
117:54 - necessarily right yeah what do you think
117:58 - visually do you like it with the points
118:01 - there without the points misterwiggles
118:08 - what did I miss
118:12 - [Music]
118:24 - different color lines
118:29 - [Music]
118:45 - see I'm just curious what's this do here
118:47 - for a second that's kind of interesting
118:50 - [Music]
118:52 - all right III can't get I'm gonna let
118:54 - you be creative with color
119:08 - Oh strokeweight with distance to the
119:11 - camera meaning distance to the W okay I
119:18 - think I liked it better actually thin
119:19 - with some points
119:29 - this should be done here
119:37 - that's ugly what if I give these like
119:42 - some alpha does that what happens well
119:45 - it's kind of interesting
120:13 - okay uh all right so whatever that's
120:16 - fine visually I kind of want to add like
120:23 - another rotation I'm just curious
120:26 - just curious okay let me just add one
120:29 - more rotation like so if this is X y and
120:34 - this is Z W why don't I try Y W
121:07 - oh yeah there we go that's crazy just
121:23 - take out the
121:30 - if I just take out the CW now
121:40 - interesting so many possibilities all
121:44 - right all right all right all right
121:46 - right nothing's happening now I got
121:47 - tired and I started like distracting
121:49 - myself with but I'm gonna I'm gonna
121:51 - again the world is a much more creative
121:54 - place than me
121:55 - go back to here and I'm gonna do a
121:57 - little intro so how how long would you
122:01 - say has been the total amount of time I
122:04 - spent building this in the livestream
122:12 - and how do I say lay how do I say it
122:19 - again that the YouTube channel from
122:21 - James layoffs OS layoffs OS lay us OS
122:26 - okay okay all right so I don't know if
122:30 - this is necessary but Matthew you can
122:32 - use it if you want hello this coding
122:38 - challenge that you were about to watch
122:39 - this is the final result
122:41 - it is a 4d tesseract visualized in 3d
122:44 - also 40 tries again hello this coding
122:51 - challenge you're about to watch right
122:52 - here this is the final result
122:54 - it is a four-dimensional hypercube also
122:57 - known as a tesseract visualized in three
123:00 - dimensions but really in two dimensions
123:03 - on this two-dimensional screen that
123:04 - you're watching this now so I just
123:07 - completed this coding challenge in a
123:09 - livestream the livestream was about 73
123:11 - hours look full of debugging the coding
123:14 - challenge itself is much shorter it is
123:15 - kind of long but less stuff is edited
123:17 - out of like going off on debugging
123:19 - tangents if you're interested in seeing
123:20 - all those debugging 10 tangents you
123:22 - could check this video's description
123:23 - into a link to the live stream where I
123:25 - did this but also I just want to briefly
123:27 - mention thank you to what I'm gonna read
123:33 - it this introduction saying way too long
123:35 - layoffs OS I'm gonna try this one more
123:38 - time
123:44 - hello you are about to watch be careful
123:48 - a coding challenge for I where I make
123:51 - this this is a four-dimensional
123:54 - hypercube I mean not really but it is a
123:56 - four it mathematically it's a
123:58 - four-dimensional hypercube projected
123:59 - into 3d and then processing this
124:02 - computer program thing is taking that 3d
124:05 - math and then projecting it into 2d so
124:07 - you could look at it and see it anyway
124:09 - if you watch the whole coding challenge
124:10 - that what I just said there might
124:12 - actually make sense to you so um it took
124:14 - me a very long time to do this I had
124:16 - lots of problems what you're about to
124:17 - watch is still long but edited down if
124:19 - you want to see the full livestream
124:21 - which is three thousand four hundred and
124:22 - twenty two hours long you can find a
124:24 - link to that in this video's description
124:25 - also a big thank you to lay us OS the
124:28 - YouTube channel where there's a
124:29 - wonderful video about what is forty the
124:31 - hypercube I will link to that in this
124:33 - video description as well I mentioned
124:34 - also a coding challenge but I wanted to
124:36 - mention it right up front okay
124:38 - hope you enjoyed this coding challenging
124:40 - make it all the way to the end
124:41 - and you make your own version of this
124:42 - please share it with me goodbye I'll be
124:46 - not goodbye but goodbye right now for me
124:48 - and I'm gonna keep going okay I guess
124:54 - okay
124:55 - alright I am tired I need a moment I
125:03 - need a moment I'm gonna put on some
125:06 - music for you all
125:08 - [Music]
125:09 - I don't know what this one is some other
125:11 - free music I downloaded I'm gonna really
125:14 - build out my soundboard and I'm just
125:17 - gonna check
125:18 - I'm gonna check just some things to see
125:22 - what how much time I have if there's any
125:24 - emergencies
125:45 - I'm just check-in
125:49 - just checking a few things making sure
125:52 - there's no urgent messages for me from
125:55 - any of my other lives oh there was a
126:03 - message that I missed what time is that
126:05 - message I can't see here
126:09 - [Music]
126:12 - is this relaxing you this music I know
126:16 - where I put my phone
126:38 - Oh what message was from over an hour
126:40 - ago okay but I did reply to it
126:43 - all right I'm trying to decide if I have
126:45 - the stamina or energy to do anything
126:48 - else today let's take a look at some ml5
126:53 - let's consider some other ml5 stuff
127:07 - I don't have my ukulele otherwise I did
127:09 - my ukulele tuner the feature extractor
127:12 - is too much for me to take on right now
127:22 - I think I probably should call it a
127:26 - night I think I have I mean
127:41 - pose net would be fun to do this is pose
127:49 - net by the way if you haven't seen this
127:52 - [Music]
128:06 - what's the natural what not the natural
128:09 - what's the sort of progression here if I
128:11 - think about if I think about what I've
128:19 - done in terms of these ml5 videos so I
128:28 - did
128:29 - intro to ml 5 wherever that is image
128:34 - classification and web can I at least
128:36 - can make a list of what are the things I
128:39 - intend to do so
128:45 - a work Tyvek that's gonna be in the fall
128:49 - now let's make a list here
129:00 - and to do the convolutional Network just
129:07 - trying to think here so did image
129:08 - classification you know anything I might
129:13 - do classify this I did plane image
129:23 - classification I did a miss class with
129:25 - webcam you do the feature extractor to
129:29 - make a classifier and do a regression
129:31 - think those are both kind of interesting
129:34 - LS TM text style transfer pics to pics
129:40 - these are all the things I could do pose
129:42 - net Yolo and word to Beck so weird to
129:47 - Beck that's gonna come in the fall so
129:50 - I'm gonna do that in my a-to-z course
129:51 - pics the pics and style transfer I have
129:54 - some plans for those but it's gonna
129:55 - involve a guest so that's also gonna be
129:57 - fall so these these are the options
130:02 - right now if I was gonna do more Alice T
130:04 - Anna's also I'm planning to do that
130:06 - later so I think I'll hold off on that
130:08 - because that's also for my fall class so
130:12 - the feature extractor opposed net and
130:14 - Yolo are the three things Yolo is really
130:22 - slow right now so I don't know to what
130:24 - extent let's run the example it's worth
130:26 - doing that as a video
130:34 - oh the camera is off person that's
130:47 - pretty cool
130:55 - cell phone cell phone is there a bell in
131:03 - Yolo person what about like a pencil
131:13 - sofa really things are cell phones and
131:15 - people okay I think I'm too exhausted
131:24 - from the 40 to do anything else I think
131:27 - I might so all right let's talk about
131:29 - time and schedule for a second
131:33 - I am I saw something like Tetris
131:36 - strawpoll it sees a hand holding
131:44 - something and thinks it's a cell phone
131:45 - that's super interesting that's a very
131:47 - good point so that's really at such a
131:49 - good point on alka makes in the chat and
131:51 - thinking about machine learning alright
131:53 - so I am going on vacation I will be away
131:59 - at a secret location with very little
132:00 - internet for almost three weeks there's
132:05 - other things going on in that time my
132:06 - vacation is in exactly three weeks but I
132:08 - will be not live-streaming next week the
132:11 - week after or the week after it's today
132:14 - August so this counts as a live stream
132:17 - but to live streams in August I will be
132:20 - back Tetris is not happening right now
132:23 - that's the lovely idea
132:25 - 6:00 6:15 I mean I just like I need to I
132:30 - need a fresh start so I won't be back so
132:33 - right now the edited versions of these
132:35 - videos will come out slowly over the
132:37 - next few weeks there's a good chance
132:41 - that I'm gonna be able to come back and
132:42 - do just like one more line when it's try
132:44 - to produce a little bit more content for
132:45 - a while I'm away
132:46 - tomorrow afternoon Saturday so I'm gonna
132:50 - try to stop by is gonna be around here
132:53 - in the neighborhood going from here to
132:54 - there and I'm able to stop in for a
132:55 - couple hours and I could do I think it
132:58 - would actually doing the feature
132:59 - extractor stuff it's sort of a big topic
133:02 - but it would be worth it I'm just trying
133:04 - the site is that the
133:05 - thing like the machine learning so I've
133:09 - gotta like work up slowly but I think
133:11 - actually feature the feature extractor
133:13 - is kind of the next thing so the
133:20 - question is the game of code writes in
133:27 - the chat Tetris doesn't take long to
133:30 - make it's pretty straightforward so the
133:33 - question is I mean I'm just sort of
133:35 - curious I will do a straw poll I'm not
133:36 - gonna do any of the topics right now but
133:38 - I could do something a bit more
133:39 - substantial tomorrow whoa is this the
133:44 - same thing I've always been using and
133:45 - they just like change this design or
133:52 - this is what I've been using yes that's
133:54 - what I always been using there's like
133:55 - straw pulled on me
134:00 - next topic so this is hard because it's
134:06 - gonna kind of need a runoff cuz really
134:08 - it's like I want to say it's like ml5
134:13 - allow multiple options oh so you can
134:16 - vote for more than one thing I might
134:17 - allow that so you can kind of vote for
134:20 - like a cup or than one ml5 feature
134:24 - extractor so what the feature extractor
134:29 - is it allows you to basically do what's
134:32 - called transfer learning so take the
134:34 - mobile net model and say like hey you
134:36 - don't know about what a pencil is I'm
134:37 - gonna show you a lot of pencils and add
134:39 - that as a label to something you can
134:41 - recognize it's but there's a bit more to
134:44 - it than that obviously in terms of the
134:45 - limitations of what you can do ml5 pose
134:48 - net and Yolo another option would be
134:56 - tetris nor something else
135:02 - oh the doodle classifier and this is
135:07 - without ml5 with TF KS directly that
135:11 - would be doing convolutional neural net
135:13 - neural networks and I kind of wanted to
135:15 - make a bunch of processing sketches that
135:17 - show how the pieces
135:18 - network work but that would be part of
135:21 - that to you all right I don't so I think
135:25 - I just allowed people to check more than
135:27 - one which is a little bit silly because
135:29 - but if you're like really interested in
135:31 - ml so I don't know you guys can game try
135:33 - to game the system but here is the URL
135:37 - for the straw poll
135:57 - [Music]
136:01 - right I should have made you choose one
136:04 - this multiple I kind of wanted to make
136:06 - it you could only pick two but I guess
136:12 - can you see the results if I don't show
136:14 - them like I'm gonna go over here view
136:18 - results yeah anybody can see the results
136:21 - Oh what got interesting
136:39 - hopes you enjoy Tetris hey I'm not
136:44 - saying I'm gonna do what you vote for
136:46 - I'm just curious to know and I can't
136:56 - capably I'll put Tetris on there what
136:58 - have a steak sodoku salt over okay I
137:34 - mean the link someone can post it in the
137:35 - chat but there it is
137:37 - [Music]
137:40 - you should have put four rune I know I I
137:42 - almost feel like for a Tetris I can
137:44 - handle more than Goro annoying people
137:50 - are interested in that doodle classifier
137:53 - interesting it's pretty interesting
137:55 - results here but it's like Tetris just
138:01 - everybody's second choice but really if
138:05 - I only gave you one choice it would all
138:07 - pick this one that's what I was sort of
138:11 - planning to do well how to code Tetris
138:29 - code it yourself
138:31 - Tetris programming from scratch so I
138:33 - could just thirty six minutes so watch
138:36 - this guy it's gonna take me 17 hours
138:39 - learn how to create a game Tetris in six
138:41 - minutes
138:43 - and yet the video is four minutes
138:46 - interesting meth meth method to this
138:48 - this is I mean meth meth methods
138:50 - videos are excellent I mean I'm sure
138:52 - these videos are excellent too I just
138:53 - haven't watched them out of these
138:55 - channels
138:55 - [Music]
139:00 - simple tetris clone written in java oh
139:05 - [Music]
139:07 - yeah this is good it's gonna be
139:17 - multi-part for sure right no way to not
139:20 - do it as a multi-part thing tetris
139:33 - requirements a left-right key a hard
139:37 - drop key or rotation key a preview piece
139:40 - oh I'm not doing the preview piece full
139:43 - set of all seven kinds of shapes I'm not
139:47 - doing the preview piece it's definitely
139:49 - not happen these are like 1d Tetris of
139:55 - 2d that I could do here's a JavaScript
139:58 - under JavaScript see tetris JavaScript
140:00 - oh yeah this is like very little code I
140:06 - could do this drawing some stuff
140:11 - rotating some stuff oh god this is gonna
140:14 - be so painful this is gonna be so
140:16 - painful for me because I'm really gonna
140:18 - do this without having done in advance
140:20 - so you're gonna see you're gonna see a
140:25 - mess there of me let's refresh the
140:28 - results oh boy not getting any better is
140:30 - it
140:37 - I might have to do the feature I'm just
140:41 - warning you let's say it came down to
140:47 - hmm there's ballot stuffing going on
140:52 - isn't there I think there's some ballot
140:53 - something going on alright everybody
140:59 - thank you for tuning in I could answer a
141:02 - few questions make the preview piece no
141:07 - preview no Tetris do pong again the
141:11 - preview part is easy I guess so if I
141:12 - make the drop then if I make the drop
141:15 - button the preview is just showing where
141:17 - the drop button is gonna put it right so
141:19 - yeah I can make the preview all right
141:21 - I'll make the preview hmm just only use
141:26 - a few pieces like to thank you
141:28 - Tetris is so boring compared to the ML
141:31 - stuff for de Tetris well I don't know
141:37 - what to do I would say the people have
141:40 - spoken but ultimately I am the decider
141:47 - pretty you need to use single
141:50 - transferable vote really what does that
141:52 - mean 1d Tetris oh there is a 1d
141:57 - treacherous but this is like needs to
142:02 - run flash okay allow
142:09 - oh yeah this is 1d Tetris this is
142:12 - awesome this is really brilliant this is
142:21 - the same one yeah 1d Tetris everybody
142:34 - that's pretty brilliant
142:43 - would it be crazy to actually do 1d
142:46 - Tetris first alright so I definitely
142:54 - like the idea of doing Tetris with only
142:59 - a few different pieces what if I did
143:01 - Tetris with just one Pete one one tile
143:06 - pieces and then I would incorporate tile
143:09 - that might that might I'm trying to give
143:11 - the order to do this like what could I
143:13 - do in a single video Tetris with all the
143:19 - pieces are just a single cell and then
143:23 - as part two I could add more complex
143:25 - pieces and rotation would that make
143:27 - sense oh oh that's a good idea
143:31 - lei ah so as to saying hey I can work
143:33 - with you on 4d Tetris wouldn't actually
143:38 - I do 3d Tetris first 1d Tetris on April
143:44 - Fool's that's a really good job that's a
143:46 - really good idea I'll try to remember
143:47 - that yeah we could do a 4d tetrode we
143:51 - I'm I would love to do a collaboration
143:52 - with Leia so s so like some kind of like
143:57 - 40 Tetris thing would be really fun so
144:01 - maybe we could think about two so one D
144:03 - Tetris than 2d then 3d yeah
144:10 - I'm really exhausted how many hours of
144:13 - live streaming have I done today like
144:14 - four hours so I think I better go before
144:16 - I get talked into doing something else
144:18 - right again
144:22 - I can't believe what's nice is this
144:23 - hasn't crashed I don't know why I was
144:25 - crashing so much earlier and so yeah
144:40 - alright everybody let me let me let me
144:54 - let me go I think I mean that no
144:58 - guarantee is here but I'm gonna attempt
144:59 - to come back tomorrow it probably should
145:02 - continue the machine learning stuff
145:04 - because that's kind of the track that
145:07 - I'm on the tesseract was a break from
145:09 - that now you're asking me to do Tetris
145:10 - my fault for putting that in mr. choices
145:12 - I think I can't do Tetris tomorrow
145:20 - like this like desired you like one more
145:23 - little thing right now this is a
145:27 - terrible idea
145:29 - 6:30 feels early because I'm always
145:31 - running so late okay this is probably
145:36 - never gonna happen just kids were
145:39 - wondering would I do a sign
145:47 - why did this Barnsley fern I gotta close
145:50 - some of these I did this this is sort of
145:55 - did I did this I keep meaning to do this
145:58 - have I done this that's a good like
146:02 - winter themed one I really want to do
146:07 - tic-tac-toe and then that what's that
146:09 - like min/max algorithm or something
146:17 - tic-tac-toe might be better than tetris
146:24 - tic-tac-toe with neural network you can
146:27 - have it like play itself and learn
146:46 - you are not a polling expert the vote
146:48 - for the ml stuff got dived among
146:51 - multiple videos yeah I agree I agree
147:17 - I'm reading about single transferable
147:19 - vote now snake I have done the snake
147:25 - okay
147:27 - tic-tac-toe with min Max is pretty easy
147:29 - but so satisfying and fun
147:37 - for d tic-tac-toe Tetris Kinect for with
147:43 - machine learning that would be fun to
147:44 - connect for I like Kinect for that's a
147:46 - fun game maybe I should just do 1d
147:56 - Tetris right now if I do 1d Tetris right
147:59 - now will you all be satisfied and I
148:01 - cannot do Tetris tomorrow
148:30 - this okay options for the pull alright
148:34 - fine
148:37 - it's gonna make the only option yes I'm
148:42 - voting for my I'm voting for yes all
148:46 - right
148:47 - it's been decided I can do 1d Tetris
148:54 - right now
148:55 - I like that for April Fool's though I
149:01 - could save it we can just I can do it
149:04 - now but not release it until April
149:05 - Fool's now nobody has the URL nobody can
149:14 - see this URL if you can catch it fast oh
149:22 - it's here
149:30 - Oh Oh uh-huh
149:34 - this is exciting this is looking good
150:14 - Connect four for your Italian followers
150:16 - uh Oh Oh things are gone things are
150:23 - going south fast oh boy this is bad news
150:28 - everybody
150:36 - what if I read you some random numbers
150:39 - if you do what I I got to start with
150:43 - like one deeds to get to 2d to get to 3d
150:46 - oh this is very confusing bad help me
150:56 - out people I kind of
151:11 - I'm just gonna read a little my book
151:13 - here 53,000 so I'm so into you I'm so
151:18 - tired
151:20 - somehow I make my own voting system
151:31 - fractals are cool but I'm nothing to do
151:33 - with Tetris rock-paper-scissors oh I
151:36 - love that but the the best
151:42 - rock-paper-scissor strategy is to be
151:44 - completely random pure randomness why
151:51 - this is really why this is like very
151:53 - polarizing
152:22 - I'm just seeing her refresh those I'm
152:24 - sorry I'm so I don't think I should do
152:26 - the 1d tetris thing now Hey
152:29 - fortunately no seems to be the answer go
152:35 - home it's dinner time
152:37 - go and receive okay I think we're done
152:42 - with this poll this is no consents
152:44 - there's no consensus here there's no
152:47 - consensus
153:09 - hmm oh look at that but I don't think I
153:12 - code this in this video all right
153:17 - everybody let's look at the tesseract
153:23 - somewhere
153:34 - it's interested it's nice to sort of
153:36 - hear what people are interested in which
153:38 - is helpful to me I am going to be going
153:43 - how long is this live streaming going on
153:46 - over two hours right yeah thank you for
153:49 - tuning in
153:50 - sorry that I just wasted like a half an
153:52 - hour of your time there and I'm gonna
153:58 - look into some of these ideas and think
154:02 - about it I might be back tomorrow I can
154:06 - work that out
154:07 - otherwise you won't actually see me in a
154:09 - live stream until the very end of the
154:12 - month like August 28th or 27th or 29 is
154:18 - the 25th of Friday or 25th of Saturday
154:20 - the 27th whatever that Monday is I think
154:22 - the 27th would be the earliest yeah 2
154:32 - hours and 30 minutes yeah so I said well
154:36 - I said set out what I meant to
154:38 - accomplish today which was to program a
154:41 - tesseract I will take a few minutes to
154:45 - answer any questions I will take a few
154:58 - minutes to answer any questions
155:08 - huh one thing is that I'm working on
155:11 - capturing a lot of my videos I kind of
155:13 - haven't been keeping up with that if you
155:16 - are interested in submitting captions
155:20 - sometimes well mentions I mean who's
155:21 - watching anymore now but I would you can
155:25 - go to there's a link that I can share
155:28 - let me share it in the chat I'm really
155:33 - interested in getting English language
155:39 - and other languages as well but often
155:40 - it's nice if a video does have any
155:42 - English language captions to get that
155:43 - first because it makes translations
155:45 - easier I'm just gonna post a link in the
155:48 - chat to here is a place where you can
155:54 - where's our live chat going on here's a
155:58 - place Oh Matt Graham I just saw that
156:03 - question this is a link did that just go
156:06 - in yes that's a link where you can
156:08 - submit captions so if anybody has time
156:12 - or interest in doing that please do Matt
156:18 - Graham asks when do we receive the slack
156:22 - invite via email well guess what you
156:27 - could receive it right now I don't see
156:33 - you in here though oh right okay so Matt
156:37 - Graham you need to go to the community
156:39 - so this I have a slack channel which is
156:41 - for members and also patrons you you if
156:47 - you want to join that you can click the
156:49 - join button or the go click over to
156:51 - patreon you have to then go to the
156:54 - community tab there's no slack YouTube
156:56 - integration so you have to go to the
156:58 - community tab and then there's a post
157:00 - there with a link to a Google Form which
157:02 - you can enter in your email and your
157:05 - YouTube username so I can match it up
157:06 - and then I will send you an invite so if
157:08 - you do that in the next minute
157:10 - I will do that Thank You Ryan a nice
157:18 - comment to hear that you Oh you start
157:19 - computer science at University this
157:21 - September that's one of a good luck do I
157:23 - speak Spanish I do not speak Spanish no
157:30 - I'm good I cube ik asks I'm going to
157:32 - take a class next week where I will
157:35 - learn about AI and m/l using the Python
157:38 - tensorflow library do you have any tips
157:41 - for me um have fun don't feel like
157:47 - you're the only one who doesn't
157:48 - understand stuff because everybody else
157:50 - also doesn't understand stuff but
157:51 - everybody's afraid to say it and be
157:55 - critical and think about the data that
157:57 - you're that's being used in a project
157:59 - and it's applications those would be my
158:00 - pieces of advice can you talk a bit
158:08 - Nabil asking talk a bit about pics -
158:10 - pics so if you're interested in pics to
158:12 - pics I'll refer you to the work of
158:15 - yunying she and the ml5 library I
158:18 - believe I'm gonna go find this easily
158:20 - but you Ning she picks two pics
158:23 - I feel like hopefully she has a blog
158:26 - post about it but anyway I have a plan
158:29 - in the future to do I thought there was
158:31 - a blog post maybe about her work with
158:33 - pics depicts an ml5 but I'm gonna save
158:34 - that for another time
158:38 - are you more of a Java or a JavaScript
158:40 - kind of kind of person Java
158:46 - what is pan man asked what is feature
158:49 - extraction classifier oh come on I
158:51 - should do that tomorrow
158:52 - that's gonna trust me Jeep you know the
158:54 - feature extractor stuff is so powerful
158:56 - and interesting I should definitely do
158:58 - that tomorrow thank you for asking that
159:01 - totally makes sense but what just
159:04 - happened here all right started over was
159:07 - about 37 seconds in second favorite
159:13 - programming language after Java
159:15 - JavaScript would that be third favorite
159:17 - programming language I don't have what
159:21 - is Udacity ml course good no idea maybe
159:28 - will you ever do deep Q learning boy I
159:32 - should really only pick out the
159:34 - questions that I have too quick to
159:35 - answer I don't know Oh mr. moose addict
159:41 - let me answer this question in the slack
159:43 - channel directly asking about this
159:46 - project from a while ago I will answer
159:48 - that I'd rather not discuss do you
159:54 - recommend to an engineer to use
159:57 - JavaScript for data science so yeah as
160:03 - you might be aware if you've watched
160:05 - this channel before I basically I really
160:08 - try to stay away of recommending tools
160:10 - or particular programming languages for
160:12 - me you know the right programming
160:16 - language to use is the programming
160:18 - language that's in front of you right
160:19 - now and you know everything has its pros
160:22 - and cons and at some point you're gonna
160:24 - find things are like oh gosh this thing
160:25 - that I made in this programming language
160:27 - is kind of a disaster compared to how
160:29 - I'm doing it over here but I don't think
160:31 - there's no easy answers to these
160:32 - questions there's no i this is my
160:33 - project use this so I really can't
160:36 - answer that are you somebody who knows a
160:39 - little JavaScript and is interested in
160:40 - the field of data science tinkering
160:42 - around with tensorflow jess ml5 other
160:45 - JavaScript libraries d3 looking at
160:47 - observable HQ notebooks all these things
160:50 - are possible and worth do
160:52 - his JavaScript language for data science
160:55 - probably not but you know perfectly fine
160:59 - is it true that times 0.5 is faster than
161:03 - / - I hear that all the time
161:06 - magnet stop ignoring me I don't know
161:10 - what question I ignored but I didn't see
161:12 - it or ignored it for good reason I'm
161:14 - trying to stick to on topic questions
161:17 - and ones that I can answer is this
161:20 - stream starting in the middle or ending
161:23 - it is ending looking at the chat see
161:34 - more questions thanks everybody for your
161:42 - support just watching as a support being
161:46 - members of support recommending the
161:48 - videos to somebody as support making
161:51 - your own stuff inspired by stuff that I
161:53 - made a support deciding to not watch
161:57 - anymore because you have something else
161:59 - you want to do in your life is support
162:01 - all those things are valid alright
162:04 - did I go to college yes oh the pencil
162:08 - eraser doesn't work it's not capacitive
162:12 - somebody asked what do I get if I would
162:15 - support you as a patreon so first of all
162:17 - honestly if you want to join as a member
162:20 - or as a patron I would say do it because
162:22 - for some reason doing that makes you
162:24 - feel good and you have the means because
162:27 - what you get I don't know I don't know
162:29 - if I have anything really worthwhile for
162:32 - you but I will say that the slack
162:34 - channel is a wonderful community of
162:36 - pretty nice and welcoming people and a
162:38 - lot of experts in there like way better
162:39 - answering questions than me and I'm kind
162:41 - of not in there that off I'm gonna move
162:43 - in there as much as I can I like to be
162:46 - in there but there's lots of people in
162:47 - there who are better equipped to answer
162:48 - your questions so that's probably the
162:49 - main thing you get is kind of joining
162:51 - that particular commune of this
162:53 - community and then you know I will get
162:56 - around to mailing you stickers or a sign
162:57 - book and that kind of thing eventually I
162:59 - just did
162:59 - it does take quite a while for me to do
163:01 - that so again if you want a book I would
163:04 - suggest just buying it but if you are
163:07 - that's that's really why I really don't
163:10 - want to advocate too much for joining
163:12 - the patreon or the YouTube membership it
163:14 - really does help me have the resources
163:17 - and time to make these videos but that
163:20 - that would be that's my answer
163:21 - so I appreciate it and I encourage you
163:23 - if you feel like it's a thing you want
163:25 - to do great but I will love you just as
163:30 - much if you do not join
163:44 - I have some really interesting questions
163:46 - here what did you learn in college okay
163:51 - eight seconds left on the clock I
163:54 - studied in college a long time ago I my
163:59 - major was a mathematics and philosophy I
164:01 - graduated in 1995 and I didn't do any
164:07 - computer programming at all in college
164:09 - not once maybe I did and I just don't
164:11 - remember but if I did it certainly
164:13 - wasn't substantive and then I didn't
164:15 - actually do any computer when graduated
164:17 - college 1995 I didn't do any programming
164:18 - I think I took it actually that's not
164:22 - true
164:22 - I took an evening C++ course a year or
164:25 - two out of colleges to see and it didn't
164:27 - didn't take and then I started as an ITP
164:30 - student in 2001 and that's when I really
164:35 - started doing programming more seriously
164:36 - I've never done it seriously but it
164:38 - didn't spend more time doing it so I
164:41 - really started luck you know to me I was
164:43 - so young then I feel like but late in
164:45 - life comparatively like you know kids
164:48 - nowadays my kids my older son who is 10
164:53 - probably did his first like coding class
164:55 - and scratch at like the age of 7 maybe
164:57 - um so and I he's done some p5 workshops
165:01 - since
165:06 - mad Nick 45 asks how old are you and I
165:10 - say look only into your own username for
165:14 - my age okay alright so that's it
165:24 - everybody I'm gonna go I feel like I did
165:27 - not I did not do what I wanted to do
165:29 - this week which was generate tons of
165:32 - content to have new stuff on the channel
165:34 - over the next few weeks why on the way
165:36 - know why I'm worrying about this let the
165:39 - channel take a break I will say that my
165:42 - commitment hold on let's do just bear
165:45 - with me I've been meaning to do this
165:46 - accounting so if you don't mind I want
165:50 - to do this accounting I'm gonna go to my
165:53 - channel because I want to figure out
165:55 - like what do i what do I really need to
165:57 - make sure I do I'm gonna go to playlist
165:59 - I'm gonna go to created playlists well I
166:07 - just revealed something about myself
166:11 - does anybody watch this show I only
166:14 - watched season one one but I like I love
166:17 - this show the genius I really want to do
166:18 - coding challenges about the genius if
166:23 - anybody is a fan of the genius I don't
166:25 - know it's it's me I mean I watched it a
166:27 - long time ago and I meant to get the
166:29 - season 2 and I never just got around to
166:30 - it okay uh I'm looking for created
166:38 - playlists yes okay this is why I don't
166:43 - like to be logged into my own account
166:45 - live streams live stream archive there's
166:52 - 160 Jesus oh you oh boy okay so let's
166:59 - look if somebody could do this full
167:01 - accounting for me that would be oh it
167:03 - doesn't give me the dates here oh this
167:06 - is ridiculous okay I don't think I can
167:07 - do this accounting right now because I
167:09 - just want I just want to see the dates
167:11 - of each one of these here so I could
167:15 - [Music]
167:21 - I really I mentioned the genius before
167:23 - haven't I I think I have yeah I really
167:25 - want to do an accounting of this now if
167:27 - I so let's just see if I humor me for a
167:31 - second here let me just open this here
167:33 - so working backwards if I open all these
167:38 - and new tabs I just want to go back to
167:40 - like June
167:42 - I know that I was doing a ton in like
167:44 - April May so let's see does this at
167:47 - least have the date a live stream on May
167:51 - 11th okay so let's let's try to let's go
167:55 - back to May which one was that because I
167:58 - actually might have been light in May
167:59 - due to thesis which one was that that
168:01 - was 136 made a fourth that's obviously
168:06 - May and 134 is 134 is April so let's
168:14 - close that out so let's open up this May
168:22 - June July August my goal is to average
168:28 - for a November Chris wall oh did anybody
168:32 - yes
168:33 - did anybody I see Matt Graham so when
168:42 - you fill out that I need to match it
168:43 - with your user I'm going to choose to
168:44 - trust this so I'm gonna send yeah and by
168:50 - the way I'm getting text messages from
168:52 - home because my Phillips hue lights they
168:58 - flash when somebody joins so hey the
169:01 - lights are flashing okay so I'm gonna
169:04 - send those slack invites soon all right
169:09 - actually what I should do is just work
169:11 - on my other stuff that I need to work on
169:12 - just like keep live-streaming but I
169:15 - think I think it's Friday I'm gonna go
169:16 - I'm gonna take a break okay
169:19 - so wait I'm getting so many messages
169:22 - okay now let's look at this okay so May

171:09 - 136 137 so 136 at 137 136 is May 11 so
171:17 - that's number one 137 is May 23rd that's
171:23 - number one
171:27 - 138 is May 24th one 139 is May 24th I
171:37 - mean I guess of two in one day I'm gonna
171:39 - count that as two because these are
171:40 - along that was only this one's only an
171:43 - hour 10 minutes I'm
171:44 - count as one but I don't know 140 is May
171:48 - 31st whoops I probably should delete one
171:52 - here so that's a total of four four and
171:54 - a half I'm gonna say that's four and a
171:56 - half in May okay now 140 what did I just
172:02 - what it was when I stopped at 141 was
172:04 - made was that June no June 8th so 140
172:10 - was May I can't keep track a nice system
172:12 - is really flawed May 31st
172:15 - okay so 141 is June good - 2 hours and
172:22 - 15 minutes 141 where's 142 142 is June
172:29 - good 3 hours long that's pretty good
172:33 - 143 June 2 and a half hours long June's
172:39 - got a lot looks like
172:41 - 144 so I'm only a June 18th
172:44 - I've already got 4 did I forget May 4th
172:54 - I forgot May 4th so five and a half 145
173:02 - 145 is June 27th I took a little break
173:05 - there it looks like which is 145 June
173:14 - 27th 146 it's July 20th oh because I
173:23 - went away yeah yeah that makes sense so
173:26 - June has 5
173:32 - okay so 146 is July and August at 1 July
173:39 - 147 is also July 27th - in July
173:43 - did I really only do 2 in July I think
173:47 - there's a July 147 what's one is today
173:52 - 148 this was July yeah last Friday that
173:57 - makes sense
174:00 - so did I forget may the 4th did I not
174:09 - get this one
174:10 - 135 yeah so now I missed 135 which was
174:14 - also in May okay so May at five and a
174:17 - half June had five July had two and
174:23 - August so far has I'm gonna count this
174:26 - as two because I did a full livestream
174:28 - this morning and this afternoon
174:30 - so we average that 14 and a half divided
174:35 - by four so I just need one and a half
174:40 - more live streams because if I get to 16
174:43 - by the end of August that's an average
174:45 - of four so I need one and a half more so
174:49 - if I do one tomorrow and I get one one
174:50 - more and at the end of August I'm
174:52 - actually be at four in August and that
174:54 - will be good so that's what that's the
174:56 - sort of commitment I'm making in terms
174:58 - of people supporting through the
175:00 - membership and that sort of thing okay
175:04 - all right let me check let me check
175:07 - these slack invites if you are in the
175:09 - chat right now you just joined as a
175:10 - member please let me know did I send the
175:20 - invites we hold on I'm just gonna I'm
175:26 - gonna do a little double checking of
175:27 - this ascending member slack invites now
175:35 - we're to go community community channel
175:47 - memberships
176:00 - okay so now let me look for uh-huh
176:09 - seven hours ago okay great this is
176:11 - validated slack invite coming in okay
176:24 - now one more one more coming all right
176:33 - Matt it's like invite coming and there
176:40 - we go I'd be curious actually yeah so
176:42 - I'd be curious for a graph of actually
176:44 - the amount of time that I live streamed
176:47 - I'm sure I can use the YouTube API or
176:49 - something I really also this is
176:51 - something I'm really like toying with I
176:53 - sort of feel like the live priz what you
176:58 - just joined go to the community tab go
177:01 - to the communities have find that
177:03 - members only post there's click click to
177:06 - the Google forum and enter your email
177:07 - address there and just put prison the
177:09 - YouTube username column I feel like the
177:15 - live streams and the edited videos
177:17 - should be separate channels but I don't
177:20 - know how to break that apart now it's
177:22 - like too late because how do I start a
177:25 - new channel from scratch or to say like
177:26 - oh if you want the live streams so I
177:28 - think I'm probably not going to do that
177:30 - but if someone wants to try to talk me
177:31 - into that I'm open to the idea okay I
177:44 - don't see any more but anyway I will I
177:47 - will I will look at those oh yeah III
177:49 - can't say goodbye it's like a problem I
177:51 - have but so we'll see I'm gonna try to
177:55 - live stream for a little bit tomorrow to
177:56 - be honest with you I think I want to do
177:58 - some more ml5 stuff sorry to dissapoint
178:01 - about that Tetris I will keep that in
178:02 - mind that that's the thing about it
178:05 - though is like when am I ever else gonna
178:06 - do Tetris I'm gonna think about I'm
178:08 - gonna sleep on it I'm gonna sleep on it
178:10 - you can tweet me at Schiffman with
178:13 - you know strong-willed opinions if you
178:19 - like can comment on any YouTube video
178:22 - you want by the way I'm something weird
178:26 - happened the other day that I'm curious
178:27 - about I wonder if I could pull this up I
178:30 - think I can't pull this up without
178:32 - privacy issues let me see if I can I'll
178:36 - just mention it so I have that this
178:38 - video coding visualizing 500k
178:45 - subscribers this particular video the
178:51 - other day came up hey look
178:56 - this particular video is suddenly in my
179:00 - analytics was like what like hundred
179:05 - times the traffic that it would like
179:06 - normally have because it's an old video
179:08 - and nobody's watching it anymore
179:09 - and then I went looked at like
179:10 - geographically and it was up everywhere
179:12 - but the views from India we're like way
179:16 - up compared to everything else does this
179:19 - get to this get like linked from
179:20 - somewhere can anybody help me find that
179:25 - if anyway there's a idea why that
179:27 - happened I be curious to recreate it
179:29 - just look at my analytics right now to
179:31 - make sure that's not continuing to
179:33 - happen because it's just the
179:35 - arbitrariness of the YouTube
179:37 - recommendation algorithm is probably
179:39 - what it is
179:44 - right the snake game is what yes because
179:47 - very few people are 33 people in the
179:49 - last 60 minutes watched that video right
179:51 - now which is not very much I mean it's
179:53 - amazing in many sense
179:55 - hold on beginning Oh interesting Matthew
180:02 - in the chat makes a good suggestion if
180:03 - you want to separate the lie from the
180:05 - main channel spend a year streaming to
180:08 - both a new live only Channel and the
180:10 - current coding trained child I just feel
180:12 - like I wonder if there are people who
180:13 - want the notifications for the edited
180:16 - content and people who want the
180:18 - notifications for the live stream and
180:20 - those are two and having all that
180:21 - together redundant lis in the same
180:23 - channel is like too much and maybe I
180:26 - should have just
180:26 - coding trained live and coding trained
180:30 - Channel I don't know the answer to that
180:32 - so I'm curious for your views I gotta go
180:38 - I just can't say goodbye thank you for
180:48 - tuning in and entering
180:54 - the fourth dimension would be today I
180:56 - enjoyed it I'm so pleased this is
180:58 - something I've looked at for years and
181:00 - thought I have no idea how to do that
181:01 - okay I don't understand anything about
181:03 - it so uh what do I do when I finished
181:06 - the forum priz wha Griswald just wait
181:12 - for his wall here comes
181:21 - here comes frizz wall
181:40 - the invitation sent alright so I'm
181:43 - because I'm gonna be away for so long I
181:46 - do this does help me kind of think like
181:49 - I actually don't need to serve ice cream
181:52 - tomorrow just in terms of my own
181:53 - personal accounting to feel like I'm
181:55 - doing the amount that I sort of set out
181:57 - to do with my goals but it would be nice
182:00 - to get a little bit further with some
182:01 - stuff before tomorrow don't don't get
182:03 - your hopes up in terms of the tetris
182:04 - thing that that honestly seems pretty
182:06 - unlikely but thank you for indulging me
182:08 - with the straw poll I do see it as
182:09 - something people are interested in and I
182:11 - will see you all tomorrow okay goodbye
182:17 - everybody see you maybe tomorrow if not
182:20 - at the end of the month stay tuned for
182:22 - the edited versions of the videos and as
182:24 - always thank you for your support
182:27 - I need a tagline like Jabril has that
182:30 - great like always remember to always
182:32 - feed your curiosity I don't have a good
182:35 - tagline this is all I got is this it's
182:39 - been a while I'm gonna play you out with
182:40 - the trailer bye everybody
182:43 - and that totally did not work whoops
182:51 - how come the trailers not playing oh
182:53 - wait that's weird
182:59 - come the trailers not playing loop
183:03 - restart hide stars huh well I guess you
183:08 - won't be seeing the trailer that's weird
183:11 - hold on I mean just just bear with me
183:13 - for a second let me add a new scene here
183:17 - trailer 2 then all you two do is add
183:22 - media source right media source no no
183:27 - not a media source a
183:30 - [Music]
183:32 - VLC video source video capture device
183:35 - seen me source I thought I don't add I
183:41 - don't had a video to open broadcast
183:45 - studio I know you can't see me you
183:46 - entered the fifth dimension browser
183:51 - source no media source local file browse
184:02 - give me that
184:04 - oh I deleted that file I bet because I
184:08 - was doing like a clean-out of the I was
184:12 - doing a clean-out of the hold on I was
184:18 - doing a clean-out of I can't like
184:21 - examine this layer without book it's not
184:24 - filters I was doing a clean-out of oh
184:29 - hold on see if it's somebody because I
184:34 - had it's was like I got rid of Google
184:36 - Drive on this computer see if it's
184:38 - somewhere else okay hold on I said I was
184:42 - gonna play out with the trailer I'm
184:44 - gonna revive I'm gonna revive I got to
184:53 - make some icons come on people
184:55 - make me some icons actually I you know
184:58 - what I have to email I'm gonna take care
185:01 - of that I got an idea
185:03 - oops just give me a second this isn't
185:06 - gonna take too long we're gonna get that
185:11 - trailer download it delete it off the
185:15 - computer trailer
185:25 - okay download download anyway unload
185:38 - anyway is it downloaded it is downloaded
185:44 - trailer is coming back properties browse
185:51 - where is it in downloads there it is
185:54 - just leave it in downloads that's a good
185:56 - place for it
185:56 - oh there you go oh sorry about this
186:04 - studio few stalls or suggestions I'm
186:06 - ignoring the purposes I'm afraid of
186:08 - doing that

Cleaned transcript:

oh shoot alright this is my test to determine if YouTube is lying to me or not because very briefly before I started livestreaming I was poking around this audio library which browse and download free music for your project attribution not required of course I don't mind using music where attribution is required and I went to dark and I went to classical and I found Beethoven's fifth symphony there's all sorts of other stuff I could try as I feel like I need something for the 4th dimension because this is the coding train live episode where we will enter dimension that's how I said let's try this one where we will enter to mention all right anyway let me get a move on here I've got lots of time where do I got nowhere to be nothing to do so what you're seeing here by the way is what you're seeing here is a processing sketch that I made this morning let me correct the weird nonsense that I was playing with here messing around with it should be cosine negative sine sine cosine cosine negative sine cosine negative sine sine cosine okay so this should be if I've done everything correctly a spinning 3d cube with perspective but the renderer is the P 2d engine and this is my last piece of space melon it erases whatever is on my body revealing what is behind it will provide me with the energy that I need also must hope this camera is off erase this whiteboard I'm going to draw some diagrams and I'm just gonna get started this I feel remarkably ready to tackle this problem having done what I did this morning as much of a disasters that was I think I don't know I don't know about this white board eraser thingy that I've purchased from the internet is working a little bit better okay so just in case you didn't tune in this morning I did about a twohour live stream programming this and the idea for me was I wanted to learn how do three end and the most basic level how do 3d engines work how does it work to create the illusion of threedimensional perspective on a twodimensional surface and the answer it deal is has to do with matrices projection matrices rotation matrices and there's much more to it than that but I did the basics and hopefully this will and let me just move to the slack channel here um let me just see move this out of the way I'm alright no no I'm Superboy oh okay hello wake up we go this is really like the free copyright music there aren't a lot of choices you have to pick like the most obvious famous classical music piece I'd love to do something more obscure a little mall or maybe I don't know it would be good for 14 inches I also made it like much louder is it way too loud now oh tesseract is in the chat from the fourth dimension to our dimension okay I'm gonna turn this back down okay so let's do the phone trying to think about this I think we're gonna leave to start with this code like dare start I think I want to start from scratch is the thing I mean I definitely need this matrix oh you know what though this is why I probably shouldn't have I'm gonna have to add some code to this okay yes Simon I have seen that video before thank you for posting it for me I try to not have too many things in the chat here that have a that open up a big thing is I have the font very large so I could see it and so okay so let's see trying to think here trying to think here how do I want to do this alright I want to make a video where somebody could mostly program the tesseract from scratch so I think what I want to do is I'm going to end up redoing some of my code so I am erasing all this I'm gonna end up rewriting a lot of this code now I feel silly but I think I want to start over from scratch and the tesseract okay you know what I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave some bits in here let me see what bits can I leave in here okay so I'm going to leave the points for a cube I'm gonna leave this angle variable I'm going to leave the take this out I'm in P 3d now o p 3d and I'll leave this connect function okay I think this should do the trick mmm oh and I need to do scale I'm just thinking here I'll just do scale I forgot the scale affects the stroke wait here it's a little better oh and this has to be okay and then so this is annoying so I'm not gonna do it this way I'm gonna leave this the noise never it's you know it's always so quiet in here when I'm not livestreaming and since I started livestreaming there's always like right out in the hallway just right outside the door there's some construction and push them like furniture that has no wheels down this down the hallway make a loud scratching noise alright so what I'm gonna do is I'm going to say and then I'm just gonna use the scaled oh this is so silly what I'm doing oh this is so silly what I'm doing I have a better idea jammer goes off of course Jamie asks in the chat why is processing chosen for today's video do most people not prefer to follow along at p5 GS or is that just me you know I kind of go back and forth one of the reasons why I'm choosing to use processing right now is because I want to make use of its 3d rendering engine and I'm just much more confident using the 3d rendering engine of processing than the WebGL rendering engine of p5 which is to say one is better than the other it's just my own personal comfort level ok so I made all these points we're drawing stroke stroke weight 16 points connect them why do I not see my cube where's the cube everybody let's go scale 100 is still in there okay oh that was messing stuff up all right there we go now we can say rotate X by angle or something or rotate Y maybe all right alko writes I can make a fake tesseract without using actual 4d math yeah I was thinking of doing that that's where I that's what I started doing and then I was like jumping through so many hoops and I felt like I wanted to learn and think about the fourth dimension in a way that I hadn't thought about before and so that's why I'm going this route but that is a very good point all right so I think we are going to get started all right I need a marker alright how's everyone feeling this looks like this needs some triage ok ok alright I have to wake up I didn't I I was drinking a non caffeinated beverage this morning and then I just said the heck with that I thing is I don't know if it reads because I'm kind of tired at the end the day it's a Friday but I'm so excited to do this I hope that this becomes a video that is a good one Oh Marshall says I'm so excited get my coding train stickers I did a whole someone helped me with this today but a whole mailing of stickers went out today so if you signed up to be a member before August 1st your stickers are actually in the mail right now to you I'm so be on the lookout for those again I don't keep saying this someone's gonna actually like volunteer in the slack Channel I would love someone to help me spruce up the membership stuff so I want to add a whole bunch of emojis and icons and I'm thinking of maybe some additional rewards if that's of interest but if you would love to volunteer to help with that please let me know you should try Expo wet erase markers yeah that's what I got that's what these are I ordered them someone recommended these to me these are Expo wet erase markers I think right right isn't that what these are I have another one I got a pack of 2 I don't know where the second one went somebody tweeted is that me last week and I ordered them instantly from a company that rhymes with flam is on because I have a full I'm that runs his fly membership oh you know what something else about flam is on I guess I can mention flam is on now because I was working I had like I was kind of sitting somewhere where like I had to wait tonight there's nothing for me to do which very rarely happens and so I actually took a little time to work on amazon.com slash shop slash coding Train I think is the URL I have one of these new coding train slash shop maybe the coding train slash shop alright I know how to get to it if I go to YouTube the coding train and I click on I'm gonna get started coding soon Amazon here yes I don't know amazon.com slash shop slash the coding train I started organizing things into categories here of like stuff that I use and you could I mean this is really just a moneymaking thing you know hopefully this is like a helpful thing to you cause like you were looking for that book that I referenced it's here but this Amazon is set this kind of stuff up so that I can get a commission which is helpful I'm not gonna turn it down but uh really I recommend you check out this nice list because here's where you can get your own copy of a million random digits or the same exact train whistle that I use this is a unicorn floaty III I could not I actually have one of these and I couldn't stay on it so I know if I recommend it this is a train hat that's really that's what I look for but it has I have some other other stuff in here too and if you have ideas for things that you think I should include or things that I mentioned periodically I would love to include them in here alright that's the Amazon shop alright so now where am I what what happened to all my windows oh wait maybe that's fine okay okay this I don't need the audio library right now I'm not gonna worry about this I'm not gonna worry about this this is what I'm gonna worry about and this is also is there any way I can get this video this page to pop up let's then go here this is what I'll do I want this page to pop up without playing the video and just that the thumbnail but I guess that's not a thing that YouTube does woo wow this is super helpful to the four oh look why all these people make these nice animations and like that's just not me I'm gonna have to draw on the whiteboard okay include the spaceman yeah fill the cube for fun oh hello Denmark random numbers good and Todd good evening everybody alright so I think I'm ready to go to get going nobody can help me with this huh how can I make this show I turned off autoplay speed normal annotations quality how I want to show this page with the thumbnail nobody nobody will tell nobody will help me because it must not be possible I just know I've gotten to I have my expectations are too high I just think I can mention something the chat will tell me how to do it as my own personal technical support I need to be my own technical support I need to learn new things like visualizing a 4d tesseract okay so that's fine I'm just gonna find I'm going to do what I said I was gonna do before which is find a nice there we go a nice screen shot there we go hi be like why is fortnight recommended for you oh I am in one of my alternative universe YouTube accounts that my children use but what I'm trying to do by watching my educational videos in there is is embed embed the recommendation engine with some new stuff for them to watch ya autoplay is autoplaying the next video it's fine it's fine everything's good but let me let me login as myself which I'm always afraid to do but I think this is going to be better it ruined me it really knows that I like Tessa rocks okay so I'm gonna move here this is pretty good come on okay that's good that's good okay yes that's the image correct all right that's a very good me I'm Studios making an interesting solution I think I'm gonna live with this being visible can't resist I can't resist that suggestion hold on let me at least copy video URL to current time I mean I just can't resist this suggestion nope alright this is gonna do just fine tesseract okay and I have my code so this is minimize this is minimized this is up and running then I have my code so far okay too many nines indeed all right we're gonna get started I'm gonna get started let me cycle the cameras okay okay here we go where's the train whistle my lucky train whistle where did it go ah there this Oh welcome to a coding challenge where I will enter the fourth dimension well I don't really time I expected some dramatic moment to happen with the music there which didn't happen but all right so this is a coding challenge I'm so crazily excited about this if this actually works I think that I don't know what's gonna happen stuff just like smoke and brain matter will start just like leaking out of my nostrils I don't even know wait till the end of this video to see now what I'm starting with here looks like a plain old spinning cube and actually that's what it is what I want to do is not just make a plain old spinning cube in three dimensions I want to make a hypercube spinning in the fourth dimension so I want to make something that looks like this alright so this is a hypercube otherwise known as a tesseract and I'm gonna before I start coding any of this I'm gonna explain to you what that is exactly so let me come over here so I I think my favorite dimension is one dimension oh no zero let's pick let's start with zero dimensions a point is a shape that exists in zero D that's a zero now a line which is bound by two points is something that exists in one dimensional space this is one dimensional space a rectangle a square a plane which is bound by one two three four lines exists in twodimensional space now notice a pattern here this is bound by two lines this is bound by four I'm sorry this is bound by two points this is bound by four lines now if I create two planes and then connect all the edges I have what is commonly referred to as a cube this is something that exists in three dimensions are that the number of dimensions that we live in on this planet where we live and it is bound by six planes so you can see a pattern here I was gonna say you double it but this is not bound by anything I guess so that sort of makes sense this is bound by zero things this is the beginning now what does it mean then to have four dimensions well I'm not really gonna be able to draw this too easily but we could make the case right if I'm following this pattern that four dimensions is bound by eight cubes and this is mathematically true this is accurate the problem is I'm gonna sit here I'm gonna visualize this in my head are you doing this with me I cannot do it at all human beings are not we did not evolve to understand the world in any dimensions higher than three there's a there's a there's any way I can keep going on about this but since this is a mathematical truth why isn't there a way that we could somehow unlock it and see this on a computer screen in some way and in fact there is so this is how how do we even see this how do we even see this 3d shape on a 2d computer screen well the way we do that is by writing code like this one that I've done right here now the truth of the matter is in processing which is the programming language environment I'm using right now I could just say box and I would get that because I'm in the P 3d render and the P 3d render knows how to take the mathematics of a 3d shape and project it into a 2d canvas to create the illusion of the third dimension and it totally makes sense to our brain because we're so used to 3d we can imagine we can see the 2d version of it and imagine it in three dimensions so and I did a a a you don't have to have watch that video to watch this one I did a whole previous coding challenge where I made exactly this but only using the P 2d renderer so I did the math of taking 3d points and projecting them into 2d so if I can do that why can't I take create the math for a 4d shape do the projection into 3d and render it with the P 3d render truth of the matter is I could then project it into 2d and render it with the P 2d renderer too but I'm lazy I'm just gonna do one projection and if this is true there's no reason why I couldn't create a 5d shape and a 60 shape and a 70 shape and I project 17 to 16 and divide D into 40 and then into 3d and visualize it so this is what I'm going to attempt to do in this video it is going to require matrices there are ways to do it without it or to create the visual illusion of it but I'm going to be using matrices and the matrices are going to be used for a couple things I need a projection matrix this is a matrix that takes a 4d point and turns it into a 3d point and I'm going to also need a rotation matrix I don't need the rotation matrix but the rotation matrix is what's gonna make this fun because I can start to rotate around weird axes to see crazy things happen so this is good this is kind of like optional but this is what's gonna make the visualization here so I'm gonna do the most basic wireframe version of this and hopefully you are then going to make beautiful interesting weird things about this it's somebody watching this lets who can go to the highest dimension possible in processing I would like to see that as a challenge only one thing I forgot to mention I really should have mentioned it at the top of this video but and I could record a new introduction once I have it finished mmhmm I guess I could just reference it now is fine okay okay nothing nobody's complained yet anywhere I'm getting a youtube notification that the ukulele channels that I watch as a new video out oh sorry I'm just gonna go and learn to play the song with ukulele okay if you are getting a ukulele notification right now that means we watch the same ukulele channel alright so I think it's probably fine for me to just reference this video now I meant to reference this at the top but that's fine so let me come back alright now if you want to learn more or CS sort of like condensed version of the explanation of what the tesseract is and how this works I would highly recommend this for me that's I'm making this coding challenge because of this particular video from how do you pronounce that anybody know how you say this what's the chance let me that's the chance that hold on lay OS o at layoffs OS I supremum Leo's Leos OS yes Leo's OS okay hello a rom well I lost the channel I'm in the wrong place lay Oz OS lay Oz OS lay Oz OS is that correct Alka why am i recording this again don't you have no the time just disappear just do the same thing over and over and over again lay Oz OS alright alka is typing oh I'm just guessing Oh may i oh yes all right Leo's OS all right I just have to guess I actually just messaged him to ask how to pronounce is gentle but I don't think I ever reply yet okay Leo's OS okay Leah Leah Leo's all right all right all right all right all right I've got to move on okay that's Tim Tim that's very funny Tim right there Android OS okay okay okay figure out how to pronounce it I'm gonna guess lay offs OS but there's a wonderful wonderful YouTube channel with many excellent explanatory videos and this one about understanding 40 the tesseract is excellent so you can pause this go watch that come back later all the above okay alright so now I think we're good we're good I minimize the browser and here I am okay all right now ah what do I need the first thing I need to do if I'm going to make something 4d to do something in 3d I make heavy use of this idea of a P vector which is a data structure that holds an X Y and a Z I need something that could hold an X Y to Z and W for that fourth dimension so I'm gonna make a new tab and I'm gonna call it P for vector and I'm gonna say class P P for vector and I'm going to say it has an X Y Z and W and it needs a constructor and it can get an X a Y as E and a W and then I'm gonna say X equal this dot X this is it fun when you have to use the Vista in Java cuz it's like so rare and then every once in a while you do Z W X Y Z W so now this is my P fourvector all right P for vector there we go and now I am going to make this cube this very cube all the points of the cube and actually one thing I want to do just just I'll leave it right now I'm gonna make it in 4000 0 0 the fourth dimension and then while I'm adding the fourth dimension I got to change these P for vector okay then I've got to change this P for vector P for vector P for vector and now okay this stuff I'm going to worry about later and let's see we're gonna watch it's gonna be four dimensions now everybody here comes four dimensions look away oh oh so this is the same exact cube right it's the same is that four dimensions oh I'm so confused huh well how are you gonna see this fourth dimensional first of all I all the points are on zero so what you can think about it is it's flat I took a four dimensional shape and flattened it flattened it you know we say flat cuz usually taking a three dimensional shape and flattening it into 2d so a cube if you flatten it would just be a square so I took this hypercube and flattened it and I just have the cube so I need to make the hypercube okay what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make mmm all right oh boy oh boy you know what I'm gonna guess my better judgment I'm just gonna extend this array to have 16 points right a hypercube is made up of 16 vertices because it's basically two cubes with all the points connected so I am going to I was gonna make like a cube object and hypercube is two cubes but I'm gonna just keep going so I'm gonna say 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and then I'm actually going to put this in 4d so all of these zeros right these should all be 100 these should all be 100 and then I'm gonna put the rest of them at negative 1 ER I know I'm doing this highly in a highly manual way but first of all I find it kind of relaxing sometimes just a CEREC copypaste the same thing over and over again you should try it it's very soothing and then also I can always refactor it later but just to like really know that it's working okay so I've got 16 fourdimensional points I am going to now draw again okay so it just looks like those points what's missing here well I'm not actually doing the projection so now it's time for me like I'm just taking the 4d point ignoring that VW part and then doing a projection so really what I need to do right now is think about how I do the projection so we have this idea of a projection matrix now I'm not going to go too much into detail of this you can watch my previous video where I made the 3d projected into 2d but basically the idea here is that if I have a four dimensional point X Y and I'm drawing that way too high did the camera get lower at some point like I don't know I'll leave the camera there cuz probably did i just mess up the focus just good I have I'm gonna try out what I was saying now I'm gonna create a projection matrix for a 4d point so this is the point x y wz the projection matrix to take a 4d point and turn it into a weight X Y Z W and project it into something that I can draw into 3d X Y Z the idea is like I want to look at the shadow of the 4d object in 3d just like I might look at the shadow of a 3d object in 2d so to do that I need a matrix that has four columns and 3 rows so the typical way to do that would be like this Z 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 I think I got everything the idea here if I actually use this matrix and perform matrix multiplication which link to two videos where I go through that or detail this actually gives me literally this it's like just chopping off the W so let's actually put this in our code and see what happens so I'm going to create up sudden okay so I'm gonna create a matrix now one thing I didn't mention is I'm working with a help set of helper functions and I work these functions out as a separate video if you're interested but it's not too much to wait too much to be in this video that has actually the matrix multiplication math in it as well as some helper stuff to do matrix multiplication with the matrix and a vector I'm gonna have to change this to P for vector I'm just realizing that but that's no problem okay so what I first want to do is create that projection matrix so I'm gonna I'm gonna do it I'm just gonna do it right here as a local variable and it'll make it a little bit later will sort of make sense why so I'm gonna say afloat projection equals so I need to make that matrix which is or an array of arrays so there are three rows 0 1 0 0 and then 0 1 0 0 1 0 this is the equivalent of orthographic projection if you've heard that term before okay so now we've done that then what I'm gonna say is P for vector P for actually P vector I don't need it to be a P for vector I'm taking the 3d point P vector projected equals matrix multiplication the projection times V okay so now it's telling me it doesn't know how to do matrix multiplication with a projection matrix and V which is a P for vector which is strange because if I go in here it as a function with a two matrix multiply a two dimensional array and a P vector but I need this to be a vector matrix ah doesn't know how to make a P for vector so I'm just going to change these functions to two to deal with 3d 4d sorry m3 equals B W so again if you want to see where I have a separate video where I wrote all this code and now I'm just adjusting it to add this fourth dimension and then matrix to Veck and us matrix to Veck is going to be yeah you know what I'm gonna always be doing this you know this is fine this stays the same so that stays the same because I still want what I'm gonna get is a 3d vector inside a matrix I don't want to turn into a P vector so let's see so nobody's complaining at me and and now I want to look at the projected points projected projected projected here we go oh what's wrong here vector matrix array index out of bounds exception where I have an error somewhere where is this called here oh this has to be a four this has to be a four so I forget that I'm in Java and I really have to specify types and lengths of things so that has to be a four is there anywhere else where I need to do that we'll find out soon enough okay let's try this one more time we're entering the fourth dimension why there are eight points in four dimensions well guess what if I took a cube and I showed it to you an orthographic projection facing the camera basically it would look like just four points the four points on the back of the cube would be sitting right exactly behind the four points of the front and you wouldn't see that as different same thing is going on here so what I actually need is not orthographic projection I need stereographic projection I need to create that perspective and the way to do that is with moving a sort of thinking of a light source that has a certain distance from the object that I'm casting a shadow so I'm going to create a variable did since and this is going to be you know one thing I really should do is I'm gonna take all these 100's and make them just the number one so I'm going to normalize my shape to just have all ones this looks like a completely insane person wrote this code and in fact a completely insane person did write that code so that way so I'm gonna think of the camera as to give sort of units away and then the projection W is one divided by that distance minus V V dot W this is a sort of triedandtrue formula for creating perspective projection and then I can put that W in here and now let's see what happens oh I'm so close I'm so close so I forgot that all my numbers are 1 so I'm just gonna scale there's so far i two ways i could scale things up but i'm just gonna do it right here so i multiply by 100 and now what kind of looks like sort of looks like that tesseract thing wait a second wait a second wait a second wait a second wait a sec oh this is crazy oh I gotta connect the lines so first of all I need more I guess I should make this smaller let's make this 50 do you see it that's that tesseract looking thing the fourth event so what kind of what is uh so if brains can't do this I'm connecting it will help I'm gonna connect all the lines let's do that so I'm gonna so I had a function that connects all the edges I think I did this in the video where I was just making a cube and these are p4 vectors now or no they're not they're still P vectors and so but I need to connect the oh I need to make all right I really everything's gonna be ok everybody I'm gonna make an array P vector projected projected 3d which is an array is a new P vector also with 16 points in it and I'm just gonna take projected 3d index I there's no index I'm gonna add an index cuz I'm not amusing this enhanced loop I probably should just make it a four loop let's make it a four loop I got time to do that you'll watch me do this for int I equals zero I is less than point length I plus plus and then P for vector V equals points index I so I'm manually iterating through it because now I can have this index and then with this index here I can say I equals that projected V projected and then I can I could still draw these here but now I can say projected 3d so I want to connect the various points there and so now I should see oh that's just one oh right because I got to do this twice oh no I got to do this all the way oh this is confusing I got to use the second half of the array which would be from like 8 to 12 I don't know oh I equals 8 that's not right 7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0 4 because if I want all the Obagi lists oh modulus 4 plus 8 oh I'm really I've made a I made a horror show out of this ok I went out of bounds stop the presses I have to I have to rethink this before I do the connection stuff is like I should do that from scratch let me take the connection stuff out I think that's gonna be way too confusing mmm and I can go back although let me just go back here so this worked right if I just had to separate I should just make two separate arrays turn anything what's the best way to explain this oh I just had one off okay okay let me stop here let me go from here okay I now realized that I'd not to do this I try to have my videos to be very selfcontained and there's a you know there's a few things that you might have to watch a previous video for but it's worth explaining this just for a second so basically what I did in this connect function is this is a connect function to just take two of the points and draw a line between them and to draw a cube right normally I might just say box or begin shape and shape and it's gonna sort of like make all these connections for me but what I'm doing what I'm doing is I basically have points 0 1 2 3 4 5 actually it's 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 so that function is basically saying connect 0 and 1 connect 1 and to connect 2 & 3 connects 3 and 0 connect 4 & 5 connect 5 & 6 connect 6 & 7 connect 7 & 4 and then connect 0 & 4 1 & 5 2 & 6 3 & 7 that's what that function is doing and so now I have two of them if I have another one basically you know it's it's along the fourdimensional axis I don't even know where to draw that so first of all all of its points start at eight nine ten eleven twelve and this is not one somebody watching this will give me a some nice adjust about a completely refactor this in a better way but you can see now I just need to connect these so well the way that I think I'm gonna approach that is by I'm gonna add another I think if I just add like an offset like I can add an offset this is kind of silly here and then that offset could be 0 and then that offset could be could be 7 right because then I just want to do this and so this would just be I plus offset J plus offset so if I do this twice and again I could do this in one loop right I could add an offset that's 8 is it 8 I think it's eight there we go so now you can see I've connected both cubes so now interestingly enough where what's the fourth dimension with this kind of perspective the fourth dimension is actually like is w W is expressed as kind of a distance between these cubes I mean again we can only think about it I can only describe it to you in three dimensional terms so for example you see this here like if I were to put one of these points like at negative 5 look it's all the way out there so this hypercube isn't perfectly symmetrical one of the points it's W location is all the way out along that axis and I could make that it's a variable and I could slide it around and do stuff like that but I'm not going to do that what I want to do next so one thing is I really want to make all the connections so the nice thing is the lat hook I'm trippin I really want to make all the connections so the nice thing is the last set of connections is pretty easy whoops ah a William Wester says I've never once seen a good tesseract representation everyone gets the occlusion wrong am I getting the occlusion wrong so I'm just doing whatever else does oh boy everybody's giving me suggestions okay okay all right okay all right I really want I threw out what I was I'm gonna try to back up even though that's probably unnecessary all right what I really want to do is I want to I want to see all the connections it's gonna be I want the the edges of one bounding cube need to be connected to the other bound like you've they're not really bound to get oh it's so confusing I want all right I haven't actually finished the connections though because what I want here is I need to connect all these points to those points for the visualization to be fully complete that's actually gonna be pretty easy because all I'm doing it my array of 16 points zero connect to eight one connect to nine four connect to twelve five connect to three so that's actually easy that's just a another loop all the way through all the points and I'm gonna have with an offset of zero I connected to I plus eight so this should do that last set of connections whoops no something's wrong here oh no no only I need to go through half the points cuz the first half of connect to the second one all right is this right this looks right to me oh why is it going towards the center something is wrong here okay something is wrong let me think about this I goes to I plus eight and I do them in the same order pretty sure that I did this is the problem you do things manually what's wrong something is wrong here let's take out these connections and these connections maybe that'll help us see it yeah what's wrong here anybody have any idea you connected 0 to 13 to 212 0 to 8 1 to 9 opposite vertices oh oh yeah yeah loop through every vertex and calculate distance to the other vertices and connect the ones with distance of 1 oh that's it oh that's really smart oh that's really smart what an awesome idea I'm connecting the furthest corner so what is it is it like like 16 I or something plus 1 no no minus 1 I mean which will be 15 no whoo that's not right that's closer all right let's just let's figure out so zero let's connect from so 0 to 8 is there oh yeah so that should be 0 to 4 no no not 0 to 4 that's 0 to 12 0 to 6 to 15 is that right no 0 to 11 I'm guessing vertices oh my god I'm losing my mind you see your zero connects to that one which is which one is it robear can you see my solutions use the nearest neighbor idea it's really a cool idea 16 minus I minus 2 15 minus I 0 to 13 everyone's giving me excellent suggestions draw index as text on vertices that's such a cool idea all right let's try that text I always get stuck with these little things all right okay hold on let's not draw the points or Elbe let's do rotate you billboard them whoops okis oops that's the rotations in the wrong place sorry there we go okay and let me make the text size and fill 255 I can make it bigger okay all right so this I'm gonna match here this will be a part where I'll come back into the video yeah at some point it'll get cut and I'll come back to here because I think this is a good because I can see it's eight two six nine two seven ten to four fourteen to zero I mean I could just do the distance of one thing which kind of makes sense but yeah zero to fourteen 115 five to eleven yeah it's a weird it's like a weird formula alright okay so I was debugging that for a little while and I was making me crazy and so someone in the chat suggests to just draw the points as numbers so you can see I did this here I actually added a little code to draw the index I um and so now I can look at this and I can see okay zero should be connected to 14 1 to 15 5 to 11 4 to 10 3 to 13 2 to 12 but there's definitely a pattern there but but but but I think actually a nut someone else in the chat I wish I could remember the chat scrolling back so fast the name suggested you you know what you just want to connect every vertices every vertex that has a distance of 1 so actually this is a great idea I can actually eliminate this entire nonsense loop basically and I'm gonna I'm gonna do that let's try that right so what I'm gonna say is for every I'm gonna I'm gonna do it a nested loop for every I equals 0 I is less than points at length I plus plus then I'm gonna start with I plus 1 because I don't need to check a point against itself J is less than point points dot length J plus plus now what I need to do is calculate the distance between those points so I'm going to say float distance equal distance for D between and let's just put those in P for vector a equals P for vector a equals points index I P for vector B equals points index B so I am now going to calculate the distance for D between a and B oh guess what there's no distance for D function I will make one I'm gonna put it here on my helper function page I'm gonna say float distance for D I get a P for vector P for P for vector a this actually would make more sense on the P for vector tab so let's write this here and I could obviously make it a function that's a part of the class but P for vector B and so now what I need to do is I need to do D X equals ax minus B X dy equals a dot y minus B dot y I'm going to do this pretty manually just the difference between all the dimensions that's a W this is just Euclidean distance but in four dimensions then I need to say return the square root of DX times DX plus dy times dy plus DZ times DZ and you know forget the fact that this is kind of inefficient there's probably ways I could optimize this it's gonna work so now if if if T equals one then connect and this function is so silly I don't need the offset anymore shouldn't need that offset then connect I I and J points and these are not points these are not the points at all these are the projected 3d ones oh wait a second no no I want the distance between the points huh and then but I I'm checking the distance between those points but I'm connecting the corresponding ones in the projected 3d array so this is the BP fourvector no no this is pvector oh it's so confusing points J project dead 3d okay right I'm looking at the piece the 4d values seeing their distance then connecting the corresponding ones let's see Hey look it's all numbers uh hold on a sec everybody I must have made a mistake somewhere so let me let me get rid of all this let me put this back to just the points I want to believe that it's gonna work okay so the points are there I'm not seeing any of the cannot seeing any of the connections yes I can pre calculate the connections in setup that is a very good point let's see what kind of distance values am I getting is it doing some sort of rounding thing where it's not actually equal to one okay so first of all I think I meant to say two distances too because I they're actually like the the distance is two because I'm from the center the each along each axis I'm extruding by one both directions the distance is two not one there we go because I'm drawing them flipped yeah I didn't work who's gonna get this whole swabs are gonna get edited out and I guess I could just manually do the what why I was really thinking it would be so easy to connect our negative and inverted row bears like said there's like 15 times the brothers this chat scrolls by very fast so unless I could capture somebody can capture something and put it into the smaller slack channel because I can't catch it so they're inverted I'm gonna try to scroll back its 32 edges so it should be like the opposite one I should just made it 2 and I need to look at the projection the projection point you're using is making the negative ones get projected to the opposite side of the zero point so could I actually change that in the projection like you know some weird thing like this or something yeah I can scroll that's a good point just go back to the old message using 16 minus I minus 2 and 3 perhaps the points are value are correct what they're represented rotated okay I'm gonna try to figure this out myself all right that was a nice digression and was interesting to solve but didn't actually do anything let me just comment this out for right now wait I need my connections back I need my connections back I deleted them I was so confident so hold on let me put this somewhere else just to save this this was a digression that I maybe I'm gonna go back track and I'm gonna go back stop I'm gonna go back to where I just had the numbers let's see how far processing will let me undo not very far huh okay all right I'm back to this so okay let me just allow myself to control this completely I'm gonna write these down isn't the distance between connection from between all zero for two every time somebody will figure this out somebody much smarter than me we'll figure this out I look forward to that day okay let's see I'm going all the way back to where I was just explaining about the text so you can just cut out huge amounts of stuff hi oh it's a weird edit point probably cuz I mean like I just spent and if you want to watch I'll link to the live stream where I just probably spent like a half an hour trying to figure out a pattern here and I'm sure there is one and somebody watching this video will come up with one but what I did to debug this I think I'll make our lives a little easier is first I just decided to write instead of drawing points for all those points I'm just drawing the index value of the array using the text function and translate into that projected location and then I also just made the angle the mouse X so I could control this so I can actually write this down I'm gonna get a piece of paper or I could put it as notes in my code but I feel like a piece of paper would really be just like an exciting moment here on the coding train but I have like a whiteboard or something to write this stuff down okay so now let's look at this nine connects to seven ten connects to four I should really start with one or zero where zero let's let's go and order zero connects to 14 that makes sense one connects to 15 that makes sense where's that 11 no no that's one two connects to 12 the pattern is going to come up I expect three connects to 13 for connects to 10 then we could speed this up I guess this part up connects five connects to eleven five goes to 11 six connects to eight and seven connects to what's the only one left should be nine right nine okay guess what here's a way to write this code now guess what to do connect zero I still need that offset thing right zero 0 14 projected 3d oh this is lovely oh this is so beautiful this code 0 14 115 212 yes I'm doing this 3/3 I'm not looking at the chat I don't want it I don't want it I don't want to hear it you don't want to hear it 6 8 I'm starting to see the pattern is coming into my head 7 9 and now this looks good this looks good let's put those points back in let's take out this text I'm gonna leave that in there just like comment it in the code and let's put this back in I'm gonna just let it rotate automatically now and we are entering the fourth dimension okay we're finally ready for something exciting sort of alright so what's what's the deal here no look at this how am i rotating that how the shape is spinning in 3d I want to do 4d rotations 4d rotations so this is now the moment we're going to start to get something pretty interesting visually going on where I now want to create not a projection matrix but a rotation matrix so here's the thing in 2d a 2d I I want to draw up here but I don't think you can see it I'm gonna draw it here if we go and and I'm gonna go to a Wikipedia page rotation matrix we're gonna see that a rotation matrix looks something like this and I'm gonna write this down duplicate this over here because we're gonna want to memorize this it's cosine of the angle a negative sine of the angle and then I already forgot it's sine of the angle cosine in a way of course and if we were to take this rotation matrix and multiply it by an XY point this is basically doing regular plane rotation in twodimensional space based on an angle and that's what happens when you've just in P 2d you just call rotate it's applying a rotation matrix like this so if I scroll down further onto this page we can start to see oh look at this wrote I mean it's going on look at this these are like 3d rotations around the xaxis we put a 1 in the first spot and then we have that sort of like four rotation values in the bottom right because it is rotating around the x axis using the y and z axes this is rotating around the y axis using the using the x and z so this is the idea that I need to extrapolate to four dimensions so now if I want to rotate in four dimensions I would just put cosine theta negative sine theta zero zero sine theta cosine theta 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 this is the idea this is now a rotation matrix that will rotate you can see well rotate around the X using the XY axes x and y no Z no W so this should look sort of familiar to us if we apply this in the code so let's go to the code and I'm going to this is this is the important part right this is where I'm doing the projection now I want to rotate before I project so I'm going to create a p4 vector oh boy we're gonna need some more vector math stuff rotated equals matrix multiplication a rotation matrix times V and my rotation matrix I'm gonna copy paste this and I'm gonna make a rotation matrix it's going to have a cosine of the angle negative sine of the angle sine of the angle cosine of the angle a 1 and then a 1 this is I'm sticking with 4 dimensions here right so this should give me a 4d point out of it I'm just rotating that 4d point according to the XY axis all right the problem is my nice beautiful mat mol function doesn't know how to we stop for a second I can't overload this I want this to be matrix to Veck for the rejection is missing the brackets and it makes me sad the 4th rotation is wrong okay all right hold on I'm to work out the matrix multiplication but everybody's blaring at me that I have mistakes in my code separate from that so let's fix those this is wrong thank you this needs to be a zero and then in the projection something is wrong in the projection your projection is missing the brackets and it made me sad where where yeah zero zero zero zero zero zero one all right I fixed that zero zero one thing you guys are so far behind me in time me I am so Mia's typing W equals 1 divided by distance oh that's been wrong all along parentheses we call those parentheses for 45 point I just fixed this mistake and then I was like sitting here and I think this is like a major error I don't know how it happened to work that those parentheses need to be there this formula has been wrong for a very long time in this video it's fixed now let me for a second then just get rid of the rotation and just make sure everything still looks kind of normal ish okay that's what was messing up those connections could that really be true I'll have to go way back in time is interesting that digression though to like debug it in that way it was useful don't mind me I'm just over here checking something just ignore me just over here checking something [Laughter] if I could turn back okay okay this is a good thing because the actual finished version of this video there was a point so here's the thing in fear I'm gonna you know I'm gonna just go back I'm gonna take this out is we're nice interesting digressions I hate to lose them but I'm losing them I'm gonna put this mistake back in so this is actually this is the point I need to go back to oh do the to distance thing so now I could do the to distance thing this is actually the point I can go back to don't go back I'm not going back really I'm just gonna excise all that out of the final edited version of this coding challenge which would be sad I guess and I could do the nearest neighbors yes I know I could do the nearest neighbor stuff I will mention that oh oh boy all right oh hell oh no not I can do the Olo thing that's too much of a cliche we're gonna do this this will work well okay so that was like a very abrupt edit I will link to the live stream where I am currently right now live doing this coding challenge you just I've just probably edited out about 45 minutes of doing all sorts of crazy debugging I was doing some stuff I was putting numbers where they were trying to figure out the connections and there was actually just a bug which you may have already noticed and been typing in the comments or shouting at me or maybe just singing it to me in a lovely friendly way this was a mistake this here this formula for doing the aah this here this formula for doing the perspective projection needs to have parentheses here because I'm saying 1 divided by the distance from the camera minus the actual W point not 1 divided by distance the W point that's the actual formula you can go watch that any other material about the that you'll find that formula ok so now if I do that now this looks like I expected it to look like and in fact up during that time I also tried a different solution which I would recommend doing as an exercise to yourself one thing that was pointed out by the chat whoops let me just oh nice I was afk for 45 minutes you know what since the camera went off and I all tabbed into this page that I didn't mean to alt tab into one more one once more with feeling once more with feeling okay so abrupt edit you're watching if you're watching this not watching this live you're watching a recorded version just spent about 45 minutes trying to debug a problem when I went off completely in the wrong direction well it was a really interesting that's interesting tangents like courage I'll link to the time code of the livestream where you either watch that whole part but I was trying to figure out why these points aren't connecting properly and I started doing things like drawing numbers where all the points were and also stuff but actually the mistake which you may have already seen and been singing to me about it perhaps um is right here there needs to be parentheses here the formula for the perspective projection requires one minus one divided by the distance minus the actual W point as soon as I put that in now all of the points are in the right place and those connections are doing what they should do I though the actual drawn points are a little bit too large for my taste right now I'm gonna take this to eight and this looks better now okay so there we can see there's our hypercube in 3d sort of okay gonna take a deep breath here cuz there's a lot of stuff and I got to figure out where I am Oh oh yes rotation okay pause for a second nurse somebody actually sponsored this Thank You Alec bear off so here's the thing oh yeah so okay before I get to rotation actually let me just mention one more thing about this it was pointed out in the chat by many people that instead of like trying to write some kind of kooky nonsensical crazy person algorithm like I did here to figure out where all the connections are that you could actually just test for unit distance between the points right because you think about a square right you don't connect the diagonals because they're not distance they'd have a different distance so if I look at the distance between all the points I'll find all the connections there so that's an interesting side project for any of you as an exercise to do while you're watching this but I want to talk about rotation now while I was debugging I can't talk about it again so there's some stuff the white porcupine ever go race it pause oh this cameras off so I think I have to do the rotation explanation again because I don't see any other way of approaching it there's now that I have it fixed I mean we could edit out of order time sequence wise but this is gonna be a big project good thing I'm going away by the way I'm going away for like three weeks but still have a lot of time to edit this I also could just start over and do it again but I think this this coding challenge so what was in here before it was just the it was just the yeah it was the projection matrix okay great okay okay here we are alright so how is this even rotating in the first place how is it rotating in the first place tonight so I like that thing where I move to point out yeah it made sense okay I think that's in there sorry all right okay so how is this rotation even happening in the first place I'm rotating in the third dimension which is not really what I want to do I want to rotate in the fourth dimension then project that down to the third dimension so let's let's try to back up let's try to create exactly this by rotating in the fourth dimension and then projecting back down to the third dimension the reason why I'm not actually doing the rotation in the fourth dimension is because the rotation is happening right here with the builtin native rotate Y function that means rotating around the y axis so how does rotation actually happen well rotation happens with a rotation matrix so here I am on the wikipedia page and you can see this rotation matrix right here so let's come back over here and let's think about that so this is a rotation matrix cosine of theta negative sine of the sine of theta cosine of theta did I get that right looks like I did alright so this is a 2d rotation matrix if I were to take this rotation matrix and do matrix multiplication with any given 2d point this is exactly the math behind rotate in processing bike data this is exactly that so then what is the math behind rotate Y or rotate X or rotate Z and in fact it is indeed also a rotation matrix only it's 3x3 rotation matrix and in fact if I come over here on this Wikipedia page about rotation matrices and keep scrolling keep scrolling and keep scrolling and scrolling there we go here it is this is the rotation matrix for around the y axis and you can see a pattern here right that's that 2d rotation but it's here within the y&z which is rotating on the x axis same pattern but between the X and the Z between the X and the y that's how I get all those different rotations but I want to do this in four dimensions so what I need to do rotation in four dimensions is the following I need to pick which axes I want and I need a four by four matrix and in this case the axes that I want I'm going to use the x and y axes and I'm gonna say cosine theta negative sine theta sine theta cosine theta so this is o and this has to be a 1 apologies and this has to be a 1 right because it's the identity matrix for y&z basically the identity being heard just a 1 in those in those areas so I don't know if that's actually the right way to phrase it back away so this is the rotation matrix I'm going to call this 4 4 D this is rotation X Y so let's and actually what I was doing rotate Y would be XZ but anyway let's come back and now try to add that in so what I'm going to do now go back to my code I'm gonna comment out the rotate Y and instead oh look it's already in there take that out so I forgot I did this earlier hold on I'm gonna go back to my code and I'm gonna comment out this rotate Y so now there is no rotation for free from processing I'm just seeing the hypercube the 4d hypercube projected into 3d I am going to create whoops this just shouldn't be here what I was feeling okay come back to the computer I'm going to comment out rotate Y so now there's no rotation and actually I'm going to start with just to be clear I'm gonna start with rotate X no rotate Z I think that'll be the simplest so I'm gonna start with rotate Z so I'm gonna recreate exactly this this doesn't look super interesting because of how flat it is but I'm that's what I'm gonna start with so let me because I think that'll be the easiest one to do I want to recreate that with a matrix so the first thing I have to do is before I do the projection I have to create a rotation matrix and I'm going to call this XY rotation and that is going to equal a matrix that has I forgot already cosine of the angle negative sine of the angle 0 0 sine of the angle cosine of the angle 0 0 and then 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 so this is my rotation X Y matrix autoformat there we go rotation X Y matrix now I want to say you know what I can do here actually so I'm thinking I'm thinking Oh layoffs OS Thank You Laelius OS is in the chat eyes right mispronounced earn the name of your channel earlier apologies for that then we could dub that in or if I end up doing another intro to this ok ok so now what I need to do is I need to say P for vector right I want to get a rotated point which is the rotation which is the matrix multiplication result of the rotation matrix XY with V that point V now this is telling me it doesn't know how to do this so I have member I have all those helper functions the helper functions do these matrix multiplication operations well I do have a helper function that does alright does look at this it does I was like oh look it does this a matrix times a p4 vector I have that but look at it it returns a P vector because I have the one to give me a 3 3 P vector back I should probably just leave everything as p4 vectors would make our life so much easier there's not really any reason for me to use P vector at this point because I can always but I'm gonna iii've done what I've done I mean we can think about refactoring it later which is like a little bit of my mantra and I'm going to say this still works so I want to say if so this is matrix Tyvek I need another one of these which does I'm just gonna write this function I don't think I need this anymore because it's always gonna have three dimensions that was sort of an extra thing just to simplify this I'm gonna make another function that's going to be called matrix to Veck 4 and I make a pee 4 vector and then I'm gonna say V dot W is this so I made a different function and this returns a p4 vector P 4 vector so I just made a helper function that takes 8 oh I don't have that up 0 0 0 0 that basically takes a takes a matrix that has one column right this is what it is it's a matrix with one column in four rows and turns this into a p4 vector I need that because down here I now want to say I'm gonna say result equals mat mole a and M and then I'm going to say if result dot length so how many rows do I have four rows are not equals four then return oh no wait I can't return two different types I just have to do this ah Java is a weird place right I can't return something of a different type so I'm gonna just pass a boolean in I'm gonna pass I'm gonna pass our dimensions like int dim so I don't even need to figure it out if dimensions equal 4 oh no it's the same problem oh oh I can oh no I could just overload it all right I'm gonna overload sorry everybody so this is sorry for this digressions making this video extra long this is what it was before right returning a a matrix to Veck oh no return sorry sorry everybody this there this is what it was before now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to just this is very awkward but I'm gonna add I'm gonna say a boolean or forth this is sort of silly and now I'm just gonna say matrix Tyvek 4 and it returns a P 4 vector ok so I made two versions of this function this is very silly I should just made it but but it is what it is ok can we get back to what we were doing which was important so now I'm gonna say Matt mole rotation X Y true so this should return a 4d vector then now I want to get the W of the rotated vector right because I'm about to calculate the projection matrix I don't want to use the original point I want to use the point that's been calculated after the rotation and now we should see no wait sine of angle angle hmm P for vector what did I do wrong aha I projected V again so this down here needs to be rotated also there we go I have now created exactly zero tation with my own rotation matrix oh we're getting really close everybody this is very exciting so now now I have a rotation XY just to prove a point let's do rotation what was the one we saw with it's spinning like this let's do rotation X Z meaning a zero goes here meaning a one goes here the zero goes here this is how I like now let's look at this is this right I think this is rotation with X and Z 1 in the Y and 1 in the W so let's now change that to XZ here and look there we go I have it just rotating around what looks like the y axis okay what if I want to apply more than one rotation so here I've rotated by XZ now I can just rotate again by rotating by X Y what's wrong here multiply rotation X Y by rotated true oh so I don't want to read eclair the variable and here we go now we see both rotation okay but everything still feels very much like all I did was make two 3d cubes and connect the corners so that's what you're seeing right because that's the shadow of what the four dimensional shape in our only way our brains can process 3d but let's really try to stretch our brains for a second what if I include this is really where things are gonna go nuts what if I include the W axis what does it mean to rotate around the W axis think about that for a second okay rotate around the Y rotate around the X right eight around the z move can't even that W axis that was kind of like extruder who knows what that's even gonna be let's see what that looks like we are now really about to enter the fourth dimension okay let's try what do I want XW I don't know what's a good one to start with let's try X W so I'm gonna make a rotation matrix X W okay here we go so X then a zero goes here then that stays the same then this should be in the bottom and a zero goes here get rid of this comma get rid of this zero and then the one goes here so let's actually just for I'm afraid to add too many rotations so X Z let's do X W and then let's comment these out so I am only using rotation around the X W access this isn't right something is wrong there did something interesting though all right what's it that oh you know what most people do I think actually is uh not ZW so let's do the W let's put this here and then these go away I mean I just want to see that I'm doing this correctly and then this would be 1 0 0 1 so let's try ZW let's see what this does okay this is actually correct now it looks really weird but I think I think I'm gonna be able to fix this I'm just gonna do something really quickly just as a test I just wanna like rotate it on its side mmm I'm gonna be this side no something is still wrong I've done something wrong all right I'm looking at the chat why do I be rotated a bit around yeah I've done something wrong cosine negative sine sine cosine rotation ZW you know I just this really shouldn't matter but I just want to check something real quick oh boy I just changed every number 1 that was a bad idea don't do that hold on I just broke too many things cuz if I'm worried about that I could just make this this what have I done wrong projection yes so let me let me do what what is typically seen would be this now it's not right though it's interesting unless I actually and don't like to take this off now something is off let me look at this other example I made the other day I'm not sure about my virtus I'm not sure about anything who asking are you sure about rotate X negative PI over 2 oh I just was looking at it from the wrong direction weird Thank You mr. Wiggles XZ is wrong so now I've got it order matters Oh order matters I mean I should just do this in one rotation matrix yeah same thing interesting 964 you still have a V well it's working now I just don't understand oh no no that's right so the first rotation the first rotation is off of V and then I just continue to rotate yeah so it's actually it's just I'm looking at it wasn't this wasn't what I saw when I originally did it though was it when I originally did it seamless no oh I have lost track of where I was I mean don't get me wrong I was just gonna do all the rotations XY XZ ZW we could just keep going with craziness well now I'm gonna wait til the sound dies down color the points and lines that would be nice no I'm just just noise in the hallway what time is it it's only 6 o'clock I'm just trying to think of where I should go back to mmm because there was the point where I would I want to go back to is when I thought I did the fourth dimension the first time oh maybe that was just this weird yeah I'm definitely want to make the rotation interactive and everything I'm just trying to think I don't know where I I don't remember where I where I was cuz I could go back on you look good someone go back like ten minutes in the wolf livestream I was trying to do XY and Z W right when I did XY and z w wasn't that where I said I'm entering the fourth dimension and then that I tried then did I try to and it was that but then did I do this we're trying to find though the place where it like looked oh yeah yeah this is where I was okay yeah I just went to the wrong side got it alright okay it's just a viewing angle yeah okay okay so guess what this is actually correct I just had the wrong viewing angle so like basically what we're doing right now if I if I just do the two rotations the at sorry there's something over here that noise is so distracting give me a second people so okay yeah but sir I'm just waiting for the sound to die down which might be a lost cause let me take a look outside okay that's a while Scott let's do B they'll be sound in the video that's the problem okay why this was a hard problem now I understand why people who make youtube videos they like script things and practice they dig like a whole week to make something someday okay so I'm back again I was trying to figure out why this is wrong and then I realized oh this is actually right it's I just I'm used to seeing a certain pattern and I've just got the viewing angle slightly wrong or slightly different so basically let me comment this line rotate Y out the two rotations that I'm doing right now are X Y Z W and if we do that without just natively the way that I drew the cube you sort of see the Z rotation and that W rotation that in in the projection of the 3d world is like kind of coming in and out almost looks like breathing and so what I actually want to do is just rotate it on the x axis to put things on the side and I could do that with a rotation matrix because I have a full 3d renderer I'm going to say rotate X negative pi divided by 2 and there we go now this should look like the tesseract visualization that you're used to seeing this is that W rotation like rotating and by the way we have now entered you know there's a little bit anticlimactic I guess but here we're done this coding challenge is complete and I just want to stop I'm not gonna do any more because I'm gonna leave this for you let's think about let's think about all the kinds of things you could do to this to make this more beautiful or interesting or weird first of all you know what are all sorts of other rotation matrices you can apply like what's like a three axis rotation you could certainly do that right what multi how many this is a double rotation cuz you do a triple or quadruple what if you try a bunch of different other axes with the W axis you know I'm just drawing these little points and connecting them with lines there are probably so many other ways you could think to visualize the pattern of the tesseract you can now enter the fourth dimension projected into the third dimension and see a result I will try to make a JavaScript version of this with the p5.js library has a WebGL renderer so that will be released also with this uncoding challenge and there was something else that I just thought of a second ago Oh I will try to make a JavaScript version I will make up jobs I will also make a JavaScript version of this using the p5 just library which has a WebGL renderer although in theory I don't even need a 3d renderer because I could project the 4d points to 3d and then project the 3d points to do t 2d if you really want a hard problem try doing that ah but really I ask you how many how what dimension can you can you project down into three dimensions and visualize can you get up to five six seven what happens so I encourage you I challenge you to try all sorts of weird stuff to make some beautiful art and enjoy spending time in the fourth dimension okay that music better not get me a copyright violation it says from a YouTube website that that's music you can use let's go double check let's find it otherwise I'm gonna redo this coding challenge again which actually would be fun to do now that I know all the mistakes that I made not you might tell me he I have to redo it which I would totally understand no not here not here not here not here where where did I did I closed that out oh no wait where is it no it's on the history audio library free music what did I do genre cinematic mood dark it's this one you're free to use this song and monetize your video all right oh you heard it here okay well I said I was gonna make a tesseract I made a test right now the question is let's just I need some I need a thumbnail let's make sure we have a good thumbnail I'm sure there was something in there but I just want to make it a little bigger let's do full screen P 3d and then I'm going to when I scale it up just do with / let's see what happens when you do that whoo what did I do oh no it's not sorry false the function is fullscreen okay that's not good let's try with / for that's close to what I was sort of hoping to see with divided by eight okay that looks good now what do I want too let's slow the angle down a little bit let's make the stroke wait for and the stroke wait like 16 let's try this okay there we go and maybe we should make this is it is it actually better without the points I just don't see what it looks like like I don't need to draw the points necessarily right yeah what do you think visually do you like it with the points there without the points misterwiggles what did I miss different color lines see I'm just curious what's this do here for a second that's kind of interesting all right III can't get I'm gonna let you be creative with color Oh strokeweight with distance to the camera meaning distance to the W okay I think I liked it better actually thin with some points this should be done here that's ugly what if I give these like some alpha does that what happens well it's kind of interesting okay uh all right so whatever that's fine visually I kind of want to add like another rotation I'm just curious just curious okay let me just add one more rotation like so if this is X y and this is Z W why don't I try Y W oh yeah there we go that's crazy just take out the if I just take out the CW now interesting so many possibilities all right all right all right all right right nothing's happening now I got tired and I started like distracting myself with but I'm gonna I'm gonna again the world is a much more creative place than me go back to here and I'm gonna do a little intro so how how long would you say has been the total amount of time I spent building this in the livestream and how do I say lay how do I say it again that the YouTube channel from James layoffs OS layoffs OS lay us OS okay okay all right so I don't know if this is necessary but Matthew you can use it if you want hello this coding challenge that you were about to watch this is the final result it is a 4d tesseract visualized in 3d also 40 tries again hello this coding challenge you're about to watch right here this is the final result it is a fourdimensional hypercube also known as a tesseract visualized in three dimensions but really in two dimensions on this twodimensional screen that you're watching this now so I just completed this coding challenge in a livestream the livestream was about 73 hours look full of debugging the coding challenge itself is much shorter it is kind of long but less stuff is edited out of like going off on debugging tangents if you're interested in seeing all those debugging 10 tangents you could check this video's description into a link to the live stream where I did this but also I just want to briefly mention thank you to what I'm gonna read it this introduction saying way too long layoffs OS I'm gonna try this one more time hello you are about to watch be careful a coding challenge for I where I make this this is a fourdimensional hypercube I mean not really but it is a four it mathematically it's a fourdimensional hypercube projected into 3d and then processing this computer program thing is taking that 3d math and then projecting it into 2d so you could look at it and see it anyway if you watch the whole coding challenge that what I just said there might actually make sense to you so um it took me a very long time to do this I had lots of problems what you're about to watch is still long but edited down if you want to see the full livestream which is three thousand four hundred and twenty two hours long you can find a link to that in this video's description also a big thank you to lay us OS the YouTube channel where there's a wonderful video about what is forty the hypercube I will link to that in this video description as well I mentioned also a coding challenge but I wanted to mention it right up front okay hope you enjoyed this coding challenging make it all the way to the end and you make your own version of this please share it with me goodbye I'll be not goodbye but goodbye right now for me and I'm gonna keep going okay I guess okay alright I am tired I need a moment I need a moment I'm gonna put on some music for you all I don't know what this one is some other free music I downloaded I'm gonna really build out my soundboard and I'm just gonna check I'm gonna check just some things to see what how much time I have if there's any emergencies I'm just checkin just checking a few things making sure there's no urgent messages for me from any of my other lives oh there was a message that I missed what time is that message I can't see here is this relaxing you this music I know where I put my phone Oh what message was from over an hour ago okay but I did reply to it all right I'm trying to decide if I have the stamina or energy to do anything else today let's take a look at some ml5 let's consider some other ml5 stuff I don't have my ukulele otherwise I did my ukulele tuner the feature extractor is too much for me to take on right now I think I probably should call it a night I think I have I mean pose net would be fun to do this is pose net by the way if you haven't seen this what's the natural what not the natural what's the sort of progression here if I think about if I think about what I've done in terms of these ml5 videos so I did intro to ml 5 wherever that is image classification and web can I at least can make a list of what are the things I intend to do so a work Tyvek that's gonna be in the fall now let's make a list here and to do the convolutional Network just trying to think here so did image classification you know anything I might do classify this I did plane image classification I did a miss class with webcam you do the feature extractor to make a classifier and do a regression think those are both kind of interesting LS TM text style transfer pics to pics these are all the things I could do pose net Yolo and word to Beck so weird to Beck that's gonna come in the fall so I'm gonna do that in my atoz course pics the pics and style transfer I have some plans for those but it's gonna involve a guest so that's also gonna be fall so these these are the options right now if I was gonna do more Alice T Anna's also I'm planning to do that later so I think I'll hold off on that because that's also for my fall class so the feature extractor opposed net and Yolo are the three things Yolo is really slow right now so I don't know to what extent let's run the example it's worth doing that as a video oh the camera is off person that's pretty cool cell phone cell phone is there a bell in Yolo person what about like a pencil sofa really things are cell phones and people okay I think I'm too exhausted from the 40 to do anything else I think I might so all right let's talk about time and schedule for a second I am I saw something like Tetris strawpoll it sees a hand holding something and thinks it's a cell phone that's super interesting that's a very good point so that's really at such a good point on alka makes in the chat and thinking about machine learning alright so I am going on vacation I will be away at a secret location with very little internet for almost three weeks there's other things going on in that time my vacation is in exactly three weeks but I will be not livestreaming next week the week after or the week after it's today August so this counts as a live stream but to live streams in August I will be back Tetris is not happening right now that's the lovely idea 600 615 I mean I just like I need to I need a fresh start so I won't be back so right now the edited versions of these videos will come out slowly over the next few weeks there's a good chance that I'm gonna be able to come back and do just like one more line when it's try to produce a little bit more content for a while I'm away tomorrow afternoon Saturday so I'm gonna try to stop by is gonna be around here in the neighborhood going from here to there and I'm able to stop in for a couple hours and I could do I think it would actually doing the feature extractor stuff it's sort of a big topic but it would be worth it I'm just trying the site is that the thing like the machine learning so I've gotta like work up slowly but I think actually feature the feature extractor is kind of the next thing so the question is the game of code writes in the chat Tetris doesn't take long to make it's pretty straightforward so the question is I mean I'm just sort of curious I will do a straw poll I'm not gonna do any of the topics right now but I could do something a bit more substantial tomorrow whoa is this the same thing I've always been using and they just like change this design or this is what I've been using yes that's what I always been using there's like straw pulled on me next topic so this is hard because it's gonna kind of need a runoff cuz really it's like I want to say it's like ml5 allow multiple options oh so you can vote for more than one thing I might allow that so you can kind of vote for like a cup or than one ml5 feature extractor so what the feature extractor is it allows you to basically do what's called transfer learning so take the mobile net model and say like hey you don't know about what a pencil is I'm gonna show you a lot of pencils and add that as a label to something you can recognize it's but there's a bit more to it than that obviously in terms of the limitations of what you can do ml5 pose net and Yolo another option would be tetris nor something else oh the doodle classifier and this is without ml5 with TF KS directly that would be doing convolutional neural net neural networks and I kind of wanted to make a bunch of processing sketches that show how the pieces network work but that would be part of that to you all right I don't so I think I just allowed people to check more than one which is a little bit silly because but if you're like really interested in ml so I don't know you guys can game try to game the system but here is the URL for the straw poll right I should have made you choose one this multiple I kind of wanted to make it you could only pick two but I guess can you see the results if I don't show them like I'm gonna go over here view results yeah anybody can see the results Oh what got interesting hopes you enjoy Tetris hey I'm not saying I'm gonna do what you vote for I'm just curious to know and I can't capably I'll put Tetris on there what have a steak sodoku salt over okay I mean the link someone can post it in the chat but there it is you should have put four rune I know I I almost feel like for a Tetris I can handle more than Goro annoying people are interested in that doodle classifier interesting it's pretty interesting results here but it's like Tetris just everybody's second choice but really if I only gave you one choice it would all pick this one that's what I was sort of planning to do well how to code Tetris code it yourself Tetris programming from scratch so I could just thirty six minutes so watch this guy it's gonna take me 17 hours learn how to create a game Tetris in six minutes and yet the video is four minutes interesting meth meth method to this this is I mean meth meth methods videos are excellent I mean I'm sure these videos are excellent too I just haven't watched them out of these channels simple tetris clone written in java oh yeah this is good it's gonna be multipart for sure right no way to not do it as a multipart thing tetris requirements a leftright key a hard drop key or rotation key a preview piece oh I'm not doing the preview piece full set of all seven kinds of shapes I'm not doing the preview piece it's definitely not happen these are like 1d Tetris of 2d that I could do here's a JavaScript under JavaScript see tetris JavaScript oh yeah this is like very little code I could do this drawing some stuff rotating some stuff oh god this is gonna be so painful this is gonna be so painful for me because I'm really gonna do this without having done in advance so you're gonna see you're gonna see a mess there of me let's refresh the results oh boy not getting any better is it I might have to do the feature I'm just warning you let's say it came down to hmm there's ballot stuffing going on isn't there I think there's some ballot something going on alright everybody thank you for tuning in I could answer a few questions make the preview piece no preview no Tetris do pong again the preview part is easy I guess so if I make the drop then if I make the drop button the preview is just showing where the drop button is gonna put it right so yeah I can make the preview all right I'll make the preview hmm just only use a few pieces like to thank you Tetris is so boring compared to the ML stuff for de Tetris well I don't know what to do I would say the people have spoken but ultimately I am the decider pretty you need to use single transferable vote really what does that mean 1d Tetris oh there is a 1d treacherous but this is like needs to run flash okay allow oh yeah this is 1d Tetris this is awesome this is really brilliant this is the same one yeah 1d Tetris everybody that's pretty brilliant would it be crazy to actually do 1d Tetris first alright so I definitely like the idea of doing Tetris with only a few different pieces what if I did Tetris with just one Pete one one tile pieces and then I would incorporate tile that might that might I'm trying to give the order to do this like what could I do in a single video Tetris with all the pieces are just a single cell and then as part two I could add more complex pieces and rotation would that make sense oh oh that's a good idea lei ah so as to saying hey I can work with you on 4d Tetris wouldn't actually I do 3d Tetris first 1d Tetris on April Fool's that's a really good job that's a really good idea I'll try to remember that yeah we could do a 4d tetrode we I'm I would love to do a collaboration with Leia so s so like some kind of like 40 Tetris thing would be really fun so maybe we could think about two so one D Tetris than 2d then 3d yeah I'm really exhausted how many hours of live streaming have I done today like four hours so I think I better go before I get talked into doing something else right again I can't believe what's nice is this hasn't crashed I don't know why I was crashing so much earlier and so yeah alright everybody let me let me let me let me go I think I mean that no guarantee is here but I'm gonna attempt to come back tomorrow it probably should continue the machine learning stuff because that's kind of the track that I'm on the tesseract was a break from that now you're asking me to do Tetris my fault for putting that in mr. choices I think I can't do Tetris tomorrow like this like desired you like one more little thing right now this is a terrible idea 630 feels early because I'm always running so late okay this is probably never gonna happen just kids were wondering would I do a sign why did this Barnsley fern I gotta close some of these I did this this is sort of did I did this I keep meaning to do this have I done this that's a good like winter themed one I really want to do tictactoe and then that what's that like min/max algorithm or something tictactoe might be better than tetris tictactoe with neural network you can have it like play itself and learn you are not a polling expert the vote for the ml stuff got dived among multiple videos yeah I agree I agree I'm reading about single transferable vote now snake I have done the snake okay tictactoe with min Max is pretty easy but so satisfying and fun for d tictactoe Tetris Kinect for with machine learning that would be fun to connect for I like Kinect for that's a fun game maybe I should just do 1d Tetris right now if I do 1d Tetris right now will you all be satisfied and I cannot do Tetris tomorrow this okay options for the pull alright fine it's gonna make the only option yes I'm voting for my I'm voting for yes all right it's been decided I can do 1d Tetris right now I like that for April Fool's though I could save it we can just I can do it now but not release it until April Fool's now nobody has the URL nobody can see this URL if you can catch it fast oh it's here Oh Oh uhhuh this is exciting this is looking good Connect four for your Italian followers uh Oh Oh things are gone things are going south fast oh boy this is bad news everybody what if I read you some random numbers if you do what I I got to start with like one deeds to get to 2d to get to 3d oh this is very confusing bad help me out people I kind of I'm just gonna read a little my book here 53,000 so I'm so into you I'm so tired somehow I make my own voting system fractals are cool but I'm nothing to do with Tetris rockpaperscissors oh I love that but the the best rockpaperscissor strategy is to be completely random pure randomness why this is really why this is like very polarizing I'm just seeing her refresh those I'm sorry I'm so I don't think I should do the 1d tetris thing now Hey fortunately no seems to be the answer go home it's dinner time go and receive okay I think we're done with this poll this is no consents there's no consensus here there's no consensus hmm oh look at that but I don't think I code this in this video all right everybody let's look at the tesseract somewhere it's interested it's nice to sort of hear what people are interested in which is helpful to me I am going to be going how long is this live streaming going on over two hours right yeah thank you for tuning in sorry that I just wasted like a half an hour of your time there and I'm gonna look into some of these ideas and think about it I might be back tomorrow I can work that out otherwise you won't actually see me in a live stream until the very end of the month like August 28th or 27th or 29 is the 25th of Friday or 25th of Saturday the 27th whatever that Monday is I think the 27th would be the earliest yeah 2 hours and 30 minutes yeah so I said well I said set out what I meant to accomplish today which was to program a tesseract I will take a few minutes to answer any questions I will take a few minutes to answer any questions huh one thing is that I'm working on capturing a lot of my videos I kind of haven't been keeping up with that if you are interested in submitting captions sometimes well mentions I mean who's watching anymore now but I would you can go to there's a link that I can share let me share it in the chat I'm really interested in getting English language and other languages as well but often it's nice if a video does have any English language captions to get that first because it makes translations easier I'm just gonna post a link in the chat to here is a place where you can where's our live chat going on here's a place Oh Matt Graham I just saw that question this is a link did that just go in yes that's a link where you can submit captions so if anybody has time or interest in doing that please do Matt Graham asks when do we receive the slack invite via email well guess what you could receive it right now I don't see you in here though oh right okay so Matt Graham you need to go to the community so this I have a slack channel which is for members and also patrons you you if you want to join that you can click the join button or the go click over to patreon you have to then go to the community tab there's no slack YouTube integration so you have to go to the community tab and then there's a post there with a link to a Google Form which you can enter in your email and your YouTube username so I can match it up and then I will send you an invite so if you do that in the next minute I will do that Thank You Ryan a nice comment to hear that you Oh you start computer science at University this September that's one of a good luck do I speak Spanish I do not speak Spanish no I'm good I cube ik asks I'm going to take a class next week where I will learn about AI and m/l using the Python tensorflow library do you have any tips for me um have fun don't feel like you're the only one who doesn't understand stuff because everybody else also doesn't understand stuff but everybody's afraid to say it and be critical and think about the data that you're that's being used in a project and it's applications those would be my pieces of advice can you talk a bit Nabil asking talk a bit about pics pics so if you're interested in pics to pics I'll refer you to the work of yunying she and the ml5 library I believe I'm gonna go find this easily but you Ning she picks two pics I feel like hopefully she has a blog post about it but anyway I have a plan in the future to do I thought there was a blog post maybe about her work with pics depicts an ml5 but I'm gonna save that for another time are you more of a Java or a JavaScript kind of kind of person Java what is pan man asked what is feature extraction classifier oh come on I should do that tomorrow that's gonna trust me Jeep you know the feature extractor stuff is so powerful and interesting I should definitely do that tomorrow thank you for asking that totally makes sense but what just happened here all right started over was about 37 seconds in second favorite programming language after Java JavaScript would that be third favorite programming language I don't have what is Udacity ml course good no idea maybe will you ever do deep Q learning boy I should really only pick out the questions that I have too quick to answer I don't know Oh mr. moose addict let me answer this question in the slack channel directly asking about this project from a while ago I will answer that I'd rather not discuss do you recommend to an engineer to use JavaScript for data science so yeah as you might be aware if you've watched this channel before I basically I really try to stay away of recommending tools or particular programming languages for me you know the right programming language to use is the programming language that's in front of you right now and you know everything has its pros and cons and at some point you're gonna find things are like oh gosh this thing that I made in this programming language is kind of a disaster compared to how I'm doing it over here but I don't think there's no easy answers to these questions there's no i this is my project use this so I really can't answer that are you somebody who knows a little JavaScript and is interested in the field of data science tinkering around with tensorflow jess ml5 other JavaScript libraries d3 looking at observable HQ notebooks all these things are possible and worth do his JavaScript language for data science probably not but you know perfectly fine is it true that times 0.5 is faster than / I hear that all the time magnet stop ignoring me I don't know what question I ignored but I didn't see it or ignored it for good reason I'm trying to stick to on topic questions and ones that I can answer is this stream starting in the middle or ending it is ending looking at the chat see more questions thanks everybody for your support just watching as a support being members of support recommending the videos to somebody as support making your own stuff inspired by stuff that I made a support deciding to not watch anymore because you have something else you want to do in your life is support all those things are valid alright did I go to college yes oh the pencil eraser doesn't work it's not capacitive somebody asked what do I get if I would support you as a patreon so first of all honestly if you want to join as a member or as a patron I would say do it because for some reason doing that makes you feel good and you have the means because what you get I don't know I don't know if I have anything really worthwhile for you but I will say that the slack channel is a wonderful community of pretty nice and welcoming people and a lot of experts in there like way better answering questions than me and I'm kind of not in there that off I'm gonna move in there as much as I can I like to be in there but there's lots of people in there who are better equipped to answer your questions so that's probably the main thing you get is kind of joining that particular commune of this community and then you know I will get around to mailing you stickers or a sign book and that kind of thing eventually I just did it does take quite a while for me to do that so again if you want a book I would suggest just buying it but if you are that's that's really why I really don't want to advocate too much for joining the patreon or the YouTube membership it really does help me have the resources and time to make these videos but that that would be that's my answer so I appreciate it and I encourage you if you feel like it's a thing you want to do great but I will love you just as much if you do not join I have some really interesting questions here what did you learn in college okay eight seconds left on the clock I studied in college a long time ago I my major was a mathematics and philosophy I graduated in 1995 and I didn't do any computer programming at all in college not once maybe I did and I just don't remember but if I did it certainly wasn't substantive and then I didn't actually do any computer when graduated college 1995 I didn't do any programming I think I took it actually that's not true I took an evening C++ course a year or two out of colleges to see and it didn't didn't take and then I started as an ITP student in 2001 and that's when I really started doing programming more seriously I've never done it seriously but it didn't spend more time doing it so I really started luck you know to me I was so young then I feel like but late in life comparatively like you know kids nowadays my kids my older son who is 10 probably did his first like coding class and scratch at like the age of 7 maybe um so and I he's done some p5 workshops since mad Nick 45 asks how old are you and I say look only into your own username for my age okay alright so that's it everybody I'm gonna go I feel like I did not I did not do what I wanted to do this week which was generate tons of content to have new stuff on the channel over the next few weeks why on the way know why I'm worrying about this let the channel take a break I will say that my commitment hold on let's do just bear with me I've been meaning to do this accounting so if you don't mind I want to do this accounting I'm gonna go to my channel because I want to figure out like what do i what do I really need to make sure I do I'm gonna go to playlist I'm gonna go to created playlists well I just revealed something about myself does anybody watch this show I only watched season one one but I like I love this show the genius I really want to do coding challenges about the genius if anybody is a fan of the genius I don't know it's it's me I mean I watched it a long time ago and I meant to get the season 2 and I never just got around to it okay uh I'm looking for created playlists yes okay this is why I don't like to be logged into my own account live streams live stream archive there's 160 Jesus oh you oh boy okay so let's look if somebody could do this full accounting for me that would be oh it doesn't give me the dates here oh this is ridiculous okay I don't think I can do this accounting right now because I just want I just want to see the dates of each one of these here so I could I really I mentioned the genius before haven't I I think I have yeah I really want to do an accounting of this now if I so let's just see if I humor me for a second here let me just open this here so working backwards if I open all these and new tabs I just want to go back to like June I know that I was doing a ton in like April May so let's see does this at least have the date a live stream on May 11th okay so let's let's try to let's go back to May which one was that because I actually might have been light in May due to thesis which one was that that was 136 made a fourth that's obviously May and 134 is 134 is April so let's close that out so let's open up this May June July August my goal is to average for a November Chris wall oh did anybody yes did anybody I see Matt Graham so when you fill out that I need to match it with your user I'm going to choose to trust this so I'm gonna send yeah and by the way I'm getting text messages from home because my Phillips hue lights they flash when somebody joins so hey the lights are flashing okay so I'm gonna send those slack invites soon all right actually what I should do is just work on my other stuff that I need to work on just like keep livestreaming but I think I think it's Friday I'm gonna go I'm gonna take a break okay so wait I'm getting so many messages okay now let's look at this okay so May May 11th is one whoops what what the May 24th did I really not livestream between May 11th and May 24th no I messed up I can't even do this right wait there's no 137 what happened to livestream 137 huh okay hold on hold on livestream 137 Schiffman can anybody find livestream 137 faster than I can here it is promises in JavaScript's I'm going to edit this I'm adding it to the playlist somehow it got left out add to playlist live stream archive okay Save Changes and now if I go to that playlist it refresh so now if I go to the bottom it's totally gonna be at the bottom isn't it livestream 137 so I can move it up found it okay promise is there okay so let's start over no cuz these are at the beginning now 136 137 so 136 at 137 136 is May 11 so that's number one 137 is May 23rd that's number one 138 is May 24th one 139 is May 24th I mean I guess of two in one day I'm gonna count that as two because these are along that was only this one's only an hour 10 minutes I'm count as one but I don't know 140 is May 31st whoops I probably should delete one here so that's a total of four four and a half I'm gonna say that's four and a half in May okay now 140 what did I just what it was when I stopped at 141 was made was that June no June 8th so 140 was May I can't keep track a nice system is really flawed May 31st okay so 141 is June good 2 hours and 15 minutes 141 where's 142 142 is June good 3 hours long that's pretty good 143 June 2 and a half hours long June's got a lot looks like 144 so I'm only a June 18th I've already got 4 did I forget May 4th I forgot May 4th so five and a half 145 145 is June 27th I took a little break there it looks like which is 145 June 27th 146 it's July 20th oh because I went away yeah yeah that makes sense so June has 5 okay so 146 is July and August at 1 July 147 is also July 27th in July did I really only do 2 in July I think there's a July 147 what's one is today 148 this was July yeah last Friday that makes sense so did I forget may the 4th did I not get this one 135 yeah so now I missed 135 which was also in May okay so May at five and a half June had five July had two and August so far has I'm gonna count this as two because I did a full livestream this morning and this afternoon so we average that 14 and a half divided by four so I just need one and a half more live streams because if I get to 16 by the end of August that's an average of four so I need one and a half more so if I do one tomorrow and I get one one more and at the end of August I'm actually be at four in August and that will be good so that's what that's the sort of commitment I'm making in terms of people supporting through the membership and that sort of thing okay all right let me check let me check these slack invites if you are in the chat right now you just joined as a member please let me know did I send the invites we hold on I'm just gonna I'm gonna do a little double checking of this ascending member slack invites now we're to go community community channel memberships okay so now let me look for uhhuh seven hours ago okay great this is validated slack invite coming in okay now one more one more coming all right Matt it's like invite coming and there we go I'd be curious actually yeah so I'd be curious for a graph of actually the amount of time that I live streamed I'm sure I can use the YouTube API or something I really also this is something I'm really like toying with I sort of feel like the live priz what you just joined go to the community tab go to the communities have find that members only post there's click click to the Google forum and enter your email address there and just put prison the YouTube username column I feel like the live streams and the edited videos should be separate channels but I don't know how to break that apart now it's like too late because how do I start a new channel from scratch or to say like oh if you want the live streams so I think I'm probably not going to do that but if someone wants to try to talk me into that I'm open to the idea okay I don't see any more but anyway I will I will I will look at those oh yeah III can't say goodbye it's like a problem I have but so we'll see I'm gonna try to live stream for a little bit tomorrow to be honest with you I think I want to do some more ml5 stuff sorry to dissapoint about that Tetris I will keep that in mind that that's the thing about it though is like when am I ever else gonna do Tetris I'm gonna think about I'm gonna sleep on it I'm gonna sleep on it you can tweet me at Schiffman with you know strongwilled opinions if you like can comment on any YouTube video you want by the way I'm something weird happened the other day that I'm curious about I wonder if I could pull this up I think I can't pull this up without privacy issues let me see if I can I'll just mention it so I have that this video coding visualizing 500k subscribers this particular video the other day came up hey look this particular video is suddenly in my analytics was like what like hundred times the traffic that it would like normally have because it's an old video and nobody's watching it anymore and then I went looked at like geographically and it was up everywhere but the views from India we're like way up compared to everything else does this get to this get like linked from somewhere can anybody help me find that if anyway there's a idea why that happened I be curious to recreate it just look at my analytics right now to make sure that's not continuing to happen because it's just the arbitrariness of the YouTube recommendation algorithm is probably what it is right the snake game is what yes because very few people are 33 people in the last 60 minutes watched that video right now which is not very much I mean it's amazing in many sense hold on beginning Oh interesting Matthew in the chat makes a good suggestion if you want to separate the lie from the main channel spend a year streaming to both a new live only Channel and the current coding trained child I just feel like I wonder if there are people who want the notifications for the edited content and people who want the notifications for the live stream and those are two and having all that together redundant lis in the same channel is like too much and maybe I should have just coding trained live and coding trained Channel I don't know the answer to that so I'm curious for your views I gotta go I just can't say goodbye thank you for tuning in and entering the fourth dimension would be today I enjoyed it I'm so pleased this is something I've looked at for years and thought I have no idea how to do that okay I don't understand anything about it so uh what do I do when I finished the forum priz wha Griswald just wait for his wall here comes here comes frizz wall the invitation sent alright so I'm because I'm gonna be away for so long I do this does help me kind of think like I actually don't need to serve ice cream tomorrow just in terms of my own personal accounting to feel like I'm doing the amount that I sort of set out to do with my goals but it would be nice to get a little bit further with some stuff before tomorrow don't don't get your hopes up in terms of the tetris thing that that honestly seems pretty unlikely but thank you for indulging me with the straw poll I do see it as something people are interested in and I will see you all tomorrow okay goodbye everybody see you maybe tomorrow if not at the end of the month stay tuned for the edited versions of the videos and as always thank you for your support I need a tagline like Jabril has that great like always remember to always feed your curiosity I don't have a good tagline this is all I got is this it's been a while I'm gonna play you out with the trailer bye everybody and that totally did not work whoops how come the trailers not playing oh wait that's weird come the trailers not playing loop restart hide stars huh well I guess you won't be seeing the trailer that's weird hold on I mean just just bear with me for a second let me add a new scene here trailer 2 then all you two do is add media source right media source no no not a media source a VLC video source video capture device seen me source I thought I don't add I don't had a video to open broadcast studio I know you can't see me you entered the fifth dimension browser source no media source local file browse give me that oh I deleted that file I bet because I was doing like a cleanout of the I was doing a cleanout of the hold on I was doing a cleanout of I can't like examine this layer without book it's not filters I was doing a cleanout of oh hold on see if it's somebody because I had it's was like I got rid of Google Drive on this computer see if it's somewhere else okay hold on I said I was gonna play out with the trailer I'm gonna revive I'm gonna revive I got to make some icons come on people make me some icons actually I you know what I have to email I'm gonna take care of that I got an idea oops just give me a second this isn't gonna take too long we're gonna get that trailer download it delete it off the computer trailer okay download download anyway unload anyway is it downloaded it is downloaded trailer is coming back properties browse where is it in downloads there it is just leave it in downloads that's a good place for it oh there you go oh sorry about this studio few stalls or suggestions I'm ignoring the purposes I'm afraid of doing that creation you you
