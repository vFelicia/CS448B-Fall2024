09:58 - well hello
10:00 - happy friday good morning welcome to the
10:02 - coding train with train whistle classic
10:05 - because i can't find my new custom laser
10:08 - etched train whistle i've got to just
10:09 - use this
10:11 - uh old one that i used to use
10:13 - oh but it has the best sound listen to
10:15 - that
10:16 - now i'm using some uh very fancy
10:19 - high-tech uh artificial intelligence
10:22 - sound processing technology to reduce
10:25 - the echo that's in this room that i'm in
10:28 - because i somehow refuse
10:30 - i should just show you something here
10:33 - i mean i should just spend wouldn't you
10:34 - want to watch just an entire live stream
10:40 - of me
10:43 - kind of trying to attach these to the
10:44 - ceiling hang some sound blankets i mean
10:47 - maybe if i just speak like this
10:49 - is this better
10:51 - um
10:52 - was the whistle silent
10:54 - because i wonder i have noise reduction
10:56 - on and i wonder if my
10:58 - no
10:58 - sound oh this is so strange
11:01 - are you all hearing me
11:04 - please let me know
11:06 - if i'm coming to you loud and clear and
11:08 - live i'm tripping over things i have
11:10 - something exciting to show you actually
11:12 - though oh no i'm getting a phone call
11:15 - well this is an important phone call but
11:16 - i can't take it while i'm live on there
11:18 - i actually just got a really important
11:19 - text message which read what am i
11:22 - forgetting for the seder plate so i
11:25 - probably should answer that
11:27 - uh happy whatever holiday if you're
11:29 - choosing to celebrate any of the
11:31 - possible holidays that might be
11:32 - happening anytime within the last six
11:35 - months or the next six months you know
11:37 - if you're following a 12-month calendar
11:39 - oh there's just so many ways that you
11:41 - could be that's just different and
11:43 - interesting we're from all over the
11:45 - world and i would like to hear from you
11:46 - in the chat tell me where you're from
11:49 - you can hear me but not the train and i
11:51 - say wave collapse function again oh i
11:54 - said it wrong again
11:58 - the whistle was silent that's insane
12:02 - wow the a okay hold on hold on everybody
12:05 - we're going to uh we're going to make
12:07 - something happen here that is completely
12:11 - insane
12:13 - uh i'm going to disable
12:15 - the futuristic high-tech artificial
12:19 - intelligence train whistle suppression
12:21 - engine
12:22 - that i am running
12:24 - i see we've got south africa
12:27 - we've got ethiopia
12:30 - india
12:32 - indonesia this is incredible and and to
12:35 - think
12:36 - that i was like i spent by the way all
12:39 - of my prep time if there ever was any
12:41 - prep time for me live streaming was
12:44 - spent me working on a message saying i'm
12:47 - not able to live stream today and i was
12:48 - like i just have to do it it doesn't
12:50 - matter i have between 9 45 a.m
12:54 - and 11 45 a.m free even though i'm
12:57 - unprepared i don't know how to code a
12:59 - thing that i might like to code i have a
13:01 - uh i don't know what to do but i have a
13:03 - list of things because i was streaming
13:04 - on twitch yesterday and i made a list of
13:06 - things that i would do today so hold on
13:08 - i've got to get rid of this france nepal
13:10 - argentina new jersey venezuela nigeria
13:12 - brooklyn new york hello okay
13:16 - brooklyn
13:18 - uh uh oh i am not in brooklyn new york
13:21 - at the moment although that is where i
13:23 - do consider my home to kentucky usa
13:25 - chris sears hello denmark oh whoops hold
13:29 - on uh
13:31 - uh
13:34 - whoa
13:36 - oh now i'm getting some weird echo sound
13:39 - oh oh i i think i have the monitor on
13:42 - and it's coming out okay hold on boston
13:45 - sorry everybody this is too much where's
13:47 - my production team to help me navigate
13:50 - all this i got to turn the echo
13:52 - reduction off noise suppression so you
13:54 - can hear this just could you please
13:58 - stop distracting me with all of the
14:00 - amazing places you are around the world
14:02 - uh nvidia
14:05 - bro
14:06 - broadcast sorry for the sorry for the uh
14:09 - focus issues i can't i can't make it
14:11 - happen where is the software oh there it
14:14 - is
14:15 - there it is
14:16 - okay
14:19 - can i do this
14:29 - okay the noise removal is gone but the
14:32 - echo removal is still on so let's see
14:34 - how this goes ready everybody
14:37 - welcome to the coding train okay so i've
14:41 - got to um
14:43 - do something i've got a guest coming on
14:45 - in a minute uh before i get to that let
14:48 - me thank today's sponsor brilliant
14:52 - do you like learning do you like the
14:54 - coding train guess what i think you're
14:56 - also gonna like brilliant it's a website
14:58 - there's an app it's just got all of
15:01 - these courses and interactive lessons
15:02 - the thing is the thing that i like to
15:04 - say about brilliant which i think is
15:05 - really important is that you're watching
15:08 - me and i'm here tucking tucking tucking
15:11 - waving my arms around trying to get you
15:13 - excited about code and different things
15:15 - you might want to learn that's great
15:16 - that's a thing i'm glad you're here i'm
15:18 - glad you're watching but one of the real
15:20 - uh real ways to learn i think is to just
15:22 - get your hands in there to try it
15:24 - yourself
15:25 - and that's what i try to encourage you
15:26 - to do watch the video try it yourself
15:28 - but another way to do that is through
15:29 - interactive lessons online and i can't
15:31 - really think of a better platform than
15:33 - brilliant to do that so you can sign up
15:35 - for free at brilliant.org codingtrade
15:37 - that lets them know that you found it
15:39 - through me there's lots of stuff you can
15:40 - do for free on the website and then if
15:43 - you want to get the premium subscription
15:44 - which unlocks all of their courses
15:46 - there's a really good neural networked
15:47 - one there's a really good like algorithm
15:50 - fundamental one
15:51 - you can
15:52 - purchase a premium subscription and the
15:54 - first 200 people to do so will get uh 20
15:56 - off so thank you to brilliant for
15:57 - sponsoring the coding train today i'll
15:59 - come back in the middle somebody remind
16:00 - me at around
16:02 - maybe an hour
16:04 - to look at the brilliant website a bit
16:06 - more all right now let me move that
16:09 - um did you all hear the train whistle
16:13 - did you all hear the train whistle
16:16 - that's what i would like to know and
16:17 - while
16:18 - uh while you're waiting for the train
16:20 - whistle i am going to
16:22 - bring in our guest oh my goodness i have
16:25 - so many messages
16:29 - okay somebody list for me in the chat
16:31 - the things you need on a seder plate
16:33 - because that'll help i know there's a
16:34 - shank bone
16:36 - there's an orange an orange is a new
16:38 - thing on a seder plate which uh we do in
16:40 - my
16:41 - familia
16:42 - um okay but wait wait
16:45 - there's so many
16:46 - okay okay
16:48 - uh i i gotta put the passover stuff away
16:51 - i gotta let in our guest here um so hold
16:53 - on i'm gonna um
16:55 - uh the audio is okay uh hello sauber
16:58 - your audio is going straight through to
17:00 - the broadcast just so you know uh so
17:02 - before you say anything you don't want
17:04 - anybody to hear like
17:06 - dan yeah that shirt is awful why are you
17:09 - wearing it or something like that
17:11 - um but actually could you just speak i
17:13 - don't your video is not up yet but if
17:15 - you would just say hello
17:16 - i can see if the audio is going through
17:18 - oh so ironically enough the audio's not
17:20 - coming through so let me fix that no no
17:22 - hold on it might be my headphones no no
17:25 - no your audio is coming through to me it
17:27 - just wasn't going to the stream and now
17:28 - it is so what i'm going to do is i am
17:32 - going to
17:34 - um i think if i press this button here
17:36 - aha yes uh whoops
17:40 - i've
17:41 - i just i think inadvertently revealed my
17:44 - the zoom meeting id but don't worry
17:45 - there's a waiting room so all the people
17:48 - will start trying to get into the
17:49 - waiting room so you're now you're seeing
17:51 - me here uh talking to sauber i um sabres
17:55 - from the prostate foundation we've known
17:56 - each other for many years worked i've
17:59 - i've been lucky enough to get to
18:00 - participate in a lot of different
18:01 - initiatives that sauber has organized
18:04 - like uh creative coding fest uh one two
18:07 - three four five six seven eight nine ten
18:09 - how many have there been
18:10 - uh almost 10 i think almost 10 not wrong
18:14 - um so can everybody hear sober okay
18:17 - yeah people are saying it's fine in the
18:18 - chat so um
18:21 - i think what i'd like to let cyber do is
18:23 - tell you about a few things that are
18:24 - going on with the processing foundation
18:26 - if you're not familiar with the
18:27 - processing foundation
18:29 - processingfoundation.org i can bring the
18:30 - website up while cyber is talking and um
18:33 - it's a it's an organization that i've
18:35 - been involved with for uh almost 20
18:37 - years now that hasn't existed for 20
18:39 - years so that's impossible but you know
18:41 - the software was existed before the
18:42 - foundation anyway
18:44 - um and so there's a bunch of things
18:45 - going on that i want people to hear
18:46 - about that you can apply for that you
18:48 - can get involved for and sober um as the
18:51 - education community director is that the
18:53 - right uh is is a great person to tell
18:55 - you about this stuff so i'm gonna i i
18:57 - have a problem with stopping talking so
18:58 - i'm gonna do it
19:00 - i can mute my microphone actually i just
19:02 - mute it
19:03 - and let uh lip sauber take it away for a
19:05 - few minutes
19:06 - sure uh thank you thanks for having me
19:08 - on uh this morning um hi everyone on the
19:11 - coding train um
19:13 - longtime listener and myself um
19:16 - i want to share a couple of programs
19:18 - that are coming up that you can apply to
19:19 - work with us
19:21 - that'll happen this summer they're
19:22 - really exciting and i would love for
19:24 - this community
19:25 - to put in applications if they haven't
19:27 - the first one is google summer of code
19:29 - and
19:30 - let me see if i can oh i can't share my
19:32 - screen but um maybe dan can pull it up
19:38 - look yeah totally yeah so um google
19:42 - summer of code is an opportunity to uh
19:44 - contribute to open source development uh
19:47 - google will fund your time we will
19:49 - provide mentorship and community and you
19:52 - get to work on some of our software
19:54 - projects and that runs uh this summer
19:58 - the application deadline is coming up
20:00 - really soon it's in four days on april
20:02 - 19th uh so if you're interested in
20:04 - google summer of code you know
20:05 - definitely go to the website that dan's
20:07 - showing
20:08 - you can also jump to our discourse which
20:11 - is a place where you can discuss your
20:13 - ideas and then please put an application
20:16 - if you have questions about how to do
20:18 - any of that you can send me an email at
20:19 - sabretprocessing.org
20:21 - i'll put that in the coding train chat
20:23 - in a minute after that
20:26 - and uh excitingly for this project
20:29 - google summer of code they've expanded
20:32 - eligibility which is one reason why i
20:34 - wanted to sort of let people know all
20:36 - over again about it uh so the only
20:38 - requirement is you have to be 18 and
20:40 - above um you have to be above age of 18
20:43 - and new to open source there's a couple
20:45 - of minor eligibility requirements beyond
20:47 - that but it really offers a lot of folks
20:50 - a chance to get involved with us so i
20:52 - hope
20:54 - if software development's of interest to
20:55 - you you look into this april 19th is the
20:58 - application deadline
21:01 - the other thing i wanted to mention um
21:03 - this um also happens every year
21:06 - is the processing foundation fellowship
21:09 - this one is
21:11 - due on may 1st
21:13 - what is the processing foundation
21:15 - fellowship um i think of it as a way to
21:17 - like either build something for our
21:19 - community or with our community and
21:21 - there's a bunch of priority areas that
21:23 - we have identified things like ai
21:26 - accessibility
21:28 - continuing support which means that
21:29 - you're gonna take one of our old
21:31 - projects and kind of continue to build
21:32 - on it uh ecology uh has been added this
21:36 - year
21:37 - and uh beyond that you can also seek to
21:39 - make educational materials which would
21:41 - be a teaching fellow
21:43 - then you'd work with me and some of our
21:45 - teacher mentors and we would
21:48 - support you in making education
21:50 - materials and putting them out to the
21:51 - world this also comes with a stipend and
21:54 - mentorship and a community
21:57 - what else did i want to say about that i
21:59 - think that's kind of it for apply to
22:01 - that one you would just go to the
22:02 - processing foundation website and
22:04 - fellowship and apply there um
22:07 - and you have about you know two weeks
22:09 - left for that so also reach out both to
22:11 - me or directly to the foundation
22:14 - foundationalprocessing.org if you have
22:15 - questions about uh the fellowship
22:18 - i think that's it oh
22:20 - creative coding fest i think we're going
22:21 - to do another one
22:23 - virtually
22:24 - this spring um this is where we bring
22:27 - educators and students together
22:29 - and uh basically like a mini version of
22:31 - coding train with like 45-minute
22:33 - workshops from educators a chance to
22:36 - get your hands dirty meet some of the
22:38 - people that are teaching this stuff
22:40 - uh and learned some
22:42 - little work you know some how to how to
22:44 - do a couple of projects um
22:47 - and what details are still being figured
22:49 - out if you're interested in that also
22:50 - email me starboardprocessing.org so
22:52 - that's the three things google summer of
22:54 - code processing fellowship and cc fast
22:58 - um
22:59 - how's that then did i did that that was
23:00 - perfect
23:02 - only thing that i would add is that
23:03 - because i said scrolling through the
23:04 - website a great
23:06 - great thing that you can do is check out
23:07 - the processing foundation's medium page
23:10 - which has a lot of blog posts about
23:13 - previous fellowships and previous google
23:15 - summer of code projects and that will
23:16 - give you an idea of things that people
23:18 - have done in the past that you might
23:19 - want to continue or just understand sort
23:22 - of what the scope is what's a reasonable
23:24 - scope and how people have sort of
23:25 - organized their thinking around
23:27 - different projects they've developed so
23:29 - that would be here i'm on the processing
23:30 - foundation website under fellowships
23:32 - right actually right here you can just
23:34 - see uh view the fellows from 2021 and
23:36 - 2020 but if i go over to the medium page
23:39 - we'll see there's an open uh post about
23:41 - the open call and then there's lots of
23:44 - uh wonderful posts about different
23:46 - things that people have done
23:47 - in the past digital accessibility uh p5
23:50 - live
23:51 - um three layer cake
23:54 - cs cake that's brilliant uh
23:56 - internationalization support et cetera
23:57 - et cetera and so
24:00 - um
24:01 - obaro asks in the chat are the are these
24:04 - opportunities remote and uh the answer
24:07 - to that is a distinct yes so um you know
24:11 - in in in the olden days we used to try
24:13 - to do a lot of uh physical get-togethers
24:16 - if there was a group of people in a sort
24:18 - of like one part of the world that were
24:19 - relatively near each other maybe that's
24:21 - a thing we could do we want to foster
24:23 - community as much as possible but
24:25 - absolutely there is no
24:27 - physical location requirement
24:30 - for you to do this there might be some
24:32 - eligibility requirements like sauber
24:34 - mentioned that are google's um
24:36 - eligibility requirements for their
24:37 - program the fellowship is open to anyone
24:40 - anywhere in the world as far as i know
24:42 - um but um
24:44 - so just check all those eligibility
24:46 - requirements but yes you don't have to
24:47 - be in person for any of this
24:49 - um just checking the chat i don't see
24:51 - any other questions so um i'm gonna i
24:55 - can let cyber go on with uh their day
24:59 - and um
25:00 - i
25:02 - thank you so much for being here oh so
25:03 - many people have questions um uh can
25:06 - they uh um what's the best way for them
25:08 - to contact you the email you suggested
25:10 - email email is great yeah cyber at
25:12 - processing and then a general question
25:13 - would be foundation of processing uh
25:16 - would be uh either um yeah thanks for
25:18 - having me on dan excited to see what you
25:20 - make today
25:21 - [Music]
25:23 - we'll see yeah all right and i'm gonna
25:25 - watch the severance this weekend
25:28 - you could just text me all weekend with
25:30 - all of your takes because i'm i'm i'm
25:32 - obsessed so i'll uh
25:34 - we'll have plenty to say about that soon
25:36 - enough
25:38 - all right thank you bye
25:43 - all right i'm just taking a peek at the
25:45 - chat let me get myself back here
25:48 - how do you add the subtitles actually
25:50 - this is something that i'm really hoping
25:51 - to improve uh subtitles i'm just using
25:54 - google's automated subtitles for live
25:57 - streams for videos i have them
26:00 - professionally captioned or i do some
26:02 - editing of them myself or somebody
26:05 - who works on codingtrain things uh helps
26:07 - me with that but um yeah if you uh are a
26:10 - um
26:11 - a subtitle user i mean
26:13 - i i watch a lot of shows with subtitles
26:16 - although i my hearing is
26:18 - uh as far as i know pretty reasonably
26:21 - fine
26:22 - um but if you have uh feedback or
26:24 - thoughts about how the content i'm doing
26:26 - can be made more accessible um please
26:29 - tweet at me email me daniel at
26:31 - thecodingtrain.com um i would love to
26:33 - hear from you okay can you restart your
26:35 - neural networks from scratch there's
26:37 - it's probably not going to happen
26:39 - because i have too much to do all right
26:41 - let me talk to you very briefly about
26:44 - what's on my list
26:45 - oh and let me check i i think the
26:47 - twitter poll i put up ended
26:49 - so um
26:51 - let me just look here under my
26:54 - profile i've got like uh oh well i guess
26:58 - i guess the people have spoken and i
27:00 - said wave collapse function again it's
27:03 - wave function collapse this is not a
27:05 - good sign for me trying to do a coding
27:07 - challenge today
27:09 - okay
27:10 - um let's take a look at the
27:13 - the the actual live stream poll which
27:16 - i'm going to end
27:17 - um
27:19 - yeah all right
27:21 - all right people we're doing it so i
27:24 - have something to say
27:26 - which is that
27:27 - um
27:31 - i mean i the problem is i have some
27:32 - other stuff on this list okay
27:35 - let's give me
27:37 - let's say let's say i have to start wave
27:40 - function collapse
27:41 - by 10 30 at the very latest no matter
27:44 - what else is going on so that is 19
27:47 - minutes from now
27:48 - i have to start it
27:51 - um
27:54 - i'm just looking to see hopefully
27:55 - there's some moderators in the chat um
27:57 - who can help with any of the spam here
28:00 - justin i'm not sure
28:02 - uh oh i i'm trying to match your name
28:04 - and your chat message with your twitter
28:06 - post it's a little hard for me to do
28:08 - that okay but um
28:11 - even though all i want to do is talk
28:12 - about severance at least take a peek by
28:15 - the way i i want to work on this during
28:17 - a live stream i'll probably do it on
28:18 - twitch
28:19 - um but uh take a look at the uur bot um
28:23 - which is a new bot that i've released on
28:24 - twitter um
28:26 - you know just just some people follow
28:29 - the pot not naming any names
28:34 - okay i'm very proud of myself i'm very
28:36 - proud of myself
28:38 - the crows off in the building of my the
28:40 - crows on the roof of my building scream
28:41 - like the sea and i know there's a storm
28:42 - coming i have lots to do with the spot
28:44 - if you want to contribute get in touch
28:46 - all right
28:49 - let's look at what else is on this list
28:51 - so i wanted to talk about some upcoming
28:53 - plans i have to reboot my twitter and
28:55 - discord bot series but
28:59 - wave function collapse so that's just
29:01 - going to put it just going to mention
29:02 - that and put a check mark next to it um
29:04 - i want to relearn apple to basic
29:08 - because i'm planning to do some videos
29:10 - with my apple two plus oh i have
29:12 - something exciting to show you which
29:13 - i'll show you in a second but
29:15 - oh i for did i put that on the list
29:17 - uh
29:18 - i don't think i um
29:20 - i don't put that i don't think i put
29:22 - that on the list but it's not gonna
29:23 - happen today because
29:24 - wave function collapse
29:27 - the collapse
29:28 - of the coding train function is imminent
29:33 - but i do have something i really feel
29:35 - like i should do live but i'm gonna punt
29:38 - it till later but let me mention it um
29:40 - and then maybe maybe you maybe you're
29:42 - all okay with just putting your trust
29:44 - and faith in me or maybe i'll just do a
29:46 - twitch stream just for this
29:48 - um
29:49 - but um i put out a survey i cannot
29:52 - believe uh to get some feedback about
29:54 - the coding train i am compiling the
29:56 - results and reading through the survey
29:58 - it's incredible there were over 2 000
30:00 - responses to this which is just
30:02 - blows my mind
30:04 - um and there was an option in the survey
30:06 - unfortunately it's closed now so sorry
30:09 - sorry for you if you were just hearing
30:11 - about this i'll do another one uh where
30:12 - you could enter to win a sticker
30:14 - giveaway so i was going to
30:16 - write a little p5 sketch to pick the
30:18 - winners
30:19 - and do that live
30:21 - but wave function collapse
30:24 - wave function collapse
30:26 - wave function collapse
30:28 - way stay with me everybody wave function
30:31 - could everybody just like
30:33 - get behind me and all just stand all
30:35 - everybody stand behind me and cheer my
30:37 - name
30:38 - as i'm working on wave function collapse
30:40 - that's a severance reference i'll try to
30:42 - stop making everything of severance
30:44 - reference okay
30:48 - uh you should talk about severance who
30:50 - cares about it so first of all let me
30:52 - just get this out of the way
30:53 - if you are interested i give i have i
30:56 - have six more minutes before i promised
30:58 - i would start
30:59 - i kind of have to erase the whiteboard
31:01 - though so that's good and i got to set
31:02 - up my code so really i have like two
31:04 - more minutes
31:05 - then i promise no more severance content
31:07 - but for those who are interested one
31:10 - check out uh first we'll listen to the
31:12 - podcast uh which had a nice interview
31:14 - with uh michael chernus uh who is the
31:17 - inspiration or his character in
31:18 - severance is the inspiration for you
31:20 - know follow dr amanda r on twitter also
31:22 - the um world's leading severant social
31:25 - media influencer
31:26 - um
31:27 - the uur bot checkout uh inspired by the
31:30 - character uh dr
31:33 - rick and lazlo hale i'm working on it
31:35 - it's sort of an alpha but people found
31:37 - it i mean i put it out there and so it's
31:39 - no longer alpha people are reading the
31:40 - tweets um and then also check out a
31:44 - lumen dash industries.com where you can
31:47 - enjoy
31:49 - uh
31:50 - macro macro data refinement to your
31:52 - heart's content uh and i would sit here
31:55 - and do this for hours and hours like i
31:57 - do in my that's why i don't prepare for
31:59 - the coding trade anymore all i do is
32:02 - refine the data
32:05 - wave function collapse wave function
32:07 - collapse i got it i got it everyone just
32:08 - keeps saying it um
32:10 - and if you want to contribute to either
32:12 - of these projects github.com
32:15 - shiffman
32:17 - is where you will find the u
32:20 - the uur bot it's probably it's a recent
32:22 - repository um there it is uur bot it
32:27 - needs a lot of work
32:28 - um i haven't piled uh compiled issues
32:30 - and things that i want to do or written
32:32 - to read me so i need to do all that and
32:33 - then you can also go to github.com
32:36 - lumen industries that's the company that
32:39 - i'm hoping will well hire me maybe i'm
32:41 - not hoping i think that's a bad idea
32:43 - actually but um this one is a bit more
32:45 - organized with a readme and uh there are
32:48 - some active pull requests going on and a
32:50 - bunch of issues of things that are to be
32:52 - implemented so
32:54 - frau plays it every day oh you've made
32:57 - me so happy that's the greatest thing
32:59 - i've ever heard and we'll be i'm going
33:01 - to be happy later today even
33:03 - even when this
33:05 - uh
33:06 - wave
33:07 - function collapse thing goes horribly
33:09 - wrong because here's the thing
33:11 - i'm going in totally cold
33:14 - which is and this is not an easy just
33:16 - like oh
33:17 - i already sort of know this
33:20 - or like i understand how it works so
33:22 - i'll just sort of figure it out as i go
33:25 - all right so i'm going to move this over
33:26 - here and close a bunch of windows we're
33:28 - going to get started
33:29 - i do need to look at the um
33:33 - brilliant website in the middle of the
33:35 - stream so i can't forget that i'm just
33:37 - closing all these windows it's also it's
33:39 - cold in here it's such a warm beautiful
33:41 - day and i um but this this room really
33:44 - my hands are but i think the cold is
33:46 - good it's gonna i'm gonna keep my energy
33:48 - up
33:49 - there will be a
33:51 - musical dance experience to be had
33:54 - oh jeez
33:56 - help help me somebody
33:59 - i'm in the country in the boonies
34:01 - there's just trees around me and i have
34:04 - all these lights and cameras and people
34:06 - watching what am i to do okay um i think
34:10 - that okay so wave function
34:12 - collapse we're gonna go
34:15 - to the uh source i know you're not
34:17 - seeing my screen right now that's gonna
34:20 - um
34:22 - i want to go to the uh this is it okay
34:26 - bringing this back
34:32 - um
34:33 - okay now something that's really driving
34:36 - me crazy is that my audio is being
34:39 - monitored
34:40 - by uh and it's coming out i gotta turn i
34:43 - gotta mute the pc okay i think it should
34:45 - be fine
34:47 - simon says literally in the last hour
34:49 - tried to figure out how the algorithm
34:50 - works how did that go
34:52 - see the thing is this is a bad idea this
34:55 - is not realistic for me to do in the
34:57 - next hour and 25 minutes
34:59 - so this part of me is like i should save
35:01 - this for a day when i have almost a full
35:04 - day to stream
35:06 - or maybe i should like do a little bit
35:08 - more research first
35:10 - or and just do something else today but
35:12 - you the people have spoken and i said i
35:14 - was gonna do it so i i have a feeling
35:16 - i'm gonna go
35:17 - in
35:18 - as if so the process that i have now as
35:20 - i live stream trying to work through
35:22 - some kind of algorithm or project
35:24 - and then i while i'm doing that i record
35:27 - everything to disk and i have something
35:28 - exciting to show you
35:30 - two minutes left
35:32 - um and which i'll get to in a second um
35:35 - and
35:36 - um
35:37 - then that gets edited together uh you
35:39 - know with some cutting out some
35:41 - extraneous stuff adding some additional
35:43 - like animations or explanations if i
35:45 - record them later to try to make a
35:47 - somewhat coherent
35:49 - somewhere between 20 and 60 minutes is
35:52 - sort of my goal video called the coding
35:54 - challenge wave function collapse so i
35:57 - just don't think it's realistic for me
35:58 - to do the whole thing today but this is
36:00 - what i feel like
36:01 - why don't i get it started
36:03 - see how it goes
36:05 - i can return and record the rest later
36:07 - or i could just come back and do the
36:09 - whole thing over at some point i've had
36:11 - a little bit of practice
36:13 - i think that's what i have to do
36:16 - i i don't know what else to say
36:19 - um
36:24 - all right i'm just taking a peek at the
36:26 - chat
36:27 - sounds like a plan yep right
36:30 - sounds like a plan
36:32 - ah
36:33 - this whistle this you're hearing the
36:35 - sound now right it's incredible
36:38 - and it doesn't have any echo is that
36:40 - amazing all right
36:41 - let me show you my exciting thing i see
36:44 - that it is 10 20.
36:46 - uh let's see if this works uh so i'm in
36:48 - a new studio
36:49 - and i put a camera over there uh which
36:52 - now you can see hi that's the wide shot
36:55 - so this is by the way i wanted to just
36:56 - introduce you to my new setup i mean
36:58 - it's the same setup that i've been using
37:00 - for years and years and years i just
37:01 - keep remaking it and i have this new uh
37:04 - big space where i'm living now um and
37:07 - i've been uh doing a lot of work on it
37:09 - and got some new sheet rock and painted
37:12 - some walls and
37:14 - put down a epoxy of blue epoxy on the
37:16 - floor
37:17 - you can see that i have legs this is a
37:19 - nice standing desk this is where the
37:21 - streaming pc is over here you can see
37:24 - where the cameras are
37:26 - and this is the whiteboard camera which
37:28 - i think is uh working pretty well these
37:31 - days i do need to erase this
37:34 - and i
37:34 - bought i went to
37:37 - ye olde hardware store
37:39 - and i have a righty board microfiber
37:43 - eraser cloth
37:48 - this is all the content
37:50 - that you signed up for today oh
37:54 - come on
37:55 - you can't open it
38:03 - okay wait i think i have a scissors
38:04 - somewhere
38:05 - everybody
38:07 - we come back over here
38:10 - i'm just curious to see if people have
38:12 - any
38:13 - uh
38:18 - mystery solved yes
38:21 - uh
38:22 - okay i'm uh
38:26 - got my beautiful oh there's two of them
38:28 - which is good because i wanted to get a
38:29 - microfiber cloth to clean my apple ii
38:32 - plus computer which unfortunately the
38:33 - camera is not pointed at the wide shot
38:37 - if you missed that stream oh good news
38:39 - by the way for those of you who caught
38:40 - my stream when i was
38:42 - uh building and well not building but i
38:44 - was re rebuilding and turning on um my
38:48 - apple ii plus computer for the first
38:49 - time in uh probably
38:52 - i don't know let's see probably let's
38:54 - say the last time it was used was 1990
38:56 - if i if i had to guess so
38:58 - 30 plus years
39:01 - [Music]
39:06 - oh we got it by the way this is the
39:07 - to-do list for the macro data refinement
39:09 - you'd think i would have thought to
39:10 - erase the whiteboard
39:12 - before i came in here i think i'm going
39:13 - to need some water
39:15 - um excuse me get some water talk amongst
39:18 - yourselves i'm going to wet this cloth
39:20 - slightly
39:22 - oh no you know what i have
39:25 - because oh
39:27 - i have a um
39:33 - i don't know if you can see me i should
39:35 - put the wide shot back on but i have a
39:37 - um
39:38 - like a wet wipe type thing
39:41 - oh i just took too many so this should
39:43 - this should do the trick really fast oh
39:45 - my goodness yeah
39:47 - by the way this is uh my daughter's
39:49 - drawing
39:50 - she was in here
39:51 - drew that so sorry maybe i'll leave that
39:54 - there now i guess i have to i'm gonna
39:56 - erase it
39:57 - she'll be fine
39:59 - okay
40:02 - okay uh
40:03 - that did the trick i don't i don't have
40:05 - a trash can
40:10 - all right now i'm gonna maybe i
40:11 - shouldn't well
40:12 - caution to the wind here
40:17 - there we go
40:20 - okay
40:22 - the next thing i need to do
40:24 - is set up
40:26 - a code file
40:31 - um and
40:33 - let me bring myself over here oh i need
40:35 - to
40:36 - i need to
40:42 - i definitely need to make sure i'm
40:44 - recording to disk so please bear with me
40:46 - for a second while i pull that up
40:50 - uh okay hold on it's coming
40:53 - all right
40:55 - uh no remind me later about updating oh
40:59 - and
41:02 - uh you know what just start recording
41:05 - okay so that's recording i'm recording
41:07 - to disk now
41:10 - um
41:15 - okay
41:16 - let me move some things to the side here
41:19 - that are unnecessary
41:21 - uh
41:24 - okay
41:27 - um i'm sorry sorry i'm looking at my
41:30 - phone which is a terrible idea
41:32 - but you never know the one the thing is
41:34 - i was gonna stream this afternoon and i
41:36 - had like a ton of i i thought i had
41:40 - like three or three or four hour block
41:41 - but i forgot because of the holidays i
41:43 - have to pick up my kids from school
41:44 - early
41:46 - i've got um so there's i got some family
41:48 - stuff going on so this is my only
41:51 - free time and it's it's dwindling fast
41:54 - because
41:55 - as i don't know who it was who said it
41:56 - in the chat
41:58 - uh
41:59 - here we are
42:01 - um
42:04 - is the red theme on your browser new i
42:06 - don't know i don't know where that came
42:08 - from
42:09 - i have no idea where that came from but
42:11 - great question
42:12 - uh
42:15 - uh justin that's that's nice of you to
42:17 - say i hope that your daughter is
42:19 - enjoys watching and maybe is interested
42:22 - in
42:23 - programming someday or already it's
42:25 - programming
42:27 - okay i've got to
42:28 - find a good whiteboard marker
42:34 - and let's okay
42:36 - let's go whoops
42:38 - let's start setting up so i um
42:40 - i think that i should use for this
42:44 - i'm not going to use the p5 web editor
42:47 - this feels like a complex enough project
42:50 - that having a bit more space
42:53 - and making sure i have easy access to
42:55 - the javascript console is going to be
42:57 - important
42:58 - so let's go to the desktop
43:01 - let's make a
43:03 - directory called wave function collapse
43:09 - and let's
43:11 - open that up
43:12 - in visual studio code
43:16 - and
43:17 - so um my workflow videos could use a
43:20 - refresher as everything could
43:23 - but um
43:24 - this is kind of my code editor of choice
43:26 - these days
43:28 - uh and i'm just going to have two files
43:30 - an html file and a sketch.js file and
43:33 - the way i like to write my html file is
43:35 - by going to the p5 web editor and taking
43:38 - this and then
43:40 - cop pasting it here
43:42 - whoops that's in sketch.js we're on file
43:45 - pasting it here
43:46 - and then going into stats.js and
43:50 - putting in a setup function
43:58 - and a draw function
44:02 - uh and will just give us a nice gray
44:04 - background to start and then making sure
44:08 - that uh oh and then i would like to run
44:11 - i've been using more recently the live
44:13 - server
44:14 - um which
44:15 - um does a good job of just auto
44:18 - refreshing when i change the code
44:20 - although i don't always want that to
44:22 - happen so i might go back actually you
44:23 - know what i don't like that
44:25 - because i like to be able to
44:27 - dramatically refresh and restart the
44:29 - sketch myself
44:30 - so let's go to this
44:32 - okay that's fine and let me just make
44:34 - sure
44:35 - that uh
44:36 - it's picking up the new code all right
44:38 - we're ready to go
44:39 - um i would also like to filter out the
44:42 - warnings
44:44 - the thing is like i made that april
44:46 - fool's video with the anal retentive
44:48 - coder
44:49 - which um like four people watched
44:53 - and then like ever since i made that i
44:55 - realized like oh my god that's me
44:57 - that was not a joke
44:59 - that's what i do all the time i'm like
45:01 - okay no i can't have these yellow
45:02 - warnings here oh my goodness it's
45:04 - looking for a style sheet we must fix
45:06 - that and i never get to anything
45:11 - um all right i do not
45:15 - need the sound library
45:17 - and i also
45:20 - that's fine now the warnings are gone
45:21 - now okay
45:22 - um i can close this
45:24 - all right i'm gonna have a little i'm
45:26 - gonna try to warm up
45:32 - okay see um
45:34 - oh yeah
45:35 - uh
45:37 - yeah i know i i read that link um so
45:39 - there's a lot of really great resources
45:41 - let me just jump into this video and i
45:43 - apologize i have to um
45:45 - blow my nose
45:49 - i think allergy season uh is is
45:52 - happening for me
45:53 - okay
45:55 - um
45:56 - all right
45:58 - so i'm just gonna dive in i'm recording
46:00 - to disc
46:01 - um um
46:03 - and um
46:05 - so i'm going with my plan here
46:08 - it is what it is thank you for being
46:09 - here
46:10 - i mean i should the live stream the
46:12 - other thing is
46:15 - be part of
46:17 - here we go ready everybody
46:23 - hello and welcome to a coding challenge
46:25 - video i'm dan and i am dreadfully
46:27 - unprepared for this
46:29 - let me so the topic is oh it's an
46:31 - incredible topic it's called wave
46:34 - function collapse and i'm going to put
46:36 - up a bunch of images and different
46:37 - things and resources and links that you
46:39 - will all be in the description that you
46:40 - can go to to read about there are just
46:42 - so many examples of this incredible
46:45 - procedural generative algorithm all over
46:47 - the internet it's a new algorithm uh it
46:49 - was started it was i think 2000 the
46:51 - origins are 2016
46:53 - by on the github username is mxgmn
46:57 - so all the proper credits will be again
46:59 - in the video description but if you're
47:01 - here
47:02 - to watch a proper tutorial about wave
47:06 - function collapse
47:07 - maybe
47:08 - go back to your search engine type in
47:11 - wave function collapse tutorial again
47:14 - because i don't think this is going to
47:15 - be it because i'm going in almost
47:17 - entirely cold i have read one or two one
47:21 - to three web pages about this algorithm
47:23 - i have seen many examples of what people
47:25 - have done with this algorithm
47:27 - and i
47:28 - am
47:29 - sitting here staring at the github
47:31 - repository for the original
47:33 - implementation which includes a nice
47:36 - explanation that i am going to attempt
47:38 - to follow in the next
47:41 - i don't know 400 hours and to be truth
47:44 - i'm recording this live right now
47:46 - there's people watching
47:47 - uh but i might get some help from the
47:49 - chat you know you tune into my live
47:50 - streams if you want to participate in
47:52 - that and uh i don't have a lot of time
47:54 - so i'm probably later on going to be
47:58 - wearing something entirely different
47:59 - because i'm going to have to come back
48:00 - and finish this another time i don't
48:01 - know why i'm trying to predict
48:02 - everything you yeah i could just redo
48:04 - this introduction later and when i know
48:06 - what happened and then i wouldn't have
48:07 - had to predict it
48:11 - let's let me try to describe to you oh
48:13 - okay
48:14 - this desk
48:18 - gotta lock these wheels better
48:22 - let me try to describe to you in a very
48:25 - sort of like loose
48:27 - terms my understanding of what wave
48:29 - function collapse is and i'm going to
48:31 - use my whiteboard for that
48:40 - uh i wanna there already is a processing
48:42 - four out it's i think alpha or beta but
48:43 - go check it out all right um how was
48:45 - that that was a fine intro right matia
48:47 - will do wonders with that
48:51 - i just want to make sure i'm actually
48:53 - still recording to disc
48:55 - yeah i think i can stop worrying about
48:57 - that
48:58 - the whiteboard camera i just i know i'm
49:01 - sorry but it's a little bit askew
49:04 - so i just want to fix that although is
49:06 - that did i do that on purpose oh i did
49:09 - that on purpose so that i can stand over
49:12 - on this side
49:13 - and the edge of it is here that's fine
49:16 - all right i think it's fine
49:18 - um
49:19 - all right
49:22 - my hands are cold oh you don't see the
49:24 - white board
49:27 - i mean in a way i should just when i'm
49:29 - doing the whiteboard i should probably
49:30 - go to this
49:32 - and in fact i could actually just have
49:34 - this up part of me wants to do it this
49:35 - way but
49:37 - i think it's good for you to be able to
49:38 - see
49:39 - uh the full
49:40 - picture and i've lost the chat
49:50 - yeah okay
49:56 - again i don't really know this algorithm
49:59 - so i'm probably gonna get some things
50:01 - wrong that's okay
50:03 - everything's going to be okay
50:30 - all right hold on
50:57 - okay
51:03 - okay
51:10 - the idea of the wave function collapse
51:13 - algorithm is to
51:15 - look at a particular image
51:30 - it's often something abstract like this
51:33 - analyze the patterns that appear in this
51:37 - particular image
51:39 - and use those patterns to generate a new
51:43 - image in the same vein or style of this
51:47 - one
52:12 - but the amazing thing about this
52:14 - algorithm
52:16 - this i mean what was i saying
52:20 - this might not seem like such a
52:23 - this might seem like a sort of everyday
52:26 - creative coding activity to you after
52:28 - all
52:29 - there's all these new kinds of machine
52:31 - learning and neural network and ai style
52:34 - transform and strength transfor style
52:38 - transfer
52:39 - and uh style gan and all these ways to
52:42 - generate images
52:43 - from one source as an inspiration but
52:46 - this
52:47 - is actually not using any of that it is
52:50 - an incredibly um i mean this is going to
52:52 - be really hard to implement
52:54 - like highly sophisticated in its
52:56 - terminology and its approach but
52:59 - ultimately its core it's actually kind
53:01 - of a simple idea
53:03 - and it has to do with this idea of tiles
53:08 - and not what i would like to call states
53:10 - although i don't know if this is
53:11 - entirely used as the proper term in the
53:15 - original algorithm itself and then the
53:17 - idea of collapsing these states
53:21 - um there's a term that comes up at in as
53:24 - entropy and this is from information
53:26 - theory it's sort of like one of these
53:27 - weird like nobody knows what entropy
53:29 - means so we'll just use entropy when we
53:31 - want to like sound like we're doing
53:33 - something smart
53:35 - but actually if you want to like learn
53:36 - more about entropy i would suggest to
53:38 - you three blue one browns videos about
53:40 - the wordle game which has some really
53:42 - interesting parallels to some things
53:44 - that are going on in wave function
53:46 - collapse i think but the idea here is
53:48 - that entropy we can think of as a term
53:52 - for the amount of information oh i know
53:54 - it i know it's a great example because i
53:56 - read about it in somebody's post online
54:00 - let's say we're playing sudoku
54:05 - and um
54:06 - how do you play sudoku
54:08 - i think you have nine by nine i mean
54:10 - well okay
54:12 - there's more
54:14 - i'm gonna fill in some okay all right
54:16 - all right let's say we're not playing
54:17 - sudoku
54:19 - we're designing a sudoku board
54:22 - and the idea of sudoku right is that
54:28 - we need to have all
54:29 - 10 digits 0 through 9 present and in
54:33 - columns and rows but i'm simplifying
54:35 - here let's just say it's like the
54:36 - simplest game of sudoku you could ever
54:38 - possibly play which is that i somehow
54:40 - need all 10 digits in this 3x3 grid
54:47 - so
54:48 - right now at present
54:50 - each grid has 10
54:52 - each cell has 10 possible states
54:55 - the entropy of any given cell right now
54:58 - is a measure of how many
55:03 - how many remaining state possibilities
55:06 - could go
55:07 - in that spot
55:08 - so right now every single cell has the
55:12 - same
55:13 - measure of entropy same amount of
55:15 - entropy
55:16 - 10 possible states
55:18 - if i were to put the an 8 here
55:22 - suddenly well the entropy goes down to
55:25 - nothing because this has been collapsed
55:27 - that's the idea of collapsing these
55:30 - range of possibilities down into one
55:33 - it's decided and then the entropy is
55:36 - less for all of the others because
55:38 - there's only nine possibilities left now
55:40 - this is again a very crude and
55:41 - simplistic example because there's not a
55:45 - lot of variations of the sort of span of
55:48 - possibilities across a larger space that
55:51 - you might have in a full sudoku game but
55:53 - you're starting at the idea of
55:56 - what does it mean
55:57 - to
55:58 - build a pattern out of tiles on a grid
56:01 - where each tile has a certain number of
56:04 - possible configurations that could go
56:06 - into it and as we start to place
56:09 - those tiles they reduce the number of
56:12 - possibilities in the neighboring tiles
56:14 - this to me is the way that i think of
56:16 - understanding the wave function collapse
56:19 - algorithm
56:21 - just taking a short break here
56:24 - nine left nine left one through nine oh
56:27 - you can't oh
56:29 - oh that whole explanation was wrong
56:35 - oh i'm the worst
56:37 - what is facetime street
56:41 - i didn't really like it anyway so oh
56:43 - geez
56:49 - so let me ask you all a question
56:52 - i i think i should use the i think i
56:54 - should use a different example anyway
56:55 - that was a little bit weird
56:58 - and you can see how i'm not going to get
56:59 - through this today
57:01 - so let me ask you a question
57:09 - let me ask you a question
57:11 - was that a reasonable explanation of
57:13 - entropy
57:14 - the um
57:16 - entropy in a state function
57:20 - uh well okay
57:24 - entropy oh what i'm looking for is
57:26 - information theory
57:29 - uh just to make sure i'm kind of
57:30 - describing this correctly
57:33 - uh
57:38 - i've been on this website many a time
57:41 - uh
57:42 - more generally quantify the information
57:44 - event a random variable um entry
57:46 - provides a measure of the average amount
57:47 - of information needed to represent an
57:49 - event drawn so that's like um
57:52 - um
57:55 - yeah this is uh
57:59 - average amount of information needed so
58:01 - higher entropy means more possibilities
58:04 - right
58:06 - right i got that right it was a spot-on
58:08 - explanation of entropy
58:11 - okay
58:12 - that's lucky i mean so i should i go for
58:14 - the sudoku thing again but obviously
58:16 - talk about the nine numbers not the ten
58:19 - i'm just so here's the thing i've been
58:21 - it's been like
58:23 - beaten into me over years and years and
58:25 - years
58:26 - of programming with a raise that i've
58:28 - got to talk about index values zero
58:30 - through nine which is a total of ten and
58:32 - i just like
58:33 - borked my brain there
58:37 - um
58:38 - all right
58:39 - um let's just try that again
58:46 - because that's not gonna go that's not
58:48 - gonna fly for uh
58:51 - it's a funny live stream moment but and
58:53 - we could
58:54 - oh also this looks a little blurry the
58:57 - whiteboard let me see if i can
58:59 - focus it a little bit better
59:06 - i think that's better
59:09 - let me have a look
59:11 - oh yeah that looks better
59:13 - why not use wordle oh yeah why not use
59:16 - wordle let's use wordle
59:18 - let's use wordle oh this is so exciting
59:21 - i can use wordplay
59:23 - all right
59:26 - the problem with wordle is i've been
59:29 - like ah is it like universally the thing
59:31 - is like i i'm going down a road of
59:35 - all right let's find let's use work
59:48 - i know the word all i think is two it's
59:50 - interesting
59:51 - it's too sophisticated like i'm gonna
59:53 - have to explain wordle so i got very
59:55 - excited about that but i think i should
59:57 - just stick with the sudoku um
60:02 - unnecessary close-up sorry about that
60:05 - 10 and no empty
60:07 - all right now now i'm still okay wordle
60:09 - is a great idea all right all right
60:11 - let's let's
60:12 - let's try it okay
60:14 - wordle has nothing to do you know what
60:16 - wordle is is is so related but i think
60:19 - sudoku is a little bit closer in the
60:22 - sense that
60:23 - um i think sudoku is maybe a bit more
60:26 - universally known
60:28 - um
60:30 - and i could actually i could make you
60:32 - know what i to make this more clear i
60:34 - think if i drew a slightly larger
60:38 - board
60:39 - it would actually make more sense so
60:41 - let's do that
60:42 - okay
60:47 - all right
60:49 - shoot see this is why i
60:52 - okay there's no way i'm getting
60:54 - finishing this today so i'm probably
60:56 - going to be redoing this anyway
60:58 - what time is it
61:04 - yes
61:08 - 10 45 okay 15 minutes here before i at
61:10 - least need a little break okay
61:13 - um
61:17 - let's take an example from
61:20 - let's take the classic game sudoku as an
61:23 - example
61:51 - that is basically the worst regular grid
61:53 - anybody has ever drawn in the history of
61:55 - youtube
61:56 - thank you
62:02 - the idea of sudoku is that we have a
62:05 - giant grid of numbers and any one of
62:08 - these cells in the grid could have a
62:10 - number one through nine in it
62:14 - and every single row every single column
62:17 - as well as every single three by three
62:22 - if i could draw this correctly oh put
62:24 - that in post every single three by three
62:29 - sub grid has all nine digits in it
62:32 - unique nine digits in it
62:35 - so
62:36 - how does this relate to wave function
62:38 - collapse and the concept of entropy
62:45 - entropy
62:46 - as i mention say this now i'm lost my
62:48 - rhythm of what i said before and not
62:50 - what's changing but alas
62:55 - entropy is a measure of the possibility
62:59 - space of every single one of these cells
63:07 - entropy in the information theory sense
63:11 - is a measure of the possibility space of
63:14 - every one of these cells
63:17 - so right now the entropy is uniform
63:20 - every cell could have nine possible
63:23 - digits in it if i were to start building
63:26 - a sudoku board i could just pick one
63:28 - randomly and pick a random number maybe
63:30 - i pick the number eight and i plop it in
63:33 - here
63:34 - now the entropy has changed for every
63:37 - single one of these cells remaining in
63:40 - this row and every single one of these
63:42 - cells remaining in this column as well
63:44 - as
63:45 - all of the cells in this top right three
63:49 - by three grid right they only have now
63:52 - eight possibilities left while the
63:54 - entropy for here is nine and if i were
63:56 - to put the number two here suddenly now
63:59 - the entropy is reduced for these cells
64:02 - so as the entropy goes down we have
64:05 - fewer fewer possible things that could
64:08 - fit in a given cell collapsing the cell
64:11 - is the act of picking its number its
64:14 - state it's done it's collapsed the goal
64:18 - of sudoku is to use information that you
64:22 - have gathered
64:23 - the entropy of every single state
64:27 - the entropy of every single cell
64:30 - start putting all the numbers around
64:32 - until you can
64:33 - solve it and if you find a
64:36 - cell suddenly that has no possibilities
64:39 - then you've done something wrong and you
64:40 - need to go backwards and try again this
64:43 - is exactly what i am going to attempt to
64:46 - do with the wave function collapse
64:48 - algorithm as applied to pixels
64:54 - what if instead of every tile in a so
64:59 - so if we take a graphics canvas
65:04 - that's say 400 by 400 pixels
65:08 - what if every single tile could have a
65:10 - particular color in it or a particular
65:13 - grouping of pixels a pattern so to speak
65:18 - [Music]
65:20 - what if i took that pattern from maybe
65:22 - this source image so what if i took this
65:24 - pattern just this little section of
65:27 - pixels
65:28 - and decided to put it here in the corner
65:31 - i've collapsed this one section of this
65:34 - particular image
65:37 - now if i could somehow based on
65:41 - collapsing this one reduce the entropy
65:44 - for its neighbors
65:47 - then i could select a particular tile
65:50 - maybe i only look at tiles that can go
65:53 - next
65:55 - if i
65:56 - if i've analyzed this image for what
65:59 - kind of patterns exist next to this one
66:02 - and only allowed me myself to pick those
66:05 - to either to put adjacent to this one
66:07 - then i could collapse those and it would
66:09 - ripple out i could keep collapsing
66:11 - others around it
66:16 - um
66:22 - okay um actually there is this
66:25 - amazing
66:25 - [Music]
66:27 - demo
66:38 - where is that it was sent to me
66:42 - shoot let's sit here
66:48 - hold on uh let me just find this in my
66:50 - direct messages
66:53 - um
66:57 - i i feel like i kind of botched that
66:58 - explanation but that's fine
67:00 - um
67:02 - just give me a second here
67:07 - hello discord where are you
67:16 - uh okay great
67:28 - all right i'm pulling this up
67:41 - this is an inter um
67:44 - ah right ah that's
67:47 - that's such a good dan writes in the
67:48 - chat
67:52 - um let me
67:53 - uh
67:54 - uh let me just read that entropy of
67:55 - certain cells will reduce which also
67:57 - causes the total entropy of the grid to
67:59 - reduce
68:00 - um
68:02 - so
68:06 - i'm just gonna sort of say that
68:11 - as the entropy of dif
68:14 - as the entropy of different cells is
68:16 - reduced the entropy of the total system
68:19 - also reduces until we find a solution
68:22 - and by the way this is exactly how you
68:25 - might approach an algorithm to solve
68:28 - sudoku or to solve the game wordle again
68:31 - check out three blue one brown's video
68:33 - on that this is just so related and it's
68:36 - got tentacles everywhere in the kind of
68:38 - stuff that i'm expecting if you're
68:39 - watching this video you're interested in
68:45 - this here is an incredible
68:47 - interactive demonstration of wave
68:50 - function collapse what it's showing is
68:53 - this source image these pixel tiles that
68:56 - you can find in the in sorry what it's
68:59 - showing is a source image divided into a
69:02 - set of tiles and each tile has neighbors
69:05 - next to it if i were to go here and pick
69:09 - like okay i want this particular okay
69:13 - sorry
69:14 - try this again
69:16 - don't forget thank you melissa
69:19 - no uh uh eight minutes i'm gonna do my
69:21 - i'm gonna take my short break okay
69:29 - when can i come back and finish this is
69:32 - the question i want to do this today i
69:34 - have to go though
69:36 - i mean i should check my messages a
69:37 - small chance i have something at
69:39 - noon there's a small chance
69:42 - uh
69:45 - um
69:46 - i don't see any of that um i'll check
69:49 - that again at 11 30 just to make sure my
69:51 - thing at noon is still happening okay
69:53 - okay
69:55 - this is an incredible interactive demo
69:57 - oscar stallberg this is an incredible
70:00 - interactive demonstration of the
70:01 - algorithm by oscar stahlberg
70:06 - yes i think i said that right
70:08 - we have a source image it has an entire
70:11 - set of tiles from that source image and
70:13 - we're going to build a larger image out
70:15 - of these same tiles shrunk down so i
70:19 - could start by picking any tile in the
70:23 - this image over to the right
70:24 - and
70:25 - copying over let's say i want to copy
70:27 - over this solid brownish tile
70:31 - and i want to do that in this one so i
70:34 - hover over that tile and i select it
70:37 - now
70:39 - because i selected
70:42 - why did it make the tiles below it brown
70:45 - i would have thought that wouldn't be
70:46 - possible
70:48 - because
70:51 - this would
70:53 - it allows it to repeat itself
70:56 - wait a second somebody explain this to
70:58 - me because i
71:03 - right i mean so for example if i were
71:05 - redoing the recreating the image i would
71:07 - pick this one
71:09 - and then now i have a reduced set of
71:11 - possibilities like i could pick this one
71:14 - and then i could pick this one why did
71:16 - this oh that makes sense
71:19 - why then that would be that but why
71:20 - underneath
71:22 - because wouldn't it show this one
71:24 - underneath
71:25 - what am i missing
71:27 - um what do these numbers mean oh
71:32 - let's see
71:35 - that's the number of the what do these
71:37 - numbers mean
71:42 - huh
71:50 - uh
71:55 - does anybody
71:58 - wait a second here let me zoom in here
72:00 - oh no this is different now so this is
72:02 - showing
72:04 - the possible the possible time i'm
72:06 - imagining these are the possible things
72:08 - that can be below it
72:10 - and how do i know which is the id for
72:12 - this like this is just saying
72:15 - the same one everywhere
72:17 - i'm so confused
72:23 - i'm looking at the chat there's no block
72:25 - that has brown on top and something else
72:27 - on bottom
72:29 - the numbers are color codes
72:32 - um
72:35 - what am i missing here
72:42 - oh it's the hex colors
72:44 - i don't think so
72:47 - right i thought okay let me reset this
72:54 - so let's say i pick
72:56 - this particular tile
73:01 - i'm so confused
73:03 - is it not actually is this a pre maybe
73:05 - this is a
73:08 - pre
73:11 - generated
73:15 - um
73:24 - um
73:31 - maybe it's not actually pulling the
73:33 - adjacencies or or is it using the
73:37 - or they're actually smaller
73:40 - because is it's actually do is this
73:42 - doing the overlapping method in which
73:43 - case like it's not visually exactly this
73:52 - it enforces matching colors across cell
73:55 - boundaries
73:56 - oh is that all it's doing
73:58 - so it's just looking for
74:01 - a cell that has the same color on the
74:03 - other side i see
74:06 - um check discord okay thanks simon uh
74:14 - uh
74:20 - the only possibility if there's a solid
74:22 - brown anywhere if there's a solid brown
74:24 - below oh
74:25 - okay so um
74:32 - um so yeah i think this is doing a
74:35 - slightly different method than in my
74:37 - head i was imagining
74:39 - which is that
74:41 - um
74:43 - it is
74:46 - actually matching
74:50 - uh this is pretty interesting this is
74:52 - like a different way of doing it which
74:54 - is really cool which is that it's
74:57 - actually just listing the color that's
74:59 - on this border
75:01 - and then
75:03 - the only things that can go above it are
75:07 - so like for this particular tile i got
75:09 - it
75:10 - the only thing for this tile the only
75:13 - things that can go below it are
75:16 - anything
75:17 - uh that's brown so this tile by the way
75:20 - has to have a brown tile above it to the
75:24 - left and to the right so it can have
75:26 - this it can have another oh i got it now
75:29 - oh wow i should implement it like this
75:33 - this is cool this is not the way i was
75:35 - thinking of doing it and simon is
75:37 - pointing out
75:38 - uh it's been about an hour okay i know
75:40 - thank you al everyone's reminding me
75:42 - simon is pointing out like i was going
75:44 - to so the post that i was looking at
75:46 - yesterday on my twitch stream
75:48 - which um
75:55 - um which is this one is a really
75:58 - excellent post
75:59 - and it proposes first there is a simpler
76:02 - version of this idea
76:05 - which um
76:07 - uh i was looking for a particular which
76:09 - is actually on sorry this page
76:12 - which is just looking at um this idea of
76:16 - a
76:17 - tile map generation okay so that's
76:20 - actually
76:22 - that's what
76:23 - so maybe i should do it this way
76:26 - which is what um
76:30 - all right okay
76:32 - so here's the deal
76:36 - there's the idea of the wave function
76:38 - collapse and i i'm clearly coming back
76:40 - and doing this another day
76:42 - but let's see how this keeps going but
76:45 - this is hopefully useful for all of you
76:46 - we're here in the moment let's just be
76:48 - here in the moment together and not
76:49 - worry about this video later that i want
76:51 - to make this is all part of the process
76:53 - and even if i just do a little bit today
76:54 - i might if i inspire you to like try it
76:57 - on your own or you want to send me some
76:59 - tips after and i'll come back and do it
77:00 - more all that's great
77:02 - so um but what i want to say is that i i
77:07 - there are two versions of this algorithm
77:10 - one which is just using straight tiles
77:14 - and one which is using overlapping tiles
77:18 - um
77:19 - and i think there's like very specific
77:21 - terms for these which i might not be
77:22 - getting exactly right
77:23 - and the idea of the straight tiles is
77:26 - more like sudoku
77:28 - in the sense that there are i have nine
77:31 - possible kind of like tiles and when i
77:33 - put one there it uh it reduces the
77:37 - possibilities i could go next to it
77:38 - because only certain possibilities can
77:40 - go next to it and typically like um in
77:44 - this particular demonstration
77:47 - uh which is not this one
77:50 - which is
77:51 - uh this one we might have some
77:53 - essentially pre-configured set of tiles
77:56 - with a list of possible neighbors
77:59 - um and that's
78:02 - this is um this is a nice way of do this
78:05 - is
78:06 - this is a
78:07 - a simpler way to do it
78:10 - but the issue with this
78:12 - is you've got to pre-design
78:16 - what the tiles and rules are i mean
78:18 - maybe i could analyze the last with in
78:21 - this one i could analyze the last row of
78:23 - pixel last column or row of pixels to
78:26 - match but essentially i've got to build
78:29 - a json file or i think there's like
78:31 - examples of like xml files that list all
78:34 - the tiles and what their neighbors are
78:36 - whereas the overlapping model uh what it
78:40 - does is it takes an image and scans it
78:44 - and
78:45 - builds an array of tiles and then looks
78:48 - at neighbors and the reason why it's
78:49 - called overlapping is because we're not
78:51 - we're in addition to like taking this
78:53 - tile and looking at what's next to it
78:55 - we'll just move one pixel over and take
78:58 - this tile usually they're like three by
79:00 - three or whatever and then look at the
79:01 - one next to it as well
79:04 - so
79:07 - i i was all set
79:09 - yesterday to be like okay i've read this
79:11 - i should just do the simple tiled model
79:13 - and then part two our coding challenge
79:16 - uh
79:17 - a kodi challenge follow-up would be to
79:18 - then do the overlapping model which
79:20 - yields you more exciting i was like kind
79:23 - of like oh can i take a picture of this
79:24 - shirt
79:26 - and use it as like the tile generator um
79:30 - so
79:30 - uh the overlapping model is what you
79:33 - what sort of like feels more like magic
79:35 - because you just feed it an input and it
79:37 - analyzes it whereas the tiling model is
79:39 - more like i'm a game designer and i want
79:41 - to have like a
79:43 - a world that has you know each cell
79:45 - could be it's a 2d world and it could be
79:47 - brick
79:49 - if i'm building like a platformer game
79:50 - it could be brick or wall or like i
79:53 - don't know what the pieces would be so
79:55 - maybe what i need to do
79:58 - in order to do this video properly
80:01 - is actually design
80:03 - a set of tiles or use a pre-existing set
80:06 - of tiles because now i fully understand
80:09 - and this demonstration is so awesome i
80:12 - was playing with this last night and i
80:14 - don't think i really understood it i
80:16 - just was enjoying playing with it and
80:17 - now i do and this is just incredible
80:20 - like if i
80:21 - do this
80:23 - like look at all the different possible
80:25 - configurations that come out just from
80:27 - this particular design
80:30 - um
80:31 - and
80:33 - um
80:34 - so um uh justin writes i'm looking at
80:37 - this from a game dev procedural dungeon
80:39 - generator
80:41 - um
80:42 - and simon is saying for tiled models you
80:45 - can make models where you scan an
80:46 - example image it's kind of like the game
80:48 - of life
80:49 - uh every tile is a single pixel
80:53 - so we could do you know that will work
80:55 - also
80:56 - um just so i could scan an image and
80:58 - have every especially if the image had
81:00 - limited colors like if this is a full
81:02 - color image
81:04 - with
81:05 - each tile could be a single pixel that's
81:06 - kind of an interesting way of doing it
81:08 - and then it only can have certain pixels
81:10 - next to it
81:12 - all right
81:17 - i'm gonna have to come so i'm hoping
81:18 - that this introduction is giving you
81:20 - something
81:22 - um i'm gonna talk about brilliant in a
81:25 - moment and take a short break uh and
81:27 - then come back and i'll have about a
81:28 - half an hour or so left
81:30 - and i sort of think about
81:32 - what i'm going to do but clearly this
81:34 - was a um
81:36 - as i expected
81:38 - is not going to in the next half an hour
81:41 - lead to the full implementation of this
81:44 - so
81:45 - um
81:47 - let me um
81:49 - i'm gonna do
81:50 - a break will be good for all of us it'll
81:52 - help me do some thinking about this and
81:53 - i'll read your comments in the chat but
81:56 - since you're all here with me
81:59 - let me tell you about today's sponsor
82:03 - [Music]
82:05 - brilliant
82:06 - i talked about brilliant to the
82:07 - beginning of the live stream i don't
82:08 - know if you were there or not so i'm
82:10 - going to repeat myself a little bit
82:12 - i make videos about different algorithms
82:14 - and concepts from math and science and
82:17 - art and all sorts of related topics and
82:20 - you watch them and maybe you try to make
82:21 - something after watching them that's a
82:23 - way to learn and the important part of
82:25 - that is you trying it and so brilliant
82:28 - is i think the perfect companion
82:30 - complement to the stuff that i do here
82:32 - on the coding train in the sense that it
82:34 - is a website full i'm going to just pull
82:36 - up a video of one of them this is the
82:38 - logic course it is a full of just many
82:41 - different courses around algorithms and
82:43 - computer science and math and physics
82:46 - and all of these topics and you get to
82:48 - actually try stuff like you could learn
82:50 - code without knowing the syntax by
82:53 - pseudo code and manipulating
82:56 - different kind of problems so learning
82:58 - logic learning algorithm fundamentals in
83:01 - it through interactive lessons is just a
83:02 - wonderful way to learn
83:04 - i always have to mention
83:06 - um the neural network course which just
83:10 - like you know if i could imagine the
83:13 - perfect
83:14 - like demonstration of the act the visual
83:18 - activity of a neural network of
83:20 - different videos that i've done using
83:22 - neural networks would be what's right
83:23 - here in this brilliant course and so if
83:25 - you want a nice companion if you're
83:27 - learning about machine learning you've
83:28 - been watching some videos you've been
83:29 - trying some python libraries maybe
83:31 - you've tried ml5.js you want to get
83:33 - deeper into some of these concepts the
83:35 - neural network course on brilliant would
83:36 - be great for you and sorry that it went
83:38 - to a black screen there um let me just
83:41 - go back to my computer and pull up
83:44 - brilliant i think that i'm logged in
83:46 - uh i am logged in um and um actually i
83:51 - was looking today at um so let me just
83:54 - quickly scan the courses so you can see
83:57 - you know there's so many uh you know
83:59 - whenever i'm looking for a new idea for
84:01 - a coding challenge i have this
84:03 - a list of ideas like a lot of them are
84:04 - now coming from brilliant especially
84:06 - this beautiful geometry course
84:08 - the logic course i referenced um it's
84:11 - great for parents teachers you know i've
84:12 - been actually looking at this with my
84:14 - kids which has been fun but i did
84:15 - actually notice
84:17 - oh it was i guess i don't know this nine
84:20 - plus i don't know why this popped up
84:21 - when i was looking at it the other day
84:23 - because this is an older one but um
84:27 - oh and i wonder if this also but there's
84:28 - a lot of stuff that deals with entropy
84:30 - and information theory like this one so
84:32 - this is a challenge right it's possible
84:34 - to arrange five square tiles in numbers
84:36 - one two three four five into a plus so
84:38 - the sum of the three tile column and the
84:39 - sum of the three tile row are both equal
84:41 - to nine
84:43 - let's think about this for a second
84:46 - if they have to equal to 9 the total
84:50 - of all the tiles
84:52 - would it be 18 no
84:54 - because there's a tile that is repeated
84:59 - so
85:01 - the the total of is 18 plus 18 which is
85:06 - 36
85:11 - well
85:12 - the three has to go in the center right
85:14 - because if i put the two in the center
85:18 - there's no way i can make
85:19 - uh a nine like five and one is like to
85:23 - get
85:24 - to get nine i've got to do
85:27 - uh four
85:28 - and
85:30 - like
85:30 - four and three
85:32 - and then i can't get nine like the only
85:34 - way
85:36 - uh to get nine is to put three in the
85:38 - center
85:39 - four and two
85:41 - because six and six
85:43 - because i need six and six
85:49 - uh plus yeah i'm like having trouble
85:51 - explaining why this is my brain was
85:53 - working it out but do you see the
85:55 - connection to entropy
85:57 - right so like right now in theory
86:00 - without thinking about any of the rules
86:02 - of the system the entropy
86:05 - uh is uh you know measure would be five
86:09 - possibilities for every cell but if i
86:11 - look at the rules the entropy of the
86:13 - center cell is not the same as the
86:16 - others there's only one possibility it's
86:18 - three and now i've reduced the entropy
86:21 - down to two
86:22 - for each of the other
86:24 - the other cell so you know i could put
86:27 - um
86:28 - a two here
86:29 - and then that means a four has to have
86:31 - to collapse this to a four or if i put a
86:33 - four here this would have to collapse
86:35 - did i get this right let's just make
86:36 - sure i mean
86:40 - try it yourself by dragging the five
86:42 - number tiles into the plus i've made
86:46 - oh correct i guess i i did it and just
86:49 - marked it as correct
86:51 - um
86:53 - explanation let's look at this
86:55 - the sum of the row in the column is 18
86:57 - and the sum of all the ti oh i i'm such
87:00 - an idiot i'm not i'm not an idiot i'm
87:01 - learning see it's don't don't say that
87:04 - don't be like me don't say that to
87:06 - yourself
87:07 - you
87:08 - are doing your best and trying and we're
87:10 - all figuring this stuff out did you see
87:12 - how i messed up sudoku earlier and i
87:14 - said there were 10 numbers
87:16 - um so uh yes of course
87:20 - adding up all of these gets 15 but i
87:23 - have to have 9 plus 9 is 18 18 minus 15
87:27 - is 3 so 3 has to go in the center so
87:30 - it's so lovely to see then to try it
87:32 - yourself to figure it out puzzle it out
87:35 - even if you're just doing it sort of
87:36 - through intuition or some strange
87:38 - methodology and then see the explanation
87:41 - so uh if you're if you find this
87:43 - interesting if you're enjoying this

88:08 - might be the most effective use of the
88:10 - next 30 to 35 minutes
88:13 - um and i will be back in um well i guess
88:18 - i'm gonna be back in four four minutes
88:21 - okay let's put on some intermission
88:23 - music
88:26 - i'm going to give you this mute my
88:28 - microphone
88:31 - [Music]
89:46 - ah
89:47 - sorry the music is muted because i'm in
89:50 - the wrong
89:52 - in this view all right let me just go to
89:54 - here
89:55 - so now it's this is the intermission you
89:56 - i'll pipe the audio from the music
90:00 - into that view later but also
90:02 - it's nice
90:04 - i put up a poll
90:06 - uh
90:07 - i see everybody's voting for a make up a
90:09 - tiling system i really should pick the
90:10 - red
90:12 - i
90:13 - shouldn't have made them
90:15 - i shouldn't have made
90:17 - [Music]
90:20 - i should have made the pull because i
90:22 - really feel like i should pick the
90:23 - sticker
90:24 - but
90:25 - we'll see
90:30 - [Music]
90:40 - do
90:46 - [Music]
91:08 - so
91:12 - [Music]
91:23 - [Music]
91:51 - [Music]
92:02 - all right um
92:06 - thank you again brilliant
92:07 - [Music]
92:35 - all right we're asking some questions
92:38 - here
92:39 - [Music]
92:44 - you're all hearing me and watching this
92:46 - right now okay so sorry i i'm looking
92:48 - over here because that's where i have my
92:49 - monitor for the chat what does make
92:51 - sticker winner mean so i can understand
92:53 - why you're probably not interested in
92:54 - the
92:55 - me picking the sticker winners because
92:57 - you know the number of you who might
92:58 - have entered to win the stickers through
93:00 - the survey is
93:01 - i think i'll just do that i'll i'll do
93:04 - that separately i'll just like twitch
93:06 - stream for like 15 minutes and do it i
93:08 - just i don't know why but i'm like hung
93:09 - up on the fact that i want people to
93:11 - believe that i'm legitimately picking
93:13 - them randomly i guess you know
93:18 - but so so i'll do that i'll do that just
93:20 - on the twitch stream um
93:22 - uh there is a little bit of an interest
93:25 - in the bot stuff
93:27 - so and i have exactly 30 minutes ish
93:30 - left
93:32 - um
93:37 - um
93:39 - i'm just
93:41 - checking
93:43 - if
93:46 - um
93:50 - oh
93:52 - uh
93:59 - um sorry i'm
94:02 - just checking to make sure
94:05 - there's a small chance that what i have
94:07 - to do
94:08 - although uh would be
94:10 - cancelled or changed so i'm just
94:13 - checking that but that doesn't seem to
94:14 - have happened okay
94:16 - so i'm to end this poll because i'm i'm
94:18 - getting uh
94:19 - the idea of it
94:21 - um and i'm just looking at the chat
94:25 - um
94:30 - um all right so let me come back over
94:33 - here to the computer
94:34 - oops
94:35 - so
94:36 - i i think it would make sense for me to
94:39 - just keep going down this road of
94:42 - generating a tile system
94:45 - and um
94:48 - i mean in a weird sort of way i almost
94:50 - want to just like copy this exactly but
94:53 - um
94:56 - but let me look here
94:57 - like i kind of want to just use
95:00 - one of these existing ones just to
95:03 - understand
95:05 - okay
95:14 - i'm trying to understand these
95:16 - because i i think it would help me to
95:18 - like do the algorithm
95:20 - if i were to pick an existing example
95:25 - the tiles have the same symmetry as
95:27 - their assigned letters
95:29 - or in other words what's fascinating
95:31 - about this by the way is i do a lot of
95:33 - teaching about markov chains with text
95:36 - and
95:37 - always comes up like well how could you
95:38 - do a markov chain in two dimensions with
95:41 - pixels this is essentially that
95:44 - and i i can't believe that i never
95:45 - really sort of made that connection
95:47 - before
95:48 - um
95:49 - what is this
95:53 - oh this is just
95:54 - showing it running
95:57 - but what i'm trying to understand is
96:02 - tiles have the same symmetry as their
96:03 - assigned letters
96:07 - with the systems enough to enumerate
96:09 - pairs of adjacent tiles only up to
96:11 - symmetry
96:13 - which makes lists of adjacencies for
96:15 - tile sets with many symmetrical tiles
96:18 - even the summer tile set okay
96:21 - like this is what i'm trying to
96:22 - understand here
96:24 - i see that these are the three possible
96:26 - tiles
96:28 - oh they're rotations also i'm like how
96:32 - could you get the
96:33 - the top and the bottom because of
96:34 - rotations
96:36 - and the adjacencies are ah
96:41 - however it's rotated
96:47 - um
96:49 - i just don't see what are the
96:50 - adjacencies why are we not seeing like
96:53 - the full enumeration of the adjacencies
96:59 - um chris ray asks to briefly explain the
97:02 - tile for the type topic for the new
97:04 - arrivals uh i'm not gonna be able to
97:05 - briefly explain it but it is uh this
97:07 - algorithm called wave function collapse
97:09 - and it is explained here and through
97:12 - other links i should have added them to
97:13 - the video description i apologize but
97:15 - you'll find a ton of resources here
97:18 - um but i'm just trying to understand
97:21 - um
97:23 - okay
97:30 - all right let me
97:32 - let me try to enumerate i like this one
97:36 - oddly enough
97:38 - so let me try to
97:43 - could generate a set of marching squares
97:46 - yeah i know i could generate an example
97:48 - image and do all the tiles that way i i
97:50 - just have very little time
97:52 - so i right now i'm just looking at kind
97:55 - of trying to just use this time to read
97:57 - and research a bit more like i'm gonna
97:59 - have to come back and implement this but
98:02 - i just want to try to understand exactly
98:05 - how this works so let's look at this one
98:09 - because i feel like this one
98:11 - is going to help us understand i'm
98:13 - actually going to go to
98:16 - this particular view
98:19 - so that we can kind of see
98:22 - all of this at the same time as i go
98:24 - over to the whiteboard okay
98:27 - so and and in case you're just tuning in
98:30 - this stream is going to wrap up in the
98:32 - next 15 to 20 minutes
98:34 - um i started kind of this coding
98:37 - challenge
98:38 - it's gonna take me longer
98:41 - but i feel like this is such an
98:43 - important and valuable topic for people
98:46 - interested in the sort of creative
98:48 - coding space
98:49 - that
98:50 - me dedicating multiple live streams to
98:52 - it and
98:54 - having a lot of material to use to edit
98:56 - together
98:58 - for a sort of condensed video about it
99:01 - it's worth the investment of time
99:03 - and i apologize to for
99:06 - the sort of limits that i have right now
99:08 - um
99:09 - so let's look at these two tiles i'm
99:12 - going to try to redraw them here
99:15 - so here one is essentially well
99:18 - one is blank or gray but we'll call it a
99:20 - blank and the other one
99:22 - it looks like
99:24 - this
99:27 - and i didn't dry sorry i didn't dry the
99:29 - whiteboard
99:30 - effectively enough and it's uh okay
99:34 - just
99:38 - try this again
99:39 - okay the two tiles i'm just going to put
99:41 - them over here
99:43 - i can't remember them but i can see them
99:47 - look like this
99:50 - and then another one is just blank so
99:52 - what i want to understand is
99:56 - if i have
99:59 - this particular tile this one
100:09 - what are the possible tiles that could
100:11 - go
100:12 - here
100:14 - here
100:15 - and all the adjacencies
100:22 - and there's only two possible tiles
100:24 - so clearly
100:28 - what the only possible tile that could
100:30 - go here is
100:32 - the blank one i drew a larger space
100:34 - thinking there might be multiple ones
100:36 - ah but here
100:39 - they have rotations so
100:42 - the tiles that could go here would be
100:48 - could be this
100:49 - but it could also be
100:51 - i'm drawing this in such a weird way
100:54 - so
100:56 - it could be this right
100:58 - so i think i want to try to draw i have
101:00 - a better idea of how to draw this
101:12 - so this
101:14 - only has one possibility this
101:17 - has two possibilities
101:29 - my drawing is kind of terrible
101:31 - right over here
101:35 - we have
101:40 - there's three possibilities right
101:44 - we could have
101:47 - this
101:52 - we could have
101:57 - this
101:59 - or we could have
102:05 - this right
102:09 - and then here
102:11 - is
102:13 - the exact same two possibilities is up
102:15 - there
102:24 - i mean if i didn't allow for rotations
102:28 - there has to be rotations
102:34 - so if i were building a grid of them and
102:38 - if it were just
102:39 - oh i didn't
102:40 - this markers died
102:52 - i need
102:55 - i'm sorry that i'm not looking at the
102:56 - chat right now this is one of the things
102:58 - i want to do is buy some extra monitors
103:01 - and things so i can sort of see the chat
103:02 - over here
103:03 - but um
103:06 - if i'm building this just making sure
103:08 - everyone can see me if i'm building
103:10 - a grid
103:14 - and i put this
103:16 - in the center we'll call this tile a
103:18 - if a goes in the center
103:20 - the entropy of
103:23 - like these
103:26 - i mean right now like is one
103:29 - two two
103:30 - three right
103:32 - so am i understanding the system
103:35 - correctly
103:38 - the first tile is a aaa b and the second
103:41 - is bbb
103:44 - interesting
103:47 - oh right so
103:50 - it would make more sense if i wanted to
103:52 - do this
103:54 - for me to think of it like
103:56 - uh to think of it like the oscar
103:59 - stalberg example
104:02 - where
104:04 - here are all the possible tiles okay
104:08 - i've got a better idea now sorry
104:10 - everybody
104:11 - okay so see i this is why i wanted to
104:13 - work this out
104:16 - oh racing everything is such a mess
104:19 - okay
104:21 - but i i appreciate all of you so much in
104:24 - tuning in and experiencing this with me
104:28 - because
104:30 - it's this is one of those things this is
104:31 - one of my favorite kind of algorithms
104:33 - that is so incredibly simple
104:36 - conceptually in you know in a manner of
104:38 - speaking
104:39 - but um
104:44 - is
104:47 - much harder
104:49 - to implement
104:51 - because of all the different parts and
104:53 - moving pieces but now i have an idea
104:55 - now i understand
104:57 - let's look at all actually all the
104:59 - possible tiles
105:01 - okay oh i really want to program this
105:03 - now
105:05 - it'll have to come later
105:07 - another time next time i'm
105:10 - i think i'm really kind of ready for
105:11 - this and i'm all right so look
105:19 - let's look at all the possible tiles
105:22 - this is so much simpler than i than i
105:24 - had
105:36 - and
105:39 - uh
105:44 - and then so there are five possible
105:46 - tiles
105:47 - essentially like we could think of them
105:49 - as rotations but let's not even do that
105:51 - right now let's just think of them as
105:53 - five
105:54 - so
105:56 - um
106:00 - and then let's think about the what what
106:02 - can match
106:04 - here so
106:05 - the
106:06 - the
106:07 - the side of a tile is either blank
106:10 - or it is
106:12 - a
106:13 - i know what to call this like a pipe a
106:15 - connection so we could call the blank a
106:24 - and the connection
106:25 - b
106:41 - and if i'm going to if i'm going to take
106:44 - a given tile
106:48 - like this one let's say i put this tile
106:50 - first
106:53 - and it's an a
106:54 - connection on all sides
106:57 - i the only things that can go here
107:01 - would be this
107:02 - or that because i need a tile with an a
107:06 - on the right
107:07 - and the only things that could go here
107:09 - are this tile or this one because i need
107:12 - an a connection on the top so i could
107:15 - have each one of these as a little image
107:18 - that i load and then i could have like a
107:20 - json file that basically for every image
107:23 - has an array of possible things that
107:25 - could go
107:27 - i could totally program this now if i
107:30 - had a little bit more time
107:32 - but this makes sense to me now
107:35 - and this is exactly what we're seeing
107:38 - in
107:41 - this particular demonstration it's just
107:44 - more
107:44 - uh sophisticated
107:46 - the top of the tee can butt up against
107:49 - each other too
107:59 - i'm trying to understand that the
108:01 - top of the t can butt up against each
108:04 - other too
108:08 - um
108:12 - oh yes yes
108:14 - yes i didn't see that
108:16 - great so
108:23 - this one
108:27 - can also like
108:30 - if i were had this this side could
108:32 - connect to here
108:34 - or this tile oh i want to do this so bad
108:36 - what time is it
108:40 - okay it is 11 30.
108:43 - oh that's way too much time
108:45 - uh
108:47 - right the tricky part is not the
108:48 - algorithm but all the data structures
108:50 - involved
108:53 - yeah i i actually to me this is very
108:56 - feels very doable because
108:58 - um it
109:00 - it's you're right there's not like some
109:03 - really
109:04 - it's not like okay let's look at back
109:06 - propagation okay well we need to
109:08 - let's talk about partial derivatives
109:10 - like looking at a neural network and how
109:12 - it's trained and the weights are
109:13 - adjusted like there's a lot of
109:16 - math
109:17 - uh and concepts that
109:20 - might be completely unfamiliar to you or
109:22 - like in my case things that i studied
109:24 - and maybe felt
109:28 - little bit of conf not kind of
109:30 - an understanding of but it's been uh 30
109:33 - years
109:35 - i'm old
109:37 - um but this
109:39 - is like a really fun kid's puzzle
109:44 - and in fact
109:45 - it would be really cool to do
109:48 - like to print this out
109:51 - and to actually do make a physical
109:54 - version of this as part of a video
109:58 - um
109:59 - so
110:01 - i don't know what to do with these 15
110:04 - minutes but i think
110:08 - um one thing i could do i'm just curious
110:12 - is
110:15 - i know i really want to make a version
110:17 - that analyzes an image for the tiles but
110:19 - now i'm back to thinking
110:22 - that it would be really nice to just
110:25 - start with some prefab tiles and a list
110:28 - of what goes with what
110:31 - let me take a let me take a minute to go
110:34 - down this road
110:35 - before i really have to go
110:37 - so are these is this like one image
110:44 - okay oh
110:45 - yeah
110:48 - um
110:50 - i don't know why this one is really cool
110:53 - too
110:54 - this one really appeals to me i can't
110:55 - exactly explain it oh this wait a second
110:58 - this is just one tile i love that
111:03 - we could do the one tile version that is
111:06 - wild
111:10 - uh
111:11 - that is wild
111:14 - sorry everybody for the spam in the chat
111:17 - um and i appreciate thank you alca who i
111:20 - see with um
111:21 - um i'm always we're always looking for
111:23 - additional people who can help um
111:24 - moderate um you'd want to join the
111:26 - discord and get in touch there
111:28 - um and there's sort of a process for
111:30 - that but um so i don't mean to just say
111:31 - like oh just tell me your name and i'll
111:33 - make you a moderator but um
111:37 - how about generating some square images
111:40 - so yeah
111:42 - let's go
111:43 - to p5 web editor
111:47 - and
111:50 - let's just look at very briefly
111:53 - how i might generate these images so i'm
111:56 - going to make a really small
111:58 - canvas that's 50 by 50.
112:02 - and
112:04 - let's move this over a bit whoops sorry
112:09 - i gotta i gotta just get rid of my
112:11 - discord because it has all these direct
112:12 - messages and things
112:14 - um okay so i'm sorry that i'm about to
112:16 - run out of time
112:19 - this is
112:20 - the one thing about street
112:22 - never mind okay
112:24 - uh i just like i i marvel sometimes
112:26 - about how if i were teaching a class at
112:29 - nyu which i'm on sabbatical right now i
112:31 - like obsessively prepare for like days
112:34 - like over prepare way over over prepared
112:38 - yeah here i am streaming on youtube too
112:40 - what is essentially a uh
112:42 - audience have a much larger magnitude
112:44 - than the 12 to 16 students i guess the
112:46 - tuition at nyu is kernel it's kind of uh
112:49 - expensive
112:51 - um
112:52 - all right sorry i got off track there so
112:55 - um let's try let's try making some of
112:56 - these tiles uh
113:00 - let's let's make the data i just want to
113:01 - make the data structure
113:05 - so what's a good
113:08 - uh
113:09 - just trying to think of how to
113:11 - i know simon you would tell me to
113:12 - automate this but i kind of want to do
113:14 - this manually just for right now
113:16 - all right let me try to recreate
113:20 - uh i think i want two two tiles
113:23 - uh where is that
113:29 - the thing is i could just
113:32 - make these images in photoshop i should
113:34 - be able to code them right look at this
113:36 - um what am i doing
113:38 - which one did i say i like i don't know
113:39 - why i'm obsessed with this one
113:42 - so let's try this one although
113:44 - um
113:48 - okay okay
113:50 - i could do this sorry i
113:52 - i the thing is i'm looking at the clock
113:54 - and thinking and you don't even see my
113:55 - computer i'm sorry the one tile version
113:58 - looks like a recent number file video
113:59 - yeah it's kind of amazing how this is
114:01 - like ten print actually
114:03 - also
114:04 - um
114:06 - um okay so
114:08 - sorry that i was um let's okay so let's
114:11 - let's just look at how i would generate
114:12 - a tile um
114:28 - and let's do
114:30 - um
114:33 - oh hold on let me turn
114:34 - now we're going to do a background
114:38 - actually you know i should do this let's
114:40 - i should do this with
114:43 - create graphics
114:50 - um
114:57 - and let me make this much bigger so you
114:58 - can see it a little bit better
115:04 - and um
115:06 - put on auto refresh
115:08 - uh
115:13 - so this this is going to wrap up in just
115:15 - a second but i just want to
115:18 - give you an idea of how i might go about
115:20 - doing this
115:24 - all right now i'm sorry simon is so
115:27 - right i always listen to simon everybody
115:29 - i should just draw
115:30 - an image and then like pull out the
115:32 - tiles but i'm going to do it this way
115:34 - just for a second here
115:38 - um
115:45 - i'll make the second tile
116:02 - uh and
116:04 - um
116:13 - okay eventually
116:15 - what
116:23 - is there some weird pixel density issue
116:28 - no
116:33 - oh no i know why i'm
116:38 - and these aren't with and height they
116:39 - start oh god
116:46 - i'm trying to do the most simple thing
116:48 - ever and i couldn't get it okay i made
116:50 - two tiles everybody
116:53 - hurry please
116:55 - thank you half and half
116:57 - um
117:00 - oh there's a new number file video about
117:02 - stitch patterns that's cool
117:04 - um
117:07 - sorry
117:09 - okay tile one tile two now
117:13 - um
117:14 - let's say
117:17 - in tile two now
117:19 - i wanna draw i'm gonna say rect mode
117:25 - tile to rex mode
117:28 - center
117:31 - tile to
117:33 - fill i'm just going to kind of
117:35 - use a green color
117:37 - tile 2 stroke
117:39 - 0 tile 2 stroke
117:45 - stroke weight
117:47 - 4
117:49 - and then rectangle
117:51 - um
117:53 - tile to width times 0.5
117:57 - tile to height
118:02 - um what did i miss here uh zero uh
118:08 - uh oh yeah no yeah tile two height
118:12 - times zero point five
118:14 - this is very silly what i'm doing
118:17 - but because let me just hard code this
118:19 - because these numbers are getting kind
118:21 - of crazy it's just 100 by 100 to people
118:24 - 50 50 25 50. okay
118:28 - um oh tile2.rex
118:34 - oh and
118:37 - it's a hundred what am i what's wrong
118:39 - with me the height is 100
118:42 - and if i make it a little bit bigger
118:46 - yes i made two tiles everybody
118:50 - two tiles
118:57 - i have my soundboard back i gotta use it
118:58 - for something
119:02 - thank you everybody thank you welcome to
119:04 - the coding train where i stream for two
119:06 - hours to make a green stripe in a p5
119:09 - jazz sketch
119:11 - now
119:17 - just just showing you how
119:20 - i can have auto refresh on it's saving a
119:22 - lot of files
119:25 - uh let's go to
119:27 - uh this
119:31 - but i don't need to save it because
119:35 - oh i really wish i had more time so i
119:38 - made this even simpler because this is
119:40 - only going to produce vertical stripes
119:45 - because
119:46 - you'll see in a second but the rules now
119:49 - are let's try to imagine this data
119:51 - structure
119:52 - and i think there's specific terminology
119:54 - that if i re-read the wave function
119:57 - collapse
119:58 - algorithm page i'll have a better sense
120:00 - of but let's just call this i'm going to
120:02 - call this like
120:04 - the wfc
120:08 - and we have
120:11 - basically
120:12 - tile one
120:17 - so i can make this an array of arrays
120:21 - but i think i want a lookup table
120:24 - so i'm gonna have let's see i'm just
120:26 - gonna think about this
120:28 - tile one
120:32 - has four edges
120:36 - and
120:38 - um
120:43 - all right hold on how would i want to do
120:45 - this so like what if i had
120:49 - an array
120:52 - and each array had
120:54 - an object in it
120:57 - that had the tile
121:00 - the
121:01 - adjacencies like
121:03 - what would i call this the adjacencies
121:08 - j
121:08 - jacket
121:10 - which would be
121:14 - tile 1
121:18 - is
121:19 - the first one
121:21 - and that's the image so i should say
121:23 - image
121:26 - i should call these image one image and
121:28 - the adjacencies i could say are
121:31 - four arrays
121:36 - of what could go
121:39 - of what is possible
121:42 - uh i think there's a sort of convention
121:44 - like this reminds me what was that video
121:46 - i did about sort of like northwest so
121:48 - north east south west
121:52 - i mean we could do something with
121:53 - diagonals sorry my nose is running
122:03 - um
122:05 - so
122:06 - the
122:07 - let me just call this
122:13 - oh yeah and this should actually not be
122:15 - an array it should be like
122:18 - like i should have like a lookup table
122:20 - like
122:24 - so i can say
122:26 - like here's
122:27 - here's what the image is and here's what
122:29 - the rules are for each one of these
122:31 - tiles like imagine if it was like this
122:41 - and the adjacencies are if i am this is
122:45 - tile a
122:47 - right the only the things that can go on
122:51 - the
122:51 - left so let's start what would be let's
122:54 - start with north and i'm going to go
122:55 - clockwise north east south west
122:59 - so what can go north here is just
123:03 - tile a
123:06 - what can go to the east
123:08 - is tile a
123:14 - or b
123:16 - what can go to the south is just tile a
123:20 - and what could go to the
123:22 - east to the west
123:24 - is also tile a
123:27 - a or b
123:34 - and then i can do the same exact
123:36 - adjacencies for b
123:39 - which is what can go
123:40 - to the north or south is only b itself
123:43 - and what can go to the east or west is a
123:47 - or b so it's actually exactly the same
123:56 - but
123:57 - um
123:59 - b here
124:01 - and b here
124:03 - so is this and this should be tile two
124:06 - is this a reasonable way
124:10 - to
124:11 - organize the data for something like
124:13 - this
124:15 - this is how i would do it just
124:18 - thinking about it now unfortunately i
124:19 - can't take the next step with this
124:22 - because i have to go
124:32 - but to me this makes sense and the next
124:35 - step would be
124:37 - to
124:40 - i mean come on how hard could this be
124:44 - um
124:44 - [Music]
124:47 - like what if
124:54 - let's just just we'll do like a little
124:56 - random walk thing for a second in a way
125:00 - let's just
125:01 - wear my 400
125:03 - and this would be
125:04 - 25 25
125:07 - 12
125:08 - 50.
125:10 - we don't want to draw these tiles
125:11 - anymore
125:12 - so what if i had now
125:18 - um
125:30 - uh it's four by four
125:32 - or 8 by 8 so that's 64 tiles
125:38 - and
125:43 - what if i were to
125:45 - uh
125:48 - set them all up as undefined
125:53 - and then
126:04 - just doing this in a very hard-coded way
126:07 - real quick
126:25 - um
126:32 - oh i was thinking about something else
126:34 - for a second
126:40 - oh
126:42 - uh
127:01 - and i would draw
127:10 - i would do this
127:13 - oh
127:20 - then draw
127:22 - um
127:23 - that image
127:32 - x times 5
127:35 - because 50 yeah
127:38 - each one of those is no it's 50 by 50
127:40 - what am i saying
127:48 - so
127:49 - we're seeing nothing
127:50 - because but if i put in a particular
127:56 - well that's not going to do anything if
127:57 - i put this in
127:59 - aha okay so i got to deal with the fact
128:02 - that there's those extra lines there but
128:04 - that's fine
128:05 - but why is that
128:07 - uh
128:11 - oh because it's
128:18 - okay
128:18 - so
128:19 - now what i could start doing is
128:25 - i could have an algorithm
128:27 - that while
128:29 - they're still
128:33 - um
128:36 - it's funny that i'm actually doing
128:38 - the wave function collapse algorithm but
128:41 - in this very sort of crude quick and
128:43 - dirty way but i am recording this disc
128:46 - but i kind of like gave up on like the
128:48 - full-blown coding challenge energy i'm
128:51 - just like i'm half blown
128:53 - coding challenge energy right now that
128:55 - sounded weird um
128:58 - and i also really have to go uh
129:01 - so
129:03 - um
129:06 - but essentially
129:08 - like
129:10 - i could have some algorithm now i could
129:12 - put this in draw
129:16 - oh but these are not did i make them
129:18 - global variables
129:21 - that's fine so all right i have to stop
129:24 - this is very unfortunate
129:25 - but i really have to go
129:27 - and um yes le'veon and the idea here is
129:30 - that those those adjacencies did i spell
129:33 - adjacency correctly that does that looks
129:36 - so wrong right now
129:42 - search inst
129:43 - adjacencies there's a c
129:46 - a j
129:48 - a chances adjacencies there's no n there
129:51 - okay
129:52 - all right well i know what i'm doing
129:54 - later today i'm sorry that i won't be
129:55 - able to like live stream more of this i
129:57 - mean actually i think i'm gonna hold off
130:00 - because i really don't want to do this
130:02 - too much in advance but i think i have a
130:04 - much better idea now of how to come back
130:07 - and work this out
130:10 - so thank you for being here
130:17 - neil writes i'm just reading this
130:21 - if you write out the neighbor mappings
130:23 - directly then each time you add a square
130:25 - you have to add all of the previous
130:27 - square neighbors
130:30 - i'm not sure i fully understand that my
130:32 - idea for what the next step would be is
130:34 - i would pick one of these randomly then
130:36 - i have like a 50 50 shot like pick a
130:38 - random cell and put one in it
130:41 - and then
130:42 - i pick randomly up down left right look
130:45 - at what's possible there and pick
130:46 - another random one look what's left over
130:49 - up down if i pick to the right i'd only
130:51 - could pick up up down or to the right
130:53 - and i'd keep picking them
130:55 - until i fill the whole thing
130:59 - i think
131:01 - but i'm gonna stop this now because i
131:04 - gotta go so
131:05 - uh thank you
131:07 - for everyone for being here
131:11 - um this is wrapping up the live stream
131:15 - uh i hope that you enjoyed it
131:20 - and that this is getting you down the
131:22 - pathway towards implementing
131:24 - wave function collapse
131:27 - i am fully committed to this project
131:30 - i believe that i could come back and do
131:33 - the full thing in a live stream
131:36 - recording session
131:37 - maybe i'll do it as just like a extra
131:39 - members only session or do it on twitch
131:41 - now that i've already had kind of a live
131:43 - stream about it i don't know
131:45 - send me your thoughts and feedback
131:48 - to daniel at thecodingtrain.com or at
131:54 - um
131:55 - and
131:57 - uh do the cells with the fewer
131:59 - possibilities first yes yes yes so
132:01 - there's an order that i want to go in
132:02 - based on the amount of entropy right
132:05 - that makes absolute sense
132:07 - um not just a random walk
132:09 - um so
132:11 - uh check out uh the uur bot on twitter
132:15 - the macro data refinement program at
132:18 - github's lumen industries if you have no
132:20 - idea what i'm talking about that's fine
132:22 - but if you do
132:24 - you know come and join join me in my
132:26 - weird extra side procrastination
132:28 - projects
132:29 - um i will
132:31 - the survey is closed i will be
132:33 - contacting any of you who filled it out
132:35 - you'll get an email whether if you were
132:37 - picked randomly uh to receive stickers
132:39 - hopefully we'll send you an email if you
132:41 - weren't just so everybody knows
132:43 - and
132:44 - um
132:45 - yeah stay tuned there'll be more more
132:47 - coding train coming to you
132:49 - i i really appreciate all of you
132:50 - watching and kind of going with the flow
132:52 - as i try to figure out what it is that
132:53 - i'm doing on this youtube channel
132:55 - and oh there's a minute left in the song
132:57 - um
132:58 - so
132:59 - um we'll see i thank you to all of you
133:02 - who are saying thank you in the chat
133:05 - uh what's coming up next
133:08 - i i want i need to reboot i'm going to
133:10 - be making sequence tutorials about how
133:12 - to make a twitter bot
133:13 - with machine learning models and how to
133:16 - moderate the tweets before they get
133:17 - posted so that's coming up
133:19 - where is my
133:21 - notes other things to talk about ah if
133:23 - you are an apple two plus aficionado and
133:27 - know apple basic and want to get in
133:29 - touch with me to give me tips and
133:32 - suggestions
133:34 - um
133:36 - check out the processing fellowships
133:38 - and the
133:39 - google summer of code
133:41 - also
133:43 - um
133:44 - let me not forget to thank today's
133:46 - sponsor brilliant
133:47 - and that's all i have for you i will see
133:50 - you next time on the coding train
133:54 - goodbye this is for all of you we got
133:55 - this dot song and
133:57 - and oh are we gonna have a musical dance
134:00 - experience everybody it's time it's time
134:02 - for the musicals dance experience as
134:04 - always i always forget that this stock
134:06 - this stock let's stop this stock i'm
134:07 - gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna
134:09 - do this this stock this
134:16 - [Music]
134:20 - i'm doing this like silently but my mic
134:22 - is very
134:32 - music won't go through it i'll see you
134:33 - all have a good day
134:54 - [Music]
135:07 - dot this dot this dot song never forget
135:09 - the vista
135:10 - somebody composed that song for me
135:13 - all right goodbye everybody
135:15 - stream
135:16 - going off i hope if you have suggestions
135:18 - or thoughts about this new studio setup
135:20 - i would love to hear them goodbye
135:27 - i'm finding the button to press
135:30 - where's that button to end the stream
135:33 - there it is i'm hitting it now goodbye i
135:36 - love you all
135:41 - the stream will stop
135:44 - immediately and you will no longer be
135:46 - live that's what i'm going for

Cleaned transcript:

so do do do do do do foreign so do do do do well hello happy friday good morning welcome to the coding train with train whistle classic because i can't find my new custom laser etched train whistle i've got to just use this uh old one that i used to use oh but it has the best sound listen to that now i'm using some uh very fancy hightech uh artificial intelligence sound processing technology to reduce the echo that's in this room that i'm in because i somehow refuse i should just show you something here i mean i should just spend wouldn't you want to watch just an entire live stream of me kind of trying to attach these to the ceiling hang some sound blankets i mean maybe if i just speak like this is this better um was the whistle silent because i wonder i have noise reduction on and i wonder if my no sound oh this is so strange are you all hearing me please let me know if i'm coming to you loud and clear and live i'm tripping over things i have something exciting to show you actually though oh no i'm getting a phone call well this is an important phone call but i can't take it while i'm live on there i actually just got a really important text message which read what am i forgetting for the seder plate so i probably should answer that uh happy whatever holiday if you're choosing to celebrate any of the possible holidays that might be happening anytime within the last six months or the next six months you know if you're following a 12month calendar oh there's just so many ways that you could be that's just different and interesting we're from all over the world and i would like to hear from you in the chat tell me where you're from you can hear me but not the train and i say wave collapse function again oh i said it wrong again the whistle was silent that's insane wow the a okay hold on hold on everybody we're going to uh we're going to make something happen here that is completely insane uh i'm going to disable the futuristic hightech artificial intelligence train whistle suppression engine that i am running i see we've got south africa we've got ethiopia india indonesia this is incredible and and to think that i was like i spent by the way all of my prep time if there ever was any prep time for me live streaming was spent me working on a message saying i'm not able to live stream today and i was like i just have to do it it doesn't matter i have between 9 45 a.m and 11 45 a.m free even though i'm unprepared i don't know how to code a thing that i might like to code i have a uh i don't know what to do but i have a list of things because i was streaming on twitch yesterday and i made a list of things that i would do today so hold on i've got to get rid of this france nepal argentina new jersey venezuela nigeria brooklyn new york hello okay brooklyn uh uh oh i am not in brooklyn new york at the moment although that is where i do consider my home to kentucky usa chris sears hello denmark oh whoops hold on uh uh whoa oh now i'm getting some weird echo sound oh oh i i think i have the monitor on and it's coming out okay hold on boston sorry everybody this is too much where's my production team to help me navigate all this i got to turn the echo reduction off noise suppression so you can hear this just could you please stop distracting me with all of the amazing places you are around the world uh nvidia bro broadcast sorry for the sorry for the uh focus issues i can't i can't make it happen where is the software oh there it is there it is okay can i do this okay the noise removal is gone but the echo removal is still on so let's see how this goes ready everybody welcome to the coding train okay so i've got to um do something i've got a guest coming on in a minute uh before i get to that let me thank today's sponsor brilliant do you like learning do you like the coding train guess what i think you're also gonna like brilliant it's a website there's an app it's just got all of these courses and interactive lessons the thing is the thing that i like to say about brilliant which i think is really important is that you're watching me and i'm here tucking tucking tucking waving my arms around trying to get you excited about code and different things you might want to learn that's great that's a thing i'm glad you're here i'm glad you're watching but one of the real uh real ways to learn i think is to just get your hands in there to try it yourself and that's what i try to encourage you to do watch the video try it yourself but another way to do that is through interactive lessons online and i can't really think of a better platform than brilliant to do that so you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrade that lets them know that you found it through me there's lots of stuff you can do for free on the website and then if you want to get the premium subscription which unlocks all of their courses there's a really good neural networked one there's a really good like algorithm fundamental one you can purchase a premium subscription and the first 200 people to do so will get uh 20 off so thank you to brilliant for sponsoring the coding train today i'll come back in the middle somebody remind me at around maybe an hour to look at the brilliant website a bit more all right now let me move that um did you all hear the train whistle did you all hear the train whistle that's what i would like to know and while uh while you're waiting for the train whistle i am going to bring in our guest oh my goodness i have so many messages okay somebody list for me in the chat the things you need on a seder plate because that'll help i know there's a shank bone there's an orange an orange is a new thing on a seder plate which uh we do in my familia um okay but wait wait there's so many okay okay uh i i gotta put the passover stuff away i gotta let in our guest here um so hold on i'm gonna um uh the audio is okay uh hello sauber your audio is going straight through to the broadcast just so you know uh so before you say anything you don't want anybody to hear like dan yeah that shirt is awful why are you wearing it or something like that um but actually could you just speak i don't your video is not up yet but if you would just say hello i can see if the audio is going through oh so ironically enough the audio's not coming through so let me fix that no no hold on it might be my headphones no no no your audio is coming through to me it just wasn't going to the stream and now it is so what i'm going to do is i am going to um i think if i press this button here aha yes uh whoops i've i just i think inadvertently revealed my the zoom meeting id but don't worry there's a waiting room so all the people will start trying to get into the waiting room so you're now you're seeing me here uh talking to sauber i um sabres from the prostate foundation we've known each other for many years worked i've i've been lucky enough to get to participate in a lot of different initiatives that sauber has organized like uh creative coding fest uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten how many have there been uh almost 10 i think almost 10 not wrong um so can everybody hear sober okay yeah people are saying it's fine in the chat so um i think what i'd like to let cyber do is tell you about a few things that are going on with the processing foundation if you're not familiar with the processing foundation processingfoundation.org i can bring the website up while cyber is talking and um it's a it's an organization that i've been involved with for uh almost 20 years now that hasn't existed for 20 years so that's impossible but you know the software was existed before the foundation anyway um and so there's a bunch of things going on that i want people to hear about that you can apply for that you can get involved for and sober um as the education community director is that the right uh is is a great person to tell you about this stuff so i'm gonna i i have a problem with stopping talking so i'm gonna do it i can mute my microphone actually i just mute it and let uh lip sauber take it away for a few minutes sure uh thank you thanks for having me on uh this morning um hi everyone on the coding train um longtime listener and myself um i want to share a couple of programs that are coming up that you can apply to work with us that'll happen this summer they're really exciting and i would love for this community to put in applications if they haven't the first one is google summer of code and let me see if i can oh i can't share my screen but um maybe dan can pull it up look yeah totally yeah so um google summer of code is an opportunity to uh contribute to open source development uh google will fund your time we will provide mentorship and community and you get to work on some of our software projects and that runs uh this summer the application deadline is coming up really soon it's in four days on april 19th uh so if you're interested in google summer of code you know definitely go to the website that dan's showing you can also jump to our discourse which is a place where you can discuss your ideas and then please put an application if you have questions about how to do any of that you can send me an email at sabretprocessing.org i'll put that in the coding train chat in a minute after that and uh excitingly for this project google summer of code they've expanded eligibility which is one reason why i wanted to sort of let people know all over again about it uh so the only requirement is you have to be 18 and above um you have to be above age of 18 and new to open source there's a couple of minor eligibility requirements beyond that but it really offers a lot of folks a chance to get involved with us so i hope if software development's of interest to you you look into this april 19th is the application deadline the other thing i wanted to mention um this um also happens every year is the processing foundation fellowship this one is due on may 1st what is the processing foundation fellowship um i think of it as a way to like either build something for our community or with our community and there's a bunch of priority areas that we have identified things like ai accessibility continuing support which means that you're gonna take one of our old projects and kind of continue to build on it uh ecology uh has been added this year and uh beyond that you can also seek to make educational materials which would be a teaching fellow then you'd work with me and some of our teacher mentors and we would support you in making education materials and putting them out to the world this also comes with a stipend and mentorship and a community what else did i want to say about that i think that's kind of it for apply to that one you would just go to the processing foundation website and fellowship and apply there um and you have about you know two weeks left for that so also reach out both to me or directly to the foundation foundationalprocessing.org if you have questions about uh the fellowship i think that's it oh creative coding fest i think we're going to do another one virtually this spring um this is where we bring educators and students together and uh basically like a mini version of coding train with like 45minute workshops from educators a chance to get your hands dirty meet some of the people that are teaching this stuff uh and learned some little work you know some how to how to do a couple of projects um and what details are still being figured out if you're interested in that also email me starboardprocessing.org so that's the three things google summer of code processing fellowship and cc fast um how's that then did i did that that was perfect only thing that i would add is that because i said scrolling through the website a great great thing that you can do is check out the processing foundation's medium page which has a lot of blog posts about previous fellowships and previous google summer of code projects and that will give you an idea of things that people have done in the past that you might want to continue or just understand sort of what the scope is what's a reasonable scope and how people have sort of organized their thinking around different projects they've developed so that would be here i'm on the processing foundation website under fellowships right actually right here you can just see uh view the fellows from 2021 and 2020 but if i go over to the medium page we'll see there's an open uh post about the open call and then there's lots of uh wonderful posts about different things that people have done in the past digital accessibility uh p5 live um three layer cake cs cake that's brilliant uh internationalization support et cetera et cetera and so um obaro asks in the chat are the are these opportunities remote and uh the answer to that is a distinct yes so um you know in in in the olden days we used to try to do a lot of uh physical gettogethers if there was a group of people in a sort of like one part of the world that were relatively near each other maybe that's a thing we could do we want to foster community as much as possible but absolutely there is no physical location requirement for you to do this there might be some eligibility requirements like sauber mentioned that are google's um eligibility requirements for their program the fellowship is open to anyone anywhere in the world as far as i know um but um so just check all those eligibility requirements but yes you don't have to be in person for any of this um just checking the chat i don't see any other questions so um i'm gonna i can let cyber go on with uh their day and um i thank you so much for being here oh so many people have questions um uh can they uh um what's the best way for them to contact you the email you suggested email email is great yeah cyber at processing and then a general question would be foundation of processing uh would be uh either um yeah thanks for having me on dan excited to see what you make today we'll see yeah all right and i'm gonna watch the severance this weekend you could just text me all weekend with all of your takes because i'm i'm i'm obsessed so i'll uh we'll have plenty to say about that soon enough all right thank you bye all right i'm just taking a peek at the chat let me get myself back here how do you add the subtitles actually this is something that i'm really hoping to improve uh subtitles i'm just using google's automated subtitles for live streams for videos i have them professionally captioned or i do some editing of them myself or somebody who works on codingtrain things uh helps me with that but um yeah if you uh are a um a subtitle user i mean i i watch a lot of shows with subtitles although i my hearing is uh as far as i know pretty reasonably fine um but if you have uh feedback or thoughts about how the content i'm doing can be made more accessible um please tweet at me email me daniel at thecodingtrain.com um i would love to hear from you okay can you restart your neural networks from scratch there's it's probably not going to happen because i have too much to do all right let me talk to you very briefly about what's on my list oh and let me check i i think the twitter poll i put up ended so um let me just look here under my profile i've got like uh oh well i guess i guess the people have spoken and i said wave collapse function again it's wave function collapse this is not a good sign for me trying to do a coding challenge today okay um let's take a look at the the the actual live stream poll which i'm going to end um yeah all right all right people we're doing it so i have something to say which is that um i mean i the problem is i have some other stuff on this list okay let's give me let's say let's say i have to start wave function collapse by 10 30 at the very latest no matter what else is going on so that is 19 minutes from now i have to start it um i'm just looking to see hopefully there's some moderators in the chat um who can help with any of the spam here justin i'm not sure uh oh i i'm trying to match your name and your chat message with your twitter post it's a little hard for me to do that okay but um even though all i want to do is talk about severance at least take a peek by the way i i want to work on this during a live stream i'll probably do it on twitch um but uh take a look at the uur bot um which is a new bot that i've released on twitter um you know just just some people follow the pot not naming any names okay i'm very proud of myself i'm very proud of myself the crows off in the building of my the crows on the roof of my building scream like the sea and i know there's a storm coming i have lots to do with the spot if you want to contribute get in touch all right let's look at what else is on this list so i wanted to talk about some upcoming plans i have to reboot my twitter and discord bot series but wave function collapse so that's just going to put it just going to mention that and put a check mark next to it um i want to relearn apple to basic because i'm planning to do some videos with my apple two plus oh i have something exciting to show you which i'll show you in a second but oh i for did i put that on the list uh i don't think i um i don't put that i don't think i put that on the list but it's not gonna happen today because wave function collapse the collapse of the coding train function is imminent but i do have something i really feel like i should do live but i'm gonna punt it till later but let me mention it um and then maybe maybe you maybe you're all okay with just putting your trust and faith in me or maybe i'll just do a twitch stream just for this um but um i put out a survey i cannot believe uh to get some feedback about the coding train i am compiling the results and reading through the survey it's incredible there were over 2 000 responses to this which is just blows my mind um and there was an option in the survey unfortunately it's closed now so sorry sorry for you if you were just hearing about this i'll do another one uh where you could enter to win a sticker giveaway so i was going to write a little p5 sketch to pick the winners and do that live but wave function collapse wave function collapse wave function collapse way stay with me everybody wave function could everybody just like get behind me and all just stand all everybody stand behind me and cheer my name as i'm working on wave function collapse that's a severance reference i'll try to stop making everything of severance reference okay uh you should talk about severance who cares about it so first of all let me just get this out of the way if you are interested i give i have i have six more minutes before i promised i would start i kind of have to erase the whiteboard though so that's good and i got to set up my code so really i have like two more minutes then i promise no more severance content but for those who are interested one check out uh first we'll listen to the podcast uh which had a nice interview with uh michael chernus uh who is the inspiration or his character in severance is the inspiration for you know follow dr amanda r on twitter also the um world's leading severant social media influencer um the uur bot checkout uh inspired by the character uh dr rick and lazlo hale i'm working on it it's sort of an alpha but people found it i mean i put it out there and so it's no longer alpha people are reading the tweets um and then also check out a lumen dash industries.com where you can enjoy uh macro macro data refinement to your heart's content uh and i would sit here and do this for hours and hours like i do in my that's why i don't prepare for the coding trade anymore all i do is refine the data wave function collapse wave function collapse i got it i got it everyone just keeps saying it um and if you want to contribute to either of these projects github.com shiffman is where you will find the u the uur bot it's probably it's a recent repository um there it is uur bot it needs a lot of work um i haven't piled uh compiled issues and things that i want to do or written to read me so i need to do all that and then you can also go to github.com lumen industries that's the company that i'm hoping will well hire me maybe i'm not hoping i think that's a bad idea actually but um this one is a bit more organized with a readme and uh there are some active pull requests going on and a bunch of issues of things that are to be implemented so frau plays it every day oh you've made me so happy that's the greatest thing i've ever heard and we'll be i'm going to be happy later today even even when this uh wave function collapse thing goes horribly wrong because here's the thing i'm going in totally cold which is and this is not an easy just like oh i already sort of know this or like i understand how it works so i'll just sort of figure it out as i go all right so i'm going to move this over here and close a bunch of windows we're going to get started i do need to look at the um brilliant website in the middle of the stream so i can't forget that i'm just closing all these windows it's also it's cold in here it's such a warm beautiful day and i um but this this room really my hands are but i think the cold is good it's gonna i'm gonna keep my energy up there will be a musical dance experience to be had oh jeez help help me somebody i'm in the country in the boonies there's just trees around me and i have all these lights and cameras and people watching what am i to do okay um i think that okay so wave function collapse we're gonna go to the uh source i know you're not seeing my screen right now that's gonna um i want to go to the uh this is it okay bringing this back um okay now something that's really driving me crazy is that my audio is being monitored by uh and it's coming out i gotta turn i gotta mute the pc okay i think it should be fine simon says literally in the last hour tried to figure out how the algorithm works how did that go see the thing is this is a bad idea this is not realistic for me to do in the next hour and 25 minutes so this part of me is like i should save this for a day when i have almost a full day to stream or maybe i should like do a little bit more research first or and just do something else today but you the people have spoken and i said i was gonna do it so i i have a feeling i'm gonna go in as if so the process that i have now as i live stream trying to work through some kind of algorithm or project and then i while i'm doing that i record everything to disk and i have something exciting to show you two minutes left um and which i'll get to in a second um and um then that gets edited together uh you know with some cutting out some extraneous stuff adding some additional like animations or explanations if i record them later to try to make a somewhat coherent somewhere between 20 and 60 minutes is sort of my goal video called the coding challenge wave function collapse so i just don't think it's realistic for me to do the whole thing today but this is what i feel like why don't i get it started see how it goes i can return and record the rest later or i could just come back and do the whole thing over at some point i've had a little bit of practice i think that's what i have to do i i don't know what else to say um all right i'm just taking a peek at the chat sounds like a plan yep right sounds like a plan ah this whistle this you're hearing the sound now right it's incredible and it doesn't have any echo is that amazing all right let me show you my exciting thing i see that it is 10 20. uh let's see if this works uh so i'm in a new studio and i put a camera over there uh which now you can see hi that's the wide shot so this is by the way i wanted to just introduce you to my new setup i mean it's the same setup that i've been using for years and years and years i just keep remaking it and i have this new uh big space where i'm living now um and i've been uh doing a lot of work on it and got some new sheet rock and painted some walls and put down a epoxy of blue epoxy on the floor you can see that i have legs this is a nice standing desk this is where the streaming pc is over here you can see where the cameras are and this is the whiteboard camera which i think is uh working pretty well these days i do need to erase this and i bought i went to ye olde hardware store and i have a righty board microfiber eraser cloth this is all the content that you signed up for today oh come on you can't open it okay wait i think i have a scissors somewhere everybody we come back over here i'm just curious to see if people have any uh mystery solved yes uh okay i'm uh got my beautiful oh there's two of them which is good because i wanted to get a microfiber cloth to clean my apple ii plus computer which unfortunately the camera is not pointed at the wide shot if you missed that stream oh good news by the way for those of you who caught my stream when i was uh building and well not building but i was re rebuilding and turning on um my apple ii plus computer for the first time in uh probably i don't know let's see probably let's say the last time it was used was 1990 if i if i had to guess so 30 plus years oh we got it by the way this is the todo list for the macro data refinement you'd think i would have thought to erase the whiteboard before i came in here i think i'm going to need some water um excuse me get some water talk amongst yourselves i'm going to wet this cloth slightly oh no you know what i have because oh i have a um i don't know if you can see me i should put the wide shot back on but i have a um like a wet wipe type thing oh i just took too many so this should this should do the trick really fast oh my goodness yeah by the way this is uh my daughter's drawing she was in here drew that so sorry maybe i'll leave that there now i guess i have to i'm gonna erase it she'll be fine okay okay uh that did the trick i don't i don't have a trash can all right now i'm gonna maybe i shouldn't well caution to the wind here there we go okay the next thing i need to do is set up a code file um and let me bring myself over here oh i need to i need to i definitely need to make sure i'm recording to disk so please bear with me for a second while i pull that up uh okay hold on it's coming all right uh no remind me later about updating oh and uh you know what just start recording okay so that's recording i'm recording to disk now um okay let me move some things to the side here that are unnecessary uh okay um i'm sorry sorry i'm looking at my phone which is a terrible idea but you never know the one the thing is i was gonna stream this afternoon and i had like a ton of i i thought i had like three or three or four hour block but i forgot because of the holidays i have to pick up my kids from school early i've got um so there's i got some family stuff going on so this is my only free time and it's it's dwindling fast because as i don't know who it was who said it in the chat uh here we are um is the red theme on your browser new i don't know i don't know where that came from i have no idea where that came from but great question uh uh justin that's that's nice of you to say i hope that your daughter is enjoys watching and maybe is interested in programming someday or already it's programming okay i've got to find a good whiteboard marker and let's okay let's go whoops let's start setting up so i um i think that i should use for this i'm not going to use the p5 web editor this feels like a complex enough project that having a bit more space and making sure i have easy access to the javascript console is going to be important so let's go to the desktop let's make a directory called wave function collapse and let's open that up in visual studio code and so um my workflow videos could use a refresher as everything could but um this is kind of my code editor of choice these days uh and i'm just going to have two files an html file and a sketch.js file and the way i like to write my html file is by going to the p5 web editor and taking this and then cop pasting it here whoops that's in sketch.js we're on file pasting it here and then going into stats.js and putting in a setup function and a draw function uh and will just give us a nice gray background to start and then making sure that uh oh and then i would like to run i've been using more recently the live server um which um does a good job of just auto refreshing when i change the code although i don't always want that to happen so i might go back actually you know what i don't like that because i like to be able to dramatically refresh and restart the sketch myself so let's go to this okay that's fine and let me just make sure that uh it's picking up the new code all right we're ready to go um i would also like to filter out the warnings the thing is like i made that april fool's video with the anal retentive coder which um like four people watched and then like ever since i made that i realized like oh my god that's me that was not a joke that's what i do all the time i'm like okay no i can't have these yellow warnings here oh my goodness it's looking for a style sheet we must fix that and i never get to anything um all right i do not need the sound library and i also that's fine now the warnings are gone now okay um i can close this all right i'm gonna have a little i'm gonna try to warm up okay see um oh yeah uh yeah i know i i read that link um so there's a lot of really great resources let me just jump into this video and i apologize i have to um blow my nose i think allergy season uh is is happening for me okay um all right so i'm just gonna dive in i'm recording to disc um um and um so i'm going with my plan here it is what it is thank you for being here i mean i should the live stream the other thing is be part of here we go ready everybody hello and welcome to a coding challenge video i'm dan and i am dreadfully unprepared for this let me so the topic is oh it's an incredible topic it's called wave function collapse and i'm going to put up a bunch of images and different things and resources and links that you will all be in the description that you can go to to read about there are just so many examples of this incredible procedural generative algorithm all over the internet it's a new algorithm uh it was started it was i think 2000 the origins are 2016 by on the github username is mxgmn so all the proper credits will be again in the video description but if you're here to watch a proper tutorial about wave function collapse maybe go back to your search engine type in wave function collapse tutorial again because i don't think this is going to be it because i'm going in almost entirely cold i have read one or two one to three web pages about this algorithm i have seen many examples of what people have done with this algorithm and i am sitting here staring at the github repository for the original implementation which includes a nice explanation that i am going to attempt to follow in the next i don't know 400 hours and to be truth i'm recording this live right now there's people watching uh but i might get some help from the chat you know you tune into my live streams if you want to participate in that and uh i don't have a lot of time so i'm probably later on going to be wearing something entirely different because i'm going to have to come back and finish this another time i don't know why i'm trying to predict everything you yeah i could just redo this introduction later and when i know what happened and then i wouldn't have had to predict it let's let me try to describe to you oh okay this desk gotta lock these wheels better let me try to describe to you in a very sort of like loose terms my understanding of what wave function collapse is and i'm going to use my whiteboard for that uh i wanna there already is a processing four out it's i think alpha or beta but go check it out all right um how was that that was a fine intro right matia will do wonders with that i just want to make sure i'm actually still recording to disc yeah i think i can stop worrying about that the whiteboard camera i just i know i'm sorry but it's a little bit askew so i just want to fix that although is that did i do that on purpose oh i did that on purpose so that i can stand over on this side and the edge of it is here that's fine all right i think it's fine um all right my hands are cold oh you don't see the white board i mean in a way i should just when i'm doing the whiteboard i should probably go to this and in fact i could actually just have this up part of me wants to do it this way but i think it's good for you to be able to see uh the full picture and i've lost the chat yeah okay again i don't really know this algorithm so i'm probably gonna get some things wrong that's okay everything's going to be okay all right hold on okay okay the idea of the wave function collapse algorithm is to look at a particular image it's often something abstract like this analyze the patterns that appear in this particular image and use those patterns to generate a new image in the same vein or style of this one but the amazing thing about this algorithm this i mean what was i saying this might not seem like such a this might seem like a sort of everyday creative coding activity to you after all there's all these new kinds of machine learning and neural network and ai style transform and strength transfor style transfer and uh style gan and all these ways to generate images from one source as an inspiration but this is actually not using any of that it is an incredibly um i mean this is going to be really hard to implement like highly sophisticated in its terminology and its approach but ultimately its core it's actually kind of a simple idea and it has to do with this idea of tiles and not what i would like to call states although i don't know if this is entirely used as the proper term in the original algorithm itself and then the idea of collapsing these states um there's a term that comes up at in as entropy and this is from information theory it's sort of like one of these weird like nobody knows what entropy means so we'll just use entropy when we want to like sound like we're doing something smart but actually if you want to like learn more about entropy i would suggest to you three blue one browns videos about the wordle game which has some really interesting parallels to some things that are going on in wave function collapse i think but the idea here is that entropy we can think of as a term for the amount of information oh i know it i know it's a great example because i read about it in somebody's post online let's say we're playing sudoku and um how do you play sudoku i think you have nine by nine i mean well okay there's more i'm gonna fill in some okay all right all right let's say we're not playing sudoku we're designing a sudoku board and the idea of sudoku right is that we need to have all 10 digits 0 through 9 present and in columns and rows but i'm simplifying here let's just say it's like the simplest game of sudoku you could ever possibly play which is that i somehow need all 10 digits in this 3x3 grid so right now at present each grid has 10 each cell has 10 possible states the entropy of any given cell right now is a measure of how many how many remaining state possibilities could go in that spot so right now every single cell has the same measure of entropy same amount of entropy 10 possible states if i were to put the an 8 here suddenly well the entropy goes down to nothing because this has been collapsed that's the idea of collapsing these range of possibilities down into one it's decided and then the entropy is less for all of the others because there's only nine possibilities left now this is again a very crude and simplistic example because there's not a lot of variations of the sort of span of possibilities across a larger space that you might have in a full sudoku game but you're starting at the idea of what does it mean to build a pattern out of tiles on a grid where each tile has a certain number of possible configurations that could go into it and as we start to place those tiles they reduce the number of possibilities in the neighboring tiles this to me is the way that i think of understanding the wave function collapse algorithm just taking a short break here nine left nine left one through nine oh you can't oh oh that whole explanation was wrong oh i'm the worst what is facetime street i didn't really like it anyway so oh geez so let me ask you all a question i i think i should use the i think i should use a different example anyway that was a little bit weird and you can see how i'm not going to get through this today so let me ask you a question let me ask you a question was that a reasonable explanation of entropy the um entropy in a state function uh well okay entropy oh what i'm looking for is information theory uh just to make sure i'm kind of describing this correctly uh i've been on this website many a time uh more generally quantify the information event a random variable um entry provides a measure of the average amount of information needed to represent an event drawn so that's like um um yeah this is uh average amount of information needed so higher entropy means more possibilities right right i got that right it was a spoton explanation of entropy okay that's lucky i mean so i should i go for the sudoku thing again but obviously talk about the nine numbers not the ten i'm just so here's the thing i've been it's been like beaten into me over years and years and years of programming with a raise that i've got to talk about index values zero through nine which is a total of ten and i just like borked my brain there um all right um let's just try that again because that's not gonna go that's not gonna fly for uh it's a funny live stream moment but and we could oh also this looks a little blurry the whiteboard let me see if i can focus it a little bit better i think that's better let me have a look oh yeah that looks better why not use wordle oh yeah why not use wordle let's use wordle let's use wordle oh this is so exciting i can use wordplay all right the problem with wordle is i've been like ah is it like universally the thing is like i i'm going down a road of all right let's find let's use work i know the word all i think is two it's interesting it's too sophisticated like i'm gonna have to explain wordle so i got very excited about that but i think i should just stick with the sudoku um unnecessary closeup sorry about that 10 and no empty all right now now i'm still okay wordle is a great idea all right all right let's let's let's try it okay wordle has nothing to do you know what wordle is is is so related but i think sudoku is a little bit closer in the sense that um i think sudoku is maybe a bit more universally known um and i could actually i could make you know what i to make this more clear i think if i drew a slightly larger board it would actually make more sense so let's do that okay all right shoot see this is why i okay there's no way i'm getting finishing this today so i'm probably going to be redoing this anyway what time is it yes 10 45 okay 15 minutes here before i at least need a little break okay um let's take an example from let's take the classic game sudoku as an example that is basically the worst regular grid anybody has ever drawn in the history of youtube thank you the idea of sudoku is that we have a giant grid of numbers and any one of these cells in the grid could have a number one through nine in it and every single row every single column as well as every single three by three if i could draw this correctly oh put that in post every single three by three sub grid has all nine digits in it unique nine digits in it so how does this relate to wave function collapse and the concept of entropy entropy as i mention say this now i'm lost my rhythm of what i said before and not what's changing but alas entropy is a measure of the possibility space of every single one of these cells entropy in the information theory sense is a measure of the possibility space of every one of these cells so right now the entropy is uniform every cell could have nine possible digits in it if i were to start building a sudoku board i could just pick one randomly and pick a random number maybe i pick the number eight and i plop it in here now the entropy has changed for every single one of these cells remaining in this row and every single one of these cells remaining in this column as well as all of the cells in this top right three by three grid right they only have now eight possibilities left while the entropy for here is nine and if i were to put the number two here suddenly now the entropy is reduced for these cells so as the entropy goes down we have fewer fewer possible things that could fit in a given cell collapsing the cell is the act of picking its number its state it's done it's collapsed the goal of sudoku is to use information that you have gathered the entropy of every single state the entropy of every single cell start putting all the numbers around until you can solve it and if you find a cell suddenly that has no possibilities then you've done something wrong and you need to go backwards and try again this is exactly what i am going to attempt to do with the wave function collapse algorithm as applied to pixels what if instead of every tile in a so so if we take a graphics canvas that's say 400 by 400 pixels what if every single tile could have a particular color in it or a particular grouping of pixels a pattern so to speak what if i took that pattern from maybe this source image so what if i took this pattern just this little section of pixels and decided to put it here in the corner i've collapsed this one section of this particular image now if i could somehow based on collapsing this one reduce the entropy for its neighbors then i could select a particular tile maybe i only look at tiles that can go next if i if i've analyzed this image for what kind of patterns exist next to this one and only allowed me myself to pick those to either to put adjacent to this one then i could collapse those and it would ripple out i could keep collapsing others around it um okay um actually there is this amazing demo where is that it was sent to me shoot let's sit here hold on uh let me just find this in my direct messages um i i feel like i kind of botched that explanation but that's fine um just give me a second here hello discord where are you uh okay great all right i'm pulling this up this is an inter um ah right ah that's that's such a good dan writes in the chat um let me uh uh let me just read that entropy of certain cells will reduce which also causes the total entropy of the grid to reduce um so i'm just gonna sort of say that as the entropy of dif as the entropy of different cells is reduced the entropy of the total system also reduces until we find a solution and by the way this is exactly how you might approach an algorithm to solve sudoku or to solve the game wordle again check out three blue one brown's video on that this is just so related and it's got tentacles everywhere in the kind of stuff that i'm expecting if you're watching this video you're interested in this here is an incredible interactive demonstration of wave function collapse what it's showing is this source image these pixel tiles that you can find in the in sorry what it's showing is a source image divided into a set of tiles and each tile has neighbors next to it if i were to go here and pick like okay i want this particular okay sorry try this again don't forget thank you melissa no uh uh eight minutes i'm gonna do my i'm gonna take my short break okay when can i come back and finish this is the question i want to do this today i have to go though i mean i should check my messages a small chance i have something at noon there's a small chance uh um i don't see any of that um i'll check that again at 11 30 just to make sure my thing at noon is still happening okay okay this is an incredible interactive demo oscar stallberg this is an incredible interactive demonstration of the algorithm by oscar stahlberg yes i think i said that right we have a source image it has an entire set of tiles from that source image and we're going to build a larger image out of these same tiles shrunk down so i could start by picking any tile in the this image over to the right and copying over let's say i want to copy over this solid brownish tile and i want to do that in this one so i hover over that tile and i select it now because i selected why did it make the tiles below it brown i would have thought that wouldn't be possible because this would it allows it to repeat itself wait a second somebody explain this to me because i right i mean so for example if i were redoing the recreating the image i would pick this one and then now i have a reduced set of possibilities like i could pick this one and then i could pick this one why did this oh that makes sense why then that would be that but why underneath because wouldn't it show this one underneath what am i missing um what do these numbers mean oh let's see that's the number of the what do these numbers mean huh uh does anybody wait a second here let me zoom in here oh no this is different now so this is showing the possible the possible time i'm imagining these are the possible things that can be below it and how do i know which is the id for this like this is just saying the same one everywhere i'm so confused i'm looking at the chat there's no block that has brown on top and something else on bottom the numbers are color codes um what am i missing here oh it's the hex colors i don't think so right i thought okay let me reset this so let's say i pick this particular tile i'm so confused is it not actually is this a pre maybe this is a pre generated um um maybe it's not actually pulling the adjacencies or or is it using the or they're actually smaller because is it's actually do is this doing the overlapping method in which case like it's not visually exactly this it enforces matching colors across cell boundaries oh is that all it's doing so it's just looking for a cell that has the same color on the other side i see um check discord okay thanks simon uh uh the only possibility if there's a solid brown anywhere if there's a solid brown below oh okay so um um so yeah i think this is doing a slightly different method than in my head i was imagining which is that um it is actually matching uh this is pretty interesting this is like a different way of doing it which is really cool which is that it's actually just listing the color that's on this border and then the only things that can go above it are so like for this particular tile i got it the only thing for this tile the only things that can go below it are anything uh that's brown so this tile by the way has to have a brown tile above it to the left and to the right so it can have this it can have another oh i got it now oh wow i should implement it like this this is cool this is not the way i was thinking of doing it and simon is pointing out uh it's been about an hour okay i know thank you al everyone's reminding me simon is pointing out like i was going to so the post that i was looking at yesterday on my twitch stream which um um which is this one is a really excellent post and it proposes first there is a simpler version of this idea which um uh i was looking for a particular which is actually on sorry this page which is just looking at um this idea of a tile map generation okay so that's actually that's what so maybe i should do it this way which is what um all right okay so here's the deal there's the idea of the wave function collapse and i i'm clearly coming back and doing this another day but let's see how this keeps going but this is hopefully useful for all of you we're here in the moment let's just be here in the moment together and not worry about this video later that i want to make this is all part of the process and even if i just do a little bit today i might if i inspire you to like try it on your own or you want to send me some tips after and i'll come back and do it more all that's great so um but what i want to say is that i i there are two versions of this algorithm one which is just using straight tiles and one which is using overlapping tiles um and i think there's like very specific terms for these which i might not be getting exactly right and the idea of the straight tiles is more like sudoku in the sense that there are i have nine possible kind of like tiles and when i put one there it uh it reduces the possibilities i could go next to it because only certain possibilities can go next to it and typically like um in this particular demonstration uh which is not this one which is uh this one we might have some essentially preconfigured set of tiles with a list of possible neighbors um and that's this is um this is a nice way of do this is this is a a simpler way to do it but the issue with this is you've got to predesign what the tiles and rules are i mean maybe i could analyze the last with in this one i could analyze the last row of pixel last column or row of pixels to match but essentially i've got to build a json file or i think there's like examples of like xml files that list all the tiles and what their neighbors are whereas the overlapping model uh what it does is it takes an image and scans it and builds an array of tiles and then looks at neighbors and the reason why it's called overlapping is because we're not we're in addition to like taking this tile and looking at what's next to it we'll just move one pixel over and take this tile usually they're like three by three or whatever and then look at the one next to it as well so i i was all set yesterday to be like okay i've read this i should just do the simple tiled model and then part two our coding challenge uh a kodi challenge followup would be to then do the overlapping model which yields you more exciting i was like kind of like oh can i take a picture of this shirt and use it as like the tile generator um so uh the overlapping model is what you what sort of like feels more like magic because you just feed it an input and it analyzes it whereas the tiling model is more like i'm a game designer and i want to have like a a world that has you know each cell could be it's a 2d world and it could be brick if i'm building like a platformer game it could be brick or wall or like i don't know what the pieces would be so maybe what i need to do in order to do this video properly is actually design a set of tiles or use a preexisting set of tiles because now i fully understand and this demonstration is so awesome i was playing with this last night and i don't think i really understood it i just was enjoying playing with it and now i do and this is just incredible like if i do this like look at all the different possible configurations that come out just from this particular design um and um so um uh justin writes i'm looking at this from a game dev procedural dungeon generator um and simon is saying for tiled models you can make models where you scan an example image it's kind of like the game of life uh every tile is a single pixel so we could do you know that will work also um just so i could scan an image and have every especially if the image had limited colors like if this is a full color image with each tile could be a single pixel that's kind of an interesting way of doing it and then it only can have certain pixels next to it all right i'm gonna have to come so i'm hoping that this introduction is giving you something um i'm gonna talk about brilliant in a moment and take a short break uh and then come back and i'll have about a half an hour or so left and i sort of think about what i'm going to do but clearly this was a um as i expected is not going to in the next half an hour lead to the full implementation of this so um let me um i'm gonna do a break will be good for all of us it'll help me do some thinking about this and i'll read your comments in the chat but since you're all here with me let me tell you about today's sponsor brilliant i talked about brilliant to the beginning of the live stream i don't know if you were there or not so i'm going to repeat myself a little bit i make videos about different algorithms and concepts from math and science and art and all sorts of related topics and you watch them and maybe you try to make something after watching them that's a way to learn and the important part of that is you trying it and so brilliant is i think the perfect companion complement to the stuff that i do here on the coding train in the sense that it is a website full i'm going to just pull up a video of one of them this is the logic course it is a full of just many different courses around algorithms and computer science and math and physics and all of these topics and you get to actually try stuff like you could learn code without knowing the syntax by pseudo code and manipulating different kind of problems so learning logic learning algorithm fundamentals in it through interactive lessons is just a wonderful way to learn i always have to mention um the neural network course which just like you know if i could imagine the perfect like demonstration of the act the visual activity of a neural network of different videos that i've done using neural networks would be what's right here in this brilliant course and so if you want a nice companion if you're learning about machine learning you've been watching some videos you've been trying some python libraries maybe you've tried ml5.js you want to get deeper into some of these concepts the neural network course on brilliant would be great for you and sorry that it went to a black screen there um let me just go back to my computer and pull up brilliant i think that i'm logged in uh i am logged in um and um actually i was looking today at um so let me just quickly scan the courses so you can see you know there's so many uh you know whenever i'm looking for a new idea for a coding challenge i have this a list of ideas like a lot of them are now coming from brilliant especially this beautiful geometry course the logic course i referenced um it's great for parents teachers you know i've been actually looking at this with my kids which has been fun but i did actually notice oh it was i guess i don't know this nine plus i don't know why this popped up when i was looking at it the other day because this is an older one but um oh and i wonder if this also but there's a lot of stuff that deals with entropy and information theory like this one so this is a challenge right it's possible to arrange five square tiles in numbers one two three four five into a plus so the sum of the three tile column and the sum of the three tile row are both equal to nine let's think about this for a second if they have to equal to 9 the total of all the tiles would it be 18 no because there's a tile that is repeated so the the total of is 18 plus 18 which is 36 well the three has to go in the center right because if i put the two in the center there's no way i can make uh a nine like five and one is like to get to get nine i've got to do uh four and like four and three and then i can't get nine like the only way uh to get nine is to put three in the center four and two because six and six because i need six and six uh plus yeah i'm like having trouble explaining why this is my brain was working it out but do you see the connection to entropy right so like right now in theory without thinking about any of the rules of the system the entropy uh is uh you know measure would be five possibilities for every cell but if i look at the rules the entropy of the center cell is not the same as the others there's only one possibility it's three and now i've reduced the entropy down to two for each of the other the other cell so you know i could put um a two here and then that means a four has to have to collapse this to a four or if i put a four here this would have to collapse did i get this right let's just make sure i mean try it yourself by dragging the five number tiles into the plus i've made oh correct i guess i i did it and just marked it as correct um explanation let's look at this the sum of the row in the column is 18 and the sum of all the ti oh i i'm such an idiot i'm not i'm not an idiot i'm learning see it's don't don't say that don't be like me don't say that to yourself you are doing your best and trying and we're all figuring this stuff out did you see how i messed up sudoku earlier and i said there were 10 numbers um so uh yes of course adding up all of these gets 15 but i have to have 9 plus 9 is 18 18 minus 15 is 3 so 3 has to go in the center so it's so lovely to see then to try it yourself to figure it out puzzle it out even if you're just doing it sort of through intuition or some strange methodology and then see the explanation so uh if you're if you find this interesting if you're enjoying this please

chat what you think might be the most effective use of the next 30 to 35 minutes um and i will be back in um well i guess i'm gonna be back in four four minutes okay let's put on some intermission music i'm going to give you this mute my microphone ah sorry the music is muted because i'm in the wrong in this view all right let me just go to here so now it's this is the intermission you i'll pipe the audio from the music into that view later but also it's nice i put up a poll uh i see everybody's voting for a make up a tiling system i really should pick the red i shouldn't have made them i shouldn't have made i should have made the pull because i really feel like i should pick the sticker but we'll see do so all right um thank you again brilliant all right we're asking some questions here you're all hearing me and watching this right now okay so sorry i i'm looking over here because that's where i have my monitor for the chat what does make sticker winner mean so i can understand why you're probably not interested in the me picking the sticker winners because you know the number of you who might have entered to win the stickers through the survey is i think i'll just do that i'll i'll do that separately i'll just like twitch stream for like 15 minutes and do it i just i don't know why but i'm like hung up on the fact that i want people to believe that i'm legitimately picking them randomly i guess you know but so so i'll do that i'll do that just on the twitch stream um uh there is a little bit of an interest in the bot stuff so and i have exactly 30 minutes ish left um um i'm just checking if um oh uh um sorry i'm just checking to make sure there's a small chance that what i have to do although uh would be cancelled or changed so i'm just checking that but that doesn't seem to have happened okay so i'm to end this poll because i'm i'm getting uh the idea of it um and i'm just looking at the chat um um all right so let me come back over here to the computer oops so i i think it would make sense for me to just keep going down this road of generating a tile system and um i mean in a weird sort of way i almost want to just like copy this exactly but um but let me look here like i kind of want to just use one of these existing ones just to understand okay i'm trying to understand these because i i think it would help me to like do the algorithm if i were to pick an existing example the tiles have the same symmetry as their assigned letters or in other words what's fascinating about this by the way is i do a lot of teaching about markov chains with text and always comes up like well how could you do a markov chain in two dimensions with pixels this is essentially that and i i can't believe that i never really sort of made that connection before um what is this oh this is just showing it running but what i'm trying to understand is tiles have the same symmetry as their assigned letters with the systems enough to enumerate pairs of adjacent tiles only up to symmetry which makes lists of adjacencies for tile sets with many symmetrical tiles even the summer tile set okay like this is what i'm trying to understand here i see that these are the three possible tiles oh they're rotations also i'm like how could you get the the top and the bottom because of rotations and the adjacencies are ah however it's rotated um i just don't see what are the adjacencies why are we not seeing like the full enumeration of the adjacencies um chris ray asks to briefly explain the tile for the type topic for the new arrivals uh i'm not gonna be able to briefly explain it but it is uh this algorithm called wave function collapse and it is explained here and through other links i should have added them to the video description i apologize but you'll find a ton of resources here um but i'm just trying to understand um okay all right let me let me try to enumerate i like this one oddly enough so let me try to could generate a set of marching squares yeah i know i could generate an example image and do all the tiles that way i i just have very little time so i right now i'm just looking at kind of trying to just use this time to read and research a bit more like i'm gonna have to come back and implement this but i just want to try to understand exactly how this works so let's look at this one because i feel like this one is going to help us understand i'm actually going to go to this particular view so that we can kind of see all of this at the same time as i go over to the whiteboard okay so and and in case you're just tuning in this stream is going to wrap up in the next 15 to 20 minutes um i started kind of this coding challenge it's gonna take me longer but i feel like this is such an important and valuable topic for people interested in the sort of creative coding space that me dedicating multiple live streams to it and having a lot of material to use to edit together for a sort of condensed video about it it's worth the investment of time and i apologize to for the sort of limits that i have right now um so let's look at these two tiles i'm going to try to redraw them here so here one is essentially well one is blank or gray but we'll call it a blank and the other one it looks like this and i didn't dry sorry i didn't dry the whiteboard effectively enough and it's uh okay just try this again okay the two tiles i'm just going to put them over here i can't remember them but i can see them look like this and then another one is just blank so what i want to understand is if i have this particular tile this one what are the possible tiles that could go here here and all the adjacencies and there's only two possible tiles so clearly what the only possible tile that could go here is the blank one i drew a larger space thinking there might be multiple ones ah but here they have rotations so the tiles that could go here would be could be this but it could also be i'm drawing this in such a weird way so it could be this right so i think i want to try to draw i have a better idea of how to draw this so this only has one possibility this has two possibilities my drawing is kind of terrible right over here we have there's three possibilities right we could have this we could have this or we could have this right and then here is the exact same two possibilities is up there i mean if i didn't allow for rotations there has to be rotations so if i were building a grid of them and if it were just oh i didn't this markers died i need i'm sorry that i'm not looking at the chat right now this is one of the things i want to do is buy some extra monitors and things so i can sort of see the chat over here but um if i'm building this just making sure everyone can see me if i'm building a grid and i put this in the center we'll call this tile a if a goes in the center the entropy of like these i mean right now like is one two two three right so am i understanding the system correctly the first tile is a aaa b and the second is bbb interesting oh right so it would make more sense if i wanted to do this for me to think of it like uh to think of it like the oscar stalberg example where here are all the possible tiles okay i've got a better idea now sorry everybody okay so see i this is why i wanted to work this out oh racing everything is such a mess okay but i i appreciate all of you so much in tuning in and experiencing this with me because it's this is one of those things this is one of my favorite kind of algorithms that is so incredibly simple conceptually in you know in a manner of speaking but um is much harder to implement because of all the different parts and moving pieces but now i have an idea now i understand let's look at all actually all the possible tiles okay oh i really want to program this now it'll have to come later another time next time i'm i think i'm really kind of ready for this and i'm all right so look let's look at all the possible tiles this is so much simpler than i than i had and uh and then so there are five possible tiles essentially like we could think of them as rotations but let's not even do that right now let's just think of them as five so um and then let's think about the what what can match here so the the the side of a tile is either blank or it is a i know what to call this like a pipe a connection so we could call the blank a and the connection b and if i'm going to if i'm going to take a given tile like this one let's say i put this tile first and it's an a connection on all sides i the only things that can go here would be this or that because i need a tile with an a on the right and the only things that could go here are this tile or this one because i need an a connection on the top so i could have each one of these as a little image that i load and then i could have like a json file that basically for every image has an array of possible things that could go i could totally program this now if i had a little bit more time but this makes sense to me now and this is exactly what we're seeing in this particular demonstration it's just more uh sophisticated the top of the tee can butt up against each other too i'm trying to understand that the top of the t can butt up against each other too um oh yes yes yes i didn't see that great so this one can also like if i were had this this side could connect to here or this tile oh i want to do this so bad what time is it okay it is 11 30. oh that's way too much time uh right the tricky part is not the algorithm but all the data structures involved yeah i i actually to me this is very feels very doable because um it it's you're right there's not like some really it's not like okay let's look at back propagation okay well we need to let's talk about partial derivatives like looking at a neural network and how it's trained and the weights are adjusted like there's a lot of math uh and concepts that might be completely unfamiliar to you or like in my case things that i studied and maybe felt little bit of conf not kind of an understanding of but it's been uh 30 years i'm old um but this is like a really fun kid's puzzle and in fact it would be really cool to do like to print this out and to actually do make a physical version of this as part of a video um so i don't know what to do with these 15 minutes but i think um one thing i could do i'm just curious is i know i really want to make a version that analyzes an image for the tiles but now i'm back to thinking that it would be really nice to just start with some prefab tiles and a list of what goes with what let me take a let me take a minute to go down this road before i really have to go so are these is this like one image okay oh yeah um i don't know why this one is really cool too this one really appeals to me i can't exactly explain it oh this wait a second this is just one tile i love that we could do the one tile version that is wild uh that is wild sorry everybody for the spam in the chat um and i appreciate thank you alca who i see with um um i'm always we're always looking for additional people who can help um moderate um you'd want to join the discord and get in touch there um and there's sort of a process for that but um so i don't mean to just say like oh just tell me your name and i'll make you a moderator but um how about generating some square images so yeah let's go to p5 web editor and let's just look at very briefly how i might generate these images so i'm going to make a really small canvas that's 50 by 50. and let's move this over a bit whoops sorry i gotta i gotta just get rid of my discord because it has all these direct messages and things um okay so i'm sorry that i'm about to run out of time this is the one thing about street never mind okay uh i just like i i marvel sometimes about how if i were teaching a class at nyu which i'm on sabbatical right now i like obsessively prepare for like days like over prepare way over over prepared yeah here i am streaming on youtube too what is essentially a uh audience have a much larger magnitude than the 12 to 16 students i guess the tuition at nyu is kernel it's kind of uh expensive um all right sorry i got off track there so um let's try let's try making some of these tiles uh let's let's make the data i just want to make the data structure so what's a good uh just trying to think of how to i know simon you would tell me to automate this but i kind of want to do this manually just for right now all right let me try to recreate uh i think i want two two tiles uh where is that the thing is i could just make these images in photoshop i should be able to code them right look at this um what am i doing which one did i say i like i don't know why i'm obsessed with this one so let's try this one although um okay okay i could do this sorry i i the thing is i'm looking at the clock and thinking and you don't even see my computer i'm sorry the one tile version looks like a recent number file video yeah it's kind of amazing how this is like ten print actually also um um okay so sorry that i was um let's okay so let's let's just look at how i would generate a tile um and let's do um oh hold on let me turn now we're going to do a background actually you know i should do this let's i should do this with create graphics um and let me make this much bigger so you can see it a little bit better and um put on auto refresh uh so this this is going to wrap up in just a second but i just want to give you an idea of how i might go about doing this all right now i'm sorry simon is so right i always listen to simon everybody i should just draw an image and then like pull out the tiles but i'm going to do it this way just for a second here um i'll make the second tile uh and um okay eventually what is there some weird pixel density issue no oh no i know why i'm and these aren't with and height they start oh god i'm trying to do the most simple thing ever and i couldn't get it okay i made two tiles everybody hurry please thank you half and half um oh there's a new number file video about stitch patterns that's cool um sorry okay tile one tile two now um let's say in tile two now i wanna draw i'm gonna say rect mode tile to rex mode center tile to fill i'm just going to kind of use a green color tile 2 stroke 0 tile 2 stroke stroke weight 4 and then rectangle um tile to width times 0.5 tile to height um what did i miss here uh zero uh uh oh yeah no yeah tile two height times zero point five this is very silly what i'm doing but because let me just hard code this because these numbers are getting kind of crazy it's just 100 by 100 to people 50 50 25 50. okay um oh tile2.rex oh and it's a hundred what am i what's wrong with me the height is 100 and if i make it a little bit bigger yes i made two tiles everybody two tiles i have my soundboard back i gotta use it for something thank you everybody thank you welcome to the coding train where i stream for two hours to make a green stripe in a p5 jazz sketch now just just showing you how i can have auto refresh on it's saving a lot of files uh let's go to uh this but i don't need to save it because oh i really wish i had more time so i made this even simpler because this is only going to produce vertical stripes because you'll see in a second but the rules now are let's try to imagine this data structure and i think there's specific terminology that if i reread the wave function collapse algorithm page i'll have a better sense of but let's just call this i'm going to call this like the wfc and we have basically tile one so i can make this an array of arrays but i think i want a lookup table so i'm gonna have let's see i'm just gonna think about this tile one has four edges and um all right hold on how would i want to do this so like what if i had an array and each array had an object in it that had the tile the adjacencies like what would i call this the adjacencies j jacket which would be tile 1 is the first one and that's the image so i should say image i should call these image one image and the adjacencies i could say are four arrays of what could go of what is possible uh i think there's a sort of convention like this reminds me what was that video i did about sort of like northwest so north east south west i mean we could do something with diagonals sorry my nose is running um so the let me just call this oh yeah and this should actually not be an array it should be like like i should have like a lookup table like so i can say like here's here's what the image is and here's what the rules are for each one of these tiles like imagine if it was like this and the adjacencies are if i am this is tile a right the only the things that can go on the left so let's start what would be let's start with north and i'm going to go clockwise north east south west so what can go north here is just tile a what can go to the east is tile a or b what can go to the south is just tile a and what could go to the east to the west is also tile a a or b and then i can do the same exact adjacencies for b which is what can go to the north or south is only b itself and what can go to the east or west is a or b so it's actually exactly the same but um b here and b here so is this and this should be tile two is this a reasonable way to organize the data for something like this this is how i would do it just thinking about it now unfortunately i can't take the next step with this because i have to go but to me this makes sense and the next step would be to i mean come on how hard could this be um like what if let's just just we'll do like a little random walk thing for a second in a way let's just wear my 400 and this would be 25 25 12 50. we don't want to draw these tiles anymore so what if i had now um uh it's four by four or 8 by 8 so that's 64 tiles and what if i were to uh set them all up as undefined and then just doing this in a very hardcoded way real quick um oh i was thinking about something else for a second oh uh and i would draw i would do this oh then draw um that image x times 5 because 50 yeah each one of those is no it's 50 by 50 what am i saying so we're seeing nothing because but if i put in a particular well that's not going to do anything if i put this in aha okay so i got to deal with the fact that there's those extra lines there but that's fine but why is that uh oh because it's okay so now what i could start doing is i could have an algorithm that while they're still um it's funny that i'm actually doing the wave function collapse algorithm but in this very sort of crude quick and dirty way but i am recording this disc but i kind of like gave up on like the fullblown coding challenge energy i'm just like i'm half blown coding challenge energy right now that sounded weird um and i also really have to go uh so um but essentially like i could have some algorithm now i could put this in draw oh but these are not did i make them global variables that's fine so all right i have to stop this is very unfortunate but i really have to go and um yes le'veon and the idea here is that those those adjacencies did i spell adjacency correctly that does that looks so wrong right now search inst adjacencies there's a c a j a chances adjacencies there's no n there okay all right well i know what i'm doing later today i'm sorry that i won't be able to like live stream more of this i mean actually i think i'm gonna hold off because i really don't want to do this too much in advance but i think i have a much better idea now of how to come back and work this out so thank you for being here neil writes i'm just reading this if you write out the neighbor mappings directly then each time you add a square you have to add all of the previous square neighbors i'm not sure i fully understand that my idea for what the next step would be is i would pick one of these randomly then i have like a 50 50 shot like pick a random cell and put one in it and then i pick randomly up down left right look at what's possible there and pick another random one look what's left over up down if i pick to the right i'd only could pick up up down or to the right and i'd keep picking them until i fill the whole thing i think but i'm gonna stop this now because i gotta go so uh thank you for everyone for being here um this is wrapping up the live stream uh i hope that you enjoyed it and that this is getting you down the pathway towards implementing wave function collapse i am fully committed to this project i believe that i could come back and do the full thing in a live stream recording session maybe i'll do it as just like a extra members only session or do it on twitch now that i've already had kind of a live stream about it i don't know send me your thoughts and feedback to daniel at thecodingtrain.com or at um and uh do the cells with the fewer possibilities first yes yes yes so there's an order that i want to go in based on the amount of entropy right that makes absolute sense um not just a random walk um so uh check out uh the uur bot on twitter the macro data refinement program at github's lumen industries if you have no idea what i'm talking about that's fine but if you do you know come and join join me in my weird extra side procrastination projects um i will the survey is closed i will be contacting any of you who filled it out you'll get an email whether if you were picked randomly uh to receive stickers hopefully we'll send you an email if you weren't just so everybody knows and um yeah stay tuned there'll be more more coding train coming to you i i really appreciate all of you watching and kind of going with the flow as i try to figure out what it is that i'm doing on this youtube channel and oh there's a minute left in the song um so um we'll see i thank you to all of you who are saying thank you in the chat uh what's coming up next i i want i need to reboot i'm going to be making sequence tutorials about how to make a twitter bot with machine learning models and how to moderate the tweets before they get posted so that's coming up where is my notes other things to talk about ah if you are an apple two plus aficionado and know apple basic and want to get in touch with me to give me tips and suggestions um check out the processing fellowships and the google summer of code also um let me not forget to thank today's sponsor brilliant and that's all i have for you i will see you next time on the coding train goodbye this is for all of you we got this dot song and and oh are we gonna have a musical dance experience everybody it's time it's time for the musicals dance experience as always i always forget that this stock this stock let's stop this stock i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stock this i'm doing this like silently but my mic is very music won't go through it i'll see you all have a good day dot this dot this dot song never forget the vista somebody composed that song for me all right goodbye everybody stream going off i hope if you have suggestions or thoughts about this new studio setup i would love to hear them goodbye i'm finding the button to press where's that button to end the stream there it is i'm hitting it now goodbye i love you all the stream will stop immediately and you will no longer be live that's what i'm going for
