00:01 - hi in this video I would like to look at
00:04 - two functions that are part of the p5.js
00:06 - Dom library they are called select and
00:09 - select all and the nice thing that we're
00:11 - going to get you and me here in this
00:13 - time and space that we're in the nice
00:15 - thing that we're going to get from this
00:17 - topic is not just those two functions
00:18 - but more about CSS selectors if you
00:23 - recall in this there's this idea in CSS
00:28 - where you have a selector select or I
00:32 - don't know in the year 2050 we'll be
00:35 - saying select or but for now I'll just
00:36 - say selector where you have this
00:40 - selector an open curly bracket a close
00:43 - curly bracket and then some name value
00:46 - pairs that assign style information so I
00:49 - don't like this panel switching so let's
00:52 - say for example you have an HTML file
00:57 - and inside that HTML file you have a
01:03 - body and inside the body maybe you have
01:09 - a paragraph and another paragraph and
01:15 - maybe you have a button so there are
01:20 - three elements here so in the previous
01:23 - video I made about CSS the only selector
01:26 - I talked about if I recall correctly is
01:28 - that you could select a tag so if I put
01:32 - P here then any style information that I
01:35 - put here like font size you know
01:40 - 12-point any style information that I
01:42 - put there gets applied to all paragraphs
01:46 - however here's a question for you what
01:50 - if what you want to do is this I'm very
01:52 - little room here by the way it seems
01:54 - like I might be in a big space very
01:56 - crowded the thing you're I'm banging
01:57 - into um what if what if what you wanted
02:01 - to do was apply this font size only to
02:04 - this paragraph well in that case there's
02:09 - a concept known as an ID so okay so
02:11 - let's make a list here over here
02:13 - I'm gonna make a little box here what
02:16 - are the kinds of selectors now I'm sure
02:19 - there's a much longer more in-depth
02:21 - explanation of this that involves lots
02:23 - of like sub detail ideas of how you
02:25 - combine selectors and subcategory
02:27 - selectors but at its core there are
02:29 - three main kinds of selectors there is
02:33 - the tag itself so all members of a tag
02:40 - type so button would apply to all
02:44 - buttons on the page P would apply to all
02:47 - paragraphs on the page and you know you
02:49 - can extend from there the other types of
02:50 - Dom element now there's a new kind
02:52 - called an ID which is a single Dom
02:57 - element so you can give a Dom element an
03:01 - ID as follows P ID equals unicorn
03:11 - so by this is called an attribute so
03:15 - this is an attribute for this particular
03:18 - Dom element it gets an ID in addition
03:21 - there's a space there I'll type this out
03:22 - in the computer which will make it more
03:23 - clear but there's a space between the P
03:25 - and then you say ID equals unicorn so
03:28 - now if you wanted to apply style to just
03:31 - this you might think what you would
03:34 - write is just the term unicorn this is
03:38 - not exactly correct though now this is
03:40 - conceptually the right idea but IDs are
03:44 - indicated by this pound symbol or as you
03:49 - people who live in today's age would
03:52 - call it a hash symbol so the same thing
03:54 - you use for a hash tag this pounds a
03:56 - pound but you know I like I think of the
03:58 - old phones I mean new phones have this
03:59 - do the pound symbol
04:00 - anyway it's not important but I like
04:02 - going off to the page here so if I say
04:04 - this pound unicorn that indicates I'm
04:08 - looking for an HTML element with the ID
04:11 - unicorn now you could do weird things
04:13 - like add the ID unicorn to this one but
04:16 - you should not because the third kind of
04:19 - tag
04:21 - sorry tag is the wrong word that's a tag
04:24 - pair paragraph tag
04:26 - third kind of selector is called as a
04:28 - class so class is a way of creating a
04:31 - group of elements your own group
04:34 - grouping a bunch together so let's say
04:36 - you have a hundred paragraph elements on
04:38 - the page but you want a way of selecting
04:40 - or applying a style to just those ten
04:43 - you could make those all the members of
04:45 - a certain class you could add a class
04:48 - could go across multiple kinds of Dom
04:50 - element so you could have a bunch of
04:51 - paragraphs and a bunch of image tags and
04:54 - a bunch of div tags and they could all
04:57 - be members of the same class so there
05:00 - and and incidentally the class is
05:03 - indicated by a dot so a tag is just the
05:07 - tag itself P if IMG div an ID is a sign
05:13 - via this hash symbol and a class via the
05:16 - dot and if I wanted to make this
05:18 - paragraph a member of a class you know
05:20 - class equals rainbow okay so this is I
05:24 - said I'm just gonna talk about the
05:26 - Select and select all functions work but
05:28 - I'm sure starting from this place of CSS
05:30 - which i think is actually maybe a nicer
05:32 - place to start so I want to look I'm
05:35 - gonna open make an example that looks at
05:37 - how you apply a particular style to an
05:39 - ID to attach to a tag to an ID and to a
05:43 - class and once we have that I will also
05:47 - show you how to then access elements on
05:49 - the page via those same ideas select all
05:52 - the paragraphs select all the buttons or
05:58 - select this single button with a given
06:00 - ID okay so coming back over here I am at
06:05 - 6 minutes here let's make an example now
06:07 - to make this example what I want to
06:09 - actually do is and the volume still
06:11 - working I want to actually do is I want
06:13 - to start adding some HTML so let's do
06:15 - this p ID equals unicorn and can you see
06:23 - this class equals rainbow unicorns and
06:30 - then I'll make another one that has
06:32 - class equals rainbow
06:36 - and this is unicorns and rainbows I need
06:43 - more space here for my weird so you know
06:46 - it's actually a unicorn it's a single
06:49 - unit a unicorn and this is rainbows this
06:52 - is more rainbows and this is you know
06:58 - just a plain paragraph just a plain
07:04 - paragraph so what I'm showing you here
07:08 - is that I now have four paragraphs if I
07:12 - select by paragraph I'll get all four if
07:16 - i select by unicorn ID I'll just get the
07:20 - first if i select by the rainbow class I
07:23 - will get all three so let's look at this
07:25 - if I hit run you can see there all of
07:28 - the paragraphs now let's add some style
07:32 - and let's say unicorn right this is is
07:39 - font size 16 point rainbow is I'm not
07:49 - just do font size just to be font size
07:53 - is 12 point and P font size now
08:01 - something really strange is going to
08:02 - happen here 8 point and let's actually
08:05 - let's make these quite a bit bigger 48
08:08 - 24 12 so let's look at what's happening
08:13 - now
08:18 - so something strange is going on here
08:21 - which I didn't even really anticipate
08:23 - when starting this video but I think
08:24 - this is kind of an important way of
08:26 - looking at it what I probably should
08:27 - have done to be more clear is done
08:29 - something entirely different to all
08:30 - three kinds but notice all of those are
08:33 - paragraphs so they should all be
08:35 - 12-point right but some of them are
08:38 - members of the rainbow class those are
08:39 - 24 points and one of those that's a
08:41 - member of the rainbow class is actually
08:43 - has the ID unicorn so it's a 48 point so
08:46 - one thing you'll notice is there's a
08:47 - kind of a hierarchy here an ID the more
08:50 - specific you are the more important that
08:53 - style information is assigned so in
08:56 - other words the font size 48.4 an ID
09:00 - overrides what it was given for the
09:02 - class or tag but we could do some things
09:05 - here too so that's one thing that's
09:06 - important to see class overrides tag ID
09:10 - overrides class cuz you're getting more
09:11 - specific tag is very general like all
09:13 - the paragraphs class is like well a
09:15 - group of those paragraphs an ID is like
09:17 - no no no no not all of them not even a
09:20 - group of them this exact specific one so
09:23 - that takes greatest precedence it's not
09:25 - the you could think it's the order that
09:26 - I wrote it there but I'm almost certain
09:28 - that if I move this from here to the
09:30 - bottom it's the same so it's not the
09:34 - order it's the it's the order of
09:37 - precedence is not the order you type
09:38 - them it's actually goes from tag class
09:41 - to ID but let's let's make this a little
09:43 - bit more clear let's do something like
09:46 - padding a 16-point background color you
09:54 - know F 0 F and then rainbow is the ones
10:00 - that are rainbow actually so let's and
10:02 - then we'll split the background color
10:04 - here and then the font size for unicorn
10:07 - is 48 points so this I think makes a bit
10:10 - more sense where you can see that all of
10:14 - the paragraphs get 16 point of padding
10:18 - all of the paragraphs that are members
10:21 - of the rainbow class get a purple
10:23 - background and only the one that has the
10:26 - unicorn ID gets a font size of 48 point
10:29 - so this is a way of looking at how
10:31 - selecting by tag or selecting by class
10:34 - or selecting by ID will allow you to
10:38 - address
10:39 - elements and their style in print more
10:42 - or less specific ways now this video is
10:45 - about 10 minutes long that's it at the
10:47 - beginning I'm going to talk about the
10:49 - Select and select all function and then
10:51 - kind of to lead up to that I wanted to
10:53 - look at the different ways of selecting
10:55 - things which are come back over here
10:58 - which are which are by tag by ID or by
11:01 - class so actually I think now what I
11:04 - would suggest to you is create for
11:06 - yourself a page which has a whole bunch
11:09 - of Dom elements in it use different tags
11:12 - paragraph image button etc give some of
11:15 - things IDs give group things by class
11:18 - and see if you can assign them all
11:20 - different styles and how that works and
11:22 - what what overrides what just play
11:24 - around with that for a little bit
11:25 - because in the next video what I will
11:27 - show you how to do is what I said I was
11:28 - going to do at the beginning of this one
11:29 - is then start to select them into you
11:32 - bring them into your code so that you
11:35 - could dynamically assign behaviors or
11:37 - events or callbacks or dynamic styles
11:39 - via this idea of IDs and classes and
11:42 - that sort of thing so that's what I'll
11:43 - actually do in the next video but I'm
11:45 - going to say like stop prepare yourself
11:47 - the page and then in the next video
11:48 - we're gonna look at the JavaScript
11:49 - aspect of that ok so thank you for
11:52 - coming and listening to unicorn and you
11:56 - the unicorn and rainbows show which
11:57 - apparently is what this is and I'm going
12:00 - to hit come Mouse come I'm gonna stop
12:02 - this video and start the

Cleaned transcript:

hi in this video I would like to look at two functions that are part of the p5.js Dom library they are called select and select all and the nice thing that we're going to get you and me here in this time and space that we're in the nice thing that we're going to get from this topic is not just those two functions but more about CSS selectors if you recall in this there's this idea in CSS where you have a selector select or I don't know in the year 2050 we'll be saying select or but for now I'll just say selector where you have this selector an open curly bracket a close curly bracket and then some name value pairs that assign style information so I don't like this panel switching so let's say for example you have an HTML file and inside that HTML file you have a body and inside the body maybe you have a paragraph and another paragraph and maybe you have a button so there are three elements here so in the previous video I made about CSS the only selector I talked about if I recall correctly is that you could select a tag so if I put P here then any style information that I put here like font size you know 12point any style information that I put there gets applied to all paragraphs however here's a question for you what if what you want to do is this I'm very little room here by the way it seems like I might be in a big space very crowded the thing you're I'm banging into um what if what if what you wanted to do was apply this font size only to this paragraph well in that case there's a concept known as an ID so okay so let's make a list here over here I'm gonna make a little box here what are the kinds of selectors now I'm sure there's a much longer more indepth explanation of this that involves lots of like sub detail ideas of how you combine selectors and subcategory selectors but at its core there are three main kinds of selectors there is the tag itself so all members of a tag type so button would apply to all buttons on the page P would apply to all paragraphs on the page and you know you can extend from there the other types of Dom element now there's a new kind called an ID which is a single Dom element so you can give a Dom element an ID as follows P ID equals unicorn so by this is called an attribute so this is an attribute for this particular Dom element it gets an ID in addition there's a space there I'll type this out in the computer which will make it more clear but there's a space between the P and then you say ID equals unicorn so now if you wanted to apply style to just this you might think what you would write is just the term unicorn this is not exactly correct though now this is conceptually the right idea but IDs are indicated by this pound symbol or as you people who live in today's age would call it a hash symbol so the same thing you use for a hash tag this pounds a pound but you know I like I think of the old phones I mean new phones have this do the pound symbol anyway it's not important but I like going off to the page here so if I say this pound unicorn that indicates I'm looking for an HTML element with the ID unicorn now you could do weird things like add the ID unicorn to this one but you should not because the third kind of tag sorry tag is the wrong word that's a tag pair paragraph tag third kind of selector is called as a class so class is a way of creating a group of elements your own group grouping a bunch together so let's say you have a hundred paragraph elements on the page but you want a way of selecting or applying a style to just those ten you could make those all the members of a certain class you could add a class could go across multiple kinds of Dom element so you could have a bunch of paragraphs and a bunch of image tags and a bunch of div tags and they could all be members of the same class so there and and incidentally the class is indicated by a dot so a tag is just the tag itself P if IMG div an ID is a sign via this hash symbol and a class via the dot and if I wanted to make this paragraph a member of a class you know class equals rainbow okay so this is I said I'm just gonna talk about the Select and select all functions work but I'm sure starting from this place of CSS which i think is actually maybe a nicer place to start so I want to look I'm gonna open make an example that looks at how you apply a particular style to an ID to attach to a tag to an ID and to a class and once we have that I will also show you how to then access elements on the page via those same ideas select all the paragraphs select all the buttons or select this single button with a given ID okay so coming back over here I am at 6 minutes here let's make an example now to make this example what I want to actually do is and the volume still working I want to actually do is I want to start adding some HTML so let's do this p ID equals unicorn and can you see this class equals rainbow unicorns and then I'll make another one that has class equals rainbow and this is unicorns and rainbows I need more space here for my weird so you know it's actually a unicorn it's a single unit a unicorn and this is rainbows this is more rainbows and this is you know just a plain paragraph just a plain paragraph so what I'm showing you here is that I now have four paragraphs if I select by paragraph I'll get all four if i select by unicorn ID I'll just get the first if i select by the rainbow class I will get all three so let's look at this if I hit run you can see there all of the paragraphs now let's add some style and let's say unicorn right this is is font size 16 point rainbow is I'm not just do font size just to be font size is 12 point and P font size now something really strange is going to happen here 8 point and let's actually let's make these quite a bit bigger 48 24 12 so let's look at what's happening now so something strange is going on here which I didn't even really anticipate when starting this video but I think this is kind of an important way of looking at it what I probably should have done to be more clear is done something entirely different to all three kinds but notice all of those are paragraphs so they should all be 12point right but some of them are members of the rainbow class those are 24 points and one of those that's a member of the rainbow class is actually has the ID unicorn so it's a 48 point so one thing you'll notice is there's a kind of a hierarchy here an ID the more specific you are the more important that style information is assigned so in other words the font size 48.4 an ID overrides what it was given for the class or tag but we could do some things here too so that's one thing that's important to see class overrides tag ID overrides class cuz you're getting more specific tag is very general like all the paragraphs class is like well a group of those paragraphs an ID is like no no no no not all of them not even a group of them this exact specific one so that takes greatest precedence it's not the you could think it's the order that I wrote it there but I'm almost certain that if I move this from here to the bottom it's the same so it's not the order it's the it's the order of precedence is not the order you type them it's actually goes from tag class to ID but let's let's make this a little bit more clear let's do something like padding a 16point background color you know F 0 F and then rainbow is the ones that are rainbow actually so let's and then we'll split the background color here and then the font size for unicorn is 48 points so this I think makes a bit more sense where you can see that all of the paragraphs get 16 point of padding all of the paragraphs that are members of the rainbow class get a purple background and only the one that has the unicorn ID gets a font size of 48 point so this is a way of looking at how selecting by tag or selecting by class or selecting by ID will allow you to address elements and their style in print more or less specific ways now this video is about 10 minutes long that's it at the beginning I'm going to talk about the Select and select all function and then kind of to lead up to that I wanted to look at the different ways of selecting things which are come back over here which are which are by tag by ID or by class so actually I think now what I would suggest to you is create for yourself a page which has a whole bunch of Dom elements in it use different tags paragraph image button etc give some of things IDs give group things by class and see if you can assign them all different styles and how that works and what what overrides what just play around with that for a little bit because in the next video what I will show you how to do is what I said I was going to do at the beginning of this one is then start to select them into you bring them into your code so that you could dynamically assign behaviors or events or callbacks or dynamic styles via this idea of IDs and classes and that sort of thing so that's what I'll actually do in the next video but I'm going to say like stop prepare yourself the page and then in the next video we're gonna look at the JavaScript aspect of that ok so thank you for coming and listening to unicorn and you the unicorn and rainbows show which apparently is what this is and I'm going to hit come Mouse come I'm gonna stop this video and start the
