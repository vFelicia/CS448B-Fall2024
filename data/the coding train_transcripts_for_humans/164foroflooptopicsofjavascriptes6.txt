00:00 - I'm here to tell you
about something that's
00:02 - kind of exciting that I
really should have known
00:04 - about when I made this video.
00:05 - But it's new to me.
00:06 - And it's now going
to be new to you,
00:08 - or maybe you know about already.
00:09 - But I'm going to show you
this new loop in JavaScript
00:12 - called for of.
00:14 - That's what I'm going
to call it, for of.
00:16 - So very, very often,
the previous example
00:18 - that I just made, this
happens all the time,
00:22 - all the time in programming.
00:23 - Hey, I've got an
array of things.
00:25 - Let me count through
the whole array
00:27 - to act on everything
in the array.
00:29 - And this can happen
with arrays of objects,
00:31 - like I want to move and
show all these objects.
00:33 - It could happen with
arrays of numbers,
00:35 - like, ah, let me double all
the numbers in this array,
00:37 - or let me add up all the
numbers in this array.
00:39 - And there's actually other
ways of doing that too
00:41 - that I'm going to get
to in other videos.
00:42 - But what I want to show you
here is the for of loop.
00:46 - So really what this is saying
here is, for every bubble
00:51 - in the bubbles array.
00:53 - The problem is I
think "in" already
00:55 - meant something else in
JavaScript, or "each" always--
00:58 - there is a for each thing.
00:59 - So I'm speculating here.
01:02 - But I imagine that when this
feature came into JavaScript,
01:06 - the developers needed
a word to pick.
01:08 - And that word is "of."
01:09 - So what I'm actually
going to say
01:10 - is like, this bubbles index
i stands in for every element
01:15 - of the array bubbles.
01:17 - So I can actually do the exact
same loop by saying for let
01:23 - every bubble of bubbles, and
then bubble.move-- whoops,
01:28 - not bubbles--
01:31 - and bubble.show.
01:33 - Now, so this is what I
want to emphasize here.
01:36 - These are exactly-- and I'm
going to step to the side here.
01:39 - These are exactly the same.
01:41 - Let me move my mouse
out of the way.
01:42 - No.
01:43 - It must look perfect
on the screen here.
01:45 - This is me counting
with an index
01:47 - to address every
element in the array
01:50 - and moving and showing them.
01:51 - This is me just saying,
hey, JavaScript,
01:53 - I don't feel like
counting today.
01:54 - Could you take care
of this for me?
01:56 - Just give me every single bubble
in order in the array bubbles,
02:00 - and move and show them.
02:01 - Now, I'm going to do
things in later videos
02:03 - where I start deleting
things out of the array,
02:05 - or maybe I only want
to use half the array.
02:08 - Then those are cases where
I really need the counter.
02:10 - There are often cases where
the counter plays a role.
02:13 - But if the counter
doesn't play a role
02:14 - and I just want to do
something to every element,
02:16 - this is what I could do.
02:17 - Now, what I don't love
about this then is--
02:19 - I do this all the time and
lots of programmers do this.
02:22 - I have a class called Bubble.
02:24 - That's capital B down here.
02:27 - I have an array called
bubbles, lowercase b with an S
02:32 - on the end, plural
because it's many.
02:33 - And then I have bubble, which
is like an individual bubble
02:37 - that's every bubble
of the array.
02:39 - So I just want to emphasize
that this could just be called--
02:41 - if the bubble's
names were unicorn,
02:45 - this is just a made
up variable name.
02:47 - It is the word that stands in
for every element of the array.
02:51 - And so like I could say,
let element of bubbles,
02:54 - for example.
02:56 - But this is kind of a
convention that I could adopt.
02:59 - The class, the type of
thing is capital B Bubble.
03:02 - When I have an
array of them, I'm
03:04 - going to call it
bubbles with an S.
03:05 - When I have an individual one,
I'm going to call it bubble.
03:08 - But there's no reason why you
have to call things that way.
03:10 - I could call this bubble class,
single bubble, bubble array,
03:14 - that kind of thing.
03:15 - So that's really it.
03:16 - I'm going to use this--
03:19 - I'm going to use this kind
of loop in other videos.
03:21 - And then I guess I can reference
back to this one when I do.
03:24 - Hopefully this made sense.
03:27 - I'm looking around to see if
anybody has any questions.
03:30 - But you are in the future.
03:31 - I don't even know who you
are, watching this video.
03:33 - But you are there someday,
watching this video.
03:35 - I'm probably not
standing here anymore.
03:37 - I'm somewhere else.
03:38 - This video has ended.
