00:00 - and welcome hello my name is dan
00:04 - i am uh here live from the school for
00:06 - poetic computation
00:08 - on thursday morning around
00:11 - 10 in the morning on march 31st tomorrow
00:13 - is april fool's day
00:15 - um so i'm going to be here for an hour
00:17 - or so um
00:18 - doing some tutorials for you my glasses
00:21 - are
00:22 - quite dirty i should have washed them
00:25 - and the topic that i'm going to explore
00:27 - is
00:28 - uh video and pixels
00:31 - in p5.js that's my plan i have a couple
00:35 - things i want to do before i get to that
00:36 - i've got a live chat going on both
00:39 - twitch and youtube i believe so i'm
00:40 - going to check that see if there are any
00:41 - questions
00:42 - before i get to any of that i would like
00:44 - to know if the audio is okay a couple
00:46 - days ago i had this problem with the
00:48 - audio crackling so
00:49 - i would like to know if the audio sounds
00:51 - good the picture is good
00:53 - there's also this white board over here
00:56 - that i might use
00:56 - at some point so let me know i still am
00:58 - working out the lighting
01:00 - i don't really like it so far but let me
01:02 - know if this is at least uh sort of
01:03 - legible
01:05 - um and in focus uh and i'm back over
01:08 - here i'm gonna look at the chats now to
01:10 - see
01:10 - if people are saying that things sound
01:13 - okay
01:14 - less delay here and audio is good that's
01:16 - good to hear thank you very much
01:19 - uh audio is fine today awesome okay
01:22 - that's great um let's see let's see
01:24 - what's going on here we've got
01:26 - uh i don't know where my um
01:29 - admin panel on twitch is but that's okay
01:32 - uh i'm gonna look over here on youtube
01:34 - and there are seven people watching okay
01:36 - so um great like last time when i did
01:39 - this i spent like 45 minutes just like
01:40 - working out a technical problem so i'm
01:42 - just going to jump in today
01:43 - so actually the first thing i want to do
01:45 - um is
01:46 - i want to use i've been using um this
01:49 - thing that's behind me over here the p5
01:51 - editor
01:52 - and the p5 editor uh allows you to type
01:55 - your code
01:56 - and run your code and see the result in
01:59 - a browser but i want to work today
02:01 - in using a separate text editor sublime
02:03 - text
02:04 - and i want to just view the output in
02:06 - the chrome browser itself
02:08 - and i want to make a short video that
02:11 - talks about
02:11 - how to do that what it means to run a
02:14 - local server
02:16 - and also how to use the chrome developer
02:18 - tools in the console so i'm going to
02:20 - make a short video about that
02:22 - which will then allow me to use those
02:24 - tools in my other videos about video in
02:26 - p5
02:27 - that's my plan um so let me a couple
02:31 - things though
02:32 - actually uh let me see if i can find i
02:34 - should have done this
02:35 - in advance but i i have a license
02:38 - uh i have a license for
02:42 - um sublime text and i want to
02:48 - uh
02:50 - sublime text license i want to put in my
02:53 - license
02:54 - so that i don't get those pop-ups
02:55 - license key oh that's not right
02:59 - oh boy i'm never going to be able to uh
03:01 - all right i guess i'll worry about this
03:02 - later
03:04 - or maybe i won't worry about this later
03:06 - i'm going to do this now okay hold on a
03:08 - second i'm going to
03:10 - unplug this for a second uh
03:17 - i i just don't want to uh my email to i
03:19 - have to look up
03:20 - the license in my email and i don't want
03:22 - that to be broadcast live
03:24 - usually i don't care about this sort of
03:25 - stuff but
03:27 - you know who knows who's privately
03:29 - emailing me and doesn't want their name
03:30 - suddenly
03:30 - on the screen so i'm now i'm going to
03:32 - narrate what i'm doing here i'm looking
03:34 - at my computer
03:35 - and i'm looking for sublime license
03:40 - and if i search for that sublime license
03:43 - key 2012 is that when i purchase it
03:45 - let's see if that works
03:47 - and then i'm going to open up sublime
03:50 - and i'm going to go to preferences
03:55 - service license help purchase license
03:58 - enter license
04:00 - let me paste that in there use license
04:02 - thanks for purchasing
04:03 - great okay so that's done i can log out
04:06 - of my email
04:08 - and i can plug this back in
04:11 - and there it is and now i've got sublime
04:14 - over here
04:15 - and i'm gonna uh
04:19 - close this okay there's lots of extra
04:21 - stuff on the desktop here but i think
04:23 - that's okay
04:25 - i need terminal also open here
04:28 - the couple things that i want to
04:29 - reference
04:32 - i'm going to open up terminal um
04:35 - how's the font size let's make that a
04:37 - little bit bigger
04:39 - whoops and
04:44 - there we go that's probably pretty good
04:46 - move that over here
04:47 - the other thing i want to reference in
04:49 - this tutorial i'm going to make is
04:50 - i'm going to look for p5.js local
04:53 - there's a wiki page
04:55 - p5.js local server one of these days
04:58 - i'll have my computer positioned in such
05:00 - a way that i can look at the camera
05:03 - but i'm looking down it's particularly
05:05 - low the laptop in here i can probably
05:07 - get it a little bit
05:08 - higher you could see you can see all my
05:10 - lovely stickers uh okay so i want to
05:12 - reference this webpage
05:14 - where am i standing right about here um
05:17 - and so if i move this here and do
05:20 - this hit refresh
05:26 - you can see this here okay so now i have
05:29 - terminal
05:32 - oh and i have sublime
05:35 - let me make this window
05:40 - like this
05:45 - okay and now okay so that's good
05:48 - now the other thing i want to do is just
05:50 - make a dummy sketch
05:53 - so i'm going to do that i'm going to
05:55 - oops i lost ah don't disconnect computer
05:58 - i'm going to just check and see if
05:59 - anybody's asking anything
06:01 - [Music]
06:05 - somebody's reporting a slight little
06:06 - jump in the sound every now and then
06:08 - anybody let me know if you're having um
06:12 - any issues no i didn't wait four years i
06:15 - i
06:15 - what i do so the issue the reason why i
06:17 - had to enter in my license key is like
06:19 - the least interesting
06:20 - thing i could ever possibly talk about
06:21 - on a live stream but the reason why
06:23 - is because i created a new user login to
06:25 - this computer
06:26 - so i could configure the screen the way
06:28 - i want it for tutorials which is
06:30 - separate from my regular login and so i
06:31 - just never licensed
06:33 - sublime in that login okay so i want to
06:37 - hide the sidebar
06:42 - and i want to
06:45 - do this on the desktop as
06:48 - a test sketch
06:53 - and let's say create canvas
06:58 - 320 240 and um
07:03 - background zero and line
07:07 - x mod something like
07:11 - ellipse x
07:14 - uh 120 sorry i'm just gonna put
07:16 - something in here
07:18 - and our x equals zero
07:21 - and x equals x plus one
07:24 - if x i don't know i need a better
07:27 - default sketch
07:28 - so this is just a sketch that does
07:30 - something
07:32 - oops oh it's running in the browser
07:33 - already
07:35 - uh off
07:38 - okay okay great
07:42 - okay so um great i think i'm about ready
07:46 - to go let's see
07:47 - who we've got here is anybody here
07:50 - um sound is fine very minor um
07:54 - okay 11 people good morning good morning
07:58 - time for some jumping jacks everybody
08:00 - stand up do some jumping jacks with me
08:03 - that probably did something weird to
08:04 - your sound um okay so i'm
08:06 - getting ready i'm um to this morning the
08:09 - topic will be
08:10 - a video recorded video live video in p5
08:13 - the first tutorial i'm going to do is
08:15 - simply about um
08:17 - running a local server and editing your
08:19 - code in a separate text editor
08:21 - um because um and looking at the chrome
08:24 - developer console i've got my
08:27 - whiteboard over here which i will erase
08:32 - i don't think i need it for this video
08:36 - [Music]
08:37 - and i oh oh i'm wearing these headphones
08:40 - which is totally unnecessary
08:43 - good thing i noticed that it'll be weird
08:45 - to record a whole video wearing
08:46 - headphones
08:47 - um i was testing the audio which seemed
08:50 - fine
08:51 - let me give myself some more slack here
08:54 - i don't know what i'm doing with this
08:56 - um okay let's get started
09:01 - just i'm gonna cycle the cameras so they
09:03 - don't
09:04 - turn off automatically
09:17 - and now
09:22 - here we go okay so this should be a
09:25 - short five to ten minute video
09:27 - tutorial lesson about what i said it was
09:30 - gonna be about okay let's just get
09:31 - started
09:32 - i'm gonna do the opposite the other day
09:33 - i took like 45 minutes before i did
09:35 - anything i'm just going to try to get
09:36 - going
09:37 - and here we go
09:42 - hello in this video where should i stand
09:44 - what do you think
09:45 - in this video i'm going to look at how
09:48 - to
09:48 - work on your p5.js sketch or really any
09:51 - html javascript css combo thingamabob
09:54 - um outside of in any old text editor
09:59 - by running a local server on your laptop
10:02 - now what does that mean
10:03 - actually i'm going to use the whiteboard
10:04 - for a second so let's just think about
10:06 - the internet and the web and all that
10:08 - stuff for a second
10:09 - so you are making a web page and you
10:13 - have a laptop and to make your web page
10:15 - you're maybe editing an html file maybe
10:18 - you have a css
10:19 - file maybe you have a javascript file
10:21 - and you're editing all these files
10:22 - they're just plain text files
10:24 - and you're editing them in some text
10:26 - editor
10:27 - so the text editor i'm going to use
10:29 - happens to be one called sublime
10:31 - but you can use any text editor
10:34 - list of text editors i would say now if
10:37 - i could think of them but you
10:39 - i'll put some in the comments and you
10:40 - can write some in the comments your
10:41 - favorite put your favorite text editor
10:43 - in the comments
10:44 - so but i'm going to use sublime text so
10:45 - you're editing these files now one of
10:47 - the things i'm going to show you
10:49 - is that you know another thing that
10:51 - you're going to run on your laptop
10:53 - is a thing called a browser and your
10:56 - browser actually has the ability just to
10:58 - open those files so you could
11:00 - ask your browser open the html file and
11:02 - you're going to see
11:03 - that the result of that file in the
11:05 - browser are going to fix
11:06 - the mic here in the middle of this video
11:13 - hold on i can um pause
11:16 - um it's fine you know what i'm gonna
11:20 - start over
11:23 - i don't need to start over i'm just
11:25 - gonna fix the mic
11:27 - uh and i'll edit it together i keep
11:28 - doing that um
11:31 - what's a better way i don't know why
11:34 - all right maybe i should just suck it up
11:36 - and button this shirt
11:38 - where am i
11:48 - come up like this
11:53 - you know what i should do is probably
11:55 - like loop it and then use a piece of
11:57 - tape
11:58 - there are all these professional ways of
11:59 - doing this
12:05 - i'm getting a text message
12:08 - or no just somebody just a notification
12:12 - on my phone
12:12 - wait okay um i think that's gonna be
12:16 - better with the audio now let me go back
12:18 - and just see
12:20 - um um let's see what's going on here
12:23 - the mic was fine oh thanks i know but
12:26 - it was the i the mic might have been
12:28 - fine um
12:29 - audio wise but i it was like tugging on
12:31 - me and it was feeling weird so
12:33 - i'm gonna uh pick up from where i left
12:36 - off somehow
12:40 - okay edit edit
12:44 - somehow i'll edit this edit edit magic
12:48 - edit
12:49 - so um crap i don't even know what i was
12:53 - like talking about
12:54 - try that again okay the thing that i'm
12:56 - talking about is
12:59 - uh the browser opening the file in the
13:01 - browser okay
13:05 - magic edit so if you open those files
13:10 - from the browser you're going to see the
13:11 - result of those files in the browser
13:13 - now let's think of what's your ultimate
13:15 - goal here the ultimately
13:17 - the idea probably is that you have a
13:19 - server
13:21 - server and you have your server hosting
13:25 - some website you know website.com
13:28 - and ultimately what you're going to do
13:29 - is you're going to take your files and
13:31 - put them on a server
13:32 - so that other people on their laptops
13:35 - and computers or phones or whatever it
13:37 - is
13:37 - can connect and look at your files so
13:40 - by opening the file by opening the html
13:44 - file from the browser
13:46 - you aren't actually doing what the web
13:48 - server itself will do
13:49 - which will ultimately serve up the files
13:52 - so that other people can request them
13:54 - so a better and in fact a lot of things
13:56 - won't work if you just open those files
13:58 - so uh
14:02 - okay i have to keep going i can't start
14:04 - over and erase all this
14:05 - um so um so
14:09 - ultimately what you want to do is by the
14:11 - way like the
14:12 - you know the youtube makes these charts
14:14 - you can look at these charts where you
14:16 - see people drop off and stop watching
14:17 - your video and just about everybody
14:19 - stops watching this video now but for
14:20 - the few of you are remaining i'm going
14:22 - to keep going with this
14:23 - so what you ultimately want to do is run
14:25 - something which i'll call
14:27 - a local server so if you run a local web
14:30 - server on this machine you are more
14:32 - accurately simulating what will happen
14:33 - when you eventually
14:35 - upload your files to a server and
14:37 - everything will look and work and
14:38 - function
14:39 - correctly so this is what i want to show
14:41 - you in this video
14:43 - how do you edit your files with a text
14:45 - editor
14:46 - run a local server so that you can see
14:48 - the result in the file
14:49 - of those files in your browser and
14:52 - accurately simulate the environment that
14:53 - will eventually exist when you
14:55 - publish your stuff to the world and
14:57 - become
14:59 - the person who publishes their stuff for
15:00 - the world there we go okay so let's go
15:02 - back to the computer now
15:03 - and take a look at this so this is
15:05 - actually the p5 desktop editor which you
15:07 - may or may not have used
15:09 - actually does all this for you it's a
15:11 - text editor you hit this run button
15:13 - and it spawns a local server it opens a
15:16 - little browser which shows your page
15:18 - but what i'm going to do actually is i'm
15:19 - going to just quit
15:21 - out of it and i'm going to show you that
15:24 - if i go to my computer's
15:26 - desktop i don't know if you can't really
15:28 - see this and i go here
15:30 - i was actually i made i there's a folder
15:32 - called test sketch
15:34 - and in this folder are the files
15:36 - associated
15:37 - with my sketch there's an html file
15:41 - a javascript file and a folder called
15:42 - libraries that libraries folder is where
15:44 - the p5.js library itself exists
15:47 - so what i want to do is now i have
15:49 - something i have a text editor called
15:51 - sublime text you can google it you can
15:52 - find it you can use any text editor you
15:54 - want
15:55 - and what i want to do is look at those
15:57 - files in sublime text
15:58 - one way i can do that is actually just
16:00 - take this and drag it in
16:02 - and now you can see here that i have now
16:05 - have
16:05 - i'm now browsing and looking at those
16:07 - files and if i wanted to edit my code i
16:09 - could look at it right here
16:10 - and now i can edit the code i can
16:12 - actually make the font a little bit
16:13 - bigger
16:15 - and you can see here i'm editing my code
16:17 - now let me make the next point
16:20 - if i just go back here and click on this
16:23 - html file i have no idea what's going to
16:24 - happen it's going to open it in some
16:25 - default browser it might be safari it
16:27 - might be chrome
16:28 - if i open it it opens in chrome and you
16:30 - can see it's working it's actually
16:32 - running
16:32 - but look what's happening up here it's
16:35 - opening it from the file path
16:38 - file users processing desktops test
16:41 - sketch
16:41 - so while this works there are a lot of
16:44 - things
16:45 - that won't work when you're opening it
16:48 - just from the file path
16:49 - itself that only work if you're using a
16:52 - local server running a local server
16:54 - certain things like
16:55 - loading an image file into your sketch
16:57 - for example won't work
16:58 - so while this is okay as a solution a
17:01 - quick and dirty test
17:02 - i personally would recommend never doing
17:04 - it this way instead you want to run a
17:06 - local server
17:07 - so there happens to be this wiki
17:10 - on github under the p5.js wiki which
17:13 - has a bunch of different instructions of
17:16 - different ways
17:16 - you can run a local server on different
17:19 - operating systems
17:20 - windows linux mac apache the thing that
17:23 - i'm going to use which i think is the
17:24 - simplest
17:26 - is you i'm since i'm on a mac and a macs
17:29 - come with python installed
17:31 - i can just run a python local server
17:33 - from any directory i want
17:35 - so what i'm going to do the way i'm
17:37 - going to do this is by running
17:39 - terminal so if you don't know where
17:40 - terminal is it's in the
17:42 - the you know applications utilities
17:44 - there's an application called terminal
17:46 - when you run it it looks something like
17:47 - this this is giving you
17:49 - console command line access to your
17:51 - computer and i can type various things
17:53 - like if i type
17:54 - pwd that stands for print working
17:56 - directory
17:58 - and you can see oh i'm in user slash
18:00 - processing and if i just type cd that
18:02 - means
18:03 - change directory and if i type desktop i
18:05 - want to change to the desktop
18:07 - and now if i type p pwd
18:10 - i could see ah i'm in users processing
18:12 - desktop other things i can do is i can
18:13 - hit the up arrow
18:14 - the up arrow goes to my most recent
18:16 - command and i see it again
18:18 - and now if i'm on the desktop i can run
18:21 - a local server from here and i can say
18:23 - python
18:24 - dash m simple http server
18:27 - so this just happens to be a command
18:29 - that i have memorized
18:30 - but i'm saying i want to run a python
18:32 - program that's built into the macintosh
18:34 - it's called simple http server i forget
18:36 - what the dash m stands for
18:38 - somebody will tell me in the comments i
18:40 - hit enter
18:42 - and you can see ah serving http on zero
18:45 - zero zero port eight thousand
18:47 - what this means is my this computer is
18:49 - now running a web server
18:51 - where is the web server running it's
18:52 - running on localhost and another way of
18:54 - saying localhost is 0.0.0.0. so
18:58 - that's the ip address the internet
19:00 - protocol address the address the numeric
19:02 - address of a computer on the internet
19:04 - and those numbers can become rather
19:05 - important but for us right now we can
19:07 - just think of it as localhost
19:08 - port 8000 being the port that other
19:11 - people can connect to
19:12 - who are the other people they're me so i
19:15 - am the other person
19:16 - and what i want to do now is go up here
19:18 - right and instead of accessing my sketch
19:21 - from file what i want to do
19:24 - is say http localhost now you can see
19:28 - i've done this before on this computer
19:30 - so it's already like pre-filling it in
19:32 - but i want to go to localhost colon port
19:35 - 8000.
19:36 - localhost colon port 8000 i hit enter
19:39 - now you don't actually see my sketch
19:41 - because actually i what i now see
19:43 - is a view of everything on the desktop
19:46 - so you can see i have a bunch of other
19:47 - things like i was doing this
19:49 - photo booth um p5 demo
19:54 - which uh has this snap button which
19:56 - allows me to take so this is something
19:58 - i'm going to make a tutorial about in a
19:59 - minute another video
20:00 - watch a video a few videos from now
20:02 - you'll find this one but you can see i'm
20:04 - sort of browsing this is the minimum
20:06 - spanning tree example so i have a bunch
20:08 - of
20:09 - folders with sketches i'm sort of
20:10 - serving up that whole my whole desktop
20:12 - which i can choose to do or not to do
20:14 - but what i'm looking for is test sketch
20:17 - this is the one and i can make it bigger
20:19 - in chrome by
20:20 - shift command plus so now i see the
20:23 - sketch running
20:25 - and i could go back to the code and i
20:27 - could say hey let me change the
20:28 - background to 100
20:29 - hit save tab over to chrome hit refresh
20:32 - and you can see now i have the new
20:33 - sketch running so this is another way of
20:36 - working
20:36 - outside of some all-in-one editor
20:39 - environment
20:41 - text editor local server browser but
20:44 - missing piece let's say
20:47 - in draw the draw loop i want to debug
20:51 - the value of
20:52 - x so i'm going to say console.log
20:56 - x now i could have said print line x
20:58 - print line is a p5 specific function
21:00 - that prints
21:01 - something to the console console.log is
21:04 - the sort of native javascript version of
21:06 - that function
21:07 - basically the same thing but if i put
21:09 - that in there
21:10 - and i go back and hit refresh where is
21:12 - it
21:13 - i don't see it no log no console so in
21:16 - chrome i can use something called the
21:19 - chrome developer tools are you excited
21:23 - you shouldn't be maybe you are maybe you
21:25 - should be i don't know
21:26 - so where do you get those view up here
21:29 - under view
21:30 - developer developer tools but i want to
21:33 - go straight to the javascript console
21:35 - the developer tools are this
21:37 - massive thing that has all sorts of
21:39 - inspect this look at that
21:40 - html css style this magic this all
21:44 - i really care about is the javascript
21:45 - console right now i want to see things
21:47 - that are console.logged
21:49 - so i'm going to select javascript
21:51 - console
21:52 - and it's going to appear now it won't
21:54 - necessarily look like this on your
21:57 - computer you're probably going to see it
21:58 - at the bottom
21:59 - you're probably going to see it a lot
22:00 - smaller but what i've done
22:03 - is you know you can you can there's
22:05 - various ways you can like move it around
22:07 - and change the font size you know i want
22:08 - it to be kind of
22:10 - rather big so i can
22:13 - for a tutorial you can see it so what's
22:16 - nice here is you can see there's the
22:18 - result and it's showing me
22:19 - this each one of these things is
22:20 - printing from sketch.js line number
22:22 - eight
22:23 - so if i go over here and see line number
22:25 - eight console.log x so that's great
22:28 - now i can also comment this out and
22:30 - refresh the sketch
22:31 - one of the wonderful things about the
22:33 - chrome javascript console
22:35 - is that it is interactive what do i mean
22:38 - by that
22:38 - i can actually type in the value x
22:41 - the variable x which is a variable in my
22:43 - program hit enter and it's going to show
22:45 - me the current value of x
22:46 - so i can kind of live debug as the
22:48 - program's running
22:50 - i can do other things like i could say x
22:52 - equals 50.
22:54 - getting to the other side of the screen
22:55 - hit enter and you can see that i
22:57 - actually changed on the fly the value of
22:59 - that variable
22:59 - and it moved i can do other things like
23:02 - what if i said no loop
23:03 - no loop is a function in p5 that turns
23:06 - off draw
23:08 - and suddenly it stops looping i can say
23:11 - loop i can do things like just call
23:15 - other functions like if i say create p
23:18 - hello
23:19 - create p is a p5 function that creates a
23:21 - paragraph dom element
23:23 - and there you go hello is right there
23:25 - it's also showing me what's in that dom
23:27 - element and there's
23:28 - so there's a lot more to this and i'll
23:30 - as i make other tutorials that use the
23:32 - chrome developer console
23:33 - you'll see more and more about it so
23:36 - this has been about
23:36 - 10 minutes hopefully this helped you
23:39 - make sense of the world
23:42 - it's a very hard world to make sense of
23:44 - these days and this probably doesn't
23:45 - help make sense of the world but it
23:47 - makes
23:47 - sense of a small part of the world the
23:50 - local server on your laptop with the
23:52 - chrome developer tools
23:53 - i'm sure you have questions um
23:56 - and i will answer them somehow in a way
24:00 - i don't know how yet but
24:01 - in in the comments of this video or in
24:04 - another video
24:05 - um and i look forward to seeing you in
24:08 - the next video maybe
24:09 - maybe maybe not okay thanks very much
24:11 - i'm a hit stop
24:15 - okay um so i'm now still live streaming
24:19 - for those of you but i recorded that i
24:20 - need to edit it together unfortunately
24:22 - uh uh okay
24:26 - let me i'm gonna read through the
24:28 - discussion here for a second to see if i
24:29 - have anything to add
24:31 - uh regarding text editors j edit oh adam
24:34 - from github is a good one
24:35 - probably should have mentioned that note
24:37 - tab visual studio code brackets is good
24:40 - notepad
24:41 - brackets has a built-in server yeah i
24:44 - probably should use all these
24:46 - uh someone says hoping for connect
24:47 - discussion today we'll see if we can get
24:48 - to that
24:49 - uh okay microphone fell off okay
24:54 - m is for oh m is for module probably
24:56 - localhost i thought localhost was always
24:58 - 127.0.0
25:00 - that is correct i don't know why python
25:02 - is telling me so let's let's let's
25:04 - investigate this 127.0.0.1
25:09 - that obviously works as it should
25:12 - 0.0.0.0
25:15 - also works so these are just other ways
25:18 - that seem to work
25:22 - um oops that's funny
25:25 - uh not so funny these are i guess either
25:28 - those work
25:28 - all zeroes are localized okay um let me
25:31 - check
25:33 - uh twitch uh dash
25:36 - m mod run library module as a script
25:40 - terminates option list um okay
25:44 - uh great all right so now that i made
25:47 - that
25:48 - video and finished it i'm just gonna do
25:50 - something i need to rename the files
25:52 - because i get confused later so if you
25:54 - guys won't mind bearing with me
25:56 - here you can't see this unfortunately i
25:58 - have another computer which records
26:00 - video files to disk
26:01 - and what i can do is do i don't know
26:05 - which one these are
26:06 - i'm going to call this a local server
26:10 - one
26:14 - local because i local server
26:17 - two uh
26:21 - local server three
26:24 - okay so i named those files so hopefully
26:26 - those will get
26:27 - saved um and
26:32 - here we go oh wow there's 30 people
26:34 - watching on youtube that's amazing hello
26:36 - everybody
26:37 - okay so um let me take a minute here for
26:40 - all of you watching live
26:45 - to just say say a few words about my
26:47 - kind of overall plan
26:50 - so i keep this uh github gist
26:53 - um i don't know i guess if you go to get
26:55 - gist.github.com
26:56 - shiffman you can probably find it um
26:59 - this is where i keep track of like a
27:01 - list of everything i hope to make
27:02 - um some new some and i have some larger
27:05 - series that i'm hoping to do i
27:07 - kind of don't for some reason i've been
27:09 - shying away from getting
27:10 - i'm hoping next week to pick one of
27:12 - these i want to make some videos about
27:13 - neural networks which i've been afraid
27:15 - of doing but i've just decided i'm gonna
27:17 - there's so much happening in um kind of
27:19 - the machine learning with art
27:21 - creative coding stuff that i feel like i
27:23 - should maybe try to revisit that
27:24 - even though it terrifies me it's not
27:26 - really necessarily area of my expertise
27:28 - i've been working with the raspberry pi
27:29 - in processing so i want to make a few
27:31 - videos about that
27:32 - uh chrome extensions is something we
27:34 - want to do a lot of people have
27:35 - requested
27:36 - node plus p5 so i want to do that i've
27:39 - made a bunch of videos about the kinect
27:41 - and computer vision and
27:43 - i want to do more of those um
27:47 - some other p5.js and sound i want to
27:49 - make a whole set of git
27:50 - tutorials and then i think what i don't
27:53 - know why
27:54 - uh video so one thing that i want to do
27:56 - i guess this isn't really
27:58 - is i think what i want to try to tackle
27:59 - today is video in p5 so let's let me
28:02 - make a list
28:04 - and you guys can uh chime in
28:07 - i'm going to make a list here just for
28:09 - right now
28:10 - um
28:13 - of how i'm thinking of approaching this
28:16 - so
28:17 - what i want to look at is
28:21 - i'm trying to decide if i usually record
28:23 - i'm going to do create capture first
28:26 - i think the live video stuff is a little
28:27 - bit more interesting not more
28:28 - interesting but
28:30 - i kind of like so just basic create
28:32 - capture
28:34 - i did these the other day but the audio
28:35 - was had crackles in it so i'm going to
28:37 - redo them
28:38 - then i'm going to show how to use create
28:39 - capture to do a photo booth
28:42 - with snapshots
28:46 - um then i want to examine
28:50 - looking at pixel array
28:54 - um so
28:57 - i'm in a pixel process um
29:00 - then we'll do like a brightness mirror
29:04 - and then we'll do like a painting
29:07 - uh paint a portrait
29:11 - um from live video
29:15 - um these are all the things i want to do
29:17 - and then i'm trying to think of what
29:19 - else
29:20 - uh
29:23 - the other thing that i like to
29:24 - demonstrate is how to make a like
29:26 - muybridge
29:28 - style um video history
29:33 - you know slit scan is an interesting
29:35 - thing to look at how to do
29:36 - how to make how to make a slit scan
29:40 - that could be good so this is kind of
29:43 - what i have
29:44 - in mind i would like to do all of these
29:45 - today it's 10 30 i have till
29:47 - about noon and then i'll take a break
29:50 - for a while and i might come back this
29:51 - afternoon and do some more
29:52 - so look at this list think about it i'm
29:54 - gonna look in the chat
29:56 - um nobody's really said anything here
29:58 - i've got so the other thing i've got is
29:59 - i've got youtube live going
30:01 - and twitch live going i don't know if
30:02 - that's kind of ridiculous i was hoping
30:04 - maybe some people would find me
30:06 - with twitch um but
30:10 - i don't see too many uh comments here
30:13 - let's see if anything's happening on
30:14 - twitter
30:15 - uh oh i have a lot of notifications
30:17 - because you can ask me questions there
30:20 - too
30:23 - uh
30:23 - [Music]
30:27 - uh interesting
30:30 - um okay uh sorry i was reading some
30:34 - somebody wrote an interesting comment on
30:35 - twitter
30:36 - which is i would prefer to back you on
30:39 - patreon monthly than subject
30:41 - users to ads so it's an interesting
30:44 - question i've started um
30:46 - you know i put ads on the youtube videos
30:49 - i can't decide whether that's a good
30:50 - idea or not
30:51 - you know my kind of excuse for doing
30:52 - that is i want to close
30:54 - caption everything um for hearing
30:56 - impaired
30:57 - um and it costs if i pay a service to
31:00 - that it costs about 20
31:00 - 25 per video and i was thinking if i put
31:02 - ads and once each video gets about 20 or
31:04 - 25
31:05 - then i'll close caption it you know i
31:08 - honestly like if this were
31:09 - i would love to do this uh more of it
31:12 - and if it's a
31:13 - you know i kind of do it in connection
31:15 - with my teaching at nyu so on the one
31:17 - hand i'm happy to just
31:18 - do this um but also maybe maybe there is
31:20 - sort of a business model for doing this
31:22 - i don't know
31:23 - i feel very sheepish about this but if
31:25 - anybody has any feedback about that
31:27 - if the ads really bother you or don't
31:28 - bother you um
31:30 - let me know uh
31:34 - okay um
31:38 - lauren covered slit scan on cadenza oh
31:40 - that's great to know i guess
31:41 - maybe i'll do it also here um okay so
31:44 - i'm going to
31:46 - get started with this then i think and
31:48 - i'm going to do all of these
31:51 - my preference right now is to
31:55 - use sublime and
31:58 - uh uh
32:01 - and and run things oh and run things
32:05 - uh locally so let me get set up for that
32:07 - sorry
32:09 - uh let me make a folder called p5.js
32:12 - video and i'm going to give myself a
32:16 - little shortcut to that
32:18 - here and uh
32:21 - let me make a
32:24 - uh sorry where am i where am i where am
32:27 - i where am
32:28 - i um let me just grab
32:32 - um let me grab this test sketch and put
32:36 - it in there
32:38 - and call it uh
32:42 - one create capture
32:45 - and so i can save these for later
32:49 - and i'm going to uh
32:53 - take this oops
32:56 - and put it open it with sublime
32:59 - and move this back over oh uncreate
33:03 - capture
33:03 - sketch
33:08 - okay so we see that
33:11 - and just so i see that something is
33:13 - there get this set up
33:16 - uh if i look at the html file o1
33:20 - create capture
33:23 - get rid of this and close that
33:29 - and now i want to
33:32 - go to p5.js
33:35 - under for video run my local server
33:40 - and and
33:43 - uh i don't need this
33:46 - a local host there we go create capture
33:50 - there we go sublime
33:54 - browser sublime browser sublime browser
33:57 - terminal i don't need that open and
34:00 - there we go
34:00 - okay everyone i think i'm ready to check
34:02 - the chat one more time
34:07 - and yes i have
34:11 - so patreon is something i am considering
34:18 - um
34:21 - uh some so some people write uh
34:23 - paraglider writes ads are okay with me
34:26 - the other person writes most people that
34:27 - are opinionated about ads probably run
34:29 - in ad blocker anyway
34:31 - i'm used to the video and image
34:32 - processing features
34:38 - um yeah so some people are asking
34:42 - questions in the chat about the p5
34:44 - editor i don't want to get too
34:45 - lost in a discussion about that because
34:47 - i want to get started with this video
34:48 - tutorial
34:49 - but i will say that one of the things
34:50 - that the processing foundation is
34:52 - actively working on right now is a
34:54 - web-based editor
34:55 - that can run in the browser i think one
34:57 - of the tricky things about a javascript
35:00 - web creative coding environment is there
35:02 - are numerous ways you could
35:04 - develop you could use something like
35:05 - atom you could do something like
35:07 - brackets you could use something like
35:08 - codepen
35:09 - and so uh in order in creating a kind of
35:11 - beginner-friendly platform
35:13 - i think having a one that might be sort
35:15 - of geared towards education in that
35:17 - sense
35:17 - uh having a web-based editor makes a lot
35:19 - of sense um
35:21 - but there is uh but um but yeah so
35:24 - anyway that's all i want to kind of say
35:25 - about that i hear some
35:26 - some noise in the other room
35:31 - but i won't worry about it okay i'm back
35:35 - uh
35:39 - okay um here we go so
35:43 - can you guys hear that by the way
35:47 - it's a little distracting for me there's
35:49 - people talking and playing music
35:50 - nearby but i'll just keep going anyway
35:55 - 33 people are watching i better get
35:56 - started okay
35:58 - that's distracting you guys maybe you
35:59 - guys can't hear that it doesn't really
36:01 - matter
36:02 - i'm gonna cycle the cameras
36:16 - i'm gonna just hey everybody i'm just
36:17 - gonna mute myself for a second
36:20 - i'm gonna go see what that noise is
36:23 - nobody hears the other room okay but i'm
36:26 - just gonna be right back
36:39 - okay i have discovered what it is for
36:42 - all those of you who are interested
36:43 - it's just uh it actually seems to have
36:45 - gone away but it's uh
36:47 - joe the trainer has a uh athletic
36:49 - training studio that's right next door
36:51 - so pc i think the music and the noise
36:53 - was coming from there
36:54 - in between videos and i'll go and get
36:56 - myself like a workout or something
36:58 - okay here we go uh i should probably
37:01 - just meditate or something to
37:03 - reduce the level of kind of panicked
37:05 - uncertainty i have in my life okay
37:07 - there's a camera there's a camera
37:08 - i'm ready to go i'm gonna kind of
37:12 - close this a little bit and oh i wanted
37:14 - to just briefly erase this
37:22 - and
37:26 - i think this camera by the way is
37:28 - slightly because this is level
37:30 - the camera's slightly askew wonder if i
37:32 - could fix that
37:34 - i probably shouldn't worry about it
37:35 - right now of course ah well look what
37:37 - you guys are watching
37:38 - oh no how do i get out of this how do i
37:41 - get out of this
37:43 - there we go okay
37:46 - uh actually let me let me focus this
37:49 - really quick just make sure the focus is
37:52 - good
37:53 - um you guys this will entertain you
37:58 - uh so
38:01 - here i am
38:04 - uh actually that's pretty good
38:08 - but let me just get it this is like live
38:11 - stream focusing you can see it's out of
38:13 - focus
38:15 - i think that's good i think i got it
38:18 - okay
38:23 - okay i'm really gonna get started now
38:25 - sorry about that okay
38:27 - here we go and the audio is still
38:30 - working
38:31 - here we go
38:36 - hello in this video i'm going to look at
38:39 - create capture
38:40 - in p5.js and how the create capture
38:43 - function allows you to get a live image
38:45 - from your
38:46 - webcam so i want to talk briefly just
38:48 - about
38:49 - what the createcapture function does
38:50 - technically behind the scenes
38:52 - um before i start typing to the code and
38:55 - seeing the results so let's come with me
38:56 - over here
38:57 - look i'm over here now hello so um as
39:00 - you know
39:01 - a p5 i don't know if you know this but
39:03 - you've watched any other videos you do
39:05 - p5 has these functions setup and draw
39:07 - setup being the thing
39:08 - that runs at the beginning of a p5.js
39:11 - sketch
39:12 - and the thing that you typically have in
39:14 - a p5.js sketch
39:16 - is a function called createcanvas this
39:18 - is not necessarily required
39:20 - which gets a width and a height and what
39:22 - does that function do it places
39:24 - a canvas in the browser window itself
39:30 - so the goal for this video by the end of
39:32 - this video
39:33 - is to say you know your laptop
39:36 - which has a like a webcam at the top i
39:39 - want to see
39:40 - the image you know from that webcam
39:43 - i want to see that in the canvas so the
39:46 - way that you can connect
39:48 - to the default camera of your computer
39:51 - and anybody's computer happens to be
39:52 - loading your sketch in their browser
39:54 - is with the function create capture
39:58 - so the create capture function and then
40:00 - you pass it one
40:01 - argument video what the create capture
40:04 - function does
40:05 - is it creates a connection to like i
40:08 - think it's called in web language like
40:09 - user
40:10 - get media something like that but what
40:12 - what it does behind the scenes is it
40:14 - actually creates a separate dom
40:16 - element dom referring to document object
40:18 - model this being the document
40:20 - there being objects in the document the
40:22 - one thing we created is a canvas
40:24 - as you know in p5 you can also create
40:26 - things like a paragraph
40:28 - with create p you could create things
40:30 - like a slider
40:31 - with create slider you could create
40:34 - button with create button so you can
40:35 - make all these elements that live on the
40:37 - web page
40:38 - and create capture actually what it does
40:40 - is creates
40:41 - a video
40:44 - dom element which contains the image
40:48 - from that camera so on the one hand this
40:50 - might be what you want you want to have
40:52 - a canvas and a video element
40:54 - separate from each other but in a sort
40:57 - of classic creative coding sense
40:59 - whatever
40:59 - whatever that means you might just want
41:02 - to be doing some kind of animation or
41:03 - abstract visual art thingamabob
41:06 - based on what's in that video so you
41:07 - don't actually want to see that dom
41:08 - element
41:09 - you just want to paint it to the canvas
41:11 - and mess with it on the canvas
41:12 - so that's what i need to look at how to
41:14 - do with code
41:16 - um and and and we'll see in a second but
41:19 - i think it's important to point out
41:20 - that create capture is actually part of
41:23 - the p5
41:26 - dom library and actually creates a
41:28 - separate element on the page
41:30 - and so let's go look at that
41:33 - okay so here i am back over here and
41:36 - i've got a sketch i'm working just in
41:37 - sublime text today
41:39 - running a local server and looking at
41:41 - the results in the chrome browser if you
41:43 - don't know how to do that i
41:44 - made a separate video that i will link
41:45 - to that shows how to get that setup
41:47 - going but you can use
41:48 - any any web editor thing of your choice
41:51 - to do all of this
41:52 - so what i'm going to do is i'm going to
41:54 - say create capture
41:56 - and pass in the argument video so i'm
41:58 - adding that to my code
41:59 - i'm going to go over to the browser and
42:01 - i'm going to hit refresh
42:03 - and you can see now there it is the
42:05 - canvas is there
42:06 - and the capture is there now what is the
42:08 - resolution of this capture
42:10 - make it a little smaller you can see
42:12 - that this capture looks
42:13 - bigger than the canvas it's actually
42:15 - made my canvas 320x240
42:17 - the capture the video is 640x480 that
42:20 - only i guess happens to be
42:21 - whatever default resolution the browser
42:23 - the camera who knows making
42:25 - who's making that decision but that's
42:27 - what you're getting now if i wanted to
42:29 - change
42:30 - the size of this element it's a dom
42:32 - element so i can use
42:34 - for example the p5 function
42:37 - size ah but how do i do that so what if
42:39 - i want to now
42:40 - manipulate what if i want to manipulate
42:44 - sorry i lost my train of thought for a
42:46 - second what if i want to manipulate
42:48 - the the capture element itself i need to
42:51 - store a reference to it in a variable
42:54 - so what i'm going to do is add a
42:55 - variable to the top i'll call it video
42:58 - i will say video equals create capture i
43:00 - could have called it anything cam
43:02 - capture whatever
43:03 - and i can now also say video dot size
43:06 - 320 by 240. so now what i've done is
43:10 - i've created that connection it made
43:12 - that dom element and i've sized it down
43:15 - and you can see here and you can see now
43:18 - i have on my web page i have the canvas
43:20 - and the video hooray so now we can start
43:24 - to do some more things
43:26 - i said what if i want to ultimately not
43:29 - see this separate
43:31 - image but actually paint into the canvas
43:32 - so i can do other stuff on top of it
43:34 - well one of the nice things about
43:36 - working in p5
43:38 - is p5 has already set up the landscape
43:41 - of things for you
43:43 - so that this video dom element can act
43:46 - just like any other image would act in
43:49 - p5
43:50 - so for example in draw if i just say i
43:53 - didn't set up my settings correctly
43:55 - if i just say image my sublime settings
43:57 - i'll do that later video i like to have
43:58 - two spaces for the indent
44:00 - you know it's very important to me my
44:02 - life feels very out of control if my
44:04 - indentation isn't
44:05 - working correctly the way that i like it
44:07 - i'll take a deep breath
44:08 - move on okay so if i say image video dot
44:11 - zero zero
44:12 - um um and i do that and now i hit
44:16 - refresh we can see there it is so i've
44:19 - got
44:20 - now i've got the actual video dom
44:22 - element and i have the canvas where i'm
44:23 - drawing the video onto the canvas but
44:26 - you can see i can do things like now
44:27 - with the canvas i can
44:29 - add other functions like tint you know i
44:32 - could make
44:33 - it very uh let's see what happens if i
44:35 - get kind of pinkish
44:37 - we can see here oh you know what
44:39 - interesting ah so a little bug happened
44:42 - i'm gonna fix this bug uh and it's
44:44 - actually there's already a github issue
44:45 - file so
44:46 - by the time you run this with your p5 in
44:48 - the future this won't happen to you
44:50 - i'm gonna just fix it by um by enforcing
44:54 - the size here but what happened is
44:57 - uh when i added tint the pixels got
45:00 - manipulated
45:02 - and suddenly it went back to 640 by 480
45:04 - even though it shouldn't that shouldn't
45:05 - have happened so this video is gonna
45:06 - have a historical error in it which will
45:08 - get fixed
45:09 - but i in my code i was able to fix it by
45:12 - just
45:12 - enforcing the size that i'm drawing the
45:14 - image so you can see
45:15 - that in the canvas i can do various
45:17 - things to manipulate
45:19 - the image itself and while i was
45:20 - altering the size i might as well see i
45:22 - could do something like ah let me make
45:24 - mouse
45:24 - x the width and now you can see i have
45:27 - this video that i can kind of like
45:28 - shrink and make myself kind of like
45:30 - skinny
45:31 - or wider or a little bit skinnier and
45:33 - you can see i'm not drawing the
45:34 - background so i'm getting these weird
45:36 - trails
45:36 - so anything that you can do with images
45:39 - shapes i could add translate i could add
45:40 - rotate i could spin it i could shrink it
45:42 - i can
45:42 - flip it all of those types of things i
45:45 - can do with the video
45:46 - and if i it's nice to have this dom
45:48 - element as a reference of what the
45:50 - original video looks like
45:52 - but if i didn't want to have that one
45:54 - thing i'll show you is i could add
45:55 - video.hide so the hide function hides a
45:58 - particular dom element
46:01 - and if i hit refresh you can now see
46:03 - that the only thing
46:04 - is the canvas and the video so that
46:07 - concludes
46:08 - what i originally set out as the goal
46:11 - which was to be able to
46:12 - capture video from the camera
46:16 - and draw into the canvas however i must
46:19 - alert you to something that will trip
46:22 - you up
46:22 - i should probably should have led with
46:24 - this and not finished with it
46:26 - notice how it didn't ask me for
46:28 - permission
46:30 - it didn't say like oh can i have access
46:31 - to your camera is that okay
46:33 - what you are doing if you took this
46:35 - sketch and uploaded it to your website
46:38 - potentially if somebody came to your
46:40 - website
46:41 - it could automatically turn on their
46:42 - camera you could take pictures of them
46:44 - and save that to your server
46:46 - so typically speaking what you're the
46:47 - user is going to see is like oh
46:49 - can i have access to the camera but some
46:51 - browsers in particular the chrome
46:53 - browser will only actually let you do
46:55 - this
46:56 - if you are serving your website from
46:59 - what's known as https
47:02 - the s being secure so
47:06 - if you ever go to the address bar in
47:09 - your browser it'll sometimes say
47:10 - http and it'll sometimes say https
47:14 - if you're like on your bank's website
47:16 - it's i hope it says
47:17 - https because you need a level of
47:19 - encryption and security there
47:21 - so depending on where you're uploading
47:23 - your thing
47:24 - if you're just working locally on your
47:26 - own computer and making whatever and
47:27 - experimenting it's always going to work
47:29 - but if you're uploading it to your own
47:30 - website you need to have
47:32 - https enabled some web servers might
47:35 - have this as a feature for you like
47:37 - heroku i believe if you're using that
47:38 - that's a
47:39 - web service thing company others won't
47:42 - um and so you need to like purchase and
47:44 - get a certificate and maybe i can
47:46 - make a video about that if i even knew
47:48 - how to do that but one thing i'll point
47:49 - out that someone pointed to me recently
47:51 - is there is something called let's
47:53 - encrypt let's encrypt is free automated
47:56 - and open it's a new certificate
47:57 - authority so that might be something you
47:58 - could look into if you need to
48:00 - resolve this issue in terms of where
48:02 - you're uploading i do know for example
48:03 - though that github pages i believe
48:05 - if you're using github pages as a way of
48:07 - hosting something that i believe you can
48:09 - use https with
48:10 - anyway but also you could just not use
48:12 - chrome and it might work in a different
48:13 - browser
48:14 - yada yada yada this will all be
48:16 - irrelevant and i'm gonna have to dub the
48:17 - robots of the future will dub over me
48:20 - and explain this correctly because this
48:22 - is all gonna become totally
48:23 - not relevant anymore probably a week
48:25 - from now two weeks from now two months
48:26 - from now
48:27 - et cetera okay thanks for watching this
48:29 - video in the next video
48:30 - you know so i would say if you're
48:31 - looking for something to do try to get
48:32 - this to work mess around manipulate the
48:34 - video
48:34 - in the next video i'm going to show you
48:35 - how to save snapshots over time
48:38 - from a live source
48:42 - okay how was that everybody i'm going to
48:44 - look at the chat for a second
48:46 - uh
48:50 - somebody asks um does create capture
48:53 - work on mobile devices i i think it does
48:56 - on android
48:57 - but i do not think it does on ios so i
49:00 - think createcapture will work on android
49:02 - in the browser
49:03 - um again uh you know the https thing is
49:06 - an issue if
49:07 - because i think the android browser is
49:08 - like chrome based but
49:10 - pretty sure it does not work in ios and
49:12 - you probably probably would need some
49:13 - extra
49:14 - set of hooks to get the camera on ios
49:17 - um okay um
49:21 - yeah i interestingly enough someone
49:23 - makes the comment this is this is
49:24 - certainly one of the uh scenarios
49:27 - where uh doing this in p5 is actually
49:29 - quite a bit simpler than in the
49:30 - processing desktop environment the one
49:32 - thing you'll run into
49:33 - is as i show you the pixel processing
49:35 - stuff it's a lot
49:36 - slower in javascript than in processing
49:38 - so uh
49:39 - image processing iterating over all the
49:41 - pixels of an image is a very expensive
49:44 - thing to do computationally expensive
49:45 - thing to do and it runs pretty slow in
49:47 - javascript so you got to really work
49:48 - with low resolution images
49:50 - uh okay
49:53 - and let's see if anyone's asking
49:55 - anything on twitch
49:58 - um nope uh
50:01 - okay um all right so i'm gonna go
50:05 - on to my next topic i'm gonna take a
50:08 - break for a second and drink a little
50:09 - this
50:10 - coffee that i have over here i should i
50:11 - shouldn't be allowed to drink coffee
50:13 - it's been established but i'm going to
50:14 - anyway
50:18 - i think you could probably hear my like
50:20 - slurping and swallowing laura
50:24 - it's by the way it's a little bit
50:25 - strange just be in a room talking to
50:27 - yourself even though i know there are
50:28 - people watching and i'm making video
50:29 - tutorials and people seem to like them
50:31 - although i'm always unsure about that
50:33 - it's weird okay um
50:37 - so the next thing i'm gonna do is let me
50:40 - close this
50:42 - let me save let me make a new
50:45 - copy of this and i'm going to call it
50:50 - uh 02 photo booth
50:54 - so the next thing uh for those of you
50:56 - who might just be tuning in
50:58 - this is my list of stuff to do i did
51:00 - basic create capture
51:02 - the next thing i'm gonna do is show how
51:03 - to make i know photo booth i don't know
51:05 - if that's the right
51:06 - term because i'm not going to make a
51:07 - whole photo booth here but i'm going to
51:08 - look at
51:09 - how you can add an html5 button and
51:12 - every time you press the button
51:13 - you save a snapshot from the video
51:17 - and maybe you save a whole bunch of them
51:18 - in an array that sort of thing
51:20 - um so and that will actually lead to
51:23 - this
51:24 - huh muybridge style thing maybe i'll
51:27 - move that up
51:28 - but we'll see um
51:33 - yeah i wonder if i might add that into
51:35 - this video if i'm feeling ambitious
51:38 - so let me close this sketch
51:41 - go over here and
51:43 - [Music]
51:45 - oh you know what i'm going to do the
51:46 - other thing i'm going to do everyone
51:50 - is i'm gonna let me just mention this i
51:52 - made a whole video about this the other
51:53 - day
51:54 - um uh p5
51:57 - uh so i'm gonna fix something in the p5
52:00 - library
52:02 - secretly behind the scenes uh
52:07 - but this will get fixed eventually in
52:08 - the actual p5 library this was a github
52:10 - issue i filed and made a whole video
52:12 - about
52:13 - and it needs to be this in line
52:16 - 1679. of
52:20 - p5 dom so if i go in here and i go all
52:24 - the way down
52:26 - i'm just going to fix something i think
52:28 - it's here
52:30 - oops uh and the other thing i said i
52:33 - wanted to do
52:35 - is in the preferences ah so how does
52:37 - anybody know
52:39 - in sublime how i set it to um
52:45 - let's look at this for a second uh
52:46 - indentation
52:48 - uh uh oh
52:51 - translate tabs to spaces true
52:55 - and tab size two because that's i want
52:58 - spaces
52:59 - is there another four anywhere uh
53:04 - margin for no i think that must have
53:06 - done it
53:08 - so now if i do this
53:11 - ah yes yes okay my indentation is now
53:15 - okay
53:16 - and i'm going to do this
53:20 - and start from
53:23 - [Music]
53:26 - this there we go uh this can be maybe a
53:30 - little bit smaller over here
53:31 - because i'm gonna need this to be a
53:32 - little bit wider okay i think i'm ready
53:34 - for the next video i'm gonna check the
53:36 - chat
53:40 - um
53:42 - uh yes someone says i would appreciate a
53:44 - small tutorial about git
53:45 - oh be careful what you wish for i plan
53:48 - on making a very large tutorial about
53:50 - git
53:50 - um i'm hoping to do that next week
53:52 - actually uh i want to get one more
53:54 - couple more lights in here just to make
53:55 - the setup a little bit better because i
53:57 - feel like
53:58 - this is uh the get tutorials are kind of
53:59 - important it's not that i'm none of
54:01 - these
54:01 - important but i want to have them i want
54:04 - them to sort of last for a while and
54:05 - kind of look good and be good so
54:07 - um i'm going to do those next week i
54:09 - think once i get a little bit better at
54:11 - this
54:11 - setup in here let me just check here
54:15 - um
54:16 - [Music]
54:19 - okay so i'm going to
54:23 - erase this
54:26 - i'm going to do oh it's 11 o'clock i've
54:28 - got about another hour to see how much
54:29 - more i can get done in the next hour
54:31 - those of you who are staying with me are
54:33 - very kind
54:35 - keeps me motivated to see stuff in the
54:37 - chat and let me just
54:39 - cycle the cameras
54:43 - a little ritual thing that i do
54:50 - and
54:52 - here we go
54:58 - oh i also and the one thing i need to do
55:00 - is name that video i just made
55:02 - so that one i'm going to call uh oh one
55:08 - create capture
55:12 - okay and now
55:15 - here we go i need a tissue that's one
55:17 - thing i need is kleenex in this room i
55:19 - don't have
55:21 - okay here we go
55:26 - sorry i'm thinking do i have my um
55:29 - where'd i put my whiteboard marker
55:31 - oh here it is over here i need to have
55:32 - that in my hand okay
55:36 - hello in this video i'm going to look at
55:38 - how if you have a live capture
55:41 - live capture oh live capture
55:44 - if you have a live capture coming in
55:46 - from a camera
55:48 - that was uh no one wants to see me do
55:50 - that too much okay let's start over
55:53 - hello in this video i'm going to look at
55:55 - how if you have a live capture
55:58 - coming in from a camera into a web page
56:01 - how you can add a button to that page
56:03 - and save snapshots over time
56:05 - a photo booth like kind of sketch and
56:07 - i'm using p5.js
56:08 - so this is where i'm starting i have a
56:10 - simple uh p5 example which has a canvas
56:13 - which is here
56:14 - it has a video dom element over here the
56:16 - dom element is grabbing the image from
56:18 - the camera and then i'm drawing it into
56:19 - the canvas
56:20 - so let's go over to the code and i've
56:23 - got the code here you can see that
56:24 - create capture video change the size of
56:27 - 320 by 240 and draw that onto the canvas
56:29 - so first thing i want to do is just
56:31 - stop drawing it onto the canvas and we
56:34 - can see
56:34 - this is what i've got now and i want to
56:36 - add a button to the page
56:38 - so i'm going to say create button
56:42 - snap and if i refresh it you can see
56:46 - there's that button
56:47 - we make this a little bit bigger and you
56:49 - can see there's that button snap
56:51 - so the idea here is that i want is
56:52 - whenever i
56:54 - hit the button i want that image to be
56:56 - saved and populated into the canvas
56:58 - so how do we do that so the first thing
57:00 - i need to do is bind some sort of event
57:02 - to the pressing of this button and the
57:04 - way that that's done in p5
57:07 - is with well first of all once again if
57:09 - i want to do anything with that button i
57:12 - now need a variable to keep track of
57:13 - that button over time
57:15 - so i'm going to add a variable called
57:16 - button at the top and i'm going to say
57:18 - button equals create button
57:19 - and then i will say button dot mouse
57:22 - pressed
57:23 - and i'll call this uh take snap
57:27 - so what goes in here is the name of a
57:31 - function that i want to execute when i
57:33 - press the mouse
57:34 - on that button and this is p5 specific
57:36 - there are lots of ways in javascript
57:37 - with
57:38 - other frameworks and native javascript
57:39 - and jquery to do this same sort of thing
57:41 - but in p5 has a nice simple hook for
57:43 - binding an event to the press of the
57:45 - mouse
57:45 - which is naming a function that goes
57:47 - into the mouse press function that's
57:48 - that's
57:49 - called on the button object itself so
57:51 - once i've done that it's now my job
57:53 - to write a function called take snap
57:57 - and in that function what could i do i
57:59 - could take exactly this line of code
58:01 - that just draws what is currently in the
58:04 - video to the canvas
58:05 - so if i save this and i go back and run
58:08 - this again
58:09 - we should see now that the video is
58:11 - playing
58:12 - video is capturing there's nothing in
58:14 - the canvas but
58:17 - you can see that as soon as i hit that
58:19 - button i get
58:21 - the current image into the canvas and
58:23 - now
58:24 - i can do this and you can see i can kind
58:26 - of create a little like stop-motion
58:29 - dance animation so we can make a gif out
58:31 - of this if they want i don't know what
58:32 - i'm doing anymore i
58:33 - got lost in my own little world there
58:35 - for a second we turn off the video and
58:36 - just dance the night away even though
58:38 - it's 11 o'clock in the morning which is
58:40 - not really the morning
58:41 - i digress um so let's try to make this
58:44 - though a little bit more interesting
58:46 - here
58:46 - which is that i didn't really save
58:49 - anything i don't know what it means to
58:50 - save anything
58:51 - certainly i could like download the
58:52 - image to the computer ah we could add
58:54 - that actually that could be a feature we
58:55 - could add
58:56 - um but what i think might be interesting
58:58 - to look at is
58:59 - how might i save those images over time
59:02 - so
59:03 - since i have this white board over here
59:04 - i feel obligated to use it let's think
59:06 - about this for a second
59:07 - i need to sort of map this out for
59:09 - myself so
59:10 - we have the canvas
59:15 - we have the video
59:19 - and the only thing that i'm doing is at
59:20 - particular moments in time
59:22 - i'm drawing you know the image
59:26 - from the video to the canvas but
59:29 - what if i could do something in the
59:31 - interim over here and the thing that i
59:32 - want to do
59:33 - is actually call the function get
59:39 - so get is a function that uh maybe i'll
59:42 - get to a little more later which is a
59:45 - way of like
59:46 - grabbing pixels from the image itself
59:49 - but if i call get with no arguments what
59:51 - it does is it grabs
59:52 - an entire copy of that image so what if
59:55 - i had
59:56 - a uh an array
59:59 - i called it history so a blank array
60:02 - like this
60:03 - and every time i press
60:06 - a button i add
60:09 - a copy of the image to that array so i'm
60:12 - actually storing
60:14 - image after image after image whenever
60:15 - that button is pressed
60:17 - that way i could potentially in my
60:19 - canvas
60:21 - i could see a whole bunch of images
60:24 - snapshots over time so let's take a look
60:27 - at how we might do that
60:30 - okay uh so let's go back to the code
60:32 - what are some things i want to add the
60:34 - first thing i want to add and audio is
60:35 - still working is a variable called
60:37 - history
60:38 - which will just be an array so an empty
60:40 - array
60:41 - and now i said instead of um
60:44 - instead of right here just drawing the
60:48 - image
60:50 - drawing the image to the screen when the
60:52 - button is pressed
60:53 - what i want to do instead is say
60:55 - something like this
60:56 - history.push video
61:00 - push being a function history is an
61:02 - array video is the video dom
61:04 - element push being a function that adds
61:06 - something to that array
61:08 - so i want to add the video dom element
61:10 - add the video dom element every time i
61:11 - press the button only
61:13 - that's not what i want to do so this
61:14 - looks kind of right like oh every time i
61:16 - press the button
61:16 - add you know the image from the video to
61:18 - the array but this the variable video
61:20 - is not the image it's the entirety of
61:22 - that dom element
61:24 - live capture stream thing itself so
61:26 - that's not what i want in the array
61:27 - what i want is just a copy of that image
61:30 - so i need to use that get function
61:32 - so if i come back over here and i say
61:35 - video dot get
61:36 - this is what i want so and you know i
61:39 - can run this right now
61:41 - oh history.push is not a function
61:44 - why is that not a function yes it is
61:50 - uh
61:52 - is is history some other um variable
61:56 - name for something let's call this uh
61:57 - snapshots
61:59 - is is something else called history in
62:01 - the world of javascript
62:03 - yeah that's strange somebody will tell
62:05 - me what that was so sometimes if you get
62:07 - that
62:07 - error you know this is by the way i made
62:09 - a video about name spacing
62:11 - i'll link to it now but something you
62:13 - can walk into by accident which
62:14 - apparently i just did
62:15 - in javascript especially working with p5
62:18 - is i'm making up all these like global
62:19 - variables and there's a lot of default
62:21 - stuff
62:21 - yeah history browser history i'm sure
62:24 - there's a global variable that just
62:26 - exists in web browsers
62:27 - called history that has to do with the
62:28 - browser history and i just messed up
62:30 - by overriding that so watch out danger
62:32 - danger don't do that so i'll call it
62:34 - snapshots
62:36 - and what i want to do now is we can look
62:40 - at here
62:40 - snapshots is an empty array so this is
62:44 - the chrome developer console i recently
62:46 - made a video about how to use that
62:48 - and now if i hit snap a couple times
62:51 - and look at snapshots again you can see
62:54 - that now it has an array with a bunch of
62:55 - p5 images in it
62:57 - and there's more stuff with these p5
62:59 - images that we can kind of look into
63:01 - the width and the height and all of that
63:03 - but let's not worry about that right now
63:05 - now how can i do something with these
63:07 - images
63:09 - well one thing i could do let's um let's
63:11 - do one thing with it let's make the
63:13 - canvas
63:14 - uh wider and in draw
63:18 - let's add a loop that says
63:22 - four var i equals zero i is less than
63:24 - snapshots
63:25 - dot length i plus plus
63:28 - let's draw image snapshots
63:34 - index i let's draw
63:37 - all of those images so this is going to
63:39 - i don't know what this is really going
63:40 - to accomplish but let's run this
63:42 - and you can see now it's only showing
63:45 - the last one why is it
63:46 - i did a loop to draw every single one
63:48 - it's only showing the last one
63:50 - well it's drawing them all but it's
63:53 - drawing them all on top of each other
63:55 - so one thing i could do that would be
63:56 - kind of interesting i have no idea if
63:57 - this is going to work
63:59 - is i could add some alpha
64:05 - so look at that now you can see that
64:07 - it's drawing them all and i'm getting a
64:08 - nice little ghost averaging thing
64:10 - i gotta um because i'm tinting them as
64:13 - i'm drawing them let's draw them next to
64:15 - each other
64:15 - so one thing i might want to do is draw
64:17 - them a lot smaller like maybe i'll just
64:19 - draw them at 80 by 60
64:21 - and maybe i'll actually make that a
64:22 - variable
64:25 - uh 80 and 60
64:28 - and use those variables and i'll say
64:32 - let me have an x and a y
64:37 - so what i'm doing here is i want to draw
64:39 - each image
64:40 - at a particular x and a y as i'm looping
64:42 - through the array the first one is 0
64:44 - 0 the second one at x equals x
64:47 - plus w
64:50 - so now what you would see is
64:55 - you can see here that each one is
64:57 - drawing next to each other now when it
64:58 - gets to the edge of the window
65:00 - which is over here maybe what i wanted
65:03 - to do
65:03 - if x is greater than w
65:06 - then i want to reset x back to zero and
65:08 - have y go up by
65:10 - h so i'm just making a little algorithm
65:12 - inside this loop that no matter how many
65:14 - images there
65:14 - are they're each being drawn x is moving
65:17 - over when x gets the end
65:18 - x goes back to zero and y goes down so
65:21 - now i can run this
65:22 - and we should see here's the video down
65:24 - here and i can
65:27 - oh what happened there if x is greater
65:30 - than w that's not correct
65:32 - if x is greater than the width of the
65:34 - canvas not w which is just one
65:36 - over so that's no good so let's run this
65:39 - again and then i'm gonna
65:42 - you can see my little uh kind of stop
65:45 - motion
65:45 - muay bridge sequence now incidentally
65:47 - it's kind of funny that i'm doing this
65:48 - by like pressing the button
65:50 - because i could just as easily do this
65:52 - so so anyway so you get the idea here
65:53 - there's a lot of possibilities i have
65:55 - this whole array i can mix and match
65:56 - them i could create a puzzle
65:57 - i could chop it up i mean my mind is
65:59 - bursting with ideas and i hope yours is
66:01 - as well
66:02 - but and you can see also like that the i
66:04 - don't know if you can see this in this
66:05 - recording in the video but the program
66:06 - is running a bit slower now i have this
66:08 - big array of images
66:09 - but um uh but i wanted to do
66:13 - one more thing which what i want to do
66:17 - let's this is a little bit insane
66:21 - you should just stop watching this now
66:22 - but i want to see if i can make these
66:25 - be in motion so i want to see just sort
66:28 - of like the last however many images
66:30 - and i want them all to be on a delay and
66:32 - moving let's just see
66:33 - if we can do this i'm 10 minutes into
66:36 - this video you can think of this as
66:37 - completing the lesson but let's just see
66:39 - if we can make this happen
66:40 - so let's think about this for a second
66:42 - um
66:44 - what i might want to do is
66:47 - uh first what happens if i just put this
66:50 - in draw itself
66:54 - uh okay so i'm saying push video
66:57 - dot get and uh let's
67:01 - and let's let's let's run this for a
67:02 - second and count it
67:04 - and i'm going to run this for a second
67:06 - but we complained
67:07 - so one thing that happened is that the
67:10 - video a draw happens immediately
67:12 - but the video wasn't actually ready just
67:14 - yet so i need oh
67:16 - sad sad world we live in what i need is
67:19 - an event i wonder if i can add an event
67:21 - here
67:22 - called ready
67:27 - and i make a variable called go equals
67:29 - false
67:30 - and now i'm going to set go so i think
67:33 - there should be a callback to create i
67:34 - don't know if this exists in p5 we're
67:36 - about to find out
67:37 - there should be most of these functions
67:38 - in javascript have a callback like
67:40 - create the capture and you know but it's
67:43 - not what i need to know when you're done
67:44 - creating it so i could use it
67:46 - and so i passed a call back called ready
67:48 - and i'm just going to set a boolean
67:50 - variable equal to true
67:51 - so i can say only if go
67:56 - then start capturing those snapshots and
67:59 - i can take this out here
68:00 - as i've gotten rid of the button and i'm
68:03 - gonna have to
68:04 - we don't need this button anymore
68:07 - yeah that worked so you can see what's
68:09 - happening here so now let me pause this
68:11 - uh let me say no loop so i need to do
68:14 - something ridiculous which is
68:16 - count this one two three four five six
68:19 - seven eight nine ten times four there
68:21 - are forty
68:23 - so i need an array with 40. so i only
68:25 - want to what i want to do
68:27 - is actually i want to change and have a
68:30 - counter
68:31 - so i want to create a counter because i
68:34 - don't want to i only want to have 40
68:36 - images at a time so what i would want to
68:38 - do is add a counter
68:40 - so instead of just always adding an
68:41 - image to the array what i want to say is
68:44 - snapshots index counter equals video.get
68:48 - so this is going to do the same exact
68:50 - thing
68:51 - i'm going to be i'm going to add images
68:54 - to that array
68:55 - i'm going to run this again
68:58 - counter equals zero why didn't that work
69:00 - somebody
69:02 - let's see what this error is sketch.4 i
69:05 - have a syntax error
69:07 - oh int boy my land isn't my mind is in
69:10 - java land var should be the name of the
69:12 - variable so i'm going to do this
69:15 - and we can see ah so it's working but i
69:17 - didn't increase the counter
69:19 - so i need to say counter plus plus
69:23 - and now you can see this is working now
69:25 - what i could do is say aha
69:27 - when counter gets to 40 go back to zero
69:30 - so now i can say if counter equals
69:34 - 40 because there's only 40 total counter
69:36 - should go back to zero
69:40 - okay so now this is a good time to do
69:43 - jumping jacks
69:45 - i have to do them over here right you
69:47 - can see my
69:49 - trail of jumping jacks is happening up
69:51 - here you know there are maybe like a
69:52 - second space depart
69:54 - you can see it's still doing it do i
69:56 - still have that tint in there
69:58 - that's funny i still have the tint let's
70:00 - get rid of that
70:01 - and refresh i forgot that i had that the
70:02 - whole time no wonder this is what i
70:04 - expected it to look like
70:05 - i'll do some jumping jacks so you can
70:08 - see now
70:08 - i don't i don't know why the bottom
70:10 - maybe i did my math wrong
70:12 - maybe they're 43 did i get the math
70:15 - wrong there
70:16 - uh counter equals 43 let's try that
70:20 - uh you know i obviously could do some
70:22 - actual correct math there we go so now
70:24 - you can see i've got this like
70:25 - history of the last 43 images always
70:28 - continuously there
70:30 - but i want to do something a little bit
70:32 - weird so this is pretty good and
70:34 - i think you could probably make some
70:35 - creative experiments with this and make
70:37 - it bigger or smaller or whatever
70:39 - but and i'm just like off the deep end
70:40 - here but only at 15 minutes so this is
70:42 - fine
70:42 - so let's think about how to make this
70:45 - notice that i'm always just drawing the
70:46 - images
70:48 - 0 through 243
70:51 - and let's make that i don't know why
70:53 - that's the val let's make this
70:55 - total equal 40. let's make that a
70:56 - variable i swear i don't understand my
70:58 - math here but
70:59 - i'm just going to go with it so one
71:02 - thing i want to do
71:04 - is that in addition to
71:08 - drawing the images i want to offset them
71:11 - this is going to like seem weird but let
71:13 - me
71:13 - let me just do this and maybe it's going
71:14 - to make sense it's making sense in my
71:16 - head right now because i think i've done
71:17 - this before many years ago
71:19 - but i'm going to what if i said i plus
71:22 - frame count
71:22 - so in other words i want the zero image
71:24 - to be here then the zero image to be
71:26 - there then the zero image to be there
71:28 - every frame but as soon as we get past
71:30 - 43
71:31 - i need to use the modulus operation
71:34 - boy modulus might not be familiar to
71:37 - some of you i believe i made a video
71:39 - only about
71:40 - modulus at one point and so let's make
71:43 - this a separate variable
71:44 - just so we can kind of discuss what's
71:46 - going on here pretty sure this is going
71:48 - to work
71:51 - so let me run this see if this does what
71:54 - i expect
71:54 - oop uh i have an error
71:58 - oh so i must have got oh so first of all
72:01 - i can only do this once counter has got
72:05 - i need i need 40 images first to start
72:07 - with
72:09 - so uh so this is only going to work once
72:12 - 43 or whatever once i have the total
72:14 - amount
72:15 - so this one um so i want to think of
72:18 - like a really simple way to approach
72:20 - this
72:20 - um i'm just going to say if
72:25 - if oh you know what i don't never mind i
72:28 - this is silly all i need to do is say
72:31 - snapshots.length
72:33 - because i can just do this based on how
72:36 - many
72:36 - elements are currently in the array
72:41 - so now you can see that ah that's what i
72:43 - was hoping for
72:44 - okay so you can see that everything's
72:46 - moving now
72:48 - why did this work i mean i um so this is
72:51 - uh this is a pretty standard kind of
72:53 - like trope
72:54 - i would say in kind of creative coding
72:57 - uh looking at this video and seeing
72:58 - like many many copies of it on a slight
73:00 - delay we can make that delay big or
73:01 - smaller we could
73:02 - kind of cycle it around i made a project
73:04 - like 10 years ago that does exactly this
73:05 - i think i called it time frame
73:07 - um and i i just have to do like my
73:11 - some weird like vogue dancing i think to
73:13 - see what this looks like
73:16 - this video is still recording okay um
73:19 - um but let's try to think about why this
73:21 - is working for a second and
73:22 - again you know i don't know if anyone's
73:24 - still watching this video like 20
73:25 - minutes in
73:26 - but i hope that you make some creative
73:28 - projects with this
73:29 - um you might run into an issue by the
73:31 - way if you don't have that p5.js bug
73:32 - fixed but i
73:33 - can help you with that but let's think
73:35 - about this so
73:37 - remember this is the array and let's
73:39 - just
73:40 - uh pretend the array has one two
73:43 - three four five things in it and
73:47 - uh you know the animation looks
73:49 - something like this
73:52 - i was supposed to be me with one arm so
73:54 - you can see like the
73:55 - of an animation of a dial going like
73:57 - this so this is the canvas
74:01 - and this is continuously also shifting
74:04 - and getting new elements in it
74:05 - but what's happening is
74:08 - so the current the actual current frame
74:12 - is
74:12 - is going in one at a time so without
74:15 - that
74:16 - strange modulus i don't really try to
74:19 - make this make sense
74:21 - i don't know that this is the best
74:22 - drawing but without that modulus what i
74:24 - was seeing here is just
74:25 - literally the array copied into the
74:27 - window so we see these static images
74:29 - that are getting updated every once in a
74:31 - while
74:32 - but if what i'm doing is actually the
74:34 - zero element of the array gets drawn
74:36 - here
74:36 - then it gets drawn here then it gets
74:38 - drawn here then it gets drawn here
74:39 - you're actually seeing and the
74:40 - one element is also moving you're
74:42 - actually seeing that animation that's in
74:44 - the array play out
74:45 - because each spot on the screen that's
74:47 - static is seeing different elements from
74:49 - the array
74:50 - but the array is also being updated by
74:52 - the current elements from the camera
74:53 - and so how is that working basically uh
74:56 - what i want
74:58 - this is gonna i now i know how to make
74:59 - sense of this
75:01 - right i'm gonna put the index values
75:03 - here so first the index values go like
75:06 - this
75:06 - then the next time the index values go
75:09 - like this
75:11 - and then the next time
75:14 - oops i only have four here i messed up
75:18 - but you get the idea they go like this
75:21 - so then the next time
75:22 - it's three four zero one one two so
75:25 - those are cycling so how do you do that
75:28 - if you always have if you have that loop
75:30 - this is uh i
75:32 - so okay sorry this is i zero one
75:35 - two three this is i plus
75:39 - frame count which would be zero one
75:43 - two three and then one two three four
75:46 - then two three four five
75:49 - then three four five six right
75:52 - so this is i plus frame count the
75:55 - modulus operation
75:56 - if i was saying this
76:00 - i'm using my hand terrible i didn't go
76:02 - wash my hands in a second
76:04 - if i am saying now i
76:07 - plus frame count modulus
76:11 - 4 the modulus operation is like division
76:14 - but not like division it's the remainder
76:16 - of division
76:17 - so if i say for example three modulus
76:21 - four
76:22 - three modulus four is the three divided
76:25 - by four
76:26 - is zero remainder one
76:29 - four divided by four is one remainder
76:32 - zero
76:34 - five divided by four oh sorry zero
76:37 - divided by three sorry three divided by
76:40 - four at is zero remainder three
76:43 - five modulus four is one remainder
76:49 - one six divided by four is one remainder
76:53 - two
76:53 - so what the modulus operation does is it
76:56 - cycles everything back between
76:58 - to keep everything within the original
77:00 - range of the array
77:02 - boy i gotta re this video was going so
77:04 - well until i went off and did this but
77:06 - hopefully you found this
77:06 - interesting i'm gonna publish the code
77:09 - with this as i upload this video
77:12 - and i hope that you guys will make some
77:13 - experiments with this particular idea
77:15 - and share them so i can see what you
77:17 - made
77:18 - okay uh i'm gonna hit stop now i gotta i
77:21 - gotta come back to that
77:22 - that you know someday i i should just do
77:25 - this again it'll make more sense but
77:27 - i did my best
77:30 - okay um
77:38 - ah so somebody's saying the first three
77:40 - rows had 11 images one was off the right
77:42 - side thank you very much
77:45 - um
77:49 - okay i see there's uh look i'm just
77:51 - looking at the comments here
77:54 - boy and i'm gonna look on twitch
77:59 - um
78:04 - and this is live it is
78:08 - um okay yeah so somebody's
78:11 - i think there's some new people finding
78:12 - this uh stream on twitch which was sort
78:14 - of
78:15 - maybe one or two people this is live but
78:17 - i'm tending not to look at the chat
78:19 - except for at particular moments because
78:21 - ultimately i'm gonna record these and
78:22 - upload them to youtube as
78:23 - standalone videos um okay so
78:27 - um let me look back here this was my
78:31 - so i actually ended up doing this in
78:34 - this particular video
78:38 - i kind of want to like do that over
78:40 - again and like separate that out and not
78:42 - go
78:43 - so far off into this wilderness here
78:45 - because i
78:46 - but can you guys give me a little
78:48 - feedback was that kind of a total
78:49 - disaster or it kind of made sense
78:51 - trying to explain how the array thing
78:52 - worked i don't know
78:54 - i definitely think if i did it again i
78:55 - have a better sense of how to make it
78:56 - make sense but
78:58 - um okay so the next thing i would start
79:00 - doing would be
79:01 - the pixel array stuff
79:06 - um
79:09 - uh oh yeah so i guess i confirmed that
79:12 - it's live that i'm reading the chat
79:13 - responding to it
79:15 - uh although there is a delay so i think
79:17 - you're probably seeing this about 20
79:18 - seconds after i'm actually doing it so
79:19 - sometimes the chat is a little bit
79:21 - behind oh i need to
79:22 - plug this computer in
79:29 - and
79:34 - can you apply the chroma key so someone
79:36 - asked can you apply the chroma key in
79:38 - real time so i'm actually
79:39 - as you can see i'm recording this you
79:42 - can see that i'm recording this video
79:44 - from a camera over there
79:45 - this is the camera that's actually
79:47 - recording that's chroma keying the back
79:50 - the desktop of my laptop with me but
79:53 - because i'm using the webcam for my
79:55 - laptop you're also seeing another view
79:56 - which is this one
79:57 - now i think the question asks could you
79:59 - use p5 to live chroma key the video and
80:02 - the answer is absolutely
80:03 - yes and this is actually part of the
80:05 - next topic i want to explore which is
80:07 - how to manipulate the pixels
80:10 - and um so you could do it manually by
80:13 - manipulating the pixels and if the pixel
80:15 - is green
80:15 - you know draw a different pixel but
80:17 - there is a javascript library that
80:19 - allows you to do this
80:20 - called seriously.js
80:25 - and you can see that um
80:31 - so you can see this is doing live chroma
80:33 - keying and various effects
80:36 - of a particular video and then uh you
80:39 - can see that's the
80:40 - green screen thing that it's crunching
80:42 - okay
80:44 - so um so you could look into using that
80:46 - and uh that would be a great
80:50 - why not add that seriously.js with p5
80:55 - let's see if we can make that a topic um
80:58 - okay what time is it 11 20.
81:03 - uh and
81:06 - um so um
81:09 - okay so somebody is asking and i'm gonna
81:11 - i'm gonna just take a minute to answer
81:13 - some of the questions of people arriving
81:14 - so someone's uh so two things one is
81:16 - saying could you show sublime text again
81:18 - so let me do that
81:19 - so first of all the code for all these
81:22 - videos
81:23 - sometimes takes me a little while what
81:25 - happens with these videos after i finish
81:27 - this later this afternoon
81:28 - or this evening i will upload them as
81:30 - standalone videos to my youtube channel
81:32 - and then in the description i usually
81:33 - put a link
81:34 - to the source code that goes with the
81:36 - video so you'll be able to find
81:37 - all this later if the source code is
81:39 - missing all you need to do is type in
81:41 - the video's comments it's missing it
81:42 - reminds me
81:43 - then i post it um and if you're looking
81:46 - for
81:46 - what that repo is uh a github.com
81:50 - shiffman video dash lesson dash
81:53 - materials
81:55 - so this is the url you can see it up
81:57 - here
81:58 - and under uh code p5.js
82:01 - you can see these are like code examples
82:04 - that have gone along with all these
82:05 - other videos that i've previously made
82:07 - now the other question has been asked on
82:10 - twitch
82:11 - i make i came in a little after you
82:12 - started could you briefly re touch what
82:14 - p5.js
82:16 - j is j oh my god could you talk about
82:19 - what p5.js is and what it accomplishes
82:22 - so um very briefly p5.js
82:25 - is a javascript library um you don't all
82:28 - the things that i'm showing you you
82:29 - could do without p5.js
82:31 - but p5.js has a lot of functionality
82:33 - built into it
82:34 - to make drawing to an html5 canvas a
82:37 - little bit easier
82:38 - to make connecting to live video streams
82:39 - a little easier to add buttons and
82:41 - interface elements a little bit easier
82:43 - easier might be the wrong word but
82:44 - um but it's just a javascript library
82:47 - for
82:48 - what i would call loosely creative
82:50 - coding
82:51 - for to be able to kind of sketch and
82:53 - play around and make
82:54 - kind of experiments in a web browser
82:58 - there's a lot more to it in the history
82:59 - of it and there's something called
83:00 - processing i encourage you to go to
83:02 - p5js.org to learn a little bit more okay
83:06 - um so the next topic i want to explore i
83:09 - have to
83:10 - i have to think about the order of this
83:15 - so i think what i want to do is do a
83:17 - video just about the pixel array
83:22 - and manipulating the pixels of an image
83:26 - of a p5.js sketch using the live video
83:31 - let me actually let's make an example
83:33 - before i do the tutorial just to get a
83:35 - sense that this is actually working so
83:36 - i'm gonna do a little prep
83:37 - now even though well i like i'm
83:41 - having this here it's kind of crazy i
83:44 - can do like this is kind of interesting
83:45 - to see
83:47 - okay i have to stop playing with this
83:48 - though i'm gonna close this sketch
83:51 - and uh i'm going to make a copy of it
83:56 - actually let me start with uh make a
83:58 - copy of it
84:00 - and whoops uh p5.js video
84:03 - call this 03 pixels
84:09 - so and then i want to close this
84:12 - 03 pixels let's get rid of all this
84:25 - and go down here
84:28 - okay so what i want to do sorry
84:31 - everybody
84:34 - what i what i want to do is just test
84:37 - to see that pixel stuff is working in p5
84:40 - so i'm going to call load pixels
84:43 - camera's going to go off in a second
84:45 - i'll fix it i'm going to call update
84:47 - pixels
84:53 - so right now what i'm doing is i'm
84:55 - making the example that i will then make
84:57 - a tutorial about
84:58 - just to like get my head in the game
84:59 - here and figure out make sure this stuff
85:01 - works
85:02 - uh so i'm gonna say x equals zero x is
85:05 - less than
85:06 - uh with x plus plus uh
85:09 - so i'm doing a nested loop
85:13 - to look at every single pixel and
85:17 - i'm going to say
85:20 - pixels index
85:23 - i equals
85:26 - so i'm doing something here
85:30 - bear with me for a second the pixels in
85:33 - p5
85:33 - and html5 canvas work differently
85:37 - than they do in processing so if you're
85:39 - coming from processing if you're not
85:40 - coming from anything
85:42 - you won't care that this is different
85:43 - because it'll all be new to you
85:48 - and let's see if this actually works
85:51 - oops i lost chrome
85:55 - oops that's the wrong thing that's
85:57 - terminal
85:58 - where's chrome did i close it no no
86:02 - localhost pixels
86:09 - error i is not defined yeah no kidding i
86:12 - is not defined
86:14 - uh x plus y times width
86:19 - okay did something wrong
86:24 - ah right of course
86:27 - and then times four see i'm forgetting
86:29 - this stuff because it works differently
86:31 - in p5
86:34 - there we go what ah another thing is
86:37 - pixel density
86:39 - one
86:42 - okay it'll give me that annoying warning
86:47 - um and i'm gonna now try this
86:54 - see how the frame rate is all right
86:56 - promising
86:57 - okay so this is the first thing that i
86:58 - want to explore which is just
87:01 - how to manipulate and play with the
87:03 - pixel array
87:04 - in p5 uh and then what i'll do is
87:07 - actually get the pixels from the i'll
87:09 - put the capture next to it and get the
87:10 - pixels from capture
87:12 - uh and do more with that sort of thing
87:15 - so let's see
87:16 - um
87:20 - uh oh somebody is telling me to check
87:22 - out william cheer
87:24 - or keir um okay and
87:27 - uh yeah
87:30 - uh yeah i like how you guys um
87:34 - see my errors before i see them it's
87:36 - very it's very fun
87:38 - okay so i'm gonna now
87:46 - in the chat let me know how the
87:47 - whiteboard is you can read it and see it
87:50 - it's not the best lighting but it's like
87:51 - legible and all that
87:56 - um okay
87:59 - so because i'm going to erase this now
88:07 - and so this video is going to
88:10 - just be about the pixel array
88:16 - in p5.js which is
88:19 - also about the pixel array in html5
88:23 - canvas and i'm going to start by
88:25 - diagramming out how it works
88:27 - and then i'm going to write some code
88:28 - for it and then
88:31 - i will transition out to the next video
88:34 - which looks at
88:35 - actually reading the pixels from the my
88:37 - the camera itself
88:39 - it's fine it's fine thank you everybody
88:43 - uh okay
88:47 - um here we go guacamole
88:52 - sayonara chicken
88:57 - i don't know what i'm just saying words
88:59 - now okay
89:02 - all right i'm gonna drink a little
89:04 - coffee
89:09 - i have to announce that because if i
89:12 - don't you guys are going to wonder why
89:13 - do i walk
89:14 - off camera and make weird slurping
89:16 - sounds because i feel like the mic must
89:17 - pick that up
89:19 - okay um here we go
89:24 - ah so let me just do something here
89:27 - background
89:29 - do one
89:34 - oops nope
89:39 - okay uh great
89:45 - okay
89:48 - here we go you know what i want to check
89:50 - actually is i want to just check
89:52 - oh low battery so this is not good
89:55 - i need to um
89:58 - this one has two bars so i think that
90:01 - one's fine
90:03 - i want to replace the batteries just so
90:05 - you guys know what i'm
90:06 - i'm going to replace the battery on this
90:08 - because i really would hate for the
90:09 - battery to die in the middle of making
90:11 - the video
90:12 - so i'm going to be
90:17 - i'm about to mute myself and get new
90:19 - batteries be right back
90:23 - actually i haven't muted myself yet i
90:25 - have to find the batteries
90:26 - i had them out in a specific spot
90:30 - i don't know what happened to them oh
90:31 - here they are thank goodness
90:35 - i'm about to take the batteries out i
90:38 - don't know if that's gonna
90:39 - i'm gonna hit mute and hopefully you
90:41 - won't suddenly get weird like
90:42 - noise but maybe turn your volume down
90:44 - for a second so your headphones don't
90:46 - pop if anything weird happens i'll be
90:47 - back in 30 seconds
91:04 - okay i am back i think i'm back and the
91:07 - batteries are replaced
91:10 - so we aren't in danger of
91:14 - running out of battery
91:19 - okay
91:24 - all i can think about now is all the
91:26 - weird gifts i'm going to make of myself
91:28 - later
91:28 - i have to admit like somebody made one
91:30 - for me and then i was like oh that's
91:31 - interesting i'm gonna go see if i can
91:32 - make one myself
91:34 - and now i want to pretend that other
91:35 - people are making them but really it's
91:36 - just me making them
91:37 - because i'm the most vain person
91:40 - broadcasting
91:41 - creative coding tutorials on youtube and
91:43 - twitch
91:46 - okay just checking make sure
91:48 - everything's okay the audio looks like
91:50 - it's still
91:50 - fine somebody tell me if it's not
91:54 - it does release a fire hose of static
91:56 - okay that's good to know thank you
91:58 - um i you know what i should do is i
91:59 - should mute my control panel oh the
92:01 - other thing i really need to do is i
92:02 - need to get a
92:03 - sound board in here because i would like
92:05 - to be able to have some music
92:06 - get some like sound audio from the
92:08 - computer you have some intro music i'm
92:10 - thinking about using i'm totally serious
92:12 - here
92:13 - so if anybody has any ideas if like a
92:15 - simple little mixing board i can get or
92:16 - something send me a tweet
92:18 - good way to do that with them using
92:19 - wirecast in particular
92:21 - um okay uh
92:25 - oh you can't hear me right now
92:28 - but i think that's from earlier all
92:31 - right uh
92:31 - you guys can hear me now right so say
92:34 - i'm clapping say
92:35 - i can hear you clapping somebody say i
92:37 - can hear you clapping
92:41 - and i'll wait yes exactly like reading
92:45 - rainbow but the coding rainbow
92:47 - i actually have a friend in la who is a
92:51 - music composer for television and film
92:53 - and uh this reminds me i need to send
92:55 - him an email to ask he was going to help
92:56 - make a song you can hear me clapping
92:58 - okay so i'm going to go
92:59 - and make this video and i'm going to
93:01 - minimize this i'm not looking at the
93:03 - chat now talk amongst yourselves
93:05 - i'm going to cycle these cameras and i'm
93:07 - going to make a video
93:09 - about how the pixel array works
93:12 - in p5 here we go here we go here we go
93:16 - here we go
93:20 - you know i don't know what to say at the
93:21 - beginning of these videos i always just
93:22 - say hello
93:23 - in this video i will but that's what i'm
93:25 - going to say at this one
93:27 - i'm not going to include that in this
93:28 - video okay
93:31 - oh you know what i forgot to do i like
93:32 - to name i need to name that one that i
93:34 - just made
93:35 - so the one that i just made was uh o2
93:39 - photo history
93:43 - okay so i named that now i can close
93:45 - this
93:46 - this one will be a pixel array
93:49 - in this video
93:54 - and this is why i need the theme music
93:57 - hello and welcome to another video
93:58 - tutorial
94:00 - [Music]
94:02 - right
94:06 - hello today right now this very moment
94:08 - i'm going to talk about the pixel array
94:10 - pixel array uh in p5.js which is really
94:14 - really i'm talking about the pixel array
94:15 - in html5 canvas meaning there is a
94:18 - canvas
94:18 - in a browser i am programming what's
94:20 - going to be on that canvas in javascript
94:22 - and i want to know how do i access
94:24 - each individual pixel of the canvas and
94:26 - how do i manipulate and change the color
94:28 - of each individual pixel
94:30 - for whatever purposes my mind can
94:32 - imagine and this will lead to
94:34 - um how to get live images from a camera
94:38 - load images from some api or from a file
94:40 - and manipulate the pixels of some
94:42 - other image from some other source so
94:44 - that i'll get to in the next video but
94:45 - right now i just want to look at
94:46 - how does the pixel array work so let's
94:48 - uh come over here to the whiteboard for
94:50 - a second and kind of discuss what's at
94:52 - play here
94:53 - so here is what i'm calling
94:57 - the canvas so
95:01 - canvas image whatever you want to think
95:02 - about it a pix an image
95:04 - on a computer is a rectangular thing
95:07 - which is
95:08 - essentially a grid of pixels so we can
95:11 - make a sort of simplified think of a
95:13 - simplified low resolution
95:16 - one two three four five six like see
95:18 - this has a width of six
95:20 - one two three four five and a height of
95:23 - five
95:23 - so i now have an image that's six by
95:26 - five
95:26 - meaning there are 30 pixels total
95:30 - or 6 times 5. i hope i did the math
95:33 - right
95:34 - okay so in order to access
95:37 - these but now p5 has functions called
95:40 - get and set
95:44 - and these functions are useful get or
95:46 - set you can pass an
95:47 - x and a y the numbers being starting
95:50 - with zero
95:51 - so the x values go from zero one two
95:52 - three four five or zero one two
95:54 - three 4 and you could say get pixel 4
95:58 - comma 2 which would be this pixel right
96:01 - over here
96:03 - so you can use those functions and i
96:04 - might in some of the examples but i want
96:06 - to look at a different way of accessing
96:07 - the pixels which is
96:09 - arguably going to at least be the
96:10 - speediest and allow for the most
96:12 - possibilities
96:14 - i don't know if that's entirely true but
96:15 - let's just take that for now
96:17 - and so what that is is what i'm
96:20 - referring to is something called the
96:21 - pixels
96:22 - array so behind the scenes in p5
96:26 - there's a very long array
96:29 - we have lots of numbers in it those
96:31 - numbers correspond to
96:33 - all of the colors in this canvas
96:36 - so the question that we have to figure
96:38 - out is if i want to
96:41 - change the color for this particular
96:43 - pixel
96:44 - how do i find where in this array
96:48 - to do that and so to do that we need to
96:51 - do we need to do a little bit of math
96:52 - because this is just a linear list uh
96:55 - one-dimensional
96:56 - list array and but the the the image
97:00 - we'll think of as this two-dimensional
97:01 - thing so how do we go back and forth
97:02 - between the two of them now
97:04 - this is not some unique problem it
97:06 - happens in any computer graphics
97:07 - environment but there is something
97:09 - different at least if you've used
97:10 - processing before um just to take that
97:12 - as an example
97:13 - the way that the pixels work in p5.js
97:16 - html5 canvas
97:17 - is quite different than in processing
97:19 - that's quite similar but there's a big
97:20 - sort of major fundamental difference
97:22 - and you will see that as i go through
97:23 - this so let's
97:25 - look at this now so let's just start
97:29 - let me start by telling you that the
97:30 - pixels in the array if this is the array
97:34 - right i'm going to give myself a bunch
97:37 - of spots here
97:40 - the pixel start like this pixel the very
97:42 - first thing
97:43 - index 0 in the array refers to this
97:46 - particular pixel here but it doesn't
97:48 - refer to the entire pixel it just refers
97:50 - to the red
97:52 - value of that pixel some number between
97:54 - 0 and 255.
97:56 - the second element index number 1 in the
97:58 - array
97:59 - refers to the green value for that
98:02 - particular pixel
98:03 - the third element or index number two
98:05 - refers to the blue value and the fourth
98:07 - element or index number three
98:09 - refers to the alpha value so it takes
98:12 - four spots of the array for
98:16 - one pixel now remember i said there are
98:18 - 60 pixels
98:20 - that means how long is this array six
98:22 - times four
98:24 - the length of the array is 240.
98:29 - so for an image that is six by four that
98:31 - has
98:32 - sorry six by five that has 60 pixels
98:37 - the array itself has four times that
98:39 - many spots because there's a red green
98:41 - blue and alpha value for each spot
98:42 - meaning the length of the array is 240.
98:45 - okay so that we've established now still
98:48 - so you can think about this
98:51 - is the this pixel starts at spot zero
98:56 - this pixel starts at spot and by i
98:58 - should stop saying spot it should say
98:59 - index
99:00 - starts at index four this one at index
99:02 - eight this one index 12
99:04 - this one index 16. so this is how
99:07 - each each pixel's color values in the
99:09 - array are four
99:11 - are separated by four index values so
99:14 - that's
99:14 - the first thing to establish now let's
99:17 - not think about that
99:18 - for a second and let's just think
99:22 - so that that we've established now i'm
99:23 - going to erase this and back up again
99:26 - for a second let's say i want to just
99:28 - though
99:29 - number the pixels like this 0 1 2 3 4
99:32 - 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
99:35 - 13 14 15 and this is our important one
99:38 - 16 17 16. so
99:42 - one thing that you'll notice here if i'm
99:43 - numbering the pixels this way
99:46 - is that the first row is zero through
99:48 - five the second row
99:50 - is zero through five plus six
99:53 - right zero plus six is six six plus six
99:56 - is twelve
99:57 - one plus six six seven seven plus six is
99:59 - 13. so
100:00 - if i know the x y
100:03 - coordinate on the screen something like
100:06 - the coordinate
100:07 - 4 times 2 i can get that number 16
100:11 - by saying x plus y
100:14 - times width or
100:19 - 4 plus 2 times 6
100:22 - or 4 plus 12 which equals 16.
100:26 - so this is the formula for getting
100:29 - the numeric the number pixel it is
100:34 - on the screen now then i have to say
100:36 - where is it in the array
100:38 - remember the array actually went 0 4 8
100:40 - 12
100:42 - whoa right yeah 0 4 8 12 16.
100:46 - so then all i need to do is multiply
100:48 - this by four
100:50 - so the way that i can find where the
100:52 - color values for a given pixel
100:54 - are in the array is the x value
100:57 - the x coordinate plus the y coordinate
101:00 - times the width and this whole thing
101:02 - times four so you might need to diagram
101:05 - this out yourself get a piece of graph
101:06 - paper
101:07 - review it a few times but ultimately
101:09 - this formula
101:10 - you can just memorize it you're going to
101:12 - see it in every almost every example i
101:13 - make right now
101:14 - so let's go back to the code itself and
101:17 - i gotta wake up my computer
101:19 - wake up computer and now i can go
101:23 - to my code so
101:26 - now all i want to do that first
101:30 - is deal with the pixels of the canvas
101:31 - itself one thing you have to do
101:33 - if you're going to deal with the pixel
101:35 - of the canvas is alert p5 javascript the
101:37 - browser i don't know who we're talking
101:38 - to here
101:39 - but you've got to tell somebody hey i
101:41 - want to work with the pixels
101:42 - so the way to do that is by saying
101:45 - load pixels and i'm going to put this in
101:48 - draw
101:49 - so the first thing i need to do is say
101:50 - load pixels now i can do anything i want
101:53 - i can say pixels index 365.
101:58 - you know equals 255.
102:02 - now i don't know what this is going to
102:03 - do and then ah if i ever change the
102:05 - pixels i need to say hey
102:07 - i'm done changing the pixels
102:10 - let me now say update pixels so i have
102:12 - messed with the pixel array and if i
102:14 - went back
102:15 - and i loaded it we should see uh some
102:17 - pixel got some value somewhere
102:19 - the truth of the matter is i'm not gonna
102:20 - be able to find that pixel i have no
102:22 - idea 365 was that the red part the green
102:24 - part the alpha part
102:25 - so ultimately we're not going to see
102:26 - anything so let's be a bit more
102:28 - methodical about this
102:29 - let's try to change just the first pixel
102:32 - in the top left corner
102:34 - so we know that's the red value green
102:36 - value blue value
102:38 - we need a red green a green value a blue
102:40 - value and an alpha those should be the
102:42 - first four
102:42 - so that top left pixel should be white
102:47 - let's zoom all the way in there ah you
102:49 - can see that look at that
102:50 - do you see that white pixel up there in
102:52 - the top left are we sure about that
102:54 - let's let's move it over let's say four
102:57 - five
102:57 - six seven
103:01 - oh you can see it moved over right can
103:02 - you see that pixel i changed a little
103:04 - bit moved over
103:05 - right are we really sure about this
103:07 - let's and you know what i could do
103:08 - actually why am i even bothering i could
103:10 - just say
103:11 - oh no i have to say a load pistol i
103:12 - could make this zero
103:15 - refresh look at it now i got my pink
103:17 - pixel we made a pink pixel
103:20 - whose giant mouse pointer pointing to it
103:22 - today is a beautiful moment
103:24 - right because if you know how to
103:26 - individually address
103:28 - every single pixel in a canvas there is
103:30 - nothing you can't possibly draw
103:32 - you're mad the world is now your oyster
103:34 - i mean you know you want to have a 3d
103:36 - library for doing all that kind of stuff
103:38 - probably you're not going to do it by
103:39 - pixel by pixel but there's a lot of
103:40 - possibilities this opens up
103:42 - so we see the basics at play here
103:45 - but what i want to do is now let me look
103:47 - at how i might actually address
103:49 - every single pixel so how might i do
103:51 - that so
103:54 - you know if you're watching this video
103:56 - hopefully you're aware
103:57 - of the idea of something called a for
103:59 - loop and we can see this particular for
104:02 - loop is a loop that's saying
104:04 - for every x have x go from
104:07 - have a variable called x and have x
104:10 - cycle
104:11 - 0 1 2 3 4 5. and what do i want to do
104:14 - for every x i want to actually maybe i
104:17 - want to do it the reverse
104:18 - i want to say like 4 the first row which
104:20 - is y
104:21 - do every x then for the second one do
104:24 - every x
104:25 - then for the third one do every x so i
104:27 - need a loop that's going through the y's
104:29 - as well
104:29 - and this is what's known as a nested
104:31 - loop you
104:32 - may have seen this in other things so
104:36 - so if i say this
104:40 - and i add another bracket and then i
104:42 - need to put
104:43 - indent these a little bit we can now
104:45 - look at this and we can say
104:47 - aha this is a loop that's saying for
104:49 - every y
104:50 - value start at y value 0 go through all
104:52 - the x's
104:53 - now have y equal 1 go through the all
104:55 - the x's now have y equal 2
104:57 - go through all the x's so this nested
104:59 - loop has the property of hitting
105:01 - every single x and y in the window so
105:04 - now we should be able to apply our
105:06 - formula
105:07 - var index equals do we remember this
105:13 - x plus y times width times four
105:17 - x plus y times width this whole thing
105:23 - times four and now i should be able to
105:26 - take
105:26 - this and put this here
105:30 - indent it properly and say
105:34 - index index
105:37 - plus one right the index that value is
105:39 - the red value of every pixel
105:41 - one is the green the next one is the
105:44 - blue the next one is the alpha so index
105:46 - index plus ah
105:50 - plus two
105:53 - index plus three and you know i might
105:56 - just for like
105:57 - symmetry here add the plus zero there i
106:00 - don't know if that's necessary but you
106:01 - can see this is the chunk i need
106:03 - the index is the start of the pixel and
106:05 - there are four values associated with
106:07 - the pixel now there's something that's
106:08 - going to happen which is going to cause
106:09 - this not to work which i'll
106:10 - get to in a second but this is this is
106:12 - essentially the right code i missed a
106:14 - small little piece
106:14 - only because i'm using a retina laptop
106:16 - which i'll get to in a second
106:18 - so if i hit refresh here we can say ah
106:20 - weird it worked but i didn't get the
106:21 - whole canvas
106:22 - like i got this like stripe of pink
106:25 - across the top
106:26 - so unfortunately we live in a world now
106:29 - or fortunately
106:30 - where we have these like hd pi hp
106:33 - high definition display high pixel
106:35 - density hot
106:36 - pixel density so mac retina
106:40 - displays other types of high density
106:42 - displays actually have like
106:44 - four pixels for every quote-unquote
106:46 - pixel
106:47 - to make things finer and more higher
106:49 - resolution and so
106:51 - if this is actually what you're seeing
106:52 - here is a view of a high density display
106:54 - and so one thing i want to do just in
106:56 - people i could get into this and i could
106:58 - draw the pixels at higher density to do
106:59 - all sorts of stuff but something i could
107:01 - do in p5
107:02 - just to like turn this problem off is
107:05 - say pixel density one
107:07 - so what i'm saying that is like i don't
107:08 - care what kind of display the user is on
107:11 - i don't i want the canvas to be one
107:14 - pixel per
107:15 - pixel kind of regular density display as
107:17 - they were
107:19 - a year many years ago in olden times so
107:22 - if i do that we should see there we go
107:25 - and you know it's giving me some sort of
107:26 - like warning that
107:28 - image smoothing enabled it's changed
107:30 - something and we can kind of ignore that
107:32 - in the console but you can see i have
107:33 - now
107:34 - essentially written the code for the
107:36 - background function right
107:37 - the p5 background function you know does
107:39 - exactly this
107:40 - it you give it a color like 255 comma 0
107:43 - comma 255 and it fills the entire
107:45 - background
107:46 - with those pixels but i can do all sorts
107:48 - of things now like i could say
107:52 - i could say x right and y i don't know
107:55 - what this is going to do
107:56 - and i could hit and run this you could
107:58 - see now i have this kind of like
107:59 - gradient right
108:00 - because the amount of red increases as
108:01 - the pixels move to the right
108:03 - the amount of blue increases as the
108:04 - pixels move down it mixes in the center
108:08 - i could then also say like
108:11 - make the green value a random value and
108:13 - now we've got this like
108:14 - snowy rainbow noise ah the rainbow yay
108:18 - whenever something happens that's
108:19 - rainbow like in a it makes me happy and
108:22 - i feel glad about it so this really
108:23 - concludes this particular video
108:26 - i would say to you try to get this set
108:28 - up see what kind of magic pixel
108:30 - pixel wonderland you can make for
108:31 - yourself
108:33 - and what i'm going to do in the next
108:34 - video is take this concept
108:36 - and actually not just make up pixel
108:38 - colors out of thin air
108:40 - but actually pull pixels from an image
108:42 - this being a live
108:43 - a video source and manipulate them or
108:46 - draw something else
108:46 - based on those colors so i hope you
108:48 - enjoyed this video
108:50 - it was 14 minutes and 46 seconds long
108:53 - and share with me in the comments if you
108:55 - make something and post it somewhere i
108:56 - would love to see what it is
109:00 - okay everyone uh
109:05 - that was another video i'm wondering i
109:07 - think i actually unfortunately have to
109:08 - take a break
109:09 - now uh
109:14 - so there are some i'm gonna look at some
109:15 - of the questions now people have uh
109:17 - posted interesting questions
109:20 - um boy there's a lot of chat going on
109:23 - here i'm not sure okay
109:25 - hello um
109:28 - so someone says it's a bit daunting it
109:31 - appears that you need to know javascript
109:32 - inside out as well as processing to do
109:34 - all these cool features
109:36 - you're right in the sense that what i'm
109:37 - doing right now is kind of
109:39 - you know 15 20 tutorials in
109:42 - the this this particular tutorial
109:44 - assumes you know javascript it assumes
109:46 - you know the sort of basics of how
109:47 - an environment like p5 or processing
109:49 - works um but certainly um you can go
109:52 - back and
109:52 - watch some of my early tutorials which
109:54 - will like kind of cover all those basics
109:56 - before diving right in um uh
110:02 - [Music]
110:04 - okay uh okay there's
110:08 - people having a discussion about this
110:12 - yes some people ask about i did do a
110:13 - whole set of videos about just
110:15 - html css and p5 dom that'll
110:19 - help fill in some of these gaps there's
110:22 - a really interesting point here the
110:24 - gankable player on twitch writes
110:27 - so so uh he or she is asking about
110:30 - um um the gankable players asking okay
110:34 - so why instead of having at each of
110:37 - these spots
110:38 - a red green and blue and alpha values
110:41 - separate spots
110:42 - why not just have the array itself have
110:44 - some sort of color object
110:46 - right so the index values are zero and
110:48 - one and there's an object here that has
110:50 - like a red green blue and
110:51 - alpha element of the object so i would
110:53 - say that that's a
110:54 - totally reasonable interesting idea and
110:57 - if i were making up a
110:58 - pixel-based library framework from
111:00 - scratch i might do it that way
111:02 - and p5 certainly could do it that way
111:05 - however native html5 javascript the way
111:09 - it works is uh not this way it's with
111:12 - having rgb alpha as separate elements
111:14 - maybe there's a speed or efficiency
111:16 - issue there and so i think it for p5 to
111:19 - kind of work in the same way
111:21 - is a sort of is good in that you're not
111:24 - if you're kind of moving back between
111:27 - native javascript and canvas and using
111:29 - some p5 stuff
111:30 - it's not going to be different so i
111:31 - think kind of like building a layer that
111:33 - allows you
111:34 - easier quicker access to the pixels but
111:36 - not change the way the pixels are
111:37 - organized
111:38 - is kind of a good compromise i think
111:42 - okay let me come back over here see if
111:44 - there are other questions
111:47 - performance issue yeah um
111:51 - so um so one thing i'll say um
111:54 - the gang gobble player also wrote um i'm
111:57 - thinking i'm not good enough for open
111:59 - source one thing that i think is really
112:00 - important to say about p5.js
112:02 - p5.js is an open and welcoming community
112:05 - to people of all ages of all genders of
112:08 - all backgrounds of all
112:10 - uh countries and of all skill levels
112:14 - so you should come on to p5 and file a
112:18 - github issue or check out the wikis
112:20 - participate in the open source community
112:22 - that a p5 is and not worry about whether
112:24 - you
112:24 - are at the right level or not um they're
112:27 - because one of the things about p5 is to
112:29 - really try to create as open and
112:31 - welcoming uh
112:31 - community in terms of p5 development and
112:34 - also i'll mention let me come over here
112:35 - and plug
112:36 - somebody else's videos which is luisa
112:40 - pereira am i pronouncing vimeo
112:43 - p5.js let me see if this is going to
112:45 - come up
112:46 - looking looking inside so um looking
112:50 - inside p5
112:51 - is a video series that luisa pereira is
112:54 - making
112:55 - which is uh it's on vimeo it's a
112:57 - tutorial series but it's not about a
112:59 - programming tutorial
113:00 - it's a tutorial about how p5 as an open
113:02 - source project
113:03 - is organized for a beginner and how you
113:06 - could contribute and participate in that
113:07 - so
113:07 - i encourage you guys to check those
113:09 - videos out as well
113:11 - um okay so
113:14 - um so i'm what i'm gonna let you it's
113:17 - almost noon and i was gonna take a break
113:19 - at noon for a little bit
113:20 - um and i'm gonna come back let's let me
113:22 - i'm gonna answer more questions because
113:24 - uh
113:24 - if i can let me come back here and look
113:27 - at my list here
113:29 - so i got through this much so i want to
113:32 - do
113:32 - maybe these four topics later this
113:34 - afternoon
113:36 - see if i can get to them um um
113:40 - yeah so that's what's happening today
113:42 - now let me look at the chat
113:44 - okay so um uh kujun sherpa writes
113:48 - question is it reasonable to use
113:50 - processing to write android apps
113:52 - yes in fact it is not only reasonable it
113:54 - is encouraged
113:55 - processing there is actually um let me
113:56 - just launch processing for a second oh
113:58 - did i update to the most recent version
114:00 - um i'm going to launch this is
114:01 - processing if you're not familiar with
114:03 - it it's a
114:04 - creative coding environment built on top
114:05 - of java so for like desktop application
114:08 - development
114:09 - and you'll notice up here there's this
114:11 - little tab
114:12 - that says java and i you can also write
114:14 - your processing sketches in python if i
114:16 - change to python mode this wouldn't be
114:18 - there by default
114:19 - you've got to go to add mode and here's
114:22 - one that i don't have added i will add
114:24 - it right now see if this works
114:25 - hit install so i've now installed
114:30 - android mode
114:32 - and i can now switch to android mode
114:35 - oops
114:36 - i think i have to oh so this is telling
114:38 - me i also have to go
114:40 - and download the android s i have to
114:42 - click this so it's going to do a lot
114:43 - more downloading to download the android
114:45 - sdk
114:45 - but you can actually use processing
114:47 - itself to develop android apps it's
114:48 - designed to do that
114:50 - um and you know i would say that this
114:53 - it's in development there's
114:55 - you know there's probably a lot of
114:56 - things that work and some things that
114:56 - maybe don't work as well
114:58 - but if i look up if i google android
115:00 - processing the place where you should
115:01 - start
115:02 - is this particular wiki github.com
115:05 - processing slash processing dash android
115:07 - uh wiki
115:08 - and you'll see there are a whole lot of
115:11 - instructions and information for how to
115:13 - run on a device and
115:14 - get started and that sort of thing so i
115:16 - i you know i don't have a lot of
115:17 - experience using processing for android
115:19 - but
115:19 - i hope that you will look into it and
115:20 - contribute to the project if you find
115:22 - things
115:23 - um paul mcguire asks what are you using
115:26 - for your real-time chroma key i am using
115:29 - a um software called wirecast uh it's
115:32 - commercial software i use you know costs
115:34 - somewhere
115:34 - in the hundreds of dollars um uh but it
115:38 - has a lot of features for me it has a
115:39 - feature that allows me to take multiple
115:41 - camera feeds in as well and i've hooked
115:42 - up a like a button to like switch
115:44 - between them automatically
115:46 - it also allows you to like live
115:48 - broadcast to youtube or twitch or any of
115:50 - these things
115:51 - so that's what i'm using currently
115:58 - let me see if i have any important
116:00 - emails
116:03 - about my meeting at noon that might be
116:05 - pushed back in which case i might keep
116:07 - going
116:08 - uh i don't see anything about that okay
116:11 - so it looks like um
116:13 - let me look on twitter here for a second
116:20 - okay so that seems to be the last
116:22 - question
116:27 - where else is this being streamed so
116:29 - currently i
116:30 - haven't really decided i love feedback
116:32 - about this i have been doing all my
116:34 - streams on youtube
116:35 - so um you know just to like
116:39 - put some urls here for you guys
116:41 - currently i am
116:43 - youtube.com shiffman so and slash live
116:47 - is where the youtube live stream is that
116:49 - some of you are watching
116:50 - uh all uh later this sort of edited
116:52 - chunks of videos get uploaded as
116:54 - standalone chunks they appear on youtube
116:56 - i also started recently streaming to
116:58 - twitch
117:00 - dot tv slash coding rainbow
117:05 - to see how twitch worked as a technology
117:07 - to see if there was a different
117:08 - community there that might discover
117:10 - and enjoy the videos or live streams um
117:13 - so i don't know i'm you know i think i'm
117:15 - on a verizon fios connection here
117:17 - uh it seems to be streaming fine to both
117:20 - at the same time
117:21 - and recording got a mac pro doing all
117:23 - this but please if you notice like the
117:25 - stream is like
117:26 - having issues or the audio's cutting out
117:28 - that sort of thing please let me know
117:29 - these are the two places where i'm
117:30 - streaming
117:31 - at present so i think
117:37 - uh good lunch oh yeah so um
117:41 - somebody asked can i open two windows in
117:44 - one program i don't know exactly what
117:46 - you're referring to
117:47 - but i did recently make a video that's
117:49 - on my youtube channel about
117:50 - multiple canvases in the same p5 sketch
117:53 - using something called instance mode
117:54 - so if you go to my youtube channel and
117:56 - search instance mode shiffman on youtube
117:58 - i'm sure you'll find it
118:00 - um so i hope to be
118:03 - back at around 2 p.m
118:06 - eastern time stay tuned to my twitter
118:10 - i'm just plugging everything right now
118:12 - follow me at twitter.com
118:15 - shiffman uh i hope to be i think about a
118:18 - couple hours i have a meeting i'm going
118:19 - to grab some lunch
118:21 - i want to finish these videos i
118:23 - definitely won't be going any later than
118:24 - like 4 p.m or 4 30 p.m eastern time
118:27 - today
118:27 - so sometime between 2 p.m and 4 30 p.m
118:31 - um i will um come back live i also
118:35 - another just uh if you want to be able
118:37 - to sign up for alerts
118:40 - if you go to shiffman.net that's my
118:42 - website shiffman.net
118:44 - there is a email you can put your email
118:47 - in here to get updates the thing is i've
118:49 - said this every time now
118:50 - mailchimp has blocked me because i guess
118:52 - i sent my test email out incorrectly
118:54 - and they blocked me as a spammer so this
118:56 - i'm getting your email addresses but
118:58 - mailchimp isn't letting me send anything
118:59 - so i haven't sent out any of these
119:00 - updates yet but i do plan on doing so or
119:03 - maybe i'll just use something else
119:04 - besides mailchimp if somebody has an
119:06 - idea of a different service i should use
119:08 - i guess i could just make a google group
119:10 - actually
119:11 - i could just use a google group can i
119:12 - make a announce only google group
119:14 - be interesting it could be interesting
119:15 - to have a discussion group on google and
119:17 - let people actually but i don't know
119:18 - this is this is opening too many doors
119:20 - the processing forum if you're looking
119:21 - for a place to ask questions
119:23 - i try to answer them in the youtube
119:24 - comments but also the processing forum
119:27 - um okay let's see if there's any other
119:29 - questions
119:32 - uh oh a message box on top of the real
119:36 - sketch
119:37 - well i don't know if you're asking about
119:39 - processing or p5
119:41 - um but um hello france
119:44 - uh bonjour or bolsoire i guess depending
119:48 - on it's like six o'clock in france
119:49 - probably
119:50 - um port du bois asked on top of the real
119:52 - sketch if you're talking about
119:53 - processing it is there is uh i think
119:56 - there's a library you can get for
119:57 - processing that allows you have two
119:59 - windows open if you're talking about a
120:01 - p5 sketch a web browser
120:02 - there's lots of different ways with html
120:04 - and css to overlay content on top of
120:07 - uh other content and i that would be a
120:09 - great i think i might have actually
120:10 - covered that in one of my
120:12 - p5 dom library videos i'll show you
120:14 - where that is if anyone wants to know
120:15 - if i can go to youtube.comshiffman
120:19 - and uh oh look it says i'm live now look
120:22 - at that
120:22 - 27 watching um if i go down to
120:26 - uh this one p5.js tutorial part two html
120:30 - css
120:30 - dom uh cover in the this video series
120:33 - all the sort of dom
120:34 - stuff to have different dom elements on
120:36 - top of stuff
120:38 - okay it's 6 p.m yeah uh
120:43 - uh okay i think that seems like all the
120:46 - comments for now
120:47 - so i'm gonna it's noon i think i i've
120:50 - been uh
120:51 - streaming for two hours uh i was uh
120:54 - watching this guy uh i think to run it
120:56 - up on twitch
120:57 - jason somerville was like a poker player
120:58 - he streams for like eight hours a day
121:00 - has like millions of followers i
121:02 - wondered if i like
121:03 - just came here and started streaming
121:05 - coding for eight eight hours a day
121:07 - i don't i don't know what would happen
121:08 - to me but that sounds like fun
121:10 - okay i'm gonna stop the stream uh tweet
121:12 - at me
121:13 - uh see you maybe later this afternoon
121:15 - it'll be late for the europe but
121:17 - uh more reasonable time for those of you
121:18 - maybe on the west coast or i don't know
121:20 - if anybody in
121:21 - australia what time it is there for
121:23 - watching
121:24 - there's not that there's 26 people on
121:26 - youtube
121:27 - and uh
121:31 - 14 people on twitch okay i've got to go
121:34 - and i'll be back in a couple hours

Cleaned transcript:

and welcome hello my name is dan i am uh here live from the school for poetic computation on thursday morning around 10 in the morning on march 31st tomorrow is april fool's day um so i'm going to be here for an hour or so um doing some tutorials for you my glasses are quite dirty i should have washed them and the topic that i'm going to explore is uh video and pixels in p5.js that's my plan i have a couple things i want to do before i get to that i've got a live chat going on both twitch and youtube i believe so i'm going to check that see if there are any questions before i get to any of that i would like to know if the audio is okay a couple days ago i had this problem with the audio crackling so i would like to know if the audio sounds good the picture is good there's also this white board over here that i might use at some point so let me know i still am working out the lighting i don't really like it so far but let me know if this is at least uh sort of legible um and in focus uh and i'm back over here i'm gonna look at the chats now to see if people are saying that things sound okay less delay here and audio is good that's good to hear thank you very much uh audio is fine today awesome okay that's great um let's see let's see what's going on here we've got uh i don't know where my um admin panel on twitch is but that's okay uh i'm gonna look over here on youtube and there are seven people watching okay so um great like last time when i did this i spent like 45 minutes just like working out a technical problem so i'm just going to jump in today so actually the first thing i want to do um is i want to use i've been using um this thing that's behind me over here the p5 editor and the p5 editor uh allows you to type your code and run your code and see the result in a browser but i want to work today in using a separate text editor sublime text and i want to just view the output in the chrome browser itself and i want to make a short video that talks about how to do that what it means to run a local server and also how to use the chrome developer tools in the console so i'm going to make a short video about that which will then allow me to use those tools in my other videos about video in p5 that's my plan um so let me a couple things though actually uh let me see if i can find i should have done this in advance but i i have a license uh i have a license for um sublime text and i want to uh sublime text license i want to put in my license so that i don't get those popups license key oh that's not right oh boy i'm never going to be able to uh all right i guess i'll worry about this later or maybe i won't worry about this later i'm going to do this now okay hold on a second i'm going to unplug this for a second uh i i just don't want to uh my email to i have to look up the license in my email and i don't want that to be broadcast live usually i don't care about this sort of stuff but you know who knows who's privately emailing me and doesn't want their name suddenly on the screen so i'm now i'm going to narrate what i'm doing here i'm looking at my computer and i'm looking for sublime license and if i search for that sublime license key 2012 is that when i purchase it let's see if that works and then i'm going to open up sublime and i'm going to go to preferences service license help purchase license enter license let me paste that in there use license thanks for purchasing great okay so that's done i can log out of my email and i can plug this back in and there it is and now i've got sublime over here and i'm gonna uh close this okay there's lots of extra stuff on the desktop here but i think that's okay i need terminal also open here the couple things that i want to reference i'm going to open up terminal um how's the font size let's make that a little bit bigger whoops and there we go that's probably pretty good move that over here the other thing i want to reference in this tutorial i'm going to make is i'm going to look for p5.js local there's a wiki page p5.js local server one of these days i'll have my computer positioned in such a way that i can look at the camera but i'm looking down it's particularly low the laptop in here i can probably get it a little bit higher you could see you can see all my lovely stickers uh okay so i want to reference this webpage where am i standing right about here um and so if i move this here and do this hit refresh you can see this here okay so now i have terminal oh and i have sublime let me make this window like this okay and now okay so that's good now the other thing i want to do is just make a dummy sketch so i'm going to do that i'm going to oops i lost ah don't disconnect computer i'm going to just check and see if anybody's asking anything somebody's reporting a slight little jump in the sound every now and then anybody let me know if you're having um any issues no i didn't wait four years i i what i do so the issue the reason why i had to enter in my license key is like the least interesting thing i could ever possibly talk about on a live stream but the reason why is because i created a new user login to this computer so i could configure the screen the way i want it for tutorials which is separate from my regular login and so i just never licensed sublime in that login okay so i want to hide the sidebar and i want to do this on the desktop as a test sketch and let's say create canvas 320 240 and um background zero and line x mod something like ellipse x uh 120 sorry i'm just gonna put something in here and our x equals zero and x equals x plus one if x i don't know i need a better default sketch so this is just a sketch that does something oops oh it's running in the browser already uh off okay okay great okay so um great i think i'm about ready to go let's see who we've got here is anybody here um sound is fine very minor um okay 11 people good morning good morning time for some jumping jacks everybody stand up do some jumping jacks with me that probably did something weird to your sound um okay so i'm getting ready i'm um to this morning the topic will be a video recorded video live video in p5 the first tutorial i'm going to do is simply about um running a local server and editing your code in a separate text editor um because um and looking at the chrome developer console i've got my whiteboard over here which i will erase i don't think i need it for this video and i oh oh i'm wearing these headphones which is totally unnecessary good thing i noticed that it'll be weird to record a whole video wearing headphones um i was testing the audio which seemed fine let me give myself some more slack here i don't know what i'm doing with this um okay let's get started just i'm gonna cycle the cameras so they don't turn off automatically and now here we go okay so this should be a short five to ten minute video tutorial lesson about what i said it was gonna be about okay let's just get started i'm gonna do the opposite the other day i took like 45 minutes before i did anything i'm just going to try to get going and here we go hello in this video where should i stand what do you think in this video i'm going to look at how to work on your p5.js sketch or really any html javascript css combo thingamabob um outside of in any old text editor by running a local server on your laptop now what does that mean actually i'm going to use the whiteboard for a second so let's just think about the internet and the web and all that stuff for a second so you are making a web page and you have a laptop and to make your web page you're maybe editing an html file maybe you have a css file maybe you have a javascript file and you're editing all these files they're just plain text files and you're editing them in some text editor so the text editor i'm going to use happens to be one called sublime but you can use any text editor list of text editors i would say now if i could think of them but you i'll put some in the comments and you can write some in the comments your favorite put your favorite text editor in the comments so but i'm going to use sublime text so you're editing these files now one of the things i'm going to show you is that you know another thing that you're going to run on your laptop is a thing called a browser and your browser actually has the ability just to open those files so you could ask your browser open the html file and you're going to see that the result of that file in the browser are going to fix the mic here in the middle of this video hold on i can um pause um it's fine you know what i'm gonna start over i don't need to start over i'm just gonna fix the mic uh and i'll edit it together i keep doing that um what's a better way i don't know why all right maybe i should just suck it up and button this shirt where am i come up like this you know what i should do is probably like loop it and then use a piece of tape there are all these professional ways of doing this i'm getting a text message or no just somebody just a notification on my phone wait okay um i think that's gonna be better with the audio now let me go back and just see um um let's see what's going on here the mic was fine oh thanks i know but it was the i the mic might have been fine um audio wise but i it was like tugging on me and it was feeling weird so i'm gonna uh pick up from where i left off somehow okay edit edit somehow i'll edit this edit edit magic edit so um crap i don't even know what i was like talking about try that again okay the thing that i'm talking about is uh the browser opening the file in the browser okay magic edit so if you open those files from the browser you're going to see the result of those files in the browser now let's think of what's your ultimate goal here the ultimately the idea probably is that you have a server server and you have your server hosting some website you know website.com and ultimately what you're going to do is you're going to take your files and put them on a server so that other people on their laptops and computers or phones or whatever it is can connect and look at your files so by opening the file by opening the html file from the browser you aren't actually doing what the web server itself will do which will ultimately serve up the files so that other people can request them so a better and in fact a lot of things won't work if you just open those files so uh okay i have to keep going i can't start over and erase all this um so um so ultimately what you want to do is by the way like the you know the youtube makes these charts you can look at these charts where you see people drop off and stop watching your video and just about everybody stops watching this video now but for the few of you are remaining i'm going to keep going with this so what you ultimately want to do is run something which i'll call a local server so if you run a local web server on this machine you are more accurately simulating what will happen when you eventually upload your files to a server and everything will look and work and function correctly so this is what i want to show you in this video how do you edit your files with a text editor run a local server so that you can see the result in the file of those files in your browser and accurately simulate the environment that will eventually exist when you publish your stuff to the world and become the person who publishes their stuff for the world there we go okay so let's go back to the computer now and take a look at this so this is actually the p5 desktop editor which you may or may not have used actually does all this for you it's a text editor you hit this run button and it spawns a local server it opens a little browser which shows your page but what i'm going to do actually is i'm going to just quit out of it and i'm going to show you that if i go to my computer's desktop i don't know if you can't really see this and i go here i was actually i made i there's a folder called test sketch and in this folder are the files associated with my sketch there's an html file a javascript file and a folder called libraries that libraries folder is where the p5.js library itself exists so what i want to do is now i have something i have a text editor called sublime text you can google it you can find it you can use any text editor you want and what i want to do is look at those files in sublime text one way i can do that is actually just take this and drag it in and now you can see here that i have now have i'm now browsing and looking at those files and if i wanted to edit my code i could look at it right here and now i can edit the code i can actually make the font a little bit bigger and you can see here i'm editing my code now let me make the next point if i just go back here and click on this html file i have no idea what's going to happen it's going to open it in some default browser it might be safari it might be chrome if i open it it opens in chrome and you can see it's working it's actually running but look what's happening up here it's opening it from the file path file users processing desktops test sketch so while this works there are a lot of things that won't work when you're opening it just from the file path itself that only work if you're using a local server running a local server certain things like loading an image file into your sketch for example won't work so while this is okay as a solution a quick and dirty test i personally would recommend never doing it this way instead you want to run a local server so there happens to be this wiki on github under the p5.js wiki which has a bunch of different instructions of different ways you can run a local server on different operating systems windows linux mac apache the thing that i'm going to use which i think is the simplest is you i'm since i'm on a mac and a macs come with python installed i can just run a python local server from any directory i want so what i'm going to do the way i'm going to do this is by running terminal so if you don't know where terminal is it's in the the you know applications utilities there's an application called terminal when you run it it looks something like this this is giving you console command line access to your computer and i can type various things like if i type pwd that stands for print working directory and you can see oh i'm in user slash processing and if i just type cd that means change directory and if i type desktop i want to change to the desktop and now if i type p pwd i could see ah i'm in users processing desktop other things i can do is i can hit the up arrow the up arrow goes to my most recent command and i see it again and now if i'm on the desktop i can run a local server from here and i can say python dash m simple http server so this just happens to be a command that i have memorized but i'm saying i want to run a python program that's built into the macintosh it's called simple http server i forget what the dash m stands for somebody will tell me in the comments i hit enter and you can see ah serving http on zero zero zero port eight thousand what this means is my this computer is now running a web server where is the web server running it's running on localhost and another way of saying localhost is 0.0.0.0. so that's the ip address the internet protocol address the address the numeric address of a computer on the internet and those numbers can become rather important but for us right now we can just think of it as localhost port 8000 being the port that other people can connect to who are the other people they're me so i am the other person and what i want to do now is go up here right and instead of accessing my sketch from file what i want to do is say http localhost now you can see i've done this before on this computer so it's already like prefilling it in but i want to go to localhost colon port 8000. localhost colon port 8000 i hit enter now you don't actually see my sketch because actually i what i now see is a view of everything on the desktop so you can see i have a bunch of other things like i was doing this photo booth um p5 demo which uh has this snap button which allows me to take so this is something i'm going to make a tutorial about in a minute another video watch a video a few videos from now you'll find this one but you can see i'm sort of browsing this is the minimum spanning tree example so i have a bunch of folders with sketches i'm sort of serving up that whole my whole desktop which i can choose to do or not to do but what i'm looking for is test sketch this is the one and i can make it bigger in chrome by shift command plus so now i see the sketch running and i could go back to the code and i could say hey let me change the background to 100 hit save tab over to chrome hit refresh and you can see now i have the new sketch running so this is another way of working outside of some allinone editor environment text editor local server browser but missing piece let's say in draw the draw loop i want to debug the value of x so i'm going to say console.log x now i could have said print line x print line is a p5 specific function that prints something to the console console.log is the sort of native javascript version of that function basically the same thing but if i put that in there and i go back and hit refresh where is it i don't see it no log no console so in chrome i can use something called the chrome developer tools are you excited you shouldn't be maybe you are maybe you should be i don't know so where do you get those view up here under view developer developer tools but i want to go straight to the javascript console the developer tools are this massive thing that has all sorts of inspect this look at that html css style this magic this all i really care about is the javascript console right now i want to see things that are console.logged so i'm going to select javascript console and it's going to appear now it won't necessarily look like this on your computer you're probably going to see it at the bottom you're probably going to see it a lot smaller but what i've done is you know you can you can there's various ways you can like move it around and change the font size you know i want it to be kind of rather big so i can for a tutorial you can see it so what's nice here is you can see there's the result and it's showing me this each one of these things is printing from sketch.js line number eight so if i go over here and see line number eight console.log x so that's great now i can also comment this out and refresh the sketch one of the wonderful things about the chrome javascript console is that it is interactive what do i mean by that i can actually type in the value x the variable x which is a variable in my program hit enter and it's going to show me the current value of x so i can kind of live debug as the program's running i can do other things like i could say x equals 50. getting to the other side of the screen hit enter and you can see that i actually changed on the fly the value of that variable and it moved i can do other things like what if i said no loop no loop is a function in p5 that turns off draw and suddenly it stops looping i can say loop i can do things like just call other functions like if i say create p hello create p is a p5 function that creates a paragraph dom element and there you go hello is right there it's also showing me what's in that dom element and there's so there's a lot more to this and i'll as i make other tutorials that use the chrome developer console you'll see more and more about it so this has been about 10 minutes hopefully this helped you make sense of the world it's a very hard world to make sense of these days and this probably doesn't help make sense of the world but it makes sense of a small part of the world the local server on your laptop with the chrome developer tools i'm sure you have questions um and i will answer them somehow in a way i don't know how yet but in in the comments of this video or in another video um and i look forward to seeing you in the next video maybe maybe maybe not okay thanks very much i'm a hit stop okay um so i'm now still live streaming for those of you but i recorded that i need to edit it together unfortunately uh uh okay let me i'm gonna read through the discussion here for a second to see if i have anything to add uh regarding text editors j edit oh adam from github is a good one probably should have mentioned that note tab visual studio code brackets is good notepad brackets has a builtin server yeah i probably should use all these uh someone says hoping for connect discussion today we'll see if we can get to that uh okay microphone fell off okay m is for oh m is for module probably localhost i thought localhost was always 127.0.0 that is correct i don't know why python is telling me so let's let's let's investigate this 127.0.0.1 that obviously works as it should 0.0.0.0 also works so these are just other ways that seem to work um oops that's funny uh not so funny these are i guess either those work all zeroes are localized okay um let me check uh twitch uh dash m mod run library module as a script terminates option list um okay uh great all right so now that i made that video and finished it i'm just gonna do something i need to rename the files because i get confused later so if you guys won't mind bearing with me here you can't see this unfortunately i have another computer which records video files to disk and what i can do is do i don't know which one these are i'm going to call this a local server one local because i local server two uh local server three okay so i named those files so hopefully those will get saved um and here we go oh wow there's 30 people watching on youtube that's amazing hello everybody okay so um let me take a minute here for all of you watching live to just say say a few words about my kind of overall plan so i keep this uh github gist um i don't know i guess if you go to get gist.github.com shiffman you can probably find it um this is where i keep track of like a list of everything i hope to make um some new some and i have some larger series that i'm hoping to do i kind of don't for some reason i've been shying away from getting i'm hoping next week to pick one of these i want to make some videos about neural networks which i've been afraid of doing but i've just decided i'm gonna there's so much happening in um kind of the machine learning with art creative coding stuff that i feel like i should maybe try to revisit that even though it terrifies me it's not really necessarily area of my expertise i've been working with the raspberry pi in processing so i want to make a few videos about that uh chrome extensions is something we want to do a lot of people have requested node plus p5 so i want to do that i've made a bunch of videos about the kinect and computer vision and i want to do more of those um some other p5.js and sound i want to make a whole set of git tutorials and then i think what i don't know why uh video so one thing that i want to do i guess this isn't really is i think what i want to try to tackle today is video in p5 so let's let me make a list and you guys can uh chime in i'm going to make a list here just for right now um of how i'm thinking of approaching this so what i want to look at is i'm trying to decide if i usually record i'm going to do create capture first i think the live video stuff is a little bit more interesting not more interesting but i kind of like so just basic create capture i did these the other day but the audio was had crackles in it so i'm going to redo them then i'm going to show how to use create capture to do a photo booth with snapshots um then i want to examine looking at pixel array um so i'm in a pixel process um then we'll do like a brightness mirror and then we'll do like a painting uh paint a portrait um from live video um these are all the things i want to do and then i'm trying to think of what else uh the other thing that i like to demonstrate is how to make a like muybridge style um video history you know slit scan is an interesting thing to look at how to do how to make how to make a slit scan that could be good so this is kind of what i have in mind i would like to do all of these today it's 10 30 i have till about noon and then i'll take a break for a while and i might come back this afternoon and do some more so look at this list think about it i'm gonna look in the chat um nobody's really said anything here i've got so the other thing i've got is i've got youtube live going and twitch live going i don't know if that's kind of ridiculous i was hoping maybe some people would find me with twitch um but i don't see too many uh comments here let's see if anything's happening on twitter uh oh i have a lot of notifications because you can ask me questions there too uh uh interesting um okay uh sorry i was reading some somebody wrote an interesting comment on twitter which is i would prefer to back you on patreon monthly than subject users to ads so it's an interesting question i've started um you know i put ads on the youtube videos i can't decide whether that's a good idea or not you know my kind of excuse for doing that is i want to close caption everything um for hearing impaired um and it costs if i pay a service to that it costs about 20 25 per video and i was thinking if i put ads and once each video gets about 20 or 25 then i'll close caption it you know i honestly like if this were i would love to do this uh more of it and if it's a you know i kind of do it in connection with my teaching at nyu so on the one hand i'm happy to just do this um but also maybe maybe there is sort of a business model for doing this i don't know i feel very sheepish about this but if anybody has any feedback about that if the ads really bother you or don't bother you um let me know uh okay um lauren covered slit scan on cadenza oh that's great to know i guess maybe i'll do it also here um okay so i'm going to get started with this then i think and i'm going to do all of these my preference right now is to use sublime and uh uh and and run things oh and run things uh locally so let me get set up for that sorry uh let me make a folder called p5.js video and i'm going to give myself a little shortcut to that here and uh let me make a uh sorry where am i where am i where am i where am i um let me just grab um let me grab this test sketch and put it in there and call it uh one create capture and so i can save these for later and i'm going to uh take this oops and put it open it with sublime and move this back over oh uncreate capture sketch okay so we see that and just so i see that something is there get this set up uh if i look at the html file o1 create capture get rid of this and close that and now i want to go to p5.js under for video run my local server and and uh i don't need this a local host there we go create capture there we go sublime browser sublime browser sublime browser terminal i don't need that open and there we go okay everyone i think i'm ready to check the chat one more time and yes i have so patreon is something i am considering um uh some so some people write uh paraglider writes ads are okay with me the other person writes most people that are opinionated about ads probably run in ad blocker anyway i'm used to the video and image processing features um yeah so some people are asking questions in the chat about the p5 editor i don't want to get too lost in a discussion about that because i want to get started with this video tutorial but i will say that one of the things that the processing foundation is actively working on right now is a webbased editor that can run in the browser i think one of the tricky things about a javascript web creative coding environment is there are numerous ways you could develop you could use something like atom you could do something like brackets you could use something like codepen and so uh in order in creating a kind of beginnerfriendly platform i think having a one that might be sort of geared towards education in that sense uh having a webbased editor makes a lot of sense um but there is uh but um but yeah so anyway that's all i want to kind of say about that i hear some some noise in the other room but i won't worry about it okay i'm back uh okay um here we go so can you guys hear that by the way it's a little distracting for me there's people talking and playing music nearby but i'll just keep going anyway 33 people are watching i better get started okay that's distracting you guys maybe you guys can't hear that it doesn't really matter i'm gonna cycle the cameras i'm gonna just hey everybody i'm just gonna mute myself for a second i'm gonna go see what that noise is nobody hears the other room okay but i'm just gonna be right back okay i have discovered what it is for all those of you who are interested it's just uh it actually seems to have gone away but it's uh joe the trainer has a uh athletic training studio that's right next door so pc i think the music and the noise was coming from there in between videos and i'll go and get myself like a workout or something okay here we go uh i should probably just meditate or something to reduce the level of kind of panicked uncertainty i have in my life okay there's a camera there's a camera i'm ready to go i'm gonna kind of close this a little bit and oh i wanted to just briefly erase this and i think this camera by the way is slightly because this is level the camera's slightly askew wonder if i could fix that i probably shouldn't worry about it right now of course ah well look what you guys are watching oh no how do i get out of this how do i get out of this there we go okay uh actually let me let me focus this really quick just make sure the focus is good um you guys this will entertain you uh so here i am uh actually that's pretty good but let me just get it this is like live stream focusing you can see it's out of focus i think that's good i think i got it okay okay i'm really gonna get started now sorry about that okay here we go and the audio is still working here we go hello in this video i'm going to look at create capture in p5.js and how the create capture function allows you to get a live image from your webcam so i want to talk briefly just about what the createcapture function does technically behind the scenes um before i start typing to the code and seeing the results so let's come with me over here look i'm over here now hello so um as you know a p5 i don't know if you know this but you've watched any other videos you do p5 has these functions setup and draw setup being the thing that runs at the beginning of a p5.js sketch and the thing that you typically have in a p5.js sketch is a function called createcanvas this is not necessarily required which gets a width and a height and what does that function do it places a canvas in the browser window itself so the goal for this video by the end of this video is to say you know your laptop which has a like a webcam at the top i want to see the image you know from that webcam i want to see that in the canvas so the way that you can connect to the default camera of your computer and anybody's computer happens to be loading your sketch in their browser is with the function create capture so the create capture function and then you pass it one argument video what the create capture function does is it creates a connection to like i think it's called in web language like user get media something like that but what what it does behind the scenes is it actually creates a separate dom element dom referring to document object model this being the document there being objects in the document the one thing we created is a canvas as you know in p5 you can also create things like a paragraph with create p you could create things like a slider with create slider you could create button with create button so you can make all these elements that live on the web page and create capture actually what it does is creates a video dom element which contains the image from that camera so on the one hand this might be what you want you want to have a canvas and a video element separate from each other but in a sort of classic creative coding sense whatever whatever that means you might just want to be doing some kind of animation or abstract visual art thingamabob based on what's in that video so you don't actually want to see that dom element you just want to paint it to the canvas and mess with it on the canvas so that's what i need to look at how to do with code um and and and we'll see in a second but i think it's important to point out that create capture is actually part of the p5 dom library and actually creates a separate element on the page and so let's go look at that okay so here i am back over here and i've got a sketch i'm working just in sublime text today running a local server and looking at the results in the chrome browser if you don't know how to do that i made a separate video that i will link to that shows how to get that setup going but you can use any any web editor thing of your choice to do all of this so what i'm going to do is i'm going to say create capture and pass in the argument video so i'm adding that to my code i'm going to go over to the browser and i'm going to hit refresh and you can see now there it is the canvas is there and the capture is there now what is the resolution of this capture make it a little smaller you can see that this capture looks bigger than the canvas it's actually made my canvas 320x240 the capture the video is 640x480 that only i guess happens to be whatever default resolution the browser the camera who knows making who's making that decision but that's what you're getting now if i wanted to change the size of this element it's a dom element so i can use for example the p5 function size ah but how do i do that so what if i want to now manipulate what if i want to manipulate sorry i lost my train of thought for a second what if i want to manipulate the the capture element itself i need to store a reference to it in a variable so what i'm going to do is add a variable to the top i'll call it video i will say video equals create capture i could have called it anything cam capture whatever and i can now also say video dot size 320 by 240. so now what i've done is i've created that connection it made that dom element and i've sized it down and you can see here and you can see now i have on my web page i have the canvas and the video hooray so now we can start to do some more things i said what if i want to ultimately not see this separate image but actually paint into the canvas so i can do other stuff on top of it well one of the nice things about working in p5 is p5 has already set up the landscape of things for you so that this video dom element can act just like any other image would act in p5 so for example in draw if i just say i didn't set up my settings correctly if i just say image my sublime settings i'll do that later video i like to have two spaces for the indent you know it's very important to me my life feels very out of control if my indentation isn't working correctly the way that i like it i'll take a deep breath move on okay so if i say image video dot zero zero um um and i do that and now i hit refresh we can see there it is so i've got now i've got the actual video dom element and i have the canvas where i'm drawing the video onto the canvas but you can see i can do things like now with the canvas i can add other functions like tint you know i could make it very uh let's see what happens if i get kind of pinkish we can see here oh you know what interesting ah so a little bug happened i'm gonna fix this bug uh and it's actually there's already a github issue file so by the time you run this with your p5 in the future this won't happen to you i'm gonna just fix it by um by enforcing the size here but what happened is uh when i added tint the pixels got manipulated and suddenly it went back to 640 by 480 even though it shouldn't that shouldn't have happened so this video is gonna have a historical error in it which will get fixed but i in my code i was able to fix it by just enforcing the size that i'm drawing the image so you can see that in the canvas i can do various things to manipulate the image itself and while i was altering the size i might as well see i could do something like ah let me make mouse x the width and now you can see i have this video that i can kind of like shrink and make myself kind of like skinny or wider or a little bit skinnier and you can see i'm not drawing the background so i'm getting these weird trails so anything that you can do with images shapes i could add translate i could add rotate i could spin it i could shrink it i can flip it all of those types of things i can do with the video and if i it's nice to have this dom element as a reference of what the original video looks like but if i didn't want to have that one thing i'll show you is i could add video.hide so the hide function hides a particular dom element and if i hit refresh you can now see that the only thing is the canvas and the video so that concludes what i originally set out as the goal which was to be able to capture video from the camera and draw into the canvas however i must alert you to something that will trip you up i should probably should have led with this and not finished with it notice how it didn't ask me for permission it didn't say like oh can i have access to your camera is that okay what you are doing if you took this sketch and uploaded it to your website potentially if somebody came to your website it could automatically turn on their camera you could take pictures of them and save that to your server so typically speaking what you're the user is going to see is like oh can i have access to the camera but some browsers in particular the chrome browser will only actually let you do this if you are serving your website from what's known as https the s being secure so if you ever go to the address bar in your browser it'll sometimes say http and it'll sometimes say https if you're like on your bank's website it's i hope it says https because you need a level of encryption and security there so depending on where you're uploading your thing if you're just working locally on your own computer and making whatever and experimenting it's always going to work but if you're uploading it to your own website you need to have https enabled some web servers might have this as a feature for you like heroku i believe if you're using that that's a web service thing company others won't um and so you need to like purchase and get a certificate and maybe i can make a video about that if i even knew how to do that but one thing i'll point out that someone pointed to me recently is there is something called let's encrypt let's encrypt is free automated and open it's a new certificate authority so that might be something you could look into if you need to resolve this issue in terms of where you're uploading i do know for example though that github pages i believe if you're using github pages as a way of hosting something that i believe you can use https with anyway but also you could just not use chrome and it might work in a different browser yada yada yada this will all be irrelevant and i'm gonna have to dub the robots of the future will dub over me and explain this correctly because this is all gonna become totally not relevant anymore probably a week from now two weeks from now two months from now et cetera okay thanks for watching this video in the next video you know so i would say if you're looking for something to do try to get this to work mess around manipulate the video in the next video i'm going to show you how to save snapshots over time from a live source okay how was that everybody i'm going to look at the chat for a second uh somebody asks um does create capture work on mobile devices i i think it does on android but i do not think it does on ios so i think createcapture will work on android in the browser um again uh you know the https thing is an issue if because i think the android browser is like chrome based but pretty sure it does not work in ios and you probably probably would need some extra set of hooks to get the camera on ios um okay um yeah i interestingly enough someone makes the comment this is this is certainly one of the uh scenarios where uh doing this in p5 is actually quite a bit simpler than in the processing desktop environment the one thing you'll run into is as i show you the pixel processing stuff it's a lot slower in javascript than in processing so uh image processing iterating over all the pixels of an image is a very expensive thing to do computationally expensive thing to do and it runs pretty slow in javascript so you got to really work with low resolution images uh okay and let's see if anyone's asking anything on twitch um nope uh okay um all right so i'm gonna go on to my next topic i'm gonna take a break for a second and drink a little this coffee that i have over here i should i shouldn't be allowed to drink coffee it's been established but i'm going to anyway i think you could probably hear my like slurping and swallowing laura it's by the way it's a little bit strange just be in a room talking to yourself even though i know there are people watching and i'm making video tutorials and people seem to like them although i'm always unsure about that it's weird okay um so the next thing i'm gonna do is let me close this let me save let me make a new copy of this and i'm going to call it uh 02 photo booth so the next thing uh for those of you who might just be tuning in this is my list of stuff to do i did basic create capture the next thing i'm gonna do is show how to make i know photo booth i don't know if that's the right term because i'm not going to make a whole photo booth here but i'm going to look at how you can add an html5 button and every time you press the button you save a snapshot from the video and maybe you save a whole bunch of them in an array that sort of thing um so and that will actually lead to this huh muybridge style thing maybe i'll move that up but we'll see um yeah i wonder if i might add that into this video if i'm feeling ambitious so let me close this sketch go over here and oh you know what i'm going to do the other thing i'm going to do everyone is i'm gonna let me just mention this i made a whole video about this the other day um uh p5 uh so i'm gonna fix something in the p5 library secretly behind the scenes uh but this will get fixed eventually in the actual p5 library this was a github issue i filed and made a whole video about and it needs to be this in line 1679. of p5 dom so if i go in here and i go all the way down i'm just going to fix something i think it's here oops uh and the other thing i said i wanted to do is in the preferences ah so how does anybody know in sublime how i set it to um let's look at this for a second uh indentation uh uh oh translate tabs to spaces true and tab size two because that's i want spaces is there another four anywhere uh margin for no i think that must have done it so now if i do this ah yes yes okay my indentation is now okay and i'm going to do this and start from this there we go uh this can be maybe a little bit smaller over here because i'm gonna need this to be a little bit wider okay i think i'm ready for the next video i'm gonna check the chat um uh yes someone says i would appreciate a small tutorial about git oh be careful what you wish for i plan on making a very large tutorial about git um i'm hoping to do that next week actually uh i want to get one more couple more lights in here just to make the setup a little bit better because i feel like this is uh the get tutorials are kind of important it's not that i'm none of these important but i want to have them i want them to sort of last for a while and kind of look good and be good so um i'm going to do those next week i think once i get a little bit better at this setup in here let me just check here um okay so i'm going to erase this i'm going to do oh it's 11 o'clock i've got about another hour to see how much more i can get done in the next hour those of you who are staying with me are very kind keeps me motivated to see stuff in the chat and let me just cycle the cameras a little ritual thing that i do and here we go oh i also and the one thing i need to do is name that video i just made so that one i'm going to call uh oh one create capture okay and now here we go i need a tissue that's one thing i need is kleenex in this room i don't have okay here we go sorry i'm thinking do i have my um where'd i put my whiteboard marker oh here it is over here i need to have that in my hand okay hello in this video i'm going to look at how if you have a live capture live capture oh live capture if you have a live capture coming in from a camera that was uh no one wants to see me do that too much okay let's start over hello in this video i'm going to look at how if you have a live capture coming in from a camera into a web page how you can add a button to that page and save snapshots over time a photo booth like kind of sketch and i'm using p5.js so this is where i'm starting i have a simple uh p5 example which has a canvas which is here it has a video dom element over here the dom element is grabbing the image from the camera and then i'm drawing it into the canvas so let's go over to the code and i've got the code here you can see that create capture video change the size of 320 by 240 and draw that onto the canvas so first thing i want to do is just stop drawing it onto the canvas and we can see this is what i've got now and i want to add a button to the page so i'm going to say create button snap and if i refresh it you can see there's that button we make this a little bit bigger and you can see there's that button snap so the idea here is that i want is whenever i hit the button i want that image to be saved and populated into the canvas so how do we do that so the first thing i need to do is bind some sort of event to the pressing of this button and the way that that's done in p5 is with well first of all once again if i want to do anything with that button i now need a variable to keep track of that button over time so i'm going to add a variable called button at the top and i'm going to say button equals create button and then i will say button dot mouse pressed and i'll call this uh take snap so what goes in here is the name of a function that i want to execute when i press the mouse on that button and this is p5 specific there are lots of ways in javascript with other frameworks and native javascript and jquery to do this same sort of thing but in p5 has a nice simple hook for binding an event to the press of the mouse which is naming a function that goes into the mouse press function that's that's called on the button object itself so once i've done that it's now my job to write a function called take snap and in that function what could i do i could take exactly this line of code that just draws what is currently in the video to the canvas so if i save this and i go back and run this again we should see now that the video is playing video is capturing there's nothing in the canvas but you can see that as soon as i hit that button i get the current image into the canvas and now i can do this and you can see i can kind of create a little like stopmotion dance animation so we can make a gif out of this if they want i don't know what i'm doing anymore i got lost in my own little world there for a second we turn off the video and just dance the night away even though it's 11 o'clock in the morning which is not really the morning i digress um so let's try to make this though a little bit more interesting here which is that i didn't really save anything i don't know what it means to save anything certainly i could like download the image to the computer ah we could add that actually that could be a feature we could add um but what i think might be interesting to look at is how might i save those images over time so since i have this white board over here i feel obligated to use it let's think about this for a second i need to sort of map this out for myself so we have the canvas we have the video and the only thing that i'm doing is at particular moments in time i'm drawing you know the image from the video to the canvas but what if i could do something in the interim over here and the thing that i want to do is actually call the function get so get is a function that uh maybe i'll get to a little more later which is a way of like grabbing pixels from the image itself but if i call get with no arguments what it does is it grabs an entire copy of that image so what if i had a uh an array i called it history so a blank array like this and every time i press a button i add a copy of the image to that array so i'm actually storing image after image after image whenever that button is pressed that way i could potentially in my canvas i could see a whole bunch of images snapshots over time so let's take a look at how we might do that okay uh so let's go back to the code what are some things i want to add the first thing i want to add and audio is still working is a variable called history which will just be an array so an empty array and now i said instead of um instead of right here just drawing the image drawing the image to the screen when the button is pressed what i want to do instead is say something like this history.push video push being a function history is an array video is the video dom element push being a function that adds something to that array so i want to add the video dom element add the video dom element every time i press the button only that's not what i want to do so this looks kind of right like oh every time i press the button add you know the image from the video to the array but this the variable video is not the image it's the entirety of that dom element live capture stream thing itself so that's not what i want in the array what i want is just a copy of that image so i need to use that get function so if i come back over here and i say video dot get this is what i want so and you know i can run this right now oh history.push is not a function why is that not a function yes it is uh is is history some other um variable name for something let's call this uh snapshots is is something else called history in the world of javascript yeah that's strange somebody will tell me what that was so sometimes if you get that error you know this is by the way i made a video about name spacing i'll link to it now but something you can walk into by accident which apparently i just did in javascript especially working with p5 is i'm making up all these like global variables and there's a lot of default stuff yeah history browser history i'm sure there's a global variable that just exists in web browsers called history that has to do with the browser history and i just messed up by overriding that so watch out danger danger don't do that so i'll call it snapshots and what i want to do now is we can look at here snapshots is an empty array so this is the chrome developer console i recently made a video about how to use that and now if i hit snap a couple times and look at snapshots again you can see that now it has an array with a bunch of p5 images in it and there's more stuff with these p5 images that we can kind of look into the width and the height and all of that but let's not worry about that right now now how can i do something with these images well one thing i could do let's um let's do one thing with it let's make the canvas uh wider and in draw let's add a loop that says four var i equals zero i is less than snapshots dot length i plus plus let's draw image snapshots index i let's draw all of those images so this is going to i don't know what this is really going to accomplish but let's run this and you can see now it's only showing the last one why is it i did a loop to draw every single one it's only showing the last one well it's drawing them all but it's drawing them all on top of each other so one thing i could do that would be kind of interesting i have no idea if this is going to work is i could add some alpha so look at that now you can see that it's drawing them all and i'm getting a nice little ghost averaging thing i gotta um because i'm tinting them as i'm drawing them let's draw them next to each other so one thing i might want to do is draw them a lot smaller like maybe i'll just draw them at 80 by 60 and maybe i'll actually make that a variable uh 80 and 60 and use those variables and i'll say let me have an x and a y so what i'm doing here is i want to draw each image at a particular x and a y as i'm looping through the array the first one is 0 0 the second one at x equals x plus w so now what you would see is you can see here that each one is drawing next to each other now when it gets to the edge of the window which is over here maybe what i wanted to do if x is greater than w then i want to reset x back to zero and have y go up by h so i'm just making a little algorithm inside this loop that no matter how many images there are they're each being drawn x is moving over when x gets the end x goes back to zero and y goes down so now i can run this and we should see here's the video down here and i can oh what happened there if x is greater than w that's not correct if x is greater than the width of the canvas not w which is just one over so that's no good so let's run this again and then i'm gonna you can see my little uh kind of stop motion muay bridge sequence now incidentally it's kind of funny that i'm doing this by like pressing the button because i could just as easily do this so so anyway so you get the idea here there's a lot of possibilities i have this whole array i can mix and match them i could create a puzzle i could chop it up i mean my mind is bursting with ideas and i hope yours is as well but and you can see also like that the i don't know if you can see this in this recording in the video but the program is running a bit slower now i have this big array of images but um uh but i wanted to do one more thing which what i want to do let's this is a little bit insane you should just stop watching this now but i want to see if i can make these be in motion so i want to see just sort of like the last however many images and i want them all to be on a delay and moving let's just see if we can do this i'm 10 minutes into this video you can think of this as completing the lesson but let's just see if we can make this happen so let's think about this for a second um what i might want to do is uh first what happens if i just put this in draw itself uh okay so i'm saying push video dot get and uh let's and let's let's let's run this for a second and count it and i'm going to run this for a second but we complained so one thing that happened is that the video a draw happens immediately but the video wasn't actually ready just yet so i need oh sad sad world we live in what i need is an event i wonder if i can add an event here called ready and i make a variable called go equals false and now i'm going to set go so i think there should be a callback to create i don't know if this exists in p5 we're about to find out there should be most of these functions in javascript have a callback like create the capture and you know but it's not what i need to know when you're done creating it so i could use it and so i passed a call back called ready and i'm just going to set a boolean variable equal to true so i can say only if go then start capturing those snapshots and i can take this out here as i've gotten rid of the button and i'm gonna have to we don't need this button anymore yeah that worked so you can see what's happening here so now let me pause this uh let me say no loop so i need to do something ridiculous which is count this one two three four five six seven eight nine ten times four there are forty so i need an array with 40. so i only want to what i want to do is actually i want to change and have a counter so i want to create a counter because i don't want to i only want to have 40 images at a time so what i would want to do is add a counter so instead of just always adding an image to the array what i want to say is snapshots index counter equals video.get so this is going to do the same exact thing i'm going to be i'm going to add images to that array i'm going to run this again counter equals zero why didn't that work somebody let's see what this error is sketch.4 i have a syntax error oh int boy my land isn't my mind is in java land var should be the name of the variable so i'm going to do this and we can see ah so it's working but i didn't increase the counter so i need to say counter plus plus and now you can see this is working now what i could do is say aha when counter gets to 40 go back to zero so now i can say if counter equals 40 because there's only 40 total counter should go back to zero okay so now this is a good time to do jumping jacks i have to do them over here right you can see my trail of jumping jacks is happening up here you know there are maybe like a second space depart you can see it's still doing it do i still have that tint in there that's funny i still have the tint let's get rid of that and refresh i forgot that i had that the whole time no wonder this is what i expected it to look like i'll do some jumping jacks so you can see now i don't i don't know why the bottom maybe i did my math wrong maybe they're 43 did i get the math wrong there uh counter equals 43 let's try that uh you know i obviously could do some actual correct math there we go so now you can see i've got this like history of the last 43 images always continuously there but i want to do something a little bit weird so this is pretty good and i think you could probably make some creative experiments with this and make it bigger or smaller or whatever but and i'm just like off the deep end here but only at 15 minutes so this is fine so let's think about how to make this notice that i'm always just drawing the images 0 through 243 and let's make that i don't know why that's the val let's make this total equal 40. let's make that a variable i swear i don't understand my math here but i'm just going to go with it so one thing i want to do is that in addition to drawing the images i want to offset them this is going to like seem weird but let me let me just do this and maybe it's going to make sense it's making sense in my head right now because i think i've done this before many years ago but i'm going to what if i said i plus frame count so in other words i want the zero image to be here then the zero image to be there then the zero image to be there every frame but as soon as we get past 43 i need to use the modulus operation boy modulus might not be familiar to some of you i believe i made a video only about modulus at one point and so let's make this a separate variable just so we can kind of discuss what's going on here pretty sure this is going to work so let me run this see if this does what i expect oop uh i have an error oh so i must have got oh so first of all i can only do this once counter has got i need i need 40 images first to start with so uh so this is only going to work once 43 or whatever once i have the total amount so this one um so i want to think of like a really simple way to approach this um i'm just going to say if if oh you know what i don't never mind i this is silly all i need to do is say snapshots.length because i can just do this based on how many elements are currently in the array so now you can see that ah that's what i was hoping for okay so you can see that everything's moving now why did this work i mean i um so this is uh this is a pretty standard kind of like trope i would say in kind of creative coding uh looking at this video and seeing like many many copies of it on a slight delay we can make that delay big or smaller we could kind of cycle it around i made a project like 10 years ago that does exactly this i think i called it time frame um and i i just have to do like my some weird like vogue dancing i think to see what this looks like this video is still recording okay um um but let's try to think about why this is working for a second and again you know i don't know if anyone's still watching this video like 20 minutes in but i hope that you make some creative projects with this um you might run into an issue by the way if you don't have that p5.js bug fixed but i can help you with that but let's think about this so remember this is the array and let's just uh pretend the array has one two three four five things in it and uh you know the animation looks something like this i was supposed to be me with one arm so you can see like the of an animation of a dial going like this so this is the canvas and this is continuously also shifting and getting new elements in it but what's happening is so the current the actual current frame is is going in one at a time so without that strange modulus i don't really try to make this make sense i don't know that this is the best drawing but without that modulus what i was seeing here is just literally the array copied into the window so we see these static images that are getting updated every once in a while but if what i'm doing is actually the zero element of the array gets drawn here then it gets drawn here then it gets drawn here then it gets drawn here you're actually seeing and the one element is also moving you're actually seeing that animation that's in the array play out because each spot on the screen that's static is seeing different elements from the array but the array is also being updated by the current elements from the camera and so how is that working basically uh what i want this is gonna i now i know how to make sense of this right i'm gonna put the index values here so first the index values go like this then the next time the index values go like this and then the next time oops i only have four here i messed up but you get the idea they go like this so then the next time it's three four zero one one two so those are cycling so how do you do that if you always have if you have that loop this is uh i so okay sorry this is i zero one two three this is i plus frame count which would be zero one two three and then one two three four then two three four five then three four five six right so this is i plus frame count the modulus operation if i was saying this i'm using my hand terrible i didn't go wash my hands in a second if i am saying now i plus frame count modulus 4 the modulus operation is like division but not like division it's the remainder of division so if i say for example three modulus four three modulus four is the three divided by four is zero remainder one four divided by four is one remainder zero five divided by four oh sorry zero divided by three sorry three divided by four at is zero remainder three five modulus four is one remainder one six divided by four is one remainder two so what the modulus operation does is it cycles everything back between to keep everything within the original range of the array boy i gotta re this video was going so well until i went off and did this but hopefully you found this interesting i'm gonna publish the code with this as i upload this video and i hope that you guys will make some experiments with this particular idea and share them so i can see what you made okay uh i'm gonna hit stop now i gotta i gotta come back to that that you know someday i i should just do this again it'll make more sense but i did my best okay um ah so somebody's saying the first three rows had 11 images one was off the right side thank you very much um okay i see there's uh look i'm just looking at the comments here boy and i'm gonna look on twitch um and this is live it is um okay yeah so somebody's i think there's some new people finding this uh stream on twitch which was sort of maybe one or two people this is live but i'm tending not to look at the chat except for at particular moments because ultimately i'm gonna record these and upload them to youtube as standalone videos um okay so um let me look back here this was my so i actually ended up doing this in this particular video i kind of want to like do that over again and like separate that out and not go so far off into this wilderness here because i but can you guys give me a little feedback was that kind of a total disaster or it kind of made sense trying to explain how the array thing worked i don't know i definitely think if i did it again i have a better sense of how to make it make sense but um okay so the next thing i would start doing would be the pixel array stuff um uh oh yeah so i guess i confirmed that it's live that i'm reading the chat responding to it uh although there is a delay so i think you're probably seeing this about 20 seconds after i'm actually doing it so sometimes the chat is a little bit behind oh i need to plug this computer in and can you apply the chroma key so someone asked can you apply the chroma key in real time so i'm actually as you can see i'm recording this you can see that i'm recording this video from a camera over there this is the camera that's actually recording that's chroma keying the back the desktop of my laptop with me but because i'm using the webcam for my laptop you're also seeing another view which is this one now i think the question asks could you use p5 to live chroma key the video and the answer is absolutely yes and this is actually part of the next topic i want to explore which is how to manipulate the pixels and um so you could do it manually by manipulating the pixels and if the pixel is green you know draw a different pixel but there is a javascript library that allows you to do this called seriously.js and you can see that um so you can see this is doing live chroma keying and various effects of a particular video and then uh you can see that's the green screen thing that it's crunching okay so um so you could look into using that and uh that would be a great why not add that seriously.js with p5 let's see if we can make that a topic um okay what time is it 11 20. uh and um so um okay so somebody is asking and i'm gonna i'm gonna just take a minute to answer some of the questions of people arriving so someone's uh so two things one is saying could you show sublime text again so let me do that so first of all the code for all these videos sometimes takes me a little while what happens with these videos after i finish this later this afternoon or this evening i will upload them as standalone videos to my youtube channel and then in the description i usually put a link to the source code that goes with the video so you'll be able to find all this later if the source code is missing all you need to do is type in the video's comments it's missing it reminds me then i post it um and if you're looking for what that repo is uh a github.com shiffman video dash lesson dash materials so this is the url you can see it up here and under uh code p5.js you can see these are like code examples that have gone along with all these other videos that i've previously made now the other question has been asked on twitch i make i came in a little after you started could you briefly re touch what p5.js j is j oh my god could you talk about what p5.js is and what it accomplishes so um very briefly p5.js is a javascript library um you don't all the things that i'm showing you you could do without p5.js but p5.js has a lot of functionality built into it to make drawing to an html5 canvas a little bit easier to make connecting to live video streams a little easier to add buttons and interface elements a little bit easier easier might be the wrong word but um but it's just a javascript library for what i would call loosely creative coding for to be able to kind of sketch and play around and make kind of experiments in a web browser there's a lot more to it in the history of it and there's something called processing i encourage you to go to p5js.org to learn a little bit more okay um so the next topic i want to explore i have to i have to think about the order of this so i think what i want to do is do a video just about the pixel array and manipulating the pixels of an image of a p5.js sketch using the live video let me actually let's make an example before i do the tutorial just to get a sense that this is actually working so i'm gonna do a little prep now even though well i like i'm having this here it's kind of crazy i can do like this is kind of interesting to see okay i have to stop playing with this though i'm gonna close this sketch and uh i'm going to make a copy of it actually let me start with uh make a copy of it and whoops uh p5.js video call this 03 pixels so and then i want to close this 03 pixels let's get rid of all this and go down here okay so what i want to do sorry everybody what i what i want to do is just test to see that pixel stuff is working in p5 so i'm going to call load pixels camera's going to go off in a second i'll fix it i'm going to call update pixels so right now what i'm doing is i'm making the example that i will then make a tutorial about just to like get my head in the game here and figure out make sure this stuff works uh so i'm gonna say x equals zero x is less than uh with x plus plus uh so i'm doing a nested loop to look at every single pixel and i'm going to say pixels index i equals so i'm doing something here bear with me for a second the pixels in p5 and html5 canvas work differently than they do in processing so if you're coming from processing if you're not coming from anything you won't care that this is different because it'll all be new to you and let's see if this actually works oops i lost chrome oops that's the wrong thing that's terminal where's chrome did i close it no no localhost pixels error i is not defined yeah no kidding i is not defined uh x plus y times width okay did something wrong ah right of course and then times four see i'm forgetting this stuff because it works differently in p5 there we go what ah another thing is pixel density one okay it'll give me that annoying warning um and i'm gonna now try this see how the frame rate is all right promising okay so this is the first thing that i want to explore which is just how to manipulate and play with the pixel array in p5 uh and then what i'll do is actually get the pixels from the i'll put the capture next to it and get the pixels from capture uh and do more with that sort of thing so let's see um uh oh somebody is telling me to check out william cheer or keir um okay and uh yeah uh yeah i like how you guys um see my errors before i see them it's very it's very fun okay so i'm gonna now in the chat let me know how the whiteboard is you can read it and see it it's not the best lighting but it's like legible and all that um okay so because i'm going to erase this now and so this video is going to just be about the pixel array in p5.js which is also about the pixel array in html5 canvas and i'm going to start by diagramming out how it works and then i'm going to write some code for it and then i will transition out to the next video which looks at actually reading the pixels from the my the camera itself it's fine it's fine thank you everybody uh okay um here we go guacamole sayonara chicken i don't know what i'm just saying words now okay all right i'm gonna drink a little coffee i have to announce that because if i don't you guys are going to wonder why do i walk off camera and make weird slurping sounds because i feel like the mic must pick that up okay um here we go ah so let me just do something here background do one oops nope okay uh great okay here we go you know what i want to check actually is i want to just check oh low battery so this is not good i need to um this one has two bars so i think that one's fine i want to replace the batteries just so you guys know what i'm i'm going to replace the battery on this because i really would hate for the battery to die in the middle of making the video so i'm going to be i'm about to mute myself and get new batteries be right back actually i haven't muted myself yet i have to find the batteries i had them out in a specific spot i don't know what happened to them oh here they are thank goodness i'm about to take the batteries out i don't know if that's gonna i'm gonna hit mute and hopefully you won't suddenly get weird like noise but maybe turn your volume down for a second so your headphones don't pop if anything weird happens i'll be back in 30 seconds okay i am back i think i'm back and the batteries are replaced so we aren't in danger of running out of battery okay all i can think about now is all the weird gifts i'm going to make of myself later i have to admit like somebody made one for me and then i was like oh that's interesting i'm gonna go see if i can make one myself and now i want to pretend that other people are making them but really it's just me making them because i'm the most vain person broadcasting creative coding tutorials on youtube and twitch okay just checking make sure everything's okay the audio looks like it's still fine somebody tell me if it's not it does release a fire hose of static okay that's good to know thank you um i you know what i should do is i should mute my control panel oh the other thing i really need to do is i need to get a sound board in here because i would like to be able to have some music get some like sound audio from the computer you have some intro music i'm thinking about using i'm totally serious here so if anybody has any ideas if like a simple little mixing board i can get or something send me a tweet good way to do that with them using wirecast in particular um okay uh oh you can't hear me right now but i think that's from earlier all right uh you guys can hear me now right so say i'm clapping say i can hear you clapping somebody say i can hear you clapping and i'll wait yes exactly like reading rainbow but the coding rainbow i actually have a friend in la who is a music composer for television and film and uh this reminds me i need to send him an email to ask he was going to help make a song you can hear me clapping okay so i'm going to go and make this video and i'm going to minimize this i'm not looking at the chat now talk amongst yourselves i'm going to cycle these cameras and i'm going to make a video about how the pixel array works in p5 here we go here we go here we go here we go you know i don't know what to say at the beginning of these videos i always just say hello in this video i will but that's what i'm going to say at this one i'm not going to include that in this video okay oh you know what i forgot to do i like to name i need to name that one that i just made so the one that i just made was uh o2 photo history okay so i named that now i can close this this one will be a pixel array in this video and this is why i need the theme music hello and welcome to another video tutorial right hello today right now this very moment i'm going to talk about the pixel array pixel array uh in p5.js which is really really i'm talking about the pixel array in html5 canvas meaning there is a canvas in a browser i am programming what's going to be on that canvas in javascript and i want to know how do i access each individual pixel of the canvas and how do i manipulate and change the color of each individual pixel for whatever purposes my mind can imagine and this will lead to um how to get live images from a camera load images from some api or from a file and manipulate the pixels of some other image from some other source so that i'll get to in the next video but right now i just want to look at how does the pixel array work so let's uh come over here to the whiteboard for a second and kind of discuss what's at play here so here is what i'm calling the canvas so canvas image whatever you want to think about it a pix an image on a computer is a rectangular thing which is essentially a grid of pixels so we can make a sort of simplified think of a simplified low resolution one two three four five six like see this has a width of six one two three four five and a height of five so i now have an image that's six by five meaning there are 30 pixels total or 6 times 5. i hope i did the math right okay so in order to access these but now p5 has functions called get and set and these functions are useful get or set you can pass an x and a y the numbers being starting with zero so the x values go from zero one two three four five or zero one two three 4 and you could say get pixel 4 comma 2 which would be this pixel right over here so you can use those functions and i might in some of the examples but i want to look at a different way of accessing the pixels which is arguably going to at least be the speediest and allow for the most possibilities i don't know if that's entirely true but let's just take that for now and so what that is is what i'm referring to is something called the pixels array so behind the scenes in p5 there's a very long array we have lots of numbers in it those numbers correspond to all of the colors in this canvas so the question that we have to figure out is if i want to change the color for this particular pixel how do i find where in this array to do that and so to do that we need to do we need to do a little bit of math because this is just a linear list uh onedimensional list array and but the the the image we'll think of as this twodimensional thing so how do we go back and forth between the two of them now this is not some unique problem it happens in any computer graphics environment but there is something different at least if you've used processing before um just to take that as an example the way that the pixels work in p5.js html5 canvas is quite different than in processing that's quite similar but there's a big sort of major fundamental difference and you will see that as i go through this so let's look at this now so let's just start let me start by telling you that the pixels in the array if this is the array right i'm going to give myself a bunch of spots here the pixel start like this pixel the very first thing index 0 in the array refers to this particular pixel here but it doesn't refer to the entire pixel it just refers to the red value of that pixel some number between 0 and 255. the second element index number 1 in the array refers to the green value for that particular pixel the third element or index number two refers to the blue value and the fourth element or index number three refers to the alpha value so it takes four spots of the array for one pixel now remember i said there are 60 pixels that means how long is this array six times four the length of the array is 240. so for an image that is six by four that has sorry six by five that has 60 pixels the array itself has four times that many spots because there's a red green blue and alpha value for each spot meaning the length of the array is 240. okay so that we've established now still so you can think about this is the this pixel starts at spot zero this pixel starts at spot and by i should stop saying spot it should say index starts at index four this one at index eight this one index 12 this one index 16. so this is how each each pixel's color values in the array are four are separated by four index values so that's the first thing to establish now let's not think about that for a second and let's just think so that that we've established now i'm going to erase this and back up again for a second let's say i want to just though number the pixels like this 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 and this is our important one 16 17 16. so one thing that you'll notice here if i'm numbering the pixels this way is that the first row is zero through five the second row is zero through five plus six right zero plus six is six six plus six is twelve one plus six six seven seven plus six is 13. so if i know the x y coordinate on the screen something like the coordinate 4 times 2 i can get that number 16 by saying x plus y times width or 4 plus 2 times 6 or 4 plus 12 which equals 16. so this is the formula for getting the numeric the number pixel it is on the screen now then i have to say where is it in the array remember the array actually went 0 4 8 12 whoa right yeah 0 4 8 12 16. so then all i need to do is multiply this by four so the way that i can find where the color values for a given pixel are in the array is the x value the x coordinate plus the y coordinate times the width and this whole thing times four so you might need to diagram this out yourself get a piece of graph paper review it a few times but ultimately this formula you can just memorize it you're going to see it in every almost every example i make right now so let's go back to the code itself and i gotta wake up my computer wake up computer and now i can go to my code so now all i want to do that first is deal with the pixels of the canvas itself one thing you have to do if you're going to deal with the pixel of the canvas is alert p5 javascript the browser i don't know who we're talking to here but you've got to tell somebody hey i want to work with the pixels so the way to do that is by saying load pixels and i'm going to put this in draw so the first thing i need to do is say load pixels now i can do anything i want i can say pixels index 365. you know equals 255. now i don't know what this is going to do and then ah if i ever change the pixels i need to say hey i'm done changing the pixels let me now say update pixels so i have messed with the pixel array and if i went back and i loaded it we should see uh some pixel got some value somewhere the truth of the matter is i'm not gonna be able to find that pixel i have no idea 365 was that the red part the green part the alpha part so ultimately we're not going to see anything so let's be a bit more methodical about this let's try to change just the first pixel in the top left corner so we know that's the red value green value blue value we need a red green a green value a blue value and an alpha those should be the first four so that top left pixel should be white let's zoom all the way in there ah you can see that look at that do you see that white pixel up there in the top left are we sure about that let's let's move it over let's say four five six seven oh you can see it moved over right can you see that pixel i changed a little bit moved over right are we really sure about this let's and you know what i could do actually why am i even bothering i could just say oh no i have to say a load pistol i could make this zero refresh look at it now i got my pink pixel we made a pink pixel whose giant mouse pointer pointing to it today is a beautiful moment right because if you know how to individually address every single pixel in a canvas there is nothing you can't possibly draw you're mad the world is now your oyster i mean you know you want to have a 3d library for doing all that kind of stuff probably you're not going to do it by pixel by pixel but there's a lot of possibilities this opens up so we see the basics at play here but what i want to do is now let me look at how i might actually address every single pixel so how might i do that so you know if you're watching this video hopefully you're aware of the idea of something called a for loop and we can see this particular for loop is a loop that's saying for every x have x go from have a variable called x and have x cycle 0 1 2 3 4 5. and what do i want to do for every x i want to actually maybe i want to do it the reverse i want to say like 4 the first row which is y do every x then for the second one do every x then for the third one do every x so i need a loop that's going through the y's as well and this is what's known as a nested loop you may have seen this in other things so so if i say this and i add another bracket and then i need to put indent these a little bit we can now look at this and we can say aha this is a loop that's saying for every y value start at y value 0 go through all the x's now have y equal 1 go through the all the x's now have y equal 2 go through all the x's so this nested loop has the property of hitting every single x and y in the window so now we should be able to apply our formula var index equals do we remember this x plus y times width times four x plus y times width this whole thing times four and now i should be able to take this and put this here indent it properly and say index index plus one right the index that value is the red value of every pixel one is the green the next one is the blue the next one is the alpha so index index plus ah plus two index plus three and you know i might just for like symmetry here add the plus zero there i don't know if that's necessary but you can see this is the chunk i need the index is the start of the pixel and there are four values associated with the pixel now there's something that's going to happen which is going to cause this not to work which i'll get to in a second but this is this is essentially the right code i missed a small little piece only because i'm using a retina laptop which i'll get to in a second so if i hit refresh here we can say ah weird it worked but i didn't get the whole canvas like i got this like stripe of pink across the top so unfortunately we live in a world now or fortunately where we have these like hd pi hp high definition display high pixel density hot pixel density so mac retina displays other types of high density displays actually have like four pixels for every quoteunquote pixel to make things finer and more higher resolution and so if this is actually what you're seeing here is a view of a high density display and so one thing i want to do just in people i could get into this and i could draw the pixels at higher density to do all sorts of stuff but something i could do in p5 just to like turn this problem off is say pixel density one so what i'm saying that is like i don't care what kind of display the user is on i don't i want the canvas to be one pixel per pixel kind of regular density display as they were a year many years ago in olden times so if i do that we should see there we go and you know it's giving me some sort of like warning that image smoothing enabled it's changed something and we can kind of ignore that in the console but you can see i have now essentially written the code for the background function right the p5 background function you know does exactly this it you give it a color like 255 comma 0 comma 255 and it fills the entire background with those pixels but i can do all sorts of things now like i could say i could say x right and y i don't know what this is going to do and i could hit and run this you could see now i have this kind of like gradient right because the amount of red increases as the pixels move to the right the amount of blue increases as the pixels move down it mixes in the center i could then also say like make the green value a random value and now we've got this like snowy rainbow noise ah the rainbow yay whenever something happens that's rainbow like in a it makes me happy and i feel glad about it so this really concludes this particular video i would say to you try to get this set up see what kind of magic pixel pixel wonderland you can make for yourself and what i'm going to do in the next video is take this concept and actually not just make up pixel colors out of thin air but actually pull pixels from an image this being a live a video source and manipulate them or draw something else based on those colors so i hope you enjoyed this video it was 14 minutes and 46 seconds long and share with me in the comments if you make something and post it somewhere i would love to see what it is okay everyone uh that was another video i'm wondering i think i actually unfortunately have to take a break now uh so there are some i'm gonna look at some of the questions now people have uh posted interesting questions um boy there's a lot of chat going on here i'm not sure okay hello um so someone says it's a bit daunting it appears that you need to know javascript inside out as well as processing to do all these cool features you're right in the sense that what i'm doing right now is kind of you know 15 20 tutorials in the this this particular tutorial assumes you know javascript it assumes you know the sort of basics of how an environment like p5 or processing works um but certainly um you can go back and watch some of my early tutorials which will like kind of cover all those basics before diving right in um uh okay uh okay there's people having a discussion about this yes some people ask about i did do a whole set of videos about just html css and p5 dom that'll help fill in some of these gaps there's a really interesting point here the gankable player on twitch writes so so uh he or she is asking about um um the gankable players asking okay so why instead of having at each of these spots a red green and blue and alpha values separate spots why not just have the array itself have some sort of color object right so the index values are zero and one and there's an object here that has like a red green blue and alpha element of the object so i would say that that's a totally reasonable interesting idea and if i were making up a pixelbased library framework from scratch i might do it that way and p5 certainly could do it that way however native html5 javascript the way it works is uh not this way it's with having rgb alpha as separate elements maybe there's a speed or efficiency issue there and so i think it for p5 to kind of work in the same way is a sort of is good in that you're not if you're kind of moving back between native javascript and canvas and using some p5 stuff it's not going to be different so i think kind of like building a layer that allows you easier quicker access to the pixels but not change the way the pixels are organized is kind of a good compromise i think okay let me come back over here see if there are other questions performance issue yeah um so um so one thing i'll say um the gang gobble player also wrote um i'm thinking i'm not good enough for open source one thing that i think is really important to say about p5.js p5.js is an open and welcoming community to people of all ages of all genders of all backgrounds of all uh countries and of all skill levels so you should come on to p5 and file a github issue or check out the wikis participate in the open source community that a p5 is and not worry about whether you are at the right level or not um they're because one of the things about p5 is to really try to create as open and welcoming uh community in terms of p5 development and also i'll mention let me come over here and plug somebody else's videos which is luisa pereira am i pronouncing vimeo p5.js let me see if this is going to come up looking looking inside so um looking inside p5 is a video series that luisa pereira is making which is uh it's on vimeo it's a tutorial series but it's not about a programming tutorial it's a tutorial about how p5 as an open source project is organized for a beginner and how you could contribute and participate in that so i encourage you guys to check those videos out as well um okay so um so i'm what i'm gonna let you it's almost noon and i was gonna take a break at noon for a little bit um and i'm gonna come back let's let me i'm gonna answer more questions because uh if i can let me come back here and look at my list here so i got through this much so i want to do maybe these four topics later this afternoon see if i can get to them um um yeah so that's what's happening today now let me look at the chat okay so um uh kujun sherpa writes question is it reasonable to use processing to write android apps yes in fact it is not only reasonable it is encouraged processing there is actually um let me just launch processing for a second oh did i update to the most recent version um i'm going to launch this is processing if you're not familiar with it it's a creative coding environment built on top of java so for like desktop application development and you'll notice up here there's this little tab that says java and i you can also write your processing sketches in python if i change to python mode this wouldn't be there by default you've got to go to add mode and here's one that i don't have added i will add it right now see if this works hit install so i've now installed android mode and i can now switch to android mode oops i think i have to oh so this is telling me i also have to go and download the android s i have to click this so it's going to do a lot more downloading to download the android sdk but you can actually use processing itself to develop android apps it's designed to do that um and you know i would say that this it's in development there's you know there's probably a lot of things that work and some things that maybe don't work as well but if i look up if i google android processing the place where you should start is this particular wiki github.com processing slash processing dash android uh wiki and you'll see there are a whole lot of instructions and information for how to run on a device and get started and that sort of thing so i i you know i don't have a lot of experience using processing for android but i hope that you will look into it and contribute to the project if you find things um paul mcguire asks what are you using for your realtime chroma key i am using a um software called wirecast uh it's commercial software i use you know costs somewhere in the hundreds of dollars um uh but it has a lot of features for me it has a feature that allows me to take multiple camera feeds in as well and i've hooked up a like a button to like switch between them automatically it also allows you to like live broadcast to youtube or twitch or any of these things so that's what i'm using currently let me see if i have any important emails about my meeting at noon that might be pushed back in which case i might keep going uh i don't see anything about that okay so it looks like um let me look on twitter here for a second okay so that seems to be the last question where else is this being streamed so currently i haven't really decided i love feedback about this i have been doing all my streams on youtube so um you know just to like put some urls here for you guys currently i am youtube.com shiffman so and slash live is where the youtube live stream is that some of you are watching uh all uh later this sort of edited chunks of videos get uploaded as standalone chunks they appear on youtube i also started recently streaming to twitch dot tv slash coding rainbow to see how twitch worked as a technology to see if there was a different community there that might discover and enjoy the videos or live streams um so i don't know i'm you know i think i'm on a verizon fios connection here uh it seems to be streaming fine to both at the same time and recording got a mac pro doing all this but please if you notice like the stream is like having issues or the audio's cutting out that sort of thing please let me know these are the two places where i'm streaming at present so i think uh good lunch oh yeah so um somebody asked can i open two windows in one program i don't know exactly what you're referring to but i did recently make a video that's on my youtube channel about multiple canvases in the same p5 sketch using something called instance mode so if you go to my youtube channel and search instance mode shiffman on youtube i'm sure you'll find it um so i hope to be back at around 2 p.m eastern time stay tuned to my twitter i'm just plugging everything right now follow me at twitter.com shiffman uh i hope to be i think about a couple hours i have a meeting i'm going to grab some lunch i want to finish these videos i definitely won't be going any later than like 4 p.m or 4 30 p.m eastern time today so sometime between 2 p.m and 4 30 p.m um i will um come back live i also another just uh if you want to be able to sign up for alerts if you go to shiffman.net that's my website shiffman.net there is a email you can put your email in here to get updates the thing is i've said this every time now mailchimp has blocked me because i guess i sent my test email out incorrectly and they blocked me as a spammer so this i'm getting your email addresses but mailchimp isn't letting me send anything so i haven't sent out any of these updates yet but i do plan on doing so or maybe i'll just use something else besides mailchimp if somebody has an idea of a different service i should use i guess i could just make a google group actually i could just use a google group can i make a announce only google group be interesting it could be interesting to have a discussion group on google and let people actually but i don't know this is this is opening too many doors the processing forum if you're looking for a place to ask questions i try to answer them in the youtube comments but also the processing forum um okay let's see if there's any other questions uh oh a message box on top of the real sketch well i don't know if you're asking about processing or p5 um but um hello france uh bonjour or bolsoire i guess depending on it's like six o'clock in france probably um port du bois asked on top of the real sketch if you're talking about processing it is there is uh i think there's a library you can get for processing that allows you have two windows open if you're talking about a p5 sketch a web browser there's lots of different ways with html and css to overlay content on top of uh other content and i that would be a great i think i might have actually covered that in one of my p5 dom library videos i'll show you where that is if anyone wants to know if i can go to youtube.comshiffman and uh oh look it says i'm live now look at that 27 watching um if i go down to uh this one p5.js tutorial part two html css dom uh cover in the this video series all the sort of dom stuff to have different dom elements on top of stuff okay it's 6 p.m yeah uh uh okay i think that seems like all the comments for now so i'm gonna it's noon i think i i've been uh streaming for two hours uh i was uh watching this guy uh i think to run it up on twitch jason somerville was like a poker player he streams for like eight hours a day has like millions of followers i wondered if i like just came here and started streaming coding for eight eight hours a day i don't i don't know what would happen to me but that sounds like fun okay i'm gonna stop the stream uh tweet at me uh see you maybe later this afternoon it'll be late for the europe but uh more reasonable time for those of you maybe on the west coast or i don't know if anybody in australia what time it is there for watching there's not that there's 26 people on youtube and uh 14 people on twitch okay i've got to go and i'll be back in a couple hours
