With timestamps:

00:00 - okay I'm back I I don't know what to
00:07 - blame this on other than my own
00:08 - incompetence probably but I was having
00:11 - trouble in getting these Blackmagic
00:14 - devices to be detected by the computer
00:16 - again OBS really has been very kind to
00:18 - me and has had no problems
00:20 - so hopefully this isn't gonna be and I
00:23 - forgot what I was talking about it
00:25 - anybody remember the last thing that I
00:27 - said Oh No
00:28 - crashed oh my god look nobody back whoa
00:39 - okay that was like a momentary hiccup
00:44 - whoa
00:47 - OBS is now like showing me a video of
00:49 - myself from a moment ago it's like
00:51 - behind how can I fix that wonderful just
00:56 - cuz that's so weird
01:00 - alright as long as the people can hear
01:02 - and see me I'm gonna just keep going can
01:06 - you hear and see me is the is everything
01:08 - like out of sync in a weird way does
01:10 - anybody know what I was last saying oh I
01:12 - don't have the live chat up let me go to
01:22 - here see if this is actually working
01:56 - okay I now have a live chat I don't see
01:59 - anybody saying that they're seeing me
02:01 - and it's working it is back hi Dan and
02:04 - chat can somebody in the slack Channel
02:07 - tell me if things are okay I don't want
02:10 - to go unless I know things are working I
02:20 - think you guys are seeing me it is
02:23 - working okay great I think I think you
02:25 - might be way behind real time like a
02:28 - minute behind cuz that took a really
02:30 - long time
02:30 - for people to say it's working but it is
02:34 - working okay all right all right
02:39 - I this is driving me crazy that what I'm
02:43 - seeing on my monitor is like behind the
02:45 - real-time but I'm gonna have to just
02:47 - live with that Oh 545 okay we're gonna
02:50 - do simple harmonic motion Oh audio is
02:59 - out of sync very out of sync hold on let
03:05 - me see if I can fix that
03:07 - okay okay I think I fixed the out of
03:11 - sync problem
03:12 - I hope let's see how bad the thinking is
03:15 - I need something to clap along too
03:39 - how Bad's the audio sync now fixed okay
03:46 - I'm gonna drink some water I really need
03:49 - another coffee but it's not gonna happen
03:51 - or like something real like sugar snack
03:54 - I hope it doesn't freeze again yeah I
04:05 - know about the audio offset I've already
04:08 - actually set the offset is that is the
04:10 - thing coke is it it's pretty much okay
04:12 - though now right now it's fine okay
04:14 - great
04:15 - let's do this let's keep going I don't
04:18 - know which I'm gonna just play all these
04:36 - hello welcome to a coding challenge this
04:38 - is gonna be a pretty simple one and I'm
04:40 - curious to see what types of beautiful
04:41 - experiments people who watch this video
04:43 - will create after this video and if
04:45 - you've been wondering about the sine
04:47 - function and the cosine function how to
04:49 - use those functions for a motion in code
04:53 - then you're in the right place so this
04:55 - video is inspired by this tutorials
04:58 - inspired by the artist memo Acton who
05:00 - created a series of works about simple
05:02 - harmonic motion you can see here this
05:05 - this and these are actually all sound
05:07 - pieces so I encourage you to actually
05:09 - check them out and check check them out
05:12 - and actually listen to the sound but you
05:13 - can see each one of these circles is
05:15 - moving back and forth evenly but they're
05:17 - all offset from each other and this is
05:19 - kind of what I want to do in this video
05:20 - is in a really simple way just to have
05:22 - one of these moving back and forth and
05:23 - what can you create from that and if I
05:26 - scroll you can see some of these other
05:28 - examples simple harmonic motion number
05:31 - two you can see this is the same idea
05:33 - but with a more thoughtful and
05:34 - sophisticated visual design here's
05:37 - another one that's moved into 3d simple
05:40 - harmonic motion so things you might try
05:41 - to create as a guitar string plucking
05:44 - how would you create the simulation of a
05:46 - guitar string that's plucked or how
05:48 - could you create a simulation of a
05:50 - pendulum swinging what what about a fish
05:53 - swimming on Ã®le moving through the water
05:55 - here's a number five so I would love to
05:58 - show you all of these but I'm going to
06:00 - let you I'm going to put a link to this
06:01 - page in this video's description and
06:03 - hopefully you'll create something I just
06:07 - burped at the middle my video also
06:10 - something is driving me crazy the way I
06:12 - have I got a hit this lock button sorry
06:14 - look notebooks this is gonna have to be
06:17 - an edit point here
06:18 - okay sorry there's gonna be a terrible
06:26 - edit for a port that's yet
06:28 - hopefully you'll create something
06:30 - creative you look at these you'll be
06:32 - inspired and use the sine function in
06:36 - your code with simple harmonic motion
06:38 - okay let's keep let's write some code
06:45 - please edit this part up too while I'm
06:52 - trying to find the editor today was
06:56 - going so well it was a day where there
06:59 - were no weird
07:00 - crashing and that's all gone now I think
07:10 - I don't want us to start this whole
07:11 - video over I'm gonna start this whole
07:16 - thing over it's going to torture those
07:19 - of you watching this live but it's gonna
07:21 - be good for the long run for the world
07:31 - flatten the green paper on the second
07:34 - laptop that's probably better right okay
07:42 - let's try this again
08:07 - hello welcome to a coding challenge
08:09 - where I'm gonna make something very
08:11 - simple for the beginner just a
08:13 - simulation of simple harmonic motion and
08:15 - this coding challenge is inspired by the
08:17 - artist memo Acton who has a series of
08:20 - works about simple harmonic motion you
08:22 - can see here their musical works this
08:24 - idea of a simple oscillation back and
08:27 - forth so think of a guitar string
08:29 - plucking and/or a pendulum swinging and
08:31 - I encourage you to check out all of
08:33 - these beautiful this is one of my
08:34 - favorite ones which is sort of a mock-up
08:36 - for a live performance of just this idea
08:39 - of a simple oscillation up and down and
08:41 - what happens when there are many of
08:44 - these next to each other what types of
08:46 - patterns can you create and so just even
08:49 - going down further through these I
08:51 - encourage you to check out all of these
08:52 - but here's where we can see really
08:54 - really simply just this idea of easing
08:56 - and easing out easing in easing out a
09:00 - wave so to speak a sine wave so you
09:03 - might have seen in p5 or in processing
09:05 - or other things that there's a sine
09:06 - function in a cosine function what are
09:08 - those functions do and how can you apply
09:10 - those functions to motion or color or
09:13 - any other parameters that might be in
09:15 - your system that's what I'm gonna do in
09:18 - this particular video okay so now
09:23 - there's gonna be a little edit point
09:24 - because I'm rethinking I'm gonna drink
09:26 - some water I think that was better
09:27 - cuz it was shorter and I just realized
09:36 - that what I need to do unfortunately is
09:40 - oops my keyboard shortcuts stopped
09:43 - working hold on settings hotkeys switch
09:55 - to scene 1 whiteboard switch to scene -
09:59 - where do I have to click for those to
10:01 - work ok so I need to erase the this
10:06 - whiteboard
10:08 - so
10:18 - you guys don't mind bearing with me here
10:21 - oh I know what I was gonna do I forgot I
10:33 - wanted to do a draggable shape coding
10:36 - challenge because that's actually a
10:37 - really tricky thing to do and then I was
10:39 - gonna when I teach classes in es6 I was
10:42 - gonna turn it into an object but make
10:45 - many of them but I don't know if I have
10:47 - time for that that was another thing on
10:48 - my list on the Wikipedia API there's so
10:50 - many things to get to ah need more time
10:53 - in the day and in the live stream
10:55 - whatever okay alright so let's talk
11:01 - about what it is I'm going to use so in
11:03 - p5 or in processing and of course
11:05 - actually in JavaScript I'm in the math
11:07 - package there are functions called sine
11:10 - si n cosine cos these are trigonometric
11:14 - functions they perform a trigonometry
11:17 - functions they relate to triangles a
11:20 - triangle a right they were we try that
11:24 - again I I really shouldn't be allowed to
11:30 - start over so many times
11:35 - so before I start coding let's talk
11:38 - about the functions that are available
11:40 - in p5 also in processing they're just
11:42 - actually part of most programming
11:43 - environments called sine si n for short
11:47 - cosine cos for short these are
11:50 - trigonometry functions trigonometry
11:52 - being the study of the relationship
11:54 - between the sides of a right triangle
11:55 - and the angles of a right triangle so
11:57 - there's an angle here there's a there's
11:59 - an opposite side here there's an
12:01 - adjacent to that angle side here and
12:03 - there's a hypotenuse so I have some
12:05 - videos from my nature of code series
12:06 - that go through the math behind this in
12:09 - more detail and look at actually a whole
12:10 - bunch of different scenarios for
12:11 - simulating pendulums and various things
12:13 - so I'll link to those in this video but
12:15 - I'm actually not even going to worry
12:16 - about trigonometry in this video the
12:18 - reason why I want to use the sine
12:20 - function is if I pass a number if we
12:23 - think of this number like as the
12:25 - axis any number I pass to the sign
12:28 - function as an argument to the sign
12:29 - function will give me a value between
12:32 - plus one and negative one and if that
12:35 - number if I increase that number over
12:37 - time you almost think of it as time or
12:39 - along the x axis that number will the
12:42 - output of that function will oscillate
12:45 - smoothly between 1 and negative 1 and it
12:48 - will move most quickly in the middle and
12:50 - it will slow down as they get to the
12:51 - bottom and so ease in and ease out the
12:54 - sine function has a natural easing in
12:57 - and using out if I were to graph that
12:59 - it's gonna look like this incidentally
13:01 - if you look at my videos about
13:03 - synthesizing sound with the p5 just
13:05 - libraries you'll also use a sine wave to
13:08 - generate a tone and there's different
13:10 - kinds of waves and there's a lot to this
13:12 - but this is the basic idea cosine is
13:15 - exactly the same the only thing that's
13:16 - different is cosine of 0 is 1 cosine of
13:20 - 0 is 0 so it's just starting in a
13:23 - different place a slight offset but we
13:24 - just want the wave quality so for what
13:26 - I'm doing you I could use sine or cosine
13:28 - interchangeably obviously those
13:30 - mathematical functions have you know
13:32 - that scenarios where it's important
13:34 - which one you're picking in this case
13:35 - this is not one of them ok so let's see
13:37 - what happens when we add this into our
13:38 - code right I'm just looking at the chat
13:48 - sohcahtoa yeah that's a good ok we can
13:55 - do that again alright so I have a simple
13:59 - sketch with nothing in it I'm gonna say
14:01 - create canvas to give myself a canvas
14:04 - 400 400 I'm gonna add a draw function so
14:08 - that I can have a nice animation again
14:09 - this is all how the p5 library works the
14:12 - other there's other ways to code in the
14:14 - universe and I'm going to say background
14:18 - 0 and I'm just gonna say fill 255 and
14:24 - I'm gonna draw a circle in the middle of
14:27 - the window just to get something on the
14:28 - screen that I can take a look at and now
14:30 - I'm gonna come over here I can close
14:32 - this I'm hit refresh there we go I have
14:34 - my beautiful this is
14:37 - Challenge complete the circle but I'm
14:41 - gonna keep going so what do I want to do
14:42 - I want to have a variable and I'm now
14:44 - using let's to declare my variables oh
14:46 - just a murder video about why I'm going
14:48 - to say let and actually I'm I'm gonna do
14:52 - this I'm actually gonna make it a local
14:54 - variable to draw on to say let X equal
14:56 - 200 I'm gonna put X in here instead and
14:59 - I should still have the same result
15:02 - excellent okay so I'm just little steps
15:05 - here now what do I want to do what I
15:07 - actually want to do is instead of having
15:08 - X be a hard-coded value I want to have
15:11 - it be the result of the sine function so
15:15 - what do I put inside that sine function
15:17 - well if we think about this what I want
15:20 - is a smoothly oscillating number so I
15:22 - need to pass something to the sine
15:23 - function that moves along through time
15:26 - through the x axis a different value so
15:28 - let me come back over here so I won I
15:30 - need to introduce something I'm gonna
15:31 - call it an angle so I'm gonna say at the
15:33 - top let angle equals zero and I'm gonna
15:36 - say sine of angle so let X equal sine of
15:42 - angle and now I'm gonna look at this
15:43 - sketch and look at this now the circle
15:46 - is over there at the zero pixel because
15:48 - sine of zero is zero what happens if I
15:52 - were to now increase that angle so I
15:54 - want to say angle equals angle plus one
15:57 - because if any value that goes into sine
15:59 - is going to give me something between
16:00 - negative one and one if I increase that
16:02 - value over time I'm gonna get that
16:04 - smooth oscillation so let's look at this
16:07 - now look there's that smooth oscillation
16:13 - here's the thing why is it over there
16:15 - well if you remember the sine function
16:18 - just gives me a value between negative 1
16:20 - and 1 and now here's the essential
16:22 - question you are going to do something
16:24 - creative with this I've actually given
16:25 - you everything you need to know the
16:28 - question now is what's the context what
16:30 - am i drawing what's my animation what's
16:31 - my idea and what are the ranges of
16:33 - values that I want so I'm gonna keep
16:35 - this very simple and I am going to just
16:39 - say I want this to oscillate left and
16:41 - right so what I need to do is take that
16:43 - range negative 1 to 1 and map it and I
16:47 - do have a video about the math function
16:48 - the map function and let's let's do
16:52 - let's let's do this in two steps so I'm
16:54 - gonna say let's s be the result of sine
16:58 - of angle and I'm gonna say let X equal
17:00 - map that value which has a range between
17:05 - negative 1 and 1 and give it a range
17:07 - between 0 and 400 and I'm gonna say with
17:10 - here instead of 400 psi change the sign
17:11 - of the canvas
17:12 - now this math that map is doing isn't
17:14 - that hard it's just taking that s the
17:17 - value which has that range and giving it
17:18 - a different range I could do this myself
17:20 - if you're curious right I could say let
17:23 - x equals s times 200 plus 200 right
17:27 - because if s is negative 1/2 negative
17:31 - 200 plus 200 is 0 if X is 1 if s is 100
17:35 - plus joyner is 400 so this would be the
17:37 - math of mapping that range but in case
17:40 - things get more complicated later and
17:41 - the map folks are just so convenient to
17:43 - do this for us ok here we go oh yeah
17:48 - there we go oh look at that so look at
17:50 - it it's just like it's doing that
17:51 - oscillation but it's so fast so this is
17:54 - really well I have to think about how
17:56 - fast am i moving through that
17:58 - oscillation and this is relates to the
18:00 - idea of frequency or period and again a
18:03 - good checks on my nature of code
18:04 - tutorials where I go through that a bit
18:05 - more detail but right now we can just
18:06 - understand it as if I increase angle
18:09 - faster I'm gonna get a faster
18:10 - oscillation but I increase it more
18:11 - slowly I'm gonna get a slower
18:12 - oscillation so now what I'm gonna do and
18:16 - let's make that circle a little bit
18:17 - bigger let's make it 48 let's increase
18:21 - the I said angle is angle plus 1 which
18:23 - sort of makes sense if I were thinking
18:25 - in terms of degrees like zero degrees
18:27 - one degree is degrees but actually the
18:28 - native unit of measurement is something
18:30 - called radians which has a 0 to 360
18:32 - degrees is there two pi radians which
18:35 - I've talked about in many videos
18:36 - probably so I'm going to say zero point
18:38 - one and now we have look at that it's
18:41 - almost as if it's a swinging pendulum
18:43 - now it's moving along a straight line so
18:45 - it's not moving up and down as it's
18:47 - swinging but you can see this is that
18:48 - nice easing in easing in using out
18:51 - easing out using out easing in easing
18:54 - out easing in using out easing it's very
18:56 - hard to say that what's going by audios
18:58 - I just think this is going to be a
18:59 - disaster so
19:01 - what more can I do with this so now I
19:06 - have to think what should I do with this
19:12 - now this is the idea of simple harmonic
19:16 - motion and so I could add two of these
19:21 - drawed and different like what I might
19:24 - like to do is like make it the middle
19:26 - point of like a curve looking for ideas
19:30 - because maybe I should take this as the
19:31 - end of the challenge in some ways make
19:34 - more with different frequencies that's a
19:36 - good idea
19:38 - pendulum I don't want to do the full
19:39 - pendulum because that's kind of involved
19:42 - yeah the speed and range that's a good
19:46 - idea
19:47 - camera went out so I know what I'm gonna
19:57 - do and I make it feel like a spring draw
20:00 - a line and draw a wave yeah I like I
20:03 - kind of like that idea I want to be able
20:04 - to see the history put a color put it on
20:08 - a curve oh you guys have so many make it
20:10 - rotate in this circle at a y-component
20:12 - to me good that's the whole point the
20:14 - point of this is to have you guys do all
20:16 - of these things make it size change oh
20:19 - and like that okay okay everybody hold
20:23 - on so there are so many next steps I
20:31 - could take with this I could put a whole
20:33 - bunch of them here I can have them all
20:35 - kind of moving back and forth it's
20:36 - slightly different rates
20:38 - I could have its color oscillate I could
20:40 - have its size oscillate to make it feel
20:42 - like it's breathing there's so many
20:43 - possibility that people are just writing
20:45 - ideas writing ideas in the live chat
20:46 - right now so I encourage you in some
20:48 - ways just to pause this video right now
20:49 - and go try some of these ideas out what
20:52 - I'm gonna let me try to do a few things
20:54 - a little one thing I think would be
20:55 - interesting to try is can I make this
20:57 - feel like a spring so that it's kind of
21:00 - Lading but it oscillates all right am i
21:04 - back what's the chance that I'm back
21:09 - I think I think I should be back this
21:15 - first person who sees that I'm back
21:17 - please let me know in the chat it did
21:21 - this slow chat is it awesome different
21:24 - see so many chat messages my life okay
21:27 - yes I'm back okay what was the last
21:29 - thing that I did I mean I was recording
21:32 - two discs so hopefully the recording two
21:34 - discs still has it
21:38 - gosh I really thought that OBS was gonna
21:40 - be I kind of feel like the thing that I
21:42 - need to do is wipe the computer and re
21:46 - just rebuild the computer update
21:49 - everything I'm looking they just asked a
21:58 - viewer to pause okay alright so I went
22:01 - on for quite a while after that
22:02 - unfortunately so let me let me undo my
22:10 - code oops nope okay
22:21 - so I'm gonna move forward and try to
22:23 - just do one or two more things and
22:25 - ultimately I might even do another video
22:27 - because what I'd really like to do is
22:29 - store the history of the oscillation you
22:31 - can almost see like this wavy line thing
22:33 - but I need an array probably for that
22:35 - and I want this video to be simple with
22:37 - no array to start so anyway let's see
22:40 - what I'm gonna do so what once for a
22:42 - couple things one is that's gonna make
22:43 - things easier there's no reason for me
22:45 - to have such a tall canvas and also I
22:49 - think things are gonna be simpler if I
22:51 - use translate to put the origin in the
22:53 - center of the canvas so that I can think
22:58 - of everything relative to the center so
23:00 - you can see now how it's actually
23:01 - oscillating off to the right because now
23:02 - what I could do is I can actually just
23:03 - say X is the value of sine times 200
23:07 - right because I just want to and I can
23:08 - even more simply say X equals sine of
23:11 - the angle times 200 right because I just
23:14 - want to oscillate between negative 200
23:16 - and 200 so this is gonna allow for more
23:17 - possibilities so let's try this let's
23:20 - see first of all let's see if I can make
23:22 - this kind of like oscillate and slowly
23:25 - end up in the center kind of like a
23:27 - spring night so how would I do that
23:30 - well I can't this could be a variable
23:33 - this is known as the amplitude right
23:35 - this value 200 oops sorry
23:41 - this
23:51 - this value 200 is really like the top of
23:55 - the amplitude the height of this curve I
23:57 - mean it's really 400 cuz it goes up to
23:59 - 200 and negative 200 but that aside
24:01 - that's what that value is doing so that
24:03 - could be something variable so I'm going
24:04 - to call that amplitude and I'm going to
24:07 - say let amplitude equal 200 now what I'm
24:12 - going to do is have that amplitude
24:14 - shrink down to zero and I'm going to use
24:17 - the lerp function now you might have to
24:19 - stop and go watch my lerp video if you
24:22 - haven't don't know what that is but
24:23 - that's for linear interpolation meaning
24:25 - it's a way for me to like move towards
24:27 - another value interpolate towards
24:28 - another value by a percentage so let's
24:31 - try having amplitude I don't know what
24:33 - I'm just really making up stuff to
24:36 - interpolate to it to zero between itself
24:39 - and zero by ten percent boy that was way
24:46 - too fast one percent but that's not
24:56 - really what a spring would do right I
24:58 - kind of want the speed of the
25:00 - oscillation to speed up slow down I hope
25:06 - I like this idea
25:08 - did I use var no no I used let I'm
25:13 - yelling - did you notice that I'm
25:15 - yelling that's terrible hold on I got to
25:17 - think about what I'm doing here stop for
25:20 - a second it's kind of interesting all I
25:24 - could have the amplitude oscillate yeah
25:27 - that's probably what I should do to get
25:28 - some more interesting I I should just
25:35 - add the Y and yeah let me go back let me
25:43 - forget about that ant so
25:52 - yeah yeah this is better actually like
26:03 - just decrease the amplitude
26:04 - I'm just curious now the amplitude minus
26:09 - equal to that's interesting then it goes
26:15 - up okay I don't like that direction that
26:16 - I went well the thing that I should do
26:18 - is add a Y probably to get some
26:20 - interesting use exponent 2k all these
26:26 - great suggestions that's a really good
26:28 - idea the leader triple a she wasn't
26:30 - really right because I I I'm not really
26:32 - doing I could do it like a spring
26:33 - simulation that's not really what this
26:35 - is I like alka suggestion of Ouranos p5
26:40 - dojo suggestion of using X X & Y which
26:46 - is rich in crease the speed of the sine
26:47 - wave in time yeah yeah so let's this is
26:51 - actually interesting okay so I don't
26:53 - know where this goes back to okay I know
26:57 - I know so now Mattia this is gonna be
27:00 - challenging but I think you can find it
27:02 - so now I have amplitude but you know
27:05 - there's another variable in this system
27:06 - that variable is this right here point
27:09 - one that's actually relates to the
27:12 - frequency or the period half M is the
27:15 - wave oscillating really really quickly
27:18 - or is it oscillating really really
27:19 - slowly so if I can make that a variable
27:21 - I'm also gonna have more things that I
27:23 - can play with so what I'm gonna do here
27:27 - is I'm going to make that a variable I'm
27:29 - gonna call it let's just call it speed
27:31 - just to be non-technical for a second
27:34 - let's be equals zero so if I do this it
27:37 - is not oscillating now if I were to say
27:40 - something like speed equals map that
27:45 - Mouse exposition which goes between zero
27:47 - and width to between like you know zero
27:49 - and point five right we can see that is
27:56 - a fast oscillation a faster oscillation
27:58 - a slower so I could slow down that
28:01 - oscillation and speed
28:02 - so this is pretty interesting just in of
28:05 - itself like to be able to control that
28:07 - so what kinds of things can you do to if
28:09 - you control the amplitude and you
28:11 - control the speed let's try adding a Y
28:17 - and I'm going to say let y equals cosine
28:22 - of the angle times amplitude this is
28:26 - going to be an interesting result here
28:28 - I'm going to take out this speed thing
28:31 - and just let it be a constant point one
28:33 - and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
28:35 - go back to 400 by 400 I'm going to draw
28:37 - this at Y so let's look at what this
28:39 - does now look at this it's moving in a
28:41 - circle
28:42 - because if I oscillate along the x axis
28:45 - and I oscillate along the y axis at the
28:48 - same rate offset by sine and cosine I
28:51 - get exactly circular motion now one
28:55 - thing I might like to do is give this a
28:58 - little alpha and not draw the background
29:04 - so I see the trail and now what happens
29:07 - if I play with the angle here so this
29:11 - the X actually oscillates twice as fast
29:14 - as the Y now we get this nice figure 8
29:18 - pattern and I think there's a specific
29:20 - pattern I'm gonna look this up called
29:22 - Lisa jus pattern and I'm in a Google
29:28 - image search which looks like this
29:33 - that's what I think of it as this hold
29:39 - on timeout let's look at this Lisa do
29:42 - curve let's go Wikipedia yes all right
29:46 - hold on
29:49 - and should I be able is there like exact
29:51 - math this is a Lisa Juke challenge I
29:53 - just realized there's a good suggestion
29:59 - multiply sign by a value that increases
30:01 - over time and then map it again double
30:04 - helix wait I want to I mean I could just
30:06 - sort of like estimate this right top
30:10 - input signal output signal so there's
30:17 - over so much here so wow you're about is
30:23 - this right oh yeah it's just kind of
30:27 - generically the okay okay let me come
30:30 - back now by playing with the amplitudes
30:38 - and speed of this oscillation in various
30:42 - ways I can get a variety of different
30:43 - patterns and this is essentially what
30:45 - I'm essentially doing is the Lisa jus
30:47 - curve which somehow appeared is another
30:48 - tab that if you were made an edit point
30:51 - there which is really the graph of these
30:53 - equations x equals sign of overtime
30:58 - plus some offset y with some amplitude y
31:02 - equals sine of some value by some other
31:07 - amplitude without the offset so and we
31:09 - can pick lots of different values for
31:10 - these constants oh let's actually let's
31:12 - put these let's click let's make these
31:14 - variables so what do I have I have an
31:16 - amplitude along the a the the x-axis and
31:18 - an amplitude along the y axis we're
31:20 - gonna do this this this is now the Lisa
31:22 - Zhu curve challenge so I'm gonna say
31:26 - amplitude I'm gonna say a equals 200 let
31:31 - B equals 200 now I probably shouldn't be
31:33 - using capital letters I kind of don't
31:34 - like that a amplitude a and then I'm
31:38 - gonna say amplitude B okay so I'm gonna
31:40 - have two different amplitudes x equals
31:43 - amplitude a times sine of the angle and
31:46 - I'm gonna I'm gonna follow the and y
31:49 - equals amplitude B times and I'm going
31:53 - to keep with sine sine of the angle okay
31:57 - okay so now we're starting to let's see
32:00 - what we have here now if we look at this
32:03 - we can see now I'm just perfectly
32:05 - oscillating back and forth along the
32:07 - axis now let's go back to this formula
32:11 - and one of them should have an offset by
32:14 - offset Delta that's a delta correct so
32:18 - I'm gonna say let Delta and I'm gonna
32:21 - call it offset equal
32:23 - I'm going to say offset equal and since
32:27 - we're in Radian let's let's let's
32:28 - actually have angle mode I'm gonna go to
32:31 - angle I'm gonna change angle mode of
32:33 - degrees so I can just think in terms of
32:35 - degrees and I'm gonna have that offset
32:37 - be 90 degrees and I'm gonna have plus
32:40 - Delta Y is plus the offset does
32:46 - technically the X has the offset it
32:48 - shouldn't really matter but I'm going to
32:50 - add that Delta in here and then I'm also
32:53 - going to change the speed now that I'm
32:54 - in degrees to 1 well let's take a look
32:57 - at this an uncaught reference Delta is
33:00 - not defined
33:01 - oh I calls it el offset angle plus
33:05 - offset and now look we have that circle
33:08 - we have it moving and you know if
33:11 - there's a stroke on it which is why
33:12 - you're seeing this almost like my weight
33:13 - I can't say that word moi Rae pattern so
33:18 - what I'm going to do is just turn say no
33:21 - stroke so we can see this nice fuzzy
33:24 - path okay so now with that offset now
33:30 - what do I need
33:30 - I also need something to multiply a is
33:35 - time that's my angle so alpha and beta
33:38 - being constand that's really you can
33:41 - think of those as like frequencies or
33:43 - periods so I'm gonna say I'm going to
33:47 - call it a speed a equals 1 speed B equal
33:53 - 1 I'm gonna make the circle a little bit
33:57 - smaller
33:59 - 2424 and I'm gonna say
34:01 - speed speed a times angle and speed B
34:08 - times angle okay now let's run this and
34:13 - sorry in the wrong place I still just
34:15 - have my thing moving in a circle
34:17 - time out for a second I'm looking at
34:30 - that all right yes don't worry everybody
34:33 - I see what you're asking me now still
34:43 - moving in a circle so now is the time
34:44 - that we can start to be a little bit
34:46 - crazy so first of all I could just try
34:48 - different values like okay let's let me
34:51 - go up here and try an amplitude V of
34:55 - just 100 and its BB of 9 of a 4.3 what
35:01 - pattern do I get now well this is kind
35:03 - of interesting and I'd have to it looks
35:05 - actually like a sine wave but now it's
35:07 - coming back and it's oscillating so what
35:09 - kind of patterns can I get try lots of
35:12 - different values maybe I could make a
35:13 - whole interface where I could change the
35:15 - values over time I could also have color
35:17 - and size oscillating or that sort of
35:19 - thing so oh and a kaiju kaiju minee in
35:24 - the chat is making a good suggestion
35:26 - which is that I could also consider
35:27 - having a background with a little bit of
35:29 - transparency so like over time I'm
35:34 - actually seeing the full and and maybe
35:36 - then now this is a little bit of an
35:37 - aside here but I can give the fill no
35:39 - train you know that and I'm gonna I want
35:42 - to make it like very very little
35:43 - transparency so that it's kind of like
35:45 - an I should say background zero and set
35:47 - up so that I can see kind of over time
35:51 - that path but it's got also kind of fade
35:53 - out over time so I see the current stuff
35:55 - more bright so there's a lot of number
35:58 - one there's a lot of visual stuff that I
35:59 - could add to this a bug change speed to
36:02 - speed a and speed B where did I do that
36:05 - oh look at this oh my goodness no no
36:10 - it's as fine so this speed whoa why is
36:14 - this working
36:16 - that's crazy oh no there's still a speed
36:18 - up here so this is different now I
36:21 - probably I've did some sort of terrible
36:24 - variable naming so these probably
36:27 - shouldn't be called I just didn't want
36:28 - to say alpha because that's the name of
36:30 - a
36:31 - I mean that's not the name of anything
36:32 - alpha and beta it's not syntax
36:34 - highlighting so but maybe that's not a
36:37 - function I was worried about overriding
36:40 - something else called alpha so anyway I
36:43 - probably should have better variable
36:44 - hates but alright so I'm taking
36:50 - suggestions now timeout for a second for
36:52 - things I could add to this can you
36:56 - change the color of the ball depending
36:57 - on its speed yeah change speed to raped
37:01 - thank you so a great suggestion just
37:05 - came into the chat that why don't I
37:06 - change this to I'm just gonna change
37:09 - this to rate so that's kind of the
37:11 - global rate of everything and these are
37:14 - these are altering the the rate of each
37:17 - individual angle so like if I wanted the
37:19 - whole thing just to be able move a lot
37:20 - faster I'm going to change this rate to
37:22 - five and let's run this again of course
37:25 - there's more space in between and then
37:27 - you know so there's a lot to sort of
37:29 - work on here in terms of how it's
37:31 - working visually but and this is
37:33 - probably good enough so okay so I could
37:36 - add sliders to adjust it in real time
37:38 - that's a great suggestion I hope that
37:39 - some of you will do that suggestion I
37:41 - could add I could start playing with
37:42 - color one thing that I think would be
37:45 - interesting though is to think about
37:47 - these parameters as variables that
37:51 - change
37:51 - so even crazily absurdly what if I kind
37:56 - of almost recursively oscillate one of
37:59 - those so what if I say the speed is the
38:02 - result of sine of the angle which goes
38:09 - between negative 1 and 1 and map that
38:11 - speed to between 1 and 5 so now you know
38:17 - that is also that speed itself is
38:20 - oscillating and you can see wow it's
38:23 - kind of kind of spinning out of control
38:25 - and maybe I want to kind of say
38:28 - something like more like between point 1
38:29 - and 2 and then I could say speed B is
38:34 - between you know 2 and point 1 in the
38:37 - opposite direction and now I don't know
38:40 - what kind of crazy pattern I'm going to
38:42 - I could never expect what it is but you
38:43 - can see those things can themselves be
38:45 - variables and this kind of motion that
38:48 - it's doing is almost insane and I got an
38:51 - unpredictable but I assume that most of
38:54 - you can come up with more clever ways to
38:56 - think about this and the fact that I
38:58 - have the the amplitude of one of those
39:00 - being between 100 is a little bit silly
39:02 - I might as well fill the full screen the
39:04 - full window and I can make this one
39:10 - cosine let's just try this surprised
39:13 - that it started going so crazy let's try
39:17 - some other values and what I wanted to
39:20 - do I want to change that amplitude to
39:22 - 200 all right let's take a look at this
39:25 - this is my this is my Frankenstein crazy
39:30 - Lisa jus curve so I've gone on for too
39:33 - long you see the idea here Alka is
39:37 - making one really good suggestion to
39:38 - chat which I'm gonna try I don't know I
39:40 - don't like the way this is turned I
39:42 - should really plan these why is this so
39:46 - I wouldn't expect it to go so maybe
39:52 - that's what yeah so this is better all
39:59 - right hold on so let me actually change
40:03 - I think it's the speed is almost getting
40:05 - is is being allowed to be too much
40:07 - trying to change this to go to 0 to 1
40:09 - and actually I could make this rate 1
40:12 - and that's what I meant to do and have
40:14 - this go between point 1 and 2 and now
40:17 - let's see what this pattern looks like
40:18 - and now I'm going to add some color so
40:22 - let's try to oscillate color and say
40:26 - something like filled a red value of
40:28 - green value and you know let's do a red
40:31 - value 50 and a green value and I'm gonna
40:34 - say let R equal and again I could have
40:39 - values for all of these so I'm just
40:41 - gonna tie it to I'm gonna let me use Mac
40:47 - so if you know I could use math I could
40:48 - use multiply I'm gonna math sine of the
40:52 - angle between negative 1 and 1
40:55 - to between 0 and 255 and I'm gonna take
41:00 - B here which is for the blue value and
41:03 - do cosign and now we can see I'm gonna
41:06 - get some nice oscillating color as it
41:09 - oscillates and none of these things are
41:10 - synched but this is these are all the
41:12 - possibilities I could change the size so
41:14 - I encourage you if you watch this if you
41:17 - learned anything from this try to make
41:18 - your own version of this maybe you could
41:20 - come up with some actual concept or
41:22 - design idea that informs what it is
41:24 - you're creating with this type of motion
41:26 - okay thank you very much for watching
41:28 - this coding challenge this is where I
41:30 - ended up it's pretty ugly and weird and
41:32 - I hope that after you watch this you
41:34 - will come up with something quite
41:35 - beautiful why does it keep speeding up
41:46 - over time what am i doing that it's
41:49 - doing that this is not the end first of
41:53 - all h HS be like right what am i doing
41:55 - that it's speeding up over time did I do
42:00 - something to the amplitude which I
42:01 - didn't realize right this you're just
42:03 - multiplied by the angle a different
42:05 - amount the angle is going up at a
42:07 - constant rate oh I should really I
42:16 - should start using cons what times it's
42:19 - like 6:30 this has not been my finest
42:21 - livestream I think CDs saying that a lot
42:26 - right I have to fix this
42:34 - speed equals to somebody help me out
42:36 - here why let's try to understand this
42:40 - why is it moving nice and slow and then
42:51 - over time it's just faster and faster
42:53 - and faster because shouldn't this
43:00 - multiplying by the angle there map
43:03 - cosine check the variables in the
43:09 - console thank you
43:10 - why a console is like I really useful so
43:13 - let me log these let me log let's fix
43:19 - this let's let's come back and make this
43:20 - better right this should go up to two
43:24 - then it should come back down I think
43:31 - the issue to to come all the way back
43:37 - down is it gonna go all the way to point
43:39 - one yeah okay so the values are doing
43:41 - what I expect but the behavior is not
43:44 - and we could just make sure that there's
43:48 - no reason to think that speed B would be
43:49 - doing anything wrong whoops that's fine
43:56 - too
43:59 - all right so I think the issue is that
44:02 - what I probably want to make this better
44:05 - to like kind of do what I'm imagining is
44:08 - actually have let me try it but this is
44:13 - gonna be the most crazy weird an editing
44:19 - job ever so I'm not really happy with
44:23 - how this turned out and I think there's
44:24 - an issue here which you know even though
44:26 - what I'm doing makes sense in terms of
44:28 - those formulas that I ported from
44:29 - Wikipedia I think what I really want to
44:31 - get the behavior that I'm imagining in
44:33 - my head just bear with me for a second
44:35 - that what I actually want is let me try
44:37 - having two separate angle variables oops
44:43 - so let me try having angle one and this
44:46 - is kind of terrible angle a and angle B
44:48 - and let me actually have rate a and rate
44:53 - B and let me instead of this multiplying
44:57 - let me actually treat those separately
44:59 - and I'm gonna say rate a and rate B are
45:04 - some value like this so let's take a
45:07 - look at this now okay what did I miss up
45:11 - Oh an angle a rate a angle B R Appian by
45:23 - the way I guess I could be calling these
45:24 - things X&Y because they're for the X and
45:26 - Y axis and what did I mess up do I have
45:28 - an error angle one is not defined where
45:31 - did I say angle so this should say angle
45:32 - a and angle B angle a angle B angle is
45:41 - not defined line 31 and go hey angle B
45:46 - well I'm losing my mind here
45:56 - so this is doing more what I expect
45:58 - because it's gonna like really really
45:59 - slow down and then it should pick itself
46:02 - back up and so if I were to change these
46:06 - now between like one and ten yeah this
46:13 - is kind of I don't know that this is any
46:15 - better Wow and it's really like it's
46:17 - really consistently making the exact
46:19 - same shape really interesting weird like
46:24 - curvy shape here yeah and there do I
46:35 - have the offset there yeah uh yeah so
46:40 - what's going on here I'm actually this
46:43 - is so I'm actually just back to where I
46:45 - was at the beginning but I'm changing
46:48 - the speed of the circle it's fascinating
46:52 - you're not interested in this at all
46:55 - let's take this whole but I when this
46:57 - coding challenge gets uploaded that
46:59 - whole section will also be gone I should
47:04 - have had a plan I need to temper it it's
47:06 - gonna be great
47:11 - yeah it's a good point in saying like I
47:17 - why am i mapping though I think was a
47:19 - bad idea to try to change the rate
47:22 - mappings sign because ultimately
47:35 - and forget about that digression then I
47:42 - can have this be a UH all these like
47:47 - weird little shapes okay let's let me
47:49 - let me uh forget about that digression
47:52 - that won't make it into the video either
47:53 - I got to stop this one I should just end
47:56 - it where it was I'm going back
48:24 - oh do I have to undo why I really did a
48:28 - lot of wearable stuff to this I could
48:30 - also just try to correct it oh yeah
48:41 - okay this is back to what I had before
48:45 - your it could be from sine adding
48:47 - together over time your rate is not
48:48 - changing at a speed that's perfectly
48:50 - consistent yeah so anyway look if
48:57 - anyone's gonna end where it ended before
49:00 - Chris Rea said Joseph says I agree with
49:03 - you Chris Rea but what did Chris you
49:06 - should work on organizing here what did
49:08 - Chris race that you need get yeah no
49:10 - kidding I can't believe you guys are
49:12 - watching this so horrible I'm gonna do
49:14 - ten print this is just gonna have to be
49:20 - so I'm gonna finish this video again
49:23 - just in case we need a new ending for it
49:29 - so I've really done a horrible job with
49:31 - this like ugly monstrosity that's kind
49:33 - of now spinning out of control but
49:35 - hopefully watching this video you see
49:36 - the pieces of harmonic motion and what
49:39 - you might be able to create I'm gonna
49:40 - come back actually I think I would like
49:42 - to do you know we should do actually
49:46 - let's stop let's do one more thing with
49:47 - this video okay I'm gonna change this
49:49 - let's try to make it a guitar string
49:51 - that flexing that was one of my ideas
49:52 - let's do that so I'm gonna I'm gonna
49:57 - chain I'm gonna get rid of all this oh
49:58 - no no I'm not gonna do that the colors
50:01 - are so ugly to matrix math I was gonna
50:05 - wrap this up this is a terrible idea
50:07 - okay so I'm not very happy with this end
50:14 - result you can see that this I've got
50:16 - this sort of strange behavior with some
50:17 - very ugly colors but hopefully you've
50:19 - gotten the basic idea here of simple
50:22 - harmonic motion the idea of sine and
50:23 - cosine how you can tie that to a value
50:25 - you know you might just think of
50:27 - something a breathing shape of guitar
50:29 - string plucking I'm gonna come back and
50:30 - try to do maybe a different coding
50:32 - challenge that has a bit more direction
50:34 - to it with this and I would look for
50:36 - your suggestions of what might be useful
50:37 - but hopefully you can make something
50:41 - beautiful out of this take a look at
50:43 - that Lisa jus Wikipedia page and think
50:47 - about oscillating motion and make a
50:48 - beautiful design I think about sound
50:51 - size color and
50:55 - something much less ugly and weird than
50:57 - what I made here okay thanks very much
50:58 - for watching yeah this was such a
51:04 - disaster that's one of my worst coding
51:07 - challenges ever I hope that's never sees
51:08 - the light of day
51:09 - alright let's quickly try to salvage
51:15 - things here ten print I'm gonna do ten
51:28 - print and let's run a little server it's
51:42 - already in use why is it already in use
51:44 - I have another window open
51:54 - everybody should unsubscribe to my
51:56 - patreon right now Bernardo says this is
51:59 - my first time watching what's happening
52:01 - it's all meltdown so what's happening
52:02 - you know I get Ning was tutorial about
52:05 - the brick beggar game was so well
52:06 - thought out and paced and everything I'm
52:09 - gonna I'm gonna come back next week and
52:13 - things will be good okay and come back
52:27 - terminal open up this folder sketch
52:41 - okay here we go let's see here
53:05 - getting ready for tender I have the book
53:08 - I have two copies of this book and I
53:10 - really should have it here to hold up
53:11 - but it's downstairs so I feel bad about
53:15 - that but let me see what do I want a
53:17 - reference this looks pretty good let me
53:30 - yeah okay
53:44 - okay I am ready for this coding
53:48 - challenge has a plan it has a purpose
53:50 - it's going to be really short it's gonna
53:52 - inspire lots of creative ideas and it's
53:56 - gonna redeem us good this is my
53:59 - Redemption story I can feel it already
54:04 - let me come over here and erase the
54:09 - whiteboard case I need to use it and
54:20 - match if you're still it when you're
54:22 - watching this later and deciding what to
54:24 - do I don't mind if that simple harmonic
54:27 - motion coding challenge just gets
54:30 - scrapped I could come back and do it
54:32 - again something better
54:33 - people got it's here on the livestream
54:35 - if there's nothing redeemable about it
54:38 - alright I got to do the custom shapes
54:43 - video okay alright
54:57 - okay here we go the cameras are probably
55:01 - gonna shut off in the middle of this I'm
55:11 - kind of I'm sometimes I think if I press
55:14 - the button in the middle it gives it a
55:15 - half an hour all right
55:17 - I'm very excited about this coding
55:19 - challenge this coding challenge is
55:21 - inspired by the book called ten prints
55:24 - which is all about this line of code ten
55:27 - print chr dollar sign 200 5.5
55:33 - of code for the commodore 64 and this
55:36 - book which is written by by a
55:39 - collaboration of many authors i'll put a
55:41 - link to information about this book the
55:43 - book is available for free as a PDF
55:45 - online I'm looking at the website right
55:46 - now and it's a beautiful book I have two
55:50 - copies of it downstairs I wish I had my
55:52 - one copy to hold up here right now but
55:55 - it really looks at the history of
55:57 - creative computing sort of through the
55:58 - lens of this one line of code for an old
56:01 - Commodore 64 computer so what does this
56:03 - line of code do so here's a nice youtube
56:05 - video I'll link to this as well I'm
56:07 - gonna make this full screen here where
56:09 - you can see it emulator now typing out
56:11 - this line of code and let's see what we
56:13 - get
56:15 - run run it oh there we go look at this
56:18 - we get this interesting maze pattern so
56:20 - let me pause this for a second and let's
56:22 - try to figure out why is this happening
56:23 - so this is the basic programming
56:26 - language I think that's right that's
56:28 - actually one of the first programming
56:29 - languages I ever used when I was
56:31 - probably when I was in I think about
56:32 - third grade on an apple to see I think
56:35 - remember um back with basic programming
56:38 - language lines of code had a line number
56:40 - like the line 10 print says print
56:43 - something out to the screen to the
56:45 - is really just only a text console and
56:47 - then this is print the character either
56:49 - and I'm assuming here that the character
56:51 - 205 in ASCII code is a forward slash and
56:54 - the character 206 in ASCII code is a
56:57 - backward slash so randomly pick up but
57:00 - make this math problem between 2 or 5
57:03 - point 5 plus 1 I'm either gonna get 206
57:06 - or 205 so print out either forward slash
57:08 - or back slash slash and then go to 10 so
57:10 - I
57:11 - to recreate this and I'm not the there's
57:13 - examples already been made in processing
57:15 - I'm really just redoing what's already
57:17 - been done from the the publication of
57:19 - this book but I want to do it as a
57:21 - coding challenge and see what kind of
57:22 - creative possibilities emerge because
57:25 - you could this system which has a shape
57:28 - to shapes and probability think of what
57:30 - you could do if you change the way the
57:32 - probability works if you allow it to be
57:34 - controlled if you think about the shapes
57:35 - creatively now that we have canvas and
57:38 - the browser there's a lot of
57:39 - possibilities here so let me and again
57:44 - if I say anything wrong about the
57:45 - Commodore 64 basic and ASCII code I'm
57:48 - sure somebody will correct me in the
57:49 - chat and then I'll come back at the end
57:50 - of this video and correct that okay so
57:53 - let's look let's I need to write a setup
57:55 - function and I'm gonna make a canvas
57:58 - that's 400 by 400 and I'm going to say
58:01 - background 0 just so we can see it
58:03 - easily and I'm gonna go to the browser
58:05 - and I'm gonna unfold screen this and I'm
58:07 - gonna go here and now i have my canvas
58:09 - there we go so what do I want to do
58:11 - first let's figure out how do I draw a
58:15 - forward slash or a backward slash so I
58:19 - could draw it as a line line 0 0 10 10
58:25 - this is I know that's like a backward
58:29 - slash like that right now I could say
58:32 - line now what do I want if I want to go
58:36 - from the bottom to the top like a
58:38 - forward slash I'm gonna go from 0 10 to
58:42 - 10 zero right forward slash now I've
58:47 - drawn them both there so now what I want
58:49 - to do is I want to say ah maybe how do i
58:55 - do probability so i've done this in a
58:57 - lot of videos and i'm just typing it out
58:58 - and i probably i so let's think about
59:01 - just type this out here this is a way of
59:04 - applying a probabilistic function i
59:07 - don't know that's a good way to say it
59:09 - this is probability in my code because
59:10 - i'm gonna pick on random number between
59:12 - 0 and 1 half the time it's going to be
59:14 - greater than 0.5 half the time it's
59:16 - gonna be less than 0.5 so half the time
59:19 - you learn to draw a backward slash half
59:20 - the time i'm going to draw a forward
59:22 - slash now of course it's
59:25 - doing this over and over again in the
59:26 - same space on top of each other so what
59:28 - I want to do is move forward as if I
59:30 - were a console printing out forward
59:32 - slash backward slash so what I need is
59:34 - some global variables like let X equal 0
59:38 - let y equal 0 so I'm gonna draw up these
59:41 - at X Y X + 10 y plus 10 I could use a
59:46 - translate or something but let me just
59:49 - do it with offsets at y plus 10 sorry
59:53 - and X plus 10 and Y so just to make sure
59:57 - it's still sort of the same thing but
59:59 - now what could I what do I need to do
60:01 - what if I increase X x equals x plus 10
60:05 - so every frame I'm going to move to the
60:08 - next spot there we go one line now it's
60:11 - hard to see that all the way across one
60:12 - line all the way across and I lost my
60:19 - train of thought oh you know what's
60:20 - important here I should think of the 10
60:22 - as some sort of like spate I'm gonna
60:24 - call that spacing so because we might
60:27 - want to change that so I should really
60:29 - use a variable for that and then if X
60:33 - gets to the end if it's greater than
60:35 - width I should reset X back to 0 and
60:38 - have Y increased by spacing so let's
60:42 - look at that there we go
60:44 - I now have 10 print in p5.js now Casey
60:51 - Risa actually has a artwork all about
60:54 - ten print and with a lot of varieties of
60:57 - changing I hold on let me say that again
61:00 - let me pause edit point here Casey
61:04 - Reese 10 print when I saw Casey's show
61:06 - here in New York there was a screen but
61:12 - I guess that's really just from the book
61:16 - yeah this is his website here with stuff
61:18 - about the book all right never mind let
61:23 - me restate that
61:29 - hopefully let this get a little further
61:32 - I still have an X plus ten I think do I
61:35 - have an error oh yeah thank you in the
61:43 - chat I just was told I left the ten here
61:46 - by accident so let me fix that so now
61:48 - here's the thing what's kind of amazing
61:50 - is that simple code created this
61:54 - suddenly quite elaborate beautiful maze
61:57 - pattern and I've you know thank you to
62:00 - the authors of the ten print book for
62:02 - inspiring me when the book came out to
62:05 - like really try this and use this in my
62:07 - teaching I often give this as an
62:09 - assignment to look at the book and try
62:11 - to like invent your own ten print design
62:13 - so how would you invent your own ten
62:15 - print design well what are the
62:17 - parameters of the system one thing is
62:18 - just the spacing so you know I can make
62:21 - space thing equal 50 and that's gonna
62:23 - change things quite a bit let me put it
62:26 - back at 20 just so we can sort of see it
62:27 - a little bit bigger and moves a little
62:29 - bit more quickly but one thing I could
62:31 - do is change the probability so what if
62:33 - I say you know what there's a 90% chance
62:36 - of drawing a backward slash or a forward
62:39 - slash I don't know which ones which a
62:40 - 10% of the other one now we get a
62:43 - pattern that has a certain quality to it
62:45 - because almost all the slashes are back
62:47 - slashes except for every once in a while
62:48 - there's a forward slash that probability
62:50 - could be adjusted with a slider over
62:52 - time I could also think about color you
62:55 - know the other thing here is like what
62:57 - if I just did something like draw a
63:01 - rectangle or not you know even just this
63:09 - idea of each cell on this grid either
63:12 - placing a rectangle there or not I've
63:13 - already got some type of generative
63:16 - constant this is really what I guess
63:18 - what this is is this is an example of
63:19 - computational design or procedural
63:21 - design I have an algorithm that
63:23 - specifies the design you have Salda
63:25 - width wall drawings I'll try to put some
63:27 - linked links to information about the
63:29 - artist Sol LeWitt and his wall drawings
63:31 - is a nice example of this the rules are
63:33 - generating the design and that design
63:35 - could be the same every time but with
63:36 - probability it could be different every
63:37 - time
63:38 - so I hope I don't want to go much
63:40 - further with this and change to much
63:42 - more because I would like to see what
63:44 - you do and you could also think by the
63:47 - way you could other thing you could
63:48 - change the way that I'm drawing this is
63:50 - I'm animating it one line at a time
63:51 - without changing the background but you
63:53 - could think about displaying it all at
63:55 - once or animating it in a different way
63:57 - from the center so there's a lot of
63:59 - possibilities there too so I hope that
64:01 - you will create your own 10 print design
64:03 - you will share it with me on Twitter or
64:06 - in the comments and then you can also
64:08 - submit it as a pull request to the
64:10 - readme file that's associated with this
64:11 - sketches code and I'll include a link to
64:13 - that also in this video's description so
64:17 - hold on one second
64:18 - did I mess anything up about my
64:19 - Commodore 64 and explaining the basic
64:22 - programming language I'm looking in the
64:25 - chat so why is it that so I'm so I'm
64:35 - noticing in the chat first of all people
64:41 - are complaining that I'm not using
64:42 - contest you're never gonna you're never
64:43 - going to get me to use Const here but
64:49 - let's look at the ASCII table so did the
64:52 - ASCII table change wears forward slash
65:06 - 47 and backward slash is 92
65:14 - so why what did I miss why is it 205.50
65:24 - someone's gonna explain this to me in a
65:26 - second because I want to get this is
65:28 - important I think and then I could see
65:36 - this like K week bun is typing me I am
65:38 - so Mia's typing I see this is typing in
65:40 - that patron slack root cause I'm also
65:42 - looking at that YouTube chat here but
65:46 - special Commodore 64 only car set okay
65:50 - so maybe that's what it is
65:53 - commerce 64 do not use ASCII okay great
66:01 - so what where's the good place for me
66:04 - important important correction it turns
66:07 - out that the Commodore 64 did not use
66:09 - the ASCII table as we know it today it
66:12 - has its own character set that's why cuz
66:14 - the ASCII code for a backslash is like
66:15 - 42 or 92 or 97 that's not that yeah I
66:18 - could look it up at an ASCII table but
66:20 - it doesn't match 205 and 206 so I did
66:22 - get that wrong in my earlier explanation
66:27 - I'm singing the chants the extended
66:29 - ASCII table so I didn't see any other
66:31 - Corrections I think I mostly got
66:32 - everything else right in this video and
66:34 - so please share with me your 10 print
66:36 - designs check out the book ten print
66:38 - thank the authors of the book for the
66:40 - great work that they did to talk about
66:42 - the history of this line of code and how
66:44 - it relates to creative component
66:46 - computing composing goodbye I'll see you
66:49 - in another coding challenge thanks well
66:57 - that's a great idea
66:58 - Iran and the chat says make a ten print
67:00 - out of a given image so that's kind of a
67:02 - cool idea all right
67:06 - it is six fifty let me check my phone
67:10 - see if there are any emergency things
67:12 - going on that I don't know about I paid
67:15 - my AT&T bill that's good I have eight
67:17 - maybe I should switch spoiler alert
67:19 - that's my that's not a spoiler alert I
67:24 - kind of want to really want to redeem
67:25 - myself here let's look at my original
67:27 - list from today okay
67:33 - wow the API stuff shoot so what am I
67:38 - willing to try to do before I leave this
67:40 - was a disaster come back to that another
67:42 - time I did ten print I don't know that I
67:45 - want to do the wind data I definitely
67:46 - don't wanna do the matrix math this was
67:48 - a suggestion by Simon that I will I've
67:50 - got to think about some more and this is
67:53 - stuff for later do I have it in me could
67:56 - definitely do the custom shapes not the
68:00 - wiki API what's wrong with that what
68:02 - could be I don't have a video tutorial
68:03 - about using it and it could be quite
68:05 - useful I do have an example let me go
68:08 - look at the example just see github.com
68:13 - this is for one of my classes I was
68:19 - gonna try to make a Wikipedia like
68:20 - crawler where it would you type in a
68:24 - word it goes to that article and then it
68:25 - finds a link to another article and link
68:27 - to another article so it's almost like
68:28 - an exquisite corpse like random sequence
68:30 - that's what I was thinking to make
68:36 - that's what I was thinking to make I
68:38 - want to look at my Wikipedia code one of
68:41 - the things why I like using the
68:42 - Wikipedia API is that you don't have to
68:47 - authenticate to it so this is search for
68:51 - a particular article and then I do
68:55 - something where I get the data from that
69:03 - article hmm alright everybody use arcs
69:08 - please what was on the straw poll all
69:11 - right let's try HSB that harmonic motion
69:15 - thing has got to just get tossed when we
69:18 - try to do some more stuff
69:19 - so let's strawpoll this I might try to
69:24 - do both of these which which one first
69:30 - custom-shape tutorial that actually
69:35 - really do cuz it's relevant to the
69:36 - clouds thing you kind of need it for the
69:38 - clouds things vertex curve vertex and
69:42 - Wikipedia crawler I kinda want a
69:46 - different name for that Wikipedia I
69:48 - guess it's a crawler I would like to try
69:53 - to do both of these this has been a very
69:55 - long livestream but I feel like I'm
69:57 - gonna need a quick break to use the
70:01 - bathroom so Q learning oh yeah that's
70:05 - definitely gonna happen right now so
70:10 - this is the new straw poll w1e 8xk ax
70:16 - just in case i can only do one and
70:19 - curious what people think so I'm going
70:20 - to I'm gonna cause you all to crit maybe
70:24 - some of you didn't see that see the the
70:26 - try play the trailer again for those of
70:29 - you can get to see it earlier why take a
70:30 - quick pee break good idea bad idea I do
70:35 - a straw poll for that it's writing straw
70:41 - poll if you're gonna pick what you want
70:42 - later it's a very very valid criticism
70:47 - and I apologize that I didn't actually
70:49 - do what was on the straw poll but I was
70:51 - a little so maybe I shouldn't trailer
70:54 - okay so I'm gonna play this trailer a
70:59 - while and see it's 1 minute long I'm
71:01 - gonna mute the microphone when I play it
71:03 - because otherwise it'll be embarrassing
71:05 - and I'm gonna see if I can make it back
71:06 - within one minute otherwise it's just
71:09 - going - oh it's just gonna go to black
71:14 - at the end there's gonna be some black
71:16 - nothingness until I get back but I think
71:18 - I could pee within one minute we're
71:19 - gonna see it says this is the pee
71:20 - challenge
71:23 - my son loves this joke which I won't
71:26 - tell right now okay I'm gonna tell it
71:29 - there's a student in the class who's
71:33 - learning about the alphabet and the
71:36 - teacher says student please recite the
71:40 - alphabet and the soon
71:42 - I really really really have to go to the
71:43 - bathroom well recite the alphabet first
71:46 - a a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o q I
71:53 - ruined the joke
71:59 - ABCD efg hijk LMNOP QRS TUV wxy and z
72:09 - now i know my abc is one time won't you
72:11 - sing with me and the teacher says what
72:13 - happened to the p and the student says
72:15 - it's halfway down my leg I don't have
72:18 - the padam Chun
72:19 - terrible that's the old joke o people
72:21 - know that joke okay here we go ready for
72:23 - the trailer
72:24 - that's a here we go 1 2 3 I can make it
72:28 - I'm also I got to mute the microphone
72:30 - hit the trailer and be back
72:36 - [Music]
72:46 - [Music]
72:57 - [Music]
73:10 - pick you up at the station we'll make
73:12 - our own creation
73:24 - [Music]
73:31 - [Music]
73:34 - you
73:43 - you
73:49 - I'm back okay
73:52 - did I hopefully I'm moving my microphone
73:55 - correctly I'm noticing that this mic is
73:56 - actually in like a horrible position on
73:58 - my shirt surprised that people could
74:00 - actually hear me it was like pointed
74:01 - down
74:01 - so hopefully the audio is fine maybe the
74:04 - audio is a little bit quiet can we fix
74:09 - that all right almost in time the cringe
74:18 - is real
74:19 - I should just release that video now but
74:22 - I'm gonna release that after it okay so
74:24 - let's look at the results here well only
74:27 - it no way look at this coding trim
74:32 - history 66 well 166 people voted on this
74:36 - which is kind of amazing and I got
74:38 - exactly 50 50 did you guys play is this
74:40 - like a trolling me sort of thing let's
74:43 - refresh the results oh we got one more
74:48 - wait that's weak one more for the
74:50 - Wikipedia crawler fascinating oh so you
74:53 - know what this means you know what this
74:55 - means everybody it's time for the
75:01 - spinning wheel Schiffman and I could use
75:07 - a lot of contributions to make this
75:08 - better github io / randomizer custom
75:15 - shapes customer shapes custom shapes
75:18 - Wikipedia alright here we go we are
75:25 - going to spin this wheel we're gonna
75:28 - figure out which one to do I must by the
75:35 - way I can do the straw poll and then not
75:37 - listen to the straw poll but I cannot do
75:40 - the spinning wheel and not listen to the
75:42 - spinning wheel I have to obey the
75:44 - spinning wheel so I'm just gonna keep
75:49 - pressing this button and then at some
75:52 - point I will stop here we go Wikipedia
75:58 - custom shape
76:14 - [Music]
76:17 - apparently you can't blow air and wind
76:21 - onto a simulated arrow thing that's not
76:24 - even on a screen because this is a green
76:27 - wall but I just try no oh my goodness oh
76:32 - my god guess what everybody I apologize
76:35 - if you're in the patron chat I am
76:38 - it wasn't scrolling so I missed I missed
76:43 - all these messages creative composing
76:45 - composting etc etc six degrees of Kevin
76:50 - Bacon fluids haha force Isis I'm just
76:53 - checking trolling successful they have
76:55 - no wheel ok the 200 the 2000 the bitrate
77:00 - yeah I should try it let me try changing
77:02 - the bitrate
77:02 - cuz why not let me just try that right
77:05 - now since I'm like three hours into this
77:09 - stream output output
77:14 - streaming I'm gonna try changing the
77:15 - bitrate to 5000 I don't know if it'll
77:19 - really do that in real-time but let's
77:21 - try like I just changed look at the
77:24 - straw poll again I just changed the
77:26 - bitrate a custom shape is but by one
77:32 - vote you know we got to go with the
77:33 - wheel look that's amazing alright well
77:36 - I'm gonna do both let's do though
77:37 - Wikipedia first cuz it'll take forever
77:39 - and then I'll be it'll be a disaster and
77:42 - I'll be motivated to do the custom
77:43 - shapes thing again ok so let's try to
77:46 - create let's I'm so hungry I need to eat
77:49 - some dinner I need more coffee and I
77:52 - should not be doing this right now it's
77:53 - 7 o'clock I have to leave at 7:30 7:45
78:01 - desktop p5 generate - be Wikipedia
78:08 - crawler then what I want to do is CD
78:14 - Wikipedia crawler atom then what I need
78:22 - to do is
78:25 - go to the go to the desktop I'm already
78:32 - in this and I need to quit my old
78:36 - terminal thing that I had open because I
78:38 - can never seem to and run a server-side
78:42 - in my history yep okay then what I need
78:45 - to do is look at the Wikipedia API
78:49 - documentation which is here I think oh
79:03 - boy oh boy oh boy oh I don't like this
79:10 - at all
79:16 - oh wait I don't like this documentation
79:29 - okay getting text messages that I can't
79:32 - respond to right now
79:35 - no canvas okay I might just have two
79:53 - equals and search equals there's a
79:57 - mistake in my code let's look at this
79:59 - search equals rainbow okay great so this
80:05 - gives me a search for all the articles
80:08 - that have rainbow and then it looks at
80:12 - gives me the content for the mean oh no
80:14 - it gives me like a gives me like a one
80:17 - sentence about each of these so now if I
80:22 - want to look at an actual article I'm
80:25 - just gonna I I've waded through this
80:27 - documentation before and I don't want to
80:29 - have to do that again so I want to do
80:33 - this content action equals query profit
80:45 - equals revision this is weird this is
80:48 - the callback for the article content but
80:53 - how do I know which article it is oh and
81:01 - titles equals the article got it got it
81:04 - got it got it got it got it got it so
81:05 - now I also need to say and titles I
81:10 - think I can do multiple ones but so yeah
81:14 - this gives me all the content on the
81:16 - rainbow page title rainbow and if I did
81:20 - like rainbow trout right rainbow trout
81:24 - and then this is like finding other
81:29 - titles right
81:31 - okay this good night Simon you've been
81:35 - very very very very quick makeup bot to
81:38 - play the game that wicked game
81:39 - oh my god it's 1 a.m. it's what we're
81:44 - excitement is thank you for watching
81:45 - Simon I'm sorry that this has gone on so
81:47 - late I hope this has been helpful and
81:49 - useful and interesting for you ok
81:58 - alright where are we
82:01 - let's see ok so I think I'm good I just
82:04 - want to have these in I'm just gonna put
82:07 - these in my code already because there's
82:12 - no way I'm gonna be able to remember
82:13 - them and that is fine okay all right
82:28 - here we go everybody we're gonna do a
82:33 - Wikipedia thing there's a South Korean
82:39 - band called rainbow cool alright so this
82:45 - is the documentation oh this is the
82:50 - documentation this is better yeah this
82:52 - is what I want to look at this is
82:54 - actually what I meant to look at titles
82:57 - equals main page pro right okay so
83:00 - alright
83:05 - [Music]
83:07 - so let me close all this close this and
83:13 - localhost this open this alright here we
83:19 - go everybody ready for this I'm just
83:22 - trying to make crazy amount of content
83:25 - quantity over quality is the name of the
83:28 - game here at the coding train I'm
83:33 - probably not the smartest idea but I
83:35 - can't sometimes I get into this mode
83:36 - where I can't stop can we go hello I am
83:46 - going to do a coding challenge with the
83:48 - Wikipedia API um I don't think I've done
83:50 - this before
83:51 - I'm not exactly entirely sure what I'm
83:53 - going to build in a way it might be
83:55 - better for me to just do a tutorial
83:56 - about the Wikipedia API but let's make
83:58 - this a challenge so this is what I'm
83:59 - thinking there's a lot of interesting
84:02 - things you could do if you can get
84:05 - access to the content of Wikipedia you
84:08 - can make poetry machines and all sorts
84:10 - of experimental text things but one
84:12 - thing I know that people have done
84:13 - effectively is make games that you can
84:15 - play by sort of crawling and moving
84:16 - around Wikipedia and there are lots of
84:19 - interesting examples about that
84:21 - hopefully to get the chat so what I'm
84:24 - going to attempt to do I think is create
84:25 - a sketch where I'm going to say user
84:33 - input I'm going to create a little user
84:34 - input box and I'm gonna say user input
84:39 - equals I'm going to use the p5 function
84:41 - create input so now we should if I go to
84:43 - the code we should have a nice little
84:44 - input box and I'm gonna say and you know
84:50 - what I'm actually gonna do let me do
84:51 - this differently instead of using the
84:53 - create function let me get rid of the
84:55 - styling stuff let me actually put it in
84:59 - the HTML so Wikipedia coding challenge
85:02 - thing I'm hoping that I'll make
85:06 - something kind of onion not interesting
85:08 - sorry
85:16 - I'm hoping that I'm gonna make something
85:18 - not so interesting and that you the
85:20 - viewer will learn and see how I did it
85:23 - but have a more creative and mind to
85:26 - make something more interesting and
85:27 - exciting so I'm gonna say word and then
85:31 - I'm gonna say input ID equals user input
85:35 - input so I just I prefer to like put the
85:39 - the elements that I want on the web page
85:41 - in HTML so now we can see and I so now
85:45 - what I can do instead of this I can say
85:47 - select well time out I'm getting some
85:56 - text messages I have to respond to these
85:58 - if I'm gonna stream past 7 o'clock on a
86:01 - Friday I have to respond to my text
86:03 - messages whether before I shouldn't look
86:06 - at them okay oh great let's see I'll be
86:10 - done soon okay so I'd rather just select
86:33 - it and now we have access to what's
86:36 - written in it in and so what did i do
86:38 - did I do something wrong input is this
86:41 - something wrong with my HTML here oh
86:43 - yeah this should be h1 thank you
86:46 - so there we go so and actually let me
86:49 - make it h2 because it's so large there
86:52 - we go so I want to enter in a word here
86:54 - hello and hit like enter or something so
86:57 - when I hit enter I can handle that event
87:02 - saying user input changed go Wiki so
87:08 - what I want to do is have a function
87:09 - when the user hits enter or tab that
87:12 - that will signal that there's been a
87:13 - change in the text field I could also
87:15 - add a button or something but I'm not
87:16 - worrying about interface design here you
87:18 - could worry about that when you redo
87:19 - what I do and now I'm just going to
87:21 - write a function and I'm gonna call it
87:23 - go wiki and the first thing I want to do
87:27 - is just get what is in that what is in
87:32 - it so first I want to I'm gonna say let
87:34 - word or term or something term equal
87:37 - user input value console dot log term I
87:43 - don't know what I just did there but
87:45 - okay okay so again this is my sort of
87:49 - friendly style of writing JavaScript you
87:52 - could do this in 15 different other ways
87:53 - that's what i'ma do the other thing I'm
87:55 - gonna do is I'm just gonna add rainbow
87:58 - in here so it's that's not right I guess
88:01 - I say value equals rainbow so it's in
88:07 - there and then changed of null so the
88:10 - idea here is user input and then in here
88:14 - I said select Oh user input so it'd be
88:19 - nice if I put an ad in there so there we
88:22 - go
88:22 - okay so now if I hit enter tab oh it
88:27 - hasn't changed actually yeah
88:28 - so rainbows so the funny thing is is it
88:31 - started with the rainbow when I hit
88:32 - enter it did I surprise you is a button
88:34 - must submit whatever I'm actually gonna
88:36 - skip bypass all of that and I'm just
88:38 - going to when the window code starts I'm
88:41 - just gonna immediately call go wiki so
88:43 - I'm using this just like I want to setup
88:46 - an interface to make this dynamic with
88:47 - different words but I just want every
88:49 - time i refresh the page for it to run to
88:51 - test what's going working so I should
88:53 - see every time I run it I get a console
88:55 - log of what's in there I could change a
88:57 - different word so now the first thing I
88:59 - want to do is look for a list of
89:01 - articles with that term in it so I you
89:07 - know I've already done the research
89:09 - about the Wikipedia API and how it works
89:12 - normally in these coding challenges I
89:13 - like to kind of like figure that out but
89:15 - I have to admit the Wikipedia document
89:17 - API documentation is a bit difficult is
89:18 - to read but here it is and I can see
89:22 - this this is basically what I'm using
89:23 - here I think is that this is looking for
89:25 - this URL tells to send you the content
89:28 - of a page but there's also like a URL to
89:30 - get us to do a search so you can look
89:33 - through and read all about how to do
89:34 - this but I'm actually just gonna I
89:37 - already have a URL right here this is
89:40 - for a search so what I'm gonna do here
89:43 - is I'm gonna say VAR URL equals and
89:47 - actually let's um let me use these let
89:50 - me make these and I'm gonna I have to
89:51 - use let not bar I'm gonna say put this
89:54 - put this back up at the top there I'm
89:57 - gonna say let search URL equal and this
90:03 - is the full URL I'm gonna go all the way
90:05 - to the end and close the quotes but I'm
90:09 - gonna take that out because what I want
90:11 - to do is have an end and then I want the
90:13 - search term to form dynamically so I'm
90:16 - gonna say let URL equal search URL plus
90:23 - term so let's just console.log that URL
90:26 - to see that that's working there we go
90:31 - so now you can see that's the full URL
90:32 - if searching for rainbow and that's
90:34 - dynamic because if I were to put in here
90:36 - you know unicorn and hit enter now I'm
90:39 - gonna get unicorn so the first thing
90:41 - that I want to do is just sort of see
90:43 - what's in that I'm I want to I just want
90:46 - to copy this URL and I want to look at
90:49 - it I didn't get it I could just click on
90:55 - it instead of copying it but I'm gonna
90:56 - put it in here and look this is the JSON
91:00 - JavaScript object notation formatted
91:03 - data that's coming from the Wikipedia
91:04 - API and it's giving me a list of all the
91:07 - possible pages with the term rainbow in
91:09 - it so let me just pick the first one so
91:13 - how do I even get that so it's coming in
91:17 - as in so first of all I have to request
91:19 - it from my code I'm looking at in the
91:21 - browser so I want to say load JSON URL
91:24 - and then I'm gonna say got data so let's
91:27 - make sure this comes through and I'm
91:30 - gonna write a function called got data
91:31 - and that's the callback for when the
91:35 - data comes through and I'm kind of
91:36 - entering into a dangerous territory of
91:38 - having all these nested callbacks first
91:40 - there's a callback for the input box
91:42 - then there's a callback for the data
91:43 - then I'm gonna do something else with a
91:44 - callback so someday I might want to
91:46 - refactor this using a sort of more
91:48 - thoughtful approach of how to sequence
91:50 - all these callbacks but I'm just gonna
91:51 - kind of do it willy-nilly right now
91:53 - console dot log data so let's see what
91:57 - happens here ah so look at this this is
92:03 - like the bane of everybody's existence
92:07 - on the Internet access control allow
92:10 - origin header not present I can I use it
92:12 - course to say ba ba ba ba ba ba so this
92:14 - is a really unfortunate it's the
92:18 - Wikipedia API doesn't seem to have
92:20 - something called cores which is
92:21 - cross-origin resources or something like
92:23 - that enabled allowing us to fetch data
92:26 - from another server from a server which
92:28 - is where our code is running some api's
92:30 - will let you do this some won't I'm
92:31 - pretty sure since I've used this before
92:33 - in code that there's a way around this
92:34 - it's called JSON PE I sort of made a
92:36 - video about this somewhere else it's
92:38 - JSON with padding and p5 has a nice
92:40 - option so often what I do and I've said
92:43 - this before is it didn't work
92:45 - I got cores let me just add another
92:47 - argument here JSON P so if I last add
92:50 - this third argument let me try it with
92:52 - JSON P and let me run it again and there
92:55 - we go it came through so we could say a
92:57 - lot more about that but in this case
92:59 - were just lucky we tried it first
93:01 - without JSON P now we try it with JSON P
93:03 - so what I'm looking for is it comes in
93:05 - as an array I want the first element the
93:07 - first element of the first element of
93:09 - the array so I'm going to try to see if
93:12 - I could say console log data 0-0 let's
93:17 - see what I get and I could pick a random
93:18 - one that might be more interesting but
93:20 - let me just pick the first one I got are
93:24 - mmm did I get the o 0 no one zero sorry
93:29 - I want data 1 the second element the
93:32 - first element of the second element
93:34 - there we go rainbow so let's just see
93:38 - rainbow let's try putting other things
93:40 - in here like unicorn
93:41 - and let's just try like a few characters
93:46 - like ar e there's a I guess there's a
93:50 - Wikipedia page for our e P P you why
93:59 - okay what's going on here let's look at
94:01 - the full data
94:07 - 0tu I know there is a Wikipedia page for
94:12 - Pui which is the French burning the
94:14 - point is if I pan turd in a search term
94:17 - that was just part of a page I wouldn't
94:20 - get it back but you'll think of
94:21 - something
94:22 - so now what I want to do okay so once I
94:25 - have the what I'm gonna pause for a
94:29 - second and think of something okay I've
94:32 - got to I've got to think of some
94:38 - whatever
94:39 - what's a sequence of characters that
94:43 - that wouldn't be its own thing in the
94:48 - Wikipedia TL TL TL C EXC someone is
95:00 - saying in the chat there is a Wikipedia
95:08 - page for exe right
95:11 - he X C but I'm basically getting yeah
95:14 - look at this
95:15 - okay I can't think of anything it
95:16 - doesn't matter what I'm gonna do we're
95:18 - gonna check so let's change it to random
95:23 - so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm
95:25 - gonna say let's length equal data index
95:28 - one length it's probably it's I think
95:30 - it's gonna just give me sort of 10 by
95:31 - default and then I'm gonna say let index
95:35 - equal floor random length so I want to
95:39 - pick a random index into that array and
95:42 - I'm going to say data index 1 data 1
95:45 - index so this should give me a random
95:46 - article that'll be better let me go back
95:50 - to my thing here so now I got rainbow
95:53 - the South Korean band if I type in what
95:56 - it was I PU why I got py but there are
96:01 - other ones it won't
96:03 - oh it's I didn't I gotta have the submit
96:05 - button unicorn
96:07 - I got unicorn bubble so you can see I'm
96:10 - getting a random one each time let's do
96:12 - rainbow again
96:13 - I got Rainbow Brite let's do a unicorn
96:15 - again and I got unicorns the cricket
96:17 - team okay so we're
96:18 - getting a random article each time
96:19 - that's good I forgot what I'm doing here
96:22 - exactly but now let's at least get the
96:23 - article data so the next thing that I
96:26 - want to do once I have that title so
96:29 - really what I'm saying is VAR title
96:30 - equals this now one thing about
96:34 - Wikipedia titles is let's say I try to
96:37 - actually look for unicorns cricket team
96:40 - on Wikipedia so I'm gonna go to with
96:45 - unicorns cricket team Wikipedia see if I
96:48 - can get that page here it is look at the
96:51 - URL the title the way Wikipedia works is
96:54 - it actually uses underscores wherever
96:56 - there are spaces so I'm gonna need to
96:58 - account for that so one thing I'm gonna
97:00 - do is I'm now gonna say title equals
97:02 - replace oh sorry title this is a
97:06 - JavaScript function that allows me to
97:09 - use a regular expression which you can
97:11 - watch my regular expression tutorials
97:13 - match any white space I could have just
97:16 - done this any like space but let's do
97:18 - I'm gonna be smart about this any one or
97:21 - more white space in a row with an
97:24 - underscore
97:25 - now let me console.log that title and
97:29 - let's see what this looks like you can
97:35 - see I got rainbow flag now oh you know
97:37 - what I forgot
97:37 - it only replaced the first space so I
97:40 - need to have the global flag here so it
97:44 - replaces all the spaces and I know you
97:47 - can see it replaced all the spaces
97:48 - rainbow trout etc rainbow rainbow bright
97:52 - etc okay
97:53 - so here we go now what am I gonna do now
97:57 - I need to ask Wikipedia and here's the
98:00 - next this is I'm gonna call this the
98:02 - content URL this is the URL for asking
98:06 - for the content and I think you can ask
98:08 - the fact that it's it you can see at the
98:12 - end here it's titled equals I think you
98:14 - can ask for content of multiple articles
98:16 - but I'm just gonna do one so what I'm
98:19 - going to do now if back into my code I'm
98:22 - gonna go down here to see what I mean by
98:24 - this sort of nested callback thing that
98:26 - I've done is kind of a bit of a problem
98:27 - I'm going to say
98:30 - load JSON okay Leslie the bar here
98:38 - let-let-let URL equal the content URL
98:45 - plus the title and then I call it
98:49 - content URL with lowercase RL content
98:52 - URL plus the title and then lo JSON URL
98:56 - and then got now I need another you know
99:00 - most people when writing JavaScript I
99:02 - don't most people we put an anonymous
99:04 - function right in there that's the
99:05 - callback or use some type of other
99:07 - technique to have nested callbacks like
99:09 - async our promises
99:11 - I'm gonna be pretty terrible about it
99:13 - and I'm gonna say I'm gonna call this
99:15 - got search and I'm gonna call this got
99:18 - content and just write another function
99:21 - called this data and I'm gonna say
99:24 - console whoops and I'm gonna say console
99:28 - dot log data okay so now I want to see I
99:33 - want to look at the say console dot log
99:37 - querying and title oh there's that new
99:43 - like backtick fancy way in es6 of you
99:46 - doing strings got to do that at some
99:47 - point okay okay so let's do this uh so I
99:53 - went for Rainbow Brite but it didn't get
99:55 - the content of Rainbow Brite so what I'm
99:58 - going to do is say why because I forgot
100:01 - about json p so i have to do json p i
100:04 - had that cross origin error again and
100:08 - does this look like I got stuff this
100:12 - looks weird
100:13 - hmm all right let's see rainbow flag
100:15 - with stress again rainbow flag some so
100:18 - what did I miss here back tick template
100:24 - strings okay hold on what did I miss
100:27 - timeout edit point so this didn't work
100:36 - content URL plus title let's look at
100:38 - that let's log that URL so this is the
100:48 - URL copy link address oh oh we need to
100:54 - come in Oh apologies so actually this is
101:04 - working I just find this to be totally
101:06 - confusing to look at but the content is
101:08 - in there I should have thought like I
101:10 - have to go and investigate how the JSON
101:12 - is format at first so I could say I can
101:14 - I can copy this link and look at it and
101:16 - by the way I have a Chrome extension
101:18 - installed it's called like JSON format
101:21 - err - let me look at the stuff this way
101:23 - so really what this is I got to look
101:25 - under query pages huh I have to know the
101:29 - ideal hold on a second here so pages
101:34 - page idea revisions oh my god goodness
101:37 - three items content format star this is
101:43 - what I want which is oh this is the
101:44 - Wikipedia API is organized strangely and
101:47 - maybe there's another way to do this but
101:50 - I actually need to I think I might I
101:57 - have to think about how do I if I don't
101:58 - if the page ID is gonna be different how
102:01 - do I know what to look up because
102:09 - revisions is under this page ID did I
102:11 - get the page ID in the previous query so
102:16 - hold on I have to look at the previous
102:17 - query is there a page ID in here there's
102:25 - no page ID here alright I'm out again
102:31 - the first one can you just do the first
102:34 - I can do index for the first object is
102:37 - that what I need to do
102:43 - object keys data query okay okay look I
102:46 - could look up the keys that's a good
102:48 - point that Alka is making there's a
102:54 - little interesting discussion in the
102:55 - chat going on about Const I got a look
102:57 - at my text messages when I'm taking this
102:58 - break okay okay all right hold on let me
103:08 - think about this okay so while I see the
103:16 - content here under star there's
103:18 - something pretty tricky about this which
103:20 - is I don't know what this is going to be
103:22 - it's the page ID so I've got to pull
103:24 - that dynamically somehow let's see if we
103:26 - can figure that out so I know I want to
103:27 - go to query pages and then something so
103:30 - let me look at this right here
103:32 - console.log data I can get rid of this
103:35 - console log let me say data pages query
103:38 - so let's look at that undefined
103:43 - undefined what did I miss
103:45 - let's data pages undefined okay so I
103:50 - messed that up oh it's just hold on
103:58 - query is sorry looks like query is the
104:01 - first object I want data query yep
104:07 - now pages sorry let me start over
104:14 - query pages I did for me let me pour not
104:21 - yet
104:25 - so looking at this I have query pages
104:29 - and then some number which is the page
104:30 - ID which is something that's going to be
104:33 - different for every article so I have to
104:34 - somehow pull that dynamically in order
104:35 - to get down here to this stuff which is
104:37 - the content which is what I want so what
104:40 - I'm going to do is I'm gonna say let me
104:42 - look here and I can change this
104:44 - console.log data dot query dot pages
104:47 - let's see what I get
104:48 - oops I'm in the wrong place and hit
104:50 - refresh so I got it so how do I know
104:53 - what this number is can I just use like
104:54 - an index I could get the key I could say
104:57 - object keys but what if I just say index
105:00 - zero will that work for the first object
105:02 - no undefined so I could say object keys
105:09 - to give me all the keys that are in this
105:12 - and then look I've got that so the page
105:17 - ID this is pretty weird that what I'm
105:19 - doing I know if there's a better way to
105:20 - do this page ID equals object keys data
105:25 - query pages index 0 index 0 so let's see
105:33 - if that gives me the page ID whoops I
105:40 - have too many brackets what if I messed
105:43 - up here too many parentheses and okay
105:48 - here we go lots of errors here here we
105:50 - go let's try to get this right this this
105:53 - deserves a drumroll am I gonna see the
105:56 - page ID yes and I'm gonna see different
105:59 - page IDs look at that so I'm able to get
106:02 - the page IDs whatever so now what I want
106:09 - is the content to be equal to so so let
106:20 - me just call it page equal data query
106:24 - pages and now I want to say page page ID
106:30 - right because I want to go and look at
106:35 - I want to look at page pages or pages
106:43 - page ID revisions star dot revisions
106:49 - [Music]
106:51 - star now here's the thing you can say
106:53 - dot the name of the thing if it's a
106:55 - valid variable name like revisions but I
106:57 - can't say dot star because star is not a
107:00 - valid character for a variable so I've
107:01 - got to use these brackets boy I'm really
107:03 - off my rocker here with this crazy
107:05 - convoluted using Wikipedia low okay here
107:08 - we go
107:08 - let's see what's the chance that I got
107:10 - something here Oh
107:12 - let's look console dot log content
107:16 - undefined mmm let's look at revisions
107:22 - okay got something there revisions zero
107:26 - oh it's an array so zero star oh my
107:29 - goodness
107:30 - zero stars these are really this is like
107:33 - detective work it's not even programming
107:35 - just to figure out how this thing works
107:36 - they are there look there's the content
107:39 - of the Wikipedia page I finally got the
107:41 - content of the Wikipedia page now what
107:42 - do I do with that Oh No
107:46 - so let's do this let's first do a couple
107:49 - things let's say let me at least say
107:55 - right about right before I asked for the
107:57 - content let me say create P title so I
108:04 - got that and now I got the content if I
108:07 - type unicorn in here I and I get the
108:10 - content so now the question is what do I
108:13 - want to do well I could search for a
108:15 - word and then I could so I could pick a
108:17 - random word and then search for articles
108:20 - with that random word in it why not
108:21 - right I could look for links like I
108:23 - could look for special links to other
108:25 - Wikipedia pages but let's be really
108:27 - simple about this and let's just
108:28 - actually let's use another regular
108:31 - expression I got to move they're gonna
108:32 - make this challenge I got to finish this
108:34 - up and I wrap this challenge up somehow
108:35 - so let's use a regular expression let's
108:38 - say I want to say were word regex equals
108:47 - any
108:49 - valid sequence of word characters one or
108:52 - more and let's actually let's say it has
108:53 - to be at least four or more so I have to
108:56 - be at least be like a four-letter word
108:58 - and then and I could put word boundaries
109:02 - right word boundaries I guess and then
109:07 - make it global and then I could say what
109:11 - how do I do this again I say word regex
109:15 - exec or match where do I say Content
109:20 - match I can't even remember my own right
109:22 - right which content match the word
109:24 - regular expression by the way I'm kind
109:26 - of off my rocker here in the sense that
109:27 - I am now using all sorts of stuff like
109:30 - regular expressions you could compare
109:32 - expressions tutorials but what I'm
109:33 - trying to do here is create match a
109:35 - given word and that word is any sequence
109:38 - of characters for more I'm deciding and
109:40 - then I want to look at this so let's see
109:43 - I don't know if I did this right let's
109:45 - see if this gives me a bunch of words on
109:47 - the page it look it did it gave me two
109:53 - thousand four hundred seventy four words
109:54 - like vandal M vandalism expiry October
109:59 - so now what I'm going to do oh boy
110:01 - is I'm gonna pick one of those randomly
110:03 - and by the way the nice thing and it's
110:06 - in it's just an array that if the whole
110:09 - thing is an array p5 the random function
110:11 - I can give it an array and it'll pick me
110:15 - a random one from it and I'm gonna put
110:18 - that in now whoops sorry sorry I messed
110:24 - up what am I doing here you go back the
110:30 - nice thing about p5 is I can now say I'm
110:33 - going to save our words equals the
110:36 - result of this regular expression then
110:38 - var word equals pick a random one so the
110:41 - p5 random function you can actually give
110:43 - it a ran will pick a random one out and
110:45 - I'm gonna say console.log word and I'm
110:48 - going to run this and it gave me average
110:51 - so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to
110:56 - go with you what I'm just gonna give
110:58 - this forget I would give this a go wiki
111:00 - word or turn
111:05 - so it starts with user input value but
111:08 - this go wiki term just does it with that
111:10 - thing so now I can say go wiki word now
111:16 - I'm gonna probably crash my browser
111:17 - because I'm gonna be doing this over and
111:19 - over again I should put something in
111:20 - that stops but it'll actually just go
111:22 - back and do this whole sequence again so
111:25 - let's see what happens yeah look at this
111:28 - hey a Wikipedia random article crawler I
111:33 - need to stop how do I stop it okay let's
111:36 - at least figure out oh good at least I
111:38 - got an error at some point that's how I
111:40 - stopped it look how far I got I got to
111:42 - the return of Saturn so somehow we got
111:46 - femme fatale made-in-america each tear
111:49 - from rainbow south korean band so i
111:52 - should at least probably do some type of
111:54 - protection yeah I'm going to do
111:55 - something sort of silly
111:56 - whichever's gonna say let counter equals
111:58 - zero I should come up with a better way
112:01 - of doing this and I'm gonna say counter
112:04 - equals counter plus 1 and if counter is
112:08 - greater than 10 O's less than 10 so only
112:12 - do this 10 times and I'm just gonna say
112:16 - create div just so it's a little less of
112:20 - all that space and now let's try this
112:22 - one more time it did it 10 times and it
112:26 - stopped and in theory I should be able
112:28 - to know the counter should get reset
112:32 - anytime change now but you know what I'm
112:34 - gonna do forget it let's let's not have
112:36 - it dude it's only gonna be I'll do it
112:37 - once you got this will be easily fixable
112:39 - so now I'm gonna put something in here
112:41 - like unicorn and OH so what happened
112:46 - there oh whoops
112:49 - okay go wiki is the thing that starts it
112:52 - of course of course so I need another
112:54 - function start search so I'm going to
112:58 - create a function called function start
113:00 - search and that does go wiki user input
113:05 - dot value and also sets the counter
113:09 - equal to zero there we go perfect now
113:11 - everything is done so I can actually do
113:14 - this and I can change this to
113:16 - unicorn and it will give me crawl a
113:20 - bunch of random articles and then I
113:22 - could give it happy and it will crawl a
113:28 - bunch of random articles and end with
113:29 - music okay everybody thank you for
113:31 - watching this random Wikipedia article
113:33 - coding challenge thing it required a lot
113:36 - required regular expressions it requires
113:38 - of callbacks and low JSON and json p and
113:42 - ohio wiki API works Wikipedia I hope I
113:46 - hope you make something from this and
113:48 - actually be more thoughtful and have a
113:49 - an idea here of why you might want to
113:51 - crawl Wikipedia and make some kind of
113:52 - strange thing with it so I sure would be
113:54 - what you make and I look forward to
113:56 - seeing you in a future video
114:02 - yeah so me I am so be is rightly
114:07 - complaining that I put all my functions
114:08 - inside setup but you know I'm just not
114:10 - worrying about this right now they're
114:12 - all being hoisted because they're not
114:14 - using let don't worry about it is me all
114:18 - right let me look at my text messages
114:20 - let's see if I could do the custom
114:21 - shapes thing okay
114:24 - okay meet there great okay okay well
114:28 - okay let me just check one thing see if
114:34 - I can do this custom shapes thing cuz I
114:36 - and I'll be done by 8:00
114:37 - cuz that's only gonna be 20 minutes for
114:39 - sure and I'm never gonna do this again
114:45 - where I go for hours and hours and hours
114:47 - but I'm just checking something here on
114:48 - my phone you can listen to this waiting
114:50 - music
114:54 - okay
114:59 - all right all is well and I should
115:09 - probably just do the custom shapes next
115:11 - week does anybody actually want to still
115:13 - keep watching this live stream if you do
115:20 - you're I feel like I have to make enough
115:23 - videos to rightfully not include the
115:27 - simple harmonic motion challenge okay
115:32 - people are gonna still watch all right
115:36 - I'm gonna try to do this kind of quick
115:43 - well I love that I got Newsies the
115:45 - musical in there that's pretty awesome
115:49 - let's see here
116:01 - p5 manager is like the greatest thing
116:03 - ever
116:05 - p5 generate - be custom shapes did I oh
116:12 - did I put some bars in there oh yeah at
116:21 - least when I publish the code that will
116:22 - get fixed actually I kind of was happy
116:25 - with the way this like crazy example I
116:27 - feel like there's a lot of possibilities
116:28 - from there
116:49 - [Music]
116:59 - I'm thinking by the way if I start
117:08 - having like the stream crash I might
117:11 - come back to say goodbye but that'll be
117:13 - the last straw
117:14 - didn't I start this 3 hours and 40
117:16 - minutes ago I did I don't know that I've
117:19 - done a live stream and it ruins still
117:21 - sake please dude neural networks it'll
117:25 - come why go watch Suraj was here he's
117:27 - got lots of videos on neural networks
117:29 - you can watch this great I watch them
117:31 - that's why I learned a lot of stuff ok
117:37 - you can close this close this close this
117:48 - I haven't read any random numbers I know
118:16 - anyone programming design system okay
118:32 - okay we c'mon points out that I have
118:34 - selling England by the pound which is
118:36 - one of my favourite albums I don't
118:38 - actually know that album so I'm gonna
118:39 - have to check it out
118:48 - so if you guys aren't familiar with this
118:50 - what I have here is rune Matson's
118:54 - programming design systems book which is
118:56 - excellent I also have to do my physical
119:02 - therapy exercises it's put a lot of
119:04 - times we've been here for four hours
119:06 - I forgot to add an email I was supposed
119:09 - to send I guess I might give myself a
119:11 - reminder shoot I have too much this is
119:14 - I'm overwhelmed it's tough to do this
119:25 - just sending myself a reminder by
119:28 - Genesis okay this is oh by the way this
119:32 - waiting music is awesome Lee long cuz I
119:34 - can't because I've been streaming for
119:35 - four hours I could say things like
119:37 - awesomely now the marathon next Friday
119:46 - by the way I'm gonna do an Alexa skill
119:48 - and classes in es6 so I kind of have
119:53 - that planned actually so that's coming
119:55 - next Friday
119:58 - alright this is kind of like showing up
120:03 - okay alright here we go everybody
120:14 - hello Ukraine what time is it isn't in
120:18 - the Ukraine everyone's saying I'm sorry
120:22 - for all the people who like I'm making
120:23 - you stay awake go to sleep sleep is
120:27 - important whoops and you will certainly
120:31 - wake up to be able to watch this why do
120:36 - you do so much p5 in so a little
120:37 - processing lately that's a very valid
120:39 - question yeah kind of like the fact that
120:40 - I can just share this stuff on the web
120:42 - really easily but I would like to do
120:46 - more stuff in processing so you know try
120:48 - to think about that okay alright here we
120:53 - go
120:56 - hello this is a video tutorial about
121:00 - custom shapes and I am showing you on
121:03 - this webpage
121:03 - a much better explanation of how custom
121:06 - shapes that I will give you this is
121:08 - actually rune Matson's online book
121:10 - called programming design systems I
121:12 - think I might have referenced this
121:13 - before it's got an excellent chapter on
121:15 - color at rune mattes and on twitter rune
121:19 - is amazing there's lots of really
121:20 - interesting stuff with graphic design
121:21 - and code for graphic design and so this
121:24 - this web page really will walk you
121:26 - through the this idea of how you can
121:29 - think about a shape as having different
121:31 - vertices again this is not my work this
121:33 - is room Madison's work but this is what
121:35 - I want to cover what does this kind of
121:37 - code mean and even better like what are
121:40 - some things you can do with that so I
121:42 - will let you I'm gonna link to this page
121:44 - you can just stop watching this video
121:46 - and click on it and read it but if you
121:48 - want to keep watching I'm gonna kind of
121:49 - give you my own take on this sort of
121:50 - stuff okay now there's a so what I'm
121:53 - talking about is custom shapes so whoops
121:56 - to click over here what I'm talking
121:59 - about is custom shapes so what do I mean
122:01 - by custom shapes so you might be
122:03 - familiar with a rectangle looks like
122:07 - this or perhaps a circle also known as
122:10 - an ellipse which looks like this there
122:13 - is a line which looks like this and a
122:15 - point which looks like this and a
122:17 - triangle which looks like this and I
122:20 - think this might be everything so there
122:21 - are a list of defined primitive shapes
122:25 - primitive geometry set kinds of polygons
122:28 - set kinds of shapes that you could call
122:30 - the function and drawn p5 but you might
122:33 - want to draw this shape because this is
122:37 - the most glorious shape ever drawn house
122:41 - is a terrible example time out it's
122:44 - gonna disappear in a second so this is
122:47 - gonna you can just do a magic edit point
122:49 - where this goes away and while I erase
122:52 - this Matt you gonna be working overtime
122:56 - I get I don't need to do a live stream
122:59 - next Friday cuz this is like five
123:01 - million hours long
123:09 - okay let's start with something simpler
123:11 - what if I wanted to do this shape so
123:15 - this shape is we can think of as a
123:18 - polygon a shape with many sides and a
123:21 - polygon can be defined by its vertices
123:23 - the vertices being each of these points
123:25 - that connects the sides and this is
123:27 - actually one two three four five so
123:30 - actually if you have a polygon with four
123:31 - arbitrary signs like this you can
123:35 - actually do this with the quad function
123:37 - the quad function 2p5 are processing
123:40 - both of all this codes for processing or
123:42 - p5 allows you to specify four points but
123:46 - what I want to do is make a custom shape
123:47 - so the only way for me to do this that I
123:49 - know of at least is to use a function
123:51 - called begin shape and use a function
123:57 - called n shape so if I use these
124:00 - functions begin shape and end shape what
124:03 - I can do is do in between begin and end
124:07 - I can set any number of arbitrary
124:09 - vertices so I can say vertex vertex over
124:16 - and over again now I could do this if
124:18 - fur and processing this will actually
124:19 - also work in 3d and there's a piece
124:21 - shape object and all sorts of fancy
124:23 - stuff you could do but I just want to
124:25 - look at it from the simple 2d lens that
124:27 - we were doing in p5 and so um so this is
124:30 - the basic idea
124:31 - begin shape and this indentation is
124:33 - unnecessary I'm putting it there just
124:35 - sort of for visual effect but this is
124:37 - the idea now so let's take a look at
124:39 - that and make sure it works so I'm gonna
124:43 - come over here and whoops sorry
124:46 - everybody that's the wrong window I'm
124:47 - gonna say begin shape and I'm gonna say
124:50 - vertex I'm just gonna make up some
124:52 - points 150 vertex 224 at X 200 100 uh
125:01 - vertex 50 I'm not very good at picking
125:03 - numbers I need my random number book
125:05 - vertex 25 50 I've no idea what I've just
125:10 - done let's say n shape and now I'm gonna
125:12 - hit refresh and look there it is so in
125:16 - theory that's my shape and I wasn't very
125:19 - thoughtful
125:19 - about the vertices and the order the
125:21 - order does really matter and we can see
125:23 - if I did something weird with the order
125:24 - because this shape can be filled or
125:26 - stroked in the same way that by that I
125:30 - mean setting the outline color or the
125:32 - fill color so I could say stroke 255 and
125:37 - fill no film just to sort of see no Phil
125:40 - Phil no Phil no Phil no Phil for you we
125:46 - can see I am so that's it so look at
125:47 - that so I maybe I didn't do anything too
125:49 - crazy those are all the points notice
125:50 - how you could with no fill you can
125:52 - actually think of this as a path so it
125:54 - could be a shape that's filled and
125:55 - enclosed or it could be a path and
125:57 - incidentally it if I wanted to close it
126:00 - right I could say oh let me put the
126:01 - first point again now it's closed but
126:04 - that's kind of silly right what actually
126:06 - I can do is just write the argument
126:08 - close in here and now you can see it
126:12 - closed it automatically but I'm going to
126:14 - take that out now one thing I should
126:16 - mention is there actually is other stuff
126:18 - that can go in here maybe I need to come
126:20 - back in a whole separate video to go
126:22 - through all those possibilities but I
126:23 - can specify the kind of shape like if I
126:26 - there's something called a triangle
126:27 - strip which likes if I give it a whole
126:29 - bunch of points it'll put a whole bunch
126:30 - of triangles in between all of those
126:32 - things and I have a feeling that if I go
126:34 - to I'm gonna go to the processing
126:35 - documentation because I know that'll
126:37 - come up begin shape processing we could
126:41 - see a lot of those possibilities here
126:43 - right lines triangles like now if I use
126:47 - those points it's not one shape but it's
126:48 - through every three vertices we'll make
126:50 - a separate triangle triangle strip we'll
126:52 - connect it with a bunch of triangles
126:53 - triangle fan you could use quads you can
126:56 - use and I think I use this in like the
126:59 - Perlin noise terrain challenge and a
127:01 - bunch of my different coding challenges
127:02 - but I'm gonna be in this video I just
127:04 - want to keep things simple and I just
127:07 - want to use vertex so there we go so
127:11 - that's the idea now there's two things
127:14 - that I want to mention here number one
127:15 - is what would be interesting for me to
127:17 - do is come up with an algorithm that
127:19 - sets all these vertices you know what's
127:21 - the point really of me manually setting
127:23 - these vertices more likely I might want
127:25 - to do something like I'm gonna do this
127:26 - really quickly like what if I were to
127:28 - say for let
127:33 - a equals zero and okay so incidentally
127:36 - I'm using a for loop so for some reason
127:37 - to watch this video before I used for
127:39 - loop you have to go back and watch the
127:40 - Lupus video I should probably just stop
127:42 - saying that I'm gonna say a is less than
127:44 - 360 a plus equals ten and then what I'm
127:49 - gonna do and this is I'm gonna use
127:50 - something called polar to Cartesian
127:51 - coordinate transformation this is a
127:53 - little bit of an aside but this is worth
127:54 - it I don't know if this is worth doing
127:56 - I'm gonna say let X equal just to
127:59 - demonstrate the idea 100 times sine of a
128:02 - let y equals 100 times cosine of a plus
128:09 - 200 plus 200 and then I'm gonna say
128:14 - vertex I have a reason why I'm doing
128:17 - this actually I'm gonna say vertex XY
128:19 - let's just see what happens
128:21 - yeah I got something crazy I said all
128:24 - these vertices all of the place so what
128:26 - I'm actually doing is something called
128:27 - polar to Cartesian coordinate
128:28 - transformation I link to a video that
128:31 - goes over into more detail but basically
128:32 - if I have this angle a what I want is to
128:36 - just keep changing that angle a to set a
128:38 - whole bunch of vertices around the
128:40 - circle and I can use cosine and sine
128:41 - trigonometry math to get all those
128:43 - points and I'll link to a video that
128:44 - goes through that in more detail but one
128:48 - of the reasons why this worked really
128:49 - weirdly is I didn't set the angle mode
128:52 - to degrees because I'm thinking about
128:55 - the full way around the circle is 360
128:57 - degrees and it's using a radians which
128:59 - is a different by default different form
129:01 - of measurement so now we can see there
129:03 - it is and I want to say close so now I
129:08 - want it let me actually say let spacing
129:12 - equal 50 I'm gonna have this be spacing
129:15 - and we can see that's what I get now
129:17 - then what's interesting about this is
129:19 - I'm now going to put this into draw
129:27 - and I can have spacing be variable so
129:32 - I'm going to say spacing equals and I
129:34 - just did that's how I did this far Matic
129:35 - motion challenge it was a disaster I
129:37 - could have that value oscillate oh let's
129:39 - do this I'm off the beaten path this is
129:41 - really just a tutorial about custom
129:43 - shapes but I'm gonna use a sine wave in
129:45 - it might be a bad idea but I'm just
129:47 - gonna do it anyway so I'm gonna say I'm
129:50 - gonna I'm gonna have a variable called T
129:54 - and was set equal to zero
129:56 - Len Len Len Len let me be more simple
129:59 - about this
129:59 - okay let's spacing equal map mouse X
130:03 - which goes between zero and width two
130:06 - between what I want the spacing to be
130:11 - like at five degrees and 100 degrees so
130:15 - let's at least see this work whoa oh I
130:18 - forgot to draw the background in here so
130:21 - let me put the background in draw so you
130:24 - can see right I'm getting I'm changing
130:29 - that angle so I'm slowly increasing the
130:31 - resolution in the circle so the point
130:33 - that I wanted to show this to you is not
130:34 - because this is some beautiful pattern
130:36 - that you should use but the reason why
130:38 - you might use custom shapes and said
130:40 - vertices is actually gonna have an
130:41 - algorithm to find those vertices so what
130:44 - if you wanted to make a bubble a cloud
130:45 - so I actually have a coding trained
130:47 - community project about making a cloud
130:49 - which I'll also link to in here which
130:51 - this could form the basis I think I've
130:53 - done stuff with a curly noise blob
130:55 - coding challenge at one point that this
130:57 - also relates to so there's a lot of
130:59 - possibilities here what I was gonna do
131:00 - was use a sine wave to have this feel
131:02 - like it's breathing SPAC and forth back
131:05 - and forth so that's maybe at something
131:07 - that you should try as an exercise after
131:09 - this video so what I want to do I'm
131:12 - going to leave this here but I'm gonna
131:14 - comment this out again and I want to
131:16 - just talk about one other thing so here
131:20 - we go remember this weird shape that I
131:22 - created this shape is a polygon that has
131:26 - a set of vertices but in addition to
131:28 - vertex there's actually something called
131:30 - curve vertex that I can call
131:33 - now there's also something called bezzie
131:35 - a vertex and bezzie a vertex is a kind
131:37 - of curve vertex for a special
131:39 - a curve called a Bezier curve and
131:40 - actually the patrons custom shaped page
131:43 - goes through that in detail I'm gonna
131:45 - say Bezier curves for like another video
131:47 - because I don't know if I understand
131:48 - that at this moment so I have to go read
131:50 - runes excellent description and then
131:52 - come back to it but curve vertex what
131:56 - curve vertex does is it says instead of
131:58 - having like a hard edge here let's try
132:00 - to curve around that edge but here's the
132:03 - thing I should probably make this a
132:04 - separate video but I'm in this video so
132:06 - you have to be watching all the way the
132:08 - end of this video here's the thing
132:11 - that's tricky and I'm gonna there's
132:13 - gonna be some magic erasing in a second
132:14 - that's gonna happen here
132:16 - so much yeah you can edit out this
132:18 - erasing because one of these days I'm
132:22 - gonna figure out like a good way to
132:23 - erase that's not tissues this is
132:27 - horrible what I'm doing today
132:41 - okay back so one of the trickiest things
132:44 - about working with curves is that you're
132:46 - gonna suddenly discover when use curve
132:48 - vertex points just disappear why so
132:53 - let's imagine that I have these three
132:57 - points oh okay
133:00 - now I might say to myself like oh of
133:02 - course this is what I want the curve to
133:04 - be a time out this wall is kind of wet
133:13 - so I forgot that I sprayed water on it
133:16 - so it doesn't work to draw on it if it's
133:18 - wet let's say that I have these three
133:25 - points these three maybe this marker
133:28 - died we just wait
133:34 - is it the marker or is it the the marker
133:37 - kind of got wet too
133:38 - okay but if I use it it's better okay
133:40 - we're gonna wonder what those circles
133:42 - are doing over there let's say I have
133:46 - these three points now we could look at
133:49 - this and we could say to ourselves like
133:51 - I kind of know what I meant I want to
133:54 - draw this curve but if you think about
133:57 - it more there's actually no way for the
133:59 - computer to know how to draw this curve
134:02 - without more information because why
134:05 - couldn't it be like this or something
134:10 - that's that's a little bit weird let me
134:12 - try that again
134:13 - why couldn't it be like this this would
134:17 - be a valid curve and the difference is
134:19 - how do I enter the curve I've had it in
134:22 - a poor job of drawing this but I think
134:23 - the next thing I'm going to do is and
134:24 - make it more clear what if there was
134:26 - like a secret point right over here that
134:28 - said how to enter this curve or the
134:30 - secret point was over here that send out
134:32 - an edge of the curve and up here it
134:33 - would be over here right this is gonna
134:35 - look different if there's so curves
134:39 - require additional points that control
134:42 - the entry and exit of the curve do I
134:46 - should I need to curve and like come
134:48 - down here do we need to curve and like
134:49 - end up
134:50 - over here and so it can be really
134:52 - confusing and but you have to be aware
134:55 - of this so let's actually go and look at
134:56 - the code and see if we can make this
134:57 - work and let me simplify things actually
135:02 - let me actually make up some specific
135:04 - vertices so I'm gonna say vertex what
135:08 - what's the size of the window it's 200
135:10 - 200 so I'm going to say vertex 10 200
135:15 - 150 and then and let's actually make
135:19 - this 100 200 and then 300 200 oh and I
135:24 - don't know what I'm doing and putting it
135:25 - all in one line vertex I don't know can
135:27 - you see this bottom down here I want
135:29 - three vertices okay and now let's take a
135:35 - look at this oh do I have clothes I want
135:39 - to take out clothes and I messed up the
135:42 - middle one I want this to be at 200 so
135:45 - this is those are my three vertices so I
135:47 - want to make this a curve so a couple
135:51 - things one is let me just draw these
135:53 - points so we can see them separately
135:59 - also 300 200 I mean this is very
136:04 - redundant what I'm doing but
136:06 - strokeweight 4 and then stroke whoops
136:12 - then let's do stroke weight 1 ok so I
136:18 - can see points there so I'm gonna change
136:20 - this the curve vertex and you're gonna
136:22 - see what I need curve vertex and I don't
136:30 - see anything anymore
136:31 - now I should have done this with more
136:34 - than I should do this with 4 points so
136:37 - let's make this one 50 50 and 250 like
136:44 - 60 or something so you're gonna see oh
136:47 - boy let's and that's also my apologies
136:51 - let's also put these as the actual
136:54 - points were drawing
136:59 - and where where does this go whoops what
137:03 - would I say one fifty one fifty fifty
137:06 - and two fifty sixty so you can see these
137:13 - points are actually controlling how this
137:16 - curve looks and there could be many more
137:17 - points it's just controlling the entry
137:19 - of the curve so like what if I made this
137:21 - point Mouse X Mouse Y this is what I'm
137:23 - trying to demonstrate Mouse X took me a
137:25 - while to get to this but Mouse X Mouse Y
137:27 - and now I'm gonna make that first point
137:30 - Mouse X Mouse Y so you can see as I move
137:35 - this around it changes the zoom in a
137:38 - little bit more it changes the entry to
137:41 - the curve and actually this is an
137:43 - interesting way to make something
137:44 - interactive like imagine of this
137:46 - oscillated up-and-down it's almost like
137:48 - this wiggling string or something so
137:50 - again as you're building these custom
137:52 - shapes this shape now is only those two
137:54 - points right if I were to say close you
138:02 - know Oh interestingly enough it's like I
138:04 - look it actually connected it all the
138:06 - way around to the first point so the
138:08 - first point is controlling wow this is
138:09 - kind of crazy this is kind of a nice so
138:11 - you can imagine creating some
138:12 - interesting animation by just wow
138:15 - clothes really made the interesting if
138:18 - you do close this whole problem kind of
138:20 - goes away I don't the problem but it
138:21 - doesn't enter it comes around to the end
138:23 - so that's kind of interesting I just
138:24 - discovered that now so you can see the
138:26 - difference if I use clothes because it
138:29 - adds the point another thing that you
138:30 - can do often which is sort of the same
138:33 - thing is I could duplicate the last
138:35 - point twice so that's sort of like I
138:39 - that last point is also the control
138:42 - point for yourself so you can see it's
138:44 - not changing but I am including the
138:46 - first point twice so I could do that
138:48 - also like I could include the first
138:50 - point twice instead of Mouse X Mouse Y
138:52 - and now I kind of have whoops whoops I
138:56 - that's not the first point I could sorry
139:00 - if there was a different first point
139:02 - which was originally one hundred two
139:08 - hundred right so if I'd have that twice
139:11 - and get rid of Mouse
139:13 - that's why this can also be a strategy
139:16 - so it's kind of like just duplicate the
139:18 - first point and duplicate the last point
139:19 - but you don't have as much control I
139:21 - would need yet another point right like
139:23 - this point the mouse to control that so
139:29 - you can see now I could control this
139:31 - with the mouse so there's so many
139:32 - possibilities I'm sorry that I kind of
139:34 - went off the deep end then with like
139:36 - messing around with this but the point
139:38 - is and also incidentally I can mix curve
139:41 - vertex and vertex now let's see if we
139:45 - can make this more obvious or maybe that
139:47 - doesn't work so I'm pretty sure you can
139:49 - do that in processing I'm going to
139:50 - investigate if that works in p5 or not
139:52 - but the idea being that I can mix summer
139:56 - curbs summer jagged so to recap custom
140:00 - shapes are shapes that you just are
140:03 - polygons or paths that you define by a
140:07 - set of vertices you can make you can you
140:09 - can have them be tiled by certain kinds
140:11 - of quad strips or triangle strips or
140:13 - that kind of thing you can have curved
140:14 - vertices or regular vertices curve if
140:17 - you have curved you need to have control
140:19 - points for the curve and the reason for
140:23 - doing that is quite possibly more likely
140:26 - because you want to have something more
140:30 - dynamic oh and look I connected these in
140:32 - this weird crazy way so here's the like
140:34 - ending Frankenstein thing of this like
140:38 - weird hard-coded and circle so I hope
140:41 - you make what if your engine if you
140:42 - don't know what to make from this take a
140:44 - look at the link to the cloud community
140:46 - cloud repository I mean you might be
140:48 - watching this a year in the future
140:49 - hopefully it'll still be there but this
140:51 - is a project that's happening in 2017
140:53 - for processing day which is October 21st
140:57 - 2017 for the name tags in processing day
141:00 - so if you're interested in consuming to
141:01 - that and I hope you enjoyed this
141:02 - tutorial thanks for watching oh I forgot
141:08 - to mention that okay hold on this is
141:14 - somebody mentioned Catmull ROM splines
141:16 - so maybe this can be inserted in there
141:19 - somehow
141:23 - something I want to mention actually
141:24 - before I wrap up with the computer is
141:27 - that you might be asking yourself like
141:28 - well what's the math that calculates
141:31 - this curve well there are different
141:33 - kinds of mathematical functions to
141:35 - figure out how a curve goes between two
141:37 - different points I mentioned a Bezier
141:40 - curve there's a specific kind of bezzie
141:42 - a function and it works pretty
141:43 - differently than this but it it is
141:45 - something you could look at but this is
141:46 - actually known as a Catmull this this is
141:49 - using p5 and use the Catmull wrong
141:53 - spline spline being kind of another word
141:55 - for curve and it these are people's
141:57 - names who came up with this algorithm so
141:58 - I'll try to include a link to a
142:00 - historical information about the Catmull
142:02 - Rohm spline and I apologize if I I spell
142:05 - that or said that wrong Thanks okay all
142:14 - right all right everybody I met you
142:16 - maybe you can splice that little
142:18 - explanation in there or we could just
142:19 - leave it out it doesn't really matter
142:22 - but likes place it not at the very end
142:24 - but like after I was there and then I do
142:27 - that and then I came here and wrapped up
142:28 - all right everybody it is 8:05 this is
142:31 - for our live stream cat bowl is a name
142:34 - yes I I don't think I can do anything
142:38 - else today that Lisa Zhu curve thing I
142:42 - don't know if it could be made into a
142:43 - video
142:44 - I don't like it remind me later goodbye
142:49 - thank you for tuning in judo network's
142:52 - down very funny
142:53 - Allen and I hope you enjoyed this live
142:57 - stream I'm pretty exhausted I will be
142:59 - back next Friday even though now I feel
143:01 - like it did to live streams in one day
143:02 - and I could text Friday off and OH
143:10 - people want to see so I'm gonna release
143:12 - the trailer so if people want to watch
143:14 - the trailer should I just do that right
143:16 - now I'm gonna release it as soon as I
143:19 - turn off the live stream I'll release
143:20 - the trailer
143:21 - and then these will be edited and that
143:24 - sort of thing I'm sorry I really I just
143:27 - I just have to go that's for the son
143:31 - thank you everybody
143:33 - choo choo 273 that is a random number
143:37 - for you all my Jake I can't do any more
143:39 - I'm exhausted
143:40 - 8 o'clock it's like my bedtime in 15
143:42 - minutes and I will release the trailer
143:45 - as soon as I shut off this livestream
143:47 - thank you everyone for watching and
143:50 - we'll see you next Friday on the coding
143:52 - train probably around the same time
143:53 - hopefully a little bit earlier because
143:55 - actually I have somewhere to be at 6
143:57 - p.m. Eastern time next Friday so I'm
143:59 - hoping maybe I'll start at 2 or 3
144:00 - o'clock in the afternoon okay and this
144:04 - was upstream livestream number 101 and
144:06 - I'm just I don't have a better way of
144:08 - ending this I guess I could play the
144:09 - trailer one more time at the end now
144:11 - nobody wants to see that I'll just
144:12 - release it you can watch it yourself
144:13 - okay here we go
144:14 - goodbye good night good morning wherever

144:20 - machine learning it's just going to be a
144:21 - while

Cleaned transcript:

okay I'm back I I don't know what to blame this on other than my own incompetence probably but I was having trouble in getting these Blackmagic devices to be detected by the computer again OBS really has been very kind to me and has had no problems so hopefully this isn't gonna be and I forgot what I was talking about it anybody remember the last thing that I said Oh No crashed oh my god look nobody back whoa okay that was like a momentary hiccup whoa OBS is now like showing me a video of myself from a moment ago it's like behind how can I fix that wonderful just cuz that's so weird alright as long as the people can hear and see me I'm gonna just keep going can you hear and see me is the is everything like out of sync in a weird way does anybody know what I was last saying oh I don't have the live chat up let me go to here see if this is actually working okay I now have a live chat I don't see anybody saying that they're seeing me and it's working it is back hi Dan and chat can somebody in the slack Channel tell me if things are okay I don't want to go unless I know things are working I think you guys are seeing me it is working okay great I think I think you might be way behind real time like a minute behind cuz that took a really long time for people to say it's working but it is working okay all right all right I this is driving me crazy that what I'm seeing on my monitor is like behind the realtime but I'm gonna have to just live with that Oh 545 okay we're gonna do simple harmonic motion Oh audio is out of sync very out of sync hold on let me see if I can fix that okay okay I think I fixed the out of sync problem I hope let's see how bad the thinking is I need something to clap along too how Bad's the audio sync now fixed okay I'm gonna drink some water I really need another coffee but it's not gonna happen or like something real like sugar snack I hope it doesn't freeze again yeah I know about the audio offset I've already actually set the offset is that is the thing coke is it it's pretty much okay though now right now it's fine okay great let's do this let's keep going I don't know which I'm gonna just play all these hello welcome to a coding challenge this is gonna be a pretty simple one and I'm curious to see what types of beautiful experiments people who watch this video will create after this video and if you've been wondering about the sine function and the cosine function how to use those functions for a motion in code then you're in the right place so this video is inspired by this tutorials inspired by the artist memo Acton who created a series of works about simple harmonic motion you can see here this this and these are actually all sound pieces so I encourage you to actually check them out and check check them out and actually listen to the sound but you can see each one of these circles is moving back and forth evenly but they're all offset from each other and this is kind of what I want to do in this video is in a really simple way just to have one of these moving back and forth and what can you create from that and if I scroll you can see some of these other examples simple harmonic motion number two you can see this is the same idea but with a more thoughtful and sophisticated visual design here's another one that's moved into 3d simple harmonic motion so things you might try to create as a guitar string plucking how would you create the simulation of a guitar string that's plucked or how could you create a simulation of a pendulum swinging what what about a fish swimming on Ã®le moving through the water here's a number five so I would love to show you all of these but I'm going to let you I'm going to put a link to this page in this video's description and hopefully you'll create something I just burped at the middle my video also something is driving me crazy the way I have I got a hit this lock button sorry look notebooks this is gonna have to be an edit point here okay sorry there's gonna be a terrible edit for a port that's yet hopefully you'll create something creative you look at these you'll be inspired and use the sine function in your code with simple harmonic motion okay let's keep let's write some code please edit this part up too while I'm trying to find the editor today was going so well it was a day where there were no weird crashing and that's all gone now I think I don't want us to start this whole video over I'm gonna start this whole thing over it's going to torture those of you watching this live but it's gonna be good for the long run for the world flatten the green paper on the second laptop that's probably better right okay let's try this again hello welcome to a coding challenge where I'm gonna make something very simple for the beginner just a simulation of simple harmonic motion and this coding challenge is inspired by the artist memo Acton who has a series of works about simple harmonic motion you can see here their musical works this idea of a simple oscillation back and forth so think of a guitar string plucking and/or a pendulum swinging and I encourage you to check out all of these beautiful this is one of my favorite ones which is sort of a mockup for a live performance of just this idea of a simple oscillation up and down and what happens when there are many of these next to each other what types of patterns can you create and so just even going down further through these I encourage you to check out all of these but here's where we can see really really simply just this idea of easing and easing out easing in easing out a wave so to speak a sine wave so you might have seen in p5 or in processing or other things that there's a sine function in a cosine function what are those functions do and how can you apply those functions to motion or color or any other parameters that might be in your system that's what I'm gonna do in this particular video okay so now there's gonna be a little edit point because I'm rethinking I'm gonna drink some water I think that was better cuz it was shorter and I just realized that what I need to do unfortunately is oops my keyboard shortcuts stopped working hold on settings hotkeys switch to scene 1 whiteboard switch to scene where do I have to click for those to work ok so I need to erase the this whiteboard so you guys don't mind bearing with me here oh I know what I was gonna do I forgot I wanted to do a draggable shape coding challenge because that's actually a really tricky thing to do and then I was gonna when I teach classes in es6 I was gonna turn it into an object but make many of them but I don't know if I have time for that that was another thing on my list on the Wikipedia API there's so many things to get to ah need more time in the day and in the live stream whatever okay alright so let's talk about what it is I'm going to use so in p5 or in processing and of course actually in JavaScript I'm in the math package there are functions called sine si n cosine cos these are trigonometric functions they perform a trigonometry functions they relate to triangles a triangle a right they were we try that again I I really shouldn't be allowed to start over so many times so before I start coding let's talk about the functions that are available in p5 also in processing they're just actually part of most programming environments called sine si n for short cosine cos for short these are trigonometry functions trigonometry being the study of the relationship between the sides of a right triangle and the angles of a right triangle so there's an angle here there's a there's an opposite side here there's an adjacent to that angle side here and there's a hypotenuse so I have some videos from my nature of code series that go through the math behind this in more detail and look at actually a whole bunch of different scenarios for simulating pendulums and various things so I'll link to those in this video but I'm actually not even going to worry about trigonometry in this video the reason why I want to use the sine function is if I pass a number if we think of this number like as the axis any number I pass to the sign function as an argument to the sign function will give me a value between plus one and negative one and if that number if I increase that number over time you almost think of it as time or along the x axis that number will the output of that function will oscillate smoothly between 1 and negative 1 and it will move most quickly in the middle and it will slow down as they get to the bottom and so ease in and ease out the sine function has a natural easing in and using out if I were to graph that it's gonna look like this incidentally if you look at my videos about synthesizing sound with the p5 just libraries you'll also use a sine wave to generate a tone and there's different kinds of waves and there's a lot to this but this is the basic idea cosine is exactly the same the only thing that's different is cosine of 0 is 1 cosine of 0 is 0 so it's just starting in a different place a slight offset but we just want the wave quality so for what I'm doing you I could use sine or cosine interchangeably obviously those mathematical functions have you know that scenarios where it's important which one you're picking in this case this is not one of them ok so let's see what happens when we add this into our code right I'm just looking at the chat sohcahtoa yeah that's a good ok we can do that again alright so I have a simple sketch with nothing in it I'm gonna say create canvas to give myself a canvas 400 400 I'm gonna add a draw function so that I can have a nice animation again this is all how the p5 library works the other there's other ways to code in the universe and I'm going to say background 0 and I'm just gonna say fill 255 and I'm gonna draw a circle in the middle of the window just to get something on the screen that I can take a look at and now I'm gonna come over here I can close this I'm hit refresh there we go I have my beautiful this is Challenge complete the circle but I'm gonna keep going so what do I want to do I want to have a variable and I'm now using let's to declare my variables oh just a murder video about why I'm going to say let and actually I'm I'm gonna do this I'm actually gonna make it a local variable to draw on to say let X equal 200 I'm gonna put X in here instead and I should still have the same result excellent okay so I'm just little steps here now what do I want to do what I actually want to do is instead of having X be a hardcoded value I want to have it be the result of the sine function so what do I put inside that sine function well if we think about this what I want is a smoothly oscillating number so I need to pass something to the sine function that moves along through time through the x axis a different value so let me come back over here so I won I need to introduce something I'm gonna call it an angle so I'm gonna say at the top let angle equals zero and I'm gonna say sine of angle so let X equal sine of angle and now I'm gonna look at this sketch and look at this now the circle is over there at the zero pixel because sine of zero is zero what happens if I were to now increase that angle so I want to say angle equals angle plus one because if any value that goes into sine is going to give me something between negative one and one if I increase that value over time I'm gonna get that smooth oscillation so let's look at this now look there's that smooth oscillation here's the thing why is it over there well if you remember the sine function just gives me a value between negative 1 and 1 and now here's the essential question you are going to do something creative with this I've actually given you everything you need to know the question now is what's the context what am i drawing what's my animation what's my idea and what are the ranges of values that I want so I'm gonna keep this very simple and I am going to just say I want this to oscillate left and right so what I need to do is take that range negative 1 to 1 and map it and I do have a video about the math function the map function and let's let's do let's let's do this in two steps so I'm gonna say let's s be the result of sine of angle and I'm gonna say let X equal map that value which has a range between negative 1 and 1 and give it a range between 0 and 400 and I'm gonna say with here instead of 400 psi change the sign of the canvas now this math that map is doing isn't that hard it's just taking that s the value which has that range and giving it a different range I could do this myself if you're curious right I could say let x equals s times 200 plus 200 right because if s is negative 1/2 negative 200 plus 200 is 0 if X is 1 if s is 100 plus joyner is 400 so this would be the math of mapping that range but in case things get more complicated later and the map folks are just so convenient to do this for us ok here we go oh yeah there we go oh look at that so look at it it's just like it's doing that oscillation but it's so fast so this is really well I have to think about how fast am i moving through that oscillation and this is relates to the idea of frequency or period and again a good checks on my nature of code tutorials where I go through that a bit more detail but right now we can just understand it as if I increase angle faster I'm gonna get a faster oscillation but I increase it more slowly I'm gonna get a slower oscillation so now what I'm gonna do and let's make that circle a little bit bigger let's make it 48 let's increase the I said angle is angle plus 1 which sort of makes sense if I were thinking in terms of degrees like zero degrees one degree is degrees but actually the native unit of measurement is something called radians which has a 0 to 360 degrees is there two pi radians which I've talked about in many videos probably so I'm going to say zero point one and now we have look at that it's almost as if it's a swinging pendulum now it's moving along a straight line so it's not moving up and down as it's swinging but you can see this is that nice easing in easing in using out easing out using out easing in easing out easing in using out easing it's very hard to say that what's going by audios I just think this is going to be a disaster so what more can I do with this so now I have to think what should I do with this now this is the idea of simple harmonic motion and so I could add two of these drawed and different like what I might like to do is like make it the middle point of like a curve looking for ideas because maybe I should take this as the end of the challenge in some ways make more with different frequencies that's a good idea pendulum I don't want to do the full pendulum because that's kind of involved yeah the speed and range that's a good idea camera went out so I know what I'm gonna do and I make it feel like a spring draw a line and draw a wave yeah I like I kind of like that idea I want to be able to see the history put a color put it on a curve oh you guys have so many make it rotate in this circle at a ycomponent to me good that's the whole point the point of this is to have you guys do all of these things make it size change oh and like that okay okay everybody hold on so there are so many next steps I could take with this I could put a whole bunch of them here I can have them all kind of moving back and forth it's slightly different rates I could have its color oscillate I could have its size oscillate to make it feel like it's breathing there's so many possibility that people are just writing ideas writing ideas in the live chat right now so I encourage you in some ways just to pause this video right now and go try some of these ideas out what I'm gonna let me try to do a few things a little one thing I think would be interesting to try is can I make this feel like a spring so that it's kind of Lading but it oscillates all right am i back what's the chance that I'm back I think I think I should be back this first person who sees that I'm back please let me know in the chat it did this slow chat is it awesome different see so many chat messages my life okay yes I'm back okay what was the last thing that I did I mean I was recording two discs so hopefully the recording two discs still has it gosh I really thought that OBS was gonna be I kind of feel like the thing that I need to do is wipe the computer and re just rebuild the computer update everything I'm looking they just asked a viewer to pause okay alright so I went on for quite a while after that unfortunately so let me let me undo my code oops nope okay so I'm gonna move forward and try to just do one or two more things and ultimately I might even do another video because what I'd really like to do is store the history of the oscillation you can almost see like this wavy line thing but I need an array probably for that and I want this video to be simple with no array to start so anyway let's see what I'm gonna do so what once for a couple things one is that's gonna make things easier there's no reason for me to have such a tall canvas and also I think things are gonna be simpler if I use translate to put the origin in the center of the canvas so that I can think of everything relative to the center so you can see now how it's actually oscillating off to the right because now what I could do is I can actually just say X is the value of sine times 200 right because I just want to and I can even more simply say X equals sine of the angle times 200 right because I just want to oscillate between negative 200 and 200 so this is gonna allow for more possibilities so let's try this let's see first of all let's see if I can make this kind of like oscillate and slowly end up in the center kind of like a spring night so how would I do that well I can't this could be a variable this is known as the amplitude right this value 200 oops sorry this this value 200 is really like the top of the amplitude the height of this curve I mean it's really 400 cuz it goes up to 200 and negative 200 but that aside that's what that value is doing so that could be something variable so I'm going to call that amplitude and I'm going to say let amplitude equal 200 now what I'm going to do is have that amplitude shrink down to zero and I'm going to use the lerp function now you might have to stop and go watch my lerp video if you haven't don't know what that is but that's for linear interpolation meaning it's a way for me to like move towards another value interpolate towards another value by a percentage so let's try having amplitude I don't know what I'm just really making up stuff to interpolate to it to zero between itself and zero by ten percent boy that was way too fast one percent but that's not really what a spring would do right I kind of want the speed of the oscillation to speed up slow down I hope I like this idea did I use var no no I used let I'm yelling did you notice that I'm yelling that's terrible hold on I got to think about what I'm doing here stop for a second it's kind of interesting all I could have the amplitude oscillate yeah that's probably what I should do to get some more interesting I I should just add the Y and yeah let me go back let me forget about that ant so yeah yeah this is better actually like just decrease the amplitude I'm just curious now the amplitude minus equal to that's interesting then it goes up okay I don't like that direction that I went well the thing that I should do is add a Y probably to get some interesting use exponent 2k all these great suggestions that's a really good idea the leader triple a she wasn't really right because I I I'm not really doing I could do it like a spring simulation that's not really what this is I like alka suggestion of Ouranos p5 dojo suggestion of using X X & Y which is rich in crease the speed of the sine wave in time yeah yeah so let's this is actually interesting okay so I don't know where this goes back to okay I know I know so now Mattia this is gonna be challenging but I think you can find it so now I have amplitude but you know there's another variable in this system that variable is this right here point one that's actually relates to the frequency or the period half M is the wave oscillating really really quickly or is it oscillating really really slowly so if I can make that a variable I'm also gonna have more things that I can play with so what I'm gonna do here is I'm going to make that a variable I'm gonna call it let's just call it speed just to be nontechnical for a second let's be equals zero so if I do this it is not oscillating now if I were to say something like speed equals map that Mouse exposition which goes between zero and width to between like you know zero and point five right we can see that is a fast oscillation a faster oscillation a slower so I could slow down that oscillation and speed so this is pretty interesting just in of itself like to be able to control that so what kinds of things can you do to if you control the amplitude and you control the speed let's try adding a Y and I'm going to say let y equals cosine of the angle times amplitude this is going to be an interesting result here I'm going to take out this speed thing and just let it be a constant point one and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to 400 by 400 I'm going to draw this at Y so let's look at what this does now look at this it's moving in a circle because if I oscillate along the x axis and I oscillate along the y axis at the same rate offset by sine and cosine I get exactly circular motion now one thing I might like to do is give this a little alpha and not draw the background so I see the trail and now what happens if I play with the angle here so this the X actually oscillates twice as fast as the Y now we get this nice figure 8 pattern and I think there's a specific pattern I'm gonna look this up called Lisa jus pattern and I'm in a Google image search which looks like this that's what I think of it as this hold on timeout let's look at this Lisa do curve let's go Wikipedia yes all right hold on and should I be able is there like exact math this is a Lisa Juke challenge I just realized there's a good suggestion multiply sign by a value that increases over time and then map it again double helix wait I want to I mean I could just sort of like estimate this right top input signal output signal so there's over so much here so wow you're about is this right oh yeah it's just kind of generically the okay okay let me come back now by playing with the amplitudes and speed of this oscillation in various ways I can get a variety of different patterns and this is essentially what I'm essentially doing is the Lisa jus curve which somehow appeared is another tab that if you were made an edit point there which is really the graph of these equations x equals sign of overtime plus some offset y with some amplitude y equals sine of some value by some other amplitude without the offset so and we can pick lots of different values for these constants oh let's actually let's put these let's click let's make these variables so what do I have I have an amplitude along the a the the xaxis and an amplitude along the y axis we're gonna do this this this is now the Lisa Zhu curve challenge so I'm gonna say amplitude I'm gonna say a equals 200 let B equals 200 now I probably shouldn't be using capital letters I kind of don't like that a amplitude a and then I'm gonna say amplitude B okay so I'm gonna have two different amplitudes x equals amplitude a times sine of the angle and I'm gonna I'm gonna follow the and y equals amplitude B times and I'm going to keep with sine sine of the angle okay okay so now we're starting to let's see what we have here now if we look at this we can see now I'm just perfectly oscillating back and forth along the axis now let's go back to this formula and one of them should have an offset by offset Delta that's a delta correct so I'm gonna say let Delta and I'm gonna call it offset equal I'm going to say offset equal and since we're in Radian let's let's let's actually have angle mode I'm gonna go to angle I'm gonna change angle mode of degrees so I can just think in terms of degrees and I'm gonna have that offset be 90 degrees and I'm gonna have plus Delta Y is plus the offset does technically the X has the offset it shouldn't really matter but I'm going to add that Delta in here and then I'm also going to change the speed now that I'm in degrees to 1 well let's take a look at this an uncaught reference Delta is not defined oh I calls it el offset angle plus offset and now look we have that circle we have it moving and you know if there's a stroke on it which is why you're seeing this almost like my weight I can't say that word moi Rae pattern so what I'm going to do is just turn say no stroke so we can see this nice fuzzy path okay so now with that offset now what do I need I also need something to multiply a is time that's my angle so alpha and beta being constand that's really you can think of those as like frequencies or periods so I'm gonna say I'm going to call it a speed a equals 1 speed B equal 1 I'm gonna make the circle a little bit smaller 2424 and I'm gonna say speed speed a times angle and speed B times angle okay now let's run this and sorry in the wrong place I still just have my thing moving in a circle time out for a second I'm looking at that all right yes don't worry everybody I see what you're asking me now still moving in a circle so now is the time that we can start to be a little bit crazy so first of all I could just try different values like okay let's let me go up here and try an amplitude V of just 100 and its BB of 9 of a 4.3 what pattern do I get now well this is kind of interesting and I'd have to it looks actually like a sine wave but now it's coming back and it's oscillating so what kind of patterns can I get try lots of different values maybe I could make a whole interface where I could change the values over time I could also have color and size oscillating or that sort of thing so oh and a kaiju kaiju minee in the chat is making a good suggestion which is that I could also consider having a background with a little bit of transparency so like over time I'm actually seeing the full and and maybe then now this is a little bit of an aside here but I can give the fill no train you know that and I'm gonna I want to make it like very very little transparency so that it's kind of like an I should say background zero and set up so that I can see kind of over time that path but it's got also kind of fade out over time so I see the current stuff more bright so there's a lot of number one there's a lot of visual stuff that I could add to this a bug change speed to speed a and speed B where did I do that oh look at this oh my goodness no no it's as fine so this speed whoa why is this working that's crazy oh no there's still a speed up here so this is different now I probably I've did some sort of terrible variable naming so these probably shouldn't be called I just didn't want to say alpha because that's the name of a I mean that's not the name of anything alpha and beta it's not syntax highlighting so but maybe that's not a function I was worried about overriding something else called alpha so anyway I probably should have better variable hates but alright so I'm taking suggestions now timeout for a second for things I could add to this can you change the color of the ball depending on its speed yeah change speed to raped thank you so a great suggestion just came into the chat that why don't I change this to I'm just gonna change this to rate so that's kind of the global rate of everything and these are these are altering the the rate of each individual angle so like if I wanted the whole thing just to be able move a lot faster I'm going to change this rate to five and let's run this again of course there's more space in between and then you know so there's a lot to sort of work on here in terms of how it's working visually but and this is probably good enough so okay so I could add sliders to adjust it in real time that's a great suggestion I hope that some of you will do that suggestion I could add I could start playing with color one thing that I think would be interesting though is to think about these parameters as variables that change so even crazily absurdly what if I kind of almost recursively oscillate one of those so what if I say the speed is the result of sine of the angle which goes between negative 1 and 1 and map that speed to between 1 and 5 so now you know that is also that speed itself is oscillating and you can see wow it's kind of kind of spinning out of control and maybe I want to kind of say something like more like between point 1 and 2 and then I could say speed B is between you know 2 and point 1 in the opposite direction and now I don't know what kind of crazy pattern I'm going to I could never expect what it is but you can see those things can themselves be variables and this kind of motion that it's doing is almost insane and I got an unpredictable but I assume that most of you can come up with more clever ways to think about this and the fact that I have the the amplitude of one of those being between 100 is a little bit silly I might as well fill the full screen the full window and I can make this one cosine let's just try this surprised that it started going so crazy let's try some other values and what I wanted to do I want to change that amplitude to 200 all right let's take a look at this this is my this is my Frankenstein crazy Lisa jus curve so I've gone on for too long you see the idea here Alka is making one really good suggestion to chat which I'm gonna try I don't know I don't like the way this is turned I should really plan these why is this so I wouldn't expect it to go so maybe that's what yeah so this is better all right hold on so let me actually change I think it's the speed is almost getting is is being allowed to be too much trying to change this to go to 0 to 1 and actually I could make this rate 1 and that's what I meant to do and have this go between point 1 and 2 and now let's see what this pattern looks like and now I'm going to add some color so let's try to oscillate color and say something like filled a red value of green value and you know let's do a red value 50 and a green value and I'm gonna say let R equal and again I could have values for all of these so I'm just gonna tie it to I'm gonna let me use Mac so if you know I could use math I could use multiply I'm gonna math sine of the angle between negative 1 and 1 to between 0 and 255 and I'm gonna take B here which is for the blue value and do cosign and now we can see I'm gonna get some nice oscillating color as it oscillates and none of these things are synched but this is these are all the possibilities I could change the size so I encourage you if you watch this if you learned anything from this try to make your own version of this maybe you could come up with some actual concept or design idea that informs what it is you're creating with this type of motion okay thank you very much for watching this coding challenge this is where I ended up it's pretty ugly and weird and I hope that after you watch this you will come up with something quite beautiful why does it keep speeding up over time what am i doing that it's doing that this is not the end first of all h HS be like right what am i doing that it's speeding up over time did I do something to the amplitude which I didn't realize right this you're just multiplied by the angle a different amount the angle is going up at a constant rate oh I should really I should start using cons what times it's like 630 this has not been my finest livestream I think CDs saying that a lot right I have to fix this speed equals to somebody help me out here why let's try to understand this why is it moving nice and slow and then over time it's just faster and faster and faster because shouldn't this multiplying by the angle there map cosine check the variables in the console thank you why a console is like I really useful so let me log these let me log let's fix this let's let's come back and make this better right this should go up to two then it should come back down I think the issue to to come all the way back down is it gonna go all the way to point one yeah okay so the values are doing what I expect but the behavior is not and we could just make sure that there's no reason to think that speed B would be doing anything wrong whoops that's fine too all right so I think the issue is that what I probably want to make this better to like kind of do what I'm imagining is actually have let me try it but this is gonna be the most crazy weird an editing job ever so I'm not really happy with how this turned out and I think there's an issue here which you know even though what I'm doing makes sense in terms of those formulas that I ported from Wikipedia I think what I really want to get the behavior that I'm imagining in my head just bear with me for a second that what I actually want is let me try having two separate angle variables oops so let me try having angle one and this is kind of terrible angle a and angle B and let me actually have rate a and rate B and let me instead of this multiplying let me actually treat those separately and I'm gonna say rate a and rate B are some value like this so let's take a look at this now okay what did I miss up Oh an angle a rate a angle B R Appian by the way I guess I could be calling these things X&Y because they're for the X and Y axis and what did I mess up do I have an error angle one is not defined where did I say angle so this should say angle a and angle B angle a angle B angle is not defined line 31 and go hey angle B well I'm losing my mind here so this is doing more what I expect because it's gonna like really really slow down and then it should pick itself back up and so if I were to change these now between like one and ten yeah this is kind of I don't know that this is any better Wow and it's really like it's really consistently making the exact same shape really interesting weird like curvy shape here yeah and there do I have the offset there yeah uh yeah so what's going on here I'm actually this is so I'm actually just back to where I was at the beginning but I'm changing the speed of the circle it's fascinating you're not interested in this at all let's take this whole but I when this coding challenge gets uploaded that whole section will also be gone I should have had a plan I need to temper it it's gonna be great yeah it's a good point in saying like I why am i mapping though I think was a bad idea to try to change the rate mappings sign because ultimately and forget about that digression then I can have this be a UH all these like weird little shapes okay let's let me let me uh forget about that digression that won't make it into the video either I got to stop this one I should just end it where it was I'm going back oh do I have to undo why I really did a lot of wearable stuff to this I could also just try to correct it oh yeah okay this is back to what I had before your it could be from sine adding together over time your rate is not changing at a speed that's perfectly consistent yeah so anyway look if anyone's gonna end where it ended before Chris Rea said Joseph says I agree with you Chris Rea but what did Chris you should work on organizing here what did Chris race that you need get yeah no kidding I can't believe you guys are watching this so horrible I'm gonna do ten print this is just gonna have to be so I'm gonna finish this video again just in case we need a new ending for it so I've really done a horrible job with this like ugly monstrosity that's kind of now spinning out of control but hopefully watching this video you see the pieces of harmonic motion and what you might be able to create I'm gonna come back actually I think I would like to do you know we should do actually let's stop let's do one more thing with this video okay I'm gonna change this let's try to make it a guitar string that flexing that was one of my ideas let's do that so I'm gonna I'm gonna chain I'm gonna get rid of all this oh no no I'm not gonna do that the colors are so ugly to matrix math I was gonna wrap this up this is a terrible idea okay so I'm not very happy with this end result you can see that this I've got this sort of strange behavior with some very ugly colors but hopefully you've gotten the basic idea here of simple harmonic motion the idea of sine and cosine how you can tie that to a value you know you might just think of something a breathing shape of guitar string plucking I'm gonna come back and try to do maybe a different coding challenge that has a bit more direction to it with this and I would look for your suggestions of what might be useful but hopefully you can make something beautiful out of this take a look at that Lisa jus Wikipedia page and think about oscillating motion and make a beautiful design I think about sound size color and something much less ugly and weird than what I made here okay thanks very much for watching yeah this was such a disaster that's one of my worst coding challenges ever I hope that's never sees the light of day alright let's quickly try to salvage things here ten print I'm gonna do ten print and let's run a little server it's already in use why is it already in use I have another window open everybody should unsubscribe to my patreon right now Bernardo says this is my first time watching what's happening it's all meltdown so what's happening you know I get Ning was tutorial about the brick beggar game was so well thought out and paced and everything I'm gonna I'm gonna come back next week and things will be good okay and come back terminal open up this folder sketch okay here we go let's see here getting ready for tender I have the book I have two copies of this book and I really should have it here to hold up but it's downstairs so I feel bad about that but let me see what do I want a reference this looks pretty good let me yeah okay okay I am ready for this coding challenge has a plan it has a purpose it's going to be really short it's gonna inspire lots of creative ideas and it's gonna redeem us good this is my Redemption story I can feel it already let me come over here and erase the whiteboard case I need to use it and match if you're still it when you're watching this later and deciding what to do I don't mind if that simple harmonic motion coding challenge just gets scrapped I could come back and do it again something better people got it's here on the livestream if there's nothing redeemable about it alright I got to do the custom shapes video okay alright okay here we go the cameras are probably gonna shut off in the middle of this I'm kind of I'm sometimes I think if I press the button in the middle it gives it a half an hour all right I'm very excited about this coding challenge this coding challenge is inspired by the book called ten prints which is all about this line of code ten print chr dollar sign 200 5.5 of code for the commodore 64 and this book which is written by by a collaboration of many authors i'll put a link to information about this book the book is available for free as a PDF online I'm looking at the website right now and it's a beautiful book I have two copies of it downstairs I wish I had my one copy to hold up here right now but it really looks at the history of creative computing sort of through the lens of this one line of code for an old Commodore 64 computer so what does this line of code do so here's a nice youtube video I'll link to this as well I'm gonna make this full screen here where you can see it emulator now typing out this line of code and let's see what we get run run it oh there we go look at this we get this interesting maze pattern so let me pause this for a second and let's try to figure out why is this happening so this is the basic programming language I think that's right that's actually one of the first programming languages I ever used when I was probably when I was in I think about third grade on an apple to see I think remember um back with basic programming language lines of code had a line number like the line 10 print says print something out to the screen to the is really just only a text console and then this is print the character either and I'm assuming here that the character 205 in ASCII code is a forward slash and the character 206 in ASCII code is a backward slash so randomly pick up but make this math problem between 2 or 5 point 5 plus 1 I'm either gonna get 206 or 205 so print out either forward slash or back slash slash and then go to 10 so I to recreate this and I'm not the there's examples already been made in processing I'm really just redoing what's already been done from the the publication of this book but I want to do it as a coding challenge and see what kind of creative possibilities emerge because you could this system which has a shape to shapes and probability think of what you could do if you change the way the probability works if you allow it to be controlled if you think about the shapes creatively now that we have canvas and the browser there's a lot of possibilities here so let me and again if I say anything wrong about the Commodore 64 basic and ASCII code I'm sure somebody will correct me in the chat and then I'll come back at the end of this video and correct that okay so let's look let's I need to write a setup function and I'm gonna make a canvas that's 400 by 400 and I'm going to say background 0 just so we can see it easily and I'm gonna go to the browser and I'm gonna unfold screen this and I'm gonna go here and now i have my canvas there we go so what do I want to do first let's figure out how do I draw a forward slash or a backward slash so I could draw it as a line line 0 0 10 10 this is I know that's like a backward slash like that right now I could say line now what do I want if I want to go from the bottom to the top like a forward slash I'm gonna go from 0 10 to 10 zero right forward slash now I've drawn them both there so now what I want to do is I want to say ah maybe how do i do probability so i've done this in a lot of videos and i'm just typing it out and i probably i so let's think about just type this out here this is a way of applying a probabilistic function i don't know that's a good way to say it this is probability in my code because i'm gonna pick on random number between 0 and 1 half the time it's going to be greater than 0.5 half the time it's gonna be less than 0.5 so half the time you learn to draw a backward slash half the time i'm going to draw a forward slash now of course it's doing this over and over again in the same space on top of each other so what I want to do is move forward as if I were a console printing out forward slash backward slash so what I need is some global variables like let X equal 0 let y equal 0 so I'm gonna draw up these at X Y X + 10 y plus 10 I could use a translate or something but let me just do it with offsets at y plus 10 sorry and X plus 10 and Y so just to make sure it's still sort of the same thing but now what could I what do I need to do what if I increase X x equals x plus 10 so every frame I'm going to move to the next spot there we go one line now it's hard to see that all the way across one line all the way across and I lost my train of thought oh you know what's important here I should think of the 10 as some sort of like spate I'm gonna call that spacing so because we might want to change that so I should really use a variable for that and then if X gets to the end if it's greater than width I should reset X back to 0 and have Y increased by spacing so let's look at that there we go I now have 10 print in p5.js now Casey Risa actually has a artwork all about ten print and with a lot of varieties of changing I hold on let me say that again let me pause edit point here Casey Reese 10 print when I saw Casey's show here in New York there was a screen but I guess that's really just from the book yeah this is his website here with stuff about the book all right never mind let me restate that hopefully let this get a little further I still have an X plus ten I think do I have an error oh yeah thank you in the chat I just was told I left the ten here by accident so let me fix that so now here's the thing what's kind of amazing is that simple code created this suddenly quite elaborate beautiful maze pattern and I've you know thank you to the authors of the ten print book for inspiring me when the book came out to like really try this and use this in my teaching I often give this as an assignment to look at the book and try to like invent your own ten print design so how would you invent your own ten print design well what are the parameters of the system one thing is just the spacing so you know I can make space thing equal 50 and that's gonna change things quite a bit let me put it back at 20 just so we can sort of see it a little bit bigger and moves a little bit more quickly but one thing I could do is change the probability so what if I say you know what there's a 90% chance of drawing a backward slash or a forward slash I don't know which ones which a 10% of the other one now we get a pattern that has a certain quality to it because almost all the slashes are back slashes except for every once in a while there's a forward slash that probability could be adjusted with a slider over time I could also think about color you know the other thing here is like what if I just did something like draw a rectangle or not you know even just this idea of each cell on this grid either placing a rectangle there or not I've already got some type of generative constant this is really what I guess what this is is this is an example of computational design or procedural design I have an algorithm that specifies the design you have Salda width wall drawings I'll try to put some linked links to information about the artist Sol LeWitt and his wall drawings is a nice example of this the rules are generating the design and that design could be the same every time but with probability it could be different every time so I hope I don't want to go much further with this and change to much more because I would like to see what you do and you could also think by the way you could other thing you could change the way that I'm drawing this is I'm animating it one line at a time without changing the background but you could think about displaying it all at once or animating it in a different way from the center so there's a lot of possibilities there too so I hope that you will create your own 10 print design you will share it with me on Twitter or in the comments and then you can also submit it as a pull request to the readme file that's associated with this sketches code and I'll include a link to that also in this video's description so hold on one second did I mess anything up about my Commodore 64 and explaining the basic programming language I'm looking in the chat so why is it that so I'm so I'm noticing in the chat first of all people are complaining that I'm not using contest you're never gonna you're never going to get me to use Const here but let's look at the ASCII table so did the ASCII table change wears forward slash 47 and backward slash is 92 so why what did I miss why is it 205.50 someone's gonna explain this to me in a second because I want to get this is important I think and then I could see this like K week bun is typing me I am so Mia's typing I see this is typing in that patron slack root cause I'm also looking at that YouTube chat here but special Commodore 64 only car set okay so maybe that's what it is commerce 64 do not use ASCII okay great so what where's the good place for me important important correction it turns out that the Commodore 64 did not use the ASCII table as we know it today it has its own character set that's why cuz the ASCII code for a backslash is like 42 or 92 or 97 that's not that yeah I could look it up at an ASCII table but it doesn't match 205 and 206 so I did get that wrong in my earlier explanation I'm singing the chants the extended ASCII table so I didn't see any other Corrections I think I mostly got everything else right in this video and so please share with me your 10 print designs check out the book ten print thank the authors of the book for the great work that they did to talk about the history of this line of code and how it relates to creative component computing composing goodbye I'll see you in another coding challenge thanks well that's a great idea Iran and the chat says make a ten print out of a given image so that's kind of a cool idea all right it is six fifty let me check my phone see if there are any emergency things going on that I don't know about I paid my AT&T bill that's good I have eight maybe I should switch spoiler alert that's my that's not a spoiler alert I kind of want to really want to redeem myself here let's look at my original list from today okay wow the API stuff shoot so what am I willing to try to do before I leave this was a disaster come back to that another time I did ten print I don't know that I want to do the wind data I definitely don't wanna do the matrix math this was a suggestion by Simon that I will I've got to think about some more and this is stuff for later do I have it in me could definitely do the custom shapes not the wiki API what's wrong with that what could be I don't have a video tutorial about using it and it could be quite useful I do have an example let me go look at the example just see github.com this is for one of my classes I was gonna try to make a Wikipedia like crawler where it would you type in a word it goes to that article and then it finds a link to another article and link to another article so it's almost like an exquisite corpse like random sequence that's what I was thinking to make that's what I was thinking to make I want to look at my Wikipedia code one of the things why I like using the Wikipedia API is that you don't have to authenticate to it so this is search for a particular article and then I do something where I get the data from that article hmm alright everybody use arcs please what was on the straw poll all right let's try HSB that harmonic motion thing has got to just get tossed when we try to do some more stuff so let's strawpoll this I might try to do both of these which which one first customshape tutorial that actually really do cuz it's relevant to the clouds thing you kind of need it for the clouds things vertex curve vertex and Wikipedia crawler I kinda want a different name for that Wikipedia I guess it's a crawler I would like to try to do both of these this has been a very long livestream but I feel like I'm gonna need a quick break to use the bathroom so Q learning oh yeah that's definitely gonna happen right now so this is the new straw poll w1e 8xk ax just in case i can only do one and curious what people think so I'm going to I'm gonna cause you all to crit maybe some of you didn't see that see the the try play the trailer again for those of you can get to see it earlier why take a quick pee break good idea bad idea I do a straw poll for that it's writing straw poll if you're gonna pick what you want later it's a very very valid criticism and I apologize that I didn't actually do what was on the straw poll but I was a little so maybe I shouldn't trailer okay so I'm gonna play this trailer a while and see it's 1 minute long I'm gonna mute the microphone when I play it because otherwise it'll be embarrassing and I'm gonna see if I can make it back within one minute otherwise it's just going oh it's just gonna go to black at the end there's gonna be some black nothingness until I get back but I think I could pee within one minute we're gonna see it says this is the pee challenge my son loves this joke which I won't tell right now okay I'm gonna tell it there's a student in the class who's learning about the alphabet and the teacher says student please recite the alphabet and the soon I really really really have to go to the bathroom well recite the alphabet first a a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o q I ruined the joke ABCD efg hijk LMNOP QRS TUV wxy and z now i know my abc is one time won't you sing with me and the teacher says what happened to the p and the student says it's halfway down my leg I don't have the padam Chun terrible that's the old joke o people know that joke okay here we go ready for the trailer that's a here we go 1 2 3 I can make it I'm also I got to mute the microphone hit the trailer and be back pick you up at the station we'll make our own creation you you I'm back okay did I hopefully I'm moving my microphone correctly I'm noticing that this mic is actually in like a horrible position on my shirt surprised that people could actually hear me it was like pointed down so hopefully the audio is fine maybe the audio is a little bit quiet can we fix that all right almost in time the cringe is real I should just release that video now but I'm gonna release that after it okay so let's look at the results here well only it no way look at this coding trim history 66 well 166 people voted on this which is kind of amazing and I got exactly 50 50 did you guys play is this like a trolling me sort of thing let's refresh the results oh we got one more wait that's weak one more for the Wikipedia crawler fascinating oh so you know what this means you know what this means everybody it's time for the spinning wheel Schiffman and I could use a lot of contributions to make this better github io / randomizer custom shapes customer shapes custom shapes Wikipedia alright here we go we are going to spin this wheel we're gonna figure out which one to do I must by the way I can do the straw poll and then not listen to the straw poll but I cannot do the spinning wheel and not listen to the spinning wheel I have to obey the spinning wheel so I'm just gonna keep pressing this button and then at some point I will stop here we go Wikipedia custom shape apparently you can't blow air and wind onto a simulated arrow thing that's not even on a screen because this is a green wall but I just try no oh my goodness oh my god guess what everybody I apologize if you're in the patron chat I am it wasn't scrolling so I missed I missed all these messages creative composing composting etc etc six degrees of Kevin Bacon fluids haha force Isis I'm just checking trolling successful they have no wheel ok the 200 the 2000 the bitrate yeah I should try it let me try changing the bitrate cuz why not let me just try that right now since I'm like three hours into this stream output output streaming I'm gonna try changing the bitrate to 5000 I don't know if it'll really do that in realtime but let's try like I just changed look at the straw poll again I just changed the bitrate a custom shape is but by one vote you know we got to go with the wheel look that's amazing alright well I'm gonna do both let's do though Wikipedia first cuz it'll take forever and then I'll be it'll be a disaster and I'll be motivated to do the custom shapes thing again ok so let's try to create let's I'm so hungry I need to eat some dinner I need more coffee and I should not be doing this right now it's 7 o'clock I have to leave at 730 745 desktop p5 generate be Wikipedia crawler then what I want to do is CD Wikipedia crawler atom then what I need to do is go to the go to the desktop I'm already in this and I need to quit my old terminal thing that I had open because I can never seem to and run a serverside in my history yep okay then what I need to do is look at the Wikipedia API documentation which is here I think oh boy oh boy oh boy oh I don't like this at all oh wait I don't like this documentation okay getting text messages that I can't respond to right now no canvas okay I might just have two equals and search equals there's a mistake in my code let's look at this search equals rainbow okay great so this gives me a search for all the articles that have rainbow and then it looks at gives me the content for the mean oh no it gives me like a gives me like a one sentence about each of these so now if I want to look at an actual article I'm just gonna I I've waded through this documentation before and I don't want to have to do that again so I want to do this content action equals query profit equals revision this is weird this is the callback for the article content but how do I know which article it is oh and titles equals the article got it got it got it got it got it got it got it so now I also need to say and titles I think I can do multiple ones but so yeah this gives me all the content on the rainbow page title rainbow and if I did like rainbow trout right rainbow trout and then this is like finding other titles right okay this good night Simon you've been very very very very quick makeup bot to play the game that wicked game oh my god it's 1 a.m. it's what we're excitement is thank you for watching Simon I'm sorry that this has gone on so late I hope this has been helpful and useful and interesting for you ok alright where are we let's see ok so I think I'm good I just want to have these in I'm just gonna put these in my code already because there's no way I'm gonna be able to remember them and that is fine okay all right here we go everybody we're gonna do a Wikipedia thing there's a South Korean band called rainbow cool alright so this is the documentation oh this is the documentation this is better yeah this is what I want to look at this is actually what I meant to look at titles equals main page pro right okay so alright so let me close all this close this and localhost this open this alright here we go everybody ready for this I'm just trying to make crazy amount of content quantity over quality is the name of the game here at the coding train I'm probably not the smartest idea but I can't sometimes I get into this mode where I can't stop can we go hello I am going to do a coding challenge with the Wikipedia API um I don't think I've done this before I'm not exactly entirely sure what I'm going to build in a way it might be better for me to just do a tutorial about the Wikipedia API but let's make this a challenge so this is what I'm thinking there's a lot of interesting things you could do if you can get access to the content of Wikipedia you can make poetry machines and all sorts of experimental text things but one thing I know that people have done effectively is make games that you can play by sort of crawling and moving around Wikipedia and there are lots of interesting examples about that hopefully to get the chat so what I'm going to attempt to do I think is create a sketch where I'm going to say user input I'm going to create a little user input box and I'm gonna say user input equals I'm going to use the p5 function create input so now we should if I go to the code we should have a nice little input box and I'm gonna say and you know what I'm actually gonna do let me do this differently instead of using the create function let me get rid of the styling stuff let me actually put it in the HTML so Wikipedia coding challenge thing I'm hoping that I'll make something kind of onion not interesting sorry I'm hoping that I'm gonna make something not so interesting and that you the viewer will learn and see how I did it but have a more creative and mind to make something more interesting and exciting so I'm gonna say word and then I'm gonna say input ID equals user input input so I just I prefer to like put the the elements that I want on the web page in HTML so now we can see and I so now what I can do instead of this I can say select well time out I'm getting some text messages I have to respond to these if I'm gonna stream past 7 o'clock on a Friday I have to respond to my text messages whether before I shouldn't look at them okay oh great let's see I'll be done soon okay so I'd rather just select it and now we have access to what's written in it in and so what did i do did I do something wrong input is this something wrong with my HTML here oh yeah this should be h1 thank you so there we go so and actually let me make it h2 because it's so large there we go so I want to enter in a word here hello and hit like enter or something so when I hit enter I can handle that event saying user input changed go Wiki so what I want to do is have a function when the user hits enter or tab that that will signal that there's been a change in the text field I could also add a button or something but I'm not worrying about interface design here you could worry about that when you redo what I do and now I'm just going to write a function and I'm gonna call it go wiki and the first thing I want to do is just get what is in that what is in it so first I want to I'm gonna say let word or term or something term equal user input value console dot log term I don't know what I just did there but okay okay so again this is my sort of friendly style of writing JavaScript you could do this in 15 different other ways that's what i'ma do the other thing I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna add rainbow in here so it's that's not right I guess I say value equals rainbow so it's in there and then changed of null so the idea here is user input and then in here I said select Oh user input so it'd be nice if I put an ad in there so there we go okay so now if I hit enter tab oh it hasn't changed actually yeah so rainbows so the funny thing is is it started with the rainbow when I hit enter it did I surprise you is a button must submit whatever I'm actually gonna skip bypass all of that and I'm just going to when the window code starts I'm just gonna immediately call go wiki so I'm using this just like I want to setup an interface to make this dynamic with different words but I just want every time i refresh the page for it to run to test what's going working so I should see every time I run it I get a console log of what's in there I could change a different word so now the first thing I want to do is look for a list of articles with that term in it so I you know I've already done the research about the Wikipedia API and how it works normally in these coding challenges I like to kind of like figure that out but I have to admit the Wikipedia document API documentation is a bit difficult is to read but here it is and I can see this this is basically what I'm using here I think is that this is looking for this URL tells to send you the content of a page but there's also like a URL to get us to do a search so you can look through and read all about how to do this but I'm actually just gonna I already have a URL right here this is for a search so what I'm gonna do here is I'm gonna say VAR URL equals and actually let's um let me use these let me make these and I'm gonna I have to use let not bar I'm gonna say put this put this back up at the top there I'm gonna say let search URL equal and this is the full URL I'm gonna go all the way to the end and close the quotes but I'm gonna take that out because what I want to do is have an end and then I want the search term to form dynamically so I'm gonna say let URL equal search URL plus term so let's just console.log that URL to see that that's working there we go so now you can see that's the full URL if searching for rainbow and that's dynamic because if I were to put in here you know unicorn and hit enter now I'm gonna get unicorn so the first thing that I want to do is just sort of see what's in that I'm I want to I just want to copy this URL and I want to look at it I didn't get it I could just click on it instead of copying it but I'm gonna put it in here and look this is the JSON JavaScript object notation formatted data that's coming from the Wikipedia API and it's giving me a list of all the possible pages with the term rainbow in it so let me just pick the first one so how do I even get that so it's coming in as in so first of all I have to request it from my code I'm looking at in the browser so I want to say load JSON URL and then I'm gonna say got data so let's make sure this comes through and I'm gonna write a function called got data and that's the callback for when the data comes through and I'm kind of entering into a dangerous territory of having all these nested callbacks first there's a callback for the input box then there's a callback for the data then I'm gonna do something else with a callback so someday I might want to refactor this using a sort of more thoughtful approach of how to sequence all these callbacks but I'm just gonna kind of do it willynilly right now console dot log data so let's see what happens here ah so look at this this is like the bane of everybody's existence on the Internet access control allow origin header not present I can I use it course to say ba ba ba ba ba ba so this is a really unfortunate it's the Wikipedia API doesn't seem to have something called cores which is crossorigin resources or something like that enabled allowing us to fetch data from another server from a server which is where our code is running some api's will let you do this some won't I'm pretty sure since I've used this before in code that there's a way around this it's called JSON PE I sort of made a video about this somewhere else it's JSON with padding and p5 has a nice option so often what I do and I've said this before is it didn't work I got cores let me just add another argument here JSON P so if I last add this third argument let me try it with JSON P and let me run it again and there we go it came through so we could say a lot more about that but in this case were just lucky we tried it first without JSON P now we try it with JSON P so what I'm looking for is it comes in as an array I want the first element the first element of the first element of the array so I'm going to try to see if I could say console log data 00 let's see what I get and I could pick a random one that might be more interesting but let me just pick the first one I got are mmm did I get the o 0 no one zero sorry I want data 1 the second element the first element of the second element there we go rainbow so let's just see rainbow let's try putting other things in here like unicorn and let's just try like a few characters like ar e there's a I guess there's a Wikipedia page for our e P P you why okay what's going on here let's look at the full data 0tu I know there is a Wikipedia page for Pui which is the French burning the point is if I pan turd in a search term that was just part of a page I wouldn't get it back but you'll think of something so now what I want to do okay so once I have the what I'm gonna pause for a second and think of something okay I've got to I've got to think of some whatever what's a sequence of characters that that wouldn't be its own thing in the Wikipedia TL TL TL C EXC someone is saying in the chat there is a Wikipedia page for exe right he X C but I'm basically getting yeah look at this okay I can't think of anything it doesn't matter what I'm gonna do we're gonna check so let's change it to random so what I'm actually gonna do is I'm gonna say let's length equal data index one length it's probably it's I think it's gonna just give me sort of 10 by default and then I'm gonna say let index equal floor random length so I want to pick a random index into that array and I'm going to say data index 1 data 1 index so this should give me a random article that'll be better let me go back to my thing here so now I got rainbow the South Korean band if I type in what it was I PU why I got py but there are other ones it won't oh it's I didn't I gotta have the submit button unicorn I got unicorn bubble so you can see I'm getting a random one each time let's do rainbow again I got Rainbow Brite let's do a unicorn again and I got unicorns the cricket team okay so we're getting a random article each time that's good I forgot what I'm doing here exactly but now let's at least get the article data so the next thing that I want to do once I have that title so really what I'm saying is VAR title equals this now one thing about Wikipedia titles is let's say I try to actually look for unicorns cricket team on Wikipedia so I'm gonna go to with unicorns cricket team Wikipedia see if I can get that page here it is look at the URL the title the way Wikipedia works is it actually uses underscores wherever there are spaces so I'm gonna need to account for that so one thing I'm gonna do is I'm now gonna say title equals replace oh sorry title this is a JavaScript function that allows me to use a regular expression which you can watch my regular expression tutorials match any white space I could have just done this any like space but let's do I'm gonna be smart about this any one or more white space in a row with an underscore now let me console.log that title and let's see what this looks like you can see I got rainbow flag now oh you know what I forgot it only replaced the first space so I need to have the global flag here so it replaces all the spaces and I know you can see it replaced all the spaces rainbow trout etc rainbow rainbow bright etc okay so here we go now what am I gonna do now I need to ask Wikipedia and here's the next this is I'm gonna call this the content URL this is the URL for asking for the content and I think you can ask the fact that it's it you can see at the end here it's titled equals I think you can ask for content of multiple articles but I'm just gonna do one so what I'm going to do now if back into my code I'm gonna go down here to see what I mean by this sort of nested callback thing that I've done is kind of a bit of a problem I'm going to say load JSON okay Leslie the bar here letletlet URL equal the content URL plus the title and then I call it content URL with lowercase RL content URL plus the title and then lo JSON URL and then got now I need another you know most people when writing JavaScript I don't most people we put an anonymous function right in there that's the callback or use some type of other technique to have nested callbacks like async our promises I'm gonna be pretty terrible about it and I'm gonna say I'm gonna call this got search and I'm gonna call this got content and just write another function called this data and I'm gonna say console whoops and I'm gonna say console dot log data okay so now I want to see I want to look at the say console dot log querying and title oh there's that new like backtick fancy way in es6 of you doing strings got to do that at some point okay okay so let's do this uh so I went for Rainbow Brite but it didn't get the content of Rainbow Brite so what I'm going to do is say why because I forgot about json p so i have to do json p i had that cross origin error again and does this look like I got stuff this looks weird hmm all right let's see rainbow flag with stress again rainbow flag some so what did I miss here back tick template strings okay hold on what did I miss timeout edit point so this didn't work content URL plus title let's look at that let's log that URL so this is the URL copy link address oh oh we need to come in Oh apologies so actually this is working I just find this to be totally confusing to look at but the content is in there I should have thought like I have to go and investigate how the JSON is format at first so I could say I can I can copy this link and look at it and by the way I have a Chrome extension installed it's called like JSON format err let me look at the stuff this way so really what this is I got to look under query pages huh I have to know the ideal hold on a second here so pages page idea revisions oh my god goodness three items content format star this is what I want which is oh this is the Wikipedia API is organized strangely and maybe there's another way to do this but I actually need to I think I might I have to think about how do I if I don't if the page ID is gonna be different how do I know what to look up because revisions is under this page ID did I get the page ID in the previous query so hold on I have to look at the previous query is there a page ID in here there's no page ID here alright I'm out again the first one can you just do the first I can do index for the first object is that what I need to do object keys data query okay okay look I could look up the keys that's a good point that Alka is making there's a little interesting discussion in the chat going on about Const I got a look at my text messages when I'm taking this break okay okay all right hold on let me think about this okay so while I see the content here under star there's something pretty tricky about this which is I don't know what this is going to be it's the page ID so I've got to pull that dynamically somehow let's see if we can figure that out so I know I want to go to query pages and then something so let me look at this right here console.log data I can get rid of this console log let me say data pages query so let's look at that undefined undefined what did I miss let's data pages undefined okay so I messed that up oh it's just hold on query is sorry looks like query is the first object I want data query yep now pages sorry let me start over query pages I did for me let me pour not yet so looking at this I have query pages and then some number which is the page ID which is something that's going to be different for every article so I have to somehow pull that dynamically in order to get down here to this stuff which is the content which is what I want so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna say let me look here and I can change this console.log data dot query dot pages let's see what I get oops I'm in the wrong place and hit refresh so I got it so how do I know what this number is can I just use like an index I could get the key I could say object keys but what if I just say index zero will that work for the first object no undefined so I could say object keys to give me all the keys that are in this and then look I've got that so the page ID this is pretty weird that what I'm doing I know if there's a better way to do this page ID equals object keys data query pages index 0 index 0 so let's see if that gives me the page ID whoops I have too many brackets what if I messed up here too many parentheses and okay here we go lots of errors here here we go let's try to get this right this this deserves a drumroll am I gonna see the page ID yes and I'm gonna see different page IDs look at that so I'm able to get the page IDs whatever so now what I want is the content to be equal to so so let me just call it page equal data query pages and now I want to say page page ID right because I want to go and look at I want to look at page pages or pages page ID revisions star dot revisions star now here's the thing you can say dot the name of the thing if it's a valid variable name like revisions but I can't say dot star because star is not a valid character for a variable so I've got to use these brackets boy I'm really off my rocker here with this crazy convoluted using Wikipedia low okay here we go let's see what's the chance that I got something here Oh let's look console dot log content undefined mmm let's look at revisions okay got something there revisions zero oh it's an array so zero star oh my goodness zero stars these are really this is like detective work it's not even programming just to figure out how this thing works they are there look there's the content of the Wikipedia page I finally got the content of the Wikipedia page now what do I do with that Oh No so let's do this let's first do a couple things let's say let me at least say right about right before I asked for the content let me say create P title so I got that and now I got the content if I type unicorn in here I and I get the content so now the question is what do I want to do well I could search for a word and then I could so I could pick a random word and then search for articles with that random word in it why not right I could look for links like I could look for special links to other Wikipedia pages but let's be really simple about this and let's just actually let's use another regular expression I got to move they're gonna make this challenge I got to finish this up and I wrap this challenge up somehow so let's use a regular expression let's say I want to say were word regex equals any valid sequence of word characters one or more and let's actually let's say it has to be at least four or more so I have to be at least be like a fourletter word and then and I could put word boundaries right word boundaries I guess and then make it global and then I could say what how do I do this again I say word regex exec or match where do I say Content match I can't even remember my own right right which content match the word regular expression by the way I'm kind of off my rocker here in the sense that I am now using all sorts of stuff like regular expressions you could compare expressions tutorials but what I'm trying to do here is create match a given word and that word is any sequence of characters for more I'm deciding and then I want to look at this so let's see I don't know if I did this right let's see if this gives me a bunch of words on the page it look it did it gave me two thousand four hundred seventy four words like vandal M vandalism expiry October so now what I'm going to do oh boy is I'm gonna pick one of those randomly and by the way the nice thing and it's in it's just an array that if the whole thing is an array p5 the random function I can give it an array and it'll pick me a random one from it and I'm gonna put that in now whoops sorry sorry I messed up what am I doing here you go back the nice thing about p5 is I can now say I'm going to save our words equals the result of this regular expression then var word equals pick a random one so the p5 random function you can actually give it a ran will pick a random one out and I'm gonna say console.log word and I'm going to run this and it gave me average so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to go with you what I'm just gonna give this forget I would give this a go wiki word or turn so it starts with user input value but this go wiki term just does it with that thing so now I can say go wiki word now I'm gonna probably crash my browser because I'm gonna be doing this over and over again I should put something in that stops but it'll actually just go back and do this whole sequence again so let's see what happens yeah look at this hey a Wikipedia random article crawler I need to stop how do I stop it okay let's at least figure out oh good at least I got an error at some point that's how I stopped it look how far I got I got to the return of Saturn so somehow we got femme fatale madeinamerica each tear from rainbow south korean band so i should at least probably do some type of protection yeah I'm going to do something sort of silly whichever's gonna say let counter equals zero I should come up with a better way of doing this and I'm gonna say counter equals counter plus 1 and if counter is greater than 10 O's less than 10 so only do this 10 times and I'm just gonna say create div just so it's a little less of all that space and now let's try this one more time it did it 10 times and it stopped and in theory I should be able to know the counter should get reset anytime change now but you know what I'm gonna do forget it let's let's not have it dude it's only gonna be I'll do it once you got this will be easily fixable so now I'm gonna put something in here like unicorn and OH so what happened there oh whoops okay go wiki is the thing that starts it of course of course so I need another function start search so I'm going to create a function called function start search and that does go wiki user input dot value and also sets the counter equal to zero there we go perfect now everything is done so I can actually do this and I can change this to unicorn and it will give me crawl a bunch of random articles and then I could give it happy and it will crawl a bunch of random articles and end with music okay everybody thank you for watching this random Wikipedia article coding challenge thing it required a lot required regular expressions it requires of callbacks and low JSON and json p and ohio wiki API works Wikipedia I hope I hope you make something from this and actually be more thoughtful and have a an idea here of why you might want to crawl Wikipedia and make some kind of strange thing with it so I sure would be what you make and I look forward to seeing you in a future video yeah so me I am so be is rightly complaining that I put all my functions inside setup but you know I'm just not worrying about this right now they're all being hoisted because they're not using let don't worry about it is me all right let me look at my text messages let's see if I could do the custom shapes thing okay okay meet there great okay okay well okay let me just check one thing see if I can do this custom shapes thing cuz I and I'll be done by 800 cuz that's only gonna be 20 minutes for sure and I'm never gonna do this again where I go for hours and hours and hours but I'm just checking something here on my phone you can listen to this waiting music okay all right all is well and I should probably just do the custom shapes next week does anybody actually want to still keep watching this live stream if you do you're I feel like I have to make enough videos to rightfully not include the simple harmonic motion challenge okay people are gonna still watch all right I'm gonna try to do this kind of quick well I love that I got Newsies the musical in there that's pretty awesome let's see here p5 manager is like the greatest thing ever p5 generate be custom shapes did I oh did I put some bars in there oh yeah at least when I publish the code that will get fixed actually I kind of was happy with the way this like crazy example I feel like there's a lot of possibilities from there I'm thinking by the way if I start having like the stream crash I might come back to say goodbye but that'll be the last straw didn't I start this 3 hours and 40 minutes ago I did I don't know that I've done a live stream and it ruins still sake please dude neural networks it'll come why go watch Suraj was here he's got lots of videos on neural networks you can watch this great I watch them that's why I learned a lot of stuff ok you can close this close this close this I haven't read any random numbers I know anyone programming design system okay okay we c'mon points out that I have selling England by the pound which is one of my favourite albums I don't actually know that album so I'm gonna have to check it out so if you guys aren't familiar with this what I have here is rune Matson's programming design systems book which is excellent I also have to do my physical therapy exercises it's put a lot of times we've been here for four hours I forgot to add an email I was supposed to send I guess I might give myself a reminder shoot I have too much this is I'm overwhelmed it's tough to do this just sending myself a reminder by Genesis okay this is oh by the way this waiting music is awesome Lee long cuz I can't because I've been streaming for four hours I could say things like awesomely now the marathon next Friday by the way I'm gonna do an Alexa skill and classes in es6 so I kind of have that planned actually so that's coming next Friday alright this is kind of like showing up okay alright here we go everybody hello Ukraine what time is it isn't in the Ukraine everyone's saying I'm sorry for all the people who like I'm making you stay awake go to sleep sleep is important whoops and you will certainly wake up to be able to watch this why do you do so much p5 in so a little processing lately that's a very valid question yeah kind of like the fact that I can just share this stuff on the web really easily but I would like to do more stuff in processing so you know try to think about that okay alright here we go hello this is a video tutorial about custom shapes and I am showing you on this webpage a much better explanation of how custom shapes that I will give you this is actually rune Matson's online book called programming design systems I think I might have referenced this before it's got an excellent chapter on color at rune mattes and on twitter rune is amazing there's lots of really interesting stuff with graphic design and code for graphic design and so this this web page really will walk you through the this idea of how you can think about a shape as having different vertices again this is not my work this is room Madison's work but this is what I want to cover what does this kind of code mean and even better like what are some things you can do with that so I will let you I'm gonna link to this page you can just stop watching this video and click on it and read it but if you want to keep watching I'm gonna kind of give you my own take on this sort of stuff okay now there's a so what I'm talking about is custom shapes so whoops to click over here what I'm talking about is custom shapes so what do I mean by custom shapes so you might be familiar with a rectangle looks like this or perhaps a circle also known as an ellipse which looks like this there is a line which looks like this and a point which looks like this and a triangle which looks like this and I think this might be everything so there are a list of defined primitive shapes primitive geometry set kinds of polygons set kinds of shapes that you could call the function and drawn p5 but you might want to draw this shape because this is the most glorious shape ever drawn house is a terrible example time out it's gonna disappear in a second so this is gonna you can just do a magic edit point where this goes away and while I erase this Matt you gonna be working overtime I get I don't need to do a live stream next Friday cuz this is like five million hours long okay let's start with something simpler what if I wanted to do this shape so this shape is we can think of as a polygon a shape with many sides and a polygon can be defined by its vertices the vertices being each of these points that connects the sides and this is actually one two three four five so actually if you have a polygon with four arbitrary signs like this you can actually do this with the quad function the quad function 2p5 are processing both of all this codes for processing or p5 allows you to specify four points but what I want to do is make a custom shape so the only way for me to do this that I know of at least is to use a function called begin shape and use a function called n shape so if I use these functions begin shape and end shape what I can do is do in between begin and end I can set any number of arbitrary vertices so I can say vertex vertex over and over again now I could do this if fur and processing this will actually also work in 3d and there's a piece shape object and all sorts of fancy stuff you could do but I just want to look at it from the simple 2d lens that we were doing in p5 and so um so this is the basic idea begin shape and this indentation is unnecessary I'm putting it there just sort of for visual effect but this is the idea now so let's take a look at that and make sure it works so I'm gonna come over here and whoops sorry everybody that's the wrong window I'm gonna say begin shape and I'm gonna say vertex I'm just gonna make up some points 150 vertex 224 at X 200 100 uh vertex 50 I'm not very good at picking numbers I need my random number book vertex 25 50 I've no idea what I've just done let's say n shape and now I'm gonna hit refresh and look there it is so in theory that's my shape and I wasn't very thoughtful about the vertices and the order the order does really matter and we can see if I did something weird with the order because this shape can be filled or stroked in the same way that by that I mean setting the outline color or the fill color so I could say stroke 255 and fill no film just to sort of see no Phil Phil no Phil no Phil no Phil for you we can see I am so that's it so look at that so I maybe I didn't do anything too crazy those are all the points notice how you could with no fill you can actually think of this as a path so it could be a shape that's filled and enclosed or it could be a path and incidentally it if I wanted to close it right I could say oh let me put the first point again now it's closed but that's kind of silly right what actually I can do is just write the argument close in here and now you can see it closed it automatically but I'm going to take that out now one thing I should mention is there actually is other stuff that can go in here maybe I need to come back in a whole separate video to go through all those possibilities but I can specify the kind of shape like if I there's something called a triangle strip which likes if I give it a whole bunch of points it'll put a whole bunch of triangles in between all of those things and I have a feeling that if I go to I'm gonna go to the processing documentation because I know that'll come up begin shape processing we could see a lot of those possibilities here right lines triangles like now if I use those points it's not one shape but it's through every three vertices we'll make a separate triangle triangle strip we'll connect it with a bunch of triangles triangle fan you could use quads you can use and I think I use this in like the Perlin noise terrain challenge and a bunch of my different coding challenges but I'm gonna be in this video I just want to keep things simple and I just want to use vertex so there we go so that's the idea now there's two things that I want to mention here number one is what would be interesting for me to do is come up with an algorithm that sets all these vertices you know what's the point really of me manually setting these vertices more likely I might want to do something like I'm gonna do this really quickly like what if I were to say for let a equals zero and okay so incidentally I'm using a for loop so for some reason to watch this video before I used for loop you have to go back and watch the Lupus video I should probably just stop saying that I'm gonna say a is less than 360 a plus equals ten and then what I'm gonna do and this is I'm gonna use something called polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation this is a little bit of an aside but this is worth it I don't know if this is worth doing I'm gonna say let X equal just to demonstrate the idea 100 times sine of a let y equals 100 times cosine of a plus 200 plus 200 and then I'm gonna say vertex I have a reason why I'm doing this actually I'm gonna say vertex XY let's just see what happens yeah I got something crazy I said all these vertices all of the place so what I'm actually doing is something called polar to Cartesian coordinate transformation I link to a video that goes over into more detail but basically if I have this angle a what I want is to just keep changing that angle a to set a whole bunch of vertices around the circle and I can use cosine and sine trigonometry math to get all those points and I'll link to a video that goes through that in more detail but one of the reasons why this worked really weirdly is I didn't set the angle mode to degrees because I'm thinking about the full way around the circle is 360 degrees and it's using a radians which is a different by default different form of measurement so now we can see there it is and I want to say close so now I want it let me actually say let spacing equal 50 I'm gonna have this be spacing and we can see that's what I get now then what's interesting about this is I'm now going to put this into draw and I can have spacing be variable so I'm going to say spacing equals and I just did that's how I did this far Matic motion challenge it was a disaster I could have that value oscillate oh let's do this I'm off the beaten path this is really just a tutorial about custom shapes but I'm gonna use a sine wave in it might be a bad idea but I'm just gonna do it anyway so I'm gonna say I'm gonna I'm gonna have a variable called T and was set equal to zero Len Len Len Len let me be more simple about this okay let's spacing equal map mouse X which goes between zero and width two between what I want the spacing to be like at five degrees and 100 degrees so let's at least see this work whoa oh I forgot to draw the background in here so let me put the background in draw so you can see right I'm getting I'm changing that angle so I'm slowly increasing the resolution in the circle so the point that I wanted to show this to you is not because this is some beautiful pattern that you should use but the reason why you might use custom shapes and said vertices is actually gonna have an algorithm to find those vertices so what if you wanted to make a bubble a cloud so I actually have a coding trained community project about making a cloud which I'll also link to in here which this could form the basis I think I've done stuff with a curly noise blob coding challenge at one point that this also relates to so there's a lot of possibilities here what I was gonna do was use a sine wave to have this feel like it's breathing SPAC and forth back and forth so that's maybe at something that you should try as an exercise after this video so what I want to do I'm going to leave this here but I'm gonna comment this out again and I want to just talk about one other thing so here we go remember this weird shape that I created this shape is a polygon that has a set of vertices but in addition to vertex there's actually something called curve vertex that I can call now there's also something called bezzie a vertex and bezzie a vertex is a kind of curve vertex for a special a curve called a Bezier curve and actually the patrons custom shaped page goes through that in detail I'm gonna say Bezier curves for like another video because I don't know if I understand that at this moment so I have to go read runes excellent description and then come back to it but curve vertex what curve vertex does is it says instead of having like a hard edge here let's try to curve around that edge but here's the thing I should probably make this a separate video but I'm in this video so you have to be watching all the way the end of this video here's the thing that's tricky and I'm gonna there's gonna be some magic erasing in a second that's gonna happen here so much yeah you can edit out this erasing because one of these days I'm gonna figure out like a good way to erase that's not tissues this is horrible what I'm doing today okay back so one of the trickiest things about working with curves is that you're gonna suddenly discover when use curve vertex points just disappear why so let's imagine that I have these three points oh okay now I might say to myself like oh of course this is what I want the curve to be a time out this wall is kind of wet so I forgot that I sprayed water on it so it doesn't work to draw on it if it's wet let's say that I have these three points these three maybe this marker died we just wait is it the marker or is it the the marker kind of got wet too okay but if I use it it's better okay we're gonna wonder what those circles are doing over there let's say I have these three points now we could look at this and we could say to ourselves like I kind of know what I meant I want to draw this curve but if you think about it more there's actually no way for the computer to know how to draw this curve without more information because why couldn't it be like this or something that's that's a little bit weird let me try that again why couldn't it be like this this would be a valid curve and the difference is how do I enter the curve I've had it in a poor job of drawing this but I think the next thing I'm going to do is and make it more clear what if there was like a secret point right over here that said how to enter this curve or the secret point was over here that send out an edge of the curve and up here it would be over here right this is gonna look different if there's so curves require additional points that control the entry and exit of the curve do I should I need to curve and like come down here do we need to curve and like end up over here and so it can be really confusing and but you have to be aware of this so let's actually go and look at the code and see if we can make this work and let me simplify things actually let me actually make up some specific vertices so I'm gonna say vertex what what's the size of the window it's 200 200 so I'm going to say vertex 10 200 150 and then and let's actually make this 100 200 and then 300 200 oh and I don't know what I'm doing and putting it all in one line vertex I don't know can you see this bottom down here I want three vertices okay and now let's take a look at this oh do I have clothes I want to take out clothes and I messed up the middle one I want this to be at 200 so this is those are my three vertices so I want to make this a curve so a couple things one is let me just draw these points so we can see them separately also 300 200 I mean this is very redundant what I'm doing but strokeweight 4 and then stroke whoops then let's do stroke weight 1 ok so I can see points there so I'm gonna change this the curve vertex and you're gonna see what I need curve vertex and I don't see anything anymore now I should have done this with more than I should do this with 4 points so let's make this one 50 50 and 250 like 60 or something so you're gonna see oh boy let's and that's also my apologies let's also put these as the actual points were drawing and where where does this go whoops what would I say one fifty one fifty fifty and two fifty sixty so you can see these points are actually controlling how this curve looks and there could be many more points it's just controlling the entry of the curve so like what if I made this point Mouse X Mouse Y this is what I'm trying to demonstrate Mouse X took me a while to get to this but Mouse X Mouse Y and now I'm gonna make that first point Mouse X Mouse Y so you can see as I move this around it changes the zoom in a little bit more it changes the entry to the curve and actually this is an interesting way to make something interactive like imagine of this oscillated upanddown it's almost like this wiggling string or something so again as you're building these custom shapes this shape now is only those two points right if I were to say close you know Oh interestingly enough it's like I look it actually connected it all the way around to the first point so the first point is controlling wow this is kind of crazy this is kind of a nice so you can imagine creating some interesting animation by just wow clothes really made the interesting if you do close this whole problem kind of goes away I don't the problem but it doesn't enter it comes around to the end so that's kind of interesting I just discovered that now so you can see the difference if I use clothes because it adds the point another thing that you can do often which is sort of the same thing is I could duplicate the last point twice so that's sort of like I that last point is also the control point for yourself so you can see it's not changing but I am including the first point twice so I could do that also like I could include the first point twice instead of Mouse X Mouse Y and now I kind of have whoops whoops I that's not the first point I could sorry if there was a different first point which was originally one hundred two hundred right so if I'd have that twice and get rid of Mouse that's why this can also be a strategy so it's kind of like just duplicate the first point and duplicate the last point but you don't have as much control I would need yet another point right like this point the mouse to control that so you can see now I could control this with the mouse so there's so many possibilities I'm sorry that I kind of went off the deep end then with like messing around with this but the point is and also incidentally I can mix curve vertex and vertex now let's see if we can make this more obvious or maybe that doesn't work so I'm pretty sure you can do that in processing I'm going to investigate if that works in p5 or not but the idea being that I can mix summer curbs summer jagged so to recap custom shapes are shapes that you just are polygons or paths that you define by a set of vertices you can make you can you can have them be tiled by certain kinds of quad strips or triangle strips or that kind of thing you can have curved vertices or regular vertices curve if you have curved you need to have control points for the curve and the reason for doing that is quite possibly more likely because you want to have something more dynamic oh and look I connected these in this weird crazy way so here's the like ending Frankenstein thing of this like weird hardcoded and circle so I hope you make what if your engine if you don't know what to make from this take a look at the link to the cloud community cloud repository I mean you might be watching this a year in the future hopefully it'll still be there but this is a project that's happening in 2017 for processing day which is October 21st 2017 for the name tags in processing day so if you're interested in consuming to that and I hope you enjoyed this tutorial thanks for watching oh I forgot to mention that okay hold on this is somebody mentioned Catmull ROM splines so maybe this can be inserted in there somehow something I want to mention actually before I wrap up with the computer is that you might be asking yourself like well what's the math that calculates this curve well there are different kinds of mathematical functions to figure out how a curve goes between two different points I mentioned a Bezier curve there's a specific kind of bezzie a function and it works pretty differently than this but it it is something you could look at but this is actually known as a Catmull this this is using p5 and use the Catmull wrong spline spline being kind of another word for curve and it these are people's names who came up with this algorithm so I'll try to include a link to a historical information about the Catmull Rohm spline and I apologize if I I spell that or said that wrong Thanks okay all right all right everybody I met you maybe you can splice that little explanation in there or we could just leave it out it doesn't really matter but likes place it not at the very end but like after I was there and then I do that and then I came here and wrapped up all right everybody it is 805 this is for our live stream cat bowl is a name yes I I don't think I can do anything else today that Lisa Zhu curve thing I don't know if it could be made into a video I don't like it remind me later goodbye thank you for tuning in judo network's down very funny Allen and I hope you enjoyed this live stream I'm pretty exhausted I will be back next Friday even though now I feel like it did to live streams in one day and I could text Friday off and OH people want to see so I'm gonna release the trailer so if people want to watch the trailer should I just do that right now I'm gonna release it as soon as I turn off the live stream I'll release the trailer and then these will be edited and that sort of thing I'm sorry I really I just I just have to go that's for the son thank you everybody choo choo 273 that is a random number for you all my Jake I can't do any more I'm exhausted 8 o'clock it's like my bedtime in 15 minutes and I will release the trailer as soon as I shut off this livestream thank you everyone for watching and we'll see you next Friday on the coding train probably around the same time hopefully a little bit earlier because actually I have somewhere to be at 6 p.m. Eastern time next Friday so I'm hoping maybe I'll start at 2 or 3 o'clock in the afternoon okay and this was upstream livestream number 101 and I'm just I don't have a better way of ending this I guess I could play the trailer one more time at the end now nobody wants to see that I'll just release it you can watch it yourself okay here we go goodbye good night good morning wherever you are yes I'm going to continue with machine learning it's just going to be a while
