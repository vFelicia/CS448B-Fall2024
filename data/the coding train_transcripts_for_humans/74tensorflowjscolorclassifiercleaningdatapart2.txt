00:00 - all right cleaning my data part two
00:03 - that's where we are where I last left
00:04 - off previously your data
00:07 - whoa the suspense was killing you I know
00:09 - I had just retrieved all the data from
00:13 - firebase and I looked at it by anonymous
00:15 - user ID how many entries had been
00:18 - submitted by each user and I have a
00:20 - suspicion that some of these that
00:21 - submitted a lot of entries maybe wasn't
00:24 - actually a person doing it manually but
00:26 - and maybe like a bot or something
00:28 - flooding the database so let's try to
00:29 - investigate that and see what we can
00:31 - figure out so the first thing I'm gonna
00:32 - do is I'm just gonna visualize the data
00:34 - I could visualize it by user ID there's
00:36 - so many things I could do looks think
00:37 - about it
00:37 - so there were there are how many labels
00:40 - so let me think about this okay this is
00:43 - my sketch I know what the labels are so
00:46 - let me just I'm gonna need let me just
00:48 - set up a variable called data data by
00:55 - you know color by label and this will be
01:00 - an object and the object will have empty
01:05 - arrays for each one of the labels so
01:12 - there was blue ish I should have a list
01:15 - of this somewhere greenish doing this
01:18 - manually I could have actually pulled
01:19 - the labels from the database but this
01:21 - will be simpler a greenish pink ish I'm
01:26 - not doing this in any particular order
01:28 - greyish red ish what am I missing
01:33 - purple ish there was a brown if if I go
01:39 - to my crowdsource color reddish greenish
01:42 - bluish oranges did I do orange I don't
01:44 - think I did orange orange orange ish
01:52 - purplish greyish brownish one two three
01:54 - four five six seven eight nine I'm
01:57 - missing one blue green pink gray this is
02:01 - not a very systematic way to take this
02:03 - red green blue orange purple but
02:06 - yellowish I didn't do yellowish okay
02:08 - yellow ish now
02:13 - while I am looping through the data
02:16 - which I did in the previous video I'm
02:18 - going to not worry about this users by
02:21 - count thing right now I will come back
02:23 - to that later what I want to do is oh
02:27 - sorry I do need I do want this so I want
02:30 - to look at each data point and I want to
02:36 - look at the RG so I want to look at the
02:38 - label and I want to say color by label
02:42 - and then I want a record dot label push
02:49 - and so I'm going to create a color let
02:54 - color equal I'll use the p5 color
02:57 - function to say record our record G
03:01 - record B color by label push color and
03:08 - now what I should have and I'm really
03:12 - risking breaking the console here is I
03:15 - should have all the RGB values listed by
03:18 - the label so let's look at that oops I'm
03:23 - in the wrong sketch right so we can see
03:27 - there's a thousand blues 16 there's only
03:31 - two 35 Gray's so one thing that's also
03:34 - important about what I've done with my
03:36 - data set here is I don't have a uniform
03:38 - amount of data points by label I have
03:43 - many more green ones and actually a Eric
03:47 - in the patron group made a point that
03:49 - the way that colors are picked the way
03:51 - my random number generator works or
03:53 - you're gonna be more greenish looking
03:54 - colors which is sort of interesting to
03:56 - think about but at the very least what I
03:58 - can do now is I could just draw all of
04:01 - the colors so I'm trying to think of
04:03 - what I probably want to do like little
04:07 - rectangles and a p5 canvas maybe so let
04:10 - me add create canvas and let's make it
04:17 - 400 by 400 and let me let's do just one
04:24 - let's just start with
04:26 - Luis and I'm going to say a four let I
04:33 - equals zero I is less than so let's see
04:37 - let me say let blues equal color by
04:40 - label blue ish and I'm gonna look at all
04:46 - those and let's start with an X let's
04:53 - start with a Y let's say fill blues
04:58 - index I and then let's draw a rectangle
05:02 - at X Y that's 10 comma 10 will increase
05:07 - X by 10 and if Y is greater than or
05:10 - equal to width then we will a reset X
05:13 - back to 0 and increase Y by 10 now this
05:16 - is in very again I'm not being that
05:18 - thoughtful about this but in theory I
05:20 - should see now when I run this all the
05:25 - loose now why did it not wrap around oh
05:28 - if X is greater than width and I want to
05:30 - say no stroke and I could sort I
05:33 - probably would want to sort these two I
05:35 - could sort them by like brightness so we
05:36 - can see here ah look at this these are
05:38 - all the Blues that were submitted to the
05:42 - database so you know I kind of don't
05:46 - mind that the data has some noise in it
05:52 - I mean big deal the point of this is to
05:54 - crowdsource it and maybe training a
05:56 - model if there's enough data it will
05:58 - sort of filter out the noise but you
06:00 - know and the question is why is this
06:03 - here why is this here what should I do
06:05 - about that let's just look at some other
06:07 - ones let's look at red you can see ok
06:13 - what's interesting is I think these are
06:14 - in the in the order by which they were
06:16 - submitted there probably was a time
06:18 - period here where some like bad data was
06:21 - entered let's look let's look at green
06:23 - cuz Green has the most right
06:26 - that's pretty good so what do I do
06:29 - oh boy what do I do about this all right
06:32 - so - great - great points just came up
06:34 - in the chat right now one is a Luke B
06:37 - writes pretty good to have the outliers
06:39 - to encourage prevention of overfitting
06:41 - the neural network so this is actually
06:43 - true in you know one thing you have to
06:45 - watch out for is that your your model
06:50 - the model that I'm going to train to do
06:52 - this color classification what if it it
06:55 - just works so well with the training
06:56 - data that it doesn't work so well with
06:58 - new data and having a bit of noise in
07:00 - the training data can actually help with
07:02 - that another me I answered me rights
07:07 - make it so clicking on a pixel prince
07:09 - who did it the user ID that is and also
07:13 - maybe highlights all the other ones with
07:15 - the same user ID that I love so let's
07:18 - add that that's gonna be that's not
07:19 - gonna be the easiest thing but it's
07:20 - worth doing let me see if I can add that
07:23 - so okay so if I click the mouse mouse
07:32 - pressed I can I can like it's sort of
07:37 - like I would be in theory Mouse X
07:40 - divided by ten and J would be right this
07:45 - is where I'm clicking I'm looking for
07:46 - the I and J not the X&Y like sort of
07:48 - like the I and J of what I'm clicking on
07:51 - Mouse Y divided by 10 and then I should
07:54 - be able to get the index then by saying
07:56 - I plus J times and then the width
08:02 - divided by 10 again I really really
08:06 - really should be using variables for
08:08 - these numbers like 10 and putting
08:10 - putting in like an of variables for like
08:14 - columns and rows but let's just try this
08:15 - right now let's try then saying
08:17 - console.log and so let's let me make a
08:24 - I'm gonna call this color I'm gonna call
08:28 - this like label I'm just gonna call this
08:29 - label and I'm gonna let's let's go with
08:32 - a blueish to start again so I'm gonna
08:35 - use here color by label label and let's
08:44 - make color by label color by label
08:47 - already is a global variable so I'm
08:50 - going to say consult
08:51 - log okay so let data equal color by
08:57 - label that label and then I should go to
09:04 - a console log D data index I think this
09:11 - will be right and like make some
09:13 - mistakes here let's see what happens all
09:18 - right let me click here all right so I
09:20 - got something oh yeah
09:24 - so one thing that's like kind of
09:25 - unfortunate is oh I don't have the user
09:31 - ID I don't have to use so I got the
09:33 - color but I'm not actually storing the
09:37 - full data thing oh yeah so color by
09:39 - label this is what I need to do I want
09:41 - color by label actually to store the
09:43 - whole record we don't actually want to
09:46 - store the color let's store the whole
09:48 - record then when I visualize it I can
09:52 - just ask for the RGB values right
10:04 - because then when I click on something
10:08 - this is now that entry so I can see like
10:11 - right if I click on this we can see I
10:15 - look at this this user right I'm
10:17 - clicking on these they're all the same
10:20 - user this user Y gdq seems to have some
10:25 - faulty data so i could filter out this
10:27 - user i could do something nice where
10:29 - like as I'm hovering I highlight
10:30 - everything but I think I'm not gonna go
10:32 - that far I let anybody who wants to
10:34 - contribute to to I'll let you try that
10:36 - on your own maybe but so let me make a
10:38 - list here of users that I might want to
10:42 - filter out whether I'm happy to have the
10:46 - noise or not that's a question but let's
10:49 - let's let me just make this a little
10:54 - smaller it's a little harder for you to
10:55 - see it but I think it's going to be
10:56 - easier in terms of space so okay so
10:59 - let's look at a few more that are maybe
11:01 - like clearly not good same user
11:04 - it's all that same user I haven't found
11:07 - them that let's look up here a different
11:09 - user so this user also looks like it
11:13 - maybe has some bad data oops let's look
11:21 - at a different color let's look at let's
11:25 - look at what was like there is very
11:26 - little of greyish that's we couldn't
11:34 - this user is now suspect you know the
11:41 - thing is a user might have missed
11:42 - clicked so unless I see it consistently
11:45 - yeah I'm not gonna the user could have
11:53 - missed clicked all right so you get the
11:55 - idea okay
11:58 - so you get the idea now there's so many
12:01 - ways that I could be more thoughtful
12:03 - about this and add more features to work
12:05 - on cleaning the data but let's just say
12:07 - for right now and and people are
12:10 - suggesting like I could algorithmically
12:12 - like I could actually evaluate the
12:13 - numbers and see like compute the hue and
12:17 - see if the hue match is labeled but I
12:19 - don't I specifically do not want to do
12:21 - that because what I specifically want
12:23 - from this is this idea of human
12:25 - perception of color and I don't want to
12:27 - use math because I could create my own
12:28 - dat data set with math of like putting
12:31 - colors into certain buckets and in a way
12:33 - I don't even want to do what I just did
12:34 - right here which is eliminate certain
12:36 - users and I and I probably should just
12:38 - visualize what I should do with these
12:40 - users now is actually actually let me do
12:44 - this do what these users now is I'm
12:46 - actually just going to look at all of
12:48 - their entries and see so let's let's add
12:50 - that as one more thing you can stop
12:53 - watching this video and just go on
12:54 - because I'm gonna build a machine
12:55 - learning model in the future videos but
12:56 - if you want to keep watching I'm gonna
12:58 - do let's do one more thing like let's
12:59 - take this user and what I'm going to do
13:04 - now is I'm going to comment out this
13:10 - this drawing thing that I'm doing and I
13:15 - want to create a
13:17 - I want to say color data by user I'm
13:25 - going to make that an array and I just
13:30 - want to say if record user ID equals a
13:35 - particular user then I want to say a
13:42 - user user data and I could build an
13:47 - interface to do all this would be so
13:49 - much better but I don't really have time
13:51 - to do all that this particular series so
13:54 - that might be something exercise you do
13:55 - for yourself user data dot push the
13:59 - record and then down here I could use
14:03 - this exact same algorithm oh but you
14:06 - know what I don't want to do it that's
14:08 - what I want to do I'm gonna use Dom
14:09 - elements now I think I'm gonna say for
14:11 - let color for let entry it's an entry
14:21 - like of user data I'm gonna say create a
14:28 - div I'm gonna just make a div and then
14:34 - I'm gonna say div and actually let me
14:42 - let me create a div with entry dot label
14:46 - in it so let's just try this whoops not
14:51 - the string and let me get rid of the
14:53 - canvas so these are all these are all of
15:03 - this particular users entries I maybe I
15:07 - should sort them by let's sort them by
15:09 - the label so let's so let's say user
15:16 - data sort a comma b return a dot label
15:27 - greater than B dot label so this is
15:32 - whoops oh and I don't need to say return
15:37 - if I use the arrow syntax I've really
15:40 - just off the deep end here in this video
15:43 - I'm gonna I think this is right
15:45 - that should sort it yes there we go so
15:48 - we can see now it's that's weird just
15:53 - pausing for a second there's a great
15:54 - comment in the chat from Sam D could we
15:56 - separate out the different things into
15:58 - functions by color by user by whatever
16:00 - classifier rather than commenting out
16:02 - lots of stuff yes this would be an
16:03 - absolutely great thing to do so I'm
16:05 - gonna publish this and I would love to
16:07 - to get user comments and user
16:09 - submissions of like making a nice
16:10 - interface for this I'm but I'm trying to
16:13 - figure out why it didn't sort this right
16:15 - now okay these are strings so this is
16:20 - going to give me a true or false but the
16:22 - sort function wants like a negative or
16:23 - positive number so I'm actually just
16:25 - gonna break this out I know I could do
16:27 - this with those ternary operators but
16:31 - I'm just gonna say if return 1 else
16:40 - return negative 1 and this should this
16:46 - should do the trick right so let's take
16:50 - a look at this now there we go bluish
16:53 - greenish reddish so we could see this is
16:55 - now sorted by that particular user and
16:57 - then all I need to do is add oh I need
17:03 - to make something that color box I guess
17:10 - I couldn't make that a div that lives
17:12 - inside a color box size 10 comma 10 and
17:19 - then color box style these are all p5
17:22 - Dom functions background color are argh
17:27 - oh now this would be a great time to use
17:30 - those template literals because what I
17:31 - want to do is say RGB entry entry are
17:44 - entry G and what happened its entry dot
17:56 - B right
18:00 - this is CSS for making an RGB color I
18:03 - believe let's see how this works what's
18:08 - the chance this works yeah okay oh but
18:12 - uh now what I want to do is say color
18:17 - box parent and I want it to be in line
18:22 - so how do I do that
18:24 - color box style display:inline what it
18:32 - is
18:33 - no who well you get the idea there's
18:40 - some of these because you can see it's
18:41 - pretty inconsistent
18:42 - there's just the colors are just so
18:44 - wildly different that I think we can
18:47 - kind of say that this user we can filter
18:51 - out and I could look at some of these
18:56 - other users now like let's look at this
18:58 - user where did I let's look at this user
19:07 - everything seems to be a blueish that
19:09 - doesn't look like great data and let me
19:12 - look at this user and again doing I'm
19:15 - doing this so manually in my code could
19:18 - easily build an interface to look at all
19:20 - this grayish grayish greenish greenish
19:23 - brownish blueish blue yeah this looks
19:25 - too inconsistent so you know it's fine
19:29 - to have some way so I think we're done
19:30 - here
19:31 - you get the point that we're not
19:33 - completely done because I need to I want
19:35 - to just like create a JSON file of all
19:38 - of the data but I mean I'll do that in
19:40 - the next video cuz I don't know if
19:42 - anybody's still watching this right now
19:45 - so where I could add some background to
19:49 - the text and some padding that's a
19:51 - greater this is also the way I could
19:52 - visualize this with if I had any sort of
19:54 - talent or knowledge about CSS and design
19:56 - but you the viewer will
19:58 - hopefully improve this but you can sort
19:59 - of see the process of looking at the
20:01 - data visualizing it and getting a sense
20:03 - of it and now what I might want to do is
20:04 - actually like filter and save the data
20:06 - and I will do that in the next video
20:07 - which will be a very short one I think
20:13 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

all right cleaning my data part two that's where we are where I last left off previously your data whoa the suspense was killing you I know I had just retrieved all the data from firebase and I looked at it by anonymous user ID how many entries had been submitted by each user and I have a suspicion that some of these that submitted a lot of entries maybe wasn't actually a person doing it manually but and maybe like a bot or something flooding the database so let's try to investigate that and see what we can figure out so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna visualize the data I could visualize it by user ID there's so many things I could do looks think about it so there were there are how many labels so let me think about this okay this is my sketch I know what the labels are so let me just I'm gonna need let me just set up a variable called data data by you know color by label and this will be an object and the object will have empty arrays for each one of the labels so there was blue ish I should have a list of this somewhere greenish doing this manually I could have actually pulled the labels from the database but this will be simpler a greenish pink ish I'm not doing this in any particular order greyish red ish what am I missing purple ish there was a brown if if I go to my crowdsource color reddish greenish bluish oranges did I do orange I don't think I did orange orange orange ish purplish greyish brownish one two three four five six seven eight nine I'm missing one blue green pink gray this is not a very systematic way to take this red green blue orange purple but yellowish I didn't do yellowish okay yellow ish now while I am looping through the data which I did in the previous video I'm going to not worry about this users by count thing right now I will come back to that later what I want to do is oh sorry I do need I do want this so I want to look at each data point and I want to look at the RG so I want to look at the label and I want to say color by label and then I want a record dot label push and so I'm going to create a color let color equal I'll use the p5 color function to say record our record G record B color by label push color and now what I should have and I'm really risking breaking the console here is I should have all the RGB values listed by the label so let's look at that oops I'm in the wrong sketch right so we can see there's a thousand blues 16 there's only two 35 Gray's so one thing that's also important about what I've done with my data set here is I don't have a uniform amount of data points by label I have many more green ones and actually a Eric in the patron group made a point that the way that colors are picked the way my random number generator works or you're gonna be more greenish looking colors which is sort of interesting to think about but at the very least what I can do now is I could just draw all of the colors so I'm trying to think of what I probably want to do like little rectangles and a p5 canvas maybe so let me add create canvas and let's make it 400 by 400 and let me let's do just one let's just start with Luis and I'm going to say a four let I equals zero I is less than so let's see let me say let blues equal color by label blue ish and I'm gonna look at all those and let's start with an X let's start with a Y let's say fill blues index I and then let's draw a rectangle at X Y that's 10 comma 10 will increase X by 10 and if Y is greater than or equal to width then we will a reset X back to 0 and increase Y by 10 now this is in very again I'm not being that thoughtful about this but in theory I should see now when I run this all the loose now why did it not wrap around oh if X is greater than width and I want to say no stroke and I could sort I probably would want to sort these two I could sort them by like brightness so we can see here ah look at this these are all the Blues that were submitted to the database so you know I kind of don't mind that the data has some noise in it I mean big deal the point of this is to crowdsource it and maybe training a model if there's enough data it will sort of filter out the noise but you know and the question is why is this here why is this here what should I do about that let's just look at some other ones let's look at red you can see ok what's interesting is I think these are in the in the order by which they were submitted there probably was a time period here where some like bad data was entered let's look let's look at green cuz Green has the most right that's pretty good so what do I do oh boy what do I do about this all right so great great points just came up in the chat right now one is a Luke B writes pretty good to have the outliers to encourage prevention of overfitting the neural network so this is actually true in you know one thing you have to watch out for is that your your model the model that I'm going to train to do this color classification what if it it just works so well with the training data that it doesn't work so well with new data and having a bit of noise in the training data can actually help with that another me I answered me rights make it so clicking on a pixel prince who did it the user ID that is and also maybe highlights all the other ones with the same user ID that I love so let's add that that's gonna be that's not gonna be the easiest thing but it's worth doing let me see if I can add that so okay so if I click the mouse mouse pressed I can I can like it's sort of like I would be in theory Mouse X divided by ten and J would be right this is where I'm clicking I'm looking for the I and J not the X&Y like sort of like the I and J of what I'm clicking on Mouse Y divided by 10 and then I should be able to get the index then by saying I plus J times and then the width divided by 10 again I really really really should be using variables for these numbers like 10 and putting putting in like an of variables for like columns and rows but let's just try this right now let's try then saying console.log and so let's let me make a I'm gonna call this color I'm gonna call this like label I'm just gonna call this label and I'm gonna let's let's go with a blueish to start again so I'm gonna use here color by label label and let's make color by label color by label already is a global variable so I'm going to say consult log okay so let data equal color by label that label and then I should go to a console log D data index I think this will be right and like make some mistakes here let's see what happens all right let me click here all right so I got something oh yeah so one thing that's like kind of unfortunate is oh I don't have the user ID I don't have to use so I got the color but I'm not actually storing the full data thing oh yeah so color by label this is what I need to do I want color by label actually to store the whole record we don't actually want to store the color let's store the whole record then when I visualize it I can just ask for the RGB values right because then when I click on something this is now that entry so I can see like right if I click on this we can see I look at this this user right I'm clicking on these they're all the same user this user Y gdq seems to have some faulty data so i could filter out this user i could do something nice where like as I'm hovering I highlight everything but I think I'm not gonna go that far I let anybody who wants to contribute to to I'll let you try that on your own maybe but so let me make a list here of users that I might want to filter out whether I'm happy to have the noise or not that's a question but let's let's let me just make this a little smaller it's a little harder for you to see it but I think it's going to be easier in terms of space so okay so let's look at a few more that are maybe like clearly not good same user it's all that same user I haven't found them that let's look up here a different user so this user also looks like it maybe has some bad data oops let's look at a different color let's look at let's look at what was like there is very little of greyish that's we couldn't this user is now suspect you know the thing is a user might have missed clicked so unless I see it consistently yeah I'm not gonna the user could have missed clicked all right so you get the idea okay so you get the idea now there's so many ways that I could be more thoughtful about this and add more features to work on cleaning the data but let's just say for right now and and people are suggesting like I could algorithmically like I could actually evaluate the numbers and see like compute the hue and see if the hue match is labeled but I don't I specifically do not want to do that because what I specifically want from this is this idea of human perception of color and I don't want to use math because I could create my own dat data set with math of like putting colors into certain buckets and in a way I don't even want to do what I just did right here which is eliminate certain users and I and I probably should just visualize what I should do with these users now is actually actually let me do this do what these users now is I'm actually just going to look at all of their entries and see so let's let's add that as one more thing you can stop watching this video and just go on because I'm gonna build a machine learning model in the future videos but if you want to keep watching I'm gonna do let's do one more thing like let's take this user and what I'm going to do now is I'm going to comment out this this drawing thing that I'm doing and I want to create a I want to say color data by user I'm going to make that an array and I just want to say if record user ID equals a particular user then I want to say a user user data and I could build an interface to do all this would be so much better but I don't really have time to do all that this particular series so that might be something exercise you do for yourself user data dot push the record and then down here I could use this exact same algorithm oh but you know what I don't want to do it that's what I want to do I'm gonna use Dom elements now I think I'm gonna say for let color for let entry it's an entry like of user data I'm gonna say create a div I'm gonna just make a div and then I'm gonna say div and actually let me let me create a div with entry dot label in it so let's just try this whoops not the string and let me get rid of the canvas so these are all these are all of this particular users entries I maybe I should sort them by let's sort them by the label so let's so let's say user data sort a comma b return a dot label greater than B dot label so this is whoops oh and I don't need to say return if I use the arrow syntax I've really just off the deep end here in this video I'm gonna I think this is right that should sort it yes there we go so we can see now it's that's weird just pausing for a second there's a great comment in the chat from Sam D could we separate out the different things into functions by color by user by whatever classifier rather than commenting out lots of stuff yes this would be an absolutely great thing to do so I'm gonna publish this and I would love to to get user comments and user submissions of like making a nice interface for this I'm but I'm trying to figure out why it didn't sort this right now okay these are strings so this is going to give me a true or false but the sort function wants like a negative or positive number so I'm actually just gonna break this out I know I could do this with those ternary operators but I'm just gonna say if return 1 else return negative 1 and this should this should do the trick right so let's take a look at this now there we go bluish greenish reddish so we could see this is now sorted by that particular user and then all I need to do is add oh I need to make something that color box I guess I couldn't make that a div that lives inside a color box size 10 comma 10 and then color box style these are all p5 Dom functions background color are argh oh now this would be a great time to use those template literals because what I want to do is say RGB entry entry are entry G and what happened its entry dot B right this is CSS for making an RGB color I believe let's see how this works what's the chance this works yeah okay oh but uh now what I want to do is say color box parent and I want it to be in line so how do I do that color box style displayinline what it is no who well you get the idea there's some of these because you can see it's pretty inconsistent there's just the colors are just so wildly different that I think we can kind of say that this user we can filter out and I could look at some of these other users now like let's look at this user where did I let's look at this user everything seems to be a blueish that doesn't look like great data and let me look at this user and again doing I'm doing this so manually in my code could easily build an interface to look at all this grayish grayish greenish greenish brownish blueish blue yeah this looks too inconsistent so you know it's fine to have some way so I think we're done here you get the point that we're not completely done because I need to I want to just like create a JSON file of all of the data but I mean I'll do that in the next video cuz I don't know if anybody's still watching this right now so where I could add some background to the text and some padding that's a greater this is also the way I could visualize this with if I had any sort of talent or knowledge about CSS and design but you the viewer will hopefully improve this but you can sort of see the process of looking at the data visualizing it and getting a sense of it and now what I might want to do is actually like filter and save the data and I will do that in the next video which will be a very short one I think
