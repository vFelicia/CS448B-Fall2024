00:00 - I've made a coded challenge to draw a
00:01 - fractal tree I've made a short to show
00:03 - you how to draw that fractal Tree in
00:04 - less than a minute let's see what you
00:06 - got shot GPT can you write the code for
00:08 - a fractal Tree in p5.js sure here's some
00:11 - sample code for a fractal Tree in p5.js
00:13 - let's take a look paste it in hey wait a
00:16 - second here you've drawn the tree but
00:18 - the angle is zero let's see what chat
00:19 - GPT thinks of my comment that it doesn't
00:22 - really look like a tree yes I am correct
00:24 - oh I feel so validated the angle
00:26 - variable set to zero which means that
00:28 - the branches of the tree will grow
00:29 - straight out from the trunk to make the
00:30 - tree look more like a realtor you could
00:32 - try setting the angle to a value other
00:34 - than zero good work what about having
00:37 - the angle controlled by the mouse okay
00:40 - you can use the mouse X and mouse y
00:42 - variables provided by p5.js whoa this is
00:45 - quite sophisticated here's a really hard
00:47 - thing to do let's see if chat GPT could
00:49 - do it can you draw leaves at the end of
00:53 - the tree
00:54 - this is a tricky challenge internal
00:57 - server error oh well
