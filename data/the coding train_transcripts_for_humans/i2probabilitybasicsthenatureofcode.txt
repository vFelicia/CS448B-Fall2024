00:02 - okay hello okay uh there's a exists
00:07 - warmer and warmer the more you're in
00:08 - here it sucks losing clothing this is
00:10 - where having to stop though processing
00:12 - t-shirt okay hello again
00:14 - here we are um okay so this video I want
00:17 - to talk about probability really basic
00:19 - really simple topic this is not some
00:22 - elaborate five minute video about
00:24 - complex statistics we really want to
00:26 - just think about probability in a very
00:28 - basic way I should say something kind of
00:30 - about this which is I I forgot in my
00:32 - original video and suddenly when I go
00:34 - back and remake all these to be perfect
00:35 - I will get this right that one of the
00:37 - things about this material is we aren't
00:40 - looking for scientific accuracy we're
00:44 - not uh we're not here to you know
00:48 - measure perfectly and recreate with with
00:51 - amazing realism the exact simulated
00:55 - representation of what happens in nature
00:57 - on the screen I have a screen over that
00:59 - I have to turn off because I keep
01:00 - looking at it okay right that's how
01:03 - we're here to do we are here to may have
01:06 - to create the feeling of nature in our
01:08 - programs sometimes that means hey look
01:09 - at the science understand the science
01:11 - right the science into our code
01:13 - sometimes it means blend some
01:15 - weird-looking images we made a Photoshop
01:17 - together to kind of create the feeling
01:18 - of nature
01:19 - I think probability and randomness is a
01:21 - place where we're kind of walking that
01:23 - line a little bit we can use randomness
01:26 - to sort of have this accidental
01:28 - representation of nature in many ways
01:31 - lots of things in nature are random but
01:32 - are they purely random do they have a
01:33 - pattern do they follow Gaussian
01:35 - distributions of random numbers should
01:37 - we use this sort of strange function
01:38 - that produces a smooth madness let's
01:40 - Perlin noise want to look at all these
01:42 - topics but we're going to just start
01:44 - with probability now let's go over here
01:46 - and visit or they were going to visit
01:48 - our random walker it's been running for
01:52 - quite a while and we can see that it's
01:54 - creating this kind of nice random
01:55 - patterns kind of that's how I would
01:58 - describe it um and it's working out
02:01 - quite nicely so what is the thing what
02:03 - how does this random walker relate to
02:04 - probability okay now we see over here
02:09 - this is this is a set of options that a
02:11 - random Walker at any moment will
02:13 - can choose from it can go to the right
02:16 - to the top is the left over to the
02:17 - bottom with equal probability a 25 one
02:20 - out of four chance of moving to the
02:21 - right a one out of four chance of moving
02:22 - to the top left and bottom that's a 25%
02:25 - chance each and in fact when we use the
02:30 - random function and processing for
02:32 - example if we want to pick a random
02:33 - number a random integer and I think we
02:38 - did this in our code this will give us a
02:40 - 0 1 2 or 3 we have an equal probability
02:46 - of picking any one of those a 25% chance
02:48 - of 0 20% and 1 2 3 so this is where we
02:52 - start to realize hmm is this how nature
02:57 - works for example what if we wanted to
03:02 - pick random Heights we're going to
03:05 - create a population of meerkats and
03:07 - we're going to give them all a random
03:08 - height now I don't really know if you
03:09 - compare cats though it's probably a bad
03:11 - example to pick but I have a guess when
03:15 - will the meerkat experts will weigh in
03:17 - in the interactive commenting system we
03:19 - have below which I don't know if it
03:20 - exists and tell me about this whether or
03:22 - not I'm right or not ok let's say we
03:24 - could pick meerkats with the height of 0
03:26 - 1 2 or 3 we'll have 0 also doesn't make
03:28 - any sense but just go with this it's
03:30 - more likely that most of the meerkats
03:32 - meerkats all have a height of around 1.5
03:35 - right somewhere in the middle there the
03:38 - mean right maybe there are rare very
03:41 - rarely some outliers that are very tall
03:42 - or very short and perhaps the meerkats
03:47 - follow this kind of bell curve a
03:49 - Gaussian distribution a normal
03:51 - distribution of of numbers of heights
03:54 - and so I got that's going to be stay
03:58 - tuned this is coming soon and in the
04:00 - next video for you we're going to talk
04:01 - more about how this works and we're
04:03 - actually looking at doing a Gaussian
04:04 - distribution of random numbers in
04:06 - processing but before we get there let's
04:09 - just think of some simpler ways we might
04:12 - do this what if for example we want to
04:15 - adjust these probabilities what if we
04:18 - wanted to say that our random Walker has
04:23 - actually a 50% chance of moving to the
04:25 - right and
04:27 - it has a 20% chance of moving to the
04:30 - left a 15% chance of moving up and a 15%
04:33 - chance of moving down these could I hope
04:35 - that that's up 200 hit us if I'm wrong
04:38 - I'm wrong how could we implement
04:40 - something like this in processing we
04:42 - need to figure out how to have custom
04:44 - distributions of random numbers now this
04:47 - computer over here went to sleep
04:49 - which means I'm standing in front no
04:51 - came back online this program down here
04:54 - is going to give us a clue if you look
04:56 - at this is a particle system it's an
04:58 - example that's coming up in a chapter on
05:01 - chapter week lesson video whatever in
05:04 - the particle system section which is
05:05 - chapter 4 if you're following along in
05:06 - the nature code book notice how often
05:09 - it's making a particle definitely not
05:12 - every frame and certainly not with
05:14 - regularity we can't say particle
05:16 - particle particle notes particle
05:18 - particle particle particle it's making
05:20 - every a particle every frame with I
05:22 - would guess actually because just put an
05:24 - example a 1% chance how do we have
05:27 - something in processing happen with just
05:30 - 1% of the time look at this code now we
05:34 - haven't done all this stuff all this
05:35 - stuff is going to be we're going to get
05:36 - later but we're looking at this line
05:37 - right here if random 1 is less than 0.01
05:41 - let's write that a different way if
05:46 - random 100 is less than 10 here we're
05:53 - picking a random number between 0 and
05:55 - 100 how often will that random number be
05:58 - less than 10 10 percent of the time well
06:01 - 1 or less than 1 1 percent of the time
06:04 - well we could also say random 1 less
06:07 - than 0.01 same thing so this is a way
06:10 - that we could just even begin to start
06:13 - to affect our random Walker we could
06:15 - actually if we go look over here again
06:18 - we could see here is our random Walker a
06:23 - traditional where we go down here and
06:25 - look here are the choices 0 1 2 3 0 1 2
06:29 - or 3 4 options equal probability each
06:31 - time and if I go to this particular
06:34 - example we can say hey what if that
06:37 - random number we pick it's less than
06:39 - point 4 go to the right
06:40 - it's less than 0.6 go to the left these
06:42 - are slightly different probabilities 40%
06:44 - of going to the right
06:45 - 20% going up 20% going down and 20%
06:48 - going to going back to the left and if I
06:52 - run this we'll see what this random
06:54 - Walker does we can see it's generally
06:56 - speaking going to the right now what
06:59 - effect out of me like these are not some
07:02 - well before my heads in front of it I'll
07:04 - just go stand over here these are not
07:05 - earth-shattering examples ah hello these
07:09 - are not earth-shattering examples but
07:11 - these basics will get you started to
07:14 - understanding something about
07:15 - probability I don't want these videos to
07:17 - be too long so I'm going to stop this
07:19 - one and this is just sort of the basics
07:21 - of creating event probability and
07:23 - processing and what could you do with
07:25 - that random Walker could you get it to
07:26 - exhibit some type of pattern that has
07:29 - randomness built into it what could you
07:31 - do that would be even you know that
07:32 - could get it to do something a little
07:33 - bit more I know that has a quality of
07:36 - something you're seeing Elston I'm not
07:38 - sticking up if you get a script and a
07:41 - director to make up we want you're
07:44 - better so so that's that that's that's
07:47 - the end of this one and so think about
07:49 - that and we're going to look in the next
07:51 - couple video series about actually
07:52 - looking at Gaussian random numbers and
07:56 - Perlin noise which I think will allow us
07:58 - to do quite a bit more stuff ok I'm
08:01 - going to hit stop

Cleaned transcript:

okay hello okay uh there's a exists warmer and warmer the more you're in here it sucks losing clothing this is where having to stop though processing tshirt okay hello again here we are um okay so this video I want to talk about probability really basic really simple topic this is not some elaborate five minute video about complex statistics we really want to just think about probability in a very basic way I should say something kind of about this which is I I forgot in my original video and suddenly when I go back and remake all these to be perfect I will get this right that one of the things about this material is we aren't looking for scientific accuracy we're not uh we're not here to you know measure perfectly and recreate with with amazing realism the exact simulated representation of what happens in nature on the screen I have a screen over that I have to turn off because I keep looking at it okay right that's how we're here to do we are here to may have to create the feeling of nature in our programs sometimes that means hey look at the science understand the science right the science into our code sometimes it means blend some weirdlooking images we made a Photoshop together to kind of create the feeling of nature I think probability and randomness is a place where we're kind of walking that line a little bit we can use randomness to sort of have
