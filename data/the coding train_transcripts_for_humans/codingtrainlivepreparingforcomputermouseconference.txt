05:20 - my levels can you hear me all right
05:21 - we're starting in exactly
05:23 - one minute
05:25 - [Music]
05:27 - what i would like to also know is can
05:28 - you hear the clicking
05:38 - adit is watching the coding train live
05:40 - for the first time
05:44 - [Music]
05:50 - welcome
05:52 - [Music]
06:13 - [Music]
06:32 - ah hello welcome to
06:35 - a friday episode of the coding train
06:38 - it has been oh i just scared my poor
06:43 - dog gloria who has been sleeping so
06:45 - quietly over there and i
06:46 - have been very quietly sitting up here
06:48 - in the attic and just made a very loud
06:51 - hello to all of you
06:52 - and she just got up from her bed and
06:54 - left oh well goodbye gloria you can come
06:56 - back
06:57 - no dog cam for today i do have a mouse
06:59 - cam
07:00 - um i see a bunch of people saying this
07:02 - is my first time
07:03 - live well welcome to the first your
07:06 - first
07:06 - not the first live stream of the coding
07:08 - train i don't know what number somebody
07:10 - if actually everyone's from the
07:12 - community wants to volunteer to do this
07:13 - i used to number the live streams
07:16 - and then i would know what number i'm on
07:17 - i i currently have no idea
07:21 - um but uh welcome um i hate to break it
07:23 - to you but um
07:25 - these live streams are kind of a mess
07:27 - but i hope you do enjoy this one i have
07:29 - a very very specific task that i want to
07:33 - do today
07:34 - before i do that task though let me
07:37 - quickly thank
07:38 - today's sponsor and i'm not sure how
07:42 - exactly i'm going to do this i'm going
07:43 - to go over here
07:45 - and i'm going to press this button and
07:47 - oh my mouse
07:49 - mouse cam is right in front of it um but
07:51 - thank you to
07:53 - brilliant you should check out the
07:55 - website and app
07:57 - brilliant if you're interested in math
07:59 - and science and lifelong learning
08:02 - um it's a wonderful um
08:05 - website has a tremendous amount of
08:07 - courses interactive courses that
08:09 - align with a lot of the content that i
08:11 - do on the coding train
08:12 - um and uh you can sign up for free at
08:15 - brilliant.org
08:16 - codingtrain and the first 200
08:18 - subscribers will get 20
08:19 - off i'll come back later there's
08:21 - actually a really i just saw it on the
08:22 - homepage today there's a really fun
08:23 - daily challenge about waves
08:25 - which is very related to my nature of
08:27 - code chapter 3 book on waves so i'm
08:29 - going to do that daily challenge
08:31 - halfway through this live
08:34 - stream okay um back to
08:37 - whoa wrong button wrong button back to
08:40 - here that was by the way the brilliant
08:42 - neural network course which is excellent
08:44 - um and uh stig
08:48 - is saying um i'm specifically here for
08:50 - that mess never stop messing about yeah
08:52 - this is actually some interesting
08:53 - feedback not to get too
08:54 - immediately off on a tangent but i have
08:57 - received the feedback
08:58 - of as the tutorial videos
09:02 - get more and more produced with editing
09:04 - and animations
09:06 - um some of the sort of authentic
09:09 - elements of the original place where i
09:12 - started making these videos has been
09:14 - lost um and of course those authentic
09:17 - elements i hope are
09:19 - here in spades today during this live
09:21 - stream but
09:22 - i am thinking about this and how to
09:24 - balance the desire i have for sort of
09:26 - higher quality
09:27 - video tutorials that people can get
09:29 - through to learn
09:31 - something and create a project as well
09:33 - as the sort of
09:34 - fun mess that is often the coding train
09:38 - so um let's uh
09:41 - and arnov is saying just realized it's
09:43 - been
09:44 - five years watching the coding train mid
09:46 - april 2016. i don't know that's just
09:48 - crazy
09:50 - um lots of stuff is coming to the coding
09:52 - train soon i have
09:54 - all sorts of crazy plans i'm not gonna
09:56 - get into that right now
09:59 - because i have a very specific job that
10:01 - i need to do today and
10:03 - um i don't know how well this is going
10:05 - to go
10:06 - but let me jump right into it um
10:10 - so apologies if you haven't been in a
10:12 - live stream before i'm not going to
10:13 - spend a lot of time introducing myself
10:15 - or what this channel is
10:16 - but i'm going to talk about something
10:17 - that i am participating in that's
10:19 - happening at the end of the month
10:20 - and i have a lot of work to do for it so
10:23 - and i'm
10:24 - like it's really bothering me that
10:25 - there's this little uh keying issue
10:27 - right here
10:28 - um i will let me i'm not going to worry
10:30 - about that right now um i'm gonna i'm
10:32 - just gonna i'm gonna be okay with it
10:33 - um let me jump into what i want to do
10:36 - today so i'm gonna go over here
10:38 - um and i am going to open up no i need
10:41 - to use this mouse
10:42 - to force myself this by the way is a
10:44 - rollerball mouse
10:46 - uh i am going to open up the web browser
10:50 - and i am going to go to oh wait no
10:52 - before i even do that
10:53 - and that's why i need to open up
10:55 - processing so i'm going to open
10:58 - up on the desktop
11:02 - computer mouse
11:06 - mouse data collect i think is the one
11:08 - i'm looking for
11:09 - mouse data collect let me just run this
11:13 - so i want to be running this during the
11:15 - entire live stream today this is
11:17 - collecting
11:18 - data on all of my mouse movements i will
11:21 - come back to it but i wanted to at least
11:23 - set this up and running as i'm
11:27 - going so what am i
11:30 - doing today if i come back to the
11:32 - broadcast i went back to my track pad
11:34 - again
11:35 - everybody you know uh uh a
11:38 - family-friendly show with lots of people
11:39 - who are under the drinking age so i
11:41 - don't want to say drink every time i go
11:42 - back to my track mad but i don't know
11:44 - put a quarter in the jar and donate it
11:46 - to a good cause
11:48 - every time i go back to my track pad uh
11:51 - let's go to
11:52 - a computer mouse conference
11:56 - computer mouse conference 2021 so the
11:59 - computer mouse conference
12:01 - um 2021 and let me just this is a
12:03 - different mouse i need to use to move
12:04 - this
12:06 - is a conference that's happening online
12:09 - it will be hosted on
12:11 - this page which i will uh click to
12:14 - um which is uh complicating the computer
12:17 - mouse
12:17 - um here is uh emma one of the organizers
12:20 - along with ashley
12:22 - lewis of the um computer mouse
12:24 - conference you should definitely watch
12:26 - this
12:26 - the da da of all demos videos which was
12:28 - performed on february 21st
12:30 - 2021 uh basically almost everything that
12:33 - i'm doing
12:33 - for the mouse conference is uh inspired
12:36 - by this particular uh
12:38 - performance um and
12:42 - so yes here are the conference
12:44 - organizers full names uh emma jane lewis
12:46 - and emma ray brumalnorton
12:49 - so i'm doing a bunch of things one i'm
12:51 - just like an incredibly
12:53 - enthusiastic and excited person about
12:55 - the computer mouse conference
12:57 - this is the second one i just followed
12:59 - it online um last year
13:01 - and i um have a chance to
13:04 - um sorry i have a sorry i'm reading the
13:07 - chat while i'm talking which i'm not
13:08 - gonna do
13:09 - um i have a chance to participate this
13:13 - year so i'm doing a couple things one
13:14 - there will be a
13:15 - simultaneous live stream hosted on the
13:18 - coding train
13:19 - during the conference um it uh it's a
13:22 - very i don't want to say too much about
13:23 - it now i'll let you find out about it as
13:25 - it gets announced as we planned it but
13:27 - there will be
13:27 - a live scene made by a wonderful artist
13:31 - um and seen maker who will be
13:34 - creating a live scene during
13:37 - during the conference so you'll want to
13:39 - tune in to the conference on the
13:40 - conference page where all the talks
13:42 - will be played but simultaneously there
13:44 - will be a scene being made
13:46 - and then i am also working on a video
13:49 - for the conference
13:50 - and i've really bitten off way more than
13:53 - i can chew here you know i
13:55 - am someone who has now built up a
13:56 - practice of being able to
13:59 - deliver coding tutorials and i can kind
14:02 - of have an idea and
14:04 - record a video and and work with uh
14:06 - matia who does the video editing and
14:08 - other
14:09 - collaborators of the coding train who
14:10 - help with the website and
14:12 - social media and all those kind of
14:13 - things and get that video out pretty
14:16 - quickly
14:17 - and um i'm trying to do something a
14:19 - little bit more creative and a little
14:20 - strange for the video for this
14:22 - conference
14:23 - um and so um
14:27 - it's kind of it's consuming me it's not
14:29 - exactly why i haven't been live
14:30 - streaming for the last month i was out
14:32 - of town
14:33 - um and didn't have my setup with me i
14:34 - was working but i just didn't have my
14:36 - setup with me
14:36 - but it's kind of what's now consuming me
14:38 - good news for all of you if you're not
14:40 - as interested
14:41 - in me being consumed with the mouse
14:42 - stuff is uh the conference is happening
14:44 - at the end of the month
14:45 - i'll be back to regular coding train
14:47 - stuff in may
14:49 - um i'm i'm a little bit behind i have a
14:51 - whole set of nature of code chapter
14:53 - 5 tutorials all about steering behaviors
14:56 - that i have yet to release
14:58 - there's five videos that i've recorded
15:00 - and are in the process
15:02 - um so what i'm doing today
15:05 - um is i want to build a couple of the
15:08 - coding examples
15:10 - for the um the conference video that i'm
15:14 - making
15:15 - um so that's what's happening today if
15:17 - you will bear with me for a second
15:19 - i um also oh whoa i'm getting some uh
15:22 - messages boom boom boom ding ding ding

15:31 - in um i
15:32 - am now i'm i'm i've i've got we've got a
15:35 - new coding train character
15:37 - um that i'm also going to present to you
15:39 - please as you were
15:40 - uh talk amongst yourselves for a minute
15:43 - [Music]
15:52 - boy what am i i forgot that i was still

16:24 - i just had to go into my direct messages
16:26 - to grab these images which is why i
16:27 - don't want to show you what i'm doing
16:29 - image number three
16:31 - [Music]
16:34 - and i think i've got one more to get

17:15 - notifications uh
17:19 - [Music]
17:23 - okay hold on almost there almost back
17:27 - grabbing these files um back to
17:32 - the coding train discord
17:35 - hide this
17:39 - and make sure i have uh
17:45 - where's that um in discord the
17:48 - streamer safe mode
17:52 - this is not going very well streamer
17:54 - mode
17:55 - enabled okay great got it
17:58 - okay and now one more button to press
18:04 - okay and um
18:08 - i'm coming back to you in three i mean
18:11 - i'm actually here
18:12 - coming back to you in three two
18:16 - one here we are
18:20 - now before i can go any further i need
18:23 - to figure
18:24 - something out so what i'm going to do
18:26 - and i simon thank you for all your
18:28 - reminders i'm i'm not doing a good job
18:29 - of using this mouse
18:30 - maybe if i just pick a different one
18:32 - maybe we should have i have a whole bag
18:34 - of old computer mics here
18:36 - this is actually one of my favorites
18:38 - this particular mouse
18:39 - has an actual like floating sailboat in
18:43 - it let's try this one
18:44 - see if it works i don't know if any of
18:45 - these work these are all um
18:47 - old ps2 mice and so i
18:50 - um have an adapter
18:54 - i'm gonna unplug the crayola one and
18:56 - let's try this one i have this amazing
18:58 - mickey mouse mouse
19:00 - um but i'll show it to you in a second
19:02 - but that one i couldn't get to work
19:04 - i don't know what i did with it actually
19:06 - um all right let's see how's this
19:09 - oh this one works really well okay this
19:11 - one works much better
19:13 - let's try this one for a little while
19:14 - it's also a roller roll mount look you
19:15 - can even see the water there
19:18 - okay so this is my data that i'm
19:20 - collecting so far
19:22 - um all right so what i the next thing i
19:24 - need to do i've got a bunch of things i
19:26 - need to do here
19:27 - one is uh right so now i can pepper
19:31 - these around
19:34 - the desktop should look kind of busy
19:37 - with lots of things on it
19:38 - oh so one thing you're not realizing
19:40 - probably and i'm going to just reveal
19:42 - this to you
19:44 - is that this is not actually what my
19:46 - desktop looks like
19:48 - i am going to go to too many things open
19:53 - uh laptop properties nope not properties
19:59 - laptop filters so this is what my
20:03 - desktop actually looks like and maybe i
20:04 - should just live stream with it
20:07 - looking exactly as it really looks it's
20:09 - got a solid green background
20:11 - but in open broadcast studio i'm keying
20:13 - out that background
20:15 - and i have this like these mouse
20:16 - characters there
20:18 - and what i need to do no no no stig is
20:21 - asking it's a mickey mouse mouse i gotta
20:23 - find it
20:24 - um where is my mickey mouse mouse
20:27 - oh here it is i hereby present to you
20:31 - the mickey mouse mouse
20:36 - um but what is very important that i do
20:40 - is i need to be capturing my screen this
20:43 - entire live stream
20:45 - but i i i could obviously this
20:48 - whole stream is being recorded and
20:50 - archived but it's got me in it it's got
20:52 - the
20:52 - uh the mouse cam in it so i think what i
20:55 - will do
20:57 - um is i'm just gonna open up open
20:59 - broadcast studio
21:00 - if you haven't seen this software before
21:02 - there we are there i am
21:04 - um and let me
21:08 - create a scene called
21:13 - uh desktop
21:17 - um and then i am going to add
21:21 - a uh um not window capture display
21:24 - capture
21:26 - and that's fine let's just call it so
21:29 - this is now capturing the full display
21:32 - um and then let's just check the
21:34 - settings
21:36 - um output
21:40 - um recording path that's fine
21:44 - high quality medium file size
21:47 - probably fine i'm afraid to make it much
21:50 - larger mp4 is a little bit scary because
21:53 - if it crashes
21:55 - [Music]
21:57 - can i make this higher i guess this will
21:59 - be fine right does anybody have any
22:01 - uh suggestions before i press record
22:04 - on what settings um
22:10 - um all right i think i'm gonna just be
22:13 - okay with this what if i go here
22:15 - video oh canvas resolution output scaled
22:18 - yeah this is this is this is all fine
22:21 - okay i'm gonna leave it as such
22:25 - i'm going to hit start recording so now
22:28 - i am recording everything that i do on
22:30 - my desktop
22:31 - the other thing that i want to record is
22:34 - this mouse cam
22:35 - footage how am i going to do
22:39 - that uh all right somebody
22:42 - tell me um
22:45 - jeffrey is saying you should disable
22:47 - window tinting in the settings so all
22:49 - the windows aren't green i don't know
22:50 - how to do that
22:52 - if somebody wants to give me um
22:57 - if so i really have to turn my
22:59 - notifications off
23:00 - i'm getting so by the way this is i'm
23:02 - gonna i'm in a like a crazy place right
23:04 - now because i have so much going on in
23:06 - so many different aspects of my life
23:08 - but we're gonna make this happen window
23:10 - tinting is in mac os
23:11 - system preferences the thing is i don't
23:14 - really mind
23:16 - um what i'm gonna use this for i don't
23:19 - really
23:19 - mind having the window tinting i think
23:23 - but the stream is laggy
23:26 - is that i've that's the second message i
23:29 - saw about that
23:31 - you know i don't see anything being
23:33 - laggy but
23:34 - what can i um hopefully it's um
23:38 - just i'm not so not um everybody hm all
23:41 - right
23:42 - so here's what i need now i was really
23:44 - by the way i was setting up for this
23:46 - live stream starting at 9am this morning
23:48 - and obviously i didn't finish because
23:49 - i'm still trying to set them things up i
23:51 - want to also record
23:53 - this so what's the equivalent i have
23:56 - open broadcast studio running already to
23:58 - stream
23:59 - so i don't want to record to disk with
24:01 - open broadcast studio
24:02 - but what can i use this is hooked up to
24:05 - my windows computer just to record
24:08 - the output to disk of this particular
24:10 - camera
24:11 - as one big video file while i'm
24:13 - streaming
24:14 - um windows
24:17 - um
24:22 - oh you know what i wonder if the chroma
24:24 - keying is causing it to be really slow
24:27 - so let's turn off the chroma keying the
24:30 - fact that obs has to chroma key the
24:31 - desktop
24:32 - let's see i have by the way i also have
24:34 - this mouse
24:36 - which i'm using to control the windows
24:37 - computer so
24:39 - like uh let me turn off and see if that
24:42 - um
24:42 - let me turn off the chroma keying that
24:44 - was just to make it visually nicer for
24:46 - those of you watching
24:47 - but it's more authentically gr this is
24:50 - actually what i'm uh streaming
24:52 - um okay vbs i'm being told
24:56 - um so tell me if this
25:00 - uh fixes oh no it does look
25:04 - kind of choppy even in open broadcast
25:08 - studio why do you think that is
25:11 - that's weird i've never had this issue i
25:14 - could try unplugging and plugging back
25:16 - in
25:16 - that always usb capture hdmi
25:19 - highest frame let's just give me a
25:21 - second here let me unplug this
25:27 - no signal
25:30 - i'm gonna plug it back in
25:39 - no it's still kind of choppy the
25:42 - the good news is what i'm i mean i think
25:44 - it's still watchable
25:45 - and my you know this is the important
25:48 - recording that i'm making now
25:50 - which i don't think has any issues in it
25:53 - um
25:55 - reboot yeah uh
25:59 - handbrake
26:05 - uh the capture of your laptop is low fps
26:09 - yeah i totally agree all right i can try
26:11 - to debug this
26:13 - a little bit longer let's try this
26:17 - so now i'm doing something crazy on my
26:18 - back i switched cameras
26:20 - let's go back to this device default
26:24 - custom
26:29 - whoa highest fps match output fps
26:33 - whoa now it's gone
26:37 - device default
26:43 - i i have a better idea of what to do a
26:46 - little bit extreme
26:47 - this
26:50 - but i'm gonna do it is
26:57 - i think this is probably not ah
27:01 - i think i had it into one of the lower
27:03 - speed usb ports
27:05 - that i didn't realize let's see if this
27:07 - fixes it
27:15 - oh so it's gone now which it should be
27:19 - thank you all for bearing with me
27:21 - here this is uh okay
27:30 - yeah fixed right that's fixed
27:34 - it was in a um i unplugged my whole
27:37 - setup when i went away because i was
27:38 - using some of the equipment and i
27:40 - plugged
27:40 - the hd the hdmi capture uh device into a
27:44 - lower speed usb
27:46 - port so i think we should be good now um
27:49 - okay uh now the next thing i need to do
27:52 - is i need to re
27:53 - of course this is now totally frozen
27:57 - nothing works right uh properties
28:02 - uh this is so uh
28:05 - and here we go
28:09 - there now this is back um now what i
28:12 - need to do
28:13 - is figure out how to record um
28:17 - record this camera so i'm still looking
28:20 - for
28:21 - a window a piece of windows sort of
28:23 - software
28:25 - um that
28:28 - just i could i could guess i could run
28:30 - another instance of obs
28:32 - right whoa i could run another instance
28:35 - of obs and just have that one recording
28:37 - just this
28:38 - to disk
28:42 - um let's see about that
28:45 - um now because this is
28:49 - a little bit ridiculous what i'm doing
28:51 - here but let's see what do i have here
29:00 - okay what piece of software do i have
29:04 - that will allow me to record this
29:06 - camera um
29:19 - [Music]
29:22 - i'm looking at all the software i have
29:24 - on this computer
29:26 - video lan what's that
29:30 - oh that's vlc i don't think the voice
29:32 - recorder windows
29:38 - um
29:44 - powerpoint screen recording
29:48 - zoom should i just use zoom
29:51 - i'm gonna use zoom and log into a zoom
29:54 - meeting
29:55 - this is actually not the worst idea
29:56 - because we'll record it to the cloud
29:58 - all right this is crazy i'm gonna open
30:00 - up zoom
30:03 - [Laughter]
30:07 - uh because i know this will work this is
30:10 - totally ridiculous what i'm doing i'm
30:12 - gonna do it anyway
30:18 - um let's see
30:23 - oh please wait for the host to start
30:24 - this meeting no i am the host
30:30 - i am the host you have found that out
30:33 - haven't you
30:34 - join with computer audio start
30:37 - video now let's go to this overhead
30:40 - camera
30:40 - as my video and
30:46 - oh we can't access the camera because
30:49 - it's being used
30:50 - by obs i forgot that windows can't have
30:52 - two pieces of software
30:53 - all right i'm gonna give up on that i'm
30:56 - giving up on this i'm recording my
30:57 - desktop that's good enough
30:59 - um this um
31:03 - this will be the recording this little
31:05 - box will be the recording of the mouse
31:07 - movements
31:08 - [Laughter]
31:10 - okay
31:13 - all right hi again
31:17 - is it 10 30 how am i doing terribly
31:20 - terribly terribly terribly thank you all
31:23 - you are the kindest
31:24 - nicest most wonderful people on the
31:26 - internet who are very
31:27 - patient with me um
31:31 - yeah i could use the virtual camera so
31:34 - many things i could do to record it but
31:35 - i'm
31:36 - i'm giving up on it i don't think it's
31:38 - that big of a deal if i'm not
31:39 - separately recording me using the mouse
31:42 - all right
31:44 - so the two projects i would like to
31:46 - build and i'm curious to see if anybody
31:48 - um has a strong preference as to what i
31:52 - start with
31:53 - but and actually you know what forget it
31:56 - i'm gonna start with what
31:57 - i plan to start with and what i know how
31:59 - to do
32:01 - here is one of the core ideas that i am
32:04 - going to talk about
32:05 - in my mouse conference video
32:09 - i'm going to make a very basic p5js
32:13 - and this is um i guess i'll just leave
32:15 - this up here again i have to try to use
32:17 - this mouse
32:18 - i'm going to make a very basic uh p5.js
32:23 - example for you right now
32:28 - and let's make the font a little bit
32:30 - bigger
32:32 - i think i usually put it at 32.
32:38 - if mousex is greater than 200
32:43 - background um
32:47 - red i need to look at my script
32:53 - hold on because in the script that i've
32:55 - written that i'm going to record i guess
32:57 - i'm going to
32:58 - record it later i could just do whatever
32:59 - i did here all right i'll match it i
33:01 - haven't recorded it yet
33:02 - i'm going to record some voiceover to
33:03 - explain this example so i'm going to say
33:05 - if the mouse
33:06 - is on the right-hand side of the window
33:10 - this is bothering me i use the wrong
33:12 - mouse again but that's down here there
33:13 - we go
33:14 - um then color the background red
33:19 - otherwise color the background green if
33:22 - it's on the left hand and i definitely
33:23 - should not use green
33:26 - because i'm keying out the color green
33:27 - that's the wrong mouse i have so many
33:29 - different mice
33:30 - all right so let's say it'll be blue
33:34 - if it is on the left hand side so this
33:37 - is
33:38 - this is one of the first things that
33:41 - you not you specifically you the person
33:44 - watching this live stream right now
33:46 - but the royal you so to speak um
33:50 - might learn in an intro to coding course
33:53 - so
33:53 - this is something that i that as a first
33:55 - example of a couple things one
33:58 - conditional logic and thank you um
34:01 - uh object is making an excellent uh
34:03 - suggestion which it would make more
34:04 - sense
34:05 - for me to write in width divided by two
34:10 - in order to if i were to change the
34:12 - window the canvas size
34:14 - now it still works i might also
34:18 - just for um
34:22 - being able to see some see kind of
34:25 - what's going on
34:26 - i might want to draw a line from
34:31 - the center to the bottom
34:35 - and boy i got my x's and y's mixed up
34:38 - line
34:39 - of x comma y and then
34:42 - x comma y
34:47 - there we go so i see that line uh maybe
34:49 - we'll make that
34:51 - um a little brighter and
34:54 - uh we'll make it a little bit thicker
34:57 - i'm
34:57 - using the wrong mouse again so now we
34:59 - can see blue
35:01 - red blue red red blue
35:04 - red blue so i have
35:07 - this kind of theory here i don't know if
35:10 - it's really a theory but one of the
35:11 - things i want to discuss
35:13 - and think about is what does it mean
35:17 - that uh how do how do what is an
35:21 - effective way to teach
35:22 - and understand machine learning and so
35:25 - there's a talk
35:26 - um kyle mcdonald you can find this
35:28 - online the kik
35:29 - festival there's a recording of his talk
35:32 - on vimeo
35:33 - from the kick festival talks about and
35:35 - this is not his original idea but he has
35:37 - a really nice quote in that talk about
35:39 - it
35:39 - talks about programming as
35:42 - writing instructions for the computer to
35:45 - follow i'm paraphrasing here of course
35:47 - whereas machine learning is instead of
35:49 - writing the instructions for the
35:51 - computer to follow
35:52 - is providing the examples
35:56 - for the um uh for the computer to learn
36:00 - from
36:00 - to then develop the instructions right
36:04 - so if if a um
36:08 - so in other words here are some here are
36:10 - some examples
36:12 - here's some examples of the mouse on the
36:13 - right-hand side of the screen
36:15 - here are some examples of the mouse on
36:17 - the left-hand side of the screen
36:19 - can you learn from that to extrapolate
36:22 - knowing whether the mouse is on the
36:24 - right-hand side or the left-hand side
36:26 - that is the essence in some ways of
36:28 - machine learning as opposed to
36:30 - kind of traditional programming which is
36:33 - here's a very explicit rule so i like
36:35 - this scenario
36:36 - because it is incredibly ridiculous
36:40 - right i don't believe i don't know that
36:43 - rewriting this code
36:45 - with a neural network to decide whether
36:48 - to color the background blue or red
36:50 - what value does that add it's like
36:53 - tremendous amount of overkill
36:54 - um in terms of just this if this is what
36:56 - i want the program to do
36:58 - but my theory here what i want to
36:59 - suggest here is that this
37:01 - could be an effective way to rewrite
37:03 - this code to do
37:04 - uh and and peter in the chat thank you
37:06 - for this is saying can be described as
37:08 - explicit versus implicit as well which
37:10 - is excellent um
37:12 - terminology to sort of think about in
37:13 - this context so what i want to do right
37:15 - now and i'm giving myself about 25
37:17 - minutes
37:18 - is i want to rewrite this example to in
37:21 - to to do
37:22 - exactly the same thing when i move the
37:24 - mouse left
37:25 - and right the color of the background
37:27 - changes
37:28 - but rather than have an if statement
37:32 - i'm going to have a neural network uh
37:36 - operate on the uh classifying the points
37:39 - as left and right hand side now you
37:40 - might be saying like
37:41 - are you insane i mean well clearly the
37:44 - answer to that is
37:44 - somewhat uh you know we can make
37:46 - arguments on both sides
37:48 - but i you know how are you gonna do that
37:50 - in 25 minutes so
37:51 - you know i'm not going to build a neural
37:53 - network from scratch although i do have
37:55 - like a 10-part video series
37:58 - um and um what i'm going to do instead
38:02 - is use the ml5 library so let's get
38:04 - started and i'm going to go to ml5
38:09 - js and i
38:12 - am using the wrong mouse again i am
38:14 - going to get go to the get started page
38:18 - i am going to find
38:21 - uh this and
38:25 - so i can import the ml5 library into
38:29 - index.html i better save this by the way
38:32 - and i'm going to call this
38:33 - mouse learning that's the title of my
38:35 - talk
38:36 - mouse learning and
38:40 - i don't need the sound library so i know
38:42 - that second one is the sound library
38:44 - so let's paste in this and the other
38:46 - thing i i really prefer to do
38:47 - is um hold on ml5 and
38:51 - i just oops ml5 github
38:56 - wrong mouse again i can't i can't get it
38:58 - right i should switch by the way i need
39:00 - a like reminder to switch mice every
39:02 - every once in a while so i have a lot of
39:03 - fun ones to try
39:05 - um uh library
39:10 - uh releases where are the releases
39:14 - 0.6.1 so i i prefer rather than saying
39:17 - latest
39:18 - to put just put a version number in um
39:22 - and
39:26 - so what do i need let's let me duplicate
39:30 - this
39:31 - i'm going to do duplicate i should
39:32 - probably just look so i have these as
39:34 - separate versions
39:37 - and i want to have a variable and i'm
39:40 - going to call it
39:41 - model for machine learning model
39:46 - and the model is an ml5
39:50 - neural network
39:54 - and typically when you create an ml5
39:56 - neural network
39:57 - the idea is that you have to give it
39:59 - some configuration information
40:01 - about what are the inputs and what are
40:03 - the outputs
40:05 - so and um so i'm going to
40:08 - make a javascript object called options
40:11 - and the inputs are
40:14 - i forget how this works so i'm going to
40:16 - just try to do it from memory and then
40:18 - i'll look at the reference we'll see
40:19 - where i went wrong
40:20 - i just need an x and a y so those will
40:22 - be the inputs to the neural network
40:24 - right
40:24 - the inputs the inputs actually oh i just
40:27 - need the x
40:28 - oh my goodness this is a neural network
40:30 - with one input how insane
40:32 - let's let's let's go with the simplest
40:34 - possible i mean it's again
40:36 - this is absurd um
40:40 - yeah and simon's giving me a very good
40:42 - note here
40:43 - which is that um i shouldn't call this
40:46 - model
40:47 - we'll call this i'll just call this
40:48 - brain because this is going to be the
40:50 - brain of my program
40:52 - because model is a built-in variable
40:54 - maybe in p5 and it can cause a conflict
40:57 - the outputs are
41:01 - let's call it left and right
41:04 - as the sort of labels of what i'm
41:06 - classifying then i want to say debug is
41:08 - true
41:09 - which is um not so important right now
41:12 - but i'll show you where that comes into
41:14 - play later when i start debugging the
41:15 - neural network
41:17 - so um let's give myself a little bit
41:19 - more space to code
41:21 - and let me hit run things are still
41:24 - working
41:25 - no errors we're in good shape here
41:28 - i think and by the way i'm still by the
41:31 - this is all of my mouse movements
41:33 - so far from today that i'm
41:36 - collecting this data because i'm going
41:37 - to do something else with this data
41:40 - i'll come back to that uh yeah i'll come
41:43 - back to that in a little bit that's
41:44 - using something called the java robot
41:46 - class which i definitely want to refer
41:47 - to
41:51 - okay so now that i have this
41:54 - what's next i want to i need to collect
41:56 - some data
41:58 - um and and just to be clear about this
42:02 - um if if this is all completely new to
42:04 - you
42:05 - um i would suggest this tutorial set of
42:08 - tutorials that i have
42:09 - i'm kind of redoing very in a very
42:11 - fast-paced way
42:12 - this um ml5 train your own neural
42:15 - network
42:16 - save data save model there's a
42:18 - regression example so
42:20 - all of these video tutorials that i have
42:21 - on the channel if you're
42:23 - brand new today and machine learning is
42:26 - totally new to you i've never seen ml5
42:28 - before
42:28 - these videos would hopefully give you
42:30 - some more context okay
42:32 - so i'm going to add the mouse pressed
42:33 - function
42:37 - then i believe whenever i press the
42:40 - mouse i should just make
42:41 - a bit of data that has mouse x mouse y
42:45 - you know what would be great
42:46 - the input should actually just be mouse
42:48 - x i should call the label
42:50 - input mouse x and i can't bring myself
42:53 - to not
42:53 - use mouse y but i'm gonna
42:57 - and then and then the object i can use
42:59 - that fancy enhanced object literal
43:01 - by just saying this is the data that's
43:03 - the input to the neural network
43:06 - uh oh and thank you soren for um
43:10 - for uh providing links about what i'm
43:11 - talking about into the chat that's uh
43:13 - wonderful it's so helpful and i so
43:15 - appreciate when people do that okay
43:17 - next up the um
43:20 - the label so here's where it gets starts
43:24 - getting really absurd
43:25 - oh so this is the input that's the input
43:28 - now the output
43:32 - is honestly like i kind of lost i don't
43:35 - know what i'm doing
43:36 - i'm going to assume the output is left
43:40 - and then if mouse x is greater than
43:42 - width
43:44 - divided by two the output should be
43:47 - let's just call this label right now
43:48 - label is left the label should be
43:54 - uh right
43:57 - and then i believe i can say brain dot
44:00 - add data inputs
44:03 - and uh and then i think i'm supposed to
44:05 - put the label in an array
44:09 - there's a lot of different ways you can
44:10 - do this with ml5 and i'm kind of
44:12 - guessing as i'm going because i don't
44:13 - like know it off the top of my head
44:16 - because you could have multiple
44:17 - outputs multiple classifications or
44:19 - regressions
44:20 - so maybe this isn't the friendliest way
44:23 - to write it
44:24 - but the idea is the inputs are just one
44:27 - thing
44:27 - the mousex value and the output is
44:29 - either left or right
44:31 - so let's just run this to see if i get
44:33 - any errors
44:35 - click click click click i think it would
44:37 - be helpful if i console log
44:40 - something like um adding
44:43 - data
44:46 - mouse x um adding
44:50 - i'll just do like this input
44:53 - mousex comma
44:55 - [Music]
44:57 - comma output
45:00 - label so we'll see something hopefully
45:04 - up here
45:06 - now yeah right right left
45:09 - left so the um the console log is
45:12 - showing me stuff that's correct so
45:13 - that's i'm adding that data
45:15 - to the neural network
45:18 - and then uh
45:21 - i guess i'm going to use keep rest i can
45:23 - make a button
45:24 - let's make a button to make this example
45:26 - a little bit nicer
45:28 - let's make a variable called train
45:30 - button
45:32 - train button equals create button train
45:36 - for coding train
45:40 - then i will say train
45:43 - button mouse pressed
45:47 - and then brain dot train
45:50 - and i believe when i
45:53 - is that right mouse pressed oh no hold
45:55 - on
45:57 - [Music]
45:58 - function
46:00 - i have no idea what i'm doing i forgot
46:01 - how to write javascript
46:03 - to call the train function now there's
46:04 - also options i think the only option i
46:06 - really care about
46:07 - is something called epochs and i'm just
46:10 - going to make that one right now
46:12 - and epoch is a
46:15 - training cycle over all of the data so
46:18 - again everything i'm doing here is
46:21 - uh um basically
46:24 - uh absurd because i am
46:27 - trying to train an all powerful neural
46:30 - network
46:31 - with one input and one output equivalent
46:33 - to just
46:34 - is the mouse on the left and right hand
46:36 - side so how much data i have what all
46:38 - the sort of like what's the learning
46:40 - rate all these things are kind of
46:41 - really arbitrary right now let me just
46:43 - see if this gives me any errors
46:45 - and by the way this is now where debug
46:47 - comes in so once i hit
46:49 - this train button i should see a debug
46:52 - window
46:53 - that's showing me a graph of the loss so
46:55 - as the neural network is learning from
46:57 - these examples right
46:58 - these examples of and i'll do this now
47:00 - of like right right right
47:02 - right right right right right left left
47:04 - left left left left left left left left
47:07 - left left left
47:08 - left left i should really draw something
47:11 - as i'm doing this
47:12 - it'll be much more interesting visually
47:13 - because ultimately this uh screen
47:15 - capture that i'm doing
47:17 - is going to be um in this video that i'm
47:20 - making
47:20 - and so i'm now let me i'm going to keep
47:22 - going but i'm going to add something to
47:23 - draw
47:24 - because i think that'll be kind of
47:26 - important so i'm going to hit train
47:28 - and let's see what happens and i got an
47:30 - error
47:31 - so that's good i mean not good that i
47:33 - got an error but
47:34 - cannot read property to lower case of
47:36 - null
47:41 - huh line 16
47:44 - brain train
47:48 - all right let's let's look at the ml5
47:51 - neural network
47:52 - documentation it's time um
47:56 - and uh train no train model
48:00 - and and train oh that looks like i did
48:04 - it kind of right
48:08 - um let's see what did i get wrong here
48:15 - also just afraid that my i want to make
48:17 - sure my um
48:19 - obs thing is still recording yeah okay
48:22 - it looks like it is i
48:23 - kind of want to stop it just to check
48:24 - the file but i'll keep going
48:27 - um what did i get wrong cannot read
48:29 - property two lowercase of no
48:31 - hold on let's look at the javascript
48:33 - console here
48:34 - let me hit stop
48:36 - [Music]
48:38 - because oh yeah this is something in
48:42 - ml5 now is this a bug
48:45 - that i found or
48:50 - um hold on let's look
48:53 - let's see if i
48:58 - let's look at
49:03 - inputs well i could also do it as just a
49:05 - number
49:06 - no average temperature oh oh it's not an
49:09 - op
49:10 - no that's right oh
49:14 - left right that looks
49:19 - this looks right
49:22 - i guess i could say output label is that
49:24 - actually what i'm supposed to be doing
49:31 - is it just freaked out because there's
49:32 - only one data point
49:40 - all right let's just because i'm like
49:43 - it's making me paranoid that it's gonna
49:45 - like
49:46 - not work without at least two inputs
49:49 - because why would you ever have a neural
49:51 - network with one input
49:53 - so let me um add a second input here
49:58 - and
49:58 - [Music]
50:03 - let me look for the add data function
50:06 - inputs is an object output oh you know
50:08 - that's another way i could do it
50:10 - i think maybe actually the way that i
50:13 - should be doing this
50:14 - is
50:18 - this let's try it this way
50:23 - [Music]
50:24 - um
50:29 - okay still got an error
50:34 - what if i say
50:37 - this here
50:46 - weird uh
50:49 - i haven't been working with the recent
50:51 - ml5 let's just try like this
50:55 - whoops is there not a point one
51:08 - whoa i messed something up
51:28 - okay so that at least this error is
51:32 - not like some new error
51:37 - oh oh my goodness master stormer
51:42 - in the discord member chat i forgot
51:45 - something
51:45 - so important where's my sound effect of
51:49 - me
51:50 - being very sad
51:53 - like this could be my sound effect me
51:54 - being happy
51:55 - [Music]
51:57 - uh i forgot um the default task
52:01 - that ml5 performs is a regression
52:05 - which says has the output of the neural
52:08 - network be a floating point number
52:10 - so let's just see what this gives me
52:16 - yeah there we go something else went
52:19 - wrong but that's fine
52:21 - uh all right all right that's fine okay
52:25 - let's
52:26 - get to um this is we're getting closer
52:30 - now
52:32 - that was definitely an issue let's try
52:35 - um
52:36 - i want to go back to this
52:41 - i don't know why that i wanted to do it
52:43 - this way it kind of doesn't make sense
52:46 - maybe but
52:49 - one two three four one two
52:52 - three four uh train
52:58 - so what just happened there
53:02 - shoot
53:05 - okay let's go back to an earlier version
53:08 - of ml5
53:19 - same error that's good i just want to
53:21 - make sure it's not like
53:26 - okay what did i miss in terms of how i'm
53:30 - setting this up
53:35 - uh i think the
53:40 - let me look at my uh examples that go
53:43 - along with uh let me look at this
53:46 - particular example
53:47 - to find out so this example is from
53:51 - it's basically i'm rebuilding what is in
53:55 - uh
53:56 - this code example and if i go to the web
53:59 - editor
54:02 - now um yeah yeah i got it i got it
54:08 - xy label
54:13 - oh i did forget to normalize the no but
54:15 - that i did forget to normalize the data
54:19 - before i trained it um
54:23 - and inputs x
54:26 - y add data
54:30 - target where's it is
54:33 - an object with the label okay so let me
54:36 - try to mirror this
54:38 - [Music]
54:43 - an object with the label so
54:46 - and what did i just say i forgot to do i
54:48 - forgot to say
54:50 - in the train button brain dot normalize
54:53 - data now this should really be the same
54:56 - as that example that's the only thing
54:58 - um it should work without normalizing it
55:00 - like in terms of not giving me an error
55:02 - it just should be kind of
55:05 - awkward so let's try this
55:12 - try clicking clicking clicking clicking
55:14 - clicking
55:16 - the train let's give it
55:20 - some more epochs because it's this like
55:24 - so
55:24 - fast
55:33 - what did i do that's different from
55:36 - [Music]
55:42 - so did why did hmm
55:49 - change outputs back to left right i
55:52 - don't think
55:56 - i'll try that it really shouldn't matter
55:59 - actually
56:00 - the interesting thing
56:03 - is
56:06 - honestly like this is not necessary at
56:09 - all
56:10 - um ml5 is set up to once you've added
56:13 - data
56:14 - to like figure out what the
56:16 - configuration is of the inputs and the
56:18 - outputs
56:20 - so let me try
56:24 - and let's do it this way i want to say
56:27 - console.log
56:29 - inputs
56:33 - and
56:37 - console.log let's just look at both of
56:41 - these just to be sure
56:46 - two three yeah so that's this is what
56:49 - i'm putting in you can see it down here
56:57 - let's call train let's look at this
57:03 - e is not a function call back
57:06 - oh oh i know what the problem is i'm
57:10 - such a dum-dum
57:12 - i think i just forgot to be no yeah so
57:14 - that like
57:15 - kate weakman is suggesting your model
57:16 - might be too complex to be trained with
57:19 - so little dina dana no no i honestly i
57:21 - think what this is is i'm
57:23 - just forgetting like an important step
57:25 - which is that um i do need to give it at
57:26 - least one callback
57:29 - like i don't think there's anything in
57:30 - the model in the ml5 code that will
57:33 - account for
57:34 - um when you if you don't bother to give
57:37 - it like
57:37 - you finished training callback
57:42 - i i literally think it's just this
57:46 - which i should have realized from the
57:48 - jump
57:50 - so i'm clicking i'm clicking
57:54 - i'm gonna hit train
57:59 - yeah see i just didn't have a call back
58:01 - sorry everybody
58:02 - that was the problem uh and i realized
58:06 - i'm kind of like sitting in front of
58:07 - some of this so
58:08 - that you can't see but hopefully you're
58:10 - following all right so now
58:12 - and and i would like to be able to see
58:14 - more of the code
58:15 - so let me do this all right so the uh
58:17 - the thing that i would like to do now
58:21 - is uh have it draw the the data
58:25 - so um
58:28 - can i um
58:32 - i mean this is i'm just gonna do this
58:34 - myself
58:36 - uh i think i could get the
58:39 - actually all right let's let's let's
58:41 - look at the data uh
58:42 - in uh ml5 itself so i can figure out
58:45 - where it is
58:50 - so i'm clicking and then i want to
58:55 - um basically
58:59 - evaluate myself i think if i look at
59:00 - this brain object and i
59:03 - apologize that this is here because now
59:06 - i want you to look here
59:07 - um and this too many mice this i can
59:11 - close
59:12 - um this here is i believe it's in
59:15 - brain.data maybe
59:18 - training array zero
59:22 - um what if i say brain.normalize
59:25 - data and now it's there so where was it
59:30 - before i called normalize
59:41 - add data load data save data that's so
59:44 - weird where
59:45 - it's got to be saved somewhere hold on
59:48 - let me run this again
59:53 - okay now this is
59:56 - silly because i could just look this up
59:58 - probably in the ml5 documentation
60:03 - data training array
60:06 - hmm where did the data go metadata
60:11 - add data load data normalized data
60:17 - so strange like why is the data nowhere
60:20 - until neural network data
60:22 - ah raw
60:26 - here it is so this is um
60:30 - you know i could just save my own mouse
60:32 - clicks
60:34 - but i would like to get accesses so this
60:36 - was
60:38 - uh brain dot neural network
60:42 - data dot data dot raw
60:46 - okay how are we doing oh it's 11 o'clock
60:49 - we're really close
60:50 - i'm really close i'm going to move
60:52 - through this a little bit so now in draw
60:55 - i want to say let data equals what i say
60:59 - brain
61:00 - dot neural network data dot data dot
61:05 - raw right and then for let um
61:11 - row of data console.log
61:15 - row let's put this in mouse press just
61:18 - for a second
61:19 - so i can see if this is actually right
61:26 - so yeah i got an object with x's
61:30 - mouse x mouse y so if i take
61:33 - this and go
61:36 - here then i can say um
61:40 - circle um
61:44 - row dot x's dot mouse
61:47 - x row dot x's dot
61:50 - mouse y fill
61:54 - 255. so let's do that
61:59 - errors whoops
62:02 - no stop console logging
62:06 - am i in draw oh i need to give it a um
62:10 - actual size there we go
62:13 - okay great so that's that and then
62:16 - uh fill you know what i should make the
62:18 - labels red and blue
62:21 - right so let's make the labels
62:25 - red and blue that way
62:29 - i can just say fill
62:33 - um row.wise.label
62:43 - and i shouldn't have this anymore
62:48 - and we can say
62:51 - [Music]
62:53 - no stroke
62:59 - and there we go
63:03 - okay great okay so now i have
63:18 - i am i'm ready for the next step here
63:22 - which is to see if the model oh and
63:25 - sorry this is totally
63:26 - in your way again
63:30 - um okay sorry about that one two three
63:33 - four let's see if i can get it to work
63:35 - with like
63:37 - i don't know 20 data points
63:44 - that's a lot all right now i'm going to
63:47 - train the model
63:51 - and i guess i should give it more epochs
63:57 - let's give it a 50 epochs and i kind of
64:00 - want to go back to not having mouse y
64:04 - let's go back to no mouse y okay
64:08 - because now we should be able to do that
64:10 - uh
64:11 - oh wrong mouse
64:16 - uh and now
64:21 - wait what just happened oh because
64:25 - oh but i do want the mouse
64:29 - i do want if i'm going to draw it okay
64:32 - fine i'll keep the mouse why
64:34 - it's it's it's irrelevant information
64:37 - but i'm going to keep it
64:40 - i'm going to keep it just for my own
64:41 - sanity right now because i also need to
64:43 - finish this
64:45 - [Music]
64:49 - so let's also while i'm here
64:53 - let's say um
64:57 - hold on i can do this i can do this i
65:00 - can do this what am i doing next
65:02 - ah is trained
65:06 - is trained as false
65:10 - when the training is complete
65:15 - is trained is true
65:19 - and then in draw
65:22 - if is trained the inputs
65:26 - i'm going to make new inputs is mouse x
65:31 - mouse y then the
65:35 - output the the output is
65:38 - take the brain and call classify i'm
65:41 - going to try calling classify sync
65:43 - so normally sync would require an
65:45 - asynchronous callback
65:47 - classifier require an asynchronous
65:48 - callback but i
65:50 - am just going to try it with classify
65:51 - sync to see if this work those inputs
65:54 - and then i should be able to say
65:55 - background outputs
65:58 - index 0 dot label
66:02 - i know i'm not explaining all the pieces
66:04 - i'll once again refer you to
66:06 - uh the video tutorial series where i go
66:08 - through how this works in great detail
66:10 - i will explain this if it actually works
66:12 - which i don't necessarily think that it
66:14 - will
66:15 - so now i'm just going to give it a few
66:17 - data points
66:18 - on each side i'm going to hit train
66:23 - the model is being trained over 50
66:25 - epochs
66:27 - i think this now should probably just go
66:30 - over here or something
66:33 - and i can hide this
66:38 - oh look at that look at that folks
66:46 - all right that's a little bit insane to
66:48 - me the what it's doing with the dots
66:50 - once i've trained the model but um
66:54 - let's add let's add a little stroke
66:58 - um
67:07 - that is wild
67:10 - so i have now changed my did i
67:14 - right this if statement right
67:18 - this if statement right here which is
67:19 - now commented out
67:21 - is doing exactly the or this neural
67:24 - network
67:24 - is with the inputs of mouse x and mouse
67:27 - y which i believe is completely
67:28 - unnecessary here
67:29 - is now doing the actual work the same
67:32 - work
67:33 - as this particular if statement i have
67:35 - finished
67:36 - this particular project now let me give
67:39 - it some nice
67:40 - kind of training all the way up until
67:43 - the edge there
67:46 - and by the way what i really should
67:47 - demonstrate now is that
67:50 - i think i could also get rid of that
67:53 - line
67:54 - and i could have more um uh other shapes
67:57 - okay
67:58 - ready now i'm gonna hit train
68:03 - we're seeing the loss go down over 50
68:06 - epochs
68:09 - i'm going to hide this debug panel and
68:11 - here i am on the right hand side i have
68:13 - blue
68:14 - the left hand side is red
68:18 - now notice it's not perfect
68:21 - like it appears perfect if i do it
68:23 - really fast
68:25 - and we could do something i could
68:27 - visualize
68:30 - the entire like solution space right i
68:32 - could iterate
68:33 - over every single pixel and get the
68:35 - output color that would
68:36 - certainly be interesting to do um i
68:39 - don't know that i have time to do it
68:41 - right now a guy is saying it's cooler
68:44 - when the dots disappear
68:46 - um oh and i want to swap them out so
68:48 - let's do this again
68:50 - but let's try a new mouse i actually
68:53 - really want to try
68:55 - um this so this is a um
68:59 - giant rollerball mouse called the
69:01 - trackman
69:03 - vista let's give this one a try
69:07 - see if i can get this crazy example to
69:09 - work with this one
69:11 - i also want to get rid of the line and
69:14 - try to make like a circle in the middle
69:16 - so like can i make the equivalent of a
69:18 - button basically or roll over
69:20 - so let's see i'm unplugging this mouse
69:29 - yeah diagonal model i think i'm going to
69:31 - do a circular one
69:32 - i mean this is very similar to my
69:34 - perceptron example
69:36 - all right so first let's put this here
69:40 - is this actually working oh my god this
69:42 - actually works
69:44 - oh this is very weird how do i use this
69:46 - thing did anybody actually use these
69:49 - okay oh my god okay now i'm going to go
69:51 - over here i'm going to click this button
69:54 - wait is this a button i can click
69:58 - yeah on the side with my thumb right
70:01 - here
70:02 - okay
70:06 - you know what i should have done is i
70:09 - should have
70:09 - i should plug you know what i could do i
70:12 - could do this right now
70:15 - i don't know if this is a good idea or
70:16 - not because i haven't been doing this
70:17 - the whole time
70:18 - but i'm gonna um i'm gonna try why not
70:22 - it's caution to the wind um this is
70:26 - there's so many reasons why this is a
70:27 - bad idea i was gonna just plug this
70:29 - camera into this actual laptop
70:32 - and then just bring it up on the desktop
70:34 - and it would actually be recorded
70:36 - and that way i think that would be fun
70:37 - to do let me do that okay
70:39 - so um let's first get rid of the and i'm
70:44 - i'm over time here because i need to
70:45 - take my break but i will get to that in
70:47 - just
70:48 - a few minutes um there that goes away
70:53 - i'm unplugging it where is it plugged
70:57 - into
70:59 - it's plugged into here now
71:03 - i am plugging it into this usb
71:10 - port
71:12 - okay now oh my god i can't do it i gotta
71:16 - use the track pad just for time right
71:18 - now
71:19 - uh new no quick time
71:26 - and new movie recording
71:30 - is that what i want yeah but i want to
71:33 - change to
71:35 - this camera which is now this
71:40 - then i can oh i could actually this is i
71:42 - could have just been recording this the
71:43 - whole time
71:45 - and i mean is this going to kill my
71:47 - machine to also and it's so bright
71:53 - um can i um slower the brightness
71:57 - oh there we go um i'm gonna throw
72:01 - caution to the wind
72:02 - and record this also oh i could have
72:04 - been doing this the whole time
72:07 - and then it's also over here it's behind
72:10 - me
72:12 - now i'm over here will that fade away
72:14 - that um
72:18 - i'm recording button
72:22 - guess yeah there we go
72:25 - there we go okay now
72:28 - it's still kind of bright
72:33 - oh you hear me differently now
72:38 - wait was this whole time i wasn't using
72:40 - this microphone
72:42 - oh my god was i using a low quality mic
72:44 - this whole time and nobody said anything
72:47 - hold on let's check the mic
72:50 - test test test oh
72:55 - i think it is this mic now maybe it
72:57 - wasn't before this is a much higher
72:58 - quality mic
73:00 - that maybe i was not using all right so
73:03 - now
73:04 - here we go this is the grand finale
73:08 - oh wait wait wait i want to take out the
73:09 - line
73:11 - well let's keep the line for a second
73:13 - i'll do it first this okay
73:23 - this is very hard
73:30 - yeah i should bring the exposure down i
73:32 - know
73:40 - okay maybe it was the same mike is fine
73:42 - it switched a while ago
73:44 - interesting
73:48 - all right let's train i should give it
73:50 - more i should have given it more epochs
73:52 - that was my mistake
74:02 - okay ah oh this is very strange what i'm
74:12 - doing
74:14 - okay here we go ready everybody now i'm
74:17 - gonna hit the train button
74:26 - i definitely should have given it more
74:27 - epochs but that's fine now we're gonna
74:29 - hide this console
74:31 - and here we go yay
74:37 - it works
74:41 - wild
74:45 - i don't know about you but i absolutely
74:48 - love what i'm doing
74:50 - so uh three cheers for myself
74:53 - from me to myself pat's on the back
74:56 - um i'm hoping this will make an
74:58 - interesting video after i capture the
74:59 - stuff and do some voiceover
75:01 - um but let's try one more thing
75:07 - i'm going to comment out this line
75:13 - hit save then i'm going to run the
75:17 - sketch again
75:19 - and oh wait a second oh no no no okay
75:22 - okay oh i cheated
75:27 - i mean it's all cheating everything is
75:30 - cheating but i cheated
75:31 - like a whole extra level beyond my
75:34 - original thing that i thought i was
75:35 - cheating
75:37 - which is that um i meant to actually
75:39 - have to manually set the label
75:41 - so uh let's let's add that drop down
75:45 - i'm going to make a a variable called
75:47 - drop down drop down
75:49 - equals create select then i can think i
75:52 - can see drop
75:53 - drop down dot option red
75:57 - drop down dot option
76:00 - blue and now and i run this sketch
76:05 - i should have a drop down here that i um
76:07 - where i can just change
76:09 - from red to blue and then that's really
76:12 - like i shouldn't be able to automate
76:14 - what the label is and so this should be
76:18 - a dropdown dropdown.value
76:21 - so i have to actually set it hello
76:24 - hello um by the way am i i'm very like
76:28 - orange today i feel like it's not just
76:30 - the hat maybe it's the lighting or
76:31 - something in here
76:32 - i do have a way of maybe it's because
76:34 - i'm getting a lot of sunlight in here
76:36 - um okay i'm just checking my messages i
76:40 - have to pick up
76:42 - children from school at one and i'm
76:45 - actually not nowhere near close to
76:46 - where that is right now so i definitely
76:48 - have to be out off off
76:50 - by by a little afternoon um okay so now
76:53 - what i am looking to do for real changes
76:56 - to a hundred
76:57 - because i want to see it train for
76:58 - longer and then
77:02 - um is this all i meant to do
77:07 - um there was something else that was in
77:10 - my head
77:11 - here a second ago but now i've forgotten
77:18 - oh let's try it
77:23 - red red red so like if i do this
77:33 - red and then i change
77:36 - this to blue
77:40 - and try to do a bunch of blue like here
77:43 - in the
77:44 - center
77:48 - and then if i hit train
77:54 - it's having some trouble differentiating
78:00 - do i need more data
78:08 - blue in the center red on the outside
78:11 - uh it's getting confused over here
78:18 - but you can see that i am getting some
78:21 - results now
78:25 - um let's try this again but
78:28 - with if you'll bear with me if you'll
78:32 - humor
78:32 - no you know what i'm going to force
78:34 - myself to use this mouse
78:35 - maybe i should try a different mouse
78:37 - what else do i have in here
78:39 - by the way i have this really awesome
78:41 - [Music]
78:43 - um star trek like communicator mouse
78:49 - but um unfortunately
78:57 - it's the wrong i don't have an adapter
78:59 - it's like an old uh serial port
79:02 - can i take the exposure down even
79:04 - further here
79:07 - you can't really
79:10 - um i can do weird stuff like this though
79:16 - come on back okay
79:21 - all right um try i have a memorex
79:25 - three button mouse
79:29 - i really like this um i've got some of
79:31 - these old
79:32 - microsoft i'm really sad that this one
79:35 - doesn't
79:36 - work let's just try it just to be 100
79:38 - sure
79:39 - because the mickey mouse mouse is really
79:42 - the best of them all
79:46 - oh that's the pro oh so i know what the
79:49 - problem is
79:50 - and i thought about this all of these
79:51 - clicks are causing
79:53 - the training data to be inputted so is
79:56 - that if that's a way to say it um
79:57 - there's
79:58 - i i know what to do i'm gonna say uh let
80:01 - i only want
80:02 - uh clicks that are on the canvas and
80:04 - then i'm gonna say canvas
80:05 - mouse pressed training data
80:09 - and then we'll call this function uh
80:12 - training
80:13 - data i knew there was something that i
80:14 - was doing wrong
80:17 - uh this is a this is a fool's errand
80:19 - that i'm trying because i
80:20 - i i really tried trying to fix this
80:22 - mouse yesterday
80:24 - but let's just see so now this mouse the
80:26 - mickey mouse mouse you can see the
80:28 - button works
80:31 - the button works but the cursor does not
80:33 - move
80:34 - and i've tried
80:41 - like i'm opening it up we can see the
80:44 - actual like
80:44 - roller mechanism that
80:48 - like even manipulating the roller
80:50 - mechanism
80:51 - myself um i am not able to
80:56 - get the thing to move i could build an
80:59 - object detection machine learning model
81:01 - to track the mouse
81:02 - and then control the cursor with that
81:04 - that's a whole other project
81:06 - i'm sad that i don't have time to do
81:08 - that maybe next weekend
81:10 - next live stream um okay
81:13 - so this one has to go away unfortunately
81:16 - what i
81:16 - i i i really like i really have failed
81:20 - in um my live poll
81:24 - software because if i had really ever
81:25 - finished that project i could just have
81:27 - a poll right now
81:29 - for people to vote on a mouse i do
81:32 - really like this one
81:33 - because it says packard bell on it i
81:35 - don't think packard bell exists anymore
81:38 - so let's try this packard bell one
81:45 - okay
81:49 - there we go now we're trying the packard
81:52 - bell one how do i wish i could
81:53 - is it like
81:59 - i'm just gonna have to live with i could
82:01 - actually what i could do
82:03 - um is i could lower the amount of light
82:05 - in this room
82:07 - so let me do this um
82:10 - because i have these um elgato key
82:13 - lights that i really love
82:15 - and if i turn them down like let me just
82:16 - turn them off for a second
82:18 - like i'm in the dark
82:22 - but at least now this doesn't look so
82:24 - crazy let's give myself a little bit
82:25 - more light
82:28 - wow oh that's the temperature
82:32 - i was playing with the color temperature
82:33 - not the brightness so
82:35 - um let me keep turning this down
82:43 - uh and then
82:47 - uh well if i just turn these off is that
82:49 - even better
82:52 - all right i'm turning the lights off
82:53 - just for a second it's fine
82:55 - this camera doesn't need the lights okay
82:57 - ready here we go
82:58 - oh boy this one's hard to use
83:06 - i move so slowly
83:11 - which is actually fine i could adjust
83:13 - the settings of the speed
83:24 - okay now
83:28 - let me go to a blue
83:45 - okay now let's try drum roll please
83:48 - training
83:54 - come on come on loss oh keep going keep
83:58 - going oh i need more than 100 epochs
84:00 - it'll keep going but
84:04 - that's probably gonna do it so now
84:09 - blue red blue red
84:12 - look at that beautiful i made like a
84:15 - rollover button a roll over with machine
84:18 - learning
84:19 - and an old timey mouse
84:23 - i love it i love it
84:26 - it's ridiculous and i love it
84:32 - oh yeah so um right uh people but
84:36 - people are making a lot of good
84:37 - interface improvement suggestions which
84:40 - absolutely do make sense
84:41 - okay um let's do a couple things here
84:45 - let me um come over here
84:49 - and hit stop
84:55 - so this is save that was only 12 minutes
84:58 - mouse movements
85:02 - save that to the desktop one
85:07 - okay so i have this archival footage
85:10 - which can get
85:11 - placed into the video that i'm making
85:15 - then i also want to
85:18 - let's go back to obs and tell it to stop
85:24 - recording
85:27 - where by the way i'm just gonna um just
85:30 - because i've got my
85:32 - um obs
85:35 - configuration i want to look at uh
85:38 - okay yeah that's fine let's see how that
85:42 - um turned out
85:47 - because it should be here this is
85:54 - video capture of my entire session just
85:58 - now awesome i think i got that
86:00 - so this is good raw material footage
86:03 - that i'll be able to add in the
86:05 - background or something
86:06 - of this video that i'm making okay
86:10 - i still have more to do today this is
86:12 - not the end of the stream although we're
86:14 - closing in on the end
86:17 - um first let me close some of this stuff
86:21 - out
86:21 - let me click click here so this by the
86:24 - way
86:25 - uh it's pretty interesting to see these
86:28 - are
86:28 - all of the mouse movements that i have
86:31 - done
86:31 - today during this live stream
86:34 - and you can see now uh over here
86:38 - like kind of this is the cluster of all
86:40 - that stuff that i was doing
86:42 - and this is probably maybe the menu of
86:44 - the p5 web editor
86:45 - it's kind of interesting to see this
86:47 - constellation of mouse movements let me
86:50 - at a minimum
86:51 - just take a screenshot of this but also
86:53 - if i click
86:56 - i believe i have it set up to
86:59 - if this code was written correctly which
87:01 - i'm going to
87:02 - build a little example like this in a
87:04 - moment um i should be able to look at
87:06 - the data folder
87:07 - and see that these are csvs
87:11 - of all of the mouse clicks of the mouse
87:13 - locations
87:14 - and timestamps so actually speaking of
87:18 - which
87:20 - um i could really use some help from the
87:23 - community let me turn my lights on
87:25 - let me i really need to do my sponsor
87:29 - segment
87:31 - uh so i don't get fired here um
87:34 - but um let me just briefly mention um
87:38 - something that is a sort of a call that
87:39 - i would love help with
87:41 - i would like to train a sketch rnn style
87:44 - model
87:45 - out of all these mouse movements because
87:47 - part of what i'm doing is then to have
87:48 - an example
87:49 - of an ai that is just operating the
87:52 - mouse for me someone's at front door
87:54 - yeah i'm sorry i can't come to the door
87:56 - right now
87:57 - hope it's not any of you um
88:01 - uh so um
88:05 - what um so yeah so if i don't actually
88:08 - know how to do this i was looking at
88:09 - this thing called like deep svg
88:12 - i'm sort of out of my i'm kind of
88:14 - running out of time here to be able to
88:16 - add this example to the things that i'm
88:18 - building for the mouse conference
88:19 - so um if anybody else happens to
88:23 - have a lead or want to help uh figure
88:25 - out a way to
88:26 - train a sequential model off of the
88:28 - mouse locations
88:29 - sketch rnn deep svg are examples of
88:32 - it doesn't have to be done well or
88:34 - accurately just to be something that's
88:36 - kind of like
88:36 - fun that i can kind of get to work you
88:38 - know huge
88:39 - benefit if i could do it with
88:41 - tensorflow.js
88:43 - but um i'll take any help that i can get
88:45 - um hit me up on twitter at shifement but
88:47 - before i go to the second half of this
88:50 - live stream where i'm going to look at
88:51 - this java robot class
88:52 - that's in this example i want to take a
88:55 - minute
88:56 - uh or so and i've lost my mouse here to
88:59 - thank today's sponsor
89:01 - um brilliant so let me pull up the
89:04 - brilliant website
89:08 - um and let me pull up my notes over here
89:13 - that i have uh
89:16 - that i seem to have
89:22 - lost
89:24 - that's okay
89:28 - please hold
89:31 - highly professional operation i've got
89:34 - going on here
89:38 - it's funny i wrote up all these notes
89:40 - and then i by accident closed
89:43 - the window and i don't really need the
89:44 - notes because
89:46 - um you know i it's very easy for me to
89:49 - talk about brilliant because i use it
89:51 - regularly myself
89:53 - and what i find to be
89:56 - the most wonderful part about brilliant
89:58 - and i think i can take the banner away
90:00 - now that i have
90:01 - the website up is the way that it is
90:04 - provides an
90:05 - alternate modality for learning that's
90:08 - different from what i do in video
90:09 - tutorial so hopefully
90:11 - you the viewer of the coding train like
90:14 - to watch my videos
90:15 - you learn something you have a little
90:16 - fun maybe you make a creative project
90:19 - for me in addition i do watch a lot of
90:21 - tutorials video tutorials and i
90:22 - especially like
90:23 - other people's live coding live streams
90:25 - but a really fundamental i think in
90:28 - critical way to learn is through
90:30 - practice
90:30 - you know it's not memorizing it's not
90:32 - watching lectures although those can be
90:34 - great too
90:34 - being someone who delivers lectures but
90:37 - um doing it yourself
90:38 - and so brilliant is a website that
90:40 - really allows you to do it yourself and
90:42 - i think the thing for me to really
90:43 - highlight
90:44 - are these courses and you can see our
90:46 - beautiful geometry statistics scientific
90:48 - infinity oh the infinity one is so
90:50 - so so good uh computer science
90:52 - fundamental introduction neural networks
90:53 - mathematical fundamentals
90:55 - pre-algebra scientific thinking um you
90:57 - know i've been doing my kids are in
90:59 - um fourth and sixth grade and i i'm like
91:03 - they're like please stop bothering me
91:04 - like we could do our math homework on
91:06 - our own
91:06 - but i'm like can i please do my math
91:08 - homework with you and so
91:10 - when they don't let me i could just go
91:11 - to brilliant and kind of do my own math
91:12 - homework
91:13 - so um it's a it's a wonderful website
91:15 - full of courses
91:16 - you can just sign up for free i'll put
91:18 - the banner um
91:19 - right here you know if you sign up um
91:22 - just for free it actually like helps me
91:23 - out a little bit lets them know that you
91:24 - found
91:25 - brilliant through the coding train if
91:27 - it's something that really appeals to
91:28 - you and you want to get the full
91:30 - premium subscription to unlock all of
91:32 - the features
91:33 - um by going through that link you will
91:34 - also get a 20 off coupon
91:36 - i'll also mention that it's actually a
91:38 - really great thing
91:40 - to give as a gift so sometimes you know
91:42 - if you don't know what to buy somebody
91:44 - and you don't want to like you know just
91:46 - keep collecting more material goods
91:48 - um giving somebody a subscription for
91:50 - learning um is a wonderful um idea for a
91:53 - gift so
91:53 - i would definitely also suggest that as
91:55 - well let's what i like to do i
91:57 - just be you know i usually like to poke
91:58 - through some of the courses but um
92:01 - i really want to quickly just look at
92:02 - this ride the wave um challenge that i
92:05 - did look at earlier
92:06 - um ben i immediately noticed it because
92:09 - it is
92:10 - a really really related to
92:13 - if i go to nature of code on my website
92:16 - and if i get to chapter three
92:18 - you can see these videos like graphing
92:20 - the sine wave
92:21 - um additive waves um so if you want to
92:24 - think about waveforms
92:27 - and go deeper into them a lot of the
92:30 - stuff that i that i'm doing with physics
92:31 - simulation there's tons more content on
92:33 - and
92:33 - brilliant and i've already lost so let's
92:36 - look at this one and see if we can
92:37 - solve this together and i've lost my
92:40 - view of the chat so let me just
92:43 - grab my view of the chat um
92:46 - so that i can see if anybody's telling
92:48 - me anything super important
92:51 - um okay so
92:56 - look at these two graphs if they both
92:58 - remind you of polynomials you're right
93:01 - can we say something more about the
93:03 - relationship between these two graphs
93:05 - now i already know what the relationship
93:07 - is
93:07 - because i looked at this earlier i
93:08 - haven't looked at what the challenge
93:10 - question is yet
93:11 - but i did look at um just this sort of
93:13 - like written description so i'm gonna
93:15 - just
93:15 - i'm gonna i'm gonna play some uh
93:17 - awaiting music
93:21 - and think about this i'll look in the
93:22 - chat see if anybody wants to offer a
93:25 - suggestion
93:35 - interestingly oh yeah no this is what i
93:38 - expect yeah
93:40 - i was trying to look for i was trying to
93:42 - look for for me what's important to note
93:44 - is look at these peaks and valleys right
93:47 - up here this peak is around like
93:49 - negative
93:50 - three and what's happening at negative
93:52 - three oh it's right around zero
93:55 - this peak is around one
93:58 - and what's happening there at one oh
94:00 - look it's at zero
94:02 - see what about this valley here negative
94:04 - one
94:05 - negative one oh look at that it's right
94:07 - around zero
94:09 - so ever heard the term the slope
94:14 - the slope refers to what the kind of
94:16 - like
94:18 - what uh you can think of like the
94:19 - tangent like if i were to draw a line
94:21 - that's tangent
94:22 - like the slope i've like lost my ability
94:26 - to use words
94:27 - um but uh let's let's read because it'll
94:30 - it'll explain this
94:31 - you know here we go we've got the answer
94:32 - the derivative the reason i was coming
94:34 - with slope is like
94:35 - i think it's the music it must be the
94:37 - music as
94:39 - the top of this curve levels off the
94:42 - tangent to that is a flat line
94:44 - the slope the change the rate of change
94:46 - in that curve
94:47 - is suddenly zero um at those peaks and
94:50 - values
94:51 - the derivative being the rate of change
94:53 - i talked about this a lot in my videos
94:54 - about
94:55 - position and velocity velocity being the
94:57 - change in position
94:58 - so this graph i if i've read this
95:01 - correctly is
95:02 - the derivative it is graphing the slope
95:05 - of the tangent to this curve
95:06 - and so that's why you'll see that these
95:08 - peaks and values
95:10 - uh peaks and val that peaks and valleys
95:12 - is where
95:13 - um the derivative is zero and i'm i'm
95:16 - sure i've gotten this not exactly right
95:17 - oh
95:17 - look at this and this is the other thing
95:19 - i love about brilliant is
95:21 - um it gives you i i was like trying to
95:23 - like use my
95:24 - mouse cursor but here is a really
95:26 - wonderful interactive environment now
95:27 - here's what i love about brilliant also
95:30 - i want to make this as a p5 sketch now
95:33 - so so badly
95:34 - but i can't because i don't have time to
95:36 - do that right now but i should come into
95:38 - a whole
95:39 - um session with like that but um uh
95:42 - so anyway you can read a lot more you
95:44 - can sort of see uh more explanation but
95:46 - let's
95:46 - um let's go down to the challenge so
95:49 - this is today this is a graph
95:52 - one of the three graphs below represents
95:54 - the derivative of the function graphed
95:56 - above
95:57 - okay which one
96:02 - they all kind of look the same to me
96:04 - this is going to be hard
96:05 - well if i go with my peaks and valleys
96:08 - right
96:08 - valley at zero peak at one value two
96:11 - peak at three
96:12 - so the derivative should cross zero at
96:16 - zero one two three oh so it's this one
96:18 - or uh
96:19 - zero one no so a or b what about c
96:23 - ah so it's definitely not c i've
96:24 - eliminated c
96:26 - so it's a or b um
96:29 - the other thing i think i could do is
96:32 - here it's increasing so the derivative
96:36 - should be
96:37 - positive and here the it's decreasing so
96:40 - the derivative should be
96:41 - negative is that right
96:45 - so it's not this one because this is
96:47 - going down
96:48 - and then after one it's going up it
96:51 - should be going
96:52 - up oh well it's the value is increasing
96:55 - but like the rate of change actually
96:58 - is going up up up up up then it's going
97:00 - down down down to zero
97:02 - then it's going up up up then it's
97:03 - slowing down right so i i it's not just
97:06 - like what is the literal value changing
97:08 - it's how is that
97:10 - how is it changing so i think oh no no
97:13 - that's right it's b
97:14 - because it's the rate of change is going
97:16 - up up is increasing it's all it's
97:17 - positive that whole time
97:19 - it's hard to see because this looks like
97:20 - a straight line to me but it's like
97:22 - increasing more rapidly and it's
97:24 - increasing more slowly then it levels
97:26 - off
97:26 - it's decreasing more rapidly so that
97:28 - matches up with b
97:30 - i think i see i see a b in the chat
97:34 - from damien right and simon most
97:37 - like very accurately states what does
97:39 - this have to do with the wave series
97:41 - though
97:41 - it has more to do with calculus and trig
97:43 - and ultimately that's
97:45 - absolutely correct so the only thing
97:46 - that has to do with the wave series is
97:48 - visually they match
97:50 - and i i think i saw that and that's what
97:51 - grabbed me um
97:53 - but you're absolutely right um
97:56 - i do think it does it is interesting to
97:58 - think about how you might
97:59 - uh think about waves as sort of more
98:02 - polynomial forms
98:03 - or how you might be able to like bring
98:06 - these two
98:07 - concepts closer together but that is
98:08 - correct that the it's
98:10 - this is really more of a calculus
98:11 - problem all right let's do b
98:15 - i don't even know if this is operational
98:17 - i'm gonna get my one day streak now
98:20 - decreasing rapidly slowly has to do with
98:22 - the second derivative like
98:24 - acceleration to velocity velocity
98:26 - position thank you
98:27 - yeah uh and
98:31 - here we go oh i got it correct
98:34 - okay great i got my one day streak
98:36 - because i haven't done it i didn't do a
98:38 - challenge yesterday
98:39 - so um this
98:42 - is there's and this is why i love
98:44 - there's all sorts of wonderful
98:46 - community-based explanations so
98:47 - um you know for me uh and what i would
98:50 - really suggest you do
98:51 - is if you participate in these
98:52 - challenges try to solve them with p5 and
98:54 - code
98:55 - and then go back to them and and by the
98:56 - way if you want to also learn i meant to
98:58 - show you these but like
98:59 - this for example uh brilliant has a
99:01 - whole course on learning python
99:02 - so you can see it's interactive and you
99:04 - can type code in it um as well as this
99:06 - neural network
99:07 - example as well so um thank you to um
99:11 - brilliant
99:12 - for being the uh sponsor of today's live
99:15 - stream
99:16 - uh i'm gonna take a short three or four
99:18 - minute break i have
99:19 - like half an hour left to look at the
99:21 - java robot class when i come back
99:24 - um so stick around if you can if you
99:26 - have a few minutes to sign up through
99:27 - this link it brilliant um
99:28 - you can do so for free and if it uh and
99:31 - if you're interested in the obviously
99:32 - the premium subscription
99:33 - you can get a discount there okay so see
99:35 - you all
99:36 - in approximately uh hopefully a little
99:39 - bit less than five minutes
99:45 - i'll be right back
102:09 - sorry i hit the mute button on the music
102:13 - so the whole time i can hear it in my
102:15 - monitor but none of you could hear it
102:29 - [Music]
102:40 - do
102:44 - [Music]
102:54 - do
102:55 - [Music]
103:11 - [Music]
103:27 - okay i am coming back here
103:31 - for uh what is uh simon most accurately
103:34 - states is not
103:35 - the second half of the stream i think i
103:37 - can say part two part two will be much
103:39 - shorter
103:40 - than uh part one uh thanks again to
103:43 - brilliant
103:44 - um all right so now before i start
103:47 - coding this part
103:49 - what i need to do is a couple things
103:52 - i need to get my recording going again
103:54 - so i'm going to start recording my
103:56 - desktop
103:57 - so that's recording then i need to get
104:00 - my
104:01 - mouse cam going also
104:06 - uh which i should be able to do this way
104:09 - and just move it over here like this
104:12 - and shrink it up and hit
104:15 - um
104:19 - hit record this is the way i should have
104:22 - been doing this all along by the way
104:24 - okay so mouse cam is recording but we
104:26 - also need to pick a mouse
104:28 - because this one was this one's
104:31 - not really very usable
104:35 - okay so what do i have left i i did i do
104:38 - have this lovely crayola mouse
104:40 - that i don't think i used yet so let's
104:42 - use the crayola mouse
104:47 - um there we go plugging it
104:50 - in
104:54 - okay now hopefully everybody can hear me
104:57 - and see me
104:58 - this mouse works pretty well so that's
105:00 - good um the
105:01 - other thing i want to make sure that i
105:03 - do
105:05 - is open up the data collect
105:08 - because i do want to be running data
105:10 - collection in the background
105:12 - that might cause a problem because i'm
105:14 - going to i don't know if the
105:16 - java robot class can be used in multiple
105:18 - sketches
105:19 - but i'm gonna assume that this is okay
105:21 - for the moment
105:22 - all right so what is it that i want to
105:24 - do demonstrate to you
105:26 - um uh robot
105:31 - demo java it's weird that it's called
105:34 - um and i'm gonna save this just on the
105:37 - desktop
105:38 - um it's weird that it's called the robot
105:41 - class so i do need a browser i close the
105:43 - browser i need the browser open
105:45 - uh java robot so what is this
105:48 - java robot and i don't know what version
105:50 - of java i'm using in processing but
105:52 - let's
105:52 - let's go to this one
105:56 - so the the java robot class so okay
106:01 - hold on everybody i got a lot of
106:03 - explaining to do
106:04 - about what's going on here
106:07 - um processing
106:11 - is a programming environment that i use
106:14 - quite often
106:15 - um it is what i used almost exclusively
106:18 - before i started doing a lot of my work
106:20 - and teaching
106:21 - in javascript in the browser with p5.js
106:24 - processing is built with the programming
106:26 - language java
106:28 - and even though it is a sort of closed
106:30 - environment with a
106:31 - full drawing api and a lot of other sort
106:34 - of like
106:35 - core functionality and a lot of extended
106:37 - libraries
106:38 - you actually from within processing have
106:40 - access to
106:41 - anything java can do and java as a
106:45 - language i i don't know the right way to
106:47 - state this but it's kind of like the way
106:48 - that i think about it
106:49 - and i'll be curious to hear what you
106:50 - think is it's not the best language at
106:54 - anything
106:54 - but it's one of the best languages for
106:57 - everything like
106:58 - it's very hard to come up with something
106:59 - you can't do in java so it doesn't excel
107:02 - at any given thing
107:03 - but it just you can kind of do anything
107:06 - and it's cross-platform
107:07 - there's this whole job of virtual
107:08 - machine stuff there's a lot of
107:09 - complexity in terms of um
107:11 - and it is a little bit out of date and
107:13 - browsers don't support java applet
107:14 - anymore
107:15 - all of that aside i love i
107:18 - love the job jivin it loves me
107:22 - so um it's my first programming love
107:26 - everyone should feel
107:27 - about something like the way that i feel
107:29 - about java or maybe not i don't know if
107:30 - that's just weird
107:32 - i gotta hit stop here because it's
107:34 - bothering me that there's this error
107:35 - here is it still
107:37 - i don't know i don't know if i'm going
107:38 - to run this data collection while i'm
107:39 - doing this but all right
107:41 - so the reason why i'm getting excited
107:43 - here is
107:44 - if i go back to here i can look at this
107:46 - java robot
107:48 - class which is part of java.awt
107:51 - so i can actually say like if i just say
107:53 - robot
107:54 - robot processing is going to say like i
107:57 - don't know what that is
107:59 - the class robot does not exist
108:02 - but if i now say import java.awt.robot
108:08 - that error goes away now
108:11 - i can say setup and so the two the
108:15 - things that you could do with the robot
108:16 - class
108:17 - is to one you can track mouse well you
108:21 - can do a lot with it but what i'm
108:22 - interested in it for
108:23 - is it's it's a it's a tool for
108:25 - automation of different aspects of the
108:27 - sort of
108:28 - on the operating system level of what
108:30 - the use the user
108:31 - is doing so in relationship to the mouse
108:34 - i can know at any point
108:36 - where the mouse is now you might think
108:37 - that i can do that anyway in processing
108:39 - mouse x mouse y
108:40 - well no that's limiting the mouse
108:42 - interaction
108:43 - with this particular window same thing
108:46 - with p5 like i can know what the mouse
108:47 - is doing
108:48 - within a particular canvas or browser
108:51 - window but on from the operating system
108:53 - as a whole
108:54 - i need something else another layer and
108:56 - that's what the java robot class does in
108:58 - addition
108:59 - i can move the mouse around
109:02 - i can automate things if you've ever
109:03 - used like you know an uh
109:05 - an automator right i can actually have
109:07 - the mouse move according to logic and
109:09 - code
109:09 - so ideally what i want to do is
109:12 - track all of my mouse movements train a
109:15 - machine learning model i guess i could
109:16 - just use like a markov chain or
109:18 - something
109:18 - if i can't figure out how to do it with
109:20 - a neural network easily
109:23 - but um i can then
109:26 - have a machine learning model running to
109:29 - uh
109:30 - tell me where to move the map to not
109:33 - tell me to automate
109:34 - the control of the computer and that's
109:35 - what i would ultimately like to
109:36 - demonstrate
109:37 - and i do kind of want this to go away
109:40 - there we go
109:42 - um all right so let's let's look at the
109:43 - first steps and i i have working code
109:46 - that does this
109:47 - over here and i don't remember how to do
109:49 - it
109:50 - but um let's try to see if i can do it
109:53 - from the reference
109:54 - so first thing i need to do is make a
109:57 - robot object
109:58 - so i need to say robot equals new robot
110:02 - i'll do that in setup and let's run this
110:06 - code
110:07 - so here's a thing that will happen to
110:08 - you once you break out of processing and
110:10 - start using regular java
110:12 - it's like um sorry you there's there's a
110:15 - possible thing that could go wrong
110:16 - and you haven't told me what to do if
110:18 - that thing goes wrong
110:20 - i'm gonna need some more help here so
110:22 - and i really have to watch the time okay
110:24 - so processing usually will handle all
110:27 - sorts of errors for you
110:28 - behind the scenes and the way the
110:29 - library is written but often you have to
110:31 - be explicit so
110:32 - uh i'm gonna do a very sort of
110:34 - perfunctory job here
110:36 - and i can use a try catch statement and
110:38 - i can just catch
110:39 - any general exception uh
110:43 - in uh exception i'll call that e and i'm
110:45 - just gonna say print
110:48 - print line e and maybe i'll actually do
110:50 - a system.print.error
110:53 - so it'll show up in red is that not how
110:55 - you do it print line error i have no
110:56 - idea
110:57 - system.error printline i have no idea
111:00 - all right nevermind i don't know how to
111:01 - do that
111:02 - so i'm just going to say print line okay
111:05 - so
111:06 - not the best uh most comprehensive
111:08 - solution
111:09 - but um now i can run this sketch
111:12 - and i don't get an error the robot has
111:15 - been made
111:17 - so now the next thing i would like to do
111:20 - is let's look at what some of the
111:22 - functions are
111:24 - this moves the mouse mouse press this
111:27 - presses one or more of the buttons
111:32 - yeah and now mouse release i don't want
111:35 - this i want to know mouse wheel key
111:36 - press key release
111:38 - get pixel color get screen capture so
111:40 - you can do screen capture stuff with
111:41 - this
111:42 - so much you could do uh set auto delay
111:45 - delay wait for idle to string what am i
111:47 - missing here
111:48 - there's a thing that i'm doing to get
111:50 - the mouse points
111:52 - and i don't see it here um
111:58 - let's look at the methods wait for i i
112:01 - should have just been looking up here
112:05 - hmm instant no concrete let's look at my
112:08 - code
112:10 - since especially i'm out of time uh get
112:13 - number of buttons
112:15 - start robot
112:24 - [Music]
112:28 - robot
112:30 - track mouse oh yeah mouse oh it's um
112:34 - so this is actually just oh i don't even
112:36 - really need the robot for what i'm doing
112:39 - the robot is more to automate move stuff
112:40 - around maybe i need to i need mouse info
112:43 - because
112:44 - mouse info is a static class that can
112:47 - give me the pointer info okay
112:48 - interesting
112:49 - so actually what i'm looking for and i
112:52 - did java.awg.start so let's look at
112:55 - mouse info let's look at this so this is
112:58 - just for the data tracking
113:02 - java
113:06 - so i want to import this also
113:15 - and in let's just say
113:18 - let me just add a um an empty draw and
113:21 - let me add a mouse pressed
113:26 - so then i want to get in mouse info
113:29 - get pointer info and it's static
113:33 - so i want to say get pointer info and
113:35 - what does that give me back it gives me
113:36 - pointer info
113:38 - pointer info equals by the way welcome
113:41 - to the most
113:42 - long-winded esoteric programming
113:44 - language
113:45 - you could ever possibly use pointer info
113:48 - equals
113:52 - mouseinfo.getpointerinfo
113:54 - should be spelled with a zero i'm i'm
113:56 - imagining i guess i need
113:58 - uh import i mean i could just do dot
114:02 - star
114:03 - but i'm kind of curious to like figure
114:04 - out exactly what i'm using
114:06 - and then if i have a pointer info thingy
114:11 - i can look in this documentation and say
114:13 - get location
114:15 - which is a point
114:22 - and a point i'm assuming is also part of
114:26 - awt
114:28 - oh wait that's
114:32 - awt point
114:36 - how long till i just say awt star
114:39 - before i give up and say that so now uh
114:43 - print line point is i'm assuming there's
114:45 - just like an x in there
114:47 - and a y let's see
114:53 - yeah there we go now it's not
114:55 - registering it
114:57 - for other places but
115:00 - um i don't actually need to just get
115:01 - this i can but i can do this during draw
115:12 - now i should be able to say
115:18 - right as i move the mouse around
115:20 - anywhere on my desktop
115:21 - see how i'm getting the uh values there
115:24 - okay well that's
115:25 - that right so now this is what i'm going
115:28 - to do
115:29 - i am going to i'm going to show you kind
115:31 - of how i made this
115:33 - i am going to say a size
115:37 - so i'm going to do it i'm going to scale
115:39 - it down the same way i'm doing there
115:41 - so i'm going to make a variable called
115:42 - scale which i'm going to say let's do
115:44 - this all at a quarter scale
115:46 - and i also because i'm going to do some
115:47 - funny business with automating
115:50 - um the creation of the processing
115:53 - window itself system dot
115:56 - er dot print line system dot thank you
116:00 - system.org
116:02 - i didn't see that in the chat till just
116:03 - now
116:07 - so what i'm going to do here is i'm
116:09 - going to say if if you ever put
116:11 - variables into the size function and
116:13 - processing you need to move that into a
116:15 - function called settings
116:16 - otherwise you could just say size and
116:18 - setup so i'm going to say display width
116:20 - times scale display height times scale
116:27 - i guess i need to floor those because
116:29 - they have to be integers
116:34 - um okay so that should now if i run this
116:38 - right you can see it's the same i think
116:40 - i used using the same scale there
116:43 - then all i need to do
116:46 - is um let's put um
116:49 - background zero and then
116:52 - um i'm just going to say
117:00 - i'm going to do point previous i'm going
117:02 - to draw it as a line because that's what
117:03 - i'm doing up here
117:06 - previous equals point
117:09 - um and i will say if previous is not
117:12 - equal to
117:13 - null draw a line from point
117:16 - x point y to previous x previous y
117:21 - um and i need to multiply these by scale
117:24 - to scale it down
117:28 - and then stroke make it white
117:31 - so let's see i don't know if this is
117:33 - kind of work going to work but yeah
117:38 - so now as i move the mouse all around
117:40 - the larger window
117:42 - it's drawing the path scaled down and it
117:45 - doesn't matter like
117:46 - the processing window goes away it's
117:48 - doing this behind the scenes no matter
117:50 - what like here i'll put it away like i'm
117:52 - doing this
117:53 - doing this across the bottom
117:57 - scrolls girl scroll there you can see so
118:00 - that's a
118:01 - and the only thing that's different here
118:03 - is that i'm using some alpha so that it
118:05 - kind of builds up more over time
118:08 - just to be clear about this i could
118:09 - change this to you know 0.5
118:12 - and now like you know i just scaled it
118:14 - down so this
118:16 - but the the thing that i really want to
118:17 - do is i want to save that data so
118:20 - i'm kind of running out of time so i
118:22 - think i would like to sort of
118:23 - like wrap up a bit um but i will just
118:27 - show you
118:27 - here um that in this particular example
118:31 - i've added a bunch of things but
118:34 - essentially i'm keep i made my own
118:37 - mousepoint class because i wanted to
118:39 - pair
118:40 - the time with the xy i'm not i don't
118:42 - know if i'm going to use the time
118:44 - but i thought uh i have it this is the
118:46 - only time i'll ever have the time i
118:47 - better save it
118:49 - and i'm not doing anything with clicks
118:50 - so um
118:52 - i want to i just create a mouse point
118:54 - which is in the x and y location along
118:56 - with the time
118:57 - and you can see this is ultimately the
118:59 - same thing like i have this p mouse and
119:02 - mouse
119:03 - objects and as long as um there
119:06 - i also like i skip it if it's like
119:08 - hasn't moved for a while
119:10 - maybe um and so just drawing that same
119:13 - thing with alpha the difference is
119:15 - um every 100 000 data points
119:18 - um i'm i basically i have this like
119:21 - arraylist history of all the mouse
119:23 - points
119:24 - and every time i track the mouse get
119:26 - that pointer info of the x and y
119:29 - and i didn't realize by the way i could
119:30 - just say point dot x
119:32 - point dot y and say get x and get y i
119:35 - make the new mouse point object with
119:36 - that x and y
119:37 - and the specific time stamp and then add
119:40 - it to
119:42 - that array that way in uh
119:45 - save data i just create
119:49 - a um i use the save strings function
119:52 - to essentially save x comma y comma time
119:56 - and if i go into um i save it as data
120:00 - mouse and then i also time stamp it as a
120:01 - csv file
120:03 - and you can see right now um the most
120:06 - recent one that i saved
120:08 - was at today
120:11 - at 11 45 a.m so it was 10 minutes ago
120:14 - if i actually click i think i force it
120:17 - to save if i click on it
120:18 - so now i just saved a new one at 11 58
120:22 - and if i look at this in um
120:25 - where's my vs code
120:29 - um let me just
120:32 - open up visual studio code manually
120:35 - and i'm opening up a million digits of
120:38 - pi apparently
120:39 - if i open up i don't know where i saved
120:43 - this
120:44 - sketch robot demo no no no oh yeah it's
120:47 - in
120:48 - computer mouse mouse data collect
120:51 - this is this particular file from 11 58
120:54 - am
120:55 - you can see it's just xy timestamp xy
120:58 - timestamp
120:58 - so i'm amassing all this data so i can
121:01 - make
121:02 - visualizations of it i've been working
121:04 - on a heat map
121:05 - visualization if anybody wants to help
121:07 - make some visualizations
121:08 - i'm happy to publish this data i could
121:10 - just stick it in a github repo
121:12 - again tweet me at shiffman is probably
121:13 - the best way or join the coding train
121:15 - discord
121:16 - um and ask one of the mods there um i
121:19 - can i can
121:20 - i just posted a link to the coding train
121:21 - discord in the chat hopefully i don't
121:23 - know if it
121:23 - if it popped up but maybe somebody's
121:25 - just the codingtrade.com discord
121:27 - um so i would love some sort of help i'm
121:30 - i'm like recording the video
121:32 - about all this stuff this weekend so you
121:35 - know if you want to make an interesting
121:36 - visualization i could maybe include it
121:38 - uh you know i don't want to i'm not i
121:39 - don't want to be taking advantage of
121:40 - them it's like generosity here
121:42 - so um but if it interests you i would
121:44 - welcome um
121:46 - any contributions um so what else do
121:49 - what i wanted to say about this
121:52 - um yeah let me before i go because it's
121:55 - noon and i need to wrap up
121:58 - i do really i haven't tested out what
122:01 - happened
122:01 - like some major issues i think i can't
122:03 - remember who it was somebody in the chat
122:04 - said
122:05 - watch out if you start writing software
122:07 - to take over your mouse how do you gain
122:09 - control back
122:11 - and actually now that i'm thinking about
122:12 - it oh well it's it's okay i've
122:14 - i've i'm gonna do all the things that
122:16 - i'm gonna do um
122:19 - i'm gonna work on my script um let's see
122:22 - let's go back to
122:26 - let's open here okay i can close this
122:28 - one
122:30 - let's go back to the robot class
122:34 - and i'm looking for mouse move
122:38 - move the mouse pointer to given screen
122:40 - coordinates
122:41 - okay let's see
122:46 - if i say uh
122:49 - x equals 100
122:55 - y equals 100 then i'm going to in draw
122:59 - i'm going to um
123:02 - get rid of this tracking stuff for a
123:04 - second
123:05 - i'm going to say x plus equal
123:09 - random negative 100 100 y plus
123:13 - equal random negative 100 100 no no
123:15 - that's way too crazy 10
123:18 - 10 10
123:21 - 10 and then robot mouse move
123:24 - x y what could go wrong uh
123:28 - expect okay i need uh to
123:32 - convert these to integers
123:36 - this is a random a random mouse walk
123:44 - would like to control this computer
123:46 - using accessibility ah so i have to
123:48 - grant it control
123:50 - that's interesting
123:54 - uh let me just go over here just because
123:57 - i don't know what i'm revealing here
123:59 - allow the apps i'm gonna allow
124:03 - process what i'm just doing is i'm in
124:04 - the security and privacy
124:06 - um window and i'm
124:10 - clicking to allow processing control
124:13 - and we'll see if that does the trick
124:16 - i've already oh my god i have lost my
124:18 - mouse
124:20 - oh yeah it's doing it
124:24 - so i gave it control and you can see the
124:26 - mouse is up there in the corner stuck
124:28 - moving around can i hit escape okay good
124:31 - i can hit escape
124:33 - so let's go with um
124:36 - in setup
124:43 - i mean i would really like i should use
124:45 - one of my like steering behaviors
124:47 - examples or flocking behavior but let's
124:50 - do display
124:51 - with divided by two
124:56 - and display height divided by two let's
124:59 - make it uh
125:00 - move very very little and hopefully
125:02 - right now when i hit
125:03 - run it shouldn't just be in the center
125:06 - yeah there we go
125:10 - there's my mouse automate mood of moving
125:14 - [Laughter]
125:16 - this is like the least interesting um
125:18 - automate moving the mouse example that i
125:20 - could do
125:21 - let's um ah okay let's let's
125:24 - just because i want to have something
125:26 - slightly more interesting
125:28 - i could use perlin noise that actually
125:31 - would be a great one
125:32 - let's just do that let's just try purlin
125:35 - noise real quick
125:37 - um and then so this um x offset
125:40 - is zero y offset
125:45 - is zero and
125:48 - it's actually not really right so i'm
125:49 - not going to be using two-dimensional
125:51 - noise
125:53 - it's fine just bear with me
125:57 - uh and now
126:01 - in draw float
126:05 - um x equals noise x
126:09 - x off times display with
126:14 - y equals noise y off
126:17 - display height
126:20 - and then i mean the
126:24 - x off just if you have no idea what i'm
126:27 - doing i would suggest my
126:29 - videos on pearl and noise
126:32 - let's see what happens now
126:37 - okay that's oh right right right right
126:39 - it's all on the diagonal
126:41 - because i need to look at different
126:44 - parts of the noise space
126:47 - here we go i have automated
126:50 - the movement of the mouse this is
126:52 - driving me crazy that there's this giant
126:53 - processing window that opens up
126:55 - um can i there's no no canvas but i can
126:59 - do size i think the minimum is probably
127:01 - this
127:05 - and i could alt tab now so i could go to
127:07 - the open like
127:09 - yeah there we go welcome to my automated
127:13 - mouse movie
127:14 - i never need to operate the computer
127:16 - again
127:20 - this is the end of today's live stream
127:22 - the grand finale
127:24 - so what i really would like to do is
127:27 - train a machine learning model
127:30 - to follow my mouse movements and then
127:33 - recreate them
127:35 - can i get some help with that we'll see
127:38 - how far i get
127:39 - but this does work and i can actually
127:41 - have it click also which is quite
127:42 - dangerous
127:43 - the good thing i'm doing right now is
127:44 - i'm not having a click so
127:46 - it just only is like pearl and noise
127:49 - random movements
127:53 - so now the question is how do i stop
127:56 - this if because i've hit escape
127:58 - i'm not in the processing
128:01 - ah and um abe is giving me a link to
128:05 - um people who have done kind of like
128:06 - auto clickers to beat various games and
128:08 - things
128:09 - there's so this could this could there's
128:11 - a really really quite far and i realized
128:14 - i was completely forgetting to use this
128:15 - mouse the whole time
128:16 - but look can i match it not really can i
128:20 - now i can use like servo motors in this
128:22 - so this moves automatically
128:24 - nice game for my cat says sav that's a
128:27 - great um
128:29 - a great um a great
128:32 - uh tip
128:38 - okay so um i'm done for today
128:42 - um thanks everybody for tuning in i hope
128:44 - this was interesting to you
128:46 - um i want to make sure i capture i i'm
128:48 - gonna have to like gain control back
128:50 - over my mouse
128:52 - oh what's actually really interesting is
128:54 - now i'm collecting oh my god stop stop
128:55 - stop everybody
128:56 - i love this hold on like you gain
128:58 - control over my mouse
128:59 - i can't get it back
129:03 - come on you can do it no there we go no
129:05 - not that one
129:11 - there this one escape okay
129:14 - this is what i'm gonna do now i just had
129:15 - the most wonderful idea
129:20 - i am going to run the data collection
129:24 - fresh and then
129:28 - move that up here and i know i've got a
129:31 - little bit this can come down
129:35 - it's going to be closed now let me run
129:37 - this code
129:41 - and now i'm collecting the data from the
129:44 - automated mouse moving
129:46 - yay because why not
129:51 - thank you
129:58 - oh i don't hear the sound anymore but i
130:00 - think i'm playing a very loud sound
130:01 - effect my headphone battery died
130:03 - okay it is 12 10 i have got to go my
130:06 - children have to be picked up from
130:07 - school
130:08 - at one o'clock um cannot the cat should
130:11 - be chasing the mouse
130:12 - there's so many metaphors here that i
130:14 - think could work thank you for tuning in
130:17 - i'm gonna put on some music get myself
130:19 - cleaned up here and out of here
130:21 - um i think maybe what i'll actually do
130:23 - though is just leave this running
130:26 - i'm going to oh wait i can you still use
130:28 - this mouse
130:29 - as my outro screen i'm just going to
130:31 - take away my camera
130:33 - so i'm gone now um and
130:36 - um i am going to
130:41 - put on some music and uh leave this
130:43 - running and i will see you all
130:46 - uh next hopefully next friday i'm trying
130:49 - to do live streams on friday for the
130:50 - next
130:51 - um foreseeable future and um please come
130:54 - and join
130:55 - um check out the computer mouse
130:56 - conference um someone could post a link
130:58 - to the computer mouse conference in the
130:59 - chat
131:00 - um there's i think there's probably ways
131:02 - you could participate or still watch the
131:03 - conference i'm not entirely sure
131:05 - but um yeah okay here we go
131:08 - back to uh my
131:11 - music and there we go as always i always
131:15 - forget that this stop this stop this
131:17 - stop
131:18 - muting my mic but i'm still here i'm
131:20 - reading your chat messages
131:26 - [Music]
131:56 - [Music]
132:18 - this dot song never forget the this dot
132:21 - somebody composed that song for me
132:48 - [Music]
133:00 - i'm gonna say once again here we go
133:03 - sing it with me it's the forward
133:09 - [Music]
133:15 - cartesian songs
133:18 - [Music]
133:32 - autotune and the internet will fix that
133:34 - for me
133:35 - [Music]
133:39 - take it with me
133:45 - [Music]
133:56 - coordinate song
134:06 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
134:09 - else
134:09 - is there yes kittens
134:13 - thank you very much kittens and rainbows
134:15 - and cupcakes notice
134:16 - that look what i get i'm really losing
134:19 - my mind
134:20 - okay let's do it

135:43 - is not broken it has not frozen this is
135:45 - a
135:46 - this is a wonderful thing okay we're
135:48 - gonna do it
135:49 - i'm really getting to something i need
135:50 - my sound effects
136:03 - [Music]
136:12 - that was invalid syntax i forgot uh
136:14 - there was one other
136:15 - thing here that i think is important
136:17 - that i will use continuously
136:19 - over and over again all sorts of text
136:22 - generation
136:23 - analysis things that i will use
136:26 - continuously over and over again
136:29 - first thing i need to do is
136:31 - [Music]
136:46 - kittens and kittens and kittens and
136:47 - kittens kittens and kittens and kittens

Cleaned transcript:

so do check one two checking my audio how are my levels can you hear me all right we're starting in exactly one minute what i would like to also know is can you hear the clicking adit is watching the coding train live for the first time welcome ah hello welcome to a friday episode of the coding train it has been oh i just scared my poor dog gloria who has been sleeping so quietly over there and i have been very quietly sitting up here in the attic and just made a very loud hello to all of you and she just got up from her bed and left oh well goodbye gloria you can come back no dog cam for today i do have a mouse cam um i see a bunch of people saying this is my first time live well welcome to the first your first not the first live stream of the coding train i don't know what number somebody if actually everyone's from the community wants to volunteer to do this i used to number the live streams and then i would know what number i'm on i i currently have no idea um but uh welcome um i hate to break it to you but um these live streams are kind of a mess but i hope you do enjoy this one i have a very very specific task that i want to do today before i do that task though let me quickly thank today's sponsor and i'm not sure how exactly i'm going to do this i'm going to go over here and i'm going to press this button and oh my mouse mouse cam is right in front of it um but thank you to brilliant you should check out the website and app brilliant if you're interested in math and science and lifelong learning um it's a wonderful um website has a tremendous amount of courses interactive courses that align with a lot of the content that i do on the coding train um and uh you can sign up for free at brilliant.org codingtrain and the first 200 subscribers will get 20 off i'll come back later there's actually a really i just saw it on the homepage today there's a really fun daily challenge about waves which is very related to my nature of code chapter 3 book on waves so i'm going to do that daily challenge halfway through this live stream okay um back to whoa wrong button wrong button back to here that was by the way the brilliant neural network course which is excellent um and uh stig is saying um i'm specifically here for that mess never stop messing about yeah this is actually some interesting feedback not to get too immediately off on a tangent but i have received the feedback of as the tutorial videos get more and more produced with editing and animations um some of the sort of authentic elements of the original place where i started making these videos has been lost um and of course those authentic elements i hope are here in spades today during this live stream but i am thinking about this and how to balance the desire i have for sort of higher quality video tutorials that people can get through to learn something and create a project as well as the sort of fun mess that is often the coding train so um let's uh and arnov is saying just realized it's been five years watching the coding train mid april 2016. i don't know that's just crazy um lots of stuff is coming to the coding train soon i have all sorts of crazy plans i'm not gonna get into that right now because i have a very specific job that i need to do today and um i don't know how well this is going to go but let me jump right into it um so apologies if you haven't been in a live stream before i'm not going to spend a lot of time introducing myself or what this channel is but i'm going to talk about something that i am participating in that's happening at the end of the month and i have a lot of work to do for it so and i'm like it's really bothering me that there's this little uh keying issue right here um i will let me i'm not going to worry about that right now um i'm gonna i'm just gonna i'm gonna be okay with it um let me jump into what i want to do today so i'm gonna go over here um and i am going to open up no i need to use this mouse to force myself this by the way is a rollerball mouse uh i am going to open up the web browser and i am going to go to oh wait no before i even do that and that's why i need to open up processing so i'm going to open up on the desktop computer mouse mouse data collect i think is the one i'm looking for mouse data collect let me just run this so i want to be running this during the entire live stream today this is collecting data on all of my mouse movements i will come back to it but i wanted to at least set this up and running as i'm going so what am i doing today if i come back to the broadcast i went back to my track pad again everybody you know uh uh a familyfriendly show with lots of people who are under the drinking age so i don't want to say drink every time i go back to my track mad but i don't know put a quarter in the jar and donate it to a good cause every time i go back to my track pad uh let's go to a computer mouse conference computer mouse conference 2021 so the computer mouse conference um 2021 and let me just this is a different mouse i need to use to move this is a conference that's happening online it will be hosted on this page which i will uh click to um which is uh complicating the computer mouse um here is uh emma one of the organizers along with ashley lewis of the um computer mouse conference you should definitely watch this the da da of all demos videos which was performed on february 21st 2021 uh basically almost everything that i'm doing for the mouse conference is uh inspired by this particular uh performance um and so yes here are the conference organizers full names uh emma jane lewis and emma ray brumalnorton so i'm doing a bunch of things one i'm just like an incredibly enthusiastic and excited person about the computer mouse conference this is the second one i just followed it online um last year and i um have a chance to um sorry i have a sorry i'm reading the chat while i'm talking which i'm not gonna do um i have a chance to participate this year so i'm doing a couple things one there will be a simultaneous live stream hosted on the coding train during the conference um it uh it's a very i don't want to say too much about it now i'll let you find out about it as it gets announced as we planned it but there will be a live scene made by a wonderful artist um and seen maker who will be creating a live scene during during the conference so you'll want to tune in to the conference on the conference page where all the talks will be played but simultaneously there will be a scene being made and then i am also working on a video for the conference and i've really bitten off way more than i can chew here you know i am someone who has now built up a practice of being able to deliver coding tutorials and i can kind of have an idea and record a video and and work with uh matia who does the video editing and other collaborators of the coding train who help with the website and social media and all those kind of things and get that video out pretty quickly and um i'm trying to do something a little bit more creative and a little strange for the video for this conference um and so um it's kind of it's consuming me it's not exactly why i haven't been live streaming for the last month i was out of town um and didn't have my setup with me i was working but i just didn't have my setup with me but it's kind of what's now consuming me good news for all of you if you're not as interested in me being consumed with the mouse stuff is uh the conference is happening at the end of the month i'll be back to regular coding train stuff in may um i'm i'm a little bit behind i have a whole set of nature of code chapter 5 tutorials all about steering behaviors that i have yet to release there's five videos that i've recorded and are in the process um so what i'm doing today um is i want to build a couple of the coding examples for the um the conference video that i'm making um so that's what's happening today if you will bear with me for a second i um also oh whoa i'm getting some uh messages boom boom boom ding ding ding ding ding ding okay great hold on time out going back to this this view i was waiting for this to come in um i am now i'm i'm i've i've got we've got a new coding train character um that i'm also going to present to you please as you were uh talk amongst yourselves for a minute boy what am i i forgot that i was still live streaming i thought i actually like just cut myself off and put the intermission screen on but i'm still here give me a second okay we are just about i'm just about there image number two i just had to go into my direct messages to grab these images which is why i don't want to show you what i'm doing image number three and i think i've got one more to get oh my there's so many more image number four i don't think i need all of these uh and image number five there we go okay the beeping okay all right what am i doing now i'm being distracted by being at mentioned so many times uh i might have to turn off my notifications uh okay hold on almost there almost back grabbing these files um back to the coding train discord hide this and make sure i have uh where's that um in discord the streamer safe mode this is not going very well streamer mode enabled okay great got it okay and now one more button to press okay and um i'm coming back to you in three i mean i'm actually here coming back to you in three two one here we are now before i can go any further i need to figure something out so what i'm going to do and i simon thank you for all your reminders i'm i'm not doing a good job of using this mouse maybe if i just pick a different one maybe we should have i have a whole bag of old computer mics here this is actually one of my favorites this particular mouse has an actual like floating sailboat in it let's try this one see if it works i don't know if any of these work these are all um old ps2 mice and so i um have an adapter i'm gonna unplug the crayola one and let's try this one i have this amazing mickey mouse mouse um but i'll show it to you in a second but that one i couldn't get to work i don't know what i did with it actually um all right let's see how's this oh this one works really well okay this one works much better let's try this one for a little while it's also a roller roll mount look you can even see the water there okay so this is my data that i'm collecting so far um all right so what i the next thing i need to do i've got a bunch of things i need to do here one is uh right so now i can pepper these around the desktop should look kind of busy with lots of things on it oh so one thing you're not realizing probably and i'm going to just reveal this to you is that this is not actually what my desktop looks like i am going to go to too many things open uh laptop properties nope not properties laptop filters so this is what my desktop actually looks like and maybe i should just live stream with it looking exactly as it really looks it's got a solid green background but in open broadcast studio i'm keying out that background and i have this like these mouse characters there and what i need to do no no no stig is asking it's a mickey mouse mouse i gotta find it um where is my mickey mouse mouse oh here it is i hereby present to you the mickey mouse mouse um but what is very important that i do is i need to be capturing my screen this entire live stream but i i i could obviously this whole stream is being recorded and archived but it's got me in it it's got the uh the mouse cam in it so i think what i will do um is i'm just gonna open up open broadcast studio if you haven't seen this software before there we are there i am um and let me create a scene called uh desktop um and then i am going to add a uh um not window capture display capture and that's fine let's just call it so this is now capturing the full display um and then let's just check the settings um output um recording path that's fine high quality medium file size probably fine i'm afraid to make it much larger mp4 is a little bit scary because if it crashes can i make this higher i guess this will be fine right does anybody have any uh suggestions before i press record on what settings um um all right i think i'm gonna just be okay with this what if i go here video oh canvas resolution output scaled yeah this is this is this is all fine okay i'm gonna leave it as such i'm going to hit start recording so now i am recording everything that i do on my desktop the other thing that i want to record is this mouse cam footage how am i going to do that uh all right somebody tell me um jeffrey is saying you should disable window tinting in the settings so all the windows aren't green i don't know how to do that if somebody wants to give me um if so i really have to turn my notifications off i'm getting so by the way this is i'm gonna i'm in a like a crazy place right now because i have so much going on in so many different aspects of my life but we're gonna make this happen window tinting is in mac os system preferences the thing is i don't really mind um what i'm gonna use this for i don't really mind having the window tinting i think but the stream is laggy is that i've that's the second message i saw about that you know i don't see anything being laggy but what can i um hopefully it's um just i'm not so not um everybody hm all right so here's what i need now i was really by the way i was setting up for this live stream starting at 9am this morning and obviously i didn't finish because i'm still trying to set them things up i want to also record this so what's the equivalent i have open broadcast studio running already to stream so i don't want to record to disk with open broadcast studio but what can i use this is hooked up to my windows computer just to record the output to disk of this particular camera as one big video file while i'm streaming um windows um oh you know what i wonder if the chroma keying is causing it to be really slow so let's turn off the chroma keying the fact that obs has to chroma key the desktop let's see i have by the way i also have this mouse which i'm using to control the windows computer so like uh let me turn off and see if that um let me turn off the chroma keying that was just to make it visually nicer for those of you watching but it's more authentically gr this is actually what i'm uh streaming um okay vbs i'm being told um so tell me if this uh fixes oh no it does look kind of choppy even in open broadcast studio why do you think that is that's weird i've never had this issue i could try unplugging and plugging back in that always usb capture hdmi highest frame let's just give me a second here let me unplug this no signal i'm gonna plug it back in no it's still kind of choppy the the good news is what i'm i mean i think it's still watchable and my you know this is the important recording that i'm making now which i don't think has any issues in it um reboot yeah uh handbrake uh the capture of your laptop is low fps yeah i totally agree all right i can try to debug this a little bit longer let's try this so now i'm doing something crazy on my back i switched cameras let's go back to this device default custom whoa highest fps match output fps whoa now it's gone device default i i have a better idea of what to do a little bit extreme this but i'm gonna do it is i think this is probably not ah i think i had it into one of the lower speed usb ports that i didn't realize let's see if this fixes it oh so it's gone now which it should be thank you all for bearing with me here this is uh okay yeah fixed right that's fixed it was in a um i unplugged my whole setup when i went away because i was using some of the equipment and i plugged the hd the hdmi capture uh device into a lower speed usb port so i think we should be good now um okay uh now the next thing i need to do is i need to re of course this is now totally frozen nothing works right uh properties uh this is so uh and here we go there now this is back um now what i need to do is figure out how to record um record this camera so i'm still looking for a window a piece of windows sort of software um that just i could i could guess i could run another instance of obs right whoa i could run another instance of obs and just have that one recording just this to disk um let's see about that um now because this is a little bit ridiculous what i'm doing here but let's see what do i have here okay what piece of software do i have that will allow me to record this camera um i'm looking at all the software i have on this computer video lan what's that oh that's vlc i don't think the voice recorder windows um powerpoint screen recording zoom should i just use zoom i'm gonna use zoom and log into a zoom meeting this is actually not the worst idea because we'll record it to the cloud all right this is crazy i'm gonna open up zoom [Laughter] uh because i know this will work this is totally ridiculous what i'm doing i'm gonna do it anyway um let's see oh please wait for the host to start this meeting no i am the host i am the host you have found that out haven't you join with computer audio start video now let's go to this overhead camera as my video and oh we can't access the camera because it's being used by obs i forgot that windows can't have two pieces of software all right i'm gonna give up on that i'm giving up on this i'm recording my desktop that's good enough um this um this will be the recording this little box will be the recording of the mouse movements [Laughter] okay all right hi again is it 10 30 how am i doing terribly terribly terribly terribly thank you all you are the kindest nicest most wonderful people on the internet who are very patient with me um yeah i could use the virtual camera so many things i could do to record it but i'm i'm giving up on it i don't think it's that big of a deal if i'm not separately recording me using the mouse all right so the two projects i would like to build and i'm curious to see if anybody um has a strong preference as to what i start with but and actually you know what forget it i'm gonna start with what i plan to start with and what i know how to do here is one of the core ideas that i am going to talk about in my mouse conference video i'm going to make a very basic p5js and this is um i guess i'll just leave this up here again i have to try to use this mouse i'm going to make a very basic uh p5.js example for you right now and let's make the font a little bit bigger i think i usually put it at 32. if mousex is greater than 200 background um red i need to look at my script hold on because in the script that i've written that i'm going to record i guess i'm going to record it later i could just do whatever i did here all right i'll match it i haven't recorded it yet i'm going to record some voiceover to explain this example so i'm going to say if the mouse is on the righthand side of the window this is bothering me i use the wrong mouse again but that's down here there we go um then color the background red otherwise color the background green if it's on the left hand and i definitely should not use green because i'm keying out the color green that's the wrong mouse i have so many different mice all right so let's say it'll be blue if it is on the left hand side so this is this is one of the first things that you not you specifically you the person watching this live stream right now but the royal you so to speak um might learn in an intro to coding course so this is something that i that as a first example of a couple things one conditional logic and thank you um uh object is making an excellent uh suggestion which it would make more sense for me to write in width divided by two in order to if i were to change the window the canvas size now it still works i might also just for um being able to see some see kind of what's going on i might want to draw a line from the center to the bottom and boy i got my x's and y's mixed up line of x comma y and then x comma y there we go so i see that line uh maybe we'll make that um a little brighter and uh we'll make it a little bit thicker i'm using the wrong mouse again so now we can see blue red blue red red blue red blue so i have this kind of theory here i don't know if it's really a theory but one of the things i want to discuss and think about is what does it mean that uh how do how do what is an effective way to teach and understand machine learning and so there's a talk um kyle mcdonald you can find this online the kik festival there's a recording of his talk on vimeo from the kick festival talks about and this is not his original idea but he has a really nice quote in that talk about it talks about programming as writing instructions for the computer to follow i'm paraphrasing here of course whereas machine learning is instead of writing the instructions for the computer to follow is providing the examples for the um uh for the computer to learn from to then develop the instructions right so if if a um so in other words here are some here are some examples here's some examples of the mouse on the righthand side of the screen here are some examples of the mouse on the lefthand side of the screen can you learn from that to extrapolate knowing whether the mouse is on the righthand side or the lefthand side that is the essence in some ways of machine learning as opposed to kind of traditional programming which is here's a very explicit rule so i like this scenario because it is incredibly ridiculous right i don't believe i don't know that rewriting this code with a neural network to decide whether to color the background blue or red what value does that add it's like tremendous amount of overkill um in terms of just this if this is what i want the program to do but my theory here what i want to suggest here is that this could be an effective way to rewrite this code to do uh and and peter in the chat thank you for this is saying can be described as explicit versus implicit as well which is excellent um terminology to sort of think about in this context so what i want to do right now and i'm giving myself about 25 minutes is i want to rewrite this example to in to to do exactly the same thing when i move the mouse left and right the color of the background changes but rather than have an if statement i'm going to have a neural network uh operate on the uh classifying the points as left and right hand side now you might be saying like are you insane i mean well clearly the answer to that is somewhat uh you know we can make arguments on both sides but i you know how are you gonna do that in 25 minutes so you know i'm not going to build a neural network from scratch although i do have like a 10part video series um and um what i'm going to do instead is use the ml5 library so let's get started and i'm going to go to ml5 js and i am using the wrong mouse again i am going to get go to the get started page i am going to find uh this and so i can import the ml5 library into index.html i better save this by the way and i'm going to call this mouse learning that's the title of my talk mouse learning and i don't need the sound library so i know that second one is the sound library so let's paste in this and the other thing i i really prefer to do is um hold on ml5 and i just oops ml5 github wrong mouse again i can't i can't get it right i should switch by the way i need a like reminder to switch mice every every once in a while so i have a lot of fun ones to try um uh library uh releases where are the releases 0.6.1 so i i prefer rather than saying latest to put just put a version number in um and so what do i need let's let me duplicate this i'm going to do duplicate i should probably just look so i have these as separate versions and i want to have a variable and i'm going to call it model for machine learning model and the model is an ml5 neural network and typically when you create an ml5 neural network the idea is that you have to give it some configuration information about what are the inputs and what are the outputs so and um so i'm going to make a javascript object called options and the inputs are i forget how this works so i'm going to just try to do it from memory and then i'll look at the reference we'll see where i went wrong i just need an x and a y so those will be the inputs to the neural network right the inputs the inputs actually oh i just need the x oh my goodness this is a neural network with one input how insane let's let's let's go with the simplest possible i mean it's again this is absurd um yeah and simon's giving me a very good note here which is that um i shouldn't call this model we'll call this i'll just call this brain because this is going to be the brain of my program because model is a builtin variable maybe in p5 and it can cause a conflict the outputs are let's call it left and right as the sort of labels of what i'm classifying then i want to say debug is true which is um not so important right now but i'll show you where that comes into play later when i start debugging the neural network so um let's give myself a little bit more space to code and let me hit run things are still working no errors we're in good shape here i think and by the way i'm still by the this is all of my mouse movements so far from today that i'm collecting this data because i'm going to do something else with this data i'll come back to that uh yeah i'll come back to that in a little bit that's using something called the java robot class which i definitely want to refer to okay so now that i have this what's next i want to i need to collect some data um and and just to be clear about this um if if this is all completely new to you um i would suggest this tutorial set of tutorials that i have i'm kind of redoing very in a very fastpaced way this um ml5 train your own neural network save data save model there's a regression example so all of these video tutorials that i have on the channel if you're brand new today and machine learning is totally new to you i've never seen ml5 before these videos would hopefully give you some more context okay so i'm going to add the mouse pressed function then i believe whenever i press the mouse i should just make a bit of data that has mouse x mouse y you know what would be great the input should actually just be mouse x i should call the label input mouse x and i can't bring myself to not use mouse y but i'm gonna and then and then the object i can use that fancy enhanced object literal by just saying this is the data that's the input to the neural network uh oh and thank you soren for um for uh providing links about what i'm talking about into the chat that's uh wonderful it's so helpful and i so appreciate when people do that okay next up the um the label so here's where it gets starts getting really absurd oh so this is the input that's the input now the output is honestly like i kind of lost i don't know what i'm doing i'm going to assume the output is left and then if mouse x is greater than width divided by two the output should be let's just call this label right now label is left the label should be uh right and then i believe i can say brain dot add data inputs and uh and then i think i'm supposed to put the label in an array there's a lot of different ways you can do this with ml5 and i'm kind of guessing as i'm going because i don't like know it off the top of my head because you could have multiple outputs multiple classifications or regressions so maybe this isn't the friendliest way to write it but the idea is the inputs are just one thing the mousex value and the output is either left or right so let's just run this to see if i get any errors click click click click i think it would be helpful if i console log something like um adding data mouse x um adding i'll just do like this input mousex comma comma output label so we'll see something hopefully up here now yeah right right left left so the um the console log is showing me stuff that's correct so that's i'm adding that data to the neural network and then uh i guess i'm going to use keep rest i can make a button let's make a button to make this example a little bit nicer let's make a variable called train button train button equals create button train for coding train then i will say train button mouse pressed and then brain dot train and i believe when i is that right mouse pressed oh no hold on function i have no idea what i'm doing i forgot how to write javascript to call the train function now there's also options i think the only option i really care about is something called epochs and i'm just going to make that one right now and epoch is a training cycle over all of the data so again everything i'm doing here is uh um basically uh absurd because i am trying to train an all powerful neural network with one input and one output equivalent to just is the mouse on the left and right hand side so how much data i have what all the sort of like what's the learning rate all these things are kind of really arbitrary right now let me just see if this gives me any errors and by the way this is now where debug comes in so once i hit this train button i should see a debug window that's showing me a graph of the loss so as the neural network is learning from these examples right these examples of and i'll do this now of like right right right right right right right right left left left left left left left left left left left left left left left i should really draw something as i'm doing this it'll be much more interesting visually because ultimately this uh screen capture that i'm doing is going to be um in this video that i'm making and so i'm now let me i'm going to keep going but i'm going to add something to draw because i think that'll be kind of important so i'm going to hit train and let's see what happens and i got an error so that's good i mean not good that i got an error but cannot read property to lower case of null huh line 16 brain train all right let's let's look at the ml5 neural network documentation it's time um and uh train no train model and and train oh that looks like i did it kind of right um let's see what did i get wrong here also just afraid that my i want to make sure my um obs thing is still recording yeah okay it looks like it is i kind of want to stop it just to check the file but i'll keep going um what did i get wrong cannot read property two lowercase of no hold on let's look at the javascript console here let me hit stop because oh yeah this is something in ml5 now is this a bug that i found or um hold on let's look let's see if i let's look at inputs well i could also do it as just a number no average temperature oh oh it's not an op no that's right oh left right that looks this looks right i guess i could say output label is that actually what i'm supposed to be doing is it just freaked out because there's only one data point all right let's just because i'm like it's making me paranoid that it's gonna like not work without at least two inputs because why would you ever have a neural network with one input so let me um add a second input here and let me look for the add data function inputs is an object output oh you know that's another way i could do it i think maybe actually the way that i should be doing this is this let's try it this way um okay still got an error what if i say this here weird uh i haven't been working with the recent ml5 let's just try like this whoops is there not a point one whoa i messed something up okay so that at least this error is not like some new error oh oh my goodness master stormer in the discord member chat i forgot something so important where's my sound effect of me being very sad like this could be my sound effect me being happy uh i forgot um the default task that ml5 performs is a regression which says has the output of the neural network be a floating point number so let's just see what this gives me yeah there we go something else went wrong but that's fine uh all right all right that's fine okay let's get to um this is we're getting closer now that was definitely an issue let's try um i want to go back to this i don't know why that i wanted to do it this way it kind of doesn't make sense maybe but one two three four one two three four uh train so what just happened there shoot okay let's go back to an earlier version of ml5 same error that's good i just want to make sure it's not like okay what did i miss in terms of how i'm setting this up uh i think the let me look at my uh examples that go along with uh let me look at this particular example to find out so this example is from it's basically i'm rebuilding what is in uh this code example and if i go to the web editor now um yeah yeah i got it i got it xy label oh i did forget to normalize the no but that i did forget to normalize the data before i trained it um and inputs x y add data target where's it is an object with the label okay so let me try to mirror this an object with the label so and what did i just say i forgot to do i forgot to say in the train button brain dot normalize data now this should really be the same as that example that's the only thing um it should work without normalizing it like in terms of not giving me an error it just should be kind of awkward so let's try this try clicking clicking clicking clicking clicking the train let's give it some more epochs because it's this like so fast what did i do that's different from so did why did hmm change outputs back to left right i don't think i'll try that it really shouldn't matter actually the interesting thing is honestly like this is not necessary at all um ml5 is set up to once you've added data to like figure out what the configuration is of the inputs and the outputs so let me try and let's do it this way i want to say console.log inputs and console.log let's just look at both of these just to be sure two three yeah so that's this is what i'm putting in you can see it down here let's call train let's look at this e is not a function call back oh oh i know what the problem is i'm such a dumdum i think i just forgot to be no yeah so that like kate weakman is suggesting your model might be too complex to be trained with so little dina dana no no i honestly i think what this is is i'm just forgetting like an important step which is that um i do need to give it at least one callback like i don't think there's anything in the model in the ml5 code that will account for um when you if you don't bother to give it like you finished training callback i i literally think it's just this which i should have realized from the jump so i'm clicking i'm clicking i'm gonna hit train yeah see i just didn't have a call back sorry everybody that was the problem uh and i realized i'm kind of like sitting in front of some of this so that you can't see but hopefully you're following all right so now and and i would like to be able to see more of the code so let me do this all right so the uh the thing that i would like to do now is uh have it draw the the data so um can i um i mean this is i'm just gonna do this myself uh i think i could get the actually all right let's let's let's look at the data uh in uh ml5 itself so i can figure out where it is so i'm clicking and then i want to um basically evaluate myself i think if i look at this brain object and i apologize that this is here because now i want you to look here um and this too many mice this i can close um this here is i believe it's in brain.data maybe training array zero um what if i say brain.normalize data and now it's there so where was it before i called normalize add data load data save data that's so weird where it's got to be saved somewhere hold on let me run this again okay now this is silly because i could just look this up probably in the ml5 documentation data training array hmm where did the data go metadata add data load data normalized data so strange like why is the data nowhere until neural network data ah raw here it is so this is um you know i could just save my own mouse clicks but i would like to get accesses so this was uh brain dot neural network data dot data dot raw okay how are we doing oh it's 11 o'clock we're really close i'm really close i'm going to move through this a little bit so now in draw i want to say let data equals what i say brain dot neural network data dot data dot raw right and then for let um row of data console.log row let's put this in mouse press just for a second so i can see if this is actually right so yeah i got an object with x's mouse x mouse y so if i take this and go here then i can say um circle um row dot x's dot mouse x row dot x's dot mouse y fill 255. so let's do that errors whoops no stop console logging am i in draw oh i need to give it a um actual size there we go okay great so that's that and then uh fill you know what i should make the labels red and blue right so let's make the labels red and blue that way i can just say fill um row.wise.label and i shouldn't have this anymore and we can say no stroke and there we go okay great okay so now i have i am i'm ready for the next step here which is to see if the model oh and sorry this is totally in your way again um okay sorry about that one two three four let's see if i can get it to work with like i don't know 20 data points that's a lot all right now i'm going to train the model and i guess i should give it more epochs let's give it a 50 epochs and i kind of want to go back to not having mouse y let's go back to no mouse y okay because now we should be able to do that uh oh wrong mouse uh and now wait what just happened oh because oh but i do want the mouse i do want if i'm going to draw it okay fine i'll keep the mouse why it's it's it's irrelevant information but i'm going to keep it i'm going to keep it just for my own sanity right now because i also need to finish this so let's also while i'm here let's say um hold on i can do this i can do this i can do this what am i doing next ah is trained is trained as false when the training is complete is trained is true and then in draw if is trained the inputs i'm going to make new inputs is mouse x mouse y then the output the the output is take the brain and call classify i'm going to try calling classify sync so normally sync would require an asynchronous callback classifier require an asynchronous callback but i am just going to try it with classify sync to see if this work those inputs and then i should be able to say background outputs index 0 dot label i know i'm not explaining all the pieces i'll once again refer you to uh the video tutorial series where i go through how this works in great detail i will explain this if it actually works which i don't necessarily think that it will so now i'm just going to give it a few data points on each side i'm going to hit train the model is being trained over 50 epochs i think this now should probably just go over here or something and i can hide this oh look at that look at that folks all right that's a little bit insane to me the what it's doing with the dots once i've trained the model but um let's add let's add a little stroke um that is wild so i have now changed my did i right this if statement right this if statement right here which is now commented out is doing exactly the or this neural network is with the inputs of mouse x and mouse y which i believe is completely unnecessary here is now doing the actual work the same work as this particular if statement i have finished this particular project now let me give it some nice kind of training all the way up until the edge there and by the way what i really should demonstrate now is that i think i could also get rid of that line and i could have more um uh other shapes okay ready now i'm gonna hit train we're seeing the loss go down over 50 epochs i'm going to hide this debug panel and here i am on the right hand side i have blue the left hand side is red now notice it's not perfect like it appears perfect if i do it really fast and we could do something i could visualize the entire like solution space right i could iterate over every single pixel and get the output color that would certainly be interesting to do um i don't know that i have time to do it right now a guy is saying it's cooler when the dots disappear um oh and i want to swap them out so let's do this again but let's try a new mouse i actually really want to try um this so this is a um giant rollerball mouse called the trackman vista let's give this one a try see if i can get this crazy example to work with this one i also want to get rid of the line and try to make like a circle in the middle so like can i make the equivalent of a button basically or roll over so let's see i'm unplugging this mouse yeah diagonal model i think i'm going to do a circular one i mean this is very similar to my perceptron example all right so first let's put this here is this actually working oh my god this actually works oh this is very weird how do i use this thing did anybody actually use these okay oh my god okay now i'm going to go over here i'm going to click this button wait is this a button i can click yeah on the side with my thumb right here okay you know what i should have done is i should have i should plug you know what i could do i could do this right now i don't know if this is a good idea or not because i haven't been doing this the whole time but i'm gonna um i'm gonna try why not it's caution to the wind um this is there's so many reasons why this is a bad idea i was gonna just plug this camera into this actual laptop and then just bring it up on the desktop and it would actually be recorded and that way i think that would be fun to do let me do that okay so um let's first get rid of the and i'm i'm over time here because i need to take my break but i will get to that in just a few minutes um there that goes away i'm unplugging it where is it plugged into it's plugged into here now i am plugging it into this usb port okay now oh my god i can't do it i gotta use the track pad just for time right now uh new no quick time and new movie recording is that what i want yeah but i want to change to this camera which is now this then i can oh i could actually this is i could have just been recording this the whole time and i mean is this going to kill my machine to also and it's so bright um can i um slower the brightness oh there we go um i'm gonna throw caution to the wind and record this also oh i could have been doing this the whole time and then it's also over here it's behind me now i'm over here will that fade away that um i'm recording button guess yeah there we go there we go okay now it's still kind of bright oh you hear me differently now wait was this whole time i wasn't using this microphone oh my god was i using a low quality mic this whole time and nobody said anything hold on let's check the mic test test test oh i think it is this mic now maybe it wasn't before this is a much higher quality mic that maybe i was not using all right so now here we go this is the grand finale oh wait wait wait i want to take out the line well let's keep the line for a second i'll do it first this okay this is very hard yeah i should bring the exposure down i know okay maybe it was the same mike is fine it switched a while ago interesting all right let's train i should give it more i should have given it more epochs that was my mistake okay ah oh this is very strange what i'm doing okay here we go ready everybody now i'm gonna hit the train button i definitely should have given it more epochs but that's fine now we're gonna hide this console and here we go yay it works wild i don't know about you but i absolutely love what i'm doing so uh three cheers for myself from me to myself pat's on the back um i'm hoping this will make an interesting video after i capture the stuff and do some voiceover um but let's try one more thing i'm going to comment out this line hit save then i'm going to run the sketch again and oh wait a second oh no no no okay okay oh i cheated i mean it's all cheating everything is cheating but i cheated like a whole extra level beyond my original thing that i thought i was cheating which is that um i meant to actually have to manually set the label so uh let's let's add that drop down i'm going to make a a variable called drop down drop down equals create select then i can think i can see drop drop down dot option red drop down dot option blue and now and i run this sketch i should have a drop down here that i um where i can just change from red to blue and then that's really like i shouldn't be able to automate what the label is and so this should be a dropdown dropdown.value so i have to actually set it hello hello um by the way am i i'm very like orange today i feel like it's not just the hat maybe it's the lighting or something in here i do have a way of maybe it's because i'm getting a lot of sunlight in here um okay i'm just checking my messages i have to pick up children from school at one and i'm actually not nowhere near close to where that is right now so i definitely have to be out off off by by a little afternoon um okay so now what i am looking to do for real changes to a hundred because i want to see it train for longer and then um is this all i meant to do um there was something else that was in my head here a second ago but now i've forgotten oh let's try it red red red so like if i do this red and then i change this to blue and try to do a bunch of blue like here in the center and then if i hit train it's having some trouble differentiating do i need more data blue in the center red on the outside uh it's getting confused over here but you can see that i am getting some results now um let's try this again but with if you'll bear with me if you'll humor no you know what i'm going to force myself to use this mouse maybe i should try a different mouse what else do i have in here by the way i have this really awesome um star trek like communicator mouse but um unfortunately it's the wrong i don't have an adapter it's like an old uh serial port can i take the exposure down even further here you can't really um i can do weird stuff like this though come on back okay all right um try i have a memorex three button mouse i really like this um i've got some of these old microsoft i'm really sad that this one doesn't work let's just try it just to be 100 sure because the mickey mouse mouse is really the best of them all oh that's the pro oh so i know what the problem is and i thought about this all of these clicks are causing the training data to be inputted so is that if that's a way to say it um there's i i know what to do i'm gonna say uh let i only want uh clicks that are on the canvas and then i'm gonna say canvas mouse pressed training data and then we'll call this function uh training data i knew there was something that i was doing wrong uh this is a this is a fool's errand that i'm trying because i i i really tried trying to fix this mouse yesterday but let's just see so now this mouse the mickey mouse mouse you can see the button works the button works but the cursor does not move and i've tried like i'm opening it up we can see the actual like roller mechanism that like even manipulating the roller mechanism myself um i am not able to get the thing to move i could build an object detection machine learning model to track the mouse and then control the cursor with that that's a whole other project i'm sad that i don't have time to do that maybe next weekend next live stream um okay so this one has to go away unfortunately what i i i i really like i really have failed in um my live poll software because if i had really ever finished that project i could just have a poll right now for people to vote on a mouse i do really like this one because it says packard bell on it i don't think packard bell exists anymore so let's try this packard bell one okay there we go now we're trying the packard bell one how do i wish i could is it like i'm just gonna have to live with i could actually what i could do um is i could lower the amount of light in this room so let me do this um because i have these um elgato key lights that i really love and if i turn them down like let me just turn them off for a second like i'm in the dark but at least now this doesn't look so crazy let's give myself a little bit more light wow oh that's the temperature i was playing with the color temperature not the brightness so um let me keep turning this down uh and then uh well if i just turn these off is that even better all right i'm turning the lights off just for a second it's fine this camera doesn't need the lights okay ready here we go oh boy this one's hard to use i move so slowly which is actually fine i could adjust the settings of the speed okay now let me go to a blue okay now let's try drum roll please training come on come on loss oh keep going keep going oh i need more than 100 epochs it'll keep going but that's probably gonna do it so now blue red blue red look at that beautiful i made like a rollover button a roll over with machine learning and an old timey mouse i love it i love it it's ridiculous and i love it oh yeah so um right uh people but people are making a lot of good interface improvement suggestions which absolutely do make sense okay um let's do a couple things here let me um come over here and hit stop so this is save that was only 12 minutes mouse movements save that to the desktop one okay so i have this archival footage which can get placed into the video that i'm making then i also want to let's go back to obs and tell it to stop recording where by the way i'm just gonna um just because i've got my um obs configuration i want to look at uh okay yeah that's fine let's see how that um turned out because it should be here this is video capture of my entire session just now awesome i think i got that so this is good raw material footage that i'll be able to add in the background or something of this video that i'm making okay i still have more to do today this is not the end of the stream although we're closing in on the end um first let me close some of this stuff out let me click click here so this by the way uh it's pretty interesting to see these are all of the mouse movements that i have done today during this live stream and you can see now uh over here like kind of this is the cluster of all that stuff that i was doing and this is probably maybe the menu of the p5 web editor it's kind of interesting to see this constellation of mouse movements let me at a minimum just take a screenshot of this but also if i click i believe i have it set up to if this code was written correctly which i'm going to build a little example like this in a moment um i should be able to look at the data folder and see that these are csvs of all of the mouse clicks of the mouse locations and timestamps so actually speaking of which um i could really use some help from the community let me turn my lights on let me i really need to do my sponsor segment uh so i don't get fired here um but um let me just briefly mention um something that is a sort of a call that i would love help with i would like to train a sketch rnn style model out of all these mouse movements because part of what i'm doing is then to have an example of an ai that is just operating the mouse for me someone's at front door yeah i'm sorry i can't come to the door right now hope it's not any of you um uh so um what um so yeah so if i don't actually know how to do this i was looking at this thing called like deep svg i'm sort of out of my i'm kind of running out of time here to be able to add this example to the things that i'm building for the mouse conference so um if anybody else happens to have a lead or want to help uh figure out a way to train a sequential model off of the mouse locations sketch rnn deep svg are examples of it doesn't have to be done well or accurately just to be something that's kind of like fun that i can kind of get to work you know huge benefit if i could do it with tensorflow.js but um i'll take any help that i can get um hit me up on twitter at shifement but before i go to the second half of this live stream where i'm going to look at this java robot class that's in this example i want to take a minute uh or so and i've lost my mouse here to thank today's sponsor um brilliant so let me pull up the brilliant website um and let me pull up my notes over here that i have uh that i seem to have lost that's okay please hold highly professional operation i've got going on here it's funny i wrote up all these notes and then i by accident closed the window and i don't really need the notes because um you know i it's very easy for me to talk about brilliant because i use it regularly myself and what i find to be the most wonderful part about brilliant and i think i can take the banner away now that i have the website up is the way that it is provides an alternate modality for learning that's different from what i do in video tutorial so hopefully you the viewer of the coding train like to watch my videos you learn something you have a little fun maybe you make a creative project for me in addition i do watch a lot of tutorials video tutorials and i especially like other people's live coding live streams but a really fundamental i think in critical way to learn is through practice you know it's not memorizing it's not watching lectures although those can be great too being someone who delivers lectures but um doing it yourself and so brilliant is a website that really allows you to do it yourself and i think the thing for me to really highlight are these courses and you can see our beautiful geometry statistics scientific infinity oh the infinity one is so so so good uh computer science fundamental introduction neural networks mathematical fundamentals prealgebra scientific thinking um you know i've been doing my kids are in um fourth and sixth grade and i i'm like they're like please stop bothering me like we could do our math homework on our own but i'm like can i please do my math homework with you and so when they don't let me i could just go to brilliant and kind of do my own math homework so um it's a it's a wonderful website full of courses you can just sign up for free i'll put the banner um right here you know if you sign up um just for free it actually like helps me out a little bit lets them know that you found brilliant through the coding train if it's something that really appeals to you and you want to get the full premium subscription to unlock all of the features um by going through that link you will also get a 20 off coupon i'll also mention that it's actually a really great thing to give as a gift so sometimes you know if you don't know what to buy somebody and you don't want to like you know just keep collecting more material goods um giving somebody a subscription for learning um is a wonderful um idea for a gift so i would definitely also suggest that as well let's what i like to do i just be you know i usually like to poke through some of the courses but um i really want to quickly just look at this ride the wave um challenge that i did look at earlier um ben i immediately noticed it because it is a really really related to if i go to nature of code on my website and if i get to chapter three you can see these videos like graphing the sine wave um additive waves um so if you want to think about waveforms and go deeper into them a lot of the stuff that i that i'm doing with physics simulation there's tons more content on and brilliant and i've already lost so let's look at this one and see if we can solve this together and i've lost my view of the chat so let me just grab my view of the chat um so that i can see if anybody's telling me anything super important um okay so look at these two graphs if they both remind you of polynomials you're right can we say something more about the relationship between these two graphs now i already know what the relationship is because i looked at this earlier i haven't looked at what the challenge question is yet but i did look at um just this sort of like written description so i'm gonna just i'm gonna i'm gonna play some uh awaiting music and think about this i'll look in the chat see if anybody wants to offer a suggestion interestingly oh yeah no this is what i expect yeah i was trying to look for i was trying to look for for me what's important to note is look at these peaks and valleys right up here this peak is around like negative three and what's happening at negative three oh it's right around zero this peak is around one and what's happening there at one oh look it's at zero see what about this valley here negative one negative one oh look at that it's right around zero so ever heard the term the slope the slope refers to what the kind of like what uh you can think of like the tangent like if i were to draw a line that's tangent like the slope i've like lost my ability to use words um but uh let's let's read because it'll it'll explain this you know here we go we've got the answer the derivative the reason i was coming with slope is like i think it's the music it must be the music as the top of this curve levels off the tangent to that is a flat line the slope the change the rate of change in that curve is suddenly zero um at those peaks and values the derivative being the rate of change i talked about this a lot in my videos about position and velocity velocity being the change in position so this graph i if i've read this correctly is the derivative it is graphing the slope of the tangent to this curve and so that's why you'll see that these peaks and values uh peaks and val that peaks and valleys is where um the derivative is zero and i'm i'm sure i've gotten this not exactly right oh look at this and this is the other thing i love about brilliant is um it gives you i i was like trying to like use my mouse cursor but here is a really wonderful interactive environment now here's what i love about brilliant also i want to make this as a p5 sketch now so so badly but i can't because i don't have time to do that right now but i should come into a whole um session with like that but um uh so anyway you can read a lot more you can sort of see uh more explanation but let's um let's go down to the challenge so this is today this is a graph one of the three graphs below represents the derivative of the function graphed above okay which one they all kind of look the same to me this is going to be hard well if i go with my peaks and valleys right valley at zero peak at one value two peak at three so the derivative should cross zero at zero one two three oh so it's this one or uh zero one no so a or b what about c ah so it's definitely not c i've eliminated c so it's a or b um the other thing i think i could do is here it's increasing so the derivative should be positive and here the it's decreasing so the derivative should be negative is that right so it's not this one because this is going down and then after one it's going up it should be going up oh well it's the value is increasing but like the rate of change actually is going up up up up up then it's going down down down to zero then it's going up up up then it's slowing down right so i i it's not just like what is the literal value changing it's how is that how is it changing so i think oh no no that's right it's b because it's the rate of change is going up up is increasing it's all it's positive that whole time it's hard to see because this looks like a straight line to me but it's like increasing more rapidly and it's increasing more slowly then it levels off it's decreasing more rapidly so that matches up with b i think i see i see a b in the chat from damien right and simon most like very accurately states what does this have to do with the wave series though it has more to do with calculus and trig and ultimately that's absolutely correct so the only thing that has to do with the wave series is visually they match and i i think i saw that and that's what grabbed me um but you're absolutely right um i do think it does it is interesting to think about how you might uh think about waves as sort of more polynomial forms or how you might be able to like bring these two concepts closer together but that is correct that the it's this is really more of a calculus problem all right let's do b i don't even know if this is operational i'm gonna get my one day streak now decreasing rapidly slowly has to do with the second derivative like acceleration to velocity velocity position thank you yeah uh and here we go oh i got it correct okay great i got my one day streak because i haven't done it i didn't do a challenge yesterday so um this is there's and this is why i love there's all sorts of wonderful communitybased explanations so um you know for me uh and what i would really suggest you do is if you participate in these challenges try to solve them with p5 and code and then go back to them and and by the way if you want to also learn i meant to show you these but like this for example uh brilliant has a whole course on learning python so you can see it's interactive and you can type code in it um as well as this neural network example as well so um thank you to um brilliant for being the uh sponsor of today's live stream uh i'm gonna take a short three or four minute break i have like half an hour left to look at the java robot class when i come back um so stick around if you can if you have a few minutes to sign up through this link it brilliant um you can do so for free and if it uh and if you're interested in the obviously the premium subscription you can get a discount there okay so see you all in approximately uh hopefully a little bit less than five minutes i'll be right back sorry i hit the mute button on the music so the whole time i can hear it in my monitor but none of you could hear it do do okay i am coming back here for uh what is uh simon most accurately states is not the second half of the stream i think i can say part two part two will be much shorter than uh part one uh thanks again to brilliant um all right so now before i start coding this part what i need to do is a couple things i need to get my recording going again so i'm going to start recording my desktop so that's recording then i need to get my mouse cam going also uh which i should be able to do this way and just move it over here like this and shrink it up and hit um hit record this is the way i should have been doing this all along by the way okay so mouse cam is recording but we also need to pick a mouse because this one was this one's not really very usable okay so what do i have left i i did i do have this lovely crayola mouse that i don't think i used yet so let's use the crayola mouse um there we go plugging it in okay now hopefully everybody can hear me and see me this mouse works pretty well so that's good um the other thing i want to make sure that i do is open up the data collect because i do want to be running data collection in the background that might cause a problem because i'm going to i don't know if the java robot class can be used in multiple sketches but i'm gonna assume that this is okay for the moment all right so what is it that i want to do demonstrate to you um uh robot demo java it's weird that it's called um and i'm gonna save this just on the desktop um it's weird that it's called the robot class so i do need a browser i close the browser i need the browser open uh java robot so what is this java robot and i don't know what version of java i'm using in processing but let's let's go to this one so the the java robot class so okay hold on everybody i got a lot of explaining to do about what's going on here um processing is a programming environment that i use quite often um it is what i used almost exclusively before i started doing a lot of my work and teaching in javascript in the browser with p5.js processing is built with the programming language java and even though it is a sort of closed environment with a full drawing api and a lot of other sort of like core functionality and a lot of extended libraries you actually from within processing have access to anything java can do and java as a language i i don't know the right way to state this but it's kind of like the way that i think about it and i'll be curious to hear what you think is it's not the best language at anything but it's one of the best languages for everything like it's very hard to come up with something you can't do in java so it doesn't excel at any given thing but it just you can kind of do anything and it's crossplatform there's this whole job of virtual machine stuff there's a lot of complexity in terms of um and it is a little bit out of date and browsers don't support java applet anymore all of that aside i love i love the job jivin it loves me so um it's my first programming love everyone should feel about something like the way that i feel about java or maybe not i don't know if that's just weird i gotta hit stop here because it's bothering me that there's this error here is it still i don't know i don't know if i'm going to run this data collection while i'm doing this but all right so the reason why i'm getting excited here is if i go back to here i can look at this java robot class which is part of java.awt so i can actually say like if i just say robot robot processing is going to say like i don't know what that is the class robot does not exist but if i now say import java.awt.robot that error goes away now i can say setup and so the two the things that you could do with the robot class is to one you can track mouse well you can do a lot with it but what i'm interested in it for is it's it's a it's a tool for automation of different aspects of the sort of on the operating system level of what the use the user is doing so in relationship to the mouse i can know at any point where the mouse is now you might think that i can do that anyway in processing mouse x mouse y well no that's limiting the mouse interaction with this particular window same thing with p5 like i can know what the mouse is doing within a particular canvas or browser window but on from the operating system as a whole i need something else another layer and that's what the java robot class does in addition i can move the mouse around i can automate things if you've ever used like you know an uh an automator right i can actually have the mouse move according to logic and code so ideally what i want to do is track all of my mouse movements train a machine learning model i guess i could just use like a markov chain or something if i can't figure out how to do it with a neural network easily but um i can then have a machine learning model running to uh tell me where to move the map to not tell me to automate the control of the computer and that's what i would ultimately like to demonstrate and i do kind of want this to go away there we go um all right so let's let's look at the first steps and i i have working code that does this over here and i don't remember how to do it but um let's try to see if i can do it from the reference so first thing i need to do is make a robot object so i need to say robot equals new robot i'll do that in setup and let's run this code so here's a thing that will happen to you once you break out of processing and start using regular java it's like um sorry you there's there's a possible thing that could go wrong and you haven't told me what to do if that thing goes wrong i'm gonna need some more help here so and i really have to watch the time okay so processing usually will handle all sorts of errors for you behind the scenes and the way the library is written but often you have to be explicit so uh i'm gonna do a very sort of perfunctory job here and i can use a try catch statement and i can just catch any general exception uh in uh exception i'll call that e and i'm just gonna say print print line e and maybe i'll actually do a system.print.error so it'll show up in red is that not how you do it print line error i have no idea system.error printline i have no idea all right nevermind i don't know how to do that so i'm just going to say print line okay so not the best uh most comprehensive solution but um now i can run this sketch and i don't get an error the robot has been made so now the next thing i would like to do is let's look at what some of the functions are this moves the mouse mouse press this presses one or more of the buttons yeah and now mouse release i don't want this i want to know mouse wheel key press key release get pixel color get screen capture so you can do screen capture stuff with this so much you could do uh set auto delay delay wait for idle to string what am i missing here there's a thing that i'm doing to get the mouse points and i don't see it here um let's look at the methods wait for i i should have just been looking up here hmm instant no concrete let's look at my code since especially i'm out of time uh get number of buttons start robot robot track mouse oh yeah mouse oh it's um so this is actually just oh i don't even really need the robot for what i'm doing the robot is more to automate move stuff around maybe i need to i need mouse info because mouse info is a static class that can give me the pointer info okay interesting so actually what i'm looking for and i did java.awg.start so let's look at mouse info let's look at this so this is just for the data tracking java so i want to import this also and in let's just say let me just add a um an empty draw and let me add a mouse pressed so then i want to get in mouse info get pointer info and it's static so i want to say get pointer info and what does that give me back it gives me pointer info pointer info equals by the way welcome to the most longwinded esoteric programming language you could ever possibly use pointer info equals mouseinfo.getpointerinfo should be spelled with a zero i'm i'm imagining i guess i need uh import i mean i could just do dot star but i'm kind of curious to like figure out exactly what i'm using and then if i have a pointer info thingy i can look in this documentation and say get location which is a point and a point i'm assuming is also part of awt oh wait that's awt point how long till i just say awt star before i give up and say that so now uh print line point is i'm assuming there's just like an x in there and a y let's see yeah there we go now it's not registering it for other places but um i don't actually need to just get this i can but i can do this during draw now i should be able to say right as i move the mouse around anywhere on my desktop see how i'm getting the uh values there okay well that's that right so now this is what i'm going to do i am going to i'm going to show you kind of how i made this i am going to say a size so i'm going to do it i'm going to scale it down the same way i'm doing there so i'm going to make a variable called scale which i'm going to say let's do this all at a quarter scale and i also because i'm going to do some funny business with automating um the creation of the processing window itself system dot er dot print line system dot thank you system.org i didn't see that in the chat till just now so what i'm going to do here is i'm going to say if if you ever put variables into the size function and processing you need to move that into a function called settings otherwise you could just say size and setup so i'm going to say display width times scale display height times scale i guess i need to floor those because they have to be integers um okay so that should now if i run this right you can see it's the same i think i used using the same scale there then all i need to do is um let's put um background zero and then um i'm just going to say i'm going to do point previous i'm going to draw it as a line because that's what i'm doing up here previous equals point um and i will say if previous is not equal to null draw a line from point x point y to previous x previous y um and i need to multiply these by scale to scale it down and then stroke make it white so let's see i don't know if this is kind of work going to work but yeah so now as i move the mouse all around the larger window it's drawing the path scaled down and it doesn't matter like the processing window goes away it's doing this behind the scenes no matter what like here i'll put it away like i'm doing this doing this across the bottom scrolls girl scroll there you can see so that's a and the only thing that's different here is that i'm using some alpha so that it kind of builds up more over time just to be clear about this i could change this to you know 0.5 and now like you know i just scaled it down so this but the the thing that i really want to do is i want to save that data so i'm kind of running out of time so i think i would like to sort of like wrap up a bit um but i will just show you here um that in this particular example i've added a bunch of things but essentially i'm keep i made my own mousepoint class because i wanted to pair the time with the xy i'm not i don't know if i'm going to use the time but i thought uh i have it this is the only time i'll ever have the time i better save it and i'm not doing anything with clicks so um i want to i just create a mouse point which is in the x and y location along with the time and you can see this is ultimately the same thing like i have this p mouse and mouse objects and as long as um there i also like i skip it if it's like hasn't moved for a while maybe um and so just drawing that same thing with alpha the difference is um every 100 000 data points um i'm i basically i have this like arraylist history of all the mouse points and every time i track the mouse get that pointer info of the x and y and i didn't realize by the way i could just say point dot x point dot y and say get x and get y i make the new mouse point object with that x and y and the specific time stamp and then add it to that array that way in uh save data i just create a um i use the save strings function to essentially save x comma y comma time and if i go into um i save it as data mouse and then i also time stamp it as a csv file and you can see right now um the most recent one that i saved was at today at 11 45 a.m so it was 10 minutes ago if i actually click i think i force it to save if i click on it so now i just saved a new one at 11 58 and if i look at this in um where's my vs code um let me just open up visual studio code manually and i'm opening up a million digits of pi apparently if i open up i don't know where i saved this sketch robot demo no no no oh yeah it's in computer mouse mouse data collect this is this particular file from 11 58 am you can see it's just xy timestamp xy timestamp so i'm amassing all this data so i can make visualizations of it i've been working on a heat map visualization if anybody wants to help make some visualizations i'm happy to publish this data i could just stick it in a github repo again tweet me at shiffman is probably the best way or join the coding train discord um and ask one of the mods there um i can i can i just posted a link to the coding train discord in the chat hopefully i don't know if it if it popped up but maybe somebody's just the codingtrade.com discord um so i would love some sort of help i'm i'm like recording the video about all this stuff this weekend so you know if you want to make an interesting visualization i could maybe include it uh you know i don't want to i'm not i don't want to be taking advantage of them it's like generosity here so um but if it interests you i would welcome um any contributions um so what else do what i wanted to say about this um yeah let me before i go because it's noon and i need to wrap up i do really i haven't tested out what happened like some major issues i think i can't remember who it was somebody in the chat said watch out if you start writing software to take over your mouse how do you gain control back and actually now that i'm thinking about it oh well it's it's okay i've i've i'm gonna do all the things that i'm gonna do um i'm gonna work on my script um let's see let's go back to let's open here okay i can close this one let's go back to the robot class and i'm looking for mouse move move the mouse pointer to given screen coordinates okay let's see if i say uh x equals 100 y equals 100 then i'm going to in draw i'm going to um get rid of this tracking stuff for a second i'm going to say x plus equal random negative 100 100 y plus equal random negative 100 100 no no that's way too crazy 10 10 10 10 and then robot mouse move x y what could go wrong uh expect okay i need uh to convert these to integers this is a random a random mouse walk would like to control this computer using accessibility ah so i have to grant it control that's interesting uh let me just go over here just because i don't know what i'm revealing here allow the apps i'm gonna allow process what i'm just doing is i'm in the security and privacy um window and i'm clicking to allow processing control and we'll see if that does the trick i've already oh my god i have lost my mouse oh yeah it's doing it so i gave it control and you can see the mouse is up there in the corner stuck moving around can i hit escape okay good i can hit escape so let's go with um in setup i mean i would really like i should use one of my like steering behaviors examples or flocking behavior but let's do display with divided by two and display height divided by two let's make it uh move very very little and hopefully right now when i hit run it shouldn't just be in the center yeah there we go there's my mouse automate mood of moving [Laughter] this is like the least interesting um automate moving the mouse example that i could do let's um ah okay let's let's just because i want to have something slightly more interesting i could use perlin noise that actually would be a great one let's just do that let's just try purlin noise real quick um and then so this um x offset is zero y offset is zero and it's actually not really right so i'm not going to be using twodimensional noise it's fine just bear with me uh and now in draw float um x equals noise x x off times display with y equals noise y off display height and then i mean the x off just if you have no idea what i'm doing i would suggest my videos on pearl and noise let's see what happens now okay that's oh right right right right it's all on the diagonal because i need to look at different parts of the noise space here we go i have automated the movement of the mouse this is driving me crazy that there's this giant processing window that opens up um can i there's no no canvas but i can do size i think the minimum is probably this and i could alt tab now so i could go to the open like yeah there we go welcome to my automated mouse movie i never need to operate the computer again this is the end of today's live stream the grand finale so what i really would like to do is train a machine learning model to follow my mouse movements and then recreate them can i get some help with that we'll see how far i get but this does work and i can actually have it click also which is quite dangerous the good thing i'm doing right now is i'm not having a click so it just only is like pearl and noise random movements so now the question is how do i stop this if because i've hit escape i'm not in the processing ah and um abe is giving me a link to um people who have done kind of like auto clickers to beat various games and things there's so this could this could there's a really really quite far and i realized i was completely forgetting to use this mouse the whole time but look can i match it not really can i now i can use like servo motors in this so this moves automatically nice game for my cat says sav that's a great um a great um a great uh tip okay so um i'm done for today um thanks everybody for tuning in i hope this was interesting to you um i want to make sure i capture i i'm gonna have to like gain control back over my mouse oh what's actually really interesting is now i'm collecting oh my god stop stop stop everybody i love this hold on like you gain control over my mouse i can't get it back come on you can do it no there we go no not that one there this one escape okay this is what i'm gonna do now i just had the most wonderful idea i am going to run the data collection fresh and then move that up here and i know i've got a little bit this can come down it's going to be closed now let me run this code and now i'm collecting the data from the automated mouse moving yay because why not thank you oh i don't hear the sound anymore but i think i'm playing a very loud sound effect my headphone battery died okay it is 12 10 i have got to go my children have to be picked up from school at one o'clock um cannot the cat should be chasing the mouse there's so many metaphors here that i think could work thank you for tuning in i'm gonna put on some music get myself cleaned up here and out of here um i think maybe what i'll actually do though is just leave this running i'm going to oh wait i can you still use this mouse as my outro screen i'm just going to take away my camera so i'm gone now um and um i am going to put on some music and uh leave this running and i will see you all uh next hopefully next friday i'm trying to do live streams on friday for the next um foreseeable future and um please come and join um check out the computer mouse conference um someone could post a link to the computer mouse conference in the chat um there's i think there's probably ways you could participate or still watch the conference i'm not entirely sure but um yeah okay here we go back to uh my music and there we go as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop muting my mic but i'm still here i'm reading your chat messages this dot song never forget the this dot somebody composed that song for me i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward cartesian songs autotune and the internet will fix that for me take it with me coordinate song unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids kids the kittens the kids and kittens and kittens the kittens and kittens the kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effects that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens of dastada
