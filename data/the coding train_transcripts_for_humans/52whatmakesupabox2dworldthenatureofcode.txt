00:02 - all right so now we know hopefully we
00:04 - have box today we've downloaded we're up
00:06 - and running we need to answer this
00:07 - question how does it work anyway like
00:11 - what Scott what how does box duty work
00:12 - so let's first before we get there let's
00:14 - first think about how a regular ngon box
00:17 - 2d sketch works in processing ok so what
00:19 - does a processing sketch have it has set
00:21 - up and it has draw and in setup maybe
00:26 - you create all the objects in your world
00:29 - right you you create a bunch of objects
00:31 - create a bunch of objects and then what
00:37 - happened to draw every time every time
00:40 - the sketch cycles over and over and over
00:41 - again we calculate the motion of every
00:44 - object and then we draw every object so
00:46 - we calculate I'll say calculate the
00:50 - physics you know location and velocity
00:54 - velocity at acceleration apply force we
00:57 - do all the stuff with everything and
00:58 - then what do we do we draw everything so
01:04 - this is kind of how we've been writing
01:05 - our sketches what we're looking to do
01:08 - with box2d is replace this line with ask
01:15 - box 2d to calculate the physics right we
01:22 - still need to create everything and we
01:24 - still need to draw everything but we
01:25 - don't need to update all of their
01:27 - locations and do all that math box2d is
01:29 - going to do it we can think of box today
01:31 - essentially as this magic box right
01:35 - there's this magic box 2d right and what
01:40 - we do is we create a bunch of objects
01:42 - and set up and we put them in the magic
01:44 - box and then every time through magic
01:47 - every time through draw we say hey magic
01:49 - box where is everything where is
01:56 - everything
01:57 - it's very strange diagram here saying ok
01:59 - what we're gonna do is create everything
02:01 - put everything in the box we would say
02:03 - hey there's a whole bunch of squares and
02:06 - a whole bunch of rectangles and a bunch
02:07 - of triangles and they all start here and
02:10 - then go we back away slowly and
02:13 - just saying where is everything drawn on
02:15 - the screen where is everything drawn on
02:16 - the screen and we don't know how it's
02:17 - stuff is moving that's up to box2d
02:20 - it's taking care of that so the good
02:22 - news about a scenario like this is we
02:25 - don't have to do all of that physics
02:26 - math our code and figure it out and
02:27 - debug it it's all done for us the bad
02:30 - news about a scenario like this is we
02:32 - lose a lot of control here we are just
02:35 - kind of just saying draw everything draw
02:37 - everything and I'm sure you're doing it
02:38 - correctly thank you very much and mostly
02:40 - and and and so this is a good some
02:42 - projects this is perfect for other
02:45 - projects this is not so perfect for and
02:46 - this is the question you're gonna have
02:48 - to ask yourself when you're kind of
02:49 - figuring out what tool to use to create
02:50 - what you're creating but so this so this
02:55 - is the overall structure and we're gonna
02:57 - we're gonna see how this works
02:58 - in an actual code example in the next
03:00 - video I'm not timing destitute but in
03:04 - this video I have a couple more things
03:05 - that I want to talk about one is what
03:09 - goes in this magic box so this is kind
03:11 - of key what goes in this magic box so
03:14 - let's erase all this over here and let's
03:17 - talk about what are the central elements
03:20 - of box D what are the things we're going
03:22 - to have to learn about to use box 2d so
03:25 - box 2d has a bunch of elements number
03:27 - one there's something called a world
03:28 - number two there's something called the
03:30 - body number three there's something
03:33 - called a shape well number four there's
03:35 - something called a fixture and number
03:39 - five there is something called a joint
03:42 - so these are the central elements of
03:45 - box2d these are the kinds of objects
03:47 - that we're going to make we're going to
03:49 - make bodies we're going to make shapes
03:50 - we're gonna make fixtures we're gonna
03:51 - make joints and we're gonna put all
03:53 - those things in the magic box and then
03:55 - we're just gonna ask where is everything
03:57 - we would like to draw it with our own
03:59 - special colors and design and images etc
04:01 - so the key that we're okay so the world
04:05 - first of all we should kind of leave
04:06 - world up here world is the world the
04:09 - world is this magic box so that's the
04:12 - world we need to the first thing we're
04:14 - going to do in a box through the example
04:15 - is create that world
04:16 - the second thing we're gonna do in a box
04:18 - to the example is start to put bodies in
04:20 - that world the body is the central
04:22 - element that moves around the screen it
04:24 - is the thing that has the physics
04:27 - has the physics that can something have
04:29 - the physics anyway it's it's the sort of
04:31 - central element the interesting thing
04:32 - about a body is it it is nothing it's
04:35 - nothing it's emptiness it's just like
04:37 - this empty points that's moving
04:40 - throughout the screen a shape is what
04:43 - actually has geometry and a shape is
04:46 - what gets attached to a body so if we
04:48 - look at a window the body is this point
04:52 - that's going to move around and it's
04:53 - going to have a velocity a shape is
04:56 - going to be the actual thing you know
04:58 - our little Angry Bird here I don't know
05:00 - what I'm drawing I can't believe I'm
05:02 - doing this that's and it added to skip
05:06 - something fixed whatever okay so the
05:08 - shape is the thing with geometry that's
05:10 - the actual shape is it a rectangle is it
05:12 - a polygon is it a circle that's the
05:14 - thing we're going to attach to our body
05:16 - how are we going to attach it to our
05:17 - body with a fixture so you can start to
05:21 - imagine here that you can see how using
05:23 - box2d even though we have this magic
05:25 - thing right oh it's gonna be so easy we
05:26 - just set up things in the world then we
05:28 - ask where is everything where you draw
05:30 - it it's gonna be so easy it's not so
05:32 - easy because we got to make bodies then
05:34 - we got to make shapes and we got to make
05:35 - fixtures and we got to do all this stuff
05:37 - so this is when we get to the code
05:39 - example which we're very slowly inching
05:41 - our way to in the next video there's a
05:43 - lot of details we're gonna have to work
05:45 - out and and most of this we can copy
05:47 - paste and just sort of look up we don't
05:49 - have to memorize it so to speak but it
05:51 - isn't so easy so the body is the is the
05:53 - thing that's the mover this is the
05:55 - equivalent to the mover class that we've
05:57 - been making all along the difference is
05:59 - now our movers didn't have geometry sure
06:02 - we drew something on the screen but
06:03 - there was no collisions so we have to
06:05 - start worrying about geometry which we
06:06 - have to define shapes that are attached
06:08 - to bodies with fixtures joints by the
06:10 - way we're gonna start to look at later
06:12 - towards the end of this section of
06:14 - videos a joint is something that
06:16 - connects two bodies so when we think
06:18 - about the pendulums we made we could are
06:20 - the springs we might have a body and a
06:23 - body connected with a joint that could
06:26 - be like a revolution joint it could be a
06:28 - spring joint there's a bunch of
06:30 - different kinds of joints we could look
06:32 - at in box2d okay so this is the overall
06:37 - picture and
06:40 - think okay so I think that's pretty good
06:42 - for right now
06:43 - what I would suggest to you what I would
06:45 - do as your exercise here before the next
06:48 - video is get make a basic processing
06:51 - sketch make an object that has a
06:54 - location and a size maybe it's a square
06:57 - maybe it's a circle and make an
07:00 - ArrayList of those objects and just
07:01 - stick a whole bunch randomly on the
07:03 - screen or wherever you click the mouse
07:04 - add objects so make a sketch with no
07:06 - physics it's just going to be a sketch
07:09 - and I'll show you an example of this
07:11 - make a sketch that's like this that I
07:14 - can just add objects to and they don't
07:15 - do anything what we need to do in the
07:17 - next video is actually take a sketch
07:19 - like this and stick box2d in it say like
07:22 - okay instead of just these objects that
07:24 - are drawn on the screen we we now want
07:26 - to have those objects move according to
07:28 - the physics of box2d and Bach City is
07:30 - just gonna tell us where they are and
07:31 - what their rotation is and we're gonna
07:33 - draw according to what box2d tells us
07:35 - that's what we're gonna get through in
07:36 - the next video okay any questions I'm
07:40 - sure you have many okay so I'm gonna
07:43 - click this and I'll see you in the next
07:45 - video

Cleaned transcript:

all right so now we know hopefully we have box today we've downloaded we're up and running we need to answer this question how does it work anyway like what Scott what how does box duty work so let's first before we get there let's first think about how a regular ngon box 2d sketch works in processing ok so what does a processing sketch have it has set up and it has draw and in setup maybe you create all the objects in your world right you you create a bunch of objects create a bunch of objects and then what happened to draw every time every time the sketch cycles over and over and over again we calculate the motion of every object and then we draw every object so we calculate I'll say calculate the physics you know location and velocity velocity at acceleration apply force we do all the stuff with everything and then what do we do we draw everything so this is kind of how we've been writing our sketches what we're looking to do with box2d is replace this line with ask box 2d to calculate the physics right we still need to create everything and we still need to draw everything but we don't need to update all of their locations and do all that math box2d is going to do it we can think of box today essentially as this magic box right there's this magic box 2d right and what we do is we create a bunch of objects and set up and we put them in the magic box and then every time through magic every time through draw we say hey magic box where is everything where is everything it's very strange diagram here saying ok what we're gonna do is create everything put everything in the box we would say hey there's a whole bunch of squares and a whole bunch of rectangles and a bunch of triangles and they all start here and then go we back away slowly and just saying where is everything drawn on the screen where is everything drawn on the screen and we don't know how it's stuff is moving that's up to box2d it's taking care of that so the good news about a scenario like this is we don't have to do all of that physics math our code and figure it out and debug it it's all done for us the bad news about a scenario like this is we lose a lot of control here we are just kind of just saying draw everything draw everything and I'm sure you're doing it correctly thank you very much and mostly and and and so this is a good some projects this is perfect for other projects this is not so perfect for and this is the question you're gonna have to ask yourself when you're kind of figuring out what tool to use to create what you're creating but so this so this is the overall structure and we're gonna we're gonna see how this works in an actual code example in the next video I'm not timing destitute but in this video I have a couple more things that I want to talk about one is what goes in this magic box so this is kind of key what goes in this magic box so let's erase all this over here and let's talk about what are the central elements of box D what are the

just gonna ask where is everything we would like to draw it with our own special colors and design and images etc so the key that we're okay so the world first of all we should kind of leave world up here world is the world the world is this magic box so that's the world we need to the first thing we're going to do in a box through the example is create that world the second thing we're gonna do in a box to the example is start to put bodies in that world the body is the central element that moves around the screen it is the thing that has the physics has the physics that can something have the physics anyway it's it's the sort of central element the interesting thing about a body is it it is nothing it's nothing it's emptiness it's just like this empty points that's moving throughout

okay so the shape is the thing with geometry that's the actual shape is it a rectangle is it a polygon is it a circle that's the thing we're going to attach to our body how are we going to attach it to our body with a fixture so you can start to imagine here that you can see how using box2d even though we have this magic thing right oh it's gonna be so easy we just set up things in the world then we ask where is everything where you draw it it's gonna be so easy it's not so easy because we got to make bodies then we got to make shapes and we got to make fixtures and we got to do all this stuff so this is when we get to the code example which we're very slowly inching our way to in the next video there's a lot of details we're gonna have to work out and and most of this we can copy paste and just sort of look up we don't have to memorize it so to speak but it isn't so easy so the body is the is the thing that's the mover this is the equivalent to the mover class that we've been making all
