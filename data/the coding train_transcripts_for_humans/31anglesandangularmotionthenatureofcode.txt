00:02 - oscillation this is the topic now that
00:04 - we're going to look at in this section
00:06 - of videos part three it's math it maps
00:09 - to if you're following along in the
00:10 - nature of codebook chapter 3 we're going
00:12 - to look at oscillating motion what does
00:14 - it mean to have something that moves
00:16 - with a period with a frequency swinging
00:19 - of a pendulum the bouncing of a spring
00:22 - the plucking of a guitar string the the
00:24 - waves of water what types of things can
00:26 - we model in nature with oscillating
00:28 - motion and we can see a nice example of
00:30 - this this array of pendulums this is
00:32 - something about that by the end of this
00:33 - section of videos you could model
00:35 - in-processing we're actually going to
00:37 - look specifically at how to model a
00:39 - pendulum and then you could make an
00:40 - array of them all starting at different
00:42 - times and this might be an exercise you
00:43 - could think about doing at the end of
00:45 - this section of videos but so before we
00:48 - could do any of that
00:49 - okay so oscillating motion waves
00:53 - pendulum Springs that's what we're
00:54 - talking about but to be able to really
00:56 - do this stuff and actually to a really
01:00 - important topic that we need to have in
01:02 - our bag of tricks when doing computer
01:05 - graphics programming is we need to know
01:08 - something about trigonometry what is
01:09 - trigonometry well this is a right
01:15 - triangle a right triangle has sides
01:17 - right side side side it has angles the
01:22 - relation to study of the relationship
01:25 - between the angles and sides of a right
01:27 - triangle that's trigonometry and we need
01:30 - trigonometry to do lots of stuff on the
01:33 - screen we need to know about sine cosine
01:35 - tangent and it's also going to allow us
01:36 - to do some nice stuff related to
01:39 - oscillating motion figuring out angular
01:42 - motion angular forces in terms of
01:46 - looking at a pendulum so trigonometry we
01:48 - need to we need somewhere to talk about
01:50 - trigonometry this is the place this is
01:52 - the time before we can even talk about
01:54 - trigonometry which will really be in the
01:55 - next video though I just want to think
01:57 - about basics of angles and processing
01:59 - how do we rotate something based on an
02:02 - angle and how might we model angular
02:04 - motion could angle be a position could
02:07 - there be an angular velocity in an
02:09 - angular acceleration that's what I want
02:10 - to look at just in this first video to
02:12 - get
02:13 - kind of started here so you're probably
02:14 - familiar with angles right here is a
02:18 - 90-degree angle here is a 45-degree
02:21 - angle you know I'm guessing if you're
02:24 - found your way to these videos you've
02:26 - probably done some stuff in processing
02:27 - and realize that processing in most
02:29 - computer graphics environments look at
02:31 - angles in radians right 90 degrees is PI
02:34 - divided by 2 radians 45 degrees would be
02:37 - PI divided by 4 a full 360 degrees is 2
02:41 - pi so I you know I want to just take a
02:44 - brief 30 seconds here and cover what is
02:47 - a radiant it's kind of like it might be
02:49 - a little mysterious to you well the
02:51 - thing about a Radian actually is it's
02:52 - quite simple if you have a circle with
02:55 - radius equal to one one Radian and I'm
03:01 - not sure if I'm drawing this to scale
03:03 - one Radian is the angle at which the
03:06 - length of this arc is also equal to 1
03:09 - incidentally with a circle of radius 1
03:13 - the in the length of the entire contour
03:16 - the circumference of that circle is 2 pi
03:18 - so pi is this magical number that just
03:21 - kind of appears beautifully out of the
03:23 - circumference of a circle and we get and
03:26 - in radians are this very convenient
03:29 - convenient unit of measurement for
03:30 - angles it's not perhaps not as intuitive
03:33 - to us because we're used to thinking in
03:34 - degrees but the more you program the
03:36 - more your brain will reverse itself to
03:38 - thinking about radians ok so that's what
03:41 - we've got angles and radians hey that's
03:43 - pretty good so we should be able to
03:45 - rotate something right if I if this is a
03:48 - rectangle if I want to rotate this
03:50 - rectangle by 45 degrees or PI divided by
03:55 - 4 radians I should be able to get this
03:59 - rectangle now this is not a lesson in 2d
04:05 - transformations to do this rotation
04:07 - you're going to need translate you might
04:09 - need push matrix and pop matrix to
04:11 - figure out a lot of this stuff we're
04:12 - going to incorporate that into our code
04:14 - let me briefly say that if 2d
04:17 - transformations are not familiar to you
04:19 - what you probably should look at is
04:23 - processing org learning
04:26 - scroll down I would suggest looking at
04:28 - this particular tutorial I'm standing in
04:30 - front of it
04:31 - 2d transformations so this will get you
04:34 - it go pause go look at this tutorial if
04:37 - transformations are not familiar to you
04:39 - but so what we need to do to make this
04:43 - happen is translate to the object's
04:45 - location rotate by that angle and then
04:48 - draw the object okay
04:50 - so let's actually make that happen in a
04:52 - processing sketch and we're we're going
04:53 - to talk this I think it could be a short
04:55 - video I'm excited we're going to talk
04:56 - just about looking at angular motion
04:59 - velocity and acceleration okay so let's
05:03 - come back over here let's open up this
05:05 - processing sketch so I have this premade
05:06 - processing sketch which just draws a
05:09 - rectangle in the center right so this is
05:12 - the thing we're talking about with
05:13 - transformations you might think oh I
05:14 - know I'm just going to type in rotate
05:17 - here and say pi divided by 4 and now run
05:20 - it again and what's going on here it's
05:22 - like down on the bottom it's not in the
05:24 - center it is sort of rotated so what
05:25 - happened is rotation always happens
05:27 - around the point of origin so we rotated
05:30 - that search square around I can't do it
05:33 - around the origin up there we want to
05:35 - rotate that square around its center to
05:37 - move the origin to the center
05:39 - we need to use translate so I'm going to
05:41 - say hey translate to width divided by 2
05:44 - height divided by 2 and then and then
05:48 - rotate by that angle and draw the
05:50 - rectangle at 0 0 and now we see we have
05:54 - a rectangle rotated 45 degrees exciting
05:58 - okay remember we there's probably about
06:01 - 10 15 videos about motion position
06:05 - velocity acceleration velocity is the
06:08 - change in position over time
06:10 - acceleration is the change in velocity
06:12 - over time well an angle is in many ways
06:16 - a position it's the angular position of
06:19 - that square now interestingly this is
06:22 - actually simpler to deal with because an
06:23 - angle is a scalar quantity it's a single
06:26 - number it's not a vector but we can
06:29 - apply we can have one variable to be the
06:31 - angle another available to be the
06:33 - angular velocity and another variable to
06:35 - be the angular acceleration so let's
06:36 - take a look at that what if I at the top
06:39 - here say
06:40 - a is some angle the angular velocity is
06:47 - some amount and the angular acceleration
06:51 - is some amount now what are the rules of
06:55 - motion velocity changes position
07:03 - acceleration changes velocity this is
07:07 - exactly what we did in our update
07:09 - function in our movers logan velocity
07:13 - add acceleration but we're just doing it
07:15 - here with angular and with with we're
07:17 - just doing it here with angular's with
07:18 - angles let's run this sketch nothing
07:22 - happens but of course if we actually put
07:24 - in we say hey let's give ourselves a
07:26 - little acceleration we can see okay come
07:30 - on that's a very small acceleration
07:31 - right is it turning what's going on here
07:36 - lost my mind ah
07:39 - you know what would be nice it would be
07:41 - nice to put the variable in here okay so
07:44 - that was a little bit of a mistake you
07:47 - know I had PI over 4 in there still but
07:49 - now we've got a back in there we say ok
07:50 - so that was not such a tiny little
07:52 - acceleration you can see how quickly
07:54 - acceleration adds up in terms of
07:56 - rotating by radians but you can see here
07:58 - we go we're getting faster and faster
08:00 - and faster we could use constrain to put
08:02 - a cap on velocity lots of things we
08:04 - could do we could also just really
08:06 - quickly right now just to kind of polish
08:08 - off this example I could say hey let me
08:11 - actually calculate the acceleration on
08:14 - the fly by mapping Mouse X which goes
08:17 - between zero and width to a number
08:20 - between negative 0.01 and 0.01 let me
08:26 - add if some extra zeros in here to make
08:27 - it smaller let me run this and we can
08:30 - see here now if I stay in the center
08:33 - there no acceleration if I go this way
08:36 - we're going to start going that way if I
08:38 - come over here it's going to slow down
08:40 - stop and come back so you can see how
08:44 - I'm modeling the motion the rotational
08:47 - the angular motion of an object the same
08:49 - way we modeled linear motion throughout
08:51 - Cartesian space angle is
08:54 - angular velocities velocity angular
08:56 - accelerations acceleration so you might
08:59 - sort of wonder how would we then apply
09:01 - this to to one of our previous examples
09:06 - and I think it's worth just pulling one
09:09 - up if I grab this example if you recall
09:12 - which is which was our a track array of
09:16 - of movers that are attracted to a
09:18 - singular attractor in the center what if
09:20 - you wanted to give these objects a
09:21 - little bit of angular motion well if we
09:24 - go look at the class we can see we have
09:26 - location velocity and acceleration each
09:29 - object has those three variables to keep
09:31 - track of its motion throughout this
09:32 - Cartesian space so what if I just went
09:35 - back to this example we did and grabbed
09:38 - these three variables let's give this
09:42 - object now in addition to having the
09:46 - vectors for its motion throughout space
09:48 - we have three angle three three scalars
09:51 - for its angular motion and I could go
09:53 - and I could just I could go to its
09:56 - display function and I could add the
09:58 - transformation code we need to so that
10:01 - we can rotate the object and we're going
10:06 - to now once we've translated to where
10:08 - the object is we've got to draw it at
10:11 - zero and notice the use of push matrix
10:15 - and pop matrix in this object this
10:17 - object is going to perform a
10:18 - transformation so that it is at a
10:20 - location and wrote and rotated we want
10:23 - it not to affect any of the other
10:24 - objects it just needs to translate and
10:26 - rotate for itself so we say push to save
10:28 - this transformation state do all our
10:30 - weird translation rotation say pop to
10:32 - restore so this object is kind of has
10:34 - its own transformation state okay now
10:37 - that we've done that so much for short
10:39 - video over ten minutes now that we've
10:41 - done that we can run this and see what
10:43 - it looks like okay so one thing is
10:45 - circles and not so much you don't really
10:48 - see the rotation so much so let's let's
10:51 - let's change these two rectangles and
10:54 - let's say rect mode Center let's run
10:59 - this we can see we've got rectangles
11:00 - there of course we didn't at we didn't
11:02 - add the angular motion to our sketch we
11:04 - need to go and say what's that motion
11:06 - algorithm for angles it's this
11:09 - so now in our update function just in
11:14 - the way that we add acceleration
11:15 - velocity velocity location we need to do
11:17 - that with with our angles velocity - the
11:19 - angle angular acceleration - the angular
11:21 - velocity we're now doing that both with
11:23 - the objects angle and with its and with
11:26 - its a position so if we run this now we
11:31 - can see they're all spinning now here's
11:33 - the question though how should they spin
11:36 - and there's lots of ways and simulation
11:39 - ways we can kind of get it we could get
11:40 - further into this but what I want to
11:42 - just say here for the second for the
11:43 - moment is what if we just did something
11:46 - simple and just said let's calculate its
11:50 - angular acceleration according to its
11:54 - acceleration along the x axis and I'm
11:57 - going to divide it by 10 so you can see
12:01 - here we're get something that appears
12:02 - somewhat dynamic that the that the
12:05 - annular the way that it's rotating is
12:07 - related to how it accelerates
12:09 - horizontally now that is a completely
12:11 - arbitrary choice but you might try and
12:14 - as an exercise you might try to build
12:15 - this in such a way that can you get it
12:17 - to appear realistically like as if it's
12:19 - sort of spinning throughout space and as
12:21 - it slows down it spins back the other
12:23 - way what happens if you use Y what m/s
12:25 - you've used the magnitude of the vector
12:27 - the angle of the vector there's lots of
12:28 - things that you could map to that
12:30 - object's acceleration you could also
12:33 - think about forces if there was a wind
12:35 - force with that wind force the hore
12:37 - affect its rotation in some such a way I
12:40 - don't know that there be wind in this
12:42 - example but you can sort of see where
12:43 - this is going so this this video all we
12:47 - really did all I want from this video
12:49 - hopefully it worked was to kind of get a
12:51 - sense of right what is an angle angles
12:54 - can be used in an object's rotation and
12:56 - angular motion the same way we modeled
12:58 - motion in throughout space
12:59 - two-dimensional space we can that same
13:02 - concepts we can we can use through with
13:05 - an angle with angle s position angular
13:07 - velocity and angular acceleration okay
13:09 - and in the next video what we're going
13:11 - to look at is actually start to
13:13 - understand a sort of look at the details
13:16 - behind trigonometry what does it mean
13:17 - then to take the sine of an angle the
13:19 - cosine of an angle the tangent angle and
13:21 - how might that affect some of these
13:22 - systems that we build okay there we go
13:27 - that's it for now

Cleaned transcript:

oscillation this is the topic now that we're going to look at in this section of videos part three it's math it maps to if you're following along in the nature of codebook chapter 3 we're going to look at oscillating motion what does it mean to have something that moves with a period with a frequency swinging of a pendulum the bouncing of a spring the plucking of a guitar string the the waves of water what types of things can we model in nature with oscillating motion and we can see a nice example of this this array of pendulums this is something about that by the end of this section of videos you could model inprocessing we're actually going to look specifically at how to model a pendulum and then you could make an array of them all starting at different times and this might be an exercise you could think about doing at the end of this section of videos but so before we could do any of that okay so oscillating motion waves pendulum Springs that's what we're talking about but to be able to really do this stuff and actually to a really important topic that we need to have in our bag of tricks when doing computer graphics programming is we need to know something about trigonometry what is trigonometry well this is a right triangle a right triangle has sides right side side side it has angles the relation to study of the relationship between the angles and sides of a right triangle that's trigonometry and we need trigonometry to do lots of stuff on the screen we need to know about sine cosine tangent and it's also going to allow us to do some nice stuff related to oscillating motion figuring out angular motion angular forces in terms of looking at a pendulum so trigonometry we need to we need somewhere to talk about trigonometry this is the place this is the time before we can even talk about trigonometry which will really be in the next video though I just want to think about basics of angles and processing how do we rotate something based on an angle and how might we model angular motion could angle be a position could there be an angular velocity in an angular acceleration that's what I want to look at just in this first video to get kind of started here so you're probably familiar with angles right here is a 90degree angle here is a 45degree angle you know I'm guessing if you're found your way to these videos you've probably done some stuff in processing and realize that processing in most computer graphics environments look at angles in radians right 90 degrees is PI divided by 2 radians 45 degrees would be PI divided by 4 a full 360 degrees is 2 pi so I you know I want to just take a brief 30 seconds here and cover what is a radiant it's kind of like it might be a little mysterious to you well the thing about a Radian actually is it's quite simple if you have a circle with radius equal to one one Radian and I'm not sure if I'm drawing this to scale one Radian is the angle at which the length of this arc is also equal to 1 incidentally with a circle of radius 1 the in the length of the entire contour the circumference of that circle is 2 pi so pi is this magical number that just kind of appears beautifully out of the circumference of a circle and we get and in radians are this very convenient convenient unit of measurement for angles it's not perhaps not as intuitive to us because we're used to thinking in degrees but the more you program the more your brain will reverse itself to thinking about radians ok so that's what we've got angles and radians hey that's pretty good so we should be able to rotate something right if I if this is a rectangle if I want to rotate this rectangle by 45 degrees or PI divided by 4 radians I should be able to get this rectangle now this is not a lesson in 2d transformations to do this rotation you're going to need translate you might need push matrix and pop matrix to figure out a lot of this stuff we're going to incorporate that into our code let me briefly say that if 2d transformations are not familiar to you what you probably should look at is processing org learning scroll down I would suggest looking at this particular tutorial I'm standing in front of it 2d transformations so this will get you it go pause go look at this tutorial if transformations are not familiar to you but so what we need to do to make this happen is translate to the object's location rotate by that angle and then draw the object okay so let's actually make that happen in a processing sketch and we're we're going to talk this I think it could be a short video I'm excited we're going to talk just about looking at angular motion velocity and acceleration okay so let's come back over here let's open up this processing sketch so I have this premade processing sketch which just draws a rectangle in the center right so this is the thing we're talking about with transformations you might think oh I know I'm just going to type in rotate here and say pi divided by 4 and now run it again and what's going on here it's like down on the bottom it's not in the center it is sort of rotated so what happened is rotation always happens around the point of origin so we rotated that search square around I can't do it around the origin up there we want to rotate that square around its center to move the origin to the center we need to use translate so I'm going to say hey translate to width divided by 2 height divided by 2 and then and then rotate by that angle and draw the rectangle at 0 0 and now we see we have a rectangle rotated 45 degrees exciting okay remember we there's probably about 10 15 videos about motion position velocity acceleration velocity is the change in position over time acceleration is the change in velocity over time well an angle is in many ways a position it's the angular position of that square now interestingly this is actually simpler to deal with because an angle is a scalar quantity it's a single number it's not a vector but we can apply we can have one variable to be the angle another available to be the angular velocity and another variable to be the angular acceleration so let's take a look at that what if I at the top here say a is some angle the angular velocity is some amount and the angular acceleration is some amount now what are the rules of motion velocity changes position acceleration changes velocity this is exactly what we did in our update function in our movers logan velocity add acceleration but we're just doing it here with angular and with with we're just doing it here with angular's with angles let's run this sketch nothing happens but of course if we actually put in we say hey let's give ourselves a little acceleration we can see okay come on that's a very small acceleration right is it turning what's going on here lost my mind ah you know what would be nice it would be nice to put the variable in here okay so that was a little bit of a mistake you know I had PI over 4 in there still but now we've got a back in there we say ok so that was not such a tiny little acceleration you can see how quickly acceleration adds up in terms of rotating by radians but you can see here we go we're getting faster and faster and faster we could use constrain to put a cap on velocity lots of things we could do we could also just really quickly right now just to kind of polish off this example I could say hey let me actually calculate the acceleration on the fly by mapping Mouse X which goes between zero and width to a number between negative 0.01 and 0.01 let me add if some extra zeros in here to make it smaller let me run this and we can see here now if I stay in the center there no acceleration if I go this way we're going to start going that way if I come over here it's going to slow down stop and come back so you can see how I'm modeling the motion the rotational the angular motion of an object the same way we modeled linear motion throughout Cartesian space angle is angular velocities velocity angular accelerations acceleration so you might sort of wonder how would we then apply this to to one of our previous examples and I think it's worth just pulling one up if I grab this example if you recall which is which was our a track array of of movers that are attracted to a singular attractor in the center what if you wanted to give these objects a little bit of

so what if I just went back to this example we did and grabbed these three variables let's give this object now in addition to having the vectors for its motion throughout space we have three angle three three scalars for its angular motion and I could go and I could just I could go to its display function and I could add the transformation code we need to so that we can rotate the object and we're going to now once we've translated to where the object is we've got to draw it at zero and notice the use of push matrix and pop matrix in this object this object is going to perform a transformation so that it is at a location and wrote and rotated we want it not to affect any of the other objects it just needs to translate and rotate for itself so we say push to save this transformation state do all our weird translation rotation say pop to restore so this object is kind of has its own transformation state okay now that we've done that so much for short video over ten minutes now that we've done that we can run this and see what it looks like okay so one thing is circles and not so much you don't really see the rotation so much so let's let's let's change these two rectangles and let's say rect mode Center let's run this we can see we've got rectangles there of course we didn't at we didn't add the angular motion to our sketch we need to go and say what's that motion algorithm for angles it's this so now in our update function just in the way that we add acceleration velocity velocity location we need to do that with with our angles velocity the angle angular acceleration the angular velocity we're now doing that both with the objects angle and with its and with its a position so if we run this now we can see they're all spinning now here's the question though how should they spin and there's lots of ways and simulation ways we can kind of get it we could get further into this but what I want to just say here for the second for the moment is what if we just did something simple and just said let's calculate its angular acceleration according to its acceleration along the x axis and I'm going to divide it by 10 so you can see here we're get something that appears somewhat dynamic that the that the annular the way that it's rotating is related to how it accelerates horizontally now that is a completely arbitrary choice but you might try and as an exercise you might try to build this in such a way that can you get it to appear realistically like as if it's sort of spinning throughout space and as it slows down it spins back the other way what happens if you use Y what m/s you've used the magnitude of the vector the angle of the vector there's lots of things that you could map to that object's acceleration you could also think about forces if there was a wind force with that wind force the hore affect its rotation in some such a way I don't know that there be wind in this example but you can sort of see where this is going so this this video all we really did all I want from this video hopefully it worked was to kind of get a sense of right what is an angle angles can be used in an object's rotation and angular motion the same way we modeled motion in throughout space twodimensional space we can that same concepts we can we can use through with an angle with angle s position angular velocity and angular acceleration okay and in the next video what we're going to look at is actually start to understand a sort of look at the details behind trigonometry what does it mean then to take the sine of an angle the cosine of an angle the tangent angle and how might that affect some of these systems that we build okay there we go that's it for now
