With timestamps:

00:01 - hello good afternoon good morning good
00:05 - evening uh this is the coding train with
00:08 - me Daniel oh I said Daniel sometimes I
00:11 - say Dan sometimes I say Daniel every
00:13 - once in a while somebody calls me Danny
00:15 - which I always kind of enjoy although
00:16 - that's never really been my name um it's
00:18 - a Thursday afternoon it is May it's May
00:21 - right uh May 25th it's around 4:20 p.m.
00:26 - eastern time I am live from New York
00:28 - City on the coding train
00:30 - and um this is a semiweekly sometimes
00:34 - whenever I have some time uh show thing
00:37 - stream internet television education
00:41 - space type thing where I uh do some
00:44 - coding tutorials and coding challenges
00:46 - and answer questions and a variety of
00:49 - other things that I end up feeling like
00:52 - doing while broadcasting Live on YouTube
00:54 - so welcome thank you for tuning in
00:57 - uh I am playing some lovely music by the
01:00 - great Adam Blau in the background I
01:01 - think I will fade it out now um as you
01:04 - know I enjoy having uh music sometimes
01:07 - in the background so if you have any
01:08 - suggestions or things that you're
01:09 - working on that you want to send my way
01:12 - uh please do okay so what's going to
01:13 - happen today um looks like um everybody
01:18 - is here and I'm not seeing any
01:19 - complaints about sound or visuals um so
01:24 - I am going to return today to my machine
01:28 - learning I don't I'm I'm trying to avoid
01:30 - using the word
01:32 - syllabus I feel like syllabus and
01:34 - YouTube do not go together let me try a
01:37 - different word I'm going to return to my
01:40 - machine learning list silly bus would
01:43 - actually work quite well s i l l ybos my
01:46 - machine learning Silly Bus um and uh
01:50 - let's let me figure out where I left
01:53 - off uh this course lended many weeks ago
01:58 - but I'm still trying to make video
01:59 - materials for it uh and I'm I think I'm
02:02 - here in uh week
02:04 - three so um the topic that I have for
02:08 - today
02:15 - is linear regression uh so um for those
02:20 - of you who are watching this late at
02:22 - night perhaps you're curled up with some
02:24 - candle light and some herbal tea and you
02:26 - have a nice book beside you and you're
02:28 - playing some soothing classical music
02:29 - music this will also put you to sleep
02:32 - almost definitely um but um what I want
02:35 - to do today is look at everything that
02:38 - I'm doing is leading up to uh building a
02:43 - neural network program from scratch in
02:46 - JavaScript and in processing which is
02:47 - Java one of these environments and so a
02:50 - I have some steps along the way that I
02:52 - want to do so um previously I looked at
02:55 - just kind of a overview of what machine
02:57 - learning is we looked at uh K near
03:00 - neighbor algorithm and how to do a
03:02 - similarity score between two data points
03:04 - and today I want to look at this idea of
03:06 - I have a data set and I want to fit a
03:09 - model what does it mean to fit a model
03:11 - to the data set for us for today that
03:14 - model is going to be a straight line and
03:17 - we're going to be able to calculate that
03:18 - model calculate where we should draw
03:21 - that straight line with
03:24 - maths um yes I'm an American who likes
03:27 - to say maths I don't know if that makes
03:28 - me pretentious or the opposite of
03:31 - pretentious but that's just who I am um
03:35 - so uh emra in the chat asks why
03:39 - JavaScript for a neural network uh I
03:41 - don't have a good reason for that in
03:42 - fact it's a terrible idea to program a
03:45 - neural network in JavaScript but I'm
03:47 - going to do that anyway because I like
03:48 - to run Demos in the browser and kind of
03:50 - get my hands in the code and JavaScript
03:52 - is a language that I am kind of working
03:53 - with I will however I do intend to do
03:57 - some tutorials as we dig down further if
04:00 - I keep going on my silly bus um that
04:03 - eventually I'm going to start once uh
04:05 - I'm going to start looking at uh
04:07 - something called tensorflow and
04:08 - something called Caris and those will
04:10 - require us to spin up some python code
04:13 - that I will then talk to from JavaScript
04:15 - and actually I guess my reason is one of
04:17 - the things that I'm trying to do is
04:19 - always have a visual uh animated or
04:22 - interactive component to what it is that
04:24 - I'm building um and and that's just sort
04:27 - of arbitrary constraint that I give
04:28 - myself in the hopes that people will
04:29 - take that and make all sorts of more
04:31 - creative and beautiful and interesting
04:33 - things from it okay um okay sing the
04:38 - audio by the way I I get this me I get
04:40 - this a lot my audio is out of sync so
04:43 - for whatever reason I think when the
04:45 - audio is out of sync it's not me it's
04:48 - you or it is me can I I'm trying to thow
04:52 - I can't throw I'm trying to throw my
04:53 - voice in a way that I could maybe make
04:55 - the Audio I can't do it audio out of
04:58 - think um and I hear that if you refresh
05:01 - the page sometimes that fixes it the
05:02 - good news is I am recording everything
05:04 - I'm doing to disk and um everything that
05:07 - I do today will be published separately
05:09 - as individual video tutorial chunks okay
05:11 - so uh the coding train is brought to you
05:14 - by wait a sec do I have it's not brought
05:17 - to you by anything brought to you by me
05:19 - but it is here with the support of the
05:21 - patrons so I would like to start by
05:23 - saying a thank you to the patrons of the
05:25 - coding train if you would like to join
05:27 - the patron program you can go to patreon
05:29 - com/ coding Trin and uh you can uh with
05:34 - a uh you can pledge and uh um with a
05:37 - pledge comes membership to a slack
05:39 - Channel and other rewards they'll send
05:41 - you a book or making t-shirts and things
05:43 - like that you can also support the
05:44 - coding Train by going to storeen coding
05:48 - train. uh
05:51 - storenvy.com if you would like to buy
05:53 - some coding train merchandise okay uh
05:56 - got those things out of the way now um
05:58 - typically even though there's no
05:59 - typically because I'm kind of all over
06:00 - the place I like to do these live
06:02 - streams on Fridays I like to have an
06:04 - opening segments where I share work from
06:06 - the community or answer some questions
06:07 - that were posted on Reddit I'm not
06:09 - prepared for any of that stuff today so
06:12 - I think I'm just going to launch right
06:13 - into the material and start talking it
06:15 - through and making
06:16 - examples
06:19 - uh so um but if I I'm hoping that
06:23 - perhaps I will be back tomorrow on
06:24 - Friday at some point for a kind of
06:26 - regular coding Train episode where maybe
06:28 - I'll be able to do some sharing of work
06:30 - from the community and answering some
06:32 - questions um okay
06:36 - so I got okay uh Rick Van de Brock in
06:40 - the chat asks why won't you make more
06:43 - native JavaScript tutorials without p5js
06:45 - I have been getting this question a lot
06:48 - I'm trying to
06:50 - think I must I need something to help me
06:53 - think can I have some meditation
06:58 - music This is actually my new debugging
07:01 - music I'm
07:07 - debugging I'm I'm trying to to breathe
07:11 - deeply to think about why is it that I
07:13 - don't make vanilla JavaScript tutorials
07:16 - without p5js um I don't have a good
07:18 - answer to that question um I think
07:20 - there's a lot of value in uh writing
07:22 - code from without libraries and
07:24 - dependencies I think there's a lot of
07:25 - value in writing code with libraries and
07:27 - dependencies um and I am not not opposed
07:30 - uh to doing um tutorials in JavaScript
07:33 - without p5js and I I do periodically do
07:36 - stuff with node uh server side
07:38 - programming uh in JavaScript I'm using
07:41 - just plain old node and some node
07:43 - packages as well I suppose the you know
07:46 - the answer I have to that question is
07:48 - that p5js as part of the processing
07:50 - Foundation is a project that I'm just
07:53 - personally invested in uh it's a project
07:56 - it's a open source it's a piece of Open
07:57 - Source software that I care about that
07:59 - think hope is bringing good things to
08:01 - the world and I would like to support it
08:02 - and explore it and teach with it um it
08:05 - also I find it nice to be able to skip
08:09 - past some of
08:11 - the gobble deg that is uh dat of
08:16 - JavaScript and be able to in a more
08:18 - succinct way draw and animate and p5js I
08:21 - believe is a good platform for that but
08:23 - I do it that you know um there are areas
08:27 - where p5js does not have certain
08:28 - functionality and um I am not opposed to
08:32 - at some point trying looking at doing
08:33 - tutorials with Native JavaScript a
08:35 - better
08:37 - question a better question might be why
08:40 - aren't you programming using
08:42 - es6 syntax and then maybe you're
08:45 - thinking to yourself what is es6 syntax
08:48 - and I think I've talked about this
08:49 - before this is something that I need to
08:51 - come to grips
08:52 - with I'm
08:55 - looking something
08:58 - ominous
09:06 - why don't I program with
09:08 - [Music]
09:10 - es6 I think I need to I think it's time
09:14 - I think it's what people are using I
09:16 - think it's like already like 3 years old
09:18 - there's some parts of it that make me
09:20 - somewhat uncomfortable um like uh the
09:23 - fact that there's like an equal sign and
09:27 - greater than and that means function and
09:29 - there's some kind of like stuff um but I
09:32 - do think in particular that the class
09:35 - Syntax for doing objectoriented
09:37 - programming
09:39 - matches um classical object-oriented
09:42 - programming envir uh languages it's more
09:45 - a makes more sense it's a little less
09:46 - awkward I would like to start doing that
09:48 - and I am thinking about uh this fall
09:51 - starting over and doing all of my
09:53 - beginner learn to program from scratch
09:55 - in JavaScript tutorials uh using es6
09:58 - syntax uh with possibly with P5 Jets
10:01 - this might be a this might be a great
10:02 - idea it might be a terrible idea I look
10:04 - forward to hearing your feedback uh but
10:07 - today I will be still using my
10:11 - old es5 syntax don't throw if only you
10:15 - could throw internet Tomatoes at me that
10:17 - would maybe I can build up some sort of
10:19 - like node.js socket connected catapult
10:22 - system by which you could be watching
10:24 - the live stream and pressing a button
10:26 - and tomatoes could be flung at me or
10:28 - candy
10:32 - popcorn no popcorn's not good I don't
10:33 - know flowers something or tomatoes
10:35 - whatever
10:38 - okay what's happening now I'm looking at
10:40 - the chat
10:42 - okay uh let's see here um I see some
10:47 - tomato emojis in the chat
10:50 - wonderful okay uh oh if you didn't see
10:54 - today um I released uh a compilation
10:57 - video of um I'm just going to oh look at
11:00 - this I'm live uh I encourage you to
11:02 - check out this uh video from itp's uh
11:05 - 2017 spring show I did a live stream
11:07 - where I interviewed students showed
11:08 - their projects ITP is the graduate
11:10 - program here at New York University
11:13 - where I teach full-time and uh if you
11:15 - want to check out what students are
11:16 - doing here uh check out this video here
11:18 - I'm I'm like promoting my own videos in
11:22 - my video which is a little bit of a
11:23 - problem uh I did a most recently a mind
11:26 - sweeper coding challenge that was quite
11:27 - a bit of fun uh if you I've made a
11:29 - variation of Mind sweeper uh you should
11:32 - go to uh because maybe I can show some
11:34 - of these tomorrow uh or next week
11:36 - depending on when I come back next if
11:37 - you go to Rainbow
11:39 - code uh under coding challenges and then
11:43 - if I scroll down here all the way to the
11:45 - bottom uh to mind sweeper there is a
11:48 - read me here oh look there's already
11:50 - some so let's look at um this is oh I
11:54 - can't see this is just repository so I
11:56 - don't have demo uh and this is just
11:58 - ported to tight scripts look let's look
12:00 - at this
12:01 - one uh right here oh canvas uh let's
12:05 - look at this and we have look at this o
12:07 - I love it so some some color some new
12:10 - interface stuff ability to change the
12:12 - width and height a timer new game button
12:16 - and by the way one thing I really missed
12:17 - in my mind sweeper coding challenge
12:19 - which I'm so sad about was that the way
12:23 - that mind sweeper works is it's designed
12:26 - in such a way that you can never by
12:28 - accident click on a bomb as your first
12:31 - click and I I made this B sweeper click
12:33 - on a b to get stung um you can and the
12:36 - way that that's done is you click on a
12:39 - cell and then all the bees are placed
12:42 - and the part where you click is not
12:44 - included as a possibility so I should
12:45 - have done that um there okay so I think
12:49 - now we are ready to start getting into
12:55 - linear
12:58 - regression
12:59 - or linear
13:02 - [Music]
13:06 - regression yeah um all right so what do
13:10 - I want to do here let's put on Symphony
13:15 - 40 and let's get set up
13:20 - here so I
13:23 - need
13:26 - to so
13:29 - okay so let's think about
13:31 - [Music]
13:35 - this okay um mind sweeper will
13:40 - work let's put this oh no session three
13:43 - that's where we are I'm in session
13:46 - [Music]
13:49 - three
13:51 - uh and I'm going to grab this similarity
13:55 - score and we're going to say uh L
13:59 - [Music]
14:03 - regression and get R movies. Json we're
14:07 - going to open up the adom text
14:11 - editor uh Tom in the chat makes an
14:14 - excellent point which is this whole
14:16 - class thing in es6 is just syntactic
14:20 - this is very hard to say syntactic Sugar
14:23 - by the way that would be a good name for
14:25 - a song syntactic
14:28 - Sugar
14:32 - um there's a wonderful discussion going
14:34 - on okay I got to not look at the
14:35 - discussion it's sometimes very
14:37 - distracting okay so now what I need to
14:39 - do is open this up in the atom
14:44 - editor know why this always
14:47 - runs oh
14:50 - okay see what happens
14:58 - here
15:04 - [Music]
15:17 - okay all right so now I have some code
15:20 - running I need to run a
15:24 - server uh and I'm going to go to the
15:27 - desktop session three and I'm going to
15:31 - run a little web server so I can see my
15:34 - code in the
15:37 - browser
15:40 - um and come here and open up a
15:48 - console
15:49 - okay by the way I haven't programmed
15:52 - this before I did read an article an
15:55 - online article about linear aggression
15:57 - and look up the formul
16:00 - but that's you know I don't really know
16:01 - what I'm doing here so just be aware
16:03 - you're tuning into someone who's giving
16:05 - you a tutorial about stuff that he just
16:07 - looked at earlier this afternoon this is
16:09 - how I this is how I do it okay
16:13 - uh so I think we're ready this is
16:17 - definitely going to require some serious
16:19 - whiteboard
16:22 - time it's whiteboard
16:27 - time that work no here we go um okay so
16:32 - I'm just testing this out over here you
16:34 - can still see and hear me I am talking
16:36 - to you the people of the
16:39 - internet welcome and so now let me think
16:43 - about
16:44 - this on the one hand so what I'm going
16:47 - to do is use a statistical approach to
16:51 - calculate a linear aggression for a
16:54 - two-dimensional data
16:56 - set um and the reason I'm doing this
16:59 - is to just look at the idea of how you
17:02 - you know what is machine learning it's
17:04 - sort of matching inputs to outputs um
17:06 - and then making a prediction based on an
17:08 - existing data so I'm really sort of
17:09 - setting the context and if we look at
17:12 - linear regression which is just in this
17:14 - sort of simple 2D space it'll give us
17:17 - give us a sort of framework for
17:19 - discussing systems with models with many
17:22 - many many many many many parameters and
17:23 - ultimately even though we can do linear
17:26 - regression with a statistical approach
17:28 - we could also do it with something
17:29 - called gradient
17:31 - descent so here are the
17:35 - videos what is linear linear regression
17:38 - and ordinary least squares and what is
17:41 - the math for
17:42 - it then make a simple code example that
17:46 - does that making a list here should I
17:48 - make this
17:49 - list
17:52 - um
17:54 - what is linear regression
18:01 - uh one is linear
18:03 - aggression uh and then we're also going
18:05 - to talk about
18:06 - ordinary
18:08 - least squares
18:11 - method then I also want to talk about
18:14 - model
18:17 - checking and other
18:21 - methods then we want to look
18:24 - at
18:26 - um Bo is this off the camera can can the
18:29 - camera see that it
18:32 - cannot wait I have a way of fixing this
18:35 - the
18:36 - camera can turn it's
18:41 - amazing
18:43 - um then I want to look at uh polynomial
18:49 - regression and for this I think I'm
18:51 - going to use a JS
18:56 - library and then
18:59 - we're going to get into a gradient
19:03 - descent so I
19:05 - question whether any of this is really
19:09 - uh necessary or
19:11 - worthwhile because in many ways I don't
19:15 - know I mean it's all interesting and
19:17 - learning is good and uh
19:21 - um but um you know it is important to
19:24 - say hydrated we do know
19:27 - that
19:29 - so the question
19:32 - is because ultimately I could just jump
19:34 - right into looking at a perceptron and I
19:37 - could use gadient descent with a
19:38 - perceptron but I think this will give us
19:40 - some language and some background and
19:41 - some Theory to help us have more of a
19:44 - foundation for when we get into some of
19:46 - the neural network-based machine
19:47 - learning stuff do you agree I think
19:49 - that's the case so this is my list uh it
19:52 - is 4:40 p.m. um and I expect I would
19:57 - like to get through I would like to get
19:58 - through all of this by the end of
20:01 - tomorrow so this week being today and
20:04 - tomorrow I don't know exactly when is
20:07 - I'm to fit in time to come back to to
20:09 - stream live tomorrow but I'm hoping to
20:12 - and so I will get through some amount of
20:14 - this today hopefully at least the sort
20:16 - of first two possibly the first
20:18 - three uh any questions I just like to
20:21 - said so any questions or suggestions or
20:23 - thoughts before um before I get
20:27 - started
20:30 - uh
20:32 - okay
20:36 - yeah I'm just I'm just reading through
20:38 - the chat right
20:43 - now
20:44 - uh all right I'm just seeing um great
20:49 - okay so I didn't see any questions that
20:51 - I'm going to tackle at this very
20:54 - moment so um I expect that that this so
21:00 - if you haven't watched my live streams
21:02 - before what happens is I kind of fumble
21:04 - my way through a lot of stuff and um
21:07 - then uh later it gets edited down to a
21:11 - shorter tutorial video I expect that
21:13 - this these are going to involve quite a
21:14 - bit of editing because I think I'm going
21:16 - to have to like look stuff up and find
21:18 - things maybe a diagram an image kind of
21:21 - as I go and I'm happy to take uh from
21:24 - the chat the writing on the board is a
21:25 - little smaller than usual I thought I
21:27 - noticed that as well well um sorry let
21:29 - me check on that in a second so I might
21:31 - have to um so if you have suggestions or
21:33 - thoughts um uh please post them in the
21:36 - chat if you're a patron and are in the
21:38 - slack Channel um that's a little bit
21:41 - easier for me to follow so in particular
21:43 - if there a good point or question or
21:45 - thought from the YouTube chat if one of
21:47 - you who's in both could copy that into
21:49 - the slack chat that would be great okay
21:52 - uh let me look at the the is the writing
21:54 - smaller is my handwriting just smaller
21:56 - or is it actually smaller I wonder if I
21:59 - zoomed how how is this can you read
22:15 - that a bit too small I'm seeing from
22:17 - some folks it's pretty small it's a
22:20 - little small lots of opinions on the
22:23 - size of the writing now
22:26 - I I have a feeling that I I realized I
22:29 - haven't been in here
22:30 - since uh I think one of these is like a
22:35 - zoom look at
22:42 - that uh that is to I feel like that
22:46 - seems too zoomed in so let me zoom out a
22:50 - little
22:56 - more maybe that's a little bit better
22:58 - that just where it was at the
23:01 - beginning
23:06 - uh problem is you guys are 20 seconds
23:09 - behind me perfect out of is it out of
23:15 - focus that's just like the
23:18 - beginning write bigger oh what a novel
23:21 - idea I'm gonna just zoom in a little bit
23:24 - I'm going to try to get a little bit
23:25 - more there we go that's makes it a
23:26 - little bit bigger the question is the
23:29 - focus how's the
23:34 - focus okay perfect great uh all right
23:37 - everybody so here we go focus is fine
23:40 - rewrite it a bit big I don't that list
23:42 - isn't that important it's just sort of
23:43 - uh background for me when I draw and do
23:47 - diagrams and stuff I will definitely
23:48 - make it bigger okay here we
23:57 - go I don't know what I'm going to do by
23:59 - the way does any I so at some point um
24:02 - if anybody has a really good suggestion
24:04 - for a uh for a data set that I might use
24:08 - I think what I'm going to actually do is
24:09 - just make random points and do a
24:11 - regression of random points or I'm going
24:13 - to let the user click um and sort of add
24:16 - points and then fit the line to whatever
24:18 - if none of this makes any sense to you
24:20 - hopefully my explanation will make it
24:21 - make sense to you um but if anybody has
24:23 - an idea for a really you know the
24:25 - typical things that people do are like
24:27 - uh doing a linear regression for uh
24:30 - height value predicting a weight value
24:32 - based on height or predicting you know a
24:34 - height based on hand size or price of a
24:37 - house based on number of bedrooms you
24:39 - know something like that that is a very
24:40 - simple 2D relationship
24:43 - okay this is the invisible laptop you
24:47 - can see where it is if I stand behind
24:50 - it okay something on kaggle yeah
24:53 - exchange yeah but you know mostly um
24:56 - mostly what I'm uh what I would like is
24:59 - to do a very generic tutorial and have
25:00 - people find their own data and then and
25:02 - work with it so maybe that's what's
25:04 - better anyway okay here we go um let's
25:07 - get
25:12 - started
25:13 - uh
25:15 - okay hello welcome to another video in
25:19 - my series on machine
25:24 - learning I I don't know why I said that
25:26 - that way but sounds very Hest anyway um
25:28 - I'm going to talk about something called
25:30 - linear regression in this video uh and
25:34 - so in this video I'm really just going
25:36 - to talk about what linear regression is
25:40 - and why it's something related to the
25:43 - topic of machine learning now if you've
25:45 - been watching these videos in sequence
25:47 - you might have just watched some videos
25:49 - you might remember me from such other
25:50 - videos as nearest neighbor similarity
25:53 - score um and so uh the idea being that
25:57 - we're looking to create create a machine
25:59 - Learning System right there's some kind
26:01 - of quote unquote machine learning
26:04 - recipe and we have some type of input
26:10 - data that goes into the machine learning
26:13 - recipe and out the other side comes some
26:17 - sort of
26:21 - output so this can be any number of
26:23 - things you know the classic scenario
26:26 - example is you know inputs are uh
26:31 - Square can I just start this video it's
26:33 - been a while it's been a while since
26:36 - I've been
26:38 - here and I
26:41 - um I don't know I feel like off my game
26:44 - a little
26:45 - bit and I think that I'm recapping too
26:48 - much because it's been so long since I
26:53 - recorded these videos but if somebody
26:55 - were actually coming to this to
26:56 - experience it like a course they would
26:58 - would have really they they could have
26:59 - just watched this in sequence maybe a
27:00 - day or two ago or even a week ago as
27:02 - opposed to like three weeks ago so I'm
27:05 - gal um I'm going
27:07 - to I'm getting some great suggestions
27:09 - for data sets in the chat temperature
27:11 - versus Ice Cream sales I like that
27:13 - galton's original height data is a
27:15 - classic and is that uh K weekman who
27:18 - posted that in the um slack channel is
27:20 - that where the term is that the same I
27:23 - think it's galon French um where the
27:26 - term regression actually came from and
27:28 - anyway uh so just give me one Mulligan
27:31 - for today and I'm going to start over
27:35 - now it's very warm in here got to get
27:38 - this air situation worked out okay here
27:42 - we
27:44 - go Okay Hand ey coordination brain
27:48 - coordination not so good hand ey
27:50 - coordination is still still seems to
27:52 - work for
27:53 - me hello welcome to another video in my
27:57 - machine learning or artificial
27:59 - intelligence or something like that
28:01 - series I'm trying to figure all this
28:02 - stuff out okay so in this video I'm
28:05 - going to introduce the idea of linear
28:06 - regression what is linear regression and
28:10 - why is it something that's kind of
28:11 - relevant in terms of this sequence so
28:14 - the um this we're kind of on this train
28:18 - oh look train metaphor we're on this
28:20 - train along the tracks Trucking
28:22 - along getting towards this idea of
28:24 - looking at neural network-based uh
28:27 - machine learning systems and
28:29 - so one of the things we need to do is
28:31 - start building up our vocabulary and our
28:33 - sort of sense of how pieces of how
28:37 - machine learning
28:39 - works I please bang my head against the
28:41 - wall for just a minute okay so uh how
28:44 - does machine learning system work the
28:46 - idea here is that we have some kind of
28:48 - machine learning recipe we have some
28:50 - kind of
28:51 - inputs and those inputs it's like a
28:54 - spreadsheet goes into the machine
28:55 - learning recipe it does some stuff to it
28:58 - and it comes out with some sort of
29:01 - output output and input so this is the
29:04 - idea we looked at uh nearest neighbor um
29:09 - classification and regression we talked
29:11 - I talked a bit about what classification
29:13 - is what regression is here is a time
29:16 - where I want to look at a particular
29:18 - recipe a machine learning recipe
29:21 - called linear
29:25 - regression linear regression is a useful
29:28 - technique when there is a linear
29:31 - relationship between the input data and
29:34 - the output data what is a linear
29:36 - relationship okay the idea here is that
29:39 - if we take some data set and we graph it
29:44 - this known as kind of like a SC known as
29:46 - a scatter plot we graph it this is the x
29:51 - axis this being the Y AIS so maybe we
29:55 - look at something as was just suggested
29:57 - to me in the live chat that's going on
29:59 - right now that the x axis represents
30:03 - temperature the Y AIS represents ice
30:07 - cream sales
30:10 - now I would like to also include sorbet
30:13 - in here I don't know why I put sorbet in
30:16 - quotes but you know the dairy it doesn't
30:19 - agree with me so much so but that's in
30:22 - as side that's not relevant or maybe oh
30:24 - my goodness I'm not even in the frame
30:27 - help me I am off screen the uneven
30:30 - sleeves are bothering people yeah that's
30:32 - really a problem see I nobody can see
30:34 - the
30:37 - board all right all right see okay hold
30:39 - on let me let me try this one more
30:44 - time okay all right uh all right all
30:47 - right you you guys are all very kind to
30:49 - watch you know I used to not do these
30:51 - live and when I didn't do them live I
30:54 - never actually got anything
30:56 - done because I just stopped and started
30:59 - over and over and over again you can see
31:01 - why I do that because I my sort of
31:05 - neurotic leads me to do that I'm going
31:07 - to have to make the same sorbet joke I'm
31:10 - just letting you know that was not
31:12 - planned that was
31:13 - spontaneous but now it won't be
31:15 - spontaneous anymore but I think it was a
31:17 - good one as a keeper I mean I could
31:19 - maybe I'm doing it the second time it's
31:21 - very hard with no actual live audience
31:23 - to feed off of I got to zoom out so I
31:27 - have a little more
31:32 - space I'm saving MAA from
31:35 - editing by
31:39 - um by uh just starting
31:43 - over okay so uh all right so this is
31:49 - going to be my last attempt I'm not
31:51 - allowed to start over
31:53 - again I'm doing it this time it's
31:56 - getting it is only getting hotter in
31:57 - here maybe I need to take off the hoodie
32:00 - but I thought I you know I did get the
32:02 - um some people had complained when these
32:04 - weren't even and I can totally
32:06 - understand that if they're not even now
32:07 - the sleeves also need to make sure
32:09 - they're both rolled up I think
32:11 - subscribers over time I think that's
32:13 - going
32:15 - down uh okay okay here we go
32:19 - everybody I need
32:24 - some welcome oh this is good I going to
32:27 - leave this in the background
32:30 - [Music]
32:38 - okay hello welcome
32:42 - to another video in my uh machine
32:44 - learning series and in this video I am
32:47 - going to talk about something called
32:49 - linear regression so I'm just actually
32:50 - going to move straight over to the
32:51 - Whiteboard going to just move along here
32:54 - um so why are we talking about linear
32:55 - regression so uh what what I'm leading
32:58 - towards and what I'm going to get to if
32:59 - you keep watching these videos they
33:01 - don't exist yet but I'm going to keep
33:02 - making them So eventually you might keep
33:03 - watching them is I'm going to get to
33:04 - neural networks and um neural networks
33:08 - are are useful and Powerful in the case
33:11 - of large data sets with many many
33:14 - variables many many inputs parameters
33:16 - that we almost can't figure out
33:18 - mathematically how to make sense of it
33:19 - maybe a neural network can do that in
33:21 - some almost magical way we're going to
33:23 - get into all the details of that but
33:25 - there are machine learning scenario
33:28 - where we can actually just calculate
33:30 - precisely using a statistical method the
33:33 - relationship between inputs and outputs
33:35 - right so if we were to review we have
33:37 - this idea of a machine learning
33:40 - recipe previously I looked at K nearest
33:43 - neighbor as a possible algorithm to make
33:46 - sense of input data and predict some
33:48 - sort of output whether it's classifying
33:50 - or predicting a price that type of thing
33:53 - so we have some sort of input we get
33:57 - some sort of out outut so let's take a
33:59 - very simple
34:01 - scenario pause this pause edit Point by
34:04 - the way this is going so much better so
34:05 - far but this marker kind of is terrible
34:09 - so let's try to find a better marker
34:11 - just gonna see here uh should have
34:13 - gotten some new
34:17 - ones that that and how's this one I'm
34:21 - just drawing over here oh you can
34:23 - actually see these let's try this one
34:24 - this is like a sort of fresh
34:26 - one so let's let's see I made it by the
34:30 - way really really small now
34:33 - uh uh mark on the board where I go out
34:36 - of frame if you past it that's a good um
34:40 - so let me I'm in the frame I'm in the
34:42 - frame so I
34:44 - shouldn't uh this is out of the frame so
34:48 - if I'm standing here I can actually see
34:50 - myself on a monitor there
34:54 - okay so let's take the simplest scenario
34:58 - of inputs related to outputs and um a
35:03 - simple scenario for this would be
35:04 - something like a twod dimensional data
35:07 - set okay so we could graph using
35:11 - something called a scatter plot a data
35:13 - set and we're going to make the data set
35:16 - bear with me here uh a
35:20 - temperature the x axis I want to think
35:24 - of as temperature so maybe uh I'm really
35:27 - sorry I'm going to do this in Fahrenheit
35:28 - I really just have to apologize for that
35:30 - I I'll happily say maths though anytime
35:33 - you want um zero
35:36 - degrees to uh 100° I guess it could be
35:40 - negative so in Fahrenheit and then the Y
35:43 - AIS will be ice
35:46 - cream sales and uh this was suggested uh
35:50 - in the chat um but I'm I'm going to add
35:52 - to this uh sorbet in quotes for no
35:55 - reason oh I'm really I'm oh I'm out the
35:57 - frame I'm out of the frame I'm back okay
36:00 - uh but you can see this right yes s i
36:02 - just not if I put my head in front of it
36:04 - okay so uh yeah just because you know
36:06 - Dairy doesn't really agree with me just
36:07 - in case you were wondering okay so I
36:09 - like survey okay so uh we could say like
36:12 - oh when it's uh you know
36:15 - 24° there only three ice creams are sold
36:18 - per day and then on another day it was
36:21 - uh 90° and there were 18 and you know
36:25 - another day that was 90° there were this
36:27 - many and then you know you could
36:29 - imagine if you were the owner the
36:31 - purveyor of an ice cream shopy that you
36:35 - could keep track of your sales as it
36:37 - relates to temperature and then what you
36:40 - could do is that you have all this data
36:43 - now somebody comes into your place of
36:46 - business and says okay tomorrow the
36:49 - weather's going to be 50
36:50 - degrees what could you like could you
36:53 - make a guess as to how many ice creams
36:55 - you're going to sell and so we could
36:57 - look and say Here's you know 50° well
37:01 - there was some other day where I sold
37:02 - this much when was 50 some other day
37:03 - some other day how could we make a
37:06 - prediction well this is a scenario where
37:09 - it appears there is a linear
37:12 - relationship a linear relationship
37:15 - between temperature and sales the higher
37:19 - the temperature the more the sales the
37:22 - lower the temperature the less the fewer
37:25 - the fewer the Sals
37:28 - so the idea of a linear regression is to
37:31 - figure out how can we fit a
37:34 - line best fit a line to this data and I
37:37 - could look at this and hold on I'm going
37:40 - to be back in a second for some
37:44 - magic
37:48 - uh uh Sor I'm looking at
37:51 - Kelvin
37:53 - uh
37:56 - okay
37:58 - I'm back this is the by the way this is
37:59 - like a historic moment not really
38:01 - because that's be ridiculous this is the
38:03 - first time I'm ever using a marker with
38:05 - a different color on my YouTube channel
38:07 - maybe suddenly I'll just get so many
38:08 - subscribers because they'll be like I
38:10 - heard there's this Channel with
38:12 - tutorials and a whiteboard where they
38:13 - use multiple colors okay so um we could
38:16 - make a guess and I could say like look
38:19 - that looks like a line that kind of fits
38:22 - the
38:23 - data that's me just as a human being
38:26 - kind of eyeballing it so now if I wanted
38:28 - to say you know when the temperature is
38:32 - 95° I could just look at 95° find this
38:36 - and find the corresponding you know uh
38:39 - you know 200 ice creams or whatever sold
38:42 - so this is the idea of linear regression
38:45 - looking at a data set and fitting a line
38:48 - to that data set now how do you do this
38:51 - there are many different methods and
38:53 - we're I'm going to look at multiple
38:54 - methods in different videos in this
38:56 - video I would like to
38:59 - discuss the method called Ordinary least
39:03 - squares I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna
39:05 - write this down ordinary oh boy I got a
39:07 - little dizzy everything's going to be
39:09 - okay
39:10 - least
39:12 - squares what does that mean okay so if
39:15 - we look at this line we can compare uh
39:19 - every single this is the line that we've
39:22 - fit to the data you know by as a human
39:24 - being eyeballing it one thing that I can
39:27 - do is I can say look how different is
39:30 - each one of these data points from the
39:33 - line and I could see like I could
39:35 - essentially like look at its distance
39:37 - from the
39:39 - line and the idea of ordinary least
39:43 - squares is the least squares method is
39:46 - we want to find the line that
39:49 - minimizes all of these distances so what
39:52 - if we okay so if we could think of all
39:54 - of these as data points like
39:58 - uh you know x0 X1 X2 X3 x uh X4 right we
40:06 - could think of all of these
40:08 - distances as like d0 D1 D2 D3 D4 so if
40:15 - we took all of these distances and
40:18 - squared them D 0^ 2ar plus D1 2 plus D2
40:23 - 2 etc etc etc and added them all up
40:27 - together that's
40:30 - the sum of all the squares of all the
40:32 - differences we want to minimize this
40:34 - value so how do we calculate the for the
40:38 - how do we find a line that minimizes all
40:40 - those so you might be asking well why
40:42 - are you first of all why are you
40:43 - squaring the values well this is a
40:45 - common technique you know you'll notice
40:47 - that some points are below the line and
40:49 - some points are above the line so the
40:51 - difference could be positive or negative
40:53 - squaring it gets rid of that difference
40:56 - um okay so how do we do this um like I
41:00 - said there are a variety of
41:02 - methods and what I'm going to
41:05 - do is I'm going to show you a formula
41:08 - for this which I have written
41:11 - down it's another historic moment I
41:14 - prepared for today's video this was by
41:17 - preparation I wrote down the
41:19 - formula I could pretend that I memorized
41:22 - it by editing this out if this is still
41:25 - in this video then I did not pretend
41:28 - um okay so let's look at um so first of
41:31 - all what how do we represent
41:33 - mathematically this pinkish reddish line
41:37 - so the formula for a line is typically
41:40 - written as yal
41:42 - MX plus b i will point out however that
41:46 - if you look in uh statistics textbook
41:49 - you might see something like y = b 0 +
41:55 - B1 * X
41:58 - this is the same exact formula M refers
42:01 - to our B1 here as the slope and B 0 or B
42:06 - here is the quote unquote Y
42:10 - intercept which is the value where the
42:14 - line intersects the Y AIS so the slope
42:17 - this m value determines like which way
42:20 - does the line point and then the Y
42:22 - intercept is how high or low uh it you
42:25 - know where is that line relative to the
42:28 - X
42:29 - AIS so all we need to do is we need to
42:32 - both calculate m and b so here's the
42:35 - thing this is a you while we're looking
42:37 - at this you know most data sets that you
42:40 - might work with aren't just simple 2D
42:42 - data sets there might be you know
42:45 - there's temperature there's you know
42:47 - population of the city that the store is
42:49 - in maybe you know there's the hours that
42:52 - it's open I I don't know you could think
42:53 - of like all sorts of other data in puts
42:57 - that might relate to the sale of ice
43:01 - cream and this can actually be
43:03 - generalized much of you know this this
43:06 - could be y = b 0 + B1 * X1 + B2 * X2 so
43:13 - there could actually be multiple linear
43:16 - this is referred to as multiple linear
43:17 - regression and generally you know the
43:20 - the same math that I'm going to show to
43:21 - you applies to this scenario but it
43:24 - typically involves U Matrix based
43:26 - calculations maybe I'll do that in a
43:28 - different video but we're it's simpler
43:30 - to look at in just this context with
43:32 - just one input but we can extrapolate
43:34 - that uh and you could think about it is
43:36 - instead of you know in If instead of a
43:39 - line you know fitting this to a plane
43:41 - right if you had this as you know if
43:42 - there was just simply one other two two
43:45 - data two uh input pieces of data okay
43:49 - how we doing so far you still here okay
43:52 - so
43:53 - now let's look
43:55 - at this form look you can see I wrote it
43:59 - down on this piece of paper maybe I can
44:01 - auction this off on eBay or nobody will
44:04 - want this okay going to need that piece
44:06 - of paper okay so here's how we calculate
44:10 - M the
44:11 - slope we calculate it
44:14 - as the sum so I'm going to use this
44:18 - Greek letter Sigma looks like an e but
44:20 - it's not an e it's a sigma which means
44:24 - sum of x Min - x with a line over it and
44:30 - I'll talk about what that
44:31 - means time y - y with a line over it you
44:36 - could call that uh Y Bar I
44:41 - suppose divided
44:44 - by the
44:47 - sum of x minus x with a
44:52 - bar
44:55 - squared Okay so let's think about what
44:57 - this means so first of all xar or Y Bar
45:02 - this means the mean or the average so
45:05 - what this really is is it's all of the X
45:08 - values added up together divided by how
45:10 - many there are so you could think of
45:14 - xar as being the sum and sigma by the
45:18 - way means sum so I'm going to kind of
45:19 - unpack that a little bit but the sum of
45:23 - of every single X so X index I so X 0 X1
45:27 - X2 where I goes from 0 to n n being the
45:32 - total so this is kind of mathematical
45:34 - notation to say add up all the X you can
45:37 - think of it as an array right an array
45:39 - of data points add them all up and then
45:42 - divide it by the total number there is
45:44 - divided by n so this is really what xar
45:47 - is it's just the average of all the X's
45:49 - Y Bar is the average of all the Y's so
45:53 - this means get that average and then
45:56 - take each x minus the average times each
45:59 - y minus the average and so this really
46:01 - is also these this Sigma should really
46:04 - also have I goes from zero to n and this
46:07 - is X index I this is y index I we have
46:11 - this from 0er to n this is X index I um
46:14 - as well so you can I'm not going to
46:17 - derive or prove this formula in this
46:18 - video maybe I can provide a resource to
46:21 - a page or a tutorial that does that in
46:23 - this video's description but you can
46:24 - almost kind of intuitively kind of
46:26 - understand why is this the slope of the
46:28 - line because what we're looking at is
46:32 - the sum of all the differences between
46:34 - the average X and the C current H
46:36 - multiplied by the average the
46:38 - differences between all the Y's and the
46:40 - average y's um so you um if we add all
46:45 - that stuff up together divided by the
46:48 - all of those X differences squared you
46:50 - can kind of intuitively understand how
46:52 - why that's going to be you know if all
46:55 - those values are equal we're just going
46:56 - to get the value one right so you you um
47:01 - I have to pause for a second because I
47:03 - lost my train of thought I'm going
47:05 - to
47:06 - uh
47:08 - um I'm just looking at the chat to see
47:11 - if I missed
47:12 - anything ah okay
47:17 - um I'm I'm looking at the chat to see uh
47:21 - to see what people are writing because
47:23 - hold on why is this opening here because
47:26 - I want to see what I'm I'm I'm missing
47:28 - here uh ice cream sales I should use all
47:31 - the colors of the rainbow are ordinary
47:33 - leas squares related to the leas squares
47:35 - regression this is from Alex plotting
47:37 - from linear
47:38 - algebra uh it's basically the same the
47:40 - ordinary distinguishes it from weighted
47:42 - least squares yes um okay how am I doing
47:45 - so far
47:49 - uh all right so I didn't make any
47:52 - horrific mistakes just yet I I got off a
47:55 - little on a little bit of a Tang there
47:57 - for a second because I was trying to
48:00 - like I was trying to
48:04 - explain why uh I was trying to explain
48:08 - this as like a having an intuitive
48:11 - understanding of why this formula works
48:14 - and I it didn't my explanation I think
48:15 - didn't really hold up so maybe I want to
48:18 - like go back and try to say that again
48:21 - but I want to think it through and maybe
48:22 - if anybody in slack has a good thought
48:24 - for me um so
48:28 - again let's think about let me let me
48:30 - talk this through for a second then
48:31 - maybe I'll explain it again think about
48:34 - if we had the scenario where X was equal
48:39 - to
48:42 - Y so the
48:45 - slope would be
48:50 - one right if x is equal to
48:53 - Y The Intercept could be Zero The
48:56 - Intercept is not relevant right now so
48:58 - if the if x is equal to Y the slope
49:01 - could be
49:02 - one
49:08 - because I'm looking in the chat to see
49:11 - for somebody to save me um if we had all
49:15 - the numbers we took the oh took the
49:18 - average that makes sense right because
49:21 - the average would be let's create a
49:25 - scenario where we have have just these
49:30 - points so the average X would be right
49:33 - here and the average y would also be
49:36 - right here ah right this makes sense
49:39 - because if X and Y are kind of have a
49:41 - equal
49:43 - relationship this times this okay this
49:46 - times this would be the equivalent of
49:47 - this squared that makes sense okay so
49:50 - maybe I can come back to talk
49:55 - about and if x if Y is growing faster as
50:02 - X it would point up this way if it's not
50:05 - growing up a point this
50:06 - way because if Y is so that this this is
50:09 - kind of solidifying in my
50:12 - head uh okay the numerator is basically
50:15 - the correlation thank you K weekman that
50:18 - is a much nicer way of putting
50:21 - it okay the slope basically defined um
50:25 - harsh gup the slope basally defines how
50:27 - much y changes with respect to
50:30 - x uh okay great thanks there's all these
50:33 - wonderful um uh comments in the chat I
50:36 - really appreciate it you guys know way
50:37 - more about this stuff than I do I should
50:39 - really stick with my like generative
50:42 - fractal tree rainbow colored stuff right
50:44 - don't you think I'm trying my best here
50:47 - uh okay so let me come back here and
50:54 - say so I'm not gonna derive or or prove
50:58 - this formula in this video although if I
51:00 - could find some supplemental information
51:01 - I'll link to it in this video's
51:02 - description or maybe in the comments you
51:04 - can offer a suggestion but you can kind
51:06 - of get a uh uh an intuitive kind of
51:10 - sense of why this formula works so first
51:13 - of all imagine if x equals y if the
51:15 - formula for the line were just yal X
51:19 - that would mean the slope would be one
51:21 - right the slope would be one if Y equals
51:23 - X well look at this if Y equals X then x
51:26 - - xar * x - xar would be like that
51:30 - squared so you could see how M would
51:32 - equal 1 if y equal x and then you could
51:35 - sort of say the numerator is essentially
51:36 - the correlation thank you to K week in
51:39 - the chat for typing it out like that
51:41 - because I think that's a good way of
51:41 - thinking about it you can see that you
51:44 - know if y grow you know is is y growing
51:48 - more uh as X grows or is X uh is y
51:51 - growing less as X grows you can sort of
51:53 - see how this relationship is going to uh
51:56 - between the numerator and the denom
51:57 - denominator is going to uh give you a
52:00 - fraction that describes the slope of
52:03 - this line so think about that hopefully
52:06 - it has some intuitive sense and I'm sure
52:08 - people in the comments will write some
52:09 - nice explanations that that help with
52:11 - that understanding so this is really it
52:14 - so what I want to do now in the ne I'm
52:16 - going to do this in the next video is I
52:18 - want to program this so I think what
52:21 - I'll do is I'll program it in such a way
52:23 - where a user can click and add data
52:26 - points
52:27 - and each time the user clicks I will I
52:30 - will implement this formula and draw the
52:33 - line of best fit um according to the
52:36 - ordinary least squares method um in
52:39 - canvas in the browser and after we do
52:41 - that I will talk about well what are
52:44 - some reasons why linear regression does
52:47 - it might not make sense for your data um
52:50 - but this is the idea this is just to
52:52 - just to kind of recap for a second the
52:54 - reason we're doing this is this is a
52:56 - model
52:57 - right the idea of a model the idea of a
52:59 - model is you try to fit it to the data
53:01 - we have known data training data
53:04 - temperature with actual Sals we want to
53:08 - fit our model our model just has two
53:10 - parameters the slope of the line and the
53:13 - Y intercept and once we solved for those
53:16 - parameters we can make new predictions
53:18 - and even though it's kind of overly
53:20 - simplistic here this is the exact same
53:23 - process that we will that I'll employ
53:25 - again and again once we look at a simple
53:28 - perceptron then a multi-layered
53:30 - perceptron and then things like
53:32 - convolutional networks or recurrent all
53:34 - of this all this is laying the
53:36 - foundation for a more sophisticated
53:39 - robust machine learning based systems
53:41 - okay so I hope this was helpful and made
53:44 - sense if it
53:52 - ah uh okay let's okay okay so I hope
53:57 - this was helpful and made some sense to
54:00 - you and you have uh uh an idea of what
54:03 - linear regression is what the least
54:05 - squares method is and if you're inclined
54:08 - to continue just keep following to the
54:11 - next video and I will program this
54:13 - particular algorithm from scratch okay
54:16 - thanks very much see you there
54:18 - [Music]
54:20 - maybe
54:25 - uh
54:27 - uh okay how how we
54:29 - doing
54:34 - um exponential classic example
54:37 - exponential R log plots yeah yeah yeah
54:40 - okay okay okay so how did we do
54:44 - everybody I don't wonder how long
54:46 - that'll be that was probably like 15
54:47 - minutes or something um so now what I'm
54:51 - going to
54:52 - do so uh if MAA if you're there I think
54:55 - what I think just what I think I'm going
54:57 - to do is not have this be coding
54:59 - challenge I don't know
55:03 - why um let me go look at the playlist
55:05 - here I mean that certainly was just an
55:07 - explanation I could make the second
55:08 - thing like a coding challenge but then
55:10 - it wouldn't have the explanation with it
55:12 - I wonder if if I look at my playlists
55:15 - where I'm thinking this would
55:17 - go is just as part of session two no are
55:23 - we in session two no no no we're in
55:24 - session three do I have a session 31 yet
55:28 - maybe I don't have a session 31 just yet
55:30 - did I do an introduction to session
55:32 - three I thought I
55:33 - did uh yeah I did I did so maybe I just
55:36 - didn't make that playlist so I think
55:37 - this can just go
55:39 - in
55:41 - um where are we
55:44 - here introduction session three what is
55:47 - machine learning and then it goes after
55:50 - these I kind of am so arbitrary about
55:54 - whether oh I need to speak about how to
55:56 - find
55:58 - B I forgot about that cuz that's such an
56:00 - easy part oops I got to go
56:04 - back we'll just splice this together in
56:06 - a weird out of order way hold on I gotta
56:09 - I mean b is sort of obvious once you
56:12 - have
56:16 - um yeah thank you I don't know why I
56:19 - forgot that uh
56:22 - okay I'm looking at the chat okay uh all
56:25 - right
56:27 - oops I forgot so for the formula of a
56:31 - the line Y = MX plus b the slope is the
56:35 - more complex calculation actually once
56:38 - we have that slope it's pretty easy to
56:40 - calculate the Y intercept where is B and
56:43 - the formula for that is b equals
56:47 - m
56:49 - time uh M * xar + Y Bar did I get that
56:54 - right oh no no no I totally did not get
56:57 - that right what am I
56:58 - saying let's just edit this back to
57:01 - where I get it correctly the uh formula
57:04 - is b = y
57:08 - barus m * xar and you could kind of see
57:12 - why this is the case right because
57:14 - remember y equal MX plus b so all I need
57:18 - to do is say uh b = y - MX right and we
57:23 - could just use the average of all the X
57:25 - and all the Y to figure out where should
57:27 - that line be shifted so this is a this
57:30 - is the formula to calculate that Y
57:32 - intercept so we can do this with a
57:34 - statistical method we run through all
57:36 - the data we calculate the slope we
57:38 - calculate the Y intercept and we have
57:40 - that line that formula for the line for
57:42 - which we can make predictions for new
57:46 - data I hope you found this blah blah
57:48 - blah so now we can go back to that uh
57:51 - blah blah blah okay wait what else did I
57:54 - miss um it's so nice but it's really
57:56 - good that I have a live chat going
57:58 - because I clearly make so many mistakes
58:00 - uh also your sum should run from one not
58:03 - zero
58:06 - oh yes that's a good point I'm right or
58:10 - it would be zero to n minus one
58:12 - technically I guess if I'm using sort of
58:14 - array index thing so maybe maybe I'll
58:17 - addendum this
58:20 - okay good luck M editing this together
58:23 - okay this could come still before my
58:25 - finishing point
58:28 - one more thing as it was uh pointed out
58:30 - in the chat to me thank you to K weekman
58:32 - yes again again which is that who should
58:34 - really be just making these video
58:35 - tutorials because I just keep getting
58:36 - everything wrong but I'm so used to
58:38 - Counting from zero in the array index
58:42 - programming world that I live in uh
58:44 - there's five elements 0 1 2 3 four but
58:47 - in this case in this notation this
58:49 - should really be sum from I equals 1 all
58:52 - the way to n there's 10 elements 1 2 3 4
58:54 - 5 6 7 8 9 10 we could think of them as 0
58:57 - to 9 1 to 10 whatever it's the same idea
58:59 - but technically speaking I think my
59:01 - formulas are a bit off if this doesn't
59:03 - say I equals one so that's a good
59:06 - correction thank you very
59:11 - much now I hope blah blah blah so this
59:13 - could be or I could divide by n plus one
59:15 - is the average no no no I think my
59:17 - fixing explanation there was good okay
59:23 - uh
59:25 - okay
59:30 - I don't know why this musac stuff gives
59:32 - me such
59:34 - [Music]
59:35 - happiness no I did forget the formula
59:37 - for the Y intercept but then I uh got it
59:39 - in it okay did I miss anything
59:41 - [Music]
59:43 - else because now we can program it what
59:46 - time is it
59:47 - [Music]
59:53 - [Music]
59:55 - 5:20
59:58 - [Music]
59:59 - okay I'm not seeing any major
60:02 - Corrections uh
60:06 - so we're going to program it
60:09 - [Music]
60:19 - now
60:21 - hello welcome to ah another video which
60:26 - is part two of my uh linear regression
60:29 - tutorial and in this video I am going to
60:31 - take this beautiful blank canvas that is
60:34 - the web browser and make linear
60:37 - regression happen in it is that a weird
60:39 - thing to say or do hopefully not anyway
60:42 - so how are we going to do this so first
60:45 - thing that I need is I need to boy this
60:48 - is always more complicated than you
60:50 - think I like oh it's G to be so
60:53 - simple one thing that I should do I
60:55 - should should probably hm hold
61:00 - on do I need to map the screen work work
61:04 - with me folks here do I need to map the
61:06 - pixel space to a more kind of
61:09 - traditional cartisian plane like where Z
61:12 - 0 is in the bottom left and kind of
61:15 - normalize it between zero and
61:17 - one and so I get a kind of less insane
61:21 - looking formula for the line or should I
61:23 - just live with the coordinate system the
61:25 - way it is is it's probably useful to map
61:28 - it because when you get data it's not
61:30 - going to have the pixel-based
61:33 - stuff okay I think I'm gonna have to map
61:35 - it
61:38 - okay okay I did some thinking there for
61:40 - a second and um wait I'm going to do a
61:43 - little more
61:45 - [Music]
61:50 - thinking can you see the wheels turning
61:52 - CU actually I was just kind of homing it
61:55 - there like
61:56 - I was thinking about you know what I was
61:58 - going to eat for dinner okay um so
62:01 - here's the thing that happens a lot in a
62:03 - machine learning and computer
62:06 - Graphics this thing that I've drawn over
62:09 - here is sort of has an arbitrary scale
62:12 - there's a temperature which I botched by
62:13 - doing it in Fahrenheit which is like the
62:15 - worst measuring system ever I I don't
62:17 - want to be insulting it's just you know
62:19 - and Fahrenheit you're wonderful too you
62:22 - have many good qualities just like
62:23 - Celsius I I love all my temperature
62:26 - systems
62:27 - equally anyway um but let's say I wanted
62:31 - to actually graph this data you know
62:33 - what do I have I have a canvas that I'm
62:35 - going to draw in the web browser which
62:37 - you know has like 0 to 600 pixels and 0
62:40 - to 400 pixels z z in the top left it
62:42 - points down it points to the right I
62:44 - think I need to map my pixel space so
62:47 - what I mean by that is I want to have my
62:51 - pixel space represent Z being in the
62:54 - bottom left and I want the x axis to be
62:58 - kind of go from 0 to one and the y axis
63:00 - go from 0 to one so I need to have kind
63:02 - a scale the data scale and then the
63:05 - computer Graphics scale and I'm sort of
63:06 - making this up so it can be anything but
63:08 - when you go and apply this with real
63:10 - data you need some way of mapping from
63:12 - your data to pixels if you want to graph
63:14 - it you know in a lot of uh systems for
63:17 - doing data visualization if you're using
63:19 - r or D3 you know or some python graphic
63:22 - stuff it's not going to do this for you
63:23 - automatically but we're in JavaScript
63:25 - land we're going to use P5 we're going
63:26 - to do the maths ourselves okay okay so
63:30 - um so I'm going to first of all I'm
63:33 - gonna so I'm going to make a
63:36 - canvas and I'm going to make a canvas
63:38 - that's 400 by 400 and I'm going to draw
63:41 - the background uh with a a gray value of
63:44 - 51 okay whoa that's a giant canvas okay
63:47 - that's better so um I'm going to make it
63:50 - a square just to make things simpler
63:52 - right now um and then what I'm going to
63:55 - do
63:56 - is I'm going to say uh Mouse
64:01 - pressed and whenever I press the mouse
64:04 - I'm going to create a new data point so
64:07 - I'm going to say x equals map Mouse X
64:09 - which goes between zero and width to a
64:11 - value between zero and one so this is me
64:15 - mapping the X values between zero and
64:17 - width to zero and one because the
64:19 - pretend data If This Were Real data I'd
64:21 - want to know what the actual range was I
64:22 - wouldn't be getting it from Mouse click
64:24 - but and I'm going to say VAR y equals
64:26 - math Mouse y from0 to height now however
64:29 - I'm going to say from one to zero
64:31 - because I want to have the bottom of the
64:34 - window be zero right if I come over here
64:37 - this is z 0 right over here so that's
64:41 - height which is zero zero is one okay so
64:46 - then what I'm going to do is I'm going
64:48 - to say VAR uh data equals create I'm
64:51 - going to use the P5 Vector object just
64:53 - to store both of these things and I'm
64:55 - I'm going to say Point call this a
64:57 - point and I'm going to make an array
65:00 - called
65:01 - data and I am going to say data. push
65:05 - point so what I've done here is every
65:08 - time I click I create a data point based
65:11 - on where the mouse is so what do I want
65:13 - to do in the draw
65:16 - function you know it's a little
65:17 - unnecessary to have an animation Loop
65:19 - here because I could potentially only
65:21 - redraw but whenever I have a new piece
65:23 - of data what I'm going to do here is I'm
65:25 - going to
65:28 - uh I'm going to iterate over all of the
65:31 - data uh so our I equals z i is less than
65:34 - data. length
65:38 - i++ and now what I need to do is do the
65:41 - reverse mapping so when I put the data
65:44 - into that array I want to map it to the
65:47 - the appropriate range and when I get it
65:49 - out I need to map it back to the pixel
65:50 - range so I'm going to say varx equals
65:53 - map data index I .x which has a range
65:57 - between 0 and one to between zero and
65:59 - width and I'm going to do the same thing
66:01 - for
66:02 - y map data doy which has a range between
66:07 - zero and one and map that to a range
66:09 - from height down to zero if you if you
66:12 - haven't seen this map function before I
66:13 - have a whole video just on what is map
66:16 - so you could go I'll link to that in the
66:18 - description as well then I'm going to
66:20 - draw an ellipse at X comma y That's you
66:23 - know 8 pixels by 8 pixels I'm going to
66:26 - say fill 255 and stroke 255 and now what
66:30 - we should see here is just the visuals
66:32 - that I want which is wherever I click I
66:37 - get a point so you know this would be a
66:40 - lot simpler without that mapping but the
66:42 - mapping is going to be useful for us as
66:45 - we start to try to compute the formula
66:47 - for the line with the with the least
66:48 - squares uh
66:50 - criteria okay um how we doing so far I
66:54 - think we're doing okay I mean I feel
66:59 - [Music]
67:03 - okay
67:07 - probably um all right so what's the next
67:09 - thing that I need to do oh we need to
67:10 - calculate m&b so when should we do that
67:14 - so let's make a global variable M let's
67:17 - call it I think I could call it m equals
67:20 - z and VAR b equals z and let's actually
67:25 - make m equal 1 so let's see if we have
67:28 - an m and a b right the formula for a
67:31 - line is y okay so
67:34 - let's let's
67:36 - uh um what are we gon to do okay I got
67:39 - it I got it I got it okay so here's the
67:42 - thing I want to draw that line so how am
67:45 - I going to do that well I could just
67:47 - take the x value here and then the x
67:51 - value at the end calculate the
67:53 - corresponding yv values for both of
67:54 - those points and then draw a line
67:56 - between them so let's do that so let's
67:59 - write a function
68:01 - called Draw line and what I'm going to
68:04 - do is I'm going to say VAR X Min equals
68:09 - zero VAR y Min uh sorry x max equals 1
68:15 - then I'm going to say y Min equals m * X
68:20 - Min +
68:22 - B and Y Max you know what this is really
68:26 - just like
68:28 - X1 uh X2 y1 Y2 like I'm really trying to
68:33 - get two points X1 y1 and and X2
68:37 - Y2 so in
68:39 - fact this would make more sense to write
68:41 - it this way y1 = M * X1 +
68:47 - B and Y2 = M * X2 + B and now all I need
68:53 - to do is say
68:54 - stroke 255 oh I could make it a
68:57 - different color just like I had two
68:58 - different color
69:00 - markers and I could say line X1 y1 X2 Y2
69:05 - only I can't right what's the problem I
69:08 - calculated this line with my units my my
69:12 - scale my mapping of the data having this
69:15 - range between zero and one and so I need
69:18 - to unmap it to the pixel stuff so this
69:20 - is a little bit awkward but let's just
69:22 - do it this way let's say X1 equals math
69:27 - uh X1 which has a range between 0 and
69:28 - one to between Zer and width and by the
69:32 - way I could just multiply it by width
69:34 - but I'm keeping the map function in here
69:36 - because you might have a very different
69:39 - scale why uh y1 is the same thing but go
69:44 - from height down to zero and then we're
69:47 - going to do the same thing for X2 and
69:52 - Y2 are you asleep yet uh and now now
69:55 - we're going to draw so we're going to
69:56 - calculate those values map them to
69:59 - pixels and then draw the line and so
70:01 - let's uh in the draw function let's have
70:04 - draw a
70:07 - line so now oops a I have an error line
70:12 - 50 oops I got I guess I have an extra
70:15 - bracket
70:16 - somehow oops Y 2 is not defined a draw a
70:19 - line where did I mess up here uh oops
70:23 - this should be Y2 thank you very much
70:26 - there so you can see there's the line so
70:29 - I mean that's what the line is always
70:30 - going to be so now I know that if I have
70:33 - the m and the B for the formula for a
70:36 - line I can visually represent that line
70:39 - now all I need to do
70:42 - is use this formula here to calculate m
70:47 - and b based on the actual X and Y values
70:50 - let's do that okay so let's remind
70:54 - ourselves so let's do let's write a
70:56 - function and let's call it linear
70:59 - regression oh and I wanted to talk about
71:01 - where the term regression comes from
71:03 - this French thing and it's regression to
71:06 - the mean you can look it up um okay so
71:09 - uh what are we going to do well one
71:11 - thing we know we definitely know need to
71:13 - know if you
71:15 - so time out I forgot to mention in the
71:18 - beginning of this video I I forgot to
71:20 - mention in this
71:23 - uh I forgot to mention in this video
71:26 - that the beginning that you should watch
71:28 - the previous
71:30 - one how can I correct
71:34 - that we'll splice something in there
71:36 - somebody remind me at the end I'll
71:38 - record us me saying that for sentence
71:39 - and Mato will splice that in there
71:43 - okay okay so if we look at the formula
71:46 - and this I went through all of this from
71:48 - the previous uh in the previous video um
71:51 - where I talked about this formula
71:53 - something that I really need is xar and
71:55 - and Y Bar and xar is the mean or the
71:58 - average of all the X values and Y Bar is
72:01 - the mean of all the yv values so adding
72:03 - them all up together dividing by the
72:05 - total number so I might as well uh add
72:08 - those up I mean get calculate those
72:10 - first so the first thing I want to do is
72:12 - say uh X sum equals
72:15 - zero and we're going to go through all
72:17 - of the data we're going to iterate over
72:19 - all of the
72:21 - data uh y sum equals z we're going to
72:25 - say x sum plus equals data index
72:31 - i.x y sum plus equals data in that so
72:36 - we're adding up all of the X values and
72:38 - all the Y values and then we're going to
72:40 - say x mean equals x sum divided by data.
72:46 - length and the same thing for the y mean
72:49 - so this is for this is the average so we
72:52 - now have the average of all the X values
72:54 - and the average of all the Y values now
72:57 - what we need to do is we need to
72:59 - calculate the numerator and the
73:02 - denominator let's do the numerator
73:06 - first so the numerator is so first I
73:09 - need to I'm going to have to sum up some
73:12 - stuff here so uh what am I first I
73:14 - definitely need to Loop through all the
73:17 - data but we doing a lot of looping
73:18 - through all the data so I'm going to say
73:21 - numerator equals zero so the numerator
73:23 - is going to add up all together
73:27 - each data points x minus x mean
73:33 - times each data points and you know what
73:36 - I'm going to do I'm GNA just use some
73:39 - extra variables here which I
73:42 - think will make things a little
73:45 - cleaner uh just so we can look at the
73:47 - formula this is now the
73:52 - numerator right this is ex exactly this
73:55 - is in code right here exactly what's
73:59 - written in the formula here it's adding
74:02 - up all of the X's minus the average of
74:05 - x's and all the Y's minus the average of
74:07 - y's multiplied
74:10 - together okay so we've got that and now
74:13 - all we need to do is we also we might as
74:15 - well do the denominator at the same time
74:17 - why not right denominator can I say Deen
74:21 - for that we're going to add
74:24 - up the denominator is x - x mean * x - x
74:31 - mean it's just that added up squared and
74:36 - then m equals oh m
74:41 - equals uh numerator divided by
74:44 - denominator whoops
74:47 - denominator so let's think about this
74:49 - could we have an issue where the
74:52 - denominator is zero you know it's
75:31 - [Music]
75:55 - if there's this is only worth doing if
75:57 - there's more than one uh data point so I
76:01 - think we should say here in
76:04 - um so whereas in
76:07 - draw we're going to say if data. length
76:11 - is greater than
76:12 - one
76:16 - then calculate the linear
76:20 - regression and draw the line all right
76:23 - let's give this a try
76:27 - hey look at that that was
76:30 - amazing nothing ever works in the first
76:34 - try uh this kind of makes sense right
76:38 - you can see I can add a bunch of points
76:40 - and it's always fitting that line to the
76:43 - points this is linear regression
76:46 - interactive linear regression in the
76:47 - browser is probably not anything I
76:49 - should be too excited about but it's
76:51 - making me happy right now time out for a
76:54 - second
76:57 - um uh oh what's known as perfect
77:01 - colinearity the problem with when you
77:02 - guys write useful pieces of information
77:04 - in the chat is I see them like 30
77:06 - seconds or a minute later because I'm in
77:08 - the future and I cannot I don't know
77:10 - what um what relates to what I'm G
77:14 - there's more that I need to talk about
77:15 - in this video I just want to take a
77:16 - break for a
77:21 - second if all the X values are zero then
77:24 - m equals z
77:33 - yeah okay um so now what I want to talk
77:37 - about
77:39 - is model
77:42 - checking this is really
77:47 - um
77:50 - uh this is a really useful K weekman
77:52 - also pointed this out to me so okay so
77:56 - which I want to talk about
77:58 - here uh when all the X's are equal
78:01 - that's perfect
78:04 - collinearity perfect
78:10 - collinearity
78:12 - uh
78:14 - yeah all
78:16 - right boy all these thing all this stuff
78:18 - o look at this you guys should be
78:20 - watching this YouTube video I'm sure
78:21 - it's much better than anything I could
78:23 - possibly ever make o what is an example
78:25 - of perfect multic
78:29 - colinearity uh okay maybe I shouldn't
78:32 - read stack Overflow during my live
78:34 - stream okay so the thing that I want to
78:36 - talk about now and I'm going to bring
78:40 - up
78:42 - um week.
78:45 - github.io ml what's the URL for um K
78:49 - weekman what's the URL for your um
78:53 - sandbox maybe it is yes linear
78:55 - regression
78:57 - great so I think I'm gonna just use this
79:00 - as a demonstration if you don't mind um
79:04 - I will of course credit you and put a
79:05 - link to it in the video
79:07 - description but
79:11 - um
79:13 - yeah uh
79:17 - okay all
79:19 - right okay so somehow I need to get back
79:24 - so I need to get back in to this video
79:27 - tutorial talking about does linear
79:30 - regression actually make
79:33 - sense and then uh and look at um talk
79:38 - about model
79:39 - checking and the term sort of residual
79:42 - plot is
79:43 - useful
79:45 - um and
79:48 - uh um and then um look at anscombs
79:53 - quartet and just kind of like finish up
79:55 - and give some people some ideas of
79:56 - things you could
79:57 - try and then I need to remember a meant
80:00 - to splice something in where I say
80:02 - something about watching the previous
80:05 - video
80:07 - uh sorry here's the um MAA is asking for
80:10 - this is if anyone can't find this is the
80:12 - URL someone wants to post this in the
80:14 - chat okay people are still talking about
80:17 - temperature I can't wait for the YouTube
80:19 - comments on my uh Fahrenheit versus
80:22 - Celsius Kelvin maybe I should just do
80:23 - everything in Kelvin
80:25 - is there like an esir equivalent of
80:26 - espiranto I guess maybe okay let me get
80:30 - out of this right now
80:39 - okay okay so this this video is really
80:42 - complete we see that I have this linear
80:44 - regression that's uh calculated now
80:47 - here's the thing what can you do with
80:48 - this so first of all you might think of
80:50 - some more interesting interactive ways
80:52 - of playing with the data whether it's
80:53 - being able to click move these points
80:55 - around drag and drop um randomize all
80:58 - the points I'm sure you could come up
80:59 - with some more interactive possibilities
81:02 - but one thing that I think is really
81:03 - important to talk about is whether it
81:06 - actually makes sense to use linear
81:09 - regression a linear regression model for
81:11 - your data and one way you know there's
81:14 - lots of reasons why this could be a why
81:17 - why you might not want to first of all
81:20 - um you know simple do I dare erase this
81:24 - and just come over here simple way to
81:28 - sort of talk about this is you know
81:30 - let's what if this is a plot of my data
81:34 - well you can see I could apply a linear
81:36 - regression to this and I'm going to get
81:38 - a line that maybe looks something like
81:39 - this forgot my multicolored marker and
81:42 - I'm off let me try that
81:44 - again I'm off I'm
81:47 - off I I said no more Mulligans but I'm
81:50 - gonna give myself a mulligan
81:52 - here except I I can't fake erase it
81:56 - continuity
81:57 - error put it back what's the chance oh
82:01 - it's got all
82:04 - the I'm trying to recreate my
82:07 - drawing which is kind of sad for a
82:12 - variety of
82:13 - reasons someone's gonna notice
82:16 - this oh yeah and it was like D I forgot
82:19 - that I had like x0 X X1 but I'm I'm too
82:23 - far gone now I I have to continue this
82:26 - d0 this should be like X1 D1 whatever
82:29 - okay D2 okay close enough no one will
82:32 - notice because I'm going to walk over
82:33 - and erase it
82:38 - momentarily
82:41 - uh okay let's try this
82:45 - again okay so let's look let's think
82:47 - about a scenario where you wouldn't um
82:52 - you where you wouldn't uh sorry here I
82:53 - am where you wouldn't want to use uh
82:55 - linear regression so what if your data
82:58 - happened to kind of
83:00 - look like this so I could fit this
83:04 - trying to get better at the multicolor I
83:06 - could fit this with a line and I might
83:08 - still get even like the same sort of
83:10 - line but actually if we really looked at
83:12 - this data I could see that ah you know
83:15 - what this data I could fit a curve to
83:17 - this data I could fit something like y =
83:22 - MX2 + b or even
83:25 - plus you know m0 x^2 + M1 * x + B and
83:30 - I'm probably using the wrong I should I
83:32 - should start using uh this is B 0 B1 B
83:37 - B2 right so you I could essentially
83:39 - create a polynomial formula a formula
83:42 - that has not just X but X squar and
83:45 - maybe X cubed or x to the 4th power and
83:47 - I'm actually going to look at that in a
83:49 - future video um U so I will do a video
83:52 - where I do polinomial regression I'm
83:53 - just going to use a Javas SCP library
83:55 - that hasn't built into it so just to
83:56 - sort of demonstrate the idea but this is
83:58 - something that I might want to do and
84:00 - what's interesting about linear
84:01 - regression and this um this has been
84:04 - demonstrated there's a famous data set
84:08 - whoops anscom oncome anybody know how to
84:12 - pronounce
84:15 - that
84:18 - uh
84:22 - um there's a well-known famous data set
84:26 - called encom's quartet where let's look
84:29 - I'm going to look at these four
84:31 - graphs each one of these has the same
84:35 - exact linear regression line right you
84:38 - can see that with this data the line is
84:40 - the same but does this does this line
84:43 - really make sense well for this one it
84:45 - kind of does right you can see that it's
84:47 - a nice approximation of the data with
84:49 - this one it does but you can see it's
84:50 - kind of off because there's just an
84:52 - anomaly and maybe we should build
84:53 - something into our model to account for
84:56 - that anomaly or this one over here even
84:58 - though linear regression has that same
85:00 - line it's actually we you could figure
85:02 - out that we could use a polinomial
85:04 - function to estimate that and here we
85:06 - got some kind of like crazy nonsense
85:07 - where we have all the same X values so
85:09 - this is an important thing to realize
85:11 - that linear regression is not some kind
85:13 - of magic it's not a recipe for all data
85:16 - for all inputs and outputs but it is a
85:19 - simple model that will work for a lot of
85:21 - data data that is linear um one way to
85:26 - evaluate whether or not the linear model
85:29 - is useful for your uh data set is to
85:32 - look at something called the
85:34 - residuals and um uh uh coding train
85:38 - viewer extraordinary k weekman um you
85:41 - can go to kwon's GitHub kweek man.
85:44 - GitHub I'll include a link to this in
85:46 - the video description created a much
85:47 - more sophisticated demonstration this is
85:50 - the same exact idea I can move these
85:52 - points around um
85:55 - and I can kind of uh I can randomize
85:57 - them and I can see the same linear
85:59 - regression but what this is showing is a
86:01 - residual plot the residual plot shows
86:05 - the magnitude of the difference from the
86:08 - line to the data point for each and
86:10 - every data point and if and we can
86:12 - actually uh that the anscom uh data is
86:15 - built into this and you can see this
86:17 - makes sense if you have a kind of random
86:20 - residual plot that's a good sign if you
86:23 - have a highly patter pattern residual
86:25 - plot then it's most likely that some
86:27 - other model could be useful for your
86:29 - regression so something you might
86:30 - consider doing as an exercise is
86:33 - researching more about different data
86:35 - sets uh trying to implement I mean you
86:37 - could find K weekman code on GitHub as
86:39 - well but try to make your own residual
86:42 - plot from my scatter plot code um uh and
86:46 - what other types of interactive features
86:47 - for importing or using different data
86:49 - sets uh what other colorful and creative
86:52 - ways can you explore visual Iz in the
86:55 - process of linear regression okay so
86:57 - thanks for watching this video I'm going
86:58 - to do a couple more videos on this topic
87:01 - number uh I'm going to uh look at
87:03 - polinomial regression with a JavaScript
87:05 - library and then I'm going to use a
87:08 - different technique to calculate a
87:10 - linear aggression known as gradient
87:11 - descent and the main reason I want to do
87:14 - that is gradient descent as opposed to
87:16 - this least squares methodology I used
87:19 - here is a fundamental method for neural
87:21 - network-based learning uh for a a learn
87:24 - learning method for neural network based
87:25 - systems so we're going to do that for
87:27 - linear regression which will set us up
87:29 - well for neural network stuff
87:32 - later um okay
87:36 - uh what what did I uh
87:41 - Miss I didn't say goodbye yet because I
87:44 - was sure I missed something how was that
87:45 - K weekman did I do did I did I get at
87:48 - the sort of essence of some of the stuff
87:50 - that you mentioned in the slack Channel
87:51 - earlier today that I about model
87:53 - checking and the residual
87:55 - plot um um I would love any feedback
87:59 - from anybody before I put a bow on this
88:02 - uh two video linear regression
88:15 - thing as always I always forget the this
88:17 - dot
88:19 - this do
88:23 - this
88:27 - I was off
88:28 - camera when I was drawing the polinomial
88:31 - but that was probably fine somebody can
88:32 - CGI me back in right how hard could that
88:35 - be somebody by the way said they wanted
88:38 - more green screen footage of me on
88:39 - Twitter the other day so uh here we
88:46 - go I don't know I don't know what I'm
88:48 - supposed to do but I I like it when I
88:50 - I'm yeah anyway okay there we go
88:52 - there uh okay come back here um all
88:56 - right uh indeed short and clear good you
88:59 - know this isn't a course on
89:02 - statistics I don't know what this is but
89:04 - it's the you know I'm trying to give
89:05 - some background and some basic steps so
89:07 - hopefully um uh people got the idea here
89:10 - okay so oh the Whiteboard content well
89:14 - let me look back
89:21 - oops was there some part over here that
89:24 - is
89:25 - not was not usable oh CU I drew down
89:28 - here
89:29 - no I think it was okay right so
89:33 - hopefully it's okay I was getting some
89:35 - messages that there was maybe a missing
89:36 - part but
89:38 - um okay
89:41 - uh somebody said once I start doing uh
89:44 - somebody made a YouTube comment that
89:45 - once I start doing
89:47 - es6 we have a whole new super super the
89:51 - super song never forget the super
89:55 - uh okay at the top oh that part is not
90:00 - visible I see it okay
90:04 - um yeah the hey Okay uh all right so
90:08 - what do we've got ah let me I don't know
90:10 - what this is going to do but
90:21 - um so this will get split somehow
90:26 - um so I'm just gonna say oh let's try
90:30 - this before I begin coding I just wanted
90:32 - to mention if you just jumped into this
90:34 - video I walk through a full explanation
90:37 - of what linear regression is and the
90:38 - formula that I'm about to use in the
90:41 - previous video so check this video's
90:42 - description to a link to that preious
90:44 - previous video otherwise keep watching
90:45 - I'm going to get started
90:48 - coding um will that work justplay thin I
90:52 - hope that does
90:55 - all right it is 5:50 p.m. so I let's
91:00 - let's review where I got to today I got
91:03 - through half of
91:07 - this I got through half of this um so
91:12 - tomorrow I think I'm going to do
91:17 - now I hope that I have some time
91:19 - tomorrow the schedule is a little bit
91:21 - tricky um but and it would if I were to
91:25 - live stream tomorrow it would be
91:27 - somewhere in
91:29 - the 2 to 5:00 p.m probably range I
91:33 - definitely have to be done by 5 and I
91:35 - probably can't start any earlier than
91:37 - two so somewhere in that range of time
91:40 - I'm going to try to live stream and I
91:42 - will cover these two last
91:46 - pieces okay so I have about uh 5 to 10
91:50 - minutes before I have to go so I will
91:53 - try to see if I can answer a few
91:55 - questions um
91:57 - or um oh oh I know what I need to
92:00 - mention shoot I should have done this at
92:02 - the
92:03 - beginning always forget well better late
92:06 - than never um where am I going to find
92:09 - information about this let me go to the
92:11 - coding train
92:14 - Reddit um okay
92:18 - so there's all sorts of things on here
92:20 - there's a coding train oh the look maybe
92:22 - I can find some more questions here
92:24 - maybe I'll try to post another oh I'm in
92:25 - the wrong screen there's um uh okay so
92:29 - somebody set up uh a coding train
92:34 - Discord and
92:37 - because I'm old and out of it I have no
92:40 - idea what Discord is but I wonder if I
92:43 - should get used to it so I wanted to
92:45 - mention it I guess it is uh an
92:47 - unofficial chat talking platform for
92:50 - people who are interested um so you can
92:52 - click maybe I'll try to join it look at
92:54 - it I'm using slack for the uh people who
92:57 - support my channel through patreon but
92:59 - you know I'm always interested in other
93:01 - platforms especially if they're open
93:02 - source and flexible not that slack is
93:05 - but um anyway uh so I wanted to mention
93:08 - that that Discord server exists so
93:11 - please join that Community if you're
93:12 - interested or find that to be nice and
93:14 - interesting um I also trying to figure
93:17 - out a good way to uh receive questions
93:20 - so I was trying to make a question
93:22 - thread for each week which I did two
93:25 - weeks ago what's today but I didn't make
93:28 - one maybe I'll make one for tomorrow but
93:30 - let's see if there are any new questions
93:32 - on
93:33 - here um I think I answered some of these
93:38 - already yeah yeah I answered most of
93:41 - these already last time so maybe I'll
93:43 - try to make a new question thread and ah
93:46 - um okay but in the chat from G4 m34 G4
93:50 - M3 m4n
93:52 - i4c in the slack Channel asks are you
93:55 - going to do some tensor flow yes so
93:59 - again if you want to know what's
94:00 - upcoming this summer uh everything is uh
94:05 - here so I've actually made all the
94:07 - examples and done quite a few and
94:09 - written up some readmes with
94:11 - supplemental links I intend to make
94:12 - videos for every single topic that's
94:15 - here and hopefully more and you can see
94:17 - that when I get to convolutional neural
94:19 - networks and recurrent neural networks
94:21 - I'm going to use tensor flow for that um
94:24 - I am however using currently in my
94:26 - examples um Caris which is a little bit
94:29 - which is a higher a layer on top of
94:31 - tensorflow to make it a bit easier
94:33 - higher level uh to so that's what I'm uh
94:37 - planning to use at the
94:39 - moment
94:41 - um I have no idea what cotlin is is
94:44 - there a thread to submit video IDE ideas
94:47 - yes and no I mean there is one um I've
94:50 - been using a GitHub repository oops um
94:53 - it's under the coding train GitHub
94:56 - rainbow topics and issues and what I do
94:59 - you can see people are suggesting um I
95:02 - think I'm going to do Tetris by the way
95:04 - I thought of somebody originally
95:05 - suggested Tetris and was like and I sort
95:07 - of thought that's kind of impossible
95:08 - then I saw siraj doing something with
95:11 - Tetris uh on his YouTube channel um and
95:14 - I was thinking oh I could do Tetris um
95:17 - so this summer my plan is to keep some
95:20 - momentum with the machine learning stuff
95:22 - but I would like to ALS also pepper in
95:24 - just kind of random coding challenges I
95:27 - want to do the dragon curve people have
95:28 - been suggesting other games like maybe
95:30 - Tetris so you know I might do sort of an
95:33 - every other week type thing like I'll do
95:34 - some machine learning stuff and then
95:35 - next week some just goofy generative art
95:38 - or game stuff and then come back to
95:40 - machine learning stuff and I'm also
95:42 - hoping to schedule a whole bunch of
95:44 - guests I need to get working on
95:46 - that uh
95:48 - okay uh let's see any other questions
95:51 - I'm going to play my goodbye
95:55 - song somebody could find this song on
95:57 - Sound no I think I got it off the it's
96:00 - very
96:02 - loud uh I think I got it off of
96:07 - um
96:09 - the uh I think I got it on like free
96:11 - music archive once when I searched for
96:13 - rainbow and like public
96:16 - domain uh Game of Life I do sodoku
96:20 - solver would be interesting game of life
96:21 - has been requested a lot I have a bunch
96:23 - of videos tutorials on Game of Life that
96:25 - I made sort of in uh processing back in
96:27 - the day guess I could do it again maybe
96:30 - that would be a good processing
96:32 - challenge um to do just to program it
96:35 - from scratch and just kind of do it I'd
96:37 - be happy to do
96:39 - that
96:41 - um I lowered the audio hopefully it's
96:44 - okay off the music
96:47 - yeah
96:50 - uh thank you guys I I I don't know why
96:52 - this it's really hard about doing these
96:54 - live streams and I used to feel more
96:56 - comfortable with this um and I think
96:59 - especially when I'm doing this more
97:01 - technical stuff math-based stuff that's
97:04 - really almost like I'm supposed to be
97:05 - teaching something real rather than just
97:07 - like coding up something fun not that
97:09 - those two things need to be mutally
97:10 - exclusive I really feel a bit lost into
97:13 - how it's going so hopefully people found
97:15 - today
97:16 - useful
97:19 - um oh you know what I think we should do
97:22 - it's night time for a lot of
97:25 - you let's take a little break here for a
97:29 - second it's been a
97:34 - while since we read it's probably way
97:37 - too
97:39 - loud from the coding train story book a
97:42 - million random digits with 100,000
97:45 - normal
97:45 - [Music]
97:50 - deviates previously on the coding train
97:56 - 5439
98:00 - 7,845 okay that was the previously now
98:03 - it's the now I don't know
98:07 - 75821 10,38 oh no no that's yeah yeah
98:13 - 59767
98:17 - 46323
98:22 - 61,800 an interesting random number 92
98:25 - 962 next week next time on the coding
98:29 - train oh my lby let's just try this
98:33 - music next time on the coding train
98:35 - we're going to read some gussian
98:39 - deviates 820
98:43 - 225 925 1.
98:46 - 514
98:47 - 2741 31
98:51 - 1.09 949
98:55 - 336
98:56 - 449 378 I just read one of the numbers
99:00 - will anybody ever know I'm on page
99:02 - 127 okay
99:05 - [Music]
99:13 - uh I feel like I could do all this
99:15 - nonsense at the end um something else
99:18 - that I wanted to
99:21 - read is um
99:25 - I thought that I would um try to read
99:28 - you guys some quotes from this book it's
99:30 - called in her own words uh red Burns was
99:34 - the uh founder uh of ITP um she was a
99:38 - mentor to me and she would open every
99:41 - year for all the students um here's a
99:43 - picture of red um a presentation in her
99:47 - class with uh and this book is um
99:51 - actually I'll just read this you most
99:53 - alumni remember the first day of the
99:54 - applications class Red's class because
99:57 - of the slides she showed to open the
99:58 - school year the words are an
100:00 - encapsulation of her philosophy and her
100:02 - hopes for ITP students they are words to
100:04 - live by and also words for us to all
100:06 - remember read here she is in her own
100:08 - words so I thought that periodically I
100:11 - would also read to you some quotes from
100:15 - this book maybe I would do one per
100:17 - week um even though I could just do all
100:20 - of them and they kind of are nice in
100:21 - sequence I could pick a random one or I
100:23 - could just just read you the first one
100:24 - we I'll read these in order so today's
100:26 - quote from Red is as you come together
100:31 - depend on each other okay so that's my
100:35 - word this
100:37 - episode was brought to you by the letter
100:39 - the quote anyway um so that's one quote
100:44 - I will come back tomorrow and I will
100:46 - read you another one and maybe someday
100:48 - somebody could splice the all of these
100:49 - things together um okay uh what else
100:54 - else do I need today let's just let's
100:58 - listen to the this dot
101:01 - song as always I always forget the this
101:03 - dot do do do see if there's any more
101:10 - questions
101:14 - [Music]
101:20 - do all right everybody thank you all for
101:25 - watching and um I I hopefully will be
101:29 - back tomorrow I'm not guaranteeing that
101:31 - at this point but it is a uh this is
101:34 - probably loud it is a plan that I hope
101:36 - to have I will certainly be back next
101:39 - week um over the summer um you know I'm
101:42 - kind of the commitment I've made is to
101:44 - try to do uh a live stream every week
101:48 - and you know there periods of time
101:49 - during the year this summer in
101:50 - particular where I'm going to be
101:51 - traveling for a week or two I'm
101:53 - traveling for a week in June two weeks
101:55 - in July two weeks in August so there
101:57 - will certainly be some weeks where I'm
101:59 - not U making videos but I'm I'm hoping
102:02 - that they're going to be because it's a
102:03 - summer and I'm not I don't have classes
102:04 - at NYU right now or there'll be some
102:06 - weeks that I live stream twice and um
102:08 - this is a week that I'm hoping to do
102:09 - that I'm hoping to be back tomorrow at
102:10 - least for another hour because I want to
102:12 - get through all of this stuff so that
102:15 - song ended already okay so thanks for
102:18 - watching
102:20 - um and I will see you guys maybe
102:23 - tomorrow in a future live stream I
102:25 - appreciate your support uh and your kind
102:28 - words and your constructive criticism
102:30 - and feedback always uh enjoy your
102:33 - coating also go outside give somebody a
102:35 - hug and enjoy some nature uh breathe in
102:38 - smell the flowers not don't get too
102:41 - close especially if you're allergic to
102:43 - anything that's like in the flower you
102:46 - know that sort of thing okay see you
102:48 - guys goodbye um uh this video this live
102:51 - stream will be available as an archive
102:53 - soon soon enough okay goodbye oh that
102:55 - doesn't turn off till I click this
102:57 - buttton

Cleaned transcript:

hello good afternoon good morning good evening uh this is the coding train with me Daniel oh I said Daniel sometimes I say Dan sometimes I say Daniel every once in a while somebody calls me Danny which I always kind of enjoy although that's never really been my name um it's a Thursday afternoon it is May it's May right uh May 25th it's around 420 p.m. eastern time I am live from New York City on the coding train and um this is a semiweekly sometimes whenever I have some time uh show thing stream internet television education space type thing where I uh do some coding tutorials and coding challenges and answer questions and a variety of other things that I end up feeling like doing while broadcasting Live on YouTube so welcome thank you for tuning in uh I am playing some lovely music by the great Adam Blau in the background I think I will fade it out now um as you know I enjoy having uh music sometimes in the background so if you have any suggestions or things that you're working on that you want to send my way uh please do okay so what's going to happen today um looks like um everybody is here and I'm not seeing any complaints about sound or visuals um so I am going to return today to my machine learning I don't I'm I'm trying to avoid using the word syllabus I feel like syllabus and YouTube do not go together let me try a different word I'm going to return to my machine learning list silly bus would actually work quite well s i l l ybos my machine learning Silly Bus um and uh let's let me figure out where I left off uh this course lended many weeks ago but I'm still trying to make video materials for it uh and I'm I think I'm here in uh week three so um the topic that I have for today is linear regression uh so um for those of you who are watching this late at night perhaps you're curled up with some candle light and some herbal tea and you have a nice book beside you and you're playing some soothing classical music music this will also put you to sleep almost definitely um but um what I want to do today is look at everything that I'm doing is leading up to uh building a neural network program from scratch in JavaScript and in processing which is Java one of these environments and so a I have some steps along the way that I want to do so um previously I looked at just kind of a overview of what machine learning is we looked at uh K near neighbor algorithm and how to do a similarity score between two data points and today I want to look at this idea of I have a data set and I want to fit a model what does it mean to fit a model to the data set for us for today that model is going to be a straight line and we're going to be able to calculate that model calculate where we should draw that straight line with maths um yes I'm an American who likes to say maths I don't know if that makes me pretentious or the opposite of pretentious but that's just who I am um so uh emra in the chat asks why JavaScript for a neural network uh I don't have a good reason for that in fact it's a terrible idea to program a neural network in JavaScript but I'm going to do that anyway because I like to run Demos in the browser and kind of get my hands in the code and JavaScript is a language that I am kind of working with I will however I do intend to do some tutorials as we dig down further if I keep going on my silly bus um that eventually I'm going to start once uh I'm going to start looking at uh something called tensorflow and something called Caris and those will require us to spin up some python code that I will then talk to from JavaScript and actually I guess my reason is one of the things that I'm trying to do is always have a visual uh animated or interactive component to what it is that I'm building um and and that's just sort of arbitrary constraint that I give myself in the hopes that people will take that and make all sorts of more creative and beautiful and interesting things from it okay um okay sing the audio by the way I I get this me I get this a lot my audio is out of sync so for whatever reason I think when the audio is out of sync it's not me it's you or it is me can I I'm trying to thow I can't throw I'm trying to throw my voice in a way that I could maybe make the Audio I can't do it audio out of think um and I hear that if you refresh the page sometimes that fixes it the good news is I am recording everything I'm doing to disk and um everything that I do today will be published separately as individual video tutorial chunks okay so uh the coding train is brought to you by wait a sec do I have it's not brought to you by anything brought to you by me but it is here with the support of the patrons so I would like to start by saying a thank you to the patrons of the coding train if you would like to join the patron program you can go to patreon com/ coding Trin and uh you can uh with a uh you can pledge and uh um with a pledge comes membership to a slack Channel and other rewards they'll send you a book or making tshirts and things like that you can also support the coding Train by going to storeen coding train. uh storenvy.com if you would like to buy some coding train merchandise okay uh got those things out of the way now um typically even though there's no typically because I'm kind of all over the place I like to do these live streams on Fridays I like to have an opening segments where I share work from the community or answer some questions that were posted on Reddit I'm not prepared for any of that stuff today so I think I'm just going to launch right into the material and start talking it through and making examples uh so um but if I I'm hoping that perhaps I will be back tomorrow on Friday at some point for a kind of regular coding Train episode where maybe I'll be able to do some sharing of work from the community and answering some questions um okay so I got okay uh Rick Van de Brock in the chat asks why won't you make more native JavaScript tutorials without p5js I have been getting this question a lot I'm trying to think I must I need something to help me think can I have some meditation music This is actually my new debugging music I'm debugging I'm I'm trying to to breathe deeply to think about why is it that I don't make vanilla JavaScript tutorials without p5js um I don't have a good answer to that question um I think there's a lot of value in uh writing code from without libraries and dependencies I think there's a lot of value in writing code with libraries and dependencies um and I am not not opposed uh to doing um tutorials in JavaScript without p5js and I I do periodically do stuff with node uh server side programming uh in JavaScript I'm using just plain old node and some node packages as well I suppose the you know the answer I have to that question is that p5js as part of the processing Foundation is a project that I'm just personally invested in uh it's a project it's a open source it's a piece of Open Source software that I care about that think hope is bringing good things to the world and I would like to support it and explore it and teach with it um it also I find it nice to be able to skip past some of the gobble deg that is uh dat of JavaScript and be able to in a more succinct way draw and animate and p5js I believe is a good platform for that but I do it that you know um there are areas where p5js does not have certain functionality and um I am not opposed to at some point trying looking at doing tutorials with Native JavaScript a better question a better question might be why aren't you programming using es6 syntax and then maybe you're thinking to yourself what is es6 syntax and I think I've talked about this before this is something that I need to come to grips with I'm looking something ominous why don't I program with es6 I think I need to I think it's time I think it's what people are using I think it's like already like 3 years old there's some parts of it that make me somewhat uncomfortable um like uh the fact that there's like an equal sign and greater than and that means function and there's some kind of like stuff um but I do think in particular that the class Syntax for doing objectoriented programming matches um classical objectoriented programming envir uh languages it's more a makes more sense it's a little less awkward I would like to start doing that and I am thinking about uh this fall starting over and doing all of my beginner learn to program from scratch in JavaScript tutorials uh using es6 syntax uh with possibly with P5 Jets this might be a this might be a great idea it might be a terrible idea I look forward to hearing your feedback uh but today I will be still using my old es5 syntax don't throw if only you could throw internet Tomatoes at me that would maybe I can build up some sort of like node.js socket connected catapult system by which you could be watching the live stream and pressing a button and tomatoes could be flung at me or candy popcorn no popcorn's not good I don't know flowers something or tomatoes whatever okay what's happening now I'm looking at the chat okay uh let's see here um I see some tomato emojis in the chat wonderful okay uh oh if you didn't see today um I released uh a compilation video of um I'm just going to oh look at this I'm live uh I encourage you to check out this uh video from itp's uh 2017 spring show I did a live stream where I interviewed students showed their projects ITP is the graduate program here at New York University where I teach fulltime and uh if you want to check out what students are doing here uh check out this video here I'm I'm like promoting my own videos in my video which is a little bit of a problem uh I did a most recently a mind sweeper coding challenge that was quite a bit of fun uh if you I've made a variation of Mind sweeper uh you should go to uh because maybe I can show some of these tomorrow uh or next week depending on when I come back next if you go to Rainbow code uh under coding challenges and then if I scroll down here all the way to the bottom uh to mind sweeper there is a read me here oh look there's already some so let's look at um this is oh I can't see this is just repository so I don't have demo uh and this is just ported to tight scripts look let's look at this one uh right here oh canvas uh let's look at this and we have look at this o I love it so some some color some new interface stuff ability to change the width and height a timer new game button and by the way one thing I really missed in my mind sweeper coding challenge which I'm so sad about was that the way that mind sweeper works is it's designed in such a way that you can never by accident click on a bomb as your first click and I I made this B sweeper click on a b to get stung um you can and the way that that's done is you click on a cell and then all the bees are placed and the part where you click is not included as a possibility so I should have done that um there okay so I think now we are ready to start getting into linear regression or linear regression yeah um all right so what do I want to do here let's put on Symphony 40 and let's get set up here so I need to so okay so let's think about this okay um mind sweeper will work let's put this oh no session three that's where we are I'm in session three uh and I'm going to grab this similarity score and we're going to say uh L regression and get R movies. Json we're going to open up the adom text editor uh Tom in the chat makes an excellent point which is this whole class thing in es6 is just syntactic this is very hard to say syntactic Sugar by the way that would be a good name for a song syntactic Sugar um there's a wonderful discussion going on okay I got to not look at the discussion it's sometimes very distracting okay so now what I need to do is open this up in the atom editor know why this always runs oh okay see what happens here okay all right so now I have some code running I need to run a server uh and I'm going to go to the desktop session three and I'm going to run a little web server so I can see my code in the browser um and come here and open up a console okay by the way I haven't programmed this before I did read an article an online article about linear aggression and look up the formul but that's you know I don't really know what I'm doing here so just be aware you're tuning into someone who's giving you a tutorial about stuff that he just looked at earlier this afternoon this is how I this is how I do it okay uh so I think we're ready this is definitely going to require some serious whiteboard time it's whiteboard time that work no here we go um okay so I'm just testing this out over here you can still see and hear me I am talking to you the people of the internet welcome and so now let me think about this on the one hand so what I'm going to do is use a statistical approach to calculate a linear aggression for a twodimensional data set um and the reason I'm doing this is to just look at the idea of how you you know what is machine learning it's sort of matching inputs to outputs um and then making a prediction based on an existing data so I'm really sort of setting the context and if we look at linear regression which is just in this sort of simple 2D space it'll give us give us a sort of framework for discussing systems with models with many many many many many many parameters and ultimately even though we can do linear regression with a statistical approach we could also do it with something called gradient descent so here are the videos what is linear linear regression and ordinary least squares and what is the math for it then make a simple code example that does that making a list here should I make this list um what is linear regression uh one is linear aggression uh and then we're also going to talk about ordinary least squares method then I also want to talk about model checking and other methods then we want to look at um Bo is this off the camera can can the camera see that it cannot wait I have a way of fixing this the camera can turn it's amazing um then I want to look at uh polynomial regression and for this I think I'm going to use a JS library and then we're going to get into a gradient descent so I question whether any of this is really uh necessary or worthwhile because in many ways I don't know I mean it's all interesting and learning is good and uh um but um you know it is important to say hydrated we do know that so the question is because ultimately I could just jump right into looking at a perceptron and I could use gadient descent with a perceptron but I think this will give us some language and some background and some Theory to help us have more of a foundation for when we get into some of the neural networkbased machine learning stuff do you agree I think that's the case so this is my list uh it is 440 p.m. um and I expect I would like to get through I would like to get through all of this by the end of tomorrow so this week being today and tomorrow I don't know exactly when is I'm to fit in time to come back to to stream live tomorrow but I'm hoping to and so I will get through some amount of this today hopefully at least the sort of first two possibly the first three uh any questions I just like to said so any questions or suggestions or thoughts before um before I get started uh okay yeah I'm just I'm just reading through the chat right now uh all right I'm just seeing um great okay so I didn't see any questions that I'm going to tackle at this very moment so um I expect that that this so if you haven't watched my live streams before what happens is I kind of fumble my way through a lot of stuff and um then uh later it gets edited down to a shorter tutorial video I expect that this these are going to involve quite a bit of editing because I think I'm going to have to like look stuff up and find things maybe a diagram an image kind of as I go and I'm happy to take uh from the chat the writing on the board is a little smaller than usual I thought I noticed that as well well um sorry let me check on that in a second so I might have to um so if you have suggestions or thoughts um uh please post them in the chat if you're a patron and are in the slack Channel um that's a little bit easier for me to follow so in particular if there a good point or question or thought from the YouTube chat if one of you who's in both could copy that into the slack chat that would be great okay uh let me look at the the is the writing smaller is my handwriting just smaller or is it actually smaller I wonder if I zoomed how how is this can you read that a bit too small I'm seeing from some folks it's pretty small it's a little small lots of opinions on the size of the writing now I I have a feeling that I I realized I haven't been in here since uh I think one of these is like a zoom look at that uh that is to I feel like that seems too zoomed in so let me zoom out a little more maybe that's a little bit better that just where it was at the beginning uh problem is you guys are 20 seconds behind me perfect out of is it out of focus that's just like the beginning write bigger oh what a novel idea I'm gonna just zoom in a little bit I'm going to try to get a little bit more there we go that's makes it a little bit bigger the question is the focus how's the focus okay perfect great uh all right everybody so here we go focus is fine rewrite it a bit big I don't that list isn't that important it's just sort of uh background for me when I draw and do diagrams and stuff I will definitely make it bigger okay here we go I don't know what I'm going to do by the way does any I so at some point um if anybody has a really good suggestion for a uh for a data set that I might use I think what I'm going to actually do is just make random points and do a regression of random points or I'm going to let the user click um and sort of add points and then fit the line to whatever if none of this makes any sense to you hopefully my explanation will make it make sense to you um but if anybody has an idea for a really you know the typical things that people do are like uh doing a linear regression for uh height value predicting a weight value based on height or predicting you know a height based on hand size or price of a house based on number of bedrooms you know something like that that is a very simple 2D relationship okay this is the invisible laptop you can see where it is if I stand behind it okay something on kaggle yeah exchange yeah but you know mostly um mostly what I'm uh what I would like is to do a very generic tutorial and have people find their own data and then and work with it so maybe that's what's better anyway okay here we go um let's get started uh okay hello welcome to another video in my series on machine learning I I don't know why I said that that way but sounds very Hest anyway um I'm going to talk about something called linear regression in this video uh and so in this video I'm really just going to talk about what linear regression is and why it's something related to the topic of machine learning now if you've been watching these videos in sequence you might have just watched some videos you might remember me from such other videos as nearest neighbor similarity score um and so uh the idea being that we're looking to create create a machine Learning System right there's some kind of quote unquote machine learning recipe and we have some type of input data that goes into the machine learning recipe and out the other side comes some sort of output so this can be any number of things you know the classic scenario example is you know inputs are uh Square can I just start this video it's been a while it's been a while since I've been here and I um I don't know I feel like off my game a little bit and I think that I'm recapping too much because it's been so long since I recorded these videos but if somebody were actually coming to this to experience it like a course they would would have really they they could have just watched this in sequence maybe a day or two ago or even a week ago as opposed to like three weeks ago so I'm gal um I'm going to I'm getting some great suggestions for data sets in the chat temperature versus Ice Cream sales I like that galton's original height data is a classic and is that uh K weekman who posted that in the um slack channel is that where the term is that the same I think it's galon French um where the term regression actually came from and anyway uh so just give me one Mulligan for today and I'm going to start over now it's very warm in here got to get this air situation worked out okay here we go Okay Hand ey coordination brain coordination not so good hand ey coordination is still still seems to work for me hello welcome to another video in my machine learning or artificial intelligence or something like that series I'm trying to figure all this stuff out okay so in this video I'm going to introduce the idea of linear regression what is linear regression and why is it something that's kind of relevant in terms of this sequence so the um this we're kind of on this train oh look train metaphor we're on this train along the tracks Trucking along getting towards this idea of looking at neural networkbased uh machine learning systems and so one of the things we need to do is start building up our vocabulary and our sort of sense of how pieces of how machine learning works I please bang my head against the wall for just a minute okay so uh how does machine learning system work the idea here is that we have some kind of machine learning recipe we have some kind of inputs and those inputs it's like a spreadsheet goes into the machine learning recipe it does some stuff to it and it comes out with some sort of output output and input so this is the idea we looked at uh nearest neighbor um classification and regression we talked I talked a bit about what classification is what regression is here is a time where I want to look at a particular recipe a machine learning recipe called linear regression linear regression is a useful technique when there is a linear relationship between the input data and the output data what is a linear relationship okay the idea here is that if we take some data set and we graph it this known as kind of like a SC known as a scatter plot we graph it this is the x axis this being the Y AIS so maybe we look at something as was just suggested to me in the live chat that's going on right now that the x axis represents temperature the Y AIS represents ice cream sales now I would like to also include sorbet in here I don't know why I put sorbet in quotes but you know the dairy it doesn't agree with me so much so but that's in as side that's not relevant or maybe oh my goodness I'm not even in the frame help me I am off screen the uneven sleeves are bothering people yeah that's really a problem see I nobody can see the board all right all right see okay hold on let me let me try this one more time okay all right uh all right all right you you guys are all very kind to watch you know I used to not do these live and when I didn't do them live I never actually got anything done because I just stopped and started over and over and over again you can see why I do that because I my sort of neurotic leads me to do that I'm going to have to make the same sorbet joke I'm just letting you know that was not planned that was spontaneous but now it won't be spontaneous anymore but I think it was a good one as a keeper I mean I could maybe I'm doing it the second time it's very hard with no actual live audience to feed off of I got to zoom out so I have a little more space I'm saving MAA from editing by um by uh just starting over okay so uh all right so this is going to be my last attempt I'm not allowed to start over again I'm doing it this time it's getting it is only getting hotter in here maybe I need to take off the hoodie but I thought I you know I did get the um some people had complained when these weren't even and I can totally understand that if they're not even now the sleeves also need to make sure they're both rolled up I think subscribers over time I think that's going down uh okay okay here we go everybody I need some welcome oh this is good I going to leave this in the background okay hello welcome to another video in my uh machine learning series and in this video I am going to talk about something called linear regression so I'm just actually going to move straight over to the Whiteboard going to just move along here um so why are we talking about linear regression so uh what what I'm leading towards and what I'm going to get to if you keep watching these videos they don't exist yet but I'm going to keep making them So eventually you might keep watching them is I'm going to get to neural networks and um neural networks are are useful and Powerful in the case of large data sets with many many variables many many inputs parameters that we almost can't figure out mathematically how to make sense of it maybe a neural network can do that in some almost magical way we're going to get into all the details of that but there are machine learning scenario where we can actually just calculate precisely using a statistical method the relationship between inputs and outputs right so if we were to review we have this idea of a machine learning recipe previously I looked at K nearest neighbor as a possible algorithm to make sense of input data and predict some sort of output whether it's classifying or predicting a price that type of thing so we have some sort of input we get some sort of out outut so let's take a very simple scenario pause this pause edit Point by the way this is going so much better so far but this marker kind of is terrible so let's try to find a better marker just gonna see here uh should have gotten some new ones that that and how's this one I'm just drawing over here oh you can actually see these let's try this one this is like a sort of fresh one so let's let's see I made it by the way really really small now uh uh mark on the board where I go out of frame if you past it that's a good um so let me I'm in the frame I'm in the frame so I shouldn't uh this is out of the frame so if I'm standing here I can actually see myself on a monitor there okay so let's take the simplest scenario of inputs related to outputs and um a simple scenario for this would be something like a twod dimensional data set okay so we could graph using something called a scatter plot a data set and we're going to make the data set bear with me here uh a temperature the x axis I want to think of as temperature so maybe uh I'm really sorry I'm going to do this in Fahrenheit I really just have to apologize for that I I'll happily say maths though anytime you want um zero degrees to uh 100° I guess it could be negative so in Fahrenheit and then the Y AIS will be ice cream sales and uh this was suggested uh in the chat um but I'm I'm going to add to this uh sorbet in quotes for no reason oh I'm really I'm oh I'm out the frame I'm out of the frame I'm back okay uh but you can see this right yes s i just not if I put my head in front of it okay so uh yeah just because you know Dairy doesn't really agree with me just in case you were wondering okay so I like survey okay so uh we could say like oh when it's uh you know 24° there only three ice creams are sold per day and then on another day it was uh 90° and there were 18 and you know another day that was 90° there were this many and then you know you could imagine if you were the owner the purveyor of an ice cream shopy that you could keep track of your sales as it relates to temperature and then what you could do is that you have all this data now somebody comes into your place of business and says okay tomorrow the weather's going to be 50 degrees what could you like could you make a guess as to how many ice creams you're going to sell and so we could look and say Here's you know 50° well there was some other day where I sold this much when was 50 some other day some other day how could we make a prediction well this is a scenario where it appears there is a linear relationship a linear relationship between temperature and sales the higher the temperature the more the sales the lower the temperature the less the fewer the fewer the Sals so the idea of a linear regression is to figure out how can we fit a line best fit a line to this data and I could look at this and hold on I'm going to be back in a second for some magic uh uh Sor I'm looking at Kelvin uh okay I'm back this is the by the way this is like a historic moment not really because that's be ridiculous this is the first time I'm ever using a marker with a different color on my YouTube channel maybe suddenly I'll just get so many subscribers because they'll be like I heard there's this Channel with tutorials and a whiteboard where they use multiple colors okay so um we could make a guess and I could say like look that looks like a line that kind of fits the data that's me just as a human being kind of eyeballing it so now if I wanted to say you know when the temperature is 95° I could just look at 95° find this and find the corresponding you know uh you know 200 ice creams or whatever sold so this is the idea of linear regression looking at a data set and fitting a line to that data set now how do you do this there are many different methods and we're I'm going to look at multiple methods in different videos in this video I would like to discuss the method called Ordinary least squares I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna write this down ordinary oh boy I got a little dizzy everything's going to be okay least squares what does that mean okay so if we look at this line we can compare uh every single this is the line that we've fit to the data you know by as a human being eyeballing it one thing that I can do is I can say look how different is each one of these data points from the line and I could see like I could essentially like look at its distance from the line and the idea of ordinary least squares is the least squares method is we want to find the line that minimizes all of these distances so what if we okay so if we could think of all of these as data points like uh you know x0 X1 X2 X3 x uh X4 right we could think of all of these distances as like d0 D1 D2 D3 D4 so if we took all of these distances and squared them D 0^ 2ar plus D1 2 plus D2 2 etc etc etc and added them all up together that's the sum of all the squares of all the differences we want to minimize this value so how do we calculate the for the how do we find a line that minimizes all those so you might be asking well why are you first of all why are you squaring the values well this is a common technique you know you'll notice that some points are below the line and some points are above the line so the difference could be positive or negative squaring it gets rid of that difference um okay so how do we do this um like I said there are a variety of methods and what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you a formula for this which I have written down it's another historic moment I prepared for today's video this was by preparation I wrote down the formula I could pretend that I memorized it by editing this out if this is still in this video then I did not pretend um okay so let's look at um so first of all what how do we represent mathematically this pinkish reddish line so the formula for a line is typically written as yal MX plus b i will point out however that if you look in uh statistics textbook you might see something like y = b 0 + B1 * X this is the same exact formula M refers to our B1 here as the slope and B 0 or B here is the quote unquote Y intercept which is the value where the line intersects the Y AIS so the slope this m value determines like which way does the line point and then the Y intercept is how high or low uh it you know where is that line relative to the X AIS so all we need to do is we need to both calculate m and b so here's the thing this is a you while we're looking at this you know most data sets that you might work with aren't just simple 2D data sets there might be you know there's temperature there's you know population of the city that the store is in maybe you know there's the hours that it's open I I don't know you could think of like all sorts of other data in puts that might relate to the sale of ice cream and this can actually be generalized much of you know this this could be y = b 0 + B1 * X1 + B2 * X2 so there could actually be multiple linear this is referred to as multiple linear regression and generally you know the the same math that I'm going to show to you applies to this scenario but it typically involves U Matrix based calculations maybe I'll do that in a different video but we're it's simpler to look at in just this context with just one input but we can extrapolate that uh and you could think about it is instead of you know in If instead of a line you know fitting this to a plane right if you had this as you know if there was just simply one other two two data two uh input pieces of data okay how we doing so far you still here okay so now let's look at this form look you can see I wrote it down on this piece of paper maybe I can auction this off on eBay or nobody will want this okay going to need that piece of paper okay so here's how we calculate M the slope we calculate it as the sum so I'm going to use this Greek letter Sigma looks like an e but it's not an e it's a sigma which means sum of x Min x with a line over it and I'll talk about what that means time y y with a line over it you could call that uh Y Bar I suppose divided by the sum of x minus x with a bar squared Okay so let's think about what this means so first of all xar or Y Bar this means the mean or the average so what this really is is it's all of the X values added up together divided by how many there are so you could think of xar as being the sum and sigma by the way means sum so I'm going to kind of unpack that a little bit but the sum of of every single X so X index I so X 0 X1 X2 where I goes from 0 to n n being the total so this is kind of mathematical notation to say add up all the X you can think of it as an array right an array of data points add them all up and then divide it by the total number there is divided by n so this is really what xar is it's just the average of all the X's Y Bar is the average of all the Y's so this means get that average and then take each x minus the average times each y minus the average and so this really is also these this Sigma should really also have I goes from zero to n and this is X index I this is y index I we have this from 0er to n this is X index I um as well so you can I'm not going to derive or prove this formula in this video maybe I can provide a resource to a page or a tutorial that does that in this video's description but you can almost kind of intuitively kind of understand why is this the slope of the line because what we're looking at is the sum of all the differences between the average X and the C current H multiplied by the average the differences between all the Y's and the average y's um so you um if we add all that stuff up together divided by the all of those X differences squared you can kind of intuitively understand how why that's going to be you know if all those values are equal we're just going to get the value one right so you you um I have to pause for a second because I lost my train of thought I'm going to uh um I'm just looking at the chat to see if I missed anything ah okay um I'm I'm looking at the chat to see uh to see what people are writing because hold on why is this opening here because I want to see what I'm I'm I'm missing here uh ice cream sales I should use all the colors of the rainbow are ordinary leas squares related to the leas squares regression this is from Alex plotting from linear algebra uh it's basically the same the ordinary distinguishes it from weighted least squares yes um okay how am I doing so far uh all right so I didn't make any horrific mistakes just yet I I got off a little on a little bit of a Tang there for a second because I was trying to like I was trying to explain why uh I was trying to explain this as like a having an intuitive understanding of why this formula works and I it didn't my explanation I think didn't really hold up so maybe I want to like go back and try to say that again but I want to think it through and maybe if anybody in slack has a good thought for me um so again let's think about let me let me talk this through for a second then maybe I'll explain it again think about if we had the scenario where X was equal to Y so the slope would be one right if x is equal to Y The Intercept could be Zero The Intercept is not relevant right now so if the if x is equal to Y the slope could be one because I'm looking in the chat to see for somebody to save me um if we had all the numbers we took the oh took the average that makes sense right because the average would be let's create a scenario where we have have just these points so the average X would be right here and the average y would also be right here ah right this makes sense because if X and Y are kind of have a equal relationship this times this okay this times this would be the equivalent of this squared that makes sense okay so maybe I can come back to talk about and if x if Y is growing faster as X it would point up this way if it's not growing up a point this way because if Y is so that this this is kind of solidifying in my head uh okay the numerator is basically the correlation thank you K weekman that is a much nicer way of putting it okay the slope basically defined um harsh gup the slope basally defines how much y changes with respect to x uh okay great thanks there's all these wonderful um uh comments in the chat I really appreciate it you guys know way more about this stuff than I do I should really stick with my like generative fractal tree rainbow colored stuff right don't you think I'm trying my best here uh okay so let me come back here and say so I'm not gonna derive or or prove this formula in this video although if I could find some supplemental information I'll link to it in this video's description or maybe in the comments you can offer a suggestion but you can kind of get a uh uh an intuitive kind of sense of why this formula works so first of all imagine if x equals y if the formula for the line were just yal X that would mean the slope would be one right the slope would be one if Y equals X well look at this if Y equals X then x xar * x xar would be like that squared so you could see how M would equal 1 if y equal x and then you could sort of say the numerator is essentially the correlation thank you to K week in the chat for typing it out like that because I think that's a good way of thinking about it you can see that you know if y grow you know is is y growing more uh as X grows or is X uh is y growing less as X grows you can sort of see how this relationship is going to uh between the numerator and the denom denominator is going to uh give you a fraction that describes the slope of this line so think about that hopefully it has some intuitive sense and I'm sure people in the comments will write some nice explanations that that help with that understanding so this is really it so what I want to do now in the ne I'm going to do this in the next video is I want to program this so I think what I'll do is I'll program it in such a way where a user can click and add data points and each time the user clicks I will I will implement this formula and draw the line of best fit um according to the ordinary least squares method um in canvas in the browser and after we do that I will talk about well what are some reasons why linear regression does it might not make sense for your data um but this is the idea this is just to just to kind of recap for a second the reason we're doing this is this is a model right the idea of a model the idea of a model is you try to fit it to the data we have known data training data temperature with actual Sals we want to fit our model our model just has two parameters the slope of the line and the Y intercept and once we solved for those parameters we can make new predictions and even though it's kind of overly simplistic here this is the exact same process that we will that I'll employ again and again once we look at a simple perceptron then a multilayered perceptron and then things like convolutional networks or recurrent all of this all this is laying the foundation for a more sophisticated robust machine learning based systems okay so I hope this was helpful and made sense if it ah uh okay let's okay okay so I hope this was helpful and made some sense to you and you have uh uh an idea of what linear regression is what the least squares method is and if you're inclined to continue just keep following to the next video and I will program this particular algorithm from scratch okay thanks very much see you there maybe uh uh okay how how we doing um exponential classic example exponential R log plots yeah yeah yeah okay okay okay so how did we do everybody I don't wonder how long that'll be that was probably like 15 minutes or something um so now what I'm going to do so uh if MAA if you're there I think what I think just what I think I'm going to do is not have this be coding challenge I don't know why um let me go look at the playlist here I mean that certainly was just an explanation I could make the second thing like a coding challenge but then it wouldn't have the explanation with it I wonder if if I look at my playlists where I'm thinking this would go is just as part of session two no are we in session two no no no we're in session three do I have a session 31 yet maybe I don't have a session 31 just yet did I do an introduction to session three I thought I did uh yeah I did I did so maybe I just didn't make that playlist so I think this can just go in um where are we here introduction session three what is machine learning and then it goes after these I kind of am so arbitrary about whether oh I need to speak about how to find B I forgot about that cuz that's such an easy part oops I got to go back we'll just splice this together in a weird out of order way hold on I gotta I mean b is sort of obvious once you have um yeah thank you I don't know why I forgot that uh okay I'm looking at the chat okay uh all right oops I forgot so for the formula of a the line Y = MX plus b the slope is the more complex calculation actually once we have that slope it's pretty easy to calculate the Y intercept where is B and the formula for that is b equals m time uh M * xar + Y Bar did I get that right oh no no no I totally did not get that right what am I saying let's just edit this back to where I get it correctly the uh formula is b = y barus m * xar and you could kind of see why this is the case right because remember y equal MX plus b so all I need to do is say uh b = y MX right and we could just use the average of all the X and all the Y to figure out where should that line be shifted so this is a this is the formula to calculate that Y intercept so we can do this with a statistical method we run through all the data we calculate the slope we calculate the Y intercept and we have that line that formula for the line for which we can make predictions for new data I hope you found this blah blah blah so now we can go back to that uh blah blah blah okay wait what else did I miss um it's so nice but it's really good that I have a live chat going because I clearly make so many mistakes uh also your sum should run from one not zero oh yes that's a good point I'm right or it would be zero to n minus one technically I guess if I'm using sort of array index thing so maybe maybe I'll addendum this okay good luck M editing this together okay this could come still before my finishing point one more thing as it was uh pointed out in the chat to me thank you to K weekman yes again again which is that who should really be just making these video tutorials because I just keep getting everything wrong but I'm so used to Counting from zero in the array index programming world that I live in uh there's five elements 0 1 2 3 four but in this case in this notation this should really be sum from I equals 1 all the way to n there's 10 elements 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 we could think of them as 0 to 9 1 to 10 whatever it's the same idea but technically speaking I think my formulas are a bit off if this doesn't say I equals one so that's a good correction thank you very much now I hope blah blah blah so this could be or I could divide by n plus one is the average no no no I think my fixing explanation there was good okay uh okay I don't know why this musac stuff gives me such happiness no I did forget the formula for the Y intercept but then I uh got it in it okay did I miss anything else because now we can program it what time is it 520 okay I'm not seeing any major Corrections uh so we're going to program it now hello welcome to ah another video which is part two of my uh linear regression tutorial and in this video I am going to take this beautiful blank canvas that is the web browser and make linear regression happen in it is that a weird thing to say or do hopefully not anyway so how are we going to do this so first thing that I need is I need to boy this is always more complicated than you think I like oh it's G to be so simple one thing that I should do I should should probably hm hold on do I need to map the screen work work with me folks here do I need to map the pixel space to a more kind of traditional cartisian plane like where Z 0 is in the bottom left and kind of normalize it between zero and one and so I get a kind of less insane looking formula for the line or should I just live with the coordinate system the way it is is it's probably useful to map it because when you get data it's not going to have the pixelbased stuff okay I think I'm gonna have to map it okay okay I did some thinking there for a second and um wait I'm going to do a little more thinking can you see the wheels turning CU actually I was just kind of homing it there like I was thinking about you know what I was going to eat for dinner okay um so here's the thing that happens a lot in a machine learning and computer Graphics this thing that I've drawn over here is sort of has an arbitrary scale there's a temperature which I botched by doing it in Fahrenheit which is like the worst measuring system ever I I don't want to be insulting it's just you know and Fahrenheit you're wonderful too you have many good qualities just like Celsius I I love all my temperature systems equally anyway um but let's say I wanted to actually graph this data you know what do I have I have a canvas that I'm going to draw in the web browser which you know has like 0 to 600 pixels and 0 to 400 pixels z z in the top left it points down it points to the right I think I need to map my pixel space so what I mean by that is I want to have my pixel space represent Z being in the bottom left and I want the x axis to be kind of go from 0 to one and the y axis go from 0 to one so I need to have kind a scale the data scale and then the computer Graphics scale and I'm sort of making this up so it can be anything but when you go and apply this with real data you need some way of mapping from your data to pixels if you want to graph it you know in a lot of uh systems for doing data visualization if you're using r or D3 you know or some python graphic stuff it's not going to do this for you automatically but we're in JavaScript land we're going to use P5 we're going to do the maths ourselves okay okay so um so I'm going to first of all I'm gonna so I'm going to make a canvas and I'm going to make a canvas that's 400 by 400 and I'm going to draw the background uh with a a gray value of 51 okay whoa that's a giant canvas okay that's better so um I'm going to make it a square just to make things simpler right now um and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say uh Mouse pressed and whenever I press the mouse I'm going to create a new data point so I'm going to say x equals map Mouse X which goes between zero and width to a value between zero and one so this is me mapping the X values between zero and width to zero and one because the pretend data If This Were Real data I'd want to know what the actual range was I wouldn't be getting it from Mouse click but and I'm going to say VAR y equals math Mouse y from0 to height now however I'm going to say from one to zero because I want to have the bottom of the window be zero right if I come over here this is z 0 right over here so that's height which is zero zero is one okay so then what I'm going to do is I'm going to say VAR uh data equals create I'm going to use the P5 Vector object just to store both of these things and I'm I'm going to say Point call this a point and I'm going to make an array called data and I am going to say data. push point so what I've done here is every time I click I create a data point based on where the mouse is so what do I want to do in the draw function you know it's a little unnecessary to have an animation Loop here because I could potentially only redraw but whenever I have a new piece of data what I'm going to do here is I'm going to uh I'm going to iterate over all of the data uh so our I equals z i is less than data. length i++ and now what I need to do is do the reverse mapping so when I put the data into that array I want to map it to the the appropriate range and when I get it out I need to map it back to the pixel range so I'm going to say varx equals map data index I .x which has a range between 0 and one to between zero and width and I'm going to do the same thing for y map data doy which has a range between zero and one and map that to a range from height down to zero if you if you haven't seen this map function before I have a whole video just on what is map so you could go I'll link to that in the description as well then I'm going to draw an ellipse at X comma y That's you know 8 pixels by 8 pixels I'm going to say fill 255 and stroke 255 and now what we should see here is just the visuals that I want which is wherever I click I get a point so you know this would be a lot simpler without that mapping but the mapping is going to be useful for us as we start to try to compute the formula for the line with the with the least squares uh criteria okay um how we doing so far I think we're doing okay I mean I feel okay probably um all right so what's the next thing that I need to do oh we need to calculate m&b so when should we do that so let's make a global variable M let's call it I think I could call it m equals z and VAR b equals z and let's actually make m equal 1 so let's see if we have an m and a b right the formula for a line is y okay so let's let's uh um what are we gon to do okay I got it I got it I got it okay so here's the thing I want to draw that line so how am I going to do that well I could just take the x value here and then the x value at the end calculate the corresponding yv values for both of those points and then draw a line between them so let's do that so let's write a function called Draw line and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say VAR X Min equals zero VAR y Min uh sorry x max equals 1 then I'm going to say y Min equals m * X Min + B and Y Max you know what this is really just like X1 uh X2 y1 Y2 like I'm really trying to get two points X1 y1 and and X2 Y2 so in fact this would make more sense to write it this way y1 = M * X1 + B and Y2 = M * X2 + B and now all I need to do is say stroke 255 oh I could make it a different color just like I had two different color markers and I could say line X1 y1 X2 Y2 only I can't right what's the problem I calculated this line with my units my my scale my mapping of the data having this range between zero and one and so I need to unmap it to the pixel stuff so this is a little bit awkward but let's just do it this way let's say X1 equals math uh X1 which has a range between 0 and one to between Zer and width and by the way I could just multiply it by width but I'm keeping the map function in here because you might have a very different scale why uh y1 is the same thing but go from height down to zero and then we're going to do the same thing for X2 and Y2 are you asleep yet uh and now now we're going to draw so we're going to calculate those values map them to pixels and then draw the line and so let's uh in the draw function let's have draw a line so now oops a I have an error line 50 oops I got I guess I have an extra bracket somehow oops Y 2 is not defined a draw a line where did I mess up here uh oops this should be Y2 thank you very much there so you can see there's the line so I mean that's what the line is always going to be so now I know that if I have the m and the B for the formula for a line I can visually represent that line now all I need to do is use this formula here to calculate m and b based on the actual X and Y values let's do that okay so let's remind ourselves so let's do let's write a function and let's call it linear regression oh and I wanted to talk about where the term regression comes from this French thing and it's regression to the mean you can look it up um okay so uh what are we going to do well one thing we know we definitely know need to know if you so time out I forgot to mention in the beginning of this video I I forgot to mention in this uh I forgot to mention in this video that the beginning that you should watch the previous one how can I correct that we'll splice something in there somebody remind me at the end I'll record us me saying that for sentence and Mato will splice that in there okay okay so if we look at the formula and this I went through all of this from the previous uh in the previous video um where I talked about this formula something that I really need is xar and and Y Bar and xar is the mean or the average of all the X values and Y Bar is the mean of all the yv values so adding them all up together dividing by the total number so I might as well uh add those up I mean get calculate those first so the first thing I want to do is say uh X sum equals zero and we're going to go through all of the data we're going to iterate over all of the data uh y sum equals z we're going to say x sum plus equals data index i.x y sum plus equals data in that so we're adding up all of the X values and all the Y values and then we're going to say x mean equals x sum divided by data. length and the same thing for the y mean so this is for this is the average so we now have the average of all the X values and the average of all the Y values now what we need to do is we need to calculate the numerator and the denominator let's do the numerator first so the numerator is so first I need to I'm going to have to sum up some stuff here so uh what am I first I definitely need to Loop through all the data but we doing a lot of looping through all the data so I'm going to say numerator equals zero so the numerator is going to add up all together each data points x minus x mean times each data points and you know what I'm going to do I'm GNA just use some extra variables here which I think will make things a little cleaner uh just so we can look at the formula this is now the numerator right this is ex exactly this is in code right here exactly what's written in the formula here it's adding up all of the X's minus the average of x's and all the Y's minus the average of y's multiplied together okay so we've got that and now all we need to do is we also we might as well do the denominator at the same time why not right denominator can I say Deen for that we're going to add up the denominator is x x mean * x x mean it's just that added up squared and then m equals oh m equals uh numerator divided by denominator whoops denominator so let's think about this could we have an issue where the denominator is zero you know it's if there's this is only worth doing if there's more than one uh data point so I think we should say here in um so whereas in draw we're going to say if data. length is greater than one then calculate the linear regression and draw the line all right let's give this a try hey look at that that was amazing nothing ever works in the first try uh this kind of makes sense right you can see I can add a bunch of points and it's always fitting that line to the points this is linear regression interactive linear regression in the browser is probably not anything I should be too excited about but it's making me happy right now time out for a second um uh oh what's known as perfect colinearity the problem with when you guys write useful pieces of information in the chat is I see them like 30 seconds or a minute later because I'm in the future and I cannot I don't know what um what relates to what I'm G there's more that I need to talk about in this video I just want to take a break for a second if all the X values are zero then m equals z yeah okay um so now what I want to talk about is model checking this is really um uh this is a really useful K weekman also pointed this out to me so okay so which I want to talk about here uh when all the X's are equal that's perfect collinearity perfect collinearity uh yeah all right boy all these thing all this stuff o look at this you guys should be watching this YouTube video I'm sure it's much better than anything I could possibly ever make o what is an example of perfect multic colinearity uh okay maybe I shouldn't read stack Overflow during my live stream okay so the thing that I want to talk about now and I'm going to bring up um week. github.io ml what's the URL for um K weekman what's the URL for your um sandbox maybe it is yes linear regression great so I think I'm gonna just use this as a demonstration if you don't mind um I will of course credit you and put a link to it in the video description but um yeah uh okay all right okay so somehow I need to get back so I need to get back in to this video tutorial talking about does linear regression actually make sense and then uh and look at um talk about model checking and the term sort of residual plot is useful um and uh um and then um look at anscombs quartet and just kind of like finish up and give some people some ideas of things you could try and then I need to remember a meant to splice something in where I say something about watching the previous video uh sorry here's the um MAA is asking for this is if anyone can't find this is the URL someone wants to post this in the chat okay people are still talking about temperature I can't wait for the YouTube comments on my uh Fahrenheit versus Celsius Kelvin maybe I should just do everything in Kelvin is there like an esir equivalent of espiranto I guess maybe okay let me get out of this right now okay okay so this this video is really complete we see that I have this linear regression that's uh calculated now here's the thing what can you do with this so first of all you might think of some more interesting interactive ways of playing with the data whether it's being able to click move these points around drag and drop um randomize all the points I'm sure you could come up with some more interactive possibilities but one thing that I think is really important to talk about is whether it actually makes sense to use linear regression a linear regression model for your data and one way you know there's lots of reasons why this could be a why why you might not want to first of all um you know simple do I dare erase this and just come over here simple way to sort of talk about this is you know let's what if this is a plot of my data well you can see I could apply a linear regression to this and I'm going to get a line that maybe looks something like this forgot my multicolored marker and I'm off let me try that again I'm off I'm off I I said no more Mulligans but I'm gonna give myself a mulligan here except I I can't fake erase it continuity error put it back what's the chance oh it's got all the I'm trying to recreate my drawing which is kind of sad for a variety of reasons someone's gonna notice this oh yeah and it was like D I forgot that I had like x0 X X1 but I'm I'm too far gone now I I have to continue this d0 this should be like X1 D1 whatever okay D2 okay close enough no one will notice because I'm going to walk over and erase it momentarily uh okay let's try this again okay so let's look let's think about a scenario where you wouldn't um you where you wouldn't uh sorry here I am where you wouldn't want to use uh linear regression so what if your data happened to kind of look like this so I could fit this trying to get better at the multicolor I could fit this with a line and I might still get even like the same sort of line but actually if we really looked at this data I could see that ah you know what this data I could fit a curve to this data I could fit something like y = MX2 + b or even plus you know m0 x^2 + M1 * x + B and I'm probably using the wrong I should I should start using uh this is B 0 B1 B B2 right so you I could essentially create a polynomial formula a formula that has not just X but X squar and maybe X cubed or x to the 4th power and I'm actually going to look at that in a future video um U so I will do a video where I do polinomial regression I'm just going to use a Javas SCP library that hasn't built into it so just to sort of demonstrate the idea but this is something that I might want to do and what's interesting about linear regression and this um this has been demonstrated there's a famous data set whoops anscom oncome anybody know how to pronounce that uh um there's a wellknown famous data set called encom's quartet where let's look I'm going to look at these four graphs each one of these has the same exact linear regression line right you can see that with this data the line is the same but does this does this line really make sense well for this one it kind of does right you can see that it's a nice approximation of the data with this one it does but you can see it's kind of off because there's just an anomaly and maybe we should build something into our model to account for that anomaly or this one over here even though linear regression has that same line it's actually we you could figure out that we could use a polinomial function to estimate that and here we got some kind of like crazy nonsense where we have all the same X values so this is an important thing to realize that linear regression is not some kind of magic it's not a recipe for all data for all inputs and outputs but it is a simple model that will work for a lot of data data that is linear um one way to evaluate whether or not the linear model is useful for your uh data set is to look at something called the residuals and um uh uh coding train viewer extraordinary k weekman um you can go to kwon's GitHub kweek man. GitHub I'll include a link to this in the video description created a much more sophisticated demonstration this is the same exact idea I can move these points around um and I can kind of uh I can randomize them and I can see the same linear regression but what this is showing is a residual plot the residual plot shows the magnitude of the difference from the line to the data point for each and every data point and if and we can actually uh that the anscom uh data is built into this and you can see this makes sense if you have a kind of random residual plot that's a good sign if you have a highly patter pattern residual plot then it's most likely that some other model could be useful for your regression so something you might consider doing as an exercise is researching more about different data sets uh trying to implement I mean you could find K weekman code on GitHub as well but try to make your own residual plot from my scatter plot code um uh and what other types of interactive features for importing or using different data sets uh what other colorful and creative ways can you explore visual Iz in the process of linear regression okay so thanks for watching this video I'm going to do a couple more videos on this topic number uh I'm going to uh look at polinomial regression with a JavaScript library and then I'm going to use a different technique to calculate a linear aggression known as gradient descent and the main reason I want to do that is gradient descent as opposed to this least squares methodology I used here is a fundamental method for neural networkbased learning uh for a a learn learning method for neural network based systems so we're going to do that for linear regression which will set us up well for neural network stuff later um okay uh what what did I uh Miss I didn't say goodbye yet because I was sure I missed something how was that K weekman did I do did I did I get at the sort of essence of some of the stuff that you mentioned in the slack Channel earlier today that I about model checking and the residual plot um um I would love any feedback from anybody before I put a bow on this uh two video linear regression thing as always I always forget the this dot this do this I was off camera when I was drawing the polinomial but that was probably fine somebody can CGI me back in right how hard could that be somebody by the way said they wanted more green screen footage of me on Twitter the other day so uh here we go I don't know I don't know what I'm supposed to do but I I like it when I I'm yeah anyway okay there we go there uh okay come back here um all right uh indeed short and clear good you know this isn't a course on statistics I don't know what this is but it's the you know I'm trying to give some background and some basic steps so hopefully um uh people got the idea here okay so oh the Whiteboard content well let me look back oops was there some part over here that is not was not usable oh CU I drew down here no I think it was okay right so hopefully it's okay I was getting some messages that there was maybe a missing part but um okay uh somebody said once I start doing uh somebody made a YouTube comment that once I start doing es6 we have a whole new super super the super song never forget the super uh okay at the top oh that part is not visible I see it okay um yeah the hey Okay uh all right so what do we've got ah let me I don't know what this is going to do but um so this will get split somehow um so I'm just gonna say oh let's try this before I begin coding I just wanted to mention if you just jumped into this video I walk through a full explanation of what linear regression is and the formula that I'm about to use in the previous video so check this video's description to a link to that preious previous video otherwise keep watching I'm going to get started coding um will that work justplay thin I hope that does all right it is 550 p.m. so I let's let's review where I got to today I got through half of this I got through half of this um so tomorrow I think I'm going to do now I hope that I have some time tomorrow the schedule is a little bit tricky um but and it would if I were to live stream tomorrow it would be somewhere in the 2 to 500 p.m probably range I definitely have to be done by 5 and I probably can't start any earlier than two so somewhere in that range of time I'm going to try to live stream and I will cover these two last pieces okay so I have about uh 5 to 10 minutes before I have to go so I will try to see if I can answer a few questions um or um oh oh I know what I need to mention shoot I should have done this at the beginning always forget well better late than never um where am I going to find information about this let me go to the coding train Reddit um okay so there's all sorts of things on here there's a coding train oh the look maybe I can find some more questions here maybe I'll try to post another oh I'm in the wrong screen there's um uh okay so somebody set up uh a coding train Discord and because I'm old and out of it I have no idea what Discord is but I wonder if I should get used to it so I wanted to mention it I guess it is uh an unofficial chat talking platform for people who are interested um so you can click maybe I'll try to join it look at it I'm using slack for the uh people who support my channel through patreon but you know I'm always interested in other platforms especially if they're open source and flexible not that slack is but um anyway uh so I wanted to mention that that Discord server exists so please join that Community if you're interested or find that to be nice and interesting um I also trying to figure out a good way to uh receive questions so I was trying to make a question thread for each week which I did two weeks ago what's today but I didn't make one maybe I'll make one for tomorrow but let's see if there are any new questions on here um I think I answered some of these already yeah yeah I answered most of these already last time so maybe I'll try to make a new question thread and ah um okay but in the chat from G4 m34 G4 M3 m4n i4c in the slack Channel asks are you going to do some tensor flow yes so again if you want to know what's upcoming this summer uh everything is uh here so I've actually made all the examples and done quite a few and written up some readmes with supplemental links I intend to make videos for every single topic that's here and hopefully more and you can see that when I get to convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks I'm going to use tensor flow for that um I am however using currently in my examples um Caris which is a little bit which is a higher a layer on top of tensorflow to make it a bit easier higher level uh to so that's what I'm uh planning to use at the moment um I have no idea what cotlin is is there a thread to submit video IDE ideas yes and no I mean there is one um I've been using a GitHub repository oops um it's under the coding train GitHub rainbow topics and issues and what I do you can see people are suggesting um I think I'm going to do Tetris by the way I thought of somebody originally suggested Tetris and was like and I sort of thought that's kind of impossible then I saw siraj doing something with Tetris uh on his YouTube channel um and I was thinking oh I could do Tetris um so this summer my plan is to keep some momentum with the machine learning stuff but I would like to ALS also pepper in just kind of random coding challenges I want to do the dragon curve people have been suggesting other games like maybe Tetris so you know I might do sort of an every other week type thing like I'll do some machine learning stuff and then next week some just goofy generative art or game stuff and then come back to machine learning stuff and I'm also hoping to schedule a whole bunch of guests I need to get working on that uh okay uh let's see any other questions I'm going to play my goodbye song somebody could find this song on Sound no I think I got it off the it's very loud uh I think I got it off of um the uh I think I got it on like free music archive once when I searched for rainbow and like public domain uh Game of Life I do sodoku solver would be interesting game of life has been requested a lot I have a bunch of videos tutorials on Game of Life that I made sort of in uh processing back in the day guess I could do it again maybe that would be a good processing challenge um to do just to program it from scratch and just kind of do it I'd be happy to do that um I lowered the audio hopefully it's okay off the music yeah uh thank you guys I I I don't know why this it's really hard about doing these live streams and I used to feel more comfortable with this um and I think especially when I'm doing this more technical stuff mathbased stuff that's really almost like I'm supposed to be teaching something real rather than just like coding up something fun not that those two things need to be mutally exclusive I really feel a bit lost into how it's going so hopefully people found today useful um oh you know what I think we should do it's night time for a lot of you let's take a little break here for a second it's been a while since we read it's probably way too loud from the coding train story book a million random digits with 100,000 normal deviates previously on the coding train 5439 7,845 okay that was the previously now it's the now I don't know 75821 10,38 oh no no that's yeah yeah 59767 46323 61,800 an interesting random number 92 962 next week next time on the coding train oh my lby let's just try this music next time on the coding train we're going to read some gussian deviates 820 225 925 1. 514 2741 31 1.09 949 336 449 378 I just read one of the numbers will anybody ever know I'm on page 127 okay uh I feel like I could do all this nonsense at the end um something else that I wanted to read is um I thought that I would um try to read you guys some quotes from this book it's called in her own words uh red Burns was the uh founder uh of ITP um she was a mentor to me and she would open every year for all the students um here's a picture of red um a presentation in her class with uh and this book is um actually I'll just read this you most alumni remember the first day of the applications class Red's class because of the slides she showed to open the school year the words are an encapsulation of her philosophy and her hopes for ITP students they are words to live by and also words for us to all remember read here she is in her own words so I thought that periodically I would also read to you some quotes from this book maybe I would do one per week um even though I could just do all of them and they kind of are nice in sequence I could pick a random one or I could just just read you the first one we I'll read these in order so today's quote from Red is as you come together depend on each other okay so that's my word this episode was brought to you by the letter the quote anyway um so that's one quote I will come back tomorrow and I will read you another one and maybe someday somebody could splice the all of these things together um okay uh what else else do I need today let's just let's listen to the this dot song as always I always forget the this dot do do do see if there's any more questions do all right everybody thank you all for watching and um I I hopefully will be back tomorrow I'm not guaranteeing that at this point but it is a uh this is probably loud it is a plan that I hope to have I will certainly be back next week um over the summer um you know I'm kind of the commitment I've made is to try to do uh a live stream every week and you know there periods of time during the year this summer in particular where I'm going to be traveling for a week or two I'm traveling for a week in June two weeks in July two weeks in August so there will certainly be some weeks where I'm not U making videos but I'm I'm hoping that they're going to be because it's a summer and I'm not I don't have classes at NYU right now or there'll be some weeks that I live stream twice and um this is a week that I'm hoping to do that I'm hoping to be back tomorrow at least for another hour because I want to get through all of this stuff so that song ended already okay so thanks for watching um and I will see you guys maybe tomorrow in a future live stream I appreciate your support uh and your kind words and your constructive criticism and feedback always uh enjoy your coating also go outside give somebody a hug and enjoy some nature uh breathe in smell the flowers not don't get too close especially if you're allergic to anything that's like in the flower you know that sort of thing okay see you guys goodbye um uh this video this live stream will be available as an archive soon soon enough okay goodbye oh that doesn't turn off till I click this buttton
