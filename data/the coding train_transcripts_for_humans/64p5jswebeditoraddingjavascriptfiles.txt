00:00 - [BELL]
00:00 - Oh, hello there.
00:02 - It is me, from the
future, entering
00:03 - into your playlist of Intro
to Programming with p5.js.
00:07 - In the previous video
that you were watching
00:09 - about object-oriented
programming,
00:11 - I was using a text editor
known as the Adam text editor.
00:15 - The p5 web editor
didn't exist yet.
00:18 - Now, if you started
this whole playlist
00:20 - from the very
beginning, you'll notice
00:22 - that I started with
the p5 web editor,
00:23 - because I made the intro
videos just like a month ago.
00:26 - And then the other videos
about object were last year.
00:29 - And some of them
were two years ago.
00:30 - The narrative follows,
but the videos are all
00:32 - made at different times.
00:33 - So I'm stepping in
here for a moment
00:35 - just to show you a
bit about working
00:38 - with objects and classes
in the p5 web editor.
00:41 - And one of the
things that you'll
00:43 - want to do probably--
so this is the example
00:45 - from the previous video, 6.3.
00:50 - So I'm making 6.4 right now.
00:53 - And what I want to
show you here is,
00:55 - what if I'm going
to eventually make
00:57 - a much more complex sketch.
01:00 - And it's going to have bubbles
and rainbows and unicorns
01:05 - and cupcakes and
puppies and turtles.
01:07 - So I might have a class Turtle
and a class Puppy and a class
01:10 - Unicorn.
01:12 - This one sketch.js file could
get quite long and quite large.
01:17 - So one of the
things I could do is
01:18 - I can actually make a
separate JavaScript file.
01:21 - I can call it anything I want.
01:22 - I'm going to call it bubble.js.
01:24 - And I can put the Bubble
class in that file
01:27 - and allow me to sort
of know that when
01:29 - I want to make
changes to the bubble,
01:30 - I go to the bubble file.
01:32 - When I want to make
changes to set up and draw,
01:34 - I go to sketch.js.
01:34 - When I want to make changes to
the turtle, I go to turtle.js.
01:37 - So that's what I
want to show you.
01:38 - It's not really
necessary for this.
01:40 - But it'll help you sort of
scale up as you move forward.
01:42 - Now, you can actually--
01:45 - this isn't just only
for putting classes
01:47 - in separate JavaScript files.
01:48 - It's just a good time
for me to show you
01:50 - that you can have multiple
JavaScript files for one
01:53 - sketch in the web editor.
01:54 - All right.
01:55 - This is where you want to look.
01:56 - And I should also
reference to you
01:58 - Cassie Tarakajian, the
creator of the p5 web editor,
02:01 - made a nice 20-minute
video about all
02:03 - of the features, which
I will also reference,
02:05 - which goes through a lot of
different pieces of the web
02:08 - editor.
02:08 - I'm just kind of
highlighting this one thing.
02:10 - So I want to go over
here and click this.
02:12 - And you can see now I
have the project-folder.
02:14 - And look, all of the
secrets are revealed.
02:17 - All this time you've just
been working with sketch.js.
02:21 - That's your JavaScript code.
02:22 - But the sketch.js
code is only executed
02:25 - because it is referenced
inside of this other file,
02:28 - this hidden file, index.html.
02:30 - This is actually just
a plain old HTML file.
02:32 - Maybe you don't know about HTML.
02:33 - Maybe you do.
02:34 - In my next playlist about
p5, the p5 DOM library,
02:38 - we get into what that
HTML file is a bit more.
02:41 - But if I look at it, we can
see that-- ah, look at this.
02:45 - There's this reference.
script, there's a script.
02:49 - Its source is the
file sketch.js.
02:51 - If I want to have a
new JavaScript file,
02:55 - I'm going to need
to edit this file.
02:56 - And I'm going to need to make
a reference to button.js.
02:59 - So I need to make a
reference-- not button, bubble.
03:01 - Whatever.
03:02 - I was doing an example
earlier that was a button.
03:04 - bubble.
03:05 - Once I've added that, I
can then go here and back
03:07 - to this little arrow right here.
03:09 - I can click this.
03:10 - And I can say Add file.
03:12 - Are you seeing that?
03:13 - And then I can zoom back out.
03:14 - And I'm going to
name this bubble.js.
03:18 - And you can see it
appeared right there.
03:19 - I'm going to click on it.
03:20 - It's empty.
03:21 - I'm going to close this.
03:23 - I'm going to go to sketch.js.
03:24 - I'm going to grab my Bubble
class, all of this code.
03:30 - And I'm going to go over here.
03:31 - I'm going to paste it in here.
03:32 - I'm going to hit Save.
03:34 - And now I'm going
to run it again.
03:36 - It's the same exact thing.
03:37 - Nothing has changed.
03:39 - The difference is my
code for set up and draw
03:43 - is just right here.
03:45 - And my code for the Bubble
class is now in a separate file.
03:48 - So when it's time
for me to think,
03:49 - you know what, I want the
bubble to move faster,
03:53 - then I can just do this and
change these numbers here.
03:57 - I'm going to put
on auto-refresh so
03:58 - that it updates automatically
whenever I make these changes.
04:03 - So you can see, ah,
it's going faster.
04:05 - Then it's like slower,
but mostly to the right.
04:08 - And then I want to change
the color a little bit to--
04:16 - So I'm changing things.
04:17 - But now, if I want to change
stuff with the sketch,
04:20 - I want to change where
the bubble starts,
04:22 - then I'm going to
change this here.
04:23 - So you can see I have now
just reorganized my code.
04:26 - So now you've wrapped
up this section
04:29 - on making classes and
objects in JavaScript.
04:33 - If you want a little exercise
here, what I might suggest
04:35 - is duplicate this sketch.
04:37 - The URL to it will be in
the video's description.
04:39 - See if you can add yet
another JavaScript file.
04:43 - Maybe put like the
mousePressed function in it.
04:45 - Or maybe add some other
sort of object, the turtle
04:48 - that I keep referencing.
04:49 - This little turtle that
moves across the screen
04:51 - can have a separate class.
04:53 - Give that a try.
04:54 - I will also note-- and I'm going
to do this in a separate video
04:56 - that's going to
come in the next--
04:58 - it's actually going to--
05:00 - it will appear around Objects
and Images or somewhere.
05:06 - I've got to look
where it should go.
05:07 - But I'm going to do another
video where I show you
05:10 - how to add media assets to the
project, which you can load.
05:15 - So thanks for watching this.
05:17 - And I will see you soon.
05:19 - Goodbye.
