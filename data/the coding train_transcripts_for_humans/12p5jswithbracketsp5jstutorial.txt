00:00 - hello it's me Dan coming to you
00:02 - strangely sort of from the future
00:03 - perhaps I'm not sure how you found this
00:04 - video but this video is about how to use
00:07 - p5.js with the brackets code editor and
00:11 - the reason why I'm making this video is
00:13 - I'm making it anybody could be watching
00:15 - this and it could be useful
00:16 - but I'm making it if you are right now a
00:18 - person watching this playlist if
00:19 - learning to program learning p5 is
00:22 - completely new to you and you're
00:24 - learning with my materials you'll notice
00:26 - that in all of these beginner videos I
00:28 - referenced something called the p5.js
00:31 - desktop editor so that desktop editor is
00:35 - no longer being supported you can still
00:38 - find it and download it and in this
00:39 - video I'll actually include a link to
00:40 - where you can download it but I would
00:42 - suggest that you use a different editor
00:44 - all the contents of code everything
00:47 - should still work and be the same in all
00:49 - of these video tutorials but you might
00:52 - want to follow along using a different
00:53 - editor there are lots of possibilities
00:55 - and perhaps I'll even make a few
00:57 - different videos show you different
00:58 - possibilities but in this particular
01:00 - video I'm going to show you how to get
01:02 - started from day one with a p5.js
01:04 - project in an editor called bracket so
01:08 - brackets you could fisa is an open
01:10 - source text editor that knows about the
01:12 - web and you can find it at bracket Co
01:15 - and when once you're there all you need
01:18 - to do is download brackets it's all in
01:20 - version 1.8 I'll have to come to you on
01:22 - the future was like even more this guy's
01:24 - like a lot more gray hair in this video
01:26 - than just what you just watched and then
01:28 - there'll be another one about you know
01:30 - this other futuristic editor where I've
01:31 - got my cane or something in here but
01:34 - anyway I haven't lost track here the
01:36 - point is a brackets 1.8 is the current
01:38 - version I already have it downloaded and
01:40 - over here as installed on my computer so
01:43 - if you want to follow along pause this
01:45 - video download it and then come back so
01:47 - I'm going to go ahead and launch bracket
01:49 - and here we go brackets is open and you
01:52 - can see it's kind of opening up with
01:53 - some default it's probably open up with
01:55 - some like getting started project in it
01:57 - for you and this is something I actually
01:59 - don't care about so much so really what
02:02 - I want to do is right now open a p5.js
02:05 - project the next thing I want to do is
02:06 - go back to the web this web page here
02:10 - and I have also over
02:13 - p5.js org slash download so this is
02:16 - previously where you would have
02:17 - downloaded that desktop editor I was
02:19 - referring to and now what I want to do
02:21 - is just download this complete library
02:24 - so you'll notice here this says p5.js p5
02:27 - zambia people i've found that yet and an
02:29 - example project so this comes with a
02:31 - bunch of files which are the individual
02:33 - library files those like matter to you
02:36 - to some extent but for us right now we
02:39 - don't need that stuff what we really
02:40 - want is that example project so if you
02:42 - click that and download it you're going
02:44 - to get a file called a p5 zip and I
02:47 - already have it right here so this is
02:49 - the file that's going to download p5 dot
02:50 - zip and now I am going to extract that
02:53 - file and it appeared right over here and
02:56 - I'm also just going to open this up here
02:58 - so we can see so this is really this
03:01 - folder is the one that I care about the
03:02 - most
03:03 - this folder is all I ever need for the
03:05 - rest of my time programming and making
03:08 - beautiful p5 sketches so I'm going to
03:12 - rename it and I'm going to call it
03:14 - shipment p5 and then I'm just going to
03:17 - move it on to the desktop so it's it's
03:20 - own thing and you know I can even then
03:21 - just just because I'm so confident I'm
03:24 - going to get rid of that and I need to
03:26 - minimize this stuff to find that folder
03:28 - on my desktop which is over here so this
03:30 - is now my project folder I'll put it up
03:32 - here in the sky so this is now a project
03:34 - folder and it has what matters in it is
03:37 - that ultimately this sketchy-ass file
03:40 - this is where I'm going to write my
03:42 - p5.js code now what I'm going to do is
03:45 - go back to bracket and I'm going to go
03:49 - to file open folder this is important I
03:52 - want to open folder I could actually
03:54 - just that well open folder because I
03:56 - want that whole project folder to be
03:57 - open in bracket and then I'm going to go
03:59 - to my desktop and I'm going to click on
04:01 - shift in p5 it's right name that folder
04:03 - I'm going to hit open and there it is so
04:07 - you can see now it's a little hard to
04:08 - see but in the corner up here it shows
04:11 - that hey there's my folder and here's
04:12 - what here the files in it I can go into
04:15 - sketch jf I can add create canvas 400
04:21 - 400 I can say background 0 and I can say
04:25 - ellipse
04:28 - 200-250 comma 50 so I've written my p5
04:31 - sketch here it is and now here's the
04:34 - exciting thing right over here this
04:37 - little button here the give me a tooltip
04:39 - to say what it is I believe that is the
04:41 - live preview button so over in the top
04:46 - right hand corner over there is this
04:49 - little like lightning bolt and this
04:52 - lightning bolt is like a play button in
04:54 - a way it's called live preview so what
04:56 - this button is going to do it's going to
04:57 - take the folder that you have a code
04:59 - that you're working on and load it into
05:01 - your default web browser so that you can
05:03 - see the result so what I'm going to do
05:05 - and by the way I could get to this also
05:06 - for file live preview and you can see
05:09 - this is I don't know what this is all
05:11 - command P or shift command P or
05:13 - something from keyboard shortcut so I'm
05:16 - going to press this over here and we see
05:18 - that Chrome opened up and it's taking a
05:20 - moment and now it's loaded that sketch
05:22 - so here's the result now the question
05:24 - you might have is well what happens when
05:27 - I want to make change some code so you
05:29 - know background should really be 51 not
05:30 - zero as you all now and now if I go back
05:33 - to Chrome and hit refresh
05:35 - maybe that color was too similar let's
05:39 - make it something less similar there we
05:42 - go so you can see it's actually live up
05:43 - updating so I can actually move this
05:45 - over here and you can see that even let
05:48 - me make this a little smaller it's zero
05:52 - hit saves and then it actually updates
05:55 - so this is a way that you can work you
05:58 - can have your code editor with live
06:00 - preview save edit whatever and then you
06:02 - can also have over here over here the
06:05 - actual sketch on that you're looking at
06:07 - so this could be a workflow and I'm
06:09 - guessing that some of you especially if
06:11 - you're a beginner to coding and you're
06:13 - looking through my tutorials and now
06:14 - you're suddenly using this new thing
06:15 - called brackets there's going to be a
06:16 - lot of questions that come up so please
06:19 - feel free to ask those questions in the
06:20 - comment and what I'm going to do is come
06:22 - back perhaps to make another video just
06:24 - follow-up and some of those question
06:26 - a bunch of confusion points that
06:28 - everybody's hitting and trying to to use
06:30 - brackets so there are two important
06:32 - additional features that I should
06:34 - probably show you for example you know
06:36 - I've made my opus which is this
06:38 - beautiful red background with lips and
06:40 - what I want to do now is make another
06:43 - version of it another project I want to
06:45 - base it on this project so of course
06:48 - there are all sorts of elaborate
06:50 - methodology is for keeping track of
06:51 - versions of projects and iterating over
06:53 - the history table but here's an easy
06:55 - thing you can do if I minimize the
06:57 - browser and this I can actually just
06:59 - take this folder just copy paste it and
07:03 - say like and it actually already renamed
07:06 - if I would say Shipman underscore p5 -
07:08 - so now I have another project I can go
07:10 - back into brackets and I can go file
07:14 - open folder and I can now go and open
07:18 - the other one and now I have a different
07:23 - friend I can make some changes to this
07:24 - one with a different background I can go
07:27 - to live preview and we can see here we
07:31 - go there's my new project so if as you
07:33 - go from project to project what I would
07:35 - probably recommend doing is just
07:37 - duplicating that empty that that project
07:40 - folder which had all the library files
07:42 - and everything you need and then you
07:43 - could open up that one in brackets and
07:45 - edit its own sketch JS file and as you
07:48 - as I go through future p5.js tutorials
07:51 - you'll see there are lots of different
07:53 - analogous situations of what I'm doing
07:54 - in the desktop better you can do exactly
07:56 - the same thing in this particular editor
07:58 - for example if you need it at some point
08:00 - I'll show you oh you might want to
08:01 - change something in index of HTML then
08:03 - that's just a matter of me going over to
08:04 - this file and editing that file but for
08:07 - at least these first videos the only
08:09 - file you need to edit is sketch Jaya now
08:12 - here's another thing you're going to see
08:13 - at a certain point I look at debugging
08:16 - and one thing that I might want to do is
08:18 - say okay well what if I want to know is
08:21 - this draw function actually happening so
08:24 - I want to I want to put some print
08:25 - statements in I'm going to say print
08:28 - setup function because I want to see
08:30 - some messages print draw function and by
08:35 - the way this is exactly identical print
08:39 - also console dot log do exactly the same
08:45 - thing so I could say console dot log
08:47 - which is logging a message to the
08:49 - console and as you'll see in future
08:51 - videos I use this to check the value of
08:53 - a certain variable to see why something
08:55 - isn't working is that color what I think
08:56 - it is did I get the data from this web
08:58 - server there's all these reasons why I
09:00 - might want to log messages to understand
09:02 - how the program is working so once I run
09:04 - this where do I see those messages well
09:08 - the only place I can see those messages
09:09 - is in something called the JavaScript
09:12 - console in chrome if you're using a
09:14 - Chrome browser it has it built into and
09:16 - other browsers have this too but and the
09:18 - way I can find it I know a shortcut
09:20 - which is like option command J but I'm
09:22 - going to show you where it is under view
09:23 - under developer JavaScript console so
09:26 - this is what I want to find view
09:28 - developer JavaScript console if I click
09:30 - on this then I have my JavaScript
09:32 - console here and you can see here the
09:34 - messages set up I had a message once and
09:37 - then the draw function is getting
09:39 - printed out over and over again
09:40 - and by the way Chrome developer console
09:42 - is kind of smart it says like oh if it's
09:44 - the same message over and over again I'm
09:45 - just going to say how many times it's
09:47 - been printed and not keep showing it to
09:48 - you but if I did something like prints
09:51 - console dot log the frame count which is
09:54 - a built-in variable that's counting how
09:56 - many times the frame has executed and I
09:59 - hit save and go back to the browser and
10:01 - I hit refresh we can see here now that
10:03 - frame count is showing up in the console
10:06 - over and over and over again as a new
10:07 - number okay so this is the kind of thing
10:10 - you can do I can also just close that
10:12 - console by hitting the X and I can get
10:14 - back to it again through the menu or
10:16 - through a keyboard shortcut so these are
10:18 - all the pieces you need you need a place
10:20 - to type your code brackets sketch is you
10:24 - need a way to run that code and send it
10:26 - to the browser that through the live
10:28 - preview button and then you need to view
10:31 - the results in the browser and also
10:34 - check the console which is also the kind
10:36 - of place by the way if you're going to
10:37 - have error messages so if I were to do
10:39 - something like I'm trying to think of
10:41 - what a error message might be that if
10:45 - I'm going to miss spell background right
10:49 - by misspelled background and I go over
10:51 - here and hit refresh you're gonna see
10:52 - that's where I get my error message back
10:54 - gound is not defined because background
10:57 - is not actually a function its
10:58 - background so you also find error
11:00 - messages there and notice here it's
11:02 - saying sketchy-ass line number seven and
11:05 - over here what's on line number seven
11:07 - back down and I can see I need to change
11:09 - that within R ok so hopefully this helps
11:11 - you get started with making your p 5gs
11:14 - projects using brackets and let me know
11:17 - again in the comments if their questions
11:19 - confusing things I know that the most
11:21 - because I'm going to get it but my
11:23 - favorite editor is this or my favorite
11:25 - there this editor is better for this
11:26 - reason there are lots of editors lots of
11:29 - ways of viewing the results brackets
11:30 - just one of them I also have two other
11:32 - videos one that shows you something
11:33 - called sublime text and one that shows
11:35 - the atom editor and I'll link to those
11:37 - two videos in this video's description
11:38 - for a couple of our options as well and
11:40 - I'm actually going to make a couple more
11:42 - videos showing you a couple other things
11:44 - you could use to okay see you soon maybe
11:46 - in another video
11:52 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello it's me Dan coming to you strangely sort of from the future perhaps I'm not sure how you found this video but this video is about how to use p5.js with the brackets code editor and the reason why I'm making this video is I'm making it anybody could be watching this and it could be useful but I'm making it if you are right now a person watching this playlist if learning to program learning p5 is completely new to you and you're learning with my materials you'll notice that in all of these beginner videos I referenced something called the p5.js desktop editor so that desktop editor is no longer being supported you can still find it and download it and in this video I'll actually include a link to where you can download it but I would suggest that you use a different editor all the contents of code everything should still work and be the same in all of these video tutorials but you might want to follow along using a different editor there are lots of possibilities and perhaps I'll even make a few different videos show you different possibilities but in this particular video I'm going to show you how to get started from day one with a p5.js project in an editor called bracket so brackets you could fisa is an open source text editor that knows about the web and you can find it at bracket Co and when once you're there all you need to do is download brackets it's all in version 1.8 I'll have to come to you on the future was like even more this guy's like a lot more gray hair in this video than just what you just watched and then there'll be another one about you know this other futuristic editor where I've got my cane or something in here but anyway I haven't lost track here the point is a brackets 1.8 is the current version I already have it downloaded and over here as installed on my computer so if you want to follow along pause this video download it and then come back so I'm going to go ahead and launch bracket and here we go brackets is open and you can see it's kind of opening up with some default it's probably open up with some like getting started project in it for you and this is something I actually don't care about so much so really what I want to do is right now open a p5.js project the next thing I want to do is go back to the web this web page here and I have also over p5.js org slash download so this is previously where you would have downloaded that desktop editor I was referring to and now what I want to do is just download this complete library so you'll notice here this says p5.js p5 zambia people i've found that yet and an example project so this comes with a bunch of files which are the individual library files those like matter to you to some extent but for us right now we don't need that stuff what we really want is that example project so if you click that and download it you're going to get a file called a p5 zip and I already have it right here so this is the file that's going to download p5 dot zip and now I am going to extract that file and it appeared right over here and I'm also just going to open this up here so we can see so this is really this folder is the one that I care about the most this folder is all I ever need for the rest of my time programming and making beautiful p5 sketches so I'm going to rename it and I'm going to call it shipment p5 and then I'm just going to move it on to the desktop so it's it's own thing and you know I can even then just just because I'm so confident I'm going to get rid of that and I need to minimize this stuff to find that folder on my desktop which is over here so this is now my project folder I'll put it up here in the sky so this is now a project folder and it has what matters in it is that ultimately this sketchyass file this is where I'm going to write my p5.js code now what I'm going to do is go back to bracket and I'm going to go to file open folder this is important I want to open folder I could actually just that well open folder because I want that whole project folder to be open in bracket and then I'm going to go to my desktop and I'm going to click on shift in p5 it's right name that folder I'm going to hit open and there it is so you can see now it's a little hard to see but in the corner up here it shows that hey there's my folder and here's what here the files in it I can go into sketch jf I can add create canvas 400 400 I can say background 0 and I can say ellipse 200250 comma 50 so I've written my p5 sketch here it is and now here's the exciting thing right over here this little button here the give me a tooltip to say what it is I believe that is the live preview button so over in the top right hand corner over there is this little like lightning bolt and this lightning bolt is like a play button in a way it's called live preview so what this button is going to do it's going to take the folder that you have a code that you're working on and load it into your default web browser so that you can see the result so what I'm going to do and by the way I could get to this also for file live preview and you can see this is I don't know what this is all command P or shift command P or
