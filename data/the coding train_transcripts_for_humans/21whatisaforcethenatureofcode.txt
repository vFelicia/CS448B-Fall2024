00:02 - okay we're now in chapter two part two
00:05 - series two whatever you want to call it
00:06 - of this strange thing that we're doing
00:09 - hopefully it's not that strange it's
00:11 - very strange to me but I also am just
00:13 - afraid of the world and everything seems
00:14 - weird and uncomfortable but you this
00:16 - should make you comfortable it should
00:18 - make you interested and if not please
00:20 - there's a stop button there's a outside
00:22 - world there's trees Sunshine snow
00:25 - children playing there's so many things
00:27 - that you could do but we're here we're
00:29 - going to to keep going okay so a force
00:33 - is a
00:34 - vector that causes an object with mass
00:37 - to accelerate I prepared for this video
00:40 - by writing this up here a force is a
00:42 - vector that causes an object with mass
00:43 - to accelerate what do we mean by that
00:46 - this is an object with
00:47 - mass it it is experiencing forces right
00:50 - now there is perhaps some wind on it
00:54 - there is uh gravity pulling it down
00:57 - there's uh air resistance all of these
00:59 - things
01:00 - these are the things we want to model
01:02 - and our goal here is uh sorry for the
01:03 - little Clementine diversion but the goal
01:05 - here is to be able to write a processing
01:07 - sketch where a singular object on the
01:09 - screen experiences multiple forces at
01:11 - the same time those forces could turn
01:13 - off turn turn on turn off scale up scale
01:16 - down this is where we're going to get a
01:18 - dynamic simulation I'm recording
01:20 - excellent okay but let's see if we're
01:23 - ready to do this the good news about
01:25 - this definition is it proves that we are
01:28 - we we are very com comtable we know what
01:30 - a vector is a vector is a Quant is is an
01:33 - entity with magnitude and Direction
01:34 - check we know what acceleration is
01:37 - acceleration is the change in velocity
01:40 - over time and for us it's the change in
01:42 - velocity per frame per frame of
01:45 - Animation so we're pretty good here we
01:47 - know that we can define a vector P
01:49 - Vector Force equals new P vector and we
01:52 - can apply that Vector to acceleration
01:54 - velocity do add acceleration we're kind
01:56 - of done we did this already so this
01:59 - isn't the nice thing is this isn't new
02:00 - there is a new part to this which is a
02:03 - force is a vector that causes an object
02:05 - with mass to accelerate and you know
02:07 - just to demonstrate for a second not to
02:09 - not to belabor the Clementine but I do
02:11 - like Clementine this is an object with
02:15 - mass come on run processing sketch run
02:18 - the timing is
02:20 - off I had the perfect timing let me just
02:22 - try that again instead of editing myself
02:24 - this is an object with mass this is a
02:26 - bunch of pixels on a screen like colored
02:28 - gray there's no Mass there but we could
02:31 - invent Mass so in inventing mass or sort
02:33 - of like a proxy for mass in our code is
02:36 - something that we're going to have to
02:38 - look at not have to but it's going to be
02:39 - a useful thing for us to look at to make
02:41 - our simulation perhaps more realistic
02:43 - Dynamic to feel more I don't know just
02:47 - nice to make it nice that's our that's
02:49 - we should all be so happy as to have a
02:52 - simulation with maass okay so but back
02:54 - over here um so this is where we're
02:56 - going and we did this already so in
02:59 - essence in many ways this video it's a
03:01 - sad truth is is us just reorganizing our
03:04 - code to kind of separate out this part
03:07 - where the forces come into an object um
03:09 - from that update method but before we do
03:12 - any of that I think it is a
03:15 - useful it's it's use I just forgot to
03:18 - start the timer so I have no idea how
03:19 - long I've been going but it's a useful
03:21 - few minutes for us to just walk through
03:22 - Newton's Laws of Motion together this is
03:25 - the stuff of high school physics
03:26 - classrooms I'm sure that I will B the
03:30 - explanation but I will give you my best
03:32 - interpretation of those laws many of you
03:33 - will are hopefully experts in this stuff
03:35 - and will email me um um that I got it
03:38 - wrong and I'll fix it later or something
03:41 - um but um I one of the things we want to
03:44 - do here as an as an exercises say we
03:46 - want our simulations to obey Newton's
03:48 - Laws of Motion you probably ultimately
03:51 - want to break those Laws of Motion in
03:52 - many ways because you might be hoping to
03:54 - do something creative that's different
03:56 - to invent your own physics in a way but
03:58 - at least this a starting point we want
04:00 - to look at what is what what's the real
04:03 - what's happening in the real world can
04:05 - we make sure our code um matches that in
04:08 - some way and and uh keep going from
04:11 - there so let's actually look I I I I did
04:13 - prepare a little bit more for this video
04:14 - in that um rather than have to write
04:16 - this out uh let's see if I can do this
04:19 - okay here is Newton's first law an
04:22 - object at rest stays at rest and an
04:25 - object in motion stays in motion okay
04:27 - well really that's it's a little bit
04:29 - leading to state that here's the thing
04:31 - before Newton came along people thought
04:33 - that uh if you wanted something to keep
04:36 - going you had to keep applying a force
04:37 - to it so if I toss this in the air I
04:40 - don't throw this across the room and try
04:41 - not I'm going to throw this across the
04:42 - room ready there's a soft little sweater
04:45 - over there so okay landed on the sweater
04:47 - it stopped moving right to get it to
04:49 - keep moving I'd have to keep applying a
04:52 - force to it right so I'm going just feel
04:54 - the need to move over here now I can see
04:55 - that the Clementine's okay no
04:57 - Clementine's were hurt in the shooting
04:58 - of this video I really should redo this
05:00 - one we're going to keep going the point
05:02 - is that an object stay the an object's
05:06 - velocity never changes un it's the
05:08 - opposite of of of of this thing that
05:09 - people thought I have to keep pushing it
05:11 - the reason something slows down to a
05:12 - stop is because there's friction and air
05:15 - resistance and all these forces pushing
05:16 - in the opposite direction of velocity
05:18 - causing things in the real world to
05:20 - ultimately stop moving if you roll it
05:21 - along the ground but in a vacuum in the
05:24 - absence of forces or if the net force is
05:27 - zero an object's velocity stays constant
05:29 - it keeps moving in the same direction
05:31 - with the same speed or it stays at rest
05:33 - its velocity is zero and we could
05:35 - demonstrate that by this right this
05:37 - object the net force there is gravity
05:39 - but my thumb is somehow giving a force
05:41 - in the opposite direction the the net
05:43 - force on this object is zero so it stays
05:45 - at rest so one of the things this the
05:47 - reason why I lost my pen and not that I
05:49 - need it but it's like a comfort device
05:51 - it's like my it's my comfort device that
05:54 - I need device I don't know Comfort
05:55 - object that I need to hold to feel safe
05:58 - but um uh so the point is that um the
06:04 - point is there is a point the point is
06:07 - that we want this idea of a net force is
06:09 - really important we want to be able to
06:11 - accumulate our forces in such a way that
06:13 - if we add up all the forces together if
06:15 - the net force is zero the object's
06:17 - velocity is constant so we want to make
06:19 - sure our simulation obeys that rule
06:21 - that's Newton's law number one now
06:23 - Newton's law number three I'm going to
06:25 - do number out of order number three
06:26 - here's a diagram showing you net force
06:29 - is is uh Newton is is often stated this
06:32 - way for every action there was an equal
06:34 - and opposite reaction but this is a bit
06:35 - misleading it sounds like you know hey
06:38 - if I like punch you then your opposite
06:41 - reaction is equal and you punch me back
06:43 - no this is not really how things work um
06:46 - and I think h a better way of stating
06:48 - this if I could get back here is the
06:50 - following forces always occur in pairs
06:53 - the two forces are of equal strength but
06:55 - in opposite directions and a great
06:57 - demonstration if you'll just bear with
06:59 - me if I get my Clementine again is
07:01 - gravitational attraction so
07:03 - gravitational attraction occurs the
07:06 - force occurs in pairs now we think of
07:08 - gravity as this thing that makes stuff
07:10 - fall right that the Earth is sucking
07:12 - everything down into it and everything
07:15 - rests on the ground and that's why we're
07:17 - we have muscles to keep us standing
07:18 - upright and all sorts of stuff the truth
07:20 - of the matter is just as we just as the
07:22 - Earth exerts a gravitational force on us
07:25 - we exert a gravitational force on the
07:27 - earth just the Earth is so much bigger
07:28 - that it kind of overwhelmed the
07:30 - magnitude of that Force overwhelms our
07:32 - little tiny tiny Force but the force
07:35 - occurs in pairs now this this is this
07:38 - brings up an interesting question for
07:39 - our simulation every time we create a
07:42 - force do we need to create another Force
07:44 - do we have to implement this pairs thing
07:47 - the answer to that question strangely is
07:49 - no Newton's third law is something that
07:52 - we're going to not worry about too much
07:54 - I mean after all are we when we have an
07:56 - ellipse moving around the the SC the the
07:58 - window are we simul ating the force that
08:00 - it applies to all the air particles
08:02 - around it and all the air particles
08:03 - apply Force back and the gravity of the
08:06 - this and the that and all this stuff no
08:08 - we're just kind of saying like yeah it's
08:10 - a vector put it in the acceleration that
08:12 - kind of looks right so we're doing a
08:14 - kind of Loosey Goosey simulation in a
08:16 - lot of these basic examples that we're
08:18 - going to see in a
08:19 - moment the thing is there are times
08:22 - where you really do want these pairs if
08:24 - you are doing a Celestial body
08:26 - simulation with kind of gravitational
08:28 - attraction and everything's attracted to
08:30 - everything this is where you want to say
08:32 - for every object apply that force in
08:35 - pairs both of these are attracted to
08:37 - each other and then if I could if I had
08:39 - three hands or actually I can juggle but
08:40 - I don't have a third Clementine I guess
08:42 - maybe I can do it with no no no uh L in
08:44 - another video juggling video no you
08:46 - don't want to see that so um this is
08:49 - Newton's third law is an important law
08:51 - for us to be aware of but for the most
08:52 - part it's a it's a point of realization
08:55 - where we're not actually simulating with
08:58 - Incredible prec ision um the the the the
09:01 - force of everybody acting on everybody
09:04 - in in fact there's no I mean a circle
09:05 - moving around the screen is it scraping
09:07 - against the back of the screen is it f
09:09 - like what what's even going on there so
09:11 - we have to realize that there's this
09:12 - sort of pretend thing that we're
09:14 - creating I should re-record this video
09:17 - because if I did this again I would cut
09:18 - out all this extra nonsense but um um
09:20 - time is of the essence we're going to
09:21 - keep going uh the good thing is you can
09:24 - always fast forward or stop or quit or
09:26 - download delete whatever okay so
09:28 - Newton's second law
09:30 - new Second Law essentially restates this
09:32 - definition and this is the law that is
09:34 - the most important to us this is the law
09:36 - that is going to instigate us to write a
09:38 - new function in our processing sketch
09:40 - right so let's look at this law force
09:44 - and technically speaking this should
09:45 - really say net force but let's just be
09:47 - simpler about it for right now Force
09:50 - equals
09:52 - masstimes acceleration awesome Force
09:55 - equals mass time acceleration we know
09:58 - right we wrote this update
10:00 - function in our processing sketch that
10:03 - update function had
10:05 - location. add velocity it had velocity.
10:11 - add location and we asked this question
10:14 - in every sketch that we write ah
10:16 - velocity. add
10:18 - acceleration in every sketch that we
10:20 - write what is our algorithm for
10:22 - acceleration that is the moment where we
10:25 - put our creativity our control our
10:27 - algorithm our math our idea into our
10:29 - sketch this is the standard motion
10:31 - algorithm this is where we're putting
10:33 - our stamp on it now we're saying let's
10:35 - use this formula well Force equals mass
10:37 - and acceleration acceleration
10:40 - equals force I can do this divided by
10:43 - mass right divide both sides of the
10:45 - equation by mass we have four
10:47 - acceleration equals force divided by
10:49 - mass the interesting thing about this is
10:51 - I have an idea one of the things I would
10:53 - like to do someday is live in a world
10:55 - where the mass of everything is equal to
10:56 - one and if you ever wanted that you can
10:59 - do by programming your own world right
11:01 - so if you program your own world you can
11:03 - just say the mass of everything in that
11:04 - world is one and if Mass equals one what
11:07 - are we were saying here acceleration
11:08 - equals force look how simple Newton's
11:11 - law is force is a vector that causes an
11:13 - object with mass to accelerate
11:14 - acceleration equals force acceleration
11:17 - equals
11:18 - force so this is the essence of what
11:22 - we're about to do acceleration equals
11:26 - force it's funny like when we answer a
11:28 - question by asking another question we
11:30 - said okay you know what everything is
11:32 - always about what is your algorithm for
11:33 - acceleration and now we just said no no
11:35 - no no acceleration equals force and now
11:37 - we have the question what is your
11:39 - algorithm for force and this is the
11:42 - question we're going to answer in all in
11:44 - the next series of future videos we're
11:46 - going to look at I don't know let's just
11:47 - make up forces we're going to make up
11:49 - forces with some numbers and apply them
11:51 - to objects then we're going to look at
11:52 - ah I found this physics textbook and has
11:54 - a formula in it could we apply that
11:56 - formula in our code to simulate fluid
11:58 - resistance or friction or drag or
12:00 - gravitational attraction um tension
12:03 - there any number of forces you can think
12:05 - of you could find a formula for them
12:06 - rewrite that formula in code and apply
12:08 - it to your object so this is where we're
12:10 - going now that we've answered we we sort
12:13 - of answered the question of how we're
12:15 - going to apply Newton's law and and we
12:16 - will get to mass we will put Mass back
12:19 - into this um equation here but we're
12:21 - going to wait for that for a moment um
12:24 - uh and we'll get to that eventually so I
12:25 - think actually this is a good place to
12:26 - stop this video what I like about this
12:28 - is I feel like this video is kind of
12:29 - just rambling explanation of Newton's
12:31 - Laws so anybody should feel free to skip
12:33 - it and go on to the next one where we're
12:34 - really going to dive into the code okay
12:37 - um thank you I don't know if I should
12:40 - thank you but I really feel the need to
12:43 - um and uh see you later

Cleaned transcript:

okay we're now in chapter two part two series two whatever you want to call it of this strange thing that we're doing hopefully it's not that strange it's very strange to me but I also am just afraid of the world and everything seems weird and uncomfortable but you this should make you comfortable it should make you interested and if not please there's a stop button there's a outside world there's trees Sunshine snow children playing there's so many things that you could do but we're here we're going to to keep going okay so a force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate I prepared for this video by writing this up here a force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate what do we mean by that this is an object with mass it it is experiencing forces right now there is perhaps some wind on it there is uh gravity pulling it down there's uh air resistance all of these things these are the things we want to model and our goal here is uh sorry for the little Clementine diversion but the goal here is to be able to write a processing sketch where a singular object on the screen experiences multiple forces at the same time those forces could turn off turn turn on turn off scale up scale down this is where we're going to get a dynamic simulation I'm recording excellent okay but let's see if we're ready to do this the good news about this definition is it proves that we are we we are very com comtable we know what a vector is a vector is a Quant is is an entity with magnitude and Direction check we know what acceleration is acceleration is the change in velocity over time and for us it's the change in velocity per frame per frame of Animation so we're pretty good here we know that we can define a vector P Vector Force equals new P vector and we can apply that Vector to acceleration velocity do add acceleration we're kind of done we did this already so this isn't the nice thing is this isn't new there is a new part to this which is a force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate and you know just to demonstrate for a second not to not to belabor the Clementine but I do like Clementine this is an object with mass come on run processing sketch run the timing is off I had the perfect timing let me just try that again instead of editing myself this is an object with mass this is a bunch of pixels on a screen like colored gray there's no Mass there but we could invent Mass so in inventing mass or sort of like a proxy for mass in our code is something that we're going to have to look at not have to but it's going to be a useful thing for us to look at to make our simulation perhaps more realistic Dynamic to feel more I don't know just nice to make it nice that's our that's we should all be so happy as to have a simulation with maass okay so but back over here um so this is where we're going and we did this already so in essence in many ways this video it's a sad truth is is us just reorganizing our code to kind of separate out this part where the forces come into an object um from that update method but before we do any of that I think it is a useful it's it's use I just forgot to start the timer so I have no idea how long I've been going but it's a useful few minutes for us to just walk through Newton's Laws of Motion together this is the stuff of high school physics classrooms I'm sure that I will B the explanation but I will give you my best interpretation of those laws many of you will are hopefully experts in this stuff and will email me um um that I got it wrong and I'll fix it later or something um but um I one of the things we want to do here as an as an exercises say we want our simulations to obey Newton's Laws of Motion you probably ultimately want to break those Laws of Motion in many ways because you might be hoping to do something creative that's different to invent your own physics in a way but at least this a starting point we want to look at what is what what's the real what's happening in the real world can we make sure our code um matches that in some way and and uh keep going from there so let's actually look I I I I did prepare a little bit more for this video in that um rather than have to write this out uh let's see if I can do this okay here is Newton's first law an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion okay well really that's it's a little bit leading to state that here's the thing before Newton came along people thought that uh if you wanted something to keep going you had to keep applying a force to it so if I toss this in the air I don't throw this across the room and try not I'm going to throw this across the room ready there's a soft little sweater over there so okay landed on the sweater it stopped moving right to get it to keep moving I'd have to keep applying a force to it right so I'm going just feel the need to move over here now I can see that the Clementine's okay no Clementine's were hurt in the shooting of this video I really should redo this one we're going to keep going the point is that an object stay the an object's velocity never changes un it's the opposite of of of of this thing that people thought I have to keep pushing it the reason something slows down to a stop is because there's friction and air resistance and all these forces pushing in the opposite direction of velocity causing things in the real world to ultimately stop moving if you roll it along the ground but in a vacuum in the absence of forces or if the net force is zero an object's velocity stays constant it keeps moving in the same direction with the same speed or it stays at rest its velocity is zero and we could demonstrate that by this right this object the net force there is gravity but my thumb is somehow giving a force in the opposite direction the the net force on this object is zero so it stays at rest so one of the things this the reason why I lost my pen and not that I need it but it's like a comfort device it's like my it's my comfort device that I need device I don't know Comfort object that I need to hold to feel safe but um uh so the point is that um the point is there is a point the point is that we want this idea of a net force is really important we want to be able to accumulate our forces in such a way that if we add up all the forces together if the net force is zero the object's velocity is constant so we want to make sure our simulation obeys that rule that's Newton's law number one now Newton's law number three I'm going to do number out of order number three here's a diagram showing you net force is is uh Newton is is often stated this way for every action there was an equal and opposite reaction but this is a bit misleading it sounds like you know hey if I like punch you then your opposite reaction is equal and you punch me back no this is not really how things work um and I think h a better way of stating this if I could get back here is the following forces always occur in pairs the two forces are of equal strength but in opposite directions and a great demonstration if you'll just bear with me if I get my Clementine again is gravitational attraction so gravitational attraction occurs the force occurs in pairs now we think of gravity as this thing that makes stuff fall right that the Earth is sucking everything down into it and everything rests on the ground and that's why we're we have muscles to keep us standing upright and all sorts of stuff the truth of the matter is just as we just as the Earth exerts a gravitational force on us we exert a gravitational force on the earth just the Earth is so much bigger that it kind of overwhelmed the magnitude of that Force overwhelms our little tiny tiny Force but the force occurs in pairs now this this is this brings up an interesting question for our simulation every time we create a force do we need to create another Force do we have to implement this pairs thing the answer to that question strangely is no Newton's third law is something that we're going to not worry about too much I mean after all are we when we have an ellipse moving around the the SC the the window are we simul ating the force that it applies to all the air particles around it and all the air particles apply Force back and the gravity of the this and the that and all this stuff no we're just kind of saying like yeah it's a vector put it in the acceleration that kind of looks right so we're doing a kind of Loosey Goosey simulation in a lot of these basic examples that we're going to see in a moment the thing is there are times where you really do want these pairs if you are doing a Celestial body simulation with kind of gravitational attraction and everything's attracted to everything this is where you want to say for every object apply that force in pairs both of these are attracted to each other and then if I could if I had three hands or actually I can juggle but I don't have a third Clementine I guess maybe I can do it with no no no uh L in another video juggling video no you don't want to see that so um this is Newton's third law is an important law for us to be aware of but for the most part it's a it's a point of realization where we're not actually simulating with Incredible prec ision um the the the the force of everybody acting on everybody in in fact there's no I mean a circle moving around the screen is it scraping against the back of the screen is it f like what what's even going on there so we have to realize that there's this sort of pretend thing that we're creating I should rerecord this video because if I did this again I would cut out all this extra nonsense but um um time is of the essence we're going to keep going uh the good thing is you can always fast forward or stop or quit or download delete whatever okay so Newton's second law new Second Law essentially restates this definition and this is the law that is the most important to us this is the law that is going to instigate us to write a new function in our processing sketch right so let's look at this law force and technically speaking this should really say net force but let's just be simpler about it for right now Force equals masstimes acceleration awesome Force equals mass time acceleration we know right we wrote this update function in our processing sketch that update function had location. add velocity it had velocity. add location and we asked this question in every sketch that we write ah velocity. add acceleration in every sketch that we write what is our algorithm for acceleration that is the moment where we put our creativity our control our algorithm our math our idea into our sketch this is the standard motion algorithm this is where we're putting our stamp on it now we're saying let's use this formula well Force equals mass and acceleration acceleration equals force I can do this divided by mass right divide both sides of the equation by mass we have four acceleration equals force divided by mass the interesting thing about this is I have an idea one of the things I would like to do someday is live in a world where the mass of everything is equal to one and if you ever wanted that you can do by programming your own world right so if you program your own world you can just say the mass of everything in that world is one and if Mass equals one what are we were saying here acceleration equals force look how simple Newton's law is force is a vector that causes an object with mass to accelerate acceleration equals force acceleration equals force so this is the essence of what we're about to do acceleration equals force it's funny like when we answer a question by asking another question we said okay you know what everything is always about what is your algorithm for acceleration and now we just said no no no no acceleration equals force and now we have the question what is your algorithm for force and this is the question we're going to answer in all in the next series of future videos we're going to look at I don't know let's just make up forces we're going to make up forces with some numbers and apply them to objects then we're going to look at ah I found this physics textbook and has a formula in it could we apply that formula in our code to simulate fluid resistance or friction or drag or gravitational attraction um tension there any number of forces you can think of you could find a formula for them rewrite that formula in code and apply it to your object so this is where we're going now that we've answered we we sort of answered the question of how we're going to apply Newton's law and and we will get to mass we will put Mass back into this um equation here but we're going to wait for that for a moment um uh and we'll get to that eventually so I think actually this is a good place to stop this video what I like about this is I feel like this video is kind of just rambling explanation of Newton's Laws so anybody should feel free to skip it and go on to the next one where we're really going to dive into the code okay um thank you I don't know if I should thank you but I really feel the need to um and uh see you later
