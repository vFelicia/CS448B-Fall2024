With timestamps:

00:00 - haha hello it is the springtime Oh in
the summer is right around the corner
00:04 - and guess what it was just the ITP show
here just a few days ago what is ITP you
00:08 - might be asking ITP is a two-year
master's program right here at Tisch
00:12 - School of the Arts at New York
University it's where I teach it's where
00:14 - I spend almost all of my time and the
show of the student work just happened
00:18 - earlier this week I did a livestream you
can watch the full two-hour archive
00:22 - of me wandering around with a microphone. Link to that in this video's
00:26 - description. But if you just want to see
a shorter highlight reel of some of the
00:29 - projects, all the amazing crazy things
the weird stuff that the students are up
00:33 - to here take a look at this video. More
information about all the projects in
00:36 - this video's description links and all
the people's names and all that sort of
00:40 - stuff so thanks for watching and I'll be
back soon with coding tutorial perhaps
00:43 - goodbye
00:59 - my name is Jim Schmitz and this is my
Google Streetview style of transfer
01:04 - project the idea is to take pictures
from Google Street View and then apply a
01:09 - style transfer algorithm to all the
frames to make an animation so it looks
01:14 - like you're flying through a animated
painting in this case the highway in
01:20 - Idaho is being transformed a combination
of seated nude by Picasso and this other
01:26 - photograph by cat Connor and
photographer so my name is Ella Nichols
01:31 - and I created an interactive cubist
mirror i'm calling at the painting
01:35 - mirror because if you stand close enough
to it you'll see fragmented reflections
01:40 - of yourself and you can move those
pieces around and create your own
01:43 - portrait does it like so this is just
it's left over in the position from
01:49 - where people were before yes the shapes
are but the let's live video moving into
01:54 - the shapes if you find something that
you like you can double tap the screen
01:57 - and the preserve it on Instagram and
pick it up later
02:50 - so my name is tarek Gutierrez and I just
completed my first year at ITP my piece
02:56 - is entitled misunderstood it's an
interactive installation where you can
03:01 - place on this hoodie and when you flip
up the hood you hear this audio
03:04 - narrative of a young black boys
encounter with a police officer so it's
03:08 - a two-part narrative the first part is
me telling my actual story so when I was
03:13 - 13 years old I was stopped by a white
police officer
03:16 - so I'm recounting that in the first
aspect of the narrative the second
03:20 - aspect is more speculative aspect of
like what could have happened so I'm
03:23 - tired with the piece misunderstood
because I think it's often times at that
03:28 - point of misunderstanding where these
incidents of police brutality become
03:32 - deadly I didn't realize there was gonna
be like tactile feedback and that really
03:36 - surprised me and I think that's there
was very loud gunshots and I would feel
03:41 - vibrating in the in parts of the hoodie
which really you know I I do I probably
03:45 - shouldn't be listening to this anymore
because I'm doing this like live stream
03:48 - but it was I just didn't want to didn't
want to take it off so it's really
03:51 - impact that's great thank you great work
Tarek my name is ty my project is poly
03:58 - note which is a sequencer a web-based
multiplayer sequencer
04:06 - these are different instruments that you
kind of pick and then you can put them
04:15 - on the world the color and the shape is
the instrument and the velocity
04:22 - determine the height determines the
amplitude and it's completely a multi
04:27 - player so what happens here is going to
be here the same pattern and we can play
04:33 - together anything like that yeah
04:44 - hey I'm Anthony I'm Keith Donna I'm
Kathy and I'm Asha and this is our
04:50 - project search divides us so search
divides us is a project made for playful
04:55 - communications of serious research so
what we tried to do was take a serious
04:58 - research topic which was bias and search
engine optimization and then communicate
05:03 - that playfully and so for this class we
were tasked to collaborate with an NYU
05:08 - professor and dr. Charlton McIlwain and
he's concerned with how the way that the
05:15 - Internet's architecture currently works
today limit and constrains what we
05:20 - actually see and this can create
eventually segregation and problematic
05:23 - ways we've created a kind of a fun game
to express that so this is what the
05:27 - search engine thinks you should live
based on your profile has found one
05:31 - recommendation for you
Ahmadi mosey on oh this is my thesis
05:36 - project Ohio which is a line of neo
retro experimental cameras so basically
05:41 - emerges the digital and analog photo
experience so you take photos with a
05:46 - digital camera but it immediately
applies filters that mimic the quality
05:50 - of a film camera and it mimics the whole
experience and there's no screen and all
05:55 - of that and if people want to find out
more or you do you have a website about
06:00 - it yet or what can you tell us what the
URL is which is oj Oro and where does
06:06 - the name come from it's Spanish
a little is Spanish for gold and I
06:09 - translate it to English so it means
really that these are essentially tools
06:13 - for you to explore your own artistry or
goal tonight hi my name is Xue and my
06:17 - project is called it will be perfect
from now on it's a kinetic sculpture and
06:23 - it
as a research on being an only child
06:25 - under the one-child policy in China and
then it got bigger and I started
06:29 - thinking about how power structures and
policy affect individuals and identities
06:35 - and their individuality so I decided to
create this kinetic sculpture as a
06:39 - response to that and basically it's an
artificial erosion of stones with my
06:55 - name is Roland Arnold and I am
interested in true randomness because
07:01 - computational randomness is kind of fake
I don't want this so I was interested
07:06 - how can I create true randomness and how
can I make to wreden is somehow a
07:09 - spiritual experience to people so I
created a stone that when you knock at
07:15 - it and you align with true randomness of
the radioactive particles inside that
07:22 - stone when the patterns match it knocks
back at you so basically the universe
07:28 - talks back to you because the to
randomness is kind of a force in the
07:32 - universe the universe is talking to me
so I'm Barack so we're together work on
07:45 - this
and we got inspiration from the prisoner
07:50 - system panopticon and try to create this
project that express our concern about
07:56 - mass surveillance this is surveillance
footage from cameras that we set up all
08:00 - over the floor and it captures faces and
when you come in front of the
08:02 - installation it captures your face from
the camera on top and indexes you
08:06 - against all of the photos that we found
so you only realize you're being
08:08 - surveilled on once you come and face
your surveilled image and so this camera
08:13 - at the top that's never showing the
image from that camera here I know that
08:17 - one is capturing your face and indexing
them and across all of the images from
08:21 - the floor Wow hi my name is ivy and this
is actually a group project but my two
08:26 - partners they have their own project
over there so this project is based on
08:31 - research paper from neuroscience
Department of Hawaii and research is
08:38 - about the imbalance of the human brain
and so you know brain there's two
08:42 - neurons which one the one is excitation
is intubation so when they're not when
08:48 - they're not balanced they're gonna have
seizures or depression or sickness other
08:52 - sickness so people can classic play and
standing on those quads to find the
08:57 - balance of the brain so the white color
is balanced so you can step on one thank
09:02 - you
09:20 - hi I'm one Jimmy this is my project
madam Bhaskar
09:25 - it's a to Kate about using creative
technology to do straight performance
09:30 - and also this is a performance at date
two weeks ago at Washington Square Park
09:35 - so generally when I'm at is I'm using
programming which is like a web
09:41 - technology and the credit like this
socket among all the users like always
09:46 - in a park and they can connect it to my
backpack which in which I can use my
09:53 - MIDI controller to send away shows and
sound to their phone to create is like
09:58 - very large soundscape so it's kind of
like everybody in the space x star to
10:03 - jam together and that's why i did in
this project hi I'm sandy and I've been
10:09 - growing conductive crystallized textile
mana crops
10:14 - who had been growing textiles with
embellish crystals
10:19 - she used salt crystals and so I decided
to grow them using the electrolysis and
10:24 - copper so how it works is that I have a
positive and negative terminal and then
10:29 - I'm submerging it an electrolyte
solution
10:33 - when I apply current that moves positive
ions over to the negative terminal and
10:38 - then it forms crystals over time so if
you look over there you can see the
10:42 - crystals forming and these are some of
my swatches close under a microscope
10:51 - they have a very interesting composition
and the most exciting thing is their
10:58 - conductive so you can also see over
there it's powering a working circuit so
11:04 - it has really interesting applications I
think my employee
11:10 - I'm fond of a socket and we made this VR
piece called missing 10 hours which is a
11:16 - multiplayer game within one person is in
the we are experiencing a girl story who
11:21 - lost all her memories because by a rape
drug called GHB and the other person is
11:28 - controlling if the characters the two
guys in VR are doing good things or bad
11:32 - things to her it's also a multi ending
games so depends depends on the person
11:38 - who's holding the control panel right
there
11:41 - you experience different things and have
different endings of the stories so we
11:47 - have all like totally sixteen ending
into the story I'm not even on this and
11:52 - I'm cher Chaudhary and we're gonna
divide this time so this is living
11:57 - canvas and this is like data
visualization with living organisms so
12:01 - what we did is like we trace people's
paths on the force and we cross that
12:05 - information with some samples that we
took from the different parts of the
12:08 - bill for the floor with bacteria because
that information to see how it looked
12:14 - like so this is 10 I to be students in
just one day and I have your parts drawn
12:18 - as to where you walked and where you
moved around and after you've done all
12:23 - of that then we're making the robot
print the seats filled also the best
12:28 - part is that the robot moves on an XY
also that the
12:32 - you work with the robot and when it's
moving on your part you are planting
12:36 - your own seeds
12:58 - I'm Isabella and I'm IO
the project was made for a class called
13:06 - nothing creating illusions and it's a
three minute video installation that
13:12 - uses projection mapping and
13:17 - basically we don't like to reveal too
much of what the narrative sort of
13:20 - treats but it's three minutes and it's
the first person narrative alone
13:26 - astronauts and his last thoughts hi i'm
i'm mohammed i'm this project is called
13:39 - by the way hi mom and dad in iran when
I'm gonna show this to you later but
13:43 - this project is called reactive display
which is the idea is like you always
13:48 - look leaning closer to look closer at
things so why doesn't that thing help
13:52 - you out so for example when I look at
look at this painting from up close then
13:59 - I can see all the better a better
example would be like the math charge
14:05 - you know you're in the subway you want
to look closer at the map to where
14:08 - you're going you always look close and
it's very small but that can't be like
14:12 - okay what's a good Union and I can look
at Union or like my stuff there's useful
14:17 - I can look at that my name is Anita Bob
Ozzie and my project is about energy was
14:25 - actually for my energy class it's an
artistic representation of the different
14:30 - energy sources around the world so from
this screen you can see what the
14:36 - different colors represent so the yellow
LEDs represent an solar car the blue
14:42 - represent hydro red represents oil and
then green is biofuels white is wind
14:49 - energy so it's it's just on an artistic
piece and so from here you can see what
14:58 - different countries you is what
different form of energy as yes as a
15:03 - source of energy I'm Graham my project
is
15:07 - but this applying a yard to cardiac
patients this is an uncommon reality a
15:14 - house platform to deliver education and
improve medication and hores say I'm a
15:21 - cardiac patient after my surgery I had
to take several medicines in one day so
15:30 - I hoping this app can the text on the
bottom I want to show this to make it
15:36 - clear it's 3d animated heart is telling
me why this blood bit about her could
15:59 - help you to decrease my heart rate and
as an decrease in my bladder failure
16:05 - Brett bladder pressure hi I'm cami
Sawadee and this is the Handy it's a
16:11 - soft robotic to help people with
neuromuscular disorders regain finger
16:15 - strength through rehabilitation
exercises like I said this is a glove
16:20 - and so really what happens is that when
a person's fingers are so weak it's sort
16:27 - of flops down and once it reaches this
stage the muscles don't allow the person
16:33 - to open and close their fingers so this
helps with open and close enough fingers
16:39 - and also to teach a person how to do
functional things like pick up before or
16:44 - get dressed or something like that so
usually like the first stage of this
16:50 - would be in the occupational therapists
office when the person gets fitted they
16:53 - now put on the glove and so now the
finger is in the glove and this helps
16:57 - them move it so it helps them bend and
straighten and then pick objects up my
17:05 - name is Molly
and I make this project called crossings
17:08 - which is all idea the 3d scanning of my
body then I come a body in three
17:13 - different pieces and reassemble them
into the shape of the landscape yeah and
17:18 - I make the animation based on the 3d
model that I have and it shows the seven
17:22 - changes
17:32 - my name is quick pop it here I try to
have a kind of performance and you can
17:42 - perform as usual you don't think that
you are familiar with and you can test
17:49 - the project and yet see what happens I
use different Mahler for simulating the
17:56 - movement as I want I use different motor
for moving the upon the x and y x and
18:02 - y-axes are also dizzy for the movement
of the body
18:06 - hi my name is Metro and I'm here to show
you kilograms kilograms is a slick pitch
18:11 - animation technique it is also a
photobooth so people have taken pictures
18:14 - over here if you can probably so if you
notice actually let me bring this down
18:19 - so this is mother of one of our
residents and you can see her not sure
18:24 - how you see that it looks nicer on
camera interesting
18:27 - so dance gonna dance gonna take a one
picture over four seconds so it
18:30 - basically takes four pictures over four
seconds just do one motion slowly I'm
18:34 - going to say go ready and go
18:41 - so this is one that looks like I'm gonna
print that out so the photo that you
18:45 - took a while ago this is the same photo
that you took a while ago I need to line
18:48 - it properly but you kind of see it red
yeah so that's what you get my name is
18:53 - Effie and my project it's called
travelling New York men let's call it
18:58 - because I utilized the classic traveling
salesman problem and a genetic algorithm
19:05 - to solve this finding the shortest route
issue and also this is like a practical
19:11 - adaptation of it because I'm actually
using it in a real-world problem which
19:16 - is planning a travel route so these are
all the gardens and parks in New York
19:21 - City we can go to Jamaica Bay and then I
go to confirm and you can see the
19:28 - computer kind of just do it instantly oh
wow that was very fast how many points
19:32 - with that just now
19:39 - a little bit of animation to take you
through all around
20:12 - you

Cleaned transcript:

haha hello it is the springtime Oh in the summer is right around the corner and guess what it was just the ITP show here just a few days ago what is ITP you might be asking ITP is a twoyear master's program right here at Tisch School of the Arts at New York University it's where I teach it's where I spend almost all of my time and the show of the student work just happened earlier this week I did a livestream you can watch the full twohour archive of me wandering around with a microphone. Link to that in this video's description. But if you just want to see a shorter highlight reel of some of the projects, all the amazing crazy things the weird stuff that the students are up to here take a look at this video. More information about all the projects in this video's description links and all the people's names and all that sort of stuff so thanks for watching and I'll be back soon with coding tutorial perhaps goodbye my name is Jim Schmitz and this is my Google Streetview style of transfer project the idea is to take pictures from Google Street View and then apply a style transfer algorithm to all the frames to make an animation so it looks like you're flying through a animated painting in this case the highway in Idaho is being transformed a combination of seated nude by Picasso and this other photograph by cat Connor and photographer so my name is Ella Nichols and I created an interactive cubist mirror i'm calling at the painting mirror because if you stand close enough to it you'll see fragmented reflections of yourself and you can move those pieces around and create your own portrait does it like so this is just it's left over in the position from where people were before yes the shapes are but the let's live video moving into the shapes if you find something that you like you can double tap the screen and the preserve it on Instagram and pick it up later so my name is tarek Gutierrez and I just completed my first year at ITP my piece is entitled misunderstood it's an interactive installation where you can place on this hoodie and when you flip up the hood you hear this audio narrative of a young black boys encounter with a police officer so it's a twopart narrative the first part is me telling my actual story so when I was 13 years old I was stopped by a white police officer so I'm recounting that in the first aspect of the narrative the second aspect is more speculative aspect of like what could have happened so I'm tired with the piece misunderstood because I think it's often times at that point of misunderstanding where these incidents of police brutality become deadly I didn't realize there was gonna be like tactile feedback and that really surprised me and I think that's there was very loud gunshots and I would feel vibrating in the in parts of the hoodie which really you know I I do I probably shouldn't be listening to this anymore because I'm doing this like live stream but it was I just didn't want to didn't want to take it off so it's really impact that's great thank you great work Tarek my name is ty my project is poly note which is a sequencer a webbased multiplayer sequencer these are different instruments that you kind of pick and then you can put them on the world the color and the shape is the instrument and the velocity determine the height determines the amplitude and it's completely a multi player so what happens here is going to be here the same pattern and we can play together anything like that yeah hey I'm Anthony I'm Keith Donna I'm Kathy and I'm Asha and this is our project search divides us so search divides us is a project made for playful communications of serious research so what we tried to do was take a serious research topic which was bias and search engine optimization and then communicate that playfully and so for this class we were tasked to collaborate with an NYU professor and dr.

scanning of my body then I come a body in three different pieces and reassemble them into the shape of the landscape yeah and I make the animation based on the 3d model that I have and it shows the seven changes my name is quick pop it here I try to have a kind of performance and you can perform as usual you don't think that you are familiar with and you can test the project and yet see what happens I use different Mahler for simulating the movement as I want I use different motor for moving the upon the x and y x and yaxes are also dizzy for the movement of the body hi my name is Metro and I'm here to show you kilograms kilograms is a slick pitch animation technique it is also a photobooth so people have taken pictures over here if you can probably so if you notice actually let me

took a while ago this is the same photo that you took a while ago I need to line it properly but you kind of see it red yeah so that's what you get my name is Effie and my project it's called travelling New York men let's call it because I utilized the classic traveling salesman problem and a genetic algorithm to solve this finding the shortest route issue and also this is like a practical adaptation of it because I'm actually using it in a realworld problem which is planning a travel route so these are all the gardens and parks in New York City we can go to Jamaica Bay and then I go to confirm and you can see the computer kind of just do it instantly oh wow that was very fast how many points with that just now a little bit of animation to take you through all around you
