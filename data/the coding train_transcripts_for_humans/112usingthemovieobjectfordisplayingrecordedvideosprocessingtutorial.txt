00:00 - okay so let's very briefly now just look
00:04 - at a few key differences between using a
00:07 - recorded file a file for a quartic movie
00:10 - from a file versus a live capture object
00:12 - from a live camera so um we saw that
00:16 - there that we could make a new capture
00:19 - object and we have to give a width and a
00:21 - height of frames per second we've used
00:23 - the keyword this all the same thing is
00:25 - true with a movie object actually done
00:28 - put another thing is the same thing is
00:31 - not true we do have to make eight use
00:33 - make a new movie object and we have to
00:35 - use the keyword this but we don't give a
00:38 - width and a height a frame rate what we
00:40 - need to do is reference a particular
00:43 - file so just like you could load an
00:46 - image from your data folder you can load
00:48 - a movie file from your data folder and
00:50 - then this is a p image so you can use
00:52 - the image function the tint function you
00:53 - can look at the pixels but we need a few
00:57 - more key pieces just like we had that
01:00 - capture event what we need a movie event
01:04 - where we're going to read images from
01:10 - the movie as the movies playing let's
01:12 - give us the current frame the current
01:13 - frame the current frame but I think a
01:16 - bit more important than that in terms of
01:18 - the difference here is that there are
01:19 - some functions like jump the jump
01:23 - function allows you to jump to a certain
01:26 - spot in the movie so if you want to
01:29 - whenever the user clicks the mouse go
01:32 - back to the beginning of the movie you
01:34 - can do that by saying jump zero and this
01:36 - is in seconds processing uses seconds to
01:40 - to mark what point in the movie is a
01:43 - floating point number so you could say
01:44 - if your key thing happens at you know
01:46 - 103 point seven seconds you can jump to
01:50 - that spot in the movie but the time
01:53 - function gives you the current moment in
01:56 - time where is the movie currently the
01:58 - duration function gives you the length
02:01 - of the movie in seconds which is a
02:02 - useful piece of information to know if
02:04 - you want to go to the middle you go to
02:05 - duration divided by two and there's also
02:08 - some functions like speed which will
02:10 - allow you to speed up the playback so if
02:13 - I
02:13 - put speed and I put the number two in
02:15 - here it's going to play back twice as
02:17 - fast you can actually use a negative
02:19 - number to make the movie play in Reverse
02:21 - but only certain codecs codec being the
02:24 - format by which the file is encoded how
02:27 - that movie file was made support that so
02:29 - there is some bugginess here with with
02:31 - speed with with reverse with speed in
02:33 - particular this often evens a little bit
02:35 - of bugginess with using jump and that
02:36 - sort of thing but for the most part you
02:38 - can use these functions to really mess
02:40 - around with how you playback a movie so
02:42 - let's just let's just come over here and
02:44 - kind of see that I'm using a sample
02:46 - movie file that's in all the examples
02:49 - that come with processing so if I were
02:50 - to change this from capture to movie and
02:52 - I'm going to say make a new movie and
02:54 - the name of my movie file is called
02:58 - transit dot move and I don't with a
03:03 - movie instead of saying start you're
03:05 - going to say play and better yet I can
03:07 - actually say loop what loop will do is
03:09 - when it gets to the end it will start so
03:11 - if you want a video to loop and then
03:13 - instead of capture event we've got a
03:16 - movie event and then I should be able to
03:19 - draw it so if I run this we should see
03:22 - this video file playing back and as you
03:27 - can see in the data folder there is just
03:29 - a movie files in the data folder there
03:32 - it is here it is being displayed in the
03:34 - processing sketch and it's looping and
03:36 - just to see a few of these features if I
03:39 - were to say video dot speed 4 and run
03:44 - this you should see that it's playing
03:46 - four times as fast I could certainly try
03:50 - doing something like you know have a
03:54 - rate which map Mouse X between 0 and the
03:57 - width between 0 & 4 and then I could say
04:00 - movie speed R so this is me just
04:04 - dynamically in real time oh it's called
04:07 - video in this the variable name is video
04:09 - here what I'm doing is saying like okay
04:11 - well depending on where the mouse is
04:12 - that's how fast I want to play the movie
04:15 - so I can like slow it down or I can
04:17 - speed it up you can see there's some
04:18 - jumpiness it's not as perfectly smooth
04:20 - here but this I this is the kind of
04:22 - thing that you
04:23 - and do play it back a reverse I could
04:26 - mess with the pixels I could stop it I
04:28 - could pause it I could start it I could
04:29 - read anything you could do with other
04:31 - images you could do with the movie file
04:33 - - so I don't want to get let's just
04:37 - let's just look at jump just put in a
04:42 - mouse pressed here just to show that
04:43 - that works I'm going to say movie dot
04:46 - jump and at two three seconds wherever
04:49 - it is in three seconds
04:50 - let's call video I keep remembering that
04:52 - okay so this now it's playing back and
04:55 - whenever I click the mouse it should
04:57 - jump to that point three seconds into
05:00 - them to the file so you can see here a
05:03 - lot of you know some basic manipulation
05:06 - of a video file you can do in terms of
05:08 - stopping starting and jumping around but
05:09 - I just wanted to have a quick video that
05:11 - demonstrates some of these key features
05:12 - and you know as an exercise you might
05:14 - just go back say I made some stuff with
05:16 - static images I made some stuff with
05:18 - live capture let me see if I can slot in
05:22 - a movie and manipulate its pixels and do
05:24 - try one of these those other examples
05:25 - with a movie file as well okay that's
05:27 - the end of this video which was only
05:29 - five minutes and 30 seconds long
05:31 - excellent okay

Cleaned transcript:

okay so let's very briefly now just look at a few key differences between using a recorded file a file for a quartic movie from a file versus a live capture object from a live camera so um we saw that there that we could make a new capture object and we have to give a width and a height of frames per second we've used the keyword this all the same thing is true with a movie object actually done put another thing is the same thing is not true we do have to make eight use make a new movie object and we have to use the keyword this but we don't give a width and a height a frame rate what we need to do is reference a particular file so just like you could load an image from your data folder you can load a movie file from your data folder and then this is a p image so you can use the image function the tint function you can look at the pixels but we need a few more key pieces just like we had that capture event what we need a movie event where we're going to read images from the movie as the movies playing let's give us the current frame the current frame the current frame but I think a bit more important than that in terms of the difference here is that there are some functions like jump the jump function allows you to jump to a certain spot in the movie so if you want to whenever the user clicks the mouse go back to the beginning of the movie you can do that by saying jump zero and this is in seconds processing uses seconds to to mark what point in the movie is a floating point number so you could say if your key thing happens at you know 103 point seven seconds you can jump to that spot in the movie but the time function gives you the current moment in time where is the movie currently the duration function gives you the length of the movie in seconds which is a useful piece of information to know if you want to go to the middle you go to duration divided by two and there's also some functions like speed which will allow you to speed up the playback so if I put speed and I put the number two in here it's going to play back twice as fast you can actually use a negative number to make the movie play in Reverse but only certain codecs codec being the format
