00:00 - part three of the Hamilton lottery
00:02 - simulator here we go so if you were kept
00:05 - in suspense in the previous video I let
00:08 - it run and after fifteen thousand four
00:10 - hundred twenty times of playing the
00:11 - Hamilton lottery we finally won our two
00:14 - tickets at ten dollars each see you
00:16 - tonight at the show okay uh not really
00:22 - actually but okay but now what do I want
00:26 - to do this I wouldn't make this a bit
00:27 - more interesting the goal here is to
00:28 - kind of make a little project that's
00:30 - about probability using javascript and
00:33 - so what I want to do is I want to change
00:35 - something about this I want to make it
00:37 - so that this number here for example I
00:40 - could edit so how many tickets are
00:42 - available or I could edit how many
00:44 - people are entering the lottery maybe
00:46 - let's change how many people are
00:47 - entering the lottery because we know I
00:51 - know based on the website that there
00:53 - actually are ten pairs of tickets
00:55 - available so that's sort of like a fixed
00:57 - number but I don't actually know how
01:00 - many people are entering so I'll leave
01:01 - it up to the user to estimate that so
01:04 - one thing that I want to do I could make
01:05 - a text input field or I could add a
01:08 - slider here there's lots of ways I'm
01:10 - going to do it kind of a strange way
01:11 - which is I want to make this editable
01:13 - and I want to show you if you recall
01:16 - this number is actually this um this
01:20 - element if I click inspect you can see
01:24 - over here it's a span with an ID called
01:26 - total that's what's in the HTML page so
01:29 - if I want to have this number sort of
01:32 - exist as its own thing that I can
01:33 - manipulate and play with I also want to
01:36 - make it a span how do I get back to the
01:39 - console I also want to make it a span so
01:42 - I'm going to go back to my HTML file and
01:44 - I'm gonna go up here and I'm gonna say
01:47 - span ID equals I'm gonna call this
01:51 - entrance as in the total number of
01:54 - entrance and you know later I'll maybe
01:58 - do something fancy to have like commas
02:00 - appear automatically or something like
02:02 - that but right now I'm gonna leave that
02:04 - at 50,000 with no comma and I'm gonna go
02:07 - back and you can see that there it is
02:10 - fifty thousand one thing I want to do
02:13 - I want to add a little bit of styling so
02:18 - the way right here I mean this style tag
02:20 - and the head I could have put this in a
02:22 - separate CSS file I'm referring to the
02:24 - ID by entrance and I'm just gonna do
02:26 - something like say background color make
02:30 - it like a light gray just so we can see
02:32 - that that's a light gray and then maybe
02:34 - I'll also add like a little padding
02:36 - around it so you just see that it looks
02:38 - like something different now somebody is
02:39 - gonna be a somebody when I once I post
02:41 - this the github some nice designer will
02:43 - come along and redo my CSS and fix it up
02:46 - to make it nice but the whole point is I
02:48 - want to be able to edit that so to be
02:50 - able to edit that it's not this is
02:54 - actually not something I'm gonna do in
02:55 - the CSS Dom elements on a web page have
02:58 - things called attributes attributes are
03:01 - other ways of modifying the behavior of
03:03 - a particular Dom element not associated
03:06 - necessarily with just its sort of design
03:07 - its style its look and one attribute is
03:11 - called content editable so actually if I
03:15 - just write content editable here in the
03:18 - span it don't worry this is the
03:20 - equivalent of saying this content
03:22 - editable equals true but I can just put
03:25 - the word content editable in there which
03:27 - means it now has an attribute content
03:29 - editable
03:29 - and now you can see here this is
03:33 - actually editable so I can just change
03:36 - this to any number I want so I'm going
03:42 - to go back to 50,000 so the point of
03:45 - this is what I want to do is now if the
03:47 - user comes here and changes that number
03:49 - I want everything else to change to
03:51 - reflect it I want to have this say how
03:54 - many times you have to play to have a
03:55 - 99% chance I want this to say you have a
03:57 - 1 in what so in other words as soon as I
04:00 - change this to 40,000 this should say
04:02 - you have a 1 in 4,000 chance of winning
04:05 - so now we need to look at what are the
04:08 - Dom elements that need to be updated so
04:12 - this number 5,000 needs to change and
04:14 - that number 23,000 needs to change so I
04:17 - need to make those also spans that I can
04:19 - access so now I'm going to come down
04:22 - here and I'm going to say span
04:24 - ID equals chance and I'm going to come
04:32 - down here and say span ID equals nine
04:37 - I'll call this one 99 can I make an idea
04:40 - number I don't see why not
04:42 - and let's call it 99 percent the 99% of
04:49 - us who aren't going to see Hale too
04:51 - because they're very expensive I don't
04:52 - even know if you can get them okay so so
04:55 - now I have those elements as spans now I
04:58 - have a question how do I know when the
05:02 - user has changed the number 50,000 now
05:05 - one thing that I could do is draw is
05:09 - looping over and over again so there's
05:11 - this draw loop looping over and over
05:12 - again so I could always just say like
05:14 - always always check check the Dom
05:16 - element update the number check the
05:17 - Dhamma update number but that's not very
05:18 - efficient here in fact I actually turned
05:20 - off the draw loop unless the lottery is
05:22 - running so it isn't really looping all
05:24 - the time what I want to do here is I
05:26 - want to say only when the user changes a
05:30 - value in that field do the to the other
05:34 - numbers update so I need an event just
05:36 - like I have an event for when the user
05:38 - presses the button I could now have an
05:40 - event for whether the number in this
05:42 - content editable span changes and let's
05:44 - look at how I could do that so first
05:46 - thing is if I go back to the HTML file I
05:49 - need to remember that this thing that's
05:52 - that people are changing is called
05:53 - entrance so let me go back to the sketch
05:55 - and I'm gonna say entrance equal
06:01 - entrance and in setup I'm gonna say
06:03 - entrance equals select entrance okay and
06:08 - now I need to make an event entrance dot
06:11 - changed update probability so just like
06:18 - look at these two areas here's the
06:20 - button when the button is pressed call
06:23 - the start lottery function when the
06:25 - entrance have changed call the update
06:27 - probability probability so this means I
06:33 - need to write a function
06:37 - called update whoops I want to called
06:41 - update probability and let's zoom back
06:43 - out and scroll down a little bit so I
06:46 - need to write this function so what do I
06:48 - need to do the first thing I need to do
06:50 - is calculate what is a new probability I
06:54 - have a one in 5,000 chance because I
06:58 - have 50,000 entrance divided by 10 pairs
07:01 - of tickets so the new probability what 1
07:06 - in 5,000 is 50,000 divided by entrance
07:11 - dot html' so the HTML function in a Dom
07:16 - element allows you to set the contents
07:18 - of that Dom element but it also allows
07:20 - you to retrieve it so you know we can
07:23 - check this right this if I type entrance
07:26 - here we can see that's a p5 element can
07:29 - you see that let me give myself some
07:31 - more space here if I say entrance dot
07:34 - HTML you can see it has the number
07:36 - 50,000 in it if I change that to 40,000
07:40 - and say that again it has the number
07:42 - 40,000 in it so what I want is I want to
07:46 - when the probabilities updated change
07:49 - change that that number probability
07:51 - 50,000 divided by entrance and then I
07:54 - need to update what do I need to update
07:56 - I need to update this number the chance
08:00 - so here I want to say var chance equals
08:06 - Salette actually I'm just going to say
08:07 - select chance dot HTML prob so let's
08:14 - look at this now I'm updating I'm
08:16 - calculating that new probability and I'm
08:18 - updating that Dom element so let me go
08:20 - back and change this ooh what happened
08:27 - there what did I miss so I don't know
08:31 - what I missed let's so I don't see it
08:33 - working so I have to debug this somehow
08:34 - so first let me just call that function
08:40 - ok it worked one in 1.25 chance
08:44 - so something happen so first of all my
08:46 - event didn't work
08:47 - because we have clear that function does
08:49 - something but my event
08:50 - didn't work but also my the math in that
08:52 - function is wrong let me go back and try
08:54 - to fix that 50,000 oh I'm being so silly
08:58 - the entrance is the number 4 well you
09:01 - guys probably figure this out like a
09:02 - while ago entrance is the new number
09:04 - that's replacing 50,000 and we know
09:07 - there are 10 pairs of tickets so I want
09:09 - to divide that by 10 so let me save that
09:12 - I'm gonna refresh the page change this
09:15 - to 40,000 and now update so you can see
09:19 - that that works the updated probability
09:20 - is working but for some reason that
09:22 - event isn't firing let's go back to look
09:26 - at this
09:26 - select changed so let me try a different
09:29 - event I think I'm fortunate I'm a little
09:31 - bit afraid I've come into a p5 bug here
09:34 - Oh No yeah this is working now so I
09:41 - don't know why the change so there - ok
09:43 - so there are two different event
09:45 - functions associated with one a Dom
09:47 - elements content changes there's the
09:49 - changed function and there's the input
09:52 - function the changed function only
09:54 - changes when you've complete triggers
09:56 - when you've completed your action like
09:58 - you've pressed enter or tab to leave
10:01 - that Dom element the input event fires
10:04 - continuously any time you're changing
10:05 - your typing so I don't know why the
10:07 - changed one didn't work I'll look into
10:09 - that later but I kind of wanted the
10:10 - input one anyway so what I now have is
10:13 - that you can see that as I change this
10:16 - number one--the out if I change this
10:18 - number to 1000 I have a 1 in 100 chance
10:21 - of winning now how do I change this
10:24 - number that I want to also have change
10:26 - that number there so remember technical
10:29 - mishap weird edit but what I where I'm
10:31 - back is looking at now applying this
10:35 - formula which I covered in part 1 of how
10:38 - to actually compute the the prot the
10:40 - number of times you need to play to have
10:42 - a 99% chance of winning the lottery at
10:44 - least once with log base 10 of 1 percent
10:48 - divided by log base 10 of the chance of
10:52 - not winning the lottery one single time
10:54 - ok
10:55 - so if your if you want to remember that
10:57 - for I'm going to go back to the first
10:58 - video but for right now I just need to
11:00 - find the place where to put that formula
11:02 - in to change that number
11:04 - 23000 right there so if I go back to the
11:07 - code we can see here that this is if you
11:11 - recall I just did this a moment ago this
11:13 - is where I'm changing the probability
11:15 - number and the other number I want to
11:17 - now do is first of all so what's the
11:19 - chance I'm gonna make a variable called
11:21 - not winning what's the chance of me not
11:23 - winning a lottery just once right four
11:26 - hundred four thousand nine hundred
11:27 - ninety nine divided by five thousand
11:29 - well that number 5,000 is now something
11:31 - that's shifting so what I want to say is
11:34 - probability minus one divided by
11:37 - probability that's the chance of me not
11:40 - winning the lottery just once so now the
11:42 - number of times is log of 0.01 divided
11:48 - by log of that not winning probability
11:50 - and now what that's the number that I
11:54 - need to update right here that's the
11:58 - number 23,000 that I want to change so
12:01 - if I do that all I need to do is select
12:03 - and the ID for that span was 99 percent
12:08 - dot html' num and I think it's probably
12:11 - worth also using floor here because I'm
12:14 - going to get like a long decimal number
12:16 - so I'm gonna put floor here to take off
12:19 - that decimal and maybe also what I'll do
12:23 - is I'm going to put that approximately
12:24 - it's not really that approximate anymore
12:27 - but I'll keep that in there so the span
12:28 - always keeps the approximate symbol so
12:31 - if I do this you can see now 550
12:34 - thousand people are entering the lottery
12:35 - I have a one in five thousand chance of
12:37 - winning and I must play twenty three
12:39 - thousand times to have a 99% chance of
12:41 - winning the lottery at least once so
12:43 - let's change this to twenty thousand oh
12:46 - well that's the way that the approximate
12:49 - was already in there I don't know why I
12:50 - add that in in the code it was not part
12:52 - of the span in the first place so let me
12:54 - do that again
12:54 - I'm gonna change this to twenty thousand
12:57 - so you can see now I have a one in two
12:59 - thousand chance of winning and I have to
13:01 - play the lottery nine thousand two
13:02 - hundred eight times in order to have a
13:05 - 99% chance of winning at least once so
13:07 - this is what I'm calling kind of a
13:08 - dynamic essay I mean there's no essay
13:11 - here but as I change one value other
13:13 - things update I'm not going to go too
13:15 - much farther with this but I am
13:17 - up post this entire thing on github a
13:20 - link to it I would love for people to
13:21 - add to this and pour requests add design
13:24 - elements you know it might be more
13:25 - interesting if you could hover over this
13:26 - and like slide your mouse back and forth
13:28 - to change the number like almost as if
13:30 - it were a slider this is not my original
13:33 - idea there's lots of people creating
13:34 - work like this you know Brett Victor
13:36 - being one person to mention who's made a
13:38 - lot of these types of you know
13:40 - educational things online with lots of
13:43 - manipulable things so but let's just
13:47 - make sure one thing I want to look at is
13:49 - make sure the lottery is still working
13:50 - itself the other thing I should mention
13:52 - is look at this if I say 0 I get a 1 in
13:54 - zero chance of winning and then I get
13:56 - not a number if I start putting some
13:57 - letters that I get one and not a number
13:59 - so there probably it also would make
14:01 - sense to have some kind of error
14:02 - checking and also it'd be nice to format
14:05 - the numbers with commas you guys submit
14:06 - pull requests to the github repository
14:08 - that I'm going to post in a moment and
14:11 - we'll see okay so let's make the lottery
14:14 - now have 200 people winning each time so
14:20 - you have a one in twenty Chan I don't
14:21 - need the console anymore so to give us
14:23 - us some more room 200 people are
14:24 - entering the lottery each night that
14:26 - means we have a one in 200 chance of
14:27 - winning and you have to play about
14:29 - eighty nine times to have a 99% chance
14:31 - of winning at least once we want after
14:35 - 61 times we won after 49 times we won
14:40 - after 35 times so you can see this idea
14:42 - works and now I could change this to
14:45 - 2000 and we could run it again and it
14:47 - should take us longer to win you know I
14:50 - would expect that by the time we get to
14:51 - a thousand we're going to win three
14:54 - hundred seven done and now I'm gonna say
14:56 - let's just say 75,000 people are
14:59 - entering the Hamilton lottery to have a
15:01 - 99 percent chance of winning the lottery
15:02 - at least one time we're gonna have to
15:04 - play about thirty four thousand times so
15:06 - let's start winning and let's hope that
15:08 - we're lucky I didn't get it on the first
15:10 - try unfortunately because I don't think
15:12 - I'm going to see Hamilton this evening
15:13 - I'm gonna let this run I will leave you
15:15 - in suspense asking the kind in the in
15:19 - the description of the video in the
15:20 - comments I will let you know how long it
15:22 - took for me to actually win that lottery
15:23 - and look in the description for this
15:25 - video - the link to the github
15:27 - repository and the website where you
15:30 - add and contribute to this

Cleaned transcript:

part three of the Hamilton lottery simulator here we go so if you were kept in suspense in the previous video I let it run and after fifteen thousand four hundred twenty times of playing the Hamilton lottery we finally won our two tickets at ten dollars each see you tonight at the show okay uh not really actually but okay but now what do I want to do this I wouldn't make this a bit more interesting the goal here is to kind of make a little project that's about probability using javascript and so what I want to do is I want to change something about this I want to make it so that this number here for example I could edit so how many tickets are available or I could edit how many people are entering the lottery maybe let's change how many people are entering the lottery because we know I know based on the website that there actually are ten pairs of tickets available so that's sort of like a fixed number but I don't actually know how many people are entering so I'll leave it up to the user to estimate that so one thing that I want to do I could make a text input field or I could add a slider here there's lots of ways I'm going to do it kind of a strange way which is I want to make this editable and I want to show you if you recall this number is actually this um this element if I click inspect you can see over here it's a span with an ID called total that's what's in the HTML page so if I want to have this number sort of exist as its own thing that I can manipulate and play with I also want to make it a span how do I get back to the console I also want to make it a span so I'm going to go back to my HTML file and I'm gonna go up here and I'm gonna say span ID equals I'm gonna call this entrance as in the total number of entrance and you know later I'll maybe do something fancy to have like commas appear automatically or something like that but right now I'm gonna leave that at 50,000 with no comma and I'm gonna go back and you can see that there it is fifty thousand one thing I want to do I want to add a little bit of styling so the way right here I mean this style tag and the head I could have put this in a separate CSS file I'm referring to the ID by entrance and I'm just gonna do something like say background color make it like a light gray just so we can see that that's a light gray and then maybe I'll also add like a little padding around it so you just see that it looks like something different now somebody is gonna be a somebody when I once I post this the github some nice designer will come along and redo my CSS and fix it up to make it nice but the whole point is I want to be able to edit that so to be able to edit that it's not this is actually not something I'm gonna do in the CSS Dom elements on a web page have things called attributes attributes are other ways of modifying the behavior of a particular Dom element not associated necessarily with just its sort of design its style its look and one attribute is called content editable so actually if I just write content editable here in the span it don't worry this is the equivalent of saying this content editable equals true but I can just put the word content editable in there which means it now has an attribute content editable and now you can see here this is actually editable so I can just change this to any number I want so I'm going to go back to 50,000 so the point of this is what I want to do is now if the user comes here and changes that number I want everything else to change to reflect it I want to have this say how many times you have to play to have a 99% chance I want this to say you have a 1 in what so in other words as soon as I change this to 40,000 this should say you have a 1 in 4,000 chance of winning so now we need to look at what are the Dom elements that need to be updated so this number 5,000 needs to change and that number 23,000 needs to change so I need to make those also spans that I can access so now I'm going to come down here and I'm going to say span ID equals chance and I'm going to come down here and say span ID equals nine I'll call this one 99 can I make an idea number I don't see why not and let's call it 99 percent the 99% of us who aren't going to see Hale too because they're very expensive I don't even know if you can get them okay so so now I have those elements as spans now I have a question how do I know when the user has changed the number 50,000 now one thing that I could do is draw is looping over and over again so there's this draw loop looping over and over again so I could always just say like always always check check the Dom element update the number check the Dhamma update number but that's not very efficient here in fact I actually turned off the draw loop unless the lottery is running so it isn't really looping all the time what I want to do here is I want to say only when the user changes a value in that field do the to the other numbers update so I need an event just like I have an event for when the user presses the button I could now have an event for whether the number in this content editable span changes and let's look at how I could do that so first thing is if I go back to the HTML file I need to remember that this thing that's that people are changing is called entrance so let me go back to the sketch and I'm gonna say entrance equal entrance and in setup I'm gonna say entrance equals select entrance okay and now I need to make an event entrance dot changed update probability so just like look at these two areas here's the button when the button is pressed call the start lottery function when the entrance have changed call the update probability probability so this means I need to write a function called update whoops I want to called update probability and let's zoom back out and scroll down a little bit so I need to write this function so what do I need to do the first thing I need to do is calculate what is a new probability I have a one in 5,000 chance because I have 50,000 entrance divided by 10 pairs of tickets so the new probability what 1 in 5,000 is 50,000 divided by entrance dot html' so the HTML function in a Dom element allows you to set the contents of that Dom element but it also allows you to retrieve it so you know we can check this right this if I type entrance here we can see that's a p5 element can you see that let me give myself some more space here if I say entrance dot HTML you can see it has the number 50,000 in it if I change that to 40,000 and say that again it has the number 40,000 in it so what I want is I want to when the probabilities updated change change that that number probability 50,000 divided by entrance and then I need to update what do I need to update I need to update this number the chance so here I want to say var chance equals Salette actually I'm just going to say select chance dot HTML prob so let's look at this now I'm updating I'm calculating that new probability and I'm updating that Dom element so let me go back and change this ooh what happened there what did I miss so I don't know what I missed let's so I don't see it working so I have to debug this somehow so first let me just call that function ok it worked one in 1.25 chance so something happen so first of all my event didn't work because we have clear that function does something but my event didn't work but also my the math in that function is wrong let me go back and try to fix that 50,000 oh I'm being so silly the entrance is the number 4 well you guys probably figure this out like a while ago entrance is the new number that's replacing 50,000 and we know there are 10 pairs of tickets so I want to divide that by 10 so let me save that I'm gonna refresh the page change this to 40,000 and now update so you can see that that works the updated probability is working but for some reason that event isn't firing let's go back to look at this select changed so let me try a different event I think I'm fortunate I'm a little bit afraid I've come into a p5 bug here Oh No yeah this is working now so I don't know why the change so there ok so there are two different event functions associated with one a Dom elements content changes there's the changed function and there's the input function the changed function only changes when you've complete triggers when you've completed your action like you've pressed enter or tab to leave that Dom element the input event fires continuously any time you're changing your typing so I don't know why the changed one didn't work I'll look into that later but I kind of wanted the input one anyway so what I now have is that you can see that as I change this number onethe out if I change this number to 1000 I have a 1 in 100 chance of winning now how do I change this number that I want to also have change that number there so remember technical mishap weird edit but what I where I'm back is looking at now applying this formula which I covered in part 1 of how to actually compute the the prot the number of times you need to play to have a 99% chance of winning the lottery at least once with log base 10 of 1 percent divided by log base 10 of the chance of not winning the lottery one single time ok so if your if you want to remember that for I'm going to go back to the first video but for right now I just need to find the place where to put that formula in to change that number 23000 right there so if I go back to the code we can see here that this is if you recall I just did this a moment ago this is where I'm changing the probability number and the other number I want to now do is first of all so what's the chance I'm gonna make a variable called not winning what's the chance of me not winning a lottery just once right four hundred four thousand nine hundred ninety nine divided by five thousand well that number 5,000 is now something that's shifting so what I want to say is probability minus one divided by probability that's the chance of me not winning the lottery just once so now the number of times is log of 0.01 divided by log of that not winning probability and now what that's the number that I need to update right here that's the number 23,000 that I want to change so if I do that all I need to do is select and the ID for that span was 99 percent dot html' num and I think it's probably worth also using floor here because I'm going to get like a long decimal number so I'm gonna put floor here to take off that decimal and maybe also what I'll do is I'm going to put that approximately it's not really that approximate anymore but I'll keep that in there so the span always keeps the approximate symbol so if I do this you can see now 550 thousand people are entering the lottery I have a one in five thousand chance of winning and I must play twenty three thousand times to have a 99% chance of winning the lottery at least once so let's change this to twenty thousand oh well that's the way that the approximate was already in there I don't know why I add that in in the code it was not part of the span in the first place so let me do that again I'm gonna change this to twenty thousand so you can see now I have a one in two thousand chance of winning and I have to play the lottery nine thousand two hundred eight times in order to have a 99% chance of winning at least once so this is what I'm calling kind of a dynamic essay I mean there's no essay here but as I change one value other things update I'm not going to go too much farther with this but I am up post this entire thing on github a link to it I would love for people to add to this and pour requests add design elements you know it might be more interesting if you could hover over this and like slide your mouse back and forth to change the number like almost as if it were a slider this is not my original idea there's lots of people creating work like this you know Brett Victor being one person to mention who's made a lot of these types of you know educational things online with lots of manipulable things so but let's just make sure one thing I want to look at is make sure the lottery is still working itself the other thing I should mention is look at this if I say 0 I get a 1 in zero chance of winning and then I get not a number if I start putting some letters that I get one and not a number so there probably it also would make sense to have some kind of error checking and also it'd be nice to format the numbers with commas you guys submit pull requests to the github repository that I'm going to post in a moment and we'll see okay so let's make the lottery now have 200 people winning each time so you have a one in twenty Chan I don't need the console anymore so to give us us some more room 200 people are entering the lottery each night that means we have a one in 200 chance of winning and you have to play about eighty nine times to have a 99% chance of winning at least once we want after 61 times we won after 49 times we won after 35 times so you can see this idea works and now I could change this to 2000 and we could run it again and it should take us longer to win you know I would expect that by the time we get to a thousand we're going to win three hundred seven done and now I'm gonna say let's just say 75,000 people are entering the Hamilton lottery to have a 99 percent chance of winning the lottery at least one time we're gonna have to play about thirty four thousand times so let's start winning and let's hope that we're lucky I didn't get it on the first try unfortunately because I don't think I'm going to see Hamilton this evening I'm gonna let this run I will leave you in suspense asking the kind in the in the description of the video in the comments I will let you know how long it took for me to actually win that lottery and look in the description for this video the link to the github repository and the website where you add and contribute to this
