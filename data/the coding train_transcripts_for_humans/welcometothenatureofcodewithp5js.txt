00:01 - Hello and happy 2020!
00:03 - It is me, Dan, from
the Coding Train
00:05 - here to launch a new
learning playlist on YouTube
00:09 - called The Nature of Code.
00:13 - That's what it says right here.
00:14 - So this is not new
content at all.
00:16 - In fact, this playlist that
I'm about to embark upon
00:21 - is based on material
that I started
00:22 - working on probably in 2008 and
then published a book about,
00:26 - which you can find online
at natureofcode.com in 2012.
00:29 - The book here that you're
seeing was written then
00:33 - and has largely
not been updated.
00:34 - It uses processing, which is
a Java-based creative coding
00:38 - environment.
00:39 - And I am in the process
of rewriting the book
00:43 - to update things for 2020
as well as port a lot
00:47 - all of the text and examples
to JavaScript with p5.js.
00:51 - So it's my dream that by the
time you're watching this,
00:54 - this will look
totally different.
00:56 - But this is where it is right
now as I'm recording this.
00:59 - In terms of what's already
on the YouTube channel,
01:02 - these are all of the videos.
01:03 - Most of these were actually
recorded between five and eight
01:06 - years ago.
01:06 - The quality is a
little bit lower--
01:09 - not that my quality is the best
ever now but it's improved.
01:13 - And so you can go
back and watch these.
01:15 - But largely, what
I'm going to do
01:16 - is go through a
lot of these topics
01:18 - and redo these videos
with new ways of thinking
01:21 - and new ideas, and
also JavaScript.
01:24 - I should mention that
some of the stuff I did
01:26 - update more recently
like genetic algorithms,
01:28 - and neural networks,
and the physics library,
01:30 - and little bits and
pieces in here--
01:31 - so if you're following
through this playlist,
01:34 - there will be some
forward and backward in
01:36 - time of when things
have been recorded.
01:38 - But hopefully, it will all piece
together with a nice narrative.
01:42 - If you want to follow
the book being updated
01:45 - and the examples being
updated as it's happening,
01:47 - I'll refer you to the
Nature of Code on GitHub.
01:50 - So here are all
of the open source
01:52 - repositories for all of the
raw material of the book.
01:55 - So the book itself
is in NOC book two.
01:58 - There's the syllabus,
which is for a course
02:00 - that I'm teaching at ITP,
New York University, School
02:03 - of the Arts.
02:03 - There's the code
for the website.
02:05 - There's the processing examples.
02:07 - There's the p5.js examples.
02:08 - And there's even some
Python examples as well.
02:10 - And so all of this is stuff
that I'm going to be working on.
02:13 - And my goal is that sometime,
by the end of 2020, all of this
02:17 - will be complete.
02:18 - This video series that
is there in front of you
02:20 - will have be all filled
out and we can all just
02:23 - have a little dance and be
merry, go merrily on our way.
02:27 - And let me also give
a mention of Kadenze
02:30 - which I participated in
producing an online course
02:34 - called the Nature of
Code a bunch of years
02:36 - ago as well that
has a lot of video
02:38 - tutorials, a lot
of similar content.
02:40 - This is also a nice
resource, a complement
02:42 - to what I'm doing here as well.
02:44 - So I probably should
have mentioned
02:47 - what this is all about.
02:49 - So this book is about looking
at the world around us,
02:53 - the natural world,
being inspired by it
02:56 - and trying to create
software experiences,
02:58 - interactive experiences inspired
and based on those things.
03:02 - The first bit of advice I might
have for you-- and thinking
03:04 - of the words of George
Washington Carver,
03:06 - go take a walk outside.
03:07 - Experience the world around you.
03:08 - Be with people.
03:09 - Be with human beings.
03:12 - Enjoy nature.
03:12 - And that might help really
give you ideas and inspiration
03:15 - for what you might
want to create
03:17 - when you sit down to code.
03:18 - And that's really what
this book is about for me--
03:21 - fractals, cellular
automata, autonomous agents,
03:23 - physics simulation, genetic
algorithms, neural networks.
03:26 - This happens to be
a list of things
03:29 - that I'm going to go
through step by step by step
03:31 - throughout this series.
03:33 - But really, there's so
much more to the world
03:35 - that we live in than just
that, into outer space
03:38 - and beyond into the universe.
03:40 - So I hope that as you
watch this series,
03:42 - you think beyond just
what I have here.
03:44 - Create stuff and also
share it with me.
03:46 - So stay tuned.
03:47 - Look in this
video's description.
03:48 - There's lots of ways if you're
watching these videos that you
03:51 - can share projects you've made,
mostly on TheCodingTrain.com
03:54 - where I think I'm
going to put stuff.
03:57 - But just check the
video's description.
03:59 - All that will be ironed out.
04:00 - I've got to end this
because this is really
04:01 - just a rambling introduction.
04:02 - I want to get into the content.
04:04 - I'm going to come back
and redo this anyway
04:06 - once all the videos are done.
04:08 - So hopefully, now
you're watching this
04:10 - sometime in the future as
like an interesting historical
04:13 - footnote.
04:13 - But thanks.
04:15 - Come with me on this journey
into the nature of code
04:17 - and I hope you enjoy it.
04:20 - I'm going to enjoy making
it, I know because I
04:22 - do enjoy this kind of stuff.
04:23 - And I can't wait
to see what you do.
04:25 - Bye!
