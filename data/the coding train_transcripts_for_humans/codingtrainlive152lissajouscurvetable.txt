00:02 - [Music]
00:13 - hello and happy Friday it is Friday it
00:17 - is time for the coding train with me
00:20 - your host Daniel chief Mon mmm and I'm
00:27 - so excited to be here I did have a
00:29 - livestream last Friday and I had a guest
00:33 - evening she was here yuning she was here
00:36 - to demonstrate how to train a style
00:38 - transfer model using tensor flow or
00:41 - train that model model locally on your
00:43 - computer or in the cloud using a service
00:44 - called spell and use the ml 5 library to
00:47 - take that model and use it in the
00:49 - browser and to style your image from the
00:51 - webcam all that exciting stuff and if
00:53 - you missed it you can go back and watch
00:54 - it but coming this Monday edited
00:57 - versions of yuning's livestream will
00:58 - come out so if you're looking for just
01:00 - the kind of step-by-step instructions
01:02 - without all the unplugging and plugging
01:04 - in of wires and me interrupting her by
01:06 - accident
01:07 - stay tuned for that all right so I have
01:10 - so many things I feel like I want to
01:11 - announce and talk about but I'm just
01:14 - gonna put all that aside and guess what
01:16 - I am starting this instant with a coding
01:19 - challenge you know I just I just don't
01:21 - have it in me to go on and on about like
01:24 - the store and the patreon and all that
01:26 - sort of stuff I uh and I'm gonna use
01:28 - processing for this although I think
01:31 - what I'm gonna do sorry I'm looking for
01:32 - a marker am i over here I'm looking for
01:34 - my manie's processing for this and which
01:38 - is Java and then as soon as I'm done I
01:40 - am going to oh oh I know where my
01:44 - markers are I need some cleanup in this
01:45 - room now I have a whole thing of markers
01:49 - I got pink green and black and another
01:53 - black one and even like some new ones
01:55 - all right so uh how are you how's
02:00 - everybody doing today
02:01 - are you are you well are you happy it's
02:03 - Friday I don't know how that is in your
02:05 - life so nice Friday is like the start of
02:06 - difficult stuff sometimes it's the end
02:08 - of difficult stuff sometimes it's just
02:10 - another day for me I'm really looking
02:12 - forward to this weekend I might wait my
02:14 - life is working these days I have to
02:15 - wake up very very early and on Saturday
02:18 - I can sleep until like 7:30 in the
02:21 - morning if I want my children don't wake
02:23 - me up earlier they're not allowed to get
02:25 - out of bed if you're watching right now
02:26 - you must stay in bed until 8:00 a.m.
02:29 - then you can get out of bed and read and
02:31 - play Legos and all that stuff okay I am
02:34 - seeing a note over here that that the
02:41 - stream status YouTube is telling me is
02:43 - okay I want it to be good when I see the
02:47 - green good makes me happy all right so
02:50 - what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start by
02:51 - programming a Lisa Zhu Lisa IU leaves as
02:56 - you see sighs ooh
02:59 - Lisa Zhu table curved table I'm gonna
03:02 - open up processing here I'm going to
03:04 - check the font size to make sure that
03:08 - seems good look that's my little seat
03:11 - look at this coding new coding train
03:13 - characters see these little brackets
03:14 - over here now classes person thing and
03:22 - I'll come back I got a new store and new
03:25 - t-shirts and everything I'll come back
03:26 - to that later see if you can find it
03:29 - what's over here Oh style transfer okay
03:30 - so this looks good font size wise and
03:37 - let me just save this I want to
03:41 - reference stand-up maths stand-up maths
03:48 - YouTube this particular video videos no
03:57 - this is the wrong channel this is Matt
03:58 - Parker's other channel Lisa Zhu who I'm
04:04 - signed in as here can I sign it as
04:06 - myself all right this is my weird fake
04:09 - you can't I just leave it there that's
04:10 - fine yes
04:13 - all right so reference this video thank
04:16 - you very much
04:17 - then let's go find the links here to
04:21 - this tweet and this tweet and then we
04:26 - can also maybe look at why is my
04:30 - brightness so down on this computer okay
04:32 - we can look at and it's so tiny we can
04:35 - look at Wikipedia is good okay all right
04:42 - we're ready for this did I say I was
04:45 - just jumping right in hasn't even been
04:47 - five minutes of live-streaming and I'm
04:48 - about to start coding and one turning a
04:50 - new leaf a new page in the book of
04:53 - random numbers well it's been a while
04:57 - though twenty two thousand three hundred
05:07 - and fifty eighty four thousand seven
05:10 - hundred and thirty-five seventy-one
05:12 - thousand six hundred fifty twenty seven
05:14 - thousand six hundred thirty six thousand
05:17 - seven hundred twenty six thirty nine
05:20 - thousand nine hundred and seventy nine
05:21 - sixty eight thousand five hundred and
05:24 - twenty three seventy nine thousand five
05:26 - hundred twenty-one forty-seven thousand
05:29 - four hundred and thirty-eight five
05:35 - thousand three hundred sixty-five ninety
05:38 - one thousand seven hundred sixty-five
05:40 - twenty eight thousand three hundred
05:42 - ninety fifty seven thousand three
05:43 - hundred sixty-three and sixty nine
05:45 - thousand 137 hey six ninety thousand six
05:49 - hundred and eight eighty seven thousand
05:51 - four hundred and thirty six fifty
05:53 - thousand two hundred and ninety nine I
05:56 - lost my place okay and let's check
06:04 - everybody everything's working what
06:07 - brand of markers okay oh the slowmode is
06:10 - not on slow mode is off today is just a
06:13 - crazy day no rules and I will be turning
06:16 - slow mode on immediately in five four
06:20 - three
06:21 - we'll see if I need to turn it on
06:23 - somebody please let me know doo doo
06:26 - moderators do appointed moderators have
06:28 - the ability to turn it on themselves
06:32 - that's the question that I do not know
06:34 - the answer to do okay this I don't need
06:42 - is this enough space can I move can i
06:45 - cheap this a little bit over this way
06:46 - and yes and also let's check console
06:51 - prints hello here that's viewable okay I
07:02 - think we're good I think I'm ready I
07:04 - think I can do moderators cannot alright
07:09 - alright you you're only a you're just
07:12 - it's very sad how you required me to do
07:15 - this Internet don't worry I'm here to
07:19 - help I'm here to save the day info and
07:21 - settings live control room ingestion
07:29 - settings actually I'm kind of lost here
07:32 - once I already once I've already started
07:35 - can I adjust tiles higher Stan's managed
07:39 - miners participants advanced settings
07:44 - there we go slow mode enabled now 10
07:51 - seconds 10 seconds of doing the 10
07:53 - second thing I will raise it if I have
07:55 - to I will have to don't make me pull
07:56 - this car over I don't I'm not driving a
08:00 - car kids okay hmm all right no
08:12 - [Music]
08:20 - Jules Antoine Lisa Jew in 1857 all right
08:26 - family of curves French physicist okay
08:30 - okay so quickly French yeah so this dot
08:34 - t shirts are available see if you could
08:36 - find them the Vista T's are now
08:38 - available
08:38 - I just haven't finished everything and
08:40 - there's some other styles and colors and
08:42 - things I'm having a few bugs with the
08:44 - store but they are available thank you
08:47 - to uh natter League Gaming that is nice
08:49 - to hear French French people Bolger Oh
08:56 - como sure Paul knows that's not how you
09:00 - say pronounced jewels on Tuan Lisa Lisa
09:05 - jus just Lisa jus right okay somebody
09:12 - will tell me in about twenty seconds
09:13 - because that's how long it takes I need
09:16 - I have tissues I need to blow my nose
09:19 - what other weird music do I have oh this
09:22 - is that's scary
09:35 - [Music]
09:50 - [Music]
09:52 - Cody train it's sponsored by water
09:55 - thanks everybody stay hydrated the
10:08 - presentation right there in the article
10:11 - where oh hold on
10:18 - [Music]
10:20 - No won't speak it for me where is it
10:25 - [Music]
10:29 - you say it right all right good enough
10:35 - [Music]
10:41 - hello welcome to a coding challenge in
10:44 - this coding challenge I am going to
10:46 - attempt to make I'm gonna do I'm gonna
10:54 - do sorry I was thinking about something
11:01 - it's fine I might do you know what I
11:09 - would like to I think it's gonna be
11:10 - interesting looking enough that I would
11:13 - like to have it at the beginning of the
11:14 - video I can't tell whether it's better
11:15 - to actually have it at the beginning of
11:17 - the video or not so I'm gonna start as
11:19 - if I've already introduced the concept
11:21 - oh and I'm not recording this to disk
11:22 - boy I hope things don't crash I was
11:24 - having some crashing issues the other
11:26 - day ok and I'm seeing a weird glitchy
11:30 - thing here better better ok ok the music
11:36 - is still playing I think it stopped by
11:44 - now you shouldn't be hearing any music
11:48 - alright is anybody still hearing music
11:52 - that's weird if you are cuz I'm not
12:01 - little check here
12:02 - it stopped okay great I want anybody do
12:07 - this in half an hour
12:08 - unlikely very unlikely okay
12:13 - welcome to the Lisa Chiu coding
12:15 - challenge now I want to talk about where
12:17 - this idea came from this is not a new
12:19 - idea this is like a 19th century idea
12:21 - but I I was reminded of it by this
12:23 - wonderful video from stand-up maths
12:25 - YouTube channel Matt Parker actually
12:27 - created a mechanical version of this
12:30 - particular pattern and Matt Parker's
12:33 - video referenced these two wonderful
12:36 - gifts one from Giulio Lara on Twitter
12:40 - and then this one here from Vincent pant
12:43 - to Loney
12:43 - and these are really like satisfying fun
12:46 - patterns you could see like what's going
12:49 - on here there's a circle there's a dot
12:50 - moving around it the dots moving around
12:53 - the circles are at different speeds and
12:54 - it's tracing a path and look what's
12:56 - going on so how do you program this
12:58 - thing this is exactly what I'm going to
13:00 - do and I'm going to do it in processing
13:05 - now processing is a Java based
13:06 - programming environment for sketching
13:08 - and creating graphics you can do a lot
13:10 - more with it - more information about
13:12 - processing in the video's description
13:13 - and then I will also be making a
13:16 - JavaScript version of this that you can
13:17 - refer to actually I might just do that
13:19 - in a whole separate video so anyway okay
13:21 - so let's get started so the first thing
13:22 - I want to do is I'm going to make a nice
13:25 - window 800 by 800 and I'm going to give
13:28 - it a black background now I need to
13:31 - think thinking is what you do let's do
13:33 - some planning so I'm gonna come over
13:35 - here oh and I have no idea if this
13:37 - markers of reason reasonable but
13:39 - basically what's going on so the idea is
13:41 - that we have a table
13:52 - oh and look at this glare can I fix that
13:56 - in any way yeah a little bit the idea
14:02 - that we have a table maybe there are a
14:05 - number of columns let's just say there
14:07 - are four and maybe there are a number of
14:09 - rows 1 2 3 4 now actually what's going
14:14 - on here is the mathematical principles
14:17 - behind this these Lisa Zhu curves really
14:19 - have nothing to do with well that's a
14:20 - bit man no editing okay
14:35 - let's make a rule except for like
14:38 - extreme debugging I cannot stop and
14:42 - start anymore okay no more stopping and
14:45 - starting no more stopping and starting
14:48 - never plan it okay all right so okay the
14:59 - idea is that we have a table so if we
15:01 - look at that we can see there's a bunch
15:03 - of columns let's just start with four
15:04 - although I have I'm envisioning this
15:06 - giant Lisa do table that we're gonna
15:07 - make at the end four columns and four
15:10 - rows and each one of these is going to
15:12 - show an oscillating pattern so some
15:14 - things you're going to want to know
15:15 - about are the sine function the sine
15:18 - function is a trigonometric or metric
15:20 - function which oscillates a number
15:23 - between negative 1 and 1
15:24 - I mean it's and the sine of a particular
15:27 - angle and a right triangle is the ratio
15:28 - of the opposite angle over the
15:31 - hypotenuse the length of those two
15:33 - things so this is an important concept
15:36 - and you're also going to want to know
15:39 - about polar coordinates and the idea
15:44 - also of Cartesian coordinates these are
15:47 - things that I use in almost all of my
15:48 - videos just learning to program in
15:50 - processing is an exercise in kind of
15:52 - understanding Cartesian coordinate
15:54 - systems because that's what you're
15:55 - drawing into but a polar coordinate
15:58 - system is a way of saying ok I want to
16:03 - if I have if I have a radius
16:06 - of a circle and an angle how can I
16:09 - describe a point outside the circle so
16:11 - in other words if I could figure out
16:14 - what the radius of each one of these
16:15 - circles are and then have this point
16:18 - travel around it circularly and this
16:21 - would go at one x speed this would go at
16:23 - 2x speed this would go at 3x speed this
16:25 - would go at 4x speed integer whole
16:27 - numbers of course you'd experiment with
16:29 - other stuff too and then I do the same
16:31 - exact thing over here 2 X 3 X 4 X and
16:35 - then here I need to get an x coordinate
16:38 - why don't I get the x coordinate from
16:40 - wherever this happens to be so the x
16:42 - coordinate is oscillating back and forth
16:43 - well I'm gonna get the y coordinate from
16:45 - where this happens to be moving around
16:47 - the circle so it's oscillating up and
16:48 - down it's really just the result it's
16:50 - hard simple harmonic motion don't have a
16:52 - video about that I'm just doing simple
16:54 - harmonic motion on two axes if they're
16:56 - moving at the same speed I will get a
16:58 - nice curve like this if one of them is
17:00 - moving faster than the other I might get
17:02 - something like this not exactly and so
17:04 - on and so forth so this is what we have
17:05 - to build alright so let's start with
17:07 - just making one row of these things
17:11 - alright how am I gonna make a row of
17:13 - these things first let me come up let me
17:15 - start with a single variable called
17:17 - angle because that's the variable what
17:20 - I'm doing I'm a single variable called
17:21 - angle I'm gonna start that at zero then
17:23 - I'm going to I just need to figure out a
17:25 - little bit about the space that I'm in
17:27 - and so I want to think one thing that I
17:29 - want to think about is what is the size
17:32 - of each one of these boxes and let's
17:34 - make that like 10 pixels or 20 pixels
17:36 - and what's going on here we have an 800
17:39 - by 800 window so let's actually make
17:41 - that 800 pixels so I'm gonna call that W
17:44 - and have that be 80 so it's going to be
17:47 - 10 by 10 and what I want to do now in
17:50 - background and in draw is just say 4 oh
17:53 - and then I need to know how many columns
17:55 - so the number of columns is the width
17:57 - divided by that that size of each box so
18:02 - if I loop in draw start at 0 go go all
18:09 - the way up to columns I plus plus and
18:11 - then I just draw an ellipse at some X
18:15 - and some Y with some
18:19 - let's just use 80 right now some
18:20 - diameter and the X is what I times W and
18:26 - the Y that's just the Y is just zero
18:29 - right now what do I have so I have those
18:31 - circles up there and I want them down
18:33 - shifted over a little bit so the X the Y
18:36 - is really W divided by two and I should
18:38 - be saying no stroke and I should know
18:41 - not no stroke
18:41 - I want the outline so I say stroke 255
18:45 - and no fill cuz I just want the outline
18:48 - okay great so that's good and I move
18:54 - these things over a little bit so let's
18:56 - also have the X equal to plus W divided
19:00 - by two great because the reference point
19:02 - is this Center that's perfect but the
19:04 - truth of the matter is the corner I'm
19:06 - looking over here that corner up there
19:08 - when I'm creating this table the corner
19:10 - is kind of an empty space so I actually
19:12 - want to start the first one over here
19:14 - and I actually want to have nine instead
19:16 - of ten so the number of columns is
19:18 - actually width divided by W minus one
19:22 - and then the X starts at W Plus this is
19:27 - a little goofy but that's good so that's
19:28 - my top row and you know I don't really
19:30 - like this I want to make the I'm gonna
19:33 - call this like diameter D for diameter
19:35 - of these circles and I'm gonna have that
19:37 - B with no no W minus like 10 just so
19:42 - there's a little daylight a little space
19:44 - in between these things
19:45 - look how like big silly it is can I make
19:48 - that look nicer okay anyway sorry now
19:53 - that's fine so let's start this from now
19:55 - how do I get that point so if I have
19:58 - this angle for each one of these and you
20:00 - know what this is really like Center X
20:02 - circle X circle I Center X centralize
20:04 - the center of each one of those circles
20:06 - now what I need is an offset and an
20:09 - offset is where I can suddenly like I
20:12 - wanna figure out where is this point
20:13 - based on the angle this angle is
20:15 - increasing where is this point along the
20:17 - circle and this is this idea of polar
20:19 - coordinates to Cartesian coordinates so
20:21 - if I know the radius of the circle and I
20:23 - know this angle I can use a formula
20:25 - which says x equals R times cosine of
20:28 - the angle y equals R times sine of the
20:30 - angle
20:31 - down X equals R times cosine of the
20:34 - angle theta being a Greek letter that's
20:36 - often used to signify an angle y equals
20:38 - R times the sine of the angle where do
20:41 - these come from the reference to some
20:42 - other video where I go through this in
20:44 - more detail but right now we just want
20:46 - to add that to here so I'm gonna say x
20:48 - equals R times cosine of the angle and y
20:54 - equals R times sine of the angle and
20:56 - what's our R equals D divided by two
20:59 - that's kind of useful and then I'm gonna
21:03 - say draw I'm gonna say stroke stroke
21:07 - stays the same I'm gonna make the stroke
21:09 - weight stroke weight eight so I'm gonna
21:14 - just draw like a thicker point by just
21:16 - using point point Center X Center X plus
21:21 - the X offset Center y plus the y offset
21:24 - mm-hmm and I'm gonna need to say I'm up
21:27 - here I'm gonna need to say this is I'm
21:29 - gonna have to say here stroke weight one
21:33 - so the old circles get a stroke weight
21:35 - of 1 and the points ah there we go look
21:37 - at that you know technically speaking I
21:41 - mean this is fine I could start here but
21:42 - that the point I think if you look at
21:44 - those other Lisa do table images the
21:45 - point starts at the top so I think I can
21:49 - just do like a little offset here and
21:51 - again I should probably be more
21:54 - thoughtful about variable naming and
21:56 - function but I'll refactor this later
21:58 - teacher coming soon for real okay
22:02 - so look at that that's perfect now let's
22:04 - just say angle plus equals 0.01 there we
22:11 - go look all the dots are moving around
22:13 - the circle now perfect the dots are
22:15 - moving around the circle let's even do
22:17 - something really fun here which is like
22:19 - stroke 255 let's give it a little alpha
22:21 - and let's draw a line from see X plus x
22:25 - 0 CX plus X height so now we can see oh
22:31 - wait wait wait stroke wait stroke wait 1
22:34 - and now we can see there we go so now
22:37 - you can also stroke 255 I'm gonna need
22:41 - to reset the colors everywhere
22:44 - okay there we go so you can see now
22:46 - those I can see those lines which are
22:48 - gonna help us as a visual guide as I
22:50 - start to create those curves curb curves
22:53 - yes I have a very deep voice no curves
22:57 - okay now did I really just do that is
23:02 - that edited out it's not edited out it's
23:03 - probably in the video they were watching
23:04 - right now ah what's the big thing here
23:06 - the big thing is remember is the speed
23:09 - of these needs to increase this one's
23:12 - going to go around two times the fest
23:13 - three times it's minus four times as
23:14 - fast so coming over here I want to say
23:19 - oh this is easy angle I have I have a
23:22 - counter eye so I'm gonna say angle times
23:24 - I plus one because I don't want to
23:27 - multiply it by 0 the 0 1 gets multiplied
23:30 - by 1 etc etc so now we can see there we
23:33 - go oh this is already fun they already
23:35 - like this just like this ok so that's
23:40 - good now oh this really needs
23:43 - refactoring because this I could really
23:46 - think about is like a function and then
23:48 - I could just do that same function
23:49 - vertically but I'm but I am Who I am I
23:53 - will be who I will be i will refactor
23:56 - this later
23:58 - for real and you will also refactor it
24:01 - yourself as an exercise to improve your
24:04 - programming skills and we just change
24:05 - this to Rose this is going to be the Y
24:08 - this is going to be the X and then this
24:13 - is all the same this is all the same
24:16 - except the line now goes from 0 to C y
24:20 - plus y and with to c c y plus y right
24:27 - what I do wrong all right did I not even
24:29 - calculate the Rose so I need a variable
24:32 - that is the number of rows and rows
24:35 - equals height divided by W minus 1 and
24:39 - now there we go
24:41 - so we can see I already I've built the
24:43 - table I could stop right here and I
24:44 - could say I'm done please finish this
24:47 - I'm going to keep going because this is
24:48 - gonna be fun and exciting all right so
24:50 - now what do I do
24:52 - how do i how do I get the curves in here
24:56 - well I see in the chat
24:58 - actually I this screams Oh Opie can
25:00 - someone explain to me with doing me -
25:01 - Opie
25:02 - alright what is Opie object-oriented
25:05 - programming so yes I probably should
25:07 - have done this I could refactor this to
25:09 - be object-oriented even this idea of the
25:11 - columns and rows and the objects that
25:13 - are there but what I'm gonna do is I'm
25:16 - gonna make a new tab in processing curve
25:19 - and I'm gonna create a curve class so
25:21 - the curve class is an object and the
25:24 - idea for that object is to store the
25:26 - curve that's gonna go in each one of
25:28 - these spots so what does it need to
25:30 - store that curb I need to store a path
25:33 - so where am i a curve I need to say what
25:38 - do I need I need an ArrayList an
25:40 - ArrayList there's a flexibly size array
25:42 - if I do this in JavaScript I could just
25:43 - make a plain array and I'm gonna fill it
25:45 - with P vectors I'm gonna call that path
25:48 - and then I'm gonna write the constructor
25:51 - and the path is a new ArrayList empty
25:58 - ArrayList so I'm gonna just put points
26:00 - in this path point in the path point in
26:02 - the path point in the path right so I
26:04 - could write like a function that's just
26:05 - like add point and it gets and an X and
26:12 - a Y and then I maybe do something like
26:17 - say path dot add new P vector with that
26:25 - X&Y
26:26 - right and then and this would be void
26:30 - and then I'm gonna also write a function
26:33 - to draw it show and I can say stroke 255
26:42 - and you should be clever and thoughtful
26:44 - about color and fill and all sorts of
26:46 - pretty different ways of doing this
26:48 - stroke weight one and then I'm going to
26:52 - say for every and this is a nice way of
26:54 - doing an enhanced loop in Java vector in
26:57 - the path set a vertex V dot X V dot Y
27:03 - this is this little bit of code right
27:05 - here is no longer relevant and when I
27:07 - saying begin shape and shape
27:11 - and no fill so this should give me this
27:14 - is actually me drawing the path as a
27:16 - shape using all of the vertices okay
27:20 - Oh somebody's telling me that the
27:22 - vertical lines are not visible and I'm
27:25 - not in the slack channel here okay
27:27 - the vertical lines are not - okay - two
27:30 - quick fixes I'll make Alka is telling me
27:32 - that half pi is a global constant in
27:35 - processing so if I want it to be I could
27:38 - use that time saying PI divided by two
27:39 - and you cannot see the lines well that's
27:43 - so sad the lines are like my favorite
27:45 - part
27:46 - let's do 150 just make them much more
27:49 - obvious okay that makes them much more
27:52 - obvious hopefully it looks reasonable in
27:55 - the sort of YouTube compression stuff
27:56 - but we'll see we'll see okay so I'm
27:59 - going back to the curve and I just that
28:01 - the debugger biaxin all right so let me
28:04 - format the code so this should draw me
28:06 - the path and then Oh tricky so now at
28:10 - all where do I want to store all these
28:11 - curves well one of the reasons why I
28:13 - wanted to use processing for this is I
28:15 - just feel so comfortable whenever I have
28:17 - a grid like structure like this using a
28:20 - two dimensional array and to mention
28:22 - where right is it really two dimensional
28:24 - it's just a list of lists but we can
28:26 - think of it as a two dimensional matrix
28:28 - see my other videos about
28:29 - two-dimensional arrays it's kind of
28:30 - tricky to make those things in Java
28:32 - though absolutely possible JavaScript
28:34 - that is but in Java it's it's not so
28:36 - tough so what I can actually do is I can
28:39 - declare I'm going to call it curves and
28:42 - I can now just say curves equals a new
28:47 - two-dimensional array with columns by
28:52 - rows now I have always always always
28:56 - always whoops I have to zoom in on this
29:00 - because I got really something to say
29:02 - here it's fast forward like two or three
29:04 - minutes in this video I have always
29:07 - programmed like this because Cartesian
29:09 - coordinates are expressed as XY so I
29:13 - always think if I'm making a
29:14 - two-dimensional array the X's will come
29:16 - first the Y's will come second but I've
29:17 - been doing so much stuff with matrices
29:19 - recently and
29:20 - mathematically matrices are expressed as
29:23 - row by columns that is the standard and
29:26 - this is probably gonna cause me to make
29:28 - all sorts of mistakes and bugs but right
29:30 - now do it
29:33 - Rose I'm gonna consider the first
29:35 - dimension here Rose and the second
29:37 - dimension here columns so everybody try
29:39 - to help me remember this you know sit
29:41 - there and like meditate on this and like
29:43 - send me your brainwaves that's what I'm
29:45 - gonna do so now once I've made it I can
29:48 - just say into I equals zero eyes listen
29:51 - Rose I plus plus shouldn't the eye the
29:54 - eye should be the chyme is so confused
29:56 - the I should still be the columns the J
29:59 - should still be the Rose I mean I should
30:02 - iterate over the J first who knows who
30:05 - knows know what how will I live curves
30:10 - index J index I equals a new curve so
30:16 - there we go
30:16 - I made an object for every single one of
30:19 - those spots and now here's the thing oh
30:22 - I did something so weird here because I
30:25 - made I mean the thing is if it's a
30:28 - square columns and rows are gonna be the
30:29 - same size but I kind of want to this to
30:31 - work for non square images so I really
30:35 - do want to refactor this and put these
30:37 - two blocks of code together in one loop
30:39 - I'm not going to though here's what I'll
30:42 - do I'm willing to if I change this
30:44 - function to like void add X so I make
30:52 - two of them like a separate one for add
30:54 - Y and then when I'm after I add the X
31:00 - and the y I can add the point with both
31:02 - of those so I need to store I'm gonna
31:06 - say P vector current so if I keep a
31:08 - separate variable current equals create
31:11 - vector create vector it doesn't matter
31:15 - what's in it just zero zero or nothing
31:17 - an empty vector then what I could do not
31:20 - create vector in processing it's a new P
31:21 - vector in P five in JavaScript it's
31:23 - create vector so if I do that then I can
31:26 - say current dot X this is really kind of
31:30 - awful I can set the X maybe this is more
31:33 - like set
31:35 - x-set why then I can say current dot why
31:41 - and I'm sure all of you were thinking of
31:44 - other ways of doing this which is
31:45 - excellent and I encourage you to try
31:47 - write about that in the comments so if I
31:49 - set both of these then adding the point
31:52 - can just be add like I could do that at
31:55 - the end and I could say add current and
31:57 - then I could say current equals a new I
32:00 - could just make another empty new P
32:02 - vector so I could do that over and over
32:03 - again let's think about this in other
32:05 - words now for every column hold on I
32:11 - know I need to turn the camera back on
32:13 - just so this is a little edit point and
32:16 - I'm just gonna do this camera line here
32:28 - for every oh and what I lost where I was
32:32 - here okay what I want to do is basically
32:35 - for this column I need to set what the X
32:39 - point for all of these for this row I
32:42 - need to set the Y point for all of these
32:44 - so I need another loop inside of each of
32:48 - these like at the end here I'm gonna say
32:50 - for int and this was I so J equals 0 J
32:54 - is less than rows J plus plus and then
32:58 - I'm gonna say curves index J index I set
33:03 - X to this point
33:05 - CX plus X then if I do the same exact
33:11 - thing here but for the columns so this
33:16 - should be I this should be I this should
33:19 - becomes this should be I exercise in
33:23 - like weird copy pasting this should be
33:25 - why this should be why I'm already lost
33:28 - whether I'm doing this correctly
36:01 - okay my back now sound wise you know the
36:06 - the batteries weren't charged when I
36:09 - arrived in this room I am back now how
36:14 - when did that happen that's the question
36:17 - I like that this is working I got a
36:19 - backup so everybody it's okay all right
36:27 - the question is when did that happen
36:29 - what was the last thing I said you
36:34 - change set X to set Y well that was a
36:37 - while ago wow that was a really long
36:39 - time okay
36:42 - let me do let me just do some triage
36:48 - here and let me just processing is not
36:56 - super great about undo but I'm gonna
36:58 - save where I am just in a different file
37:01 - let's see here
37:04 - Thank You Alka for noting where I
37:07 - stopped wait I was in the curve class I
37:18 - was in the curve class onset why
37:27 - not in the main program because that's a
37:30 - way back so sags this was actually going
37:40 - well and I got to get to the mastodon
37:43 - stuff I'm waiting for someone to confirm
37:48 - so we're saying I'm setting the curves
37:50 - xvalue I need to wait Oh in a for loop
37:59 - so it was later I was in the main
38:01 - excellent good so it wasn't that far
38:02 - back too bad it's too late now
38:08 - my redo doesn't seem to be uh but
38:11 - luckily I did this cuz I was okay so
38:36 - TMC I could to a voiceover no changing I
38:42 - and J TMC you gave me a screenshot me at
38:46 - the whiteboard that seems like way
38:47 - before when the sound went out so I
38:52 - believed that I was doing this I believe
39:04 - that I was here this is where I think
39:12 - that I was
39:24 - yeah your tips it is a good point
39:26 - because I could just do both of them so
39:30 - that might not be such a bad idea and
39:32 - then Matt you can edit it together I'm
39:35 - gonna do something here just in case
39:39 - okay
39:41 - did youdid set set wine set X so by the
39:49 - way if you ever just say something like
39:51 - in this flash challenge you say
39:52 - something like yup I have no idea what
39:56 - that's referring to cuz you're like 30
39:57 - seconds later so you've got to be very
39:59 - specific saying yes I agree you should
40:01 - blah blah blah blah blah okay all right
40:08 - I am going to do yes oh but I didn't
40:16 - change both of them probably but that'll
40:19 - be a little continuity error that nobody
40:20 - noticed okay all right
40:32 - I've got an image here oh that's exactly
40:35 - where I cut out I was changing the I to
40:38 - a J I'm gonna I'm gonna let much you
40:44 - figure out the best way to add it
40:45 - together and I'm gonna go by I'm gonna
40:46 - do TMC's original suggestion even though
40:49 - I was like no no no no no and I'm gonna
40:51 - go back to I'm gonna go back to yeah I'm
40:59 - gonna go back to where I'm starting to
41:01 - add and this wasn't there yet right this
41:06 - would not have been there yet yeah yeah
41:13 - okay okay all right here we go
41:21 - I'm gonna pretend I remember what I was
41:24 - saying at the whiteboard let me check I
41:26 - switched the batteries and that mic I'm
41:32 - just gonna pray okay okay No finally
41:39 - finally I had some livestream going well
41:41 - I got it like I got 20 minutes to finish
41:46 - this up all right
41:48 - so something about how I need to do blah
41:51 - blah blah blah blah blah blah so if I
41:56 - come to the first loop where I'm going
41:59 - through all the columns all I need to do
42:01 - is at the end then add another loop for
42:10 - wait time out I'm now I'm concerned hold
42:17 - on I I saved I need to go back and look
42:20 - at one did I already is the curve did I
42:23 - add like she was show and add point
42:27 - already there I think it was right like
42:30 - I didn't make changes there so I'm going
42:33 - the desktop I have the video recorded
42:35 - over here so I can actually just open it
42:37 - up and watch it
42:40 - sorry you can't see what I'm seeing now
42:49 - so where is the code and the other
42:56 - before the whiteboard I have add points
43:04 - yeah I have all that show an ad were
43:08 - there okay great I can confirm that they
43:11 - were all right thank you everybody thank
43:13 - you for your patience you're very kind
43:16 - to watch these live streams where
43:18 - everything goes wrong at least the
43:24 - system hasn't crashed that's usually my
43:26 - problem okay okay so in this loop here
43:36 - where I'm going through all the columns
43:38 - now I just need to go through all of the
43:40 - rows for each column and set those
43:42 - exports so I is going through the
43:44 - columns so now J will go through the
43:50 - rows and I'm gonna say I forgot what I'm
43:55 - doing curves curves cannot type curves J
43:59 - I dot set X and then what am i doing I'm
44:03 - setting it to exactly this point so I go
44:06 - through all of the rows and set the X
44:11 - point for each column okay then I'm
44:13 - gonna do exactly the same thing here
44:16 - down here but this time I'm going to go
44:20 - through the columns because I'm going
44:24 - through the rows so for each row I go
44:25 - through the each column and this stays
44:28 - the same but now it's Y and I want to
44:30 - set the Y point ah we've got a problem
44:32 - so I used I here but I should use J now
44:38 - so I should be consistent try to always
44:40 - use J with rows and I with columns which
44:43 - means these have to change and this has
44:46 - to change
44:47 - okay great okay no errors and now guess
44:51 - what I'm kind of done I think because
44:54 - basically all that I need to do
44:56 - is call add point and show like once
44:59 - I've set the X and the y add to the path
45:01 - then draw the path so I need a nested
45:04 - loop do I have that somewhere somewhere
45:06 - I have a nested loop yes right up here
45:08 - already let's just actually look at this
45:10 - graph ah no come back to me I'm going to
45:13 - copy this because I don't feel like
45:15 - typing it and go all the way to the end
45:17 - and now instead of this is before I made
45:20 - new curves now I'm just gonna say add
45:22 - point and and what else show oh my
45:30 - goodness
45:30 - could this be it look at that ah there
45:35 - we go look it's the Lisa 2 table so
45:38 - we're what kind of done
45:39 - coding challenge finished why is there
45:41 - like 15 more minutes in this video
45:42 - because like I don't to do a couple more
45:44 - things hopefully there's not actually 15
45:45 - more minutes in this video I want to do
45:48 - a couple more things number one is it
45:49 - would really be nice I think it's really
45:51 - nice and one to guess if you could sort
45:52 - of like highlight that point that's
45:53 - moving along the trail so I should be
45:57 - able to do that by saying separately
46:01 - right strokeweight
46:03 - 8 points current dot X current dot y
46:09 - this isn't gonna work so why is it not
46:11 - there because I as soon as I added it I
46:15 - recreate so I don't love this but I'm
46:18 - just gonna move this to down here maybe
46:20 - I should put that in a separate function
46:21 - like a critical but there we go
46:23 - now I can see I can actually also see
46:25 - the point that it's moving on that's
46:27 - nice I don't know if this is going to
46:29 - matter but I'm on like a high density
46:31 - display here it's being captured with a
46:34 - green screen so I don't know if this is
46:35 - gonna do anything but it'll look nicer
46:37 - for me I'm gonna change the pixel
46:39 - density of this sketch to - oh not
46:43 - available for this display so so that
46:46 - doesn't make a difference I would have
46:47 - to unplug it so you can't see it but
46:49 - that's fine I am gonna use though the P
46:51 - 2d renderer because what I would like to
46:58 - do now is I would like to use full
47:01 - screen so let's just be careful about
47:05 - this for a second I mean use the P to do
47:06 - T renderer and I'm going to make the
47:09 - much bigger let's see what happens so we
47:13 - could see this is a small Lisa Zhu table
47:16 - and I probably want this like buffer
47:18 - between them should be a ratio of their
47:20 - size like maybe it should always be W
47:23 - minus like 10 percent of W or something
47:27 - or the 0.9 times w would work maybe a
47:31 - little bit more with so Pixley okay so I
47:38 - like this now uh-oh oh there's an
47:43 - interesting
47:44 - oh it's ding so first of all there's a
47:45 - big problem here the as soon as this one
47:47 - that's above me right now gets all the
47:49 - way to the end it's just like redoing
47:51 - its points so one thing I should do and
47:54 - also is it backwards
47:55 - I think it's backwards but I'm getting
47:59 - some big red error there I gotta take a
48:01 - look at this it's back I mean it's kind
48:03 - of fine I don't know that it actually
48:05 - matters but I think in those examples
48:07 - the the dot moves counterclockwise
48:09 - rather than clockwise this would be the
48:12 - easy thing for me to fix because I can
48:14 - just do minus equals but I also want to
48:17 - do something like if angle is less than
48:22 - negative 2 pi like it's gone all the way
48:25 - around once then let me let me reset it
48:30 - and maybe I want to like save an image
48:32 - of it so I'm just going to do like
48:34 - curves index i dot reset like reset all
48:38 - the curves and so I could write a
48:40 - function reset which would just take the
48:44 - path and clear it I think let's have it
48:46 - like do it really fast
48:48 - just to see if that works so let's like
48:50 - have it go ten times as fast so it gets
48:54 - all the way around and it clears oh oh
48:58 - you know what I guess I'm gonna have to
49:01 - reset the angle back to zero that was a
49:05 - bug so if I do that now it's gonna go
49:07 - all the way around and we start over and
49:10 - you know what I really want to do also
49:12 - is when it does that let me do like save
49:14 - frame you know Lisa do one two three
49:19 - four you know so I can like save it now
49:23 - there
49:23 - gonna be the same so know why I'm doing
49:24 - this over and over again but that's fine
49:26 - but I just want to be able to look at it
49:28 - later okay let's make this back down and
49:33 - then let's let's go a little nuts here
49:34 - 20 no that's just crazy let's try it oh
49:39 - you cannot good bye good bye - goodbye
49:47 - to YouTube compression algorithm for
49:49 - sure alright that's better so you can
49:50 - see I can have a really large table and
49:53 - by the way you should see here of course
49:55 - as they're going the same speed they
49:58 - should be always circles so you can see
50:02 - these interesting like patterns here
50:04 - based on the ratio of the column to the
50:06 - row so this really should be like
50:08 - divisible more nicely so that it fills
50:11 - out you could do so much more with color
50:12 - and stuff like that I probably should
50:15 - make these dots actually also a ratio of
50:18 - the size so the stroke weight should be
50:20 - a ratio but let's look at what that
50:23 - error is because I people are gonna be
50:25 - wondering we can I can I please
50:28 - grab this mmm I have no idea what this
50:35 - is so somebody will tell me in the
50:37 - comments and I will pin that comment
50:39 - let's see if I get that error in p.3d it
50:45 - just what if I don't use people oh
50:47 - actually you know it runs kind of fine
50:49 - in p.2d I thought I might need the
50:50 - hardware acceleration to get it going
50:52 - kind of fullscreen but this is fine save
50:56 - the frame before Oh before I reset the
50:59 - circles yep you know it actually should
51:01 - be fine because it's okay to reset the
51:03 - circles without redrawing it so I'm not
51:06 - redrawing it so let's let me make sure
51:07 - it gets all the way through and by the
51:11 - way I also probably don't need to save I
51:13 - could like in the path I could save
51:15 - every other point so all right so come
51:20 - on let's get all the way to the end oh
51:25 - it's because I'm doing it in P 2d it's
51:27 - getting really slow alright I'm not I'm
51:29 - doing it in regular you see what I mean
51:31 - in this video was here we go
51:35 - I'll speed this up in post walk slowly
51:53 - all the way super chat new member I
51:56 - cannot pronounce the Russian name but
51:59 - thank you alright okay so it reset
52:01 - itself it's going again and let's go
52:04 - here and let's look ups sorry let's look
52:08 - in the sketch folder we see Lisa Zhu 629
52:10 - dot PNG and there it is there's our
52:12 - beautiful Lisa Zhu table that's some
52:15 - number of columns by some number of rows
52:18 - thank you for watching this coding
52:20 - challenge stay tuned I'm gonna do like a
52:21 - five minute video where I port this to
52:23 - JavaScript if you want to watch that
52:25 - link in the description below
52:27 - oh please make your this dot Lisa Zhu
52:30 - make your own version of this share it
52:32 - with me
52:32 - Twitter Mastodon is the new place
52:34 - they'll be some videos talking about
52:35 - that in the comments and all those kind
52:37 - of stuff thanks very much good bye okay
52:49 - alright so one thing I want to do just
52:53 - before I forget is now I feel silly
52:59 - doing this but I'm going to welcome to a
53:06 - coding challenge I'm showing you quickly
53:07 - before I start the end so I finished it
53:10 - this is what I'm going to make it's
53:11 - called a Lisa jus table it is a what is
53:14 - it okay I'm gonna say less what coding
53:29 - challenge number on my own I don't know
53:35 - hello welcome to coding challenge number
53:38 - written in the title I don't know what
53:39 - number it is
53:40 - this is a Lisa Zhu table I'm really
53:41 - excited to have done completed this
53:43 - coding challenge as soon as I finish
53:45 - talking it will start I'm going to
53:46 - program this from start to finish from
53:48 - scratch well in the processing
53:50 - environment which is a Java based
53:51 - environment and then I also have made a
53:53 - JavaScript port of this so you can watch
53:55 - you can watch me program the whole thing
53:57 - and then port it to JavaScript in a
53:58 - separate video if you want so I hope you
54:00 - share with me your variations that you
54:02 - make of this I talked a little bit more
54:03 - about what it is and where I got the
54:04 - idea from if you keep watching oh the
54:10 - bitrate is wrecked even just with this
54:12 - so this will do me no good what if I do
54:18 - let me try one with just the static
54:22 - image so why don't I do this okay this
54:32 - should be fine with YouTube compression
54:34 - Yes No
54:45 - I like how it looks okay I'll try it
55:04 - I'll try it a couple ways a smaller
55:07 - count of them alright alright it is good
55:11 - okay hello welcome to at a coding
55:16 - challenge in this coding challenge I'm
55:18 - gonna make this it actually animates oh
55:19 - wait this doesn't need to be there no no
55:24 - why won't that go away go away oh there
55:28 - we go oh hello welcome to a coding
55:33 - challenge in this coding challenge he
55:35 - keeps coming back why did I hit the
55:40 - mouse or something
55:52 - oh hello welcome to a coding challenge
55:55 - in this coding challenge its Alicia do
55:58 - table I really like it it actually
56:00 - animates but I can't show it to you
56:01 - animating because it messes with YouTube
56:03 - compression so this this was made in
56:05 - processing which is a Java based
56:07 - programming environment made it from
56:08 - start to finish in however much time
56:09 - this video is and I also have made a
56:12 - JavaScript version of this that I ported
56:15 - it quickly in a separate video that you
56:16 - can watch as well so I hope you will
56:17 - enjoy this coding challenge make your
56:20 - own version of this table with colors
56:21 - and shapes and designs in ways that I
56:23 - can't possibly imagine and share those
56:25 - with me thanks so much for watching okay
56:29 - now just just as like one more let's see
56:34 - which one looks better
56:36 - what is though what is what are the
56:39 - dimensions of the let me just try like
56:43 - 200 just yeah it's kind of ugly if I
56:54 - could make it stroke weight too
56:55 - everywhere I'm just curious
56:57 - oh yeah that's nicer I think stroke wait
57:03 - - I'm really like cuz I only have an
57:07 - hour I have to go at 4 like I have a
57:09 - thing downstairs I really want to do to
57:11 - talk about mastodons but I really wanted
57:13 - to do this so I'm going to
57:23 - yeah that's weirdly slow this is I feel
57:34 - like actually oh you know what I think
57:35 - p.2d is like unhappy in this with I
57:39 - always forget that when I'm going out to
57:40 - the HDMI and capturing it it makes all
57:42 - sorts of things run and slightly wear it
57:44 - away all right this is good let's do
57:46 - this
57:46 - let's try this one okay to it in 3d that
57:52 - would be that's an awesome idea
57:53 - hello welcome to a coding challenge and
57:56 - this coding challenge I am going to make
57:57 - this actually already made it that's
57:59 - what I made it's called a Lisa Zhu table
58:00 - I got inspired by this by some things
58:03 - I'll talk about in a second this one was
58:05 - made with processing which is a Java
58:06 - based environment but I've also made a
58:08 - JavaScript version of it that you can
58:10 - watch in a separate video where I poured
58:11 - it so I hope you enjoy this coding
58:13 - challenge where I program this thing and
58:15 - and make some exciting cool weird wacky
58:19 - beautiful strange animated art with it
58:22 - okay goodbye see you soon
58:29 - all right that was like a weird
58:31 - introduction but I'm gonna stop now I'm
58:33 - gonna let Matt you do do what he thinks
58:38 - best come on
58:58 - okay let me just hit this okay that was
59:04 - bad it was pretty bad right make it
59:09 - slower that I'm not gonna use that one
59:12 - suggestion from chat what if you what
59:15 - what if do not use curves but just draw
59:17 - points and apply point nine transparent
59:20 - oh yeah that's a nice idea so there's so
59:23 - many I'm not worried about I love that
59:25 - suggestion thank you very much I'm gonna
59:27 - leave it to you the viewer to make it
59:29 - more beautiful or different or creative
59:31 - version of this I just wanted to get the
59:33 - functionality down pit errors occur when
59:36 - multiple Java programs are non multi
59:38 - threaded or open wonder if I had
59:42 - something else open somewhere or who
59:44 - knows
59:45 - okay so let's port this to JavaScript
59:47 - real quick and I'm gonna do it with the
59:51 - p5 editor
60:02 - great should I do the flip thing no I
60:11 - don't have the new flip all right let's
60:13 - not do the flip thing
60:31 - so much I think this can probably just
60:34 - sit on its own as like I totally said
60:37 - this is not a coding challenge it's not
60:38 - like part two of the coding challenge
60:39 - maybe it could be but it'll just be like
60:41 - a side for people who want to do this
60:43 - okay okay so you know I don't think
60:57 - there's a find and replace
60:58 - I just realized in the p5 web editor
61:04 - that's fine I'll do it manually it'll be
61:07 - fun
61:07 - okay let's do
61:19 - strokeweight one one one no I don't want
61:27 - to ask Siri give me a break one okay oh
61:35 - and that's going too fast so let's do
61:39 - this
61:46 - hello this is a short follow-up to my
61:48 - Lisa jus table coding challenge what if
61:51 - it screwed this video is just take the
61:52 - processing code paste it into the p5.js
61:55 - web editor and quickly make all the
61:57 - changes to have this run in JavaScript
61:59 - and let's see how long that takes I
62:00 - think I could do this pretty quickly and
62:01 - hopefully this will be useful to you to
62:02 - see how you might quickly port the
62:04 - sketch back and forth so let's start
62:06 - with just this main tab here I'm gonna
62:09 - do
62:09 - select all I'm gonna go into the p5 web
62:11 - editor and I'm gonna do paste so I've
62:13 - got all of the what is it the Java code
62:18 - in here now so all the let me just do
62:33 - that again
62:47 - hello this is a quick follow-up video
62:50 - from my Lisa jus coding challenge which
62:53 - you can see running here in a 400 by 400
62:55 - window in processing what I'm gonna do
62:56 - in this video is take all this code copy
62:59 - into the p5 Jess web editor and convert
63:02 - it all the JavaScript can I do that just
63:03 - like five minutes and get it running and
63:05 - canvas in the browser so you can use
63:06 - that code if you want to make a
63:07 - browser-based version let's see so the
63:10 - first thing I'm gonna do is I'm
63:10 - literally just gonna take all the coded
63:13 - copy paste it so I'm going to copy and
63:15 - then I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna do
63:17 - paste save so I'm you know and then I'm
63:20 - also going to create and right over here
63:22 - in this sidebar I can do like add file
63:25 - and I'm gonna make a file called curve J
63:28 - s and then I'm gonna go into curve J s
63:31 - come back to processing get my curve tab
63:33 - and go over here and paste that in so
63:37 - now I have both of those and then I also
63:40 - just want to go into index of HTML and
63:42 - make sure that both both JavaScript
63:44 - files are referenced so now I'm ready to
63:46 - start porting and I'm going to do this
63:48 - in the most manual way possible I could
63:50 - use regular expressions or clever find
63:51 - and replace or write some code to
63:53 - convert it but I'm gonna do it kind of
63:54 - one variable at a time so let let write
63:57 - all the data types this is just ah you
64:01 - know what ah I have an idea so I need to
64:04 - make a two-dimensional array in
64:05 - JavaScript and it's a little bit awkward
64:08 - I remember I wrote a function once
64:09 - called make 2d array
64:11 - I search for make 2d array coding train
64:13 - hey look this might be useful to you
64:21 - please edit not be saying oh here we go
64:23 - this is somebody else's project
64:24 - minesweeper on code pen but look there's
64:27 - my make two date to the array function
64:30 - so I'm gonna close that and I'm gonna
64:33 - bring that into here just put it at the
64:35 - top so now I have this make a 2d array
64:39 - function I'm gonna change the order of
64:42 - the arguments columns rows columns
64:48 - hopefully that's hopefully that's not
64:50 - gonna kill the gonna do anything
64:52 - terrible so this is function this is
64:54 - create canvas ah one thing that I need
64:56 - to do if I doing any integer arithmetic
64:58 - I've got to use floor
65:01 - a floor because because I want to take I
65:05 - have to manually take off the decimal
65:07 - place and then this is now make 2d array
65:11 - rows columns this is let let you keep
65:18 - going down function let let let let let
65:26 - the let song the let song let let let
65:30 - let song the let song what what what
65:39 - what what you're watching somebody sing
65:44 - the Lord let over and over again and
65:48 - copy paste let over we're okay so I'm
65:51 - just gonna take this out for a second
65:52 - guys I don't want to know I don't know
65:53 - how this savings gonna work now ah class
65:56 - Oh classes what a lucky day
65:59 - but this needs to change the constructor
66:01 - and now this dot this dot never forget
66:04 - that this stop there's gonna be a lot of
66:05 - this dotting now and this so I gotta
66:08 - have this dot everywhere this stock this
66:10 - haha this time this dot this dot this
66:17 - dot this dot where did I miss it I don't
66:20 - need void I don't need void I don't need
66:23 - I don't need void oh I don't need float
66:26 - I don't need float also a ray list is
66:29 - not a thing we care about brackets just
66:32 - a plain old array and then I don't need
66:34 - void and then oh this won't work but I
66:37 - can say for let V of this dot path and
66:42 - then I feel like did I juice add
66:45 - somewhere yeah this has to be push clear
66:47 - it's clear a JavaScript function I guess
66:49 - we'll find out we save run okay
66:55 - make 2d array is not defined great job
66:59 - because I have capital letters there
67:02 - let's put that in here no no don't
67:04 - reload the site just do this P vector is
67:08 - not define ah okay so that's also
67:11 - another one that I forgot this has to be
67:13 - create vector
67:18 - and what create vector I think that
67:22 - should be good and now Oh current is not
67:27 - defined what is going on here oh this
67:30 - dot current I currents got the fine line
67:37 - 37 also this dot this dot there we go
67:44 - look at that
67:45 - Lisa two table in JavaScript let's see
67:49 - how it performs so by the way this this
67:53 - URL will be linked in the in the video
67:55 - let's try I forget how I do this
67:58 - but if I do I think if I say create
68:02 - canvas window with is that what it is
68:05 - mp5 window with window height that will
68:10 - give me the whole thing there we go and
68:12 - then if I do sketch or file save file
68:18 - one more share fullscreen here we go you
68:25 - know what this is running faster crazily
68:28 - I feel like this is running faster I
68:30 - should have just done this in JavaScript
68:31 - the whole time I had this idea looks
68:33 - it's less like weirdly pixelated - or
68:36 - maybe it is so look at that that's
68:38 - beautiful view I mean I'm sure you can't
68:41 - see this because of because of the
68:45 - YouTube compression so let me just go
68:47 - back here and make this something much
68:50 - bigger like 120 and let me let me go
68:57 - view enter full screen and refresh
69:01 - refresh did I not save save refresh
69:06 - there we go and now here it is your
69:09 - JavaScript Lisa - table so if you prefer
69:11 - to work in JavaScript you can take this
69:13 - code remix it in the p5 editor and some
69:16 - other projects share it with me
69:18 - this dot Lisa jus hashtag this not least
69:21 - add you and I look forward to seeing
69:23 - what you guys make okay goodbye
69:24 - seeing what you all make good bye
69:27 - oh wait a second
69:30 - it broke stop stop the presses
69:35 - stop the presses clear is not a function
69:42 - javascript array prototype let's look at
69:47 - what it is what there is is there I mean
69:50 - I could just set it to a new array but
69:52 - is there like some kind of just like
69:54 - clear it I mean splice all of it shift
69:57 - all of it reverse reduce all of it no
69:59 - that's reduce of something else okay I
70:02 - don't know what it is but I'm going to
70:04 - go over here and I know you can't see me
70:06 - right now I mean you can't see the code
70:08 - right now because I've done something
70:09 - horrible you know I have a new key
70:11 - command Oh No yeah this one okay you
70:13 - don't I don't not here anymore but
70:14 - you're looking at the code and I this is
70:18 - probably I should do all my videos no
70:20 - one wants to look at me where am I
70:22 - looking to do a reset curve reset
70:30 - where's reset this dot path equals and
70:35 - here I come back ha hi I'm back and now
70:37 - save and now refresh and here we go look
70:42 - so I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave you
70:44 - at the end of this video watching this
70:45 - beautiful Lisa do pattern emerge okay I
71:03 - have new create vector uh where did I do
71:06 - that
71:07 - oh shoot
71:14 - well I think we're just gonna have to
71:16 - live with that I fixed it now though
71:19 - okay by the way if you want this code
71:25 - right now somebody could somebody who
71:27 - has privileges could post this link into
71:30 - the chat all right what time is it how
71:37 - we doing
71:41 - processing it can go away now wait hold
71:46 - on worse what is this left at
71:58 - I'm gonna leave the code as this I think
72:01 - okay
72:06 - f11 thank you
72:08 - close processing okay so we are moving
72:17 - on we're gonna take a short break
72:18 - it's not really a break but I just need
72:21 - a minute here to get reorganized
72:23 - microphone
72:42 - [Music]
73:16 - [Music]
73:25 - I'm gonna do this this star this star
73:28 - this star this star song never forget
73:30 - the Vista but somebody composed that
73:33 - song for me
73:55 - so this is random this is noise Perley
73:58 - noise that is in the core random
74:00 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
74:02 - itself those numbers aren't related at
74:05 - all you pick like I'm picking random
74:07 - numbers between zero and ten nine two
74:09 - seven six one nine four eight nine to
74:14 - one thirty I think nine line apparently
74:16 - but with curly noise I might pick
74:18 - numbers like this two three four three
74:21 - four five six five four five six seven
74:24 - five six seven five six seven eight nine
74:27 - eight seven six this is like Perlin
74:31 - noise performance part
74:43 - this is like cursing noise performance
74:46 - apart with early noise I might pick
74:54 - numbers like this
75:02 - Perley noise that it's early noise so
75:04 - this is Hurley noise that is Hurley
75:06 - noise this is Hurley noise that is
75:07 - Hurley no so this is Hurley noise that
75:09 - is her hurling her Perlin noise that is
75:11 - hurling boy
75:12 - this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley
75:13 - this is this is Hurley noise that it's
75:15 - Hurley so this is her Lee noise that is
75:37 - sorry I didn't realize the camera was
75:39 - off so I have 45 minutes and I am going
75:45 - to attempt hold on I'm gonna attempt to
75:51 - make up Mastodon bot I'm not probably
75:54 - won't get as far as I want to but let's
76:01 - see here we go so I've got a kind of
76:10 - crazy password here in my password
76:12 - manager no app I mean that's my big my
76:16 - email yeah nobody cares everybody can
76:22 - find that email anyway that's like but
76:25 - I'm just I'm gonna type in my password
76:27 - here that's not the login anyway so
76:31 - that's good
76:51 - what's the chance this works oh wait
76:58 - wait wait oh you probably just typed it
77:04 - in wrong sorry sorry everyone I have to
77:11 - get the setup here I'm not password
77:13 - changed Oh different email different
77:18 - email don't tell me I have to retype
77:23 - this sorry everyone
77:33 - get in there could this really be the I
77:40 - should've thought of this hope this
77:44 - works what I get for having like the
77:47 - craziest impossible password ever like 8
77:51 - million characters because I never have
77:54 - to type it in except I don't have my
77:56 - passport manager installed on this
77:58 - laptop No okay shoot all right whoops
78:16 - where am i all right
78:22 - how am I gonna do this let me just make
78:25 - a let me make an insecure password and
78:30 - I'll change it again later see if that
78:38 - comes through
78:43 - reset password change password password
78:51 - it's too short too short okay
79:02 - login there we go okay here we go okay
79:26 - all right so mastodons what is Mastodon
79:30 - and then we need to go to bots in space
79:35 - okay and okay let me get back to slack
79:46 - all right
80:07 - Activity pub
80:19 - I think I will like to sign in to github
80:22 - and this is just going to require
80:24 - two-factor
80:51 - when welcome for okay alright okay
81:00 - please what is Mastodon it is exactly
81:03 - what I'm going about to talk about what
81:07 - is Mastodon is the topic I believe
81:11 - Mastodon is also sponsored by water
81:12 - actually smashing I'm probably espanish
81:14 - apparently I have some real sponsors to
81:17 - admit and one other place I need to go
81:31 - to is this YouTube channel called coding
81:35 - terrain if you stay all the way to they
81:36 - add into this live stream I'm gonna show
81:38 - you my new coding train store which you
81:42 - can find very easily without me showing
81:46 - it to you but I will show it to you okay
81:48 - playlists I'm looking for programming
81:54 - from A to Z Twitter very bad there we go
82:05 - okay
82:11 - okay
82:19 - all right
82:26 - I'm ready are you ready
82:49 - alright wow look at this
82:55 - Tobias right there hi YouTube okay
83:00 - hello welcome to a new playlist this is
83:04 - a replacement playlist for my session
83:08 - four of the programming from A to Z
83:10 - course session four is all about making
83:11 - a Twitter bot but guess what I give up
83:15 - on you Twitter goodbye Twitter I'm still
83:18 - using Twitter but it's I'll talk about
83:20 - this a lot of things about the Twitter
83:22 - API changed which make it not such a
83:24 - viable not to mention sort of like a
83:26 - highly toxic problematic place in
83:28 - general but a lot of things about the
83:29 - Twitter API have changed to make it
83:31 - problematic for your creative
83:32 - experimental wacky fun meaningful active
83:36 - what art bots so a social network
83:41 - platform that you might be interested in
83:43 - experiment with is something is called
83:45 - method on this is something that I am
83:47 - now experimenting with I'm going to
83:51 - start this over because I kind of like
83:56 - what am I talking about
83:57 - alright um you know I really don't and I
84:01 - was can I leave this here and it won't
84:02 - scroll okay I should be back streaming
84:06 - apologies I'm surprised that that didn't
84:16 - happen till now because there's an issue
84:17 - I think with this computer overheating
84:20 - and so yeah so I think I'm back I'm
84:28 - going to start recording I don't have
84:29 - the YouTube chat up and see if I can get
84:33 - that up really quickly
84:40 - I wouldn't be surprised if this happens
84:47 - again so apologies to everyone oh that's
84:54 - a good idea
85:04 - you just oh crap
85:09 - we're gonna see who's faster hold on I
85:17 - just wanna
85:26 - come on count to three
85:30 - there we go that'll do it
85:35 - ah yes that's what I want
85:43 - sorry I want to I want the local time
85:46 - line so let me see if I can let me see
85:49 - if I can do that
85:51 - since I'm hopefully not going to by
85:55 - accident where is that a home no but
86:01 - that's not the that's if you're logged
86:04 - in Alka that's if you're logged in what
86:10 - I want to do is I have to do it under
86:12 - administration and I apologize if
86:15 - anybody's name is coming up here that
86:16 - that they don't want to have up here
86:18 - site settings since them now ah there we
86:24 - go
86:25 - Oh shown own this is what I want okay
86:29 - okay that should do it
86:33 - Save Changes okay but now I think maybe
86:42 - I don't want okay here we go let's try
86:46 - this one more time
86:47 - hi so I don't know what's going on and
86:49 - either let me just that but what I'm
86:51 - actually going to do is I'm going to
86:53 - turn the volume on in that computer
86:56 - because it actually it does this weird
87:01 - hold on I have to but I have to turn my
87:02 - monitoring off which is not a big deal
87:04 - but actually I can leave that it's fine
87:07 - it it starts to beep and I've never
87:11 - heard this before it just starts to beep
87:13 - and I'm pretty sure it's overheating
87:14 - this is not this laptop this laptop all
87:17 - is do it is is not streaming anything I
87:19 - just have HDMI going out there's a trash
87:22 - can on the floor over there that takes
87:24 - all the cameras in and the laptop in and
87:26 - streams and recently it just dies I
87:30 - probably should upgrade the OS that's
87:34 - one thing I could try to do because I am
87:37 - still on a pretty old so maybe I'll
87:39 - do that after I shut down today maybe I
87:43 - can get some software to test if anybody
87:45 - has any ideas please let me know
87:52 - okay so let's the people in this flat
87:55 - channel are giving me a lot of helpful
87:56 - suggestions let's let me look at that
87:58 - after I stop streaming for tonight don't
88:00 - have the YouTube chat up right now cuz
88:02 - it's like it takes me so long good set
88:03 - everything up and it just freezes at to
88:05 - restart so I do have I do I'm able to
88:08 - look at the YouTube chat here and but
88:14 - let's see I definitely need to come up
88:16 - with a new solution so if I have to take
88:18 - a week off to like set up a new computer
88:19 - not a whole week off I just mean a
88:21 - streaming alright let's try to make
88:27 - let's try to get this mastodon bot thing
88:30 - going okay
88:42 - hello welcome to a new tutorial series
88:46 - this tutorial series is actually a
88:48 - replacement for session four from a
88:51 - program room from A to Z which is
88:53 - Twitter API and BOTS with nodejs
88:55 - you can just it's exactly the same
88:58 - session it's going to be the same
88:59 - session it's gonna be session for
89:00 - mastodons API and box with no chance
89:03 - mastodons what is mastodons why using
89:06 - Macedon well a couple reasons number one
89:09 - is Twitter recently changed their API
89:14 - rules how it works it's much harder to
89:16 - sign up for new accounts that are bought
89:18 - accounts they've also removed a feature
89:23 - which was the streaming API which
89:26 - Macedon does have so I'll come back and
89:28 - show you what that exactly is but allows
89:30 - you to basically have a connection to
89:33 - the service and continually listen for
89:36 - different events and so you could still
89:38 - hopefully maybe if you want try to make
89:40 - Twitter bots but I am giving up on it I
89:42 - think there's a lot of problems with the
89:44 - Twitter platform as a whole and if what
89:46 - I'm interested I'm interested in its
89:48 - community and experimental weird crazy
89:50 - avant-garde art image poetry nonsense
89:55 - BOTS mmm Mastodon is a pretty good place
89:58 - to do it
89:59 - so first so what is Mastodon so first of
90:02 - all Mastodon is an open source project
90:04 - if you want to find out about it just go
90:06 - to join Mastodon org and also the toot
90:11 - sweet organization on github the
90:13 - Mastodon project so it's an open source
90:15 - project II and sorry I'm looking for the
90:21 - thing that I wanted to say it's an open
90:24 - source project there was like a nice
90:27 - little
90:32 - why I'm at two you're gonna hit this out
90:36 - yeah okay it's an open-source project
90:41 - you can read right here find friends
90:43 - discover new ones publish anything you
90:45 - want links pictures text video on a
90:46 - platform that is community owned and
90:49 - ad-free but the really the thing that's
90:52 - really exciting and interesting to me
90:54 - about Mastodon is that it is a
90:56 - decentralized social network what does
90:59 - that mean
90:59 - so in mind you I am NOT an expert in
91:02 - this I will link to a really nice
91:03 - YouTube video from master the Mastodon
91:06 - project what is Mastodon you could go
91:07 - and watch that if you want so let me
91:09 - give you my kind of take on this so
91:11 - let's say you sign up for an account
91:13 - from Twitter and you are on your own
91:17 - computer your device your phone or
91:19 - whatever you're using it as a Twitter
91:20 - client you are connecting to the Twitter
91:22 - server you are sending messages there
91:25 - you are reading messages back all of
91:27 - your data is stored here on the Twitter
91:31 - service this is a centralized service
91:34 - and the web more and more of these days
91:36 - is moving moves into the web originally
91:38 - if you okay I think I am back so I am
91:41 - gonna actually gonna give up on this
91:42 - live stream right now for now you know I
91:45 - have 15 minutes before I have to be
91:47 - downstairs for a meeting but I'm so I'm
91:53 - gonna use that time to see if I can
91:54 - upgrade this machine I got some good
91:56 - suggestions of oh yeah oh and this is
91:59 - the great idea Cody's made sponsored by
92:02 - water I'm just going to go ahead and
92:03 - pour water on the computer them not
92:06 - those computer the computer over there
92:07 - I'm gonna see if I can fix up this
92:09 - machine just by upgrading it and
92:11 - installing some stuff to manage the fan
92:13 - and then I will try to come back later
92:17 - today or Monday to do the mastodons
92:20 - stuff but you know even if I even if it
92:23 - wasn't gonna freeze again in 10 minutes
92:24 - I'm not gonna get much done in 10
92:26 - minutes so at least to show you since if
92:29 - anybody's curious and a feedback is
92:32 - welcome they do haven't so let me just
92:36 - if this freezes again by the way I'm not
92:38 - gonna come back I'm just gonna add
92:39 - mystery so if the cuts off it cuts off
92:42 - and I'll talk until it cuts off so if
92:45 - you
92:46 - want to well I was gonna just talk a
92:49 - little bit about Mastodon but I guess
92:51 - I'll save that uh I guess I'll mention
92:53 - the store so if I go to teespring
92:56 - dot-com slash stores slash coding train
92:59 - I'm gonna show you this is fun I'm gonna
93:02 - show you all this new stuff thank you -
93:04 - Jason hey Glen hey Glen - is the did
93:09 - illustrative designer who has done a ton
93:12 - of stuff for the coding great look there
93:14 - we go
93:15 - coding train and so we have a whole lot
93:18 - of new stuff these coding is magical
93:21 - shirts with all those people have
93:23 - requested the I'll refactor that later
93:25 - sure it's different characters and the
93:31 - this dot one is somewhere in here well
93:35 - maybe I remember it was on that first
93:36 - page there yeah I never forget that this
93:42 - dot there it is the new coding train
93:45 - bouncy logo and some other stuff of
93:47 - course this one
93:49 - so anyway poke around feedback is
93:51 - welcome if you see stuff that's not
93:53 - there that could be there stuff doesn't
93:54 - work does it make sense thank you for
93:57 - your support please don't feel obligated
93:58 - to get anything the I will be sending
94:00 - these out as gifts and things to people
94:02 - subscribe to patreon and that sort of
94:04 - stuff ok so I wanted to show that on
94:07 - theory let's see how this works in
94:10 - theory this is integrated with YouTube
94:13 - this is totally gonna course it's not
94:15 - freezing freezing now right if I go here
94:23 - oh no no that's next
94:25 - live now if I go here and it's find
94:28 - there's no Mastodon BOTS in this and I
94:30 - scrolled down yeah there we go
94:33 - so that doesn't work look at that so
94:39 - these are expensive
94:40 - I'm definitely this is the one that I
94:41 - want to get I will be buying this one
94:44 - for me for myself probably okay so thank
94:50 - you for being patient and dealing with
94:54 - the fact that this is like not working
94:55 - I'm looking at the YouTube chat now so
94:58 - I'm gonna figure
94:59 - I got to make this content cuz it's for
95:01 - my class wouldn't discord BOTS and their
95:04 - WebSockets be more interesting I don't
95:07 - know about more interesting definitely
95:09 - interesting I have to admit that I am
95:10 - NOT a discord user I've been tempted to
95:15 - set it up in lieu of slack as the member
95:19 - community for the coding train but I
95:22 - just haven't had the time to explore it
95:24 - and then once I suggested it do like no
95:26 - no don't bother with that so so yeah so
95:32 - thank you I mean I would happily stay on
95:34 - while I try to upgrade this computer and
95:36 - install stuff but I don't think that's
95:38 - gonna be that interesting and then also
95:39 - have to restart the computer which will
95:41 - shut the stream down so at least we got
95:42 - that at least we got the Lisa 2 coding
95:49 - challenge in I feel kind of good about
95:51 - that
95:51 - and the that will get edited and pushed
95:55 - out next week sometime and if I can
95:57 - manage I don't know if I can manage to
95:58 - make it back today but I really got to
96:00 - do that Mastodon stuff so maybe I can
96:02 - get an extra hour or two in on Monday so
96:05 - just stay tuned stay tuned just stay
96:15 - tuned sorry I was looking at the chat
96:17 - stay tuned if you want it like when a
96:19 - might the places I was on Twitter you
96:21 - could follow me on Twitter no stay tuned
96:25 - I will announce the best way to find out
96:28 - when I'm going to livestream again is
96:30 - just to take the home check the home
96:32 - page on YouTube because it will show you
96:34 - like there's definitely going to be one
96:36 - next Friday text generation with
96:39 - tensorflow ml5 and the spell platform
96:42 - with Nabil Hussain so we're gonna do an
96:44 - LS TM neural network model with a guest
96:47 - next Friday and so as soon as I figure
96:51 - out if I can come back later or on
96:52 - Monday I'll post also another one here
96:54 - in the upcoming live streams ok that's
96:58 - it but uh what a sad
97:01 - I will refactor this computer later what
97:05 - a sad ending to today's live stream but
97:09 - I am going to have to go and see what I
97:12 - could do about this computer
97:13 - even if I could just come back and just
97:14 - like explain what Mastodon is and make
97:17 - one little simple bot it'll be worth it
97:19 - to me if I can manage to do that in a
97:20 - little while so we'll see if I come back
97:23 - today it would be between like 6 p.m.
97:24 - and 7 p.m. Eastern Time so and now of
97:28 - course it's not crashing now which is
97:30 - ridiculous frustrating so but let's see
97:34 - I know about you've got to go to sleep
97:35 - go to sleep don't wait up for me because
97:37 - I am NOT this is not a reliable thing
97:40 - thank you everybody thank you for tuning
97:42 - in and I will see you next time bye
97:50 - everybody
97:51 - [Music]
97:57 - I forgot I have to press the stop
97:58 - streaming button where do I do that they
98:01 - lost that page I'm going I'm going
98:09 - don't make me pull this car over um
98:15 - customize channel no that's not what I

98:36 - room let's try this one more time thank
98:45 - you everybody for watching today's
98:46 - livestream I will see you next time on
98:49 - the coding train goodbye everybody
98:53 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

hello and happy Friday it is Friday it is time for the coding train with me your host Daniel chief Mon mmm and I'm so excited to be here I did have a livestream last Friday and I had a guest evening she was here yuning she was here to demonstrate how to train a style transfer model using tensor flow or train that model model locally on your computer or in the cloud using a service called spell and use the ml 5 library to take that model and use it in the browser and to style your image from the webcam all that exciting stuff and if you missed it you can go back and watch it but coming this Monday edited versions of yuning's livestream will come out so if you're looking for just the kind of stepbystep instructions without all the unplugging and plugging in of wires and me interrupting her by accident stay tuned for that all right so I have so many things I feel like I want to announce and talk about but I'm just gonna put all that aside and guess what I am starting this instant with a coding challenge you know I just I just don't have it in me to go on and on about like the store and the patreon and all that sort of stuff I uh and I'm gonna use processing for this although I think what I'm gonna do sorry I'm looking for a marker am i over here I'm looking for my manie's processing for this and which is Java and then as soon as I'm done I am going to oh oh I know where my markers are I need some cleanup in this room now I have a whole thing of markers I got pink green and black and another black one and even like some new ones all right so uh how are you how's everybody doing today are you are you well are you happy it's Friday I don't know how that is in your life so nice Friday is like the start of difficult stuff sometimes it's the end of difficult stuff sometimes it's just another day for me I'm really looking forward to this weekend I might wait my life is working these days I have to wake up very very early and on Saturday I can sleep until like 730 in the morning if I want my children don't wake me up earlier they're not allowed to get out of bed if you're watching right now you must stay in bed until 800 a.m. then you can get out of bed and read and play Legos and all that stuff okay I am seeing a note over here that that the stream status YouTube is telling me is okay I want it to be good when I see the green good makes me happy all right so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna start by programming a Lisa Zhu Lisa IU leaves as you see sighs ooh Lisa Zhu table curved table I'm gonna open up processing here I'm going to check the font size to make sure that seems good look that's my little seat look at this coding new coding train characters see these little brackets over here now classes person thing and I'll come back I got a new store and new tshirts and everything I'll come back to that later see if you can find it what's over here Oh style transfer okay so this looks good font size wise and let me just save this I want to reference standup maths standup maths YouTube this particular video videos no this is the wrong channel this is Matt Parker's other channel Lisa Zhu who I'm signed in as here can I sign it as myself all right this is my weird fake you can't I just leave it there that's fine yes all right so reference this video thank you very much then let's go find the links here to this tweet and this tweet and then we can also maybe look at why is my brightness so down on this computer okay we can look at and it's so tiny we can look at Wikipedia is good okay all right we're ready for this did I say I was just jumping right in hasn't even been five minutes of livestreaming and I'm about to start coding and one turning a new leaf a new page in the book of random numbers well it's been a while though twenty two thousand three hundred and fifty eighty four thousand seven hundred and thirtyfive seventyone thousand six hundred fifty twenty seven thousand six hundred thirty six thousand seven hundred twenty six thirty nine thousand nine hundred and seventy nine sixty eight thousand five hundred and twenty three seventy nine thousand five hundred twentyone fortyseven thousand four hundred and thirtyeight five thousand three hundred sixtyfive ninety one thousand seven hundred sixtyfive twenty eight thousand three hundred ninety fifty seven thousand three hundred sixtythree and sixty nine thousand 137 hey six ninety thousand six hundred and eight eighty seven thousand four hundred and thirty six fifty thousand two hundred and ninety nine I lost my place okay and let's check everybody everything's working what brand of markers okay oh the slowmode is not on slow mode is off today is just a crazy day no rules and I will be turning slow mode on immediately in five four three we'll see if I need to turn it on somebody please let me know doo doo moderators do appointed moderators have the ability to turn it on themselves that's the question that I do not know the answer to do okay this I don't need is this enough space can I move can i cheap this a little bit over this way and yes and also let's check console prints hello here that's viewable okay I think we're good I think I'm ready I think I can do moderators cannot alright alright you you're only a you're just it's very sad how you required me to do this Internet don't worry I'm here to help I'm here to save the day info and settings live control room ingestion settings actually I'm kind of lost here once I already once I've already started can I adjust tiles higher Stan's managed miners participants advanced settings there we go slow mode enabled now 10 seconds 10 seconds of doing the 10 second thing I will raise it if I have to I will have to don't make me pull this car over I don't I'm not driving a car kids okay hmm all right no Jules Antoine Lisa Jew in 1857 all right family of curves French physicist okay okay so quickly French yeah so this dot t shirts are available see if you could find them the Vista T's are now available I just haven't finished everything and there's some other styles and colors and things I'm having a few bugs with the store but they are available thank you to uh natter League Gaming that is nice to hear French French people Bolger Oh como sure Paul knows that's not how you say pronounced jewels on Tuan Lisa Lisa jus just Lisa jus right okay somebody will tell me in about twenty seconds because that's how long it takes I need I have tissues I need to blow my nose what other weird music do I have oh this is that's scary Cody train it's sponsored by water thanks everybody stay hydrated the presentation right there in the article where oh hold on No won't speak it for me where is it you say it right all right good enough hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge I am going to attempt to make I'm gonna do I'm gonna do sorry I was thinking about something it's fine I might do you know what I would like to I think it's gonna be interesting looking enough that I would like to have it at the beginning of the video I can't tell whether it's better to actually have it at the beginning of the video or not so I'm gonna start as if I've already introduced the concept oh and I'm not recording this to disk boy I hope things don't crash I was having some crashing issues the other day ok and I'm seeing a weird glitchy thing here better better ok ok the music is still playing I think it stopped by now you shouldn't be hearing any music alright is anybody still hearing music that's weird if you are cuz I'm not little check here it stopped okay great I want anybody do this in half an hour unlikely very unlikely okay welcome to the Lisa Chiu coding challenge now I want to talk about where this idea came from this is not a new idea this is like a 19th century idea but I I was reminded of it by this wonderful video from standup maths YouTube channel Matt Parker actually created a mechanical version of this particular pattern and Matt Parker's video referenced these two wonderful gifts one from Giulio Lara on Twitter and then this one here from Vincent pant to Loney and these are really like satisfying fun patterns you could see like what's going on here there's a circle there's a dot moving around it the dots moving around the circles are at different speeds and it's tracing a path and look what's going on so how do you program this thing this is exactly what I'm going to do and I'm going to do it in processing now processing is a Java based programming environment for sketching and creating graphics you can do a lot more with it more information about processing in the video's description and then I will also be making a JavaScript version of this that you can refer to actually I might just do that in a whole separate video so anyway okay so let's get started so the first thing I want to do is I'm going to make a nice window 800 by 800 and I'm going to give it a black background now I need to think thinking is what you do let's do some planning so I'm gonna come over here oh and I have no idea if this markers of reason reasonable but basically what's going on so the idea is that we have a table oh and look at this glare can I fix that in any way yeah a little bit the idea that we have a table maybe there are a number of columns let's just say there are four and maybe there are a number of rows 1 2 3 4 now actually what's going on here is the mathematical principles behind this these Lisa Zhu curves really have nothing to do with well that's a bit man no editing okay let's make a rule except for like extreme debugging I cannot stop and start anymore okay no more stopping and starting no more stopping and starting never plan it okay all right so okay the idea is that we have a table so if we look at that we can see there's a bunch of columns let's just start with four although I have I'm envisioning this giant Lisa do table that we're gonna make at the end four columns and four rows and each one of these is going to show an oscillating pattern so some things you're going to want to know about are the sine function the sine function is a trigonometric or metric function which oscillates a number between negative 1 and 1 I mean it's and the sine of a particular angle and a right triangle is the ratio of the opposite angle over the hypotenuse the length of those two things so this is an important concept and you're also going to want to know about polar coordinates and the idea also of Cartesian coordinates these are things that I use in almost all of my videos just learning to program in processing is an exercise in kind of understanding Cartesian coordinate systems because that's what you're drawing into but a polar coordinate system is a way of saying ok I want to if I have if I have a radius of a circle and an angle how can I describe a point outside the circle so in other words if I could figure out what the radius of each one of these circles are and then have this point travel around it circularly and this would go at one x speed this would go at 2x speed this would go at 3x speed this would go at 4x speed integer whole numbers of course you'd experiment with other stuff too and then I do the same exact thing over here 2 X 3 X 4 X and then here I need to get an x coordinate why don't I get the x coordinate from wherever this happens to be so the x coordinate is oscillating back and forth well I'm gonna get the y coordinate from where this happens to be moving around the circle so it's oscillating up and down it's really just the result it's hard simple harmonic motion don't have a video about that I'm just doing simple harmonic motion on two axes if they're moving at the same speed I will get a nice curve like this if one of them is moving faster than the other I might get something like this not exactly and so on and so forth so this is what we have to build alright so let's start with just making one row of these things alright how am I gonna make a row of these things first let me come up let me start with a single variable called angle because that's the variable what I'm doing I'm a single variable called angle I'm gonna start that at zero then I'm going to I just need to figure out a little bit about the space that I'm in and so I want to think one thing that I want to think about is what is the size of each one of these boxes and let's make that like 10 pixels or 20 pixels and what's going on here we have an 800 by 800 window so let's actually make that 800 pixels so I'm gonna call that W and have that be 80 so it's going to be 10 by 10 and what I want to do now in background and in draw is just say 4 oh and then I need to know how many columns so the number of columns is the width divided by that that size of each box so if I loop in draw start at 0 go go all the way up to columns I plus plus and then I just draw an ellipse at some X and some Y with some let's just use 80 right now some diameter and the X is what I times W and the Y that's just the Y is just zero right now what do I have so I have those circles up there and I want them down shifted over a little bit so the X the Y is really W divided by two and I should be saying no stroke and I should know not no stroke I want the outline so I say stroke 255 and no fill cuz I just want the outline okay great so that's good and I move these things over a little bit so let's also have the X equal to plus W divided by two great because the reference point is this Center that's perfect but the truth of the matter is the corner I'm looking over here that corner up there when I'm creating this table the corner is kind of an empty space so I actually want to start the first one over here and I actually want to have nine instead of ten so the number of columns is actually width divided by W minus one and then the X starts at W Plus this is a little goofy but that's good so that's my top row and you know I don't really like this I want to make the I'm gonna call this like diameter D for diameter of these circles and I'm gonna have that B with no no W minus like 10 just so there's a little daylight a little space in between these things look how like big silly it is can I make that look nicer okay anyway sorry now that's fine so let's start this from now how do I get that point so if I have this angle for each one of these and you know what this is really like Center X circle X circle I Center X centralize the center of each one of those circles now what I need is an offset and an offset is where I can suddenly like I wanna figure out where is this point based on the angle this angle is increasing where is this point along the circle and this is this idea of polar coordinates to Cartesian coordinates so if I know the radius of the circle and I know this angle I can use a formula which says x equals R times cosine of the angle y equals R times sine of the angle down X equals R times cosine of the angle theta being a Greek letter that's often used to signify an angle y equals R times the sine of the angle where do these come from the reference to some other video where I go through this in more detail but right now we just want to add that to here so I'm gonna say x equals R times cosine of the angle and y equals R times sine of the angle and what's our R equals D divided by two that's kind of useful and then I'm gonna say draw I'm gonna say stroke stroke stays the same I'm gonna make the stroke weight stroke weight eight so I'm gonna just draw like a thicker point by just using point point Center X Center X plus the X offset Center y plus the y offset mmhmm and I'm gonna need to say I'm up here I'm gonna need to say this is I'm gonna have to say here stroke weight one so the old circles get a stroke weight of 1 and the points ah there we go look at that you know technically speaking I mean this is fine I could start here but that the point I think if you look at those other Lisa do table images the point starts at the top so I think I can just do like a little offset here and again I should probably be more thoughtful about variable naming and function but I'll refactor this later teacher coming soon for real okay so look at that that's perfect now let's just say angle plus equals 0.01 there we go look all the dots are moving around the circle now perfect the dots are moving around the circle let's even do something really fun here which is like stroke 255 let's give it a little alpha and let's draw a line from see X plus x 0 CX plus X height so now we can see oh wait wait wait stroke wait stroke wait 1 and now we can see there we go so now you can also stroke 255 I'm gonna need to reset the colors everywhere okay there we go so you can see now those I can see those lines which are gonna help us as a visual guide as I start to create those curves curb curves yes I have a very deep voice no curves okay now did I really just do that is that edited out it's not edited out it's probably in the video they were watching right now ah what's the big thing here the big thing is remember is the speed of these needs to increase this one's going to go around two times the fest three times it's minus four times as fast so coming over here I want to say oh this is easy angle I have I have a counter eye so I'm gonna say angle times I plus one because I don't want to multiply it by 0 the 0 1 gets multiplied by 1 etc etc so now we can see there we go oh this is already fun they already like this just like this ok so that's good now oh this really needs refactoring because this I could really think about is like a function and then I could just do that same function vertically but I'm but I am Who I am I will be who I will be i will refactor this later for real and you will also refactor it yourself as an exercise to improve your programming skills and we just change this to Rose this is going to be the Y this is going to be the X and then this is all the same this is all the same except the line now goes from 0 to C y plus y and with to c c y plus y right what I do wrong all right did I not even calculate the Rose so I need a variable that is the number of rows and rows equals height divided by W minus 1 and now there we go so we can see I already I've built the table I could stop right here and I could say I'm done please finish this I'm going to keep going because this is gonna be fun and exciting all right so now what do I do how do i how do I get the curves in here well I see in the chat actually I this screams Oh Opie can someone explain to me with doing me Opie alright what is Opie objectoriented programming so yes I probably should have done this I could refactor this to be objectoriented even this idea of the columns and rows and the objects that are there but what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna make a new tab in processing curve and I'm gonna create a curve class so the curve class is an object and the idea for that object is to store the curve that's gonna go in each one of these spots so what does it need to store that curb I need to store a path so where am i a curve I need to say what do I need I need an ArrayList an ArrayList there's a flexibly size array if I do this in JavaScript I could just make a plain array and I'm gonna fill it with P vectors I'm gonna call that path and then I'm gonna write the constructor and the path is a new ArrayList empty ArrayList so I'm gonna just put points in this path point in the path point in the path point in the path right so I could write like a function that's just like add point and it gets and an X and a Y and then I maybe do something like say path dot add new P vector with that X&Y right and then and this would be void and then I'm gonna also write a function to draw it show and I can say stroke 255 and you should be clever and thoughtful about color and fill and all sorts of pretty different ways of doing this stroke weight one and then I'm going to say for every and this is a nice way of doing an enhanced loop in Java vector in the path set a vertex V dot X V dot Y this is this little bit of code right here is no longer relevant and when I saying begin shape and shape and no fill so this should give me this is actually me drawing the path as a shape using all of the vertices okay Oh somebody's telling me that the vertical lines are not visible and I'm not in the slack channel here okay the vertical lines are not okay two quick fixes I'll make Alka is telling me that half pi is a global constant in processing so if I want it to be I could use that time saying PI divided by two and you cannot see the lines well that's so sad the lines are like my favorite part let's do 150 just make them much more obvious okay that makes them much more obvious hopefully it looks reasonable in the sort of YouTube compression stuff but we'll see we'll see okay so I'm going back to the curve and I just that the debugger biaxin all right so let me format the code so this should draw me the path and then Oh tricky so now at all where do I want to store all these curves well one of the reasons why I wanted to use processing for this is I just feel so comfortable whenever I have a grid like structure like this using a two dimensional array and to mention where right is it really two dimensional it's just a list of lists but we can think of it as a two dimensional matrix see my other videos about twodimensional arrays it's kind of tricky to make those things in Java though absolutely possible JavaScript that is but in Java it's it's not so tough so what I can actually do is I can declare I'm going to call it curves and I can now just say curves equals a new twodimensional array with columns by rows now I have always always always always whoops I have to zoom in on this because I got really something to say here it's fast forward like two or three minutes in this video I have always programmed like this because Cartesian coordinates are expressed as XY so I always think if I'm making a twodimensional array the X's will come first the Y's will come second but I've been doing so much stuff with matrices recently and mathematically matrices are expressed as row by columns that is the standard and this is probably gonna cause me to make all sorts of mistakes and bugs but right now do it Rose I'm gonna consider the first dimension here Rose and the second dimension here columns so everybody try to help me remember this you know sit there and like meditate on this and like send me your brainwaves that's what I'm gonna do so now once I've made it I can just say into I equals zero eyes listen Rose I plus plus shouldn't the eye the eye should be the chyme is so confused the I should still be the columns the J should still be the Rose I mean I should iterate over the J first who knows who knows know what how will I live curves index J index I equals a new curve so there we go I made an object for every single one of those spots and now here's the thing oh I did something so weird here because I made I mean the thing is if it's a square columns and rows are gonna be the same size but I kind of want to this to work for non square images so I really do want to refactor this and put these two blocks of code together in one loop I'm not going to though here's what I'll do I'm willing to if I change this function to like void add X so I make two of them like a separate one for add Y and then when I'm after I add the X and the y I can add the point with both of those so I need to store I'm gonna say P vector current so if I keep a separate variable current equals create vector create vector it doesn't matter what's in it just zero zero or nothing an empty vector then what I could do not create vector in processing it's a new P vector in P five in JavaScript it's create vector so if I do that then I can say current dot X this is really kind of awful I can set the X maybe this is more like set xset why then I can say current dot why and I'm sure all of you were thinking of other ways of doing this which is excellent and I encourage you to try write about that in the comments so if I set both of these then adding the point can just be add like I could do that at the end and I could say add current and then I could say current equals a new I could just make another empty new P vector so I could do that over and over again let's think about this in other words now for every column hold on I know I need to turn the camera back on just so this is a little edit point and I'm just gonna do this camera line here for every oh and what I lost where I was here okay what I want to do is basically for this column I need to set what the X point for all of these for this row I need to set the Y point for all of these so I need another loop inside of each of these like at the end here I'm gonna say for int and this was I so J equals 0 J is less than rows J plus plus and then I'm gonna say curves index J index I set X to this point CX plus X then if I do the same exact thing here but for the columns so this should be I this should be I this should becomes this should be I exercise in like weird copy pasting this should be why this should be why I'm already lost whether I'm doing this correctly okay my back now sound wise you know the the batteries weren't charged when I arrived in this room I am back now how when did that happen that's the question I like that this is working I got a backup so everybody it's okay all right the question is when did that happen what was the last thing I said you change set X to set Y well that was a while ago wow that was a really long time okay let me do let me just do some triage here and let me just processing is not super great about undo but I'm gonna save where I am just in a different file let's see here Thank You Alka for noting where I stopped wait I was in the curve class I was in the curve class onset why not in the main program because that's a way back so sags this was actually going well and I got to get to the mastodon stuff I'm waiting for someone to confirm so we're saying I'm setting the curves xvalue I need to wait Oh in a for loop so it was later I was in the main excellent good so it wasn't that far back too bad it's too late now my redo doesn't seem to be uh but luckily I did this cuz I was okay so TMC I could to a voiceover no changing I and J TMC you gave me a screenshot me at the whiteboard that seems like way before when the sound went out so I believed that I was doing this I believe that I was here this is where I think that I was yeah your tips it is a good point because I could just do both of them so that might not be such a bad idea and then Matt you can edit it together I'm gonna do something here just in case okay did youdid set set wine set X so by the way if you ever just say something like in this flash challenge you say something like yup I have no idea what that's referring to cuz you're like 30 seconds later so you've got to be very specific saying yes I agree you should blah blah blah blah blah okay all right I am going to do yes oh but I didn't change both of them probably but that'll be a little continuity error that nobody noticed okay all right I've got an image here oh that's exactly where I cut out I was changing the I to a J I'm gonna I'm gonna let much you figure out the best way to add it together and I'm gonna go by I'm gonna do TMC's original suggestion even though I was like no no no no no and I'm gonna go back to I'm gonna go back to yeah I'm gonna go back to where I'm starting to add and this wasn't there yet right this would not have been there yet yeah yeah okay okay all right here we go I'm gonna pretend I remember what I was saying at the whiteboard let me check I switched the batteries and that mic I'm just gonna pray okay okay No finally finally I had some livestream going well I got it like I got 20 minutes to finish this up all right so something about how I need to do blah blah blah blah blah blah blah so if I come to the first loop where I'm going through all the columns all I need to do is at the end then add another loop for wait time out I'm now I'm concerned hold on I I saved I need to go back and look at one did I already is the curve did I add like she was show and add point already there I think it was right like I didn't make changes there so I'm going the desktop I have the video recorded over here so I can actually just open it up and watch it sorry you can't see what I'm seeing now so where is the code and the other before the whiteboard I have add points yeah I have all that show an ad were there okay great I can confirm that they were all right thank you everybody thank you for your patience you're very kind to watch these live streams where everything goes wrong at least the system hasn't crashed that's usually my problem okay okay so in this loop here where I'm going through all the columns now I just need to go through all of the rows for each column and set those exports so I is going through the columns so now J will go through the rows and I'm gonna say I forgot what I'm doing curves curves cannot type curves J I dot set X and then what am i doing I'm setting it to exactly this point so I go through all of the rows and set the X point for each column okay then I'm gonna do exactly the same thing here down here but this time I'm going to go through the columns because I'm going through the rows so for each row I go through the each column and this stays the same but now it's Y and I want to set the Y point ah we've got a problem so I used I here but I should use J now so I should be consistent try to always use J with rows and I with columns which means these have to change and this has to change okay great okay no errors and now guess what I'm kind of done I think because basically all that I need to do is call add point and show like once I've set the X and the y add to the path then draw the path so I need a nested loop do I have that somewhere somewhere I have a nested loop yes right up here already let's just actually look at this graph ah no come back to me I'm going to copy this because I don't feel like typing it and go all the way to the end and now instead of this is before I made new curves now I'm just gonna say add point and and what else show oh my goodness could this be it look at that ah there we go look it's the Lisa 2 table so we're what kind of done coding challenge finished why is there like 15 more minutes in this video because like I don't to do a couple more things hopefully there's not actually 15 more minutes in this video I want to do a couple more things number one is it would really be nice I think it's really nice and one to guess if you could sort of like highlight that point that's moving along the trail so I should be able to do that by saying separately right strokeweight 8 points current dot X current dot y this isn't gonna work so why is it not there because I as soon as I added it I recreate so I don't love this but I'm just gonna move this to down here maybe I should put that in a separate function like a critical but there we go now I can see I can actually also see the point that it's moving on that's nice I don't know if this is going to matter but I'm on like a high density display here it's being captured with a green screen so I don't know if this is gonna do anything but it'll look nicer for me I'm gonna change the pixel density of this sketch to oh not available for this display so so that doesn't make a difference I would have to unplug it so you can't see it but that's fine I am gonna use though the P 2d renderer because what I would like to do now is I would like to use full screen so let's just be careful about this for a second I mean use the P to do T renderer and I'm going to make the much bigger let's see what happens so we could see this is a small Lisa Zhu table and I probably want this like buffer between them should be a ratio of their size like maybe it should always be W minus like 10 percent of W or something or the 0.9 times w would work maybe a little bit more with so Pixley okay so I like this now uhoh oh there's an interesting oh it's ding so first of all there's a big problem here the as soon as this one that's above me right now gets all the way to the end it's just like redoing its points so one thing I should do and also is it backwards I think it's backwards but I'm getting some big red error there I gotta take a look at this it's back I mean it's kind of fine I don't know that it actually matters but I think in those examples the the dot moves counterclockwise rather than clockwise this would be the easy thing for me to fix because I can just do minus equals but I also want to do something like if angle is less than negative 2 pi like it's gone all the way around once then let me let me reset it and maybe I want to like save an image of it so I'm just going to do like curves index i dot reset like reset all the curves and so I could write a function reset which would just take the path and clear it I think let's have it like do it really fast just to see if that works so let's like have it go ten times as fast so it gets all the way around and it clears oh oh you know what I guess I'm gonna have to reset the angle back to zero that was a bug so if I do that now it's gonna go all the way around and we start over and you know what I really want to do also is when it does that let me do like save frame you know Lisa do one two three four you know so I can like save it now there gonna be the same so know why I'm doing this over and over again but that's fine but I just want to be able to look at it later okay let's make this back down and then let's let's go a little nuts here 20 no that's just crazy let's try it oh you cannot good bye good bye goodbye to YouTube compression algorithm for sure alright that's better so you can see I can have a really large table and by the way you should see here of course as they're going the same speed they should be always circles so you can see these interesting like patterns here based on the ratio of the column to the row so this really should be like divisible more nicely so that it fills out you could do so much more with color and stuff like that I probably should make these dots actually also a ratio of the size so the stroke weight should be a ratio but let's look at what that error is because I people are gonna be wondering we can I can I please grab this mmm I have no idea what this is so somebody will tell me in the comments and I will pin that comment let's see if I get that error in p.3d it just what if I don't use people oh actually you know it runs kind of fine in p.2d I thought I might need the hardware acceleration to get it going kind of fullscreen but this is fine save the frame before Oh before I reset the circles yep you know it actually should be fine because it's okay to reset the circles without redrawing it so I'm not redrawing it so let's let me make sure it gets all the way through and by the way I also probably don't need to save I could like in the path I could save every other point so all right so come on let's get all the way to the end oh it's because I'm doing it in P 2d it's getting really slow alright I'm not I'm doing it in regular you see what I mean in this video was here we go I'll speed this up in post walk slowly all the way super chat new member I cannot pronounce the Russian name but thank you alright okay so it reset itself it's going again and let's go here and let's look ups sorry let's look in the sketch folder we see Lisa Zhu 629 dot PNG and there it is there's our beautiful Lisa Zhu table that's some number of columns by some number of rows thank you for watching this coding challenge stay tuned I'm gonna do like a five minute video where I port this to JavaScript if you want to watch that link in the description below oh please make your this dot Lisa Zhu make your own version of this share it with me Twitter Mastodon is the new place they'll be some videos talking about that in the comments and all those kind of stuff thanks very much good bye okay alright so one thing I want to do just before I forget is now I feel silly doing this but I'm going to welcome to a coding challenge I'm showing you quickly before I start the end so I finished it this is what I'm going to make it's called a Lisa jus table it is a what is it okay I'm gonna say less what coding challenge number on my own I don't know hello welcome to coding challenge number written in the title I don't know what number it is this is a Lisa Zhu table I'm really excited to have done completed this coding challenge as soon as I finish talking it will start I'm going to program this from start to finish from scratch well in the processing environment which is a Java based environment and then I also have made a JavaScript port of this so you can watch you can watch me program the whole thing and then port it to JavaScript in a separate video if you want so I hope you share with me your variations that you make of this I talked a little bit more about what it is and where I got the idea from if you keep watching oh the bitrate is wrecked even just with this so this will do me no good what if I do let me try one with just the static image so why don't I do this okay this should be fine with YouTube compression Yes No I like how it looks okay I'll try it I'll try it a couple ways a smaller count of them alright alright it is good okay hello welcome to at a coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm gonna make this it actually animates oh wait this doesn't need to be there no no why won't that go away go away oh there we go oh hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge he keeps coming back why did I hit the mouse or something oh hello welcome to a coding challenge in this coding challenge its Alicia do table I really like it it actually animates but I can't show it to you animating because it messes with YouTube compression so this this was made in processing which is a Java based programming environment made it from start to finish in however much time this video is and I also have made a JavaScript version of this that I ported it quickly in a separate video that you can watch as well so I hope you will enjoy this coding challenge make your own version of this table with colors and shapes and designs in ways that I can't possibly imagine and share those with me thanks so much for watching okay now just just as like one more let's see which one looks better what is though what is what are the dimensions of the let me just try like 200 just yeah it's kind of ugly if I could make it stroke weight too everywhere I'm just curious oh yeah that's nicer I think stroke wait I'm really like cuz I only have an hour I have to go at 4 like I have a thing downstairs I really want to do to talk about mastodons but I really wanted to do this so I'm going to yeah that's weirdly slow this is I feel like actually oh you know what I think p.2d is like unhappy in this with I always forget that when I'm going out to the HDMI and capturing it it makes all sorts of things run and slightly wear it away all right this is good let's do this let's try this one okay to it in 3d that would be that's an awesome idea hello welcome to a coding challenge and this coding challenge I am going to make this actually already made it that's what I made it's called a Lisa Zhu table I got inspired by this by some things I'll talk about in a second this one was made with processing which is a Java based environment but I've also made a JavaScript version of it that you can watch in a separate video where I poured it so I hope you enjoy this coding challenge where I program this thing and and make some exciting cool weird wacky beautiful strange animated art with it okay goodbye see you soon all right that was like a weird introduction but I'm gonna stop now I'm gonna let Matt you do do what he thinks best come on okay let me just hit this okay that was bad it was pretty bad right make it slower that I'm not gonna use that one suggestion from chat what if you what what if do not use curves but just draw points and apply point nine transparent oh yeah that's a nice idea so there's so many I'm not worried about I love that suggestion thank you very much I'm gonna leave it to you the viewer to make it more beautiful or different or creative version of this I just wanted to get the functionality down pit errors occur when multiple Java programs are non multi threaded or open wonder if I had something else open somewhere or who knows okay so let's port this to JavaScript real quick and I'm gonna do it with the p5 editor great should I do the flip thing no I don't have the new flip all right let's not do the flip thing so much I think this can probably just sit on its own as like I totally said this is not a coding challenge it's not like part two of the coding challenge maybe it could be but it'll just be like a side for people who want to do this okay okay so you know I don't think there's a find and replace I just realized in the p5 web editor that's fine I'll do it manually it'll be fun okay let's do strokeweight one one one no I don't want to ask Siri give me a break one okay oh and that's going too fast so let's do this hello this is a short followup to my Lisa jus table coding challenge what if it screwed this video is just take the processing code paste it into the p5.js web editor and quickly make all the changes to have this run in JavaScript and let's see how long that takes I think I could do this pretty quickly and hopefully this will be useful to you to see how you might quickly port the sketch back and forth so let's start with just this main tab here I'm gonna do select all I'm gonna go into the p5 web editor and I'm gonna do paste so I've got all of the what is it the Java code in here now so all the let me just do that again hello this is a quick followup video from my Lisa jus coding challenge which you can see running here in a 400 by 400 window in processing what I'm gonna do in this video is take all this code copy into the p5 Jess web editor and convert it all the JavaScript can I do that just like five minutes and get it running and canvas in the browser so you can use that code if you want to make a browserbased version let's see so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm literally just gonna take all the coded copy paste it so I'm going to copy and then I'm gonna go over here I'm gonna do paste save so I'm you know and then I'm also going to create and right over here in this sidebar I can do like add file and I'm gonna make a file called curve J s and then I'm gonna go into curve J s come back to processing get my curve tab and go over here and paste that in so now I have both of those and then I also just want to go into index of HTML and make sure that both both JavaScript files are referenced so now I'm ready to start porting and I'm going to do this in the most manual way possible I could use regular expressions or clever find and replace or write some code to convert it but I'm gonna do it kind of one variable at a time so let let write all the data types this is just ah you know what ah I have an idea so I need to make a twodimensional array in JavaScript and it's a little bit awkward I remember I wrote a function once called make 2d array I search for make 2d array coding train hey look this might be useful to you please edit not be saying oh here we go this is somebody else's project minesweeper on code pen but look there's my make two date to the array function so I'm gonna close that and I'm gonna bring that into here just put it at the top so now I have this make a 2d array function I'm gonna change the order of the arguments columns rows columns hopefully that's hopefully that's not gonna kill the gonna do anything terrible so this is function this is create canvas ah one thing that I need to do if I doing any integer arithmetic I've got to use floor a floor because because I want to take I have to manually take off the decimal place and then this is now make 2d array rows columns this is let let you keep going down function let let let let let the let song the let song let let let let song the let song what what what what what you're watching somebody sing the Lord let over and over again and copy paste let over we're okay so I'm just gonna take this out for a second guys I don't want to know I don't know how this savings gonna work now ah class Oh classes what a lucky day but this needs to change the constructor and now this dot this dot never forget that this stop there's gonna be a lot of this dotting now and this so I gotta have this dot everywhere this stock this haha this time this dot this dot this dot this dot where did I miss it I don't need void I don't need void I don't need I don't need void oh I don't need float I don't need float also a ray list is not a thing we care about brackets just a plain old array and then I don't need void and then oh this won't work but I can say for let V of this dot path and then I feel like did I juice add somewhere yeah this has to be push clear it's clear a JavaScript function I guess we'll find out we save run okay make 2d array is not defined great job because I have capital letters there let's put that in here no no don't reload the site just do this P vector is not define ah okay so that's also another one that I forgot this has to be create vector and what create vector I think that should be good and now Oh current is not defined what is going on here oh this dot current I currents got the fine line 37 also this dot this dot there we go look at that Lisa two table in JavaScript let's see how it performs so by the way this this URL will be linked in the in the video let's try I forget how I do this but if I do I think if I say create canvas window with is that what it is mp5 window with window height that will give me the whole thing there we go and then if I do sketch or file save file one more share fullscreen here we go you know what this is running faster crazily I feel like this is running faster I should have just done this in JavaScript the whole time I had this idea looks it's less like weirdly pixelated or maybe it is so look at that that's beautiful view I mean I'm sure you can't see this because of because of the YouTube compression so let me just go back here and make this something much bigger like 120 and let me let me go view enter full screen and refresh refresh did I not save save refresh there we go and now here it is your JavaScript Lisa table so if you prefer to work in JavaScript you can take this code remix it in the p5 editor and some other projects share it with me this dot Lisa jus hashtag this not least add you and I look forward to seeing what you guys make okay goodbye seeing what you all make good bye oh wait a second it broke stop stop the presses stop the presses clear is not a function javascript array prototype let's look at what it is what there is is there I mean I could just set it to a new array but is there like some kind of just like clear it I mean splice all of it shift all of it reverse reduce all of it no that's reduce of something else okay I don't know what it is but I'm going to go over here and I know you can't see me right now I mean you can't see the code right now because I've done something horrible you know I have a new key command Oh No yeah this one okay you don't I don't not here anymore but you're looking at the code and I this is probably I should do all my videos no one wants to look at me where am I looking to do a reset curve reset where's reset this dot path equals and here I come back ha hi I'm back and now save and now refresh and here we go look so I'm gonna leave I'm gonna leave you at the end of this video watching this beautiful Lisa do pattern emerge okay I have new create vector uh where did I do that oh shoot well I think we're just gonna have to live with that I fixed it now though okay by the way if you want this code right now somebody could somebody who has privileges could post this link into the chat all right what time is it how we doing processing it can go away now wait hold on worse what is this left at I'm gonna leave the code as this I think okay f11 thank you close processing okay so we are moving on we're gonna take a short break it's not really a break but I just need a minute here to get reorganized microphone I'm gonna do this this star this star this star this star song never forget the Vista but somebody composed that song for me so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine to one thirty I think nine line apparently but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven six this is like Perlin noise performance part this is like cursing noise performance apart with early noise I might pick numbers like this Perley noise that it's early noise so this is Hurley noise that is Hurley noise this is Hurley noise that is Hurley no so this is Hurley noise that is her hurling her Perlin noise that is hurling boy this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley this is this is Hurley noise that it's Hurley so this is her Lee noise that is sorry I didn't realize the camera was off so I have 45 minutes and I am going to attempt hold on I'm gonna attempt to make up Mastodon bot I'm not probably won't get as far as I want to but let's see here we go so I've got a kind of crazy password here in my password manager no app I mean that's my big my email yeah nobody cares everybody can find that email anyway that's like but I'm just I'm gonna type in my password here that's not the login anyway so that's good what's the chance this works oh wait wait wait oh you probably just typed it in wrong sorry sorry everyone I have to get the setup here I'm not password changed Oh different email different email don't tell me I have to retype this sorry everyone get in there could this really be the I should've thought of this hope this works what I get for having like the craziest impossible password ever like 8 million characters because I never have to type it in except I don't have my passport manager installed on this laptop No okay shoot all right whoops where am i all right how am I gonna do this let me just make a let me make an insecure password and I'll change it again later see if that comes through reset password change password password it's too short too short okay login there we go okay here we go okay all right so mastodons what is Mastodon and then we need to go to bots in space okay and okay let me get back to slack all right Activity pub I think I will like to sign in to github and this is just going to require twofactor when welcome for okay alright okay please what is Mastodon it is exactly what I'm going about to talk about what is Mastodon is the topic I believe Mastodon is also sponsored by water actually smashing I'm probably espanish apparently I have some real sponsors to admit and one other place I need to go to is this YouTube channel called coding terrain if you stay all the way to they add into this live stream I'm gonna show you my new coding train store which you can find very easily without me showing it to you but I will show it to you okay playlists I'm looking for programming from A to Z Twitter very bad there we go okay okay all right I'm ready are you ready alright wow look at this Tobias right there hi YouTube okay hello welcome to a new playlist this is a replacement playlist for my session four of the programming from A to Z course session four is all about making a Twitter bot but guess what I give up on you Twitter goodbye Twitter I'm still using Twitter but it's I'll talk about this a lot of things about the Twitter API changed which make it not such a viable not to mention sort of like a highly toxic problematic place in general but a lot of things about the Twitter API have changed to make it problematic for your creative experimental wacky fun meaningful active what art bots so a social network platform that you might be interested in experiment with is something is called method on this is something that I am now experimenting with I'm going to start this over because I kind of like what am I talking about alright um you know I really don't and I was can I leave this here and it won't scroll okay I should be back streaming apologies I'm surprised that that didn't happen till now because there's an issue I think with this computer overheating and so yeah so I think I'm back I'm going to start recording I don't have the YouTube chat up and see if I can get that up really quickly I wouldn't be surprised if this happens again so apologies to everyone oh that's a good idea you just oh crap we're gonna see who's faster hold on I just wanna come on count to three there we go that'll do it ah yes that's what I want sorry I want to I want the local time line so let me see if I can let me see if I can do that since I'm hopefully not going to by accident where is that a home no but that's not the that's if you're logged in Alka that's if you're logged in what I want to do is I have to do it under administration and I apologize if anybody's name is coming up here that that they don't want to have up here site settings since them now ah there we go Oh shown own this is what I want okay okay that should do it Save Changes okay but now I think maybe I don't want okay here we go let's try this one more time hi so I don't know what's going on and either let me just that but what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to turn the volume on in that computer because it actually it does this weird hold on I have to but I have to turn my monitoring off which is not a big deal but actually I can leave that it's fine it it starts to beep and I've never heard this before it just starts to beep and I'm pretty sure it's overheating this is not this laptop this laptop all is do it is is not streaming anything I just have HDMI going out there's a trash can on the floor over there that takes all the cameras in and the laptop in and streams and recently it just dies I probably should upgrade the OS that's one thing I could try to do because I am still on a pretty old so maybe I'll do that after I shut down today maybe I can get some software to test if anybody has any ideas please let me know okay so let's the people in this flat channel are giving me a lot of helpful suggestions let's let me look at that after I stop streaming for tonight don't have the YouTube chat up right now cuz it's like it takes me so long good set everything up and it just freezes at to restart so I do have I do I'm able to look at the YouTube chat here and but let's see I definitely need to come up with a new solution so if I have to take a week off to like set up a new computer not a whole week off I just mean a streaming alright let's try to make let's try to get this mastodon bot thing going okay hello welcome to a new tutorial series this tutorial series is actually a replacement for session four from a program room from A to Z which is Twitter API and BOTS with nodejs you can just it's exactly the same session it's going to be the same session it's gonna be session for mastodons API and box with no chance mastodons what is mastodons why using Macedon well a couple reasons number one is Twitter recently changed their API rules how it works it's much harder to sign up for new accounts that are bought accounts they've also removed a feature which was the streaming API which Macedon does have so I'll come back and show you what that exactly is but allows you to basically have a connection to the service and continually listen for different events and so you could still hopefully maybe if you want try to make Twitter bots but I am giving up on it I think there's a lot of problems with the Twitter platform as a whole and if what I'm interested I'm interested in its community and experimental weird crazy avantgarde art image poetry nonsense BOTS mmm Mastodon is a pretty good place to do it so first so what is Mastodon so first of all Mastodon is an open source project if you want to find out about it just go to join Mastodon org and also the toot sweet organization on github the Mastodon project so it's an open source project II and sorry I'm looking for the thing that I wanted to say it's an open source project there was like a nice little why I'm at two you're gonna hit this out yeah okay it's an opensource project you can read right here find friends discover new ones publish anything you want links pictures text video on a platform that is community owned and adfree but the really the thing that's really exciting and interesting to me about Mastodon is that it is a decentralized social network what does that mean so in mind you I am NOT an expert in this I will link to a really nice YouTube video from master the Mastodon project what is Mastodon you could go and watch that if you want so let me give you my kind of take on this so let's say you sign up for an account from Twitter and you are on your own computer your device your phone or whatever you're using it as a Twitter client you are connecting to the Twitter server you are sending messages there you are reading messages back all of your data is stored here on the Twitter service this is a centralized service and the web more and more of these days is moving moves into the web originally if you okay I think I am back so I am gonna actually gonna give up on this live stream right now for now you know I have 15 minutes before I have to be downstairs for a meeting but I'm so I'm gonna use that time to see if I can upgrade this machine I got some good suggestions of oh yeah oh and this is the great idea Cody's made sponsored by water I'm just going to go ahead and pour water on the computer them not those computer the computer over there I'm gonna see if I can fix up this machine just by upgrading it and installing some stuff to manage the fan and then I will try to come back later today or Monday to do the mastodons stuff but you know even if I even if it wasn't gonna freeze again in 10 minutes I'm not gonna get much done in 10 minutes so at least to show you since if anybody's curious and a feedback is welcome they do haven't so let me just if this freezes again by the way I'm not gonna come back I'm just gonna add mystery so if the cuts off it cuts off and I'll talk until it cuts off so if you want to well I was gonna just talk a little bit about Mastodon but I guess I'll save that uh I guess I'll mention the store so if I go to teespring dotcom slash stores slash coding train I'm gonna show you this is fun I'm gonna show you all this new stuff thank you Jason hey Glen hey Glen is the did illustrative designer who has done a ton of stuff for the coding great look there we go coding train and so we have a whole lot of new stuff these coding is magical shirts with all those people have requested the I'll refactor that later sure it's different characters and the this dot one is somewhere in here well maybe I remember it was on that first page there yeah I never forget that this dot there it is the new coding train bouncy logo and some other stuff of course this one so anyway poke around feedback is welcome if you see stuff that's not there that could be there stuff doesn't work does it make sense thank you for your support please don't feel obligated to get anything the I will be sending these out as gifts and things to people subscribe to patreon and that sort of stuff ok so I wanted to show that on theory let's see how this works in theory this is integrated with YouTube this is totally gonna course it's not freezing freezing now right if I go here oh no no that's next live now if I go here and it's find there's no Mastodon BOTS in this and I scrolled down yeah there we go so that doesn't work look at that so these are expensive I'm definitely this is the one that I want to get I will be buying this one for me for myself probably okay so thank you for being patient and dealing with the fact that this is like not working I'm looking at the YouTube chat now so I'm gonna figure I got to make this content cuz it's for my class wouldn't discord BOTS and their WebSockets be more interesting I don't know about more interesting definitely interesting I have to admit that I am NOT a discord user I've been tempted to set it up in lieu of slack as the member community for the coding train but I just haven't had the time to explore it and then once I suggested it do like no no don't bother with that so so yeah so thank you I mean I would happily stay on while I try to upgrade this computer and install stuff but I don't think that's gonna be that interesting and then also have to restart the computer which will shut the stream down so at least we got that at least we got the Lisa 2 coding challenge in I feel kind of good about that and the that will get edited and pushed out next week sometime and if I can manage I don't know if I can manage to make it back today but I really got to do that Mastodon stuff so maybe I can get an extra hour or two in on Monday so just stay tuned stay tuned just stay tuned sorry I was looking at the chat stay tuned if you want it like when a might the places I was on Twitter you could follow me on Twitter no stay tuned I will announce the best way to find out when I'm going to livestream again is just to take the home check the home page on YouTube because it will show you like there's definitely going to be one next Friday text generation with tensorflow ml5 and the spell platform with Nabil Hussain so we're gonna do an LS TM neural network model with a guest next Friday and so as soon as I figure out if I can come back later or on Monday I'll post also another one here in the upcoming live streams ok that's it but uh what a sad I will refactor this computer later what a sad ending to today's live stream but I am going to have to go and see what I could do about this computer even if I could just come back and just like explain what Mastodon is and make one little simple bot it'll be worth it to me if I can manage to do that in a little while so we'll see if I come back today it would be between like 6 p.m. and 7 p.m. Eastern Time so and now of course it's not crashing now which is ridiculous frustrating so but let's see I know about you've got to go to sleep go to sleep don't wait up for me because I am NOT this is not a reliable thing thank you everybody thank you for tuning in and I will see you next time bye everybody I forgot I have to press the stop streaming button where do I do that they lost that page I'm going I'm going don't make me pull this car over um customize channel no that's not what I want don't customize the channel ah geez Louise okay look there I am uh edit video where do I go here uh here we go edit video okay and live I like control room let's try this one more time thank you everybody for watching today's livestream I will see you next time on the coding train goodbye everybody
