00:01 - so this is really a bonus video I just
00:03 - want to do something weird with dom
00:05 - manipulation that I'm kind of going to
00:06 - just make up on the Fly although I did
00:08 - make an example like this a couple weeks
00:09 - ago I looked at it since then so
00:11 - hopefully this is going to work out and
00:13 - what I want to show you how to do is to
00:14 - take interface elements that normally
00:16 - you would ask the user to manipulate
00:18 - like move a slider or type some text
00:21 - into a text input box and I want to show
00:23 - you how to just control those pro
00:25 - control those things programmatically as
00:27 - if they're like there's a zombie
00:29 - controlling your computer so first of
00:31 - all I have a P5 sketch here I have the
00:34 - P5 editor this is sort of like a bit of
00:36 - a standalone video so some of you might
00:37 - be coming to it from not having seen P5
00:40 - before go to P5 js. org download the
00:42 - editor look at the reference you can use
00:44 - that for this uh quick little project so
00:46 - let's give it let's hit this button we
00:48 - can see there's absolutely nothing
00:50 - appearing in the browser because I
00:51 - haven't added anything now let's create
00:54 - a
00:55 - variable called
00:58 - slider and I'm going to say slid equals
01:00 - create slider and remember when you
01:02 - create a slider you need a minimum and a
01:05 - maximum and a starting range I don't
01:07 - really it doesn't really matter so much
01:09 - so I'm in this case so I'm going to
01:10 - create a slider with minimum goes from
01:12 - zero maximum goes to 100 and it starts
01:15 - at 50 uh it's very loud outside so I'm
01:18 - going to close the window and I'm back
01:20 - you can see the slider is there and now
01:22 - I can do what anyone would normally do
01:24 - with a slider I can slide it back and
01:25 - forth I could use the slider to control
01:27 - myself watch
01:31 - nobody cares that I'm doing this but it
01:32 - amused me for a second okay so uh that's
01:35 - normally what you do and you would tie
01:37 - the slider to an alpha value or some
01:39 - parameter in a flocking system whatever
01:41 - kind of creative coding thing you're
01:43 - doing today but what if you wanted to
01:45 - actually set the value of that slider so
01:48 - one thing you can actually do is okay so
01:51 - if you want to get sorry if you want to
01:52 - get the value of the slider you say
01:54 - slider. value and so let me make it
01:57 - between 0 and 255 and I could see now I
02:00 - have no canvas let me create the canvas
02:04 - just so it's there and you can see now
02:06 - that the canvas is there and as I move
02:08 - the slider it's changing the background
02:10 - color this is again what you might
02:12 - normally do now another way I could
02:17 - change the value of the slider is
02:19 - actually to just call the value function
02:21 - but give it an argument so the argument
02:24 - I'm going to give it is the number right
02:27 - now 151
02:30 - so you can see that now the slider even
02:32 - though it started at 50 as soon as draw
02:35 - executed I set its value to 151 well
02:38 - draw is animating looping over and over
02:40 - again what if I made that sum variable
02:43 - like for example varx equal 151 and
02:47 - slider. value x and x equal x plus some
02:50 - random amount between like5 and 5 now
02:54 - let me run that and you can see look the
02:57 - slider is moving on its own I have my
02:59 - first zombie slider there it is just
03:02 - moving around I don't ever have to
03:04 - operate the computer again it's just
03:05 - going to do it for me great so uh but
03:09 - let's go a little bit further with this
03:10 - first of all let's use something called
03:12 - a sine wave I would uh I'll link below
03:15 - to some other video where I talk about
03:17 - sine waves I'm saying I'm going to link
03:19 - below I better do it right in the
03:20 - comments if I didn't do it and I'll add
03:22 - it but let's use a sign wave so let's
03:24 - say instead that x equals the value
03:30 - varx equals the value of the of a sign
03:34 - of something sign of some angle so now I
03:37 - need a variable called
03:39 - angle and I need it equal to zero now I
03:43 - might as well take just a brief moment
03:45 - to come over here to this whiteboard
03:47 - which I said I wasn't going to need and
03:49 - talk about what you get out of the sign
03:51 - function I said I was going to link to
03:52 - another video but I feel obligated to
03:53 - just offer a quick explanation if you've
03:55 - ever seen a drawing of the sign function
03:58 - Cera show this is not going well the
04:00 - camera shut off ever seen a drawing of
04:01 - the sign function it looks something
04:03 - like
04:04 - this uh the range uh the range goes from
04:09 - between one to negative 1 I should start
04:13 - over but I'm not going to um the range
04:16 - goes between one and negative 1 the x
04:18 - axis being this angle that's moving
04:20 - through time in a way that you can think
04:22 - so depending on what the value of the
04:24 - angle is I'm going to get between one
04:26 - and negative 1 so here that was that was
04:29 - like the worst explanation ever just go
04:31 - to the thing that's that explains the
04:33 - sign function you haven't looked at it
04:34 - before um so what I want to do is get
04:37 - this the sign of some
04:40 - angle and if I do that it's stuck there
04:43 - at the bottom right the result of the
04:45 - sign function is always a value between
04:48 - negative - 1 and one now there happens
04:50 - to be another function in P5 called the
04:52 - map function and I definitely have a
04:54 - video that's only about the map function
04:55 - I'll also link to that below but what I
04:57 - can do with the map function is I can
04:59 - say hey the sign function goes between
05:02 - -1 and 1 that's the range of the sign
05:04 - function but the range of my slider is
05:06 - between 0 and 255 or 0 and 100 whatever
05:09 - it was between Z and 255 so map the
05:14 - result of the sign function which is
05:15 - somewhere between negative 1 and one to
05:17 - the between 0 and 255 so now I'm going
05:20 - to do that oh unexpected
05:23 - number line 12 I don't I don't oh
05:27 - because uh I forgot a comma here there
05:29 - we go
05:30 - and you can see ah so s of zero happens
05:34 - to be the value zero which then happens
05:37 - to be halfway between negative one and
05:38 - one which is halfway which gets mapped
05:40 - to 127 about and you can see it's now in
05:42 - the middle now what if I took that angle
05:46 - and incremented it over time I could
05:48 - maybe get the slider to oscillate
05:51 - nicely angle plus equals 0.01 now the
05:55 - angle the unit of measurement is in
05:57 - radians and in that other set of videos
05:59 - that I'm looking too there'll be an
06:00 - explanation of
06:01 - that and you can see look at that this
06:04 - nice little the slider is moving nicely
06:06 - slowly and it's coming to the end and it
06:07 - eases off and you know we could maybe
06:10 - make that move a little bit faster by
06:12 - incrementing the angle a bit more each
06:14 - frame and now I've got this slider
06:16 - that's like oscillating automatically
06:18 - it's kind of like
06:20 - dancing I'm trying to do it with it but
06:22 - I can't so this was fun and all well and
06:25 - good but let's do something more with
06:27 - this first of all forget about this
06:28 - silly canvas thing
06:30 - that was nice to be able to see that the
06:31 - slider is still actively controlling the
06:33 - canvas but forget about that forget
06:36 - about background What If instead I make
06:39 - an array of
06:41 - Sliders and I were to say for VAR I
06:45 - equals 0 I is less than 10 I ++ and I'm
06:48 - going to make all those
06:51 - Sliders in an array so make all those
06:54 - Sliders in an array and then let's do
06:57 - exactly the same thing down here let's
07:00 - set all of their
07:04 - values to the value of this sign
07:07 - function and here we go and I run it
07:10 - look at that all of the sliders are now
07:12 - oscillating back and forth isn't that
07:14 - lovely and then I don't know 10 didn't
07:17 - seem like very many let's make 50 of
07:19 - them o oh and I I I hardcoded that I
07:22 - should really say sliders do length
07:25 - let's make 50 of them you see all them
07:26 - moving I don't know I'm just going crazy
07:28 - let's make a 100 of them I want to f
07:29 - fill the page with sliders you can see
07:31 - now I've got 100 sliders dancing back
07:33 - and
07:34 - forth now interestingly
07:37 - enough if I'm working with a sine
07:41 - wave and I have one thing
07:45 - oscillating back and forth and I have
07:48 - another thing oscillating back and forth
07:50 - and I have another thing oscillating
07:51 - back and forth what if each one of those
07:53 - was just a little bit behind the other
07:55 - one right so when this one is over here
07:57 - this one is over here and then this
07:59 - one's over over here and then this one
08:00 - gets to the end and comes back and then
08:02 - this one gets the end there's just a
08:03 - little bit of offset so they're kind of
08:04 - like dancing with each other in a way
08:06 - and we could we could play some music
08:07 - and dance the slide dance the night away
08:09 - with the sliders that's what I do by the
08:12 - way I have no social life so I go home
08:13 - and I dance the night away with
08:16 - sliders think about that for a minute
08:18 - why don't you then donate there's no
08:20 - donate button but I don't know what you
08:22 - would donate to to the cause of sad
08:24 - dancing slider people but the point is
08:27 - what if I could get each one slightly
08:29 - offset from the other
08:30 - one maybe I could have another
08:36 - variable uh I could say
08:39 - offset equals
08:41 - Zer angle plus
08:45 - offset and then
08:47 - offset plus equals
08:50 - 0.023 45 making that number up doesn't
08:53 - really matter the two five the point is
08:57 - I want each one of those to oscillate
08:59 - based on that angle but one of them
09:01 - should be 025 ahead and the other one
09:03 - should be 05 ahead and the other one
09:06 - should be
09:06 - 0.75 ahead I think I'm doing the math
09:09 - right let's just see if that
09:11 - works there we go dance save the night
09:13 - away with the so you can see here I'm
09:15 - just zoma controlling these sliders
09:18 - they're all slightly offset from each
09:20 - other I could play around like what if I
09:21 - really make them offset from each other
09:23 - uh whoa now I've got this crazy pattern
09:26 - here um where all the sliders I could
09:28 - arrange them in a different different
09:29 - way I could have them like paint make a
09:31 - little picture I could all use them to
09:32 - control things I could style them so
09:35 - there's lots of possibilities the point
09:37 - that I making this video is to
09:39 - say I don't know anything about the web
09:41 - or design or how to make anything look
09:43 - right or do anything
09:45 - practical
09:47 - but uh so I'm sometimes trying weird
09:49 - things out and things happen but the the
09:51 - point of what I'm saying that's not the
09:52 - point of what I'm saying the point of
09:53 - what I'm saying is the browser could be
09:56 - an experimental canvas for you what
09:58 - kinds of things exist exist as elements
10:00 - in the browser that we use every day in
10:02 - these standard ways and what might
10:04 - happen if you subvert those standard
10:05 - ways and do all sort and do different
10:08 - things with them that might not be
10:09 - expected this is a very simplistic
10:11 - almost sort of like first approach to
10:13 - that but it's something that's worth
10:15 - looking into uh and playing around with
10:17 - I I want to keep doing stuff to it but
10:19 - I'm like stopping myself the other thing
10:21 - that you might think about doing is
10:23 - having uh you know a text input box and
10:26 - how you can use the value function to
10:28 - set what's in the tech how might you
10:29 - make it appear that someone's typing
10:31 - into that text input box um without
10:34 - there being a person there and suddenly
10:35 - hitting a submit button that that you
10:37 - know so how might you make a page feel
10:39 - as if it's interacting with itself um
10:42 - and you know you could also do something
10:43 - when you move one slider oh we should
10:45 - try this okay so let's stop this okay
10:49 - what are we stop the video now and go do
10:51 - some go outside and play Frisbee or
10:53 - whatever and could socialize with your
10:54 - friends or have a nice cup of chamomile
10:57 - tea to relax meditate all these things
10:58 - are much more important than what I'm
10:59 - going to do next but if you're still
11:01 - here I'm going to do one more thing with
11:03 - this what if I have them all move when I
11:06 - move one of them slightly offset from
11:08 - the one I'm moving I don't even know if
11:09 - that would work I shouldn't try to do
11:11 - this right now this was going so well
11:13 - I'll just add this one so for
11:15 - example
11:17 - uh let's say what I want to do is handle
11:21 - just the first
11:22 - slider the input event first uh uh
11:28 - adjust SL ERS so if you remember the
11:31 - input event is an event that gets fired
11:34 - any time there is a change to the value
11:37 - of a Dom element such as a slider so I'm
11:41 - I don't need
11:43 - this uh draw function anymore I'm going
11:45 - to rename this to adjust
11:48 - sliders and I'm going to say start from
11:51 - Slider
11:52 - one sliders I value sliders index z. I'm
11:57 - making this simple so here here what
11:59 - I've done now is I've said anytime you
12:02 - change sliders zero the first element in
12:04 - the array call this function adjust
12:07 - sliders Loop through all the other ones
12:08 - starting with one and change their value
12:11 - to the value of the first one so here we
12:14 - go and I can say any time I move this
12:16 - they all move but so I'm going to leave
12:18 - that at that you could like take this
12:20 - what if when you move they all kind of
12:22 - like move sporadically but kind of like
12:25 - with that one what if when you move it
12:26 - causes them to sort of Ripple first one
12:28 - moves then the next one moves then the
12:30 - next one moves and you get this kind of
12:31 - like dancing this is Dancing with
12:33 - sliders so how could you if you actually
12:36 - interact with one and it makes the other
12:37 - ones do something uh anyway uh I'm I'm
12:40 - kind of off the beaten path here think
12:42 - of your own write your in the comments
12:44 - to wherever you're seeing this video
12:45 - write some other ideas of things that
12:47 - might be more interesting than what I'm
12:48 - thinking of I would love to make some
12:49 - more examples in this direction or maybe
12:51 - share things that you've made in that
12:52 - way so um this
12:54 - concludes a many many many videos that
12:57 - I've made about Dom manipulation HTML
13:00 - and CSS with the P5 GS Library I'm sure
13:03 - I missed a lot of things there are a
13:05 - bunch of these videos where things
13:06 - didn't work or I was like kind of
13:07 - confused send me your feedback write
13:09 - your letters of Complaint to Brian
13:11 - Williams I mean uh me um uh here at ITP
13:16 - uh the address is 721
13:19 - Broadway I think that's okay to mention
13:21 - it's on the internet um uh you can send
13:24 - something in the mail I like things in
13:25 - the mail um and uh I will uh the next
13:29 - section of videos that I'm hoping to
13:30 - make possibly tomorrow but definitely
13:32 - next week if not tomorrow is about
13:34 - working with data so how do you work
13:36 - with a data file that you might load
13:38 - that has information in it how do you
13:40 - connect to an API like a weather API or
13:42 - the New York Times API or this wonderful
13:43 - API called the wordnik API that's one of
13:45 - my favorite apis so that's what I'm
13:47 - going to look at in the next set of
13:48 - videos that I get to uh next so thanks
13:51 - for tuning
13:52 - in which sounds ridiculous and um I
13:56 - don't know I'm stop now thanks okay okay

Cleaned transcript:

so this is really a bonus video I just want to do something weird with dom manipulation that I'm kind of going to just make up on the Fly although I did make an example like this a couple weeks ago I looked at it since then so hopefully this is going to work out and what I want to show you how to do is to take interface elements that normally you would ask the user to manipulate like move a slider or type some text into a text input box and I want to show you how to just control those pro control those things programmatically as if they're like there's a zombie controlling your computer so first of all I have a P5 sketch here I have the P5 editor this is sort of like a bit of a standalone video so some of you might be coming to it from not having seen P5 before go to P5 js. org download the editor look at the reference you can use that for this uh quick little project so let's give it let's hit this button we can see there's absolutely nothing appearing in the browser because I haven't added anything now let's create a variable called slider and I'm going to say slid equals create slider and remember when you create a slider you need a minimum and a maximum and a starting range I don't really it doesn't really matter so much so I'm in this case so I'm going to create a slider with minimum goes from zero maximum goes to 100 and it starts at 50 uh it's very loud outside so I'm going to close the window and I'm back you can see the slider is there and now I can do what anyone would normally do with a slider I can slide it back and forth I could use the slider to control myself watch nobody cares that I'm doing this but it amused me for a second okay so uh that's normally what you do and you would tie the slider to an alpha value or some parameter in a flocking system whatever kind of creative coding thing you're doing today but what if you wanted to actually set the value of that slider so one thing you can actually do is okay so if you want to get sorry if you want to get the value of the slider you say slider. value and so let me make it between 0 and 255 and I could see now I have no canvas let me create the canvas just so it's there and you can see now that the canvas is there and as I move the slider it's changing the background color this is again what you might normally do now another way I could change the value of the slider is actually to just call the value function but give it an argument so the argument I'm going to give it is the number right now 151 so you can see that now the slider even though it started at 50 as soon as draw executed I set its value to 151 well draw is animating looping over and over again what if I made that sum variable like for example varx equal 151 and slider. value x and x equal x plus some random amount between like5 and 5 now let me run that and you can see look the slider is moving on its own I have my first zombie slider there it is just moving around I don't ever have to operate the computer again it's just going to do it for me great so uh but let's go a little bit further with this first of all let's use something called a sine wave I would uh I'll link below to some other video where I talk about sine waves I'm saying I'm going to link below I better do it right in the comments if I didn't do it and I'll add it but let's use a sign wave so let's say instead that x equals the value varx equals the value of the of a sign of something sign of some angle so now I need a variable called angle and I need it equal to zero now I might as well take just a brief moment to come over here to this whiteboard which I said I wasn't going to need and talk about what you get out of the sign function I said I was going to link to another video but I feel obligated to just offer a quick explanation if you've ever seen a drawing of the sign function Cera show this is not going well the camera shut off ever seen a drawing of the sign function it looks something like this uh the range uh the range goes from between one to negative 1 I should start over but I'm not going to um the range goes between one and negative 1 the x axis being this angle that's moving through time in a way that you can think so depending on what the value of the angle is I'm going to get between one and negative 1 so here that was that was like the worst explanation ever just go to the thing that's that explains the sign function you haven't looked at it before um so what I want to do is get this the sign of some angle and if I do that it's stuck there at the bottom right the result of the sign function is always a value between negative 1 and one now there happens to be another function in P5 called the map function and I definitely have a video that's only about the map function I'll also link to that below but what I can do with the map function is I can say hey the sign function goes between 1 and 1 that's the range of the sign function but the range of my slider is between 0 and 255 or 0 and 100 whatever it was between Z and 255 so map the result of the sign function which is somewhere between negative 1 and one to the between 0 and 255 so now I'm going to do that oh unexpected number line 12 I don't I don't oh because uh I forgot a comma here there we go and you can see ah so s of zero happens to be the value zero which then happens to be halfway between negative one and one which is halfway which gets mapped to 127 about and you can see it's now in the middle now what if I took that angle and incremented it over time I could maybe get the slider to oscillate nicely angle plus equals 0.01 now the angle the unit of measurement is in radians and in that other set of videos that I'm looking too there'll be an explanation of that and you can see look at that this nice little the slider is moving nicely slowly and it's coming to the end and it eases off and you know we could maybe make that move a little bit faster by incrementing the angle a bit more each frame and now I've got this slider that's like oscillating automatically it's kind of like dancing I'm trying to do it with it but I can't so this was fun and all well and good but let's do something more with this first of all forget about this silly canvas thing that was nice to be able to see that the slider is still actively controlling the canvas but forget about that forget about background What If instead I make an array of Sliders and I were to say for VAR I equals 0 I is less than 10 I ++ and I'm going to make all those Sliders in an array so make all those Sliders in an array and then let's do exactly the same thing down here let's set all of their values to the value of this sign function and here we go and I run it look at that all of the sliders are now oscillating back and forth isn't that lovely and then I don't know 10 didn't seem like very many let's make 50 of them o oh and I I I hardcoded that I should really say sliders do length let's make 50 of them you see all them moving I don't know I'm just going crazy let's make a 100 of them I want to f fill the page with sliders you can see now I've got 100 sliders dancing back and forth now interestingly enough if I'm working with a sine wave and I have one thing oscillating back and forth and I have another thing oscillating back and forth and I have another thing oscillating back and forth what if each one of those was just a little bit behind the other one right so when this one is over here this one is over here and then this one's over over here and then this one gets to the end and comes back and then this one gets the end there's just a little bit of offset so they're kind of like dancing with each other in a way and we could we could play some music and dance the slide dance the night away with the sliders that's what I do by the way I have no social life so I go home and I dance the night away with sliders think about that for a minute why don't you then donate there's no donate button but I don't know what you would donate to to the cause of sad dancing slider people but the point is what if I could get each one slightly offset from the other one maybe I could have another variable uh I could say offset equals Zer angle plus offset and then offset plus equals 0.023 45 making that number up doesn't really matter the two five the point is I want each one of those to oscillate based on that angle but one of them should be 025 ahead and the other one should be 05 ahead and the other one should be 0.75 ahead I think I'm doing the math right let's just see if that works there we go dance save the night away with the so you can see here I'm just zoma controlling these sliders they're all slightly offset from each other I could play around like what if I really make them offset from each other uh whoa now I've got this crazy pattern here um where all the sliders I could arrange them in a different different way I could have them like paint make a little picture I could all use them to control things I could style them so there's lots of possibilities the point that I making this video is to say I don't know anything about the web or design or how to make anything look right or do anything practical but uh so I'm sometimes trying weird things out and things happen but the the point of what I'm saying that's not the point of what I'm saying the point of what I'm saying is the browser could be an experimental canvas for you what kinds of things exist exist as elements in the browser that we use every day in these standard ways and what might happen if you subvert those standard ways and do all sort and do different things with them that might not be expected this is a very simplistic almost sort of like first approach to that but it's something that's worth looking into uh and playing around with I I want to keep doing stuff to it but I'm like stopping myself the other thing that you might think about doing is having uh you know a text input box and how you can use the value function to set what's in the tech how might you make it appear that someone's typing into that text input box um without there being a person there and suddenly hitting a submit button that that you know so how might you make a page feel as if it's interacting with itself um and you know you could also do something when you move one slider oh we should try this okay so let's stop this okay what are we stop the video now and go do some go outside and play Frisbee or whatever and could socialize with your friends or have a nice cup of chamomile tea to relax meditate all these things are much more important than what I'm going to do next but if you're still here I'm going to do one more thing with this what if I have them all move when I move one of them slightly offset from the one I'm moving I don't even know if that would work I shouldn't try to do this right now this was going so well I'll just add this one so for example uh let's say what I want to do is handle just the first slider the input event first uh uh adjust SL ERS so if you remember the input event is an event that gets fired any time there is a change to the value of a Dom element such as a slider so I'm I don't need this uh draw function anymore I'm going to rename this to adjust sliders and I'm going to say start from Slider one sliders I value sliders index z. I'm making this simple so here here what I've done now is I've said anytime you change sliders zero the first element in the array call this function adjust sliders Loop through all the other ones starting with one and change their value to the value of the first one so here we go and I can say any time I move this they all move but so I'm going to leave that at that you could like take this what if when you move they all kind of like move sporadically but kind of like with that one what if when you move it causes them to sort of Ripple first one moves then the next one moves then the next one moves and you get this kind of like dancing this is Dancing with sliders so how could you if you actually interact with one and it makes the other ones do something uh anyway uh I'm I'm kind of off the beaten path here think of your own write your in the comments to wherever you're seeing this video write some other ideas of things that might be more interesting than what I'm thinking of I would love to make some more examples in this direction or maybe share things that you've made in that way so um this concludes a many many many videos that I've made about Dom manipulation HTML and CSS with the P5 GS Library I'm sure I missed a lot of things there are a bunch of these videos where things didn't work or I was like kind of confused send me your feedback write your letters of Complaint to Brian Williams I mean uh me um uh here at ITP uh the address is 721 Broadway I think that's okay to mention it's on the internet um uh you can send something in the mail I like things in the mail um and uh I will uh the next section of videos that I'm hoping to make possibly tomorrow but definitely next week if not tomorrow is about working with data so how do you work with a data file that you might load that has information in it how do you connect to an API like a weather API or the New York Times API or this wonderful API called the wordnik API that's one of my favorite apis so that's what I'm going to look at in the next set of videos that I get to uh next so thanks for tuning in which sounds ridiculous and um I don't know I'm stop now thanks okay okay
