00:06 - So this is a learning playlist.
00:07 - What I've done here is taken a
whole set of existing videos--
00:10 - about 19 of them--
00:11 - and compiled them
and organized them,
00:13 - sequenced them, into
these six sections.
00:15 - So if you already know how to
program in JavaScript-- if you
00:18 - don't, I've got a
different learning playlist
00:20 - for you called Code, an
Introduction to programming
00:22 - with P5.JS.
00:22 - But if you've
already watched that
00:24 - or know the basics
in JavaScript,
00:25 - have heard the terms
machine learning, maybe,
00:27 - a little intimidated by them--
this seems a little scary,
00:30 - what could you
possibly do with that?
00:31 - Then my hope is
that these videos
00:34 - will help you get a high-level
understanding of core concepts
00:37 - in machine learning
and be inspired
00:39 - to apply some of those
concepts in creative ways
00:41 - in the browser with JavaScript
and the P5JS library.
00:45 - So I've got a whole
set of sections here.
00:47 - I'm going to start with
pre-trained models.
00:49 - What's the pre-trained model?
00:50 - I will explain that.
00:51 - To do image classification
in the browser--
00:54 - what's in an image,
I'll look at something
00:56 - called transfer
learning, which allows
00:57 - you to train an image
classifier with your own images.
01:02 - Different other algorithms,
I'll use something
01:04 - called teachable machine, which
is an interface from Google
01:06 - creative lab that allows you
to train your machine learning
01:09 - model.
01:09 - And then I will
even show you how
01:11 - to train a neural network from
scratch with your own data
01:15 - that you've collected.
01:16 - And we'll to do some stuff
with audio and sound.
01:18 - So there's a variety
of things in here.
01:20 - I hope you'll enjoy it.
01:21 - All aboard.
01:22 - Come with me on
the coding train.
01:24 - A Beginner's Guide to Machine
Learning in JavaScript.
01:27 - Thanks so much
and I look forward
01:28 - to seeing what you create.

Hello and welcome to A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning in JavaScript on [TRAIN HORN SOUNDS] The Coding Train. So this is a learning playlist. What I've done here is taken a whole set of existing videos about 19 of them and compiled them and organized them, sequenced them, into these six sections. So if you already know how to program in JavaScript if you don't, I've got a different learning playlist for you called Code, an Introduction to programming with P5.JS. But if you've already watched that or know the basics in JavaScript, have heard the terms machine learning, maybe, a little intimidated by them this seems a little scary, what could you possibly do with that? Then my hope is that these videos will help you get a highlevel understanding of core concepts in machine learning and be inspired to apply some of those concepts in creative ways in the browser with JavaScript and the P5JS library. So I've got a whole set of sections here. I'm going to start with pretrained models. What's the pretrained model? I will explain that. To do image classification in the browser what's in an image, I'll look at something called transfer learning, which allows you to train an image classifier with your own images. Different other algorithms, I'll use something called teachable machine, which is an interface from Google creative lab that allows you to train your machine learning model. And then I will even show you how to train a neural network from scratch with your own data that you've collected. And we'll to do some stuff with audio and sound. So there's a variety of things in here. I hope you'll enjoy it. All aboard. Come with me on the coding train. A Beginner's Guide to Machine Learning in JavaScript. Thanks so much and I look forward to seeing what you create.
