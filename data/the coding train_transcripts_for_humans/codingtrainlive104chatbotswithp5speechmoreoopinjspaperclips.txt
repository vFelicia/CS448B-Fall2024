00:00 - [Music]
00:00 - hello good afternoon and welcome to the
00:06 - coding train a weekly internet thing
00:12 - with me your host Daniel Shipman in a
00:17 - room by myself with some lights and some
00:20 - computers and a door and a camera and a
00:24 - monitor to see that I'm actually on and
00:26 - that perhaps for once I'm starting this
00:29 - livestream without my microphone muted
00:31 - is that possible could it possibly be
00:33 - true I'm looking at the slack channel
00:36 - there is a live YouTube chat which I
00:38 - find a bit hard to follow though I will
00:40 - attempt to follow it there's also a
00:42 - slack channel which is for patrons of
00:44 - the coding train if you would like to
00:46 - join that it's a crowdfunding site
00:49 - called patreon patreon comm slash coding
00:52 - trains something like that so here's the
00:54 - thing actually I feel like I'm saying
00:57 - this all the time
00:58 - but if you notice there's some like bags
01:02 - under my eyes or if I see what sorts
01:05 - things like hair is a bit more unkempt
01:09 - I'm not sure who to blame here exactly
01:12 - but I'm kind of addicted I've got it
01:15 - running over here on this this like
01:17 - invisible laptop thing whew what's this
01:19 - weird like an invisible laptop thing
01:21 - here but there's and I'm rockin don't
01:23 - worry as much as I might have suggested
01:25 - at one point I was going to livestream
01:30 - me just playing this game about paper
01:33 - clips that would have to talk about I'm
01:35 - not going to do that I'm just at least
01:37 - gonna start I'm just gonna like open up
01:39 - a window everything's gonna be fine I'm
01:41 - not gonna get sucked into the vortex of
01:43 - the paper clips
01:44 - Frank Lance Franklin's the director of
01:47 - the NYU game MFA and BFA program here
01:52 - and University of Tisch School of the
01:53 - Arts created a game which I guess is
01:56 - called the clicker it's a clicker and
01:59 - let's see where it lets see paper clip
02:00 - what happens if I just Google paper
02:02 - clips now what do I find
02:05 - a game about making paper clips blah
02:07 - blah blah oh this is - my my really just
02:09 - jumping on the bandwagon Frank
02:13 - and so what I would like to go is to
02:17 - let's go find this game we find okay
02:23 - okay here we go okay so the green paper
02:26 - is visible ah I know the magic the magic
02:30 - I meant to bring like a whole bucket of
02:33 - paper clips here with me and I could
02:35 - just juggle them or put them in my hair
02:38 - just play with them but instead I'm
02:40 - gonna go here I'm gonna increase the
02:44 - size and I'm going to make my first
02:49 - paper clip I would like to tell them to
02:56 - tell me if this game ever ends
02:59 - Joe just like to know if there's an end
03:01 - because right now I am working on on
03:05 - this other computer over here if you
03:06 - just will bear with me for a second
03:08 - I've had this I've got a dedicated
03:10 - machine for making paper clips I'm at
03:15 - what is that except iliyan 1.8
03:18 - sextillion I'm at 1.8 sextillion oh okay
03:21 - oh but I need to have I should be able
03:25 - to get the self-correcting supply chain
03:27 - why can't why is it the self-correcting
03:29 - supply chain why hasn't it enabled
03:31 - itself yet by the way I know there's a
03:33 - way I could open up the JavaScript
03:34 - console and like to change all the HTML
03:37 - and I could just make as many paper
03:38 - clips as I want but no I I'm I believe
03:45 - in the purity of the paper clip machine
03:47 - and so I'm gonna make a second one so
03:53 - I'm gonna go away in a second I'm what
03:56 - I'm wondering is I've got a little
03:57 - competition here a little coding train
03:59 - Friday afternoon coding show with a
04:02 - person who didn't sleep nearly enough
04:04 - you know not entirely just because of
04:06 - the paper clips probably lost an hour if
04:08 - I'm being honest - the paper clips I did
04:11 - wake up early to make some paper clips
04:12 - and wake up early but that's the first
04:14 - thing I thought of when I woke up
04:19 - but so I'm a little tired today
04:22 - what was I talking about paper clips ah
04:25 - so what I what I was thinking is I have
04:26 - these t-shirts I'm wearing one today and
04:28 - there's a bunch of different designs I
04:29 - would like to have a little contest here
04:33 - whoever can guess the number closest to
04:36 - the amount of paper clips that are on
04:38 - this page by the end of this live
04:43 - session of the coding train I will send
04:47 - you a free coding train t-shirt if you
04:50 - were one if you want to pick out your
04:51 - style now cuz you're so sure gonna win
04:53 - this you can go to coding train dot
04:56 - store and V I think I'd have no idea
05:00 - MV comm yeah there we go
05:03 - coding training dot store envy calm good
05:05 - nice nice t-shirt style that you like
05:07 - there's a bunch no no no no no no not
05:11 - just typing your number in the chat and
05:13 - boy your numbers are way too low let me
05:15 - just tell you it's really low because I
05:19 - have my intention is to kind of least
05:21 - get up there at least till it's like
05:23 - automatically making some paper clips
05:26 - did you tuned in because you thought
05:28 - you'd be watching something about
05:29 - learning to code I'm sorry
05:31 - instead you tuned in to a lunatic on the
05:33 - internet every once in a while manages
05:35 - to focus enough to do a coding tutorial
05:38 - so I I think in order to enter this
05:42 - competition I think you're gonna have to
05:44 - have a Twitter account because I think
05:45 - that's one of the only ways I can
05:46 - regulate a time stamp so it's 312 p.m.
05:52 - Eastern Time if your tweet with hashtag
05:56 - paperclip train you must use the hashtag
05:59 - paperclip train with a net single number
06:02 - if your tweet has the number closest to
06:05 - whatever I end with and your tweet is
06:07 - before 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time that means
06:10 - 3:30 p.m. and 59 seconds if that's the
06:14 - time stamp is fine but 331 and any
06:18 - number of seconds is not okay
06:20 - I will send you I will I would send you
06:22 - a box of paperclips but then I have to
06:24 - go to the post office myself it's such a
06:26 - pain but this print-on-demand t-shirt
06:28 - send you a t-shirt it's just so okay so
06:33 - paperclip train now if you want to play
06:35 - along let's make some more paper clips
06:36 - alright do up to like 16 what do I need
06:44 - to do here so I need to get someone I
06:45 - got a what do I need to do I need to
06:49 - let's just keep making some paperclips I
06:50 - forget I it was so long ago that I
06:53 - started this game I'm gonna run out of
06:56 - money I'm gonna run out of money making
06:59 - paperclips
07:00 - I have a lot of unsold inventory oh this
07:03 - has got it get better okay Auto Clippers
07:06 - this is really gonna help alright
07:09 - finally at least now I'm oughta Kagome I
07:12 - will come back to this little later
07:13 - maybe I'll lower the price to sell them
07:16 - but maybe I'll just lower the price of
07:19 - 10 cents I could do that right now right
07:20 - and it's it's it's fine oh I could buy
07:25 - another Auto Clippers okay let's lower
07:27 - to five cents alright let's let it run
07:28 - let's let it go okay alright let's check
07:34 - Twitter paper clip train how we doing
07:41 - here alright look there's a whole bunch
07:44 - already look at this this is exciting
07:47 - alright paper clip train here we go now
07:53 - back to the coding train
07:57 - I did something exciting this morning
08:03 - which is that I recorded look I'm so
08:06 - giant I am a monster on the internet
08:10 - next to some diagrams let me zoom this
08:14 - out a little bit some new videos will be
08:22 - appearing on the internet that were
08:24 - recorded and not live streamed and this
08:26 - is your clue to what they could be about
08:28 - with a special guest appearance by
08:31 - somebody who drew these diagrams so just
08:33 - little little foreshadowing there those
08:35 - will come out next week in the next week
08:37 - or two nine new results okay this is
08:40 - good
08:40 - all right let's check on our paper bliss
08:42 - oh wait I I'm not even looking at the
08:46 - chat and just looking at Mike
08:47 - [Music]
08:54 - let's see here I can get some more Auto
08:57 - Clippers for sure really gonna get - I
09:01 - need to do some marketing definitely
09:02 - need to do some marketing okay alright
09:07 - so what's gonna happen today on the
09:09 - coding train I'm going to try to
09:10 - actually accomplish something um the
09:12 - things that I would like to do are
09:13 - number one look at some nice particle
09:15 - system things that people made number
09:19 - two I would like to do some more of my
09:22 - object-oriented programming in
09:24 - JavaScript thing video stuff for my
09:27 - intro to learn to program series that
09:29 - needs to get updated with some es6
09:31 - syntax and then also I am going to make
09:36 - the computer it's over here talk to me
09:42 - so I want to i-i've started this series
09:44 - about chat BOTS I'm looking at very
09:46 - simple pattern matching retrieval based
09:48 - chat BOTS I look at something called
09:50 - rive script and what I'm gonna do is I'm
09:54 - going to induce some variation of that
09:56 - number guessing game but instead of
09:58 - typing in my responses and reading my
10:01 - responses as text I'm going to speak
10:04 - iris I'm gonna speak my words and listen
10:08 - to the response from the computer so
10:09 - we're gonna kind like custom build our
10:11 - own you know insert name of commercial
10:14 - product that talks to you at home device
10:16 - here like to make our own and then
10:19 - eventually I would like to investigate
10:21 - making some projects that run on these
10:25 - insert name of commercial device that
10:27 - you can buy and put in your home here I
10:28 - guess I have to name them at some point
10:30 - I'm always worried if I say something
10:32 - like Alexa then all these things in this
10:36 - room will start to beep at me but there
10:37 - is nothing in this room but me and some
10:40 - other stuff but maybe I just triggered
10:41 - your Alexa at home okay viral is gonna
10:47 - go get some snacks it's a good idea I
10:49 - would take your time because I'm really
10:51 - I this paperclip thing I have so many
10:54 - emails I could've been either I need to
10:55 - reply to instead just in case you're
10:58 - wondering I won't i won't i won't look
11:01 - at my eye
11:02 - I got what I want to show you the
11:03 - paperclip thing that I've been working
11:05 - on since last night
11:06 - there has to be an end right there's got
11:08 - to be a reason why I'm doing this there
11:10 - has to be a goal to get to eventually
11:12 - right Frank Frank are you out there you
11:14 - listening somebody get Frank Luntz on
11:16 - the phone Frank tell me what do I do
11:23 - I just I can't that's East
11:35 - I need to work that I really this will I
11:38 - really this okay so here we are let's
11:40 - buy some we're out of Clippers are we
11:41 - are we close no we're nowhere near we
11:44 - have a we have a lot where we need to
11:46 - make some more paper clips
11:47 - let's get these Auto Clippers going up
11:49 - and let's let's raise the price since
11:53 - we're kind of selling them faster than
11:55 - we can make them we need a little more
11:57 - money maybe we'll come back a little
11:59 - while and get get some some marketing
12:05 - going okay no let's get rid of this
12:08 - let's get rid of this is it 3:30 yet you
12:11 - still have time to guess you still have
12:13 - time to guess I haven't seen there
12:16 - hasn't been a single paper the latest is
12:18 - Jorge who guessed 23,000 250 this will
12:22 - be interesting so distance by integer
12:27 - values so that's the winner will be the
12:29 - closest number you can go above you can
12:32 - go below it doesn't matter the if I take
12:34 - your guess the absolute value of your
12:36 - guess - the final number here and that
12:38 - number is the lowest you will with the
12:41 - coding train t-shirt and if there's a
12:44 - tie
12:45 - I will send - why not right
12:48 - there's ten people who all tie I don't
12:51 - know I'll send ten that's what's gonna
12:53 - happen all right so let's see what's
13:00 - happening now let's so speaking of
13:04 - hashtags with the word training in hit
13:06 - last week I did a what did I do last
13:13 - week I did a coding challenge making a
13:14 - particle system
13:15 - and there have been some really nice
13:19 - examples of particle systems that have
13:21 - been posted to Twitter with the hashtag
13:23 - particle train here's one by Alberto
13:27 - nice I like how these particles are
13:29 - coming from the outside and coming into
13:32 - the center there's like meditative
13:34 - breathing thing going on here I love
13:36 - that this is a really nice one right so
13:39 - this looks very similar to my example
13:41 - but there's some nice variations here
13:42 - number one is there's these there's
13:44 - particles that are colored black and
13:46 - particles that are come from white with
13:47 - some sort of transparency against a gray
13:48 - background it looks like and then
13:50 - there's these little extra yellow
13:51 - popping ones that maybe pop out with
13:52 - more speed and respond to gravity
13:55 - looks like falling down which gives it a
13:56 - really nice quality great work to siren
14:00 - on twitter here's one huh this looks
14:02 - quite a bit like little bursts of fire
14:05 - that's nice I love this oh look at this
14:07 - a drain so if I click here let's see if
14:12 - this runs goes to it which while this is
14:17 - loading I should just check on the paper
14:18 - clips right right it's always okay if
14:20 - something's loading let's check on the
14:22 - paper clips by some water Clippers what
14:25 - do we think lower the price a little bit
14:26 - lower the price a little bit okay okay
14:27 - back back here we can see nice used to
14:29 - the particle system with an actual train
14:31 - and I can move the trains moving ooh and
14:34 - I think I can press on here back here I
14:36 - can change to some stars some rainbows
14:39 - and back to some stars and there we go
14:43 - we don't need paper clips stars and
14:46 - rainbows and smoke from a train made in
14:49 - javascript in the browser this is all we
14:52 - need
14:54 - [Music]
15:06 - okay thank you for it so I'm gonna keep
15:09 - scrolling down we've got some nice
15:11 - raining effect whoo this sort of like
15:13 - cool vortex crazy thing this one is on
15:16 - open processing with some sound
15:18 - interaction that's lovely this is some
15:20 - weird something for some hamsters oh
15:24 - this is that same I think this is a nice
15:28 - one looks like that makes a nice
15:30 - circular like Fang there's so many this
15:32 - is so exciting and wonderful to see I
15:34 - hope I'm not missing anybody's butt so I
15:36 - encourage you to check out Parker crane
15:37 - hashtag on Twitter and submit your own
15:39 - you can also find user submissions and
15:45 - community versions of some of the coding
15:46 - challenges if you go to the rainbow code
15:48 - repository and I go down to coding
15:53 - challenges maybe challenges all the way
15:56 - to the bottom
15:57 - oh I mean the wrong on the wrong URL
16:04 - coding challenges all the way towards
16:06 - the bottom I'm looking for a simple
16:09 - particle system and here we can see some
16:13 - here's a link to the particle train hash
16:15 - tag and some wonderful demos by users
16:19 - let's click through these real quick I'm
16:20 - just gonna click on the demos demo demo
16:22 - demo demo demo Oh apparently one of them
16:29 - is playing some sound
16:39 - this one's responding to the sound the
16:41 - music's not actually synced right now
16:46 - pause on get new colors start song again
16:50 - cool here's one called
16:55 - embers ah looks kind of like embers
16:58 - coming out of fire that's really nice
17:00 - here is one called DV k qpe a pen buys
17:06 - oh here look at these nice little
17:08 - bubbles so one of the things I need to
17:10 - investigate today
17:12 - you see a little flickering going on
17:13 - here is deleting particles so that's
17:15 - something I'm definitely gonna
17:16 - investigate today chimney I guess these
17:20 - are the default names if you don't name
17:23 - but I'm like really I'm what is the
17:26 - meaning of MBG mzq there's a queue
17:30 - there's got to be a deeper meaning there
17:32 - does it have something to do with with
17:34 - paper clips possess something to do with
17:36 - paper clips let's check let's check oh
17:39 - how am i doing I have why I need some
17:41 - more wire I need some more wire okay I
17:43 - bought some more wire about a lot of
17:45 - wire how am i doing that's a month's old
17:47 - inventory I think I can lower the price
17:48 - here I need more Auto Clippers okay
17:50 - we'll come back will come back will come
17:52 - back okay where was I where is it okay
17:54 - back back to nice chimney here oh look
17:57 - at this
17:58 - move your mouse on either side of the
17:59 - screen so we can see some smoke from
18:01 - chimney one our smoke from chimney - I
18:03 - love that I love the interaction to be
18:05 - able to sort of trigger different
18:06 - chimneys and oh this is the one that is
18:10 - with that sound responsive so as I speak
18:16 - the particles go and if I put on some
18:19 - music
18:30 - oh right I love sound responsive talking
18:39 - me particles out of my sound and then
18:45 - here we go
18:48 - particles towards center from Dave
18:50 - briquette II this looks like maybe the
18:52 - particles are kind of orbiting and
18:54 - circling around the center with a nice
18:55 - rainbow pattern and coming in maybe
18:57 - there's some gravitational attraction
18:58 - there that is cool
19:00 - great work I could have sworn there I
19:03 - saw the name Alka on this list
19:06 - Oh embers was Alka I must be um so this
19:09 - one was Alka what did I say yesterday I
19:13 - said like loyal viewer but I think I've
19:15 - maybe misspoke it's a royal view or
19:17 - something like that
19:18 - great work with the embers I wonder if
19:20 - there's something going on with my
19:21 - computer where things are running a
19:22 - little bit snow okay excellent work
19:26 - everybody uh
19:27 - this computer went to sleep this one
19:29 - which is really forking one might say
19:32 - I'm gonna get Frank Lance on the phone
19:33 - yet I need like an emergency phone where
19:36 - I could just like I need to know the
19:38 - secrets behind the paper clips and the
19:40 - hypno drones and the swarms and the
19:43 - youngbae and all of the things please
19:46 - tell me the secrets do you hear that
19:52 - dinging okay uh yeah so Alka says
19:57 - there's tons of fancy filters going on
20:00 - there it runs beautifully smooth on my
20:02 - machine
20:03 - alright I successfully did just about
20:06 - nothing for the law at least the good
20:09 - stuff it's almost 20 to 30 minutes here
20:12 - so those of you who are slow to enter to
20:14 - join to abort to to to board to board
20:19 - the coding train now you're all here so
20:20 - maybe we're gonna do some actual coding
20:22 - now I like to use this Adam text editor
20:27 - which I will now open these are some of
20:32 - the examples from last week I'm going to
20:35 - open oh I forgot it oh I turn one of
20:39 - these days I will install I term and
20:42 - and and look at the wonder that is I
20:44 - term and do a video about it mmm okay
20:48 - I'll do that right after I do Chrome
20:51 - extension so right before right before
20:53 - I'll do I turn before Chrome extension
20:54 - Chrome extensions are coming this an
20:56 - ester though because they're on my list
20:57 - for the course that I'm teaching right
20:59 - now so all right so what wherever I want
21:03 - to go now I want to go to the desktop
21:04 - and maybe under opie and I want to run a
21:11 - little web server so I can take a look
21:14 - at whatever it is that I'm doing what's
21:19 - what's probably the last one the
21:20 - particles was the coding challenge I'd
21:22 - probably opt to it's kind of where I
21:24 - left off let's see is there an error
21:26 - here oh it's mouse dragged right okay
21:30 - excellent all right so this is perfect
21:33 - this is where I left off so what I want
21:36 - to look at it's a couple things here
21:40 - Simon also loyal royal viewer Simon
21:44 - helped me with a to-do list which now I
21:51 - don't have in front of my eyes anymore
21:54 - ah and actually I was looking at let's
21:59 - look at this together
22:00 - so to places where I want to look one is
22:04 - let's see which is this playlist one is
22:07 - foundations of programming in JavaScript
22:08 - and the other one is I want to look at
22:15 - the sorry I want to look at the
22:18 - processing intro tutorials here and
22:24 - because these are a good reference for
22:26 - me the objects and arrays please don't
22:30 - start playing videos here okay by the
22:36 - way has anybody noticed that these days
22:38 - if you're watching one of my videos
22:40 - sometimes I appear in an ad before in my
22:44 - videos
22:44 - it's a strange experiment that we're
22:46 - trying here in that one of the things
22:48 - that I'm helping to promote is a new
22:49 - undergraduate program that's starting
22:51 - next fall
22:52 - it's called interactive media arts it's
22:54 - in New York City
22:55 - this is the website ITP NYU edu slash
22:58 - ima there's gonna be an open house I
23:00 - think maybe even like this coming
23:01 - weekend oh that's right the dates are on
23:05 - this website if you're interested you're
23:07 - planning to schools University College
23:09 - and you're thinking about doing
23:11 - something in I guess what is this called
23:14 - again Interactive Media Arts this might
23:15 - be the place for you so sometimes you
23:18 - might see a little ad for me talking
23:20 - about the interactive media arts on my
23:21 - videos before my videos I was there my
23:25 - in this picture this is where I am in
23:27 - this picture
23:28 - oh no I'm gone but I was in that picture
23:30 - okay so so this is fine this is this is
23:37 - fine nothing here that I need more on
23:39 - objects yes so these two yeah so Simon's
23:43 - list is really quite good it's pretty
23:45 - comprehensive here because it's noticing
23:47 - it's the same as what I have but if I
23:48 - think about where I left off was here
23:53 - add adding and removing objects ah what
23:57 - sec oh but that's from a year ago
24:00 - so this hmm I I have an idea what I'm
24:04 - gonna do now is so in my in my new one
24:07 - that I made which was 7.3 which was
24:09 - arrays of objects I actually did the
24:11 - adding so what I want to do is I'm going
24:14 - to do a removing and removing objects
24:18 - I'm gonna do the clicking on objects in
24:19 - the same video because when you click on
24:21 - it I'll remove it maybe that'll work
24:24 - and in Simon's big so helpful Scott my
24:26 - full list here so if I'm following that
24:29 - list what I'm on next is more on
24:33 - deleting elements from arrays yeah let's
24:38 - do the deleting interesting let's do the
24:40 - clicking let's do the clicking then I'll
24:42 - do the deleting for the clicking I don't
24:44 - know I'm gonna do something expanding on
24:49 - this video I will improvise okay so
24:53 - let's go back to the browser I guess
24:56 - I'll leave that stuff open here we are
24:59 - this is the one where let me just adjust
25:01 - this a little bit o P too and actually
25:05 - what I'm gonna do
25:06 - is oh there goes the camera don't be
25:10 - alarmed this is just the point on the
25:13 - coding train where I know that a half an
25:15 - hour has passed I better get started
25:17 - doing some coding and it's where I'm
25:21 - going to just I'm going to now also I
25:26 - want to reveal and finders what I want
25:28 - to do is there a thing for that show and
25:30 - finder and then I want to make one
25:32 - called op3 and I want to look at that
25:40 - code and I want open that up here op3
25:46 - there we go okay so I am now ready I
25:50 - think for the next video that I want to
25:52 - do let me minimize this and I think
25:57 - we're good so what's going on here so
25:59 - one of the things that I do it's very
26:01 - confusing if you happen to decide you
26:02 - want to tune watch what it's live
26:04 - streams why I'm not really sure you
26:06 - would want to do that but people seem to
26:08 - a number of people if I could look it up
26:10 - now I have a lot of different playlists
26:13 - and a lot of different threads of
26:14 - different topics I know I have this kind
26:16 - of like machine learning playlist that's
26:18 - kind of on hold for the moment that I
26:20 - did a little video to explain why mostly
26:22 - what I try to do is I try to make
26:24 - content related to the courses that I'm
26:25 - teaching here at New York University so
26:28 - right now the two courses that I'm
26:29 - teaching are one is an introduction to
26:31 - programming course where people have
26:32 - never programmed before so I'm and I
26:35 - previously made a whole playlist for
26:37 - that course but I use a lot of old older
26:39 - es5 syntax I'm redoing some of these
26:42 - videos with es6 classes so that's that's
26:45 - what I'm about to start with so I'm kind
26:47 - of jumping into the middle of making a
26:48 - tutorial for a playlist you're watching
26:50 - along because hey you might learn
26:52 - something or maybe you might give me
26:54 - some feedback or you just have this on
26:56 - in the background while you're making
26:57 - paper clips just go make the paper clips
26:59 - paper oh we can check on them soon I
27:01 - think it's been long enough since I look
27:02 - that I can look right kind of look maybe
27:03 - maybe okay so that's what I'm doing the
27:07 - other topic the thread that I'm on is
27:09 - for my class called here at HP it's
27:11 - called programming from A to Z but in on
27:13 - YouTube I'm calling it programming with
27:15 - text because the programming from A to Z
27:16 - makes it sound like it's a beginner
27:18 - course and it's not at all
27:19 - and so the topic that I'm kind of
27:20 - working on right now is chatbots
27:22 - and so I'm gonna do stuff with speech to
27:24 - text and text to speech in the browser
27:26 - so that you could create a
27:28 - conversational interface so those are my
27:29 - two goals for today
27:30 - it's 3:30 if if all goes well I'll be
27:34 - here till 5:30 if all doesn't go well I
27:38 - will be gone sooner are here lingers
27:39 - yeah but that's kind of my plan so let
27:43 - me take a minute before I go into the
27:45 - first tutorial to take a look at the
27:47 - chat I'm gonna look at the slack chat
27:49 - and the YouTube chat to the extent that
27:51 - I can am I missing something important
27:53 - that I forget something that I usually
27:54 - do is there I do you have any questions
27:56 - you want to ask before I get started let
27:58 - me know oh wait I should say that the
28:06 - time for guessing has ended I should
28:12 - have probably let's go to paperclip
28:17 - train 13 minutes ago and can we guess
28:24 - twice yeah that's a good question well I
28:31 - don't know what to do about that
28:33 - [Music]
28:35 - Cubs ten says to notice me how is my day
28:39 - random number reading I did forget oh ok
28:44 - so there's a bunch of things being asked
28:45 - right now I don't know if you guys are
28:47 - just talking about eclipses in the chat
28:48 - or if if that's actually a question but
28:53 - on my list I would love to get to this
28:55 - at some point is to look at how to make
28:56 - up library for processing in eclipse and
28:58 - actually how to work with processing the
29:00 - Java based platform in Eclipse because
29:02 - it opens up a lot of doors for those of
29:04 - you who enjoy that platform that
29:06 - programming environment and want to
29:08 - contribute to it
29:09 - how is my day oh my day was great
29:13 - because oops this is now blank but
29:17 - because this extra video coding
29:21 - challenge thing is coming soon and it
29:24 - was cool it was awesome I'm really
29:25 - excited about it but it wasn't so great
29:27 - because I really did not sleep
29:29 - and very tired and I this is like a
29:32 - holly want some of the busiest time of
29:34 - the year also because I am getting ready
29:36 - for processing day so one thing I should
29:38 - mention is this is next Saturday October
29:41 - 21st at the MIT Media Lab tickets are
29:43 - still on sale for this that just so you
29:46 - know that so probably look at Wonka
29:47 - there's pictures oh look there's a
29:48 - picture of me and some other wonderful
29:50 - people
29:51 - Te'o and Choi who has been organizing
29:54 - this event called processing day there
29:56 - is a community clouds project that I've
29:59 - been working on to make name tags I'm
30:00 - gonna do a coding challenge live at
30:02 - processing day so if you're in the
30:03 - Boston area and are interested in coming
30:06 - please do this is the first time that
30:09 - we're having kind of an official
30:10 - processing community event here some of
30:13 - the other wonderful speakers who will be
30:15 - there as well well look there's like a
30:17 - schedule at 2:20 this is what this is me
30:23 - at 2:20 oh boy I'm getting nervous now
30:26 - anyway uh okay answering questions
30:33 - austin asks did we get the nametags sort
30:37 - oh there's a new Adam ID I do not know
30:39 - about this else do we get the nametags
30:40 - sorted out that's in in progress
30:43 - there's a nice me I am so me built a
30:45 - really nice system to generate SVG's and
30:47 - hopefully that's gonna be enough to do
30:48 - the printing is it like scratch day well
30:51 - I didn't attend scratch day so I
30:54 - couldn't say for sure but certainly
30:55 - scratch day is a impetus and in
30:58 - inspiration for us doing an event like
31:01 - this there's also in our do we know day
31:03 - which is I would say like a similar
31:07 - event and scratch is a wonderful project
31:11 - I'll use it I've used it a lot for with
31:13 - kids and stuff like that so you can work
31:17 - with processing by eclipse
31:19 - yeah processing and I should processing
31:22 - is a if I if I run it here and I think I
31:27 - need to download the newer version this
31:29 - is a self-contained application that you
31:33 - can run on Windows Mac or Linux you can
31:36 - write code in here
31:37 - whoops you can write code in here it
31:42 - look
31:42 - if you've seen my recent videos where
31:44 - I'm mostly using p5.js the there's a lot
31:49 - that's similar in terms of the naming
31:51 - but this is actually Java syntax so the
31:56 - syntax the language that this is built
31:58 - on top of his Java so this environment
32:00 - is meant to kind of ease you into
32:02 - programming and make creative sketching
32:04 - coding design stuff I do a lot of coding
32:07 - challenges in processing I don't use it
32:09 - as much as I would like to just because
32:11 - it's so convenient to be able to put the
32:12 - p5.js stuff
32:13 - in the browser to share and get
32:15 - contributions but I aspire to go back to
32:18 - my processing roots and use it more in
32:20 - videos but since this is built on top of
32:21 - Java if you want to contribute to the
32:24 - development of the IDE itself or to the
32:27 - library itself behind all of the
32:29 - functions that are part of the code you
32:31 - might write or add a contribution like a
32:33 - library or a tool or a mode there are
32:36 - modes like for example I could switch
32:37 - this to Opie 5 jazz mode I always forget
32:40 - this is there did I do a video on that
32:42 - because I meant to or Python mode
32:46 - there's different modes and things so I
32:47 - would encourage you to take a look at
32:49 - that if you're interested okay so I
32:51 - think that was my that was my that was
32:56 - my answering some questions and making
32:58 - sure I didn't miss anything somebody
32:59 - said I should read some random numbers
33:01 - but I'll come back to that later okay
33:02 - let's check on the paper flips I need
33:04 - some I need some paper clip music it
33:08 - needs to be very relaxing I'm looking
33:09 - for something I don't have anything if I
33:12 - play this like these like Mozart tracks
33:16 - that I downloaded from Audio hero which
33:20 - is a service that has royalty-free music
33:21 - that you can that you can get you can
33:23 - sign up for and pay for but once I put
33:25 - them on one of my videos it was
33:26 - immediately I got a copyright violation
33:29 - notice alright can you guys hear the
33:31 - chairs and furniture going by in the
33:33 - hallway right now I've got a thousand
33:35 - paper clips
33:37 - I have funds are in serious trouble
33:40 - my unsold inventory I've got a pretty
33:43 - decent amount of wire whoo boy I just
33:45 - bought a lot of wire I didn't mean to do
33:47 - that
33:47 - all right let's let's lower the price a
33:51 - little bit and that's good
33:56 - and let's let this go all right I'm not
33:59 - doing very well the paperclips don't
34:07 - makes it excellent point and the chat
34:10 - it's not your paper clips
34:12 - it's our paper clips I still haven't
34:15 - come up with a I think what I'm gonna
34:17 - have to do just for fairness is if you
34:19 - make more than one guess I'm gonna take
34:22 - your first one or I'll take your I think
34:25 - your last one I'll seem like you change
34:27 - your mind I'll take your last one up
34:29 - until the 3:30 p.m. cutoff 34 minutes it
34:38 - okay good to keep me in check let's do
34:42 - some coding if anybody really wants to
34:46 - help me out I could just really use like
34:49 - a whole new sound board with like a
34:52 - little button for like beginning to code
34:54 - and some music for reading random
34:56 - numbers and some waiting musics and
34:58 - debugging music some other like weird
35:00 - sound effects Emily's going to hear as
35:02 - if they exist but they don't I like this
35:04 - one though let's do some code
35:08 - [Music]
35:10 - my hand is cut off kid
35:17 - [Music]
35:22 - okay what workshop that let's come over
35:25 - here and erase some whiteboard my
35:28 - physical therapist says that erasing a
35:32 - whiteboard it's actually a really good
35:34 - thing for me to do so requires need to
35:37 - use my tricep muscles which are still
35:39 - very very weak apply pressure to the
35:44 - wall and let me see if these the corners
35:48 - is that a corner no the corner is more
35:51 - like here that's fine
35:52 - the corner is like here how's the glare
35:55 - how's everything alright so here we go
36:07 - hello this is a good question there's a
36:15 - good question in the chat loesel macho's
36:19 - asks can you experience li explain why
36:20 - you can't use the random function
36:21 - outside of set up in the p5.js web
36:24 - editor well first of all this is not
36:26 - this is not editor specific if I say let
36:32 - Val equal random 100 like this seems
36:36 - like I should be able to do this right
36:37 - right why not let me go and refresh and
36:40 - I've got an error and look at this did
36:43 - you just try to use five Jazz's random
36:46 - function if so you may want to move it
36:49 - into your sketches setup function for
36:52 - more details see frequently asked
36:54 - questions why can't I assign so first of
36:55 - all you can take a look at this error
36:57 - message click on it and take a look but
36:59 - I'll I will I will
37:00 - I will explain to you what's going on
37:02 - here this is a sort of a strange thing
37:03 - so when a page loads you can start
37:09 - executing JavaScript immediately this
37:11 - just javascript file is loading as its
37:13 - reference in the HTML page but you
37:17 - cannot guarantee that there is an event
37:21 - that happens it's often called like
37:23 - onload maybe are ready and that event is
37:26 - an event that occurs when everything
37:29 - associated with the page
37:30 - loaded all the JavaScript files the
37:32 - style SCSS file all the elements on the
37:34 - page everything is loaded and one of
37:37 - those things that has to load is the
37:38 - p5.js library and the setup function
37:41 - p5.js is the place where you can which
37:45 - guarantees that everything is loaded
37:47 - loaded so far so while I could do
37:49 - something like let Val equals math dot
37:53 - random times 100 which would essentially
37:59 - be the equivalent and I could say Val
38:02 - and I've got that random number this is
38:04 - totally fine because that's coming from
38:08 - native JavaScript that's just the math
38:10 - library is just available for you
38:11 - instantly it's part of the browser
38:12 - itself essentially whereas the p5.js
38:14 - library isn't available unless it's
38:16 - finished loading and it's not finished
38:18 - loading until setup and random as part
38:20 - of that so it doesn't know what it is
38:21 - unless you're in setup alright hopefully
38:23 - that answer that question and now let us
38:28 - begin I'm gonna move this bug out of the
38:30 - way this is going to be something like
38:40 - objects and mouse interaction or
38:42 - clicking on objects something like that
38:51 - it's back for another video about
38:55 - objects and classes and stuff using
38:57 - javascript and p5 GS so one of the
39:00 - things that I get asked all the time I
39:02 - think you know I'm wider around the
39:03 - street people with like hey you there if
39:07 - I made a bunch of bubble objects in a
39:09 - canvas in the browser you imagine if
39:11 - this actually happened to be on the
39:12 - street and I want to like interact with
39:15 - them with the mouse individually like
39:16 - how would I know if the mouse is
39:18 - hovering over one versus the other how
39:20 - would I deal with that well it's just a
39:22 - little bit of an aside first before so
39:23 - this is what I want to implement in this
39:24 - video how can you as how can you have
39:27 - the user interact with individual
39:29 - objects how do I set the code to make
39:32 - that happen how's this work so here's
39:34 - the thing
39:35 - what eventually if you're watching all
39:38 - of these videos in the order that they
39:39 - are there's going to be a time in the
39:42 - future I
39:43 - recording these videos in the past but
39:45 - for you it will be the future where I
39:47 - will add things below the canvas like
39:49 - there'll be a button here or like a box
39:50 - with text in it and the canvas is
39:52 - actually one of those things too while
39:54 - on this page is a canvas I could put
39:55 - other things on this page everything on
39:57 - a web webpage can register events it can
40:01 - register this event of like a click on
40:02 - that's not really an event or I mouse
40:04 - over right I and and there's all sorts
40:07 - of fancy ways in JavaScript and in p5.js
40:09 - to handle all these different types of
40:11 - events to know how users are interacting
40:12 - with things but this thing here this
40:15 - thing here is one thing the canvas the
40:18 - only thing that p5 just knows is if
40:21 - you're clicking on the canvas or not and
40:23 - actually to be honest if you click off
40:26 - the canvas it's gonna make one kind of
40:27 - like it is mined off the canvas that
40:29 - might wander on which it just saw happen
40:30 - because I'm using this global
40:33 - mousepressed event I have an event it's
40:36 - just press the mouse anywhere but what
40:38 - if I want to have an event that's like
40:39 - only when I click on this circle so
40:41 - because these aren't separate the
40:44 - circles are my own invention they're
40:45 - pixels that I've drawn in their space
40:47 - it's up to me as the programmer the the
40:51 - person who designed this sketch to
40:52 - figure out how to handle that and so
40:56 - that's what I'm gonna do in this video
40:57 - so let me think about what would make
40:58 - sense I think what I'm gonna do is I'm
41:00 - gonna rewrite this sketch a little bit
41:01 - I'm gonna get rid of this mouse press
41:03 - function
41:04 - I mean I'm gonna come back to it but in
41:06 - in setup I'm going to say like let X
41:10 - equal random with let y equal random
41:15 - height let R equal random 10 comma 50
41:21 - and then I'm going to say I'm gonna just
41:25 - make this new bubble I'm gonna take this
41:27 - exact code from the bottom you're over
41:29 - there never know where to look one of
41:32 - these days I'll figure it out take this
41:34 - exact code from the bottom and I'm gonna
41:37 - make a new bubble alright so actually
41:43 - let's do this first let's just pretend
41:46 - we only have one let's go let's peel
41:48 - away from the array for a second and
41:50 - let's simplify our lives and let's I'm
41:53 - just going to make a single bubble
41:55 - object
41:56 - and that's gonna be it and forget about
41:59 - this array just for a little bit and so
42:02 - I'll come back to the array eventually
42:04 - now notice that this I'm not changing
42:08 - this bubble class at all it's still the
42:11 - same thing what I wear is it ah but I do
42:14 - need to say that individual bubble move
42:18 - bubble dots show so you might let so
42:22 - what I want to do is I want to have
42:24 - something to happen when I click on that
42:25 - bubble so your first instinct might be
42:27 - AHA well there's this mousepressed
42:30 - function that I can write out here oh ah
42:34 - look at this I wrote this nice mouse
42:36 - press function right out here yeah so
42:40 - why not why not there's this bubble
42:42 - class that I've been learning all about
42:44 - right I just do I know let's just do
42:45 - this
42:47 - console.log clicked on bubble right
42:52 - won't that work that'll work
42:54 - oh I'm so excited this is gonna work
43:00 - nothing's happening nothing's happening
43:02 - so I've sent you in the completely wrong
43:04 - direction
43:05 - although the instinct is kind of right
43:06 - yeah this is like a function that's just
43:09 - out in the wild it's global so it's for
43:11 - any mousepressed this is a function
43:13 - that's inside of the bubble so it's fine
43:17 - but here's the thing this this function
43:20 - mousepressed is a special function that
43:22 - p5 recognizes just like set up a draw or
43:25 - special functions of p5 recognizes p5 is
43:28 - not going to go inside of these new
43:30 - classes that you write and somehow
43:32 - recognize that you could have a mouse
43:33 - press function know where the object is
43:35 - figure out its this is not part of its
43:37 - capability wouldn't I don't even know
43:39 - how it could even be capable of that but
43:40 - there isn't any reason why I couldn't
43:44 - write a function and you know it's a
43:45 - little bit problematic for me to call it
43:47 - mousepressed so maybe I'm just gonna
43:49 - call it like let's just call it like
43:51 - clicked for right now there's no reason
43:54 - why I couldn't inside of the mouse
43:57 - pressed function say hey whatever the
44:00 - user clicks the mouse I know that
44:02 - globally why don't I just call another
44:06 - function inside any of my objects that
44:08 - need to handle that click
44:09 - so I'm gonna say bubble clicked so now
44:11 - look at this it's gonna work let's get a
44:13 - bigger one it's gonna work okay I'm
44:15 - gonna click on it okay look I clicked on
44:16 - the bubble look at me do it again oh
44:18 - well the three times I'm gonna take out
44:20 - over here now six times seven times
44:22 - eight so here's the thing remember this
44:25 - is a global mousepressed so I can call
44:28 - my function on this bubble object but
44:32 - it's just gonna do this every single
44:33 - time it's up to me to write some code to
44:36 - figure out wherever wherever I click the
44:39 - mouse I know where the bubble is and I
44:41 - know how big it is
44:42 - I know it's X and it's why it's our I
44:44 - know it's this dot X is this that Y is
44:46 - this not our what I need to figure out
44:48 - now I'm thinking about the paper clips
44:52 - don't think about the paper clips
44:53 - somebody will watch this video and no
44:54 - idea what you're talking about because
44:55 - they're not watching the live stream
44:56 - don't talk about the paper clips back
45:02 - mystery mystery the mystery of the paper
45:04 - clips this dot note if you know the X
45:07 - the Y and the R we can write some code
45:09 - so I could say something like hmm if
45:12 - okay well how do you so here's here's
45:14 - here's a little bit of a moment here
45:17 - let's say what I one of the things I
45:19 - need to figure out and I've probably
45:21 - done this in other videos but this seems
45:22 - like a nice time to to talk it through
45:24 - is if I have a circle how do I know if a
45:27 - point is inside the circle or is outside
45:29 - the circle because what I'm trying to do
45:31 - is figure out is the mouse that's the
45:34 - mouse arrow did it did it click inside
45:36 - or outside or inside the circle I could
45:39 - ask the same question for a square I
45:41 - couldn't ask that question for a
45:42 - triangle I could ask that question for
45:44 - some arbitrary strangely shaped polygon
45:46 - and all of these are going to get
45:48 - progressively more complex the square in
45:50 - the circle are pretty rectangle and a
45:52 - circle are pretty easy to do this is
45:54 - much harder but all of this is possible
45:56 - the point is I need to write some code
45:58 - to figure that out that code needs to go
46:00 - here did wherever that mouse is is it
46:03 - actually related to where this dot X
46:05 - that's not why did this not our R so how
46:07 - do I do that
46:07 - so one of the nice things that on P 5
46:09 - and both processing if you were using
46:11 - that instead have is a function called
46:13 - dist
46:13 - which stands for distance and I can give
46:16 - that function two points arbitrarily x1
46:21 - y1 x2 y2 so
46:23 - if I make one of those point to the
46:25 - center of the circle maybe I'll call
46:27 - that CX CY and then the other point over
46:33 - here for example is the mouse where the
46:35 - mouse clicked we'll call that MX my I
46:39 - could pass these values into that
46:41 - distance function and get the length of
46:43 - this line call that D something that I
46:48 - happen to know from my code oops wrong
46:51 - button is R the radius of the circle now
46:56 - I'm actually using it as the radius I am
46:57 - because remember the ellipse function
46:59 - itself wants the diameter so R really
47:01 - means the radius which is half of the
47:03 - diameter what do I mean by that
47:04 - so I happen to know this dot R is this
47:10 - distance or another way of looking at it
47:12 - it's this distance right here so guess
47:15 - what this is probably popping into your
47:16 - head just to count now if the distance
47:19 - between the center and the mouse is
47:21 - greater than the radius then that point
47:23 - is outside the circle if it's less than
47:25 - the radius then that point is inside the
47:28 - circle okay so now we could come over
47:32 - here and I could start to add that code
47:36 - I can say let me find the distance
47:38 - between Mouse X Mouse Y and this X and
47:44 - this dot Y and I can now say if D now
47:50 - this is not this dot D because this is a
47:52 - local variable that I'm using just to
47:54 - calculate for at this moment the
47:56 - distance is less than this dot R then
48:02 - console.log clicked on bubble now we're
48:07 - really getting somewhere whoa what just
48:14 - happened did I am I playing something
48:17 - sorry okay do this again
48:21 - now we're really getting somewhere
48:35 - okay so this is a moment of success and
48:39 - that was really loud that's gonna ruin
48:41 - this video so what I've now successfully
48:45 - done is I'm able to determine and only
48:48 - print out this statement so what's the
48:50 - full story here this is where I know
48:53 - that the mouse has been pressed anywhere
48:55 - so it's up to me to now to say like well
48:57 - if the mouse is pressed anywhere let's
48:59 - check if the mouse is pressed for this
49:01 - bubble and guess what let's go back to
49:03 - the array now let's put this array back
49:07 - let's make this a single bubble let's
49:13 - put that into the array and now this
49:17 - loop here just like in draw when I want
49:21 - to move and show everything there's no
49:23 - reason why I couldn't when I click the
49:24 - mouse use that same exact loop and just
49:28 - call clicked on all the bubbles that are
49:31 - in that array so let's see if this works
49:34 - whoops okay I have some air bubble is
49:36 - not too fine a draw so I forgot that I
49:39 - still have this old individual bubble
49:41 - that I don't need anymore so I can click
49:46 - on it it worked
49:47 - I can click outside I don't see anything
49:49 - let's let's actually add now let's do
49:57 - this five times in setup so I'm gonna
50:00 - add five bubbles and now in theory it's
50:04 - we're getting that message if I click on
50:06 - any of them but here's the thing I
50:07 - really want something to happen so I
50:10 - could change its color let's let's
50:12 - actually here's the thing what if I what
50:14 - if I were to just hover over these
50:15 - bubbles and I wanted to change their
50:17 - color if I were to hover over the
50:18 - bubbles and then have something on it so
50:20 - actually you know what there's another
50:22 - important point that I want to make I
50:24 - don't there's something about this
50:26 - function that I don't really like and
50:27 - yes I'm gonna do this from time to time
50:30 - and you will too and it's okay but right
50:32 - there I don't love the fact that I'm
50:34 - using mouse X and mouse Y those are
50:36 - global variables in theory I want my
50:39 - bubble class to only know about itself
50:42 - it doesn't really need to know about the
50:44 - outside world is it to know what's on a
50:45 - canvas that there's a mouse and in
50:47 - theory what I want to be able to do is
50:48 - right
50:49 - of generic bubble class that I could say
50:51 - hey is the mouth cooking on you or is
50:53 - this other sensor overtop of this other
50:56 - object at the same location as you or
50:59 - you know I switch it to using like a
51:00 - Kinect to track my hand is my hand
51:02 - location near this bubble so really what
51:04 - would make more sense is for me to
51:06 - actually put arguments into the clicked
51:10 - function and again I'm doing this sort
51:12 - of awful thing where I'm giving them the
51:13 - same name as arguments in SSR as
51:17 - properties of the class itself I'm
51:19 - giving these parameters X and y the same
51:21 - name is this dot X this that Y but
51:23 - javascript is very good at
51:25 - distinguishing because these this x and
51:27 - y are the ones that are coming in
51:29 - through the parameters and these here
51:32 - are the properties this dot of the
51:33 - object itself but maybe if I want it to
51:35 - be like a little less confusing about I
51:38 - might say like px py for like pixel X or
51:41 - pixel Y or something like that and so
51:44 - now what makes more sense is what I
51:45 - really want to do is pass in Mouse X
51:48 - Mouse Y because what I want to do when
51:50 - the mouse is pressed is ask does this
51:54 - point and really I might do something
51:56 - like contains or inside or it includes
51:59 - likes I could name that function in some
52:00 - other way because really what I'm asking
52:01 - is is that is that is that point inside
52:06 - that object so interestingly enough what
52:09 - I could do is let's let's give the
52:10 - bubbles a color I'm gonna give it like a
52:15 - brightness and make it zero and I'm
52:21 - going to say fill this dot brightness
52:27 - and I'll give it some alpha and then
52:32 - what I'm gonna do is when I've clicked
52:33 - on them I am going to say this dot
52:37 - brightness equals 255 so the idea here
52:43 - is that now bubbles each have a new
52:47 - property a color it starts at zero and
52:50 - any time I click on one of them I turn
52:53 - that one a different color so what's
52:55 - really nice about this is I have one
52:57 - function one function that's part of the
53:01 - class
53:01 - and I could use that function in any way
53:04 - that I want though it just all that
53:05 - function does is test if any generic
53:07 - point is inside a given object and if it
53:10 - is if it is inside that if it sorry
53:13 - inside and I'm inside that shape the
53:15 - geometry of that object if it is I
53:16 - change its color and the way I happen to
53:18 - be using it is by saying hey whenever
53:20 - the user clicks the mouse anywhere let's
53:22 - go check all the objects in our array
53:24 - and see if the mouse is inside them so
53:26 - all right I think this ends this
53:29 - particular video I need to do something
53:31 - where I one thing I would really
53:33 - actually like to do what you should
53:36 - usually do an exercise here so if you're
53:37 - watching this I'm trying to make it head
53:39 - do something different if you hover over
53:40 - the the bubble change the bubble to a
53:44 - rectangle see if you can make the same
53:46 - thing work with a rectangle allow
53:48 - yourself to click on it twice turn it on
53:50 - and off that's something you could try
53:52 - and have a different behavior for when
53:55 - you click on it versus when you just
53:56 - mouse over at those types of things but
53:58 - what I want to do something I want to do
53:59 - and may be able to in the next video is
54:01 - when I click on each one of these I
54:02 - remove them from from the world so I can
54:06 - i can add bubbles and delete them
54:08 - somehow so we have to look at how to
54:09 - delete things from an array okay see you
54:11 - in the next video perhaps okay bye all
54:17 - right people still actually watching
54:20 - this I have 5 new notifications whoa
54:27 - whoa alcázar doing some kind of like
54:29 - magic and the chat there about getting
54:31 - objects to like use mouse press that
54:34 - place outside the scope of my video here
54:37 - where did I do with my uh here's my mug
54:39 - that I put over there oh boy I better
54:42 - check on the paper clips huh these
54:44 - guesses are too late by the way the
54:48 - guest has had to be time-stamped where
54:50 - do I see the timestamp if I go here
54:51 - right
54:52 - 12:20 oh wait so is this oh oh the
54:57 - timestamps on Twitter maybe I'm seeing
55:00 - them at Pacific time okay so let's check
55:03 - on our paper clips boy them to be
55:06 - terribly definitely more auto clippers
55:12 - I'll just get as many as I can
55:15 - all right now I need to lower that price
55:19 - that should be better
55:21 - camera went off all right so I did Simon
55:30 - your perfect timing placing that list in
55:33 - again so deleting elements is definitely
55:36 - something that I want to do interacting
55:38 - with objects is done objects is talking
55:40 - to other objects clicking on objects in
55:43 - deleting them okay and to out more okay
55:46 - so let's see the paper good things gonna
55:51 - speed up right you know I just got to
55:54 - get to a hundred dollars let this go to
55:55 - a hundred dollars I think I've got
55:59 - plenty of wire well look at this oh boy
56:02 - oh I've got computational resources now
56:04 - I've got conversation okay you guys mind
56:07 - if we just take a couple minutes here so
56:10 - this needs to get to a thousand or 750
56:12 - and I can improve the auto cliff burrs I
56:16 - can't quite I have two extra let's oh no
56:19 - no I only have to trust so I need to get
56:21 - three thousand clips and I'll get an
56:23 - extra trust which you can give more
56:24 - memory or more processor I don't know
56:25 - which one so what should I do next I
56:27 - think probably Oh paper clips isn't
56:30 - running when I'm in another tap did
56:33 - anybody know that when making their
56:34 - guests let's check this okay oh boy I
56:39 - wonder if I take it out and what if I do
56:43 - this now it's running but I can't have
56:47 - this in the background of my video
56:48 - tutorials oh but let's see what if I put
56:50 - it behind there okay so here I am I'm
56:57 - like dude do I'm making a video tutorial
57:00 - about coding this is me making video to
57:03 - talk about Kony I already forgot and now
57:05 - I'm gonna check the paper clips
57:07 - twenty-seven twenty-seven hundred so if
57:09 - I go away again to this other one and
57:12 - it's like if I wait a little bit
57:18 - whoa this one laptop it should be above
57:26 - 3000 now right let's see oh oh yeah well
57:37 - I got 3000 I ran out
57:39 - I need wire do I have money for wire
57:41 - thank God I have money for a wire I can
57:44 - improve my Auto Clippers oh I definitely
57:48 - want to definitely need this revenue
57:50 - tracker that's gonna be really helpful
57:53 - let's raise the price a little bit let's
57:57 - buy some more wire I really don't want
57:59 - to run out of wire let's buy some more
58:01 - Auto Clippers raise the price again and
58:04 - am I at 500 yet okay I need to get this
58:07 - revenue track go to the next video I
58:09 - swear let's get to this revenue tracker
58:13 - of case 69 cents per second let's see
58:16 - him let's move that up to $1.00 per
58:19 - second okay that's good and this should
58:25 - be good this should work for a little
58:26 - while a dollar 36 per second okay I'm
58:29 - gonna let this go I think I'm in pretty
58:31 - good shape
58:31 - oh I've got more we need some more
58:33 - memory so let's go okay so the next
58:36 - thing I want to do is a video I'm gonna
58:45 - do one more of these object tutorials
58:49 - and by the way added to that list I
58:53 - should do something about getters and
58:54 - setters because I do think that's a it's
58:57 - kind of beyond the scope of what I'm
58:58 - doing in my video tutorials but it's a
59:00 - useful feature of es6 classes that's
59:02 - something I'm not completely used to
59:03 - because it's a little bit different than
59:05 - how it works in like Java or C++ but I
59:08 - should do that alright yes check I'd
59:13 - know making a paperclip game coding
59:16 - challenges like the worst idea for me
59:17 - ever I will never leave this room I
59:21 - already have a problem I already have
59:23 - enough of a problem Frank
59:28 - why what have you done this to me why
59:30 - please just tell me is there an end let
59:33 - me let me just check I'm gonna check my
59:34 - actual oh this is not going because self
59:40 - cricket oh I can get the self-correcting
59:42 - supply chain you guys can't see this but
59:44 - let me just okay alright I don't know
59:49 - what's going on here I'll come back to
59:50 - that later back to the selection the
59:55 - whistle is mountainy all right so if
60:03 - you're joining late I'm so sorry if
60:06 - you've been here old time I'm also very
60:08 - sorry so now what I want to do is let's
60:12 - do the clicking so first of all these
60:14 - these bubbles are really making me crazy
60:16 - the bubbles are so nervously bouncing
60:20 - around let me let me just adjust the
60:23 - class a little bit to just be a little
60:28 - less frenetic okay so I think what I'm
60:35 - gonna do
60:35 - ah and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
60:39 - quickly take this op4 and what I'm gonna
60:48 - do is what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
61:01 - call this point I'm gonna call this
61:03 - point over or maybe mouse over I don't
61:05 - know call that mouse over it's probably
61:09 - terrible name no no what should I call
61:10 - this does a generic just call it
61:12 - contains maybe that'll work
61:16 - and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna
61:20 - take this and just move it to draw I
61:24 - don't need to move it to draw just gonna
61:25 - say bubbles index I'd contains Mouse X
61:30 - Mouse why I know what to call it
61:32 - roll over that's what I want roll over
61:34 - and I'm
61:36 - just change this to rollover and I'm
61:39 - gonna say otherwise this dot brightness
61:42 - equals zero so what I want to start with
61:45 - let's see if this works
61:47 - OOP something the wrong one for uh oh I
61:53 - edited the wrong code didn't I that's
61:54 - fine
61:55 - at least I saved it back up yeah okay
61:58 - hold on let me rename these so this one
62:02 - this one is actually four and this one
62:06 - is now three and yeah okay so this is
62:13 - what I want I want them to be generally
62:15 - bigger too because it's a little easier
62:17 - to and I can take this out this extra
62:20 - code and I am going to just have them be
62:26 - generally a little bit bigger in size
62:29 - whoops this I don't need okay so I just
62:34 - quickly changed this to be have a
62:36 - rollover and let me also make ten of
62:40 - them just to have more whoa hold on did
62:48 - I hit safe oh I mean three still ah crud
62:56 - I'm gonna have to pick have to fix this
62:58 - later I saved over what I was doing oh
63:07 - just bear with me everybody this will
63:10 - get fixed eventually okay make twenty to
63:17 - sixty and make ten of them yeah if by
63:22 - the way a little note to self e'er if
63:24 - you mess with the file system outside of
63:27 - Adam but leave everything open and Adam
63:28 - your move files around you save them
63:30 - it's gonna save it back to where it was
63:31 - originally
63:32 - so doesn't know about you moving the
63:34 - file system okay so what I want to add
63:35 - to this is click to delete click er
63:39 - I should really name things better yes I
63:42 - definitely should
63:46 - when is the paper clips reveal it will
63:49 - be whenever I am done with the whenever
63:53 - I am done with the live stream and I
63:54 - will review wait a second oh no it's
63:57 - still it's a different I was so worried
63:58 - I closed it by accident
63:59 - oh no hold on I've run out of stuff okay
64:04 - any more wire we just buy some more wire
64:07 - here let me improve the wire extrusion
64:12 - buy some more wire dollar okay we really
64:17 - can't have I I need more memory
64:19 - I should really add more processors and
64:23 - I should get some more Clippers cuz I'm
64:26 - running out of there we go so I want
64:31 - this to stabilize a certain amount of
64:34 - money
64:35 - / yeah I want this just maybe I should
64:40 - some more let's make some more Clippers
64:43 - we want this to stabilize let's lower
64:46 - the price a little bit yeah that's good
64:51 - that's what I wanted to see I'm running
64:52 - out of I'm not clipping them fast enough
64:57 - I'm selling them faster than I can clip
64:59 - them let's go back to five cents I want
65:01 - this to settle at least $1.00 per second
65:04 - right now okay before I go back to the
65:07 - codec okay that's pretty good all right
65:12 - what am i no no no over here for ten
65:20 - we've got lots of time at 4:30 no no
65:24 - this is not my game I did not make this
65:26 - game
65:27 - Frank Frank made this game Oh Frank
65:33 - the tain whistle anyway all right so
65:44 - [Applause]
65:49 - hello it's me back again with some these
65:53 - bubbles again Oh a the bubbles
65:55 - someday I'll think of something besides
65:57 - bubbles but the bubbles kind of works
65:59 - so I the last video I kind of looked at
66:01 - how I could click on the bubbles and
66:04 - change their color and now I just
66:07 - adjusted the code a little bit so I
66:08 - could mouse over the bubbles and you
66:10 - know I could show you what I did I did
66:12 - this in-between where I now I'm using
66:14 - this function called rollover I rename
66:16 - the click function to rollover I gave it
66:18 - these arguments and in doing the same
66:20 - sort of thing if the distance is if it's
66:22 - inside the circle I turn it white if
66:24 - it's not I turn it black so what I want
66:28 - to do now is I want to click on the
66:30 - bubble and have it pop I wanted to
66:33 - disappear how do I do that well good
66:36 - news everybody
66:37 - I kind of did I didn't all of that in
66:40 - the last video except for the whole what
66:44 - did I forget to do oh the deleting from
66:46 - an array so let's let's think about that
66:48 - so okay how do i how do I remove
66:50 - something I mean one one way I could
66:52 - remove something is just stop drawing it
66:54 - or move it way off screen and there was
66:56 - it there were in the old days without
66:58 - the code with like 6 feet of snow next
67:01 - to me sometimes you had to do that
67:03 - because it'd this fixed array you
67:05 - couldn't take things out you couldn't
67:06 - add things to it so you would kind of
67:07 - like reuse elements and move them off
67:09 - screen but here in the land of
67:10 - JavaScript there's a really nice thing
67:12 - you could do it I'm gonna come over here
67:13 - to this camera that's not on and I'm
67:22 - gonna come over here I'm gonna erase
67:25 - this distance thing and at some point
67:29 - there's gonna be a jump cut to where I
67:31 - have erased it and now what do I want to
67:41 - talk about so I have this a ring one of
67:46 - the things that I showed in a previous
67:48 - video okay so let's say this array is
67:49 - called bubbles because that's what it's
67:52 - called the whole array when apart the
67:56 - whole array I'm saying the word bubbles
67:58 - when I am referencing a specific element
68:01 - of the array I reference it by its index
68:03 - often within square brackets and the
68:06 - index numbers are 0 1 2 3 4 5 so this is
68:10 - bubbles in deck
68:12 - - now one of the things I showed in the
68:15 - previous video is that there is a
68:16 - function called push that function
68:20 - allows me to add something to the end of
68:23 - the array in fact there is also a
68:25 - function called pop and that function
68:28 - allows what it does is it will take
68:30 - something off the end of the array and
68:31 - pop it off so if what I wanted to do is
68:34 - always delete the last element of the
68:36 - array I could use the pop function now
68:39 - there are lots of other functions
68:40 - there's like shift I think there's even
68:42 - like an unshifted be crazy could just be
68:46 - making that up shift manager snow but
68:49 - here's I think where do these functions
68:51 - come from so there's this question that
68:53 - comes up over and over again in these
68:55 - videos and you're probably sitting there
68:57 - asking it to yourself wait a sec my
68:59 - learning JavaScript I know I sort of
69:01 - made me learning to code but I have my
69:03 - learning JavaScript my Lenape 5 is the
69:05 - same thing is it different well this is
69:08 - a complicated question and I would like
69:10 - in theory in my mind's eye I would like
69:12 - to say that these videos are just about
69:14 - learning to code and think about code
69:16 - and think computationally I happen to be
69:17 - using the programming language
69:18 - JavaScript I'm using this library p5.js
69:21 - to make the drawing stuff easier and it
69:23 - all kind of mixes together so that was
69:26 - kind of larger question aside this stuff
69:29 - that has to do with an array is not
69:31 - coming from p5 GS if I say ellipse this
69:36 - is a special function that's in p5.js
69:38 - what it does is it call some other
69:40 - functions that are just part of
69:41 - JavaScript without p5 GS but it's I can
69:44 - only say ellipse because I'm using a
69:45 - p5.js library these functions don't come
69:48 - from p5 yes they come they're just part
69:50 - of the JavaScript language so how do I
69:53 - find out a list of these and how I can
69:55 - use them come back over here with me
69:59 - alright so the place that I like to use
70:02 - is the Mozilla Foundation Docs I'm just
70:06 - saying Mozilla Foundation array
70:08 - JavaScript that's going to be my Google
70:10 - search and I'm gonna go here so this is
70:16 - here's the thing one of the reasons why
70:18 - I like using p5 Jessen tutorials is look
70:22 - here's the reference here's all the
70:24 - stuff it's kind of like one page if I'm
70:25 - actually
70:26 - stuff but it's kind of self-contained
70:29 - and it's it has a smaller world view so
70:32 - to speak it's like it's a walled garden
70:35 - so to speak this is like the JavaScript
70:38 - documentation there is so much here
70:41 - you couldn't possibly mean you could but
70:43 - it would be it would take you a long
70:44 - time to read through everything but here
70:46 - I am at least on a page that's giving me
70:48 - some information about arrays and you
70:51 - can see look Obeid there's this what is
70:54 - that oh my god okay it's a for each loop
71:03 - someday I'll have to come back and look
71:04 - at that and what does that do and why
71:06 - would you use it oh my god oh my
71:07 - goodness okay but you can see here look
71:09 - pop oh I'm not I'm not crazy shift
71:11 - on shift you can see what these
71:13 - functions do where are you you're over
71:15 - there
71:15 - and look there's a whole list of them so
71:17 - let's look through them maybe we can
71:18 - find one that removes something from an
71:20 - array pink at copy within entries every
71:25 - filter fine I got it go for each
71:29 - [Music]
71:33 - okay well looking for own so here's the
71:40 - thing us place I happen to know wouldn't
71:42 - it be nice to just be one that's called
71:44 - like delete or remove but the one that
71:46 - I'm looking for is this place and this
71:48 - method changes the contents of an array
71:50 - by removing existing elements and or
71:53 - adding elements it can do a lot of
71:56 - different things I want to use it for
71:57 - the deletion so if I come back over here
71:59 - I want to use this slice function so can
72:02 - I ran up here and you can see it yes
72:04 - slice slice takes two arguments and
72:09 - there may be other ways to use slice but
72:11 - for the purpose of this video tutorial
72:13 - the two arguments are what matters the
72:15 - first one is an index and the second one
72:18 - and I'm kind of moving sorry doing that
72:21 - thing where I'm drawing off the
72:22 - whiteboard gasps okay go to town here
72:24 - that's a little bit better
72:24 - the first one is it index the second one
72:27 - I'll just call how many so if I say
72:31 - slice index
72:32 - - how many comma 1 what it does is it
72:36 - just takes this element and slices it
72:39 - out removes it from the array let me
72:41 - show you what I need so one of the
72:45 - things that I could do to sort of
72:46 - investigate this is I could just use the
72:48 - JavaScript console here in the browser
72:50 - that I'm using right now and I could say
72:53 - let's words equal you know rainbow and
72:59 - unicorn and kitten I was gonna try to
73:06 - think this thing else turtle paper clip
73:12 - paper plinth words dot push paper clip
73:17 - okay so now we can see I have this array
73:20 - with five things in it and if I were to
73:23 - say words dot splice index 3 comma 1
73:28 - what should happen here 0 1 2 3 I should
73:34 - look at this whoops so one thing is
73:38 - interesting about slice is as it deletes
73:41 - it kind of like hands it back to you I'm
73:43 - not gonna use that in this video
73:44 - but it's kind of interest
73:45 - that it does that it's probably too much
73:47 - information here but if I look at the
73:49 - array words right now you'll notice
73:51 - turtle is gone it's just rainbow uniform
73:54 - kitten so the idea here is that even
73:57 - though I can do a lot with this slice
73:58 - function if I just want to delete one
74:00 - element from the array I could say hey
74:03 - this particular number index just that
74:07 - one and so that's what I want to do what
74:08 - I want to do is how could I then with
74:10 - this code example click on this and
74:15 - remove it actually delete it from the
74:17 - array well I know there's so much here
74:20 - you know what I should do here's the
74:22 - thing look at this function rollover hmm
74:25 - there's something kind of interesting
74:26 - about this function which is that I'm
74:28 - doing two things at once one thing is
74:32 - that I'm checking to see if the mouth if
74:33 - that point is inside that bubble and
74:36 - then I'm also changing its color and it
74:38 - probably makes more sense for me to have
74:40 - this function be much more generic for
74:42 - it just to like return true or false
74:45 - because I might want to reuse this ideas
74:47 - it was a point over that is a point over
74:50 - that object that circle other times so
74:53 - I'm gonna change this to return true
74:57 - whoops if if it's rolling over return
75:00 - true otherwise return false and then I'm
75:03 - gonna write a new function called change
75:05 - color and I'm going to say this dot
75:07 - brightness equals 255 so I wanted to
75:11 - remove the idea of the changing color
75:13 - from here because now I can say if write
75:18 - that function you might not have you you
75:21 - know I covered return what return means
75:23 - in my functions video tutorial but you
75:25 - know when do I ever need that well now I
75:27 - need it what I want to say but not
75:31 - remove I'm not removing it sorry a
75:33 - change color I'm that's what I'm gonna
75:35 - do eventually right I want to say and
75:38 - and maybe I shouldn't call it roll over
75:39 - anymore I should just say contains let's
75:41 - call it contains and i'ma change it to
75:44 - contains what I want to do right this
75:47 - function is going to return true or
75:48 - false and I know some of you are saying
75:49 - I could just return this this statement
75:53 - itself violates true or false so it's
75:55 - redundant to say if it's true return
75:57 - true
75:58 - if it's false return false I could just
76:00 - say return its value true or false I'll
76:02 - let you do that to simplify your own
76:04 - code as an exercise but now what I can
76:07 - do here this should be exactly the same
76:08 - program oh I have an error contains is
76:11 - not a function
76:12 - bubble index i contains mmm you know
76:16 - what is contain something oh boy
76:19 - am I not allowed to use the word
76:21 - contains what if I missed I think I
76:28 - might not be allowed to use the word
76:29 - contains I'm gonna sort it let's pause
76:32 - for a second here I keep closing this
76:34 - lecture includes as part of an array oh
76:47 - oh you're telling me the slice displays
76:51 - did I write slice okay record scratch
76:56 - sound do I have that hold on a second
76:58 - apparently I've done something horrible
77:00 - oh look at this this whole time maybe
77:04 - much good could do a magic thing where
77:06 - after I write slice he can fade it in
77:10 - this should say splice apologies this
77:12 - should say splice splice splice splice
77:17 - is the correct term I will leave that up
77:19 - there for a second and that's gonna have
77:22 - to get fixed I was saying slice that
77:25 - hump dub over my voice and then the
77:28 - function need to use is nice and after
77:31 - that to remove an element from the array
77:32 - please use splice no work right
77:37 - yes place is kind of a say can I do you
77:40 - slice but just say begin and end such as
77:42 - always the next one I really kept saying
77:46 - slice
77:55 - yeah maybe but we'll dub it that'll be
77:57 - good or I can just we could put a little
78:00 - like pop-up that says I should be saying
78:02 - splice their help how bad could it be
78:04 - thank you Matt huge fudge tree extra
78:07 - paper clips is something wrong with the
78:09 - paper clips now that I'm taking a break
78:11 - I can check them whoops oh shoot why is
78:15 - this contains not working oh I just
78:17 - didn't save it I can't look at the I
78:24 - can't look at the YouTube chat because I
78:25 - know they could be like messing with me
78:27 - but okay let's see let's let's just at
78:34 - least check wait oh there's here's the
78:36 - paper clips how's the paper clip string
78:37 - oh I ran out of inventory again I ran
78:40 - out of wire there's a thing that I can
78:42 - get for a Y first of all I definitely
78:43 - need these better Auto Clippers I'm
78:46 - gonna need a lot more wire well let me
78:48 - see if I get up to the marketing real
78:50 - quick if I could get up to the marketing
78:51 - before I go back well it's actually
78:54 - gonna be a pretty low number for those
78:56 - of you are guessing low although it
78:58 - might just sort of like explode at a
79:00 - certain point okay let me get the
79:03 - marketing so now I can raise the price
79:13 - why is mine no I want to know I okay I
79:18 - made a dollar 67 $3.00 per second am I
79:24 - making enough well let's really let's
79:27 - lower it but I need to make more
79:28 - Clippers and I've got more let me get
79:31 - some processors I can get the creativity
79:34 - now let me raise the price a little bit
79:39 - cuz I'm I really need the thing there's
79:41 - a thing that you can get which like auto
79:42 - buys wire whenever you run out which I'm
79:44 - definitely going to need because I'm oh
79:47 - because I'm just gonna I need to buy
79:51 - some more auto Clippers just to get this
79:54 - going faster
79:57 - that's a little bit better now because
79:59 - this you can see that I could get $3.00
80:01 - per second if I could make I guess I
80:03 - could go to four cents more of these I
80:12 - should really stop this right I need to
80:14 - come back okay this is good this is good
80:16 - we're at four cents I'm gonna just buy
80:20 - some more wire it's gonna run on a wire
80:22 - really fast I'm not making enough money
80:26 - okay let me just quickly buy a little
80:28 - bit more wire before I go back no it's
80:29 - fine I can't focus on this let's go back
80:31 - all right
80:34 - so actually I don't know how to I'm back
80:40 - after some mishegoss there but contains
80:46 - is fine I've got worried like a my
80:47 - overriding some built-in name but and
80:51 - that a my oh my hold on a sec do you
81:00 - think let's is object dot prototype dot
81:03 - contains objects dot prototype dot
81:06 - contains is that a function in
81:07 - JavaScript at something can contains no
81:14 - it's has own property is if it could so
81:16 - I think that's okay so I'm gonna just
81:18 - skip over that discussion I'm gonna go
81:21 - back to okay so so I'm gonna change this
81:28 - to contains which I just did and that
81:29 - didn't work but now I'm back because I
81:31 - just didn't save the file and whoops oh
81:34 - yeah no I do want that page and so now
81:37 - we're back to exactly what I had before
81:39 - but the point of what I was doing was
81:42 - that now that I've separated out the
81:44 - logic of just checking if a point is in
81:46 - something I can now in mousepressed I'm
81:49 - going to just grab this exact code and
81:51 - I'm gonna add mouse press back in so in
81:55 - mousepressed I can check hey does the is
82:00 - the mouse in there now this is when the
82:02 - mouse is pressed check again and then
82:04 - what do I want to do bubbles dot splice
82:08 - I comma one look
82:09 - that's beautiful look at this thing a
82:11 - beauty here I'm able to reuse that idea
82:13 - by saying okay just during draw all the
82:16 - time check if the mouse is over it if
82:18 - the mouse is over it changes color I
82:20 - know I spelled splice wrong in
82:23 - mousepressed when the mouse has been
82:24 - clicked anywhere check to see if it's in
82:27 - there if if you click on a particular
82:30 - bubble and if so delete it from the
82:31 - array which should cause it to disappear
82:33 - from the page and there we go now I kind
82:38 - of alright it doesn't
82:40 - oh I lost my change-back how did I lose
82:42 - that oh look at that I forgot she look
82:48 - interestingly enough I had this feature
82:50 - that one it doesn't and so what I
82:51 - probably should do here is give this an
82:53 - argument so I had this feature where it
82:56 - weight it changes to white when it's
82:58 - over back to black when it's not so I
83:00 - should probably give this change color
83:02 - function and argument like bright
83:04 - parameter bright and pass that in I did
83:07 - that kind of quickly but that fixes that
83:09 - and then I should be able to just delete
83:12 - all of them okay that's basically it now
83:19 - I feel like there's so many things I
83:20 - wanted to do with this we tried to think
83:24 - for a second yeah oh I'm missing an
83:29 - important point oh oh boy that's not it
83:33 - I'm missing kind of an important point
83:35 - and I did cover this there's a particle
83:37 - system coding challenge which does this
83:39 - but I I think I should talk about it
83:41 - here which is something strange just
83:43 - happened which is that I was iterating
83:48 - over the array
83:49 - I was checking elements zero then I was
83:52 - checking element two one sorry then I'm
83:54 - checking element two and at that little
83:57 - bit when I checked element two if that's
83:58 - the one that I clicked on and I should
84:00 - really call these I'm gonna call these
84:02 - a-b-c-d-e-f-g I pretend the particles
84:06 - have a letter because these index values
84:08 - are gonna change in a weird sort of way
84:09 - let me explain this again I'm checking a
84:12 - don't delete it I'm checking B don't
84:15 - delete it I'm checking C delete it so
84:17 - what happens next
84:20 - when I delete C
84:26 - the array all of a sudden looks like
84:29 - this one but it's got one fewer element
84:35 - in it so we don't need to race with my
84:37 - fingers and it's got a B no c d e f g 0
84:43 - 1 2 3 4 5
84:46 - what was the part with what was the
84:48 - bubble I last checked the last bubble I
84:50 - checked was 3 in index 2 so in my
84:53 - iterating I'm now going to was set it
84:56 - wrong
84:58 - what was the last bubble I checked the
85:01 - last bubble I checked was bubble C in
85:03 - index spot - right here so if I is going
85:08 - up by 1 the next thing it should check
85:10 - is index 3 and but this is what the
85:14 - array looks like now so if I check index
85:16 - 3 now I'm gonna check and see should I
85:18 - delete e what happened I didn't bother
85:21 - to check D because as soon as I removed
85:23 - C D becomes 2 got moves to index pot 2
85:27 - and my counter moves up so I could do
85:29 - something like if I could add like an
85:31 - eye - - so I could say like oh if I'm
85:33 - deleting something like set the index
85:35 - back to go check the next one there's a
85:38 - bunch of different ways around this
85:39 - probably if I use that for each loop
85:43 - [Music]
85:45 - maybe that would help me somehow but I
85:49 - actually in this case it doesn't matter
85:51 - because here's the thing it only would
85:53 - hopes over using that sound effect in
86:02 - this case it doesn't matter I you know
86:04 - if I look at this like there's nothing
86:06 - wrong nothing bad happens now you only
86:09 - would it only would be bad if it so
86:11 - happens that I tried to leak two of them
86:13 - at once and the other one that I delete
86:15 - happens to be the next one in the array
86:17 - so none of these are overlapping right
86:19 - now that's so let me try to leave both
86:21 - of these they both deleted but yeah I
86:22 - could get bad luck where the I'm
86:25 - hovering over both of these and so only
86:27 - this one gets to lead and then this one
86:28 - doesn't get checked so again I could
86:30 - decrement the index but another way I
86:33 - could do it is if I'm actually iterating
86:34 - through the array backwards it doesn't
86:36 - matter if I remove something and the
86:37 - array slides could chunks back over I'm
86:40 - still going towards the beginning I
86:41 - won't miss any so you'll see that in a
86:43 - lot of my code examples some people like
86:45 - to say I - - I prefer generally speaking
86:48 - - if I'm deleting stuff from the array
86:51 - to start at the end which is bubbles dot
86:54 - length minus one then have my iterator
86:58 - go down - - and then where am I where do
87:02 - I end I go all the way down to the first
87:04 - element which is at index zero the last
87:06 - element is the length minus one like if
87:08 - they're five of them zero one two three
87:10 - what four or five of them zero one two
87:13 - three four so start it 5-1 four go all
87:17 - the way down to zero so let's just make
87:19 - sure that this works and it does still
87:23 - the same exact result I can delete I can
87:25 - hover over and delete all of them so
87:28 - there you go
87:29 - this is a a little video about clicking
87:34 - and removing things from the array
87:36 - there's some other things for things I
87:37 - could do I you know here's the thing the
87:39 - point of me telling about this going
87:40 - backwards thing is more to say that hey
87:43 - if you are manipulating an array while
87:46 - you're iterating over it you should
87:48 - probably be careful what if for example
87:50 - I were adding elements to the array want
87:53 - it
87:53 - and I could maybe never get to the end
87:55 - right so anyway so this is really
87:57 - something that you need to think about
87:58 - so let's see what should you do in this
88:01 - video I have an idea something you could
88:02 - try is have HAP make a sketch where you
88:05 - can make as many bubble objects as you
88:07 - want but delete them when they've left
88:09 - the window you could try that you can
88:11 - also do something action I'm gonna do
88:12 - something for you right now which is
88:13 - kind of an interesting effect there's a
88:16 - little bonus for the end of the video
88:17 - that I think you could probably make
88:18 - something with let me save this timeout
88:22 - we think here I'm gonna make a new
88:24 - version of the code really quickly even
88:29 - though I've already messed that up I'm
88:33 - gonna make this Opie 5 I'm gonna check
88:37 - the chat why is this computer go to
88:39 - sleep filter filter still has the same
88:48 - issue ok for 8 look at hold on come back
88:51 - I'll come back to that so let me just
88:53 - give me a second I don't know why I'm
88:54 - stuck on demonstrating this but I think
88:56 - this is kind of useful so hold on a sec
89:05 - I want to demonstrate something real
89:07 - quick am I in five now so four there's
89:17 - one more thing I want to demonstrate
89:18 - here because I think it leads it lends
89:21 - itself to an interesting exercise before
89:22 - I do that for each apparently has the
89:24 - same problem but there are other fancy
89:25 - ways to remove things from an array okay
89:28 - um maybe I don't need to say that on my
89:30 - own
89:30 - so I really wanted just finished let me
89:34 - do this extra thing and we can decide
89:36 - whether it include it or not before I
89:38 - finish I want to add one I'm just gonna
89:40 - redo this example a little bit just to
89:41 - demonstrate one thing I'm going to put
89:43 - it back to the version of it which sorry
89:47 - which had me where I added bubbles
89:50 - whenever I drag the mouse so I'm gonna
89:54 - say Mouse dragged and I'm going to just
90:00 - I'm gonna add bubbles at the mouse
90:04 - and something like just give them all
90:08 - the same size just for simplicity right
90:10 - now so what I what this should do is
90:12 - give me back to this I'm kind of drawing
90:17 - with these bubble objects the reason why
90:18 - I'm showing you this is this I think
90:20 - might allow you to plea bit more playful
90:22 - and how you think about removing for
90:24 - example one thing I could do is I could
90:27 - say just if bubbles dot length is
90:32 - greater than is it's greater than well
90:36 - ten bubbles dot splice zero comma one
90:41 - so I'm saying like hey only just only
90:43 - ever have ten elements in that array and
90:45 - there's maybe there's a bigger news
90:46 - shift there to like remove just the
90:48 - first one but and you can see this is
90:50 - gives me this kind of like snake-like
90:51 - thing but notice as I let go each one of
90:55 - these is still an individual object now
90:56 - I've lost the clicking on it thing but
90:58 - and I can come back so that I think
91:00 - there's some more possibilities there's
91:01 - almost like a little object that's like
91:03 - a little thing that's storing its
91:05 - history and the reason why I talk of
91:06 - this is I have another video this is a
91:08 - kind of a hard exercise but um something
91:11 - good think about what if this were its
91:13 - own object and you had a bunch of these
91:14 - on the screen so I have another video
91:16 - that about object storing their own path
91:18 - that all that I'll link to from this
91:20 - video and so hopefully now you've got
91:23 - some ideas about how to remove things
91:24 - from an array thanks for watching
91:31 - alright I think I was worth keeping this
91:36 - video I feel like that was like a really
91:38 - long tutorial but probably just because
91:41 - it's been so long since I looked at the
91:44 - paper clips I'm sure I've run out of
91:46 - wire totally run out of wire by some
91:50 - wire what can I get let's get some more
91:55 - trust look what I want is I really want
91:59 - the thing where I can automatically I'll
92:01 - do this you slogan Oh marketing
92:04 - effectiveness so this is all good now I
92:06 - can add another processor and some more
92:08 - memory could buy some more wire I can
92:13 - buy some more auto Clippers
92:16 - really can lower the price a little bit
92:21 - raise the price there we go this is good
92:25 - Oh where's the price again buy some more
92:29 - Auto Clippers now I'm just clicking on
92:35 - stuff with no oh I have more processor
92:39 - more memory I really just want the thing
92:42 - that I could buy the wire automatically
92:44 - then I can let this go I'm at like
92:45 - 17,000 I think my inventory is kind of
92:48 - stabilized that's good buy some more
92:51 - wire buy some more wire buy some more
92:53 - wire buy some more wire by supplier and
92:56 - then I'm gonna go back to the tutorial
92:59 - stuff all right a little bit more Auto
93:03 - Clippers okay that's good enough for
93:04 - right now now wire will hopefully last
93:06 - us my inventory is stabilized let's go
93:09 - back the wire buyer comes at 7k7
93:15 - 7000 operations so actually I just need
93:19 - to I need to get this memory up to seven
93:23 - alright alright oh yeah 7000 down there
93:26 - so I definitely need that okay so let me
93:30 - talk about what I'm gonna do next so I
93:32 - have a hopefully like a little less than
93:33 - an hour left but I want to go back to
93:35 - the chat bot stuff and I'm gonna use
93:38 - this library call p5 speech so p5 speech
93:44 - p5 and so let me get this stuff out if
93:47 - you want github and I'm gonna go back to
93:50 - my chat I'm so I'm gonna that's gonna be
93:52 - enough for the object stuff today I
93:53 - still have more of those to make but I
93:55 - feel like it I like to be able to do
93:57 - both courses in the same live session so
94:02 - now I want to go to make a
94:12 - let me go to was it P 5g - beat generate
94:23 - - B speech 1 okay so now I have another
94:31 - and then let's run the server and what I
94:37 - want to do now is I'm gonna open instead
94:44 - the chat bot stuff in Adam I haven't
94:48 - Adam there it is and let me go to
94:54 - localhost oh I'm in the wrong I'm in the
94:58 - uh hold on a sec I mean the rock I mean
95:02 - the the did I get to 7000 wait wait hold
95:06 - on we're close let's please glad to get
95:09 - to 21,000 and the memory up to six oh I
95:20 - should definitely do this buy some more
95:25 - wire just because I can't in a little
95:27 - while later and I'll slower the price to
95:31 - five cents yeah we're doing well now
95:33 - alright so what I want to do now let's
95:42 - get to here and
95:51 - just get rid of this and say so um let
96:04 - me get I also want to do everyone can
96:07 - just bear with me for a second do I have
96:14 - I want to get my examples from my A to Z
96:19 - course I'm gonna need to reference them
96:21 - I don't know that oops so I just need to
96:25 - clone this repo real quick and let me
96:35 - let's just let's just see quickly let me
96:44 - just briefly see chatbots speech basics
96:52 - sketch let me just make sure this
96:58 - example works
97:09 - hmm whoops
97:19 - it's not loading the library p5 speech
97:25 - because I made it a sub-module because
97:28 - I'm a lunatic hold on everybody
97:31 - oh yeah well I know what to do I'm gonna
97:52 - do this in a bad way but it'll be fine
97:56 - so I need to get the I need to get the P
98:01 - I forgot that I didn't update this which
98:03 - I wish I had I'm going to go here and
98:10 - week and then I want to say get so I'm
98:16 - gonna say remove - our p5 Jess - speech
98:20 - and then I'm going to p5.js speech
98:31 - one of these days I will get all this
98:33 - stuff ready beforehand and now I need to
98:40 - clone this don't worry it's not this
98:42 - complicated to use it it's just the
98:44 - ridiculous way that I've set this up and
98:48 - so now my hope is that here okay now can
98:56 - you hear that but probably not so let me
99:09 - I need to fix the sound settings here
99:12 - sound multi output device I think will
99:16 - work a lot of coding trainer
99:18 - can you guys hear that now hello coding
99:22 - training how is the how's the volume
99:25 - there hello okay alright so so I want to
99:59 - make sure that this works and I'm gonna
100:03 - locally bring the locally bring the
100:05 - locally bring the locally brain all
100:09 - right
100:09 - so now what I'm going to do is do a
100:13 - tutorial about the speech library I'm
100:16 - gonna build something like this but not
100:19 - as fully fleshed out and so this having
100:25 - that open is great I mean this open this
100:28 - open I can close this this is the thing
100:38 - that I'm gonna this is the window for
100:39 - what I mean a code I can close
100:42 - this I can close this okay so Simon's
100:49 - saying the sound is layering over itself
100:51 - many times so just to confirm if i
100:57 - refresh this page is easy hello to Z
101:01 - it's normal
101:02 - read the chat hold on the audio is
101:04 - coming from two sources now well because
101:08 - you're hearing it through my microphone
101:10 - also yeah I can't really the problem is
101:15 - I can make this quieter Lauro to Z
101:17 - alright have an idea I kind of need to
101:23 - be able to hear it otherwise I don't
101:25 - know what's going on but I can change
101:27 - this volume hello Josie hello Josie so
101:34 - that's probably not so bad hello Josie
101:39 - once I lowered the volume of my laptop
101:42 - hello Josie is it okay yeah all right I
101:47 - don't want to make it a little bit
101:49 - louder because I can barely hear a Z so
101:51 - let me just try to make it a little bit
101:52 - louder let me just put it to the middle
102:01 - tell me if it's okay hello Josie hello
102:09 - Josie is this hello okay do I need to
102:12 - turn it back down not bad okay I could
102:25 - use headphones but that would be such a
102:27 - like complicated nightmare
102:32 - hey sean is in the chat already talked
102:35 - about ima John ok I already mentioned
102:37 - ima alright I'm just reading the slack
102:43 - channel where I know people are vaguely
102:46 - trustworthy there alright let's see ok
102:49 - so now I'm going to talk about the
102:54 - ability lab or the ability project
102:56 - I feel like it's called the ability
102:57 - project now yeah so I need to say
102:59 - ability project okay
103:04 - and Luke dupois all right so first let
103:08 - me say something about this before I go
103:10 - so I'm gonna do a tutorial where I talk
103:13 - about what this library is and who made
103:15 - it and show the basic features of it so
103:19 - there'll be three videos I don't
103:21 - hopefully I can do all this before I go
103:23 - one is just the basics for getting the
103:25 - browser to talk to you two is the basics
103:28 - for getting the browser to listen to you
103:30 - and say back but now now stay back
103:34 - listen to you and like recognize and
103:36 - convert it into text so text-to-speech
103:38 - and speech-to-text those are two videos
103:40 - the third one is I kind of want to make
103:42 - that into maybe I'll do the knock-knock
103:44 - joke thing I'll do a little chat bot
103:46 - knock-knock joke thing where it where
103:49 - you do it through voice so that's what
103:52 - I'm gonna do before I get there so this
103:54 - library is here in github it's under IDM
103:58 - which actually is another wonderful
104:00 - program at NYU called integrated digital
104:02 - media it's part of the Tandon school for
104:04 - engineering Luke Du Bois who was a
104:07 - wonderful artist I encourage you to
104:09 - check out his work is also is a
104:14 - professor there actually a director of
104:16 - the IDM program and created this library
104:18 - p5 speech and it is just a extension of
104:22 - the web speech like what comes I believe
104:24 - this so this I think you need to use in
104:26 - Chrome or if you use it a different
104:28 - browser you're sort of I think you're
104:30 - reliant on what the what the what the
104:33 - browser what the browser gives you so
104:38 - but what I wanted to say is this is part
104:40 - of a wonderful research group at NYU
104:43 - called the ability project and I guess
104:45 - they're the ability project is an
104:47 - interdisciplinary research space
104:48 - dedicated to the intersection between
104:50 - disability and technology so um you
104:53 - could imagine why speech detects insects
104:55 - text-to-speech is useful so I'm gonna
104:58 - say this again when I record the video
105:01 - that'll get edited later but the thing
105:03 - that I wanted to mention here is that
105:05 - this library is pretty new
105:07 - Luke implemented it I with the help of
105:10 - me I am so me recently just like changed
105:16 - some syntax stuff to make it a bit more
105:18 - a bit with the p5.js style but I this
105:21 - library could use probably some help I
105:22 - think there's some issues filed maybe
105:24 - you'll find some bugs if you're using it
105:26 - would love people to help contribute to
105:28 - this library I won't mention that I mean
105:30 - I'm and in particular something that we
105:32 - could use help with is that I updated
105:34 - those syntax and that's what I'm gonna
105:36 - use in the tutorial but I didn't take
105:40 - the time yet to update these examples
105:43 - with my new naming and syntax and update
105:47 - this documentation so if anybody wants
105:49 - to help with that it probably could use
105:50 - a little more thought in terms of the
105:52 - naming and the API could even be
105:54 - improved further but I want at least do
105:55 - a round of that before I made the videos
105:56 - so anyone who's interested in that
106:00 - please please participate and contribute
106:05 - to that okay okay I should check the
106:08 - paper clips right it's okay to check the
106:11 - paper clips now what could get marking
106:14 - level 200 I need to auto by I need to
106:19 - get that auto wire buying thing so could
106:23 - I possibly get up to what do I need to
106:25 - get 34,000 can we wait till I get to
106:27 - 34,000 we're making paper clips
106:36 - today paper clips today yes we're in the
106:40 - factory
106:43 - 33 thousand paper clips
106:46 - [Music]
106:53 - no that's a wire buyer 7,000 I just need
106:57 - 7,000 and I just need to get the 34,000
107:00 - so oh no 55,000 clips why didn't I think
107:03 - 34,000 I mean I could optimize the auto
107:08 - clip let me just buy a lot I have got I
107:10 - can buy a lot I'm gonna just fill up on
107:13 - wire he's all my money on wire then I'm
107:17 - gonna make my auto Clippers even better
107:19 - oh I get more trust
107:22 - there we go that's all I needed I get to
107:25 - trust the processor now you got to get
107:29 - to 7,000 there's no end to this you have
107:32 - no idea how far along I am on this other
107:34 - computer and yet here I am starting
107:36 - again I'll never be able to close this
107:38 - browser window ever it's more truss get
107:43 - some more processors to get up to 7,000
107:45 - how am I doing here four dollars four
107:47 - dollars per second that's pretty good
107:49 - inventory it looks kind of stable buy
107:54 - somewhere owner Clippers buy some more
107:55 - wire okay fine we've got to go do this
108:00 - tutorial I'll come back I'll get that in
108:03 - a second okay
108:11 - okay here we go alright so this video is
108:23 - going to go it's like ten point three or
108:26 - whatever in my chatbot series hello I am
108:32 - here again in my chat pot series I'm
108:34 - going to do two tutorials and then some
108:36 - other stuff about something called p5.js
108:38 - speech so I'm gonna get to what that is
108:40 - in a second but the reason why I'm doing
108:41 - this is as part of the chatbot series I
108:44 - want to investigate chatbots
108:47 - that a human can interact with by typing
108:50 - and chatbots that a human can interact
108:52 - with by speaking and so in order to do
108:54 - the speaking part without purchasing
108:57 - some kind of proprietary device from
108:59 - some company that's supposed to be your
109:02 - assistant or something like that all
109:04 - right which I will look at later
109:05 - eventually I want to see if we can do
109:07 - this in a bit more of an open-source way
109:09 - we looked at rive script can we just can
109:13 - we converse can we talk to the browser
109:14 - the web browser have it listened to what
109:16 - we're saying and talk back to us and the
109:18 - answer is yes and so there's a library
109:20 - for p5.js which is which was created by
109:23 - Luke Du Bois from the integrated digital
109:25 - media program at New York University
109:28 - standard school for engineering the
109:29 - ability project is part of the ability
109:31 - projects research which is an
109:32 - interdisciplinary research space then it
109:34 - came to the intersection between
109:35 - disability and technologies so it's a
109:37 - great program it's great research group
109:39 - you can you can imagine why speech to
109:42 - text and text to speech could be useful
109:44 - in this area for for for accessibility
109:49 - of different tools that exist on the
109:51 - Internet okay so there which is a really
109:52 - important topic so but I mean this video
109:55 - just want to kind of learn how the
109:56 - library works and kind of do a few
109:58 - playful things with it so this is the
110:00 - web page for the library I recently made
110:02 - some changes to the API the naming
110:04 - convention of some of these functions
110:06 - and so who what's it what's here right
110:09 - now might actually be different than
110:10 - what you see when you go to this page
110:11 - but so I'm going to use this new naming
110:13 - oh and this is a demonstration but I'll
110:15 - come back to that all right so let's
110:16 - just let's first look at how easy this
110:18 - is to use which I think it is it is it's
110:20 - easy it's gonna be easy and I just
110:23 - realized
110:24 - I'm gonna pause for a second because
110:26 - what I want to do is grab the library
110:30 - [Music]
110:33 - separate file desktop oops
110:37 - chat bot speech one library's so so the
110:51 - first thing that you want to going to
110:52 - want to do is actually download the job
110:55 - the library from github itself and I
110:57 - will provide in this video's description
110:58 - a link to where you can download that
111:00 - javascript file you can see that I've
111:02 - downloaded is here already and it's part
111:04 - of my project now how you end up
111:06 - incorporating this library into your
111:09 - example it can be different depending on
111:10 - what text editor or development
111:12 - environment you're using and hopefully I
111:14 - can help you with that
111:14 - but for the way that I'm working right
111:16 - here is I just have all the people I've
111:17 - just libraries and I'm adding p5 speech
111:20 - KS and I've got to make sure all so then
111:22 - I go to my sorry I go to my index.html
111:28 - file associated with that this sketch
111:30 - and go right here copy paste this and
111:34 - I'm just gonna add a reference to p5
111:36 - speech touch ass so let's even see if
111:38 - that does anything we go back to the
111:41 - browser hit refresh okay
111:44 - nothing but at least I'm not I don't get
111:45 - I'd not having an error so what's the
111:47 - what's the basic sorry let me look at
111:53 - the most okay let me look at the most
111:56 - basic thing I can do with p5 speech and
112:00 - if I go to the get up try the Kip sorry
112:03 - let me open up this computer that keeps
112:05 - going to sleep let me look at the most
112:12 - basic thing that you can do with the
112:14 - speech library which is just have the
112:16 - browser speak so if I go to the github
112:18 - page and I look down here this is kind
112:21 - of just a little bit of code so I'm
112:22 - gonna grab this I'm gonna go to my
112:26 - sketch KS in setup I'm going to add and
112:30 - I'm gonna change this to let and I'm
112:32 - gonna say have it's a coding train so
112:36 - what I need to do and I think
112:38 - is gonna be okay there's the there's a
112:41 - bunch of a variety of issues that I'm
112:42 - going to show you and things that you
112:43 - could do but just just for the basic
112:45 - idea I need to create a p5 speech object
112:49 - voice equals new P v dot speech and I
112:52 - just need to call voice dot speak let's
112:54 - just see if this works
112:55 - ah this is something I'm gonna show you
112:59 - in a minute
113:00 - coding train did you hear that coding
113:03 - train it speaks to me okay so that's
113:07 - basically it so one of the nice things
113:09 - is I'm done like if I have some text you
113:12 - know I could have a whole interactive
113:13 - system when I click the mouse or I do
113:15 - this button or whatever and it's then it
113:16 - speaks it doesn't speak it could say
113:18 - anything the text could be generative it
113:19 - could use any of my you know weird crazy
113:21 - like generate poetry examples but there
113:25 - the reason why I this not gonna just end
113:27 - this video right now is the library
113:29 - actually provides a bunch of other
113:31 - features now these features are
113:33 - dependent on the web speech API and if I
113:36 - understand it correctly you're kind of
113:39 - limited to what the browser supports so
113:41 - which voices are available does it
113:43 - actually work so I'm doing this all in
113:45 - Chrome on a Mac and I imagine some of
113:47 - you might try this in different browsers
113:48 - a different operating systems so let me
113:50 - know what works and what doesn't work
113:51 - maybe we can contribute to the library
113:53 - if it doesn't work in a certain browser
113:55 - to help it work but again the browser
113:56 - has to support the web speech feature
113:59 - and okay but one of the things you can
114:02 - do is actually change the voice so let's
114:05 - let's look at how I might do that so I
114:08 - think I can say something like
114:11 - console.log voice dot voices so in this
114:15 - voice object I probably I'll call this
114:17 - speech just to be less confusing there
114:21 - is a property which is a list of all of
114:23 - the different voices that are supportive
114:26 - so let's hit refresh and look at this of
114:29 - poises not defined
114:31 - all right speech coding trainer but look
114:35 - it's empty
114:36 - so here's the thing you don't have to
114:38 - wait for it to be ready if all you want
114:42 - to do is use the default voice but if
114:44 - you want to try a different voice you
114:46 - need a callback a vend callback that
114:48 - says like hey i've loaded all the other
114:51 - possible
114:51 - and the way that you do that is by
114:53 - passing in an argument to the new p5
114:56 - speech constructor I can say something
114:58 - like voice ready then I can write a
115:02 - function called voice ready and in that
115:07 - function I can console.log speech type
115:11 - voices I think this is gonna work
115:13 - coding train so now we can see this
115:16 - whole list of voices and witty what
115:19 - there's a lot of them like there's 82 of
115:21 - them and what's one that I might want to
115:22 - be interested in look they all have
115:24 - names so we could look here and the name
115:27 - is actually important it's the key word
115:30 - you can use to assign a different voice
115:31 - I happen to know there's one called
115:33 - cellos I think so one thing I want to
115:36 - just add here is I'm just gonna add the
115:37 - mouse pressed function and in the mouse
115:42 - press function I'm going to say speech
115:45 - speak coating train so let's just make
115:48 - sure this works
115:49 - oops ah so I need to make speech a
115:52 - global variable let speech timeout
116:08 - now we need to make speech global
116:10 - variable it did that hit refresh coding
116:14 - train coding train coding trains but
116:17 - every time I click the mouse it speaks
116:18 - but in theory now I should be able to
116:21 - say let's just try assigning a voice
116:24 - speech dot voice that's what was the one
116:30 - I just looked at was called Moira let's
116:32 - let's look at in a different random one
116:34 - Alice let's try Alice now I don't know
116:38 - if this is right let's see if this is
116:39 - right I don't remember their speech that
116:44 - voice is not a function pause I forget
116:48 - what it is but look at my example which
116:52 - I forgot cuz I don't remember the naming
116:55 - of the functions normally I would just
116:57 - go and look in the reference but I
116:59 - didn't speak set voice that's a much
117:05 - better name so it's not voice I should
117:12 - remember this it's set voice I could say
117:15 - set voice Alice clothing today clothing
117:19 - today so there's Alice one of my
117:21 - favorites I think it's called cellos I'm
117:29 - sorry
117:30 - three beings are weird I can barely hear
117:34 - that voice but it makes me want to do
117:36 - something when I hear at the cellos um
117:38 - so let's just do something one thing I
117:40 - could emphasize here is if these are the
117:42 - voices I could say let voices equal
117:46 - speech voices then I could say let voice
117:51 - equal random voices so the random
117:54 - function in p5 will pick a random
117:56 - element from the array and I could do
117:57 - set voice I could probably actually just
117:59 - say set voice the voice or set
118:01 - voiced/unvoiced name let's see if it
118:03 - works with just that voice object so I'm
118:05 - going to say console.log voice name so
118:09 - now we'll get a random on each time
118:12 - coding train coding train coding train
118:16 - noting train it's the same voice so I
118:18 - think we might actually have to say set
118:20 - voice
118:21 - voice that name-calling train codes in
118:29 - plain gold ink so now you can hear all
118:33 - the different speech that all the
118:35 - different voices I'm not going through
118:37 - all them but I'm just picking a random
118:38 - one each time all right what are some
118:40 - other things you might want to do well
118:43 - let me add a canvas here this is like
118:45 - that's really useful create canvas let's
118:48 - say 400 comma 100 and what I want to do
118:51 - is I want to display some information
118:54 - like I want to animate something when
118:56 - this when the browser is speaking and
118:58 - not animate when it's not speaking so
119:00 - there are some callbacks if I could just
119:02 - remember what they are
119:03 - speech dot start did maybe start
119:10 - speaking and speech dot ended and ended
119:17 - and speaking I think these are so this
119:20 - is just like with the Dom library if
119:22 - we've used the p5 Dom library where you
119:24 - have like a slider or a button and if
119:26 - you have a callback that you assigned if
119:28 - you press on the button or if you move
119:30 - the slider I'm now assigning a callback
119:32 - and I might have gotten these names
119:33 - wrong I'm gonna fix them if I got them
119:35 - wrong but I'm assigning a callback to
119:37 - when when the browser starts speaking
119:40 - and when it ends speaking and so this
119:41 - means I need to write these functions so
119:43 - I could say start speaking background
119:47 - green and then function and speaking
119:52 - that and this is I'm not doing anything
119:54 - sophisticated in terms of the draw loop
119:56 - or any animation but you could imagine
119:57 - doing something background 0 and let's
120:00 - say background zero when it starts so
120:03 - now if I load the page building frame oh
120:06 - yeah it's working
120:07 - I have this whatever so that canvas
120:17 - turns green whenever the voice is
120:19 - speaking so that's a useful thing you
120:21 - can do and the other thing you can do
120:22 - which is kind of nice is you can change
120:25 - three things the rate the pitch and the
120:30 - volume and I believe
120:35 - so I believe it's like set volume so if
120:37 - I made it like point one it should be
120:38 - very quiet set rate so let's let's
120:43 - actually let's just so volume you can
120:45 - imagine I believe the range is between
120:47 - zero and one it might be something else
120:49 - but we could look that up or experiment
120:51 - with it but let's forget about the
120:52 - volume for a second because I want you
120:53 - to be able to hear it
120:54 - let's try it set rate and what I'm gonna
120:56 - do now is not give it a random voice
120:59 - anymore because I want it to be able to
121:01 - recognize what it's doing so let's take
121:03 - out the set voice so it's gonna be the
121:05 - default voice now oops
121:07 - set rate is not a function timeout so
121:13 - what is it
121:14 - Oh set rate is a function set rates the
121:18 - fonts are pitch Oh set rate is not my
121:26 - naming is a bit confusing set rate is
121:29 - something that you assigned to the
121:30 - speech object itself the voice is the
121:33 - you know each voice doesn't have its own
121:35 - rate it's the rate that it's currently
121:37 - gonna speak with that voice so I'm just
121:38 - doing this wrong because I this should
121:40 - be speech set rate tota trainer Tony
121:44 - trainer so you hear that twice as fast
121:46 - right and if I were to say 0.5 coding
121:51 - train coding train it's much slower and
121:54 - then I could also I can also say speech
121:56 - dot set pitch I don't know what the
121:59 - range is for this I should I'm gonna
122:01 - just say 5 just to see anyway so you get
122:13 - the idea let's put this the rate back to
122:15 - 1 and put the pitch to like 0.2 coding
122:19 - training coding training Oh coding
122:24 - training I wonder if I need to give it a
122:26 - negative number coding training coding
122:31 - train so I'm trying to make the pitch
122:33 - lower Kodu tree yeah that's definitely
122:39 - higher coda tree so I wonder and one
122:43 - would be the default I say right coding
122:44 - training coding train
122:48 - I don't know how to make it lower
122:50 - timeout a second look anybody know I'm
122:57 - looking in the slack channel here set
122:59 - volume set rates that Leto set Lang set
123:05 - voice voice doesn't seem to use anything
123:10 - from oh but there's a list voices
123:12 - function shy I probably should have used
123:14 - that so that's good to a fraction
123:18 - try-try decimals right because it might
123:22 - demo I'm pretty sure let me look at this
123:25 - for a second hello Josie this is my demo
123:31 - hello coding train hello coding training
123:35 - oh hello coding training it is lower
123:39 - it's just I'm not slowing it down at
123:41 - hello coding train so yeah I think it is
123:47 - lower I'm just not really noticing it
123:48 - maybe it'll be more obvious with a local
123:50 - ding thing yeah but the difference in
123:53 - the coding train
123:54 - yeah with a different coding thing yeah
123:58 - so let me let me do the cellos voice see
124:02 - if that works well alright let's double
124:17 - back quite a bit Matt yeah when we edit
124:20 - this because I was like testing stuff
124:22 - quite a bit we'll just go to the pitch
124:29 - so I think what's happening here is this
124:31 - particular voice it's sort of hard to
124:33 - pick up the lower pitch so one thing I
124:36 - could do is just try let's assign a
124:40 - specific voice let's try that voice
124:42 - Alice and let's listen to that whoops
124:48 - I'm the wrong and let's listen to that
124:52 - clothing today coding today and now let
124:56 - me set the pitch to lower good evening
124:59 - yeah this voice you can hear it a bit
125:02 - it's a bit more obvious just with this
125:03 - voice no that's a higher pitch
125:06 - so set pitch set rate those are things
125:09 - you can play play with I just realized
125:11 - by the way that I believe if I say
125:15 - speech dot list voices that's a function
125:19 - which will actually just give me an
125:21 - array with all the voice names so this
125:23 - actually would have been a little bit
125:24 - more useful like if I say list voices
125:26 - and then I don't need this extra voice
125:29 - dot name thing and I can just say voice
125:34 - so now I could just pick around I don't
125:36 - need all the other aspects of the voice
125:38 - the full voice object I just want the
125:39 - list of all the names and I'm gonna take
125:41 - this out and let's just see now we're
125:43 - back to coding train coding train oh I'm
125:47 - whoops
125:50 - coding train coding train
125:53 - well what happened what's happening here
126:00 - what just happened here coding train
126:03 - whoa
126:04 - am I like editing the wrong sketch why
126:07 - is it printing everything out
126:15 - start speaking and speaking voice ready
126:24 - coding training 20 slide 2600 this is
126:31 - not I did something wrong
126:39 - coding training waitlist voices is it
126:44 - just I thought that what did I say
126:54 - Oh oh it just lists them in the console
126:57 - it doesn't actually return the array so
127:01 - nevermind forget that whole thing I mean
127:03 - that might be a nice thing to probably
127:04 - make sense to adjust the library to
127:06 - return the array that's just doing a
127:08 - fingerprint to the console I didn't
127:09 - realize that so scratch that whole
127:11 - little like spiel I gave and let's just
127:22 - and I don't need a second it is a little
127:25 - silly that I made this like separate
127:26 - variable whatever okay sorry oh where
127:29 - was I sorry to scratch that whole part
127:34 - coding trainer so let me put it back to
127:39 - where it picks a random voice and sorry
127:43 - hold on this was commented up so let me
127:50 - put it back to where it says a random
127:52 - voice so now the code this is the code
127:54 - that I'll release a different different
127:58 - voice each time but I want to show you I
128:00 - have another example that I'll link to
128:01 - which actually sorry pause why did I
128:07 - close it
128:09 - lol chazzy
128:16 - I have another example that I will link
128:20 - to as well which just has a bit more so
128:23 - this is an example I'm not gonna go
128:24 - through coding all this but as an
128:25 - exercise this might be something you try
128:27 - this is an example that takes all of
128:29 - those voice names and puts them in a
128:31 - drop-down menu so I could pick bells I
128:36 - can you know I can change the rate I can
128:44 - change the pitch this one is a weird one
128:51 - it's catching up I press the button to
128:54 - any time so the cue of its speaking I
128:55 - kind of so anyway so I encourage you to
128:57 - check out the code that drives this
128:59 - particular demo there's some other
129:01 - examples that are part of the p5.js
129:03 - github repository I mean p5 jest speech
129:05 - get a repository as well so see what you
129:07 - can make make something that talks to
129:09 - you in the browser and let me know how
129:11 - it is in the next video I'm going to do
129:12 - is have the browser listen to what I'm
129:14 - saying
129:15 - and print out in the browser itself what
129:18 - I'm saying okay so this was
129:21 - text-to-speech right and I want to do
129:24 - speech to text in the next video thanks
129:25 - for watching alright so what did I miss
129:34 - [Music]
129:36 - Oh point oh one two two thank you for
129:41 - clarifying that stuff for me alright
129:42 - where are we five fifteen I won't try to
129:45 - get this so I definitely want to do that
129:47 - now let's check the check the paper
129:49 - clips alright I can get the wire buyer
129:53 - which I definitely need so now at least
129:56 - it'll by wire I have so much more I can
130:00 - get more memory and a little bit more
130:02 - processor oh I'm almost a quantum
130:05 - computing that's good and it needs some
130:08 - more auto clippers for sure I mean just
130:11 - oh I should get more marketing oh my god
130:14 - I have so much money
130:15 - more Clippers let's just like use up
130:20 - everything here and now five cents is
130:24 - still pretty good based on looks like
130:26 - this is kind of staying pretty even
130:27 - seven dollars per
130:29 - second if I lower the price it's more
130:32 - per second but that's gonna drain my
130:34 - inventory but I can just get more auto
130:36 - clippers
130:39 - I think I'll raise the price to five oh
130:43 - boy yeah it's like it's really really
130:48 - touch-and-go they're here like I want I
130:51 - need this to sort of balance out as
130:53 - having some extra inventory let's try
130:55 - this but now I'm not selling as much
130:59 - some more Auto Clippers just like a
131:01 - couple more Oh
131:02 - let's double the marketing effectiveness
131:03 - that's that's a look at that that was
131:06 - good but now I really just need to make
131:08 - more stuff let's raise the price again
131:12 - let's do it ten cents eleven cents
131:16 - twelve cents okay I need some more Auto
131:21 - Clippers okay I'm gonna have to leave
131:23 - this gonna have to leave this where are
131:25 - we 154,000 okay let's go back to a
131:27 - speech-to-text all right that's pretty
131:29 - good oh hello are you were still
131:31 - watching are you still there is the
131:33 - could you possibly still be there 200k
131:37 - all right all right where's my water you
131:41 - know what the problem is I'm not staying
131:42 - hydrated so I need to do p5
131:47 - text-to-speech let's do that so let me
131:55 - get the demo of that and see if that's
131:59 - working this is kind of interfere
132:02 - interfering pattern okay let's go here
132:10 - hello how are you
132:19 - are you listening to me one two three
132:30 - test four five six
132:34 - hello mmm what am I doing wrong that I'm
132:39 - not getting
132:41 - did I turn the continuous thing off so
132:44 - hold on we've got a little bit of an
132:46 - issue here did I break something in the
132:49 - library continuous true I want that not
132:53 - one time only I don't want to use the
132:57 - interim results is this not actually
133:00 - setting hold on did I mess something up
133:04 - in the library where it's not actually
133:09 - doing it oh look at this
133:11 - so I messed up something in the library
133:14 - so there's probably a bug in the library
133:16 - that we're gonna have to pull request
133:17 - but I should be able to fix this now
133:19 - it's my fault because I made changes to
133:23 - the library and what I'm looking for now
133:26 - I'm gonna fix the library Oh call back
133:29 - no wait so where's the okay hold on set
133:34 - what was that function called where am I
133:39 - here right no I want to go to this one
133:42 - I'm looking at start the start function
133:47 - Oh where's so let's look for start
134:00 - there it goes oh I could have sworn I
134:09 - don't know I must have messed this up
134:11 - but this is the definition for the start
134:14 - function and what I want is continuous
134:17 - and interim results and like I want
134:24 - instead of having it be variables that
134:26 - you said I thought the function could
134:28 - just set the values let me just do this
134:37 - right now and have to think about a
134:39 - better way to put this into the library
134:41 - but hopefully this will fix this
134:45 - hello one two three four
134:51 - hey great alright so this is working now
134:59 - it's what I'm not doing
135:00 - I don't have I have continuous on but
135:03 - not interim results so weirdly it's not
135:05 - gonna do the speech of text until I
135:06 - pause but it listened to everything I
135:12 - said and waited till I pause which which
135:14 - is pretty good well I'm quite impressed
135:16 - with how well this works all right so
135:20 - now we need to make this example
135:22 - basically so which is a pretty simple
135:26 - example to make but I need to also so
135:29 - we're gonna have to me I am semi if
135:31 - you're watching maybe you can help me
135:33 - figure out to pull request to the
135:36 - library because I broke the library or
135:38 - somebody watching could just pull
135:40 - request to it already
135:42 - but I think the reason why I'm not so
135:44 - sure it's like it's possible let me if
135:46 - you guys don't mind humoring me for a
135:48 - second I'm going to so in theory there
135:52 - are also these instance variables which
135:56 - should get set to these values and they
136:05 - should have a default can I like can I
136:07 - do that if it's not es6 so I'm going to
136:10 - do
136:11 - continuous sort of silly or false I
136:15 - don't know I don't know the best way to
136:17 - write this so I think the default should
136:20 - be I mean maybe the default should be
136:22 - true right when do you only want to get
136:25 - one thing I don't know but the interim
136:28 - results this should be the default
136:35 - definitely be false and then I can so
136:38 - that let me just make sure this still
136:39 - works
136:40 - I messed something up sketched a chest
136:45 - line 18 Oh
136:46 - continuous is not defined okay 1 2 3
136:54 - test 4 5 6 test coding rainbow coding
137:07 - rainbow alright
137:12 - I'm great so I think it's gonna just
137:15 - keep listening to me no matter what I
137:17 - say so anybody watching this who feels
137:23 - like contributing to the library and at
137:24 - least at a minimum needs this fix but I
137:27 - have to think through whether this is
137:28 - the correct fix let's see here so now I
137:34 - need to do is copy paste this into this
137:37 - is my demo that I need to reference I
137:41 - can close and I need to go into speech
137:44 - oh no I need to make another example oh
137:47 - boy too many things are doing here
137:49 - speech 1
137:56 - speech recognition let's just do that
138:01 - this is speech speech to speech
138:08 - speak and what I need to do is cop close
138:15 - everything because I messed everything
138:17 - up don't save and what I want to do is
138:22 - work on this sketch and I need to go to
138:28 - my example code in case I need to
138:31 - reference something so shut that open
138:34 - and this open and then I also need to
138:38 - take this fixed version of the p5.js
138:41 - library and where do I want to put that
138:44 - I want to put that in the example that
138:49 - I'm building now in libraries here okay
138:55 - I think I'm okay I think I've done
138:57 - everything that I meant to do save close
139:00 - so this is my reference this is that
139:02 - what I'm gonna make okay so I need to
139:05 - get rid of everything here
139:20 - and let me look at this code just so I
139:25 - remember so I make a new piece I've
139:27 - speech recognition object give it a
139:30 - callback then I sell it to start with
139:33 - the properties that I want and then I
139:35 - just used the callback and we can
139:37 - investigate what's in there okay great
139:39 - this is going to be really easy actually
139:40 - this is gonna be a pretty short video I
139:43 - almost don't need that but I'm gonna
139:45 - leave it there to reference and then I
139:46 - need to go back to the browser and go to
139:50 - here and we're good
139:52 - all right everybody you guys with me let
139:54 - me check the chat oh yeah
140:00 - Tim this buddy had a great point I did
140:02 - the worst thing ever
140:03 - okay I did a terrible terrible thing so
140:07 - my fix for the library is horrific
140:10 - so let me at least not do that right now
140:14 - it should only be if it's undefined so
140:18 - let me fix this this is worth looking at
140:22 - right now so so this is terrible because
140:28 - if I pass in false because I want
140:31 - continuous to be false that's good about
140:33 - to false it's gonna set it to true so
140:36 - that this really doesn't work I need to
140:37 - say if couldn't continuous equals
140:44 - undefined
140:45 - that's if I didn't give it an argument
140:48 - then I could set continuous if I wanted
140:53 - to make the default true maybe the
140:54 - default should be false and then this
141:00 - dot continuous would not would just be
141:07 - this right this should fix it again I'm
141:10 - not suggesting this is the most elegant
141:11 - solution but this should be if you
141:13 - didn't bother to define it then set it
141:16 - to true otherwise if you defined it as
141:19 - false it will be false okay I think that
141:21 - should fix it I'm just gonna kind of
141:23 - hope that I did this correctly why is it
141:25 - so cuz I was looking for or okay
141:34 - oh yeah alkis giving me a a better way
141:39 - to write it so why why while I'm here
141:45 - I'm gonna do I'm gonna do that so this
141:52 - is another way to write it
141:54 - I'm gonna thank you to Alka in the chat
141:57 - with Doc continuous equals continuous
142:02 - beep undefined oh my god
142:06 - true oh I can't bear it : continuous
142:10 - commented out because I might have
142:12 - gotten it wrong and I'll come back to
142:14 - looking at that later
142:15 - so the what's that what that operator
142:16 - called the question mark oh I am trying
142:21 - to use es6 but the p5.js project hasn't
142:24 - like fully adopted es6 yet so the
142:26 - libraries are often written with
142:27 - previous to es6 syntax so while I'm
142:30 - working on this library I'm just keeping
142:32 - with es5 stuff all right well let's make
142:34 - this let's make this project a little
142:37 - worried that the I'm gonna just turn the
142:39 - camera on and off so it doesn't do it in
142:40 - the middle
142:49 - and I'm going to you I'm gonna have my I
142:57 - might as well have the example running
143:00 - while I'm talking cuz it'll be kind of
143:02 - interesting whoops
143:14 - hello and welcome to a video about I put
143:22 - the mouse in front about speech to text
143:25 - or speech recognition so this is part 2
143:27 - the previous video I okay I'm gonna stop
143:33 - waiting for it now in the previous video
143:35 - I looked at how to take text and have
143:37 - the browser speak it with a variety of
143:39 - different voices using the p5 speech
143:41 - library which is built on top of the web
143:42 - speech API in this video I'm going to
143:45 - look at the p5 speech library but
143:47 - text-to-speech or speak recognition
143:49 - which is actually quite an easy thing to
143:51 - do with the library now how you work out
143:53 - the interaction and how it works that's
143:55 - a the design is a the design problem is
143:58 - hard but that technically getting the
144:00 - library to work is pretty easy alright
144:05 - so I'm basically gonna this is an
144:07 - example running I'm going to try to
144:08 - build this example from scratch to look
144:09 - at how this works and I'm going to close
144:11 - this window around so this is an empty
144:13 - sketch right now and the first thing I
144:15 - want to do is create I'll make it a
144:17 - global variable a speech recognition I'm
144:22 - just gonna call it speech rec so I'm
144:24 - gonna create a variable called speech
144:25 - rec for speech recognition and I'm gonna
144:28 - say speech rec equals new p v dot speech
144:32 - rec so that's the name of the object
144:34 - that's built into library I've already
144:36 - downloaded an import of the library to
144:38 - this project I talked about how to do
144:40 - that in the previous video so the
144:42 - library is already available to me the
144:43 - p5 Jess speech library now let me run so
144:46 - ok no errors I'm refreshing the page no
144:49 - errors so here's the thing when when
144:54 - what we need a callback there's an event
144:56 - so whenever the speech recognition
144:57 - object has decided its listen to what
145:00 - you've said and knows what it is it's
145:03 - going to trigger an event just like a
145:04 - mousepressed event or a mouse-over event
145:06 - so i'm going to call that event got
145:08 - speech and I'm gonna write a function
145:10 - got speech I'm gonna give it an argument
145:15 - and I'm just gonna say console.log so
145:18 - the idea here is that this function will
145:22 - will trigger it will run every time
145:25 - speech library things okay I heard what
145:27 - you said I've got it into text let me
145:29 - give it to you and I just want to put it
145:31 - into the console right now I do need one
145:33 - more line of code though I need to
145:34 - explicitly say I want the speech
145:36 - recognizer to start and so here speech
145:40 - recognizer start now if I just call dot
145:44 - start it's gonna start with some default
145:46 - settings but there's two important
145:48 - settings that I want to mention to you
145:49 - one is called continuous I'm gonna make
145:52 - that true and one is called interim
145:55 - results I'm just making up variables
145:57 - just to store the values true and false
145:59 - I could just write true and false right
146:01 - into the start function but naming them
146:03 - so we know what they are continuous
146:05 - means that without continuous it's just
146:07 - gonna listen to your speech one time at
146:09 - one time only and then it's gonna be
146:11 - done if you want to listen to somebody
146:13 - over time you want continuous to be true
146:15 - which is what I want and interim results
146:18 - is the funny thing and it's I haven't
146:19 - fully figured out how to get this
146:21 - behavior to work really well but you'll
146:23 - notice when I was demoing it before it
146:26 - would waited until I paused before it
146:28 - gave me what it recognized if I set
146:30 - interim results to true it's gonna try
146:32 - just keep giving me information as I'm
146:34 - speaking so we'll try it with true in a
146:36 - minute but let's leave that as false and
146:37 - these are by the way at the moment the
146:40 - libraries default settings although that
146:42 - could change I suppose if the library
146:44 - API changes okay so this is kind of all
146:47 - the code Redeem easiest coding tutorial
146:50 - video ever we have to see if this works
146:52 - now one thing is again you need to have
146:54 - a browser that supports the web speech
146:57 - API is probably gonna work immediately
147:00 - for me but if you put this on a web page
147:01 - or if you use it in different contexts
147:03 - it's going to ask for your microphone
147:05 - and you probably that also probably
147:07 - means it has to be on a secure website
147:08 - one that's hosted with HTTPS so there's
147:11 - a bunch of like security all sorts of
147:13 - requirements here I'm kind of bypassing
147:14 - that as I know it's just gonna work in
147:16 - the environment that I've set it up at
147:17 - least I hope it's gonna work
147:18 - so now let me hit refresh oh uncaught
147:22 - reference continuous is not defined
147:24 - I cannot spell the word continuous
147:26 - continuous continuous oh wait first of
147:33 - the steak of the p5 library if you guys
147:36 - speech library because before I recorded
147:38 - this video I was messing
147:39 - and I just made a mistake so I'm gonna
147:41 - disappear and come back in a second
147:47 - seriously I corrected it with the wrong
147:49 - I still have a spelling error can't in
147:56 - u.s.
148:09 - I'm back and I fixed that error and one
148:13 - thing you'll notice is now this red
148:15 - light is flashing up here this is
148:16 - something that Chrome will do to let you
148:19 - know that it is listening that the
148:21 - microphone is on so the microphone is on
148:23 - and let's say I've been talking for a
148:25 - little while this open let me just pause
148:27 - it's very hard for me to stop speaking
148:29 - sometimes but I'm going to stop right
148:31 - now
148:34 - so this thing appeared here in the
148:36 - console what appeared in the console
148:38 - it's this this object there's a whole
148:40 - object there what's in the object let's
148:43 - look at it it's got a confidence score
148:46 - this is really good how sure is it that
148:49 - it figured out what you were saying
148:50 - accurately so 92 percent confidence
148:53 - that's good the highest would be 100%
148:54 - it's got success it's the success which
148:56 - is like did it work that could be true
148:58 - or false and it's got the text there
149:00 - also is this object called data which
149:02 - has lots of other information timestamp
149:05 - and all sorts of stuff that's coming
149:06 - from the browser but the the things that
149:08 - you really want or did it work what did
149:10 - I say and how confident are you and I
149:14 - got another one
149:15 - so let's let's do something right now
149:17 - let's just say create P speech dot txt
149:21 - so I just want to make a new paragraph
149:22 - element on the page with whatever and
149:24 - and if I want to be really sure about
149:26 - this I'm going to say if speech dot
149:27 - success so make sure that's true create
149:30 - P with speech text and now I'm gonna
149:35 - refresh the page hello
149:43 - unicorn nangou reindeers are better than
149:51 - people why don't that song in my head oh
149:58 - my goodness did you think that learning
150:04 - oh that's the old Sun I can't anyway the
150:05 - point is I think this is working I lost
150:07 - I got lost in my own thoughts and I'm
150:09 - like the computers talking to me I
150:15 - stopped working oh yeah
150:20 - so maybe it just didn't have success a
150:22 - couple times so you get the idea
150:23 - interesting interesting
150:24 - okay we're in good shape here you know
150:30 - what actually is happening when I look
150:31 - this way I think I'm kind of quieter
150:33 - than when looking at anybody okay let's
150:35 - try this was one more thing we refresh
150:37 - the page let's see what happens when we
150:40 - set interim results to true and see what
150:42 - happens just let's just see I am now
150:46 - attempting to get interim results oh it
150:51 - wasn't auto-scrolling so you can see now
150:53 - I'm making a new paragraph and so this
150:56 - is like it's continuously giving me more
150:58 - and more depth so this would be
151:01 - interesting like as it's like trying to
151:02 - interpret it whoa this is crazy
151:04 - so this is interesting to try you can
151:06 - see what that's not like losing my mind
151:07 - here it's the paragraphs aren't
151:10 - scrolling automatically and I am all
151:12 - working no play make Kody train dull
151:19 - it's behind so I'm gonna stop here so
151:23 - you can see this is the basic idea now
151:24 - you could probably do something much
151:26 - more creative with this in terms of how
151:29 - this fits into an interaction scenario
151:31 - but the core basic ideas are start
151:34 - listening and whenever it's recognized
151:36 - something you've got data back you've
151:38 - got confidence you've got the text and
151:40 - whether it worked and some more stuff
151:41 - too and how you display that information
151:43 - back to the user is your choice so I'm
151:46 - gonna do a coding challenge where I make
151:48 - a chat bot that listens to what I say
151:49 - and then replies with listen to what I
151:53 - say was speech-to-text
151:54 - and replies with text-to-speech and that
151:56 - will be
151:57 - in the next video in this playlist if
151:58 - you're in the program with text playlist
152:01 - see you soon
152:04 - paper clips why couldn't I remember that
152:06 - all right I don't know if I really have
152:09 - time to do this do you think I could do
152:10 - this coding challenge well I'm at 300
152:13 - let's let's work on the paper clips for
152:14 - a little more I could definitely get
152:19 - some more Auto Clippers here and I have
152:22 - so much unsold inventory and you lower
152:25 - the price 42 how much trust do I have 18
152:38 - all right all right
152:40 - oh I can start in a minute Beall start
152:43 - investing all right by the way it is
152:45 - just kind of nice to make these
152:48 - artisanal paper clips by clicking the
152:50 - button I saw that joke from somebody
152:52 - else okay do I have its 540 the American
153:04 - League Championship Series game does not
153:05 - start until 8 p.m. I would like to have
153:08 - dinner with my children do you need to
153:11 - get going I'm looking
153:15 - what's with the Capitals that's an
153:17 - interesting question yeah okay I miss
153:23 - dot text so before I move on I by the
153:27 - way I borrowed that our T's an old
153:29 - pay-per-click joke from somebody else on
153:31 - Twitter who made it that wasn't my joke
153:33 - but it was a good one so I had to borrow
153:36 - it
153:37 - oh boy I mean you gotta raise the price
153:40 - I need more Auto Clippers oh no I
153:43 - definitely need this 500 oh now now now
153:46 - we're cooking I just like I really I
153:51 - just want a big box of actual real paper
153:53 - clips right
154:00 - do the coding challenge then - I turn Oh
154:03 - Austin lost it that's a good point
154:06 - all right I'm never going to do this
154:07 - coding challenge so the question is kept
154:12 - me just can you do a video on using
154:14 - speech-to-text to do activities like
154:16 - your computer like play music Oh could I
154:23 - control the computer well this would be
154:25 - this is something you certainly could do
154:27 - but I'm limited to controlling the
154:28 - browser because I'm just living in
154:30 - JavaScript in the web page and the
154:31 - browser is not typically allowed to
154:33 - reach outside of it you know it's not
154:35 - like I could make a web page that I
154:36 - could suddenly delete files off of
154:37 - somebody's hard drive that would be a
154:38 - big security issue and in fact that's
154:40 - why you have to give permission to use
154:41 - the microphone or the camera that sort
154:43 - of thing so how am i doing balance wise
154:48 - here I need to raise the price a little
154:49 - bit I just need more Auto Clippers
154:50 - they're so expensive but now looks like
154:55 - my inventory is kind of balanced I do
154:58 - cobain ambrose says why does it Dan
155:00 - upload the live streams after I do so
155:03 - immediately after this is over the live
155:04 - stream is available it's often becomes
155:06 - an unlit by default it becomes an
155:07 - unlisted video so you might have to
155:09 - tweet at me or ask in the chat for the
155:11 - link and then once once I've had a
155:14 - chance with Matt Matt's help who helps
155:16 - me manage the channel to add time codes
155:19 - and description and a thumbnail make
155:21 - sure it's all kind of like set and there
155:22 - wasn't like a private email address in
155:24 - it by accident or something then I'll
155:25 - release it and make it public and that
155:27 - usually happens sometime over the
155:28 - weekend my phone is okay hold on I
155:33 - definitely want the trading engine ooh
155:35 - okay hold on we want some high-risk
155:38 - investments let's deposit some money
155:41 - just posit all our money and let's start
155:46 - investing okay my inventory is kind of
155:50 - going up our buyers on all right all
155:55 - right little let the investments go
155:57 - we're gonna come back to this so I think
156:02 - what I'm gonna do I mean I could just do
156:05 - the number so I just do the number
156:08 - guessing chatbot and just build
156:09 - that that will be easier because then I
156:13 - don't have to like design a knock-knock
156:14 - joke and this thing is still running I'm
156:16 - gonna turn this off so the let me let me
156:19 - at least start I think I should at least
156:21 - start from this chat bot code whoops
156:26 - that'll make things because I the
156:28 - previous let me just open up the
156:30 - previous coding challenge oops what am i
156:34 - doing oh my god
156:38 - chat bot - I made everything so huge oh
156:52 - you know what this gives me a chance to
156:55 - fix something that I messed up in the
156:57 - previous video so this was the this was
157:02 - the previous chat bot where then I would
157:06 - say five and let's say pick a higher
157:08 - number seven I got it so in a way I kind
157:13 - of want to just use this have I been
157:17 - here for three hours
157:19 - 3:45 no two hours right I've been here
157:23 - for about exciting start though I
157:24 - started at 3:00 3:15 two and a half
157:26 - hours it I just you know if you if you
157:32 - want if you want to assign the blame did
157:35 - I mention its Frank Lance
157:37 - Frank Lance let's think that first of
157:41 - all he loves Frank Lance who is Frank
157:43 - Lance you might be wondering
157:45 - speaking of Frank Lance is the director
157:50 - of the NYU game center runs the MFA
157:53 - program
157:54 - he is a game designer he made the
157:56 - perfect game to torture I pretty sure he
157:59 - made it to torture me specifically I
158:02 - mean in some ways my life has all this
158:05 - meaning now because at some point I will
158:07 - get to the end right I will have made
158:09 - all the paper clips that anyone could
158:10 - ever have made and then I will discover
158:14 - the true meaning of everything that is
158:16 - to be in life
158:17 - right right Frank Frank are you here all
158:25 - right how do you guys feel about me I
158:35 - think what I want to do is I just sort
158:39 - of think that knock-knock joke is maybe
158:40 - a little bit better of a chatbot so but
158:43 - I could do that so let me do that let me
158:45 - change the knock-knock joke I just want
158:47 - to remember because that's gonna be easy
158:50 - to change and then have it speak okay
158:54 - this is the last thing I'm gonna do
158:56 - today for sure besides read some random
158:58 - numbers this is the knock-knock one so
159:04 - if I look at this like the knock-knock
159:08 - chatbot Chapa is pretty it's pretty
159:12 - simple okay all right so now close all
159:21 - this out
159:32 - Oh Eric Eric in the chat hi Eric is
159:42 - telling me that thick pay-per-click game
159:43 - never ends the universe resets actually
159:46 - true mates think like let's do the Wrath
159:57 - of Khan oh I'm getting a little dizzy
160:09 - give me a little dizzy everything's okay
160:12 - all right ready everybody we need we
160:15 - need to we need some warm up here pull
160:39 - the muscle of my dad all right let's do
160:41 - this
160:42 - this last exciting chat bot the music's
160:45 - messed up I'm not worried about it
160:50 - the sound is broken but hold on
160:56 - probably because but this is still
161:00 - working and can you still hear the
161:13 - speech-to-text thing text-to-speech yeah
161:19 - I messed it up because I change the
161:21 - volume for this but I can fix that back
161:26 - later okay
161:29 - I wonder why that is
161:33 - I really shouldn't worry about that
161:35 - right now you guys are getting to me
161:37 - here
161:37 - oh maybe it's the loopback audio that I
161:40 - want to use all right I'm gonna not I'm
161:45 - gonna not worry about that mouse over
161:51 - this stream okay how's the paper coop
161:55 - don't ask me how the paper clips are
161:57 - coming along that's a very bad idea I'm
162:00 - gonna be I want to get home by 7:00 so
162:02 - let's do this coding challenge let me
162:04 - fix this a little bit okay
162:08 - oh the Texas speech sounds bad so I
162:10 - messed something up so we have to fix
162:13 - this it looks like stuttering hmm
162:37 - tell me if it I know that's right I'm
162:40 - checking them kind of let me unplug and
162:43 - plug some wire stuff in oh I hear it
162:53 - crackling did it fix shoot let me see
163:16 - here there's a couple other places I can
163:21 - try to check not fixed okay thank you
163:27 - guys for letting me know
163:51 - let's see I unplugged and plugged a
163:53 - bunch of things back in let me do that
163:55 - one more time
163:55 - oh wait a sec I'm so silly that I can
164:09 - actually I'm waiting for you guys to
164:11 - tell me if it's fixed and I forgot that
164:12 - I have a monitor here I think it's okay
164:30 - now I'm hearing it fine
164:52 - so when I was listening to these
164:56 - headphones you guys heard it clipping
164:58 - and stuttering that's weird cuz it's
165:03 - fine for me in the monitor so where
165:06 - could that mean it's having a problem
165:18 - yeah I'm trying to think I guess I could
165:20 - stop I'm gonna hit stop streaming and
165:23 - start streaming again instantly I think
165:26 - it won't split this up into two separate
165:27 - streams I'm sorry everybody I know this
165:30 - is so the right physical issue but what
165:35 - this is in theory no you understand that
165:43 - the what I'm listening to here is the
165:46 - final audio before it goes to stream so
165:50 - something is happening this is not like
165:53 - this is not connected to my laptop this
165:55 - is connected to the live streaming
165:56 - computer and this is the monitoring that
165:58 - output so like I can hear myself talking
166:00 - if I put these on hello hello and I hear
166:04 - no issues so so yeah but my voice is
166:28 - fine too isn't that weird that's very
166:32 - weird but I've unplugged and plugged
166:35 - everything in that would the only thing
166:37 - I can think of as restarting OBS
166:46 - you know what but wasn't doing it before
166:52 - well I'm gonna try stopping and starting
166:54 - streaming real quick okay I'm gonna try
166:57 - that ready here we go one two three all
167:03 - right I should be back let's see if this
167:07 - is the music bad two or just my laptop
167:18 - turn the interim thing off what's the
167:21 - interim thing am i back can you guys see
167:36 - me
167:53 - huh
167:54 - is the music bad
168:31 - so now you can't hear anything
168:49 - oh it's working now it's fine okay are
169:06 - we good was the was the speech-to-text
169:09 - fine - yeah Oh still bad what but the
169:17 - music is fine why was it fix I did every
169:30 - say was fixed for a second hold on I
169:35 - think it's this cable hmm all right oh I
169:48 - hate having these technical problems
169:50 - hold on I need it I think this cable is
169:55 - bad whoa
169:58 - something just happened
170:33 - different mic picked it up alright okay
170:37 - [Laughter]
170:49 - ignore it play through the air into the
170:51 - mic that I could do still that okay so
171:00 - definitely if I'm gonna do this I need
171:03 - to just out of curiosity
171:25 - I'm plugging the output to YouTube
171:27 - button I did that fix the music by any
171:30 - chance I'm probably just gonna do it
171:36 - emergency Chrome extensions yeah no okay
171:40 - so I'm gonna basically unplug this turn
171:55 - this all the way up how's that yeah so
172:21 - now it's just coming out of my laptop
172:23 - speakers and being picked up by this mic
172:25 - which if that's good enough then accept
172:30 - the ball then that that's what I'm gonna
172:34 - do hmm all right well I lost all my
172:40 - momentum and energy I'm at 1 million
172:45 - paperclips though I kind of want to
172:51 - restart everything and make it work but
172:52 - I'm no I can't play the music now I mean
172:56 - the music is completely is non-existent
172:59 - it's plugged into something that mean
173:11 - it's just coming out of like random
173:14 - speakers now okay let's do this oh my
173:17 - god I plant them computing now oh my all
173:20 - my stocks are doing terribly got a lot
173:26 - of unsold inventory lower the pricier
173:36 - I'm sort of get some high risk money
173:38 - going okay
173:45 - I need photonic chips okay all right
173:51 - shall we do this just get everything oh
173:57 - I completely forgot I was lying all
174:01 - right here's the thing should I just go
174:04 - I think I'm gonna go ahead and do this
174:05 - the computer I feel a little sad that
174:09 - the audio is gonna be a little like not
174:10 - great but I think we're just gonna have
174:16 - to live with it and I'm gonna do this
174:18 - okay
174:32 - it's a little quiet oops
174:37 - so I don't know how to make it I'm gonna
174:40 - do the bots don't worry yet I'm trying
174:47 - to just think if there's a like if I
174:52 - just I think it came let me just try one
174:54 - more thing which is to oh wait a second
175:01 - oh because I turned off the laptop audio
175:07 - well weird hold on a second
175:09 - just just bear with me for a second why
175:20 - does the oh oh because I put it on
175:24 - internal speakers okay okay so I have
175:28 - one more thing I can try if I might as
175:33 - well try this one last thing which is
175:35 - that I have a duplicate cable I just
175:38 - want to know if it's the cable so if you
175:41 - don't mind I'm going to very quickly
175:46 - swap cables it's probably a different
175:50 - cable because this one I kept unplugging
175:52 - and plugging in but let me just give
175:56 - this one last try
176:08 - and then
176:18 - okay this is now gonna go out through
176:20 - the HDMI again how's that i awkward dev
176:36 - for hiding the 13 yeah sounds bad okay
176:41 - nevermind it's something else I don't
176:43 - know where it's happening but it's not
176:45 - this cable I mean I could try swapping a
176:48 - different cable there's so many things I
176:49 - could try swapping now but I'm gonna
176:52 - have to just forget it okay thank you
176:55 - for that was one last thing I could try
176:57 - I could probably restart the computer
176:58 - but I prefer not to do that alright I
177:14 - should turn off the paper it's gotta be
177:16 - that it's got to be the paper clips it's
177:18 - gotta be frank Lance how am I doing here
177:36 - oh I really need to I need to get this
177:41 - marketing going this is ridiculous
177:44 - hold on everybody I know I'm distracted
177:53 - to
177:57 - there we go fifty dollars per second
177:59 - that's good all right I'm gonna let that
178:09 - go and here we go really lost my mind
178:14 - here
178:14 - six o'clock all right here we go
178:27 - hi I'm gonna do one more a chatbot I'm
178:31 - kind of gonna do the exact same chatbot
178:32 - I just did maybe I'll change it from a
178:34 - number guessing thing to a knock-knock
178:36 - joke thing just to change it but instead
178:39 - of me typing guess the number between 1
178:42 - and 10 ok let's try 7 pick a higher
178:45 - number let's try 9 the lower number
178:47 - let's try hate I got it
178:49 - instead of typing I want to interact
178:51 - with this chat bot through voice so it
178:53 - just recorded 2 tutorials about the p5
178:56 - speech library 1 tutorial looks at
179:01 - text-to-speech so having the browser
179:04 - speak with a voice and another tutorial
179:07 - looks at speech to text listening to
179:10 - what I'm saying and and turning that
179:14 - into text so let's first so let me first
179:17 - cup two things let me deal with this
179:19 - chat bond a little bit let me first say
179:22 - one thing that I got wrong in the
179:23 - previous coding challenge video that I
179:25 - that I should as I as I created this
179:27 - like elaborate system if you recall to
179:33 - say to the chat bot set a number and
179:36 - then set the variable to whatever so I
179:39 - had to like secretly talk to the chat
179:40 - bot there's actually a set var method
179:42 - that's part of the rive script
179:43 - JavaScript library so I didn't have to
179:45 - use that convoluted methodology if you
179:46 - don't know I'm talking about you didn't
179:48 - watch the previous coding challenge you
179:49 - can go back and watch it and this will
179:50 - make sense but this was an unnecessary
179:52 - step thank you for internet for
179:55 - correcting me and helping me with that
179:56 - but I'm actually going to just kind of
179:59 - get rid of this brain and I'm gonna
180:03 - start over I'm gonna do a sub I'm gonna
180:10 - I want to make sure cuz uh with a
180:13 - knock-knock joke you might say who is
180:15 - there or who's there knock-knock no but
180:19 - that's the box saying that anyway so I
180:20 - don't need this sub what I'm gonna do is
180:23 - do I'm going to have a catch-all which
180:26 - is anything the user says I'm going to
180:28 - say try saying
180:31 - knock-knock and then optionally if the
180:36 - user says anything we
180:39 - the phrase knock-knock in it so this is
180:41 - like a channel wildcard I wonder if I
180:43 - need that optional around there then I'm
180:46 - gonna then the bot is going to say who
180:49 - who's there
180:53 - okay so let's just try this and this is
180:56 - one of the examples from the rive script
180:58 - website so I can say anything I want and
181:00 - it's gonna say try saying knock-knock
181:02 - and then I could just add knock-knock
181:04 - and it's gonna say who's there or I
181:06 - could say
181:07 - knock-knock and it could say who's there
181:11 - now here's the thing now what I want to
181:14 - do is say well whatever they say in
181:19 - response to who's there the bot should
181:25 - say star one who and then at the end the
181:31 - bot should say haha so this is the
181:36 - sequence knock knock who's there
181:39 - Frank Frank who Frank Lance ha ha ha
181:47 - Franklin's making a weird nonsensical
181:50 - appearance in this video tutorial for no
181:53 - good reason but that's besides the point
181:56 - so here's the thing though VI can't have
181:58 - all these stars what I need is something
182:00 - to help me sequence and I'm kind of
182:02 - forgetting what the what the command is
182:06 - for sequencing but I'm gonna remember in
182:09 - a second because there's gonna be about
182:10 - to be an edit point we're gonna look it
182:12 - up now I'll just look it up with with
182:14 - you and watching me do this so I have an
182:15 - example that already does this I was
182:17 - trying to do it from scratch and here it
182:18 - is so ah the percent the percent means
182:23 - if the last thing was who is there then
182:27 - I say whatever who if the previous thing
182:31 - was whatever who then I can say haha
182:35 - that is so funny so I need to add this
182:37 - in to here right think about this this
182:42 - is saying this is a catch-all but only
182:45 - if the previous thing that the bot said
182:48 - was who is there ah but the bot says
182:50 - who's there
182:51 - this is why I want to have this
182:55 - substitution I knew there was a reason
182:57 - this substitution who's and who is our
183:01 - equivalent so whatever kind of mechanics
183:03 - is working have them be equivalent and
183:05 - then I also want by the way I don't
183:07 - usually do this in a coding challenge
183:08 - just like a copy-paste from an example
183:11 - but that's what I'm doing the point of
183:13 - this was to add the speech thing so I
183:15 - guess I could cut me some slack here so
183:19 - then at the end if the last thing was
183:21 - star who now let's see the order might
183:25 - matter let's see if the or let's see if
183:27 - this works I put these in a different
183:29 - order than in the example but let's see
183:30 - if this works
183:31 - so let's go back to the bots and I'm
183:34 - gonna just type in some nonsense so say
183:35 - try saying knock-knock
183:37 - so I'm gonna say knock-knock say who's
183:38 - there coding coding who coding train yay
183:45 - [Music]
183:47 - okay so we have a working knock-knock
183:49 - joke chat bot thing because by the way
183:51 - if I were to say now coding train it's
183:54 - good as they try saying knock-knock
183:55 - right because it only laughed because it
183:57 - was part of the sequence but the whole
184:00 - point of this video however long I am in
184:03 - is now to 10,000 steps so I walk back
184:09 - and forth what it's really good to do a
184:11 - like live YouTube channel with a Fitbit
184:13 - on okay I wanted to speak so how do we
184:17 - do that so I need to import download and
184:20 - import the p5 speech library so if you
184:23 - want to know how to do that I cover that
184:25 - in my tutorials about the p5 speech
184:27 - library right now I'm just gonna have a
184:29 - moment where I disappear and reappear
184:30 - with the library downloaded so let me
184:34 - just grab the library because actually
184:40 - you know what I should no no let me not
184:41 - do that
184:45 - I I need the p5.js library so how do I
184:49 - get that I think the piece I need the
184:53 - p5.js speech library the v5 speech
184:55 - library how do I get that so I have that
184:57 - open here this github repository if I
185:00 - just go into here Lib and I see this
185:03 - particular file p5 speech Jas this is
185:06 - the file I need to download and include
185:08 - it as part of my project so I'm not
185:10 - going to go through the steps to
185:11 - download it right now it's already there
185:12 - it's not already there but I'm gonna
185:13 - have an edit point and now and now I'm
185:24 - gonna go chat no speech rec library p5
185:28 - speech chat bot to libraries p5 speech
185:32 - ok I'm back and you can see that I've
185:40 - now added p5 speech Jas to my folder
185:43 - with libraries in it and actually with
185:45 - the thing that I didn't do is I need to
185:46 - go into o index dot HTML and also add a
185:50 - reference to that P v dot speech jeaious
185:53 - library ok now I have this p5 speech
185:55 - library now what I want to do is I'm
186:00 - going to say let speech equals new p v
186:04 - dot speech and do i need an argument
186:08 - there i can't remember but i think no if
186:10 - i wanted to set a voice you know i'm
186:11 - just gonna use the default voice voice
186:13 - speech dot speak hello
186:16 - so let's just see if this works
186:23 - so unfortunately my sound system isn't
186:24 - working so great so you're hearing it
186:26 - out of the computer speakers and in
186:27 - through my mic hopefully you can hear it
186:29 - ok but you can see this is as simple as
186:32 - just creating a speech object and saying
186:34 - it's speak hello my other video I go
186:36 - through how to pick a different voice
186:37 - how to change the rate and pitch but I
186:39 - just want to use the default voice and
186:41 - now instead of wherever it says sticks
186:46 - the out put it in HTML thing I'm gonna
186:49 - say speech dot speak reply okay here we
186:54 - go so I'm going to type in some nonsense
186:57 - all right now I'm gonna say knock-knock
187:02 - coding coding rainbow okay so we get the
187:16 - idea we get the idea this works now I
187:19 - kind of want to remove the text there
187:21 - the point was this but now what I need I
187:23 - need four instead of me typing in the
187:25 - stuff I want to now be able to say it oh
187:27 - this is gonna be fast so now what I need
187:30 - can I do this in the same sketch is I
187:33 - need a speech recognition object which I
187:37 - must say new p5 speech speech rec okay
187:42 - and I need to give it a callback got
187:45 - speech so this is the tricky thing the
187:47 - callback is for when asked equivalent of
187:50 - when I hit the submit button so whatever
187:53 - I did in that submit button
187:54 - that's the callback when I hit submit I
187:57 - want to just process what I said well I
188:00 - think this is gonna work am I making I
188:01 - might not be making any sense but I need
188:03 - I need to add this I need to add a
188:07 - function called got speech speech so I
188:12 - just want to make sure this works and
188:13 - I'm gonna just say console.log so this I
188:15 - go through this in more detail in that
188:17 - other tutorial video but basically this
188:19 - speech object comes with a property
188:22 - called text so and I forgot that I need
188:26 - to say I need to explicitly tell the
188:28 - speech recording object to start and
188:30 - there's some things I can configure in
188:31 - the start function I'm gonna use the
188:32 - default settings all right so let's just
188:34 - see if this works now so you can see
188:38 - that it's listening to me but if I've
188:44 - done this before so normally we would
188:45 - have pop up with like can I use your
188:46 - microphone thing you might see that and
188:48 - you can see that I'm getting the text
188:50 - that I'm saying here
188:54 - knock-knock great alright so this is
188:58 - working so now what I need to do is I
189:00 - need to change it from basically the
189:04 - user input is no longer what's coming in
189:07 - from that text box but instead
189:12 - it's what's coming in from speech text
189:14 - so it needs to reply to speech dot text
189:19 - and I'm gonna do something really
189:21 - ridiculous which is I'm gonna say input
189:25 - user input dot value speech tech so I'm
189:31 - gonna put what I'm saying also on the
189:32 - screen just for debugging purposes I'm
189:34 - gonna remove all that before I finish so
189:36 - let's let's go knock knock okay got an
189:43 - error speech dot speak is not a function
189:46 - ah what's happened here these callbacks
189:49 - maybe live somewhere else oh look at
189:54 - this I name the same variable too why I
189:56 - called this speech I should call this or
189:59 - some camera stuff I don't know we wrote
190:00 - a speech let's just call this speech
190:04 - speech data oh I I need better variable
190:07 - names somebody will think of better
190:08 - variable names and I'm gonna say let let
190:12 - input equals speech data text and then
190:19 - I'm just going to use input here input
190:23 - input and input all right let's see if
190:27 - this works
190:30 - hello knock knock Daniel Daniel sheath
190:45 - Mon wow that was exciting it worked
190:52 - could you hear it could you hear it so
190:56 - this is great I think I'm done oh let's
190:58 - let's just remove let's remove
191:00 - everything from the HTML page just for
191:02 - the the sake of argument so I'm gonna
191:04 - just comment all this stuff out I'm
191:06 - gonna go into my code and I don't want
191:10 - any Dom elements I don't need talking to
191:16 - me I don't want to use this Dom element
191:19 - I don't want to use this Dom element
191:21 - and I don't need this function alright
191:23 - so I just commented out all the stuff
191:24 - that was for the HTML stuff hello
191:29 - bot knock-knock
191:36 - coding train coding train coding
191:44 - challenged completed yeah alright I
191:53 - don't know that was up let me try it one
191:56 - more time oh well let me do a different
191:58 - demonstration with a I need a real
192:00 - knock-knock joke oh I got one I got one
192:03 - I got one
192:05 - Matthew edit that out this will be the
192:07 - real one use
192:10 - hello bot knock-knock the interrupting
192:20 - cow Moo well it doesn't work
192:27 - can I interrupt it it oh let's try
192:33 - another one
192:34 - knock knock knock knock
192:42 - okay am i back you can't see the
192:47 - computer can you see me can you hear me
192:52 - I'm sort of hoping I wonder if that
192:55 - fixed by the way I had to restart the
192:57 - computer so I sort of wanted to see if
192:59 - the audio problem got fixed if you don't
193:02 - mind so let me see if that fixed the
193:08 - audio problem I'm just curious so if I
193:10 - go back to the sound settings and do
193:13 - multi output device hello
193:19 - charging knock knock who's there
193:23 - alright did that fix the the audio thing
193:27 - I mean it's you're gonna hear twice
193:30 - because I turned it up so it's coming
193:31 - through my micro yeah it does
193:34 - great well let me just go redo the whole
193:36 - video again all right let me turn it
193:38 - down I can't
193:39 - oh so frustrating should restart I would
193:45 - have restarted the computer if I knew it
193:47 - was gonna crash in the first place and I
193:49 - think by the way unfortunately when it
193:51 - crashes I think that corrupted the whole
193:53 - recording to disk so I think of course
193:55 - me to edit these challenge we're gonna
193:57 - have to like suck down the livestream
193:58 - archive off of YouTube anyway
194:02 - if anybody knows how you could because I
194:05 - the data is there like I know right now
194:06 - let me look let me just if that happened
194:08 - because I can ask there is yeah there is
194:12 - a whoa oh my goodness a huge file here
194:19 - that I can get rid of there is a 7.5 gig
194:24 - video file which was the whole
194:26 - livestream archive which won't open
194:30 - because it's not closed properly there
194:31 - must be a way the data's got to all be
194:33 - there there must be a way to like just
194:35 - fix a it's like a dot mp4 file if
194:39 - anybody knows how to do that let me know
194:41 - because we had this problem before if I
194:45 - am writing to mp4 yes
194:47 - so Alka maybe I need to write to
194:49 - something some other like they can't
194:51 - deal with this right now but maybe I
194:52 - need to change the settings another time
194:54 - alright let's let's finish this out by
194:56 - gonna break it again I hope not
194:58 - alright
195:09 - knock-knock
195:17 - knock knock who's there
195:20 - wait Larry hold on hello bot try saying
195:26 - knock knock knock knock who's there the
195:31 - interrupting cow the interrupting cow
195:35 - moo moo moo it doesn't like the
195:45 - interrupting okay knock knock knock
195:51 - knock just knock knock who's there
195:57 - orange orange home
196:01 - orange you glad I didn't say Paperclip
196:03 - oh so this is the end of this code
196:08 - challenge this is a chatbot voice
196:11 - conversational interface thing that runs
196:13 - in the browser with rive script and p5
196:17 - the p5 speech library I hope you enjoyed
196:19 - watching me make this I hope that you
196:21 - make something fun and interesting
196:23 - that's different and please share it
196:26 - with me this is a little trickier to
196:27 - share especially if it's a rather than
196:31 - just like oh it's an interesting like
196:32 - rainbow particle system but figure out a
196:34 - way to share it with me share a link in
196:35 - the comments or tweet me at Schiffman
196:37 - and i will see you in a future video
196:39 - goodbye
196:41 - try seeing knock-knock
196:43 - oh really good bye good bye I think that
196:54 - should get edited right like the video
196:56 - should end right after the computer says
196:57 - try saying knock-knock alright everybody
197:09 - it's me I am sue me is telling me it's
197:12 - fairly simple to chunk it to the last
197:13 - total frame or whatever so I could use
197:15 - some help with that I'm gonna upload
197:16 - these files to Google Drive
197:17 - alright everybody I don't have my music
197:21 - thing plugged in but you probably hear
197:25 - it that way so let me work okay okay
197:31 - paper clips 625 I I get 1 minute and 30
197:40 - seconds to the end of this song whatever
197:43 - the paper clip value is I'm gonna do a
197:45 - screenshot at the end of this song
197:47 - whatever that number is it's the number
197:48 - but I get some time here what can I do
197:51 - really quickly mega Clippers oh my god
197:53 - be some mega Clippers quickly just as
197:56 - many as I can get raise the price
198:08 - well it's going down no lower the price
198:12 - lower the price I want more money
198:15 - deposit some money
198:17 - high-risk stocks ooh let's let's run
198:20 - some tournament what else can I get I
198:24 - don't have any quantum computing yet do
198:26 - I can get some more of these things all
198:33 - right make some extra ones all right
198:40 - this is this is how far we're gonna have
198:42 - gotten by the way everybody let me see
198:43 - if wait I'm not looking at the YouTube
198:44 - chat I'm not by the way Thank You Alka
198:48 - for that remind me you're so I'm not I
198:51 - forgot when I when I went to restart the
198:53 - computer
198:54 - I didn't load up the YouTube chat let me
198:56 - see if I can look at it real quick on
198:57 - this computer here Dan when will you be
199:03 - back with a neural network series I hope
199:05 - to be able to announce some stuff about
199:06 - that soon and it will be towards the end
199:08 - of this year or early 2018 until you
199:12 - know the reality of my the way that I do
199:14 - this channel is that I'm trying to
199:16 - support the courses that I'm teaching
199:17 - and so that content doesn't you know I
199:19 - wish I had done it over the summer I
199:21 - wanted to but that content just doesn't
199:22 - fit till later
199:23 - Oh next week I next week I will be in
199:28 - Boston for processing day there will be
199:30 - no live stream next Friday so the next
199:32 - live stream will be unless I can find a
199:34 - time in between now two weeks from today
199:36 - that that live session will be recorded
199:39 - so hopefully that'll be another video so
199:44 - there are two chats I'm using a
199:46 - crowdfunding site called patreon
199:48 - patreon.com slash coding train and so
199:52 - for people who are members or patrons of
199:54 - the channel through that there's a pipe
199:56 - there's a private slack channel that
199:57 - you'll get an invite to
200:03 - wait hold on what ah wait why is my oh
200:13 - there we go
200:14 - zero all right no thank you
200:18 - so this is the final number this is the
200:23 - final number I should be on the desktop
200:25 - where do the screenshots go hmm yep here
200:29 - it is this is the final number for the
200:32 - live stream by the way if I had just
200:34 - focused only on the paper clips I would
200:37 - have gotten way way way past this is the
200:39 - final number three million fifty-five
200:40 - thousand seven hundred fifty one the
200:42 - rules are just to remind you your tweet
200:44 - with the hashtag paper clip train had to
200:47 - be a timestamp 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time
200:52 - and your number the difference between
200:54 - your number and this number the absolute
200:56 - value of that has to be the smallest of
200:58 - everybody
200:59 - and if you did multiple guesses your
201:02 - last one in a valid timestamp is the one
201:05 - that will count so I will look through
201:07 - and try to find the winner but if
201:09 - anybody feels like looking through the
201:10 - hash tag with this number and helping me
201:12 - find the winner and like doing some kind
201:14 - of like certified authentication I will
201:17 - then direct message you and get your
201:20 - address anywhere in the world I will
201:22 - send a coding train t-shirt so so that's
201:30 - the that's that there's 400 people
201:33 - watching right now which is kind of
201:34 - insane this has been going on for three
201:37 - hours and 23 minutes which is the good
201:39 - sign it leads me to believe the
201:40 - interface is leading me to believe
201:41 - oh I that I'm completely brain dead
201:46 - right now
201:47 - I'm gonna go which is it leads me to
201:49 - believe that the hashtag is particle
201:53 - known paperclip train I believe let's
201:55 - check it a Twitter comm hashtag
202:05 - paperclip train so we can just sort of
202:10 - scan over this to see this is pretty
202:12 - good noah van boven is looking pretty
202:15 - good
202:17 - this is the end of the game right all
202:21 - right so I'll look through this later
202:22 - thank you guys for watching I hope this
202:24 - was a helpful session I hope to have
202:27 - more sleep before the next time I will
202:29 - see you two weeks from now thank you for
202:32 - joining the coding train I'm gonna check
202:35 - the slack channel to make sure I didn't
202:37 - miss anything
202:39 - thirteen million is maybe the closest me
202:42 - I am Samia there's a 1 million yeah 1
202:44 - million is gonna be closer so
202:48 - c'est la vie okay so I don't know I'm
202:55 - done I can't end these things oh and I
203:00 - have some exciting new videos that will
203:02 - premiere before hopefully before two
203:04 - weeks from before my next livestream
203:06 - that were not done in the live stream so
203:08 - there will be some for those who watch
203:10 - this live and here I almost I didn't
203:16 - read any random numbers I gotta go like
203:18 - the sound board is not hooked up
203:19 - somebody wants to help me with the sound
203:20 - board I would love that I have an iPad
203:22 - which drives it but I would be totally
203:24 - open to using a different solution and
203:27 - let's try just everybody I leave you
203:30 - with one last thing which is try seg
203:33 - knock-knock okay goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

hello good afternoon and welcome to the coding train a weekly internet thing with me your host Daniel Shipman in a room by myself with some lights and some computers and a door and a camera and a monitor to see that I'm actually on and that perhaps for once I'm starting this livestream without my microphone muted is that possible could it possibly be true I'm looking at the slack channel there is a live YouTube chat which I find a bit hard to follow though I will attempt to follow it there's also a slack channel which is for patrons of the coding train if you would like to join that it's a crowdfunding site called patreon patreon comm slash coding trains something like that so here's the thing actually I feel like I'm saying this all the time but if you notice there's some like bags under my eyes or if I see what sorts things like hair is a bit more unkempt I'm not sure who to blame here exactly but I'm kind of addicted I've got it running over here on this this like invisible laptop thing whew what's this weird like an invisible laptop thing here but there's and I'm rockin don't worry as much as I might have suggested at one point I was going to livestream me just playing this game about paper clips that would have to talk about I'm not going to do that I'm just at least gonna start I'm just gonna like open up a window everything's gonna be fine I'm not gonna get sucked into the vortex of the paper clips Frank Lance Franklin's the director of the NYU game MFA and BFA program here and University of Tisch School of the Arts created a game which I guess is called the clicker it's a clicker and let's see where it lets see paper clip what happens if I just Google paper clips now what do I find a game about making paper clips blah blah blah oh this is my my really just jumping on the bandwagon Frank and so what I would like to go is to let's go find this game we find okay okay here we go okay so the green paper is visible ah I know the magic the magic I meant to bring like a whole bucket of paper clips here with me and I could just juggle them or put them in my hair just play with them but instead I'm gonna go here I'm gonna increase the size and I'm going to make my first paper clip I would like to tell them to tell me if this game ever ends Joe just like to know if there's an end because right now I am working on on this other computer over here if you just will bear with me for a second I've had this I've got a dedicated machine for making paper clips I'm at what is that except iliyan 1.8 sextillion I'm at 1.8 sextillion oh okay oh but I need to have I should be able to get the selfcorrecting supply chain why can't why is it the selfcorrecting supply chain why hasn't it enabled itself yet by the way I know there's a way I could open up the JavaScript console and like to change all the HTML and I could just make as many paper clips as I want but no I I'm I believe in the purity of the paper clip machine and so I'm gonna make a second one so I'm gonna go away in a second I'm what I'm wondering is I've got a little competition here a little coding train Friday afternoon coding show with a person who didn't sleep nearly enough you know not entirely just because of the paper clips probably lost an hour if I'm being honest the paper clips I did wake up early to make some paper clips and wake up early but that's the first thing I thought of when I woke up but so I'm a little tired today what was I talking about paper clips ah so what I what I was thinking is I have these tshirts I'm wearing one today and there's a bunch of different designs I would like to have a little contest here whoever can guess the number closest to the amount of paper clips that are on this page by the end of this live session of the coding train I will send you a free coding train tshirt if you were one if you want to pick out your style now cuz you're so sure gonna win this you can go to coding train dot store and V I think I'd have no idea MV comm yeah there we go coding training dot store envy calm good nice nice tshirt style that you like there's a bunch no no no no no no not just typing your number in the chat and boy your numbers are way too low let me just tell you it's really low because I have my intention is to kind of least get up there at least till it's like automatically making some paper clips did you tuned in because you thought you'd be watching something about learning to code I'm sorry instead you tuned in to a lunatic on the internet every once in a while manages to focus enough to do a coding tutorial so I I think in order to enter this competition I think you're gonna have to have a Twitter account because I think that's one of the only ways I can regulate a time stamp so it's 312 p.m. Eastern Time if your tweet with hashtag paperclip train you must use the hashtag paperclip train with a net single number if your tweet has the number closest to whatever I end with and your tweet is before 330 p.m. Eastern Time that means 330 p.m. and 59 seconds if that's the time stamp is fine but 331 and any number of seconds is not okay I will send you I will I would send you a box of paperclips but then I have to go to the post office myself it's such a pain but this printondemand tshirt send you a tshirt it's just so okay so paperclip train now if you want to play along let's make some more paper clips alright do up to like 16 what do I need to do here so I need to get someone I got a what do I need to do I need to let's just keep making some paperclips I forget I it was so long ago that I started this game I'm gonna run out of money I'm gonna run out of money making paperclips I have a lot of unsold inventory oh this has got it get better okay Auto Clippers this is really gonna help alright finally at least now I'm oughta Kagome I will come back to this little later maybe I'll lower the price to sell them but maybe I'll just lower the price of 10 cents I could do that right now right and it's it's it's fine oh I could buy another Auto Clippers okay let's lower to five cents alright let's let it run let's let it go okay alright let's check Twitter paper clip train how we doing here alright look there's a whole bunch already look at this this is exciting alright paper clip train here we go now back to the coding train I did something exciting this morning which is that I recorded look I'm so giant I am a monster on the internet next to some diagrams let me zoom this out a little bit some new videos will be appearing on the internet that were recorded and not live streamed and this is your clue to what they could be about with a special guest appearance by somebody who drew these diagrams so just little little foreshadowing there those will come out next week in the next week or two nine new results okay this is good all right let's check on our paper bliss oh wait I I'm not even looking at the chat and just looking at Mike let's see here I can get some more Auto Clippers for sure really gonna get I need to do some marketing definitely need to do some marketing okay alright so what's gonna happen today on the coding train I'm going to try to actually accomplish something um the things that I would like to do are number one look at some nice particle system things that people made number two I would like to do some more of my objectoriented programming in JavaScript thing video stuff for my intro to learn to program series that needs to get updated with some es6 syntax and then also I am going to make the computer it's over here talk to me so I want to ii've started this series about chat BOTS I'm looking at very simple pattern matching retrieval based chat BOTS I look at something called rive script and what I'm gonna do is I'm going to induce some variation of that number guessing game but instead of typing in my responses and reading my responses as text I'm going to speak iris I'm gonna speak my words and listen to the response from the computer so we're gonna kind like custom build our own you know insert name of commercial product that talks to you at home device here like to make our own and then eventually I would like to investigate making some projects that run on these insert name of commercial device that you can buy and put in your home here I guess I have to name them at some point I'm always worried if I say something like Alexa then all these things in this room will start to beep at me but there is nothing in this room but me and some other stuff but maybe I just triggered your Alexa at home okay viral is gonna go get some snacks it's a good idea I would take your time because I'm really I this paperclip thing I have so many emails I could've been either I need to reply to instead just in case you're wondering I won't i won't i won't look at my eye I got what I want to show you the paperclip thing that I've been working on since last night there has to be an end right there's got to be a reason why I'm doing this there has to be a goal to get to eventually right Frank Frank are you out there you listening somebody get Frank Luntz on the phone Frank tell me what do I do I just I can't that's East I need to work that I really this will I really this okay so here we are let's buy some we're out of Clippers are we are we close no we're nowhere near we have a we have a lot where we need to make some more paper clips let's get these Auto Clippers going up and let's let's raise the price since we're kind of selling them faster than we can make them we need a little more money maybe we'll come back a little while and get get some some marketing going okay no let's get rid of this let's get rid of this is it 330 yet you still have time to guess you still have time to guess I haven't seen there hasn't been a single paper the latest is Jorge who guessed 23,000 250 this will be interesting so distance by integer values so that's the winner will be the closest number you can go above you can go below it doesn't matter the if I take your guess the absolute value of your guess the final number here and that number is the lowest you will with the coding train tshirt and if there's a tie I will send why not right there's ten people who all tie I don't know I'll send ten that's what's gonna happen all right so let's see what's happening now let's so speaking of hashtags with the word training in hit last week I did a what did I do last week I did a coding challenge making a particle system and there have been some really nice examples of particle systems that have been posted to Twitter with the hashtag particle train here's one by Alberto nice I like how these particles are coming from the outside and coming into the center there's like meditative breathing thing going on here I love that this is a really nice one right so this looks very similar to my example but there's some nice variations here number one is there's these there's particles that are colored black and particles that are come from white with some sort of transparency against a gray background it looks like and then there's these little extra yellow popping ones that maybe pop out with more speed and respond to gravity looks like falling down which gives it a really nice quality great work to siren on twitter here's one huh this looks quite a bit like little bursts of fire that's nice I love this oh look at this a drain so if I click here let's see if this runs goes to it which while this is loading I should just check on the paper clips right right it's always okay if something's loading let's check on the paper clips by some water Clippers what do we think lower the price a little bit lower the price a little bit okay okay back back here we can see nice used to the particle system with an actual train and I can move the trains moving ooh and I think I can press on here back here I can change to some stars some rainbows and back to some stars and there we go we don't need paper clips stars and rainbows and smoke from a train made in javascript in the browser this is all we need okay thank you for it so I'm gonna keep scrolling down we've got some nice raining effect whoo this sort of like cool vortex crazy thing this one is on open processing with some sound interaction that's lovely this is some weird something for some hamsters oh this is that same I think this is a nice one looks like that makes a nice circular like Fang there's so many this is so exciting and wonderful to see I hope I'm not missing anybody's butt so I encourage you to check out Parker crane hashtag on Twitter and submit your own you can also find user submissions and community versions of some of the coding challenges if you go to the rainbow code repository and I go down to coding challenges maybe challenges all the way to the bottom oh I mean the wrong on the wrong URL coding challenges all the way towards the bottom I'm looking for a simple particle system and here we can see some here's a link to the particle train hash tag and some wonderful demos by users let's click through these real quick I'm just gonna click on the demos demo demo demo demo demo Oh apparently one of them is playing some sound this one's responding to the sound the music's not actually synced right now pause on get new colors start song again cool here's one called embers ah looks kind of like embers coming out of fire that's really nice here is one called DV k qpe a pen buys oh here look at these nice little bubbles so one of the things I need to investigate today you see a little flickering going on here is deleting particles so that's something I'm definitely gonna investigate today chimney I guess these are the default names if you don't name but I'm like really I'm what is the meaning of MBG mzq there's a queue there's got to be a deeper meaning there does it have something to do with with paper clips possess something to do with paper clips let's check let's check oh how am i doing I have why I need some more wire I need some more wire okay I bought some more wire about a lot of wire how am i doing that's a month's old inventory I think I can lower the price here I need more Auto Clippers okay we'll come back will come back will come back okay where was I where is it okay back back to nice chimney here oh look at this move your mouse on either side of the screen so we can see some smoke from chimney one our smoke from chimney I love that I love the interaction to be able to sort of trigger different chimneys and oh this is the one that is with that sound responsive so as I speak the particles go and if I put on some music oh right I love sound responsive talking me particles out of my sound and then here we go particles towards center from Dave briquette II this looks like maybe the particles are kind of orbiting and circling around the center with a nice rainbow pattern and coming in maybe there's some gravitational attraction there that is cool great work I could have sworn there I saw the name Alka on this list Oh embers was Alka I must be um so this one was Alka what did I say yesterday I said like loyal viewer but I think I've maybe misspoke it's a royal view or something like that great work with the embers I wonder if there's something going on with my computer where things are running a little bit snow okay excellent work everybody uh this computer went to sleep this one which is really forking one might say I'm gonna get Frank Lance on the phone yet I need like an emergency phone where I could just like I need to know the secrets behind the paper clips and the hypno drones and the swarms and the youngbae and all of the things please tell me the secrets do you hear that dinging okay uh yeah so Alka says there's tons of fancy filters going on there it runs beautifully smooth on my machine alright I successfully did just about nothing for the law at least the good stuff it's almost 20 to 30 minutes here so those of you who are slow to enter to join to abort to to to board to board the coding train now you're all here so maybe we're gonna do some actual coding now I like to use this Adam text editor which I will now open these are some of the examples from last week I'm going to open oh I forgot it oh I turn one of these days I will install I term and and and look at the wonder that is I term and do a video about it mmm okay I'll do that right after I do Chrome extension so right before right before I'll do I turn before Chrome extension Chrome extensions are coming this an ester though because they're on my list for the course that I'm teaching right now so all right so what wherever I want to go now I want to go to the desktop and maybe under opie and I want to run a little web server so I can take a look at whatever it is that I'm doing what's what's probably the last one the particles was the coding challenge I'd probably opt to it's kind of where I left off let's see is there an error here oh it's mouse dragged right okay excellent all right so this is perfect this is where I left off so what I want to look at it's a couple things here Simon also loyal royal viewer Simon helped me with a todo list which now I don't have in front of my eyes anymore ah and actually I was looking at let's look at this together so to places where I want to look one is let's see which is this playlist one is foundations of programming in JavaScript and the other one is I want to look at the sorry I want to look at the processing intro tutorials here and because these are a good reference for me the objects and arrays please don't start playing videos here okay by the way has anybody noticed that these days if you're watching one of my videos sometimes I appear in an ad before in my videos it's a strange experiment that we're trying here in that one of the things that I'm helping to promote is a new undergraduate program that's starting next fall it's called interactive media arts it's in New York City this is the website ITP NYU edu slash ima there's gonna be an open house I think maybe even like this coming weekend oh that's right the dates are on this website if you're interested you're planning to schools University College and you're thinking about doing something in I guess what is this called again Interactive Media Arts this might be the place for you so sometimes you might see a little ad for me talking about the interactive media arts on my videos before my videos I was there my in this picture this is where I am in this picture oh no I'm gone but I was in that picture okay so so this is fine this is this is fine nothing here that I need more on objects yes so these two yeah so Simon's list is really quite good it's pretty comprehensive here because it's noticing it's the same as what I have but if I think about where I left off was here add adding and removing objects ah what sec oh but that's from a year ago so this hmm I I have an idea what I'm gonna do now is so in my in my new one that I made which was 7.3 which was arrays of objects I actually did the adding so what I want to do is I'm going to do a removing and removing objects I'm gonna do the clicking on objects in the same video because when you click on it I'll remove it maybe that'll work and in Simon's big so helpful Scott my full list here so if I'm following that list what I'm on next is more on deleting elements from arrays yeah let's do the deleting interesting let's do the clicking let's do the clicking then I'll do the deleting for the clicking I don't know I'm gonna do something expanding on this video I will improvise okay so let's go back to the browser I guess I'll leave that stuff open here we are this is the one where let me just adjust this a little bit o P too and actually what I'm gonna do is oh there goes the camera don't be alarmed this is just the point on the coding train where I know that a half an hour has passed I better get started doing some coding and it's where I'm going to just I'm going to now also I want to reveal and finders what I want to do is there a thing for that show and finder and then I want to make one called op3 and I want to look at that code and I want open that up here op3 there we go okay so I am now ready I think for the next video that I want to do let me minimize this and I think we're good so what's going on here so one of the things that I do it's very confusing if you happen to decide you want to tune watch what it's live streams why I'm not really sure you would want to do that but people seem to a number of people if I could look it up now I have a lot of different playlists and a lot of different threads of different topics I know I have this kind of like machine learning playlist that's kind of on hold for the moment that I did a little video to explain why mostly what I try to do is I try to make content related to the courses that I'm teaching here at New York University so right now the two courses that I'm teaching are one is an introduction to programming course where people have never programmed before so I'm and I previously made a whole playlist for that course but I use a lot of old older es5 syntax I'm redoing some of these videos with es6 classes so that's that's what I'm about to start with so I'm kind of jumping into the middle of making a tutorial for a playlist you're watching along because hey you might learn something or maybe you might give me some feedback or you just have this on in the background while you're making paper clips just go make the paper clips paper oh we can check on them soon I think it's been long enough since I look that I can look right kind of look maybe maybe okay so that's what I'm doing the other topic the thread that I'm on is for my class called here at HP it's called programming from A to Z but in on YouTube I'm calling it programming with text because the programming from A to Z makes it sound like it's a beginner course and it's not at all and so the topic that I'm kind of working on right now is chatbots and so I'm gonna do stuff with speech to text and text to speech in the browser so that you could create a conversational interface so those are my two goals for today it's 330 if if all goes well I'll be here till 530 if all doesn't go well I will be gone sooner are here lingers yeah but that's kind of my plan so let me take a minute before I go into the first tutorial to take a look at the chat I'm gonna look at the slack chat and the YouTube chat to the extent that I can am I missing something important that I forget something that I usually do is there I do you have any questions you want to ask before I get started let me know oh wait I should say that the time for guessing has ended I should have probably let's go to paperclip train 13 minutes ago and can we guess twice yeah that's a good question well I don't know what to do about that Cubs ten says to notice me how is my day random number reading I did forget oh ok so there's a bunch of things being asked right now I don't know if you guys are just talking about eclipses in the chat or if if that's actually a question but on my list I would love to get to this at some point is to look at how to make up library for processing in eclipse and actually how to work with processing the Java based platform in Eclipse because it opens up a lot of doors for those of you who enjoy that platform that programming environment and want to contribute to it how is my day oh my day was great because oops this is now blank but because this extra video coding challenge thing is coming soon and it was cool it was awesome I'm really excited about it but it wasn't so great because I really did not sleep and very tired and I this is like a holly want some of the busiest time of the year also because I am getting ready for processing day so one thing I should mention is this is next Saturday October 21st at the MIT Media Lab tickets are still on sale for this that just so you know that so probably look at Wonka there's pictures oh look there's a picture of me and some other wonderful people Te'o and Choi who has been organizing this event called processing day there is a community clouds project that I've been working on to make name tags I'm gonna do a coding challenge live at processing day so if you're in the Boston area and are interested in coming please do this is the first time that we're having kind of an official processing community event here some of the other wonderful speakers who will be there as well well look there's like a schedule at 220 this is what this is me at 220 oh boy I'm getting nervous now anyway uh okay answering questions austin asks did we get the nametags sort oh there's a new Adam ID I do not know about this else do we get the nametags sorted out that's in in progress there's a nice me I am so me built a really nice system to generate SVG's and hopefully that's gonna be enough to do the printing is it like scratch day well I didn't attend scratch day so I couldn't say for sure but certainly scratch day is a impetus and in inspiration for us doing an event like this there's also in our do we know day which is I would say like a similar event and scratch is a wonderful project I'll use it I've used it a lot for with kids and stuff like that so you can work with processing by eclipse yeah processing and I should processing is a if I if I run it here and I think I need to download the newer version this is a selfcontained application that you can run on Windows Mac or Linux you can write code in here whoops you can write code in here it look if you've seen my recent videos where I'm mostly using p5.js the there's a lot that's similar in terms of the naming but this is actually Java syntax so the syntax the language that this is built on top of his Java so this environment is meant to kind of ease you into programming and make creative sketching coding design stuff I do a lot of coding challenges in processing I don't use it as much as I would like to just because it's so convenient to be able to put the p5.js stuff in the browser to share and get contributions but I aspire to go back to my processing roots and use it more in videos but since this is built on top of Java if you want to contribute to the development of the IDE itself or to the library itself behind all of the functions that are part of the code you might write or add a contribution like a library or a tool or a mode there are modes like for example I could switch this to Opie 5 jazz mode I always forget this is there did I do a video on that because I meant to or Python mode there's different modes and things so I would encourage you to take a look at that if you're interested okay so I think that was my that was my that was my answering some questions and making sure I didn't miss anything somebody said I should read some random numbers but I'll come back to that later okay let's check on the paper flips I need some I need some paper clip music it needs to be very relaxing I'm looking for something I don't have anything if I play this like these like Mozart tracks that I downloaded from Audio hero which is a service that has royaltyfree music that you can that you can get you can sign up for and pay for but once I put them on one of my videos it was immediately I got a copyright violation notice alright can you guys hear the chairs and furniture going by in the hallway right now I've got a thousand paper clips I have funds are in serious trouble my unsold inventory I've got a pretty decent amount of wire whoo boy I just bought a lot of wire I didn't mean to do that all right let's let's lower the price a little bit and that's good and let's let this go all right I'm not doing very well the paperclips don't makes it excellent point and the chat it's not your paper clips it's our paper clips I still haven't come up with a I think what I'm gonna have to do just for fairness is if you make more than one guess I'm gonna take your first one or I'll take your I think your last one I'll seem like you change your mind I'll take your last one up until the 330 p.m. cutoff 34 minutes it okay good to keep me in check let's do some coding if anybody really wants to help me out I could just really use like a whole new sound board with like a little button for like beginning to code and some music for reading random numbers and some waiting musics and debugging music some other like weird sound effects Emily's going to hear as if they exist but they don't I like this one though let's do some code my hand is cut off kid okay what workshop that let's come over here and erase some whiteboard my physical therapist says that erasing a whiteboard it's actually a really good thing for me to do so requires need to use my tricep muscles which are still very very weak apply pressure to the wall and let me see if these the corners is that a corner no the corner is more like here that's fine the corner is like here how's the glare how's everything alright so here we go hello this is a good question there's a good question in the chat loesel macho's asks can you experience li explain why you can't use the random function outside of set up in the p5.js web editor well first of all this is not this is not editor specific if I say let Val equal random 100 like this seems like I should be able to do this right right why not let me go and refresh and I've got an error and look at this did you just try to use five Jazz's random function if so you may want to move it into your sketches setup function for more details see frequently asked questions why can't I assign so first of all you can take a look at this error message click on it and take a look but I'll I will I will I will explain to you what's going on here this is a sort of a strange thing so when a page loads you can start executing JavaScript immediately this just javascript file is loading as its reference in the HTML page but you cannot guarantee that there is an event that happens it's often called like onload maybe are ready and that event is an event that occurs when everything associated with the page loaded all the JavaScript files the style SCSS file all the elements on the page everything is loaded and one of those things that has to load is the p5.js library and the setup function p5.js is the place where you can which guarantees that everything is loaded loaded so far so while I could do something like let Val equals math dot random times 100 which would essentially be the equivalent and I could say Val and I've got that random number this is totally fine because that's coming from native JavaScript that's just the math library is just available for you instantly it's part of the browser itself essentially whereas the p5.js library isn't available unless it's finished loading and it's not finished loading until setup and random as part of that so it doesn't know what it is unless you're in setup alright hopefully that answer that question and now let us begin I'm gonna move this bug out of the way this is going to be something like objects and mouse interaction or clicking on objects something like that it's back for another video about objects and classes and stuff using javascript and p5 GS so one of the things that I get asked all the time I think you know I'm wider around the street people with like hey you there if I made a bunch of bubble objects in a canvas in the browser you imagine if this actually happened to be on the street and I want to like interact with them with the mouse individually like how would I know if the mouse is hovering over one versus the other how would I deal with that well it's just a little bit of an aside first before so this is what I want to implement in this video how can you as how can you have the user interact with individual objects how do I set the code to make that happen how's this work so here's the thing what eventually if you're watching all of these videos in the order that they are there's going to be a time in the future I recording these videos in the past but for you it will be the future where I will add things below the canvas like there'll be a button here or like a box with text in it and the canvas is actually one of those things too while on this page is a canvas I could put other things on this page everything on a web webpage can register events it can register this event of like a click on that's not really an event or I mouse over right I and and there's all sorts of fancy ways in JavaScript and in p5.js to handle all these different types of events to know how users are interacting with things but this thing here this thing here is one thing the canvas the only thing that p5 just knows is if you're clicking on the canvas or not and actually to be honest if you click off the canvas it's gonna make one kind of like it is mined off the canvas that might wander on which it just saw happen because I'm using this global mousepressed event I have an event it's just press the mouse anywhere but what if I want to have an event that's like only when I click on this circle so because these aren't separate the circles are my own invention they're pixels that I've drawn in their space it's up to me as the programmer the the person who designed this sketch to figure out how to handle that and so that's what I'm gonna do in this video so let me think about what would make sense I think what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna rewrite this sketch a little bit I'm gonna get rid of this mouse press function I mean I'm gonna come back to it but in in setup I'm going to say like let X equal random with let y equal random height let R equal random 10 comma 50 and then I'm going to say I'm gonna just make this new bubble I'm gonna take this exact code from the bottom you're over there never know where to look one of these days I'll figure it out take this exact code from the bottom and I'm gonna make a new bubble alright so actually let's do this first let's just pretend we only have one let's go let's peel away from the array for a second and let's simplify our lives and let's I'm just going to make a single bubble object and that's gonna be it and forget about this array just for a little bit and so I'll come back to the array eventually now notice that this I'm not changing this bubble class at all it's still the same thing what I wear is it ah but I do need to say that individual bubble move bubble dots show so you might let so what I want to do is I want to have something to happen when I click on that bubble so your first instinct might be AHA well there's this mousepressed function that I can write out here oh ah look at this I wrote this nice mouse press function right out here yeah so why not why not there's this bubble class that I've been learning all about right I just do I know let's just do this console.log clicked on bubble right won't that work that'll work oh I'm so excited this is gonna work nothing's happening nothing's happening so I've sent you in the completely wrong direction although the instinct is kind of right yeah this is like a function that's just out in the wild it's global so it's for any mousepressed this is a function that's inside of the bubble so it's fine but here's the thing this this function mousepressed is a special function that p5 recognizes just like set up a draw or special functions of p5 recognizes p5 is not going to go inside of these new classes that you write and somehow recognize that you could have a mouse press function know where the object is figure out its this is not part of its capability wouldn't I don't even know how it could even be capable of that but there isn't any reason why I couldn't write a function and you know it's a little bit problematic for me to call it mousepressed so maybe I'm just gonna call it like let's just call it like clicked for right now there's no reason why I couldn't inside of the mouse pressed function say hey whatever the user clicks the mouse I know that globally why don't I just call another function inside any of my objects that need to handle that click so I'm gonna say bubble clicked so now look at this it's gonna work let's get a bigger one it's gonna work okay I'm gonna click on it okay look I clicked on the bubble look at me do it again oh well the three times I'm gonna take out over here now six times seven times eight so here's the thing remember this is a global mousepressed so I can call my function on this bubble object but it's just gonna do this every single time it's up to me to write some code to figure out wherever wherever I click the mouse I know where the bubble is and I know how big it is I know it's X and it's why it's our I know it's this dot X is this that Y is this not our what I need to figure out now I'm thinking about the paper clips don't think about the paper clips somebody will watch this video and no idea what you're talking about because they're not watching the live stream don't talk about the paper clips back mystery mystery the mystery of the paper clips this dot note if you know the X the Y and the R we can write some code so I could say something like hmm if okay well how do you so here's here's here's a little bit of a moment here let's say what I one of the things I need to figure out and I've probably done this in other videos but this seems like a nice time to to talk it through is if I have a circle how do I know if a point is inside the circle or is outside the circle because what I'm trying to do is figure out is the mouse that's the mouse arrow did it did it click inside or outside or inside the circle I could ask the same question for a square I couldn't ask that question for a triangle I could ask that question for some arbitrary strangely shaped polygon and all of these are going to get progressively more complex the square in the circle are pretty rectangle and a circle are pretty easy to do this is much harder but all of this is possible the point is I need to write some code to figure that out that code needs to go here did wherever that mouse is is it actually related to where this dot X that's not why did this not our R so how do I do that so one of the nice things that on P 5 and both processing if you were using that instead have is a function called dist which stands for distance and I can give that function two points arbitrarily x1 y1 x2 y2 so if I make one of those point to the center of the circle maybe I'll call that CX CY and then the other point over here for example is the mouse where the mouse clicked we'll call that MX my I could pass these values into that distance function and get the length of this line call that D something that I happen to know from my code oops wrong button is R the radius of the circle now I'm actually using it as the radius I am because remember the ellipse function itself wants the diameter so R really means the radius which is half of the diameter what do I mean by that so I happen to know this dot R is this distance or another way of looking at it it's this distance right here so guess what this is probably popping into your head just to count now if the distance between the center and the mouse is greater than the radius then that point is outside the circle if it's less than the radius then that point is inside the circle okay so now we could come over here and I could start to add that code I can say let me find the distance between Mouse X Mouse Y and this X and this dot Y and I can now say if D now this is not this dot D because this is a local variable that I'm using just to calculate for at this moment the distance is less than this dot R then console.log clicked on bubble now we're really getting somewhere whoa what just happened did I am I playing something sorry okay do this again now we're really getting somewhere okay so this is a moment of success and that was really loud that's gonna ruin this video so what I've now successfully done is I'm able to determine and only print out this statement so what's the full story here this is where I know that the mouse has been pressed anywhere so it's up to me to now to say like well if the mouse is pressed anywhere let's check if the mouse is pressed for this bubble and guess what let's go back to the array now let's put this array back let's make this a single bubble let's put that into the array and now this loop here just like in draw when I want to move and show everything there's no reason why I couldn't when I click the mouse use that same exact loop and just call clicked on all the bubbles that are in that array so let's see if this works whoops okay I have some air bubble is not too fine a draw so I forgot that I still have this old individual bubble that I don't need anymore so I can click on it it worked I can click outside I don't see anything let's let's actually add now let's do this five times in setup so I'm gonna add five bubbles and now in theory it's we're getting that message if I click on any of them but here's the thing I really want something to happen so I could change its color let's let's actually here's the thing what if I what if I were to just hover over these bubbles and I wanted to change their color if I were to hover over the bubbles and then have something on it so actually you know what there's another important point that I want to make I don't there's something about this function that I don't really like and yes I'm gonna do this from time to time and you will too and it's okay but right there I don't love the fact that I'm using mouse X and mouse Y those are global variables in theory I want my bubble class to only know about itself it doesn't really need to know about the outside world is it to know what's on a canvas that there's a mouse and in theory what I want to be able to do is right of generic bubble class that I could say hey is the mouth cooking on you or is this other sensor overtop of this other object at the same location as you or you know I switch it to using like a Kinect to track my hand is my hand location near this bubble so really what would make more sense is for me to actually put arguments into the clicked function and again I'm doing this sort of awful thing where I'm giving them the same name as arguments in SSR as properties of the class itself I'm giving these parameters X and y the same name is this dot X this that Y but javascript is very good at distinguishing because these this x and y are the ones that are coming in through the parameters and these here are the properties this dot of the object itself but maybe if I want it to be like a little less confusing about I might say like px py for like pixel X or pixel Y or something like that and so now what makes more sense is what I really want to do is pass in Mouse X Mouse Y because what I want to do when the mouse is pressed is ask does this point and really I might do something like contains or inside or it includes likes I could name that function in some other way because really what I'm asking is is that is that is that point inside that object so interestingly enough what I could do is let's let's give the bubbles a color I'm gonna give it like a brightness and make it zero and I'm going to say fill this dot brightness and I'll give it some alpha and then what I'm gonna do is when I've clicked on them I am going to say this dot brightness equals 255 so the idea here is that now bubbles each have a new property a color it starts at zero and any time I click on one of them I turn that one a different color so what's really nice about this is I have one function one function that's part of the class and I could use that function in any way that I want though it just all that function does is test if any generic point is inside a given object and if it is if it is inside that if it sorry inside and I'm inside that shape the geometry of that object if it is I change its color and the way I happen to be using it is by saying hey whenever the user clicks the mouse anywhere let's go check all the objects in our array and see if the mouse is inside them so all right I think this ends this particular video I need to do something where I one thing I would really actually like to do what you should usually do an exercise here so if you're watching this I'm trying to make it head do something different if you hover over the the bubble change the bubble to a rectangle see if you can make the same thing work with a rectangle allow yourself to click on it twice turn it on and off that's something you could try and have a different behavior for when you click on it versus when you just mouse over at those types of things but what I want to do something I want to do and may be able to in the next video is when I click on each one of these I remove them from from the world so I can i can add bubbles and delete them somehow so we have to look at how to delete things from an array okay see you in the next video perhaps okay bye all right people still actually watching this I have 5 new notifications whoa whoa alcázar doing some kind of like magic and the chat there about getting objects to like use mouse press that place outside the scope of my video here where did I do with my uh here's my mug that I put over there oh boy I better check on the paper clips huh these guesses are too late by the way the guest has had to be timestamped where do I see the timestamp if I go here right 1220 oh wait so is this oh oh the timestamps on Twitter maybe I'm seeing them at Pacific time okay so let's check on our paper clips boy them to be terribly definitely more auto clippers I'll just get as many as I can all right now I need to lower that price that should be better camera went off all right so I did Simon your perfect timing placing that list in again so deleting elements is definitely something that I want to do interacting with objects is done objects is talking to other objects clicking on objects in deleting them okay and to out more okay so let's see the paper good things gonna speed up right you know I just got to get to a hundred dollars let this go to a hundred dollars I think I've got plenty of wire well look at this oh boy oh I've got computational resources now I've got conversation okay you guys mind if we just take a couple minutes here so this needs to get to a thousand or 750 and I can improve the auto cliff burrs I can't quite I have two extra let's oh no no I only have to trust so I need to get three thousand clips and I'll get an extra trust which you can give more memory or more processor I don't know which one so what should I do next I think probably Oh paper clips isn't running when I'm in another tap did anybody know that when making their guests let's check this okay oh boy I wonder if I take it out and what if I do this now it's running but I can't have this in the background of my video tutorials oh but let's see what if I put it behind there okay so here I am I'm like dude do I'm making a video tutorial about coding this is me making video to talk about Kony I already forgot and now I'm gonna check the paper clips twentyseven twentyseven hundred so if I go away again to this other one and it's like if I wait a little bit whoa this one laptop it should be above 3000 now right let's see oh oh yeah well I got 3000 I ran out I need wire do I have money for wire thank God I have money for a wire I can improve my Auto Clippers oh I definitely want to definitely need this revenue tracker that's gonna be really helpful let's raise the price a little bit let's buy some more wire I really don't want to run out of wire let's buy some more Auto Clippers raise the price again and am I at 500 yet okay I need to get this revenue track go to the next video I swear let's get to this revenue tracker of case 69 cents per second let's see him let's move that up to $1.00 per second okay that's good and this should be good this should work for a little while a dollar 36 per second okay I'm gonna let this go I think I'm in pretty good shape oh I've got more we need some more memory so let's go okay so the next thing I want to do is a video I'm gonna do one more of these object tutorials and by the way added to that list I should do something about getters and setters because I do think that's a it's kind of beyond the scope of what I'm doing in my video tutorials but it's a useful feature of es6 classes that's something I'm not completely used to because it's a little bit different than how it works in like Java or C++ but I should do that alright yes check I'd know making a paperclip game coding challenges like the worst idea for me ever I will never leave this room I already have a problem I already have enough of a problem Frank why what have you done this to me why please just tell me is there an end let me let me just check I'm gonna check my actual oh this is not going because self cricket oh I can get the selfcorrecting supply chain you guys can't see this but let me just okay alright I don't know what's going on here I'll come back to that later back to the selection the whistle is mountainy all right so if you're joining late I'm so sorry if you've been here old time I'm also very sorry so now what I want to do is let's do the clicking so first of all these these bubbles are really making me crazy the bubbles are so nervously bouncing around let me let me just adjust the class a little bit to just be a little less frenetic okay so I think what I'm gonna do ah and what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna quickly take this op4 and what I'm gonna do is what I'm going to do is I'm gonna call this point I'm gonna call this point over or maybe mouse over I don't know call that mouse over it's probably terrible name no no what should I call this does a generic just call it contains maybe that'll work and what I'm going to do is I'm gonna take this and just move it to draw I don't need to move it to draw just gonna say bubbles index I'd contains Mouse X Mouse why I know what to call it roll over that's what I want roll over and I'm just change this to rollover and I'm gonna say otherwise this dot brightness equals zero so what I want to start with let's see if this works OOP something the wrong one for uh oh I edited the wrong code didn't I that's fine at least I saved it back up yeah okay hold on let me rename these so this one this one is actually four and this one is now three and yeah okay so this is what I want I want them to be generally bigger too because it's a little easier to and I can take this out this extra code and I am going to just have them be generally a little bit bigger in size whoops this I don't need okay so I just quickly changed this to be have a rollover and let me also make ten of them just to have more whoa hold on did I hit safe oh I mean three still ah crud I'm gonna have to pick have to fix this later I saved over what I was doing oh just bear with me everybody this will get fixed eventually okay make twenty to sixty and make ten of them yeah if by the way a little note to self e'er if you mess with the file system outside of Adam but leave everything open and Adam your move files around you save them it's gonna save it back to where it was originally so doesn't know about you moving the file system okay so what I want to add to this is click to delete click er I should really name things better yes I definitely should when is the paper clips reveal it will be whenever I am done with the whenever I am done with the live stream and I will review wait a second oh no it's still it's a different I was so worried I closed it by accident oh no hold on I've run out of stuff okay any more wire we just buy some more wire here let me improve the wire extrusion buy some more wire dollar okay we really can't have I I need more memory I should really add more processors and I should get some more Clippers cuz I'm running out of there we go so I want this to stabilize a certain amount of money / yeah I want this just maybe I should some more let's make some more Clippers we want this to stabilize let's lower the price a little bit yeah that's good that's what I wanted to see I'm running out of I'm not clipping them fast enough I'm selling them faster than I can clip them let's go back to five cents I want this to settle at least $1.00 per second right now okay before I go back to the codec okay that's pretty good all right what am i no no no over here for ten we've got lots of time at 430 no no this is not my game I did not make this game Frank Frank made this game Oh Frank the tain whistle anyway all right so hello it's me back again with some these bubbles again Oh a the bubbles someday I'll think of something besides bubbles but the bubbles kind of works so I the last video I kind of looked at how I could click on the bubbles and change their color and now I just adjusted the code a little bit so I could mouse over the bubbles and you know I could show you what I did I did this inbetween where I now I'm using this function called rollover I rename the click function to rollover I gave it these arguments and in doing the same sort of thing if the distance is if it's inside the circle I turn it white if it's not I turn it black so what I want to do now is I want to click on the bubble and have it pop I wanted to disappear how do I do that well good news everybody I kind of did I didn't all of that in the last video except for the whole what did I forget to do oh the deleting from an array so let's let's think about that so okay how do i how do I remove something I mean one one way I could remove something is just stop drawing it or move it way off screen and there was it there were in the old days without the code with like 6 feet of snow next to me sometimes you had to do that because it'd this fixed array you couldn't take things out you couldn't add things to it so you would kind of like reuse elements and move them off screen but here in the land of JavaScript there's a really nice thing you could do it I'm gonna come over here to this camera that's not on and I'm gonna come over here I'm gonna erase this distance thing and at some point there's gonna be a jump cut to where I have erased it and now what do I want to talk about so I have this a ring one of the things that I showed in a previous video okay so let's say this array is called bubbles because that's what it's called the whole array when apart the whole array I'm saying the word bubbles when I am referencing a specific element of the array I reference it by its index often within square brackets and the index numbers are 0 1 2 3 4 5 so this is bubbles in deck now one of the things I showed in the previous video is that there is a function called push that function allows me to add something to the end of the array in fact there is also a function called pop and that function allows what it does is it will take something off the end of the array and pop it off so if what I wanted to do is always delete the last element of the array I could use the pop function now there are lots of other functions there's like shift I think there's even like an unshifted be crazy could just be making that up shift manager snow but here's I think where do these functions come from so there's this question that comes up over and over again in these videos and you're probably sitting there asking it to yourself wait a sec my learning JavaScript I know I sort of made me learning to code but I have my learning JavaScript my Lenape 5 is the same thing is it different well this is a complicated question and I would like in theory in my mind's eye I would like to say that these videos are just about learning to code and think about code and think computationally I happen to be using the programming language JavaScript I'm using this library p5.js to make the drawing stuff easier and it all kind of mixes together so that was kind of larger question aside this stuff that has to do with an array is not coming from p5 GS if I say ellipse this is a special function that's in p5.js what it does is it call some other functions that are just part of JavaScript without p5 GS but it's I can only say ellipse because I'm using a p5.js library these functions don't come from p5 yes they come they're just part of the JavaScript language so how do I find out a list of these and how I can use them come back over here with me alright so the place that I like to use is the Mozilla Foundation Docs I'm just saying Mozilla Foundation array JavaScript that's going to be my Google search and I'm gonna go here so this is here's the thing one of the reasons why I like using p5 Jessen tutorials is look here's the reference here's all the stuff it's kind of like one page if I'm actually stuff but it's kind of selfcontained and it's it has a smaller world view so to speak it's like it's a walled garden so to speak this is like the JavaScript documentation there is so much here you couldn't possibly mean you could but it would be it would take you a long time to read through everything but here I am at least on a page that's giving me some information about arrays and you can see look Obeid there's this what is that oh my god okay it's a for each loop someday I'll have to come back and look at that and what does that do and why would you use it oh my god oh my goodness okay but you can see here look pop oh I'm not I'm not crazy shift on shift you can see what these functions do where are you you're over there and look there's a whole list of them so let's look through them maybe we can find one that removes something from an array pink at copy within entries every filter fine I got it go for each okay well looking for own so here's the thing us place I happen to know wouldn't it be nice to just be one that's called like delete or remove but the one that I'm looking for is this place and this method changes the contents of an array by removing existing elements and or adding elements it can do a lot of different things I want to use it for the deletion so if I come back over here I want to use this slice function so can I ran up here and you can see it yes slice slice takes two arguments and there may be other ways to use slice but for the purpose of this video tutorial the two arguments are what matters the first one is an index and the second one and I'm kind of moving sorry doing that thing where I'm drawing off the whiteboard gasps okay go to town here that's a little bit better the first one is it index the second one I'll just call how many so if I say slice index how many comma 1 what it does is it just takes this element and slices it out removes it from the array let me show you what I need so one of the things that I could do to sort of investigate this is I could just use the JavaScript console here in the browser that I'm using right now and I could say let's words equal you know rainbow and unicorn and kitten I was gonna try to think this thing else turtle paper clip paper plinth words dot push paper clip okay so now we can see I have this array with five things in it and if I were to say words dot splice index 3 comma 1 what should happen here 0 1 2 3 I should look at this whoops so one thing is interesting about slice is as it deletes it kind of like hands it back to you I'm not gonna use that in this video but it's kind of interest that it does that it's probably too much information here but if I look at the array words right now you'll notice turtle is gone it's just rainbow uniform kitten so the idea here is that even though I can do a lot with this slice function if I just want to delete one element from the array I could say hey this particular number index just that one and so that's what I want to do what I want to do is how could I then with this code example click on this and remove it actually delete it from the array well I know there's so much here you know what I should do here's the thing look at this function rollover hmm there's something kind of interesting about this function which is that I'm doing two things at once one thing is that I'm checking to see if the mouth if that point is inside that bubble and then I'm also changing its color and it probably makes more sense for me to have this function be much more generic for it just to like return true or false because I might want to reuse this ideas it was a point over that is a point over that object that circle other times so I'm gonna change this to return true whoops if if it's rolling over return true otherwise return false and then I'm gonna write a new function called change color and I'm going to say this dot brightness equals 255 so I wanted to remove the idea of the changing color from here because now I can say if write that function you might not have you you know I covered return what return means in my functions video tutorial but you know when do I ever need that well now I need it what I want to say but not remove I'm not removing it sorry a change color I'm that's what I'm gonna do eventually right I want to say and and maybe I shouldn't call it roll over anymore I should just say contains let's call it contains and i'ma change it to contains what I want to do right this function is going to return true or false and I know some of you are saying I could just return this this statement itself violates true or false so it's redundant to say if it's true return true if it's false return false I could just say return its value true or false I'll let you do that to simplify your own code as an exercise but now what I can do here this should be exactly the same program oh I have an error contains is not a function bubble index i contains mmm you know what is contain something oh boy am I not allowed to use the word contains what if I missed I think I might not be allowed to use the word contains I'm gonna sort it let's pause for a second here I keep closing this lecture includes as part of an array oh oh you're telling me the slice displays did I write slice okay record scratch sound do I have that hold on a second apparently I've done something horrible oh look at this this whole time maybe much good could do a magic thing where after I write slice he can fade it in this should say splice apologies this should say splice splice splice splice is the correct term I will leave that up there for a second and that's gonna have to get fixed I was saying slice that hump dub over my voice and then the function need to use is nice and after that to remove an element from the array please use splice no work right yes place is kind of a say can I do you slice but just say begin and end such as always the next one I really kept saying slice yeah maybe but we'll dub it that'll be good or I can just we could put a little like popup that says I should be saying splice their help how bad could it be thank you Matt huge fudge tree extra paper clips is something wrong with the paper clips now that I'm taking a break I can check them whoops oh shoot why is this contains not working oh I just didn't save it I can't look at the I can't look at the YouTube chat because I know they could be like messing with me but okay let's see let's let's just at least check wait oh there's here's the paper clips how's the paper clip string oh I ran out of inventory again I ran out of wire there's a thing that I can get for a Y first of all I definitely need these better Auto Clippers I'm gonna need a lot more wire well let me see if I get up to the marketing real quick if I could get up to the marketing before I go back well it's actually gonna be a pretty low number for those of you are guessing low although it might just sort of like explode at a certain point okay let me get the marketing so now I can raise the price why is mine no I want to know I okay I made a dollar 67 $3.00 per second am I making enough well let's really let's lower it but I need to make more Clippers and I've got more let me get some processors I can get the creativity now let me raise the price a little bit cuz I'm I really need the thing there's a thing that you can get which like auto buys wire whenever you run out which I'm definitely going to need because I'm oh because I'm just gonna I need to buy some more auto Clippers just to get this going faster that's a little bit better now because this you can see that I could get $3.00 per second if I could make I guess I could go to four cents more of these I should really stop this right I need to come back okay this is good this is good we're at four cents I'm gonna just buy some more wire it's gonna run on a wire really fast I'm not making enough money okay let me just quickly buy a little bit more wire before I go back no it's fine I can't focus on this let's go back all right so actually I don't know how to I'm back after some mishegoss there but contains is fine I've got worried like a my overriding some builtin name but and that a my oh my hold on a sec do you think let's is object dot prototype dot contains objects dot prototype dot contains is that a function in JavaScript at something can contains no it's has own property is if it could so I think that's okay so I'm gonna just skip over that discussion I'm gonna go back to okay so so I'm gonna change this to contains which I just did and that didn't work but now I'm back because I just didn't save the file and whoops oh yeah no I do want that page and so now we're back to exactly what I had before but the point of what I was doing was that now that I've separated out the logic of just checking if a point is in something I can now in mousepressed I'm going to just grab this exact code and I'm gonna add mouse press back in so in mousepressed I can check hey does the is the mouse in there now this is when the mouse is pressed check again and then what do I want to do bubbles dot splice I comma one look that's beautiful look at this thing a beauty here I'm able to reuse that idea by saying okay just during draw all the time check if the mouse is over it if the mouse is over it changes color I know I spelled splice wrong in mousepressed when the mouse has been clicked anywhere check to see if it's in there if if you click on a particular bubble and if so delete it from the array which should cause it to disappear from the page and there we go now I kind of alright it doesn't oh I lost my changeback how did I lose that oh look at that I forgot she look interestingly enough I had this feature that one it doesn't and so what I probably should do here is give this an argument so I had this feature where it weight it changes to white when it's over back to black when it's not so I should probably give this change color function and argument like bright parameter bright and pass that in I did that kind of quickly but that fixes that and then I should be able to just delete all of them okay that's basically it now I feel like there's so many things I wanted to do with this we tried to think for a second yeah oh I'm missing an important point oh oh boy that's not it I'm missing kind of an important point and I did cover this there's a particle system coding challenge which does this but I I think I should talk about it here which is something strange just happened which is that I was iterating over the array I was checking elements zero then I was checking element two one sorry then I'm checking element two and at that little bit when I checked element two if that's the one that I clicked on and I should really call these I'm gonna call these abcdefg I pretend the particles have a letter because these index values are gonna change in a weird sort of way let me explain this again I'm checking a don't delete it I'm checking B don't delete it I'm checking C delete it so what happens next when I delete C the array all of a sudden looks like this one but it's got one fewer element in it so we don't need to race with my fingers and it's got a B no c d e f g 0 1 2 3 4 5 what was the part with what was the bubble I last checked the last bubble I checked was 3 in index 2 so in my iterating I'm now going to was set it wrong what was the last bubble I checked the last bubble I checked was bubble C in index spot right here so if I is going up by 1 the next thing it should check is index 3 and but this is what the array looks like now so if I check index 3 now I'm gonna check and see should I delete e what happened I didn't bother to check D because as soon as I removed C D becomes 2 got moves to index pot 2 and my counter moves up so I could do something like if I could add like an eye so I could say like oh if I'm deleting something like set the index back to go check the next one there's a bunch of different ways around this probably if I use that for each loop maybe that would help me somehow but I actually in this case it doesn't matter because here's the thing it only would hopes over using that sound effect in this case it doesn't matter I you know if I look at this like there's nothing wrong nothing bad happens now you only would it only would be bad if it so happens that I tried to leak two of them at once and the other one that I delete happens to be the next one in the array so none of these are overlapping right now that's so let me try to leave both of these they both deleted but yeah I could get bad luck where the I'm hovering over both of these and so only this one gets to lead and then this one doesn't get checked so again I could decrement the index but another way I could do it is if I'm actually iterating through the array backwards it doesn't matter if I remove something and the array slides could chunks back over I'm still going towards the beginning I won't miss any so you'll see that in a lot of my code examples some people like to say I I prefer generally speaking if I'm deleting stuff from the array to start at the end which is bubbles dot length minus one then have my iterator go down and then where am I where do I end I go all the way down to the first element which is at index zero the last element is the length minus one like if they're five of them zero one two three what four or five of them zero one two three four so start it 51 four go all the way down to zero so let's just make sure that this works and it does still the same exact result I can delete I can hover over and delete all of them so there you go this is a a little video about clicking and removing things from the array there's some other things for things I could do I you know here's the thing the point of me telling about this going backwards thing is more to say that hey if you are manipulating an array while you're iterating over it you should probably be careful what if for example I were adding elements to the array want it and I could maybe never get to the end right so anyway so this is really something that you need to think about so let's see what should you do in this video I have an idea something you could try is have HAP make a sketch where you can make as many bubble objects as you want but delete them when they've left the window you could try that you can also do something action I'm gonna do something for you right now which is kind of an interesting effect there's a little bonus for the end of the video that I think you could probably make something with let me save this timeout we think here I'm gonna make a new version of the code really quickly even though I've already messed that up I'm gonna make this Opie 5 I'm gonna check the chat why is this computer go to sleep filter filter still has the same issue ok for 8 look at hold on come back I'll come back to that so let me just give me a second I don't know why I'm stuck on demonstrating this but I think this is kind of useful so hold on a sec I want to demonstrate something real quick am I in five now so four there's one more thing I want to demonstrate here because I think it leads it lends itself to an interesting exercise before I do that for each apparently has the same problem but there are other fancy ways to remove things from an array okay um maybe I don't need to say that on my own so I really wanted just finished let me do this extra thing and we can decide whether it include it or not before I finish I want to add one I'm just gonna redo this example a little bit just to demonstrate one thing I'm going to put it back to the version of it which sorry which had me where I added bubbles whenever I drag the mouse so I'm gonna say Mouse dragged and I'm going to just I'm gonna add bubbles at the mouse and something like just give them all the same size just for simplicity right now so what I what this should do is give me back to this I'm kind of drawing with these bubble objects the reason why I'm showing you this is this I think might allow you to plea bit more playful and how you think about removing for example one thing I could do is I could say just if bubbles dot length is greater than is it's greater than well ten bubbles dot splice zero comma one so I'm saying like hey only just only ever have ten elements in that array and there's maybe there's a bigger news shift there to like remove just the first one but and you can see this is gives me this kind of like snakelike thing but notice as I let go each one of these is still an individual object now I've lost the clicking on it thing but and I can come back so that I think there's some more possibilities there's almost like a little object that's like a little thing that's storing its history and the reason why I talk of this is I have another video this is a kind of a hard exercise but um something good think about what if this were its own object and you had a bunch of these on the screen so I have another video that about object storing their own path that all that I'll link to from this video and so hopefully now you've got some ideas about how to remove things from an array thanks for watching alright I think I was worth keeping this video I feel like that was like a really long tutorial but probably just because it's been so long since I looked at the paper clips I'm sure I've run out of wire totally run out of wire by some wire what can I get let's get some more trust look what I want is I really want the thing where I can automatically I'll do this you slogan Oh marketing effectiveness so this is all good now I can add another processor and some more memory could buy some more wire I can buy some more auto Clippers really can lower the price a little bit raise the price there we go this is good Oh where's the price again buy some more Auto Clippers now I'm just clicking on stuff with no oh I have more processor more memory I really just want the thing that I could buy the wire automatically then I can let this go I'm at like 17,000 I think my inventory is kind of stabilized that's good buy some more wire buy some more wire buy some more wire buy some more wire by supplier and then I'm gonna go back to the tutorial stuff all right a little bit more Auto Clippers okay that's good enough for right now now wire will hopefully last us my inventory is stabilized let's go back the wire buyer comes at 7k7 7000 operations so actually I just need to I need to get this memory up to seven alright alright oh yeah 7000 down there so I definitely need that okay so let me talk about what I'm gonna do next so I have a hopefully like a little less than an hour left but I want to go back to the chat bot stuff and I'm gonna use this library call p5 speech so p5 speech p5 and so let me get this stuff out if you want github and I'm gonna go back to my chat I'm so I'm gonna that's gonna be enough for the object stuff today I still have more of those to make but I feel like it I like to be able to do both courses in the same live session so now I want to go to make a let me go to was it P 5g beat generate B speech 1 okay so now I have another and then let's run the server and what I want to do now is I'm gonna open instead the chat bot stuff in Adam I haven't Adam there it is and let me go to localhost oh I'm in the wrong I'm in the uh hold on a sec I mean the rock I mean the the did I get to 7000 wait wait hold on we're close let's please glad to get to 21,000 and the memory up to six oh I should definitely do this buy some more wire just because I can't in a little while later and I'll slower the price to five cents yeah we're doing well now alright so what I want to do now let's get to here and just get rid of this and say so um let me get I also want to do everyone can just bear with me for a second do I have I want to get my examples from my A to Z course I'm gonna need to reference them I don't know that oops so I just need to clone this repo real quick and let me let's just let's just see quickly let me just briefly see chatbots speech basics sketch let me just make sure this example works hmm whoops it's not loading the library p5 speech because I made it a submodule because I'm a lunatic hold on everybody oh yeah well I know what to do I'm gonna do this in a bad way but it'll be fine so I need to get the I need to get the P I forgot that I didn't update this which I wish I had I'm going to go here and week and then I want to say get so I'm gonna say remove our p5 Jess speech and then I'm going to p5.js speech one of these days I will get all this stuff ready beforehand and now I need to clone this don't worry it's not this complicated to use it it's just the ridiculous way that I've set this up and so now my hope is that here okay now can you hear that but probably not so let me I need to fix the sound settings here sound multi output device I think will work a lot of coding trainer can you guys hear that now hello coding training how is the how's the volume there hello okay alright so so I want to make sure that this works and I'm gonna locally bring the locally bring the locally bring the locally brain all right so now what I'm going to do is do a tutorial about the speech library I'm gonna build something like this but not as fully fleshed out and so this having that open is great I mean this open this open I can close this this is the thing that I'm gonna this is the window for what I mean a code I can close this I can close this okay so Simon's saying the sound is layering over itself many times so just to confirm if i refresh this page is easy hello to Z it's normal read the chat hold on the audio is coming from two sources now well because you're hearing it through my microphone also yeah I can't really the problem is I can make this quieter Lauro to Z alright have an idea I kind of need to be able to hear it otherwise I don't know what's going on but I can change this volume hello Josie hello Josie so that's probably not so bad hello Josie once I lowered the volume of my laptop hello Josie is it okay yeah all right I don't want to make it a little bit louder because I can barely hear a Z so let me just try to make it a little bit louder let me just put it to the middle tell me if it's okay hello Josie hello Josie is this hello okay do I need to turn it back down not bad okay I could use headphones but that would be such a like complicated nightmare hey sean is in the chat already talked about ima John ok I already mentioned ima alright I'm just reading the slack channel where I know people are vaguely trustworthy there alright let's see ok so now I'm going to talk about the ability lab or the ability project I feel like it's called the ability project now yeah so I need to say ability project okay and Luke dupois all right so first let me say something about this before I go so I'm gonna do a tutorial where I talk about what this library is and who made it and show the basic features of it so there'll be three videos I don't hopefully I can do all this before I go one is just the basics for getting the browser to talk to you two is the basics for getting the browser to listen to you and say back but now now stay back listen to you and like recognize and convert it into text so texttospeech and speechtotext those are two videos the third one is I kind of want to make that into maybe I'll do the knockknock joke thing I'll do a little chat bot knockknock joke thing where it where you do it through voice so that's what I'm gonna do before I get there so this library is here in github it's under IDM which actually is another wonderful program at NYU called integrated digital media it's part of the Tandon school for engineering Luke Du Bois who was a wonderful artist I encourage you to check out his work is also is a professor there actually a director of the IDM program and created this library p5 speech and it is just a extension of the web speech like what comes I believe this so this I think you need to use in Chrome or if you use it a different browser you're sort of I think you're reliant on what the what the what the browser what the browser gives you so but what I wanted to say is this is part of a wonderful research group at NYU called the ability project and I guess they're the ability project is an interdisciplinary research space dedicated to the intersection between disability and technology so um you could imagine why speech detects insects texttospeech is useful so I'm gonna say this again when I record the video that'll get edited later but the thing that I wanted to mention here is that this library is pretty new Luke implemented it I with the help of me I am so me recently just like changed some syntax stuff to make it a bit more a bit with the p5.js style but I this library could use probably some help I think there's some issues filed maybe you'll find some bugs if you're using it would love people to help contribute to this library I won't mention that I mean I'm and in particular something that we could use help with is that I updated those syntax and that's what I'm gonna use in the tutorial but I didn't take the time yet to update these examples with my new naming and syntax and update this documentation so if anybody wants to help with that it probably could use a little more thought in terms of the naming and the API could even be improved further but I want at least do a round of that before I made the videos so anyone who's interested in that please please participate and contribute to that okay okay I should check the paper clips right it's okay to check the paper clips now what could get marking level 200 I need to auto by I need to get that auto wire buying thing so could I possibly get up to what do I need to get 34,000 can we wait till I get to 34,000 we're making paper clips today paper clips today yes we're in the factory 33 thousand paper clips no that's a wire buyer 7,000 I just need 7,000 and I just need to get the 34,000 so oh no 55,000 clips why didn't I think 34,000 I mean I could optimize the auto clip let me just buy a lot I have got I can buy a lot I'm gonna just fill up on wire he's all my money on wire then I'm gonna make my auto Clippers even better oh I get more trust there we go that's all I needed I get to trust the processor now you got to get to 7,000 there's no end to this you have no idea how far along I am on this other computer and yet here I am starting again I'll never be able to close this browser window ever it's more truss get some more processors to get up to 7,000 how am I doing here four dollars four dollars per second that's pretty good inventory it looks kind of stable buy somewhere owner Clippers buy some more wire okay fine we've got to go do this tutorial I'll come back I'll get that in a second okay okay here we go alright so this video is going to go it's like ten point three or whatever in my chatbot series hello I am here again in my chat pot series I'm going to do two tutorials and then some other stuff about something called p5.js speech so I'm gonna get to what that is in a second but the reason why I'm doing this is as part of the chatbot series I want to investigate chatbots that a human can interact with by typing and chatbots that a human can interact with by speaking and so in order to do the speaking part without purchasing some kind of proprietary device from some company that's supposed to be your assistant or something like that all right which I will look at later eventually I want to see if we can do this in a bit more of an opensource way we looked at rive script can we just can we converse can we talk to the browser the web browser have it listened to what we're saying and talk back to us and the answer is yes and so there's a library for p5.js which is which was created by Luke Du Bois from the integrated digital media program at New York University standard school for engineering the ability project is part of the ability projects research which is an interdisciplinary research space then it came to the intersection between disability and technologies so it's a great program it's great research group you can you can imagine why speech to text and text to speech could be useful in this area for for for accessibility of different tools that exist on the Internet okay so there which is a really important topic so but I mean this video just want to kind of learn how the library works and kind of do a few playful things with it so this is the web page for the library I recently made some changes to the API the naming convention of some of these functions and so who what's it what's here right now might actually be different than what you see when you go to this page but so I'm going to use this new naming oh and this is a demonstration but I'll come back to that all right so let's just let's first look at how easy this is to use which I think it is it is it's easy it's gonna be easy and I just realized I'm gonna pause for a second because what I want to do is grab the library separate file desktop oops chat bot speech one library's so so the first thing that you want to going to want to do is actually download the job the library from github itself and I will provide in this video's description a link to where you can download that javascript file you can see that I've downloaded is here already and it's part of my project now how you end up incorporating this library into your example it can be different depending on what text editor or development environment you're using and hopefully I can help you with that but for the way that I'm working right here is I just have all the people I've just libraries and I'm adding p5 speech KS and I've got to make sure all so then I go to my sorry I go to my index.html file associated with that this sketch and go right here copy paste this and I'm just gonna add a reference to p5 speech touch ass so let's even see if that does anything we go back to the browser hit refresh okay nothing but at least I'm not I don't get I'd not having an error so what's the what's the basic sorry let me look at the most okay let me look at the most basic thing I can do with p5 speech and if I go to the get up try the Kip sorry let me open up this computer that keeps going to sleep let me look at the most basic thing that you can do with the speech library which is just have the browser speak so if I go to the github page and I look down here this is kind of just a little bit of code so I'm gonna grab this I'm gonna go to my sketch KS in setup I'm going to add and I'm gonna change this to let and I'm gonna say have it's a coding train so what I need to do and I think is gonna be okay there's the there's a bunch of a variety of issues that I'm going to show you and things that you could do but just just for the basic idea I need to create a p5 speech object voice equals new P v dot speech and I just need to call voice dot speak let's just see if this works ah this is something I'm gonna show you in a minute coding train did you hear that coding train it speaks to me okay so that's basically it so one of the nice things is I'm done like if I have some text you know I could have a whole interactive system when I click the mouse or I do this button or whatever and it's then it speaks it doesn't speak it could say anything the text could be generative it could use any of my you know weird crazy like generate poetry examples but there the reason why I this not gonna just end this video right now is the library actually provides a bunch of other features now these features are dependent on the web speech API and if I understand it correctly you're kind of limited to what the browser supports so which voices are available does it actually work so I'm doing this all in Chrome on a Mac and I imagine some of you might try this in different browsers a different operating systems so let me know what works and what doesn't work maybe we can contribute to the library if it doesn't work in a certain browser to help it work but again the browser has to support the web speech feature and okay but one of the things you can do is actually change the voice so let's let's look at how I might do that so I think I can say something like console.log voice dot voices so in this voice object I probably I'll call this speech just to be less confusing there is a property which is a list of all of the different voices that are supportive so let's hit refresh and look at this of poises not defined all right speech coding trainer but look it's empty so here's the thing you don't have to wait for it to be ready if all you want to do is use the default voice but if you want to try a different voice you need a callback a vend callback that says like hey i've loaded all the other possible and the way that you do that is by passing in an argument to the new p5 speech constructor I can say something like voice ready then I can write a function called voice ready and in that function I can console.log speech type voices I think this is gonna work coding train so now we can see this whole list of voices and witty what there's a lot of them like there's 82 of them and what's one that I might want to be interested in look they all have names so we could look here and the name is actually important it's the key word you can use to assign a different voice I happen to know there's one called cellos I think so one thing I want to just add here is I'm just gonna add the mouse pressed function and in the mouse press function I'm going to say speech speak coating train so let's just make sure this works oops ah so I need to make speech a global variable let speech timeout now we need to make speech global variable it did that hit refresh coding train coding train coding trains but every time I click the mouse it speaks but in theory now I should be able to say let's just try assigning a voice speech dot voice that's what was the one I just looked at was called Moira let's let's look at in a different random one Alice let's try Alice now I don't know if this is right let's see if this is right I don't remember their speech that voice is not a function pause I forget what it is but look at my example which I forgot cuz I don't remember the naming of the functions normally I would just go and look in the reference but I didn't speak set voice that's a much better name so it's not voice I should remember this it's set voice I could say set voice Alice clothing today clothing today so there's Alice one of my favorites I think it's called cellos I'm sorry three beings are weird I can barely hear that voice but it makes me want to do something when I hear at the cellos um so let's just do something one thing I could emphasize here is if these are the voices I could say let voices equal speech voices then I could say let voice equal random voices so the random function in p5 will pick a random element from the array and I could do set voice I could probably actually just say set voice the voice or set voiced/unvoiced name let's see if it works with just that voice object so I'm going to say console.log voice name so now we'll get a random on each time coding train coding train coding train noting train it's the same voice so I think we might actually have to say set voice voice that namecalling train codes in plain gold ink so now you can hear all the different speech that all the different voices I'm not going through all them but I'm just picking a random one each time all right what are some other things you might want to do well let me add a canvas here this is like that's really useful create canvas let's say 400 comma 100 and what I want to do is I want to display some information like I want to animate something when this when the browser is speaking and not animate when it's not speaking so there are some callbacks if I could just remember what they are speech dot start did maybe start speaking and speech dot ended and ended and speaking I think these are so this is just like with the Dom library if we've used the p5 Dom library where you have like a slider or a button and if you have a callback that you assigned if you press on the button or if you move the slider I'm now assigning a callback and I might have gotten these names wrong I'm gonna fix them if I got them wrong but I'm assigning a callback to when when the browser starts speaking and when it ends speaking and so this means I need to write these functions so I could say start speaking background green and then function and speaking that and this is I'm not doing anything sophisticated in terms of the draw loop or any animation but you could imagine doing something background 0 and let's say background zero when it starts so now if I load the page building frame oh yeah it's working I have this whatever so that canvas turns green whenever the voice is speaking so that's a useful thing you can do and the other thing you can do which is kind of nice is you can change three things the rate the pitch and the volume and I believe so I believe it's like set volume so if I made it like point one it should be very quiet set rate so let's let's actually let's just so volume you can imagine I believe the range is between zero and one it might be something else but we could look that up or experiment with it but let's forget about the volume for a second because I want you to be able to hear it let's try it set rate and what I'm gonna do now is not give it a random voice anymore because I want it to be able to recognize what it's doing so let's take out the set voice so it's gonna be the default voice now oops set rate is not a function timeout so what is it Oh set rate is a function set rates the fonts are pitch Oh set rate is not my naming is a bit confusing set rate is something that you assigned to the speech object itself the voice is the you know each voice doesn't have its own rate it's the rate that it's currently gonna speak with that voice so I'm just doing this wrong because I this should be speech set rate tota trainer Tony trainer so you hear that twice as fast right and if I were to say 0.5 coding train coding train it's much slower and then I could also I can also say speech dot set pitch I don't know what the range is for this I should I'm gonna just say 5 just to see anyway so you get the idea let's put this the rate back to 1 and put the pitch to like 0.2 coding training coding training Oh coding training I wonder if I need to give it a negative number coding training coding train so I'm trying to make the pitch lower Kodu tree yeah that's definitely higher coda tree so I wonder and one would be the default I say right coding training coding train I don't know how to make it lower timeout a second look anybody know I'm looking in the slack channel here set volume set rates that Leto set Lang set voice voice doesn't seem to use anything from oh but there's a list voices function shy I probably should have used that so that's good to a fraction trytry decimals right because it might demo I'm pretty sure let me look at this for a second hello Josie this is my demo hello coding train hello coding training oh hello coding training it is lower it's just I'm not slowing it down at hello coding train so yeah I think it is lower I'm just not really noticing it maybe it'll be more obvious with a local ding thing yeah but the difference in the coding train yeah with a different coding thing yeah so let me let me do the cellos voice see if that works well alright let's double back quite a bit Matt yeah when we edit this because I was like testing stuff quite a bit we'll just go to the pitch so I think what's happening here is this particular voice it's sort of hard to pick up the lower pitch so one thing I could do is just try let's assign a specific voice let's try that voice Alice and let's listen to that whoops I'm the wrong and let's listen to that clothing today coding today and now let me set the pitch to lower good evening yeah this voice you can hear it a bit it's a bit more obvious just with this voice no that's a higher pitch so set pitch set rate those are things you can play play with I just realized by the way that I believe if I say speech dot list voices that's a function which will actually just give me an array with all the voice names so this actually would have been a little bit more useful like if I say list voices and then I don't need this extra voice dot name thing and I can just say voice so now I could just pick around I don't need all the other aspects of the voice the full voice object I just want the list of all the names and I'm gonna take this out and let's just see now we're back to coding train coding train oh I'm whoops coding train coding train well what happened what's happening here what just happened here coding train whoa am I like editing the wrong sketch why is it printing everything out start speaking and speaking voice ready coding training 20 slide 2600 this is not I did something wrong coding training waitlist voices is it just I thought that what did I say Oh oh it just lists them in the console it doesn't actually return the array so nevermind forget that whole thing I mean that might be a nice thing to probably make sense to adjust the library to return the array that's just doing a fingerprint to the console I didn't realize that so scratch that whole little like spiel I gave and let's just and I don't need a second it is a little silly that I made this like separate variable whatever okay sorry oh where was I sorry to scratch that whole part coding trainer so let me put it back to where it picks a random voice and sorry hold on this was commented up so let me put it back to where it says a random voice so now the code this is the code that I'll release a different different voice each time but I want to show you I have another example that I'll link to which actually sorry pause why did I close it lol chazzy I have another example that I will link to as well which just has a bit more so this is an example I'm not gonna go through coding all this but as an exercise this might be something you try this is an example that takes all of those voice names and puts them in a dropdown menu so I could pick bells I can you know I can change the rate I can change the pitch this one is a weird one it's catching up I press the button to any time so the cue of its speaking I kind of so anyway so I encourage you to check out the code that drives this particular demo there's some other examples that are part of the p5.js github repository I mean p5 jest speech get a repository as well so see what you can make make something that talks to you in the browser and let me know how it is in the next video I'm going to do is have the browser listen to what I'm saying and print out in the browser itself what I'm saying okay so this was texttospeech right and I want to do speech to text in the next video thanks for watching alright so what did I miss Oh point oh one two two thank you for clarifying that stuff for me alright where are we five fifteen I won't try to get this so I definitely want to do that now let's check the check the paper clips alright I can get the wire buyer which I definitely need so now at least it'll by wire I have so much more I can get more memory and a little bit more processor oh I'm almost a quantum computing that's good and it needs some more auto clippers for sure I mean just oh I should get more marketing oh my god I have so much money more Clippers let's just like use up everything here and now five cents is still pretty good based on looks like this is kind of staying pretty even seven dollars per second if I lower the price it's more per second but that's gonna drain my inventory but I can just get more auto clippers I think I'll raise the price to five oh boy yeah it's like it's really really touchandgo they're here like I want I need this to sort of balance out as having some extra inventory let's try this but now I'm not selling as much some more Auto Clippers just like a couple more Oh let's double the marketing effectiveness that's that's a look at that that was good but now I really just need to make more stuff let's raise the price again let's do it ten cents eleven cents twelve cents okay I need some more Auto Clippers okay I'm gonna have to leave this gonna have to leave this where are we 154,000 okay let's go back to a speechtotext all right that's pretty good oh hello are you were still watching are you still there is the could you possibly still be there 200k all right all right where's my water you know what the problem is I'm not staying hydrated so I need to do p5 texttospeech let's do that so let me get the demo of that and see if that's working this is kind of interfere interfering pattern okay let's go here hello how are you are you listening to me one two three test four five six hello mmm what am I doing wrong that I'm not getting did I turn the continuous thing off so hold on we've got a little bit of an issue here did I break something in the library continuous true I want that not one time only I don't want to use the interim results is this not actually setting hold on did I mess something up in the library where it's not actually doing it oh look at this so I messed up something in the library so there's probably a bug in the library that we're gonna have to pull request but I should be able to fix this now it's my fault because I made changes to the library and what I'm looking for now I'm gonna fix the library Oh call back no wait so where's the okay hold on set what was that function called where am I here right no I want to go to this one I'm looking at start the start function Oh where's so let's look for start there it goes oh I could have sworn I don't know I must have messed this up but this is the definition for the start function and what I want is continuous and interim results and like I want instead of having it be variables that you said I thought the function could just set the values let me just do this right now and have to think about a better way to put this into the library but hopefully this will fix this hello one two three four hey great alright so this is working now it's what I'm not doing I don't have I have continuous on but not interim results so weirdly it's not gonna do the speech of text until I pause but it listened to everything I said and waited till I pause which which is pretty good well I'm quite impressed with how well this works all right so now we need to make this example basically so which is a pretty simple example to make but I need to also so we're gonna have to me I am semi if you're watching maybe you can help me figure out to pull request to the library because I broke the library or somebody watching could just pull request to it already but I think the reason why I'm not so sure it's like it's possible let me if you guys don't mind humoring me for a second I'm going to so in theory there are also these instance variables which should get set to these values and they should have a default can I like can I do that if it's not es6 so I'm going to do continuous sort of silly or false I don't know I don't know the best way to write this so I think the default should be I mean maybe the default should be true right when do you only want to get one thing I don't know but the interim results this should be the default definitely be false and then I can so that let me just make sure this still works I messed something up sketched a chest line 18 Oh continuous is not defined okay 1 2 3 test 4 5 6 test coding rainbow coding rainbow alright I'm great so I think it's gonna just keep listening to me no matter what I say so anybody watching this who feels like contributing to the library and at least at a minimum needs this fix but I have to think through whether this is the correct fix let's see here so now I need to do is copy paste this into this is my demo that I need to reference I can close and I need to go into speech oh no I need to make another example oh boy too many things are doing here speech 1 speech recognition let's just do that this is speech speech to speech speak and what I need to do is cop close everything because I messed everything up don't save and what I want to do is work on this sketch and I need to go to my example code in case I need to reference something so shut that open and this open and then I also need to take this fixed version of the p5.js library and where do I want to put that I want to put that in the example that I'm building now in libraries here okay I think I'm okay I think I've done everything that I meant to do save close so this is my reference this is that what I'm gonna make okay so I need to get rid of everything here and let me look at this code just so I remember so I make a new piece I've speech recognition object give it a callback then I sell it to start with the properties that I want and then I just used the callback and we can investigate what's in there okay great this is going to be really easy actually this is gonna be a pretty short video I almost don't need that but I'm gonna leave it there to reference and then I need to go back to the browser and go to here and we're good all right everybody you guys with me let me check the chat oh yeah Tim this buddy had a great point I did the worst thing ever okay I did a terrible terrible thing so my fix for the library is horrific so let me at least not do that right now it should only be if it's undefined so let me fix this this is worth looking at right now so so this is terrible because if I pass in false because I want continuous to be false that's good about to false it's gonna set it to true so that this really doesn't work I need to say if couldn't continuous equals undefined that's if I didn't give it an argument then I could set continuous if I wanted to make the default true maybe the default should be false and then this dot continuous would not would just be this right this should fix it again I'm not suggesting this is the most elegant solution but this should be if you didn't bother to define it then set it to true otherwise if you defined it as false it will be false okay I think that should fix it I'm just gonna kind of hope that I did this correctly why is it so cuz I was looking for or okay oh yeah alkis giving me a a better way to write it so why why while I'm here I'm gonna do I'm gonna do that so this is another way to write it I'm gonna thank you to Alka in the chat with Doc continuous equals continuous beep undefined oh my god true oh I can't bear it continuous commented out because I might have gotten it wrong and I'll come back to looking at that later so the what's that what that operator called the question mark oh I am trying to use es6 but the p5.js project hasn't like fully adopted es6 yet so the libraries are often written with previous to es6 syntax so while I'm working on this library I'm just keeping with es5 stuff all right well let's make this let's make this project a little worried that the I'm gonna just turn the camera on and off so it doesn't do it in the middle and I'm going to you I'm gonna have my I might as well have the example running while I'm talking cuz it'll be kind of interesting whoops hello and welcome to a video about I put the mouse in front about speech to text or speech recognition so this is part 2 the previous video I okay I'm gonna stop waiting for it now in the previous video I looked at how to take text and have the browser speak it with a variety of different voices using the p5 speech library which is built on top of the web speech API in this video I'm going to look at the p5 speech library but texttospeech or speak recognition which is actually quite an easy thing to do with the library now how you work out the interaction and how it works that's a the design is a the design problem is hard but that technically getting the library to work is pretty easy alright so I'm basically gonna this is an example running I'm going to try to build this example from scratch to look at how this works and I'm going to close this window around so this is an empty sketch right now and the first thing I want to do is create I'll make it a global variable a speech recognition I'm just gonna call it speech rec so I'm gonna create a variable called speech rec for speech recognition and I'm gonna say speech rec equals new p v dot speech rec so that's the name of the object that's built into library I've already downloaded an import of the library to this project I talked about how to do that in the previous video so the library is already available to me the p5 Jess speech library now let me run so ok no errors I'm refreshing the page no errors so here's the thing when when what we need a callback there's an event so whenever the speech recognition object has decided its listen to what you've said and knows what it is it's going to trigger an event just like a mousepressed event or a mouseover event so i'm going to call that event got speech and I'm gonna write a function got speech I'm gonna give it an argument and I'm just gonna say console.log so the idea here is that this function will will trigger it will run every time speech library things okay I heard what you said I've got it into text let me give it to you and I just want to put it into the console right now I do need one more line of code though I need to explicitly say I want the speech recognizer to start and so here speech recognizer start now if I just call dot start it's gonna start with some default settings but there's two important settings that I want to mention to you one is called continuous I'm gonna make that true and one is called interim results I'm just making up variables just to store the values true and false I could just write true and false right into the start function but naming them so we know what they are continuous means that without continuous it's just gonna listen to your speech one time at one time only and then it's gonna be done if you want to listen to somebody over time you want continuous to be true which is what I want and interim results is the funny thing and it's I haven't fully figured out how to get this behavior to work really well but you'll notice when I was demoing it before it would waited until I paused before it gave me what it recognized if I set interim results to true it's gonna try just keep giving me information as I'm speaking so we'll try it with true in a minute but let's leave that as false and these are by the way at the moment the libraries default settings although that could change I suppose if the library API changes okay so this is kind of all the code Redeem easiest coding tutorial video ever we have to see if this works now one thing is again you need to have a browser that supports the web speech API is probably gonna work immediately for me but if you put this on a web page or if you use it in different contexts it's going to ask for your microphone and you probably that also probably means it has to be on a secure website one that's hosted with HTTPS so there's a bunch of like security all sorts of requirements here I'm kind of bypassing that as I know it's just gonna work in the environment that I've set it up at least I hope it's gonna work so now let me hit refresh oh uncaught reference continuous is not defined I cannot spell the word continuous continuous continuous oh wait first of the steak of the p5 library if you guys speech library because before I recorded this video I was messing and I just made a mistake so I'm gonna disappear and come back in a second seriously I corrected it with the wrong I still have a spelling error can't in u.s. I'm back and I fixed that error and one thing you'll notice is now this red light is flashing up here this is something that Chrome will do to let you know that it is listening that the microphone is on so the microphone is on and let's say I've been talking for a little while this open let me just pause it's very hard for me to stop speaking sometimes but I'm going to stop right now so this thing appeared here in the console what appeared in the console it's this this object there's a whole object there what's in the object let's look at it it's got a confidence score this is really good how sure is it that it figured out what you were saying accurately so 92 percent confidence that's good the highest would be 100% it's got success it's the success which is like did it work that could be true or false and it's got the text there also is this object called data which has lots of other information timestamp and all sorts of stuff that's coming from the browser but the the things that you really want or did it work what did I say and how confident are you and I got another one so let's let's do something right now let's just say create P speech dot txt so I just want to make a new paragraph element on the page with whatever and and if I want to be really sure about this I'm going to say if speech dot success so make sure that's true create P with speech text and now I'm gonna refresh the page hello unicorn nangou reindeers are better than people why don't that song in my head oh my goodness did you think that learning oh that's the old Sun I can't anyway the point is I think this is working I lost I got lost in my own thoughts and I'm like the computers talking to me I stopped working oh yeah so maybe it just didn't have success a couple times so you get the idea interesting interesting okay we're in good shape here you know what actually is happening when I look this way I think I'm kind of quieter than when looking at anybody okay let's try this was one more thing we refresh the page let's see what happens when we set interim results to true and see what happens just let's just see I am now attempting to get interim results oh it wasn't autoscrolling so you can see now I'm making a new paragraph and so this is like it's continuously giving me more and more depth so this would be interesting like as it's like trying to interpret it whoa this is crazy so this is interesting to try you can see what that's not like losing my mind here it's the paragraphs aren't scrolling automatically and I am all working no play make Kody train dull it's behind so I'm gonna stop here so you can see this is the basic idea now you could probably do something much more creative with this in terms of how this fits into an interaction scenario but the core basic ideas are start listening and whenever it's recognized something you've got data back you've got confidence you've got the text and whether it worked and some more stuff too and how you display that information back to the user is your choice so I'm gonna do a coding challenge where I make a chat bot that listens to what I say and then replies with listen to what I say was speechtotext and replies with texttospeech and that will be in the next video in this playlist if you're in the program with text playlist see you soon paper clips why couldn't I remember that all right I don't know if I really have time to do this do you think I could do this coding challenge well I'm at 300 let's let's work on the paper clips for a little more I could definitely get some more Auto Clippers here and I have so much unsold inventory and you lower the price 42 how much trust do I have 18 all right all right oh I can start in a minute Beall start investing all right by the way it is just kind of nice to make these artisanal paper clips by clicking the button I saw that joke from somebody else okay do I have its 540 the American League Championship Series game does not start until 8 p.m. I would like to have dinner with my children do you need to get going I'm looking what's with the Capitals that's an interesting question yeah okay I miss dot text so before I move on I by the way I borrowed that our T's an old payperclick joke from somebody else on Twitter who made it that wasn't my joke but it was a good one so I had to borrow it oh boy I mean you gotta raise the price I need more Auto Clippers oh no I definitely need this 500 oh now now now we're cooking I just like I really I just want a big box of actual real paper clips right do the coding challenge then I turn Oh Austin lost it that's a good point all right I'm never going to do this coding challenge so the question is kept me just can you do a video on using speechtotext to do activities like your computer like play music Oh could I control the computer well this would be this is something you certainly could do but I'm limited to controlling the browser because I'm just living in JavaScript in the web page and the browser is not typically allowed to reach outside of it you know it's not like I could make a web page that I could suddenly delete files off of somebody's hard drive that would be a big security issue and in fact that's why you have to give permission to use the microphone or the camera that sort of thing so how am i doing balance wise here I need to raise the price a little bit I just need more Auto Clippers they're so expensive but now looks like my inventory is kind of balanced I do cobain ambrose says why does it Dan upload the live streams after I do so immediately after this is over the live stream is available it's often becomes an unlit by default it becomes an unlisted video so you might have to tweet at me or ask in the chat for the link and then once once I've had a chance with Matt Matt's help who helps me manage the channel to add time codes and description and a thumbnail make sure it's all kind of like set and there wasn't like a private email address in it by accident or something then I'll release it and make it public and that usually happens sometime over the weekend my phone is okay hold on I definitely want the trading engine ooh okay hold on we want some highrisk investments let's deposit some money just posit all our money and let's start investing okay my inventory is kind of going up our buyers on all right all right little let the investments go we're gonna come back to this so I think what I'm gonna do I mean I could just do the number so I just do the number guessing chatbot and just build that that will be easier because then I don't have to like design a knockknock joke and this thing is still running I'm gonna turn this off so the let me let me at least start I think I should at least start from this chat bot code whoops that'll make things because I the previous let me just open up the previous coding challenge oops what am i doing oh my god chat bot I made everything so huge oh you know what this gives me a chance to fix something that I messed up in the previous video so this was the this was the previous chat bot where then I would say five and let's say pick a higher number seven I got it so in a way I kind of want to just use this have I been here for three hours 345 no two hours right I've been here for about exciting start though I started at 300 315 two and a half hours it I just you know if you if you want if you want to assign the blame did I mention its Frank Lance Frank Lance let's think that first of all he loves Frank Lance who is Frank Lance you might be wondering speaking of Frank Lance is the director of the NYU game center runs the MFA program he is a game designer he made the perfect game to torture I pretty sure he made it to torture me specifically I mean in some ways my life has all this meaning now because at some point I will get to the end right I will have made all the paper clips that anyone could ever have made and then I will discover the true meaning of everything that is to be in life right right Frank Frank are you here all right how do you guys feel about me I think what I want to do is I just sort of think that knockknock joke is maybe a little bit better of a chatbot so but I could do that so let me do that let me change the knockknock joke I just want to remember because that's gonna be easy to change and then have it speak okay this is the last thing I'm gonna do today for sure besides read some random numbers this is the knockknock one so if I look at this like the knockknock chatbot Chapa is pretty it's pretty simple okay all right so now close all this out Oh Eric Eric in the chat hi Eric is telling me that thick payperclick game never ends the universe resets actually true mates think like let's do the Wrath of Khan oh I'm getting a little dizzy give me a little dizzy everything's okay all right ready everybody we need we need to we need some warm up here pull the muscle of my dad all right let's do this this last exciting chat bot the music's messed up I'm not worried about it the sound is broken but hold on probably because but this is still working and can you still hear the speechtotext thing texttospeech yeah I messed it up because I change the volume for this but I can fix that back later okay I wonder why that is I really shouldn't worry about that right now you guys are getting to me here oh maybe it's the loopback audio that I want to use all right I'm gonna not I'm gonna not worry about that mouse over this stream okay how's the paper coop don't ask me how the paper clips are coming along that's a very bad idea I'm gonna be I want to get home by 700 so let's do this coding challenge let me fix this a little bit okay oh the Texas speech sounds bad so I messed something up so we have to fix this it looks like stuttering hmm tell me if it I know that's right I'm checking them kind of let me unplug and plug some wire stuff in oh I hear it crackling did it fix shoot let me see here there's a couple other places I can try to check not fixed okay thank you guys for letting me know let's see I unplugged and plugged a bunch of things back in let me do that one more time oh wait a sec I'm so silly that I can actually I'm waiting for you guys to tell me if it's fixed and I forgot that I have a monitor here I think it's okay now I'm hearing it fine so when I was listening to these headphones you guys heard it clipping and stuttering that's weird cuz it's fine for me in the monitor so where could that mean it's having a problem yeah I'm trying to think I guess I could stop I'm gonna hit stop streaming and start streaming again instantly I think it won't split this up into two separate streams I'm sorry everybody I know this is so the right physical issue but what this is in theory no you understand that the what I'm listening to here is the final audio before it goes to stream so something is happening this is not like this is not connected to my laptop this is connected to the live streaming computer and this is the monitoring that output so like I can hear myself talking if I put these on hello hello and I hear no issues so so yeah but my voice is fine too isn't that weird that's very weird but I've unplugged and plugged everything in that would the only thing I can think of as restarting OBS you know what but wasn't doing it before well I'm gonna try stopping and starting streaming real quick okay I'm gonna try that ready here we go one two three all right I should be back let's see if this is the music bad two or just my laptop turn the interim thing off what's the interim thing am i back can you guys see me huh is the music bad so now you can't hear anything oh it's working now it's fine okay are we good was the was the speechtotext fine yeah Oh still bad what but the music is fine why was it fix I did every say was fixed for a second hold on I think it's this cable hmm all right oh I hate having these technical problems hold on I need it I think this cable is bad whoa something just happened different mic picked it up alright okay [Laughter] ignore it play through the air into the mic that I could do still that okay so definitely if I'm gonna do this I need to just out of curiosity I'm plugging the output to YouTube button I did that fix the music by any chance I'm probably just gonna do it emergency Chrome extensions yeah no okay so I'm gonna basically unplug this turn this all the way up how's that yeah so now it's just coming out of my laptop speakers and being picked up by this mic which if that's good enough then accept the ball then that that's what I'm gonna do hmm all right well I lost all my momentum and energy I'm at 1 million paperclips though I kind of want to restart everything and make it work but I'm no I can't play the music now I mean the music is completely is nonexistent it's plugged into something that mean it's just coming out of like random speakers now okay let's do this oh my god I plant them computing now oh my all my stocks are doing terribly got a lot of unsold inventory lower the pricier I'm sort of get some high risk money going okay I need photonic chips okay all right shall we do this just get everything oh I completely forgot I was lying all right here's the thing should I just go I think I'm gonna go ahead and do this the computer I feel a little sad that the audio is gonna be a little like not great but I think we're just gonna have to live with it and I'm gonna do this okay it's a little quiet oops so I don't know how to make it I'm gonna do the bots don't worry yet I'm trying to just think if there's a like if I just I think it came let me just try one more thing which is to oh wait a second oh because I turned off the laptop audio well weird hold on a second just just bear with me for a second why does the oh oh because I put it on internal speakers okay okay so I have one more thing I can try if I might as well try this one last thing which is that I have a duplicate cable I just want to know if it's the cable so if you don't mind I'm going to very quickly swap cables it's probably a different cable because this one I kept unplugging and plugging in but let me just give this one last try and then okay this is now gonna go out through the HDMI again how's that i awkward dev for hiding the 13 yeah sounds bad okay nevermind it's something else I don't know where it's happening but it's not this cable I mean I could try swapping a different cable there's so many things I could try swapping now but I'm gonna have to just forget it okay thank you for that was one last thing I could try I could probably restart the computer but I prefer not to do that alright I should turn off the paper it's gotta be that it's got to be the paper clips it's gotta be frank Lance how am I doing here oh I really need to I need to get this marketing going this is ridiculous hold on everybody I know I'm distracted to there we go fifty dollars per second that's good all right I'm gonna let that go and here we go really lost my mind here six o'clock all right here we go hi I'm gonna do one more a chatbot I'm kind of gonna do the exact same chatbot I just did maybe I'll change it from a number guessing thing to a knockknock joke thing just to change it but instead of me typing guess the number between 1 and 10 ok let's try 7 pick a higher number let's try 9 the lower number let's try hate I got it instead of typing I want to interact with this chat bot through voice so it just recorded 2 tutorials about the p5 speech library 1 tutorial looks at texttospeech so having the browser speak with a voice and another tutorial looks at speech to text listening to what I'm saying and and turning that into text so let's first so let me first cup two things let me deal with this chat bond a little bit let me first say one thing that I got wrong in the previous coding challenge video that I that I should as I as I created this like elaborate system if you recall to say to the chat bot set a number and then set the variable to whatever so I had to like secretly talk to the chat bot there's actually a set var method that's part of the rive script JavaScript library so I didn't have to use that convoluted methodology if you don't know I'm talking about you didn't watch the previous coding challenge you can go back and watch it and this will make sense but this was an unnecessary step thank you for internet for correcting me and helping me with that but I'm actually going to just kind of get rid of this brain and I'm gonna start over I'm gonna do a sub I'm gonna I want to make sure cuz uh with a knockknock joke you might say who is there or who's there knockknock no but that's the box saying that anyway so I don't need this sub what I'm gonna do is do I'm going to have a catchall which is anything the user says I'm going to say try saying knockknock and then optionally if the user says anything we the phrase knockknock in it so this is like a channel wildcard I wonder if I need that optional around there then I'm gonna then the bot is going to say who who's there okay so let's just try this and this is one of the examples from the rive script website so I can say anything I want and it's gonna say try saying knockknock and then I could just add knockknock and it's gonna say who's there or I could say knockknock and it could say who's there now here's the thing now what I want to do is say well whatever they say in response to who's there the bot should say star one who and then at the end the bot should say haha so this is the sequence knock knock who's there Frank Frank who Frank Lance ha ha ha Franklin's making a weird nonsensical appearance in this video tutorial for no good reason but that's besides the point so here's the thing though VI can't have all these stars what I need is something to help me sequence and I'm kind of forgetting what the what the command is for sequencing but I'm gonna remember in a second because there's gonna be about to be an edit point we're gonna look it up now I'll just look it up with with you and watching me do this so I have an example that already does this I was trying to do it from scratch and here it is so ah the percent the percent means if the last thing was who is there then I say whatever who if the previous thing was whatever who then I can say haha that is so funny so I need to add this in to here right think about this this is saying this is a catchall but only if the previous thing that the bot said was who is there ah but the bot says who's there this is why I want to have this substitution I knew there was a reason this substitution who's and who is our equivalent so whatever kind of mechanics is working have them be equivalent and then I also want by the way I don't usually do this in a coding challenge just like a copypaste from an example but that's what I'm doing the point of this was to add the speech thing so I guess I could cut me some slack here so then at the end if the last thing was star who now let's see the order might matter let's see if the or let's see if this works I put these in a different order than in the example but let's see if this works so let's go back to the bots and I'm gonna just type in some nonsense so say try saying knockknock so I'm gonna say knockknock say who's there coding coding who coding train yay okay so we have a working knockknock joke chat bot thing because by the way if I were to say now coding train it's good as they try saying knockknock right because it only laughed because it was part of the sequence but the whole point of this video however long I am in is now to 10,000 steps so I walk back and forth what it's really good to do a like live YouTube channel with a Fitbit on okay I wanted to speak so how do we do that so I need to import download and import the p5 speech library so if you want to know how to do that I cover that in my tutorials about the p5 speech library right now I'm just gonna have a moment where I disappear and reappear with the library downloaded so let me just grab the library because actually you know what I should no no let me not do that I I need the p5.js library so how do I get that I think the piece I need the p5.js speech library the v5 speech library how do I get that so I have that open here this github repository if I just go into here Lib and I see this particular file p5 speech Jas this is the file I need to download and include it as part of my project so I'm not going to go through the steps to download it right now it's already there it's not already there but I'm gonna have an edit point and now and now I'm gonna go chat no speech rec library p5 speech chat bot to libraries p5 speech ok I'm back and you can see that I've now added p5 speech Jas to my folder with libraries in it and actually with the thing that I didn't do is I need to go into o index dot HTML and also add a reference to that P v dot speech jeaious library ok now I have this p5 speech library now what I want to do is I'm going to say let speech equals new p v dot speech and do i need an argument there i can't remember but i think no if i wanted to set a voice you know i'm just gonna use the default voice voice speech dot speak hello so let's just see if this works so unfortunately my sound system isn't working so great so you're hearing it out of the computer speakers and in through my mic hopefully you can hear it ok but you can see this is as simple as just creating a speech object and saying it's speak hello my other video I go through how to pick a different voice how to change the rate and pitch but I just want to use the default voice and now instead of wherever it says sticks the out put it in HTML thing I'm gonna say speech dot speak reply okay here we go so I'm going to type in some nonsense all right now I'm gonna say knockknock coding coding rainbow okay so we get the idea we get the idea this works now I kind of want to remove the text there the point was this but now what I need I need four instead of me typing in the stuff I want to now be able to say it oh this is gonna be fast so now what I need can I do this in the same sketch is I need a speech recognition object which I must say new p5 speech speech rec okay and I need to give it a callback got speech so this is the tricky thing the callback is for when asked equivalent of when I hit the submit button so whatever I did in that submit button that's the callback when I hit submit I want to just process what I said well I think this is gonna work am I making I might not be making any sense but I need I need to add this I need to add a function called got speech speech so I just want to make sure this works and I'm gonna just say console.log so this I go through this in more detail in that other tutorial video but basically this speech object comes with a property called text so and I forgot that I need to say I need to explicitly tell the speech recording object to start and there's some things I can configure in the start function I'm gonna use the default settings all right so let's just see if this works now so you can see that it's listening to me but if I've done this before so normally we would have pop up with like can I use your microphone thing you might see that and you can see that I'm getting the text that I'm saying here knockknock great alright so this is working so now what I need to do is I need to change it from basically the user input is no longer what's coming in from that text box but instead it's what's coming in from speech text so it needs to reply to speech dot text and I'm gonna do something really ridiculous which is I'm gonna say input user input dot value speech tech so I'm gonna put what I'm saying also on the screen just for debugging purposes I'm gonna remove all that before I finish so let's let's go knock knock okay got an error speech dot speak is not a function ah what's happened here these callbacks maybe live somewhere else oh look at this I name the same variable too why I called this speech I should call this or some camera stuff I don't know we wrote a speech let's just call this speech speech data oh I I need better variable names somebody will think of better variable names and I'm gonna say let let input equals speech data text and then I'm just going to use input here input input and input all right let's see if this works hello knock knock Daniel Daniel sheath Mon wow that was exciting it worked could you hear it could you hear it so this is great I think I'm done oh let's let's just remove let's remove everything from the HTML page just for the the sake of argument so I'm gonna just comment all this stuff out I'm gonna go into my code and I don't want any Dom elements I don't need talking to me I don't want to use this Dom element I don't want to use this Dom element and I don't need this function alright so I just commented out all the stuff that was for the HTML stuff hello bot knockknock coding train coding train coding challenged completed yeah alright I don't know that was up let me try it one more time oh well let me do a different demonstration with a I need a real knockknock joke oh I got one I got one I got one Matthew edit that out this will be the real one use hello bot knockknock the interrupting cow Moo well it doesn't work can I interrupt it it oh let's try another one knock knock knock knock okay am i back you can't see the computer can you see me can you hear me I'm sort of hoping I wonder if that fixed by the way I had to restart the computer so I sort of wanted to see if the audio problem got fixed if you don't mind so let me see if that fixed the audio problem I'm just curious so if I go back to the sound settings and do multi output device hello charging knock knock who's there alright did that fix the the audio thing I mean it's you're gonna hear twice because I turned it up so it's coming through my micro yeah it does great well let me just go redo the whole video again all right let me turn it down I can't oh so frustrating should restart I would have restarted the computer if I knew it was gonna crash in the first place and I think by the way unfortunately when it crashes I think that corrupted the whole recording to disk so I think of course me to edit these challenge we're gonna have to like suck down the livestream archive off of YouTube anyway if anybody knows how you could because I the data is there like I know right now let me look let me just if that happened because I can ask there is yeah there is a whoa oh my goodness a huge file here that I can get rid of there is a 7.5 gig video file which was the whole livestream archive which won't open because it's not closed properly there must be a way the data's got to all be there there must be a way to like just fix a it's like a dot mp4 file if anybody knows how to do that let me know because we had this problem before if I am writing to mp4 yes so Alka maybe I need to write to something some other like they can't deal with this right now but maybe I need to change the settings another time alright let's let's finish this out by gonna break it again I hope not alright knockknock knock knock who's there wait Larry hold on hello bot try saying knock knock knock knock who's there the interrupting cow the interrupting cow moo moo moo it doesn't like the interrupting okay knock knock knock knock just knock knock who's there orange orange home orange you glad I didn't say Paperclip oh so this is the end of this code challenge this is a chatbot voice conversational interface thing that runs in the browser with rive script and p5 the p5 speech library I hope you enjoyed watching me make this I hope that you make something fun and interesting that's different and please share it with me this is a little trickier to share especially if it's a rather than just like oh it's an interesting like rainbow particle system but figure out a way to share it with me share a link in the comments or tweet me at Schiffman and i will see you in a future video goodbye try seeing knockknock oh really good bye good bye I think that should get edited right like the video should end right after the computer says try saying knockknock alright everybody it's me I am sue me is telling me it's fairly simple to chunk it to the last total frame or whatever so I could use some help with that I'm gonna upload these files to Google Drive alright everybody I don't have my music thing plugged in but you probably hear it that way so let me work okay okay paper clips 625 I I get 1 minute and 30 seconds to the end of this song whatever the paper clip value is I'm gonna do a screenshot at the end of this song whatever that number is it's the number but I get some time here what can I do really quickly mega Clippers oh my god be some mega Clippers quickly just as many as I can get raise the price well it's going down no lower the price lower the price I want more money deposit some money highrisk stocks ooh let's let's run some tournament what else can I get I don't have any quantum computing yet do I can get some more of these things all right make some extra ones all right this is this is how far we're gonna have gotten by the way everybody let me see if wait I'm not looking at the YouTube chat I'm not by the way Thank You Alka for that remind me you're so I'm not I forgot when I when I went to restart the computer I didn't load up the YouTube chat let me see if I can look at it real quick on this computer here Dan when will you be back with a neural network series I hope to be able to announce some stuff about that soon and it will be towards the end of this year or early 2018 until you know the reality of my the way that I do this channel is that I'm trying to support the courses that I'm teaching and so that content doesn't you know I wish I had done it over the summer I wanted to but that content just doesn't fit till later Oh next week I next week I will be in Boston for processing day there will be no live stream next Friday so the next live stream will be unless I can find a time in between now two weeks from today that that live session will be recorded so hopefully that'll be another video so there are two chats I'm using a crowdfunding site called patreon patreon.com slash coding train and so for people who are members or patrons of the channel through that there's a pipe there's a private slack channel that you'll get an invite to wait hold on what ah wait why is my oh there we go zero all right no thank you so this is the final number this is the final number I should be on the desktop where do the screenshots go hmm yep here it is this is the final number for the live stream by the way if I had just focused only on the paper clips I would have gotten way way way past this is the final number three million fiftyfive thousand seven hundred fifty one the rules are just to remind you your tweet with the hashtag paper clip train had to be a timestamp 330 p.m. Eastern Time and your number the difference between your number and this number the absolute value of that has to be the smallest of everybody and if you did multiple guesses your last one in a valid timestamp is the one that will count so I will look through and try to find the winner but if anybody feels like looking through the hash tag with this number and helping me find the winner and like doing some kind of like certified authentication I will then direct message you and get your address anywhere in the world I will send a coding train tshirt so so that's the that's that there's 400 people watching right now which is kind of insane this has been going on for three hours and 23 minutes which is the good sign it leads me to believe the interface is leading me to believe oh I that I'm completely brain dead right now I'm gonna go which is it leads me to believe that the hashtag is particle known paperclip train I believe let's check it a Twitter comm hashtag paperclip train so we can just sort of scan over this to see this is pretty good noah van boven is looking pretty good this is the end of the game right all right so I'll look through this later thank you guys for watching I hope this was a helpful session I hope to have more sleep before the next time I will see you two weeks from now thank you for joining the coding train I'm gonna check the slack channel to make sure I didn't miss anything thirteen million is maybe the closest me I am Samia there's a 1 million yeah 1 million is gonna be closer so c'est la vie okay so
