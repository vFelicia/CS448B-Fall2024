00:02 - Hi! So I am here and
I am making a video.
00:05 - And what I would like to try to do
00:07 - in this video is demonstrate
uploading a p5 sketch
00:12 - from your laptop to a server
00:15 - so that other people can go
to their own web browsers,
00:18 - type in some URL, 
and see the marvellous,
00:20 - wonderful work that you have done!
00:23 - So, before I go to the computer 
and demonstrate steps
00:25 - what I would like to do is discuss
00:27 - all the different pieces at play here
00:29 - it is actually kind of a simple 
thing in a way,
00:31 - I'm probably overcomplacting it, 
but let's give this a try
00:34 - you could just shut this off,
or speed ahead like 5 minutes
00:36 - if you just want to get to the guts here.
00:40 - Ok, So ... what's happening,
00:41 - you are working on a laptop
and you have the p5 IDE
00:48 - You are working in the P5 IDE, which 
if you zoom in on that,
00:54 - you are writing some code
and that code is JavaScript
00:57 - You are writing code in Javascript
01:00 - uh, there is a play button,
somewhere in that IDE
01:04 - and you hit play, when you hit play
you see another window opens up,
01:10 - that window is actually a browser window,
and you see the result of your code
01:16 - whatever you've written in you code,
"draw circle", "draw rectangle",
01:18 - all that stuff, it's there in this browser.
01:21 - So all of this is just happening locally
on you laptop.
01:24 - Here is the thing that you might not
consider, or have thought of
01:30 - This.. in that step when you hit play,
what happens ?
01:34 - "Launch a server"
01:38 - There is actually a server that's running,
on your machine, your laptop
01:41 - (I don't know why I'm assuming
you are using a laptop
01:43 - ... that's what I'm using these days, so, 
maybe you are too)
01:46 - That server is launch behind the scenes
which serves up your sketch
01:51 - and allows this browser window to see it.
01:54 - And so, what we want to do is
we want to find another server,
01:58 - one that's not sitting in you laptop
ans that is actually out in the Internet
02:04 - ( you know "the cloud"... 
I think I saw this in a video...
02:08 - there is no "clouds", underground
bunkers somewhere )
02:11 - but a server somewhere, that other people
could connect to
02:19 - uh...lots of other laptops,
they could connect to through some URL
02:25 - and they could see you beautiful 
circles and squares
02:28 - on their screen !
02:30 - Because, you don't really... It's not
really realistic at this point
02:33 - for your laptop, for this little server
to suddenly serve up to the world
02:37 - and then everybody connect to you
02:39 - ( also... you know, this is possible
but that's another story for another day)
02:43 - So what you need to do is take
this code and put it on that server
02:48 - and figure out what that URL is
02:51 - and then everyone else, will be able
to see you beautiful circles and squares
02:56 - that you spent so
much time thinking about
02:59 - where to put them ?
what colours they should be ?
03:01 - and purple and blue, I don't know, 
colours of the rainbow
03:04 - it's a nice thing to think about!
03:07 - Ahh, so !
03:08 - So this is the steps that we want to do.
03:11 - Now, here is another piece,
03:13 - you are writing, we said,
JavaScript code here
03:17 - so you think all we need to do is take my
JavaScript code
03:20 - and put that on the server
03:22 - but what's happening in the P5 IDE is
in addition to the Javascript code
03:26 - which might be called, a file, like 
"sketch.js",
03:30 - that's where your code is sitting,
03:32 - behind the scene
and in some other video
03:36 - ( or somebody else will talk to you,
I don't know when
03:39 - but I am not going into this to much
right now )
03:41 - and this moment, there is 
another file called "index.html"
03:47 - and when these requests are made
this is really the file,
03:51 - this is the core file, that gets sent back
from the server
03:54 - that gets loaded into the browser
03:56 - and this file refers to
to you JavaScript code
03:59 - so, in turn, your JavaScript code 
is seen in the browser.
04:03 - But, so these are the 2 files,
and there's other files...
04:06 - later you might have, you know
images, and sound files
04:09 - and there is something called CSS, which
adds some styling and layout
04:12 - and different things,
04:14 - but ultimately, you need at least
these 2 files
04:17 - HHHhhhhhh ! !
04:19 - I forgot something...
04:20 - You need this 2 files and you
need to send them to the server.
04:23 - OK, what did I forget ?
04:25 - There is also going to be a folder
called "Lib"
04:28 - and that folder called "Lib"
is going to have other things in it
04:32 - like a file called "p5.js"
04:34 - that's the P5 library
04:36 - You know there is a longer story here of
"ok, well, you don't actually have to have
04:41 - the P5 library here, you could
refer to it somewhere else"
04:43 - but for the sake of today,
just so we can get through this video,
04:47 - the way that... and this is how
the IDE works
04:50 - so it makes the most sense 
to just look at it this way.
04:52 - You project is your code,
04:55 - it's this html file which refers to your code
04:58 - and then, also, the P5 library which 
allows you to write all this functions
05:02 - like rect(), ellipse(), fill(), stroke()...
05:04 - that sort of thing in your code
05:06 - and also, by the way, the index.html file
that is going to refer to that file too
05:11 - so you got to get all these things
up onto the server.
05:14 - Then you got to know, you know, 
what's you URL ?
05:17 - Well, presumably, you have a host
you've registered for an account
05:20 - with some company and they have 
given you lots of information
05:22 - and, you know, uhhh... what your URL is
05:26 - it's, you know, "blabla.com" and depending
on if you make this into a directory,
05:33 - then it's going to be /something/something
05:35 - ...well I guess when I show you 
on the computer
05:37 - ( if you're still watching...)
05:39 - uhhh, this will become more... but ah !
05:42 - How do you get this stuff to the server ?
05:45 - There is lots of ways to do that.
05:47 - All sort of interesting strange ways,
05:49 - I have a personal favorite
I'm using this way called "GitHub pages"
05:51 - but I'm not going to do that in this video
05:53 - and I probably shouldn't have mentioned that
05:55 - (edit that out later ... except I'm not
going to edit that later... because I don't edit these)
05:58 - But , uhh, so , you need to do 
something called "FTP",
06:02 - and this is where I'm very exited to say
that I actually, I think I know what
06:06 - that stands for:
"File Transfer Protocol".
06:09 - Because we want to transfer this files
and we need some protocols
06:11 - for transferring this files
06:14 - and, in fact, most likely, 
what you actually need
06:17 - is "SFTP", it depends on, what kind of
hoster, server or whatever you have
06:22 - "Secure ! File Transfer Protocol" because
06:27 - you don't want anyone to hack in
and see
06:30 - your precious pink and purple, rainbow 
coloured shapes,
06:34 - that you are uploading to the server
06:37 - ... hhhh, ok !
06:38 - Soooo, uhh, so this is the picture of it
06:41 - I went on to long about that
now let's...ah, by the way
06:43 - I haven't tried this yet
06:46 - So, uh, so now we are going to go
over to the computer
06:50 - and actually walk through the steps
and look at how to do this
06:55 - (I'm gonna go over here now
and see if this works)
06:56 - Wooohaaaaa!!
06:58 - Ok, oh! My computer went to sleep!
06:59 - Come back!
Ah, there we go, ok !
07:00 - So, what do you need now ?
07:03 - You need some software,
You need software
07:05 - (hop ! there you are !
you ! I mean, you are a camera
07:09 - I guess you are a person, at some point
but...)
07:12 - You need some software
07:15 - the software that I am using is a 
(let me zoom in on this)
07:18 - called "Cyberduck".
07:20 - This is FTP software
it allows to FTP files but
07:23 - you know, Google "FTP software"
find your personal favourite
07:26 - ask you friends who love to FTP
on the week ends or whatever
07:28 - uuh, but, you might as well look 
at Cyberduck. It's free and uh ...
07:31 - it works!
07:34 - So uh, now, but ok, so 
and I also have the p5 IDE
07:37 - if you don't know where to get the p5 IDE
07:40 - you want to go the the p5 js website
that's p5js.org
07:44 - and you want to go to "Download"
and then you want to scroll down
07:50 - and you want to download the editor
07:52 - the Mac version OR...
the Windows version ! which is
07:55 - really exciting because, like a month ago
that didn't exist
07:58 - so, uuh, so I've already done that
08:01 - so I don't need to do that and
(hello ! ) so I'm just going to launch
08:06 - Cyberduck, and you gonna see here
the thing that I need to do is
08:09 - I would like to "Open a Connection" to my server
08:13 - ( Ahhhh! Oh I don't know I made that full screen
I don't want to do that
08:15 - view, ooohh, shit, get out of that
here we go)
08:22 - uh, "Open a Connection" and
now there is some information here
08:28 - first thing I want to do is
I want to change this to SFTP
08:31 - and wouldn't it be nice if I knew
(oh... sorry) the server address -laugh-
08:35 - this is something you are going
to have to know !
08:37 - (I should, like, just pause this video, but I...
there is nothing I can you, I had this set before)
08:43 - "shiffman."... (oh shout) ..."imnyuad.com
(it, like, what's the chance that that's right)
08:54 - "dshiffman" and then my password
very secret (and I can't say what it is)
08:59 - (what's the chance that this works ?
Ah! Ah, I'm a genius ! Ok guys
09:05 - I'm really lucky.)
So, I'm sorry about that, I still can
09:08 - remember that, that's cool.
09:10 - Ok, so, this is my URL.
This is a bit of a strange URL
09:13 - most likely, you are going to have
something... (ramble)
09:25 - you most likely have something, like,
you know, uh...
09:30 - funkyswesite.com
or whatever your URL is
09:33 - So your are not gonna have this strange
sub-domain thing
09:36 - but it's up to you
whatever you registered with your host
09:39 - that's what your are going to do
09:41 - and then, your host is going
to have different settups
09:43 - there is, you know, 
a bunch of directories
09:46 - uh, this is the directory of files
09:48 - that actually are publicly viewable
on the web
09:51 - So your server is sitting there
09:53 - and you can have all sort of files
on this server
09:54 - but there is usually a directory
sometimes it's called like
09:57 - "public_html" that usually
a directory that is specified
10:00 - so whatever you put in there
those are the files
10:02 - that you can actually see
by making these requests
10:06 - ( ok, so uh, am I back here ?, I am )
10:11 - So, ok, so we've logged in, that good
and we'll leave that over there
10:14 - I'm going to open up p5
10:17 - I'm going to make a sketch and then say
(oh boy ! I need to just think about
10:21 - making the font bigger ... )
10:23 - I'm going to say
"createCanvas(400, 300);"
10:27 - that's my favourite resolution ...
what's yours?
10:30 - I'm going to say
background(0);
10:35 - I'm going to say:
fill(0, 100, 255);
10:38 - I'm going to say:
ellipse(200,150, 100, 100);
10:43 - that's my favourite kind of ellipse
10:45 - I'm going to hit "save",
that's very important!
10:47 - I'm going to hit "save".
Now where do I save ?
10:50 - Wherever I save this
that's where these files,
10:53 - all these extra files are 
actually going to end up.
10:55 - So, I'm going to save it to the desktop
10:58 - I'm gonna say
I'm gonna call "shiffman_ week1"
11:02 - referring to my name and it's
week 1 of my semester
11:05 - (...)
11:08 - I don't know if anyone is going
to watch this
11:10 - beside the people who are like...
required to
11:13 - (...)
11:16 - but ok, so, I'm gonna hit "save"
11:18 - I didn't even test my code
I should test my code
11:21 - and then I hit "run"
and you can see that it works
11:22 - I have my beautiful circle, it's blue
11:25 - hmm, I don't know it it's my favourite
colour, but it works for today
11:27 - uh, and now I'm gonna save it again
11:30 - and then I'm gonna... look !
look at this directory
11:33 - right here
11:35 - This directory, if I look in
that directory
11:37 - (wow ! where did that go ?)
11:39 - Hmm, now you can see
11:40 - I've got those files I'm talking about
11:42 - I've got "sketch.js" which is my code
11:45 - I've got "index.html" 
which is my html file
11:46 - you can look inside here
and see what's in there
11:49 - make changes to it
if you want to play around
11:51 - uh, and then you can see
11:53 - here are the libraries
11:54 - "p5.js" is the only one
I'm actually using
11:56 - but included are also
11:57 - "p5.sound.js" which allows 
you to play sounds
12:00 - and do all sorts of amazing sound stuff
12:02 - "p5.dom.js" ...
which allows you to do some
12:05 - other interesting things
that have to do with the dom
12:07 - but, you know, I got to stop this video at
some point.
12:10 - So , now, what I'm going to do
12:11 - (and really, I should have just
started here)
12:13 - I'm going to take this whole folder
12:15 - (uh, ok, uuuuh, "edit on the disk"
I don't know, may be if you want to
12:20 - ahh, something weird happened
I don't care)
12:22 - I take this whole folder
12:24 - and I'm going to upload it
12:27 - uhh, and then I going to click "allow"
12:28 - and , if we look
we can see there
12:32 - that folder is in there "shiffman-week1"
12:34 - and there there is some other stuff
12:36 - from , like, some other stuff I did
at one point, a few month ago
12:38 - but now, if you think about it
12:41 - where is my URL ?
12:45 - "shiffman.imnyuad.com" slash
"shiffman_week1"
12:53 - Ok, let's try this
12:56 - (ok tatadaaa) I'm going to go to
"shiffman.imnyuad.com/shiffman_week1"
13:06 - Woohoo !! That worked !
See, look!
13:11 - And now, all you have to do is,
13:13 - I don't know, put this on your Twitter
13:18 - or your Facebook, 
or e-mail it to your friends,
13:21 - honestly just go and update that
GitHub Wiki that is for class
13:25 - and link it to you homework
13:27 - So, uh, this is a thrilling day for me
13:30 - that I recorded this video and that there
is a circle here
13:32 - I doubt this is a all a thrilling day
for you
13:35 - but I will see you again, at some point
13:38 - and another video! 
maybe, maybe not?
13:40 - Uh, I have to stop this now
13:42 - Oh, I don't have a mouse ...
I can't stop it, come on mouse
13:44 - Ok, bye !!

Cleaned transcript:

Hi! So I am here and I am making a video. And what I would like to try to do in this video is demonstrate uploading a p5 sketch from your laptop to a server so that other people can go to their own web browsers, type in some URL, and see the marvellous, wonderful work that you have done! So, before I go to the computer and demonstrate steps what I would like to do is discuss all the different pieces at play here it is actually kind of a simple thing in a way, I'm probably overcomplacting it, but let's give this a try you could just shut this off, or speed ahead like 5 minutes if you just want to get to the guts here. Ok, So ... what's happening, you are working on a laptop and you have the p5 IDE You are working in the P5 IDE, which if you zoom in on that, you are writing some code and that code is JavaScript You are writing code in Javascript uh, there is a play button, somewhere in that IDE and you hit play, when you hit play you see another window opens up, that window is actually a browser window, and you see the result of your code whatever you've written in you code, "draw circle", "draw rectangle", all that stuff, it's there in this browser. So all of this is just happening locally on you laptop. Here is the thing that you might not consider, or have thought of This.. in that step when you hit play, what happens ?

(ramble) you most likely have something, like, you know, uh... funkyswesite.com or whatever your URL is So your are not gonna have this strange subdomain thing but it's up to you whatever you registered with your host that's what your are going to do and then, your host is going to have different settups there is, you know, a bunch of directories uh, this is the directory of files that actually are publicly viewable on the web So your server is sitting there and you can have all sort of files on this server but there is usually a directory sometimes it's called like "public_html" that usually a directory that is specified so whatever you put in there those are the files that you can actually see by making these requests ( ok, so uh, am I back here ?, I am ) So, ok, so we've logged in, that good and we'll leave that over there I'm going to open up p5 I'm going to make a sketch and then say (oh boy ! I need to just think about making the font bigger ... ) I'm going to say "createCanvas(400, 300);" that's my favourite resolution ... what's yours? I'm going to say background(0); I'm going to say fill(0, 100, 255); I'm going to say ellipse(200,150, 100, 100); that's my favourite kind of ellipse I'm going to hit "save", that's very important! I'm going to hit "save". Now where do I save ? Wherever I save this that's where these files, all these extra files are actually going to end up. So, I'm going to save it to the desktop I'm gonna say I'm gonna call "shiffman_ week1" referring to my name and it's week 1 of my semester (...) I don't know if anyone is going to watch this beside the people who are like... required to (...) but ok, so, I'm gonna hit "save" I didn't even test my code I should test my code and then I hit "run" and you can see that it works I have my beautiful circle, it's blue hmm, I don't know it it's my favourite colour, but it works for today uh, and now I'm gonna save it again and then I'm gonna... look ! look at this directory right here This directory, if I look in that directory (wow ! where did that go ?) Hmm, now you can see I've got those files I'm talking about I've got "sketch.js" which is my code I've got "index.html" which is my html file you can look inside here and see what's in there make changes to it if you want to play around uh, and then you can see here are the libraries "p5.js" is the only one I'm actually using but included are also "p5.sound.js" which allows you to play sounds and do all sorts of amazing sound stuff "p5.dom.js" ... which allows you to do some other interesting things that have to do with the dom but, you know, I got to stop this video at some point. So , now, what I'm going to do (and really, I should have just started here) I'm going to take this whole folder (uh, ok, uuuuh, "edit on the disk" I don't know, may be if you want to ahh, something weird happened I don't care) I take this whole folder and I'm going to upload it uhh, and then I going to click "allow" and , if we look we can see there that folder is in there "shiffmanweek1" and there there is some other stuff from , like, some other stuff I did at one point, a few month ago but now, if you think about it where is my URL ? "shiffman.imnyuad.com" slash "shiffman_week1" Ok, let's try this (ok tatadaaa) I'm going to go to "shiffman.imnyuad.com/shiffman_week1" Woohoo !! That worked ! See, look! And now, all you have to do is, I don't know, put this on your Twitter or your Facebook, or email it to your friends, honestly just go and update that GitHub Wiki that is for class and link it to you homework So, uh, this is a thrilling day for me that I recorded this video and that there is a circle here I doubt this is a all a thrilling day for you but I will see you again, at some point and another video! maybe, maybe not? Uh, I have to stop this now Oh, I don't have a mouse ... I can't stop it, come on mouse Ok, bye !!
