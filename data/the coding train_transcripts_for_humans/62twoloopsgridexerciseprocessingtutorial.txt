00:00 - So I'm actually going to come over here, [and] I'm going to
00:04 - Save this and I'm going to do "while"
00:07 - "grid"
00:08 - call this "while grid" and
00:10 - We're we're going to make this very simple
00:13 - We're going to give up a white stroke. Let's make the stroke weight two pixels
00:19 - so they're a little bit easier to see and then we know we want to draw a line from (x , 0) to (x , height)
00:25 - and if we just set x for the moment at 50
00:29 - Let's see where that line is we have our 1 vertical line. So now we were saying okay if I have one vertical line
00:37 - I could do x = x + 50 and draw that line again
00:41 - And now I would have two vertical lines. So why not this is the code that needs to happen over and over again
00:49 - So why not say let's just do that code?
00:52 - Let's just do that code as long as x < width
00:59 - Let's run that,and now we've got that. You can see all of our lines going nicely across the screen and, hey!
01:06 - if we did this with x
01:08 - why not just
01:10 - do it with y and
01:13 - while y < height we want to draw a line from what (0 , y)
01:21 - to
01:22 - (width , y) and increment y
01:27 - by
01:28 - 50 ah what's wrong the field component dot y is not visible? That's what it says down at the bottom oy vey
01:36 - What's happening? I have forgotten. I'm using a variable
01:39 - but I forgot to declare and initialize it so I just [need] to make sure I add my variable y up top and
01:46 - then we come down here, and I'm going to just scroll down so we can see the draw function and run it and
01:53 - What do we see we have x going across y going down? We have our beautiful grid interestingly enough. What is this?
02:01 - There's all these numbers x equals 50 well, let's start x 0 [y] at 0 [why] there's this number 50 here
02:07 - Well that should give us an idea
02:09 - why don't I have a variable called spacing and have that be equal to 50 x equals x plus spacing and
02:17 - Then y equals y plus
02:19 - Spacing this should give us the same result it does but now I have something exciting I can do what if I were to say?
02:26 - spacing
02:26 - equals spacing plus random
02:29 - Negative [to] some random number between negative 2 [and] 2 now we can see the spacing in between the lines
02:35 - Is changing randomly, So I?
02:38 - I
02:39 - Hesitate to offer that this is any sort of interesting or exciting visual effect
02:42 - But it's showing you how we can use a loop to draw many lines across the screen
02:47 - And then we can vary how we're doing that by using random
02:51 - Using the mouse you hopefully will come up with something creative. You could change the colors
