03:07 - so
03:26 - hello i am testing my microphone i'm
03:29 - going to get started in just a few
03:31 - minutes let me come over here and say hi
03:33 - i don't know how the balance is between
03:35 - my
03:36 - mic that i'm wearing here
03:38 - as well as um
03:40 - the music that's playing but the music
03:42 - is going to go off soon
03:43 - this is a new i'm in a new studio that's
03:45 - the same studio just did some
03:47 - renovations in here i streamed on twitch
03:49 - earlier this week so some of you might
03:51 - have caught that
03:52 - if you didn't though this is the first
03:54 - uh youtube stream
03:56 - i've got a little setup here that i'm
03:58 - gonna work on today we'll see how it
04:00 - goes but i'll talk about that in a
04:01 - minute i'm still getting set up let me
04:02 - just come over here
04:07 - oh
04:10 - [Music]
04:21 - do
04:35 - do
04:56 - [Music]
05:01 - all right hello everyone uh welcome
05:04 - to a uh coding train live stream ah
05:07 - where is
05:08 - i have all new equipment and new things
05:10 - oh and i forgot to even turn this light
05:12 - on
05:14 - uh
05:14 - i'm using some new
05:16 - fancy uh
05:18 - echo reduction and noise suppression
05:21 - technology
05:23 - which is hopefully making my audio come
05:25 - in loud and clear to you i see some
05:27 - familiar names in the chat of people
05:29 - that i know either in person or online
05:32 - or through the internet and it's just
05:34 - delightful and wonderful to see all of
05:36 - you it makes me so happy i think this is
05:38 - the button i press
05:40 - to fade out that sound so this is a bit
05:42 - of an unusual stream uh mostly to do
05:44 - with this setup that i have over here
05:47 - which is uh i was saying in the coding
05:49 - train discord earlier that it might turn
05:52 - into a sort of like al capone's vault
05:55 - reveal because i have my childhood
05:57 - computer boxed up in boxes around this
06:00 - room uh 19 i don't actually don't know
06:03 - the exact year probably 1982
06:05 - apple ii plus computer i'm going to
06:07 - attempt to plug all the pieces together
06:10 - and turn it on
06:12 - i have other things i could do if that
06:13 - totally doesn't work but that's my plan
06:16 - for today uh if you are a new viewer uh
06:20 - welcome this is the coding train it is
06:22 - uh what i would like to say is a regular
06:25 - weekly live stream on a youtube thing
06:28 - where there are also uh many different
06:31 - sequenced video tutorials that you could
06:32 - follow along if you've never coded
06:34 - before and would like to learn to code
06:36 - there are also some project videos
06:38 - called coding challenges that are kind
06:40 - of standalone
06:41 - projects that you could follow along and
06:43 - maybe make a creative project be
06:44 - inspired to make a creative project from
06:46 - most of those probably re no i don't say
06:49 - require but uh if you've never coded
06:51 - before you'll want to watch the start
06:53 - learning here i should show you all this
06:54 - because i have a whole computer and
06:56 - everything but anyway i'm just talking
06:58 - how are you all doing
07:00 - how was your friday
07:02 - there was a big storm last night i'm in
07:04 - the hudson valley up uh now i don't know
07:06 - if it really counts as upstate but uh in
07:08 - between new york city and the top of new
07:09 - york state is where i am uh it was a
07:12 - huge storm last night uh trees were
07:16 - flailing and branches were flying the
07:18 - power went off the power went on so i
07:20 - was wondering if the internet and the
07:21 - power would comply today
07:24 - um
07:25 - but it seems like it is i feel like
07:26 - there are important announcements and
07:28 - things i should talk about but i kind of
07:30 - just want to get started
07:33 - um
07:35 - and let me just take i'm just going to
07:36 - take a quick peek at the chat to see if
07:38 - there's any important questions
07:40 - is this the garage yes so i have i'm in
07:44 - a garage
07:45 - it's wonderful to have a space that i
07:47 - i've never had my own space like this
07:49 - before we'll see uh
07:51 - how long it lasts
07:53 - but it's been pretty great
07:55 - um
07:56 - yeah i could talk forever about that but
07:58 - that's where i am i'm going to hopefully
07:59 - do a little bit of a
08:01 - um
08:02 - studio tour kind of video or
08:04 - documentation at some point it's been a
08:05 - while since i've done one of those
08:07 - uh ten print high yeah um
08:12 - uh um let's look at it fasten your seat
08:15 - belt yeah
08:16 - um i uh anand says i fall in love with
08:19 - coding six months ago
08:22 - um
08:23 - it's never too late
08:24 - you know i i mean i didn't start coding
08:27 - well
08:29 - this is good this is appropriate for me
08:30 - to talk about actually so i'm going to
08:32 - come over here
08:33 - uh first of all before i before i start
08:35 - working on the computer i want to show
08:37 - you something i showed this on my twitch
08:39 - stream earlier this week but i have to
08:40 - bring it up again this is uh um
08:44 - a 1964 copy of scientific american uh i
08:48 - did a video coding challenge about this
08:51 - particular prime number pattern often
08:53 - referred to as the prime spiral or the
08:55 - ulam spiral
08:56 - i did not have this magazine but the
08:59 - original when i did the video but i went
09:01 - and ordered it did you know you can
09:02 - order basically any scientific american
09:04 - magazine from the past
09:06 - just just deliver it right to your door
09:08 - i think it was like 20 bucks i mean
09:10 - that's my hard-earned coding train
09:14 - adsense money there this is where it's
09:16 - going to people
09:17 - um
09:18 - i mean it's you know
09:20 - we'll talk
09:21 - yeah so many things to talk about let me
09:23 - find this though because
09:24 - um the article i also want to get the
09:27 - one that martin gardner who is an author
09:29 - uh who wrote many different articles
09:31 - about different mathematical
09:33 - uh things um
09:35 - here is the page uh about the cover and
09:38 - then it's going to say page 122. so i
09:41 - want to find the article i really should
09:42 - have i should get my overhead camera set
09:44 - up so i could show you this more
09:47 - um
09:48 - specifically but here uh with a sort of
09:51 - better actually you know what i think if
09:52 - i come over here
09:54 - strangely enough
09:55 - uh whoops wrong button i think this will
09:58 - actually be a better view
09:59 - of this i'm so look over here and see oh
10:01 - it's way too bright but um you can see
10:04 - um the uh article about mathematical
10:07 - games the remarkable lore of prime
10:09 - numbers i'll just read a little bit of
10:10 - this to you
10:11 - from scientific americans 1964 issue
10:15 - march
10:17 - 60 cents for this thing i mean boy
10:20 - that's appreciated well i think i spent
10:22 - 20 bucks on this
10:23 - uh the remarkable lore of prime numbers
10:25 - by martin gardner no branch of number
10:28 - theory is more saturated with mystery
10:29 - and elegance than the study of prime
10:31 - numbers those exasperating unruly
10:34 - integers that refuse to be divided
10:36 - evenly by any integers except themselves
10:39 - and one
10:40 - some problems concerning primes are so
10:41 - simple that a child could understand
10:43 - them and yet so deep and far from solved
10:45 - that many mathematicians now suspect
10:47 - they have no solution perhaps they're
10:50 - undecidable perhaps number theory like
10:52 - quantum mechanics has its own
10:53 - uncertainty principle that makes it
10:55 - necessary in certain areas to abandon
10:57 - exactness for probabilistic formulations
10:59 - okay i could read this all day the other
11:00 - thing that's really amazing about this
11:02 - are the ads uh let's see i think if i i
11:06 - i
11:07 - clearly this is a new setup for me so i
11:09 - haven't really worked this out
11:10 - but um we can come over here and see
11:12 - let's see ah there we go look at these
11:14 - ads uh the remarkable um digital
11:17 - guidance computers use titan ii and
11:18 - titan three nasa saturn one from ibm
11:21 - here two more from hoffman's complete
11:23 - line
11:24 - of cryogenic equipment did you know that
11:26 - the coding train is sponsored by hoffman
11:28 - laboratories inc
11:29 - the complete line of cryogenic equipment
11:32 - no lost transfer hoses flexible sturdy
11:34 - made of high-strength bronze transfers
11:36 - liquid oxygen nitrogen okay okay you get
11:39 - the idea um all right so i wanted to
11:42 - show that to you um i'm still in the
11:44 - market if anybody can find one on the
11:46 - internet this will cost quite a bit more
11:48 - of my hard-earned uh coding trained
11:50 - funds uh this is a reprint of my
11:52 - favorite book a million random digits
11:54 - with a hundred thousand normal dv it's
11:55 - from the rand corporation anybody out
11:57 - there watching knows where you can i can
11:59 - find an original print please let me
12:00 - know
12:01 - um
12:03 - all right uh hello uh
12:05 - chat folks okay um so let's get this
12:08 - going let's just start because
12:10 - i don't know how this is going to go i
12:11 - don't have a huge amount of time all
12:13 - right
12:15 - so uh somebody in the chat and i've
12:16 - already forgotten had mentioned oh you
12:19 - know i'm just starting to learn to code
12:21 - now
12:22 - is it too late for me or um so first of
12:24 - all i didn't begin
12:25 - uh programming
12:27 - in earnest i would say until i was about
12:30 - 28 or 29 i can't remember the exact date
12:32 - somewhere around there learned to code
12:35 - with
12:36 - macromedia director uh not to be
12:38 - confirmed with uh confused with uh macro
12:40 - data refinement which is another topic
12:42 - we'll see if we get to today
12:44 - uh those of you who know you know
12:46 - um
12:47 - and look at this beautiful rainbow apple
12:50 - by the way can you see that oh
12:54 - i know i'm distracted easily
12:56 - that looks kind of heavy
12:58 - i'm sorry i have the focus but look at
13:00 - that rainbow apple logo come on get get
13:03 - with the program people bring that back
13:05 - um
13:06 - so um i didn't really program until um
13:11 - then and i learned with macro media
13:12 - director i found processing i've sort of
13:14 - talked about this before many a time
13:16 - probably but when i was younger i was
13:19 - into the computer
13:21 - this was actually this computer had my
13:24 - i suppose this button was turned on and
13:26 - off by my probably 10 year old self
13:28 - um my family purchased it i'm guessing i
13:31 - couldn't tell you 1982 would be a good
13:34 - guess i was born in 1973.
13:36 - um
13:38 - and so i did a little bit of basic
13:39 - programming on it in elementary school
13:41 - it wasn't a thing that i spent a lot of
13:42 - time and i sort of did it and then moved
13:44 - on to other things i remember
13:45 - specifically playing a game called
13:48 - monaco gp which i had to load from a
13:51 - tape
13:52 - which i believe there's a box that i
13:54 - have yet to even open so i'm unboxing i
13:57 - my parents i went to visit them i got
13:59 - all the stuff from the attic i brought
14:00 - it here uh just put the monitor here
14:02 - because it's the nicest looking uh piece
14:05 - one of the things that i wanted to show
14:07 - which is really amazing
14:08 - is
14:10 - you know i have some very meticulously
14:12 - organized parents because this is the
14:14 - original box that came in
14:19 - the record of sale
14:21 - like
14:22 - shipping label thing is still encased in
14:25 - the plastic here
14:27 - record of sale
14:28 - award or lease of monochrome monitor
14:31 - as required by federal regulation 21 cfr
14:35 - subchapter j this is model number
14:37 - a3m0039
14:40 - this card must be filled in duplicate by
14:42 - transformer at the time of sale to final
14:44 - consumer
14:46 - so this is this label here it looks like
14:47 - it was shipped to
14:49 - balanced computer and i realized the
14:51 - focus is not i should probably put on
14:53 - the autofocus
14:55 - balance computer corporation balanced
14:57 - computer center 109 beaver court
14:59 - cockeysville maryland that can only
15:01 - assume that's where this was purchased
15:04 - um
15:05 - and this is the original box look at
15:07 - that
15:09 - all right now for some other equipment
15:10 - that's not in the original box
15:13 - let's go actually there is some
15:14 - equipment that is in the original box
15:16 - but i will i will get to that i have to
15:17 - find it okay where is the box with the
15:19 - computer in it don't tell me i've lost
15:21 - it already oh no i found it okay
15:23 - so let's start with this oh and this
15:26 - table
15:27 - i'm a little bit worried that this table
15:29 - is not big enough i have another table
15:30 - over there um but here we go
15:32 - unfortunately i also can't really see
15:34 - the chat right now you know what i'm
15:35 - gonna do
15:37 - i'm gonna bring this um
15:40 - ipad i have here
15:43 - um
15:45 - and
15:47 - all right so let me just let me just
15:49 - address the severance references because
15:50 - i see that shy 100 so first of all
15:52 - please nobody spoil this wonderful
15:54 - television program
15:56 - for other folks but um
15:59 - i've been kind of really just sort of
16:00 - into recently retro technology i've got
16:03 - a whole bunch of other old computers
16:04 - over there i'll show you a fun one that
16:06 - i just bought off of ebay
16:08 - not too long ago um
16:11 - quite a bit more modern than that one
16:12 - this is uh
16:15 - this is i don't know at one point this
16:16 - was a property of auburn university at
16:19 - montgomery but this is a one of those
16:21 - old apple clam shell computers but um
16:24 - uh this the severance tv show which is a
16:27 - show that i've been really enjoying i
16:28 - was on a podcast you can check that out
16:29 - i'll put a link to it and stuff like
16:31 - that about it um
16:34 - it's uh
16:35 - they use all these um older props which
16:38 - i um
16:39 - are i think data general computers i can
16:41 - pull it up on my laptop later to show
16:43 - you um which are dumb terminals um
16:45 - they're not dumb terminals it's kind of
16:47 - i don't i don't love that name for it
16:49 - calling it a dumb terminal but dumb
16:51 - terminals were
16:53 - you know monochrome usually monochrome
16:54 - monitors terminals that didn't have that
16:57 - hooked up to you know before everybody
16:58 - had their own personal computer you had
17:00 - to hook your terminal up to a mainframe
17:02 - so that multiple people could do access
17:04 - that computing power all at once anyway
17:07 - i want to get one of those but all right
17:10 - so uh let's see here um i've got the box
17:13 - here everything is kind of like attached
17:15 - so
17:16 - it's a little bit here's the actual
17:20 - it's falling apart okay
17:22 - you know what um let me just get this
17:24 - other table
17:25 - it's going to make life easier
17:27 - bear with me people
17:28 - um i should have set this up
17:31 - i know you can't see me i have another
17:33 - table here oh you know what i have a
17:34 - folding table let me just grab this
17:36 - folding card table this will be easier
17:39 - there's a toaster let's see
17:43 - this is the very professional uh outfit
17:45 - i'm running here
17:48 - okay
17:50 - all right
17:51 - so
17:52 - it's gonna fit through the door
17:54 - yeah i think so okay
17:56 - all right so i'm bringing another table
17:58 - in here because you need some more room
18:01 - let's put the box on it
18:03 - i will point the camera at it don't you
18:05 - worry
18:12 - oh my god there's a a nickel inside the
18:15 - computer that's not a good sign okay
18:17 - all right so the computer's in here
18:20 - let's try to
18:22 - very very carefully
18:24 - lift it out
18:26 - now it's got a bunch of things attached
18:29 - so i'm going to bring all these things
18:31 - with it
18:32 - this is how it was stored
18:35 - some disk drives
18:37 - and a joystick oh my god
18:43 - okay let's put it over here
18:47 - get rid of the box
18:51 - maybe i'll switch the camera to
18:52 - autofocus and let's put it on this table
18:55 - to the left here so i can have some more
18:58 - space
19:00 - i'm probably going to need a chair
19:04 - and i was meaning to look at the chat
19:06 - which i can kind of see
19:08 - here
19:14 - okay so uh uh i'm gonna come later today
19:17 - if there's time i'm gonna show you this
19:19 - macro data refinement program that i've
19:20 - been using i love working on you can
19:22 - find it on my github
19:24 - if you're looking for a wonderful
19:25 - podcast about the show severance uh
19:28 - check out
19:29 - post show recaps severance podcast uh
19:32 - episode 8 feedback was the one that i
19:34 - was a guest on but
19:36 - um yeah so you can check that out for
19:38 - those who are asking um
19:40 - yeah this joystick is wild right look at
19:42 - this
19:43 - um so let me see here
19:46 - now the next box that i need to get we
19:49 - move these precious things out of the
19:51 - way
19:52 - you can see uh
19:54 - i think the ipad is really ruining the
19:56 - vibe here let me put it back over here
19:59 - um
20:01 - okay
20:02 - now i have another box that i'm gonna
20:04 - get
20:08 - which i have yet to look inside
20:11 - i have no idea what's going to be in
20:12 - here
20:16 - this says first of all i love that this
20:17 - is a
20:19 - washington apples
20:21 - to find the world's finest apples
20:24 - let's do something here so you can see
20:26 - more of what i'm doing i'm going to
20:27 - switch to autofocus
20:30 - which i think will hopefully
20:33 - help things here oops
20:41 - everybody relax i know how to operate
20:44 - this equipment
20:47 - loosen there we go okay there we go this
20:50 - should be good
20:51 - um
20:53 - and now let me do
20:55 - uh
20:58 - continuous autofocus so hopefully
21:03 - that's going to
21:05 - help things okay
21:06 - i believe i'm on no it just says manual
21:09 - focus hold on
21:11 - uh focus mode
21:14 - continuous autofocus there we go
21:17 - okay
21:20 - all right everyone
21:22 - uh let me get this light here
21:24 - a little bit better positioned
21:26 - you can't see me i'm gonna get a chair
21:29 - i don't usually i'm not used to sitting
21:31 - in a chair when i'm streaming
21:33 - i have a little stool maybe i should get
21:35 - the uh this is good this is actually uh
21:37 - uh speaking of it's funny how this chair
21:39 - is for my grandmother
21:41 - bella minnell who is one of the fir
21:43 - first women phd in mathematics you can
21:46 - you can look her up
21:47 - uh bella manel if you uh the nature of
21:49 - code book is dedicated to her
21:51 - um
21:53 - this is kind of fun
21:56 - oh okay great all right so uh next up
21:58 - let's move this to the side
22:00 - let's open this box because i i don't i
22:02 - need to need
22:04 - some power cords and things i'm hoping
22:06 - everything is here
22:08 - okay we're gonna find out what's in the

23:17 - now when i bring things closer to the
23:18 - camera you'll be able to see them better
23:20 - assuming the autofocus works it wants to
23:22 - focus on my face so i think if i put
23:24 - this here all right so we found this

28:37 - like film
28:39 - canister
28:40 - that says screw for epson fx 80. so this
28:44 - is a screw
28:45 - save for the printer that i'm gonna like
28:47 - and kept in this little bag
28:50 - um okay i can go through more of this
28:52 - stuff later i really want to get the
28:53 - thing on
28:55 - but i the the thing that i need is i
28:57 - need the power oh no i have the power
28:59 - for the monitor i need to figure out
29:00 - what the video out is so i have the
29:03 - power for the computer

29:50 - they're like little dials
29:52 - are these little like controllers
29:56 - this is good for macro data refining
29:59 - wouldn't you think they use a trackball
30:01 - in severance which isn't something you
30:02 - would have found with a 1977
30:05 - data general d2 computer uh it would
30:08 - have just had a keyboard interface no
30:10 - mouse no trackball for sure
30:13 - um
30:15 - this looks like
30:16 - odd oh video right
30:18 - this has got to be
30:24 - this has got to be the video go this is
30:26 - right is this a video cable
30:29 - this is a video cable
30:31 - it's an analog video cable this is
30:34 - another power cord
30:37 - but i would assume that this is the
30:39 - power cord that goes with it
30:41 - because it's like a whole big box
30:45 - um
30:48 - game paddles like atari 2600 okay
30:51 - uh accounting for inflation says matthew
30:54 - rice the apple ii was around five
30:56 - thousand dollars in today's dollars okay

31:19 - notes on
31:21 - various things
31:22 - related to the computer
31:24 - um which i would love to go through and
31:26 - sort of like learn everything
31:31 - okay um basic programming reference
31:33 - manual we're gonna need this
31:35 - dos manual
31:37 - we've got the epson users manual the
31:40 - apple soft tutorial the apple ii
31:42 - reference manual okay jackpot everybody
31:46 - jackpot

31:51 - oh it's got a 1200 300 baud intelligent
31:54 - modem they can get video term 80 column
31:56 - display okay there's a lot of things in
31:58 - here
31:59 - but i want to get a move on
32:02 - trying to get this thing
32:04 - hooked up this is another like video
32:06 - possibly video cable
32:09 - okay so let's look at the
32:12 - um
32:15 - uh not the apple so i want the apple ii
32:18 - reference manual there we go okay
32:25 - then we're going to need this the apple
32:26 - ii uh reference manual
32:30 - so uh let's
32:33 - let's look at how uh we turn it on the
32:36 - power supply page two
32:38 - approaching your apple chapter one the
32:40 - power supply
32:43 - okay yep main board all right let's take
32:45 - a look here
32:49 - can you see the beauty that's inside
32:51 - this thing
32:53 - main board
32:55 - power supply
32:57 - speaker there is no this oh yeah there's
32:59 - the speaker
33:00 - um so apologies um
33:03 - uh you know i could set up i do have
33:06 - like an overhead camera but
33:08 - let's just see how far i can get just
33:10 - with what the setup i have
33:12 - um
33:13 - the metal box on the left side of the
33:14 - interior is the power supply it supplies
33:16 - four voltages 5 volts negative 5.2 v
33:19 - plus a
33:20 - high frequency okay
33:21 - a photo to the back of okay
33:26 - keyboard talking to your apple your link
33:29 - to your apple is at your fingertips
33:31 - most programs and languages that are
33:33 - used with the apple expect you to talk
33:35 - to them through the apple's keyboard
33:38 - hello
33:39 - hello
33:41 - are you there
33:44 - it looks like a normal typewriter
33:45 - keyboard except for some minor
33:46 - rearrangement and a few special keys
33:49 - for a quick review of the keyboard see
33:51 - pages 6 through 12 in the apple ii basic
33:53 - programming manual
33:54 - since you're talking with your fingers
33:56 - you might as well be hearing with your
33:57 - eyes the apple will tell you what it is
33:59 - doing by displaying letters numbers
34:02 - symbols and sometimes colored blocks and
34:05 - lines on a black and white or color
34:08 - television set
34:10 - but i've got
34:11 - a monitor here
34:13 - let's all right
34:14 - i'm going to unplug these disk drives
34:16 - which are really kind of in my way i
34:18 - think
34:20 - which i believe
34:22 - i can just take these what is this no
34:24 - um so i have these two disk drives
34:29 - drive one drive two
34:32 - um
34:34 - let's leave them plugged in what is
34:36 - going on over here okay
34:37 - let's move stuff i don't need out of the
34:39 - way
34:51 - this joystick is this joystick actually
34:53 - attached right now
34:55 - is that i certainly don't need and that
34:56 - could be a little extra space for me
34:58 - what is this
35:00 - ah this is the video out
35:05 - why is it like this this worries me
35:08 - but i'm assuming this is video out
35:12 - but it is oh but there also is there why
35:15 - is this just loose
35:17 - well
35:18 - okay
35:19 - so we're gonna start by um
35:25 - put the
35:27 - chat on the floor sorry chat you're on
35:29 - the floor now
35:31 - i'm going to start by
35:33 - let's try to clean this up what is this
35:35 - attached to
35:39 - let's clean all these i'm cleaning all
35:41 - these cables up so that it's not so
35:43 - messy
35:45 - these are quite tangled let's see this
35:47 - is these are extra things
35:50 - move these ah look at this
35:52 - this must be the video out okay
35:56 - why what's this cable
35:59 - this is
36:00 - oh my goodness modem found the modem
36:03 - let's unplug that little telephone cord
36:05 - it's all tied up
36:08 - so i'm just trying to unplug some things
36:10 - i know i don't need right now like
36:12 - i don't think i don't have a landline
36:14 - phone so
36:16 - there's not really a way i can make use
36:18 - of that
36:21 - okay
36:25 - um
36:28 - all right
36:30 - phone cord
36:32 - do not need
36:34 - put this off to the side
36:36 - this drive number one
36:41 - this drive number two i don't like the
36:42 - way these cables are tangled
36:45 - i think this is better now let's try to
36:47 - find where
36:49 - untangle this joystick
36:55 - uh okay
36:57 - untangle this joystick
37:00 - yes i can leave it plugged in
37:02 - no harm no foul the joystick is plugged
37:05 - in i could undo it
37:07 - i just want to understand why there's
37:09 - this extra loose
37:11 - kind of video out
37:14 - but and why this is so
37:20 - don't worry about that okay
37:22 - so now
37:26 - oh i see this has been probably tied up
37:29 - to be stored so if i untie it
37:40 - this is
37:42 - there we go
37:44 - just want to remove this which is in my
37:46 - way
37:47 - this is the joystick
37:51 - which is now not plugged in
37:55 - so that's okay
37:56 - leave that to the side
37:58 - and now this
38:00 - must be the video out
38:02 - cable
38:04 - i hope the chat isn't all yelling at me
38:06 - like you're doing it wrong
38:09 - i'm pretty sure i'm doing it right
38:14 - yeah there we go
38:15 - okay
38:18 - now let's plug in
38:21 - ah this is one of no this is just an
38:23 - extra
38:25 - this must be for the printer this must
38:27 - be for the printer this one i'm guessing
38:29 - so let's put that off to the side all
38:30 - right we're ready for the
38:32 - power supply now
38:35 - so this is going to go in here i'm going
38:36 - to check the chat in a second to make
38:38 - sure there's nobody yelling at me like
38:40 - you're about to set everything on fire
38:43 - um
38:45 - okay
38:46 - uh okay i'm just looking at the chat
38:49 - here
38:50 - thank you
38:51 - uh put this off to the side
38:54 - now
38:56 - now this needs to be i need an extension
38:59 - cord
39:01 - again this is going to be very
39:02 - anticlimactic when i can't get anything
39:05 - to turn on or work but that's okay i'll
39:07 - go off and do something else
39:10 - with my day you will too
39:13 - you will too okay
39:16 - all right this actually has quite a bit
39:18 - of
39:19 - uh
39:20 - slack on it
39:22 - uh that light is plugged in through an
39:24 - extension cord let me find another
39:25 - extension cord
39:29 - okay where where where
39:34 - went to my
39:37 - local
39:39 - hardware store
39:42 - bought
39:42 - a couple these are these are uh 2000
39:45 - circa 2022 era extension cords
39:50 - someday
39:52 - my children will be unpacking a box and
39:54 - be like look at this
39:57 - two-year-old extension core
40:00 - you're like
40:03 - what is this strange macbook pro machine
40:08 - uh all right is this gonna be long
40:09 - enough this is a very short extension
40:11 - cord what was i thinking let's get along
40:14 - is it where's let's get a longer one
40:16 - um i actually have some in a box over
40:18 - here
40:20 - previously
40:21 - here's a really long here this is
40:23 - probably a uh
40:25 - circa i'm guessing 2021
40:28 - era extension cord much longer
40:31 - very dramatic here as i
40:34 - i made such a mess in this room i just i
40:37 - really shouldn't stream i should just
40:38 - spend my whole day cleaning and in fact
40:40 - that's is all i ever want to do is clean
40:43 - clean up organize
40:45 - can i just do that for the rest of my
40:47 - life i'd be so happy
40:49 - all right now we gotta find a place to
40:51 - plug this in
40:52 - where i won't trip over it where is the
40:55 - nearest
40:56 - power outlet
40:59 - uh not over there
41:01 - all right all right this is
41:04 - not the greatest you know what i'm gonna
41:06 - bring it over here
41:09 - okay
41:10 - uh if everything i'm about to plug this
41:12 - in
41:13 - if everything goes off it's because i've
41:16 - short-circuited my entire setup and
41:18 - blown several fuses okay it is plugged
41:20 - in
41:21 - it is now plugged in now
41:24 - i would also like to plug in
41:26 - this monitor
41:28 - that i believe
41:30 - the power cord should be able to
41:32 - reach but
41:34 - that's what a short extension cord is
41:36 - for
41:37 - where did i put that short extension
41:39 - cord people
41:41 - it's somewhere around here i had it in
41:43 - my hands a moment ago i walked over here
41:47 - to find a different extension cord oh
41:49 - there it is
41:51 - okay
41:54 - i'm sorry i don't have like a wide shot
41:56 - or anything i should have
41:58 - thought about this more but
42:00 - it it's kind of an impulse stream
42:02 - decided to do this today so now i'm
42:04 - plugging in the monitor
42:06 - this is going to go
42:09 - into hmm
42:12 - i need a three prong okay wait hold on
42:16 - this should okay
42:17 - the light's gonna go off but i don't
42:19 - think that matters
42:20 - uh now this should be able to go plug in
42:23 - like
42:24 - oh my god seriously
42:27 - there we go ah no don't fall over okay
42:30 - there we go the monitor should be
42:31 - plugged in
42:36 - ready everyone i'm gonna turn this and
42:37 - press this button
42:43 - okay it's on
42:49 - i don't see it i don't see anything
42:50 - happening
42:52 - the computer's not on nor is the
42:53 - computer plugged in
42:55 - okay where's the analog video cable that
42:58 - i found
43:00 - i put it somewhere oh it's over here
43:03 - so let's look at the back of this one
43:04 - probably just maybe it just needs to
43:06 - warm up
43:09 - video in
43:11 - okay this is going into the video in
43:16 - now this there's a lot of things like
43:17 - there's this this must be the video out
43:20 - i'm guessing but there's also this video
43:22 - i'm gonna just try this
43:25 - and what's the chance
43:27 - that this thing actually turns on
43:29 - and something shows up here seems very
43:31 - very unlikely
43:33 - i'm going to take a look at the chat
43:36 - just to see if anyone's got any
43:38 - tips for me or important bits of
43:41 - information
43:44 - um
43:45 - okay tetris would be fun
43:48 - okay
43:50 - uh maybe plug in the signal to see the
43:53 - signal i don't know what that means but
43:54 - that sounds like a very smart suggestion
44:01 - am i blocking your view with this it's
44:03 - terrible terrible
44:05 - um
44:06 - put this down here
44:12 - contrast is all the way up
44:19 - oh hilariously the switch is on
44:22 - i didn't check that so let me turn it
44:24 - off
44:26 - that's weird
44:37 - yeah i have i this is what i was
44:39 - expecting would happen
44:40 - nothing
44:47 - and scene
44:49 - thank you for tuning in to today's
44:51 - coding train live stream i'm going to
44:53 - spend all weekend getting this thing to
44:55 - work i'll probably have to repair it and
44:57 - look up read stuff but let's see let's
44:58 - see if i can get any further just even
45:01 - in today
45:03 - ah
45:05 - it would help for this to be on
45:07 - okay let's turn this off
45:10 - this one ah there we go
45:11 - that's something
45:17 - maybe that's the wrong way
45:18 - oh there we go
45:22 - yeah
45:24 - can you see this power light here i
45:26 - don't know if that makes it through
45:32 - oh my goodness
45:34 - it's on
45:36 - can you see that
45:39 - i have to see i've just checked my
45:41 - monitor here on that yeah you can see
45:42 - that all right
45:44 - this is promising
45:46 - now it said the apple wants me to talk
45:49 - to it through the keyboard
45:51 - computer
45:54 - play minecraft
45:58 - it didn't seem to work
46:03 - well this was at least something
46:04 - happened
46:06 - let's play with this contrast yeah look
46:07 - at that wow turn it all the way up
46:10 - all right what do people think do i need
46:12 - what's in these disk drives
46:15 - one drive two
46:19 - reset
46:24 - whoa something changed there
46:29 - what happens if i turn it off and on
46:30 - again
46:31 - what maybe that'll work turn it off and
46:33 - on again
46:37 - look at the chat here
46:40 - uh
46:45 - uh do you have i think people are
46:47 - suggesting
46:48 - uh various other perhaps youtube uh
46:51 - personalities or technology experts who
46:54 - might actually be able to help me get
46:55 - this thing working
46:57 - um what i see on the screen tells me
46:59 - stuff is powered up but i'm not
47:01 - convinced it's doing anything productive
47:03 - check all the boards are seated push the
47:05 - reset key okay
47:10 - press the reset key
47:13 - let's be more aggressive and turn it off
47:19 - and i am going to have to start to check
47:21 - to see if all the boards are in place
47:24 - and
47:25 - what might be needed
47:30 - oh it's definitely trying to load
47:31 - something from this disk oh apple ii it
47:34 - says apple ii
47:35 - do you see that
47:37 - it says apple ii
47:45 - it's a black screen with apple ii at the
47:46 - top
47:48 - and it tried this disk drive went
47:51 - like it wanted to load a disk from it
47:55 - let's see what disks i have
48:00 - like do i need to load dos
48:05 - oh look at this oh my god
48:07 - people
48:11 - this is not my handwriting this is my
48:13 - handwriting i think
48:16 - i think that's my handwriting
48:18 - what autofocus on it pretty sure that's
48:20 - my handwriting but this is definitely my
48:22 - dad's handwriting here
48:27 - um
48:28 - assembler
48:29 - supertext
48:32 - by the way handle like never forget
48:34 - handle like
48:35 - glass
48:38 - don't keep them comfortable don't jam
48:40 - them into our slots so do i try one of
48:42 - these discs just as apple ii there
48:46 - uh holding down control while pressing
48:48 - and releasing reset then releasing
48:49 - control called doing a control reset
48:51 - will send you into applesoft without
48:53 - having to boot a disk okay
48:56 - holding down control
48:58 - while pressing and releasing
49:01 - um
49:03 - reset okay here we go
49:10 - i have a dos prompt
49:17 - keyboard
49:19 - doesn't seem to be connected
49:25 - but no i did control reset
49:31 - that's interesting i've gotten a dos
49:33 - prompt now
49:37 - um
49:41 - yes my father is still with us ask the
49:43 - chat
49:44 - um
49:48 - so let's see what other
49:50 - discs i have
49:53 - that's not a dos product okay excuse me
49:56 - it's been a little it's been about 40
49:58 - years since i took a look at this
50:02 - these are just blanked as hardball
50:05 - is that a game
50:07 - wave that's my brother's handwriting
50:09 - wavy navy backup what is wavy navy
50:13 - joust side two can you have this is a
50:15 - double-sided disc
50:17 - side one chivalry side two joust
50:22 - oh my god
50:23 - so i really want to get this analog
50:26 - this is going to be the one thing that
50:28 - i'm really thrilled about is this analog
50:30 - video is working so there's no reason
50:31 - why i couldn't get the analog out
50:33 - and pass it you know convert it to hdmi
50:37 - and then pass it into my capture card so
50:39 - i could be at my
50:41 - uh sort of like live streaming the
50:42 - actual display out although it might
50:44 - just be more fun to have a a nice camera
50:47 - trained right on the monitor itself
50:49 - by the coding train is from now on just
50:52 - an apple 2 plus coding channel
50:54 - summer games oh i remember this game
50:57 - i remember this game i feel like i was i
51:00 - would get in trouble for look at this
51:01 - okay i think i drew that this is so
51:04 - weird
51:05 - but kind of delightful i'm sorry that
51:07 - thank you for indulging this bit of
51:08 - nostalgia from me but this here
51:12 - that's my handwriting says summer games
51:14 - and then i think this is me drawing the
51:16 - like olympic torch and those are like
51:18 - the steps up to the torch i think i just
51:20 - remember this game where to run you had
51:22 - to like press the arrow keys back and
51:24 - forth
51:26 - and i feel like i was always like break
51:28 - the computer
51:29 - these two arrow keys here
51:32 - so i think i should try to load a disk
51:35 - but
51:37 - these aren't do these things just boo
51:39 - these aren't bootable right
51:42 - i'm looking for like
51:49 - uh apple tosses thing but key control oh
51:51 - i okay so i want to look for
51:55 - like a boot disk
51:59 - pascal
52:02 - copy a fort
52:06 - fort two side one big mac assembler side
52:09 - two
52:10 - task compiler
52:12 - zoom graphics
52:14 - fort one ascii express beagle basic i
52:18 - remember this
52:23 - is this something that will just look
52:24 - requires apple 2e or 2 or 2 plus with
52:27 - ram card
52:30 - we put this in
52:32 - do this very carefully
52:36 - it's in
52:38 - closed
52:40 - now do i just turn the thing off and on
52:41 - again i hate doing this i don't want to
52:46 - most apple discs have an os on them just
52:48 - put it in and turn it on okay
52:57 - do you hear that i have noise reduction
52:59 - on
53:00 - that doesn't sound good do you hear that
53:05 - i'm putting the mic up to the disk drive
53:11 - i stuck my mic
53:14 - oh i'm typing
53:16 - ah syntax error
53:18 - all right
53:19 - all right wait
53:22 - everybody okay we're somewhere now and
53:24 - um
53:26 - i have so many cameras okay
53:29 - everyone what let's just take a moment
53:31 - here and let me do a little cleanup
53:32 - because i've made a total and my
53:34 - excitement i've made a total mess of
53:36 - this area and i want to clean it up a
53:38 - little bit i can move the camera so that
53:40 - you can see what's on the screen better
53:42 - so i could put some music on or
53:43 - something if you want but i'm probably
53:44 - just going to do this in silence
53:47 - and let me let me just organize this
53:48 - area a bit
53:50 - okay take this box over here
53:56 - because i just started like unboxing
53:58 - everything and going crazy
54:01 - and
54:02 - i just i want to be really careful with
54:04 - all this stuff especially now that it is
54:06 - i mean this now that it's working
54:15 - so i'm just off to the side talk amongst
54:18 - yourselves
54:21 - and i'm just going to move
54:23 - things that i'm not using
54:25 - i mean i think it would be nice to
54:26 - actually set this up properly the whole
54:29 - point
54:30 - is that this goes
54:33 - over it so let's see if i can get that
54:35 - let's see if i can make this work um
54:39 - type catalog okay i can't resist
54:46 - where's the
54:48 - where's the delete button
54:51 - ah
54:52 - not reset how do i go back
54:55 - there's no delete oh arrow
54:58 - no why am i typing data you said catalog
55:01 - c-a-t-a-l-o-g
55:05 - whoa the the some of these the c is not
55:07 - working
55:09 - the c is not working that's a bad oh no
55:11 - i got to work
55:12 - just had to bang on it a few times
55:16 - t
55:17 - a
55:18 - l o come on o
55:21 - come on o
55:23 - needs to wake up there just used to wake
55:25 - up g
55:30 - i think that sound is awful
55:33 - i owe error
55:35 - okay let me keep organizing myself here
55:37 - because i think everyone's going to be
55:38 - happier including myself
55:40 - if i can just get
55:42 - this set up in a way that it doesn't
55:44 - look so messy
55:46 - and
55:47 - that everybody can see it better and
55:49 - enjoy
55:50 - uh
55:51 - enjoy uh helping me along to try to get
55:54 - this thing going it's 1 30. i also i i
55:56 - as much as i would love to do this all
55:57 - day i don't know how realistic that is
55:59 - so
56:00 - this is probably going to wrap up
56:02 - relatively soon
56:04 - but this is only the beginning my
56:05 - friends
56:07 - only the beginning let me tell you
56:11 - okay
56:12 - uh
56:13 - this looks like i brought my lunch with
56:15 - me this is like this is like a 40 year
56:17 - old brown paper bag
56:20 - unbelievable
56:22 - it could be older than that
56:25 - uh this
56:27 - this is extraordinary finding these uh
56:29 - cassette tape games because i remember
56:32 - we would wait like 20 minutes to load
56:34 - these like let's play the game okay
56:35 - let's put the set in 20 minutes later
56:39 - um so again i need to set up a whole
56:42 - shelf system but i'm going to go through
56:44 - these discs so we can try some other
56:46 - ones
56:49 - but let's try to get this actually
56:52 - set up in a way now
56:54 - those of you watching i'm so
56:57 - kind of used to the idea that i can just
56:59 - turn off a computer and turn it back on
57:02 - as often as i like
57:06 - is there an issue with me doing that
57:09 - like should i be typing in some command
57:11 - like
57:13 - turn off
57:14 - i don't think that's the right command
57:17 - um let me move these oh i made myself
57:20 - this lovely coffee and i didn't even
57:22 - open it
57:26 - okay
57:28 - um
57:30 - move these things
57:42 - so
57:44 - i'm gonna put the
57:47 - put the top on
57:54 - let me just check if anybody's saying
57:56 - anything in the chat
58:00 - maybe you should type run before catalog
58:01 - to load the embedded dos no just turn it
58:05 - off
58:06 - you can turn the apple on and off with
58:08 - the switch this was before shutdown so
58:10 - yeah that's how i feel too
58:12 - okay
58:13 - so i'm gonna
58:16 - turn it off
58:17 - i'm gonna unplug it
58:20 - i feel like i need two disk drives but i
58:22 - guess i have them
58:24 - i would like now
58:27 - i'm gonna unplug
58:29 - the video cord
58:35 - come on
58:39 - put these on top
58:48 - this here
58:53 - this out of the way temporarily
59:07 - side
59:16 - looking good
59:19 - looking good everybody
59:25 - everybody okay you all doing all right
59:27 - over there
59:29 - that goes there
59:32 - this goes here
59:34 - slide it out a little bit
59:36 - there we go now
59:38 - this
59:39 - is
59:42 - okay you know what's amazing about this
59:46 - that fan
59:47 - which is blowing lovely cool air here
59:50 - all of my here a bunch of disks
59:53 - i will put here
59:57 - this card
59:58 - table and now
60:01 - [Music]
60:04 - okay just a little there we go
60:06 - everything's fine
60:07 - it's gonna go back out of the way
60:22 - now
60:23 - i have this stool here with adjustable
60:25 - height
60:33 - so
60:34 - i can sit here now let's figure out what
60:36 - i'm going to do with this camera
60:38 - so it is plugged into a lot of things
60:42 - but i'm going to attempt
60:44 - to move it
60:46 - here
60:49 - give you all
60:51 - a good shot
60:56 - there we go
60:58 - this looks promising
61:05 - and then if i sit here
61:08 - i could talk to you about my apple 2
61:10 - plus computer look at this it's like i
61:11 - professionally designed the studio to
61:13 - work like this
61:15 - although i'm in front of some of the
61:16 - most beautiful parts okay
61:18 - so we need to plug things back in again
61:21 - so
61:22 - this has to
61:30 - put this on top of the disk drive
61:33 - that's what i would like to do and then
61:34 - this goes
61:36 - oh where's the plug there
61:39 - i don't know what i'm showing you right
61:40 - now my the back of my sweater
61:44 - so
61:47 - come on where are you
61:54 - okay i'm gonna have to just pull
61:56 - this table out so i can see the back for
61:59 - a second
62:09 - here
62:11 - this gets plugged in here
62:18 - okay that's plugged in
62:21 - i'm very surprised that i actually even
62:22 - got anything
62:24 - working today and then now i need the
62:27 - video cable the analog video cable which
62:30 - is coming out of the monitor here
62:40 - one
62:43 - angled up there we go
62:45 - and this goes into
62:48 - this
62:58 - okay
63:04 - now one question i have is
63:06 - can i just leave this i wonder if i can
63:08 - leave the switch on on the back of the
63:10 - computer
63:12 - and use this as my switch to turn the
63:14 - computer on
63:15 - we're gonna find out
63:18 - okay the monitor is on
63:21 - there's a disk in here beagle brothers
63:24 - dos
63:26 - and i'm going to turn it on
63:32 - apple ii how's your view of this let me
63:34 - get my the chat over here
63:38 - the fan hangs on the back yeah i think
63:40 - that's right
63:42 - but
63:43 - i don't i'm not really set up to easily
63:45 - attach stuff right now okay i can see
63:48 - the chat
63:49 - on the side
63:51 - it's supposed to go through the slots on
63:53 - the side of the apple but you could hang
63:54 - on the stand
63:57 - seems like it's not the worst thing to
63:59 - have it right here although i guess what
64:00 - i could do this light is a little bit in
64:02 - the way
64:04 - i can move everything over
64:07 - and there's plenty of room for
64:10 - them both to have their own
64:13 - little spot
64:16 - okay
64:19 - auto start rom was introduced by apple 2
64:21 - plus in 1978 so turn on the computer
64:24 - with a bootable floppy inside rom will
64:26 - scan port to find 0x80
64:30 - bootable sequence okay
64:33 - um can't you plug the monitor into the
64:35 - system saver and then they would both
64:36 - turn on at the same time ah great point
64:39 - i could do that
64:41 - um all right the view is good says
64:44 - everybody
64:45 - um but i'm not
64:48 - seeing anything
64:51 - um
64:52 - okay so let me look through the stack of
64:55 - floppy disks
64:58 - gorgon pac-man and other games
65:02 - well let's try these one at a time
65:14 - olympic decathlon
65:16 - let's try this
65:31 - ah okay look at this
65:33 - look at this
65:36 - backup copy games disk volume 254. hello

71:24 - let's just try a different disc
71:26 - i mean i kind of want to work with
71:27 - beagle basic
71:33 - big mac assembler
71:38 - daniel schiff oh yeah so this is my
71:41 - science project
71:43 - so i did a science project in like
71:45 - fourth grade
71:47 - uh which was about i remember i don't
71:49 - really remember exactly it said summer
71:51 - it said summer games on it and then it's
71:53 - crossed out then it says daniel shiffman
71:55 - typing tutor perception
71:57 - because i made a program well let's see
71:59 - if this i remember writing a program in
72:01 - basic
72:02 - that was like doing an experiment around
72:04 - people's perception
72:07 - so we're putting this in
72:09 - we're turning it on
72:11 - apple ii
72:16 - okay look at this
72:18 - typing tutor start typing tutor hello
72:20 - perception.c
72:31 - this is amazing to me i don't know di
72:33 - can i like catalog can i just do like
72:44 - yeah so catalog will give me what's on
72:45 - the disk can you i wish i should i'm
72:47 - going to turn the noise
72:49 - suppression off it'll be very echo-y
72:50 - here but i feel like you want to hear
72:52 - the
72:53 - hear the disk drive whirring but
72:55 - um all right so
72:56 - how can i look at i want to type cat
72:59 - like where's the dot
73:02 - this is i assume this is like apple dos
73:05 - right so there must be a thing for i
73:07 - must be able to look at that
73:08 - perception.c file somehow like i would
73:11 - type cat
73:13 - and then i'd hit start typing p and then
73:15 - i'd hit tab
73:16 - the bar doesn't work good thing the
73:18 - right arrow does
73:20 - this is not going to work
73:24 - that's why i couldn't can't even type
73:25 - anything close to what's right
73:27 - syntax error um
73:32 - fortran
73:33 - c yeah uh
73:36 - print list plus print your text
73:39 - catalog
73:41 - if i type catalog and then the name of
73:44 - the file it'll list it
73:48 - i don't know who this 8-bit
73:50 - person is that everyone's referring to
73:52 - but i'll have to
73:58 - n key
74:06 - the return key seems to work one out of
74:08 - every maybe like three or four times
74:14 - syntax error
74:16 - list then list
74:18 - load load file name
74:21 - thanks everybody
74:31 - the sound of the keyboard is just lovely
74:37 - come on period
74:41 - oops no don't do another one
74:48 - okay i loaded it
74:52 - then lift
74:54 - nano
74:56 - yeah these numbers are scary that's for
74:58 - sure
75:05 - i really wish the return key would work
75:07 - a bit better
75:10 - look there's my program
75:13 - oh look at that
75:15 - that's code that i wrote like fourth
75:16 - grade i mean i think i wrote it i i mean
75:19 - i'm sure i had help i i have no memory i
75:21 - mean i have a memory of it a loose
75:22 - memory get s i print s i incorrect
75:29 - go to 180 print press any key so how do
75:32 - i run this
75:38 - oh
75:42 - i'm running at what level i don't
75:44 - what is this program that i wrote this
75:46 - is crazy okay what level
75:49 - one
75:53 - okay what did i see
75:56 - i didn't see anything it was too fast
75:59 - i saw i'll just make a guess zero nope
76:05 - i think there's a bug everybody there's
76:07 - a bug in my code
76:10 - control c there's no
76:14 - reset
76:16 - escape
76:19 - this isn't the fi the fire department's
76:21 - not going to come this isn't like
76:22 - directly wired to like some emergency
76:24 - line
76:27 - i guess i've just turned off the
76:28 - computer now
76:34 - uh yeah i can refactor i guess i'm just
76:36 - have to turn this off
76:37 - well that was fun
76:41 - another
76:42 - disc to look at
76:45 - she's going through these
76:46 - i really want to look at this beagle
76:48 - basic
76:50 - but um i guess i'll come back to that
76:52 - see what else
76:54 - ascii express super text 1989
76:59 - super text files what is super school
77:01 - backup
77:02 - i'm a little bit afraid
77:05 - to look at that
77:08 - yeah look at this this is my weird
77:10 - childhood cursive handwriting i'm pretty
77:12 - sure
77:15 - um
77:16 - daniel schiffman december 4th 1982 i
77:19 - would be nine years old then i believe
77:22 - v30 let's see what's on this
77:34 - there we go
77:41 - daniel schiffman
77:43 - december 4th 1982
77:46 - press return to go on
77:51 - this is like some real
77:53 - stranger thing style
77:56 - weird i think i inhaled a lot of dust
78:01 - hopefully i'll be okay
78:06 - file not found break in 90.
78:09 - this must be some other
78:12 - i need to get some water
78:22 - tunnels of terror sound effects
78:25 - ronald reagan's space odyssey
78:30 - apple vision viper
78:35 - dice
78:37 - typing tutor whoa windshield wiper so a
78:40 - lot of the perception which is dance
78:43 - the entertainer
78:47 - what the
78:59 - oh strange
79:01 - what are all these files
79:03 - load dice
79:08 - okay
79:09 - this looks like a program that let's see
79:11 - if we can understand this
79:13 - can you can you read the text
79:15 - it's hard for me to see
79:17 - yeah it looks like you can
79:19 - i'm looking at a preview okay
79:23 - print one two three four five six
79:26 - four i equals one to one hundred
79:29 - go sub 500
79:33 - so
79:34 - for a hundred times go to 500 which
79:37 - pits picks
79:38 - makes a variable d which is the integer
79:41 - version of six times random of one plus
79:43 - one boy this surprisingly it looks like
79:45 - code that we would write right now
79:49 - um
79:51 - return
79:54 - so then they go back return so go sub
79:56 - tells you to go down here then you hit
79:57 - return we come back here n d equals nd
80:01 - plus one now what is all this doing
80:04 - oh this is this must be v tab three h
80:07 - tab six this is like
80:09 - setting a spot on the monitor
80:11 - let's run it
80:16 - it
80:17 - did i make this
80:19 - this is wild it's rolling a die
80:22 - a virtual die
80:24 - 100 times
80:26 - and keeping track of how many times it
80:28 - rolled each number it rolled the 5 23
80:30 - times
80:35 - should be able to understand this now
80:36 - yeah look at this
80:39 - this is this is this is like
80:41 - the greatest day of my life
80:43 - [Laughter]
80:46 - uh
80:51 - i'm reading the chat now which is kind
80:52 - of fun it's a delay
80:58 - so i understand this is picking the
81:02 - right random number
81:04 - then
81:06 - n but where is n initialized
81:12 - like where did i allocate the memory for
81:14 - n does it just happen automatically like
81:16 - this is like oh we're gonna make an
81:17 - array with index
81:20 - one two three four five or this like is
81:22 - that a function that's like count so
81:27 - uh i need my computer to look up basic
81:29 - here and try to understand i want to
81:30 - write i mean like
81:33 - i mean i want to i want to write this
81:35 - code again and like learn how to do it
81:38 - i think some more names in the chat that
81:40 - i recognize
81:43 - how do i edit it
81:50 - no
81:51 - don't fall off my chair here
81:53 - you don't need to allocate small arrays
81:55 - says copper france
81:58 - [Music]
82:04 - wow this is quite
82:07 - amazing
82:08 - variables are dynamically allocated and
82:10 - initialized to zero it's basic don't
82:12 - worry about memory allocation yeah so
82:14 - how do i edit this
82:19 - i want to run it again it's too much fun
82:26 - see the pseudo random number generator
82:30 - those add up to 100 right 42
82:33 - 52 54 64 68 78
82:38 - 84 100 yep
82:42 - edit by typing a number and replacing
82:44 - that line of code
82:46 - retype a whole line
82:49 - oh
82:50 - okay
82:53 - okay let's see
82:57 - so where is the delay
83:03 - uh oh let's try okay let's try this
83:08 - for
83:10 - i
83:11 - equal
83:14 - [Music]
83:18 - shift key is a problem
83:22 - so i think one of the things i'm going
83:23 - to need to do is get um
83:25 - an air compressor to clean this
83:27 - i mean i would love to be typing on it
83:29 - directly but i could also probably get a
83:31 - different keyboard and kind of hook it
83:32 - up somehow
83:37 - i'm never going to get that equals
83:43 - is there a caps lock
83:47 - both shifts
83:50 - yeah
83:54 - no all right so this line
83:56 - how do i cancel now i don't want to mess
83:58 - with this line
84:02 - let's do this
84:05 - um
84:06 - for uh yeah
84:09 - yeah there is no delay basic on a one
84:10 - megahertz machine is just slow try the
84:12 - other shift key i certainly did all
84:14 - right um v tab
84:16 - four let's just try changing that
84:19 - 132
84:21 - v tap
84:23 - v
84:25 - stupid the space and the shift are
84:29 - oh good how do i
84:31 - what is r-e-p-t this
84:34 - this is very frustrating
84:42 - try one more time
84:45 - one three two
84:48 - v
84:51 - t
84:51 - a
84:52 - b
84:53 - b
84:54 - d
84:55 - b
84:57 - space
84:58 - so let's try v tab eight
85:06 - now let's list
85:08 - oh i edited it my code change let's be
85:11 - tab eight
85:12 - and i can run it now
85:16 - look it's down here now
85:18 - [Music]
85:20 - i wrote some new basic code today on an
85:22 - apple two plus computer is that what you
85:24 - thought you'd be seeing today live
85:27 - on youtube
85:31 - okay
85:32 - a working keyboard would make for a nice
85:33 - start yeah our ept goes repeat the keys
85:36 - do not auto repeat
85:38 - um
85:40 - uh
85:42 - line 500 is a function
85:44 - um okay all right let's um
85:49 - let's see what else we got on this
85:51 - computing machine
85:56 - anybody want to see what ronald reagan
85:58 - space odyssey is my goodness what is
86:00 - that
86:01 - draw a pencil
86:03 - we gotta look at what draw a pencil is
86:07 - tunnels of terror
86:09 - sound effects
86:11 - dice is what we're just looking at
86:14 - help
86:16 - apple vision
86:20 - star destroyer anybody had any requests
86:26 - let's look at um
86:30 - let's see what music is
86:41 - remember to git commit says ronyettes
86:45 - okay
86:48 - i think the keyboard is kind of
86:49 - loosening up here all right
86:52 - what
86:55 - what
86:55 - [Applause]
87:00 - what
87:18 - okay
87:19 - select from the following list play
87:21 - piece on disk enter new piece exit from
87:23 - program
87:25 - let's try one
87:28 - okay i'm going to load
87:31 - the entertainer must have been
87:32 - music right
87:36 - enter name of peace from the list below
87:39 - the
87:40 - space
87:42 - enter
87:43 - [Music]
87:44 - tay
87:53 - there's a speaker in it
88:12 - bum
88:16 - [Music]
88:21 - it's going again
88:24 - is it gonna stop or am i gonna have to
88:26 - turn the computer off
88:46 - all right
88:48 - enter a new piece
88:50 - let's try that
88:52 - how many beats per minute people
88:58 - 120
89:00 - select major key signature
89:03 - all right how about c
89:06 - do you want instructions
89:09 - no i don't need instructions
89:16 - i'm sorry but you're going to have to
89:18 - pause a little bit faster enter the
89:20 - value of the note or rest w is whole
89:22 - note
89:24 - you know it's amazing how little
89:26 - patience i think i have i have just like
89:28 - developed the
89:30 - quick gratification like instant
89:32 - gratification internet like
89:35 - click
89:36 - use way of being and this is like
89:39 - driving me crazy like i can't possibly
89:40 - read all these instructions and slowly
89:42 - figure out how to interact with this but
89:44 - i can
89:45 - um enter the type of note
89:48 - apple will then play the note the note
89:50 - is correct play return okay
89:54 - any key to continue what's a key that i
89:57 - know tends to work there we go good luck
90:00 - enter section one
90:26 - ah
90:27 - oh i love that
90:31 - i'm trying to enter like
90:33 - a deer a female deer
90:41 - i'm assuming x means i'm done
90:46 - how do i get out of this
90:53 - you can't hear it
90:59 - have you not been able to hit the music
91:02 - is my is my uh mic off or just like you
91:05 - can't hear
91:07 - the sound
91:17 - uh
91:20 - yeah all right um
91:25 - i don't think i've had to type in x yet
91:31 - i don't know how to get out of this
91:37 - i guess we'll be turning this computer
91:39 - off you hear a tiny bit remove the noise
91:41 - suppression okay
91:42 - let me go shut that off people
91:45 - one second
92:09 - okay the noise removal and room echo
92:12 - removal is
92:14 - off now
92:16 - so
92:20 - and let's see it's quite loud so i think
92:25 - you can hear that now i bet right
92:32 - control c exits a basic program let's
92:34 - try
92:37 - so i just don't know
92:38 - whether like the shift wasn't working so
92:42 - i have a bad feeling that control
92:44 - probably isn't working
92:47 - did you did you hear the entertainer did
92:49 - you not hear the entertainer i got to
92:51 - play you the entertainer
92:54 - all right i think i'm gonna have to just
92:56 - reboot this machine
93:02 - use b-y-e
93:06 - i don't think that's gonna work
93:09 - escape control c
93:10 - [Music]
93:14 - all right i'm gonna have to just power
93:15 - this off
93:17 - control reset i guess i could have tried
93:18 - that
93:19 - um all right let's move on to another
93:21 - disc though
93:26 - i mean
93:31 - all right let's see what else we got
93:32 - here side one volume 31 comp let's see
93:36 - what this is school backup
93:39 - all right let's look at this disc
93:48 - every floppy disk is like a little
93:50 - basket of surprises
93:52 - oh it's two o'clock i'm gonna have to go
93:54 - soon
93:56 - i would say by the way you were saying
93:57 - b-y-e and like my mind was just like
93:59 - thinking about that as a key sequence
94:01 - and uh now i realize it's spell spy
94:04 - uh lesson five lesson eight lesson nine
94:08 - flying saucers ski trek
94:12 - the guesses design the experiment comp
94:16 - so we look at what lesson five is
94:19 - oh there's like a little menu here how
94:21 - do i go down oh look at this
94:24 - this disc has like a nice little menu
94:26 - loaded with a menu so let's go to lesson
94:27 - five
94:28 - run
94:32 - what is your name do you have a computer
94:37 - uh apple
94:39 - two
94:43 - hold on
94:47 - print what is your name input t
94:51 - do you have a computer a print t
94:54 - why did it not stop at that
94:56 - so let's see
95:00 - yeah okay
95:04 - do you have a computer dan
95:10 - what kind
95:12 - um i don't know
95:16 - uh iphone
95:20 - you heard it here first
95:22 - coding trade audience
95:24 - the iphone is a good computer
95:27 - all right i think this is going to work
95:28 - so by the way i have a project i want to
95:30 - do with this computer
95:32 - um
95:33 - there's a streaming service called
95:36 - nebula that i participate in and i'm
95:38 - going to work on some videos for it
95:40 - i'll be doing stuff for the coding train
95:41 - with it as well but um this is a good
95:43 - start
95:44 - um so i think
95:46 - now how can i write let's try writing a
95:48 - new
95:50 - program
95:52 - um how do i create something new
96:01 - ah there's nothing okay
96:06 - so 10 home
96:10 - 20
96:12 - print
96:16 - oh shoot

97:16 - frustrated
97:18 - uh
97:20 - there's my program
97:22 - which is definitely not gonna work
97:25 - oh didn't need the quotes
97:31 - create file name okay
97:52 - hit the any key hold on
97:56 - i must be able to do save right
97:58 - oops
98:07 - is it trying to write on the disk
98:11 - bang on the shift key not the two key
98:12 - that's a good point
98:25 - okay
98:31 - what did it save it as
98:36 - lesson 24 calories what is that the
98:39 - experiment conversation
98:42 - hebrew
98:44 - quote camera mix smoke research
98:48 - perception b perception 3 george
98:53 - space
98:54 - space 2
98:55 - [Music]
98:57 - what are all these things
99:00 - and
99:02 - where did it save it save
99:06 - choo

99:39 - what did i call it choo choo anybody see
99:41 - it
99:44 - and there it is
99:47 - that's the new computer program i wrote
99:49 - today
99:51 - is it still loaded okay 10
100:01 - 10
100:03 - print
100:06 - chew is it gonna just let me do it
100:09 - without the quotes
100:14 - no
100:17 - oh that was whoops i overwrote the wrong
100:20 - line
100:38 - oh there we go
100:55 - look at my basic program that i have
100:57 - written everybody oh i just knocked the
100:59 - camera it's all right
101:01 - let's run it
101:04 - here we go
101:07 - okay
101:10 - um
101:14 - i don't know if there's any moderators

102:11 - homer
102:16 - so now 20
102:19 - can i do a
102:23 - equals the shift is working now people
102:26 - r and d
102:30 - shoot
102:33 - one
102:35 - or can i do like r and d two
102:44 - 30
102:46 - print
102:48 - a
102:52 - okay ah look at that it gives me a
102:53 - floating point random number
102:57 - so now we need to
103:02 - change that to
103:03 - change that to oh
103:10 - just have to
103:11 - uh 20
103:14 - a
103:16 - equals
103:18 - equals
103:20 - r and
103:21 - d
103:25 - shoot
103:27 - equals rnd
103:32 - i think it can't give it an argument i
103:34 - assume
103:36 - it's just a function times
103:40 - a 2
103:42 - which should give me a 0 or a 1.
103:46 - oops
103:51 - uh-oh syntax error
103:54 - oh
103:57 - i have to type re-type the whole thing
104:06 - does it need an argument
104:09 - or is the
104:11 - is this not right
104:22 - okay
104:25 - here we go
104:26 - now
104:30 - can i do an if like what's an if in
104:32 - basic
104:51 - i don't see a backslash
104:54 - i only see a forward slash it's gonna be
104:56 - a problem
104:57 - uh
105:02 - also that key doesn't work
105:05 - let's just do that it's going to be a
105:07 - variation on 10 print
105:14 - are there no if statements in basic
105:19 - uh
105:20 - [Music]
105:22 - well i'm getting a lot of good comments
105:24 - here
105:24 - um
105:27 - oh i need to change it to an int yeah
105:31 - and
105:36 - let's just see let's just at least see
105:38 - if i can do
105:40 - so if i want to add a line i could do 15
105:43 - and i could say 4i
105:46 - how do i do a loop
105:52 - 4
105:54 - i
106:01 - what's the chance that's right
106:07 - no
106:08 - i think you need it then oh then
106:19 - did you all hear that
106:20 - that was a very bad sound and there's
106:22 - smoke
106:26 - i'd shut it off
106:28 - oh this is bad
106:34 - okay
106:35 - let's unplug everything
106:37 - safety first people
106:40 - oh no
106:41 - this is the one and only time i'm ever
106:43 - gonna get to do this
106:44 - unplugged everything
106:54 - oh it's a bad smell
106:57 - i'm gonna open a window over here
107:10 - let's back the camera up people
107:18 - i'm sure someone's gonna clip that
107:21 - little moment there
107:23 - the thing is everything was i don't know
107:24 - what what started to um
107:28 - i'm hoping it's just the power supply
107:30 - that's a
107:31 - that can be remedied
107:37 - this was fun while it lasted
107:45 - let's move this
107:50 - over here okay
107:54 - um
108:00 - that smell is awful
108:14 - i think it's
108:17 - i the
108:18 - it's the power supply
108:22 - oh it's still smoking
108:42 - okay i'm going to examine this later on
108:44 - my own time
108:46 - i'm going to first
108:49 - unplug
108:55 - this from the extension cord
109:01 - i wonder
109:05 - i mean
109:15 - i don't feel still smoking
109:20 - it doesn't feel super hot
109:26 - maybe switch to an apple ii emulator
109:29 - yeah
109:31 - um all right uh let me
109:36 - just come back over here for a moment
109:43 - um
109:46 - that was a little bit uh freaky
109:59 - uh oop here i am
110:02 - all right uh the light is not on me
110:04 - right now so it's a little bit dark
110:08 - um i'm very sad
110:12 - it was fun while it lasted oh that smell
110:15 - is terrible just looking at the chat
110:21 - um
110:23 - okay
110:28 - all right everyone i don't know if
110:29 - there's still people here watching i
110:31 - think i'm gonna
110:33 - call it a day but i've got a few things
110:35 - maybe that i can briefly mention or
110:39 - discuss let's turn
110:42 - to reset up the setup again
110:51 - at least get the lighting back
110:53 - the way it's supposed to be
111:08 - okay sorry everyone i'm
111:11 - okay um
111:15 - whoa that smell
111:17 - i cannot tell you how strong it is i
111:20 - mean it's like burning rubber or
111:21 - something
111:22 - um
111:24 - all right so
111:25 - uh thank you all for tuning in to
111:27 - today's live stream
111:29 - i'm not entirely sure what the purpose
111:31 - of it was i was having a grand old time
111:33 - until i heard that sound and started to
111:35 - see smoke on that apple two plus
111:36 - computer i hope this is not the only
111:39 - time
111:40 - that i am ever able to uh
111:43 - work with this machine or stream from it
111:45 - or so i'm gonna work on giving it a
111:47 - permanent home somewhere and kind of
111:50 - investigate
111:52 - it in more detail in my own time if
111:54 - anybody is watching happens to be an
111:56 - expert or have some tips for me or wants
111:58 - to put me in touch with someone that
111:59 - could help me restore the computer to
112:02 - its former glory i would love to hear
112:04 - that
112:05 - um
112:07 - psu capacitor pops you can purchase
112:10 - replacements says robbie in the chat hi
112:12 - robbie all right that's great to know
112:15 - some money from galvey to go to a recap
112:17 - service on my apple ii plus
112:20 - tends to be a lot of plastic in those
112:21 - old things so i can imagine the smell
112:23 - smell says eric typical apple device all
112:26 - right so i just want to briefly since
112:29 - i'm here
112:30 - and there are
112:32 - some small number of you watching i
112:34 - couldn't tell you how many
112:36 - um
112:38 - um i just want to briefly mention
112:42 - um
112:43 - um thank you chris
112:45 - uh get it recapped professionally what
112:48 - does what does that mean exactly uh
112:50 - because by golly i would love to have a
112:52 - professional come and restore this
112:54 - machine
112:54 - um
112:56 - but um i guess so while i'm here
113:00 - um i might as well mention this sort of
113:02 - goofy project that i'm working on
113:04 - related to the well
113:06 - it's related to the television show
113:07 - severance but the way i was putting that
113:10 - sounded like
113:11 - like i have some official
113:14 - thing that i'm doing which i don't at
113:16 - all
113:17 - um
113:18 - let's get
113:19 - going here and uh let's show you up the
113:23 - at the computer
113:25 - and i i'm a little bit brain dead right
113:27 - now i'm going to go to github.com
113:30 - lumen industries
113:32 - so um i'm just just a massive fan of the
113:35 - show which had the finale last night
113:38 - um and uh so first of all if you're
113:42 - i'm not gonna spoil anything from it
113:43 - please chat uh be on your best behavior
113:46 - um i would um so but i am gonna show
113:49 - this little project which is based on a
113:51 - piece of software that runs in the show
113:54 - with uh on one of these computers i
113:56 - don't think they're actually using one
113:58 - of these computers it's a prop
114:00 - um
114:00 - data general dasher d2
114:05 - not a t200 so um
114:09 - i showed this on twitch earlier this
114:11 - week but so this is the computer that uh
114:14 - i believe is in the show um
114:16 - and i'm not going to search um
114:19 - uh but like i think if i search like
114:21 - macro data refinement and do like an
114:24 - image search
114:26 - you'll see there's this um
114:28 - there's this software that the
114:30 - characters of the show
114:32 - are
114:33 - working with
114:35 - so i've been slowly
114:37 - over time building my own version of
114:39 - this software
114:40 - um and i'm going to show it to you now
114:43 - uh if you go and i was going to work on
114:45 - it today but i've run out of steam
114:48 - so if people are really interested in
114:49 - this tweet at me at shiffman
114:51 - uh and are like i'm gonna talk join the
114:54 - coding train discord i'll i'll talk
114:56 - about how you can get involved if you're
114:57 - interested in helping with this so this
114:59 - is the github repository for this
115:01 - project um if i go here and click on
115:03 - lumenindustries.com
115:06 - um you'll see this is my version
115:07 - actually somebody submitted a pull
115:08 - request adjusting the colors of it which
115:10 - was really good but it has some
115:13 - um
115:15 - has some issues with it
115:18 - so basically the idea here is that i
115:20 - need to find the scary numbers
115:23 - and bin them properly
115:26 - and then
115:28 - and i'm going to do a little hack here
115:30 - which is that if i just go into the
115:32 - console and overwrite the goal variable
115:34 - and set it to ten oh first of all it's
115:36 - gonna set me at 75 percent
115:39 - immediately benjamin durgo came for the
115:42 - and now i'm at a hundred percent so this
115:44 - is what i'm most proud of
115:46 - i created this share button
115:49 - which when you click it
115:51 - it copies your
115:53 - the address of the data that you just
115:56 - refined
115:58 - and a little message that you can share
116:01 - on social media so if i go to
116:02 - twitter.com
116:06 - mdr lumen
116:10 - um
116:11 - you can see here people are posting
116:15 - their data that they refined
116:17 - a la wordle and nothing is bringing me
116:20 - more
116:21 - happiness than seeing this right now but
116:25 - it needs a lot more work and guess what
116:28 - severance was renewed for a season two i
116:31 - don't know what i'm going to do for the
116:32 - next year
116:33 - i'm going to work on this
116:35 - i'm going to get back to coding train
116:37 - tutorials and things i would love
116:39 - especially if any of you are fans of the
116:40 - show to participate we can create a
116:42 - channel in the coding train discord i've
116:44 - been tracking
116:46 - um issues of things that i want to add
116:49 - to it here
116:50 - uh
116:51 - the ver the kind of first thing that i
116:54 - think i'd really like to do which i
116:55 - think would be quick is include the
116:56 - amount of time it took to refine the
116:58 - data
116:59 - um so that at least when you're posting
117:01 - a report to twitter it's a little bit
117:02 - more like it took you one minute 30
117:05 - seconds i'm sure there's some clever
117:07 - language we could come up with um
117:09 - there are also uh there's an e-book that
117:11 - the apple tv put out and that you can
117:14 - find which has like these are the actual
117:16 - rewards you're supposed to get at ten
117:17 - percent
117:18 - twenty-five percent
117:20 - seventy-five i have the seventy-five
117:21 - percent i mean that could be improved
117:23 - and 100 reward
117:25 - so um if any of you are interested in
117:28 - helping to develop this piece of
117:30 - software
117:32 - um
117:33 - by the way i'm just curious i'm gonna i
117:35 - know
117:36 - i'm he's
117:39 - changing subjects every five seconds
117:41 - here but i'm going to just quickly turn
117:43 - on
117:44 - the
117:45 - um
117:47 - noise removal uh and just sort of see i
117:49 - just quickly turn that on and i'm just
117:51 - curious if the sound i mean obviously
117:53 - when i was working with the apple ii
117:54 - plus we wanted to hear those noises but
117:56 - is the sound better worse the same
117:59 - i'm just curious to hear from you so
118:01 - i've been sort of tracking issues and
118:03 - things
118:05 - this is the pull request that um
118:06 - somebody graciously added but it has
118:08 - some conflicts in it i think uh
118:10 - adjusting the colors oh i would love to
118:12 - put in a um
118:14 - um
118:15 - i'd love to put in a like um
118:18 - i bet you we could do like a crt
118:21 - shader filter on the canvas
118:24 - that's probably something that i could
118:26 - learn how to do right
118:28 - just adding just adding issues i don't
118:30 - know does anybody have any questions
118:31 - about this any interest in it um i would
118:34 - love to hear from you um i also want to
118:36 - give a plug
118:39 - since i'm uh
118:40 - a plug here oh god that smell
118:43 - i'm very sensitive to certain kinds of
118:44 - smells like a bleach smell i can't be in
118:47 - the room get very sick and the smell is
118:49 - having that effect on me which i think
118:50 - is why i'm really struggling to continue
118:52 - this stream so
118:55 - sound is way better with the noise
118:56 - removal and the echo is completely gone
118:58 - yeah um yeah it actually and i only put
119:00 - it on 75 so this is using um my graphics
119:03 - card on this streaming machine the
119:05 - nvidia rtx broadcast software i mean i
119:08 - should sound treat the room that would
119:09 - be the proper way to do it but
119:12 - um i'm just curious uh
119:14 - i could i'm just also curious like while
119:16 - i'm here to turn it way up
119:18 - like um
119:20 - like i'm gonna turn it
119:21 - uh all the way up now i did open the
119:24 - door
119:25 - uh the thing about the garage
119:28 - fishy in the chat and thank you fishy uh
119:31 - fishy has created
119:33 - uh more
119:35 - uh this wonderful i don't um
119:38 - uh
119:39 - uh has been working on here it is has
119:42 - been working on a visualization for
119:45 - um
119:46 - what happens when you reach 100 for this
119:49 - little like animated sequence that
119:50 - happens in the show
119:52 - um so this is a fun uh based off of i
119:54 - think the pearl and noise terrain so
119:56 - there's a lot of potential there um so
119:59 - i'm going to turn it all the way up i'm
120:00 - just curious so now i'm at a hundred
120:02 - percent of noise removal and echo
120:05 - uh removal i'm just curious if better or
120:07 - worse i mean it's like you're at the eye
120:09 - doctor now
120:10 - um so
120:13 - anyway there's lots of things on this
120:15 - list i uh would love any contributions
120:18 - anybody wants to work on this with me
120:21 - uh i mean i do need to put this to the
120:23 - side and like kind of get back to some
120:26 - things i've totally made a mess of this
120:28 - room
120:30 - i don't know why i'm feeling so
120:32 - discouraged all of a sudden
120:33 - but
120:35 - uh
120:38 - using an ai filter on the graphics card
120:40 - is more on brand than physically sound
120:43 - which is very true thank you chris
120:45 - so um yeah so i guess i could keep
120:48 - talking about this i could come back and
120:50 - do another stream about it and like sort
120:52 - of work on this more if there's interest
120:53 - you can check
120:54 - let me just ah if you're really
120:55 - interested in this i'm sorry
120:58 - i will tell you what to do
121:02 - if you go to the youtube channel called
121:04 - coding train twitch archive um this is
121:08 - where i
121:10 - uh archive any streams that i'm doing on
121:13 - twitch and write
121:14 - so many important things to mention okay
121:16 - okay important coding train news
121:18 - announcements
121:21 - i i i kind of was setting up a new sound
121:23 - board
121:29 - that's an interesting noise bumper that
121:31 - i don't have all these bumpers from old
121:33 - times
121:40 - um okay what is this
121:43 - okay sorry sorry having fun over here
121:46 - all right um
121:51 - okay uh
121:53 - what was i going to say yes all right
121:57 - announcements
121:59 - there is a survey
122:04 - let's see if we can find it
122:08 - on uh on uh it's been shared via coding
122:10 - train social media ah yes here we go
122:12 - here it is thank you everyone has filled
122:14 - out the survey we are expecting
122:17 - it we are extending the deadline to
122:19 - april 4th ah that deadline is officially
122:21 - today
122:22 - april 8th today is the la i mean you can
122:24 - fill out the survey after the deadline
122:26 - but i need to next week
122:29 - i will i mean i was going to do it today
122:30 - is there a way i could do it today
122:32 - i'm going to figure out how to do this
122:34 - live without giving out any of these
122:35 - information
122:36 - but i want to i'll document somehow how
122:38 - we are picking the the uh
122:42 - to send the stickers but this is a
122:43 - survey just for feedback i'm kind of
122:45 - planning the rest of the year thinking
122:46 - about what i want to do one of the items
122:49 - on the survey is whether you prefer to
122:51 - watch live streams on youtube or twitch
122:54 - i can tell you right now spoiler alert
122:56 - the overwhelming response
122:59 - is about 75 25 on youtube but that's
123:01 - mostly because i've been posting the
123:03 - survey
123:04 - through check through various um
123:08 - uh channels i'm not a
123:11 - communication channels that are
123:13 - people are finding because they know
123:15 - about the youtube channel so i'm a
123:16 - little worried it's heavily biased there
123:18 - so again i said this on twitch earlier i
123:20 - don't want to put my thumb on the scale
123:22 - but if you're excited about um kind of
123:24 - bouncing a bit back and forth between
123:26 - twitch and youtube i would love to hear
123:27 - from you and what the sort of benefits
123:29 - of one platform versus the other are my
123:31 - kind of plan although
123:34 - there's no evidence that i'm putting
123:35 - this into motion is that twitch is more
123:37 - of a place for some sort of informal
123:39 - casual streams and youtube is the place
123:40 - where my properly
123:42 - planned and professionally produced
123:45 - it doesn't really exist but that's sort
123:47 - of an idea thank you me i am so me for
123:49 - posting the survey so um one of the
123:51 - things on the survey you don't it's an
123:53 - anonymous survey but if you want to be
123:54 - entered to win some coding train
123:56 - stickers you can put your email in there
123:57 - so that's important item number one
124:00 - um
124:01 - [Music]
124:04 - item
124:05 - number
124:07 - two
124:10 - oh
124:11 - in my head i was like oh i have three or
124:12 - four announcements and i started talking
124:14 - about the survey well there's a new
124:15 - website coming i really should be
124:17 - working i shouldn't be live streaming i
124:18 - should be working on that website
124:21 - i got to get back to recording coding
124:22 - challenges i've got tutorial i've got so
124:24 - much to do
124:25 - um
124:28 - all right let's talk about um
124:30 - let's talk about uh
124:32 - then so if you've missed the twitch
124:34 - streams you can find the archive of them
124:37 - here and in particular there's a whole
124:39 - stream i did about
124:42 - the macro data basically
124:44 - uh refinement program
124:47 - and i would be glad for you to check
124:49 - that out and contribute uh
124:52 - participate in the issues file any pull
124:54 - requests hit me up on discord on twitter
124:56 - et cetera et cetera at least just play
124:58 - the game share your results let's bring
125:01 - macro data refinement to the to the
125:03 - masses people
125:05 - uh and then i mean this is the la i'm
125:07 - just also going to shout out uh because
125:09 - i've gotten so obsessed with the show
125:10 - i've been listening to
125:12 - a podcast where some neuroscientists and
125:16 - psychologists
125:17 - are talking about various elements of
125:19 - the show
125:20 - and you can find that i would highly
125:21 - recommend if you just watch the full
125:23 - season i happen to be
125:25 - uh uh very poorly giving some of my
125:28 - takes in a very inelegant
125:30 - way
125:32 - on this particular episode eight
125:34 - feedback but i'm sure the new
125:36 - uh
125:37 - recaps of the finale will be posted soon
125:39 - so check that out it's a wonderful
125:41 - community of people who enjoy analyzing
125:43 - talking and discussing uh various um
125:45 - television shows i haven't gotten into a
125:47 - show like this in i don't know
125:49 - i can't remember when since when maybe
125:51 - lost
125:53 - many years ago i tried to get my kids to
125:55 - watch lost their kindling
125:58 - not interested i mean i think the
126:00 - um
126:01 - severance is is not appropriate for them
126:03 - but uh so if you're very young it's fine
126:06 - there's nothing really terribly uh it's
126:09 - it's it's dark it's a dark dark show so
126:12 - you know proceed with caution
126:14 - um
126:15 - duo q life says thank you that's a nice
126:18 - comment i i sometimes i feel like i
126:19 - shouldn't read the like complimentary
126:21 - comments
126:22 - like back to you because it's very
126:24 - self-aggrandizing but i do appreciate
126:26 - your kind feedback i think i got to be
126:28 - done today
126:29 - um
126:29 - [Music]
126:32 - um and simon i'm reading your feedback
126:35 - simon's giving me some feedback in the
126:36 - discord about me i also used to do these
126:38 - member-only streams
126:40 - i was doing really well like 2022 i was
126:44 - shot out of a cannon and i was streaming
126:46 - every week i was making coding
126:48 - challenges like like january and even
126:50 - some of february i was just like i had
126:52 - all this steam and i went away and
126:54 - there's been a lot of stuff going on and
126:57 - uh life gets in the way um
126:59 - but i think now i have a couple m i have
127:02 - a big project i'm working on
127:04 - that's gonna kind of get in my way a
127:05 - little bit the next couple weeks but i'm
127:07 - hoping to get back into the routine of
127:08 - things
127:09 - um and thank you
127:11 - oh i should see halt and catch fire
127:14 - okay yeah i mean lost
127:16 - don't get me started on like the last
127:18 - season i just mean like at its prime
127:20 - right lori thank you for your feedback
127:22 - and it's prime you know what was that i
127:25 - was thinking about numbers then
127:28 - um
127:29 - uh francella i am on sabbatical yes and
127:31 - and i have to say
127:35 - i mean surely i miss teaching i miss it
127:37 - more than i thought i would
127:39 - and also it's not the thing that's in
127:41 - the way of me being sort of like
127:42 - productive and doing all the things i
127:44 - want to do i mean it's definitely it
127:45 - keeps me
127:47 - i'm my own worst enemy i think when it
127:49 - comes to
127:50 - um trying to
127:53 - develop a sort of regular routine of
127:58 - of
128:00 - of making videos and working through i
128:02 - get i get very distracted and i get
128:04 - really obsessed with weird little things
128:05 - and get stuck on little technical
128:06 - problems so i don't know anyway
128:09 - um
128:11 - it's been a lot to try to set up this
128:12 - new studio and um
128:15 - i just want to make sure there's no
128:16 - smoke still i just don't want anything
128:17 - to be like i do have a smoke detector
128:19 - over there it didn't go off so i don't
128:21 - think it was that bad
128:23 - if you're just tuning in
128:25 - what you missed is
128:28 - the glorious glorious moment like
128:32 - this was like a
128:33 - one of the highlights of my entire life
128:35 - was setting up this old apple 2 plus
128:37 - computer from my childhood i was running
128:39 - my old basic programs from elementary
128:41 - school and then it made some horrible
128:43 - sounds smoke started coming out of it
128:46 - and i don't know what to do now i need i
128:48 - need help like as much as i want to be
128:50 - the person
128:51 - who could fix this myself that's not i'm
128:53 - not really a
128:54 - i'm not really a hardware person maybe i
128:56 - can give it a try but if you're out
128:58 - there you know somebody who's out there
129:00 - who can help me restore this
129:02 - um
129:03 - yeah especially if you're in the new
129:05 - york area within like a
129:08 - three or four hour drive of like
129:09 - poughkeepsie like please come over
129:13 - get me up come over
129:14 - like very soon because i need to i'm
129:16 - planning to use this for a project later
129:18 - this month but anyway maybe i'll have to
129:20 - postpone that we'll see
129:21 - um
129:22 - but i would like to hear from you
129:24 - uh
129:25 - all right um coming back over here i i
129:28 - can't i can't go
129:30 - uh
129:33 - hi nicole uh
129:35 -  my shader expert nicole i see you
129:37 - in the chat
129:38 - uh lifelong learner thank you
129:41 - um i'm sorry i'm read this chat is fun
129:44 - to read sometimes uh hcf an amazing team
129:47 - of drama yeah somebody was telling me
129:49 - actually on the podcast
129:51 - um
129:52 - the show devs was recommended to me and
129:55 - in fact maybe related to
129:57 - [Music]
129:59 - some of the um
130:00 - themes
130:01 - that are also in severance so
130:04 - anyway
130:05 - the severance community on twitter it's
130:07 - it's popping
130:10 - come and say hello there
130:12 - uh there are youtubers who do those
130:14 - fixes yeah uh seb can i get seb lee
130:17 - delisle to fly fly in from the uk
130:21 - somebody asked um to give you some help
130:24 - like seb is always was restoring
130:26 - something yesterday on his channel um
130:28 - adrian's digital basement okay
130:31 - thank you i'm gonna need all of these
130:33 - told to me again
130:37 - this scientific american
130:39 - at least did not catch on fire
130:41 - all right let's ah all right so
130:44 - we looked at the apple plus
130:45 - i talked about the survey i talked about
130:48 - my obsession with the show severance and
130:50 - macro data refinement here's a question
130:52 - for you
130:54 - what would you think
130:56 - and i probably shouldn't do this because
130:58 - it'll take an enormous amount of time
130:59 - away from other things that maybe are i
131:01 - should be spending my time on
131:03 - but if i did something that was like a
131:05 - video essay style
131:07 - short 10 minute video
131:10 - maybe narrating um kind of describing
131:13 - some of the technology or this you know
131:15 - science fiction technology that's in the
131:17 - show severance and giving some sort of
131:19 - thoughts and opinions about what's what
131:22 - could be real what wouldn't be real
131:24 - um
131:26 - how it might work
131:27 - um it's not the kind of video i make on
131:30 - the coding train at all would that be of
131:32 - interest
131:34 - let me know
131:36 - and then silicon valley yeah i don't i
131:39 - never got into that um
131:41 - but um i could give that a try for sure
131:44 - um
131:46 - ah all right and then here's what i want
131:48 - to
131:49 - look
131:50 - at i need
131:57 - to keep tr i need to spin the wheel
131:59 - i need to pick a coding challenge to do
132:01 - next week
132:02 - because i i got to get back to that
132:05 - so i've already forgotten
132:08 - how in the world
132:10 - where in the world this list that i'm
132:12 - keeping is
132:14 - but
132:21 - let's see if i can find it
132:23 - um
132:26 - desktop backup okay
132:34 - i think this should give me to me
132:38 - okay
132:40 - all right
132:44 - uh
132:48 - okay
132:50 - this would be appropriate right
132:52 - to do as a coding chat oh you don't see
132:53 - the screen i'm sorry everybody
132:56 - um sorry everybody
133:00 - um
133:05 - uh
133:10 - this is my list of things i had some
133:12 - things that i wanted to add to it
133:14 - and i'm waiting for the chat to catch up
133:15 - to me
133:17 - so let's see what do what's
133:19 - what have i already done
133:21 - i did the mandelbulb
133:23 - remove
133:25 - i did the ulam spiral
133:28 - remove
133:33 - did the n-body problem
133:36 - remove
133:40 - now people have been giving me some
133:41 - really good ideas
133:44 - and i would like to add to them let me
133:45 - just do a little screenshot of this
133:51 - but i don't have an easy way to edit and
133:54 - add things to this app that i created
133:56 - so let's just let's just keep this as my
133:58 - list right now
134:02 - um
134:04 - let's let's
134:06 - let's keep this as my list
134:08 - let's spin it
134:11 - and see what we get some of these i
134:12 - don't feel so great about
134:14 - others i would be thrilled if it landed
134:16 - on
134:17 - and there were some really good ideas
134:19 - that people have been suggesting
134:20 - recently and i'm not doing a good job of
134:21 - keeping track of them let's just
134:24 - um i think one of my uh things i really
134:28 - like to develop
134:29 - in
134:33 - dream to do
134:35 - as simon will tell you
134:38 - anytime i make one of these markdown
134:39 - files there's a list of something i
134:41 - never go back to it
134:43 - um but i do feel like
134:45 - there were some really uh
134:49 - there were some good ones recently
134:53 - that i wanted to
134:56 - work work on
134:58 - but
134:59 - i guess
135:01 - i'm just gonna spin this let's just do
135:02 - it
135:05 - all
135:06 - right
135:08 - let's just do it wave function collapse
135:10 - algorithm that is what i'm rooting for
135:12 - if i'm being honest with you this is
135:14 - what i'm rooting for
135:20 - i'm spinning it i'm gonna stop it
135:24 - i don't think i have a drum roll here
135:25 - yes i do
135:29 - let's see what we get
135:32 - so i have a lot of videos doing neat
135:35 - like algorithms oh these are bo i'm okay
135:37 - k means
135:39 - image stippling would be i'm fine oh
135:40 - come on wave collapse function you're so
135:42 - close
135:47 - nope
135:50 - uh
135:53 - image stippling
135:54 - i'll take it
135:58 - i don't know
136:04 - image stippling it is
136:05 - [Music]
136:13 - thank you all
136:14 - i really appreciate all of you who watch
136:16 - the coding train and support me and and
136:19 - just by watching frankly uh by giving me
136:22 - your feedback
136:23 - um
136:25 - and
136:26 - uh i'm we you could out vote
136:29 - i mean i could put it to a poll it's
136:32 - close
136:37 - uh you know
136:42 - you're obviously
136:45 - the core audience
136:46 - the most dedicated audience
136:49 - of the coding train right now the wheel
136:51 - needs a nudge button
136:54 - uh you know
136:57 - let's put some other i can i do more
136:58 - polls
136:59 - i can only do one poll at a time now i
137:01 - just want to keep doing polls i'll do
137:02 - some twitter polls
137:05 - i really can't believe that the apple ii
137:08 - plus like
137:09 - caught on fire i mean i don't know if
137:10 - caught on fire is too strong
137:14 - i need to eat i didn't eat lunch it's
137:16 - three o'clock my kids are gonna be home
137:17 - from school it's gonna be the weekend
137:18 - it's a beautiful sunny out i should go i
137:20 - should go
137:22 - i've already played the sound effect
137:24 - thank you for watching
137:26 - um i'm going to
137:28 - wow
137:30 - uh you know
137:32 - wave function collapse is just taking it
137:35 - by maybe i shouldn't use a wheel i
137:36 - should just use a pole
137:38 - i could pick a few things that i'm
137:39 - interested in put them in the poll
137:43 - um
137:45 - why why do i need this wheel what does
137:46 - that be picked randomly
137:48 - wave function collapse let's do that
137:50 - next week people it'll be make for a
137:51 - wonderful video
137:53 - um
137:55 - oh great
137:56 - oh simon you are so great
137:59 - simon offered me the list towers of
138:00 - hanoi koningsberg bridge problem ray
138:03 - marching sdf rendering sudoku petrus
138:06 - sokoban
138:08 - all right
138:12 - i'm in the market
138:15 - for
138:16 - a web application i mean i should make
138:19 - this myself i should just do a stream
138:20 - where i make it
138:23 - where web applications will help me keep
138:24 - track of this stuff but until then
138:28 - thank you so much
138:31 - i appreciate all of you
138:33 - i hope you enjoyed
138:35 - this
138:36 - the smell is quite strong
138:38 - i'm gonna clean this up and put it to
138:40 - the side
138:43 - um let's put this camera back like where
138:45 - it normally this would be the whiteboard
138:47 - shot
138:48 - and uh i'm gonna put the camera back
138:50 - just back to sort of more of a wide shot
138:56 - um and so
138:59 - uh i hope i hope you enjoyed today's
139:01 - stream
139:02 - um you can follow me on twitter at
139:05 - shiffman
139:06 - um
139:07 - you can check me out on episode 8 of the
139:10 - post show recaps
139:12 - severance feedback show but don't listen
139:15 - to that episode listen to all the other
139:16 - ones
139:18 - nothing would make me happier than
139:19 - people being like oh i found the second
139:22 - podcast from the coding train and those
139:24 - communities colliding in some way i
139:26 - don't know
139:27 - um
139:32 - um
139:33 - next week i'll be back with some live
139:34 - streams
139:36 - uh and more content making some videos
139:40 - um and i hope to continue to be here
139:44 - with all of you on the internet
139:46 - in the way that i am now
139:49 - [Music]
139:51 - wherever

140:38 - [Music]
140:42 - help
140:47 - thank you
140:51 - you're a new passenger on the coding
140:53 - trade
140:54 - i don't have my train whistle it's in a
140:56 - box somewhere
140:58 - but i
140:59 - [Music]
141:02 - i appreciate you
141:03 - and welcome

141:35 - join us in the uh member
141:37 - uh channels there a lovely friendly
141:40 - community that will chat with you and
141:42 - answer your code questions
141:45 - this is the musical dance experience
141:47 - you've all been promised
141:49 - and i'll see you all
141:51 - next time on the coding train goodbye
141:57 - is there any music i could possibly play
142:03 - see you next time
142:04 - thank you epidemic sound for the music
142:06 - tracks that i'm playing for you all

Cleaned transcript:

so so so do foreign so hello i am testing my microphone i'm going to get started in just a few minutes let me come over here and say hi i don't know how the balance is between my mic that i'm wearing here as well as um the music that's playing but the music is going to go off soon this is a new i'm in a new studio that's the same studio just did some renovations in here i streamed on twitch earlier this week so some of you might have caught that if you didn't though this is the first uh youtube stream i've got a little setup here that i'm gonna work on today we'll see how it goes but i'll talk about that in a minute i'm still getting set up let me just come over here oh do do all right hello everyone uh welcome to a uh coding train live stream ah where is i have all new equipment and new things oh and i forgot to even turn this light on uh i'm using some new fancy uh echo reduction and noise suppression technology which is hopefully making my audio come in loud and clear to you i see some familiar names in the chat of people that i know either in person or online or through the internet and it's just delightful and wonderful to see all of you it makes me so happy i think this is the button i press to fade out that sound so this is a bit of an unusual stream uh mostly to do with this setup that i have over here which is uh i was saying in the coding train discord earlier that it might turn into a sort of like al capone's vault reveal because i have my childhood computer boxed up in boxes around this room uh 19 i don't actually don't know the exact year probably 1982 apple ii plus computer i'm going to attempt to plug all the pieces together and turn it on i have other things i could do if that totally doesn't work but that's my plan for today uh if you are a new viewer uh welcome this is the coding train it is uh what i would like to say is a regular weekly live stream on a youtube thing where there are also uh many different sequenced video tutorials that you could follow along if you've never coded before and would like to learn to code there are also some project videos called coding challenges that are kind of standalone projects that you could follow along and maybe make a creative project be inspired to make a creative project from most of those probably re no i don't say require but uh if you've never coded before you'll want to watch the start learning here i should show you all this because i have a whole computer and everything but anyway i'm just talking how are you all doing how was your friday there was a big storm last night i'm in the hudson valley up uh now i don't know if it really counts as upstate but uh in between new york city and the top of new york state is where i am uh it was a huge storm last night uh trees were flailing and branches were flying the power went off the power went on so i was wondering if the internet and the power would comply today um but it seems like it is i feel like there are important announcements and things i should talk about but i kind of just want to get started um and let me just take i'm just going to take a quick peek at the chat to see if there's any important questions is this the garage yes so i have i'm in a garage it's wonderful to have a space that i i've never had my own space like this before we'll see uh how long it lasts but it's been pretty great um yeah i could talk forever about that but that's where i am i'm going to hopefully do a little bit of a um studio tour kind of video or documentation at some point it's been a while since i've done one of those uh ten print high yeah um uh um let's look at it fasten your seat belt yeah um i uh anand says i fall in love with coding six months ago um it's never too late you know i i mean i didn't start coding well this is good this is appropriate for me to talk about actually so i'm going to come over here uh first of all before i before i start working on the computer i want to show you something i showed this on my twitch stream earlier this week but i have to bring it up again this is uh um a 1964 copy of scientific american uh i did a video coding challenge about this particular prime number pattern often referred to as the prime spiral or the ulam spiral i did not have this magazine but the original when i did the video but i went and ordered it did you know you can order basically any scientific american magazine from the past just just deliver it right to your door i think it was like 20 bucks i mean that's my hardearned coding train adsense money there this is where it's going to people um i mean it's you know we'll talk yeah so many things to talk about let me find this though because um the article i also want to get the one that martin gardner who is an author uh who wrote many different articles about different mathematical uh things um here is the page uh about the cover and then it's going to say page 122. so i want to find the article i really should have i should get my overhead camera set up so i could show you this more um specifically but here uh with a sort of better actually you know what i think if i come over here strangely enough uh whoops wrong button i think this will actually be a better view of this i'm so look over here and see oh it's way too bright but um you can see um the uh article about mathematical games the remarkable lore of prime numbers i'll just read a little bit of this to you from scientific americans 1964 issue march 60 cents for this thing i mean boy that's appreciated well i think i spent 20 bucks on this uh the remarkable lore of prime numbers by martin gardner no branch of number theory is more saturated with mystery and elegance than the study of prime numbers those exasperating unruly integers that refuse to be divided evenly by any integers except themselves and one some problems concerning primes are so simple that a child could understand them and yet so deep and far from solved that many mathematicians now suspect they have no solution perhaps they're undecidable perhaps number theory like quantum mechanics has its own uncertainty principle that makes it necessary in certain areas to abandon exactness for probabilistic formulations okay i could read this all day the other thing that's really amazing about this are the ads uh let's see i think if i i i clearly this is a new setup for me so i haven't really worked this out but um we can come over here and see let's see ah there we go look at these ads uh the remarkable um digital guidance computers use titan ii and titan three nasa saturn one from ibm here two more from hoffman's complete line of cryogenic equipment did you know that the coding train is sponsored by hoffman laboratories inc the complete line of cryogenic equipment no lost transfer hoses flexible sturdy made of highstrength bronze transfers liquid oxygen nitrogen okay okay you get the idea um all right so i wanted to show that to you um i'm still in the market if anybody can find one on the internet this will cost quite a bit more of my hardearned uh coding trained funds uh this is a reprint of my favorite book a million random digits with a hundred thousand normal dv it's from the rand corporation anybody out there watching knows where you can i can find an original print please let me know um all right uh hello uh chat folks okay um so let's get this going let's just start because i don't know how this is going to go i don't have a huge amount of time all right so uh somebody in the chat and i've already forgotten had mentioned oh you know i'm just starting to learn to code now is it too late for me or um so first of all i didn't begin uh programming in earnest i would say until i was about 28 or 29 i can't remember the exact date somewhere around there learned to code with macromedia director uh not to be confirmed with uh confused with uh macro data refinement which is another topic we'll see if we get to today uh those of you who know you know um and look at this beautiful rainbow apple by the way can you see that oh i know i'm distracted easily that looks kind of heavy i'm sorry i have the focus but look at that rainbow apple logo come on get get with the program people bring that back um so um i didn't really program until um then and i learned with macro media director i found processing i've sort of talked about this before many a time probably but when i was younger i was into the computer this was actually this computer had my i suppose this button was turned on and off by my probably 10 year old self um my family purchased it i'm guessing i couldn't tell you 1982 would be a good guess i was born in 1973. um and so i did a little bit of basic programming on it in elementary school it wasn't a thing that i spent a lot of time and i sort of did it and then moved on to other things i remember specifically playing a game called monaco gp which i had to load from a tape which i believe there's a box that i have yet to even open so i'm unboxing i my parents i went to visit them i got all the stuff from the attic i brought it here uh just put the monitor here because it's the nicest looking uh piece one of the things that i wanted to show which is really amazing is you know i have some very meticulously organized parents because this is the original box that came in the record of sale like shipping label thing is still encased in the plastic here record of sale award or lease of monochrome monitor as required by federal regulation 21 cfr subchapter j this is model number a3m0039 this card must be filled in duplicate by transformer at the time of sale to final consumer so this is this label here it looks like it was shipped to balanced computer and i realized the focus is not i should probably put on the autofocus balance computer corporation balanced computer center 109 beaver court cockeysville maryland that can only assume that's where this was purchased um and this is the original box look at that all right now for some other equipment that's not in the original box let's go actually there is some equipment that is in the original box but i will i will get to that i have to find it okay where is the box with the computer in it don't tell me i've lost it already oh no i found it okay so let's start with this oh and this table i'm a little bit worried that this table is not big enough i have another table over there um but here we go unfortunately i also can't really see the chat right now you know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna bring this um ipad i have here um and all right so let me just let me just address the severance references because i see that shy 100 so first of all please nobody spoil this wonderful television program for other folks but um i've been kind of really just sort of into recently retro technology i've got a whole bunch of other old computers over there i'll show you a fun one that i just bought off of ebay not too long ago um quite a bit more modern than that one this is uh this is i don't know at one point this was a property of auburn university at montgomery but this is a one of those old apple clam shell computers but um uh this the severance tv show which is a show that i've been really enjoying i was on a podcast you can check that out i'll put a link to it and stuff like that about it um it's uh they use all these um older props which i um are i think data general computers i can pull it up on my laptop later to show you um which are dumb terminals um they're not dumb terminals it's kind of i don't i don't love that name for it calling it a dumb terminal but dumb terminals were you know monochrome usually monochrome monitors terminals that didn't have that hooked up to you know before everybody had their own personal computer you had to hook your terminal up to a mainframe so that multiple people could do access that computing power all at once anyway i want to get one of those but all right so uh let's see here um i've got the box here everything is kind of like attached so it's a little bit here's the actual it's falling apart okay you know what um let me just get this other table it's going to make life easier bear with me people um i should have set this up i know you can't see me i have another table here oh you know what i have a folding table let me just grab this folding card table this will be easier there's a toaster let's see this is the very professional uh outfit i'm running here okay all right so it's gonna fit through the door yeah i think so okay all right so i'm bringing another table in here because you need some more room let's put the box on it i will point the camera at it don't you worry oh my god there's a a nickel inside the computer that's not a good sign okay all right so the computer's in here let's try to very very carefully lift it out now it's got a bunch of things attached so i'm going to bring all these things with it this is how it was stored some disk drives and a joystick oh my god okay let's put it over here get rid of the box maybe i'll switch the camera to autofocus and let's put it on this table to the left here so i can have some more space i'm probably going to need a chair and i was meaning to look at the chat which i can kind of see here okay so uh uh i'm gonna come later today if there's time i'm gonna show you this macro data refinement program that i've been using i love working on you can find it on my github if you're looking for a wonderful podcast about the show severance uh check out post show recaps severance podcast uh episode 8 feedback was the one that i was a guest on but um yeah so you can check that out for those who are asking um yeah this joystick is wild right look at this um so let me see here now the next box that i need to get we move these precious things out of the way you can see uh i think the ipad is really ruining the vibe here let me put it back over here um okay now i have another box that i'm gonna get which i have yet to look inside i have no idea what's going to be in here this says first of all i love that this is a washington apples to find the world's finest apples let's do something here so you can see more of what i'm doing i'm going to switch to autofocus which i think will hopefully help things here oops everybody relax i know how to operate this equipment loosen there we go okay there we go this should be good um and now let me do uh continuous autofocus so hopefully that's going to help things okay i believe i'm on no it just says manual focus hold on uh focus mode continuous autofocus there we go okay all right everyone uh let me get this light here a little bit better positioned you can't see me i'm gonna get a chair i don't usually i'm not used to sitting in a chair when i'm streaming i have a little stool maybe i should get the uh this is good this is actually uh uh speaking of it's funny how this chair is for my grandmother bella minnell who is one of the fir first women phd in mathematics you can you can look her up uh bella manel if you uh the nature of code book is dedicated to her um this is kind of fun oh okay great all right so uh next up let's move this to the side let's open this box because i i don't i need to need some power cords and things i'm hoping everything is here okay we're gonna find out what's in the box craft precision joystick patented proven gimbal mechanism switch selectable spring returning centering test it to over 1 million cycles i don't even want to open this look at this beauty look at that still with the bubble wrap on it beautiful is the focus working i don't know if it is i um you know what let's i have multiple lights this light is for my computing setup my laptop setup which i have now just knocked but there's no reason why lift it turn it and make things brighter in front of the camera sorry everybody there we go oh my god life is hard okay don't fall over don't break okay that should help i just gave myself some more light might be too much light yeah now now when i bring things closer to the camera you'll be able to see them better assuming the autofocus works it wants to focus on my face so i think if i put this here all right so we found this joystick i'm not going to use that right now it's going to go over on the table here i'm looking for like a power cord um oh look at this okay this is promising what is this system saver kensington i guess i could sit in a chair i don't know what to do um i got a beep which makes me worry that the um that was somebody in the discord uh um messaging me lighting is dark when you're close to the camera okay i think i think i have that um okay so this is the um system saver line surge suppression filtering of line noise quiet cooling fan dual auxiliary outlets okay that's interesting i think this goes into the back has a fan in it and it goes into the back of the computer i'm sorry that like my face is totally cut off and uh here's the plug so let's put that here we're gonna need that that we're gonna need for sure uh got a box of floppy disks here i'm gonna sit down what is this oh this is like this is this is like some serious um hightech stuff npes database files 592. interesting this is like a proper usb interesting um another joystick this looks like a lock for it computer security products no one's no one's stealing this from me uh i'm just i'm gonna keep my eye on the um discord chat okay no all right sorry that i'm not really let me let me let me bring this ah now i have an idea if i put this here uh i mean you can see it i would prefer that not to show up in the shot not that that really matters put it here okay now i'm able to see the chat okay all right what else some more a lot more floppies uh files apple 2 plus disassembly removed from let's just oh look at this suggested retail price list effective march 1st 1981. so that's maybe a clue as to when this computer was purchased uh oh whoa this was expensive oh oh no no that's the business manager system but still this is a 2000 apple two blue plus system 32 32k ram amazing disc to floppy disk and interface uh two thousand seventy five dollars but also that's like nineteen two thousand seventy five dollars in 1981 which somebody will tell me what uh that is uh you know accounting for inflation um i'm hearing a noise it's probably gloria um okay that's pretty cool to see look at these original discs dos 3.3 system master i mean this has really been well maintained and saved microsoft typing tutor can you survive the snapper the hobbit user's guide this is for like welcome to middle earth this is the world of bilbao the hobbit of thorin and gandalf of dwarves and trolls and wizards this is the magical and mysterious land of j.r.r tokens the hobbit wow um so this must have been a game 19 uh 1985. beagle basic all right this i'm going to need because this is this is what i want to code in nibble the reference for aponal apple computing it's magazine ooh wow um okay software notes these are some files that my super text whoa what is this okay this is some the printer which i also i by the way have the original epson dot matrix printer that this came with so that's coming put that there um what's in this bag it's a bag uh integrated circuits screw look at this there's a little like film canister that says screw for epson fx 80. so this is a screw save for the printer that i'm gonna like and kept in this little bag um okay i can go through more of this stuff later i really want to get the thing on but i the the thing that i need is i need the power oh no i have the power for the monitor i need to figure out what the video out is so i have the power for the computer um oh look at this oh man this is awesome typing tutor this is a cassette tape did you know that you used to load your software onto a computer via cassette 8 micro computer games planet miners 1980 perfect condition okay now the question is do i have the cassette all right this looks like what is this okay somebody tell me what this is i have no idea what this is what are these they're like little dials are these little like controllers this is good for macro data refining wouldn't you think they use a trackball in severance which isn't something you would have found with a 1977 data general d2 computer uh it would have just had a keyboard interface no mouse no trackball for sure um this looks like odd oh video right this has got to be this has got to be the video go this is right is this a video cable this is a video cable it's an analog video cable this is another power cord but i would assume that this is the power cord that goes with it because it's like a whole big box um game paddles like atari 2600 okay uh accounting for inflation says matthew rice the apple ii was around five thousand dollars in today's dollars okay um let's see what else we got here some more discs some notebooks table of contents wow oh my goodness this is amazing i mean my my father kept incredible notes on various things related to the computer um which i would love to go through and sort of like learn everything okay um basic programming reference manual we're gonna need this dos manual we've got the epson users manual the apple soft tutorial the apple ii reference manual okay jackpot everybody jackpot okay uh pro modem oh it's got a 1200 300 baud intelligent modem they can get video term 80 column display okay there's a lot of things in here but i want to get a move on trying to get this thing hooked up this is another like video possibly video cable okay so let's look at the um uh not the apple so i want the apple ii reference manual there we go okay then we're going to need this the apple ii uh reference manual so uh let's let's look at how uh we turn it on the power supply page two approaching your apple chapter one the power supply okay yep main board all right let's take a look here can you see the beauty that's inside this thing main board power supply speaker there is no this oh yeah there's the speaker um so apologies um uh you know i could set up i do have like an overhead camera but let's just see how far i can get just with what the setup i have um the metal box on the left side of the interior is the power supply it supplies four voltages 5 volts negative 5.2 v plus a high frequency okay a photo to the back of okay keyboard talking to your apple your link to your apple is at your fingertips most programs and languages that are used with the apple expect you to talk to them through the apple's keyboard hello hello are you there it looks like a normal typewriter keyboard except for some minor rearrangement and a few special keys for a quick review of the keyboard see pages 6 through 12 in the apple ii basic programming manual since you're talking with your fingers you might as well be hearing with your eyes the apple will tell you what it is doing by displaying letters numbers symbols and sometimes colored blocks and lines on a black and white or color television set but i've got a monitor here let's all right i'm going to unplug these disk drives which are really kind of in my way i think which i believe i can just take these what is this no um so i have these two disk drives drive one drive two um let's leave them plugged in what is going on over here okay let's move stuff i don't need out of the way this joystick is this joystick actually attached right now is that i certainly don't need and that could be a little extra space for me what is this ah this is the video out why is it like this this worries me but i'm assuming this is video out but it is oh but there also is there why is this just loose well okay so we're gonna start by um put the chat on the floor sorry chat you're on the floor now i'm going to start by let's try to clean this up what is this attached to let's clean all these i'm cleaning all these cables up so that it's not so messy these are quite tangled let's see this is these are extra things move these ah look at this this must be the video out okay why what's this cable this is oh my goodness modem found the modem let's unplug that little telephone cord it's all tied up so i'm just trying to unplug some things i know i don't need right now like i don't think i don't have a landline phone so there's not really a way i can make use of that okay um all right phone cord do not need put this off to the side this drive number one this drive number two i don't like the way these cables are tangled i think this is better now let's try to find where untangle this joystick uh okay untangle this joystick yes i can leave it plugged in no harm no foul the joystick is plugged in i could undo it i just want to understand why there's this extra loose kind of video out but and why this is so don't worry about that okay so now oh i see this has been probably tied up to be stored so if i untie it this is there we go just want to remove this which is in my way this is the joystick which is now not plugged in so that's okay leave that to the side and now this must be the video out cable i hope the chat isn't all yelling at me like you're doing it wrong i'm pretty sure i'm doing it right yeah there we go okay now let's plug in ah this is one of no this is just an extra this must be for the printer this must be for the printer this one i'm guessing so let's put that off to the side all right we're ready for the power supply now so this is going to go in here i'm going to check the chat in a second to make sure there's nobody yelling at me like you're about to set everything on fire um okay uh okay i'm just looking at the chat here thank you uh put this off to the side now now this needs to be i need an extension cord again this is going to be very anticlimactic when i can't get anything to turn on or work but that's okay i'll go off and do something else with my day you will too you will too okay all right this actually has quite a bit of uh slack on it uh that light is plugged in through an extension cord let me find another extension cord okay where where where went to my local hardware store bought a couple these are these are uh 2000 circa 2022 era extension cords someday my children will be unpacking a box and be like look at this twoyearold extension core you're like what is this strange macbook pro machine uh all right is this gonna be long enough this is a very short extension cord what was i thinking let's get along is it where's let's get a longer one um i actually have some in a box over here previously here's a really long here this is probably a uh circa i'm guessing 2021 era extension cord much longer very dramatic here as i i made such a mess in this room i just i really shouldn't stream i should just spend my whole day cleaning and in fact that's is all i ever want to do is clean clean up organize can i just do that for the rest of my life i'd be so happy all right now we gotta find a place to plug this in where i won't trip over it where is the nearest power outlet uh not over there all right all right this is not the greatest you know what i'm gonna bring it over here okay uh if everything i'm about to plug this in if everything goes off it's because i've shortcircuited my entire setup and blown several fuses okay it is plugged in it is now plugged in now i would also like to plug in this monitor that i believe the power cord should be able to reach but that's what a short extension cord is for where did i put that short extension cord people it's somewhere around here i had it in my hands a moment ago i walked over here to find a different extension cord oh there it is okay i'm sorry i don't have like a wide shot or anything i should have thought about this more but it it's kind of an impulse stream decided to do this today so now i'm plugging in the monitor this is going to go into hmm i need a three prong okay wait hold on this should okay the light's gonna go off but i don't think that matters uh now this should be able to go plug in like oh my god seriously there we go ah no don't fall over okay there we go the monitor should be plugged in ready everyone i'm gonna turn this and press this button okay it's on i don't see it i don't see anything happening the computer's not on nor is the computer plugged in okay where's the analog video cable that i found i put it somewhere oh it's over here so let's look at the back of this one probably just maybe it just needs to warm up video in okay this is going into the video in now this there's a lot of things like there's this this must be the video out i'm guessing but there's also this video i'm gonna just try this and what's the chance that this thing actually turns on and something shows up here seems very very unlikely i'm going to take a look at the chat just to see if anyone's got any tips for me or important bits of information um okay tetris would be fun okay uh maybe plug in the signal to see the signal i don't know what that means but that sounds like a very smart suggestion am i blocking your view with this it's terrible terrible um put this down here contrast is all the way up oh hilariously the switch is on i didn't check that so let me turn it off that's weird yeah i have i this is what i was expecting would happen nothing and scene thank you for tuning in to today's coding train live stream i'm going to spend all weekend getting this thing to work i'll probably have to repair it and look up read stuff but let's see let's see if i can get any further just even in today ah it would help for this to be on okay let's turn this off this one ah there we go that's something maybe that's the wrong way oh there we go yeah can you see this power light here i don't know if that makes it through oh my goodness it's on can you see that i have to see i've just checked my monitor here on that yeah you can see that all right this is promising now it said the apple wants me to talk to it through the keyboard computer play minecraft it didn't seem to work well this was at least something happened let's play with this contrast yeah look at that wow turn it all the way up all right what do people think do i need what's in these disk drives one drive two reset whoa something changed there what happens if i turn it off and on again what maybe that'll work turn it off and on again look at the chat here uh uh do you have i think people are suggesting uh various other perhaps youtube uh personalities or technology experts who might actually be able to help me get this thing working um what i see on the screen tells me stuff is powered up but i'm not convinced it's doing anything productive check all the boards are seated push the reset key okay press the reset key let's be more aggressive and turn it off and i am going to have to start to check to see if all the boards are in place and what might be needed oh it's definitely trying to load something from this disk oh apple ii it says apple ii do you see that it says apple ii it's a black screen with apple ii at the top and it tried this disk drive went like it wanted to load a disk from it let's see what disks i have like do i need to load dos oh look at this oh my god people this is not my handwriting this is my handwriting i think i think that's my handwriting what autofocus on it pretty sure that's my handwriting but this is definitely my dad's handwriting here um assembler supertext by the way handle like never forget handle like glass don't keep them comfortable don't jam them into our slots so do i try one of these discs just as apple ii there uh holding down control while pressing and releasing reset then releasing control called doing a control reset will send you into applesoft without having to boot a disk okay holding down control while pressing and releasing um reset okay here we go i have a dos prompt keyboard doesn't seem to be connected but no i did control reset that's interesting i've gotten a dos prompt now um yes my father is still with us ask the chat um so let's see what other discs i have that's not a dos product okay excuse me it's been a little it's been about 40 years since i took a look at this these are just blanked as hardball is that a game wave that's my brother's handwriting wavy navy backup what is wavy navy joust side two can you have this is a doublesided disc side one chivalry side two joust oh my god so i really want to get this analog this is going to be the one thing that i'm really thrilled about is this analog video is working so there's no reason why i couldn't get the analog out and pass it you know convert it to hdmi and then pass it into my capture card so i could be at my uh sort of like live streaming the actual display out although it might just be more fun to have a a nice camera trained right on the monitor itself by the coding train is from now on just an apple 2 plus coding channel summer games oh i remember this game i remember this game i feel like i was i would get in trouble for look at this okay i think i drew that this is so weird but kind of delightful i'm sorry that thank you for indulging this bit of nostalgia from me but this here that's my handwriting says summer games and then i think this is me drawing the like olympic torch and those are like the steps up to the torch i think i just remember this game where to run you had to like press the arrow keys back and forth and i feel like i was always like break the computer these two arrow keys here so i think i should try to load a disk but these aren't do these things just boo these aren't bootable right i'm looking for like uh apple tosses thing but key control oh i okay so i want to look for like a boot disk pascal copy a fort fort two side one big mac assembler side two task compiler zoom graphics fort one ascii express beagle basic i remember this is this something that will just look requires apple 2e or 2 or 2 plus with ram card we put this in do this very carefully it's in closed now do i just turn the thing off and on again i hate doing this i don't want to most apple discs have an os on them just put it in and turn it on okay do you hear that i have noise reduction on that doesn't sound good do you hear that i'm putting the mic up to the disk drive i stuck my mic oh i'm typing ah syntax error all right all right wait everybody okay we're somewhere now and um i have so many cameras okay everyone what let's just take a moment here and let me do a little cleanup because i've made a total and my excitement i've made a total mess of this area and i want to clean it up a little bit i can move the camera so that you can see what's on the screen better so i could put some music on or something if you want but i'm probably just going to do this in silence and let me let me just organize this area a bit okay take this box over here because i just started like unboxing everything and going crazy and i just i want to be really careful with all this stuff especially now that it is i mean this now that it's working so i'm just off to the side talk amongst yourselves and i'm just going to move things that i'm not using i mean i think it would be nice to actually set this up properly the whole point is that this goes over it so let's see if i can get that let's see if i can make this work um type catalog okay i can't resist where's the where's the delete button ah not reset how do i go back there's no delete oh arrow no why am i typing data you said catalog catalog whoa the the some of these the c is not working the c is not working that's a bad oh no i got to work just had to bang on it a few times t a l o come on o come on o needs to wake up there just used to wake up g i think that sound is awful i owe error okay let me keep organizing myself here because i think everyone's going to be happier including myself if i can just get this set up in a way that it doesn't look so messy and that everybody can see it better and enjoy uh enjoy uh helping me along to try to get this thing going it's 1 30. i also i i as much as i would love to do this all day i don't know how realistic that is so this is probably going to wrap up relatively soon but this is only the beginning my friends only the beginning let me tell you okay uh this looks like i brought my lunch with me this is like this is like a 40 year old brown paper bag unbelievable it could be older than that uh this this is extraordinary finding these uh cassette tape games because i remember we would wait like 20 minutes to load these like let's play the game okay let's put the set in 20 minutes later um so again i need to set up a whole shelf system but i'm going to go through these discs so we can try some other ones but let's try to get this actually set up in a way now those of you watching i'm so kind of used to the idea that i can just turn off a computer and turn it back on as often as i like is there an issue with me doing that like should i be typing in some command like turn off i don't think that's the right command um let me move these oh i made myself this lovely coffee and i didn't even open it okay um move these things so i'm gonna put the put the top on let me just check if anybody's saying anything in the chat maybe you should type run before catalog to load the embedded dos no just turn it off you can turn the apple on and off with the switch this was before shutdown so yeah that's how i feel too okay so i'm gonna turn it off i'm gonna unplug it i feel like i need two disk drives but i guess i have them i would like now i'm gonna unplug the video cord come on put these on top this here this out of the way temporarily side looking good looking good everybody everybody okay you all doing all right over there that goes there this goes here slide it out a little bit there we go now this is okay you know what's amazing about this that fan which is blowing lovely cool air here all of my here a bunch of disks i will put here this card table and now okay just a little there we go everything's fine it's gonna go back out of the way now i have this stool here with adjustable height so i can sit here now let's figure out what i'm going to do with this camera so it is plugged into a lot of things but i'm going to attempt to move it here give you all a good shot there we go this looks promising and then if i sit here i could talk to you about my apple 2 plus computer look at this it's like i professionally designed the studio to work like this although i'm in front of some of the most beautiful parts okay so we need to plug things back in again so this has to put this on top of the disk drive that's what i would like to do and then this goes oh where's the plug there i don't know what i'm showing you right now my the back of my sweater so come on where are you okay i'm gonna have to just pull this table out so i can see the back for a second here this gets plugged in here okay that's plugged in i'm very surprised that i actually even got anything working today and then now i need the video cable the analog video cable which is coming out of the monitor here one angled up there we go and this goes into this okay now one question i have is can i just leave this i wonder if i can leave the switch on on the back of the computer and use this as my switch to turn the computer on we're gonna find out okay the monitor is on there's a disk in here beagle brothers dos and i'm going to turn it on apple ii how's your view of this let me get my the chat over here the fan hangs on the back yeah i think that's right but i don't i'm not really set up to easily attach stuff right now okay i can see the chat on the side it's supposed to go through the slots on the side of the apple but you could hang on the stand seems like it's not the worst thing to have it right here although i guess what i could do this light is a little bit in the way i can move everything over and there's plenty of room for them both to have their own little spot okay auto start rom was introduced by apple 2 plus in 1978 so turn on the computer with a bootable floppy inside rom will scan port to find 0x80 bootable sequence okay um can't you plug the monitor into the system saver and then they would both turn on at the same time ah great point i could do that um all right the view is good says everybody um but i'm not seeing anything um okay so let me look through the stack of floppy disks gorgon pacman and other games well let's try these one at a time olympic decathlon let's try this ah okay look at this look at this backup copy games disk volume 254. hello pacman gorg start star castle a rescue hood roll what do i do run this keyboard needs ah i don't where here start over run ah no two ends ugh run space come on space come on space bar can i just do this yeah okay run low shoot oh so close so sad b run i return oh wait wait okay file not found shoot h e l l o air duster to clean the keyboard contacts so i should go to the hardware i don't have one i'm going to go to the hardware store definitely you're absolutely right i need that b run so i need b run like basic run oh there we go okay so run hello reloads this uh prompt so do we think i need to say b run let's just try run with pacman come on p come on p it needs to be cleaned okay p a c dash m a n b run only for binary like a gorgon yeah so for the things that are b like that's binary so i probably need a b run for pacman let's see file type mismatch yep b run ah there's no way the space doesn't work b b b r u n ah that n key always gets me each time yeah i know it's not found b b b r u okay everybody one n we're gonna get one n i'm gonna i've got my magic quick fingers and i am going to just get this one in i be run p p a c dash m a n come on come on return there we go i think it's running pacman people loading where is the loading bar and animation i want to know i'm worried this light's gonna fall off but i think it's okay uh hook up the usb keyboard yeah i might need to do that to be honest at some point um i'd have to figure out how to do that okay the light of the disk drive went off but nothing is happening what do we think is going to happen uh people want me to zoom in i do not have a zoom lens but i could absolutely bring it closer there's a usb adapter you could buy the disc was making noise but it stopped and i am just left with nothing let me bring the camera in a bit closer for those of you who are asking for that my face is very loved um okay so try another one yep let's try another one so off goes the computer uh i mean i could have tried a different program but let's just try a different disc i mean i kind of want to work with beagle basic big mac assembler daniel schiff oh yeah so this is my science project so i did a science project in like fourth grade uh which was about i remember i don't really remember exactly it said summer it said summer games on it and then it's crossed out then it says daniel shiffman typing tutor perception because i made a program well let's see if this i remember writing a program in basic that was like doing an experiment around people's perception so we're putting this in we're turning it on apple ii okay look at this typing tutor start typing tutor hello perception.c this is amazing to me i don't know di can i like catalog can i just do like yeah so catalog will give me what's on the disk can you i wish i should i'm going to turn the noise suppression off it'll be very echoy here but i feel like you want to hear the hear the disk drive whirring but um all right so how can i look at i want to type cat like where's the dot this is i assume this is like apple dos right so there must be a thing for i must be able to look at that perception.c file somehow like i would type cat and then i'd hit start typing p and then i'd hit tab the bar doesn't work good thing the right arrow does this is not going to work that's why i couldn't can't even type anything close to what's right syntax error um fortran c yeah uh print list plus print your text catalog if i type catalog and then the name of the file it'll list it i don't know who this 8bit person is that everyone's referring to but i'll have to n key the return key seems to work one out of every maybe like three or four times syntax error list then list load load file name thanks everybody the sound of the keyboard is just lovely come on period oops no don't do another one okay i loaded it then lift nano yeah these numbers are scary that's for sure i really wish the return key would work a bit better look there's my program oh look at that that's code that i wrote like fourth grade i mean i think i wrote it i i mean i'm sure i had help i i have no memory i mean i have a memory of it a loose memory get s i print s i incorrect go to 180 print press any key so how do i run this oh i'm running at what level i don't what is this program that i wrote this is crazy okay what level one okay what did i see i didn't see anything it was too fast i saw i'll just make a guess zero nope i think there's a bug everybody there's a bug in my code control c there's no reset escape this isn't the fi the fire department's not going to come this isn't like directly wired to like some emergency line i guess i've just turned off the computer now uh yeah i can refactor i guess i'm just have to turn this off well that was fun another disc to look at she's going through these i really want to look at this beagle basic but um i guess i'll come back to that see what else ascii express super text 1989 super text files what is super school backup i'm a little bit afraid to look at that yeah look at this this is my weird childhood cursive handwriting i'm pretty sure um daniel schiffman december 4th 1982 i would be nine years old then i believe v30 let's see what's on this there we go daniel schiffman december 4th 1982 press return to go on this is like some real stranger thing style weird i think i inhaled a lot of dust hopefully i'll be okay file not found break in 90. this must be some other i need to get some water tunnels of terror sound effects ronald reagan's space odyssey apple vision viper dice typing tutor whoa windshield wiper so a lot of the perception which is dance the entertainer what the oh strange what are all these files load dice okay this looks like a program that let's see if we can understand this can you can you read the text it's hard for me to see yeah it looks like you can i'm looking at a preview okay print one two three four five six four i equals one to one hundred go sub 500 so for a hundred times go to 500 which pits picks makes a variable d which is the integer version of six times random of one plus one boy this surprisingly it looks like code that we would write right now um return so then they go back return so go sub tells you to go down here then you hit return we come back here n d equals nd plus one now what is all this doing oh this is this must be v tab three h tab six this is like setting a spot on the monitor let's run it it did i make this this is wild it's rolling a die a virtual die 100 times and keeping track of how many times it rolled each number it rolled the 5 23 times should be able to understand this now yeah look at this this is this is this is like the greatest day of my life [Laughter] uh i'm reading the chat now which is kind of fun it's a delay so i understand this is picking the right random number then n but where is n initialized like where did i allocate the memory for n does it just happen automatically like this is like oh we're gonna make an array with index one two three four five or this like is that a function that's like count so uh i need my computer to look up basic here and try to understand i want to write i mean like i mean i want to i want to write this code again and like learn how to do it i think some more names in the chat that i recognize how do i edit it no don't fall off my chair here you don't need to allocate small arrays says copper france wow this is quite amazing variables are dynamically allocated and initialized to zero it's basic don't worry about memory allocation yeah so how do i edit this i want to run it again it's too much fun see the pseudo random number generator those add up to 100 right 42 52 54 64 68 78 84 100 yep edit by typing a number and replacing that line of code retype a whole line oh okay okay let's see so where is the delay uh oh let's try okay let's try this for i equal shift key is a problem so i think one of the things i'm going to need to do is get um an air compressor to clean this i mean i would love to be typing on it directly but i could also probably get a different keyboard and kind of hook it up somehow i'm never going to get that equals is there a caps lock both shifts yeah no all right so this line how do i cancel now i don't want to mess with this line let's do this um for uh yeah yeah there is no delay basic on a one megahertz machine is just slow try the other shift key i certainly did all right um v tab four let's just try changing that 132 v tap v stupid the space and the shift are oh good how do i what is rept this this is very frustrating try one more time one three two v t a b b d b space so let's try v tab eight now let's list oh i edited it my code change let's be tab eight and i can run it now look it's down here now i wrote some new basic code today on an apple two plus computer is that what you thought you'd be seeing today live on youtube okay a working keyboard would make for a nice start yeah our ept goes repeat the keys do not auto repeat um uh line 500 is a function um okay all right let's um let's see what else we got on this computing machine anybody want to see what ronald reagan space odyssey is my goodness what is that draw a pencil we gotta look at what draw a pencil is tunnels of terror sound effects dice is what we're just looking at help apple vision star destroyer anybody had any requests let's look at um let's see what music is remember to git commit says ronyettes okay i think the keyboard is kind of loosening up here all right what what what okay select from the following list play piece on disk enter new piece exit from program let's try one okay i'm going to load the entertainer must have been music right enter name of peace from the list below the space enter tay there's a speaker in it bum it's going again is it gonna stop or am i gonna have to turn the computer off all right enter a new piece let's try that how many beats per minute people 120 select major key signature all right how about c do you want instructions no i don't need instructions i'm sorry but you're going to have to pause a little bit faster enter the value of the note or rest w is whole note you know it's amazing how little patience i think i have i have just like developed the quick gratification like instant gratification internet like click use way of being and this is like driving me crazy like i can't possibly read all these instructions and slowly figure out how to interact with this but i can um enter the type of note apple will then play the note the note is correct play return okay any key to continue what's a key that i know tends to work there we go good luck enter section one ah oh i love that i'm trying to enter like a deer a female deer i'm assuming x means i'm done how do i get out of this you can't hear it have you not been able to hit the music is my is my uh mic off or just like you can't hear the sound uh yeah all right um i don't think i've had to type in x yet i don't know how to get out of this i guess we'll be turning this computer off you hear a tiny bit remove the noise suppression okay let me go shut that off people one second okay the noise removal and room echo removal is off now so and let's see it's quite loud so i think you can hear that now i bet right control c exits a basic program let's try so i just don't know whether like the shift wasn't working so i have a bad feeling that control probably isn't working did you did you hear the entertainer did you not hear the entertainer i got to play you the entertainer all right i think i'm gonna have to just reboot this machine use bye i don't think that's gonna work escape control c all right i'm gonna have to just power this off control reset i guess i could have tried that um all right let's move on to another disc though i mean all right let's see what else we got here side one volume 31 comp let's see what this is school backup all right let's look at this disc every floppy disk is like a little basket of surprises oh it's two o'clock i'm gonna have to go soon i would say by the way you were saying bye and like my mind was just like thinking about that as a key sequence and uh now i realize it's spell spy uh lesson five lesson eight lesson nine flying saucers ski trek the guesses design the experiment comp so we look at what lesson five is oh there's like a little menu here how do i go down oh look at this this disc has like a nice little menu loaded with a menu so let's go to lesson five run what is your name do you have a computer uh apple two hold on print what is your name input t do you have a computer a print t why did it not stop at that so let's see yeah okay do you have a computer dan what kind um i don't know uh iphone you heard it here first coding trade audience the iphone is a good computer all right i think this is going to work so by the way i have a project i want to do with this computer um there's a streaming service called nebula that i participate in and i'm going to work on some videos for it i'll be doing stuff for the coding train with it as well but um this is a good start um so i think now how can i write let's try writing a new program um how do i create something new ah there's nothing okay so 10 home 20 print oh shoot i really wish the space bar would work will it oh and the shift doesn't work yeah i think my desire to oh wait i got a quote i got that quote can i get it back frustrated uh there's my program which is definitely not gonna work oh didn't need the quotes create file name okay hit the any key hold on i must be able to do save right oops is it trying to write on the disk bang on the shift key not the two key that's a good point okay what did it save it as lesson 24 calories what is that the experiment conversation hebrew quote camera mix smoke research perception b perception 3 george space space 2 what are all these things and where did it save it save choo choo okay oops um is it going to be what did i call it choo choo anybody see it and there it is that's the new computer program i wrote today is it still loaded okay 10 10 print chew is it gonna just let me do it without the quotes no oh that was whoops i overwrote the wrong line oh there we go look at my basic program that i have written everybody oh i just knocked the camera it's all right let's run it here we go okay um i don't know if there's any moderators looks like there's some nonsense coming into the chat am i able to moderate myself from the ipad doesn't look like it that's annoying all right let's try i i gotta get going here um and this uh my ipad that i'm monitoring the chat on only has six percent uh batteries left um thank you mia oh me i am samia's there um so uh yeah next stream is exactly definitely what i'm going to do michael kemp uh append choo choo all right do a ten do ten print okay fernando all right fernando you had the best idea ever okay 10 home homer so now 20 can i do a equals the shift is working now people r and d shoot one or can i do like r and d two 30 print a okay ah look at that it gives me a floating point random number so now we need to change that to change that to oh just have to uh 20 a equals equals r and d shoot equals rnd i think it can't give it an argument i assume it's just a function times a 2 which should give me a 0 or a 1. oops uhoh syntax error oh i have to type retype the whole thing does it need an argument or is the is this not right okay here we go now can i do an if like what's an if in basic i don't see a backslash i only see a forward slash it's gonna be a problem uh also that key doesn't work let's just do that it's going to be a variation on 10 print are there no if statements in basic uh well i'm getting a lot of good comments here um oh i need to change it to an int yeah and let's just see let's just at least see if i can do so if i want to add a line i could do 15 and i could say 4i how do i do a loop 4 i what's the chance that's right no i think you need it then oh then did you all hear that that was a very bad sound and there's smoke i'd shut it off oh this is bad okay let's unplug everything safety first people oh no this is the one and only time i'm ever gonna get to do this unplugged everything oh it's a bad smell i'm gonna open a window over here let's back the camera up people i'm sure someone's gonna clip that little moment there the thing is everything was i don't know what what started to um i'm hoping it's just the power supply that's a that can be remedied this was fun while it lasted let's move this over here okay um that smell is awful i think it's i the it's the power supply oh it's still smoking okay i'm going to examine this later on my own time i'm going to first unplug this from the extension cord i wonder i mean i don't feel still smoking it doesn't feel super hot maybe switch to an apple ii emulator yeah um all right uh let me just come back over here for a moment um that was a little bit uh freaky uh oop here i am all right uh the light is not on me right now so it's a little bit dark um i'm very sad it was fun while it lasted oh that smell is terrible just looking at the chat um okay all right everyone i don't know if there's still people here watching i think i'm gonna call it a day but i've got a few things maybe that i can briefly mention or discuss let's turn to reset up the setup again at least get the lighting back the way it's supposed to be okay sorry everyone i'm okay um whoa that smell i cannot tell you how strong it is i mean it's like burning rubber or something um all right so uh thank you all for tuning in to today's live stream i'm not entirely sure what the purpose of it was i was having a grand old time until i heard that sound and started to see smoke on that apple two plus computer i hope this is not the only time that i am ever able to uh work with this machine or stream from it or so i'm gonna work on giving it a permanent home somewhere and kind of investigate it in more detail in my own time if anybody is watching happens to be an expert or have some tips for me or wants to put me in touch with someone that could help me restore the computer to its former glory i would love to hear that um psu capacitor pops you can purchase replacements says robbie in the chat hi robbie all right that's great to know some money from galvey to go to a recap service on my apple ii plus tends to be a lot of plastic in those old things so i can imagine the smell smell says eric typical apple device all right so i just want to briefly since i'm here and there are some small number of you watching i couldn't tell you how many um um i just want to briefly mention um um thank you chris uh get it recapped professionally what does what does that mean exactly uh because by golly i would love to have a professional come and restore this machine um but um i guess so while i'm here um i might as well mention this sort of goofy project that i'm working on related to the well it's related to the television show severance but the way i was putting that sounded like like i have some official thing that i'm doing which i don't at all um let's get going here and uh let's show you up the at the computer and i i'm a little bit brain dead right now i'm going to go to github.com lumen industries so um i'm just just a massive fan of the show which had the finale last night um and uh so first of all if you're i'm not gonna spoil anything from it please chat uh be on your best behavior um i would um so but i am gonna show this little project which is based on a piece of software that runs in the show with uh on one of these computers i don't think they're actually using one of these computers it's a prop um data general dasher d2 not a t200 so um i showed this on twitch earlier this week but so this is the computer that uh i believe is in the show um and i'm not going to search um uh but like i think if i search like macro data refinement and do like an image search you'll see there's this um there's this software that the characters of the show are working with so i've been slowly over time building my own version of this software um and i'm going to show it to you now uh if you go and i was going to work on it today but i've run out of steam so if people are really interested in this tweet at me at shiffman uh and are like i'm gonna talk join the coding train discord i'll i'll talk about how you can get involved if you're interested in helping with this so this is the github repository for this project um if i go here and click on lumenindustries.com um you'll see this is my version actually somebody submitted a pull request adjusting the colors of it which was really good but it has some um has some issues with it so basically the idea here is that i need to find the scary numbers and bin them properly and then and i'm going to do a little hack here which is that if i just go into the console and overwrite the goal variable and set it to ten oh first of all it's gonna set me at 75 percent immediately benjamin durgo came for the and now i'm at a hundred percent so this is what i'm most proud of i created this share button which when you click it it copies your the address of the data that you just refined and a little message that you can share on social media so if i go to twitter.com mdr lumen um you can see here people are posting their data that they refined a la wordle and nothing is bringing me more happiness than seeing this right now but it needs a lot more work and guess what severance was renewed for a season two i don't know what i'm going to do for the next year i'm going to work on this i'm going to get back to coding train tutorials and things i would love especially if any of you are fans of the show to participate we can create a channel in the coding train discord i've been tracking um issues of things that i want to add to it here uh the ver the kind of first thing that i think i'd really like to do which i think would be quick is include the amount of time it took to refine the data um so that at least when you're posting a report to twitter it's a little bit more like it took you one minute 30 seconds i'm sure there's some clever language we could come up with um there are also uh there's an ebook that the apple tv put out and that you can find which has like these are the actual rewards you're supposed to get at ten percent twentyfive percent seventyfive i have the seventyfive percent i mean that could be improved and 100 reward so um if any of you are interested in helping to develop this piece of software um by the way i'm just curious i'm gonna i know i'm he's changing subjects every five seconds here but i'm going to just quickly turn on the um noise removal uh and just sort of see i just quickly turn that on and i'm just curious if the sound i mean obviously when i was working with the apple ii plus we wanted to hear those noises but is the sound better worse the same i'm just curious to hear from you so i've been sort of tracking issues and things this is the pull request that um somebody graciously added but it has some conflicts in it i think uh adjusting the colors oh i would love to put in a um um i'd love to put in a like um i bet you we could do like a crt shader filter on the canvas that's probably something that i could learn how to do right just adding just adding issues i don't know does anybody have any questions about this any interest in it um i would love to hear from you um i also want to give a plug since i'm uh a plug here oh god that smell i'm very sensitive to certain kinds of smells like a bleach smell i can't be in the room get very sick and the smell is having that effect on me which i think is why i'm really struggling to continue this stream so sound is way better with the noise removal and the echo is completely gone yeah um yeah it actually and i only put it on 75 so this is using um my graphics card on this streaming machine the nvidia rtx broadcast software i mean i should sound treat the room that would be the proper way to do it but um i'm just curious uh i could i'm just also curious like while i'm here to turn it way up like um like i'm gonna turn it uh all the way up now i did open the door uh the thing about the garage fishy in the chat and thank you fishy uh fishy has created uh more uh this wonderful i don't um uh uh has been working on here it is has been working on a visualization for um what happens when you reach 100 for this little like animated sequence that happens in the show um so this is a fun uh based off of i think the pearl and noise terrain so there's a lot of potential there um so i'm going to turn it all the way up i'm just curious so now i'm at a hundred percent of noise removal and echo uh removal i'm just curious if better or worse i mean it's like you're at the eye doctor now um so anyway there's lots of things on this list i uh would love any contributions anybody wants to work on this with me uh i mean i do need to put this to the side and like kind of get back to some things i've totally made a mess of this room i don't know why i'm feeling so discouraged all of a sudden but uh using an ai filter on the graphics card is more on brand than physically sound which is very true thank you chris so um yeah so i guess i could keep talking about this i could come back and do another stream about it and like sort of work on this more if there's interest you can check let me just ah if you're really interested in this i'm sorry i will tell you what to do if you go to the youtube channel called coding train twitch archive um this is where i uh archive any streams that i'm doing on twitch and write so many important things to mention okay okay important coding train news announcements i i i kind of was setting up a new sound board that's an interesting noise bumper that i don't have all these bumpers from old times um okay what is this okay sorry sorry having fun over here all right um okay uh what was i going to say yes all right announcements there is a survey let's see if we can find it on uh on uh it's been shared via coding train social media ah yes here we go here it is thank you everyone has filled out the survey we are expecting it we are extending the deadline to april 4th ah that deadline is officially today april 8th today is the la i mean you can fill out the survey after the deadline but i need to next week i will i mean i was going to do it today is there a way i could do it today i'm going to figure out how to do this live without giving out any of these information but i want to i'll document somehow how we are picking the the uh to send the stickers but this is a survey just for feedback i'm kind of planning the rest of the year thinking about what i want to do one of the items on the survey is whether you prefer to watch live streams on youtube or twitch i can tell you right now spoiler alert the overwhelming response is about 75 25 on youtube but that's mostly because i've been posting the survey through check through various um uh channels i'm not a communication channels that are people are finding because they know about the youtube channel so i'm a little worried it's heavily biased there so again i said this on twitch earlier i don't want to put my thumb on the scale but if you're excited about um kind of bouncing a bit back and forth between twitch and youtube i would love to hear from you and what the sort of benefits of one platform versus the other are my kind of plan although there's no evidence that i'm putting this into motion is that twitch is more of a place for some sort of informal casual streams and youtube is the place where my properly planned and professionally produced it doesn't really exist but that's sort of an idea thank you me i am so me for posting the survey so um one of the things on the survey you don't it's an anonymous survey but if you want to be entered to win some coding train stickers you can put your email in there so that's important item number one um item number two oh in my head i was like oh i have three or four announcements and i started talking about the survey well there's a new website coming i really should be working i shouldn't be live streaming i should be working on that website i got to get back to recording coding challenges i've got tutorial i've got so much to do um all right let's talk about um let's talk about uh then so if you've missed the twitch streams you can find the archive of them here and in particular there's a whole stream i did about the macro data basically uh refinement program and i would be glad for you to check that out and contribute uh participate in the issues file any pull requests hit me up on discord on twitter et cetera et cetera at least just play the game share your results let's bring macro data refinement to the to the masses people uh and then i mean this is the la i'm just also going to shout out uh because i've gotten so obsessed with the show i've been listening to a podcast where some neuroscientists and psychologists are talking about various elements of the show and you can find that i would highly recommend if you just watch the full season i happen to be uh uh very poorly giving some of my takes in a very inelegant way on this particular episode eight feedback but i'm sure the new uh recaps of the finale will be posted soon so check that out it's a wonderful community of people who enjoy analyzing talking and discussing uh various um television shows i haven't gotten into a show like this in i don't know i can't remember when since when maybe lost many years ago i tried to get my kids to watch lost their kindling not interested i mean i think the um severance is is not appropriate for them but uh so if you're very young it's fine there's nothing really terribly uh it's it's it's dark it's a dark dark show so you know proceed with caution um duo q life says thank you that's a nice comment i i sometimes i feel like i shouldn't read the like complimentary comments like back to you because it's very selfaggrandizing but i do appreciate your kind feedback i think i got to be done today um um and simon i'm reading your feedback simon's giving me some feedback in the discord about me i also used to do these memberonly streams i was doing really well like 2022 i was shot out of a cannon and i was streaming every week i was making coding challenges like like january and even some of february i was just like i had all this steam and i went away and there's been a lot of stuff going on and uh life gets in the way um but i think now i have a couple m i have a big project i'm working on that's gonna kind of get in my way a little bit the next couple weeks but i'm hoping to get back into the routine of things um and thank you oh i should see halt and catch fire okay yeah i mean lost don't get me started on like the last season i just mean like at its prime right lori thank you for your feedback and it's prime you know what was that i was thinking about numbers then um uh francella i am on sabbatical yes and and i have to say i mean surely i miss teaching i miss it more than i thought i would and also it's not the thing that's in the way of me being sort of like productive and doing all the things i want to do i mean it's definitely it keeps me i'm my own worst enemy i think when it comes to um trying to develop a sort of regular routine of of of making videos and working through i get i get very distracted and i get really obsessed with weird little things and get stuck on little technical problems so i don't know anyway um it's been a lot to try to set up this new studio and um i just want to make sure there's no smoke still i just don't want anything to be like i do have a smoke detector over there it didn't go off so i don't think it was that bad if you're just tuning in what you missed is the glorious glorious moment like this was like a one of the highlights of my entire life was setting up this old apple 2 plus computer from my childhood i was running my old basic programs from elementary school and then it made some horrible sounds smoke started coming out of it and i don't know what to do now i need i need help like as much as i want to be the person who could fix this myself that's not i'm not really a i'm not really a hardware person maybe i can give it a try but if you're out there you know somebody who's out there who can help me restore this um yeah especially if you're in the new york area within like a three or four hour drive of like poughkeepsie like please come over get me up come over like very soon because i need to i'm planning to use this for a project later this month but anyway maybe i'll have to postpone that we'll see um but i would like to hear from you uh all right um coming back over here i i can't i can't go uh hi nicole uh my shader expert nicole i see you in the chat uh lifelong learner thank you um i'm sorry i'm read this chat is fun to read sometimes uh hcf an amazing team of drama yeah somebody was telling me actually on the podcast um the show devs was recommended to me and in fact maybe related to some of the um themes that are also in severance so anyway the severance community on twitter it's it's popping come and say hello there uh there are youtubers who do those fixes yeah uh seb can i get seb lee delisle to fly fly in from the uk somebody asked um to give you some help like seb is always was restoring something yesterday on his channel um adrian's digital basement okay thank you i'm gonna need all of these told to me again this scientific american at least did not catch on fire all right let's ah all right so we looked at the apple plus i talked about the survey i talked about my obsession with the show severance and macro data refinement here's a question for you what would you think and i probably shouldn't do this because it'll take an enormous amount of time away from other things that maybe are i should be spending my time on but if i did something that was like a video essay style short 10 minute video maybe narrating um kind of describing some of the technology or this you know science fiction technology that's in the show severance and giving some sort of thoughts and opinions about what's what could be real what wouldn't be real um how it might work um it's not the kind of video i make on the coding train at all would that be of interest let me know and then silicon valley yeah i don't i never got into that um but um i could give that a try for sure um ah all right and then here's what i want to look at i need to keep tr i need to spin the wheel i need to pick a coding challenge to do next week because i i got to get back to that so i've already forgotten how in the world where in the world this list that i'm keeping is but let's see if i can find it um desktop backup okay i think this should give me to me okay all right uh okay this would be appropriate right to do as a coding chat oh you don't see the screen i'm sorry everybody um sorry everybody um uh this is my list of things i had some things that i wanted to add to it and i'm waiting for the chat to catch up to me so let's see what do what's what have i already done i did the mandelbulb remove i did the ulam spiral remove did the nbody problem remove now people have been giving me some really good ideas and i would like to add to them let me just do a little screenshot of this but i don't have an easy way to edit and add things to this app that i created so let's just let's just keep this as my list right now um let's let's let's keep this as my list let's spin it and see what we get some of these i don't feel so great about others i would be thrilled if it landed on and there were some really good ideas that people have been suggesting recently and i'm not doing a good job of keeping track of them let's just um i think one of my uh things i really like to develop in dream to do as simon will tell you anytime i make one of these markdown files there's a list of something i never go back to it um but i do feel like there were some really uh there were some good ones recently that i wanted to work work on but i guess i'm just gonna spin this let's just do it all right let's just do it wave function collapse algorithm that is what i'm rooting for if i'm being honest with you this is what i'm rooting for i'm spinning it i'm gonna stop it i don't think i have a drum roll here yes i do let's see what we get so i have a lot of videos doing neat like algorithms oh these are bo i'm okay k means image stippling would be i'm fine oh come on wave collapse function you're so close nope uh image stippling i'll take it i don't know image stippling it is thank you all i really appreciate all of you who watch the coding train and support me and and just by watching frankly uh by giving me your feedback um and uh i'm we you could out vote i mean i could put it to a poll it's close uh you know you're obviously the core audience the most dedicated audience of the coding train right now the wheel needs a nudge button uh you know let's put some other i can i do more polls i can only do one poll at a time now i just want to keep doing polls i'll do some twitter polls i really can't believe that the apple ii plus like caught on fire i mean i don't know if caught on fire is too strong i need to eat i didn't eat lunch it's three o'clock my kids are gonna be home from school it's gonna be the weekend it's a beautiful sunny out i should go i should go i've already played the sound effect thank you for watching um i'm going to wow uh you know wave function collapse is just taking it by maybe i shouldn't use a wheel i should just use a pole i could pick a few things that i'm interested in put them in the poll um why why do i need this wheel what does that be picked randomly wave function collapse let's do that next week people it'll be make for a wonderful video um oh great oh simon you are so great simon offered me the list towers of hanoi koningsberg bridge problem ray marching sdf rendering sudoku petrus sokoban all right i'm in the market for a web application i mean i should make this myself i should just do a stream where i make it where web applications will help me keep track of this stuff but until then thank you so much i appreciate all of you i hope you enjoyed this the smell is quite strong i'm gonna clean this up and put it to the side um let's put this camera back like where it normally this would be the whiteboard shot and uh i'm gonna put the camera back just back to sort of more of a wide shot um and so uh i hope i hope you enjoyed today's stream um you can follow me on twitter at shiffman um you can check me out on episode 8 of the post show recaps severance feedback show but don't listen to that episode listen to all the other ones nothing would make me happier than people being like oh i found the second podcast from the coding train and those communities colliding in some way i don't know um um next week i'll be back with some live streams uh and more content making some videos um and i hope to continue to be here with all of you on the internet in the way that i am now wherever i can't see the chat anymore cause i have a new did somebody join teemo i'm making this happen no no no no no unlimited try i don't have unlimited tracks can i delete one import files no browse uh i started setting up a new sound board i don't have i don't have the help thank you you're a new passenger on the coding trade i don't have my train whistle it's in a box somewhere but i i appreciate you and welcome there's a thing where i give people random numbers it never went anywhere but i'm getting back into it i love you all we're gonna end uh timo make sure make sure you uh join the discord and you sync your discord with your youtube account and you can join us in the uh member uh channels there a lovely friendly community that will chat with you and answer your code questions this is the musical dance experience you've all been promised and i'll see you all next time on the coding train goodbye is there any music i could possibly play see you next time thank you epidemic sound for the music tracks that i'm playing for you all and uh see you all you
