00:00 - hello in this video about WebGL in p5
00:04 - I'm going to attempt to explain
00:06 - something and implement something and
00:08 - that is adding a texture to some
00:10 - geometry so I'm kind of checking off
00:12 - this list and by the way a couple things
00:13 - that I've now realized I've missed is
00:15 - I've only shown you in terms of geometry
00:18 - primitives and there are some other ways
00:21 - right in theory I think this might be at
00:24 - the time of recording this video a
00:25 - little bit buggy because I've been doing
00:27 - some experiment with it there's no
00:28 - reason why I couldn't use begin shape
00:30 - and end shape to create custom geometry
00:33 - right to create my own algorithmic 3d
00:35 - shape in WebGL so that's certainly
00:39 - something that should be on the horizon
00:41 - for p5 and in addition to that I could
00:43 - also use a function called load model so
00:47 - if anyone wants to make like a nice
00:48 - model of a train or something send it to
00:51 - me maybe I'll make a video that loads up
00:53 - and I think typically there's probably a
00:54 - bunch of different file formats of 3d
00:56 - models but certainly one that I believe
00:58 - works with p5 as an obj so if you're
01:02 - making a 3d model and some other 3d
01:04 - authoring software and export it as an
01:06 - obj file you could import so but what I
01:09 - want to focus on here is texturing and
01:11 - what texturing is is instead of simply
01:14 - having a material this sort of that is
01:16 - just a color or an or a certain kind of
01:19 - reflective continuous surface that you
01:22 - can actually take an image something
01:24 - that you loaded it could be a live video
01:26 - recorded video or a static image and
01:28 - wrap that image around the particulars
01:31 - shape whether it's a sphere a torus a
01:33 - box of playing etc so I want to look at
01:35 - that texturing an image so let's go look
01:38 - at how we do that and to simplify things
01:41 - let me actually first start off by just
01:44 - making a plane so I'm actually gonna
01:46 - make a plane a plane is a geometry
01:49 - that's just a flat plane and I could
01:53 - give it a width and a height so I'm
01:54 - gonna just say 200 200 to make a square
01:56 - plane so you can see here's mine this is
01:58 - very similar just drawing rectangle but
02:00 - the fact that I'm using plane one of the
02:02 - 3d geometry primitives means I could
02:04 - actually texture this right now and you
02:07 - can see it's responding to the light the
02:09 - light is still on the scene so I'm gonna
02:10 - leave the light in the scene for right
02:12 - now
02:13 - take that off so now I also happen to
02:15 - have a directory of images
02:17 - I don't know anybody have a favorite
02:19 - kitten they want to see right now I
02:20 - think let's just go with kitten zero
02:23 - cute kitten zero okay kid zero is going
02:26 - to be our texture so what I'm going to
02:28 - add now is I'm gonna add preload preload
02:33 - is a function in p5 that allows you to
02:35 - load data assets media assets other
02:37 - things that are ready before set up and
02:39 - draw happen so I'm gonna make a variable
02:41 - called kitten and then in preload emits
02:45 - a kitten equals load image and I had a
02:48 - directory called kittens and I had a
02:51 - file called kitten not zero dot jpg
02:54 - kitten zero dot jpg and now what I'm
02:57 - going to do here is I'm gonna comment
02:59 - out the material and I'm just going to
03:01 - say texture kitten and the magic will
03:06 - happen we're gonna see our kitten Oh
03:10 - interesting so the kitten is like so in
03:13 - just look at the image itself is
03:15 - responding to the light so one thing I
03:17 - want to do right now just to simplify
03:18 - things because I don't want to worry too
03:20 - much about light is I'm just going to
03:21 - create ambient white light and take out
03:24 - this directional light that I worked on
03:26 - in the previous video just to simplify
03:27 - things and so now we can see there's our
03:30 - kitten oh it's spinning off as like in
03:34 - the end of Superman 3 which is a movie
03:36 - that I seem to reference way too often
03:38 - in my videos General Zod the kitten
03:41 - okay um so what else can we do let's
03:44 - just try some other shapes why not
03:47 - let's try box now we have Owen let's
03:53 - make the Box a little smaller now we
03:56 - have that kitten image on all sides of
03:58 - the box
03:59 - let's try sphere now we have to say now
04:04 - here we're seeing something that's now
04:06 - having so p5 and the WebGL render is
04:09 - making a decision it's like well here's
04:11 - an image here's some geometry this is my
04:13 - best guess as to how you intended to
04:16 - wrap that image around the geometry and
04:19 - in this case if I wanted to you make
04:21 - this appear like a planetary surface for
04:23 - example I would I would get actually us
04:26 - Oracle polarized image of like a texture
04:29 - map or something - - so there's a lot of
04:31 - work in terms of how you might want to
04:33 - design images that work well in certain
04:34 - contexts but we can see that that just
04:36 - works I'm just just seeing all that I'm
04:38 - just here for all the shapes Taurus so
04:43 - you can see there's the kitten wrapped
04:45 - around the Taurus and we can stop this
04:47 - now so I'm gonna go back to box o and
04:50 - you can see here even with different
04:51 - dimensions it's it's doing different
04:54 - things to the Kin so I'm gonna go back
04:55 - to box 100 and there we go so now I want
04:58 - to look at some other what's interesting
05:00 - about this is there's no reason why we
05:02 - can't use a video source so if if you
05:06 - look under a create video or create
05:08 - capture let's try to use create capture
05:10 - so I'm gonna say and setup I'm gonna say
05:15 - let cam for camera cam equals create
05:19 - capture I'm gonna say 200 200 oh wait no
05:25 - sorry I don't give it a size video I
05:26 - think that's how I do it create capture
05:28 - video let's just see what happens here
05:30 - okay so we should see up there I am so
05:33 - this is the capture element it's a
05:36 - separate Dom element that's taking the
05:38 - live webcam feed you can now see my
05:39 - secret green screen here okay it's right
05:47 - back
05:47 - I forgot that I was making a video
05:48 - tutorial it went off in my own world all
05:51 - right so a couple things one is let me
05:52 - just make that a little smaller just so
05:56 - we can kind of see it there but not have
05:59 - it overall in the screen and then now
06:01 - what I want to do is can I make this
06:02 - video a texture on the box so I don't
06:06 - see any reason why I couldn't just
06:07 - change this from kitten to cam there I
06:15 - am oh oh I could do my Superman 3 thing
06:17 - now you please just humor me just humor
06:19 - me turn off the video good something
06:20 - else I'm gonna do this my own personal
06:22 - enjoyment
06:34 - alright never mind okay moving on
06:36 - so you get the idea I can take and by
06:38 - the way if I if I wanted this to appear
06:40 - less I don't know what I want this to
06:42 - appear like but I can use ab cam hide in
06:47 - which case I could actually only see the
06:51 - video texture on the box so this is a
06:53 - way you can take any image like a live
06:55 - video and texture and I could change
06:56 - that to a sphere or a torus I do want to
06:58 - again at some point look at how I can
07:01 - start to assign image textures to custom
07:05 - drawn shapes with begin shape and end
07:06 - shape so I need to approach that in a
07:08 - separate video and just look at loading
07:10 - models and custom shapes so somebody
07:12 - remind me if that video doesn't exist in
07:13 - this playlist to do that otherwise
07:15 - you're gonna see it it's a point in a
07:16 - few videos from now alright I'm back at
07:18 - the end of this video I'm not sure
07:19 - exactly why but two questions came up in
07:21 - the chat one is how do lights affect
07:23 - texture and two how
07:26 - what about shadowing so just out of
07:28 - curiosity let me try putting a plane at
07:31 - the bottom so what I'm gonna do just to
07:35 - show you a little more sort of 3d stuff
07:36 - I'm gonna say with this spinning cube
07:40 - I'm gonna put a push before and a pop
07:45 - after so that the rotate does not affect
07:48 - anything that comes after and then I'm
07:50 - gonna add this plane so we should see
07:53 - here oops there I am the click but I
07:57 - want that plane now to look as if it's a
07:59 - floor maybe so what I want to do is
08:03 - translate maybe all the way down to the
08:06 - bottom and then rotate if I want to take
08:09 - this plane and rotate it like this to be
08:10 - flat I want to say this is the x-axis so
08:15 - I want to rotate X and rotate it
08:18 - basically 90 degrees which is a half pie
08:21 - let's try that so you can see there it
08:29 - is and I don't want what I want to do
08:30 - also is maybe only translate it a
08:32 - hundred down make the plane like really
08:35 - really big and maybe I want to give that
08:38 - a ambient material so it doesn't have a
08:40 - texture of white is that gonna override
08:43 - the texture whoa
08:45 - bugginess okay great so we can see now
08:47 - that there's like this floor making it
08:51 - white made it a little confusing but
08:53 - let's let's make the background let's
08:57 - make it it's fine so what I want to do
08:59 - is let me try to add some light there's
09:00 - an ambient white light right now let's
09:02 - take out that ambient light and you can
09:05 - see the floor it's not buggy it just
09:07 - takes a little while for the video to
09:08 - start the floor is now black but it does
09:12 - have an ambient material of white so
09:14 - let's try adding this directional light
09:18 - so I this is a directional light that I
09:20 - did in the previous video which just
09:23 - shines a light from far away at a given
09:25 - direction based on the mouse and I'm
09:28 - gonna make let's make that light white
09:30 - just too and I'm gonna just give it I
09:33 - might be able to give it just 255 but
09:34 - I'm gonna give it all three let's give
09:35 - that a look so you can see now look that
09:41 - light is shining and it's only able to
09:44 - see the sides of the cube where the
09:49 - light is and you can see there's a
09:50 - little going on based on the light now
09:53 - the thing is the shadowing I probably
09:56 - have to be more thoughtful about the
09:57 - position these objects in order to get
10:01 - the shadowing to work in a way where I
10:02 - might actually see so I'm gonna leave it
10:05 - to you as an exercise to try seeing what
10:07 - you can do with point lights and ambient
10:09 - lights and different shapes to see if
10:11 - you can get shadowing but you can see
10:12 - sort of the stuff that you've got to
10:14 - play with here and in terms of having a
10:19 - light that's shining into the scene with
10:20 - different shapes with different
10:22 - materials and different textures okay
10:23 - thanks for watching
10:25 - [Music]
10:32 - you

humor me turn off the video good something else I'm gonna do this my own personal enjoyment alright never mind okay moving on so you get the idea I can take and by the way if I if I wanted this to
