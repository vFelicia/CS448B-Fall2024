00:00 - hello this short video I'm going to talk
00:02 - about a quick homework assignment you
00:04 - could do for week 3 of programming from
00:06 - A to Z if you happen to be following
00:07 - these YouTube videos as a course that
00:09 - you might be taking on your own or
00:10 - however it is you're doing it and you
00:13 - can submit your homework assignments by
00:15 - subscribing to the patreon channel the
00:18 - slack channel through the patreon link
00:19 - in this video's description or you can
00:21 - share them with me on twitter at
00:22 - Schiffman so this week's topic is
00:27 - looking at how to get external data into
00:31 - your programs so what you might have
00:33 - done for a previous assignment is mash
00:35 - up some text make a quick mashup text
00:37 - exercise in the browser maybe use
00:40 - regular expressions for it now what
00:41 - happens if when you're doing that you
00:43 - bring in an external data source so what
00:46 - if you what if you find a data source
00:50 - from corpora which is a github
00:52 - repository that has a lot of JSON files
00:54 - full of strange and interesting data
00:56 - maintained by tiny subversions what if
00:58 - you use a javascript library that has a
01:00 - lexicon in it or allows you to analyze
01:01 - text by parts of speech and pull out a
01:03 - random word or alter the text by
01:06 - changing the tense of verbs are negating
01:09 - a statement that type of thing you could
01:11 - also use an API what if you pull in text
01:14 - from the New York Times or from
01:15 - Wikipedia and from that you generate
01:17 - some kind of poetry or experimental text
01:19 - machine there's also a word neck which
01:22 - is a web service that has a ton of
01:24 - information about words so you can get
01:26 - definitions example sentences
01:30 - pronunciation all sorts of metadata
01:32 - about particular kinds of words and you
01:34 - might try experimenting with that you
01:37 - know you could create an interactive
01:38 - system where did you click on words you
01:41 - get a synonym you change swap out a
01:44 - synonym or that has more syllables in it
01:46 - or something like that so all of these
01:48 - types of things are possible I also
01:50 - showed in the coding challenge how you
01:51 - could crowdsource a data source by
01:53 - sending out a Google Form and having
01:56 - people enter in data for like a mad libs
01:58 - project and you can try using that by
02:00 - having a Google sheet be the input into
02:02 - your project so any of these are kind of
02:04 - possibilities I'm going to mention a
02:06 - couple other things one is I would also
02:11 - would like to make a
02:12 - loose requirement me nothing's required
02:14 - but as a kind of loose requirement
02:16 - contribute some data to creep aura so go
02:18 - and this is a good practice for
02:20 - collaboration and an open source and get
02:22 - and github and all those things try to
02:24 - submit a pull request with some new data
02:25 - to Korra and also the other thing I
02:28 - would encourage you to think about is
02:29 - interactivity so how can how might you
02:33 - use one of these data sources and you
02:36 - know i'm using this mode of like you
02:38 - enter text into a text input field you
02:40 - hit submit and then you get new text out
02:42 - and this is good for practicing
02:44 - algorithms that are kind of just
02:46 - modality of interaction that kind of
02:48 - works as a basic starting point but what
02:50 - might be something that happens if as
02:52 - you're typing it starts to change the
02:54 - texture typing or as data new data comes
02:57 - in from a spreadsheet the page is
02:58 - continuously updating so what are some
03:01 - other interactive forms what about what
03:03 - if you use animation so you might think
03:06 - about sort of creative interactions that
03:08 - I can't even imagine right now other
03:10 - than these sort of like basic known
03:11 - forms of how you can interact with texts
03:14 - since you're in the browser beyond just
03:15 - the generation of text itself so play
03:18 - around with that share your work with me
03:20 - however you want to share it and I look
03:22 - forward to seeing what happens ok see
03:24 - you soon
03:29 - you
