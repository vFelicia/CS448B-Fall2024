00:00 - hello, ok, so here's the thing
00:02 - if you watched the previous video
00:03 - you will have noticed it was a complete disaster!
00:05 - so what I'm gonna try to do with this one
00:08 - is make this really short
00:10 - just talk about one simple topic
00:12 - it's gonna be like, I'm gonna turn the clock on
00:14 - clock is now going, I can see it
00:16 - I'm gonna try to keep this to 3 or 4 minutes
00:18 - simple topic, we're gonna discuss it
00:20 - we're gonna make one quick example
00:22 - the video will be over
00:23 - we're not gonna lose the train of thought
00:25 - we're gonna keep the energy going
00:26 - and you're gonna really, it's going to be great, ok?
00:29 - ok, here we go!
00:30 - today's topic for this video is logical operators
00:33 - so what have we just be doing?
00:35 - in the previous video I actually made this example
00:37 - but I talked for so long the cam just recorded
for twelve minutes
00:40 - and then cut off
00:41 - but I got to this point where we made this ... 
example where what we're saying is:
00:46 - aha, if ... now x is greater than 500 
draw a red background
00:52 - 400 yellow background
00:54 - let's see where we're going here
00:56 - ah, wooh, pink, that's beautiful
00:57 - pink background
00:58 - if 300 blue, 200 ... and in all other cases: green.
01:04 - so we learned about how we can have
an if statement:
01:06 - when the condition is met, execute that code.
01:08 - when can join in a statement with 'else if'
01:10 - saying if this is true, otherwise if this is true
01:13 - and 'else' tells us in all the other cases to do this.
01:15 - and I probably don't need to recap 
the previous video
01:18 - because in most cases you'll just have watched it
01:19 - but I'm gonna figure that out eventually
01:21 - it will make sense and I'll just redo all of these.
01:23 - ok, but there's one more piece.
01:26 - so this is actually everything you need to know
01:27 - to design the logic of your program
01:29 - is right here in this example
01:31 - IF, ELSE IF and ELSE
01:32 - you basically, with variables and conditionals
01:35 - you can program absolutely anything!
01:37 - you know, we're gonna introduce
01:40 - a lot of things to make this better
01:41 - - and it's already a minute and a half, 
and I say three minutes -
01:43 - so I'm gonna get back to this.
01:44 - logical operators, what we're talking about
01:46 - when we talk about logical operators
01:48 - are AND and OR, because sometimes 
we wanna say things like
01:54 - IF I'm hungry AND it's evening,
have dinner.
01:59 - IF I'm hungry AND it's morning,
have breakfast.
02:03 - right? so we want to be able to join
02:05 - two boolean expressions. 
if they're both true, do this!
02:09 - if only one of them is true, do this!
02:11 - if only one of them is true that's OR.
02:13 - by the way, there's something called 'exclusive or'
02:15 - - but I don't know why I bring this up right now -
02:17 - but it is kind of interesting
02:18 - 'exclusive or' means 'they can't both be true',
02:21 - just one of them true. maybe you need that
for something but let's
02:23 - just not worry about that right now.
02:25 - this has nothing to do with anything
- unintelligble .
02:28 - ok, it's like talking about 'double buffering' (?)
or something like that.
02:32 - here we go!
02:33 - AND and OR.
02:34 - how do we ... that?
02:36 - so what if I have a boolean expression
02:38 - and I wanna know if this boolean expression
02:41 - is true and this boolean expression is true
02:44 - then execute the code that's in here.
02:46 - well, you might be thinking: oh, 
you could just write the word AND there.
02:50 - that might be nice, that would sort of make sense
02:52 - it would look right and it seems to match
02:54 - the logic that we've been talking about.
02:55 - the thing about Processing is
02:58 - it's built on this language called Java,
03:00 - which in many ways ... similar syntax
03:03 - than the programming language C
03:04 - and the logical AND is written 
with two ampersands (&&)
03:09 - - I am very good at drawing ampersands -
03:12 - which is actually not true at all, 
as you can see with this horrible ampersand
03:14 - this is an AND
03:16 - so IF this expression is true AND
this expression is true,
03:20 - the ampersands joins those,
03:23 - sometimes because I like to be 
a little bit anal about stuff
03:26 - you can put parentheses around 
the whole thing too
03:29 - because truly this whole thing 
is one boolean expression
03:32 - the whole thing evaluates to either true or false
03:34 - it only happens to evaluate to true
03:37 - when both of these sub-boolean expressions
03:39 - also evaluate to true.
03:40 - so what if I wrote something like this:
03:43 - if mouseX is greater than 100
03:45 - AND mouseX is less than 50
03:48 - execute this code
03:50 - what's wrong with this?
03:51 - it's completely illogical!
03:53 - I mean it'll work but it is impossible.
03:55 - try, I dare you, try to come up with a number
03:59 - that is both greater than 200 and smaller than 50!
04:02 - take your time. as long as you need.
04:04 - get back to me whenever, I will do some
sort of exciting thing
04:08 - like eat a cupcake, dance on top of
a small ... stand while wearing
04:15 - a pretty outfit or something, 
I can't come up with anything right now.
04:20 - if you can come up with that number,
but it's not possible.
04:22 - so just because you have these options
04:25 - doesn't mean that you automatically
04:26 - gonna write all this great code
04:28 - that's gonna do this stuff.
04:29 - it's still up to you to come up with that logic
04:31 - to implement what you want.
04:32 - let's look at a scenario where this AND 
ampersand can make sense
04:35 - so, we wanna say:
04:37 - if - we're gonna get rid of all this stuff -
04:43 - if mouseX is greater than 100 AND
if mouseX is less than 200
04:53 - and let's put those, I think it's useful,
I shouldn't have gotten rid of it,
04:59 - to draw lines on the screen in this case
05:03 - just so we can see them
05:05 - and know where the mouse is
in relation to those numbers
05:09 - ok, so what's the problem?
05:11 - look at me, it's good that this happened
05:14 - 'unexpected token ampersand'
05:16 - you can't really see that
05:17 - there's a way to zoom
05:18 - oh, how do I zoom?
05:19 - terrible pause, look up something on Google!
05:23 - Ok, I gotta figure that out
05:24 - I know how to do it on my laptop
05:26 - but this is like a regular keyboard
05:28 - so down here, you can't read it,
at the bottom it says:
05:31 - 'unexpected token &'
05:33 - so something must be wrong with 
the syntax back here
05:36 - but ... we wrote it here, we put 
these parentheses around here
05:39 - so it's a little bit goofy
05:41 - I mean, I'm just gonna show you
05:43 - if I took these parentheses out
05:44 - it's gonna work
05:46 - so this is gonna be fine.
remember you need to have parentheses
05:50 - that are going around 
the entire boolean expression
05:53 - the way I had it before, like this, 
there were no parentheses
05:56 - going around the entire boolean expression
05:59 - this will also work because we can have
parentheses around the other
06:04 - boolean expressions. this, I would say, 
is probably a good way to write it
06:07 - just to be most clear right now.
06:08 - so if mouseX is greater than 100
and mouseX is less than 200
06:12 - tada tada taaaa
06:15 - ok, over here we got a black background,
06:16 - over here we got a black background,
06:18 - and inbetween we've got red, 
inbetween, because here
06:21 - is where the value is both
greater than 100
06:23 - and less than 200. Six minutes
and counting ... ok.
06:26 - Ok, we've got to talk about OR.
06:29 - I mean, how can I not make a video about AND and OR and have it just ...
06:33 - it could be done in three minutes, 
I don't know what going on
06:35 - gonna work on it. 
Ok: OR. The thing about this stuff
06:39 - is what's nice about these boolean expressions
and this logical stuff
06:41 - it really just follows your intuition
06:43 - I mean, you don't have to explain what AND means
06:45 - just try to say it in English: 
if mouseX is greater than 100
06:50 - and less than 200, then execute this code.
06:57 - it works out. what if, ... in this case
OR is written in an even more
07:02 - cryptic way: OR is written with two pipes.
07:05 - that is OR. Okay?
07:09 - so I could say: if the mouseX is greater than 100
07:13 - OR it is less than 200 then 
what's gonna happen?
07:17 - no matter what I do it's always red! why?
07:20 - try to come up with a number that's
neither greater than 100 nor less than 200!
07:25 - every number, 300 is greater than 100, 
50 happens to be less than 200
07:30 - 150 is greater than 100 and less than 200
07:32 - so this is always true!
07:33 - both together with an OR , at least one of 
them is going to be true
07:37 - but now we have to case, what if we 
say: if it's greater than 200
07:41 - OR less than 100? 
what's gonna happen now?
07:45 - it's greater than 200, we have red
07:46 - it's less than 100, it's red
07:48 - but now if it's here, neither of those 
expressions evaluates to true
07:52 - it's neither greater than 200 nor less 
than 100, and we've got
07:56 - a black background now in the middle.
08:00 - this brings up an interesting point. 
there is another logical operator:
08:04 - it is called NOT. Right?
08:07 - if x is greater than 100, do something.
08:13 - what if I was saying:
if x is NOT greater than 100, do something?
08:17 - this is very, very useful!
08:19 - oftentimes you want to sort of do the inverse.
08:22 - so I could say right here: 
if this entire boolean expression
08:27 - is not true, and that's not the right syntax ...
08:32 - .... probably put another set of parentheses around
08:34 - you know, I don't know what's wrong with me today
08:36 - I just completely lost my mind but, uhm, 
this is the complete opposite
08:40 - so now if, we can certainly the crazy, 
by the way, we've just gone off
08:45 - the deep end here, this is a nice little
demonstration but the point of this
08:49 - was to kind of understand OR, AND and NOT.
08:54 - so you can use these in all kinds of combinations
08:57 - you can say: if this and this or this but not this
09:00 - you can create these very elaborate
boolean expressions.
09:04 - for the most part it is very hard to do that
in a vacuum, we're coming up with
09:08 - these arbitrary scenarios, what you wanna do now
09:11 - is figure out where is this going to be useful to you
09:15 - and I think our next video, where we will finally
return to that moving ball
09:19 - is really going to demonstrate that, 
and you're ready for this now.
09:22 - how could you say, for example,
with these structures:
09:26 - we're gonna do this in the next video
09:27 - if you have a ball moving over here,
if it reaches this edge,
09:31 - or if it reaches the other edge,
how to turn around?
09:35 - that's one place where OR would make sense.
09:37 - that's, it's really, you know, 
it'd be much easier
09:40 - if you were just standing here and said:
oh, I have this idea, what kind of
09:43 - logical expression do I need?
well, then we would kind of
09:45 - work that through. but with the absence 
of an idea we're just kind of
09:48 - spinning in the wind. so, maybe if I make some 
of these videos in the future
09:51 - I've got more specific examples. 
this is practically 10 minutes!!

Cleaned transcript:

hello, ok, so here's the thing if you watched the previous video you will have noticed it was a complete disaster! so what I'm gonna try to do with this one is make this really short just talk about one simple topic it's gonna be like, I'm gonna turn the clock on clock is now going, I can see it I'm gonna try to keep this to 3 or 4 minutes simple topic, we're gonna discuss it we're gonna make one quick example the video will be over we're not gonna lose the train of thought we're gonna keep the energy going and you're gonna really, it's going to be great, ok? ok, here we go! today's topic for this video is logical operators so what have we just be doing? in the previous video I actually made this example but I talked for so long the cam just recorded for twelve minutes and then cut off but I got to this point where we made this ... example where what we're saying is aha, if ... now x is greater than 500 draw a red background 400 yellow background let's see where we're going here ah, wooh, pink, that's beautiful pink background if 300 blue, 200 ... and in all other cases green. so we learned about how we can have an if statement when the condition is met, execute that code. when can join in a statement with 'else if' saying if this is true, otherwise if this is true and 'else' tells us in all the other cases to do this. and I probably don't need to recap the previous video because in most cases you'll just have watched it but I'm gonna figure that out eventually it will make sense and I'll just redo all of these. ok, but there's one more piece. so this is actually everything you need to know to design the logic of your program is right here in this example IF, ELSE IF and ELSE you basically, with variables and conditionals you can program absolutely anything! you know, we're gonna introduce a lot of things to make this better and it's already a minute and a half, and I say three minutes so I'm gonna get back to this. logical operators, what we're talking about when we talk about logical operators are AND and OR, because sometimes we wanna say things like IF I'm hungry AND it's evening, have dinner.
