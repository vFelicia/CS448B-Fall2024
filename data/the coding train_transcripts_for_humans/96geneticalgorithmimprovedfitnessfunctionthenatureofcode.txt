00:00 - Hello welcome to another genetic
algorithms video, in this video I want to
00:04 - talk about an improved fitness function,
now there are so many different ways you
00:09 - can improve a fitness function in ways
that you could design and think about a
00:12 - fitness function and I less mean this
video to be like here's one thing but I
00:15 - just want to use this video as a way to
start thinking about how this fitness
00:20 - function is your creative thing that
you're creating and anything you could
00:23 - imagine you could possibly do with that
function. So if you recall this
00:27 - particular example which is a search
problem
00:30 - it's a simulation running a genetic
algorithm to evolve the phrase
00:34 - "To be or not to be" and every time I run this
00:37 - it takes it's typically taken between
somewhere between like 300 and 600
00:40 - generations to get to the correct phrase
and you can see it took five hundred
00:44 - fifty four generations
so let's talk about the fitness function
00:47 - [Coding Power!!]
00:48 - let's talk about the fitness function
00:51 - and the way to fitness.. if i were to
graph that fitness function right?
00:56 - This is number of, the x axis is the
number of characters correct
01:02 - ok? so the more characters 
you get correct
01:06 - the higher the fitness right?
01:10 - Yay more characters correct higher the
fitness and this works because I might
01:15 - have you know in the case I might have a
phrase that's like 20 characters long
01:19 - and I have you know 16 characters
correct versus 17 correctors.. characters
01:24 - correct, this as a higher fitness
01:26 - it's going to be more likely to be
picked as a, in the selection process to
01:31 - have its genetic information passed to
the next generation
01:33 - but there's a problem here what if this
phrase were not 20 characters long
01:38 - but what if it were two thousand or two
hundred thousand or two million
01:42 - characters long?
01:45 - Let's think about the fitness values of
certain random phrases
01:51 - so one random phrase might 
have 391 263 characters correct
01:58 - and another one might have
390 264 characters correct
02:05 - now this one is better than this one
02:08 - and in fact
02:08 - just one more character correct it's
really a lot better than the other one
02:12 - and we really want to make it more
likely to have its genetic information
02:15 - passed down to the next generation
02:17 - but if you take this value and divide it by 2
million and you take this value and and divide it by
02:22 - 2 million, the number you get from this
value is only a tiny bit bigger than
02:27 - this one
02:28 - so in other words this value is only a
tiny bit bigger than this value but I
02:33 - really want that one that's a little bit
a tiny bit higher to be much more likely
02:37 - to be picked because I want my evolution
to happen efficiently and faster and all of that
02:41 - so a simple way around this is to make
the uhh.. to make the fitness function
02:47 - exponential
02:48 - what if I could have the number of
charac.. the more characters you have correct
02:53 - the more.. the higher your fitness is
exponentially and there are a variety of
02:58 - ways you can do this I could say the
fitness is 2 to the n (2^n), being n is the
03:02 - number of characters correct
03:03 - I could take n squared or n to the
4th power
03:06 - you know I could probably come up with
some other fancy or math to do but I
03:10 - just want to get you thinking that these
are the types of issues that you want to
03:13 - think about and in fact let's go back to
this program and I'm gonna go to the
03:19 - fitness function which is here right I'm
just gonna say is a very simple thing
03:24 - I'm gonna say this.fitness equals power
03:27 - this.fitness squared so this is me
taking fitness to the second power and I
03:33 - could've just said this.fitness times
this.fitness but whatever I'm doing
03:36 - this.fitness squared and now let's run
it again and I.. you'll have to sort of
03:40 - trust in me at this point but I run
this about four or five times and it's
03:43 - solving it between about three hundred
and six hundred generations
03:47 - let's run it again. We can play some music
while we wait.. there's no music... ♪♫
03:51 - Oh I didn't have to wait very long - 240.
Let's run it again
03:55 - ♪♫♩ ♪ ♫ ♬♪♫ ♭ ♩ ♪ ♫ ♬ ♭ ♪♫
04:00 - boy it's taking a long time... boy this is not good
04:04 - That was an anomaly, let's run it again
04:07 - ♪♫♪♫
04:08 - 217 - that's pretty good.
04:11 - ♪ ♫ ♬♪♫ ♭ ♩
(music playing)
04:15 - 236, you can
see I've improved
04:17 - and I could even go.. 
I could go to the 4th power
04:21 - right?
04:22 - ♪ ♫ ♬♪♫ ♭ ♩
04:25 - Aah 120
04:28 - the wrong button.. refresh
04:30 - ♪ ♫ ♬♪♫ ♭ ♩
04:31 - 89, so you can see that
04:33 - that exponential fitness function really
has improved things and so this is
04:36 - something you could consider. So you
could also go back to the Smart Rockets
04:39 - example as an exercise, find the Smart
Rockets example that I made in the previous
04:43 - coding challenge and see if you could
use that distance, the distance to the
04:47 - target which is part of the fitness, and
use an exponential function to see if
04:51 - you can make that particular evolution
happen you know more quickly
04:54 - or kind of work more efficiently
okay thanks for watching and I'll see
04:58 - you in another video soon.
