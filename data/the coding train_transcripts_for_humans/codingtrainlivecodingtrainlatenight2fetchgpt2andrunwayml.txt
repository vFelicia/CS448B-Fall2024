03:48 - oh hello and good evening welcome to
03:57 - another late night edition of the coding
04:00 - train with me
04:03 - internet weirdo dan Schiffman
04:06 - now I had earlier today
04:09 - Oh plan and thought about what I was
04:12 - gonna say at the very moment I'd switch
04:13 - the camera over myself and I completely
04:16 - forgot what it was right now you know I
04:18 - actually have enough room here on this
04:20 - table in between the camera and where
04:22 - I'm sitting that it could have like a
04:23 - little bit of a teleprompter so again
04:25 - I'm looking for some writers to write me
04:28 - some scripts that I will read to you
04:30 - actually better yet ultimately the plan
04:33 - here eventually is for me to just have
04:35 - an AI model a machine learning model
04:38 - generate the script for me so that's
04:40 - that's coming I mean I it'll make oh you
04:44 - might think that will make any sense but
04:46 - it's it's hard to not make nearly as
04:47 - much sense as I don't make Cheers so as
04:54 - with most late-night shows this is not a
04:59 - show nor it is late at night oh boy I
05:02 - can't bring myself to do this
05:08 - why don't skeletons ride rollercoasters
05:12 - they don't have the stomach for it
05:17 - [Applause]
05:20 - why does a moon rock taste better than
05:25 - an earth rock well I don't like this one
05:29 - because it's a little meteor I feel like
05:31 - you know some of you might that one's no
05:34 - good let's boo that one good what do you
05:43 - call a fake noodle and imposter what
05:56 - time is it I don't know it keeps
05:59 - changing
06:01 - actually fortunately here we go we've
06:04 - got our countdown clock going because as
06:07 - you know once it gets to zero o'clock I
06:10 - turn into a creepy looking AI artificial
06:13 - intelligence pumpkin all right I don't
06:17 - think I'll go with this anymore we need
06:19 - to get ourselves centered we need to
06:21 - feel ready that we can be here together
06:23 - in moments here to make some fun
06:30 - interesting coding projects late at
06:32 - night from my home here in Brooklyn my
06:34 - children are fast asleep to be honest I
06:36 - seriously doubt they're asleep
06:38 - but they're in their room quiet I can't
06:41 - hear them they can hear me apparently
06:43 - last night I was told yeah we can hear
06:45 - you
06:45 - you're kind of loud so there it is but
06:48 - just before they went to bed I got out
06:51 - my usual night time reading the book a
06:55 - million random digits with one have't
06:59 - 103d is 12 it is way past your bedtime
07:02 - young person 3d hmm oh I hear something
07:08 - so all of you who are past your bedtime
07:12 - and just about to go to sleep I will now
07:14 - read to you from my book of random
07:17 - numbers
07:25 - thirty four thousand nine hundred and
07:29 - ninety sixty two thousand one hundred
07:32 - and twenty two oops oops oops we have to
07:37 - take a break here
07:38 - Lucas Chang Lucas Chang what was it that
07:43 - I was using yesterday for the member
07:50 - what it was this breaking news we have a
07:58 - message from Lucas Chang
08:01 - Lucas Chang says thank you well thank
08:06 - you
08:11 - Lucas Chang this random number goes out
08:14 - to you 2639
08:24 - forty-four thousand two hundred and
08:26 - seventy three fifty seven thousand six
08:29 - hundred and seventy eight thirty four
08:32 - thousand five hundred and fifteen
08:35 - fourteen thousand one hundred and
08:37 - seventy six ninety one thousand five
08:41 - hundred fifty to eighty nine thousand
08:44 - four hundred and twenty four fifteen
08:47 - thousand two hundred and thirty six
08:51 - fifty three thousand nine hundred and
08:53 - forty-seven and thirty four thousand
08:56 - four hundred and forty-eight well I like
09:10 - to read from my book of random numbers
09:12 - at the start of my coding train the
09:16 - night train late night with the coding
09:18 - train just to make sure that if you're
09:22 - watching you have the chance to leave
09:29 - tomorrow actually one thing that I said
09:31 - yesterday I said that if you come back
09:32 - tomorrow you can actually check the
09:35 - video's description and they'll be time
09:37 - codes in there and the time codes might
09:40 - indicate where something that you might
09:42 - actually want to watch happened
09:44 - unfortunately didn't get to that with
09:46 - yesterday's show so maybe maybe it will
09:50 - be true tomorrow maybe it won't it's
09:52 - really I really don't know I just don't
09:54 - know this ginger tea is delicious I'm
10:00 - drinking it out of my Highclere Castle
10:02 - hug yes I have a hiker class
10:12 - all right so what is this why are you
10:15 - here why are you watching this I don't
10:17 - know
10:18 - like I've said probably too many times
10:20 - at this point I encourage you to go to
10:22 - bed
10:23 - some of you interestingly enough might
10:24 - just be waking up in the morning
10:26 - depending on where you are in the world
10:27 - you might be having your morning coffee
10:29 - a little I don't know morning toast
10:32 - whatever you eat for breakfast I wish
10:36 - you a wonderful day
10:39 - exercise meditate I'm not sure but if
10:43 - you choose to stay with me here for the
10:46 - next 51 minutes I can't see the chat
10:50 - anymore I've got to fix this there we go
10:53 - Anthony is asking if I'm okay you know
10:57 - it's a really weird thing to be by
11:00 - yourself in a room with some bright
11:03 - lights on you a camera your computer
11:05 - feeling like there are a few hundred
11:07 - people watching and you really have no
11:09 - idea what to say or what to do one of
11:14 - these days maybe I will have my act
11:16 - together and I will have a plan and a
11:18 - script and segments and all those things
11:20 - but for now I'm just here and the the
11:24 - idea here with coding train late at
11:27 - night just to switch you over to my
11:29 - laptop for a second is that I have a
11:32 - list of sort of strange weird projects
11:35 - I'm interested in working on they are
11:37 - found in this coding train late-night
11:40 - github repository and last night we made
11:44 - the midnight pumpkin alarm so I can add
11:47 - myself here so oh but it's over there
11:49 - look at this I had this fixed last night
11:51 - this wasn't working the midnight pumpkin
11:53 - alarm which was right above me and I had
11:58 - a suggestion here thank you too let's
12:01 - pull up this pull request which has now
12:02 - been merged from Joe Pesci Joe Parris
12:06 - who says add ideas for using I Can Has
12:10 - dad joke to fetch a joke as a discord
12:12 - bot command and possibly displaying that
12:15 - joke on screen during the stream and oh
12:17 - that is a great idea
12:18 - but I think I could do one better here
12:22 - so my goal for tonight
12:24 - by the end of tonight is to have a
12:27 - machine learning model generating new
12:30 - dad jokes so that's what we are here to
12:33 - make it's not exactly on the list
12:37 - maybe we'll have those appear as an
12:38 - overlay maybe not but certainly it will
12:42 - become if I could just get back ok this
12:46 - lav mic thing does not fit in my pajama
12:50 - bottoms yes I might be wearing it
12:52 - because it's one of the things that
12:54 - allows me to get to a dressed up at
12:57 - 11:00 I think you shower I comb my hair
12:59 - [Laughter]
13:05 - I have to say here's the wonderful thing
13:07 - about this I one of the things I'm
13:10 - really enjoying about this strange time
13:11 - that we're living in it's complicated
13:13 - and tricky as it might be is learning
13:16 - new stuff with my kids my daughter is
13:18 - obsessed with parrots so I learned so
13:21 - much about parrots day even so much that
13:22 - I took a walk to the Greenwood Cemetery
13:24 - I live not too far away from the
13:26 - Greenwood Cemetery here in Brooklyn New
13:27 - York where there is a nest of Monk
13:30 - parrots
13:30 - and there's all sorts interesting
13:31 - stories of how they ended up there I
13:33 - won't go to too much about this but I
13:35 - saw the monk parrots today and OH Juan
13:39 - Carlos Ponce come Poussin oh and there's
13:42 - some new members there's so much going
13:44 - on welcome new members and friendly
13:54 - super chats there's absolutely no reason
13:56 - why you should join the coding train as
13:58 - a membership or pay money for a super
14:02 - chat I really should just disable that
14:03 - but it is most appreciated by yours
14:07 - truly and with your membership you have
14:10 - won yourself a random number thirty two
14:15 - thousand eight hundred and nine what I
14:18 - was saying about the parrots well I
14:21 - don't want to go on and on about the
14:22 - parrots but I'm pleased joying my day
14:24 - times and doing this late night hour of
14:28 - live-streaming it makes me feel like I'm
14:30 - doing something in my so-called
14:33 - professional professiona now as I like
14:35 - to say life I owe
14:38 - Juan Carlos an email back about
14:41 - something you emailed me I think about
14:43 - the nature of codebook and I'm so like
14:46 - did I write back I don't remember but
14:47 - all of my thumb's are thumbs thing
14:50 - upping thumbs up with regard to
14:52 - everything that you said there I'm
14:53 - really really slow with email I would
14:57 - say these days but I'm just gonna always
14:58 - slow in it all right so I want to get
15:00 - started with this project that I want to
15:02 - make and so I think what so there's so
15:07 - much that I want to get to here and
15:08 - ultimately I have these Hewlett's behind
15:11 - me that blink I want to be able to
15:12 - control them from p5.js I want to get
15:15 - everything that I'm doing here available
15:16 - as the discord bought so once I've got
15:18 - this dad joke generator ai generator
15:22 - that could be a Bop you could ask for a
15:24 - new joke but for today let's just see if
15:26 - we can get it working so and we do have
15:33 - our countdown going the AI pumpkin
15:36 - generator is not active right now
15:39 - because I really meant to secure it
15:42 - during the day but I didn't have any
15:45 - time to do that because I don't do
15:47 - anything during the day but learn today
15:49 - I learned about what what's the math we
15:51 - were doing why can't I not remember oh
15:53 - yes we were the math that I did today
15:55 - was we had it was a it was a word
15:57 - problem where we had a truck and we had
16:00 - to save animals from the rainforest we
16:03 - could only hold ten thousand pounds in
16:05 - the truck and the animals weighed
16:06 - certain amounts we had to figure out
16:07 - what's the way we could get the most
16:09 - animals in the truck and not go over ten
16:11 - thousand pounds so instead of cleaning
16:14 - up the late night repo and adding time
16:16 - codes and getting the machine learning
16:18 - model so that's what I worked on today
16:20 - and I went to go see the barracks
16:22 - all right now and I should mention that
16:29 - if you want to ask questions or get help
16:33 - with your code or engage a little bit
16:34 - with the coding train community
16:36 - thank you David Friedman please huh it's
16:39 - blinking
16:40 - I'm so excited um please come and say
16:43 - hello in the discord which I will now
16:45 - post a link to in the chat okay so let's
16:48 - get going here so this
16:50 - is the website I Can Has dad joke you
16:54 - don't see it I'm gonna bring it up right
16:56 - now and there is an API so my plan is
17:01 - where do I find the API right so we can
17:05 - we can we can get another random joke
17:08 - why did the Clydesdale give the pony a
17:11 - glass of water because yeah that's about
17:20 - right okay so but I want to go straight
17:22 - to the home page and find the out go to
17:26 - the API and figure out how to use this
17:29 - API so my plan is first let me just get
17:31 - a p5 sketch asking for a joke and
17:35 - displaying it in the console like that's
17:36 - really all I want to do right now I just
17:38 - want to like figure out how's the AP API
17:39 - work then I want to build maybe a node
17:42 - node script that'll just get like a
17:45 - thousand I don't know how many I mean
17:46 - maybe there's some way and when
17:47 - somebody's looking into this whoa I'm
17:49 - live-streaming maybe there's some way I
17:51 - could just download the full database of
17:52 - dad jokes from this API but oh and I
17:56 - could even just use curl that's
17:57 - interesting so I could probably write a
17:58 - script but anyway so but I want to do
18:01 - this in JavaScript then I want to create
18:02 - a big text file with as many dad jokes
18:06 - as I can possibly fit and then I'm going
18:09 - to train a machine learning model with
18:12 - all of that data and see if I can
18:14 - generate some new jokes all within the
18:16 - next 43 minutes yeah prathamesh writes
18:26 - in the chat automate the random number
18:29 - giving tradition so that when anyone
18:31 - becomes a member it does the work
18:35 - so one thing by the way does anybody
18:37 - know if CJ is still streaming um so a
18:40 - friend of the show coding garden with CJ
18:43 - wonderful channel I noticed was
18:45 - live-streaming maybe like an hour or so
18:47 - ago and the reason why I thought of this
18:51 - is I want to do some stuff with the
18:53 - YouTube chat API but I hear it's kind of
18:55 - like a big pain to deal with
18:56 - and I I probably should just move to
18:59 - streaming on twitch but I'm just gonna
19:02 - keep saying that I'm probably never
19:04 - actually do it but so I'm a little bit
19:08 - hesitant to work with the YouTube chat
19:10 - API but I think that that's why I kind
19:14 - of want to use the discord as sort of
19:17 - like the chat that we can interact with
19:18 - okay
19:18 - so everyone's telling me that CJ is
19:21 - still streaming so hopefully uh yeah I
19:23 - highly recommend right now go to twitch
19:28 - let's actually just go to coding dot
19:30 - garden and this is the coding garden and
19:36 - maybe coding garden on YouTube here I
19:39 - don't know why there's not a link to the
19:41 - twitch here because that I believe is
19:45 - where coding garden streams but if we go
19:49 - right here we can bring up so this is
19:52 - where you should be going to learn this
19:54 - is where you should be going to learn
19:55 - stuff and have watch a sensible live
19:59 - stream with people with actual notes is
20:01 - that coming through all right I'm gonna
20:02 - look at this green screen so many
20:04 - wonderful things are okay but I'm gonna
20:05 - keep going with what I'm doing you can
20:07 - choose to stay and make no guarantees
20:13 - all right so first thing we're gonna do
20:16 - is I have got I have got a p5 web editor
20:21 - sketch and we get rid of draw I'm gonna
20:25 - see if I can fetch a joke just with this
20:27 - load JSON function so the load Jason so
20:31 - I'm gonna buy at some point if I'm
20:32 - really doing this every night I don't
20:37 - know if it really makes sense for me to
20:39 - like explain what p5 is over and over
20:42 - and over again but just very quickly p5
20:44 - is a JavaScript library for creative
20:45 - coding find out more p5 JSON org
20:47 - it's from the processing Foundation
20:49 - which is a nonprofit that I do a lot of
20:51 - work with and I encourage you to learn
20:54 - more about all that stuff I know I know
20:59 - oh I remember I remember this was my new
21:05 - [Music]
21:08 - thank you to the members there we go
21:11 - okay but all right all right everyone I
21:15 - forgot all of my new tricks and bits all
21:18 - right so now here we go so if I go over
21:22 - to the API it looks like I can just
21:28 - throw myself over here a fetch a random
21:30 - dad joke except application JSON except
21:39 - as text interesting the end point will
21:44 - only ever return there's a slack app hmm
21:47 - as JSON J joke idea oh so there's a
21:52 - specific joke ID that's interesting /j
21:57 - fetching joke is text as an image that's
22:00 - interesting search oh oh so could we
22:04 - search and just get a whole bunch total
22:09 - jokes 307 total pages 15 and we have to
22:12 - learn about oh well this is what I
22:15 - should just do just to get a whole bunch
22:19 - right like if I see that this is
22:22 - possible doesn't this mean that I could
22:25 - just go to like I term for example oh my
22:33 - goodness I have not set this up yet so
22:37 - one thing that's a little bit of an
22:38 - issue is that Owen this silly can I get
22:41 - rid of that overlay here no or like
22:44 - could can I move it around let's just I
22:46 - don't know there's a clock I'll put it
22:48 - right onto the clocks gonna be nicely
22:49 - redundant well look CJ is here or CJ is
22:54 - watching my stream well I just got a
22:56 - message from CJ I made this Express API
23:00 - that turns the YouTube live chat atapi
23:02 - into a socket IO API why is it that
23:06 - anytime I ever want anything in the
23:07 - world
23:08 - CJ has made it yesterday I thought
23:11 - wouldn't be nice if I had just a list of
23:14 - the coding train color palette and then
23:17 - like a website appeared within like less
23:19 - than five minutes maybe I'd see J
23:22 - everybody's subscribed okay oh shut up
23:27 - all right so here we go
23:29 - there's a few things that I really
23:31 - really require you did reveal to yours
23:34 - to use
23:38 - let's let's let's get crackin here
23:46 - setting up I turn where's the small tiny
23:53 - preferences that I need doesn't look
23:58 - anything like what I want profiles reuse
24:01 - previous sessions directory this is a
24:03 - very important setting that I must now I
24:09 - will go to text
24:15 - [Music]
24:17 - twenty-four points is my favorite
24:18 - size
24:21 - [Music]
24:24 - that work
24:26 - does that change anything
24:30 - and the other thing that I must have the
24:34 - setting that I love the most they will
24:37 - stick with enormous a penis that makes
24:39 - my coding life complete is whenever I
24:42 - resize the window
24:44 - no no whenever I resize the font using
24:46 - it keep them in don't want the window to
24:48 - change its size
24:49 - look how horrible it is when that
24:51 - happens those well can I make it yeah
24:52 - right and look wait look at that the
24:57 - window is getting bigger I do not want
25:00 - that to happen I cannot tolerate it
25:02 - could not tolerate it so I must go here
25:06 - and behind the setting window
25:10 - arrangement
25:12 - oh wait window terminal session advance
25:19 - [Music]
25:24 - somebody must know somebody must know
25:28 - [Music]
25:34 - yeah
25:38 - no no selection window I found it
26:02 - oh right I just uncheck this and
26:06 - everything is great look at that pick up
26:11 - a guy can make the fun
26:12 - [Music]
26:19 - this is awesome right now I'm getting a
26:22 - lot done here 35 minutes left people I'm
26:25 - almost to the point where I have the
26:27 - fonts it's set in my terminal
26:31 - so speaking of C maybe I'll pick a
26:36 - different twitch channel or YouTube
26:40 - channel or coding something or other to
26:42 - refer to constantly in tomorrow tomorrow
26:44 - night did I say that I was gonna be back
26:46 - tomorrow night
26:46 - oof but I do happen to know that CJ
26:50 - recently did a video all about setting
26:52 - up their new dev environment and I
26:55 - wanted to follow all of those steps but
26:57 - I think for a lack of a better idea
26:59 - right now I'm gonna very very quickly
27:02 - get oh my zsh which is the shell the sh
27:11 - s the shell that i like to use and this
27:12 - is a particular configuration of it that
27:15 - has some nice syntax highlighting and
27:18 - various things so I'm going to paste
27:19 - this in and it should be there now that
27:24 - looks good I think it can be a little
27:26 - bit bigger
27:27 - I can't a little smaller that is I can
27:29 - see where I am what is going on with the
27:31 - font all right so now we're good
27:34 - why was I oh right I was on the this
27:38 - let's see if this curl command works so
27:44 - that works so in the one hand I could
27:45 - just I could skip everything that I'm
27:47 - doing right now just to send this into a
27:52 - text file I mean so how do isn't there a
27:55 - way that you do something fancy where
27:57 - you do this and then you do this and you
27:59 - say like file dot txt like right over
28:02 - here there's some kind of like pipe the
28:05 - results of this into a file this can't
28:07 - possibly be right right like what I've
28:09 - got over there can't possibly be right
28:11 - but let's let's try it well it did
28:13 - something oh look at that okay well
28:19 - first of all for you to be able to see
28:20 - this I don't really have my layout stuff
28:22 - going well
28:24 - look at that it's there if Kat will show
28:27 - me what the contents of the file are
28:28 - whoops huh okay that worked
28:33 - that worked alright so let me open this
28:38 - up let me look at this file so here is
28:41 - now a text this is what I need to train
28:43 - my machine learning model okay I enjoy
28:56 - this way too much what did one night say
29:03 - this is what I've not heard before what
29:06 - did one not say as he chased another nut
29:09 - I'm a cashew okay now the question is if
29:18 - I do this again if I do this again where
29:28 - how come my commands not there if I do
29:32 - this again and I say like file 2 dot txt
29:38 - do I have the same jokes file 1 yes so I
29:46 - got a do like I got to do pagination
29:49 - through it so I really should do let's
29:53 - let's get it as JSON because I want to
29:55 - see so are there really only 307 jokes
29:58 - no 650 with the total pages of 32 so I
30:07 - could in theory get all 650 of these
30:11 - jokes so you know what let's skip the
30:13 - whole p5 step where I was gonna use lo
30:17 - JSON and just display one joke we got to
30:19 - move along here it's already 11:30 p.m.
30:21 - at night and I didn't go to sleep till 2
30:23 - a.m. last night I mean I finished at
30:25 - 1:30 I think I finished at one thing no
30:27 - no 12:30 no I went to sneak up one I
30:30 - don't even remember what time it was I
30:31 - was just wandering aimlessly throughout
30:33 - the house bumping into things let's
30:40 - throw caution to the wind and do
30:42 - something perhaps ill advisable but fun
30:45 - times
30:46 - let's go and set up a node script to do
30:49 - this so the way that I'm going to do
30:52 - that is let's let's just head over to
30:54 - the desktop let's make a directory
30:59 - called joke scraper and we will say NPM
31:06 - in it so this is the point of the
31:09 - program where I say now note is the
31:12 - thing that's blah blah blah and PS the
31:14 - thing that blah blah blah but it's late
31:16 - at night don't be fooled by the tie that
31:18 - I'm wearing I cannot possibly begin to
31:20 - explain any of that but I do have a set
31:22 - of video tutorials most notably I would
31:24 - probably recommend you take a look at my
31:26 - working with data and api's serious so
31:28 - I'm kind of jumping into the middle of
31:30 - that by creating a quick node a node
31:33 - project and you know interestingly
31:35 - enough it would be interesting I kind of
31:36 - want to do some stuff with deploying
31:37 - stuff to glitch but getting out of
31:39 - myself
31:39 - NPM in it and the way that I like to use
31:42 - NPM NIT is like this okay I think I
31:46 - could enter enough times I did learn
31:49 - probably from CJ this is the channel
31:53 - where you watch somebody who does all
31:55 - the coding stuff incorrectly in case
31:57 - you're wondering that there's a way that
31:59 - you can set up a template but I've got
32:00 - this now I'm going to open up in Visual
32:03 - Studio code that worked apparently had
32:06 - already installed this I'm gonna get my
32:09 - code open here I've got package.json
32:11 - let's make the font size bigger here now
32:14 - this is where I really would like to go
32:18 - and this is where I would definitely
32:22 - like to go and take a look at what CJ
32:24 - did in setting up Visual Studio code
32:26 - time for that because it's 11:30 right
32:30 - now get this moving it's gonna take like
32:33 - two hours to train the machine learning
32:36 - didn't pre-baked one usually if I'm
32:38 - doing something with training process is
32:41 - gonna take a long time I will pre do it
32:43 - and then like go through the steps but
32:44 - not this time all right let's make a do
32:49 - whatever it wants us to do we're gonna
32:51 - make a new index.js file and now what I
32:55 - want to do is use fetch along with a
32:59 - sink and a weight
33:00 - which is all stuff that I've covered in
33:01 - my video tutorials to get this exact
33:07 - page but I want to see this page in my
33:12 - node code so let's give that a try oh my
33:32 - god oh my god that's four spaces if that
33:34 - four spaces are a tab or something no no
33:40 - no stop stop
33:42 - chain into two spaces my whole life no
33:45 - chief you change convert two spaces I
33:48 - [Music]
33:53 - fix this thanks everybody the four
33:56 - spaces they scare me it's too many I
33:58 - know some people find it comforting but
34:00 - I go
34:04 - will you help me will you help me I
34:08 - can't go on look at the clock just
34:10 - ticking away ticking away ticking away
34:13 - aah
34:16 - violet has this really excellent idea
34:19 - which is that I don't think I'm gonna do
34:21 - that this this round but I could make a
34:25 - conversational like chatbot by
34:28 - segmenting out the joke and the
34:31 - punchlines and so I could actually that
34:35 - would be great for you to ask a question
34:37 - to the bot and it would try to give you
34:39 - a funny answer I love that idea
34:41 - click on it select spaces option then
34:44 - select two spaces okay I can handle this
34:48 - everybody click change view okay all
35:00 - right here we go so we're gonna make
35:04 - this an async function Oh fetch isn't
35:09 - natively a node right is there some new
35:11 - thing called like Axios that I'm
35:13 - supposed to use I saw that flying across
35:15 - the screen one day as I was sitting at
35:19 - my computer I don't really know what
35:20 - that is but I might learn about it
35:22 - fetch where is this
35:27 - fetch this know if this is gonna give me
35:33 - JSON I'm gonna wait this fetch
35:49 - let's see if this works
35:59 - so now what do I need to install I think
36:02 - it was like no fetch that I use let's
36:04 - look we're working with data and api's
36:07 - coding train look at this how convenient
36:12 - these nice tutorials
36:20 - but I want to see once I start using
36:22 - node server sided with node post with
36:25 - fetch this one will definitely have it
36:28 - let's look at the code
36:36 - looks like what I used was note fetch so
36:41 - that's what I'll use
36:54 - okay
36:55 - so that should have added that too yep
37:01 - note fetch is added there and also yeah
37:14 - so let's try running this well my lights
37:20 - are blinking we have a new member hi
37:26 - welcome to the coding train all aboard
37:29 - on the night train it's a quiet place a
37:33 - strange place a place with people like
37:35 - me who feel confused why are they here
37:40 - what's the point of it all do I even
37:43 - know what I'm doing this thing didn't
37:46 - work at all
37:50 - but you've joined and I thank you and
37:53 - for that I would like to offer you a
37:56 - random number which is 80 1754
38:10 - [Music]
38:12 - now why didn't this work ref fetch is
38:18 - not defined oh so I can't just install
38:22 - node fetch and suddenly use fetch I also
38:25 - visit but this is the point of the book
38:28 - them I've just copy pasting code from
38:31 - previous things that I alright so I need
38:35 - to make sure I have the require
38:36 - statement because I'm using this
38:38 - particular library okay we've got
38:51 - something so that's good can I is it
38:55 - actually in JSON format let's see
39:03 - let's take a look and see if this works
39:05 - so now I could convert it to JSON and
39:06 - here we go so I think that I don't know
39:15 - how with fetch to tell it to do this
39:21 - thing is this some kind of like header
39:24 - header I must need a header yeah I've
39:28 - done that before that's a thing
39:30 - so maybe the - H means these are the
39:32 - headers and this is telling me to give
39:33 - me back the data in JSON so let's see
39:41 - fetch with headers using fetch fetch
39:50 - there fetch a weight fetch your ah so I
39:55 - can put an object in like this as the
39:58 - second argument so let's try this let's
40:07 - make a variable called options and
40:17 - I should say oh wait a wait fetch and
40:20 - just pass in the options and then I
40:24 - don't need to worry about any of this
40:28 - but what's what's going on here okay I
40:33 - need this for headers whoa that's right
40:38 - yeah and the header that I want must be
40:41 - I'm assuming where's that page oh here
40:51 - it is
40:53 - accept application JSON and no idea if
40:58 - this is what I'm supposed to do except
41:02 - what we think what's the chance this is
41:05 - going to work
41:10 - all right now how do I tell it I want
41:15 - the next page so the current page is one
41:18 - the next page is two so I could say let
41:28 - I must I guess I could do some kind of
41:31 - loop here right I mean I kind of know
41:33 - this is silly so I probably should do
41:36 - the pagination more okay so the optional
41:39 - query string parameters so Oh max 30 so
41:44 - I might as well get 30 so let's just see
41:46 - if this works so I should be able to add
41:51 - let's just because of how hard it is to
41:54 - see all this code let's make a separate
41:57 - variable for the URL and then so that's
42:02 - the URL then let's add some query string
42:05 - stuff so I'm gonna use my template
42:09 - literal my absolute favorite thing in
42:11 - the world and question mark limit equals
42:24 - 30 well I could just do a string there I
42:29 - mean the reason why cuz I think I'm
42:31 - gonna change the page so let's just see
42:32 - what happens there okay
42:36 - so total pages is 21 right to my left or
42:39 - right or however you're looking at it
42:41 - total jokes is 650 so I want all the
42:47 - pages so so I think this is a little bit
42:52 - so this is not such a great idea but I
42:54 - think what I'm gonna do is just hard
42:58 - code in make this back to a string
43:01 - literal and page equals and then I'm
43:04 - gonna have a counter like I and out here
43:07 - I will put a nice little loop and we're
43:13 - starting with page 1 and we go all the
43:16 - way up to page 21 I would assume
43:19 - I plus plus I can type yes I can and now
43:30 - what console.log that oh I don't have
43:32 - any sort of auto format on save it's
43:35 - okay
43:36 - I can manually I could make the
43:38 - indentation whatever I like there we go
43:41 - there we go some fun here we go
43:48 - alright this seems to be working
43:50 - I'm getting all the pages came through
43:52 - so the jokes all come in a property
44:00 - called results so all I need to do is
44:03 - once I have the results I want to say
44:06 - let jokes equals json dot results for
44:11 - every look I'm gonna I'm gonna throw a
44:14 - caution to the wind you'll never see me
44:15 - do this you think you're gonna think
44:17 - like what's what's what's he gonna do
44:19 - what's that coding train Dan person on
44:23 - the internet going to do he is going to
44:25 - write a for loop with a counter no jokes
44:29 - dot for each that's right for each I'm
44:32 - using a higher-order JavaScript function
44:35 - for each joke I'm using an arrow syntax
44:40 - is that how it works is yeah no yeah
44:49 - yeah yeah for each joke then I want to
44:52 - have an array called all jokes and I'm
44:56 - gonna say all jokes dot push joke then I
45:02 - want a console.log all jokes I'm feeling
45:08 - a little bit like I need some music okay
45:12 - who knows if this is correct cuz I never
45:16 - use for each next thing you know I'll be
45:18 - using some kind of what are these things
45:20 - called oh so late it's almost midnight
45:29 - the pumpkins are coming to me
45:31 - well joke needs to be in parentheses I
45:33 - don't think so I think Jo doesn't need
45:35 - to be in parentheses if there's only one
45:37 - argument to the function we'll see
45:39 - alright here we go oh whoops
45:45 - this doesn't look good oh no no no but I
45:48 - want the text of the joke it worked
45:51 - I want joke joke this is so funny
46:02 - the more times I can write joke the more
46:04 - it'll be funny no all right
46:10 - all of the jokes then now all I need to
46:16 - do is say at the end here let's make
46:23 - this
46:28 - what's this doing all in here then what
46:31 - I'm going to do is say I need file
46:33 - system so node has a built in a file
46:38 - system module and I believe I can say
46:42 - file system right file sink
46:47 - [Music]
46:56 - right file I like to use right file sync
46:59 - because I don't believe in asynchronous
47:01 - functions only use them what I have to
47:03 - and it needs the file and a data and
47:06 - some options so the options might must
47:10 - be like the encoding the data is all the
47:13 - jokes and the file is my file name so
47:15 - I'm going to say jokes dot txt
47:20 - I want to write out all jokes but I want
47:22 - to join them
47:23 - I think there's looks like in the array
47:25 - there were already like carriage returns
47:28 - and line breaks so I don't think I need
47:29 - to add that in oh no no that's if it's a
47:36 - oh look at that
47:37 - oh wait a sec no no no no I need to
47:41 - separate out mmm
47:43 - shoot all right I'm gonna have to think
47:46 - about this because I thought I could
47:49 - have every joke so I think I need to
47:52 - actually remove so what I what I really
47:57 - want to do is eventually be very
47:58 - thoughtful about cleaning and preparing
48:00 - this data set and understanding that
48:03 - jokes can be multi line and each joke I
48:05 - have like a specific separator between
48:07 - the jokes I think runway allows me to
48:10 - have my own separator so let's create
48:12 - our own let's see if this works with
48:15 - creating our own separator so I am going
48:18 - to join them all with dollar sign dollar
48:20 - sign dollar sign parenthesis so this is
48:23 - going to be my own separator in that's
48:26 - going to mark each new joke eventually
48:29 - if there's a call in response to the
48:30 - joke I might want to separate those but
48:32 - let's just do that and I want to have
48:34 - the file format be utf-8 which you know
48:37 - has something to do with it being plain
48:38 - text so let's see if this works out I
48:42 - don't need to console.log the jokes
48:44 - anymore and looks like we've got a text
48:52 - file and it's got a bunch of jokes in it
48:55 - with these weird separators all around
48:58 - okay so this looks pretty good time for
49:02 - us to first of all
49:04 - I do have a pot of tea for my Highclere
49:09 - Castle mug like by the way so my laptop
49:14 - computer is literally right below these
49:18 - two objects this is a horrific idea and
49:26 - by the way the reason why oh my god just
49:30 - hit the soundbar by accident the reason
49:32 - why this laptop computer has no stickers
49:34 - on it whatsoever is because I spilled
49:38 - liquid all over it I had to send it to
49:40 - be repaired and they supposedly it's the
49:44 - same machine but the entire screen this
49:48 - sort of like section of it was replaced
49:50 - so if you have any good stickers you
49:53 - want to send me or suggest that I
49:55 - purchase they have like you know
49:57 - rainbows and are colorful with like
49:59 - flowers and you know the stuff that I
50:01 - love you know what I like okay let's
50:11 - let's bring up runway
50:18 - and so runway is a piece of software
50:24 - that allows me to work with various
50:26 - machine learning models and it has a new
50:28 - feature which allows you to train a
50:30 - model you do have to have a subscription
50:32 - to runway in order to be able to do the
50:34 - training but I want to train a new text
50:40 - model I'm gonna call this a dad joke
50:44 - generator and I'm going to look at all
50:50 - of the other weird data sets that I
50:51 - already have here I meant to create a
50:53 - totally separate account for a live
50:56 - streaming but whatever I am going to get
51:00 - this jokes file the data set is too
51:04 - small no I insist
51:09 - trade my model anyway I don't care isn't
51:16 - really not gonna let me oh this hope lad
51:19 - is going terribly you think you think
51:28 - you could defeat me you can't defeat me
51:31 - I will defeat you yeah it's right
51:34 - remember that shuffle function I wrote
51:36 - yesterday oh yeah yeah
51:39 - just watch this yeah I've got you now
51:45 - look at me creating lots of extra data
51:48 - by just duplicating my data over and
51:50 - over again in a different order which
51:52 - makes no sense because it's all
51:53 - segmented alright so hold on here we go
51:59 - let's just say let's do this
52:04 - one hundred times have to make this work
52:11 - how to not do machine learning correctly
52:16 - how to not speak in English language
52:19 - okay alright now we're gonna make our
52:23 - text file quite a bit bigger by putting
52:28 - all the seat jokes in there under times
52:30 - that's right
52:32 - I mean how come how come run away
52:34 - clothes did I close it I'm a train a
52:40 - model it's gonna be text we're going to
52:46 - call this dad jokes I'm going to upload
52:53 - my much larger joke dataset now it's
52:58 - very happy look at it look how long if
53:00 - that's a huge file oh my goodness whoa I
53:04 - have so many jokes I have five megabytes
53:08 - of jokes amazing next so I need to use a
53:13 - data set separator which I thought let
53:18 - me do a custom one let me do a custom
53:23 - one I have this memory be able to do
53:25 - that
53:41 - [Music]
53:54 - all right so I got to go back and redo
53:56 - this let's do it this way let's have all
54:02 - the jokes replace I forgot how to use
54:16 - replace in JavaScript
54:25 - [Music]
54:27 - well I can use a regular expression I
54:30 - just say replace I think all I want to
54:33 - do is replace wherever there is what was
54:39 - it was it slash are slash end with
54:42 - nothing and then I'm gonna had join the
54:47 - text just with a line break so we'll use
54:50 - a line break as a separator
54:57 - [Music]
55:03 - okay let's take a look at this file
55:08 - [Music]
55:12 - alright this looks good every joke is on
55:14 - a new line there was the one there was
55:17 - one that was multi-line
55:19 - [Music]
55:29 - well I'm like why are they the jokes the
55:30 - same wait a second here
55:40 - [Music]
55:42 - hold on SEC I'm tired is the first joke
55:48 - and then it's the third no no no no no
55:51 - no oh because it repeats the first set
55:56 - of jokes multiple No
55:57 - hold on a second here yes I'm not - I'm
56:04 - duplicating it in the array over and
56:06 - over again all right all right everybody
56:08 - all right we're gonna I think we're good
56:10 - okay now back back we're going to delete
56:19 - this data set we're going to get it
56:23 - again and we've got our jokes next and
56:30 - then the data separator is definitely a
56:34 - line and training time oh yeah estimated
56:40 - trading time an hour it's okay I got
56:42 - four and a half minutes okay here we go
56:50 - okay here we go
56:57 - let's let's see what happens it's so I
57:00 - need to I think I may need to turn the
57:01 - air conditioner open the open a window
57:06 - all right your experiment is starting
57:10 - this can take a few minutes
57:18 - hmm what can I do while we're waiting
57:22 - let's let's take a look at my list of
57:27 - projects that I want to work on I felt
57:30 - like this went better last night
57:35 - [Music]
57:36 - hold on let's let's uh let's take a
57:41 - little break for a minute while I am
57:44 - letting this go so we're gonna have a
57:46 - quick intermission I will be right back
57:48 - in just two minutes
58:17 - [Music]
58:39 - all right so I'm really waiting for this
58:42 - ETA to appear and according to my I
58:47 - should just admit that this stream goes
58:49 - until 12:30 right soon we're gonna find
59:00 - out how long it's gonna take
59:38 - I'm reading the chat please
59:51 - [Music]
59:59 - oh hi yes oh all right
60:04 - so violet writes as soon as you say it
60:11 - goes till 12:30 it'll start um
60:15 - let's look into some other stuff while
60:17 - we're waiting for this to go let me look
60:18 - at my list here because I'm gonna need
60:21 - to figure out some stuff so um a couple
60:25 - things I could work on I could start
60:26 - trying to download all my YouTube
60:27 - transcripts but let's look I think I
60:29 - want to get this thing further along
60:31 - live poll overlay would be a large
60:34 - project if I could add a minimum sort of
60:39 - start to begin looking at how I would
60:41 - control these hue lights behind me and
60:46 - that could be interesting to try also
60:49 - like what was that where did CJ let's
60:55 - look at CJ's YouTube live chat API let's
60:58 - take a look at that real quick I think
61:00 - that could be a useful thing for me to
61:02 - take a quick peek at so I think if I go
61:05 - to github.com slash coding garden is our
61:09 - two G's encoding garden that's an
61:11 - interesting question I there is oh wow
61:13 - let's let's take some time to look at
61:17 - these vs code settings let's look at
61:20 - these all right so these are oh this is
61:23 - a lot of stuff for me two settings I'm
61:28 - totally overwhelmed keybindings okay I
61:30 - can't I can't deal I can't handle this
61:32 - it's too much for me but maybe these are
61:39 - some things I do like is I do like the
61:41 - bracket pair colorizer
61:45 - so maybe I will grab that one let's
61:49 - install that while I'm here okay let's
61:55 - open this up let's install that and
61:59 - probably what I really want to install
62:04 - is get something to do like some nice
62:06 - code formatting for me
62:08 - yes Lin so I think I want to integrate
62:10 - es lint for sure
62:14 - so let's install that okay now do I need
62:22 - beautify as well if I have es lint okay
62:28 - I guess I do want beautify so let's
62:31 - install that and then I think the
62:38 - setting that I want is the format on
62:41 - save which sometimes I turn it off but
62:46 - I'm going to put that in and let's just
62:49 - see now if okay good all right what
62:54 - happens if I do this yes okay so I've
62:57 - got a few more things set up in Visual
62:59 - Studio code learn about multiple cursors
63:03 - in vs code writes Chris they will blow
63:06 - your mind
63:13 - all right house how's that how's the how
63:16 - are things going in runway
63:28 - we'll see we'll see alright now what was
63:38 - Oh
63:39 - let's start looking into the hue lights
63:41 - so one of my colleagues at New York
63:45 - University teaches a class called light
63:48 - and interactivity so and has a set of
63:52 - tutorials about how to control hue
63:54 - lights so let's I think let's see if I
64:01 - can find this so let's take a look here
64:09 - like hue control I think this is what
64:12 - I'm looking for
64:13 - yep okay this is perfect so to get
64:17 - started programming hue apps you'll need
64:19 - a hue hub I have that you'll want a hue
64:23 - account too I have that keep the hue
64:27 - developer site handy every hue has a
64:30 - debug interface available at this
64:33 - replace the address with your hub's IP
64:38 - address so now the question is I think
64:42 - if I use my local network IP address
64:45 - here in a live stream there's nothing
64:47 - anybody can do with that so I should be
64:49 - able to grab microphone I'm wondering if
65:01 - I have a Google like Wi-Fi mesh network
65:05 - thing and I wonder if I look at my Wi-Fi
65:10 - app if I can get the IP address of the
65:12 - hue hub so unfortunately you can't see
65:16 - what I'm looking at right now but it is
65:17 - finding all the devices or 23 devices
65:22 - and I see I see a bunch of devices I'm
65:28 - looking for one that says hue hub
65:30 - Philips hue Philips hue bridge is that
65:34 - the same as the hub
65:35 - looking at that details I have its IP
65:38 - address so let me take this oh wait
65:45 - obviously I need to now I need to go and
65:47 - replace this with the local network IP
65:50 - address which is one ninety two dot one
65:55 - sixty eight dot eighty 6.35 alright
66:01 - awesome I've got the hue API debugger
66:06 - right here
66:07 - cool oh you know cuz I made the text
66:13 - file large that's why it's taking a long
66:15 - time yeah this by the way the machine
66:18 - learning model is not gonna work well
66:20 - I'm gonna need to do something more
66:22 - extensive to get more jokes so if you
66:26 - have ideas for that you can let me know
66:29 - file them as issues so if you have more
66:31 - I need to build up a joke and I please
66:35 - family-friendly jokes
66:37 - I don't want stuff that's obnoxious
66:39 - that's mean-spirited family-friendly
66:42 - jokes I will manually curate them I
66:44 - think in the end but if you go to the
66:49 - late night repo I can I'm gonna file an
66:55 - issue here need more jokes I am building
67:00 - a database a dataset of jokes dad jokes
67:08 - family friendly the work the the more
67:15 - grown inducing the better wait please
67:26 - help me with links to places I can find
67:31 - more starting with 650 from here I can
67:41 - has dad joke alright so you can add some
67:46 - comments or ideas beer beer
67:49 - jokes are welcome definitely beer jokes
67:51 - are quite welcome alright so now looking
67:53 - back at this you can send you can use
68:00 - this to send API commands to the hub to
68:02 - test things out so what's the first kind
68:06 - of API command I can send device type my
68:11 - app username new username okay
68:17 - API device type my app so if I put this
68:26 - in there and then press a link button on
68:34 - the hub and click post oh I have to go
68:38 - press the link button on the hub okay so
68:46 - I have to walk over to the hub and press
68:48 - the button do you think that's gonna
68:53 - work I'm gonna walk over to the hub and
68:55 - then I click put what happens I just
68:57 - click post right now okay unauthorized
68:59 - user okay alright I am going to take my
69:04 - microphone and walk over to where the
69:06 - hub is it's in the next room I assume
69:09 - you can still hear me I'm walking over
69:13 - to it walking over to it quietly and
69:16 - pressing the button you can hear me
69:19 - press the button you press the button
69:21 - nothing happened on it do I need to hold
69:24 - down the button more well I'm gonna walk
69:26 - back walking back and now oh oh oh right
69:38 - I was reminded here that I needed to get
69:42 - rid of this one two three four and now
69:44 - let's do post AHA username now this is
69:48 - probably something I shouldn't be
69:49 - showing you do you think I mean I don't
69:55 - understand why and how you would use
69:58 - this because it's I don't think maybe
70:01 - it's accessible from
70:03 - sigh but I don't know this seems like a
70:05 - bad idea that I have this on the screen
70:06 - so I'll just leave it much longer to
70:08 - make sure I give you as much time it's
70:09 - possible the type at all eh all right so
70:14 - I did that
70:18 - now you user command and then ah okay to
70:29 - turn on light one so let's see if I can
70:31 - do this so so I want to get all of the
70:34 - so now I can do on now I can put that
70:36 - user and I've already shown it to you so
70:39 - I'm sure I can reset this value so this
70:42 - goes now here that's my username and
70:47 - then I could put something like lights
70:51 - and it's going and click get and it'll
70:58 - tell me the state of all my lights ok so
71:02 - I am going to click get but before I
71:05 - click cat I'm going to just put myself
71:08 - here and so that just in case it has
71:13 - some like private information doesn't
71:17 - really look like yeah so there's it
71:19 - doesn't look like there's anything
71:20 - really private here there's just a lot
71:23 - of information I can kind of like show
71:25 - you I'm gonna look for the coding train
71:27 - because I have some lights called coding
71:29 - tray and there we go all right so I'm
71:31 - going to come back to here and so up
71:34 - here you can see I have an extended
71:36 - color light called coding train hue
71:40 - lightstrip plus that's what's actually
71:42 - right here behind me and this is some
71:45 - information about what color it is
71:48 - and so now if I go back to here to turn
71:55 - on how do I know what number it is on
72:01 - true so how do I know what number it is
72:03 - if it's light one what like light number
72:07 - is it is it do I go further up like five
72:12 - so it's light five
72:15 - ah look at this light five so now I
72:19 - believe it's late five so I'm gonna go
72:21 - here to like five and we'll go back to
72:25 - here and I'm gonna cheat change this to
72:34 - change this to 5
72:36 - yeah State user lights / 5 sorry / 5 /
72:49 - state and on true or on false
73:02 - so let's see and is it a poster again
73:06 - Oh put it's a put that's what's a put oh
73:15 - it went off oh my God look at this true
73:21 - okay look behind me oh boy
73:27 - so does this mean can I just how do I do
73:33 - a put with like HTTP on HTTP request
73:38 - there's an island out HTTP GET HTTP POST
73:43 - those are things I understand what's H
73:49 - what's a put put versus post uploading
73:57 - stuff to a particular overriding what is
73:59 - already post on there's way of
74:01 - submitting data so can I do a put method
74:12 - put no problem
74:22 - so absurdly I'm gonna go back to my node
74:26 - program and let's go to this is not
74:34 - gonna take that long actually for me to
74:35 - create a disk or bot that controls the
74:37 - lights which won't be happening tonight
74:39 - but that's that's what I do want to work
74:41 - well I'm gonna check on our jock trainer
74:43 - but I'm gonna create a light controller
74:50 - I'll just call it lights and as you know
75:01 - that's how I like to do my NPM in it hit
75:07 - enter as many times as I can
75:10 - we're gonna go to here I'm going to
75:13 - create index J s and now I'm going to do
75:18 - the same exact thing that I did in the
75:22 - joke scraper so I want to use probably
75:24 - fetch in the file system I'm gonna say
75:35 - like light on well here what am I doing
75:40 - here Hugh
75:43 - let's write a function async let's call
75:46 - to you and why is it back to four why is
75:55 - it back to four that's so sad somewhere
76:03 - there's a default in these settings okay
76:05 - node hue API oh I could just use the
76:10 - node hue API this is silly so I was
76:14 - gonna use fetch to do a put and probably
76:16 - if I kept reading Tom's page
76:22 - [Music]
76:27 - and it's probably
76:35 - let's look at this one I could use the
76:39 - node hue API so this probably makes more
76:46 - sense for me to use this right
76:59 - so I suppose but the think problem is
77:01 - I'd have to learn this ID IP address Oh
77:07 - interesting alright let's try using this
77:11 - so let's what is this called yes by
77:25 - repeater Marie has made this so why not
77:29 - just use this does this look like an L
77:31 - last commit six days ago that's a very
77:34 - good sign so I think it makes sense for
77:36 - me to look at this let's see we've got
77:41 - some nice information here I'm gonna
77:45 - install it so this is definitely
77:52 - something I'm going to come back to and
77:53 - work on more I kind of actually liked
78:04 - Tom's sort of simplified explanation
78:12 - because I can do this let's just see if
78:18 - I can get the basics I want to see if I
78:19 - can get a light to turn on and off then
78:26 - the pumpkins will come for me
78:34 - and so this is what should be an
78:38 - environment variable it's too late for
78:41 - me I'm gonna see if I can reset the
78:46 - username after tonight it's probably a
78:48 - way I can do that
78:49 - but I will just put it hard code it into
78:51 - my code right now
78:57 - and let's get the address which was this
79:10 - and then let's see if we can search for
79:16 - the bridges
79:31 - Oh
79:33 - oh I don't I don't need note fetch hue
79:41 - API is not a constructor huh well I'll
79:51 - have to look at the most recent
79:52 - documentation all right um
79:56 - so this is going okay I suppose let's
80:01 - see what's happening with our machine
80:02 - learning model
80:03 - oh it's been running for 23 minutes and
80:09 - it's already got a perplexity score of
80:11 - 40 point 44 oh it finished I waited long
80:17 - enough
80:18 - awesome okay let's see now if I can by
80:26 - the way I'm just curious did the
80:28 - perplexity get worse over time or better
80:30 - oh yeah look at this
80:32 - had this like why does all right so why
80:42 - does the moon rock tastes better than an
80:44 - Earth Rock because it's made of oatmeal
80:50 - I'm definitely gonna have to I'm
80:54 - definitely going to have to like
80:56 - automate the laugh track as well all
80:58 - right so here we go let's let's throw a
81:01 - caution to the wind and take I feel like
81:06 - I should take the model with the lower
81:07 - the the check point with the lower
81:10 - perplexity score so perplexity is a
81:13 - score it's similar to the means it's
81:18 - conceptually we can think of it similar
81:20 - to the way we think about loss so as a
81:22 - machine learning model is training that
81:24 - for doing image classification we would
81:26 - be saying like oh is it is it
81:27 - recognizing images when they're cats as
81:29 - cats and dogs as dogs perplexity is
81:32 - quite a bit different has to do with the
81:33 - way this GPT 2 model works but the same
81:36 - kind of metric applies if it's lower
81:38 - that's better
81:41 - so with it says here you can see with a
81:45 - small data set it is not
81:47 - common for perplexity score to increase
81:49 - over time this means your model is
81:51 - likely memorizing the data rather than
81:53 - learning to generalize patterns it
81:56 - extracts from it this is the case try
81:58 - gathering more data or saving the model
81:59 - using a check point from earlier so
82:01 - let's use this checkpoint I'm gonna
82:04 - click Next
82:05 - I'm gonna change the check point to the
82:10 - one from 250 I'm gonna say set as
82:14 - default then I'm going to add this to
82:18 - the workspace we're gonna call this oh I
82:21 - mean a new create a new workspace coding
82:23 - train late night so let's create this
82:28 - workspace and I've got my dad jokes
82:33 - model let's create an input source which
82:36 - is just text and let's run it remotely
82:40 - I'm gonna allow it to generate let's
82:44 - just so let's do use like the length of
82:45 - a tweet what's a tweet these days 280
82:47 - characters I forget what top P is oh
82:51 - it's like a cumulative probability above
82:54 - this number so a higher number is
82:58 - weirder stuff so I definitely want to
83:00 - keep the higher number and seed is just
83:03 - you know you if I give it the same
83:05 - prompt it will always give me exactly
83:07 - the same result unless I varied the seed
83:09 - so that's good so let's try let's try
83:13 - writing a joke why did the chicken why
83:21 - did the chicken get invited to dinners
83:24 - dinner was on me this couldn't possibly
83:32 - be better than 280 characters yeah so
83:36 - because we can make a Twitter bot that
83:38 - tells dad jokes that would be fun all
83:40 - right so let's randomize the seed and
83:43 - get another one why did the chicken get
83:46 - a penalty he took it for sage advice I
83:52 - like this little short laugh let's
83:56 - randomize the seed is good why did the
83:58 - chicken get a penalty he
84:00 - to go home with it yeah thank you thank
84:04 - you thank you all right
84:08 - so now what I want to do what was I
84:10 - gonna do with this right I guess I'm
84:15 - gonna generate my script
84:16 - so maybe what I quickly want to do is
84:24 - well all right all right
84:26 - it's twelve twenty three let's get this
84:31 - to be an overlay since that's the thing
84:33 - we're doing these days oh but I've got
84:36 - the same problem with the same security
84:37 - problem so I think what I need to do
84:41 - let's try it this way all right very
84:46 - very quickly let's see if we can host
84:48 - our let's see if we can talk to this
84:53 - machine learning model on glitch and I
84:57 - can store the secret key in an
84:59 - environment variable let's try that okay
85:03 - well this is a terrible idea
85:10 - I'm let me loss sign into glitch and I'm
85:14 - gonna switch to this for a second um
85:17 - here we go okay I'm signed in so I'm
85:23 - signed into glitch glitch if you're not
85:24 - familiar with I I generally like to use
85:26 - the p5 web editor as my go-to web editor
85:30 - but for writing code in the browser but
85:33 - if I want to have something that
85:34 - involves node and server-side
85:37 - programming p5 web editor doesn't have
85:39 - that capability but glitch does and then
85:43 - also one of the things oh look at this
85:44 - starter discord well I'll come back to
85:48 - that but one of the things that I can do
85:51 - is I can create a front end with p5.js
85:54 - to display the joke and I can have node
85:58 - fetch the new joke from the model in
86:01 - which case in which case what am I
86:07 - saying and I can keep that hidden so new
86:13 - projects
86:14 - we're gonna call this yeah let's do a
86:17 - simple I'm I'm always afraid to use
86:20 - these templates because it says a simple
86:21 - node app built on Express but oh it's
86:24 - people like what what one person's
86:27 - simple node app is another person's like
86:29 - headache but let's see how glitch does
86:31 - for it oh yes we're creating this
86:33 - project and I'm gonna call this dad dad
86:48 - dad dad jokes oh wow wow there's already
86:56 - a glitch project called dad joke
86:58 - generator well this is good for me to
87:00 - look dad joke eh I um let's call it that
87:07 - okay saved it let's go to environment
87:11 - variables ha comments are visible in
87:15 - remixes make sure there are no secrets
87:17 - in your comments the environment
87:19 - variables for storage secrets in your
87:21 - app like an API key any project member
87:23 - can see the contents but everyone and
87:25 - everyone else can just see the variable
87:27 - names perfect so what I want to do here
87:31 - is I'm gonna go to back to runway I'm
87:33 - gonna stop the model I'm gonna go back
87:37 - to the model where's that option to host
87:40 - it forgot where that is you info make I
87:48 - don't want to make this model public yet
87:49 - I want to host this model dad jokes and
87:55 - I don't know so it doesn't matter to me
87:58 - if you have the sub-domain as long as
88:00 - you don't have the secret key so let's
88:05 - grab this and I'm gonna host the model
88:09 - and deactivate it so now I'm going to go
88:15 - to a place where you cannot see my
88:19 - screen anymore and I'm gonna grab the
88:23 - token
88:26 - oh there's a hole well this is new okay
88:40 - hold on there's a hosted model library
88:46 - but is there a note so so one thing
88:50 - that's interesting here that I want to
88:52 - show you without let me grab the code
88:53 - let me grab this first private API key
89:02 - oh I can regenerate the API key so I
89:04 - definitely should do that from
89:05 - yesterday's okay so let's go back here
89:08 - and but when I do the morning show I
89:14 - really have to add this next week I was
89:16 - gonna change to a boarding show and do
89:18 - it at 7:00 a.m. Eastern but I have to
89:20 - stop it I can't go over but anyway
89:25 - alright so I'm sorry let me get back to
89:28 - my glitch environment variables and I'm
89:31 - going to put in code snippets JavaScript
89:40 - SDK Oh raw let's just use raw JavaScript
89:43 - yeah let's do that
89:46 - because so query the model so I've got
89:52 - that and I'm putting it in let me go
89:56 - back so I know you can't see what I'm
89:58 - doing I'm going to show you in a moment
89:59 - I promise and then oh hey I'm going to
90:05 - glitch back to glitch
90:15 - okay
90:20 - joke
90:30 - I should play some music right now cuz
90:34 - I'm not even talking to you give me a
90:37 - break it's 12:30
90:54 - alright
91:01 - I'm almost ready to show you exercise
91:04 - can show it to you right now so how do I
91:08 - make the font size much bigger I'll just
91:10 - zoom in so this is the code that I want
91:13 - to I want to create a route that if I
91:19 - say slash joke I get a joke back so the
91:27 - way that I do that is the the the secret
91:30 - token has to go here so I need a
91:35 - variable called token and that's the
91:44 - thing I can get out of the environment
91:45 - variables so like if it was just
91:49 - xxxxX I'll call it token and then I
91:55 - think I could just say oh I can just say
91:56 - process env token then in the code so is
92:02 - this there and then if I go to here I
92:08 - can actually just say where was I
92:12 - process env token so this is me putting
92:16 - in the secret token should appear here
92:19 - and now all I have to do is actually go
92:22 - and get that secret token that I don't
92:23 - want you to see and paste it right here
92:26 - in my code
93:36 - you
95:00 - test all right I am very sorry about
95:06 - that
95:08 - unfortunately the batteries died in this
95:12 - mic I will be more conscientious about
95:16 - making sure I have batteries that are
95:23 - fully charged before I begin so that
95:26 - doesn't happen again okay so I don't
95:36 - remember what I was talking about now
95:38 - but I now have Indian I can't click on
95:43 - this I will not oh I will not click on
95:48 - this I will not click on this my
95:50 - environment Oken for accessing the API
95:55 - is in this particular environment
96:01 - variable file so I should be able to
96:06 - just access it now through process env
96:09 - token and not have you see it so I don't
96:12 - need this I don't need this so there's I
96:19 - guess I can leave all this let's see
96:21 - there's a view I'm not going to do any
96:24 - of this nonsense but I guess all what's
96:29 - in public here script uh chess style
96:31 - Dutch yes you indexer cheese yeah okay
96:34 - so this this works okay so I can use
96:36 - this for the as the p5 sketch and this
96:41 - is my server code I know you can't see
96:44 - this how did anybody know on glitch how
96:46 - to enlarge the font size like where the
96:53 - Preferences format this file that's cool
96:57 - that's nice
97:06 - how do i how do I change the font sizes
97:18 - anybody know back to glitch new stuff I
97:25 - don't see a way to do it anyway let's
97:30 - look at the project should show up here
97:32 - I guess there's some errors maybe oh
97:38 - okay
97:39 - starting up and what I want to do is
97:45 - once I've got the generated text okay so
97:53 - I need a prompt why did I'm why I did
98:00 - the chicken then I need max characters
98:06 - should be 280 top P I want to say 0.9
98:13 - and this will eventually be a random
98:15 - number but let me just make it a
98:17 - thousand right now and then we should be
98:20 - able to fetch and then generate a text
98:23 - encountered and response dot send
98:28 - generated text so I should I probably
98:35 - should buy the pro glitch account so
98:38 - that this works now let's see show in a
98:47 - new window let's try this alright so
98:50 - hopefully this is going to appear at
98:52 - some point try enlarging browser font
98:59 - yeah I was trying to avoid that because
99:02 - I just want it's actually not even
99:05 - letting me do that
99:06 - is there an error like there's how do I
99:12 - find out if there's errors
99:14 - isn't there a console learn how to use
99:17 - this thing
99:21 - terminal aha oh cool Oh so I could
99:31 - actually just run some tests by running
99:33 - the terminal the console in the editor
99:36 - don't automatically sync you can
99:38 - manually one the Refresh command then it
99:40 - will force a refresh updating the editor
99:44 - mm-hmm
99:46 - server readme views why is this not like
99:52 - showing up hmm go to sleep
100:06 - glitch is having a major outage right
100:08 - now Oh hmm well that's not good
100:24 - major outage means all right I just want
100:37 - the jokes to appear all right we're
100:40 - gonna do this a different way we're
100:46 - gonna do this a different way trying to
100:51 - think of how this makes sense oh I have
100:53 - an idea here's how we're gonna get the
100:57 - overlay I mean
101:08 - yeah I think I can come back to this how
101:14 - do I want to finish today off return to
101:21 - the pumpkins oh I like to have I feel
101:28 - like I think I have this thing where I
101:29 - feel like I want to complete something
101:31 - whatever I got gonna complete is the
101:33 - wrong word I want to reach a sort of
101:36 - organic happy stopping point I have a
101:40 - little like thing appear on the screen
101:42 - and be done with it
101:44 - let's just actually get the joke to
101:47 - appear in p5 so we're gonna do it this
101:50 - way we're gonna go I'm gonna go back to
101:52 - runway and I'm not sure if what's being
101:55 - shown in runway right now so okay so I'm
101:57 - gonna deactivate my dad joke model and
102:00 - then go back to my workspace and I am
102:04 - going to run the model and then I'm
102:08 - gonna grab that code and just I'm just
102:13 - gonna run it locally so here I am with
102:17 - the model running locally and I can go
102:20 - to network and I can go to JavaScript
102:23 - and I can do oh I did this yesterday
102:26 - didn't I
102:27 - so let's just go back to open up our
102:32 - pumpkins and let's make this a
102:39 - [Music]
102:49 - what am i doing duplicate and we don't
102:55 - need any of this stuff we don't need any
102:59 - of this stuff all I want oh I forgot
103:03 - that I is this so let's grab all this
103:15 - stuff and I just want to get joke and ah
103:24 - wrong side sorry everybody
103:30 - now we don't want this model we want I'm
103:37 - going back to runway we want this I want
103:51 - to query it so what I'm doing is
104:01 - querying the model and the input
104:05 - specification is here is this stuff so
104:13 - we have why did the chicken we are going
104:23 - to we want to have 280 characters we
104:27 - want to have top PB 0.9 let's actually
104:31 - have this be a random number between 0
104:35 - and a thousand so it's a different seed
104:38 - we're gonna post this and got joke then
104:43 - we're going I'm going to say no canvas
104:44 - and function
104:51 - I've got joke results
104:56 - console dot log results so let's see if
105:01 - we can what's this
105:06 - let's see if we can get our joke to
105:11 - appear here in the console why does it
105:14 - have a little error here unrecoverable
105:16 - syntax error that's weird
105:19 - anybody see a syntax error I don't see
105:25 - one strip the semicolon oh yo this is
105:31 - the Sun this is there no semicolon there
105:33 - so this is the JavaScript object doesn't
105:35 - need a semicolon okay let's see if we
105:37 - can get the joke to appear
105:50 - okay oh oh I have to I have to get I
105:54 - have to call get a joke here we go
105:58 - everybody why did the chicken get a pill
106:05 - see he let out a little wine okay so
106:18 - this works and what I'm gonna say is
106:25 - create P results generated text okay so
106:35 - now we should see if I go to file share
106:43 - and get this full screen version but
106:48 - whoops nope that's not the one I want I
106:50 - want the present version why did the
106:56 - chicken coop ever go to school it was
106:58 - all toast why did the chicken get a
107:04 - penalty we let it go why did the chicken
107:10 - pay for his nap you let it go okay so I
107:17 - think let's improve this a little bit by
107:21 - mu let's improve this a little bit by
107:24 - creating an input text input
107:38 - and let's to let joke so oh let's say
107:49 - joke paragraph and so I'm just gonna
107:53 - make a couple Dom elements with nothing
107:56 - in them we'll start with this so this is
108:02 - a little interface here where I can type
108:04 - in a prompt and then it will get the the
108:09 - chicken go to the bathroom it was tender
108:16 - but now what I want is for anytime I'm
108:22 - typing I think that's input dot let's
108:29 - call this prompt from I think the event
108:34 - is actually the event function was
108:37 - called input I could just do changed so
108:39 - whenever I hit enter but let's do what's
108:42 - called get joke and so get joke will now
108:46 - get prompt is it dot value or dot HTML I
108:51 - think it's dot value so I'm gonna get
108:53 - whatever is in the prompt and so now
109:02 - yeah so we're going to oh it's oh no I
109:08 - then I want to update I don't want to do
109:10 - create P I want to say joke P dot HTML
109:16 - and give me the results so let's go back
109:19 - over to here and we're going to type the
109:28 - coding train the coding tray ologists
109:35 - work in concert they teach people 3d
109:38 - printing they teach people to make
109:41 - sprite movements
109:44 - so you might wonder like what how could
109:48 - this possibly have come up with anything
109:50 - related to 3d printing well the truth
109:53 - here is what I'm actually doing is I'm
109:56 - the process of training the model when I
109:59 - was fine-tuning an existing model so
110:02 - maybe tomorrow night when I come back I
110:06 - could talk more a bit about what GPT 2
110:09 - is how it was trained and the process of
110:12 - fine-tuning but I'm there's a lot of
110:14 - existing knowledge it has based on a
110:17 - huge data set of text and the jokes that
110:20 - I'm feeding it are kind of steering it
110:21 - in the direction of what I wanted to
110:23 - generate so why did the chicken is a
110:24 - good like you know why did the fish say
110:28 - hello heaven oh and then so I guess I
110:36 - can't how do I guess I a button would
110:38 - make sense
110:39 - so let's actually let me just change one
110:41 - thing about this let's make a button and
110:52 - and then what I'm actually going to do
110:55 - is the button when it's pressed will get
110:59 - the new joke so why why does Pizza taste
111:09 - bad for you because all the toppings you
111:12 - get
111:25 - why does chocolate do it for lunch no
111:32 - chips
111:33 - it's the munch oh I'm so tired
111:44 - dot dot dot dot dot in this economy why
111:54 - did the for loop why did the for loop
111:58 - succeed because it just took longer to
112:00 - get from first to second base why did
112:13 - the if statement be false because it was
112:18 - [Applause]
112:25 - why did my code short for lunch catch up
112:36 - yeah how else is very good um I like how
112:39 - light disabled this can you please
112:50 - disable go away yes thank you
112:54 - also let's see let's see
113:02 - I like these like coding jokes coder my
113:09 - code is broken see if it figures out how
113:13 - to do like a like no no it thinks that's
113:17 - the end let's get rid of the period no
113:22 - whoops whoops I lost that alright let's
113:29 - try
113:33 - why did my code break because the
113:39 - changing because why - Mike Oh brick
114:02 - somebody's been stealing for my
114:03 - workstation do you have any suspicious
114:05 - files in there thanks it was a catch cuz
114:20 - it was trying to figure out how to use
114:21 - ghastly functions ghastly okay thank you
114:30 - everybody I really appreciate you
114:34 - joining me for this total and complete
114:36 - nonsense I think now what I would like
114:43 - to do
114:45 - music is turn this into a discord bot
114:50 - because we could ask a questions like
114:55 - where are you
114:58 - [Music]
115:00 - why are you
115:04 - and it could respond and say like should
115:09 - I use a for-loop because that's where it
115:15 - gets messy it is true it prints see
115:18 - takes one sign it takes some time I
115:20 - think nothing but an int it really
115:26 - generates excellent punchlines really
115:39 - really good so I think we could make
115:42 - this much better I think I've stumbled
115:45 - on some gold here we could make this
115:47 - much better I don't know why I was gonna
115:49 - play that III got to say goodbye we
115:52 - could make this much better by working
115:53 - on a better dataset and retraining the
115:56 - model and also I think if a lot of the
115:59 - jokes like as violet suggested if I want
116:03 - to like really think of it as very
116:04 - conversational I could work on building
116:07 - in a my own so I think actually maybe
116:12 - what I was thinking is there isn't a
116:16 - there isn't necessarily a option for a
116:21 - custom delimiter in runway but if what I
116:23 - did was always insert I'm hearing like
116:30 - music somewhere some kind of like
116:31 - delimiter here I could train the model
116:34 - to kind of understand the difference
116:35 - between the question and the answer okay
116:44 - so I'm really hearing some weird noise
116:47 - coming from somewhere it's like freaking
116:50 - out a little bit
116:51 - let's I'm just curious if glitch came
116:52 - back still says major outage let's see
117:01 - if it comes back
117:13 - alright doesn't appear to be coming back
117:15 - so this is this is where we are for
117:18 - tonight this is my ending point let's
117:19 - finish with a little quick round of
117:22 - jokes by the way now I'm realizing that
117:24 - I can't mix sounds on my sound board so
117:27 - I feel like it would be useful to be
117:29 - able to have some nice backgrounds where
117:32 - I tell jokes along with you laughter but
117:36 - this way I've the sound board so I only
117:38 - played one sound at a time but I think
117:39 - that this ultimately this bot or web
117:42 - application whatever should happen
117:43 - should someone should speak the jokes
117:45 - and include a laugh track there's so
117:46 - many possibilities here so I let me take
117:49 - some suggestions from the chat for
117:51 - prompts right now so I'm going to wait
117:53 - for you to give me some suggestions for
117:57 - prompts which I will use
118:01 - [Music]
118:31 - why did Dan tell them to have a good day
118:34 - cool toast like why did the robot why
118:44 - did the robot fall on the side he fell
118:46 - on the side they were funny earlier
118:48 - I like the coding one sitting snort
118:51 - really well
118:54 - why does recursion take place in front
119:00 - of you who know G what does the Fox say
119:06 - is pretty good okay I think what I'll do
119:18 - is I'm going to say goodbye and I should
119:22 - let this I should leave you with this
119:27 - generating jokes so I'll generate jokes
119:29 - for a little while for you here and play
119:37 - you out with some music and I am doing
119:39 - this tomorrow will be the last
119:40 - late-night coding train of this week I
119:43 - was kind of thinking of doing it Tuesday
119:45 - Wednesday Thursday night so three nights
119:47 - a week at 11 p.m.
119:48 - although next week I think I might try
119:51 - Monday Tuesday Wednesday morning so I
119:52 - want to do three streams a week I come
119:56 - up with this my plan is planned so I'll
119:59 - see you tomorrow night I just have to
120:00 - say it so that I commit to being here so
120:03 - subscribe if you want to like get a
120:05 - reminder you have to do the like
120:06 - subscribe and bail thing but really
120:08 - could just join the discord what today
120:11 - HTTP GET is a really good one this is a
120:16 - really good one can you see the whole
120:21 - thing yet
120:33 - there we go that's what I'm looking for
120:35 - okay so see you tomorrow
120:39 - everybody we'll be back in just doing
120:41 - more am I turn this into a disk or pot
120:44 - my try to get the hue lights going we'll
120:46 - see please contribute please if you
120:50 - can't only got a suit one a.m. please if
120:53 - you can contribute to the repo if you
120:56 - want to add ideas or places that data
120:59 - suits data sources oh god I can't talk
121:02 - it's the night at the
121:38 - [Music]
122:21 - I'm gonna do this stuff this stock this
122:23 - dog the starter this starts I'll never
122:26 - forget the Vista
122:49 - [Music]
123:10 - auto-tuned and the Internet
123:26 - [Music]
123:39 - [Music]
123:43 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
123:46 - else is there yes kids thank you very
123:51 - much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes
123:52 - notice that look what I get I'm really
123:55 - losing my mind okay
124:00 - [Music]
124:14 - [Music]
125:02 - [Music]
125:13 - I feel just sort of like a nice feeling
125:17 - of relaxation everything's gonna be okay
125:19 - today dream is not broken it has not
125:22 - frozen this isn't this is a wonderful
125:24 - thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really
125:27 - getting to something I need my sound
125:32 - [Music]
125:48 - that was invalid syntax i forgot i will
125:55 - use continuously over and over
125:58 - all sorts of text generation analysis
126:01 - things that I will use continuously over
126:04 - and over again first you need to do
126:09 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

oh hello and good evening welcome to another late night edition of the coding train with me internet weirdo dan Schiffman now I had earlier today Oh plan and thought about what I was gonna say at the very moment I'd switch the camera over myself and I completely forgot what it was right now you know I actually have enough room here on this table in between the camera and where I'm sitting that it could have like a little bit of a teleprompter so again I'm looking for some writers to write me some scripts that I will read to you actually better yet ultimately the plan here eventually is for me to just have an AI model a machine learning model generate the script for me so that's that's coming I mean I it'll make oh you might think that will make any sense but it's it's hard to not make nearly as much sense as I don't make Cheers so as with most latenight shows this is not a show nor it is late at night oh boy I can't bring myself to do this why don't skeletons ride rollercoasters they don't have the stomach for it why does a moon rock taste better than an earth rock well I don't like this one because it's a little meteor I feel like you know some of you might that one's no good let's boo that one good what do you call a fake noodle and imposter what time is it I don't know it keeps changing actually fortunately here we go we've got our countdown clock going because as you know once it gets to zero o'clock I turn into a creepy looking AI artificial intelligence pumpkin all right I don't think I'll go with this anymore we need to get ourselves centered we need to feel ready that we can be here together in moments here to make some fun interesting coding projects late at night from my home here in Brooklyn my children are fast asleep to be honest I seriously doubt they're asleep but they're in their room quiet I can't hear them they can hear me apparently last night I was told yeah we can hear you you're kind of loud so there it is but just before they went to bed I got out my usual night time reading the book a million random digits with one have't 103d is 12 it is way past your bedtime young person 3d hmm oh I hear something so all of you who are past your bedtime and just about to go to sleep I will now read to you from my book of random numbers thirty four thousand nine hundred and ninety sixty two thousand one hundred and twenty two oops oops oops we have to take a break here Lucas Chang Lucas Chang what was it that I was using yesterday for the member what it was this breaking news we have a message from Lucas Chang Lucas Chang says thank you well thank you Lucas Chang this random number goes out to you 2639 fortyfour thousand two hundred and seventy three fifty seven thousand six hundred and seventy eight thirty four thousand five hundred and fifteen fourteen thousand one hundred and seventy six ninety one thousand five hundred fifty to eighty nine thousand four hundred and twenty four fifteen thousand two hundred and thirty six fifty three thousand nine hundred and fortyseven and thirty four thousand four hundred and fortyeight well I like to read from my book of random numbers at the start of my coding train the night train late night with the coding train just to make sure that if you're watching you have the chance to leave tomorrow actually one thing that I said yesterday I said that if you come back tomorrow you can actually check the video's description and they'll be time codes in there and the time codes might indicate where something that you might actually want to watch happened unfortunately didn't get to that with yesterday's show so maybe maybe it will be true tomorrow maybe it won't it's really I really don't know I just don't know this ginger tea is delicious I'm drinking it out of my Highclere Castle hug yes I have a hiker class all right so what is this why are you here why are you watching this I don't know like I've said probably too many times at this point I encourage you to go to bed some of you interestingly enough might just be waking up in the morning depending on where you are in the world you might be having your morning coffee a little I don't know morning toast whatever you eat for breakfast I wish you a wonderful day exercise meditate I'm not sure but if you choose to stay with me here for the next 51 minutes I can't see the chat anymore I've got to fix this there we go Anthony is asking if I'm okay you know it's a really weird thing to be by yourself in a room with some bright lights on you a camera your computer feeling like there are a few hundred people watching and you really have no idea what to say or what to do one of these days maybe I will have my act together and I will have a plan and a script and segments and all those things but for now I'm just here and the the idea here with coding train late at night just to switch you over to my laptop for a second is that I have a list of sort of strange weird projects I'm interested in working on they are found in this coding train latenight github repository and last night we made the midnight pumpkin alarm so I can add myself here so oh but it's over there look at this I had this fixed last night this wasn't working the midnight pumpkin alarm which was right above me and I had a suggestion here thank you too let's pull up this pull request which has now been merged from Joe Pesci Joe Parris who says add ideas for using I Can Has dad joke to fetch a joke as a discord bot command and possibly displaying that joke on screen during the stream and oh that is a great idea but I think I could do one better here so my goal for tonight by the end of tonight is to have a machine learning model generating new dad jokes so that's what we are here to make it's not exactly on the list maybe we'll have those appear as an overlay maybe not but certainly it will become if I could just get back ok this lav mic thing does not fit in my pajama bottoms yes I might be wearing it because it's one of the things that allows me to get to a dressed up at 1100 I think you shower I comb my hair [Laughter] I have to say here's the wonderful thing about this I one of the things I'm really enjoying about this strange time that we're living in it's complicated and tricky as it might be is learning new stuff with my kids my daughter is obsessed with parrots so I learned so much about parrots day even so much that I took a walk to the Greenwood Cemetery I live not too far away from the Greenwood Cemetery here in Brooklyn New York where there is a nest of Monk parrots and there's all sorts interesting stories of how they ended up there I won't go to too much about this but I saw the monk parrots today and OH Juan Carlos Ponce come Poussin oh and there's some new members there's so much going on welcome new members and friendly super chats there's absolutely no reason why you should join the coding train as a membership or pay money for a super chat I really should just disable that but it is most appreciated by yours truly and with your membership you have won yourself a random number thirty two thousand eight hundred and nine what I was saying about the parrots well I don't want to go on and on about the parrots but I'm pleased joying my day times and doing this late night hour of livestreaming it makes me feel like I'm doing something in my socalled professional professiona now as I like to say life I owe Juan Carlos an email back about something you emailed me I think about the nature of codebook and I'm so like did I write back I don't remember but all of my thumb's are thumbs thing upping thumbs up with regard to everything that you said there I'm really really slow with email I would say these days but I'm just gonna always slow in it all right so I want to get started with this project that I want to make and so I think what so there's so much that I want to get to here and ultimately I have these Hewlett's behind me that blink I want to be able to control them from p5.js I want to get everything that I'm doing here available as the discord bought so once I've got this dad joke generator ai generator that could be a Bop you could ask for a new joke but for today let's just see if we can get it working so and we do have our countdown going the AI pumpkin generator is not active right now because I really meant to secure it during the day but I didn't have any time to do that because I don't do anything during the day but learn today I learned about what what's the math we were doing why can't I not remember oh yes we were the math that I did today was we had it was a it was a word problem where we had a truck and we had to save animals from the rainforest we could only hold ten thousand pounds in the truck and the animals weighed certain amounts we had to figure out what's the way we could get the most animals in the truck and not go over ten thousand pounds so instead of cleaning up the late night repo and adding time codes and getting the machine learning model so that's what I worked on today and I went to go see the barracks all right now and I should mention that if you want to ask questions or get help with your code or engage a little bit with the coding train community thank you David Friedman please huh it's blinking I'm so excited um please come and say hello in the discord which I will now post a link to in the chat okay so let's get going here so this is the website I Can Has dad joke you don't see it I'm gonna bring it up right now and there is an API so my plan is where do I find the API right so we can we can we can get another random joke why did the Clydesdale give the pony a glass of water because yeah that's about right okay so but I want to go straight to the home page and find the out go to the API and figure out how to use this API so my plan is first let me just get a p5 sketch asking for a joke and displaying it in the console like that's really all I want to do right now I just want to like figure out how's the AP API work then I want to build maybe a node node script that'll just get like a thousand I don't know how many I mean maybe there's some way and when somebody's looking into this whoa I'm livestreaming maybe there's some way I could just download the full database of dad jokes from this API but oh and I could even just use curl that's interesting so I could probably write a script but anyway so but I want to do this in JavaScript then I want to create a big text file with as many dad jokes as I can possibly fit and then I'm going to train a machine learning model with all of that data and see if I can generate some new jokes all within the next 43 minutes yeah prathamesh writes in the chat automate the random number giving tradition so that when anyone becomes a member it does the work so one thing by the way does anybody know if CJ is still streaming um so a friend of the show coding garden with CJ wonderful channel I noticed was livestreaming maybe like an hour or so ago and the reason why I thought of this is I want to do some stuff with the YouTube chat API but I hear it's kind of like a big pain to deal with and I I probably should just move to streaming on twitch but I'm just gonna keep saying that I'm probably never actually do it but so I'm a little bit hesitant to work with the YouTube chat API but I think that that's why I kind of want to use the discord as sort of like the chat that we can interact with okay so everyone's telling me that CJ is still streaming so hopefully uh yeah I highly recommend right now go to twitch let's actually just go to coding dot garden and this is the coding garden and maybe coding garden on YouTube here I don't know why there's not a link to the twitch here because that I believe is where coding garden streams but if we go right here we can bring up so this is where you should be going to learn this is where you should be going to learn stuff and have watch a sensible live stream with people with actual notes is that coming through all right I'm gonna look at this green screen so many wonderful things are okay but I'm gonna keep going with what I'm doing you can choose to stay and make no guarantees all right so first thing we're gonna do is I have got I have got a p5 web editor sketch and we get rid of draw I'm gonna see if I can fetch a joke just with this load JSON function so the load Jason so I'm gonna buy at some point if I'm really doing this every night I don't know if it really makes sense for me to like explain what p5 is over and over and over again but just very quickly p5 is a JavaScript library for creative coding find out more p5 JSON org it's from the processing Foundation which is a nonprofit that I do a lot of work with and I encourage you to learn more about all that stuff I know I know oh I remember I remember this was my new thank you to the members there we go okay but all right all right everyone I forgot all of my new tricks and bits all right so now here we go so if I go over to the API it looks like I can just throw myself over here a fetch a random dad joke except application JSON except as text interesting the end point will only ever return there's a slack app hmm as JSON J joke idea oh so there's a specific joke ID that's interesting /j fetching joke is text as an image that's interesting search oh oh so could we search and just get a whole bunch total jokes 307 total pages 15 and we have to learn about oh well this is what I should just do just to get a whole bunch right like if I see that this is possible doesn't this mean that I could just go to like I term for example oh my goodness I have not set this up yet so one thing that's a little bit of an issue is that Owen this silly can I get rid of that overlay here no or like could can I move it around let's just I don't know there's a clock I'll put it right onto the clocks gonna be nicely redundant well look CJ is here or CJ is watching my stream well I just got a message from CJ I made this Express API that turns the YouTube live chat atapi into a socket IO API why is it that anytime I ever want anything in the world CJ has made it yesterday I thought wouldn't be nice if I had just a list of the coding train color palette and then like a website appeared within like less than five minutes maybe I'd see J everybody's subscribed okay oh shut up all right so here we go there's a few things that I really really require you did reveal to yours to use let's let's let's get crackin here setting up I turn where's the small tiny preferences that I need doesn't look anything like what I want profiles reuse previous sessions directory this is a very important setting that I must now I will go to text twentyfour points is my favorite size that work does that change anything and the other thing that I must have the setting that I love the most they will stick with enormous a penis that makes my coding life complete is whenever I resize the window no no whenever I resize the font using it keep them in don't want the window to change its size look how horrible it is when that happens those well can I make it yeah right and look wait look at that the window is getting bigger I do not want that to happen I cannot tolerate it could not tolerate it so I must go here and behind the setting window arrangement oh wait window terminal session advance somebody must know somebody must know yeah no no selection window I found it oh right I just uncheck this and everything is great look at that pick up a guy can make the fun this is awesome right now I'm getting a lot done here 35 minutes left people I'm almost to the point where I have the fonts it's set in my terminal so speaking of C maybe I'll pick a different twitch channel or YouTube channel or coding something or other to refer to constantly in tomorrow tomorrow night did I say that I was gonna be back tomorrow night oof but I do happen to know that CJ recently did a video all about setting up their new dev environment and I wanted to follow all of those steps but I think for a lack of a better idea right now I'm gonna very very quickly get oh my zsh which is the shell the sh s the shell that i like to use and this is a particular configuration of it that has some nice syntax highlighting and various things so I'm going to paste this in and it should be there now that looks good I think it can be a little bit bigger I can't a little smaller that is I can see where I am what is going on with the font all right so now we're good why was I oh right I was on the this let's see if this curl command works so that works so in the one hand I could just I could skip everything that I'm doing right now just to send this into a text file I mean so how do isn't there a way that you do something fancy where you do this and then you do this and you say like file dot txt like right over here there's some kind of like pipe the results of this into a file this can't possibly be right right like what I've got over there can't possibly be right but let's let's try it well it did something oh look at that okay well first of all for you to be able to see this I don't really have my layout stuff going well look at that it's there if Kat will show me what the contents of the file are whoops huh okay that worked that worked alright so let me open this up let me look at this file so here is now a text this is what I need to train my machine learning model okay I enjoy this way too much what did one night say this is what I've not heard before what did one not say as he chased another nut I'm a cashew okay now the question is if I do this again if I do this again where how come my commands not there if I do this again and I say like file 2 dot txt do I have the same jokes file 1 yes so I got a do like I got to do pagination through it so I really should do let's let's get it as JSON because I want to see so are there really only 307 jokes no 650 with the total pages of 32 so I could in theory get all 650 of these jokes so you know what let's skip the whole p5 step where I was gonna use lo JSON and just display one joke we got to move along here it's already 1130 p.m. at night and I didn't go to sleep till 2 a.m. last night I mean I finished at 130 I think I finished at one thing no no 1230 no I went to sneak up one I don't even remember what time it was I was just wandering aimlessly throughout the house bumping into things let's throw caution to the wind and do something perhaps ill advisable but fun times let's go and set up a node script to do this so the way that I'm going to do that is let's let's just head over to the desktop let's make a directory called joke scraper and we will say NPM in it so this is the point of the program where I say now note is the thing that's blah blah blah and PS the thing that blah blah blah but it's late at night don't be fooled by the tie that I'm wearing I cannot possibly begin to explain any of that but I do have a set of video tutorials most notably I would probably recommend you take a look at my working with data and api's serious so I'm kind of jumping into the middle of that by creating a quick node a node project and you know interestingly enough it would be interesting I kind of want to do some stuff with deploying stuff to glitch but getting out of myself NPM in it and the way that I like to use NPM NIT is like this okay I think I could enter enough times I did learn probably from CJ this is the channel where you watch somebody who does all the coding stuff incorrectly in case you're wondering that there's a way that you can set up a template but I've got this now I'm going to open up in Visual Studio code that worked apparently had already installed this I'm gonna get my code open here I've got package.json let's make the font size bigger here now this is where I really would like to go and this is where I would definitely like to go and take a look at what CJ did in setting up Visual Studio code time for that because it's 1130 right now get this moving it's gonna take like two hours to train the machine learning didn't prebaked one usually if I'm doing something with training process is gonna take a long time I will pre do it and then like go through the steps but not this time all right let's make a do whatever it wants us to do we're gonna make a new index.js file and now what I want to do is use fetch along with a sink and a weight which is all stuff that I've covered in my video tutorials to get this exact page but I want to see this page in my node code so let's give that a try oh my god oh my god that's four spaces if that four spaces are a tab or something no no no stop stop chain into two spaces my whole life no chief you change convert two spaces I fix this thanks everybody the four spaces they scare me it's too many I know some people find it comforting but I go will you help me will you help me I can't go on look at the clock just ticking away ticking away ticking away aah violet has this really excellent idea which is that I don't think I'm gonna do that this this round but I could make a conversational like chatbot by segmenting out the joke and the punchlines and so I could actually that would be great for you to ask a question to the bot and it would try to give you a funny answer I love that idea click on it select spaces option then select two spaces okay I can handle this everybody click change view okay all right here we go so we're gonna make this an async function Oh fetch isn't natively a node right is there some new thing called like Axios that I'm supposed to use I saw that flying across the screen one day as I was sitting at my computer I don't really know what that is but I might learn about it fetch where is this fetch this know if this is gonna give me JSON I'm gonna wait this fetch let's see if this works so now what do I need to install I think it was like no fetch that I use let's look we're working with data and api's coding train look at this how convenient these nice tutorials but I want to see once I start using node server sided with node post with fetch this one will definitely have it let's look at the code looks like what I used was note fetch so that's what I'll use okay so that should have added that too yep note fetch is added there and also yeah so let's try running this well my lights are blinking we have a new member hi welcome to the coding train all aboard on the night train it's a quiet place a strange place a place with people like me who feel confused why are they here what's the point of it all do I even know what I'm doing this thing didn't work at all but you've joined and I thank you and for that I would like to offer you a random number which is 80 1754 now why didn't this work ref fetch is not defined oh so I can't just install node fetch and suddenly use fetch I also visit but this is the point of the book them I've just copy pasting code from previous things that I alright so I need to make sure I have the require statement because I'm using this particular library okay we've got something so that's good can I is it actually in JSON format let's see let's take a look and see if this works so now I could convert it to JSON and here we go so I think that I don't know how with fetch to tell it to do this thing is this some kind of like header header I must need a header yeah I've done that before that's a thing so maybe the H means these are the headers and this is telling me to give me back the data in JSON so let's see fetch with headers using fetch fetch there fetch a weight fetch your ah so I can put an object in like this as the second argument so let's try this let's make a variable called options and I should say oh wait a wait fetch and just pass in the options and then I don't need to worry about any of this but what's what's going on here okay I need this for headers whoa that's right yeah and the header that I want must be I'm assuming where's that page oh here it is accept application JSON and no idea if this is what I'm supposed to do except what we think what's the chance this is going to work all right now how do I tell it I want the next page so the current page is one the next page is two so I could say let I must I guess I could do some kind of loop here right I mean I kind of know this is silly so I probably should do the pagination more okay so the optional query string parameters so Oh max 30 so I might as well get 30 so let's just see if this works so I should be able to add let's just because of how hard it is to see all this code let's make a separate variable for the URL and then so that's the URL then let's add some query string stuff so I'm gonna use my template literal my absolute favorite thing in the world and question mark limit equals 30 well I could just do a string there I mean the reason why cuz I think I'm gonna change the page so let's just see what happens there okay so total pages is 21 right to my left or right or however you're looking at it total jokes is 650 so I want all the pages so so I think this is a little bit so this is not such a great idea but I think what I'm gonna do is just hard code in make this back to a string literal and page equals and then I'm gonna have a counter like I and out here I will put a nice little loop and we're starting with page 1 and we go all the way up to page 21 I would assume I plus plus I can type yes I can and now what console.log that oh I don't have any sort of auto format on save it's okay I can manually I could make the indentation whatever I like there we go there we go some fun here we go alright this seems to be working I'm getting all the pages came through so the jokes all come in a property called results so all I need to do is once I have the results I want to say let jokes equals json dot results for every look I'm gonna I'm gonna throw a caution to the wind you'll never see me do this you think you're gonna think like what's what's what's he gonna do what's that coding train Dan person on the internet going to do he is going to write a for loop with a counter no jokes dot for each that's right for each I'm using a higherorder JavaScript function for each joke I'm using an arrow syntax is that how it works is yeah no yeah yeah yeah for each joke then I want to have an array called all jokes and I'm gonna say all jokes dot push joke then I want a console.log all jokes I'm feeling a little bit like I need some music okay who knows if this is correct cuz I never use for each next thing you know I'll be using some kind of what are these things called oh so late it's almost midnight the pumpkins are coming to me well joke needs to be in parentheses I don't think so I think Jo doesn't need to be in parentheses if there's only one argument to the function we'll see alright here we go oh whoops this doesn't look good oh no no no but I want the text of the joke it worked I want joke joke this is so funny the more times I can write joke the more it'll be funny no all right all of the jokes then now all I need to do is say at the end here let's make this what's this doing all in here then what I'm going to do is say I need file system so node has a built in a file system module and I believe I can say file system right file sink right file I like to use right file sync because I don't believe in asynchronous functions only use them what I have to and it needs the file and a data and some options so the options might must be like the encoding the data is all the jokes and the file is my file name so I'm going to say jokes dot txt I want to write out all jokes but I want to join them I think there's looks like in the array there were already like carriage returns and line breaks so I don't think I need to add that in oh no no that's if it's a oh look at that oh wait a sec no no no no I need to separate out mmm shoot all right I'm gonna have to think about this because I thought I could have every joke so I think I need to actually remove so what I what I really want to do is eventually be very thoughtful about cleaning and preparing this data set and understanding that jokes can be multi line and each joke I have like a specific separator between the jokes I think runway allows me to have my own separator so let's create our own let's see if this works with creating our own separator so I am going to join them all with dollar sign dollar sign dollar sign parenthesis so this is going to be my own separator in that's going to mark each new joke eventually if there's a call in response to the joke I might want to separate those but let's just do that and I want to have the file format be utf8 which you know has something to do with it being plain text so let's see if this works out I don't need to console.log the jokes anymore and looks like we've got a text file and it's got a bunch of jokes in it with these weird separators all around okay so this looks pretty good time for us to first of all I do have a pot of tea for my Highclere Castle mug like by the way so my laptop computer is literally right below these two objects this is a horrific idea and by the way the reason why oh my god just hit the soundbar by accident the reason why this laptop computer has no stickers on it whatsoever is because I spilled liquid all over it I had to send it to be repaired and they supposedly it's the same machine but the entire screen this sort of like section of it was replaced so if you have any good stickers you want to send me or suggest that I purchase they have like you know rainbows and are colorful with like flowers and you know the stuff that I love you know what I like okay let's let's bring up runway and so runway is a piece of software that allows me to work with various machine learning models and it has a new feature which allows you to train a model you do have to have a subscription to runway in order to be able to do the training but I want to train a new text model I'm gonna call this a dad joke generator and I'm going to look at all of the other weird data sets that I already have here I meant to create a totally separate account for a live streaming but whatever I am going to get this jokes file the data set is too small no I insist trade my model anyway I don't care isn't really not gonna let me oh this hope lad is going terribly you think you think you could defeat me you can't defeat me I will defeat you yeah it's right remember that shuffle function I wrote yesterday oh yeah yeah just watch this yeah I've got you now look at me creating lots of extra data by just duplicating my data over and over again in a different order which makes no sense because it's all segmented alright so hold on here we go let's just say let's do this one hundred times have to make this work how to not do machine learning correctly how to not speak in English language okay alright now we're gonna make our text file quite a bit bigger by putting all the seat jokes in there under times that's right I mean how come how come run away clothes did I close it I'm a train a model it's gonna be text we're going to call this dad jokes I'm going to upload my much larger joke dataset now it's very happy look at it look how long if that's a huge file oh my goodness whoa I have so many jokes I have five megabytes of jokes amazing next so I need to use a data set separator which I thought let me do a custom one let me do a custom one I have this memory be able to do that all right so I got to go back and redo this let's do it this way let's have all the jokes replace I forgot how to use replace in JavaScript well I can use a regular expression I just say replace I think all I want to do is replace wherever there is what was it was it slash are slash end with nothing and then I'm gonna had join the text just with a line break so we'll use a line break as a separator okay let's take a look at this file alright this looks good every joke is on a new line there was the one there was one that was multiline well I'm like why are they the jokes the same wait a second here hold on SEC I'm tired is the first joke and then it's the third no no no no no no oh because it repeats the first set of jokes multiple No hold on a second here yes I'm not I'm duplicating it in the array over and over again all right all right everybody all right we're gonna I think we're good okay now back back we're going to delete this data set we're going to get it again and we've got our jokes next and then the data separator is definitely a line and training time oh yeah estimated trading time an hour it's okay I got four and a half minutes okay here we go okay here we go let's let's see what happens it's so I need to I think I may need to turn the air conditioner open the open a window all right your experiment is starting this can take a few minutes hmm what can I do while we're waiting let's let's take a look at my list of projects that I want to work on I felt like this went better last night hold on let's let's uh let's take a little break for a minute while I am letting this go so we're gonna have a quick intermission I will be right back in just two minutes all right so I'm really waiting for this ETA to appear and according to my I should just admit that this stream goes until 1230 right soon we're gonna find out how long it's gonna take I'm reading the chat please oh hi yes oh all right so violet writes as soon as you say it goes till 1230 it'll start um let's look into some other stuff while we're waiting for this to go let me look at my list here because I'm gonna need to figure out some stuff so um a couple things I could work on I could start trying to download all my YouTube transcripts but let's look I think I want to get this thing further along live poll overlay would be a large project if I could add a minimum sort of start to begin looking at how I would control these hue lights behind me and that could be interesting to try also like what was that where did CJ let's look at CJ's YouTube live chat API let's take a look at that real quick I think that could be a useful thing for me to take a quick peek at so I think if I go to github.com slash coding garden is our two G's encoding garden that's an interesting question I there is oh wow let's let's take some time to look at these vs code settings let's look at these all right so these are oh this is a lot of stuff for me two settings I'm totally overwhelmed keybindings okay I can't I can't deal I can't handle this it's too much for me but maybe these are some things I do like is I do like the bracket pair colorizer so maybe I will grab that one let's install that while I'm here okay let's open this up let's install that and probably what I really want to install is get something to do like some nice code formatting for me yes Lin so I think I want to integrate es lint for sure so let's install that okay now do I need beautify as well if I have es lint okay I guess I do want beautify so let's install that and then I think the setting that I want is the format on save which sometimes I turn it off but I'm going to put that in and let's just see now if okay good all right what happens if I do this yes okay so I've got a few more things set up in Visual Studio code learn about multiple cursors in vs code writes Chris they will blow your mind all right house how's that how's the how are things going in runway we'll see we'll see alright now what was Oh let's start looking into the hue lights so one of my colleagues at New York University teaches a class called light and interactivity so and has a set of tutorials about how to control hue lights so let's I think let's see if I can find this so let's take a look here like hue control I think this is what I'm looking for yep okay this is perfect so to get started programming hue apps you'll need a hue hub I have that you'll want a hue account too I have that keep the hue developer site handy every hue has a debug interface available at this replace the address with your hub's IP address so now the question is I think if I use my local network IP address here in a live stream there's nothing anybody can do with that so I should be able to grab microphone I'm wondering if I have a Google like WiFi mesh network thing and I wonder if I look at my WiFi app if I can get the IP address of the hue hub so unfortunately you can't see what I'm looking at right now but it is finding all the devices or 23 devices and I see I see a bunch of devices I'm looking for one that says hue hub Philips hue Philips hue bridge is that the same as the hub looking at that details I have its IP address so let me take this oh wait obviously I need to now I need to go and replace this with the local network IP address which is one ninety two dot one sixty eight dot eighty 6.35 alright awesome I've got the hue API debugger right here cool oh you know cuz I made the text file large that's why it's taking a long time yeah this by the way the machine learning model is not gonna work well I'm gonna need to do something more extensive to get more jokes so if you have ideas for that you can let me know file them as issues so if you have more I need to build up a joke and I please familyfriendly jokes I don't want stuff that's obnoxious that's meanspirited familyfriendly jokes I will manually curate them I think in the end but if you go to the late night repo I can I'm gonna file an issue here need more jokes I am building a database a dataset of jokes dad jokes family friendly the work the the more grown inducing the better wait please help me with links to places I can find more starting with 650 from here I can has dad joke alright so you can add some comments or ideas beer beer jokes are welcome definitely beer jokes are quite welcome alright so now looking back at this you can send you can use this to send API commands to the hub to test things out so what's the first kind of API command I can send device type my app username new username okay API device type my app so if I put this in there and then press a link button on the hub and click post oh I have to go press the link button on the hub okay so I have to walk over to the hub and press the button do you think that's gonna work I'm gonna walk over to the hub and then I click put what happens I just click post right now okay unauthorized user okay alright I am going to take my microphone and walk over to where the hub is it's in the next room I assume you can still hear me I'm walking over to it walking over to it quietly and pressing the button you can hear me press the button you press the button nothing happened on it do I need to hold down the button more well I'm gonna walk back walking back and now oh oh oh right I was reminded here that I needed to get rid of this one two three four and now let's do post AHA username now this is probably something I shouldn't be showing you do you think I mean I don't understand why and how you would use this because it's I don't think maybe it's accessible from sigh but I don't know this seems like a bad idea that I have this on the screen so I'll just leave it much longer to make sure I give you as much time it's possible the type at all eh all right so I did that now you user command and then ah okay to turn on light one so let's see if I can do this so so I want to get all of the so now I can do on now I can put that user and I've already shown it to you so I'm sure I can reset this value so this goes now here that's my username and then I could put something like lights and it's going and click get and it'll tell me the state of all my lights ok so I am going to click get but before I click cat I'm going to just put myself here and so that just in case it has some like private information doesn't really look like yeah so there's it doesn't look like there's anything really private here there's just a lot of information I can kind of like show you I'm gonna look for the coding train because I have some lights called coding tray and there we go all right so I'm going to come back to here and so up here you can see I have an extended color light called coding train hue lightstrip plus that's what's actually right here behind me and this is some information about what color it is and so now if I go back to here to turn on how do I know what number it is on true so how do I know what number it is if it's light one what like light number is it is it do I go further up like five so it's light five ah look at this light five so now I believe it's late five so I'm gonna go here to like five and we'll go back to here and I'm gonna cheat change this to change this to 5 yeah State user lights / 5 sorry / 5 / state and on true or on false so let's see and is it a poster again Oh put it's a put that's what's a put oh it went off oh my God look at this true okay look behind me oh boy so does this mean can I just how do I do a put with like HTTP on HTTP request there's an island out HTTP GET HTTP POST those are things I understand what's H what's a put put versus post uploading stuff to a particular overriding what is already post on there's way of submitting data so can I do a put method put no problem so absurdly I'm gonna go back to my node program and let's go to this is not gonna take that long actually for me to create a disk or bot that controls the lights which won't be happening tonight but that's that's what I do want to work well I'm gonna check on our jock trainer but I'm gonna create a light controller I'll just call it lights and as you know that's how I like to do my NPM in it hit enter as many times as I can we're gonna go to here I'm going to create index J s and now I'm going to do the same exact thing that I did in the joke scraper so I want to use probably fetch in the file system I'm gonna say like light on well here what am I doing here Hugh let's write a function async let's call to you and why is it back to four why is it back to four that's so sad somewhere there's a default in these settings okay node hue API oh I could just use the node hue API this is silly so I was gonna use fetch to do a put and probably if I kept reading Tom's page and it's probably let's look at this one I could use the node hue API so this probably makes more sense for me to use this right so I suppose but the think problem is I'd have to learn this ID IP address Oh interesting alright let's try using this so let's what is this called yes by repeater Marie has made this so why not just use this does this look like an L last commit six days ago that's a very good sign so I think it makes sense for me to look at this let's see we've got some nice information here I'm gonna install it so this is definitely something I'm going to come back to and work on more I kind of actually liked Tom's sort of simplified explanation because I can do this let's just see if I can get the basics I want to see if I can get a light to turn on and off then the pumpkins will come for me and so this is what should be an environment variable it's too late for me I'm gonna see if I can reset the username after tonight it's probably a way I can do that but I will just put it hard code it into my code right now and let's get the address which was this and then let's see if we can search for the bridges Oh oh I don't I don't need note fetch hue API is not a constructor huh well I'll have to look at the most recent documentation all right um so this is going okay I suppose let's see what's happening with our machine learning model oh it's been running for 23 minutes and it's already got a perplexity score of 40 point 44 oh it finished I waited long enough awesome okay let's see now if I can by the way I'm just curious did the perplexity get worse over time or better oh yeah look at this had this like why does all right so why does the moon rock tastes better than an Earth Rock because it's made of oatmeal I'm definitely gonna have to I'm definitely going to have to like automate the laugh track as well all right so here we go let's let's throw a caution to the wind and take I feel like I should take the model with the lower the the check point with the lower perplexity score so perplexity is a score it's similar to the means it's conceptually we can think of it similar to the way we think about loss so as a machine learning model is training that for doing image classification we would be saying like oh is it is it recognizing images when they're cats as cats and dogs as dogs perplexity is quite a bit different has to do with the way this GPT 2 model works but the same kind of metric applies if it's lower that's better so with it says here you can see with a small data set it is not common for perplexity score to increase over time this means your model is likely memorizing the data rather than learning to generalize patterns it extracts from it this is the case try gathering more data or saving the model using a check point from earlier so let's use this checkpoint I'm gonna click Next I'm gonna change the check point to the one from 250 I'm gonna say set as default then I'm going to add this to the workspace we're gonna call this oh I mean a new create a new workspace coding train late night so let's create this workspace and I've got my dad jokes model let's create an input source which is just text and let's run it remotely I'm gonna allow it to generate let's just so let's do use like the length of a tweet what's a tweet these days 280 characters I forget what top P is oh it's like a cumulative probability above this number so a higher number is weirder stuff so I definitely want to keep the higher number and seed is just you know you if I give it the same prompt it will always give me exactly the same result unless I varied the seed so that's good so let's try let's try writing a joke why did the chicken why did the chicken get invited to dinners dinner was on me this couldn't possibly be better than 280 characters yeah so because we can make a Twitter bot that tells dad jokes that would be fun all right so let's randomize the seed and get another one why did the chicken get a penalty he took it for sage advice I like this little short laugh let's randomize the seed is good why did the chicken get a penalty he to go home with it yeah thank you thank you thank you all right so now what I want to do what was I gonna do with this right I guess I'm gonna generate my script so maybe what I quickly want to do is well all right all right it's twelve twenty three let's get this to be an overlay since that's the thing we're doing these days oh but I've got the same problem with the same security problem so I think what I need to do let's try it this way all right very very quickly let's see if we can host our let's see if we can talk to this machine learning model on glitch and I can store the secret key in an environment variable let's try that okay well this is a terrible idea I'm let me loss sign into glitch and I'm gonna switch to this for a second um here we go okay I'm signed in so I'm signed into glitch glitch if you're not familiar with I I generally like to use the p5 web editor as my goto web editor but for writing code in the browser but if I want to have something that involves node and serverside programming p5 web editor doesn't have that capability but glitch does and then also one of the things oh look at this starter discord well I'll come back to that but one of the things that I can do is I can create a front end with p5.js to display the joke and I can have node fetch the new joke from the model in which case in which case what am I saying and I can keep that hidden so new projects we're gonna call this yeah let's do a simple I'm I'm always afraid to use these templates because it says a simple node app built on Express but oh it's people like what what one person's simple node app is another person's like headache but let's see how glitch does for it oh yes we're creating this project and I'm gonna call this dad dad dad dad jokes oh wow wow there's already a glitch project called dad joke generator well this is good for me to look dad joke eh I um let's call it that okay saved it let's go to environment variables ha comments are visible in remixes make sure there are no secrets in your comments the environment variables for storage secrets in your app like an API key any project member can see the contents but everyone and everyone else can just see the variable names perfect so what I want to do here is I'm gonna go to back to runway I'm gonna stop the model I'm gonna go back to the model where's that option to host it forgot where that is you info make I don't want to make this model public yet I want to host this model dad jokes and I don't know so it doesn't matter to me if you have the subdomain as long as you don't have the secret key so let's grab this and I'm gonna host the model and deactivate it so now I'm going to go to a place where you cannot see my screen anymore and I'm gonna grab the token oh there's a hole well this is new okay hold on there's a hosted model library but is there a note so so one thing that's interesting here that I want to show you without let me grab the code let me grab this first private API key oh I can regenerate the API key so I definitely should do that from yesterday's okay so let's go back here and but when I do the morning show I really have to add this next week I was gonna change to a boarding show and do it at 700 a.m. Eastern but I have to stop it I can't go over but anyway alright so I'm sorry let me get back to my glitch environment variables and I'm going to put in code snippets JavaScript SDK Oh raw let's just use raw JavaScript yeah let's do that because so query the model so I've got that and I'm putting it in let me go back so I know you can't see what I'm doing I'm going to show you in a moment I promise and then oh hey I'm going to glitch back to glitch okay joke I should play some music right now cuz I'm not even talking to you give me a break it's 1230 alright I'm almost ready to show you exercise can show it to you right now so how do I make the font size much bigger I'll just zoom in so this is the code that I want to I want to create a route that if I say slash joke I get a joke back so the way that I do that is the the the secret token has to go here so I need a variable called token and that's the thing I can get out of the environment variables so like if it was just xxxxX I'll call it token and then I think I could just say oh I can just say process env token then in the code so is this there and then if I go to here I can actually just say where was I process env token so this is me putting in the secret token should appear here and now all I have to do is actually go and get that secret token that I don't want you to see and paste it right here in my code you test all right I am very sorry about that unfortunately the batteries died in this mic I will be more conscientious about making sure I have batteries that are fully charged before I begin so that doesn't happen again okay so I don't remember what I was talking about now but I now have Indian I can't click on this I will not oh I will not click on this I will not click on this my environment Oken for accessing the API is in this particular environment variable file so I should be able to just access it now through process env token and not have you see it so I don't need this I don't need this so there's I guess I can leave all this let's see there's a view I'm not going to do any of this nonsense but I guess all what's in public here script uh chess style Dutch yes you indexer cheese yeah okay so this this works okay so I can use this for the as the p5 sketch and this is my server code I know you can't see this how did anybody know on glitch how to enlarge the font size like where the Preferences format this file that's cool that's nice how do i how do I change the font sizes anybody know back to glitch new stuff I don't see a way to do it anyway let's look at the project should show up here I guess there's some errors maybe oh okay starting up and what I want to do is once I've got the generated text okay so I need a prompt why did I'm why I did the chicken then I need max characters should be 280 top P I want to say 0.9 and this will eventually be a random number but let me just make it a thousand right now and then we should be able to fetch and then generate a text encountered and response dot send generated text so I should I probably should buy the pro glitch account so that this works now let's see show in a new window let's try this alright so hopefully this is going to appear at some point try enlarging browser font yeah I was trying to avoid that because I just want it's actually not even letting me do that is there an error like there's how do I find out if there's errors isn't there a console learn how to use this thing terminal aha oh cool Oh so I could actually just run some tests by running the terminal the console in the editor don't automatically sync you can manually one the Refresh command then it will force a refresh updating the editor mmhmm server readme views why is this not like showing up hmm go to sleep glitch is having a major outage right now Oh hmm well that's not good major outage means all right I just want the jokes to appear all right we're gonna do this a different way we're gonna do this a different way trying to think of how this makes sense oh I have an idea here's how we're gonna get the overlay I mean yeah I think I can come back to this how do I want to finish today off return to the pumpkins oh I like to have I feel like I think I have this thing where I feel like I want to complete something whatever I got gonna complete is the wrong word I want to reach a sort of organic happy stopping point I have a little like thing appear on the screen and be done with it let's just actually get the joke to appear in p5 so we're gonna do it this way we're gonna go I'm gonna go back to runway and I'm not sure if what's being shown in runway right now so okay so I'm gonna deactivate my dad joke model and then go back to my workspace and I am going to run the model and then I'm gonna grab that code and just I'm just gonna run it locally so here I am with the model running locally and I can go to network and I can go to JavaScript and I can do oh I did this yesterday didn't I so let's just go back to open up our pumpkins and let's make this a what am i doing duplicate and we don't need any of this stuff we don't need any of this stuff all I want oh I forgot that I is this so let's grab all this stuff and I just want to get joke and ah wrong side sorry everybody now we don't want this model we want I'm going back to runway we want this I want to query it so what I'm doing is querying the model and the input specification is here is this stuff so we have why did the chicken we are going to we want to have 280 characters we want to have top PB 0.9 let's actually have this be a random number between 0 and a thousand so it's a different seed we're gonna post this and got joke then we're going I'm going to say no canvas and function I've got joke results console dot log results so let's see if we can what's this let's see if we can get our joke to appear here in the console why does it have a little error here unrecoverable syntax error that's weird anybody see a syntax error I don't see one strip the semicolon oh yo this is the Sun this is there no semicolon there so this is the JavaScript object doesn't need a semicolon okay let's see if we can get the joke to appear okay oh oh I have to I have to get I have to call get a joke here we go everybody why did the chicken get a pill see he let out a little wine okay so this works and what I'm gonna say is create P results generated text okay so now we should see if I go to file share and get this full screen version but whoops nope that's not the one I want I want the present version why did the chicken coop ever go to school it was all toast why did the chicken get a penalty we let it go why did the chicken pay for his nap you let it go okay so I think let's improve this a little bit by mu let's improve this a little bit by creating an input text input and let's to let joke so oh let's say joke paragraph and so I'm just gonna make a couple Dom elements with nothing in them we'll start with this so this is a little interface here where I can type in a prompt and then it will get the the chicken go to the bathroom it was tender but now what I want is for anytime I'm typing I think that's input dot let's call this prompt from I think the event is actually the event function was called input I could just do changed so whenever I hit enter but let's do what's called get joke and so get joke will now get prompt is it dot value or dot HTML I think it's dot value so I'm gonna get whatever is in the prompt and so now yeah so we're going to oh it's oh no I then I want to update I don't want to do create P I want to say joke P dot HTML and give me the results so let's go back over to here and we're going to type the coding train the coding tray ologists work in concert they teach people 3d printing they teach people to make sprite movements so you might wonder like what how could this possibly have come up with anything related to 3d printing well the truth here is what I'm actually doing is I'm the process of training the model when I was finetuning an existing model so maybe tomorrow night when I come back I could talk more a bit about what GPT 2 is how it was trained and the process of finetuning but I'm there's a lot of existing knowledge it has based on a huge data set of text and the jokes that I'm feeding it are kind of steering it in the direction of what I wanted to generate so why did the chicken is a good like you know why did the fish say hello heaven oh and then so I guess I can't how do I guess I a button would make sense so let's actually let me just change one thing about this let's make a button and and then what I'm actually going to do is the button when it's pressed will get the new joke so why why does Pizza taste bad for you because all the toppings you get why does chocolate do it for lunch no chips it's the munch oh I'm so tired dot dot dot dot dot in this economy why did the for loop why did the for loop succeed because it just took longer to get from first to second base why did the if statement be false because it was why did my code short for lunch catch up yeah how else is very good um I like how light disabled this can you please disable go away yes thank you also let's see let's see I like these like coding jokes coder my code is broken see if it figures out how to do like a like no no it thinks that's the end let's get rid of the period no whoops whoops I lost that alright let's try why did my code break because the changing because why Mike Oh brick somebody's been stealing for my workstation do you have any suspicious files in there thanks it was a catch cuz it was trying to figure out how to use ghastly functions ghastly okay thank you everybody I really appreciate you joining me for this total and complete nonsense I think now what I would like to do music is turn this into a discord bot because we could ask a questions like where are you why are you and it could respond and say like should I use a forloop because that's where it gets messy it is true it prints see takes one sign it takes some time I think nothing but an int it really generates excellent punchlines really really good so I think we could make this much better I think I've stumbled on some gold here we could make this much better I don't know why I was gonna play that III got to say goodbye we could make this much better by working on a better dataset and retraining the model and also I think if a lot of the jokes like as violet suggested if I want to like really think of it as very conversational I could work on building in a my own so I think actually maybe what I was thinking is there isn't a there isn't necessarily a option for a custom delimiter in runway but if what I did was always insert I'm hearing like music somewhere some kind of like delimiter here I could train the model to kind of understand the difference between the question and the answer okay so I'm really hearing some weird noise coming from somewhere it's like freaking out a little bit let's I'm just curious if glitch came back still says major outage let's see if it comes back alright doesn't appear to be coming back so this is this is where we are for tonight this is my ending point let's finish with a little quick round of jokes by the way now I'm realizing that I can't mix sounds on my sound board so I feel like it would be useful to be able to have some nice backgrounds where I tell jokes along with you laughter but this way I've the sound board so I only played one sound at a time but I think that this ultimately this bot or web application whatever should happen should someone should speak the jokes and include a laugh track there's so many possibilities here so I let me take some suggestions from the chat for prompts right now so I'm going to wait for you to give me some suggestions for prompts which I will use why did Dan tell them to have a good day cool toast like why did the robot why did the robot fall on the side he fell on the side they were funny earlier I like the coding one sitting snort really well why does recursion take place in front of you who know G what does the Fox say is pretty good okay I think what I'll do is I'm going to say goodbye and I should let this I should leave you with this generating jokes so I'll generate jokes for a little while for you here and play you out with some music and I am doing this tomorrow will be the last latenight coding train of this week I was kind of thinking of doing it Tuesday Wednesday Thursday night so three nights a week at 11 p.m. although next week I think I might try Monday Tuesday Wednesday morning so I want to do three streams a week I come up with this my plan is planned so I'll see you tomorrow night I just have to say it so that I commit to being here so subscribe if you want to like get a reminder you have to do the like subscribe and bail thing but really could just join the discord what today HTTP GET is a really good one this is a really good one can you see the whole thing yet there we go that's what I'm looking for okay so see you tomorrow everybody we'll be back in just doing more am I turn this into a disk or pot my try to get the hue lights going we'll see please contribute please if you can't only got a suit one a.m. please if you can contribute to the repo if you want to add ideas or places that data suits data sources oh god I can't talk it's the night at the I'm gonna do this stuff this stock this dog the starter this starts I'll never forget the Vista autotuned and the Internet unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound that was invalid syntax i forgot i will use continuously over and over all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first you need to do
