04:16 - how is boxing
04:18 - how is my audio how is my audio relative

09:13 - check one two testing the sound again
09:16 - this time for real I think it's
09:18 - everything is working alright here I am
09:24 - here we go
09:26 - [Music]
09:36 - polar to Cartesian coordinates polar to
09:42 - Cartesian coordinates all are to
09:47 - Cartesian coordinates
09:54 - hey welcome to oh no train was sold no
10:01 - bail where did I put these things pickle
10:03 - pickle I have a new sidekick you can't
10:05 - see my sidekick I gotta get a sidekick
10:07 - cam and this whole extra camera here
10:09 - which will allow you to see my little
10:12 - sidekick cam but oh wait where you going
10:15 - pickle I don't know
10:21 - wait a sec oh there we go excuse me
10:24 - everybody hold on a sec
10:26 - can we start can I start over let's
10:28 - start over
10:29 - we're gonna start over okay pickle all
10:33 - right
10:34 - we're putting on this music we are going
10:39 - back to the opening screen and coming to
10:45 - you live from Brooklyn New York
10:51 - it is the coding train with your host me
10:58 - Daniel
10:59 - chief mod and it's coding buddy okay
11:10 - welcome all right I'm back I'm
11:13 - attempting to get back into live
11:14 - streaming it's very hard for so many
11:18 - different reasons and I know everybody
11:19 - around the world is dealing with so many
11:21 - different kinds of things and I hope
11:23 - that me just being here you know
11:26 - possibly once a week if I'm lucky maybe
11:30 - even more making some coding tutorials
11:32 - say hello bringing some sunshine and
11:35 - cheer and ridiculously Wow the music is
11:39 - actually quite excellent my
11:41 - interpretation and maybe my use of the
11:43 - music I could do a better job of but you
11:45 - know here we are I've got a green screen
11:47 - that's a little upgrade for today I've
11:49 - got a one of these blue microphones
11:54 - yep that's working I have a headset
11:57 - which currently there's nothing going on
12:00 - in here but if I had a producer they
12:02 - could like tell me when I'm getting
12:03 - things wrong like my physics formula is
12:06 - off and my code is broken I could hear
12:07 - them in my ear so you eventually could
12:10 - talk to my ear if if things go well it's
12:12 - 4:00 p.m. Eastern time right now and we
12:15 - can make it till you know 5:30 6 o'clock
12:17 - an hour and a half or two hours towards
12:18 - the end I might like to see if I can
12:21 - answer some questions I got to introduce
12:23 - you to pickle pickle pickle is sleeping
12:27 - so calmly here on the floor I think it's
12:30 - worth it here okay come on let's see Oh
12:34 - all right what's this gonna do um here
12:36 - where where are we gonna go here see
12:39 - there we go hi pickle say hi oh yes he's
12:45 - my little baby uh there she is oh girl
12:50 - good girl yes we're going to do some
12:52 - coding train together yes good girl good
12:55 - girl good girl
12:56 - okay okay putting this hook back
12:59 - wherever I was supposed to be which is
13:03 - here what's the chance this is in the
13:06 - right spot um maybe this is where it's
13:11 - supposed to be that's better
13:13 - this is for my diagramming um and there
13:20 - we go
13:22 - erase here oh wait where what happened
13:26 - to my sound board well the battery died
13:30 - oh no but it's plugged in I should be
13:32 - getting charged charged power Oh No oh
13:37 - it says it's not plugged in but it is
13:39 - plugged in
13:46 - all right I have no soundboard right now
13:49 - sorry that's really keeping me sane um I
14:00 - lost my sound board Here I am oh wait
14:04 - mark Rober is live streaming right now I
14:07 - thought that was at four o'clock on a
14:09 - Friday
14:09 - mm-hmm yeah go watch mark Rober I'm just
14:12 - here doing guys I'm not even like
14:14 - sweating I've no idea what I'm doing
14:17 - I'm gonna do a some coding tutorials I
14:21 - think I mean I'm gonna be talking
14:23 - hopefully more than just all right I
14:36 - have another idea let's see if this
14:38 - works
14:40 - let's give me power come on sound board
14:43 - you can do it well again this be cable
14:51 - Oh which way do you go oh this way there
14:59 - we go I've got power I've got power got
15:03 - power okay all right okay pickle how
15:08 - would do it there
15:09 - I need another I definitely need another
15:10 - webcam okay wrong one here we go all
15:17 - right welcome to the coding train I and
15:20 - Dan I am at home as almost all of us
15:25 - around the world are I am in New York
15:27 - City at particularly in Brooklyn which
15:28 - is definitely a scary and place to be
15:33 - these days and I hope that all my
15:35 - neighbors are doing well I hope that
15:36 - you're watching this are doing well and
15:40 - I'm trying to get back into the rhythm
15:43 - of doing work I teach classes of NYU
15:46 - those classes are happening remotely my
15:48 - kids are here being homeschooled I mean
15:52 - they have some some video calls with
15:54 - their teachers and classmates and work
15:56 - being assigned to them but they need a
15:57 - lot of help and supervision
15:58 - so that takes up a lot of time and
16:00 - energy you need to eat all the time
16:02 - there's a lot of feeding going on
16:04 - so my weeks are just kind of insane but
16:09 - we're we're we're here we're happy we're
16:11 - doing okay and I found that it's last
16:15 - week I managed to finally sort of get
16:17 - around to make trying to live stream it
16:18 - was Saturday this week's a little bit
16:20 - earlier it's Friday afternoon
16:22 - who knows maybe next week I'll be back
16:24 - to Thursday something a little bit
16:25 - different I have never actually done
16:26 - this and I'm not too happy about it
16:28 - actually I might want to change is that
16:30 - I'm sitting I might always stand when I
16:33 - live stream i like to pace around move
16:35 - around jump around uh just have that
16:38 - energy of standing and it's kind of like
16:41 - it lets me know that I am live-streaming
16:44 - I am performing in a way for the live
16:46 - stream and right now I'm sitting so I'm
16:51 - not so sure about that a little bit I
17:00 - also actually it's looking fine I have a
17:03 - secondary light if you look at this
17:05 - there's pretty there's like a pretty
17:07 - decent shadow here I have a new light
17:09 - which is coming from this side I have a
17:12 - new polarizing filter on my camera which
17:15 - I think is helping with the reflection
17:18 - in my glasses
17:19 - I really wanted to eliminate the
17:21 - reflection in my glasses which I think
17:23 - I've done a pretty decent job of I don't
17:25 - know I can't actually tell what I'm
17:27 - looking at you like yet see my monitor
17:29 - over here but I do have another light
17:32 - there's nothing this is the emperor's
17:34 - new light here but this I have a light
17:36 - that I could attach to here I was gonna
17:39 - put it right here
17:40 - and try to fill in the shadow but I'm
17:42 - not gonna worry about that right now I
17:44 - also need to figure out about recording
17:48 - to disk so that if anything that I do
17:51 - today has any value whatsoever that I
17:55 - could
17:58 - that I could do work with matsya who is
18:02 - the editor for the coding train and put
18:04 - together video that would get uploaded
18:06 - separately afterwards for example I'd
18:08 - like to try to do a coding challenge
18:09 - today I have my white board over here
18:12 - wait that's weird
18:13 - am i smaller oh no no that's fine this
18:15 - is what it should be
18:17 - and then this just goes to the full
18:19 - camera there we go
18:21 - so there's so let me think about this
18:24 - how am I going to work this myself no
18:39 - it's charge ago it's charging charge on
18:41 - up charge it up search it up people
18:44 - alright watching from Iceland that is
18:46 - amazing hello Iceland let's go to here I
18:54 - I think we should do some wheel spinning
18:57 - today
18:59 - [Music]
19:03 - I think we should just start with a
19:09 - wheel spin whirly noise these are things
19:14 - that are in the sort of pipeline
19:15 - marching squares
19:17 - what are some other like algorithms that
19:21 - I have not programmed recently that
19:23 - could be fun to do because I could just
19:25 - pick between these two I should just do
19:27 - whirly noise
19:28 - it shouldn't let's take a look at the
19:32 - [Music]
19:35 - coding training suggested topics the
19:39 - sitting thing is really weird I feel so
19:40 - low energy we've got some new ones that
19:44 - have been opened up recently two
19:46 - dimensional discrete fourier transform
19:49 - for images didn't I do that or maybe
19:51 - this has to do with an image processing
19:53 - on visualize common math algorithms take
19:59 - u lated pi let's see let's look often I
20:04 - assign them to myself when I feel like
20:06 - it's something I'm going to do auto
20:08 - encoder oak just do that that would be
20:11 - fun do Bonacci spiral I think I have I
20:16 - think I kind of did that already
20:19 - I've done a lot of these these are the
20:23 - open ones a lot of these have been done
20:26 - these are the two that I was sort of
20:28 - most recently thinking about looks you
20:30 - were Lee knows as just let's forget
20:32 - about that wheel spinning thing I'm
20:34 - gonna get to I'm gonna get to the wheel
20:36 - spinning Tetris let's just do let's do a
20:43 - coding project that is like totally
20:46 - manageable and look at these images it's
20:52 - that I that is manageable that will give
20:54 - me a pattern like this this might look
20:55 - like a lot of these look like a Voronoi
20:57 - tessellation which there's a whirly
21:03 - noise which is a variation of which is a
21:05 - kite
21:05 - you know it's named for Steven whirly
21:07 - but it's really cellular noise
21:09 - which can be depending on how you
21:13 - implement it you it's basically a you're
21:15 - getting this burrowing tessellation
21:17 - which is another coding challenge that I
21:19 - should do but look at this one
21:21 - interesting gizmos and games but but
21:24 - there's a there's some ways to get some
21:25 - interesting variety look at this I don't
21:27 - actually know how to get it to look like
21:28 - that that's interesting I know I feel
21:30 - like this I've seen ooh look at this
21:33 - these are interesting alright we're
21:35 - gonna attempt to do this I'm just like
21:38 - launching right into it I'm gonna open
21:39 - up processing there's gonna be a test
21:42 - now I need to record two discs so I'm
21:45 - gonna press this button here
21:46 - and I'm recording two discs I want to
21:48 - attempt to also record I want to attempt
22:00 - to also record the green screen
22:03 - separately and the software that I do
22:05 - that is um
22:11 - here and I'm just give me a minute here
22:17 - I didn't get a chance to do this in
22:19 - advance I talk amongst yourselves um
22:28 - let's see how do I create that virtual
22:31 - oh let's just do is there audio coming
22:36 - in no there might be though if I do this
22:43 - audio audio audio audio audio no audio
22:48 - sex there we go audio settings it's
22:52 - getting some audio from interesting from
22:57 - the camera itself I need to create a
23:00 - virtual camera
23:07 - I don't remember how to do new add input
23:13 - I'll be back in a minute sorry I'm
23:15 - setting up some good figure ancient
23:16 - stuff so I could record this
23:18 - green-skinned on its own which maybe is
23:20 - not really gonna video browse blank
23:24 - browse more more more virtual virtual
23:29 - Virtual Set no that's interesting video
23:32 - image camera virtual camera camera no
23:40 - that's the one that I want desktop
23:44 - capture virtual know what I want done
23:58 - this before on my other streaming
24:01 - computer this is fasiq go walk go watch
24:04 - mark rubber stream come back in just
24:05 - like five minutes tell me what's going
24:07 - on in there
24:07 - maybe I could do is there something that
24:09 - he's teaching that I could do a coding
24:10 - version of input virtual all right I got
24:16 - to look this up people I'm looking up on
24:18 - my v-max virtual camera is that not what
24:27 - it's called I guess I could just try to
24:33 - record this audio maybe I just need to
24:36 - do I know of an idea add input settings
24:43 - alright I think I might just have to
24:45 - record an TSE 29 1929 97 that's right
24:50 - audio recording
24:59 - alright let's just hit record and see
25:01 - what happens
25:02 - audio mixer oh there we go inputs Game
25:06 - Capture no no no I want to add an input
25:08 - oh I know that's what I can do add an
25:11 - input audio there we go
25:14 - browse no no audio but not a file
25:19 - don't be ridiculous what happens more
25:27 - audio input there we go add device yes
25:31 - the microphone is exactly what I want
25:34 - ok yes there we go I've got my
25:36 - microphone audio there we go now I'm
25:38 - gonna do record oh oh it is
25:43 - the monitor is on okay I'm on that's
25:45 - okay I can just mute this do you hear
25:48 - that weird echo you're gonna get
25:51 - feedback too okay there we go that's
26:00 - good now I'm gonna hit record and I put
26:06 - one fine and before it's fine let's just
26:11 - try that new file every let's say every
26:18 - 30 minutes and okay and am i recording
26:23 - I'm recording okay I'm recording oh look
26:31 - at me here okay alright
26:40 - I have to livestream today I made it
26:44 - like a last minute decision like I'm
26:46 - just gonna do it just gonna livestream
26:47 - today mark is doing a full-on physics
26:51 - class on how to weigh stuff without
26:53 - gravity complete with what I believe
26:56 - will end up with differential equations
26:58 - well I would say mark is doing an
27:00 - excellent job without having watched it
27:01 - probably well rehearsed prepare not just
27:04 - like configuring settings on another
27:06 - computer that's like over here I'm so
27:08 - sorry everybody not going well whirly
27:12 - noise tweaking of C points and colors
27:21 - would be necessary to make this look
27:22 - like stone oh let me I also need to
27:27 - record separately a screen capture here
27:31 - let's see how that works new screen
27:32 - recording Oh record entire screen chord
27:38 - ok so I think I'm recording now here I
27:42 - want to get the paper out cellular
27:44 - texture basis function 1996 and closest
27:53 - point basis okay I think that's I think
27:55 - I understand how this works
28:01 - we all want you to make Tetris I just do
28:04 - Tetris today it probably took I'm gonna
28:06 - come back at you Tetris that'll be fun
28:07 - just not today
28:09 - who ain't open a window let's see how my
28:11 - batteries are charging all right how's
28:21 - everybody doing good
28:35 - alright let's just give this a try no I
28:48 - let's pick oh my goodness pickle pickle
28:50 - is a little bit scared of my train
28:52 - whistle it's gonna be ok pickle ok about
28:55 - why you haven't made tetris yet it's an
28:57 - excellent suggestion all right yes ok I
29:14 - got it I got it
29:15 - all right Tetris with whirly noise
29:20 - instead of colors ok yes somebody's
29:26 - knocking at my door waiting to beat my
29:28 - microphone come on in what's going on I
29:32 - am live streaming right now just so you
29:35 - know
29:40 - yeah you want me to view the microphone
29:49 - hold on we've got it we've got a let's
29:51 - let's move to let me do this and mute
29:57 - the microphone
31:06 - okay I'm back I don't know why my sound
31:10 - word won't get any power should be
31:15 - getting power we're getting started in
31:35 - just a minute don't worry this is no
31:37 - professional operation like the Mars
31:39 - rover livestream just this is a very
31:42 - unprofessional publication have I lost
31:46 - all the viewers yet no I seem to be
31:48 - gaining viewers understand how that's
31:49 - possible
31:50 - okay I doubt this is gonna get edited
31:56 - into anything later but it's a good it's
31:59 - a good good practice alright welcome to
32:08 - a coding train coding challenge
32:16 - [Music]
32:23 - hi Bruno yeah I was gonna do
32:27 - I sort of felt like I should do one of
32:29 - these sir models which i think is
32:34 - interesting to look at you know why how
32:39 - how an infection spreads how social
32:42 - distancing or physical distancing
32:44 - whatever term you want to apply to that
32:46 - can slow that spread and there's an
32:48 - excellent visualization in The
32:50 - Washington Post on that from several
32:52 - weeks ago three blue one Brown did a
32:54 - video Simon Tiger one of has done well
32:57 - and I don't know I just I don't want to
33:03 - do something that I really have no real
33:07 - knowledge or expertise in I'm sure what
33:09 - I have to add to that discussion so I
33:11 - think I'm just gonna go with my usual
33:12 - stuff but I will consider that
33:17 - encouraging words all right here we go
33:23 - hello and welcome to my first coding
33:26 - challenge from home a new sort of studio
33:28 - set up that I have looks kind of like
33:30 - this I don't know how this is gonna go
33:31 - I've got a green screen behind me I'm
33:33 - sitting which is really kind of a
33:35 - problem in terms of my I think I think
33:37 - the Bloods not flowing to my brain
33:38 - properly I should probably stand up but
33:40 - what are you gonna do what are you gonna
33:41 - do Here I am I'm going to attempt to
33:43 - program whirly noise what is whirly
33:46 - noise what's the algorithm for worldly
33:48 - noise how can you program early noise
33:49 - and can I get an image and I can't take
33:53 - the point over there because I am have
33:56 - this little tiny area for myself this is
33:58 - not good I do not like this setup I
34:01 - don't like this setup
34:10 - I don't have a soundboard I made a
34:15 - mistake should just take I should've
34:17 - taken a nap I'm gonna go ahead and do
34:25 - this anyway won't work try again this
34:33 - this is a test Street this is not my
34:36 - actual coding trade livestream move the
34:39 - camera yeah hello and welcome to codec
34:44 - challenge whirly noise I'm going to
34:47 - attempt to program this algorithm that
34:50 - is I found over here move the OBS camera
34:59 - yeah yeah all right all right I promise
35:15 - you that I'm gonna get used to this and
35:18 - I'm gonna get the momentum going this is
35:22 - your first time watching I'm very sorry
35:24 - this is your second time watching if
35:27 - there's any if you're watching I'm sorry
35:29 - I I think I can I think I can manage to
35:31 - bring myself to start to code an example
35:34 - I just need to get over some sort of
35:36 - like mental block what's happening to me
35:39 - right now
35:48 - [Music]
35:56 - 4:25 p.m. alright dad :
36:01 - we didn't get a 1 million special I know
36:03 - I know I'm having trouble I'm having
36:05 - trouble welcome to a coding trained
36:11 - coding challenge I have recording from a
36:13 - new studio set up so things might be a
36:15 - little wonky but I'm gonna try to make
36:17 - this video I'm gonna try to program this
36:18 - really noise thing I'm here in Brooklyn
36:21 - New York at home with some lights and a
36:23 - camera and a laptop and I'm sitting
36:24 - which is really weird and I don't know
36:26 - why I'm sitting but I should be standing
36:28 - I like to stand while I code I'm sitting
36:31 - everybody just take a deep breath with
36:33 - me and let's try to make something fun
36:36 - let's try to make something beautiful
36:37 - I'm gonna make a very simple version of
36:39 - just this algorithm and I don't think
36:41 - it's gonna take that long and from there
36:44 - maybe you can make your own creative
36:46 - twist on it share it we can and that'll
36:49 - be that that'll be something that's a
36:50 - thing we could do to learn something to
36:52 - enjoy ourselves and to be together
36:55 - through this medium of the internet
36:59 - video through a lens they know all right
37:08 - I have to give up on this and I've got
37:10 - to plug it in I've got to plug it in
37:16 - over what cameras falling no no do you
37:21 - hear a weird can I turn on slow mode not
37:27 - easily right now
37:34 - not easily I'm gonna plug this in over
37:36 - here
37:41 - really should charge this in advance
37:59 - this is gonna make everything good okay
38:02 - okay okay she's not used to being on my
38:08 - alright okay ready okay okay okay here
38:15 - we go
38:18 - we try this one more time we're gonna
38:21 - try this one more time it's nice that
38:22 - everybody is always leaving me friendly
38:24 - comments in the chat alright here we go
38:30 - welcome to the first coding train coding
38:32 - challenge from home gloria pickle and i
38:35 - are really into this new algorithm
38:37 - called whirly noise and she suggested it
38:42 - I think so at least
38:45 - no it was kind of pointed in the
38:46 - direction of whirly noise when I was
38:49 - looking at different web pages and I
38:50 - thought let's program it as the first
38:53 - coding challenge from home I've got a
38:54 - new set up things are probably gonna be
38:55 - a little bit wonky I'm just gonna I'm
38:58 - just gonna do my best honestly like if
39:00 - I'm recording this during a live stream
39:02 - I don't know if this is ever gonna make
39:03 - it to an edit video if it does I'll be
39:05 - shocked but the poor people who are
39:06 - watching this live stream have watched
39:08 - me try to get started coding something
39:09 - for just like the last half an hour and
39:12 - I've really haven't get to click all
39:13 - time but I think my friend my old friend
39:16 - here Gloria pickle she's going to help
39:19 - me out I'm going to be strong and get to
39:23 - coding something go back to sleep and
39:32 - we're gonna get started all right so
39:37 - what is whirly noise I've got oh shoot
39:41 - what happened
39:43 - my setup it's all messed up oh this is
39:48 - the wrong I was doing so well does it go
39:54 - this way back yeah back back come on
40:02 - whenever I move anything that's not I
40:05 - totally like my whole thing is out of
40:08 - whack okay
40:34 - so what is whirling noise first let's
40:38 - just have a discussion of what noise is
40:40 - and I want to visualize noise in a two
40:43 - dimensional canvas in a window on a
40:45 - computer and the way that I'm gonna
40:50 - visualize noise noise being another word
40:52 - for randomness is by setting every
40:55 - single pixel color of a two-dimensional
40:57 - window to some pixel cups or some color
41:00 - and I'll just do pure noise randomness
41:07 - I'm gonna open up my processing window
41:12 - here and I'm going to add setup and I'm
41:15 - going to add draw I'm gonna make the
41:18 - window size 400 by 400 and let's run
41:21 - this and I've got my window over here
41:24 - I'm gonna save this as whirly noise I'm
41:32 - gonna draw a black background and then
41:34 - I'm gonna do a nice for loop I'm gonna
41:36 - loop over all the x's
41:48 - and all the wise I'm going to get an
41:55 - index a late
42:04 - it's the toss the typing noise it's good
42:08 - yeah I know
42:10 - processing processing okay
42:35 - so here I am in processing I am going to
42:38 - write setup and draw you know III don't
42:43 - think this needs to be and then this is
42:50 - this is how to get that there okay how's
43:01 - the font size by the way
43:20 - I'm gonna make this project in
43:22 - processing and I will also release a
43:23 - JavaScript version of it but because I'm
43:25 - going to do this operation
43:26 - pixel-by-pixel to be very slow in
43:28 - JavaScript canvas so without worrying
43:30 - about optimizing it right now I'm just
43:32 - gonna stay in a desktop environment
43:33 - processing built on top of Java so I
43:36 - have a setup function so I have a setup
43:37 - function up there which gives me my
43:39 - window size 400 by 400 and in the draw
43:42 - loop what I want to do is set every
43:45 - single pixel so every single pixel in
43:47 - the window is going to have an XY
43:49 - location I can iterate over every single
43:52 - thick pixel with a nested for loop I
44:04 - want these to be X's
44:32 - so this so this loop here looks at every
44:38 - single X and every single Y then what I
44:56 - want to do is set every pixel at that
44:58 - X&Y location so pixels index something
45:02 - to a random value so I have to figure
45:07 - out the pixels in a processing window or
45:10 - store the colors are all stored in an
45:12 - array a one-dimensional array so I need
45:15 - to know for any given X Y what is the
45:17 - index into that array and there's a nice
45:19 - formula I can use where the index is X
45:22 - plus y times the width itself
45:33 - now this is something I've gone over
45:35 - countless times but I'm just gonna go
45:38 - over it again in this particular video
45:40 - let's say that I have my window that has
45:43 - one two three four that's five by one
45:46 - two three four it's five by five okay
45:50 - and if I'm looking over here the X is
45:53 - zero one two three
45:55 - which is right here and the Y is zero
45:58 - one which is right here
46:00 - now if I were to count the pixels
46:02 - individually zero one two three four
46:04 - five six seven eight nine ten eleven
46:06 - twelve thirteen fourteen
46:07 - how do I get this number well it is how
46:10 - many over its X is three so it's three
46:13 - over four five six seven eight it's
46:16 - actually pixel number eight three plus
46:19 - five is eight then this pixel would be
46:21 - 13 and this pixel would be 18 because
46:24 - we've got to go five more down every row
46:27 - so the x value three plus the y value
46:32 - one times how many pixels are in each
46:34 - row five gives me eight this is the
46:37 - formula so I can apply that formula in
46:40 - my code here X plus y times width say
46:44 - pixels index and run the sketch I'm sure
46:46 - so we've got missing a really important
46:48 - detail let's run it and see what happens
46:50 - anyway yeah no pointer exception why did
46:53 - I get a null pointer exception because
46:55 - the pixels don't exist I mean they do
46:57 - exist I see them there they're pixels
46:59 - but they don't exist because I didn't
47:02 - know they exist they're there there are
47:05 - pixels that's what I said
47:07 - but I don't have access to them because
47:09 - they I haven't unlocked the key to them
47:11 - in memory and the way that I do that in
47:13 - processing is by calling the load pixels
47:17 - function pixels would be a pixel will be
47:20 - a good name for a dog
47:22 - sorry pickle her name is pickle not
47:24 - pixel I could call her pixel as a
47:26 - nickname pixel high pixel update pixels
47:30 - I also have to say update pixels once
47:32 - I'm done with the pixels there we go so
47:35 - now I have noise this is not whirling
47:37 - noise don't be misled by the title of
47:40 - the window I have
47:41 - whirling noise this is pure noise
47:43 - randomness now I just want to have it
47:45 - run once so I'm going to add no loop
47:47 - here so draw happens once and I just get
47:50 - a random set of pixels
48:12 - Lode pickles now so what I've
48:23 - implemented so far is noise but there
48:27 - are lots of other kinds of noise I
48:28 - probably have at least 10 videos on
48:31 - something called Perlin noise and a lot
48:33 - of the people argue is what I my videos
48:35 - that are called Perla noise is actually
48:37 - not really Perlin noise it's fractal
48:39 - noise or maybe it's gradient noise
48:45 - because Ken Perlin revised Perlin noise
48:48 - to something called simplex noise but
48:51 - simplex noise those are sort of
48:52 - interesting history to that but I was
48:54 - using in a different video
48:55 - open simplex noise and what all these
49:03 - different kinds of noise algorithms are
49:05 - they're all rooted in randomness at
49:07 - their core but something different
49:09 - happens along the way what I implemented
49:12 - here is literal just randomness the only
49:14 - algorithm is pick a random brightness
49:16 - value between 0 and 255 but each one of
49:20 - these has a different kind of twist on
49:22 - that with perla noise the idea is really
49:25 - to create a smooth noise and you get
49:27 - these nice textures that appear like
49:29 - like clouds or marble and you can do a
49:31 - lot with them so I would love in my life
49:35 - to implement every kind of noise that
49:37 - ever existed I've done some of these in
49:40 - different videos I definitely
49:41 - implemented them but I've made use of
49:42 - them but in this video we are going to
49:45 - do whirling noise another name for that
49:48 - is cellular noise
50:08 - okay whirly noise was introduced named
50:12 - for Stephen Worley in 1996 and there's
50:15 - this actual paper a cellular texture
50:18 - basis function so I encourage you to
50:21 - pause this video now and enjoy reading
50:23 - this paper I would love to do a dramatic
50:25 - reading of it for you
50:26 - but I'm not going to at the moment I'm
50:29 - just gonna stick to something very very
50:32 - basic here which is just following what
50:34 - literally written I'm gonna make my own
50:41 - through I'm rather than read the paper
50:45 - all the way through and try to follow
50:46 - that to build worldly noise I'm just
50:48 - going to follow this summary simplified
50:51 - slur
50:51 - that's on the Wikipedia page and there's
50:53 - really just two steps of this algorithm
50:55 - number one randomly distribute feature
50:58 - points in space and I could use a two
51:00 - dimensional space or a three dimensional
51:03 - space and actually what's interesting
51:04 - about this is I even though what I'm
51:06 - drawing here is a two dimensional space
51:09 - every pixel is in two dimensions I could
51:12 - think of the whirly noise space as three
51:15 - dimensional but visualize a slice of it
51:17 - I think that's the way I'm gonna start
51:19 - this to be perfectly honest so if I go
51:21 - back to we could be you know the first
51:23 - step is randomly distribute feature
51:25 - points in space I'm gonna make an array
51:29 - of P vectors we'll call that the
51:33 - features
51:37 - let's just make five of them and make
51:54 - each one a random point so each point
52:05 - has an X and a Y and a Z now the range
52:09 - of what the x and y are clearly within
52:11 - my two-dimensional canvas of 0 to 400
52:13 - I'm just going to consider it to be a
52:15 - box a cube where every dimension the
52:19 - width the height and the depth is all
52:20 - the same so I'll just use its own width
52:22 - for the Z come on back to me then just
52:34 - to understand that this is working I'm
52:36 - going to comment this out and I'm gonna
52:39 - draw all those points
52:57 - let's skip the Z actually and I'm gonna
53:09 - set a background so we can see them
53:13 - there we go each time I run this I'm
53:16 - gonna get a new set of points now I
53:17 - don't I'm not so worried about
53:19 - visualizing the Z I could do the
53:21 - interesting thing I could do is I could
53:22 - say let's make the stroke weight will
53:28 - map the features Z which has a range
53:33 - between 0 and width and I'll make that
53:36 - between 1 and like 12 so that way I can
53:40 - sort of see the depending on the Z value
53:43 - it'll be a larger or smaller point so
53:46 - you can see what's going on here as if
53:48 - this one is closer now the Prospectus
53:51 - with any kind of 3d perspective I'm just
53:52 - trying to get a sense of what the data
53:54 - is so now that I have that the next step
53:58 - is alpha then X is distance and closest
54:02 - point to X what does that mean
54:12 - I don't like my lighting a lady seems
54:14 - weird what's it there's a lot of people
54:23 - watching this right now which is giving
54:25 - me a little boost of energy this is by
54:27 - the way a nice little coffee mug here I
54:29 - guess there's some green in it but this
54:33 - is a drawn by my daughter in her art
54:36 - class class hmm can you put your laptop
54:42 - up you're looking down which is weird
54:44 - yeah and I've got this hat on too so I'm
54:46 - probably doing this I should stand
54:48 - should we both to standing it's too late
54:50 - I should move to standing I should move
54:56 - the camera back I should move to
54:57 - standing okay
55:00 - do I should I should I try to do this
55:03 - slowmode thing because I can I can make
55:07 - that happen
55:07 - how's my eye let me see how my
55:09 - soundboard is doing 12% it's up to 12%
55:18 - that's pretty good okay all right here
55:22 - we go because it's the Orioles no I'm
55:38 - gonna tell you something baseball is
55:40 - canceled which means the Orioles are
55:42 - tied for first place this is their year
55:44 - I think they might finish the year tied
55:45 - for first place
55:48 - okay move to standing please all right
55:57 - well what part of this was I on all
56:00 - right I'm trying to understand this
56:02 - noise F of n of X is distance to nth
56:09 - closest point to X see this shadow
56:11 - behind me is really bothering me had a
56:38 - soundboard and I can play some music the
56:41 - worldly noise thing is gonna I'm gonna
56:42 - continue that in a second don't worry
56:45 - it's gonna get good soon let's just see
56:50 - here see here how this goes I have these
56:53 - rechargeable batteries and I've just
56:55 - charged up I'm going to attach this
56:58 - light here well let's let's make sure
57:01 - it's actually going to turn on oh that's
57:02 - pretty bright okay that's good I don't
57:04 - know how long it's gonna last but okay
57:13 - here we go
57:19 - this open anything
57:22 - how's that how am I looking what's weird
57:30 - what's going on I don't know if that's
57:35 - better maybe I should just have this
57:36 - light over here about like two sides all
57:45 - right I don't know I haven't really
57:46 - improved anything but that's what it's
57:50 - gonna be all right okay where's my
57:58 - marker so I have my noise space with
58:09 - some number of seed points now what I
58:13 - want the next step is for any given X Y
58:21 - point which I guess is just really
58:24 - called X here so for any given X right
58:27 - here
58:28 - the noise function of X so I could have
58:35 - an F of 1 of X I can have an F of 2 of X
58:39 - is basically equal to the nth closest
58:43 - point meaning this is maybe these first
58:47 - let's let's draw these points in a more
58:49 - obvious way and then I will number them
58:53 - where's that other so we have this point
58:57 - this point this point this point and
59:01 - maybe I don't know another point over
59:05 - here so this is the first closest point
59:10 - this is maybe the second then this is
59:13 - the third I don't know I'd have to get
59:15 - out a ruler let's say this is the fourth
59:17 - and this is the fifth so the idea is but
59:20 - but I can choose a different n but for
59:23 - any given n I want to color this pic get
59:26 - a random value it's not
59:28 - it's it's random only because these seed
59:30 - points are randomly distributed but now
59:32 - that those points have been distributed
59:34 - the color for this particular pixel is
59:36 - specifically a function of the first
59:39 - closest point the second close point or
59:40 - the third closest point so going back to
59:50 - the code and let's make these let's make
59:54 - these red so that I'll be able to see
59:56 - them more easily let's put the pixels
60:01 - back in just make sure everything's
60:02 - working together let's make these points
60:09 - a little bit larger so I can see them
60:11 - better so now I want to look for every
60:20 - given pixel which point is the closest
60:23 - or actually I don't know that's like for
60:25 - every giver every given pixel I want a
60:27 - sorted list of the distances to all the
60:30 - points
60:38 - so right here I'm going to create an
60:40 - array of distances which is a new array
60:49 - [Music]
60:53 - how many values need to go in it the
60:58 - same number of values is the same number
60:59 - of seed points so features dot length
61:02 - then I need to loop over all those let's
61:12 - get the distance between oh actually I
61:16 - need to store the distance between what
61:20 - between the X and the y the given pixel
61:23 - that I'm looking at and the given
61:28 - feature point that I'm currently on in
61:31 - terms of this iteration cycle and
61:34 - actually we want to keep the Z here so
61:37 - these points I'm just looking at a slice
61:38 - where Z is 0 but I want the X the Y and
61:43 - the Z of all those feature points then
61:48 - you know what's lovely about this I
61:50 - could just sort them because it's just
61:52 - an array of floating-point numbers the
61:54 - processing has a sort function which
61:56 - knows how to sort and array of numbers
61:57 - so I can just say sort the distances
62:00 - wonder if that makes a new array well
62:02 - we'll find out and then I just need to
62:07 - get that distance let me get the closest
62:12 - one so this is this is if N and is 0 so
62:22 - just have everything name correctly in
62:24 - my code let's create a variable called N
62:27 - and set that equal to 0 so the distance
62:30 - I want to look at the ends closest it I
62:32 - want to look at the end closest distance
62:34 - in the array and then set that to be the
62:39 - color interesting we can sort of start
62:43 - to see little little circles that are
62:45 - going on here now I need to deal with
62:47 - some map in here the mapping is way
62:49 - right because what are these what's the
62:52 - range of these distances well it's
62:55 - somewhere between like I mean it really
62:57 - depends the cube is the width height and
63:00 - depth is all equal to 400 or or width is
63:05 - the global variable let's use a mapping
63:07 - so let's call the brightness I'll just
63:09 - call that B is map the distance which
63:12 - has a range say between 0 and width
63:15 - divided by 2 let's just take half of
63:17 - that and when it's really close I want
63:20 - it to be super bright when it's really
63:22 - far away I want it to be super dark so
63:24 - let's make that the color for every
63:27 - given pixel hmm what did I get wrong
63:33 - here
63:46 - I've got something quite wrong here
63:57 - map distance
64:08 - hmm
64:14 - this looks good to me I run it again I
64:20 - get a different result no oh wait I
64:25 - wonder if no no jurors distance or index
64:39 - the X the Y let's get rid of the Z for a
64:45 - second oh I guess I just um my range is
64:51 - really off because of the Z does depth
64:55 - space oh you know what's going on here I
64:58 - think I think the sort function in
65:02 - processing is making a new array yes
65:05 - okay so the sort function this sort
65:08 - function was not was sorting the array
65:10 - but it copies all those distances into a
65:12 - new array so that array wasn't actually
65:14 - sorted so I need to create a I need just
65:18 - to take the new array and said you said
65:21 - equal to itself and now let's put the Z
65:24 - back in oh well this is zero
65:29 - it's just that slice there we go that
65:34 - makes more sense
65:36 - [Music]
65:52 - let's create a lot more points I'm just
65:54 - curious
66:07 - people in that chat are very upset with
66:09 - my wasting of memory well you know life
66:11 - goes on
66:30 - interesting so I don't need to draw the
66:34 - seed points anymore so this is what I've
66:41 - got it looks a little bit strange
66:46 - mostly because of Maca said I'm not
66:50 - upset upset good yeah I'm gonna worry
66:54 - about the memory stuff in a bit but this
66:57 - is this is this is good enough right now
67:10 - so this has a kind of strange almost
67:13 - spherical like quality to it it's
67:15 - because I started with this 3d space
67:17 - and once again let me let me let's go
67:19 - back and let's just have 3d seed feature
67:25 - points 2d features so if I get rid of
67:32 - the Z point now I have you can see this
67:37 - looks much more like a Voronoi
67:39 - tessellation because literally what we
67:42 - have is every point is colored according
67:45 - to its closest to the closest point we
67:52 - have this looks exactly like a runway
67:54 - tessellation because the definition of a
67:55 - Voronoi tessellation is cells where
67:59 - cells that are divided by the dividing
68:03 - line where all the points in this cell
68:05 - are closest to a particular seed point
68:08 - or feature point you can kind of see
68:09 - these now because I'm coloring them
68:11 - according to the distance you get these
68:13 - kind of like glowing little spots and
68:14 - what's interesting about this is right
68:17 - now and I don't know I don't know what
68:19 - the frame rate is here let's let's take
68:21 - off no loop and let's let's let me just
68:25 - print the frame rate out for a second
68:28 - just to see am I even going to possibly
68:29 - get a reasonable animation here yeah I'm
68:32 - kind of running you can't see this
68:33 - because I'm covering it but I'm running
68:35 - it like five frames per second which is
68:36 - terrible let's go back let's go down to
68:39 - like 400 by 400 and just 25 seed points
68:44 - there's lots of things we could do to
68:45 - optimize this and I've got 30 frames per
68:47 - second because what I want to do now
68:50 - that I think will be fun to look at is
68:52 - what happens if I go through and look at
68:59 - do this same loop where I look at all
69:01 - the points
69:13 - and move them around randomly I'm gonna
69:16 - do essentially a random walk with each
69:19 - of them we could see we could see what's
69:25 - happening right if those points move
69:27 - around the whirling noise is interesting
69:30 - now I haven't done anything having them
69:32 - move smoothly or with any kind of
69:34 - thoughtful behavior but you could start
69:37 - to imagine if these points were moving
69:38 - with a flocking system or any other kind
69:40 - of thing that I've done in this channel
69:41 - it's pretty interesting what we've got
69:49 - let's go back to the 3d features yes the
69:58 - distances are much greater why can't I
70:02 - not get the 3d one to look like what I
70:05 - want I think I know what the issue is
70:22 - Andy
70:52 - let's move these around again
70:59 - kind of interesting
71:06 - you know might I guess the Z is so large
71:09 - that it might make sense to actually
71:13 - consider this something like oh because
71:16 - I'm at zero also Oh interesting
71:19 - you know what I should do I should
71:20 - really for this to make more sense I
71:23 - should really have this be a number like
71:27 - this
71:37 - I should really have the Z range like I
71:39 - want that slice to be in the middle of
71:41 - this cube that I'm visualizing so I
71:44 - think that that would make more sense
71:45 - and then I I think it's gonna kind of
71:48 - map yeah so this is this is more like
71:50 - what I was expecting to see in terms of
71:53 - whirly noise using a three dimensional
71:56 - space like bubbles in a jar okay I'm
72:01 - gonna let I'm gonna let everybody
72:02 - watching this who's gonna make their own
72:03 - version of this play with the motion and
72:05 - I'm not gonna worry about that right now
72:07 - and I'm gonna stick with a nice no loops
72:10 - just run at once okay so here's my
72:13 - whirly noise once let's go back to 800
72:19 - by 800 I'm gonna double the number of
72:21 - points I really should quadruple the
72:23 - number of points yeah and here we go
72:26 - this is this is the whirly noise pattern
72:27 - I have now listen here's what's exciting
72:30 - about whirly noise this is really the
72:33 - same as visualizing a Voronoi
72:34 - tessellation but I've got an option here
72:36 - remember the idea is that I can I'm
72:39 - taking the nth closest point so what
72:43 - happens if instead of just using n at 0
72:47 - what if I take one what if the distance
72:50 - is not what if the color is not a not
72:53 - mapped to the closest point but the
72:55 - second closest point so let's have that
73:03 - be right here n of one look at this we
73:10 - get a very different kind of pattern
73:12 - it's very crystal like so this is
73:14 - another kind of texture that you know a
73:17 - lot of these algorithms were developed
73:18 - to make textures that would be applied
73:20 - to 3d objects that it's really quite
73:22 - lovely what happens if I change this to
73:24 - 2 whoo well it's even it's even like
73:30 - more jaggedy there's lots of possible
73:33 - things that could happen here what if I
73:34 - change this to 3 interesting I have an
73:41 - idea what if now I have an R
73:46 - a G and a B so distance let's let's name
74:03 - these D 0 D 1 and D 2 for distance 0 1 &
74:11 - 2 and let's use 0 we're gonna use a
74:17 - different distance for the red green and
74:19 - blue component so the red color will be
74:21 - mapped to the closest point the green to
74:24 - the second closest point and the blue to
74:26 - the third closest point that's pretty
74:32 - interesting well this is way more fun
74:35 - than I imagined it would be I should
74:40 - probably do like hue saturation and
74:41 - brightness let's try that let's try
74:45 - color mode HSB 255 and I'm just I mean I
74:51 - could call these now HSB but I'm now
74:53 - doing hue saturation brightness so the
74:55 - hue is the closest point the saturation
74:58 - is the I'm gonna rename this just cuz
75:00 - it's super confusing so we're gonna do
75:04 - this as HSB color hmm pretty interesting
75:08 - pretty trippy trippy is what I'm seeing
75:11 - you know we could also do something
75:14 - where it's like plus frame rate modulus
75:17 - to frame cap modulus 255 so anyways I
75:20 - could like cycle through a sine wave
75:21 - here I'm gonna go back to the RGB that
75:24 - was a nice little tangent I went on but
75:27 - let's stick with RGB
75:36 - now Louis is asking can you control the
75:41 - drawn z-axis with the mouth so what's
75:44 - interesting here is that I am fixing the
75:46 - Z at zero so there's no reason why I
75:50 - couldn't look at different slices
75:54 - remember I'm looking at worldly noise
75:55 - within a slice I'm just leaning a slice
75:58 - of worldly noise in a 3d space so what
76:00 - if I made this Mouse X now unfortunately
76:04 - this is gonna render really slow I'm
76:07 - sure my frame rate is really slow oh I
76:11 - have no loop on but I'm also gonna need
76:13 - to take no loop off let's go back well
76:17 - let's leave it now I'm guessing if I
76:22 - were to move smoothly that's I would get
76:26 - a pretty odd no it shouldn't be Mouse X
76:28 - it should be Z equals map Mouse X which
76:34 - goes from 0 to with 2 between negative
76:36 - width divided by 2 with divided by 2 so
76:39 - that's really the full range of Z
76:41 - because remember I this I the 0 is the
76:44 - center of the of this cube and in the Z
76:48 - and along the z axis at least so I can
76:50 - see here I can start to sort of move now
76:53 - it's a very I I think what I what I want
76:56 - to do is I want to reduce the complexity
76:58 - here and go back to 400 by 400 just to
77:01 - see if I can make this smoothly animate
77:03 - oh it's really kind of nice let me zoom
77:06 - in on this for you
77:14 - this is moving through that Z space and
77:20 - I think it actually might be really nice
77:22 - to just animate this with a sine wave so
77:30 - let me give myself an angle and Z rather
77:37 - than being mapped to the mouse sine of
77:44 - that angle and you know I don't need you
77:46 - to use map it's very simple I can just
77:48 - take sine of that angle times width
77:50 - divided by two because sine oscillates
77:54 - between negative one and one and so now
77:56 - let me just say angle Plus let me just
77:59 - gonna move the angle by a little bit I'm
78:04 - missing a semicolon why is that running
78:09 - super ooh I think maybe you know maybe
78:15 - the awesome maybe oscillation isn't as
78:17 - interesting as I thought it would be no
78:20 - this is what I was just moving too fast
78:22 - yes this is what I was looking for it
78:26 - should come back right why did it stop
78:41 - I mean this doesn't need to be inside
78:45 - the loop right now
79:01 - there's a lot of activity toward the
79:03 - center and a lot less activity toward
79:06 - the edges
79:19 - I think I want the brightness to make
79:31 - this a little bit brighter I don't know
79:34 - what a good strategy for that is
79:36 - multiply it by a little something and
79:38 - that seems silly well that's kind of
79:43 - interesting some sort of an accidental
79:46 - additive blending effect that I didn't
79:48 - mean oh that's pretty interesting
80:05 - [Music]
80:09 - yeah this is more like us hoping just
80:14 - give it a little glow effect
80:25 - and maybe I might prefer the blue to be
80:31 - let's do it in the opposite let's have
80:33 - the blue be the sort of primary color
80:35 - here and the red be the secondary and
80:40 - green being the third color this is what
80:42 - I was sort of and can I keep a sort of
80:52 - bare minimum of color it really depends
81:01 - where the points are seated what if I
81:04 - have many more points
81:12 - so let's do something interesting here
81:15 - which is this is gonna be very very slow
81:19 - but I'm going to just to sort of see
81:22 - where we can get here what if I make
81:24 - this 12 I'm gonna make this like much
81:27 - higher resolution let's go a 1920 by
81:30 - 1080 now this is gonna run super super
81:33 - slow but we can see this is kind of what
81:36 - the pattern looks like but I can what I
81:43 - can do is I can save this out so I'm
81:47 - gonna call save frame Whirley in
81:52 - processing if you use save frame and
81:57 - this is a directory path so a folder and
82:00 - a file name what this is going to do
82:03 - it's going to name all of them it's
82:05 - gonna save every frame out as an image
82:07 - and name it on numbered 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0
82:11 - 2 you can just let this run for a little
82:13 - bit and then I can render this to a
82:17 - movie file well this is this is this is
82:22 - really picking up let's get the music
82:26 - going I'm at 28% here in the soundboard
82:32 - so I can hook this back up I'm just
82:36 - gonna let this be a full screen you
82:37 - don't need to see me right now and we're
82:44 - gonna let this render for a little bit
82:52 - you hear the fan of my computer let me
82:57 - put the camera back on so I don't know
82:59 - if you can hear this this is the mic I'm
83:03 - moving it down to the can you hear that
83:06 - that's what the fan of the computer is
83:07 - doing
83:19 - okay
83:23 - this was really meant to be a coating in
83:25 - the Cabana video the keying is not so
83:29 - great here know what let's just let me
83:32 - give you this actually the other thing
83:36 - that's interesting is this is going to
83:37 - be a perfect loop I just realized
83:40 - because the sine wave loops am i muted
83:44 - now now the mics gone
83:46 - it came back though right am I still
83:49 - muted hmmm yeah the mic is back I don't
83:56 - know what happened with the mic I think
83:58 - that cable is just loose if you render
84:07 - the cube you could set the Alpha of
84:09 - every point that is black to 255 meaning
84:12 - you only see the spheres which would be
84:13 - very interesting yeah that I should
84:16 - definitely try it rendering this in 3d
84:18 - because I would love to see that I'm
84:27 - gonna take a short break and let this
84:29 - render for a little bit let's see how
84:33 - many frames we got
84:36 - [Music]
84:44 - so work I wish I had been more
84:47 - thoughtful about this because I could
84:48 - make us a perfect loop but we're up to
84:54 - 118 frames how many frames someone do
84:57 - the math for me if I'm going up by point
84:59 - zero one a full cycle would be 0 to 2pi
85:04 - so if does this calculator have PI in it
85:16 - scientific high times 2 divided by point
85:28 - zero one so 628 or approximately doesn't
85:34 - 628 images
85:42 - 628 frames where am I
85:46 - we'll get there
86:15 - should have made a full screen button
86:27 - 627 all right
86:30 - [Music]
86:45 - [Music]
86:54 - [Music]
87:12 - [Music]
87:24 - oh girl yes yes you're sleeping this
87:28 - through this whole coding challenge
87:35 - solar liner in the chat is saying I can
87:40 - import the slices into blender as a
87:44 - volumetric texture do I like that idea
87:53 - 5:20
87:58 - she is just sleeping through this whole
88:00 - time we're gonna go for a nice long walk
88:04 - after we finish rendering this worldly
88:06 - noise
88:07 - [Music]
88:23 - [Music]
88:27 - halfway there there we go
88:55 - [Music]
89:11 - Victor's asking where's the cat let me
89:15 - see if I can find the cat there's two
89:17 - cats
89:20 - [Music]
89:31 - Oh camera went off not a coating Josh's
90:03 - asking isn't it always at home it is not
90:05 - always at home usually I record a studio
90:09 - space at NYU let's see would we would we
90:20 - want to try this fancy Q&A thing that
90:22 - I've that I've theoretically have
90:25 - possible now anybody want to call in
90:28 - from our supporters chat we want to test
90:31 - the calling capabilities if you had a
90:36 - question about this you want to ask
90:50 - Oh was I getting you heard of buzzing I
90:53 - don't think I'm hey oh yeah I did get an
90:57 - emergency alert on my phone
91:00 - New York City is seeking licensed health
91:02 - care workers to support healthcare
91:04 - facilities in need
91:05 - visit nyc.gov slash help now to
91:09 - volunteer also a brief rain shower will
91:13 - begin at 5:07 p.m.
91:30 - well by the way something that's
91:31 - exciting that's happening is if you're
91:33 - in the disk or if you're not in the
91:34 - discord Jason hagglund who is the
91:37 - illustrator for the coding train we see
91:39 - if I can get the discord link to go into
91:41 - the chat did that work
91:47 - I don't see it there we go is creative
91:51 - is working out some new emojis that's
91:53 - already up some new emojis of the
91:54 - discord soon can you please say hi to my
91:59 - friend it's his birthday his name is
92:01 - Nick Kerr
92:03 - [Music]
92:13 - so I don't know what your foot I guess
92:15 - what I'm one thing I'm curious to hear
92:16 - is how was how is this how's this vibe I
92:20 - should change the standing up which I
92:22 - try changing to standing up and see how
92:24 - that goes
92:26 - 400 frames what what number did we say
92:31 - we had to get to 627 we're getting there
92:44 - we're always there pickle a little
92:48 - pickle it's a good girl
93:02 - so what would be interesting I know
93:03 - there's two optimizations that would be
93:05 - meaningful to do here
93:06 - one would be to one optimization would
93:13 - be to use a quadtree or a bin ladin a
93:16 - spatial subdivision because to get the
93:19 - three closest points we don't need to
93:21 - check all the points everywhere we can
93:23 - register the points in certain quadrants
93:25 - another
93:28 - another optimization would be to use
93:32 - some to use with shaders frankly and
93:36 - there are some good resources for doing
93:37 - shape worldly noise with shaders which I
93:40 - will try to pull up on before I go I
93:47 - know I'm obsessed with getting all the
93:50 - way to 627 what time is it over here
93:56 - asks lemon it is 523 currently 524 p.m.
94:10 - Eastern Time
94:17 - let's see let's well and I'm gonna let
94:19 - this keep rendering but I think the book
94:21 - of shaders which is a wonderful resource
94:24 - for learning shaders um has a section on
94:27 - whirling noise possibly and I'm really
94:42 - filling up my harddrive here each one of
94:44 - these images is 2 megabytes 2.3 2.4 are
94:52 - you going to render the cube I would
94:53 - like to try that next yes definitely
94:56 - want to try that next
95:24 - we're getting there
95:25 - I hear the pitter-patter of feet which
95:28 - are not animal feet there are other
95:31 - humanoid creatures that live in this
95:34 - house I see one over there in this
95:36 - direction she is approaching the
95:40 - human-like creature is approaching oh no
95:42 - she stopped doing something else
95:46 - what's operator number one over there I
95:48 - think what's going on operator number
95:50 - one why do we get there yet so close
95:58 - just like twenty five or six more to go
96:01 - so the s I can't say the name in the
96:05 - chat but why are the file sizes slowly
96:07 - increasing so right there they're
96:10 - increasing and decreasing and I think a
96:12 - lot has to do with just the there's a
96:15 - variable amount of color that's in each
96:16 - image and you know whatever the PNG file
96:20 - formats require like what you know based
96:23 - on the number of colors or the the
96:26 - actual pattern itself the file size I
96:27 - guess gets larger or smaller all right
96:30 - all right we got up to 628 we can stop
96:33 - this now I'm gonna stop this now let's
96:37 - come back to full screen here let's look
96:40 - at this folder so inferior we don't need
96:45 - these images let's look and see if our
96:47 - suspicion is right this is image 628 and
96:50 - let's look at image 1 did you memorize
96:54 - that image let's open this one and then
96:58 - let's go to 628 yeah they're they're
97:06 - basically exactly the same so let's go
97:09 - let's get rid of 632 all the way to 628
97:13 - let's leave 628 just to be safe and now
97:17 - what the next thing I want to do so how
97:19 - do you render to a movie so I have a
97:21 - whole separate video tutorial about
97:23 - rendering to a movie and
97:26 - I'm gonna but there's a tool in
97:31 - processing called movie maker let's grab
97:34 - that movie maker and I'm gonna get this
97:39 - folder because I gotta open this back up
97:44 - again and if I just drag the folder in
97:49 - here you can see that it is pulling all
97:52 - the files from this directory I want to
97:56 - use the same size as the originals
97:58 - I'll stick with a frame rate of 24 I
98:01 - will keep the compression as PNG why not
98:04 - and I'm going to hit create movie and
98:08 - we're gonna save this we're gonna call
98:10 - this Whirley now we have more waiting to
98:16 - do it let's see what other questions I
98:21 - can answer
98:21 - I could use a HH rd as suggesting ffmpeg
98:33 - which also could be used
98:40 - it's going this is faster at least right
98:44 - much faster
98:48 - [Music]
99:09 - oh good you got a puppy you're six years
99:17 - old she's six years old
99:20 - time to go for a walk Thank You Rock
99:29 - respawn oh well so much for that
99:39 - my vmix crashed probably filled up the
99:42 - hard drive or something hope this stream
99:43 - is still working so I see in the discord
99:51 - Coby is setting up a but a way to manage
99:55 - up some QA which we'll just do for like
99:57 - 15 or 20 minutes just really is like a
99:59 - test so let's not get too overly
100:01 - ambitious I want to if we want to be
100:04 - done by 6:00 p.m. start the weekend I
100:08 - got to get out I got to get outside for
100:11 - a walk pickles got to go outside for a
100:13 - walk kind of check on my children but I
100:20 - wanted to test how it could work for
100:22 - people to call in be a discord and ask
100:25 - questions so because I have this headset
100:28 - which I will be able to hear people and
100:30 - I'll be able to send the audio from
100:32 - discord also out to
100:36 - through through the livestream as well
100:38 - okay we are done see how this went
100:51 - you can't close this now you can go to
100:53 - the desktop and we have it here let's
100:58 - open it up
100:58 - Oh what happened here we go little boy
101:23 - oops I forgot that I'm got pickle here
101:29 - in this one okay hold on let's let me
101:33 - give you a full screen view can i play
101:37 - this full screen full screen making an
101:47 - attempt here come on you can do it
101:51 - No
101:52 - can I export this to some convert stream
102:03 - let's try this this looks good
102:11 - right I don't know save as a file let's
102:17 - choose another destination Whirley
102:21 - export save
102:33 - let's see how this goes let's see what
102:41 - we get
102:47 - almost done here okay that's promising
102:56 - let's leave this opens with there we go
103:01 - alright everybody ready for this
103:14 - look what's appropriate music for this
103:18 - [Music]
103:23 - this is what we made today yay
103:42 - alright save well it's what save it as
103:47 - something else
103:50 - hey that's only five I got this down to
103:52 - like a 5 megabyte video file that's
103:55 - pretty cool alright alright what are
104:03 - some other things we could try before I
104:04 - go before II what before the Q&A we
104:10 - before we attempt the hat lets okay so
104:13 - let me do let me I'm gonna just freeze
104:16 - this I'm gonna whoa hold actually I
104:19 - think I'm gonna delete or just gonna
104:21 - move this to the desktop and let me save
104:25 - it swirly noise 3d so what I'm gonna
104:29 - attempt to do now is actually visualize
104:35 - it in 3d you understand exactly how I'm
104:38 - gonna do this like do some kind of like
104:40 - voxel visualization so let's see how I
104:46 - might do that yeah so let's let's keep
104:57 - it the way it is and I'm gonna change
105:01 - this to P 3d
105:03 - I'm gonna go back to just like 800 by
105:05 - 800 so this is what I get just looking
105:12 - at that 2d slice and now I need a triple
105:19 - nested loop
105:22 - where Z starts here this is Z and let's
105:32 - do let's do let's have like a skip
105:34 - factor of like 10 let's just do every 10
105:39 - pixel right now I need another I don't
105:50 - and I'm not doing load pixels and update
105:54 - pixels instead I am saying push pop
106:05 - translate what am i translating to XYZ
106:11 - why do I have an error here oh because I
106:14 - have multiple disease we're gonna get
106:15 - rid of this X Y Z and we're gonna just
106:20 - draw a box that's of size 10 and let's
106:23 - give it a fill with an alpha just do I
106:27 - see what do I see here if I do this okay
106:33 - so that's that's what I was hoping for
106:37 - let's say no stroke let's make this skip
106:42 - and this should be the Skip size let's
106:47 - make the Skip much larger like 25 okay
106:53 - now what let's try adding mmm let's try
106:58 - adding that the easy cam piece of cam
107:01 - library just so I can kind of view it
107:08 - and the PC cam library allows me to sort
107:11 - of view this thing in 3d so if I go I'm
107:15 - just gonna look under examples just get
107:17 - the basic view cam example which is just
107:21 - hello peasy is all like what so I want
107:23 - to have a piece of cam instance then I
107:27 - want to create in setup a new PC cam
107:32 - I need the import statement up top as
107:36 - well I have a feeling it's gonna Center
107:38 - everything around zero zero let's just
107:41 - see what happens right so now this is
107:45 - the 3d space but I am NOT I want to be
107:50 - sort of further out away from it I think
107:54 - there's a way at that this 400 value
107:57 - must be like how far away I am from it
108:01 - yeah there we go so I'm further away but
108:04 - the corner yeah there we go so this is
108:07 - the cube but I think what I want now is
108:14 - to think of the space unfortunately as
108:17 - around the center so I need to do this
108:21 - for everything those are the random
108:24 - points and then also this for X Y so X
108:31 - X&Y also an in so let's see here I don't
108:43 - care about this index thing I'm not
108:45 - doing pixels anymore
108:47 - I must have it's all 3d I'm not using
108:52 - the color yet but let's sort of see okay
108:57 - so this is what I'm looking for I'm
109:00 - seeing this full cube I want to be much
109:03 - farther away from it is that I thought
109:04 - that's what this variable is yeah there
109:07 - we go
109:07 - there's the cube okay so I see the cube
109:10 - now dare I attempt to now color it with
109:14 - the RGB values whoa look at that that's
109:22 - pretty interesting what have I done a
109:25 - little weird whirly noise cube so it
109:29 - looks just like the textures on the
109:30 - sides I think I need I let's let's go
109:35 - back to just one color let's just go
109:40 - back to this idea n just as one color
109:45 - and Phil let's fill it at 2:55 but who I
109:51 - lost the mapping why did I lose my
109:55 - mapping no I just want to have one D
110:04 - keep this as n but what I want is for
110:07 - that mapping to be 255 comma this is the
110:16 - Alpha basically I want it to be the
110:19 - Alpha so I want the transparency to be
110:22 - based on the work the noise itself I
110:26 - feel like I'm not seeing through it in
110:30 - the way that I had hoped don't need to
110:40 - show the voxels can you now set the
110:43 - Alpha of every voxel that is black to
110:45 - zero that's what I think that I've done
110:49 - maybe I want the colors but also include
110:52 - let's just try this for a second
111:01 - yeah I think what if I do like additive
111:04 - blending Oh weird the Alpha is not
111:07 - working I think maybe the order that I'm
111:10 - drawing stuff something is off the
111:13 - transparency is definitely not working
111:14 - because look at one side versus the
111:16 - other something is weird what if I give
111:23 - it no fill stroke stroke alpha so that's
111:34 - pretty interesting
111:41 - and let's go back to n of zero
112:07 - I think somebody else with a more clever
112:09 - design abilities will have a nicer way
112:13 - of doing this there we go this is more
112:20 - like what I was looking for let's skip
112:26 - let's skip even more yeah this is kind
112:33 - of interesting I mean I don't know what
112:35 - I've really got here but
112:46 - cubes with different sizes oh that's a
112:49 - very clever okay let's try to do the
112:54 - size so this is the size which we will
113:00 - have when it's closed the size is large
113:04 - that's skip value all the way down to
113:07 - zero we're gonna have no stroke and we
113:12 - will have the fill consistently be 255
113:14 - with an alpha and this is now the size
113:18 - and like this idea whoa this is good
113:23 - now we're talking whoa that's wild
113:27 - okay I should go back to the RGB colors
113:31 - too
113:32 - [Music]
113:37 - yeah this is more interesting here
113:40 - there's definitely like a weird kind of
113:43 - Z sorting order and let's let's just
113:51 - make this smaller and let's see can I
113:52 - get down to a smaller skip yeah
114:06 - let's make this zoom out a little bit
114:12 - more I think actually I don't know why
114:14 - I'm yeah I can just do this with a
114:16 - scroll ooh
114:19 - so by having trouble controlling it oh
114:23 - so there we go
114:25 - here's my whirling noise cube and what
114:31 - happens if I use instead of an N of 0
114:37 - and n of 1
114:48 - let's give some lights here
115:00 - weird
115:23 - okay I think I'm finished for today it's
115:29 - 5:45 how are we with our possible QA
115:33 - setup so I will remind you let's go
115:41 - let's get let's go back to the original
115:44 - whirly noise I'm going to comment out
115:48 - the save frame function and I'm also
115:52 - going to reduce the size down to like
115:55 - 640 360 and let's just make 20 points
116:01 - yeah there we go so this is a nice
116:04 - version that will run in real time
116:08 - invert the cube size that's kind of an
116:11 - interesting idea let's let's try
116:17 - inverting the cube size no I can't open
116:22 - it up nope that's my audio application
116:29 - there you go
116:30 - the 3d one go there it is if we invert
116:35 - it this would be zero to skip I think
116:37 - this will actually look the same so
116:39 - maybe it won't like have a similar
116:40 - quality to it yeah because it's just
116:44 - sort of like the noises flipped but now
116:54 - let's quickly very very quickly I want
116:57 - to port this to a p5.js and just see if
117:01 - it'll run in the browser okay so while
117:04 - we're seeing it works if you want to do
117:06 - it okay so the QA is ready so what
117:11 - instructions do I need to give to people
117:12 - we're just gonna try this as a test
117:14 - maybe we're gonna do one or two
117:16 - questions somehow see if we can get that
117:19 - working with people coming in via voice
117:21 - let me know it's ready so you have to be
117:24 - in the discord if you want to
117:25 - participate and it's gonna be sort of
117:27 - random right now I think what I maybe I
117:30 - don't know if we should limit it to like
117:31 - people in the supporter chat or ever let
117:33 - the people in the discord
117:34 - that out probably should test this I'm
117:36 - the idealist to test this with the
117:38 - smaller of them YouTube members first
117:41 - but what are you gonna do alright so let
117:44 - me go to the browser and let's go to the
117:48 - p5 editor let's login
117:53 - why am i not logged in here oh there's a
117:59 - cat okay so now let's just paste this in
118:08 - and let's see if we can get this to work
118:14 - in p5 so there's what do I need to
118:17 - change so this is just an array this is
118:24 - just a plain old variable this now you
118:29 - can just do this we can just hard code
118:33 - this as 20 this is create vector this is
118:40 - function draw function setup create
118:46 - canvas let how am i doing background
118:53 - zero little pixels let let let let let
119:03 - let let let okay equals features index I
119:11 - and the distance is between X Y Z and V
119:17 - dot XV know that that still is the same
119:20 - sort I think still works let let let let
119:25 - let let now here's the real ah the big
119:28 - thing that's different is this so this
119:30 - needs a times four because unlike in
119:34 - processing the pixels in p5.js have four
119:38 - spots alright so I'm just gonna polish
119:44 - this for a second to let you know what's
119:45 - happening with the Q&A so if you
119:48 - or in here's a link to the discord
119:50 - that's going in the YouTube chat if you
119:52 - haven't joined go to the QA talk channel
119:56 - in the general section then you need to
119:58 - go to the bots talk channel and then you
120:01 - need to send a message which is question
120:03 - mark you space join and wait for your
120:06 - turn I'm gonna open up discord here at
120:09 - some point but that I guess and maybe
120:12 - there's people there chatting who can
120:13 - help you
120:15 - index okay whoops we're gonna take calls
120:18 - here live on the coding train this is
120:20 - going to be new just voice calls right
120:21 - now we can do video at some point then I
120:24 - need to say pixels index plus 0 is the
120:26 - red value plus 1 is the green value 2 is
120:34 - the blue value and then I need to set
120:35 - the alpha myself manually to 55 so
120:39 - unlike in processing where you put a
120:40 - full integer color into a spot in the
120:43 - array what you do here is have each the
120:48 - RGB and alpha values are in separate
120:50 - spots in the array itself and so for the
120:53 - x wise you look up that point and
120:56 - multiply it by 4 I think I've got
120:58 - everything here what did I miss
120:59 - what's the chance that this is gonna
121:01 - work I would put it at less than 10% but
121:05 - we will give ourselves a little drumroll
121:07 - nonetheless
121:14 - you got a little louder for a fact
121:19 - oh okay ah this is a really weird
121:24 - problem that happened that I know what
121:25 - it is very unexpected surprised how well
121:28 - this worked so this is a high density
121:31 - display a retina that Mac Retina display
121:33 - and so in order for there's actually
121:36 - double or quadruple the number of pixels
121:39 - then the actual 644 it might specified
121:42 - so I think I just need to manually say
121:45 - oh my god and I have killed this
121:46 - computer but I need to manually just say
121:50 - pixel density 1 and you know what let's
121:53 - make this let's just make this really
121:55 - small right now 200 by 200 just to see
121:58 - that it that's really let's not let's
122:01 - not okay so you can see how slow this is
122:06 - even just at 200 200 but it is working
122:10 - let's go down to 100 100 yeah so you can
122:20 - see it's just this pixel manipulation
122:22 - stuff is really really slow in the
122:25 - browser so this same exact sketch at 100
122:29 - byte you know that at that pixel
122:32 - resolution of 640 by 360 now there's a
122:34 - lot of inefficiencies and what I've
122:36 - coded that could be optimized but you
122:40 - can see how kind of chunky the animation
122:45 - is as opposed to and I can barely even
122:48 - tell it to stop as opposed to in oh you
122:52 - know what I'm running a lot of other
122:53 - stuff on the computer that certainly
122:54 - doesn't help but as opposed to in
122:56 - processing where this has no problem to
122:59 - render at a fairly reasonable frame rate
123:03 - so porting this to WebGL using shaders
123:05 - some how to operate the pixels there's a
123:08 - lot of ways that this could be could run
123:10 - really fast and I'm and I suspect if I
123:13 - look for like whirly noise you know
123:15 - WebGL I'm gonna find some really nice
123:18 - demonstration right and this I think is
123:21 - what I was referring to this book this
123:25 - book called the book of shaders here we
123:28 - go we can see here here's that same
123:32 - algorithm running
123:33 - or a similar algorithm running in WebGL
123:35 - with a shader code let's see what
123:38 - happens if I get further down yeah look
123:41 - at that and this by the way is what
123:42 - happens when you move the points around
123:44 - more thoughtfully oh these are just like
123:46 - what how are they moving they're doing
123:48 - like a night a nicer random walk this is
123:50 - the other thing that I really want to do
123:52 - I just want to move them according to
123:54 - some particular algorithm like flocking
123:57 - let's do that let's just add the
123:59 - flocking Gallagher there real quick or
124:02 - should I do the QA well flocking is kind
124:05 - of overly complicated hmm all right it's
124:09 - okay we're gonna make this happen this
124:10 - is worth it whirly noise so let me let
124:17 - me draw these features just so I see
124:19 - them and features the why did I get a
124:29 - negative width negative width divided by
124:35 - 2 - width / - yeah so this is where
124:40 - those feature points are what if I also
124:43 - move those feature points so I could
124:46 - just go back to the random of motion and
124:49 - that just makes it like jiggle a lot I
124:52 - want it to feel much more smooth so what
124:56 - if I get any of my nature of code
124:59 - examples
125:08 - send them off in a random direction that
125:10 - bounced off the edges of the screen
125:12 - that's probably what I should do let's
125:14 - just do that that's fine let's do a
125:16 - random direction I just need a particle
125:19 - class is the problem so let me let's
125:24 - let's look at what examples I have
125:25 - that'll do this nicely really fast under
125:28 - agents perhaps a flow field stay within
125:32 - walls this is a good one to do arrive
125:35 - path following separation flocking a
125:39 - separation one might be kind of
125:40 - interesting let's look at I mean I could
125:47 - do the wandering one also oh the camera
125:52 - went off again I wonder why
126:07 - battery exhausted Oh like what's the
126:15 - cable loose
126:27 - that's what's going on let's give it a
126:30 - minute see if it charges up again it's
126:34 - charging now I had it I had this camera
126:37 - plugged in but that's why it was going
126:40 - off okay should be fine now
126:41 - ooh there we go all right let's just do
126:49 - so this is I'm gonna leave this as an
126:50 - exercise to people watching this I have
126:52 - so many different kinds of emotions
126:53 - behaviors but I'm gonna go with I'm
126:58 - gonna go with something much simpler and
127:00 - let's just look at an example from
127:04 - chapter one which is like bouncing ball
127:06 - let's just grab this one so I'm going to
127:09 - get this class which just has it's a
127:12 - nice like quick bouncing ball class and
127:16 - I'm just gonna call this a particle and
127:19 - let's just change this to particle and
127:24 - we want to make this a random vector so
127:27 - this gets these each get a random
127:30 - position all right okay hold on a sec
127:38 - hold on everybody's this is what I need
127:40 - right this is these are going to become
127:42 - particles now so this is gonna go in the
127:47 - particle class the velocity is going to
127:49 - be a random velocity what's
127:57 - and then this looks weird okay I don't
128:02 - know what's going on here but this is
128:04 - fine and then we're gonna update the
128:06 - plot bossy it's gonna bounce off the
128:08 - edge we have a display function in case
128:10 - we need it so now the features are
128:14 - particle objects and there are twenty of
128:18 - them there are particles the position
128:20 - gets picked inside and then now the this
128:29 - is a particle or actually its features
128:31 - dot position and so that all that stays
128:35 - the same and now for each of the
128:38 - features what I can do is I can say
128:47 - particle P equals features index I and I
128:51 - can say P dot of display so let's just
128:53 - make sure this works so there we go so
128:56 - these are the particles and now it's
128:57 - doing the noise based on those particles
128:59 - and now if I call update on them they
129:04 - should move and I want them to move much
129:07 - faster than this so let's give them
129:10 - let's increase their velocity to like
129:15 - multiply them each by like five and
129:19 - there we go now it's sort of hard to see
129:21 - what's going oh because let's not draw
129:26 - them looks like it's running much slower
129:32 - yeah so in addition to oh the camera
129:35 - went off again but in addition to the
129:39 - slices they're actually moving let's get
129:43 - rid of the slices for a second let's
129:46 - just override
129:47 - let's not increase the angle let me just
129:51 - give you just the computer for a second
129:53 - I'm gonna get rid of the slices so now
129:55 - you can see this is what it looks like
129:57 - with them moving
130:06 - [Music]
130:08 - so anyway you've seen now many more
130:11 - possibilities here
130:12 - let's truncate the the QA is ready we're
130:16 - gonna we're gonna switch we're gonna try
130:18 - the QA so we try to go to just it's
130:24 - charging
130:26 - hopefully it's not charging fast enough
130:29 - so let me see first I'm gonna go into
130:33 - the discord on this computer I've got to
130:37 - do a couple things pots getting dark in
130:39 - here weird sort of way okay so let me
130:41 - open up the discord we're gonna try this
130:43 - Q&A everybody get loopback this court is
130:46 - on so now we should if I go discord this
130:53 - is very exciting this is a very exciting
130:57 - moment here a fear first Q&A with live
131:00 - talking where should I go here should I
131:04 - go to so I guess I can just leave this
131:06 - open because I'm in streamer mode I need
131:11 - to go to the coding train Q&A there's
131:15 - lots of notifications I should go to
131:17 - which channel which channel do I go to
131:22 - bot talk no voice chat Q&A talk so I'm
131:28 - going to join that channel hello done
131:32 - okay so I think your hello Dan just went
131:37 - out through to the live stream everybody
131:41 - can everybody thumbs up in the live
131:42 - stream that you heard a hello Dan I also
131:49 - hear a typing this is my ear and I see
131:51 - you I'm just gonna show you what the way
131:53 - I have this I'm using a piece of
131:54 - software called loopback I'm gonna close
131:57 - it let me open up the this again so this
132:01 - is the software that I'm using and
132:03 - basically I'm taking the audio from
132:05 - discord and it is going into USB capture
132:08 - which is what's going to the live stream
132:09 - but it's also going here into my into my
132:15 - earphones is that a word your phone's I
132:18 - think it is this is and by the way this
132:23 - is coming from the sound boards so if I
132:26 - play this so I'm ready for some Q&A
132:32 - I don't know how how this is gonna be
132:33 - manager if I should be having the
132:35 - discord open I could look at it on I
132:37 - could also look at the discord on my
132:38 - computer over here let's try let's try a
132:40 - couple questions
132:41 - it says Wow Wow there we go I have a
132:48 - suspicion that it might be Simon who
132:49 - joined first yes we hear sigh that's
132:57 - right go ahead Simon sir what is your
133:07 - question I think I think I don't think
133:37 - everybody getting to hear Simon's voice
133:38 - is an exciting moment and if you haven't
133:40 - checked out Simon's channel I think if
133:44 - you just search Simon Tiger on YouTube
133:46 - probably it will come up I can confirm
133:49 - that that's the case
133:50 - by just typing in going to YouTube
133:53 - typing in YouTube Simon Tiger let's see
133:57 - and here we go this you can find Simon's
133:59 - YouTube channel where he has lots of
134:01 - exciting coding videos right here
134:04 - exactly before we go to the next person
134:06 - I see there's a lot of people in the
134:08 - YouTube chat still asking question all
134:11 - right not too sure about how to join so
134:14 - for those people you can join the
134:16 - discord and then in just go to the
134:19 - bottle channel and there'll be a little
134:21 - text in there how to join the Q&A and is
134:24 - the audio balance
134:26 - better now would be a question
134:27 - unfortunate a little bit quiet for me
134:29 - but I lowered it I'm sure I can figure
134:32 - I'm sure I can manage that I can still
134:34 - hear it so it's fine well work that out
134:37 - next time but hopefully the audio
134:39 - balance is better X I can turn this down
134:46 - here hold on I write and then turn this
134:50 - up here
134:52 - Koby can you talk for a minute again
134:54 - let's see how it is yeah all right so
134:57 - that's all right so that's much better
135:01 - in terms of my volume but I'm curious
135:04 - what the levels are for the audience on
135:06 - the live stream yeah we have to wait
135:11 - about 36 no it's low so that's so easier
135:30 - for easy for me to raise it so I'll just
135:31 - raise it up a tiny bit and that should
135:33 - probably be a little bit better now
135:35 - there we go
135:36 - okay I think we might move on to the
135:39 - next verse yeah hello hello Nikki
135:46 - various stuff I want to stand German so
135:48 - I'm sorry for anything oh no you're
135:52 - doing great
135:53 - we're in Germany are you thank that's
135:57 - nice Bob hey I don't know if you know
136:01 - about it
136:02 - I you know I've been to Germany and but
136:04 - I owe I spent most of my time when I was
136:07 - there in Berlin so that's my American
136:09 - knowledge of the geography so what
136:14 - what's your question today um I want to
136:18 - know that you know about to silage
136:20 - rendering because um most triangles in
136:23 - 3ds rendering our Energon to sites so
136:26 - one is invisible or both are visible at
136:29 - the same time processing that could be
136:34 - the problem why you couldn't set the out
136:35 - to zero
136:37 - okay the way you play was my suggestion
136:40 - yeah okay so if I'm here in and if you
136:48 - know you won't be able to see see my
136:49 - screen where I am in because the
136:51 - livestream you're the euros like 30
136:54 - seconds ahead of the livestream but is
136:56 - that the two-sided rendering is there
136:58 - like a setting that I can change in
137:00 - processing that would just you're saying
137:02 - that we just fix this or you're just
137:05 - like the concept of you're talking about
137:08 - the concept of two-sided rendering and
137:09 - you're wondering if that's something
137:11 - that's the reason yeah so I think yes I
137:16 - think that is the case I also recall
137:19 - that there is a way there's that it's
137:23 - having this issue before and it could
137:26 - also be related to the order by which
137:28 - I'm drawing things but but you're an
137:31 - idea sounds a bit more sounds right to
137:34 - me because it it was like when I just
137:36 - looked at the other side of it so if I
137:38 - open up the cube right now because it
137:41 - looks very different one side versus the
137:43 - other it's it's dark on this side and
137:45 - brain on this so yeah my I think you're
137:47 - probably right okay
137:50 - I think that's the work because from one
137:52 - pipe it's passing through so you can see
137:54 - on one side but on the other side like a
137:57 - claim cuz you can't be Foucault z alpha
138:01 - is still sick yeah so III I think that's
138:05 - probably right you know to be honest
138:07 - like I do so little 3d stuff but I guess
138:10 - if I search like two-sided rendering
138:14 - processing you might get some we might
138:17 - get some I guess well I probably need to
138:20 - type in processing Gord we might find a
138:22 - solution eventually excellent thank you
138:26 - for that suggestion I think you're
138:27 - probably right that that's what it is
138:28 - okay thanks thanks for calling in
138:32 - what remind me your name again my name
138:35 - is neither Nisa yeah awesome this is fun
138:42 - like this is like a coding talk show it
138:45 - probably wouldn't be good for people to
138:46 - join in video in some ways but it's nice
138:48 - to hear people's voice
138:49 - so thanks should we try shall we move on
138:51 - and try another question yeah sure
138:53 - discord moderation magical people Oh bye
138:57 - bye thanks for calling in this is still
139:04 - run I think David's might have slightly
139:06 - broken the ball okay well you know I
139:11 - think I'm gonna have to wrap this up
139:12 - pretty soon anyway this was a bit of a
139:14 - test to sort of see how it might work
139:20 - for to do like a QA you know I kind of
139:23 - wanted to do a some kind of like special
139:27 - thing to celebrate 1 million subscribers
139:30 - you know I have to admit it didn't
139:33 - really happen because I'm just gonna
139:35 - mute this for a second yeah I'm hearing
139:38 - a lot of noise and the check is I should
139:40 - keep this open oops
139:43 - but I don't know with the with the
139:48 - global crisis that we're all finding
139:50 - ourselves in it didn't really feel much
139:52 - spoken billion subscribers but and I've
139:56 - just been sort of focused on other
139:58 - things like getting through the day and
140:00 - doing a little something every day
140:02 - dealing with and helping family and
140:04 - friends out but at least we got I got
140:08 - this live stream out and we got in this
140:09 - sort of test of this voice system what
140:12 - might make more sense is to do this as a
140:15 - separate thing maybe just once a month
140:17 - it could also be something that I do
140:19 - just as with a smaller group as a
140:21 - benefit to people who are patrons or
140:23 - members you know I'm certainly not in
140:26 - the mood to ask people to join right now
140:28 - I know so many people are struggling
140:30 - financially and out of work and you know
140:31 - there's no there's no need for anybody
140:34 - to join pakodi trade right now but this
140:38 - is a nice thing to be able to do are we
140:40 - - are we are we set up to maybe try one
140:43 - more person or should I should we wrap
140:46 - it up for today the next person sent me
140:50 - the the question he wanted to ask
140:52 - because it doesn't have a microphone Oh
140:54 - what what coding languages do you know
140:57 - okay who am I talking to right now
141:00 - obligate
141:04 - the voice was soda liner one of the
141:07 - moderators oh okay yeah they're quite
141:09 - what coating last bite are the great
141:11 - yeah so what coding languages do I know
141:13 - I would say that let me try to do this
141:19 - in order of how many learned them so the
141:22 - first programming language I ever did
141:24 - was in elementary school in the 1980s
141:26 - was basic and basic programming language
141:30 - on Apple 2 plus then I didn't program
141:33 - again at all until maybe middle school
141:36 - or high school I think I should learn
141:37 - some assembly language then I didn't
141:39 - program again at all until I was maybe
141:44 - like 22 or 23 and I took like an evening
141:46 - course kind of guessing here in C and I
141:51 - was kind of like not for me then then I
141:55 - went to graduate school at ITP which is
141:57 - the program where I teach now at NYU and
142:00 - there I learned the lingo programming
142:03 - language which is invented by John Henry
142:05 - Thompson if you're not familiar with
142:07 - John Henry Thompson you should be a
142:09 - luminary
142:10 - in the world of creative coding this is
142:13 - John Henry Thompson I'm pretty sure if I
142:15 - search go to videos you'll see he came
142:18 - and was a guest on the coding train at
142:19 - one point but invented the lingo
142:21 - programming language which was the
142:23 - language for Macromedia director so
142:26 - that's what I first that's where I
142:27 - really first was programming because I
142:28 - was doing it intensively in an intro
142:30 - class from there I learned Java I
142:32 - learned C and C++ but so I know all
142:36 - those languages that I have described
142:38 - but I would say probably Java is the one
142:41 - that I spent the most time with and then
142:44 - started working on after I learned Java
142:46 - was working with processing which is
142:48 - built on top of Java and more recently
142:50 - in the last five or six years I've been
142:52 - learning and doing stuff in JavaScript
142:54 - so Java and JavaScript are the ones I
142:56 - probably know the both most and Python I
142:58 - could make my way around if I need to
143:00 - I'm often like calling finding Python
143:03 - scripts and running them who's a part of
143:05 - a project or a thing but it's not
143:07 - my expertise so those would be that's my
143:10 - that's my long-winded summary of all the
143:13 - programming languages I know I think
143:16 - there might be a follow-up question
143:17 - coming okay
143:18 - well nevermind it's just saw the great
143:20 - thanking you answering the question
143:22 - excellent all right so oh look camera
143:28 - keeps going is it because of the battery
143:31 - must be that it's not then I didn't have
143:34 - it sitting and charging and the battery
143:38 - is just very very low turning it back on
143:41 - so I think maybe I'm gonna wrap up for
143:43 - today I don't know if battery exhausted
143:48 - yeah I don't know if I have an idea here
143:54 - is another camera I have where I am this
144:00 - is the camera that I had on the drawing
144:02 - whoa very close yep for one more
144:05 - question we had one yeah yeah let's have
144:07 - let's have that question come in with my
144:09 - giant head
144:15 - [Music]
144:26 - dc-6 are you able to speak
144:39 - tt6
144:43 - it might be broken
144:45 - give me two seconds I will do mine is
144:48 - unmuted him manually so if you can if
144:52 - you want to ask a question go ahead you
144:59 - should build a Speak Now DT six some
145:14 - technical difficulties apparently he is
145:17 - able to speak he's not muted currently
145:20 - so I think it might be a mic issue
145:21 - unfortunately yeah you're welcome to
145:24 - type your question I'm happy to try to
145:26 - answer it but Wow while we're waiting
145:30 - for maybe the question come and read it
145:32 - out okay great
145:34 - well waiting for the question to come in
145:36 - so this was this to me as much as it
145:39 - took me like a half an hour to get a
145:40 - little bit more comfortable and get over
145:43 - my own like anxiety confusion about live
145:47 - streaming from this setup I think that
145:49 - this went pretty well and I'm hoping
145:51 - that I can get back up and running with
145:53 - live streaming once a week I don't think
145:56 - my like recording to disc stuff worked
146:00 - really well so I don't know if the
146:02 - whirly noise example will get end up
146:04 - being edited into its own video that
146:09 - would then have a coding trade page
146:10 - associated with it so if you're not
146:12 - familiar if if I just go to the coding
146:16 - train website all of the coding
146:20 - challenges and the coding the Cabana
146:22 - videos and other tutorials as well if I
146:25 - go to any given page like let's go to
146:27 - one that I know has a bunch like that
146:30 - maybe this raycasting video if I go here
146:34 - to the challenge page you'll see all
146:36 - these community contributions we have a
146:38 - system for you if you make of your own
146:40 - variation of it to collect all these but
146:42 - I don't know that I'll have a whirling
146:45 - noise page but I would love to be able
146:47 - to collect all the whirly
146:51 - projects if people make variations of it
146:54 - and I certainly will upload this code so
146:56 - let's think about how we could share
146:58 - that the discord is certainly a way so
147:00 - maybe we can have a discussion in the
147:02 - discord after the stream is over and you
147:07 - know fake and create a web page just for
147:11 - the worldly noise because I do think the
147:13 - whirling noise code opens up a lot of
147:17 - possible variations and I'm sure a lot
147:18 - of people watching will have clever
147:19 - ideas about how to visualize it even
147:22 - without an animation just to sort of
147:23 - like render a high-res version of the
147:25 - image with thinking about color and
147:27 - texture in different ways so I'd love to
147:29 - be able to collect those so if you're
147:30 - watching now and you're not in the
147:32 - discord and you want to discuss that
147:33 - join the discord we'll figure out a way
147:35 - to collect those we could also obviously
147:37 - you can share those with me on social
147:38 - media at Schiffman on twitter at the
147:41 - coating train on twitter there's
147:42 - actually a coding trade Instagram the
147:44 - coding train so let's I would really
147:47 - love to see if you're working on
147:48 - something whirly noise from this also
147:50 - maybe what I can actually do is just
147:53 - kind of redo this but in with the coding
147:56 - in the Cabana setup so I could click
147:58 - sort of refilm the whirly noise just
148:01 - sort of walk through just do it again
148:03 - into the editor together to make it a
148:05 - its own standalone video okay I hear a
148:08 - voice okay six yeah it's background
148:11 - noise for me I'm sorry didja six
148:13 - question is where is the remark encoding
148:17 - Xiamen ah where is the ray marking
148:20 - coding challenge so the I don't I don't
148:24 - think I have a proper ray marching
148:26 - challenge I have this ray casting kind
148:33 - of the same thing but different and I
148:36 - have this rendering ray casting so these
148:37 - would be the ones oh you don't see what
148:40 - I'm looking at Oh my whole setup is kind
148:43 - of broken right now but there's these
148:44 - two challenges that you could take a
148:45 - look at if you're interested in more
148:48 - sort of like proper ray marching I
148:50 - believe that Sebastian lag has a video
148:54 - tutorial about it coding adventure ray
148:56 - marching so if you're not subscribed to
148:58 - Sebastian laggs channel it's really
148:59 - excellent
149:01 - there's lots of really wonderful
149:05 - tutorials and well I don't know the
149:07 - tutorials is the right word but sort of
149:08 - its explanatory video essays in a way
149:12 - about different algorithms which we've
149:14 - done in unity with 3d so but methey that
149:18 - I'm really planning to do soon I was
149:21 - thinking of doing it today is I really
149:23 - am
149:23 - speaking of Sebastian leg lag is a
149:26 - marching squares marching squares is a
149:29 - wonderful algorithm to create I have a
149:32 - video where I made these meta balls
149:33 - pattern also known as meatballs but you
149:37 - can create this kind of animation
149:40 - with the marching squares algorithm as
149:43 - well so I don't that really answered
149:46 - your question but that was a followed by
149:49 - Simon who says you do have a rate
149:54 - marching livestream it just hasn't been
149:56 - editors into a video
149:58 - really apparently lively 177 just can't
150:05 - remember this at all
150:07 - look now there's double me okay you can
150:10 - see this is this camera right ray
150:15 - marching livestream 177 yeah I think
150:24 - this is oh you know what though I think
150:27 - I just caught it's just the title is
150:29 - called ray casting and ray marching
150:31 - because I didn't I think if my memories
150:33 - is correct
150:34 - I think I didn't know what I was doing
150:36 - investigate this are they the same thing
150:38 - are they different and you know to be
150:42 - honest right now I wouldn't be shocked
150:45 - if I got it kind of mixed up but my
150:47 - memory is that the algorithm that I
150:50 - implemented was more specifically
150:53 - related to the term Ray casting and Ray
150:56 - marching is a little bit different so
150:58 - there's maybe there's somebody in the in
151:02 - the discord voice channel who knows
151:04 - precisely the answer this could just
151:05 - pipe in and
151:06 - and and fill in all these gaps but that
151:09 - that's I'm pretty sure that the only
151:11 - thing that I did are those two
151:12 - particular examples ah Milan by the way
151:17 - in the chat rightz what is the best way
151:19 - to teach my nephew programming so I
151:21 - would say first of all the age of your
151:23 - nephew is a major consideration but I
151:26 - would say if your nephew is 12 or 13 and
151:31 - up
151:32 - certainly the this playlist of mine and
151:38 - again I'm not suggesting that my stuff
151:41 - is the best for teaching programming
151:43 - it's just that I happen to know what's
151:46 - there but this particular playlist code
151:50 - programming of p5.js is meant for a
151:53 - total beginner so you know I wouldn't
151:55 - necessarily suggest this for elementary
151:57 - school age although certainly some you
152:00 - know Simon viewer Simon was probably
152:02 - coding this up like in elementary smutch
152:05 - younger age but and really if you if if
152:08 - a an elementary school student is
152:10 - capable of typing then I think following
152:12 - this is possible but certainly middle
152:14 - school and high school and up all the
152:17 - way to any age really this is my
152:19 - beginner playlist for elementary school
152:22 - age you know I would take a look at
152:24 - scratch and I know that scratch has been
152:27 - doing some new initiatives with maybe
152:29 - sort of teaching at home and that type
152:30 - of thing but scratch is a is a block
152:34 - based coding environment I did actually
152:36 - a little weekend livestream last weekend
152:39 - doing some stuff in scratch it was not a
152:41 - proper tutorial but you could take a
152:43 - look at that as well because I did it
152:45 - with my children oh it's right here so
152:49 - you could look at this to our 40-minute
152:52 - live stream where we programmed in a
152:56 - couple projects in scratch okay so this
153:00 - I think I think I'm gonna wrap up the
153:03 - I'm gonna I'm gonna mute the audio in my
153:05 - ear if that's all right so thank you
153:11 - Coby and David and Nathan
153:14 - than anybody else in the chat who was
153:16 - helping with this test my intention was
153:19 - to do a kind of like more of a rigorous
153:21 - test with a smaller group but what you
153:22 - know why not just try it here live this
153:26 - live stream is wrapping up I would say
153:29 - one thing that would make me
153:30 - inordinately happy if that's the proper
153:32 - room magic to ever to have use right now
153:35 - what's this over here
153:36 - though top-secret control panel this is
153:39 - my top-secret discord control panel I
153:43 - didn't know I had this mute deafened so
153:46 - many possibilities but would be to see
153:48 - let's let's come up with a hashtag I'm
153:51 - gonna go to let's just go to my camera
153:53 - here I'm gonna go to I just want to see
153:56 - if I'm logged in on Twitter as anything
153:58 - I'm not so I can't post anything but
154:02 - let's let's come up with a hashtag a
154:05 - Twitter hashtag for whirly noise and I
154:09 - realize there's many libraries on
154:11 - Twitter it's not the best way to share
154:12 - this stuff but I'm gonna go out through
154:16 - the evening and weekend and it would
154:18 - make me really happy to see if people
154:19 - make stuff with whirly noise so what's a
154:22 - good what's a good hashtag David
154:24 - suggests all the noise I think we might
154:27 - need something that's related to coding
154:29 - train what if we did like choo choo choo
154:34 - choo noise
154:35 - whirly choo choo really choo choo noise
154:38 - noise choo sounds like noisy foo I don't
154:42 - know coding whirly noise that's that's
154:47 - pretty good whirly train
154:49 - whirly train is good let's do this
154:51 - whirly train Twitter comm hashtag and
154:55 - I'm a little bit of I'm afraid of the
154:57 - internet so I'm gonna just go back to my
155:00 - camera here and look at whirly train no
155:02 - results you could be the first you could
155:07 - be the very first to have a whirly train
155:09 - hashtag let's see if I can manage to to
155:16 - post something noisy little whirly
155:22 - tricky whirly bugs let's go let's see if
155:26 - I can manage the law
155:27 - to my Twitter here what's the chance I
155:30 - can do that it's gonna take me a million
155:35 - years through all my different
155:41 - protections so hard for me to log into
155:43 - anything because I have password manager
155:46 - I've got to factor I can barely get into
155:50 - my Twitter I'm gonna post my video don't
155:53 - see how it looks just give me a second
155:57 - maybe you will post something before me
155:59 - we'll see I'm gonna look at my password
156:01 - here which is some crazy sequence of
156:04 - characters for six well you know there's
156:09 - a 46 in my password good luck now
156:12 - deciphering it shift
156:15 - I didn't even type it incorrectly you
156:26 - know what actually be good is to always
156:28 - have the voice channel open you discard
156:31 - and for like in emergencies people could
156:34 - look like
156:34 - so yeah your mic went off or something
156:36 - like that really pickle that's pretty
156:37 - good okay wait I need an authentication
156:39 - code did I get it yes we have any better
156:49 - hashtag suggestions let's post okay here
156:57 - we go
156:58 - whirly train that we're going with
157:01 - people where Lee train Worley pickle is
157:04 - pretty good whirly train pickle really
157:09 - needs to go out for a walk well hi Stan
157:14 - everybody's behind whirly train we're
157:16 - early train whirly train and I'm gonna
157:21 - get my video I'm sure compression will
157:23 - kill it let's look at the let's see if
157:27 - all right I am now about to tweet and go
157:33 - back to this whirly train
157:35 - thanks for watching the livestream today
157:38 - everyone trouble writing my tweet
157:53 - somebody help me here stay home be well
158:11 - friends take care of yourself and each
158:22 - other let's give ourselves some nice mo
158:28 - jeez
158:33 - so our pickle emoji that's gonna be
158:36 - misinterpreted ah dog let's see there we
158:40 - go rainbow some stars think I'm I think
158:49 - I'm I think that's enough I think I did
158:52 - my duty
158:53 - all right how's this look everybody uh
158:57 - whirly train
159:07 - share share yours whirly train
159:27 - okay I think this is good I am going to
159:33 - post this tweet and say goodbye to all
159:36 - of you I will let you enjoy some time
159:41 - with pickle on my way out
159:46 - let's see if I can
159:49 - oops oops there's there's pickle and see
160:03 - you soon goodbye everybody thank you so
160:06 - much for tuning in thanks for bearing
160:08 - with me as I try to get used to this
160:10 - setup and figure out what it is that I'm
160:12 - doing and how I'm how I'm continuing the
160:16 - work that I do and also being mindful
160:17 - and conscientious of all the struggles
160:20 - and difficulties everybody's having and
160:22 - bring something good and useful and
160:24 - appropriate and say all the right things
160:26 - and be nice and everything that I want
160:29 - to be which is just to be a kind helpful
160:32 - person and so your feedback is welcome
160:36 - and I look forward to seeing you on the
160:38 - next live stream I wish I could just do
160:39 - this every day but I have a lot to take
160:41 - care of at home but I'll do my best and
160:43 - please your messages and thoughts and
160:46 - sharing your own visual ideas are always
160:48 - wonderful and I really appreciate it I'm
160:49 - gonna play you out with some of my
160:51 - ridiculous music like the this.stop song
161:12 - [Music]
161:25 - by the way if the discord voice Channel
161:28 - is still going through I should turn
161:32 - that off
161:33 - okay discord voice channels off now you
161:36 - can talk to I can hear you this this
161:58 - this this start song never forget to
162:00 - this start with somebody composed that
162:02 - song for me
162:14 - how long is this
162:25 - so this is random this is noise Perley
162:28 - noise that is in the core random
162:30 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
162:32 - itself those numbers aren't related at
162:35 - all you pick like I'm picking random
162:37 - numbers between zero and ten nine two
162:39 - seven six one nine four eight nine to
162:44 - one thirty I think nine why apparently
162:46 - but with curly noise I might pick
162:48 - numbers like this two three four three
162:50 - four five six five four five six seven
162:55 - five my microphone is still on my
162:57 - microphone now this is like Perlin noise
163:01 - performance part birthing noise but with
163:22 - purely noise I might pick numbers like
163:24 - this
163:26 - three four five
163:31 - by purling noise that is early noise
163:34 - this is Hurley noise that is Hurley
163:36 - noises this is Hurley noise that in
163:37 - Berlin oh so this is Hurley noise that
163:39 - is her pearling no Hurley noise this is
163:45 - this is but with pearly noise I might
164:05 - pick numbers like this
164:06 - [Music]
164:21 - this is like Perlin noise performance
164:24 - part unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes
164:28 - what else is there yes kids thank you
164:33 - very much kittens and rainbows and
164:34 - cupcakes notice that look what I get
164:38 - [Music]
164:55 - [Music]
165:06 - [Music]
165:21 - [Music]
165:31 - [Music]
165:48 - [Music]
165:56 - and I feel just sort of like a nice
165:58 - feeling of relaxation everything's gonna
166:01 - be okay today dream is not broken it
166:04 - does not frozen this isn't this is a
166:06 - wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it
166:08 - I'm really getting to something I need
166:10 - my sound
166:17 - [Music]
166:22 - okay
166:26 - [Music]
166:36 - [Music]
166:40 - all sorts of text generation analysis
166:43 - things
166:44 - [Music]
167:06 - [Music]

Cleaned transcript:

test one two check one two one two check how is boxing how is my audio how is my audio relative to the music very I should be live in just a minute you check one two testing the sound again this time for real I think it's everything is working alright here I am here we go polar to Cartesian coordinates polar to Cartesian coordinates all are to Cartesian coordinates hey welcome to oh no train was sold no bail where did I put these things pickle pickle I have a new sidekick you can't see my sidekick I gotta get a sidekick cam and this whole extra camera here which will allow you to see my little sidekick cam but oh wait where you going pickle I don't know wait a sec oh there we go excuse me everybody hold on a sec can we start can I start over let's start over we're gonna start over okay pickle all right we're putting on this music we are going back to the opening screen and coming to you live from Brooklyn New York it is the coding train with your host me Daniel chief mod and it's coding buddy okay welcome all right I'm back I'm attempting to get back into live streaming it's very hard for so many different reasons and I know everybody around the world is dealing with so many different kinds of things and I hope that me just being here you know possibly once a week if I'm lucky maybe even more making some coding tutorials say hello bringing some sunshine and cheer and ridiculously Wow the music is actually quite excellent my interpretation and maybe my use of the music I could do a better job of but you know here we are I've got a green screen that's a little upgrade for today I've got a one of these blue microphones yep that's working I have a headset which currently there's nothing going on in here but if I had a producer they could like tell me when I'm getting things wrong like my physics formula is off and my code is broken I could hear them in my ear so you eventually could talk to my ear if if things go well it's 400 p.m. Eastern time right now and we can make it till you know 530 6 o'clock an hour and a half or two hours towards the end I might like to see if I can answer some questions I got to introduce you to pickle pickle pickle is sleeping so calmly here on the floor I think it's worth it here okay come on let's see Oh all right what's this gonna do um here where where are we gonna go here see there we go hi pickle say hi oh yes he's my little baby uh there she is oh girl good girl yes we're going to do some coding train together yes good girl good girl good girl okay okay putting this hook back wherever I was supposed to be which is here what's the chance this is in the right spot um maybe this is where it's supposed to be that's better this is for my diagramming um and there we go erase here oh wait where what happened to my sound board well the battery died oh no but it's plugged in I should be getting charged charged power Oh No oh it says it's not plugged in but it is plugged in all right I have no soundboard right now sorry that's really keeping me sane um I lost my sound board Here I am oh wait mark Rober is live streaming right now I thought that was at four o'clock on a Friday mmhmm yeah go watch mark Rober I'm just here doing guys I'm not even like sweating I've no idea what I'm doing I'm gonna do a some coding tutorials I think I mean I'm gonna be talking hopefully more than just all right I have another idea let's see if this works let's give me power come on sound board you can do it well again this be cable Oh which way do you go oh this way there we go I've got power I've got power got power okay all right okay pickle how would do it there I need another I definitely need another webcam okay wrong one here we go all right welcome to the coding train I and Dan I am at home as almost all of us around the world are I am in New York City at particularly in Brooklyn which is definitely a scary and place to be these days and I hope that all my neighbors are doing well I hope that you're watching this are doing well and I'm trying to get back into the rhythm of doing work I teach classes of NYU those classes are happening remotely my kids are here being homeschooled I mean they have some some video calls with their teachers and classmates and work being assigned to them but they need a lot of help and supervision so that takes up a lot of time and energy you need to eat all the time there's a lot of feeding going on so my weeks are just kind of insane but we're we're we're here we're happy we're doing okay and I found that it's last week I managed to finally sort of get around to make trying to live stream it was Saturday this week's a little bit earlier it's Friday afternoon who knows maybe next week I'll be back to Thursday something a little bit different I have never actually done this and I'm not too happy about it actually I might want to change is that I'm sitting I might always stand when I live stream i like to pace around move around jump around uh just have that energy of standing and it's kind of like it lets me know that I am livestreaming I am performing in a way for the live stream and right now I'm sitting so I'm not so sure about that a little bit I also actually it's looking fine I have a secondary light if you look at this there's pretty there's like a pretty decent shadow here I have a new light which is coming from this side I have a new polarizing filter on my camera which I think is helping with the reflection in my glasses I really wanted to eliminate the reflection in my glasses which I think I've done a pretty decent job of I don't know I can't actually tell what I'm looking at you like yet see my monitor over here but I do have another light there's nothing this is the emperor's new light here but this I have a light that I could attach to here I was gonna put it right here and try to fill in the shadow but I'm not gonna worry about that right now I also need to figure out about recording to disk so that if anything that I do today has any value whatsoever that I could that I could do work with matsya who is the editor for the coding train and put together video that would get uploaded separately afterwards for example I'd like to try to do a coding challenge today I have my white board over here wait that's weird am i smaller oh no no that's fine this is what it should be and then this just goes to the full camera there we go so there's so let me think about this how am I going to work this myself no it's charge ago it's charging charge on up charge it up search it up people alright watching from Iceland that is amazing hello Iceland let's go to here I I think we should do some wheel spinning today I think we should just start with a wheel spin whirly noise these are things that are in the sort of pipeline marching squares what are some other like algorithms that I have not programmed recently that could be fun to do because I could just pick between these two I should just do whirly noise it shouldn't let's take a look at the coding training suggested topics the sitting thing is really weird I feel so low energy we've got some new ones that have been opened up recently two dimensional discrete fourier transform for images didn't I do that or maybe this has to do with an image processing on visualize common math algorithms take u lated pi let's see let's look often I assign them to myself when I feel like it's something I'm going to do auto encoder oak just do that that would be fun do Bonacci spiral I think I have I think I kind of did that already I've done a lot of these these are the open ones a lot of these have been done these are the two that I was sort of most recently thinking about looks you were Lee knows as just let's forget about that wheel spinning thing I'm gonna get to I'm gonna get to the wheel spinning Tetris let's just do let's do a coding project that is like totally manageable and look at these images it's that I that is manageable that will give me a pattern like this this might look like a lot of these look like a Voronoi tessellation which there's a whirly noise which is a variation of which is a kite you know it's named for Steven whirly but it's really cellular noise which can be depending on how you implement it you it's basically a you're getting this burrowing tessellation which is another coding challenge that I should do but look at this one interesting gizmos and games but but there's a there's some ways to get some interesting variety look at this I don't actually know how to get it to look like that that's interesting I know I feel like this I've seen ooh look at this these are interesting alright we're gonna attempt to do this I'm just like launching right into it I'm gonna open up processing there's gonna be a test now I need to record two discs so I'm gonna press this button here and I'm recording two discs I want to attempt to also record I want to attempt to also record the green screen separately and the software that I do that is um here and I'm just give me a minute here I didn't get a chance to do this in advance I talk amongst yourselves um let's see how do I create that virtual oh let's just do is there audio coming in no there might be though if I do this audio audio audio audio audio no audio sex there we go audio settings it's getting some audio from interesting from the camera itself I need to create a virtual camera I don't remember how to do new add input I'll be back in a minute sorry I'm setting up some good figure ancient stuff so I could record this greenskinned on its own which maybe is not really gonna video browse blank browse more more more virtual virtual Virtual Set no that's interesting video image camera virtual camera camera no that's the one that I want desktop capture virtual know what I want done this before on my other streaming computer this is fasiq go walk go watch mark rubber stream come back in just like five minutes tell me what's going on in there maybe I could do is there something that he's teaching that I could do a coding version of input virtual all right I got to look this up people I'm looking up on my vmax virtual camera is that not what it's called I guess I could just try to record this audio maybe I just need to do I know of an idea add input settings alright I think I might just have to record an TSE 29 1929 97 that's right audio recording alright let's just hit record and see what happens audio mixer oh there we go inputs Game Capture no no no I want to add an input oh I know that's what I can do add an input audio there we go browse no no audio but not a file don't be ridiculous what happens more audio input there we go add device yes the microphone is exactly what I want ok yes there we go I've got my microphone audio there we go now I'm gonna do record oh oh it is the monitor is on okay I'm on that's okay I can just mute this do you hear that weird echo you're gonna get feedback too okay there we go that's good now I'm gonna hit record and I put one fine and before it's fine let's just try that new file every let's say every 30 minutes and okay and am i recording I'm recording okay I'm recording oh look at me here okay alright I have to livestream today I made it like a last minute decision like I'm just gonna do it just gonna livestream today mark is doing a fullon physics class on how to weigh stuff without gravity complete with what I believe will end up with differential equations well I would say mark is doing an excellent job without having watched it probably well rehearsed prepare not just like configuring settings on another computer that's like over here I'm so sorry everybody not going well whirly noise tweaking of C points and colors would be necessary to make this look like stone oh let me I also need to record separately a screen capture here let's see how that works new screen recording Oh record entire screen chord ok so I think I'm recording now here I want to get the paper out cellular texture basis function 1996 and closest point basis okay I think that's I think I understand how this works we all want you to make Tetris I just do Tetris today it probably took I'm gonna come back at you Tetris that'll be fun just not today who ain't open a window let's see how my batteries are charging all right how's everybody doing good alright let's just give this a try no I let's pick oh my goodness pickle pickle is a little bit scared of my train whistle it's gonna be ok pickle ok about why you haven't made tetris yet it's an excellent suggestion all right yes ok I got it I got it all right Tetris with whirly noise instead of colors ok yes somebody's knocking at my door waiting to beat my microphone come on in what's going on I am live streaming right now just so you know yeah you want me to view the microphone hold on we've got it we've got a let's let's move to let me do this and mute the microphone okay I'm back I don't know why my sound word won't get any power should be getting power we're getting started in just a minute don't worry this is no professional operation like the Mars rover livestream just this is a very unprofessional publication have I lost all the viewers yet no I seem to be gaining viewers understand how that's possible okay I doubt this is gonna get edited into anything later but it's a good it's a good good practice alright welcome to a coding train coding challenge hi Bruno yeah I was gonna do I sort of felt like I should do one of these sir models which i think is interesting to look at you know why how how an infection spreads how social distancing or physical distancing whatever term you want to apply to that can slow that spread and there's an excellent visualization in The Washington Post on that from several weeks ago three blue one Brown did a video Simon Tiger one of has done well and I don't know I just I don't want to do something that I really have no real knowledge or expertise in I'm sure what I have to add to that discussion so I think I'm just gonna go with my usual stuff but I will consider that encouraging words all right here we go hello and welcome to my first coding challenge from home a new sort of studio set up that I have looks kind of like this I don't know how this is gonna go I've got a green screen behind me I'm sitting which is really kind of a problem in terms of my I think I think the Bloods not flowing to my brain properly I should probably stand up but what are you gonna do what are you gonna do Here I am I'm going to attempt to program whirly noise what is whirly noise what's the algorithm for worldly noise how can you program early noise and can I get an image and I can't take the point over there because I am have this little tiny area for myself this is not good I do not like this setup I don't like this setup I don't have a soundboard I made a mistake should just take I should've taken a nap I'm gonna go ahead and do this anyway won't work try again this this is a test Street this is not my actual coding trade livestream move the camera yeah hello and welcome to codec challenge whirly noise I'm going to attempt to program this algorithm that is I found over here move the OBS camera yeah yeah all right all right I promise you that I'm gonna get used to this and I'm gonna get the momentum going this is your first time watching I'm very sorry this is your second time watching if there's any if you're watching I'm sorry I I think I can I think I can manage to bring myself to start to code an example I just need to get over some sort of like mental block what's happening to me right now 425 p.m. alright dad we didn't get a 1 million special I know I know I'm having trouble I'm having trouble welcome to a coding trained coding challenge I have recording from a new studio set up so things might be a little wonky but I'm gonna try to make this video I'm gonna try to program this really noise thing I'm here in Brooklyn New York at home with some lights and a camera and a laptop and I'm sitting which is really weird and I don't know why I'm sitting but I should be standing I like to stand while I code I'm sitting everybody just take a deep breath with me and let's try to make something fun let's try to make something beautiful I'm gonna make a very simple version of just this algorithm and I don't think it's gonna take that long and from there maybe you can make your own creative twist on it share it we can and that'll be that that'll be something that's a thing we could do to learn something to enjoy ourselves and to be together through this medium of the internet video through a lens they know all right I have to give up on this and I've got to plug it in I've got to plug it in over what cameras falling no no do you hear a weird can I turn on slow mode not easily right now not easily I'm gonna plug this in over here really should charge this in advance this is gonna make everything good okay okay okay she's not used to being on my alright okay ready okay okay okay here we go we try this one more time we're gonna try this one more time it's nice that everybody is always leaving me friendly comments in the chat alright here we go welcome to the first coding train coding challenge from home gloria pickle and i are really into this new algorithm called whirly noise and she suggested it I think so at least no it was kind of pointed in the direction of whirly noise when I was looking at different web pages and I thought let's program it as the first coding challenge from home I've got a new set up things are probably gonna be a little bit wonky I'm just gonna I'm just gonna do my best honestly like if I'm recording this during a live stream I don't know if this is ever gonna make it to an edit video if it does I'll be shocked but the poor people who are watching this live stream have watched me try to get started coding something for just like the last half an hour and I've really haven't get to click all time but I think my friend my old friend here Gloria pickle she's going to help me out I'm going to be strong and get to coding something go back to sleep and we're gonna get started all right so what is whirly noise I've got oh shoot what happened my setup it's all messed up oh this is the wrong I was doing so well does it go this way back yeah back back come on whenever I move anything that's not I totally like my whole thing is out of whack okay so what is whirling noise first let's just have a discussion of what noise is and I want to visualize noise in a two dimensional canvas in a window on a computer and the way that I'm gonna visualize noise noise being another word for randomness is by setting every single pixel color of a twodimensional window to some pixel cups or some color and I'll just do pure noise randomness I'm gonna open up my processing window here and I'm going to add setup and I'm going to add draw I'm gonna make the window size 400 by 400 and let's run this and I've got my window over here I'm gonna save this as whirly noise I'm gonna draw a black background and then I'm gonna do a nice for loop I'm gonna loop over all the x's and all the wise I'm going to get an index a late it's the toss the typing noise it's good yeah I know processing processing okay so here I am in processing I am going to write setup and draw you know III don't think this needs to be and then this is this is how to get that there okay how's the font size by the way I'm gonna make this project in processing and I will also release a JavaScript version of it but because I'm going to do this operation pixelbypixel to be very slow in JavaScript canvas so without worrying about optimizing it right now I'm just gonna stay in a desktop environment processing built on top of Java so I have a setup function so I have a setup function up there which gives me my window size 400 by 400 and in the draw loop what I want to do is set every single pixel so every single pixel in the window is going to have an XY location I can iterate over every single thick pixel with a nested for loop I want these to be X's so this so this loop here looks at every single X and every single Y then what I want to do is set every pixel at that X&Y location so pixels index something to a random value so I have to figure out the pixels in a processing window or store the colors are all stored in an array a onedimensional array so I need to know for any given X Y what is the index into that array and there's a nice formula I can use where the index is X plus y times the width itself now this is something I've gone over countless times but I'm just gonna go over it again in this particular video let's say that I have my window that has one two three four that's five by one two three four it's five by five okay and if I'm looking over here the X is zero one two three which is right here and the Y is zero one which is right here now if I were to count the pixels individually zero one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen how do I get this number well it is how many over its X is three so it's three over four five six seven eight it's actually pixel number eight three plus five is eight then this pixel would be 13 and this pixel would be 18 because we've got to go five more down every row so the x value three plus the y value one times how many pixels are in each row five gives me eight this is the formula so I can apply that formula in my code here X plus y times width say pixels index and run the sketch I'm sure so we've got missing a really important detail let's run it and see what happens anyway yeah no pointer exception why did I get a null pointer exception because the pixels don't exist I mean they do exist I see them there they're pixels but they don't exist because I didn't know they exist they're there there are pixels that's what I said but I don't have access to them because they I haven't unlocked the key to them in memory and the way that I do that in processing is by calling the load pixels function pixels would be a pixel will be a good name for a dog sorry pickle her name is pickle not pixel I could call her pixel as a nickname pixel high pixel update pixels I also have to say update pixels once I'm done with the pixels there we go so now I have noise this is not whirling noise don't be misled by the title of the window I have whirling noise this is pure noise randomness now I just want to have it run once so I'm going to add no loop here so draw happens once and I just get a random set of pixels Lode pickles now so what I've implemented so far is noise but there are lots of other kinds of noise I probably have at least 10 videos on something called Perlin noise and a lot of the people argue is what I my videos that are called Perla noise is actually not really Perlin noise it's fractal noise or maybe it's gradient noise because Ken Perlin revised Perlin noise to something called simplex noise but simplex noise those are sort of interesting history to that but I was using in a different video open simplex noise and what all these different kinds of noise algorithms are they're all rooted in randomness at their core but something different happens along the way what I implemented here is literal just randomness the only algorithm is pick a random brightness value between 0 and 255 but each one of these has a different kind of twist on that with perla noise the idea is really to create a smooth noise and you get these nice textures that appear like like clouds or marble and you can do a lot with them so I would love in my life to implement every kind of noise that ever existed I've done some of these in different videos I definitely implemented them but I've made use of them but in this video we are going to do whirling noise another name for that is cellular noise okay whirly noise was introduced named for Stephen Worley in 1996 and there's this actual paper a cellular texture basis function so I encourage you to pause this video now and enjoy reading this paper I would love to do a dramatic reading of it for you but I'm not going to at the moment I'm just gonna stick to something very very basic here which is just following what literally written I'm gonna make my own through I'm rather than read the paper all the way through and try to follow that to build worldly noise I'm just going to follow this summary simplified slur that's on the Wikipedia page and there's really just two steps of this algorithm number one randomly distribute feature points in space and I could use a two dimensional space or a three dimensional space and actually what's interesting about this is I even though what I'm drawing here is a two dimensional space every pixel is in two dimensions I could think of the whirly noise space as three dimensional but visualize a slice of it I think that's the way I'm gonna start this to be perfectly honest so if I go back to we could be you know the first step is randomly distribute feature points in space I'm gonna make an array of P vectors we'll call that the features let's just make five of them and make each one a random point so each point has an X and a Y and a Z now the range of what the x and y are clearly within my twodimensional canvas of 0 to 400 I'm just going to consider it to be a box a cube where every dimension the width the height and the depth is all the same so I'll just use its own width for the Z come on back to me then just to understand that this is working I'm going to comment this out and I'm gonna draw all those points let's skip the Z actually and I'm gonna set a background so we can see them there we go each time I run this I'm gonna get a new set of points now I don't I'm not so worried about visualizing the Z I could do the interesting thing I could do is I could say let's make the stroke weight will map the features Z which has a range between 0 and width and I'll make that between 1 and like 12 so that way I can sort of see the depending on the Z value it'll be a larger or smaller point so you can see what's going on here as if this one is closer now the Prospectus with any kind of 3d perspective I'm just trying to get a sense of what the data is so now that I have that the next step is alpha then X is distance and closest point to X what does that mean I don't like my lighting a lady seems weird what's it there's a lot of people watching this right now which is giving me a little boost of energy this is by the way a nice little coffee mug here I guess there's some green in it but this is a drawn by my daughter in her art class class hmm can you put your laptop up you're looking down which is weird yeah and I've got this hat on too so I'm probably doing this I should stand should we both to standing it's too late I should move to standing I should move the camera back I should move to standing okay do I should I should I try to do this slowmode thing because I can I can make that happen how's my eye let me see how my soundboard is doing 12% it's up to 12% that's pretty good okay all right here we go because it's the Orioles no I'm gonna tell you something baseball is canceled which means the Orioles are tied for first place this is their year I think they might finish the year tied for first place okay move to standing please all right well what part of this was I on all right I'm trying to understand this noise F of n of X is distance to nth closest point to X see this shadow behind me is really bothering me had a soundboard and I can play some music the worldly noise thing is gonna I'm gonna continue that in a second don't worry it's gonna get good soon let's just see here see here how this goes I have these rechargeable batteries and I've just charged up I'm going to attach this light here well let's let's make sure it's actually going to turn on oh that's pretty bright okay that's good I don't know how long it's gonna last but okay here we go this open anything how's that how am I looking what's weird what's going on I don't know if that's better maybe I should just have this light over here about like two sides all right I don't know I haven't really improved anything but that's what it's gonna be all right okay where's my marker so I have my noise space with some number of seed points now what I want the next step is for any given X Y point which I guess is just really called X here so for any given X right here the noise function of X so I could have an F of 1 of X I can have an F of 2 of X is basically equal to the nth closest point meaning this is maybe these first let's let's draw these points in a more obvious way and then I will number them where's that other so we have this point this point this point this point and maybe I don't know another point over here so this is the first closest point this is maybe the second then this is the third I don't know I'd have to get out a ruler let's say this is the fourth and this is the fifth so the idea is but but I can choose a different n but for any given n I want to color this pic get a random value it's not it's it's random only because these seed points are randomly distributed but now that those points have been distributed the color for this particular pixel is specifically a function of the first closest point the second close point or the third closest point so going back to the code and let's make these let's make these red so that I'll be able to see them more easily let's put the pixels back in just make sure everything's working together let's make these points a little bit larger so I can see them better so now I want to look for every given pixel which point is the closest or actually I don't know that's like for every giver every given pixel I want a sorted list of the distances to all the points so right here I'm going to create an array of distances which is a new array how many values need to go in it the same number of values is the same number of seed points so features dot length then I need to loop over all those let's get the distance between oh actually I need to store the distance between what between the X and the y the given pixel that I'm looking at and the given feature point that I'm currently on in terms of this iteration cycle and actually we want to keep the Z here so these points I'm just looking at a slice where Z is 0 but I want the X the Y and the Z of all those feature points then you know what's lovely about this I could just sort them because it's just an array of floatingpoint numbers the processing has a sort function which knows how to sort and array of numbers so I can just say sort the distances wonder if that makes a new array well we'll find out and then I just need to get that distance let me get the closest one so this is this is if N and is 0 so just have everything name correctly in my code let's create a variable called N and set that equal to 0 so the distance I want to look at the ends closest it I want to look at the end closest distance in the array and then set that to be the color interesting we can sort of start to see little little circles that are going on here now I need to deal with some map in here the mapping is way right because what are these what's the range of these distances well it's somewhere between like I mean it really depends the cube is the width height and depth is all equal to 400 or or width is the global variable let's use a mapping so let's call the brightness I'll just call that B is map the distance which has a range say between 0 and width divided by 2 let's just take half of that and when it's really close I want it to be super bright when it's really far away I want it to be super dark so let's make that the color for every given pixel hmm what did I get wrong here I've got something quite wrong here map distance hmm this looks good to me I run it again I get a different result no oh wait I wonder if no no jurors distance or index the X the Y let's get rid of the Z for a second oh I guess I just um my range is really off because of the Z does depth space oh you know what's going on here I think I think the sort function in processing is making a new array yes okay so the sort function this sort function was not was sorting the array but it copies all those distances into a new array so that array wasn't actually sorted so I need to create a I need just to take the new array and said you said equal to itself and now let's put the Z back in oh well this is zero it's just that slice there we go that makes more sense let's create a lot more points I'm just curious people in that chat are very upset with my wasting of memory well you know life goes on interesting so I don't need to draw the seed points anymore so this is what I've got it looks a little bit strange mostly because of Maca said I'm not upset upset good yeah I'm gonna worry about the memory stuff in a bit but this is this is this is good enough right now so this has a kind of strange almost spherical like quality to it it's because I started with this 3d space and once again let me let me let's go back and let's just have 3d seed feature points 2d features so if I get rid of the Z point now I have you can see this looks much more like a Voronoi tessellation because literally what we have is every point is colored according to its closest to the closest point we have this looks exactly like a runway tessellation because the definition of a Voronoi tessellation is cells where cells that are divided by the dividing line where all the points in this cell are closest to a particular seed point or feature point you can kind of see these now because I'm coloring them according to the distance you get these kind of like glowing little spots and what's interesting about this is right now and I don't know I don't know what the frame rate is here let's let's take off no loop and let's let's let me just print the frame rate out for a second just to see am I even going to possibly get a reasonable animation here yeah I'm kind of running you can't see this because I'm covering it but I'm running it like five frames per second which is terrible let's go back let's go down to like 400 by 400 and just 25 seed points there's lots of things we could do to optimize this and I've got 30 frames per second because what I want to do now that I think will be fun to look at is what happens if I go through and look at do this same loop where I look at all the points and move them around randomly I'm gonna do essentially a random walk with each of them we could see we could see what's happening right if those points move around the whirling noise is interesting now I haven't done anything having them move smoothly or with any kind of thoughtful behavior but you could start to imagine if these points were moving with a flocking system or any other kind of thing that I've done in this channel it's pretty interesting what we've got let's go back to the 3d features yes the distances are much greater why can't I not get the 3d one to look like what I want I think I know what the issue is Andy let's move these around again kind of interesting you know might I guess the Z is so large that it might make sense to actually consider this something like oh because I'm at zero also Oh interesting you know what I should do I should really for this to make more sense I should really have this be a number like this I should really have the Z range like I want that slice to be in the middle of this cube that I'm visualizing so I think that that would make more sense and then I I think it's gonna kind of map yeah so this is this is more like what I was expecting to see in terms of whirly noise using a three dimensional space like bubbles in a jar okay I'm gonna let I'm gonna let everybody watching this who's gonna make their own version of this play with the motion and I'm not gonna worry about that right now and I'm gonna stick with a nice no loops just run at once okay so here's my whirly noise once let's go back to 800 by 800 I'm gonna double the number of points I really should quadruple the number of points yeah and here we go this is this is the whirly noise pattern I have now listen here's what's exciting about whirly noise this is really the same as visualizing a Voronoi tessellation but I've got an option here remember the idea is that I can I'm taking the nth closest point so what happens if instead of just using n at 0 what if I take one what if the distance is not what if the color is not a not mapped to the closest point but the second closest point so let's have that be right here n of one look at this we get a very different kind of pattern it's very crystal like so this is another kind of texture that you know a lot of these algorithms were developed to make textures that would be applied to 3d objects that it's really quite lovely what happens if I change this to 2 whoo well it's even it's even like more jaggedy there's lots of possible things that could happen here what if I change this to 3 interesting I have an idea what if now I have an R a G and a B so distance let's let's name these D 0 D 1 and D 2 for distance 0 1 & 2 and let's use 0 we're gonna use a different distance for the red green and blue component so the red color will be mapped to the closest point the green to the second closest point and the blue to the third closest point that's pretty interesting well this is way more fun than I imagined it would be I should probably do like hue saturation and brightness let's try that let's try color mode HSB 255 and I'm just I mean I could call these now HSB but I'm now doing hue saturation brightness so the hue is the closest point the saturation is the I'm gonna rename this just cuz it's super confusing so we're gonna do this as HSB color hmm pretty interesting pretty trippy trippy is what I'm seeing you know we could also do something where it's like plus frame rate modulus to frame cap modulus 255 so anyways I could like cycle through a sine wave here I'm gonna go back to the RGB that was a nice little tangent I went on but let's stick with RGB now Louis is asking can you control the drawn zaxis with the mouth so what's interesting here is that I am fixing the Z at zero so there's no reason why I couldn't look at different slices remember I'm looking at worldly noise within a slice I'm just leaning a slice of worldly noise in a 3d space so what if I made this Mouse X now unfortunately this is gonna render really slow I'm sure my frame rate is really slow oh I have no loop on but I'm also gonna need to take no loop off let's go back well let's leave it now I'm guessing if I were to move smoothly that's I would get a pretty odd no it shouldn't be Mouse X it should be Z equals map Mouse X which goes from 0 to with 2 between negative width divided by 2 with divided by 2 so that's really the full range of Z because remember I this I the 0 is the center of the of this cube and in the Z and along the z axis at least so I can see here I can start to sort of move now it's a very I I think what I what I want to do is I want to reduce the complexity here and go back to 400 by 400 just to see if I can make this smoothly animate oh it's really kind of nice let me zoom in on this for you this is moving through that Z space and I think it actually might be really nice to just animate this with a sine wave so let me give myself an angle and Z rather than being mapped to the mouse sine of that angle and you know I don't need you to use map it's very simple I can just take sine of that angle times width divided by two because sine oscillates between negative one and one and so now let me just say angle Plus let me just gonna move the angle by a little bit I'm missing a semicolon why is that running super ooh I think maybe you know maybe the awesome maybe oscillation isn't as interesting as I thought it would be no this is what I was just moving too fast yes this is what I was looking for it should come back right why did it stop I mean this doesn't need to be inside the loop right now there's a lot of activity toward the center and a lot less activity toward the edges I think I want the brightness to make this a little bit brighter I don't know what a good strategy for that is multiply it by a little something and that seems silly well that's kind of interesting some sort of an accidental additive blending effect that I didn't mean oh that's pretty interesting yeah this is more like us hoping just give it a little glow effect and maybe I might prefer the blue to be let's do it in the opposite let's have the blue be the sort of primary color here and the red be the secondary and green being the third color this is what I was sort of and can I keep a sort of bare minimum of color it really depends where the points are seated what if I have many more points so let's do something interesting here which is this is gonna be very very slow but I'm going to just to sort of see where we can get here what if I make this 12 I'm gonna make this like much higher resolution let's go a 1920 by 1080 now this is gonna run super super slow but we can see this is kind of what the pattern looks like but I can what I can do is I can save this out so I'm gonna call save frame Whirley in processing if you use save frame and this is a directory path so a folder and a file name what this is going to do it's going to name all of them it's gonna save every frame out as an image and name it on numbered 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 2 you can just let this run for a little bit and then I can render this to a movie file well this is this is this is really picking up let's get the music going I'm at 28% here in the soundboard so I can hook this back up I'm just gonna let this be a full screen you don't need to see me right now and we're gonna let this render for a little bit you hear the fan of my computer let me put the camera back on so I don't know if you can hear this this is the mic I'm moving it down to the can you hear that that's what the fan of the computer is doing okay this was really meant to be a coating in the Cabana video the keying is not so great here know what let's just let me give you this actually the other thing that's interesting is this is going to be a perfect loop I just realized because the sine wave loops am i muted now now the mics gone it came back though right am I still muted hmmm yeah the mic is back I don't know what happened with the mic I think that cable is just loose if you render the cube you could set the Alpha of every point that is black to 255 meaning you only see the spheres which would be very interesting yeah that I should definitely try it rendering this in 3d because I would love to see that I'm gonna take a short break and let this render for a little bit let's see how many frames we got so work I wish I had been more thoughtful about this because I could make us a perfect loop but we're up to 118 frames how many frames someone do the math for me if I'm going up by point zero one a full cycle would be 0 to 2pi so if does this calculator have PI in it scientific high times 2 divided by point zero one so 628 or approximately doesn't 628 images 628 frames where am I we'll get there should have made a full screen button 627 all right oh girl yes yes you're sleeping this through this whole coding challenge solar liner in the chat is saying I can import the slices into blender as a volumetric texture do I like that idea 520 she is just sleeping through this whole time we're gonna go for a nice long walk after we finish rendering this worldly noise halfway there there we go Victor's asking where's the cat let me see if I can find the cat there's two cats Oh camera went off not a coating Josh's asking isn't it always at home it is not always at home usually I record a studio space at NYU let's see would we would we want to try this fancy Q&A thing that I've that I've theoretically have possible now anybody want to call in from our supporters chat we want to test the calling capabilities if you had a question about this you want to ask Oh was I getting you heard of buzzing I don't think I'm hey oh yeah I did get an emergency alert on my phone New York City is seeking licensed health care workers to support healthcare facilities in need visit nyc.gov slash help now to volunteer also a brief rain shower will begin at 507 p.m. well by the way something that's exciting that's happening is if you're in the disk or if you're not in the discord Jason hagglund who is the illustrator for the coding train we see if I can get the discord link to go into the chat did that work I don't see it there we go is creative is working out some new emojis that's already up some new emojis of the discord soon can you please say hi to my friend it's his birthday his name is Nick Kerr so I don't know what your foot I guess what I'm one thing I'm curious to hear is how was how is this how's this vibe I should change the standing up which I try changing to standing up and see how that goes 400 frames what what number did we say we had to get to 627 we're getting there we're always there pickle a little pickle it's a good girl so what would be interesting I know there's two optimizations that would be meaningful to do here one would be to one optimization would be to use a quadtree or a bin ladin a spatial subdivision because to get the three closest points we don't need to check all the points everywhere we can register the points in certain quadrants another another optimization would be to use some to use with shaders frankly and there are some good resources for doing shape worldly noise with shaders which I will try to pull up on before I go I know I'm obsessed with getting all the way to 627 what time is it over here asks lemon it is 523 currently 524 p.m. Eastern Time let's see let's well and I'm gonna let this keep rendering but I think the book of shaders which is a wonderful resource for learning shaders um has a section on whirling noise possibly and I'm really filling up my harddrive here each one of these images is 2 megabytes 2.3 2.4 are you going to render the cube I would like to try that next yes definitely want to try that next we're getting there I hear the pitterpatter of feet which are not animal feet there are other humanoid creatures that live in this house I see one over there in this direction she is approaching the humanlike creature is approaching oh no she stopped doing something else what's operator number one over there I think what's going on operator number one why do we get there yet so close just like twenty five or six more to go so the s I can't say the name in the chat but why are the file sizes slowly increasing so right there they're increasing and decreasing and I think a lot has to do with just the there's a variable amount of color that's in each image and you know whatever the PNG file formats require like what you know based on the number of colors or the the actual pattern itself the file size I guess gets larger or smaller all right all right we got up to 628 we can stop this now I'm gonna stop this now let's come back to full screen here let's look at this folder so inferior we don't need these images let's look and see if our suspicion is right this is image 628 and let's look at image 1 did you memorize that image let's open this one and then let's go to 628 yeah they're they're basically exactly the same so let's go let's get rid of 632 all the way to 628 let's leave 628 just to be safe and now what the next thing I want to do so how do you render to a movie so I have a whole separate video tutorial about rendering to a movie and I'm gonna but there's a tool in processing called movie maker let's grab that movie maker and I'm gonna get this folder because I gotta open this back up again and if I just drag the folder in here you can see that it is pulling all the files from this directory I want to use the same size as the originals I'll stick with a frame rate of 24 I will keep the compression as PNG why not and I'm going to hit create movie and we're gonna save this we're gonna call this Whirley now we have more waiting to do it let's see what other questions I can answer I could use a HH rd as suggesting ffmpeg which also could be used it's going this is faster at least right much faster oh good you got a puppy you're six years old she's six years old time to go for a walk Thank You Rock respawn oh well so much for that my vmix crashed probably filled up the hard drive or something hope this stream is still working so I see in the discord Coby is setting up a but a way to manage up some QA which we'll just do for like 15 or 20 minutes just really is like a test so let's not get too overly ambitious I want to if we want to be done by 600 p.m. start the weekend I got to get out I got to get outside for a walk pickles got to go outside for a walk kind of check on my children but I wanted to test how it could work for people to call in be a discord and ask questions so because I have this headset which I will be able to hear people and I'll be able to send the audio from discord also out to through through the livestream as well okay we are done see how this went you can't close this now you can go to the desktop and we have it here let's open it up Oh what happened here we go little boy oops I forgot that I'm got pickle here in this one okay hold on let's let me give you a full screen view can i play this full screen full screen making an attempt here come on you can do it No can I export this to some convert stream let's try this this looks good right I don't know save as a file let's choose another destination Whirley export save let's see how this goes let's see what we get almost done here okay that's promising let's leave this opens with there we go alright everybody ready for this look what's appropriate music for this this is what we made today yay alright save well it's what save it as something else hey that's only five I got this down to like a 5 megabyte video file that's pretty cool alright alright what are some other things we could try before I go before II what before the Q&A we before we attempt the hat lets okay so let me do let me I'm gonna just freeze this I'm gonna whoa hold actually I think I'm gonna delete or just gonna move this to the desktop and let me save it swirly noise 3d so what I'm gonna attempt to do now is actually visualize it in 3d you understand exactly how I'm gonna do this like do some kind of like voxel visualization so let's see how I might do that yeah so let's let's keep it the way it is and I'm gonna change this to P 3d I'm gonna go back to just like 800 by 800 so this is what I get just looking at that 2d slice and now I need a triple nested loop where Z starts here this is Z and let's do let's do let's have like a skip factor of like 10 let's just do every 10 pixel right now I need another I don't and I'm not doing load pixels and update pixels instead I am saying push pop translate what am i translating to XYZ why do I have an error here oh because I have multiple disease we're gonna get rid of this X Y Z and we're gonna just draw a box that's of size 10 and let's give it a fill with an alpha just do I see what do I see here if I do this okay so that's that's what I was hoping for let's say no stroke let's make this skip and this should be the Skip size let's make the Skip much larger like 25 okay now what let's try adding mmm let's try adding that the easy cam piece of cam library just so I can kind of view it and the PC cam library allows me to sort of view this thing in 3d so if I go I'm just gonna look under examples just get the basic view cam example which is just hello peasy is all like what so I want to have a piece of cam instance then I want to create in setup a new PC cam I need the import statement up top as well I have a feeling it's gonna Center everything around zero zero let's just see what happens right so now this is the 3d space but I am NOT I want to be sort of further out away from it I think there's a way at that this 400 value must be like how far away I am from it yeah there we go so I'm further away but the corner yeah there we go so this is the cube but I think what I want now is to think of the space unfortunately as around the center so I need to do this for everything those are the random points and then also this for X Y so X X&Y also an in so let's see here I don't care about this index thing I'm not doing pixels anymore I must have it's all 3d I'm not using the color yet but let's sort of see okay so this is what I'm looking for I'm seeing this full cube I want to be much farther away from it is that I thought that's what this variable is yeah there we go there's the cube okay so I see the cube now dare I attempt to now color it with the RGB values whoa look at that that's pretty interesting what have I done a little weird whirly noise cube so it looks just like the textures on the sides I think I need I let's let's go back to just one color let's just go back to this idea n just as one color and Phil let's fill it at 255 but who I lost the mapping why did I lose my mapping no I just want to have one D keep this as n but what I want is for that mapping to be 255 comma this is the Alpha basically I want it to be the Alpha so I want the transparency to be based on the work the noise itself I feel like I'm not seeing through it in the way that I had hoped don't need to show the voxels can you now set the Alpha of every voxel that is black to zero that's what I think that I've done maybe I want the colors but also include let's just try this for a second yeah I think what if I do like additive blending Oh weird the Alpha is not working I think maybe the order that I'm drawing stuff something is off the transparency is definitely not working because look at one side versus the other something is weird what if I give it no fill stroke stroke alpha so that's pretty interesting and let's go back to n of zero I think somebody else with a more clever design abilities will have a nicer way of doing this there we go this is more like what I was looking for let's skip let's skip even more yeah this is kind of interesting I mean I don't know what I've really got here but cubes with different sizes oh that's a very clever okay let's try to do the size so this is the size which we will have when it's closed the size is large that's skip value all the way down to zero we're gonna have no stroke and we will have the fill consistently be 255 with an alpha and this is now the size and like this idea whoa this is good now we're talking whoa that's wild okay I should go back to the RGB colors too yeah this is more interesting here there's definitely like a weird kind of Z sorting order and let's let's just make this smaller and let's see can I get down to a smaller skip yeah let's make this zoom out a little bit more I think actually I don't know why I'm yeah I can just do this with a scroll ooh so by having trouble controlling it oh so there we go here's my whirling noise cube and what happens if I use instead of an N of 0 and n of 1 let's give some lights here weird okay I think I'm finished for today it's 545 how are we with our possible QA setup so I will remind you let's go let's get let's go back to the original whirly noise I'm going to comment out the save frame function and I'm also going to reduce the size down to like 640 360 and let's just make 20 points yeah there we go so this is a nice version that will run in real time invert the cube size that's kind of an interesting idea let's let's try inverting the cube size no I can't open it up nope that's my audio application there you go the 3d one go there it is if we invert it this would be zero to skip I think this will actually look the same so maybe it won't like have a similar quality to it yeah because it's just sort of like the noises flipped but now let's quickly very very quickly I want to port this to a p5.js and just see if it'll run in the browser okay so while we're seeing it works if you want to do it okay so the QA is ready so what instructions do I need to give to people we're just gonna try this as a test maybe we're gonna do one or two questions somehow see if we can get that working with people coming in via voice let me know it's ready so you have to be in the discord if you want to participate and it's gonna be sort of random right now I think what I maybe I don't know if we should limit it to like people in the supporter chat or ever let the people in the discord that out probably should test this I'm the idealist to test this with the smaller of them YouTube members first but what are you gonna do alright so let me go to the browser and let's go to the p5 editor let's login why am i not logged in here oh there's a cat okay so now let's just paste this in and let's see if we can get this to work in p5 so there's what do I need to change so this is just an array this is just a plain old variable this now you can just do this we can just hard code this as 20 this is create vector this is function draw function setup create canvas let how am i doing background zero little pixels let let let let let let let let okay equals features index I and the distance is between X Y Z and V dot XV know that that still is the same sort I think still works let let let let let let now here's the real ah the big thing that's different is this so this needs a times four because unlike in processing the pixels in p5.js have four spots alright so I'm just gonna polish this for a second to let you know what's happening with the Q&A so if you or in here's a link to the discord that's going in the YouTube chat if you haven't joined go to the QA talk channel in the general section then you need to go to the bots talk channel and then you need to send a message which is question mark you space join and wait for your turn I'm gonna open up discord here at some point but that I guess and maybe there's people there chatting who can help you index okay whoops we're gonna take calls here live on the coding train this is going to be new just voice calls right now we can do video at some point then I need to say pixels index plus 0 is the red value plus 1 is the green value 2 is the blue value and then I need to set the alpha myself manually to 55 so unlike in processing where you put a full integer color into a spot in the array what you do here is have each the RGB and alpha values are in separate spots in the array itself and so for the x wise you look up that point and multiply it by 4 I think I've got everything here what did I miss what's the chance that this is gonna work I would put it at less than 10% but we will give ourselves a little drumroll nonetheless you got a little louder for a fact oh okay ah this is a really weird problem that happened that I know what it is very unexpected surprised how well this worked so this is a high density display a retina that Mac Retina display and so in order for there's actually double or quadruple the number of pixels then the actual 644 it might specified so I think I just need to manually say oh my god and I have killed this computer but I need to manually just say pixel density 1 and you know what let's make this let's just make this really small right now 200 by 200 just to see that it that's really let's not let's not okay so you can see how slow this is even just at 200 200 but it is working let's go down to 100 100 yeah so you can see it's just this pixel manipulation stuff is really really slow in the browser so this same exact sketch at 100 byte you know that at that pixel resolution of 640 by 360 now there's a lot of inefficiencies and what I've coded that could be optimized but you can see how kind of chunky the animation is as opposed to and I can barely even tell it to stop as opposed to in oh you know what I'm running a lot of other stuff on the computer that certainly doesn't help but as opposed to in processing where this has no problem to render at a fairly reasonable frame rate so porting this to WebGL using shaders some how to operate the pixels there's a lot of ways that this could be could run really fast and I'm and I suspect if I look for like whirly noise you know WebGL I'm gonna find some really nice demonstration right and this I think is what I was referring to this book this book called the book of shaders here we go we can see here here's that same algorithm running or a similar algorithm running in WebGL with a shader code let's see what happens if I get further down yeah look at that and this by the way is what happens when you move the points around more thoughtfully oh these are just like what how are they moving they're doing like a night a nicer random walk this is the other thing that I really want to do I just want to move them according to some particular algorithm like flocking let's do that let's just add the flocking Gallagher there real quick or should I do the QA well flocking is kind of overly complicated hmm all right it's okay we're gonna make this happen this is worth it whirly noise so let me let me draw these features just so I see them and features the why did I get a negative width negative width divided by 2 width / yeah so this is where those feature points are what if I also move those feature points so I could just go back to the random of motion and that just makes it like jiggle a lot I want it to feel much more smooth so what if I get any of my nature of code examples send them off in a random direction that bounced off the edges of the screen that's probably what I should do let's just do that that's fine let's do a random direction I just need a particle class is the problem so let me let's let's look at what examples I have that'll do this nicely really fast under agents perhaps a flow field stay within walls this is a good one to do arrive path following separation flocking a separation one might be kind of interesting let's look at I mean I could do the wandering one also oh the camera went off again I wonder why battery exhausted Oh like what's the cable loose that's what's going on let's give it a minute see if it charges up again it's charging now I had it I had this camera plugged in but that's why it was going off okay should be fine now ooh there we go all right let's just do so this is I'm gonna leave this as an exercise to people watching this I have so many different kinds of emotions behaviors but I'm gonna go with I'm gonna go with something much simpler and let's just look at an example from chapter one which is like bouncing ball let's just grab this one so I'm going to get this class which just has it's a nice like quick bouncing ball class and I'm just gonna call this a particle and let's just change this to particle and we want to make this a random vector so this gets these each get a random position all right okay hold on a sec hold on everybody's this is what I need right this is these are going to become particles now so this is gonna go in the particle class the velocity is going to be a random velocity what's and then this looks weird okay I don't know what's going on here but this is fine and then we're gonna update the plot bossy it's gonna bounce off the edge we have a display function in case we need it so now the features are particle objects and there are twenty of them there are particles the position gets picked inside and then now the this is a particle or actually its features dot position and so that all that stays the same and now for each of the features what I can do is I can say particle P equals features index I and I can say P dot of display so let's just make sure this works so there we go so these are the particles and now it's doing the noise based on those particles and now if I call update on them they should move and I want them to move much faster than this so let's give them let's increase their velocity to like multiply them each by like five and there we go now it's sort of hard to see what's going oh because let's not draw them looks like it's running much slower yeah so in addition to oh the camera went off again but in addition to the slices they're actually moving let's get rid of the slices for a second let's just override let's not increase the angle let me just give you just the computer for a second I'm gonna get rid of the slices so now you can see this is what it looks like with them moving so anyway you've seen now many more possibilities here let's truncate the the QA is ready we're gonna we're gonna switch we're gonna try the QA so we try to go to just it's charging hopefully it's not charging fast enough so let me see first I'm gonna go into the discord on this computer I've got to do a couple things pots getting dark in here weird sort of way okay so let me open up the discord we're gonna try this Q&A everybody get loopback this court is on so now we should if I go discord this is very exciting this is a very exciting moment here a fear first Q&A with live talking where should I go here should I go to so I guess I can just leave this open because I'm in streamer mode I need to go to the coding train Q&A there's lots of notifications I should go to which channel which channel do I go to bot talk no voice chat Q&A talk so I'm going to join that channel hello done okay so I think your hello Dan just went out through to the live stream everybody can everybody thumbs up in the live stream that you heard a hello Dan I also hear a typing this is my ear and I see you I'm just gonna show you what the way I have this I'm using a piece of software called loopback I'm gonna close it let me open up the this again so this is the software that I'm using and basically I'm taking the audio from discord and it is going into USB capture which is what's going to the live stream but it's also going here into my into my earphones is that a word your phone's I think it is this is and by the way this is coming from the sound boards so if I play this so I'm ready for some Q&A I don't know how how this is gonna be manager if I should be having the discord open I could look at it on I could also look at the discord on my computer over here let's try let's try a couple questions it says Wow Wow there we go I have a suspicion that it might be Simon who joined first yes we hear sigh that's right go ahead Simon sir what is your question I think I think I don't think everybody getting to hear Simon's voice is an exciting moment and if you haven't checked out Simon's channel I think if you just search Simon Tiger on YouTube probably it will come up I can confirm that that's the case by just typing in going to YouTube typing in YouTube Simon Tiger let's see and here we go this you can find Simon's YouTube channel where he has lots of exciting coding videos right here exactly before we go to the next person I see there's a lot of people in the YouTube chat still asking question all right not too sure about how to join so for those people you can join the discord and then in just go to the bottle channel and there'll be a little text in there how to join the Q&A and is the audio balance better now would be a question unfortunate a little bit quiet for me but I lowered it I'm sure I can figure I'm sure I can manage that I can still hear it so it's fine well work that out next time but hopefully the audio balance is better X I can turn this down here hold on I write and then turn this up here Koby can you talk for a minute again let's see how it is yeah all right so that's all right so that's much better in terms of my volume but I'm curious what the levels are for the audience on the live stream yeah we have to wait about 36 no it's low so that's so easier for easy for me to raise it so I'll just raise it up a tiny bit and that should probably be a little bit better now there we go okay I think we might move on to the next verse yeah hello hello Nikki various stuff I want to stand German so I'm sorry for anything oh no you're doing great we're in Germany are you thank that's nice Bob hey I don't know if you know about it I you know I've been to Germany and but I owe I spent most of my time when I was there in Berlin so that's my American knowledge of the geography so what what's your question today um I want to know that you know about to silage rendering because um most triangles in 3ds rendering our Energon to sites so one is invisible or both are visible at the same time processing that could be the problem why you couldn't set the out to zero okay the way you play was my suggestion yeah okay so if I'm here in and if you know you won't be able to see see my screen where I am in because the livestream you're the euros like 30 seconds ahead of the livestream but is that the twosided rendering is there like a setting that I can change in processing that would just you're saying that we just fix this or you're just like the concept of you're talking about the concept of twosided rendering and you're wondering if that's something that's the reason yeah so I think yes I think that is the case I also recall that there is a way there's that it's having this issue before and it could also be related to the order by which I'm drawing things but but you're an idea sounds a bit more sounds right to me because it it was like when I just looked at the other side of it so if I open up the cube right now because it looks very different one side versus the other it's it's dark on this side and brain on this so yeah my I think you're probably right okay I think that's the work because from one pipe it's passing through so you can see on one side but on the other side like a claim cuz you can't be Foucault z alpha is still sick yeah so III I think that's probably right you know to be honest like I do so little 3d stuff but I guess if I search like twosided rendering processing you might get some we might get some I guess well I probably need to type in processing Gord we might find a solution eventually excellent thank you for that suggestion I think you're probably right that that's what it is okay thanks thanks for calling in what remind me your name again my name is neither Nisa yeah awesome this is fun like this is like a coding talk show it probably wouldn't be good for people to join in video in some ways but it's nice to hear people's voice so thanks should we try shall we move on and try another question yeah sure discord moderation magical people Oh bye bye thanks for calling in this is still run I think David's might have slightly broken the ball okay well you know I think I'm gonna have to wrap this up pretty soon anyway this was a bit of a test to sort of see how it might work for to do like a QA you know I kind of wanted to do a some kind of like special thing to celebrate 1 million subscribers you know I have to admit it didn't really happen because I'm just gonna mute this for a second yeah I'm hearing a lot of noise and the check is I should keep this open oops but I don't know with the with the global crisis that we're all finding ourselves in it didn't really feel much spoken billion subscribers but and I've just been sort of focused on other things like getting through the day and doing a little something every day dealing with and helping family and friends out but at least we got I got this live stream out and we got in this sort of test of this voice system what might make more sense is to do this as a separate thing maybe just once a month it could also be something that I do just as with a smaller group as a benefit to people who are patrons or members you know I'm certainly not in the mood to ask people to join right now I know so many people are struggling financially and out of work and you know there's no there's no need for anybody to join pakodi trade right now but this is a nice thing to be able to do are we are we are we set up to maybe try one more person or should I should we wrap it up for today the next person sent me the the question he wanted to ask because it doesn't have a microphone Oh what what coding languages do you know okay who am I talking to right now obligate the voice was soda liner one of the moderators oh okay yeah they're quite what coating last bite are the great yeah so what coding languages do I know I would say that let me try to do this in order of how many learned them so the first programming language I ever did was in elementary school in the 1980s was basic and basic programming language on Apple 2 plus then I didn't program again at all until maybe middle school or high school I think I should learn some assembly language then I didn't program again at all until I was maybe like 22 or 23 and I took like an evening course kind of guessing here in C and I was kind of like not for me then then I went to graduate school at ITP which is the program where I teach now at NYU and there I learned the lingo programming language which is invented by John Henry Thompson if you're not familiar with John Henry Thompson you should be a luminary in the world of creative coding this is John Henry Thompson I'm pretty sure if I search go to videos you'll see he came and was a guest on the coding train at one point but invented the lingo programming language which was the language for Macromedia director so that's what I first that's where I really first was programming because I was doing it intensively in an intro class from there I learned Java I learned C and C++ but so I know all those languages that I have described but I would say probably Java is the one that I spent the most time with and then started working on after I learned Java was working with processing which is built on top of Java and more recently in the last five or six years I've been learning and doing stuff in JavaScript so Java and JavaScript are the ones I probably know the both most and Python I could make my way around if I need to I'm often like calling finding Python scripts and running them who's a part of a project or a thing but it's not my expertise so those would be that's my that's my longwinded summary of all the programming languages I know I think there might be a followup question coming okay well nevermind it's just saw the great thanking you answering the question excellent all right so oh look camera keeps going is it because of the battery must be that it's not then I didn't have it sitting and charging and the battery is just very very low turning it back on so I think maybe I'm gonna wrap up for today I don't know if battery exhausted yeah I don't know if I have an idea here is another camera I have where I am this is the camera that I had on the drawing whoa very close yep for one more question we had one yeah yeah let's have let's have that question come in with my giant head dc6 are you able to speak tt6 it might be broken give me two seconds I will do mine is unmuted him manually so if you can if you want to ask a question go ahead you should build a Speak Now DT six some technical difficulties apparently he is able to speak he's not muted currently so I think it might be a mic issue unfortunately yeah you're welcome to type your question I'm happy to try to answer it but Wow while we're waiting for maybe the question come and read it out okay great well waiting for the question to come in so this was this to me as much as it took me like a half an hour to get a little bit more comfortable and get over my own like anxiety confusion about live streaming from this setup I think that this went pretty well and I'm hoping that I can get back up and running with live streaming once a week I don't think my like recording to disc stuff worked really well so I don't know if the whirly noise example will get end up being edited into its own video that would then have a coding trade page associated with it so if you're not familiar if if I just go to the coding train website all of the coding challenges and the coding the Cabana videos and other tutorials as well if I go to any given page like let's go to one that I know has a bunch like that maybe this raycasting video if I go here to the challenge page you'll see all these community contributions we have a system for you if you make of your own variation of it to collect all these but I don't know that I'll have a whirling noise page but I would love to be able to collect all the whirly projects if people make variations of it and I certainly will upload this code so let's think about how we could share that the discord is certainly a way so maybe we can have a discussion in the discord after the stream is over and you know fake and create a web page just for the worldly noise because I do think the whirling noise code opens up a lot of possible variations and I'm sure a lot of people watching will have clever ideas about how to visualize it even without an animation just to sort of like render a highres version of the image with thinking about color and texture in different ways so I'd love to be able to collect those so if you're watching now and you're not in the discord and you want to discuss that join the discord we'll figure out a way to collect those we could also obviously you can share those with me on social media at Schiffman on twitter at the coating train on twitter there's actually a coding trade Instagram the coding train so let's I would really love to see if you're working on something whirly noise from this also maybe what I can actually do is just kind of redo this but in with the coding in the Cabana setup so I could click sort of refilm the whirly noise just sort of walk through just do it again into the editor together to make it a its own standalone video okay I hear a voice okay six yeah it's background noise for me I'm sorry didja six question is where is the remark encoding Xiamen ah where is the ray marking coding challenge so the I don't I don't think I have a proper ray marching challenge I have this ray casting kind of the same thing but different and I have this rendering ray casting so these would be the ones oh you don't see what I'm looking at Oh my whole setup is kind of broken right now but there's these two challenges that you could take a look at if you're interested in more sort of like proper ray marching I believe that Sebastian lag has a video tutorial about it coding adventure ray marching so if you're not subscribed to Sebastian laggs channel it's really excellent there's lots of really wonderful tutorials and well I don't know the tutorials is the right word but sort of its explanatory video essays in a way about different algorithms which we've done in unity with 3d so but methey that I'm really planning to do soon I was thinking of doing it today is I really am speaking of Sebastian leg lag is a marching squares marching squares is a wonderful algorithm to create I have a video where I made these meta balls pattern also known as meatballs but you can create this kind of animation with the marching squares algorithm as well so I don't that really answered your question but that was a followed by Simon who says you do have a rate marching livestream it just hasn't been editors into a video really apparently lively 177 just can't remember this at all look now there's double me okay you can see this is this camera right ray marching livestream 177 yeah I think this is oh you know what though I think I just caught it's just the title is called ray casting and ray marching because I didn't I think if my memories is correct I think I didn't know what I was doing investigate this are they the same thing are they different and you know to be honest right now I wouldn't be shocked if I got it kind of mixed up but my memory is that the algorithm that I implemented was more specifically related to the term Ray casting and Ray marching is a little bit different so there's maybe there's somebody in the in the discord voice channel who knows precisely the answer this could just pipe in and and and fill in all these gaps but that that's I'm pretty sure that the only thing that I did are those two particular examples ah Milan by the way in the chat rightz what is the best way to teach my nephew programming so I would say first of all the age of your nephew is a major consideration but I would say if your nephew is 12 or 13 and up certainly the this playlist of mine and again I'm not suggesting that my stuff is the best for teaching programming it's just that I happen to know what's there but this particular playlist code programming of p5.js is meant for a total beginner so you know I wouldn't necessarily suggest this for elementary school age although certainly some you know Simon viewer Simon was probably coding this up like in elementary smutch younger age but and really if you if if a an elementary school student is capable of typing then I think following this is possible but certainly middle school and high school and up all the way to any age really this is my beginner playlist for elementary school age you know I would take a look at scratch and I know that scratch has been doing some new initiatives with maybe sort of teaching at home and that type of thing but scratch is a is a block based coding environment I did actually a little weekend livestream last weekend doing some stuff in scratch it was not a proper tutorial but you could take a look at that as well because I did it with my children oh it's right here so you could look at this to our 40minute live stream where we programmed in a couple projects in scratch okay so this I think I think I'm gonna wrap up the I'm gonna I'm gonna mute the audio in my ear if that's all right so thank you Coby and David and Nathan than anybody else in the chat who was helping with this test my intention was to do a kind of like more of a rigorous test with a smaller group but what you know why not just try it here live this live stream is wrapping up I would say one thing that would make me inordinately happy if that's the proper room magic to ever to have use right now what's this over here though topsecret control panel this is my topsecret discord control panel I didn't know I had this mute deafened so many possibilities but would be to see let's let's come up with a hashtag I'm gonna go to let's just go to my camera here I'm gonna go to I just want to see if I'm logged in on Twitter as anything I'm not so I can't post anything but let's let's come up with a hashtag a Twitter hashtag for whirly noise and I realize there's many libraries on Twitter it's not the best way to share this stuff but I'm gonna go out through the evening and weekend and it would make me really happy to see if people make stuff with whirly noise so what's a good what's a good hashtag David suggests all the noise I think we might need something that's related to coding train what if we did like choo choo choo choo noise whirly choo choo really choo choo noise noise choo sounds like noisy foo I don't know coding whirly noise that's that's pretty good whirly train whirly train is good let's do this whirly train Twitter comm hashtag and I'm a little bit of I'm afraid of the internet so I'm gonna just go back to my camera here and look at whirly train no results you could be the first you could be the very first to have a whirly train hashtag let's see if I can manage to to post something noisy little whirly tricky whirly bugs let's go let's see if I can manage the law to my Twitter here what's the chance I can do that it's gonna take me a million years through all my different protections so hard for me to log into anything because I have password manager I've got to factor I can barely get into my Twitter I'm gonna post my video don't see how it looks just give me a second maybe you will post something before me we'll see I'm gonna look at my password here which is some crazy sequence of characters for six well you know there's a 46 in my password good luck now deciphering it shift I didn't even type it incorrectly you know what actually be good is to always have the voice channel open you discard and for like in emergencies people could look like so yeah your mic went off or something like that really pickle that's pretty good okay wait I need an authentication code did I get it yes we have any better hashtag suggestions let's post okay here we go whirly train that we're going with people where Lee train Worley pickle is pretty good whirly train pickle really needs to go out for a walk well hi Stan everybody's behind whirly train we're early train whirly train and I'm gonna get my video I'm sure compression will kill it let's look at the let's see if all right I am now about to tweet and go back to this whirly train thanks for watching the livestream today everyone trouble writing my tweet somebody help me here stay home be well friends take care of yourself and each other let's give ourselves some nice mo jeez so our pickle emoji that's gonna be misinterpreted ah dog let's see there we go rainbow some stars think I'm I think I'm I think that's enough I think I did my duty all right how's this look everybody uh whirly train share share yours whirly train okay I think this is good I am going to post this tweet and say goodbye to all of you I will let you enjoy some time with pickle on my way out let's see if I can oops oops there's there's pickle and see you soon goodbye everybody thank you so much for tuning in thanks for bearing with me as I try to get used to this setup and figure out what it is that I'm doing and how I'm how I'm continuing the work that I do and also being mindful and conscientious of all the struggles and difficulties everybody's having and bring something good and useful and appropriate and say all the right things and be nice and everything that I want to be which is just to be a kind helpful person and so your feedback is welcome and I look forward to seeing you on the next live stream I wish I could just do this every day but I have a lot to take care of at home but I'll do my best and please your messages and thoughts and sharing your own visual ideas are always wonderful and I really appreciate it I'm gonna play you out with some of my ridiculous music like the this.stop song by the way if the discord voice Channel is still going through I should turn that off okay discord voice channels off now you can talk to I can hear you this this this this start song never forget to this start with somebody composed that song for me how long is this so this is random this is noise Perley noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine to one thirty I think nine why apparently but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five my microphone is still on my microphone now this is like Perlin noise performance part birthing noise but with purely noise I might pick numbers like this three four five by purling noise that is early noise this is Hurley noise that is Hurley noises this is Hurley noise that in Berlin oh so this is Hurley noise that is her pearling no Hurley noise
