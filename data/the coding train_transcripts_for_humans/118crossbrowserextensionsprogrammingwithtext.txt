00:00 - hello I'm very excited to do this video
00:03 - for you it's a little bit scary because
00:05 - I'm going to attempt to do something
00:07 - this video that I have no idea how to do
00:09 - and I've never looked at it before but I
00:12 - did receive this tweet from Nicholas who
00:16 - writes hey Daniel could you say browser
00:18 - or web extension most of the major
00:20 - browsers have the same set of api's so
00:23 - making a cross browser extension is
00:25 - easily doable see this link so it is
00:29 - true that this idea of an a brat a
00:34 - Chrome extension is not something
00:37 - limited to the Chrome browser and I've
00:39 - been saying Chrome extension all this
00:40 - time because it's what I was familiar
00:42 - what I'm familiar with and what I've
00:44 - used before but this idea of an
00:46 - extension is can be thought of in a
00:50 - larger broader way as a browser
00:52 - extension there is a uniform standard
00:58 - API from the Mozilla Foundation we can
01:02 - look at it here for a browser extensions
01:04 - so could I possibly in this video take
01:08 - one of my extensions I made like the
01:10 - kitten one and just make it work in
01:13 - Firefox as a browser extension this is
01:16 - what I'm going to attempt to do well
01:19 - your first extension let's look at that
01:20 - I think I could skip what are extensions
01:22 - oh oh so I need a manifest.json hey look
01:25 - at this it looks like I've done this
01:28 - already so actually I have a feeling I
01:31 - don't know if the chicken or the egg
01:33 - came first but I do know that I like I
01:36 - like a vegetarian omelet it's quite
01:39 - delicious now I can't be vegan obviously
01:43 - because eggs aren't but anyway I just I
01:45 - like vegetables
01:46 - that's am I really talking about that
01:47 - now no but this looks like so much so
01:49 - let me just go get my let's what is it
01:52 - possible that I could just run by
01:54 - extension in Firefox I don't actually
01:56 - recode it at all so let's go to all
01:58 - these these are all the extensions that
02:00 - I made with the exception of the first
02:02 - reserve bookmark content script
02:03 - background script two kittens one the
02:05 - sketch one the pop ups let's try the
02:07 - kittens one i'm let's try the kids one
02:11 - so i'm gonna just make
02:13 - get a new folder whoops I'm gonna copy
02:16 - it and I'm gonna call it 0:08 browser
02:22 - kittens just I want to in case I have to
02:24 - change some aspects of it let's leave
02:26 - that so it's just a Content script with
02:30 - a kittens a folder of kittens and a
02:33 - manifesto JSON alright so let's see here
02:37 - how do I load an extension open firefox
02:41 - enter about debugging in the URL bar
02:44 - click load temporary add-on so that
02:47 - seems like what I have to do about
02:49 - debugging ah there we go
02:52 - enable add-on debugging sure load
02:56 - temporary add on extensions browser
02:58 - kittens open open no no do I just select
03:02 - a manifesto JSON file alright it's there
03:05 - the oh it says Chrome that's the worst
03:08 - so let me at least fix that let me go to
03:11 - the manifesto JSON and say browser this
03:16 - is now a browser X kitchen and if you
03:19 - want to watch the video where I
03:20 - programmed this extension I'll link to
03:23 - it in this video's description so now
03:27 - let me reload and then it should be
03:30 - running how about just go to Schiffman
03:36 - net oh it worked good look kittens
03:43 - kittens everywhere
03:44 - kittens it worked so what's nice to see
03:51 - here and actually it's nice to that that
03:55 - this is an open standard that this idea
03:57 - of an extension you can look at the
04:00 - chrome specific API the documentation
04:03 - and make Chrome extensions but your code
04:06 - for the most part without and perhaps
04:08 - some minor changes I'm sure I mean this
04:09 - is a very simplistic extension but so
04:13 - there might be other things but you can
04:14 - look at this Mozilla documentation page
04:18 - to create cross browser extensions cross
04:23 - browser kittens for all so I hope you
04:26 - enjoyed them
04:27 - has now become a very short video I
04:29 - would be happy to load my other
04:30 - extensions and see how that works let's
04:32 - just at least load one that has a button
04:33 - let's so now I'm gonna be ambitious and
04:36 - I'm just going to say load I'm gonna
04:40 - load one that I made for looking up
04:43 - words and getting their definitions from
04:45 - word next I'm gonna open up this one and
04:48 - I guess I have to within Chrome I select
04:51 - the folder looks like I select the
04:53 - manifest.json file so word look up now
04:56 - you can see look my button is there and
04:58 - I can go to let's go to a Wikipedia page
05:03 - for like rainbow and they're still
05:08 - replacing things with cats
05:10 - look I don't have a kitten here and I'm
05:13 - gonna select sky click here and look at
05:16 - that the expanse of air over any given
05:19 - point on the earth the upper atmosphere
05:21 - as seen from the earth service so I'm
05:23 - really disappointed
05:24 - I was a disappointed with myself but
05:26 - that's probably not the right thing to
05:29 - say right here but I I pray that I had
05:32 - sort of started with this knowledge and
05:33 - from this point of view because as much
05:35 - as possible I like to use generic and
05:38 - open tools that can be applied to a lot
05:40 - of different things like different
05:44 - browsers or different operating systems
05:46 - but so but hopefully this is this video
05:49 - allows you to see if you want to do one
05:51 - of your extensions for a different
05:53 - browser you can all you can do that so
05:55 - thank you all for watching and I will
05:57 - see you in another time in another video
05:59 - maybe maybe if if you want you could uh
06:01 - yeah ok no no that's fine don't don't
06:03 - just just go on with your day
06:09 - [Music]
