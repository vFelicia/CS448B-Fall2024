With timestamps:

00:00 - I have some uh
00:03 - rainbow sweatbands the problem is
00:05 - there's Green in this so I think you're
00:07 - seeing this like invisible stripe with
00:09 - the computer behind me but if I switch
00:13 - to over here you can see what this
00:15 - actually looks
00:16 - like oh the light's not on over here
00:18 - okay I don't think I can I don't know if
00:20 - I can manage to get myself to actually
00:21 - wear this uh welcome good morning this
00:24 - is coding rainbow my name is Dan uh it
00:28 - is uh Tuesday August 2nd welcome to
00:32 - August I am live from the school for
00:33 - poetic computation in New York City I'm
00:36 - going to be here for approximately 1
00:39 - hour and a half I got about a 20 minute
00:42 - late start here so the time is going to
00:44 - be a little bit short today but I will
00:45 - be also be back on Thursday so this week
00:47 - the live streams will be today and this
00:49 - coming
00:50 - Thursday I have a
00:52 - bell just getting new things for this uh
00:56 - thing called cating rainbow I have some
00:58 - stickers and I know if you can see these
01:01 - can you see these where's my like hey
01:03 - camera 4 oh there is no camera 4 where's
01:05 - the director there's nobody else here
01:07 - but me who can like do a tight shot of
01:09 - these stickers uh I can talk about where
01:11 - you can get these stickers if you want
01:13 - in a little bit um I want to kind of get
01:15 - started uh today as quickly as possible
01:18 - with a coding Challenge and uh the
01:20 - coding challenge that has been requested
01:22 - uh and Thumbs Up by a bunch of people is
01:27 - um is uh uh Flappy Bird so I am going to
01:32 - uh something that surprised me that's
01:34 - actually become a little popular one my
01:36 - most watched video on YouTube is a
01:39 - coding challenge where I programmed from
01:41 - scratch the snake game good oldfashioned
01:44 - snake game uh in JavaScript so I think
01:48 - I'm going to do a Flappy Bird game today
01:50 - and actually I have a ulterior motive
01:52 - for doing Flappy Bird today which is
01:54 - that I am leading towards eventually
01:56 - it's taking me a lot longer to get to
01:58 - this um some machine machine learning
02:00 - videos and what I want to do is have a
02:02 - machine Learning System that analyzes
02:05 - the current pixels it just sort of looks
02:07 - uh almost as if like a camera pointed at
02:09 - the screen uh and then knows when to
02:11 - press the space bar to make the bird
02:13 - kind of go up versus go down so uh if we
02:15 - have this example of a kind of a a
02:18 - simple interaction a one button game of
02:19 - playing Flappy Bird we can look at a
02:21 - machine learning algorithm to play it
02:23 - automatically and uh again you know the
02:26 - point of this channel is not that you
02:28 - will then go and have your own machine
02:30 - learning algorithm playing Flappy Bird
02:31 - but you will take some of these Concepts
02:33 - and realize them in new creative and
02:35 - exciting beautiful ways
02:37 - um so uh let me see what else just I can
02:40 - briefly tell you if you are new um if
02:43 - you would uh so the if you're looking
02:46 - for more of this stuff uh you can go to
02:48 - everything that you need H everything
02:51 - that you might need related to this
02:53 - coding rainbow channel is here at coding
02:55 - rainbow.com uh you I encourage you to uh
02:59 - press sub
03:00 - subscribe uh you can you're also welcome
03:03 - to uh participate in a coding rainbow
03:06 - slack channel uh by becoming a patron on
03:08 - a crowdfunding site called patreon and
03:10 - if you would like to find out when I do
03:12 - these live streams I send out email
03:14 - announcements and you can also scroll
03:16 - down and put your email in here okay
03:18 - that's all I'm going to say intro wise
03:19 - today uh and I'm just going to kind of
03:21 - get started already so there's a chat
03:23 - going I assume everybody can kind of see
03:25 - and hear me okay in the chat you can see
03:27 - I don't know if you can see my new
03:28 - stickers here there's green on the
03:29 - stickers so I don't know if it shows
03:32 - through uh and we're just going to kind
03:34 - of get started here let's go to with the
03:37 - one thing I wanted to show you which is
03:39 - there is also a uh GitHub
03:44 - repository
03:48 - uh oh yeah uses my hand to see if it SE
03:52 - through yes that actually won't work I I
03:54 - recognized that Oliver how absurd that
03:56 - was that I just did that um okay uh
03:59 - there is also this GitHub repository
04:01 - coding rainbowrainbow topics this is
04:04 - where you can suggest a topic it's kind
04:06 - of like exploding I I make a lot of
04:09 - videos each week and I'm kind of
04:10 - churning stuff out at the same time I
04:12 - cannot possibly keep up with this list
04:14 - um but it is uh here and you can see
04:17 - four minutes ago Cube Helix visualizer
04:20 - what is
04:22 - that whoa I made a cube Helix visualizer
04:26 - based on this it'll be interesting how
04:28 - you would tackle it perhaps with actual
04:30 - 3D instead of fake 3D a little bit
04:32 - afraid to click on this let's click on
04:34 - this this is from joerger if I pronounce
04:37 - that correctly whoa that is quite nice
04:40 - uh and there looks like there's some
04:41 - sliders here oo this is quite nice uh
04:45 - anyway you guys can find this on your
04:47 - own and look at it more later I would
04:48 - love to take this on as a challenge uh
04:50 - something I also do often is I go here
04:52 - to sort and I sort by a thumbs up and
04:55 - you can see what's kind of uh rising to
04:58 - the top here machine learning uh which
05:00 - I'm trying to get to computer vision
05:02 - I've done a bunch of genetic algorithms
05:03 - I actually finished all the genetic
05:05 - algorithms videos although I still want
05:07 - to do um traveling salesperson problem
05:10 - with a genetic algorithm so I will get
05:12 - to that
05:14 - um and all of that stuff so um let me
05:17 - mention actually because something
05:20 - that's I think happened is that most of
05:22 - the people who most of you the viewers
05:25 - who have found this channel already know
05:26 - something about programming uh most of
05:29 - you who are supporting and participating
05:31 - in this GitHub uh reposit who supporting
05:34 - on patreon or subscribed or contributing
05:36 - this GitHub repository already know
05:38 - about programming but it has come up I
05:41 - one of the reasons for this channel is
05:43 - not to do Advanced tutorials about
05:44 - programming my goal is to have a wide
05:47 - range of tutorials from complete and
05:49 - total beginner to medium to intermediate
05:53 - to more intermediate but I want
05:55 - everything to be friendly and accessible
05:57 - but obviously different tutorials that I
05:58 - make you kind of kind of have uh you've
06:00 - got to come with some knowledge or with
06:02 - no knowledge so I just want to point out
06:04 - for you guys to help share with the
06:06 - world that and I think I could do a
06:08 - probably a better job of organizing this
06:10 - but if I go to my channel here uh I want
06:14 - you to uh right now I guess I'm live
06:16 - right now does it say that I'm live I
06:17 - could watch myself live um that if uh uh
06:22 - right here this right here these
06:25 - playlists playlist 1 through six
06:28 - foundations of programming in JavaScript
06:30 - these this playlist is for complete and
06:33 - total beginners you don't have to know
06:34 - anything whatsoever so that is someplace
06:37 - you could get started and then find your
06:39 - way to some of these more intermediate
06:41 - topics that I'm doing and then there
06:43 - also if I scroll down here these
06:45 - tutorials now these are quite old I made
06:47 - these uh probably four or five years ago
06:50 - but the learning processing are also
06:52 - beginner tutorials the difference is
06:54 - learning processing uses a programming
06:55 - environment called processing and the
06:57 - the um the other one one through six
07:01 - foundations of programming in JavaScript
07:02 - uses something called p5js you know we
07:05 - could be here forever talking about why
07:08 - you might pick one or the other I
07:09 - suppose this might make a little more
07:11 - sense in that I made them more recently
07:13 - but um you can kind of choose and and
07:15 - and that sort of thing so
07:17 - um uh the wgb Bros uh mentions in the
07:23 - chat um uh JS is client side maybe you
07:27 - want to do some things server side it's
07:29 - funny you should mention that I am
07:30 - planning this fall to do more uh node.js
07:34 - server side programming tutorials I have
07:35 - done some already the two playlists that
07:38 - I have about servers side programming
07:39 - one is for making Twitter boot using
07:41 - node and another is a tutorial for
07:43 - making a shared drawing canvas using
07:45 - something called websockets both of
07:47 - those require service side programming
07:48 - and both of those tutorial playlists you
07:50 - can find them uh kind of give you some
07:52 - beginner uh getting started information
07:55 - about node however this fall something I
07:57 - will mention that I'm planning to do
08:00 - uh uh shiftman GitHub ah I teach a
08:03 - course at ITP uh which is a a master's
08:06 - program at New York University called
08:07 - programming from A to Z you can see this
08:09 - is the website for last year there will
08:11 - be a new one for 2016 and this uh this
08:15 - course is all about programming with
08:18 - text based data in JavaScript making
08:20 - poetry machines reading massive like
08:24 - tones of text and like generating new
08:26 - text out of them using Markov chains and
08:28 - grammars and hoping to actually insert
08:30 - some machine learning into this course
08:32 - but one of the things that I'm going to
08:33 - do this fall is do more server side
08:35 - programming with this because there's a
08:37 - lot of uh good and interesting uh text
08:40 - analysis node packages you know
08:43 - typically a lot of this material you
08:44 - might find um in Python libraries but as
08:47 - I'm kind of doing stuff for the web and
08:48 - the browser side I'm using JavaScript so
08:50 - this is coming this fall all the videos
08:52 - for this course will be free in online
08:54 - but if you want to participate in a uh
08:56 - an online channel to discuss assignments
08:58 - and Share work um that's my slack
09:01 - messaging me right now I'm going to turn
09:02 - the sound off here uh you can uh uh
09:05 - support um you can sign up for the uh
09:08 - crowdfunding patreon okay so uh that's
09:11 - what I want to say I've got my
09:12 - soundboard
09:13 - working with some
09:16 - music in case it gets too hot in here I
09:19 - have a
09:19 - sweatband sweat a
09:21 - headband we're going to do a coding
09:24 - challenge I got to put put these on get
09:27 - ready for the coding challenge I have a
09:29 - watch on will this go over my
09:32 - watch I think I'm going to do this in
09:35 - JavaScript but oh no wrong sound
09:38 - effect very important when programming
09:40 - JavaScript not to forget
09:45 - the
09:46 - okay uh uh cannot post links some of you
09:50 - in the chat can post links
09:53 - [Music]
09:54 - um uh okay so here we go the problem is
09:58 - the green
09:59 - right is a little bit weird that I have
10:01 - this like slice invisible slice in the
10:02 - middle of my head okay um now let's get
10:07 - started because we don't have a lot of
10:09 - time I only have a little over an hour
10:13 - left
10:15 - and I want to get started here okay so
10:20 - flappy birds let's look up some
10:22 - information here let's get going
10:27 - here Flappy Bird
10:30 - Bird play Flappy Bird let's look at that
10:33 - let's look at Flappy Bird on Wikipedia
10:36 - okay so flappy bird you may or may not
10:40 - be familiar with Flappy Bird let's take
10:42 - a look will this actually let me play it
10:43 - oh look at that it kind of goes up and
10:44 - down oops look at this like ridiculous
10:47 - like advertising now okay it's GNA make
10:50 - me watch a message from the sponsor um
10:52 - Flappy Bird is a really simple
10:55 - game uh it was quite
10:57 - popular um
10:59 - and uh it was built in 2013 By
11:02 - Vietnamese artist and programmer dong
11:04 - win did I pronounce that correctly any
11:06 - of you who know uh I I I sort of had
11:09 - this memory of it being released and
11:11 - then it was like so popular and it was
11:12 - taken down now everyone's making Flappy
11:14 - Bird clones um I I think as an
11:17 - interesting exercise here I'm going to
11:19 - try to program this game from scratch I
11:21 - kind of wanted to just play it for a
11:22 - second let's go to
11:24 - continue boy this was a terrible this is
11:27 - this website is no good at all it's just
11:29 - only advertisements can I click on
11:33 - this this is like
11:35 - ridiculous uh uh let's look let's look
11:39 - let's let's look for uh Flappy Bird
11:43 - um JavaScript whatever I'm just G to
11:46 - make it I think I have a sense of it is
11:47 - there like a little animation I know
11:49 - what we can do uh Flappy bird YouTube
11:52 - let's watch a little video of
11:54 - it
11:56 - uh uh okay here we go so let's
12:00 - let's forget this advertisement for a
12:06 - second come on can I not skip this ad
12:08 - this going to make me watch a full 30
12:10 - second ad here what's wrong with this
12:13 - YouTube ad
12:16 - stuff okay I just wanted to get a visual
12:20 - reference of the game play to help me as
12:22 - I start to program it I I don't know
12:24 - that I've ever actually played Flappy
12:25 - Bird I'm culturally aware of it and I've
12:28 - definitely seen it
12:29 - uh okay here we go let's
12:31 - see there we go okay so you can see the
12:34 - idea here there's a
12:36 - bird it
12:38 - falls
12:40 - um the the bird flies every time you tap
12:44 - a force push pushes that bird up and the
12:46 - idea is you want to get it through these
12:47 - like pipe things oh this is so this is
12:49 - like isn't it sort of beautiful I think
12:51 - these one button games are so beautiful
12:53 - the sort of like addictive like crazy
12:56 - quality to it I can see myself having a
12:58 - serious problem with this game okay so
13:01 - um let's get ourselves going here I'm
13:04 - going to open up Adam is the my sort of
13:06 - preferred text editor of the day oh
13:08 - somebody mentioned to me on
13:12 - Twitter like a an Adam package with live
13:17 - reload and a web
13:20 - server does anybody
13:23 - um does anybody I forget it I'm going to
13:27 - do it my own old fat somebody in the
13:28 - chat I don't want to waste time here
13:30 - let's open up
13:31 - terminal uh uh
13:34 - desktop give you guys some music here so
13:36 - this is random this is noise pearly
13:39 - noise that is in the core random
13:41 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
13:43 - itself those numbers aren't related at
13:46 - all you pick like I'm picking random
13:48 - numbers between 0 and 10 9 2 7 6 1 9 4 8
13:54 - 9 tax I did recently apparently but with
13:57 - pearing noise I might pick numbers like
13:59 - this 2 three 4 3 four five 6 5
14:04 - 4 7 5 six 7 five 6 S 8 N9 876 look this
14:10 - is like pearlin noise performance
14:13 - heart
14:16 - 2 4 2
14:20 - 1 2 4 3 four 5 6 let's make a like PE
14:26 - noise perform birs file and a pipe. JS
14:32 - file but with curly noise I might pick
14:35 - numbers like
14:37 - this I'm just getting set up I'm not
14:40 - going to I'm going to all the I'm going
14:41 - to write all the code live in the
14:48 - tutorial this is that
14:51 - is that is noise so this ising noise
14:54 - that is noise no that is so this ising
14:57 - noise that is
15:00 - what is this craziness what is this
15:05 - craziness idea what this is some strange
15:08 - new notification on
15:13 - like but with pearing noise I might pick
15:16 - numbers like
15:17 - [Music]
15:18 - this oh something's going on with the
15:21 - beauy I hope my Adam isn't
15:26 - broken 4 four five
15:31 - six how do I get pear noise performance
15:35 - art is there a okay hold on let me at
15:36 - least see if this is
15:42 - working is the um is the uh oh sorry
15:48 - everybody is the background noise uh too
15:51 - loud compared to my
15:52 - voice I will I will fix that if that's
15:55 - the
15:57 - case
16:00 - that was a package error it's a bug I
16:02 - know I I don't mind ignoring it oh the
16:04 - file could be
16:07 - readon I
16:09 - don't uh let's go to
16:16 - here
16:25 - uh yeah close oh camera went off H I
16:30 - might switch to using Sublime if this is
16:33 - going
16:35 - to if this is going to cause me a
16:39 - problem
16:42 - uh I'll have to look into this later let
16:45 - me just try restarting
16:52 - Adam
16:54 - no all right
16:57 - um
17:00 - uh make sure yeah everything seems fine
17:03 - I'm just going to use
17:05 - Sublime to not worry about
17:08 - this very happy with Sublime Text as
17:13 - well I don't have my I don't have
17:15 - beautify and Sublime that's going to
17:17 - drive me
17:22 - crazy oh this is very
17:24 - sad how do I what's the uh what's the um
17:28 - key key
17:32 - code uh show the trace okay let's not
17:36 - let's not worry about is is this
17:38 - distracting that my head looks like it's
17:39 - going to fall
17:40 - off maybe that's a little bit better is
17:43 - that
17:46 - better
17:50 - okay all right
17:56 - everybody welcome to today's coding
18:01 - challenge we are going to recreate
18:05 - Flappy Bird in JavaScript in what I hope
18:09 - won't take very
18:11 - long I sort of feel
18:15 - like how long could it possibly
18:20 - take okay waits for supp okay let's see
18:24 - how's how we going here we've got 43
18:26 - people watching thank you all for being
18:28 - here and here we
18:36 - go 45 F Looper okay everybody what's the
18:39 - over under on how long this is going to
18:41 - take
18:42 - me I'm guessing 20
18:45 - minutes it's going to be longer it's
18:46 - probably GNA be 30
18:48 - minutes yeah everybody place your bets
18:53 - now is that Bell a very harsh sound
18:56 - let's see no doesn't seem so bad I have
18:59 - a
19:00 - bell three days 25 minutes uh 30 minutes
19:05 - okay here we go everybody uh we're going
19:07 - to start
19:08 - here uh
19:12 - and I put a coding rainbow sticker
19:18 - on is this a waste of a sticker these
19:21 - stickers are kind of
19:23 - expensive 42 one guy made it in
19:26 - processing with 50 to 75 lines so arson
19:29 - arson says in the chat one guy made it
19:31 - in processing with 50 to 75 lines I'm
19:34 - not trying to do this with as little as
19:36 - few lines of code as possible in fact
19:38 - I'm probably going to overdo it there
19:43 - okay here we
19:45 - go let me uh cycle the camera I don't
19:48 - think I need the
19:50 - uh whiteboard I don't think I'm going to
19:52 - use the Whiteboard for
19:54 - this but just in
19:56 - case um
19:58 - nah forget it
20:05 - okay yeah uh okay you guys are all
20:09 - making excellent comments in the chat
20:10 - here we
20:11 - go I'm actually GNA put on a timer here
20:14 - oh Adam live server that's what it
20:20 - is
20:23 - uh uh okay uh hold on I'm looking at my
20:27 - phone
20:29 - this is the worst this is my worst live
20:31 - stream ever but I was getting some
20:32 - important messages and what I wanted to
20:34 - do is put on a
20:36 - stopwatch I have a timer thing that I
20:38 - put on the screen but I don't have time
20:39 - to do that okay stopwatch
20:42 - going hello and welcome to a new cing
20:46 - cing
20:48 - coding let's try this
20:53 - [Music]
20:56 - again hello and welcome to a coding
20:59 - rainbow coding challenge today's coding
21:03 - challenge I'm going to attempt to make
21:06 - uh a Flappy Bird clone which I admit is
21:09 - kind of like a bit of a cliche probably
21:11 - at this point I don't know how many
21:12 - people have made Flappy Bird clone
21:14 - tutorial whatevers on in the world but
21:17 - it was requested I think it'll be fun
21:19 - I'm going to give it a try I'm going to
21:20 - do it in JavaScript I'm going to try to
21:21 - do it fast but with time to explain and
21:24 - time to relax and and just enjoy myself
21:27 - and Hope hope you might enjoy watching
21:29 - this so um if you're not familiar with
21:31 - Flappy Bird then I would say pause this
21:33 - video go and familiarize yourself with
21:35 - it I actually don't think I've ever
21:37 - actually played it before but I am
21:38 - somewhat familiar with the gameplay
21:39 - we'll see how well I do I've got a live
21:41 - chat going on and you guys can uh tell
21:44 - me how I'm doing if you're watching this
21:46 - as a YouTube archive you won't be able
21:47 - to follow along live but that's fine
21:49 - okay so I'm using p5js which is a
21:50 - JavaScript framework has a function
21:52 - setup it has a function draw and so the
21:54 - only thing I've got so far in the
21:56 - browser is just a canvas that's 400 by
21:58 - 600 pixels and a black background on
22:01 - that canvas so the first thing that I
22:02 - want to do I actually have a a separate
22:04 - Javascript file called bird. JS and I'm
22:07 - actually going to make this a uh
22:09 - Constructor function and the bird all
22:12 - all the bird really needs is a y value
22:14 - right the bird moves up and down and it
22:16 - stays in one spot so I'm going to give
22:18 - this uh bird I'm going to start the bird
22:20 - off in the center of the window and I'm
22:23 - going to write also a function called
22:25 - show uh where I draw the bird and again
22:28 - I'm going to my design is going to be
22:30 - very poor so it's going to be up to you
22:33 - to take my code which will be linked in
22:35 - this description to make something more
22:36 - beautiful and interesting and riff off
22:38 - of this so I'm just going to say uh
22:40 - let's make a white circle and you know
22:42 - what let's give this bird an X position
22:44 - as well even though it will be fixed but
22:46 - let's just try uh 25 for right now and
22:50 - I'm going to uh never forget that
22:53 - this you always need this dot in
22:56 - JavaScript um
22:59 - so let's make this bird a circle and
23:02 - let's say in the main program now VAR
23:06 - bird and we're going to say bird equals
23:09 - new
23:11 - bird and bird. show so we should have
23:15 - something a little bit more interesting
23:16 - now ah there it is bird with divided by
23:19 - two you know it would probably make more
23:20 - sense if I want the bird to be in the
23:22 - middle to be height divided by two so
23:24 - let's fix that I'm going to say height
23:27 - divided by two I think the bird could be
23:29 - a little bit bigger and the bird could
23:31 - be a little bit more in on the screen so
23:33 - there we go this is the beginning of
23:34 - Flappy Bird now what happens to the bird
23:38 - without you doing anything the bird
23:40 - falls down so oops oops wrong window so
23:43 - I'm going to go here and I'm going to
23:44 - say this.
23:46 - update equals function and it would be
23:49 - good to have some sort of variable
23:50 - called
23:51 - gravity and gravity being the force
23:54 - that's pushing uh that bird down and
23:57 - let's say that that the gravity here is
23:58 - going to be one I also need a velocity
24:01 - right I need a velocity so gravity is
24:02 - the force that's causing the velocity of
24:04 - the bird to increase so I'm going to say
24:06 - this do velocity equals
24:09 - zero and now I'm going to say
24:12 - this.y changes by this do
24:15 - velocity and this do
24:20 - velocity changes by this dot gravity
24:23 - okay so now we have a function that's
24:25 - going to push that bird down so I'm
24:27 - going to go over here and I'm going to
24:28 - say uh also bird.
24:31 - update there we go bye bird it flew down
24:35 - now we should probably do something
24:37 - where the bird stops when it gets to the
24:38 - bottom of the window that makes sense so
24:41 - I'm going to go back to the bird and I'm
24:43 - going to say I'll just do this in the
24:44 - update function I could write a separate
24:45 - and I'm going to say if this doy is
24:48 - greater than height then um then I'm
24:52 - just going to uh keep the bird on the
24:54 - screen I'm going to say this.y equals
24:56 - height and I'm also going to uh set that
24:59 - velocity to zero so we can see here that
25:03 - bird stops I don't know if that's
25:05 - actually what happens in Flappy Bird but
25:06 - I just kind of want to do that anyway
25:08 - and you know what I'm going to do that
25:09 - also for the top of the window because
25:11 - ultimately I'm going to be able to push
25:13 - the bird
25:15 - up so let's do that for Less Than Zero
25:19 - uh now of course so okay so
25:21 - now what how does the game work I think
25:24 - it's a mobile game right you could tap
25:26 - your mobile device this is my mobile
25:27 - device so I'm going to as a tap I'm
25:29 - going to just use the space bar on my
25:32 - keyboard so in um p5js I can write a
25:35 - function called key
25:37 - pressed and I can check to see if the
25:39 - key is the space bar um and let me just
25:42 - make sure this is
25:43 - working uh I'm just going to console log
25:45 - something right now so I'm going to run
25:47 - this and you can see each time I press
25:49 - the space bar uh it says here in the
25:52 - console uh it prints out space so that
25:54 - works so what do I want to do I want to
25:56 - cause a force to cause that bird to go
25:59 - up so I'm going to say bird. up and so
26:03 - what's going to happen with this bird do
26:05 - up
26:06 - function
26:10 - uh what do I want to do I want instead
26:13 - of the Velocity being pushed down by
26:16 - gravity I want to say this do velocity
26:19 - minus equals I want it to go up or I
26:21 - could say plus equals but some minus
26:23 - amount now what if I just said minus
26:25 - this do gravity let's try that for a
26:28 - second just to see what
26:30 - happens come on wait oh you know what's
26:33 - a little bit annoying I have to oh I
26:36 - took off that console.log hold on let's
26:37 - say minus equals this.g gravity time
26:40 - 10 so nothing's working here and I have
26:43 - a kind of a a sneaking
26:46 - suspicion that I've done something
26:48 - totally wrong a bird dot up let's make
26:51 - sure this is
26:53 - happening
26:55 - uh uh I'm going to say print line uh
27:00 - this.
27:04 - velocity okay so you can see that's
27:06 - working so let's try to tune I think
27:09 - there's sort of an issue here we've got
27:10 - to sort of tune the numbers so let's
27:13 - make the gravity just for right now a
27:15 - lot less strong so it's not going so
27:17 - fast now you can see though that this
27:20 - isn't really um doing very much let's
27:24 - make a uh this do up Force let's call
27:27 - this
27:30 - lift uh and we'll say it's -10 so I'm
27:34 - going to say this stop velocity plus
27:36 - equal this. lift not left
27:39 - lift there we go so you can see there's
27:43 - there's sort of an element of tuning
27:45 - those numbers so now it doesn't really
27:46 - feel like it's falling fast enough but
27:48 - me pushing the space bar is kind of
27:51 - working now does it what happens if I
27:53 - hold down the space bar so that's good
27:54 - okay so that lift is too much let's make
27:56 - the gravity point six and let's keep the
27:58 - lift
28:01 - there but now I'm going to need to make
28:03 - the lift A Little Bit
28:04 - Stronger there we go so this so now I
28:09 - have I sort of have the game going the
28:10 - lift is a little bit too strong uh let's
28:13 - make it less
28:19 - strong so there's you know some things
28:22 - something that I could do is actually
28:23 - limit the top speed or also or also like
28:28 - give it some um something that I could
28:29 - also do is is add some like air
28:31 - resistance in general which I could say
28:33 - something like this do velocity times
28:36 - equal
28:39 - 0.9 so that actually like helps with
28:42 - things quite a bit because it's just
28:44 - there's some there's sort of like a
28:45 - limit to what the speed is so now I've
28:47 - got something that is a bit more kind of
28:49 - like reasonable to play here so you
28:52 - could spend your time tuning this even
28:53 - more but I think just like keeping the
28:56 - velocity keeping some like are
28:57 - resistance by always shrinking the
28:58 - velocity a little bit uh tuning how much
29:01 - the lift is versus the gravity those
29:03 - types of things you can kind of play
29:04 - around with okay so now we have the
29:06 - basic game mechanic here which is just a
29:08 - falling Circle and each time I press the
29:10 - space bar I can kind of like have it
29:12 - lift up a little bit now what do we need
29:14 - to add we need to add those pipe things
29:17 - that kind of come from the right of the
29:20 - screen I'm only at eight minutes by the
29:22 - way which is pretty good the pipes
29:24 - things that come from the right of the
29:25 - screen and you have to steer your way
29:26 - through let's see if we can do this so
29:29 - um let's think about this I'm going to
29:31 - also create a pipe object with a
29:32 - Constructor function and let's think
29:34 - about what is a pipe need so a pipe
29:37 - needs I would say it's going to extend
29:39 - from the top to somewhere in the middle
29:41 - of the screen and then somewhere further
29:43 - down to the bottom so I need um I'm
29:45 - going to say like a a value called top
29:48 - which is going to be some random amount
29:50 - between the top of the screen and the
29:52 - middle of the screen and let's say this
29:54 - do bottom is some random amount also
29:56 - between the middle of the screen and the
29:58 - bottom of the
29:59 - screen and the the pipe also needs an X
30:02 - position which is always going to start
30:04 - at the edge of the
30:07 - screen and then let's let's write a
30:10 - function called show where I draw the
30:13 - pipe as uh White fill white and I draw a
30:16 - rectangle at
30:18 - this.x comma zero all the way with a
30:21 - width of like let's say the width is 20
30:24 - and let's actually make that a variable
30:29 - and uh this width and also uh the height
30:33 - then is this do top and then I need
30:36 - another rectangle which uh starts from
30:41 - the bottom minus how tall it is and
30:44 - let's make uh minus this.bottom and its
30:49 - height is this.bottom
30:53 - okay pause I'm going to do an edit Point
30:55 - here because I really think that using
30:57 - the white the Whiteboard would be useful
31:01 - so this is when I publish this coding
31:03 - challenge I'm actually going to edit
31:04 - this part
31:06 - out uh because I'm kind of thinking it
31:09 - in my head but I feel like uh showing it
31:11 - on the Whiteboard would be useful uh so
31:14 - let me just erase the Whiteboard real
31:17 - quick I should have obviously I should
31:18 - have done this before I
31:26 - started
31:31 - uh okay
31:33 - so now I need a
31:35 - marker do I have a good marker
31:43 - somewhere
31:45 - okay uh will this marker
31:48 - work I think so can you see that screen
31:52 - okay
31:54 - um so I'm actually going to now go back
31:57 - into the
32:00 - video and draw a quick
32:03 - diagram okay in case this isn't making
32:05 - sense to you let's actually let's
32:07 - actually do a quick diagram here uh what
32:09 - I'm trying to do is create something
32:11 - that looks like
32:13 - this so I need two random numbers this
32:17 - length is what I'm calling Top This
32:19 - length is what I'm calling
32:21 - bottom and then this length this this
32:23 - width is what I'm calling W so I first
32:25 - draw a rectangle from here here with
32:27 - this width with a height of top and then
32:29 - I draw a rectangle from here which is
32:31 - height minus bottom which is this point
32:34 - with this width and then the height of
32:35 - that rectangle is bottom so this is what
32:37 - I'm get and if these values are random
32:39 - I'll sometimes get stuff that looks like
32:41 - this Etc now I could be more thoughtful
32:44 - like right now the way that I'm doing it
32:47 - there's this you could never get
32:49 - something that looks like this so it
32:51 - probably would make a uh I could
32:53 - probably do something different where I
32:54 - pick like a random empty amount of space
32:56 - and and then I pick a random starting
32:58 - point for that empty amount of space
32:59 - that might be interesting to do we can
33:01 - make that as an improvement later but
33:02 - let's just stick with what I have right
33:05 - now which I think is good enough okay
33:07 - I'm back over here and let's just see
33:09 - now I need a function like this.
33:11 - update and all I want to do in this.
33:14 - update is say this.x minus equals uh
33:17 - some
33:18 - speed this. speeed so uh let's say uh
33:22 - this do speed is always going to be five
33:25 - I'm going to just so all all of these
33:27 - are always going to move to the left so
33:29 - let's look now here in sketch I'm going
33:31 - to create uh an array called
33:34 - pipes and what I'm going to do is say uh
33:37 - pipes. push a new
33:41 - pipe and then in draw I'm going to say
33:45 - uh for all of the
33:48 - pipes in the array yeah I also have a
33:52 - problem with this somebody in the chat
33:53 - saying where I could technically have a
33:54 - pipe with no space in it so all that
33:56 - stuff can be corrected later and I want
33:58 - to say show and I want to say
34:02 - update so let's run this now and see
34:05 - there we go oh that's moving quite fast
34:08 - so let's go back to the pipe and let's
34:09 - just make the speed
34:11 - one so we could see ah look we basically
34:14 - have Flappy Bird already and it's so
34:17 - easy to play so it's moving kind of slow
34:19 - now but of course I only have one so
34:20 - let's think about this what a couple
34:22 - things that I want to do one is I want
34:24 - to um I want to say something like if
34:28 - frame count I want to have a pipe every
34:30 - like so often modulus 40 equals z which
34:33 - means every 40 frames the modulus
34:35 - operator being the remainder of division
34:38 - so anytime a number is divisible by 40
34:41 - with a remainder of zero is 0 40 80 120
34:44 - 160 Etc let's add a new
34:47 - pipe and let's see how this
34:53 - looks oh that's a lot of that's a lot of
34:56 - every 40 Fram
34:58 - is quite a few oh look at this oh I'm
34:59 - pretty good at
35:01 - this I need some like music to play
35:03 - along with this okay so that's no good
35:05 - obviously let's um let's make the pipes
35:08 - move a little bit faster twice as fast
35:11 - and let's uh let's say every 100
35:14 - frames so obviously you can see um how
35:18 - uh the speed of the pipes how frequent
35:20 - they are and we can see basically I have
35:22 - the game right now now I've made a very
35:23 - easy version of the game to play uh
35:27 - it's not very hard but one thing that I
35:29 - haven't done is figure out when I need
35:31 - to actually you know this I'm I'm doing
35:33 - a great job here so let's actually add
35:35 - something that shows us when the circle
35:38 - hits the pipe or doesn't hit the pipe so
35:40 - and also by the way I should be getting
35:42 - rid of the pipes at some point so one
35:44 - thing I should do is I should I should
35:47 - say if pipes index
35:50 - I uh is
35:53 - finished and I can actually just say x
35:56 - is less than zero and you know what I'm
35:58 - going to write a function I'll write a
36:00 - function called off screen so if the
36:02 - pipe is off the screen I want to say
36:04 - pipes. spce uh i1 so splice is a
36:09 - function that deletes an element from
36:11 - the array so I want to know if the pipe
36:12 - went off the screen get rid of it I
36:14 - don't need it anymore now of course
36:17 - there's a little bit of an issue here
36:18 - which is one is there's no such thing as
36:20 - a function called off screen that's a
36:21 - function I have to write there's another
36:23 - issue here which is that when I'm
36:25 - deleting stuff out of the array I should
36:27 - go through the array backwards and I've
36:28 - covered that in other videos but
36:30 - basically the array slides the elements
36:33 - slide back and if I'm going forwards the
36:35 - element slide back while I'm going
36:36 - forward I could end up skipping things
36:38 - um so I'm just going to switch my Loop
36:41 - to saying uh greater than or equal to
36:44 - zero and I minus minus and then I'm
36:48 - going to if I run this right no function
36:50 - named offscreen so I have to go into the
36:52 - pipe and I have to write a function
36:54 - called this. offscreen is a function and
36:57 - this is very simple I can just say if
36:59 - thisx is less than W right because I
37:03 - want it to be all the way off so it's
37:06 - with that has to be all the way off uh
37:08 - return true uh else return false and now
37:11 - I know all of you watching this video
37:13 - are going to complain to me and just say
37:15 - but couldn't you just say return this.x
37:17 - is less than negative W because that
37:19 - evaluates the true or false yes I could
37:22 - do that but you know what sometimes I
37:23 - like to write my code this way I like it
37:25 - to be longwind did multiple Lin I love
37:28 - the way the curly brackets just Nest
37:30 - themselves so beautifully I love to say
37:31 - return true return false you can write
37:34 - your code a different way but yeah uh
37:36 - and now I sort of feel like I should
37:37 - change it but I'm not going to I'll do
37:39 - it later okay so coming back let's see
37:41 - now we should see o w is not defined so
37:44 - I have to
37:49 - say always forget to this
37:51 - stu okay uh now we should see now I
37:55 - can't really tell if this is working I
37:56 - can only assume this is working but if I
37:59 - do something I say like this oh pipes.
38:02 - length if I look at the length of that
38:05 - array it's two and it's always two so
38:07 - even though I'm adding more and more
38:09 - they're getting deleted okay so we can
38:11 - be pretty sure that that's
38:13 - working okay now let's see now we've got
38:16 - to do the exciting part here I mean this
38:18 - whole thing hopefully is somewhat
38:21 - exciting but we've really got to get the
38:24 - gameplay mechanic where you it's going
38:26 - to give some visual feedback if you hit
38:28 - one of those pipes so let's think about
38:30 - how we might write this ultimately
38:32 - here's where I'm I have this single bird
38:34 - that says bird. update bird. show and
38:36 - I'm also looping through all the pipes
38:38 - so one thing I could do I don't really
38:39 - need to do it this way but I'm G to uh
38:42 - I'm going to move this Loop first uh
38:44 - just so the bird comes after and I'm
38:47 - going to
38:49 - say uh here I'm going to say if pipes's
38:53 - index
38:55 - I hits the
38:59 - bird then do something I'm just going to
39:01 - say
39:04 - console.log hit so I need to have a
39:09 - function that determines if a pipe has
39:12 - hit the bird so if looking at this bit
39:14 - of code you can see here what do I need
39:15 - to write I need to write a function
39:17 - called hits and that function is going
39:19 - to be part of the pipe object and it's
39:22 - going to receive a bird object as an
39:24 - argument so I'm going to go to the pipe
39:26 - object I'm going to write I'm just going
39:27 - to write the function up there here this
39:29 - do hits I called it hits equals function
39:33 - bird and now I just need to check what
39:36 - do I need to check I need to check if
39:39 - bird doy is less than the
39:42 - top and bird
39:46 - or or bird doy is greater than height
39:51 - minus this.bottom
39:54 - so if the bird is is ever uh if if I
39:58 - come back here to my whiteboard if the
40:00 - bird is ever right less than top or
40:05 - greater than height minus bottom here
40:09 - then it's kind of it's it's hitting that
40:11 - it's hitting that pipe so let's come
40:13 - back over here did I get that right it's
40:15 - greater than okay so then I want to say
40:17 - uh a return true although this isn't
40:19 - good enough right it's also got to be
40:23 - within the actual exposition so we
40:27 - should also say and um I could I'm I
40:29 - could be much better about how I
40:31 - construct this but I'm going to inside
40:32 - here go so let's just say it's within
40:35 - that stuff also let's now
40:37 - check if bird dox its exp position is
40:42 - greater than uh
40:45 - this.x
40:47 - and and bird dox is less than this.x
40:53 - plus this.w so I'm also just checking if
40:56 - it's in between the actual exposition of
40:58 - the pipe so if all of that is true I'm
41:01 - going to return true you know I'm just
41:03 - working it out we could I could this
41:05 - double if statement is kind of an awful
41:07 - way to write this and I could probably
41:08 - be more clever and I could write a
41:09 - separate function that just tests
41:11 - intersection between a circle and a
41:12 - rectangle but right now this will be
41:14 - good enough for us right now and I I
41:16 - look forward to hearing your
41:17 - improvements and suggestions in the
41:18 - comments so let's just see here uh if
41:22 - whoops right now I'm not seeing anything
41:25 - hit hit ah so this is basically
41:28 - working you can see that any time oh
41:31 - this is going to be hard oh so let's
41:33 - actually give ourselves some visual
41:34 - feedback um if this is the case uh
41:39 - let's let's write a variable called
41:41 - highlight set it equal to false let's
41:44 - also say this. highlight equals true and
41:47 - then under fill under show I'm going to
41:49 - say if this.
41:52 - highlight I'm going to say fill uh to
41:55 - I'm going to make it red so let's just
41:57 - see if this gives us some nice visual
42:02 - feedback oh you know what I never said
42:04 - highlight equal to
42:05 - false so watch it hits it so you know
42:09 - that's fine but I might want to uh
42:11 - actually also say
42:14 - uh uh this do highlight equals false oh
42:18 - if it's not hitting it so
42:21 - now here we go it hit hits it you can
42:24 - see so now I could add like score I
42:27 - could be more careful about like I'm
42:29 - really only checking the
42:31 - center go go go go go go
42:35 - go
42:38 - who this is way too easy to play oh
42:41 - there we go okay so you get the idea so
42:43 - I I think that I've kind of completed
42:45 - this um there's a lot of improvements
42:46 - that I would want to make to this in
42:48 - terms of being more thoughtful about
42:50 - checking that intersection to be a bit
42:51 - more precise good enough though be a bit
42:54 - I could do a better job of picking the
42:56 - um the the way that uh oh here's a
42:59 - difficult one a better job of how I pick
43:02 - the top and bottom Heights of these
43:04 - rectangles um I could add score right
43:07 - you start with the score maybe as time
43:09 - goes on your score goes up every time
43:10 - you hit a pip the score goes down all
43:12 - those things I I I would say um ask me
43:15 - your questions in the comments uh
43:18 - suggest make versions of this and and
43:20 - tweet me your uh exciting you know you
43:23 - could make a nice Bird design you could
43:24 - reimagine this entire game to not be a
43:27 - bird in pipes but to be you know a
43:29 - flower in rainbows I don't know how that
43:31 - would work um so uh so um tweet me and
43:36 - share with me all of your uh interesting
43:38 - variations on this and I'll maybe come
43:40 - back and do some a Q&A video where I
43:42 - follow up on some of your questions and
43:43 - make some improvements to this Flappy
43:45 - Bird challenge okay thanks for watching
43:47 - and I will see you in a future coding
43:49 - challenge
43:51 - goodbye all right everyone my hands are
43:55 - detached uh so
44:01 - um uh the WG Bros makes a great
44:04 - suggestion in the chat make it find the
44:06 - nearest XY coordinates of the pipe to
44:08 - the circle and check if the distance is
44:10 - less than the radius of the bird yes uh
44:13 - was it 25 minutes yeah 20 I I see 23
44:16 - minutes but there was like 30 seconds to
44:17 - a minute in there where I um uh I erase
44:21 - the Whiteboard that'll get edited out
44:24 - when I make a sort of edited version of
44:25 - this okay um how any questions any
44:31 - comments I forgot to hit the bell at the
44:34 - end that's the reason for this
44:37 - Bell um oops wrong
44:41 - buttoning power all
44:48 - right ah so uh Jack Napier in the chat
44:51 - asks does anybody know um how I changed
44:54 - the theme of P5 so I'm not actually
44:56 - using the P5 editor I'm using Sublime
44:58 - Text as an editor and just running a
45:00 - local server in the
45:02 - background um which I have a video
45:04 - actually that shows how to do that if
45:06 - you look for like Google on YouTube
45:08 - search on YouTube shiftman local server
45:11 - P5 or something you'll find it okay so
45:14 - um today I feel like the theme of today
45:17 - is game stuff I really picked the simple
45:20 - one to start with um a lot of I've had
45:23 - this request to do
45:26 - uh agar iio how do you say it agario
45:31 - agar.io I'm going to click play as a
45:33 - guest so this is also a very simple game
45:38 - where with this mouse I move a and is it
45:43 - always moving in the oops I lost um
45:48 - continue no play as guest uh let me just
45:50 - see here now so it's always moving
45:52 - exactly in the direction of the
45:54 - mouse uh uh and I guess the idea is that
45:57 - I I can eat the smaller things and if
46:00 - something that's bigger than me gets me
46:02 - then I die but if I get something that's
46:05 - if I get something that I'm bigger then
46:06 - I eat it and this is all multiplayer and
46:08 - networked and people have names and
46:09 - they're on teams and someone's oh oh
46:13 - we're just like punching each other here
46:15 - when we we to similar in size like how
46:18 - do I yeah so that one was big enough me
46:20 - to me so
46:24 - um so I don't I've actually never played
46:27 - this game till well I looked at it last
46:29 - night actually when I was thinking about
46:30 - things that I would do today so this
46:32 - doing this as a coding challenge
46:34 - presents a lot of complications one is
46:37 - to do the full multiplayer aspect of it
46:40 - I need quite an elaborate web server
46:43 - system using sockets and managing a list
46:45 - of players and you know some sort of
46:47 - scale you know terms of people connected
46:49 - to it um so I think I could do this in a
46:53 - multi-part series maybe I should should
46:55 - do the traveling salesperson today
46:58 - aarion is that what it's called
47:01 - um um so I'm trying to think of what how
47:04 - to best use the time that I have left
47:06 - today I had this list let me look at my
47:10 - list you guys Talk Amongst yourself for
47:13 - a
47:19 - [Music]
47:24 - second
47:26 - uh okay um I'm looking for my list of
47:30 - topics that I had that I was thinking
47:32 - about oh
47:34 - yeah oh I forgot about the point
47:37 - sampling I'm afraid of this agario thing
47:39 - let me check the chat see what everybody
47:44 - [Music]
47:45 - saying you can also split yourself and
47:48 - fire things that are viruses interesting
47:52 - no n at the end
47:54 - okay
47:57 - um so I would be I think this is
48:00 - interesting the other thing I like about
48:01 - this is I like how these are kind of
48:04 - like a little bit Blobby and we can make
48:06 - them a little bit Blobby so um so let's
48:10 - keep with the theme of games today I did
48:12 - Flappy Bird and let's try to begin this
48:16 - agario
48:18 - thing I could always do Tetris there's
48:20 - no way I'm doing Tetris today so I don't
48:23 - I'm I'm only going to be here for about
48:24 - another half an hour or so um yeah I
48:28 - should make a way that you can launch
48:30 - sounds remotely um so
48:34 - let's
48:36 - um
48:39 - okay play my Flappy Bird game for a
48:41 - little bit I feeling a little tired a
48:42 - little
48:44 - sad uh okay trigger
48:49 - Frogger
48:51 - froger oo I love the idea of Frogger
48:59 - hold
48:59 - [Music]
49:03 - on Frogger
49:05 - [Music]
49:08 - classic uh so how do I do
49:12 - this oh how
49:15 - lovely this is probably much harder to
49:17 - do
49:18 - [Music]
49:19 - than you would
49:24 - think sorry I just got distracted by
49:27 - enjoying playing
49:28 - froger oh why do I oh I have to get on
49:30 - the things I
49:32 - [Music]
49:39 - forgot you know I I kind of want to do
49:42 - this but I want to think about this this
49:44 - is great somebody add this somebody add
49:47 - Frogger to uh oops somebody add Frogger
49:50 - to the uh rainbow topics uh GitHub and
49:53 - we're going to work I just all I need is
49:54 - for uh
49:56 - somebody to tell me how to pronounce
49:58 - agario and I'm to start doing that as
50:00 - the next coding
50:02 - challenge so let's go get Flappy
50:07 - Bird and uh AAR
50:10 - AAR
50:12 - IO yes ad all let's just make this okay
50:17 - and I'm gonna open this again in
50:20 - Sublime oh that's Adam I forgot that
50:23 - Adam wasn't working for me
50:26 - and we're going to close Floppy
50:30 - Bird and I'm going to make this an
50:33 - object I'm going to make this called
50:43 - blob and uh I'm gonna get rid of
50:47 - this
50:50 - and
50:52 - uh get rid of all this stuff
51:02 - uh that's the correct way to say it okay
51:06 - uh okay and setup
51:10 - draw I didn't eat a big enough breakfast
51:12 - today this is a
51:15 - problem uh and here it is okay great uh
51:18 - pipe is missing I don't need that this
51:22 - is
51:24 - blob let's give myself a slightly larger
51:27 - pixel space see if we can manage
51:31 - that I think that works console doesn't
51:34 - need to be so big um yeah I have been
51:37 - using um I have been using Adam the adom
51:41 - editor uh in most of my videos as a text
51:43 - editor but for some reason um I'm
51:46 - getting a weird error in it this morning
51:47 - and I don't feel like wasting time
51:51 - uh okay I uh so a lot of you are asking
51:54 - about Flappy Bird I just made made
51:55 - Flappy Bird so when the archive of the
51:57 - stream gets released you'll be able to
51:58 - watch that back and then there'll be an
52:01 - I actually there's one small edit point
52:03 - in it where I was like erasing the
52:04 - Whiteboard that'll also be published as
52:05 - a separate video uh actually you know
52:09 - what I
52:12 - uh okay um I'm sad to hear that the
52:15 - stream is not working for some of you I
52:18 - don't I don't have any
52:21 - um I don't have any um good advice for
52:25 - you guys about that okay so let's look
52:27 - up
52:29 - uh let me go here is is can I find a
52:33 - Wikipedia page for
52:35 - this uh
52:37 - yep
52:39 - okay matius Bala
52:43 - valadares
52:45 - uh okay so those of you who are having
52:47 - problems with the stream I wish I could
52:50 - uh do something about that right now but
52:53 - one thing I'll say is all of this is
52:54 - being recorded
52:55 - so at you know apologize that maybe it's
52:57 - not working so great for you live right
52:59 - now um but it will be published as an
53:01 - archive you'll be able to watch it later
53:04 - okay okay
53:07 - um right I guess I'm talking to the
53:10 - people who can't watch the stream as if
53:12 - they can hear me which is a bit of a
53:13 - problem
53:15 - okay okay getting ready for
53:24 - this
53:42 - oops
53:45 - power where's all my special
53:48 - effects special effects aren't happening
53:50 - right now okay so
53:53 - um let's recycle the
53:57 - camera I'm doing this in
54:04 - JavaScript okay here we
54:10 - go so oops no okay so I think this will
54:14 - be um the last coding challenge for
54:16 - today and then I'll hopefully have some
54:18 - time to take uh some questions at the
54:20 - end uh
54:23 - okay I like how people in the chat are
54:25 - asking what is happening why is he
54:27 - dancing clearly first time
54:31 - viewers
54:33 - uh hold
54:35 - on you might also be wondering why am I
54:38 - attaching stickers to
54:40 - myself there oh you can't really see
54:42 - that one that's another sticker okay
54:45 - here we
54:54 - go
54:57 - [Music]
55:01 - hello and welcome to another game coding
55:04 - challenge now this was suggested to me
55:06 - by a actually hold
55:10 - timeout let's find
55:13 - it start
55:24 - over
55:25 - all right start
55:30 - here I'm starting
55:35 - again hello everyone welcome to another
55:38 - coding challenge today's coding
55:40 - challenge is agario agar.io agario a
55:45 - game that I am was not familiar with
55:47 - until recently when little a on GitHub
55:49 - suggested this particular game I looked
55:51 - it up I played it for a few minutes uh
55:53 - it's a massively multi player game uh
55:56 - created by matus valadas I don't know if
55:58 - I'm um uh um pronouncing that correctly
56:02 - you could go to agar.io and play it
56:04 - yourself but basically you're this blob
56:06 - moving around the screen and you eat
56:07 - other blobs now here's the thing this is
56:09 - actually quite complex the simple
56:10 - mechanic I think it's going to be
56:12 - hopefully something easy that I can
56:13 - Implement in this short video but I'm
56:15 - going to do this in several stages and
56:18 - so part one is going I'm going to
56:19 - implement the basic game mechanic and in
56:21 - part two I will start to look at how you
56:23 - we might how I might use you might use
56:25 - websockets to create a multiplayer
56:27 - version of this game so this video is
56:28 - just going to be the basic game mechanic
56:30 - so I'm using the p5js framework I'm
56:32 - using the suime uh text editor I have a
56:35 - canvas and a black background that's all
56:37 - I'm starting with and I also I've
56:39 - created a separate oops darn ah oh pause
56:44 - or don't pause hold on
56:46 - uh yeah
56:53 - pause
56:55 - oh yeah hopefully I didn't mess up the
56:56 - Flappy Bird
56:59 - thing edit point back in sorry
57:02 - Mata um and I also have a Javascript
57:05 - file called blob. JS where I'm going to
57:07 - write a Constructor function to create
57:09 - this idea of a blob object The Blob
57:11 - object will serve to be both you the
57:14 - blob moving around the screen as well as
57:16 - other little blobs that you are trying
57:17 - to eat so what is this blob need now I'm
57:19 - going to use Vector objects which are
57:22 - something that exists in P5 a vector
57:24 - being an object that stores an X and A Y
57:26 - component for a position on the screen
57:28 - and lots of other things that we could
57:29 - do with that so I'm going to say this.
57:31 - pause equals create Victor Vector Victor
57:34 - what's your Victor Vector uh width
57:36 - divided by two height divided by two and
57:38 - then I'm going to write a function
57:39 - called
57:41 - show uh which actually since it's in
57:43 - this object I'm going to write this.
57:45 - show equals
57:47 - function and I'm going to say Phill 255
57:50 - and I'm going to draw an ellipse at
57:51 - this.x this.y and I also I definitely
57:54 - need a variable to keep track of the
57:55 - radius the size of this blob let's just
57:58 - make it 32 or 64 to start with so then
58:01 - the size of the ellipse is the radius
58:03 - times two and the height is the radius
58:06 - times two so now if I go to sketch I can
58:09 - just say VAR
58:11 - blob blob equals new
58:16 - blob blob. show so let's just
58:20 - see where's the blob oh something's
58:23 - going terribly wrong
58:31 - pause oh don't pause or
58:38 - pause I'm kind of being silly here where
58:41 - I forgot the whole point of this was I
58:43 - made a vector called pause for position
58:45 - and then I tried to draw it at this.x
58:47 - which doesn't exist so
58:49 - this.x this.
58:51 - p.y there we go so there we are in the
58:54 - window now this is something a little
58:57 - bit crazy as I just realized as part of
59:00 - this game so I want to move around the
59:03 - space so the but the thing is I don't in
59:07 - the game this blob that you're seeing on
59:09 - the screen right here moves but visually
59:11 - it stays the same and rather the world
59:13 - shifts relative to it so we've got to
59:15 - kind of figure that out so I'm going to
59:18 - do something else here I think to help
59:20 - us where I'm going to make an array
59:22 - called blobs Bo I need some better
59:24 - variable names uh blobs can be just an
59:29 - empty array and by the
59:32 - way I think that I should give the blob
59:35 - a variable in the
59:37 - Constructor so I can actually say how
59:39 - big to make it so I want this blob to be
59:42 - 64 and now I want to
59:44 - say uh VAR I equals z i is less than I'm
59:48 - going to add 10 smaller
59:52 - blobs blob's index I equals new blob
59:56 - which will be smaller all these blobs
59:57 - are going to be 16 and then now I can
60:00 - have a loop in the draw
60:06 - Loop where uh I call show on all of
60:11 - those now look at that they're all in
60:14 - the center that's a bit of a problem so
60:17 - how about we also something we could do
60:20 - is in this blob object I could also give
60:22 - it an X and A Y
60:25 - and then I could say here I want this
60:27 - blob to be this blob to be in the
60:29 - middle and I want these blobs to be at a
60:32 - random
60:36 - location and then the blob is made with
60:39 - that X and
60:42 - Y there we go so this is where we're
60:45 - starting we have this idea of one blob
60:47 - that is me I am the blob and then lots
60:50 - of other little blobs that are food that
60:51 - I want to eat so now the way that the
60:54 - agario works is the blob moves in the
60:57 - direction of the mouse so let's see if
60:59 - we can figure out how to make that
61:00 - happen okay so what I want to do is add
61:03 - a function called
61:06 - update and let's think about how this
61:09 - camera went off let's think about um I
61:14 - have some old Flappy Bird diagram here
61:17 - that I'm going to erase let's think
61:18 - about how this actually works so here is
61:21 - the blob and here's the
61:23 - mouse
61:25 - what I want is I need to create a vector
61:28 - an arrow that points from The Blob
61:30 - towards the mouse and I want that to be
61:32 - the direction that it moves so this is
61:33 - actually quite easy to do because coming
61:36 - back over here if I know this position
61:38 - and I know this position if I take this
61:40 - position minus this position I get a
61:42 - vector that points from here to there so
61:45 - I can actually use coming back over here
61:48 - I can say mouse equals create Vector
61:52 - Mouse
61:53 - X Mouse Y and then I could say mouse.
61:57 - subtract uh this. position and then I
62:01 - can just say uh I could say mouse do uh
62:05 - set magnitude to like three set
62:08 - magnitude just takes that Vector however
62:10 - long it might be and sets it to a
62:12 - specific magnitude and then I could say
62:14 - this.
62:16 - pause
62:18 - add
62:21 - ex what am I doing this do pod add Mouse
62:24 - so really th this is how I'm calculating
62:27 - the
62:28 - velocity and oops we got some errors
62:31 - here blob. JS line 5 this. update equals
62:36 - [Music]
62:38 - function oh and you know what would help
62:41 - if I called this. update if I called
62:43 - blob.
62:45 - update Mouse is not defined and oops I'm
62:50 - calling it velocity now so you can see
62:52 - how that blob is now following the mouse
62:55 - here's the thing though it's moving and
62:57 - not the other stuff so I want the my
63:00 - view of the world to be relative to this
63:04 - particular
63:06 - object so how do we do that H I have an
63:10 - idea what
63:12 - if instead of what if okay okay okay I'm
63:17 - gonna use the translate function let me
63:19 - come back over
63:23 - here this is where the object
63:26 - is and this is where the origin is z z
63:30 - but let's say the object moves over here
63:33 - what if I move the origin over to here
63:37 - then we should see it still wait wait no
63:41 - no I need to move the origin the other
63:42 - way if I move the origin over here
63:47 - right it would be kind of here which
63:50 - would appear back in the center of our
63:52 - screen I I kind of got lost in my own
63:54 - thoughts there basically what I want to
63:55 - do is it's moving over here but I want
63:57 - to shift the view to be over there and
63:59 - the view of where we're seeing
64:01 - everything is kind of like where is the
64:02 - origin point in our canvas and translate
64:05 - is a function that shifts the origin so
64:07 - what if I just said right here
64:09 - translate by blob. position. X blob.
64:14 - position. Y negative now I think this is
64:18 - going to be a little bit off and you'll
64:19 - see why in a
64:21 - second it's working but the blob is at
64:24 - the top left so really what I want to do
64:26 - is translate by the
64:28 - center because that's really where I
64:30 - want to have the view minus that and now
64:33 - we can
64:34 - see as I move the mouse around the blob
64:38 - is that always stays in the center but
64:40 - these other things move am I doing this
64:43 - right guys tell me in the chat if this
64:45 - is kind of the right
64:48 - idea it's not right
64:51 - look is it yeah move this way move this
64:55 - way move up move down move this way move
64:58 - this way move this way move this way it
65:00 - is uh it's just sort of sort of strange
65:02 - to see let's add a lot more of
65:07 - these it feels like I'm steering it
65:12 - incorrectly okay people are saying it's
65:14 - right feels a little off to me but okay
65:16 - the other thing about okay the other
65:18 - thing that's a little bit crazy here is
65:21 - that what what's happening now
65:28 - why does it do that and
65:35 - pause smoothing dampening for the
65:37 - controls yeah it needs that hold on I'm
65:40 - thinking for a
65:43 - second yeah making a full screen would
65:45 - certainly help
65:47 - um why is
65:51 - it oh I know the problem
65:59 - and we're back so I forgot something as
66:02 - soon as I started moving it around I
66:03 - forgot that the this actual velocity is
66:06 - being tracked relative to the object's
66:09 - position which now is off somewhere and
66:11 - that it's actually The Mouse and the
66:13 - position in the same place and all sorts
66:14 - of I actually what I want now is I need
66:17 - to
66:20 - subtract just the center of the
66:23 - window
66:25 - so I can actually just create a vector
66:27 - like this I don't want to actually any
66:29 - more subtract the actual position of the
66:31 - object because the position object is
66:32 - relative to the world but the user's
66:34 - interaction is always relative to the
66:35 - center of the window and so that's what
66:38 - that's what was messing things up so now
66:40 - you can see um this work works well now
66:42 - there's another sort of issue here which
66:44 - is that the world should really be much
66:46 - bigger than what I'm seeing actually the
66:49 - width of the the canvas itself and in
66:51 - that sense we can kind of do that really
66:54 - rather easily by saying um uh let's pick
66:58 - a random X between like negative width
67:01 - and width divided times two and let's
67:04 - pick a y between negative height and
67:07 - height times two just so we have kind of
67:09 - like a larger
67:11 - space for the blobs to live in and so
67:15 - now you can see that as I move around
67:18 - there's a much kind of larger world uh
67:21 - of of things for me to eat potentially
67:25 - okay so I think we're moving along here
67:27 - we've got the basic gist of the game
67:31 - okay um now I need to add one more thing
67:34 - here which is that if I eat one of these
67:37 - if I find one of these other pieces of
67:39 - blob things and eat it then I get a
67:41 - little bit bigger I think that's
67:42 - something that happens in the game so
67:44 - one thing that I need to do is When
67:45 - We're looping through all of these
67:49 - blobs uh we should check function oh
67:53 - yeah if blob beats blobs index I then
67:56 - blob
67:58 - grows and actually what I want to do is
68:02 - uh remove that blob so blob index I.S
68:06 - splice 0 comma 1 I find myself saying
68:08 - this a lot these days I also want to
68:10 - Loop through the array backwards because
68:15 - I just said this in another video I made
68:17 - but uh if I'm removing things from the
68:20 - array as I'm going forward through the
68:22 - array the the elements SL backwards and
68:24 - I could Skip One by accident so it's
68:25 - good to Loop through the array backwards
68:28 - uh so let's see I want to check if the
68:31 - blob eats one of those other blobs then
68:33 - I want to remove one of those other
68:35 - blobs from the array and how do I
68:36 - determine if it eats it the way that I
68:39 - do that is by writing a function eats
68:43 - which receives another blob I'll call
68:46 - other and I need to check something I
68:48 - need to know what is the distance
68:50 - between this blob's x you know what and
68:53 - actually there is a P5 Vector distance
68:56 - function so I'm going to say what is the
68:57 - distance between this blob's position
68:59 - and the other blob's
69:02 - position and if that distance is less
69:04 - than this blob's radius plus the other
69:06 - blob's radius then we've eaten it why is
69:08 - that true oops I hit the wrong button uh
69:13 - right if I have two
69:15 - objects and I check their distance
69:17 - relative to the sum of the two radiuses
69:19 - radi if they're overlapping that sum
69:22 - that distance going to is going to be
69:24 - less than it if they're not overlapping
69:26 - that distance is going to be greater
69:27 - than that sum so coming back over here
69:31 - we can now say if it eats it then I can
69:33 - also let's say this do R gets bigger
69:36 - gets bigger by the other's radius and
69:39 - also return
69:41 - true
69:43 - otherwise otherwise return
69:47 - false and come over here to the blob
69:50 - come over here back to the main program
69:52 - and I think that's basically it so let's
69:54 - see how that works oops invalid left
69:56 - hand side in assignment un sketch. 21 uh
70:00 - what's oh I equals blobs length minus
70:02 - one okay so we should see here oop blobs
70:05 - indexi dos splice is not a function okay
70:08 - of course what am I doing here this is
70:09 - absolutely incorrect I don't know what I
70:12 - haven't eaten breakfast this morning
70:14 - clearly I'm kind of struggling here for
70:16 - my energy I want to splice out of the
70:19 - array at index I one element which means
70:22 - remove index one element starting at
70:25 - index I I don't know what I was writing
70:26 - before was completely wrong uh blobs
70:30 - splice refresh here come on eat there we
70:33 - go
70:34 - eat eat eat okay so it's getting quite a
70:38 - bit too big just from eating a blob so
70:41 - let's let's divide that let's multiply
70:43 - that by like 0
70:46 - 2 and we can
70:49 - see there we go and I think that what
70:52 - might be
70:55 - um okay so okay I'm going to pause for a
71:00 - second all right people are telling me
71:02 - some things um people are telling me in
71:05 - the game they don't eat it immediately
71:07 - when they touch so when
71:12 - um uh so guys give me some corrections
71:15 - here so um they don't eat each other
71:18 - immediately when they touch that's
71:19 - fixable um the other thing that I feel
71:21 - like some dampening would help
71:26 - right it seems like I'm let's go to the
71:28 - actual game is there dampening in the
71:34 - game no feels the same it's just your
71:37 - kind of
71:40 - smaller oh yeah it kind of adjusts
71:43 - there's a little bit of an interpolating
71:45 - okay so let's do a little bit of an
71:47 - interpolating to the
71:49 - velocity um I should scale everything
71:51 - else uh the screen zooms out instead of
71:54 - The Blob size increase
71:58 - really oh blob size stays the same does
72:03 - that really is that really how it
72:05 - works that's interesting okay oh that's
72:09 - cool ah so we use scale
72:12 - interesting okay
72:14 - okay global scale okay so that I can fix
72:18 - too okay I'm going to come back I'm
72:20 - going to do two things you shouldn't add
72:23 - the rate by calculate both blob's areas
72:25 - add them and get back the radius
72:29 - okay you increase the size but the zoom
72:32 - out cancels it somewhat okay okay
72:36 - calculate the blob areas add them that
72:39 - makes sense that makes
72:41 - sense area is pi r s right okay okay so
72:47 - I'm going to return
72:49 - here okay I'm back uh the chat gave me
72:52 - some nice helpful suggestions a couple
72:54 - things about how the game actually works
72:56 - one is uh increasing the blob's radius
72:59 - is not actually how the game works and
73:01 - this is actually a great thing that you
73:03 - should learn about if you're not
73:04 - familiar with because we often think of
73:06 - The Blob a circle size as its radius but
73:09 - that's not really its size the size that
73:11 - we're seeing is its um surface area the
73:14 - area which is calculated uh pi r squared
73:17 - so let's look at that so let's actually
73:20 - let's fix that for a second so um I'm
73:22 - going to make a variable called sum
73:24 - which is equal to Pi * this. R * this R
73:30 - plus pi time other R time other R so
73:34 - that is the sum of the two uh areas of
73:38 - of The Blob that's eating the smaller
73:39 - blob now the new radius should be the
73:42 - radius that's associated with that
73:43 - particular sum and how do I get that
73:46 - well um let's think about this really
73:48 - quick uh
73:51 - if the area equals p r 2 then R2 = area
73:58 - / Pi and R equals the square root of
74:02 - area divided Pi so I can just solve for
74:05 - r with that particular equation and I
74:07 - can come back to
74:09 - here
74:11 - ah
74:13 - no I'm getting I'm bad at my switching
74:15 - screen I can come back to here and I can
74:18 - say uh this. R equals the square root of
74:23 - that
74:24 - area uh what did I say oh no no that
74:27 - area divided by pi so let's take a look
74:30 - at
74:33 - that ah there we go that's such a more
74:35 - beautiful and elegant uh interaction now
74:38 - the other thing that I was told that
74:40 - actually happens with uh Gario is that
74:43 - instead of the um instead of you seeing
74:47 - your circle grow the actual view of the
74:50 - world kind of zooms out so while you're
74:52 - growing gr what you see is you stay the
74:55 - same size and the other circles kind of
74:56 - shrink and we can do that in P5 using
74:58 - the scale function so um in the same way
75:01 - that I used this translate function I
75:04 - could scale the World by um the blob's
75:10 - current radius divided by what it
75:12 - started with which is 64 so right if its
75:15 - radius is 64 then I'm scaling the word
75:18 - World by one so uh let's see how this
75:21 - works now the problem is this is causing
75:24 - everything to shift to the
75:26 - right which is not great so and um and
75:31 - by the way the radius is getting bigger
75:33 - so I wanted to do it the other way 64
75:35 - divided by the blob's
75:37 - radius I wanted to shrink so this is
75:40 - working but everything is kind of
75:41 - Shifting up that's because I
75:43 - unfortunately am drawing everything
75:44 - relative to the top left so really what
75:46 - I want to do is I need to change the
75:48 - whole view of everything for the blob to
75:51 - start at 0 0 which is better anyway so I
75:54 - want the blob to start at 0 0 Let's go
75:57 - back to the main sketch I want me the
76:00 - blob to start at Z 0 and the other blobs
76:03 - can just go from negative width to
76:06 - positive
76:08 - width um negative height to positive
76:10 - height that should work I kind of had
76:11 - that weird before anyway and then the
76:15 - world is actually just drawn relative to
76:18 - negative the blob's position so I'm
76:21 - always doing everything relative to that
76:23 - particular blob which starts at z z
76:25 - that's going to make things much better
76:27 - oops um wait wait
76:31 - wait width divided by two plus
76:36 - wait I did this
76:39 - wrong whoa uh
76:42 - minus yeah there we go wait something is
76:45 - still
76:47 - off time
76:48 - out scale first then translate thank you
76:55 - no wait wait wait hold
76:58 - on let me think about
77:01 - this uh okay I want
77:04 - to first thing I want to do is translate
77:06 - to the
77:10 - center everything okay
77:15 - look I want to translate to the
77:21 - center this should make the blob okay
77:24 - that's what I want right so it's working
77:27 - correctly then I need to scale then I
77:31 - need to tr offset do the offset from the
77:33 - blob's
77:40 - location I think this is right now yeah
77:44 - yeah okay okay hold
77:46 - on let's go back because I think this is
77:48 - g to get edited
77:49 - out I got to edit this back okay
77:53 - the figuring out is probably good I
77:55 - should keep that okay there's a there's
77:56 - a kind of an issue going on here so um
77:59 - let me think about this let me get this
78:00 - right here for a second I want I've done
78:02 - this twice now but hopefully you're
78:03 - seeing an edited version of this now um
78:05 - so the problem is actually that the
78:07 - first thing that I need to
78:10 - do is translate to the center so let's
78:14 - not do anything just right now but
78:16 - translate to the center so now you can
78:18 - see this is where the blob moves freely
78:19 - around and it should be growing as it
78:21 - eats other blobs now what I want to do
78:24 - is uh I wanted to I want to scale it I
78:28 - wanted to scale it by its relative size
78:30 - relative its size relative to its
78:32 - original
78:34 - size so you can see the world is kind of
78:36 - shrinking rather than the blob
78:39 - growing but now that I have that I need
78:42 - to do the scale before I trans I offset
78:44 - the whole world then by negative the
78:47 - blob's X position negative the blob's Y
78:50 - position so now if I do it in that
78:54 - order you're going to oh whoa whoa whoa
78:58 - whoa I need a comma there now we can see
79:02 - we have the world uh doing what we I
79:05 - originally hoped and intended it to do
79:07 - so um so okay so now you can see that
79:11 - things are very kind of Herky jerky here
79:14 - um and that's because everything happens
79:16 - instantly the scale changes instantly
79:18 - The View changes instantly and it could
79:21 - be nice to have things massaged a little
79:24 - bit smoothed a little bit and a way to
79:26 - do that is with a function called in P5
79:29 - called lurp which stands for linear
79:31 - interpolation instead of taking a value
79:33 - and setting it directly to the new value
79:35 - just want to kind of move slowly towards
79:37 - that new value and so let's let's do
79:39 - that with scale um
79:42 - so the new scale is 64 divided blob.
79:48 - R but I need a variable I'm going to
79:50 - call I don't want to call it scale
79:51 - because there's a P5 function called
79:53 - scale so I'm actually going to call it
79:55 - Zoom so Zoom I'm going to start Zoom
79:57 - equal to one and zoom should always be
80:02 - the lurp between the a value in between
80:06 - itself and what the new Zoom
80:09 - is and now the last argument of this
80:12 - lurp function I have a whole video about
80:13 - lurp you can find that video uh if I
80:16 - make it like
80:18 - 0.1 let's see what happens oh wa wait
80:21 - hold on hold on hold on hold on
80:24 - .9 oh wait wait wait I got to actually
80:27 - put it in there sorry everybody I got to
80:29 - actually use the variable I
80:31 - created so what I want is I want it to
80:34 - be just a little bit 10% of the new
80:38 - value so that I interpolate towards
80:42 - it and can you see that happening kind
80:44 - of smoothly let me um so one thing I
80:47 - want to do uh just to make this more
80:49 - obvious is I'm gonna just make it uh 10
80:53 - times that amount
80:57 - whoops oh okay wait hold on hold on I
81:00 - think I had it Opposite I think this
81:02 - should be 0.
81:03 - n no hold
81:06 - on
81:18 - pause it's just such a subtle
81:21 - change that I'm not seeing it I think I
81:24 - did it right
81:26 - though um hold
81:34 - on why is
81:37 - it if I just multiply it by two it's so
81:40 - much more let's do um just temporarily
81:44 - let's do
81:49 - this okay so that's growing really fast
81:54 - and so I had it
81:57 - wrong
82:01 - no comment out the blob's
82:05 - radius new zoom zoom equals lurp to the
82:10 - new
82:14 - Zoom make 0.1 smaller yeah I
82:20 - know okay hold on let's
82:23 - let me just test something
82:30 - here lurp X comma y
82:36 - .01 yeah
82:38 - 100.5 so that is
82:42 - the the distance like I'm I'm going 1%
82:46 - from X to Y and I want to go 1% from the
82:52 - zoom Zoom to the new zoom and zoom
82:55 - starts at
82:58 - one and
83:00 - this the scale is
83:03 - slower than the
83:05 - lurp so this in my view this should
83:11 - work
83:13 - oh oh it is actually
83:16 - working I'm just not seeing it because
83:20 - the lurp is
83:24 - I'm just yeah you can see it there this
83:26 - is what I was trying to show
83:28 - you it was working all along I just kind
83:31 - of was like not looking at it correctly
83:33 - that's what I said yeah you all are
83:35 - giving me the corrections
83:39 - okay
83:45 - okay okay hold
83:51 - on
83:53 - how am I on time what time is it
83:55 - everybody 12:15 so I've got to wrap this
83:57 - up okay got to finish this video I'm
83:59 - going to do this with the velocity as
84:00 - well
84:02 - um okay
84:05 - uh okay here we go okay
84:15 - um okay hi
84:18 - everybody okay I don't know mat you're
84:21 - gonna have to edit this somehow I don't
84:22 - know it'll be awkward but it's fine okay
84:25 - back for a second let's take a look
84:28 - actually forget it I'm not going to say
84:29 - back for a second this'll just be a
84:30 - weird edit
84:31 - Point Let's adjust the way the radius is
84:33 - growing to try to get a better look at
84:35 - this so I'm going to change the radius
84:37 - I'm going to take away that uh the using
84:39 - the surface area and just actually add
84:41 - the two radi together um and then now we
84:43 - should be able to see and and by the way
84:46 - there's so many it's actually I
84:48 - shouldn't allow any of the it also like
84:50 - it just eats a lot of blobs immediately
84:52 - so let me start with quite a few fewer
84:54 - just
84:55 - 10 and so now we can see what happens as
84:58 - I eat a blob it gets really big
85:00 - immediately but then the View kind of
85:02 - slowly interpolates and shrinks so you
85:04 - can obviously tune these numbers a
85:06 - little bit better but I'm going to go
85:07 - back now to the surface area and sort of
85:10 - see and I think I want to add one more
85:12 - interpolation here which is just to
85:14 - interpolate its velocity so that it
85:16 - doesn't immediately get the new velocity
85:19 - but rather kind of smoothly turns a
85:21 - little bit as you move the El around I
85:22 - don't know that agario is actually doing
85:25 - that but I think that might be an
85:26 - interesting thing to add so I'm going to
85:28 - add that here uh in the blob object I'm
85:32 - going to say I'm going to give it a
85:35 - velocity I'm going to give it a variable
85:37 - velocity create Vector uh uh and it's
85:41 - going to be empty 0 0 to start and then
85:44 - this is going to be its new velocity and
85:47 - its new velocity has a magnitude of
85:49 - three and its velocity I'm going to lurp
85:53 - to the new velocity by 0.1 so let's just
85:56 - see how that works uh is not defined and
85:59 - of course I
86:01 - forgot
86:03 - no I either this
86:06 - dot uh blob. 10 uh and this needs this
86:10 - dot
86:13 - velocity so you can see it's kind of the
86:16 - Turning is a little bit more
86:18 - interpolated now is a little bit
86:20 - smoother is it still going in the right
86:22 - direction right so you could play with
86:23 - that number quite a bit like if I made
86:25 - this number you know
86:28 - 0.01 its turning is going to be quite
86:31 - slow if I made that
86:33 - number 0.9 it's going to be as if it
86:36 - turns instantly so I'm going to just
86:38 - like use point two and you can see now
86:39 - there's a it's a little bit smoother now
86:41 - let's add let's go back to the original
86:44 - sketch and let's add a whole bunch of
86:48 - these and you can see here I am eating
86:50 - them all moving around and you know I as
86:53 - I eat them I should probably add new
86:55 - ones I've got a little bit of a
86:56 - performance issue because there's way
86:57 - too many of them you can see the scale
86:59 - I'm really kind of like zooming out on
87:01 - the world but this is the basic game
87:03 - mechanic so I'm going to stop here um in
87:05 - this particular video um I encourage you
87:08 - to take this tweak it improve it uh
87:11 - change the design of the blobs change
87:12 - the size of the world maybe as an
87:14 - exercise add the feature of when you eat
87:16 - a smaller blob a new one gets added
87:18 - somewhere else um and see what you can
87:20 - add to improve this and make this a
87:21 - little bit better I'm going to do two
87:23 - more videos this one video I'm just
87:25 - going to show you how to make this
87:26 - something that's a little bit Blobby so
87:28 - the vertices kind of undulate a little
87:30 - bit so it's not a perfect circle I'm
87:31 - going to do that in a separate video and
87:33 - then in a third part of this challenge
87:35 - eventually at some point I'm going to
87:37 - look at multiplayer networking with this
87:38 - so multiple people could sort of play
87:40 - against each other and consume each
87:42 - other in this kind of blob way um
87:45 - somebody also mentioned to me that in
87:46 - the actual game the blob doesn't eat it
87:48 - immediately maybe it has to envelop the
87:50 - whole thing or they squish against the
87:52 - each other a little bit so there's some
87:53 - some possible also like additional
87:56 - interesting features that I could think
87:57 - about adding at some point to this
87:58 - suggest those and let me know in the
87:59 - chat what I got wrong with this uh game
88:02 - um and also I'm going to have to do some
88:04 - work in the chat also been mention about
88:06 - optimizing this all these square root
88:07 - calculations are really slowing things
88:09 - down and there's some ways around that
88:10 - that I think I could ultimately um uh do
88:13 - to kind of optimize and make it perform
88:15 - a bit faster which I'll look at at some
88:16 - point as well okay so that is part one
88:19 - of agario game in P5 jazz coding
88:22 - challenge I'll see you in a future video
88:24 - goodbye thanks for
88:27 - watching okay
88:29 - everybody so
88:33 - um uh so I'm looking in the chat square
88:36 - root is not that slow just the amount
88:39 - array of Global Food as data cach blob
88:42 - split and fire oh you can split and fire
88:44 - stuff I haven't done that also the
88:46 - Border this is getting annoying so
88:48 - people giving lots of great suggestions
88:49 - in the chat okay so I think that I
88:53 - am finished for
88:56 - today I'm trying to see if I can hit the
88:58 - camera with the with the rainbow
88:59 - sweatbands ah it did hit the camera but
89:02 - I don't know if you saw that um so I
89:04 - encourage you to uh so I've got about
89:06 - five or 10 minutes before I have to move
89:09 - on to actually oh let me plug something
89:11 - I am here at the school for poetic
89:14 - computation uh they are running a 10we
89:16 - program whoops uh
89:19 - sfpc they are running a
89:22 - uh goodbye dance is being requested uh
89:26 - SF PCI is a school they are running uh a
89:29 - 10 we session now which is wrapping up
89:31 - this week I'm going to uh be helping
89:32 - some students with their projects or
89:34 - seeing some of their projects this
89:35 - afternoon which is why I need to go and
89:37 - I think if I go to
89:39 - attending. sfpc let's Google that uh two
89:43 - ah here we go uh we should be able to
89:46 - find uh SPC fspc summer 2016 student
89:52 - showcase it is happening us this
89:55 - Saturday and Sunday I believe um so I
90:00 - encourage you to uh find this and come
90:04 - and visit if you're in the New York City
90:06 - area come to the show see some
90:07 - interesting student projects
90:10 - um and
90:13 - um so so that I thought I would mention
90:16 - I'm trying to think of other things that
90:18 - I forgot to mention ah another thing
90:19 - that I will briefly plug is I recently
90:22 - uh some of you had asked about this I
90:23 - recently uh released a set of t-shirts
90:26 - unfortunately this is mostly only us
90:28 - shipping friendly I am looking I say
90:31 - this every time and I got to get to this
90:32 - but I I am looking into some uh other
90:35 - parts of the world shipping friendly
90:36 - t-shirt systems um this will ship
90:39 - outside of the US it just kind of can
90:40 - get expensive but um this uh t-shirt run
90:43 - has now closed however I am told that if
90:46 - you go here and put in your email when
90:50 - it gets to 40 they we'll do another run
90:52 - of the t-shirts and actually I have some
90:54 - friends that I wanted to buy T-shirts
90:56 - for um so I need this to get up a little
90:59 - bit higher so uh if but don't don't just
91:01 - put your email in here only if you're
91:02 - really interested I think uh put your
91:05 - email in here um to uh uh request that
91:10 - they do another run of the t-shirts if
91:11 - you're interested however the the kit
91:13 - sizes actually are always available they
91:16 - don't do they do those sort of print on
91:17 - demand this lovely company cotton Bureau
91:19 - so I think if I do SLK kids uh these the
91:22 - kids uh sizes and the uh onesies are all
91:27 - available um another thing that I there
91:30 - was something else that I wanted to
91:31 - mention ah yes so I recently had a Caden
91:34 - course uh called the nature of code a
91:36 - lot of similar content to what I do in
91:38 - my YouTube channel has forums and some
91:40 - assignments this course is now closed
91:43 - but it's it's going to run again um in
91:45 - what they what Cadenza calls adaptive
91:47 - mode so it ran where they released a
91:49 - session every week and people did it at
91:51 - the same time adaptive mode meaning you
91:52 - can just come in and come out of it at
91:53 - any time but Caden asked me to plug um I
91:58 - think it's class
92:00 - Central uh nature of code reviews so if
92:04 - you took the
92:06 - course uh and liked the course or didn't
92:08 - like the course you could write a bad
92:10 - review if you so want if you feel so
92:12 - inclined um you could go to this URL um
92:15 - and I'll I'll post it in the description
92:16 - of this video or maybe Oliver can post
92:18 - it in the chat if if you can find it
92:20 - quickly um class central.com
92:23 - m3777 Caden dth the- nature of code um
92:28 - and you can write a review there so far
92:30 - there are 13 student reviews so if you
92:32 - if you feel so inclined to write a
92:33 - review there uh Caden would appreciate
92:35 - it I would appreciate it okay let's see
92:37 - if there are yeah I use Google as my
92:40 - default search am I not using it Daniel
92:42 - uh let's coding
92:44 - rainbow yeah that's my default
92:48 - search
92:50 - um okay okay uh use the smooth movement
92:53 - library for doing client and server
92:55 - stuff can you show your new GIF okay
92:57 - hold on
92:59 - gify coding
93:03 - rainbows coding with
93:07 - rainbows it's on hold on how do I find
93:09 - it uh
93:13 - shoot uh I I have it oops o I rang the
93:18 - bell uh shoot where's the gify URL for
93:22 - that it's funny like I don't have all my
93:24 - recent um because I switch to a
93:26 - different user I don't have all of my
93:28 - recent and I don't know why it doesn't
93:29 - show up on
93:32 - search it would be nice if it showed up
93:35 - on search uh here I wonder if it's not
93:37 - listed I I could just find it on Twitter
93:39 - because I posted it I don't know why I'm
93:41 - so one thing that I'm working on is very
93:44 - very soon there's a giy URL for this
93:47 - maybe somebody can find it I don't know
93:48 - why this isn't playing the browser this
93:51 - browser cannot support video playback
93:53 - that is
93:55 - insane save hold on what is going on
93:58 - with the world
94:01 - today wow that's crazy uh you'll have to
94:04 - enjoy this on your
94:06 - own I don't know what is going
94:08 - on uh with
94:13 - uh my let's try Safari just SEC for a
94:17 - second keep
94:20 - Chrome
94:22 - something is weird with this here we go
94:25 - okay so this th this is for your own
94:27 - enjoyment
94:29 - uh Gooding
94:33 - power this is my goodbye dance oh I need
94:36 - the Sweat Band back
94:40 - now anyway um
94:43 - so so this is
94:45 - random anyway I'm gonna say goodbye this
94:47 - uh this is a sneak preview uh Adam Blau
94:50 - who is a h composer who out of Los
94:52 - Angeles who writes for television and
94:53 - film amongst other things has composed a
94:56 - wonderful uh coding Rainbow theme song A
94:58 - friend of mine from college is is the
95:01 - singer on the theme song I got a a
95:03 - preview version of it I I shot some
95:04 - green screen footage to create a little
95:06 - promo video that a bunch of people are
95:09 - helping me with so that will be released
95:10 - at some point soon in case you're
95:14 - interested uh okay um so um Akash asks
95:20 - what are some up topics good question uh
95:24 - you can kind of the two places you can
95:26 - find out about topics are in the rainbow
95:29 - topics GitHub repository uh if you sort
95:32 - by thumbs up you can see this is kind of
95:34 - what I'm looking at I wanted um I'm
95:37 - really trying to get to machine learning
95:39 - topics it's going to take me a little
95:40 - while to get to it but there's other
95:41 - things listed here I wanted to do um
95:44 - traveling salesperson as an upcoming
95:46 - topic more stuff with the connect I
95:48 - already did phot taxis that'll be uh oh
95:50 - I want to do fluid simul that's coming
95:52 - up
95:54 - um and that's it now you guys are all
95:56 - talking
95:57 - about the so those are some of the um
96:00 - upcoming topics that are
96:02 - coming I hope um yeah I don't think I'm
96:05 - I don't think that my little weird
96:06 - dancing will break the internet but it
96:08 - would be fun if it
96:10 - did uh plug my class again okay so uh
96:15 - which one I don't know which one but I'm
96:17 - in starting in the
96:20 - fall these are upcoming topics in SE I
96:23 - should mention something about schedule
96:24 - for a second hold on I got to pause
96:28 - this so let me mention something about
96:30 - schedule because um I am actually going
96:33 - on a little bit of vacation for about 10
96:35 - days uh at the end of August starting
96:37 - August 12th um so next week is going to
96:40 - be my last live broadcast of the summer
96:42 - I'm planning on doing one on Thursday
96:44 - this week and one day next week I don't
96:45 - know what day yet um I have a big
96:48 - backlog of videos which is good so more
96:50 - releases will be coming out as I'm away
96:51 - on vacation um with the patreon for the
96:55 - patrons now that I'm doing this
96:57 - crowdfunding thing with that I'm sort of
96:59 - committed to four live streams per month
97:01 - and if you look at how many I've done in
97:03 - July and August I think I'm already at
97:04 - eight so I feel like I've kind of gotten
97:06 - that but sort of my mental checkpoint to
97:08 - see if I'm kind of doing enough to Merit
97:10 - the crowdfunding um you guys can always
97:13 - let me know if you don't feel that I am
97:15 - uh obviously um but um so this Thursday
97:19 - I'll be doing a live stream next week
97:20 - I'll be doing a live stream and then
97:21 - I'll be away um and you know even though
97:24 - I'm only going away for about 10 days as
97:25 - soon as I get back is NYU orientation so
97:28 - I have this job that keeps me living
97:31 - here in New York City and um so that's
97:34 - going to really keep me busy for that
97:36 - last week of August as well so likely
97:38 - the live streams won't come back then
97:39 - until September um and in September I am
97:44 - going to focus my live streams on first
97:46 - of all getting this machine learning
97:47 - stuff going that I haven't been able to
97:49 - make happen this summer I might have
97:50 - make that start that next week but I
97:52 - will be teaching a class on uh
97:55 - JavaScript and text so topics are Markov
97:58 - chains data and apis regular Expressions
98:00 - context free grammars look at Chrome
98:03 - extensions Twitter Bots doing some
98:04 - server side programming all this stuff I
98:06 - will be making videos about all semester
98:08 - long and um if you want to sort of
98:11 - follow along with the assignments and
98:12 - discuss assignments with me you can also
98:14 - subscribe to the patreon and there'll be
98:17 - a slack Channel where I'll discuss that
98:19 - um so boy uh David by the way in the
98:23 - chat in the chat suggest a new challenge
98:24 - Boyds so that would be great I have a
98:26 - lot of video material about flocking and
98:28 - boids already if you look through the
98:29 - nature of code playlists but I I could
98:31 - it'd be interesting to do it as a coding
98:32 - challenge where I program it from
98:34 - scratch um so that's kind of in the
98:37 - hopper for the fall and stay tuned to my
98:40 - Twitter or my email mailing list where I
98:42 - will announce kind of the schedule and
98:44 - once the fall Hits I'm teaching on
98:47 - Tuesdays and Thursdays my class at NYU
98:50 - and I so probably Mondays or Fridays
98:52 - will be my live I'll probably have a
98:53 - consistent once per week live stream so
98:56 - that's kind of my plan for the fall and
98:58 - also I'm starting in the fall I wanted
99:00 - to make this happen in the summer but it
99:02 - seems unrealistic at this point I'm
99:03 - going to start having guests so those
99:05 - viewers I'm going to uh if you want to
99:07 - submit a work a project that you're
99:09 - doing I will show you a project and you
99:10 - can even Skype in if you want and then I
99:12 - also have some uh get people who will
99:15 - come in and do quick guest tutorials I
99:17 - wanted to make that happen this summer
99:18 - so I could release those while I'm away
99:20 - but it it's hard to sort of pin people
99:21 - down it's mostly my fault but I haven't
99:23 - gotten it together so that's also on the
99:25 - horizon for the fall uh and so a lot of
99:28 - things like some Manuel in the chat
99:29 - asked about processing. py python
99:31 - processing um that will
99:36 - um um that will um be something that I
99:39 - might have like a guest come and do
99:41 - because I'm not I don't really do Python
99:42 - Programming but I know people who do and
99:44 - they could come in and do a guest
99:45 - tutorial about
99:47 - that uh okay so that is I think think
99:51 - all I have to say as the song Winds down
99:55 - as I say goodbye this was a 1 hour and
99:58 - 45 minute about live stream we did I did
100:01 - two coding challenges to sum up floppy
100:03 - birds and stage one part one of agario
100:07 - so uh Andrew bone asked what are your
100:09 - thoughts on web components I'm going to
100:11 - have to get back to you on that one that
100:13 - seems like a complex question I'm kind
100:15 - of just a dabbler a Sketcher a playing
100:17 - arounder so I'm not really a
100:19 - professional web developer type person
100:21 - who has serious strict thoughts about
100:23 - how to do things um thanks for tuning in
100:26 - U please subscribe on YouTube Share um
100:30 - you know um trying to make this a
100:32 - sustainable kind of operation so more
100:34 - viewers uh is a um um is
100:38 - great
100:43 - um goodbye okay so that's the end of the
100:46 - song that was coding rainbow episode 55
100:50 - see you on Thursday this week it will
100:52 - probably also be in the morning stay
100:53 - tuned to Twitter and the email list for
100:55 - an announcement about the precise
100:57 - timing goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

I have some uh rainbow sweatbands the problem is there's Green in this so I think you're seeing this like invisible stripe with the computer behind me but if I switch to over here you can see what this actually looks like oh the light's not on over here okay I don't think I can I don't know if I can manage to get myself to actually wear this uh welcome good morning this is coding rainbow my name is Dan uh it is uh Tuesday August 2nd welcome to August I am live from the school for poetic computation in New York City I'm going to be here for approximately 1 hour and a half I got about a 20 minute late start here so the time is going to be a little bit short today but I will be also be back on Thursday so this week the live streams will be today and this coming Thursday I have a bell just getting new things for this uh thing called cating rainbow I have some stickers and I know if you can see these can you see these where's my like hey camera 4 oh there is no camera 4 where's the director there's nobody else here but me who can like do a tight shot of these stickers uh I can talk about where you can get these stickers if you want in a little bit um I want to kind of get started uh today as quickly as possible with a coding Challenge and uh the coding challenge that has been requested uh and Thumbs Up by a bunch of people is um is uh uh Flappy Bird so I am going to uh something that surprised me that's actually become a little popular one my most watched video on YouTube is a coding challenge where I programmed from scratch the snake game good oldfashioned snake game uh in JavaScript so I think I'm going to do a Flappy Bird game today and actually I have a ulterior motive for doing Flappy Bird today which is that I am leading towards eventually it's taking me a lot longer to get to this um some machine machine learning videos and what I want to do is have a machine Learning System that analyzes the current pixels it just sort of looks uh almost as if like a camera pointed at the screen uh and then knows when to press the space bar to make the bird kind of go up versus go down so uh if we have this example of a kind of a a simple interaction a one button game of playing Flappy Bird we can look at a machine learning algorithm to play it automatically and uh again you know the point of this channel is not that you will then go and have your own machine learning algorithm playing Flappy Bird but you will take some of these Concepts and realize them in new creative and exciting beautiful ways um so uh let me see what else just I can briefly tell you if you are new um if you would uh so the if you're looking for more of this stuff uh you can go to everything that you need H everything that you might need related to this coding rainbow channel is here at coding rainbow.com uh you I encourage you to uh press sub subscribe uh you can you're also welcome to uh participate in a coding rainbow slack channel uh by becoming a patron on a crowdfunding site called patreon and if you would like to find out when I do these live streams I send out email announcements and you can also scroll down and put your email in here okay that's all I'm going to say intro wise today uh and I'm just going to kind of get started already so there's a chat going I assume everybody can kind of see and hear me okay in the chat you can see I don't know if you can see my new stickers here there's green on the stickers so I don't know if it shows through uh and we're just going to kind of get started here let's go to with the one thing I wanted to show you which is there is also a uh GitHub repository uh oh yeah uses my hand to see if it SE through yes that actually won't work I I recognized that Oliver how absurd that was that I just did that um okay uh there is also this GitHub repository coding rainbowrainbow topics this is where you can suggest a topic it's kind of like exploding I I make a lot of videos each week and I'm kind of churning stuff out at the same time I cannot possibly keep up with this list um but it is uh here and you can see four minutes ago Cube Helix visualizer what is that whoa I made a cube Helix visualizer based on this it'll be interesting how you would tackle it perhaps with actual 3D instead of fake 3D a little bit afraid to click on this let's click on this this is from joerger if I pronounce that correctly whoa that is quite nice uh and there looks like there's some sliders here oo this is quite nice uh anyway you guys can find this on your own and look at it more later I would love to take this on as a challenge uh something I also do often is I go here to sort and I sort by a thumbs up and you can see what's kind of uh rising to the top here machine learning uh which I'm trying to get to computer vision I've done a bunch of genetic algorithms I actually finished all the genetic algorithms videos although I still want to do um traveling salesperson problem with a genetic algorithm so I will get to that um and all of that stuff so um let me mention actually because something that's I think happened is that most of the people who most of you the viewers who have found this channel already know something about programming uh most of you who are supporting and participating in this GitHub uh reposit who supporting on patreon or subscribed or contributing this GitHub repository already know about programming but it has come up I one of the reasons for this channel is not to do Advanced tutorials about programming my goal is to have a wide range of tutorials from complete and total beginner to medium to intermediate to more intermediate but I want everything to be friendly and accessible but obviously different tutorials that I make you kind of kind of have uh you've got to come with some knowledge or with no knowledge so I just want to point out for you guys to help share with the world that and I think I could do a probably a better job of organizing this but if I go to my channel here uh I want you to uh right now I guess I'm live right now does it say that I'm live I could watch myself live um that if uh uh right here this right here these playlists playlist 1 through six foundations of programming in JavaScript these this playlist is for complete and total beginners you don't have to know anything whatsoever so that is someplace you could get started and then find your way to some of these more intermediate topics that I'm doing and then there also if I scroll down here these tutorials now these are quite old I made these uh probably four or five years ago but the learning processing are also beginner tutorials the difference is learning processing uses a programming environment called processing and the the um the other one one through six foundations of programming in JavaScript uses something called p5js you know we could be here forever talking about why you might pick one or the other I suppose this might make a little more sense in that I made them more recently but um you can kind of choose and and and that sort of thing so um uh the wgb Bros uh mentions in the chat um uh JS is client side maybe you want to do some things server side it's funny you should mention that I am planning this fall to do more uh node.js server side programming tutorials I have done some already the two playlists that I have about servers side programming one is for making Twitter boot using node and another is a tutorial for making a shared drawing canvas using something called websockets both of those require service side programming and both of those tutorial playlists you can find them uh kind of give you some beginner uh getting started information about node however this fall something I will mention that I'm planning to do uh uh shiftman GitHub ah I teach a course at ITP uh which is a a master's program at New York University called programming from A to Z you can see this is the website for last year there will be a new one for 2016 and this uh this course is all about programming with text based data in JavaScript making poetry machines reading massive like tones of text and like generating new text out of them using Markov chains and grammars and hoping to actually insert some machine learning into this course but one of the things that I'm going to do this fall is do more server side programming with this because there's a lot of uh good and interesting uh text analysis node packages you know typically a lot of this material you might find um in Python libraries but as I'm kind of doing stuff for the web and the browser side I'm using JavaScript so this is coming this fall all the videos for this course will be free in online but if you want to participate in a uh an online channel to discuss assignments and Share work um that's my slack messaging me right now I'm going to turn the sound off here uh you can uh uh support um you can sign up for the uh crowdfunding patreon okay so uh that's what I want to say I've got my soundboard working with some music in case it gets too hot in here I have a sweatband sweat a headband we're going to do a coding challenge I got to put put these on get ready for the coding challenge I have a watch on will this go over my watch I think I'm going to do this in JavaScript but oh no wrong sound effect very important when programming JavaScript not to forget the okay uh uh cannot post links some of you in the chat can post links um uh okay so here we go the problem is the green right is a little bit weird that I have this like slice invisible slice in the middle of my head okay um now let's get started because we don't have a lot of time I only have a little over an hour left and I want to get started here okay so flappy birds let's look up some information here let's get going here Flappy Bird Bird play Flappy Bird let's look at that let's look at Flappy Bird on Wikipedia okay so flappy bird you may or may not be familiar with Flappy Bird let's take a look will this actually let me play it oh look at that it kind of goes up and down oops look at this like ridiculous like advertising now okay it's GNA make me watch a message from the sponsor um Flappy Bird is a really simple game uh it was quite popular um and uh it was built in 2013 By Vietnamese artist and programmer dong win did I pronounce that correctly any of you who know uh I I I sort of had this memory of it being released and then it was like so popular and it was taken down now everyone's making Flappy Bird clones um I I think as an interesting exercise here I'm going to try to program this game from scratch I kind of wanted to just play it for a second let's go to continue boy this was a terrible this is this website is no good at all it's just only advertisements can I click on this this is like ridiculous uh uh let's look let's look let's let's look for uh Flappy Bird um JavaScript whatever I'm just G to make it I think I have a sense of it is there like a little animation I know what we can do uh Flappy bird YouTube let's watch a little video of it uh uh okay here we go so let's let's forget this advertisement for a second come on can I not skip this ad this going to make me watch a full 30 second ad here what's wrong with this YouTube ad stuff okay I just wanted to get a visual reference of the game play to help me as I start to program it I I don't know that I've ever actually played Flappy Bird I'm culturally aware of it and I've definitely seen it uh okay here we go let's see there we go okay so you can see the idea here there's a bird it falls um the the bird flies every time you tap a force push pushes that bird up and the idea is you want to get it through these like pipe things oh this is so this is like isn't it sort of beautiful I think these one button games are so beautiful the sort of like addictive like crazy quality to it I can see myself having a serious problem with this game okay so um let's get ourselves going here I'm going to open up Adam is the my sort of preferred text editor of the day oh somebody mentioned to me on Twitter like a an Adam package with live reload and a web server does anybody um does anybody I forget it I'm going to do it my own old fat somebody in the chat I don't want to waste time here let's open up terminal uh uh desktop give you guys some music here so this is random this is noise pearly noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between 0 and 10 9 2 7 6 1 9 4 8 9 tax I did recently apparently but with pearing noise I might pick numbers like this 2 three 4 3 four five 6 5 4 7 5 six 7 five 6 S 8 N9 876 look this is like pearlin noise performance heart 2 4 2 1 2 4 3 four 5 6 let's make a like PE noise perform birs file and a pipe. JS file but with curly noise I might pick numbers like this I'm just getting set up I'm not going to I'm going to all the I'm going to write all the code live in the tutorial this is that is that is noise so this ising noise that is noise no that is so this ising noise that is what is this craziness what is this craziness idea what this is some strange new notification on like but with pearing noise I might pick numbers like this oh something's going on with the beauy I hope my Adam isn't broken 4 four five six how do I get pear noise performance art is there a okay hold on let me at least see if this is working is the um is the uh oh sorry everybody is the background noise uh too loud compared to my voice I will I will fix that if that's the case that was a package error it's a bug I know I I don't mind ignoring it oh the file could be readon I don't uh let's go to here uh yeah close oh camera went off H I might switch to using Sublime if this is going to if this is going to cause me a problem uh I'll have to look into this later let me just try restarting Adam no all right um uh make sure yeah everything seems fine I'm just going to use Sublime to not worry about this very happy with Sublime Text as well I don't have my I don't have beautify and Sublime that's going to drive me crazy oh this is very sad how do I what's the uh what's the um key key code uh show the trace okay let's not let's not worry about is is this distracting that my head looks like it's going to fall off maybe that's a little bit better is that better okay all right everybody welcome to today's coding challenge we are going to recreate Flappy Bird in JavaScript in what I hope won't take very long I sort of feel like how long could it possibly take okay waits for supp okay let's see how's how we going here we've got 43 people watching thank you all for being here and here we go 45 F Looper okay everybody what's the over under on how long this is going to take me I'm guessing 20 minutes it's going to be longer it's probably GNA be 30 minutes yeah everybody place your bets now is that Bell a very harsh sound let's see no doesn't seem so bad I have a bell three days 25 minutes uh 30 minutes okay here we go everybody uh we're going to start here uh and I put a coding rainbow sticker on is this a waste of a sticker these stickers are kind of expensive 42 one guy made it in processing with 50 to 75 lines so arson arson says in the chat one guy made it in processing with 50 to 75 lines I'm not trying to do this with as little as few lines of code as possible in fact I'm probably going to overdo it there okay here we go let me uh cycle the camera I don't think I need the uh whiteboard I don't think I'm going to use the Whiteboard for this but just in case um nah forget it okay yeah uh okay you guys are all making excellent comments in the chat here we go I'm actually GNA put on a timer here oh Adam live server that's what it is uh uh okay uh hold on I'm looking at my phone this is the worst this is my worst live stream ever but I was getting some important messages and what I wanted to do is put on a stopwatch I have a timer thing that I put on the screen but I don't have time to do that okay stopwatch going hello and welcome to a new cing cing coding let's try this again hello and welcome to a coding rainbow coding challenge today's coding challenge I'm going to attempt to make uh a Flappy Bird clone which I admit is kind of like a bit of a cliche probably at this point I don't know how many people have made Flappy Bird clone tutorial whatevers on in the world but it was requested I think it'll be fun I'm going to give it a try I'm going to do it in JavaScript I'm going to try to do it fast but with time to explain and time to relax and and just enjoy myself and Hope hope you might enjoy watching this so um if you're not familiar with Flappy Bird then I would say pause this video go and familiarize yourself with it I actually don't think I've ever actually played it before but I am somewhat familiar with the gameplay we'll see how well I do I've got a live chat going on and you guys can uh tell me how I'm doing if you're watching this as a YouTube archive you won't be able to follow along live but that's fine okay so I'm using p5js which is a JavaScript framework has a function setup it has a function draw and so the only thing I've got so far in the browser is just a canvas that's 400 by 600 pixels and a black background on that canvas so the first thing that I want to do I actually have a a separate Javascript file called bird. JS and I'm actually going to make this a uh Constructor function and the bird all all the bird really needs is a y value right the bird moves up and down and it stays in one spot so I'm going to give this uh bird I'm going to start the bird off in the center of the window and I'm going to write also a function called show uh where I draw the bird and again I'm going to my design is going to be very poor so it's going to be up to you to take my code which will be linked in this description to make something more beautiful and interesting and riff off of this so I'm just going to say uh let's make a white circle and you know what let's give this bird an X position as well even though it will be fixed but let's just try uh 25 for right now and I'm going to uh never forget that this you always need this dot in JavaScript um so let's make this bird a circle and let's say in the main program now VAR bird and we're going to say bird equals new bird and bird. show so we should have something a little bit more interesting now ah there it is bird with divided by two you know it would probably make more sense if I want the bird to be in the middle to be height divided by two so let's fix that I'm going to say height divided by two I think the bird could be a little bit bigger and the bird could be a little bit more in on the screen so there we go this is the beginning of Flappy Bird now what happens to the bird without you doing anything the bird falls down so oops oops wrong window so I'm going to go here and I'm going to say this. update equals function and it would be good to have some sort of variable called gravity and gravity being the force that's pushing uh that bird down and let's say that that the gravity here is going to be one I also need a velocity right I need a velocity so gravity is the force that's causing the velocity of the bird to increase so I'm going to say this do velocity equals zero and now I'm going to say this.y changes by this do velocity and this do velocity changes by this dot gravity okay so now we have a function that's going to push that bird down so I'm going to go over here and I'm going to say uh also bird. update there we go bye bird it flew down now we should probably do something where the bird stops when it gets to the bottom of the window that makes sense so I'm going to go back to the bird and I'm going to say I'll just do this in the update function I could write a separate and I'm going to say if this doy is greater than height then um then I'm just going to uh keep the bird on the screen I'm going to say this.y equals height and I'm also going to uh set that velocity to zero so we can see here that bird stops I don't know if that's actually what happens in Flappy Bird but I just kind of want to do that anyway and you know what I'm going to do that also for the top of the window because ultimately I'm going to be able to push the bird up so let's do that for Less Than Zero uh now of course so okay so now what how does the game work I think it's a mobile game right you could tap your mobile device this is my mobile device so I'm going to as a tap I'm going to just use the space bar on my keyboard so in um p5js I can write a function called key pressed and I can check to see if the key is the space bar um and let me just make sure this is working uh I'm just going to console log something right now so I'm going to run this and you can see each time I press the space bar uh it says here in the console uh it prints out space so that works so what do I want to do I want to cause a force to cause that bird to go up so I'm going to say bird. up and so what's going to happen with this bird do up function uh what do I want to do I want instead of the Velocity being pushed down by gravity I want to say this do velocity minus equals I want it to go up or I could say plus equals but some minus amount now what if I just said minus this do gravity let's try that for a second just to see what happens come on wait oh you know what's a little bit annoying I have to oh I took off that console.log hold on let's say minus equals this.g gravity time 10 so nothing's working here and I have a kind of a a sneaking suspicion that I've done something totally wrong a bird dot up let's make sure this is happening uh uh I'm going to say print line uh this. velocity okay so you can see that's working so let's try to tune I think there's sort of an issue here we've got to sort of tune the numbers so let's make the gravity just for right now a lot less strong so it's not going so fast now you can see though that this isn't really um doing very much let's make a uh this do up Force let's call this lift uh and we'll say it's 10 so I'm going to say this stop velocity plus equal this. lift not left lift there we go so you can see there's there's sort of an element of tuning those numbers so now it doesn't really feel like it's falling fast enough but me pushing the space bar is kind of working now does it what happens if I hold down the space bar so that's good okay so that lift is too much let's make the gravity point six and let's keep the lift there but now I'm going to need to make the lift A Little Bit Stronger there we go so this so now I have I sort of have the game going the lift is a little bit too strong uh let's make it less strong so there's you know some things something that I could do is actually limit the top speed or also or also like give it some um something that I could also do is is add some like air resistance in general which I could say something like this do velocity times equal 0.9 so that actually like helps with things quite a bit because it's just there's some there's sort of like a limit to what the speed is so now I've got something that is a bit more kind of like reasonable to play here so you could spend your time tuning this even more but I think just like keeping the velocity keeping some like are resistance by always shrinking the velocity a little bit uh tuning how much the lift is versus the gravity those types of things you can kind of play around with okay so now we have the basic game mechanic here which is just a falling Circle and each time I press the space bar I can kind of like have it lift up a little bit now what do we need to add we need to add those pipe things that kind of come from the right of the screen I'm only at eight minutes by the way which is pretty good the pipes things that come from the right of the screen and you have to steer your way through let's see if we can do this so um let's think about this I'm going to also create a pipe object with a Constructor function and let's think about what is a pipe need so a pipe needs I would say it's going to extend from the top to somewhere in the middle of the screen and then somewhere further down to the bottom so I need um I'm going to say like a a value called top which is going to be some random amount between the top of the screen and the middle of the screen and let's say this do bottom is some random amount also between the middle of the screen and the bottom of the screen and the the pipe also needs an X position which is always going to start at the edge of the screen and then let's let's write a function called show where I draw the pipe as uh White fill white and I draw a rectangle at this.x comma zero all the way with a width of like let's say the width is 20 and let's actually make that a variable and uh this width and also uh the height then is this do top and then I need another rectangle which uh starts from the bottom minus how tall it is and let's make uh minus this.bottom and its height is this.bottom okay pause I'm going to do an edit Point here because I really think that using the white the Whiteboard would be useful so this is when I publish this coding challenge I'm actually going to edit this part out uh because I'm kind of thinking it in my head but I feel like uh showing it on the Whiteboard would be useful uh so let me just erase the Whiteboard real quick I should have obviously I should have done this before I started uh okay so now I need a marker do I have a good marker somewhere okay uh will this marker work I think so can you see that screen okay um so I'm actually going to now go back into the video and draw a quick diagram okay in case this isn't making sense to you let's actually let's actually do a quick diagram here uh what I'm trying to do is create something that looks like this so I need two random numbers this length is what I'm calling Top This length is what I'm calling bottom and then this length this this width is what I'm calling W so I first draw a rectangle from here here with this width with a height of top and then I draw a rectangle from here which is height minus bottom which is this point with this width and then the height of that rectangle is bottom so this is what I'm get and if these values are random I'll sometimes get stuff that looks like this Etc now I could be more thoughtful like right now the way that I'm doing it there's this you could never get something that looks like this so it probably would make a uh I could probably do something different where I pick like a random empty amount of space and and then I pick a random starting point for that empty amount of space that might be interesting to do we can make that as an improvement later but let's just stick with what I have right now which I think is good enough okay I'm back over here and let's just see now I need a function like this. update and all I want to do in this. update is say this.x minus equals uh some speed this. speeed so uh let's say uh this do speed is always going to be five I'm going to just so all all of these are always going to move to the left so let's look now here in sketch I'm going to create uh an array called pipes and what I'm going to do is say uh pipes. push a new pipe and then in draw I'm going to say uh for all of the pipes in the array yeah I also have a problem with this somebody in the chat saying where I could technically have a pipe with no space in it so all that stuff can be corrected later and I want to say show and I want to say update so let's run this now and see there we go oh that's moving quite fast so let's go back to the pipe and let's just make the speed one so we could see ah look we basically have Flappy Bird already and it's so easy to play so it's moving kind of slow now but of course I only have one so let's think about this what a couple things that I want to do one is I want to um I want to say something like if frame count I want to have a pipe every like so often modulus 40 equals z which means every 40 frames the modulus operator being the remainder of division so anytime a number is divisible by 40 with a remainder of zero is 0 40 80 120 160 Etc let's add a new pipe and let's see how this looks oh that's a lot of that's a lot of every 40 Fram is quite a few oh look at this oh I'm pretty good at this I need some like music to play along with this okay so that's no good obviously let's um let's make the pipes move a little bit faster twice as fast and let's uh let's say every 100 frames so obviously you can see um how uh the speed of the pipes how frequent they are and we can see basically I have the game right now now I've made a very easy version of the game to play uh it's not very hard but one thing that I haven't done is figure out when I need to actually you know this I'm I'm doing a great job here so let's actually add something that shows us when the circle hits the pipe or doesn't hit the pipe so and also by the way I should be getting rid of the pipes at some point so one thing I should do is I should I should say if pipes index I uh is finished and I can actually just say x is less than zero and you know what I'm going to write a function I'll write a function called off screen so if the pipe is off the screen I want to say pipes. spce uh i1 so splice is a function that deletes an element from the array so I want to know if the pipe went off the screen get rid of it I don't need it anymore now of course there's a little bit of an issue here which is one is there's no such thing as a function called off screen that's a function I have to write there's another issue here which is that when I'm deleting stuff out of the array I should go through the array backwards and I've covered that in other videos but basically the array slides the elements slide back and if I'm going forwards the element slide back while I'm going forward I could end up skipping things um so I'm just going to switch my Loop to saying uh greater than or equal to zero and I minus minus and then I'm going to if I run this right no function named offscreen so I have to go into the pipe and I have to write a function called this. offscreen is a function and this is very simple I can just say if thisx is less than W right because I want it to be all the way off so it's with that has to be all the way off uh return true uh else return false and now I know all of you watching this video are going to complain to me and just say but couldn't you just say return this.x is less than negative W because that evaluates the true or false yes I could do that but you know what sometimes I like to write my code this way I like it to be longwind did multiple Lin I love the way the curly brackets just Nest themselves so beautifully I love to say return true return false you can write your code a different way but yeah uh and now I sort of feel like I should change it but I'm not going to I'll do it later okay so coming back let's see now we should see o w is not defined so I have to say always forget to this stu okay uh now we should see now I can't really tell if this is working I can only assume this is working but if I do something I say like this oh pipes. length if I look at the length of that array it's two and it's always two so even though I'm adding more and more they're getting deleted okay so we can be pretty sure that that's working okay now let's see now we've got to do the exciting part here I mean this whole thing hopefully is somewhat exciting but we've really got to get the gameplay mechanic where you it's going to give some visual feedback if you hit one of those pipes so let's think about how we might write this ultimately here's where I'm I have this single bird that says bird. update bird. show and I'm also looping through all the pipes so one thing I could do I don't really need to do it this way but I'm G to uh I'm going to move this Loop first uh just so the bird comes after and I'm going to say uh here I'm going to say if pipes's index I hits the bird then do something I'm just going to say console.log hit so I need to have a function that determines if a pipe has hit the bird so if looking at this bit of code you can see here what do I need to write I need to write a function called hits and that function is going to be part of the pipe object and it's going to receive a bird object as an argument so I'm going to go to the pipe object I'm going to write I'm just going to write the function up there here this do hits I called it hits equals function bird and now I just need to check what do I need to check I need to check if bird doy is less than the top and bird or or bird doy is greater than height minus this.bottom so if the bird is is ever uh if if I come back here to my whiteboard if the bird is ever right less than top or greater than height minus bottom here then it's kind of it's it's hitting that it's hitting that pipe so let's come back over here did I get that right it's greater than okay so then I want to say uh a return true although this isn't good enough right it's also got to be within the actual exposition so we should also say and um I could I'm I could be much better about how I construct this but I'm going to inside here go so let's just say it's within that stuff also let's now check if bird dox its exp position is greater than uh this.x and and bird dox is less than this.x plus this.w so I'm also just checking if it's in between the actual exposition of the pipe so if all of that is true I'm going to return true you know I'm just working it out we could I could this double if statement is kind of an awful way to write this and I could probably be more clever and I could write a separate function that just tests intersection between a circle and a rectangle but right now this will be good enough for us right now and I I look forward to hearing your improvements and suggestions in the comments so let's just see here uh if whoops right now I'm not seeing anything hit hit ah so this is basically working you can see that any time oh this is going to be hard oh so let's actually give ourselves some visual feedback um if this is the case uh let's let's write a variable called highlight set it equal to false let's also say this. highlight equals true and then under fill under show I'm going to say if this. highlight I'm going to say fill uh to I'm going to make it red so let's just see if this gives us some nice visual feedback oh you know what I never said highlight equal to false so watch it hits it so you know that's fine but I might want to uh actually also say uh uh this do highlight equals false oh if it's not hitting it so now here we go it hit hits it you can see so now I could add like score I could be more careful about like I'm really only checking the center go go go go go go go who this is way too easy to play oh there we go okay so you get the idea so I I think that I've kind of completed this um there's a lot of improvements that I would want to make to this in terms of being more thoughtful about checking that intersection to be a bit more precise good enough though be a bit I could do a better job of picking the um the the way that uh oh here's a difficult one a better job of how I pick the top and bottom Heights of these rectangles um I could add score right you start with the score maybe as time goes on your score goes up every time you hit a pip the score goes down all those things I I I would say um ask me your questions in the comments uh suggest make versions of this and and tweet me your uh exciting you know you could make a nice Bird design you could reimagine this entire game to not be a bird in pipes but to be you know a flower in rainbows I don't know how that would work um so uh so um tweet me and share with me all of your uh interesting variations on this and I'll maybe come back and do some a Q&A video where I follow up on some of your questions and make some improvements to this Flappy Bird challenge okay thanks for watching and I will see you in a future coding challenge goodbye all right everyone my hands are detached uh so um uh the WG Bros makes a great suggestion in the chat make it find the nearest XY coordinates of the pipe to the circle and check if the distance is less than the radius of the bird yes uh was it 25 minutes yeah 20 I I see 23 minutes but there was like 30 seconds to a minute in there where I um uh I erase the Whiteboard that'll get edited out when I make a sort of edited version of this okay um how any questions any comments I forgot to hit the bell at the end that's the reason for this Bell um oops wrong buttoning power all right ah so uh Jack Napier in the chat asks does anybody know um how I changed the theme of P5 so I'm not actually using the P5 editor I'm using Sublime Text as an editor and just running a local server in the background um which I have a video actually that shows how to do that if you look for like Google on YouTube search on YouTube shiftman local server P5 or something you'll find it okay so um today I feel like the theme of today is game stuff I really picked the simple one to start with um a lot of I've had this request to do uh agar iio how do you say it agario agar.io I'm going to click play as a guest so this is also a very simple game where with this mouse I move a and is it always moving in the oops I lost um continue no play as guest uh let me just see here now so it's always moving exactly in the direction of the mouse uh uh and I guess the idea is that I I can eat the smaller things and if something that's bigger than me gets me then I die but if I get something that's if I get something that I'm bigger then I eat it and this is all multiplayer and networked and people have names and they're on teams and someone's oh oh we're just like punching each other here when we we to similar in size like how do I yeah so that one was big enough me to me so um so I don't I've actually never played this game till well I looked at it last night actually when I was thinking about things that I would do today so this doing this as a coding challenge presents a lot of complications one is to do the full multiplayer aspect of it I need quite an elaborate web server system using sockets and managing a list of players and you know some sort of scale you know terms of people connected to it um so I think I could do this in a multipart series maybe I should should do the traveling salesperson today aarion is that what it's called um um so I'm trying to think of what how to best use the time that I have left today I had this list let me look at my list you guys Talk Amongst yourself for a second uh okay um I'm looking for my list of topics that I had that I was thinking about oh yeah oh I forgot about the point sampling I'm afraid of this agario thing let me check the chat see what everybody saying you can also split yourself and fire things that are viruses interesting no n at the end okay um so I would be I think this is interesting the other thing I like about this is I like how these are kind of like a little bit Blobby and we can make them a little bit Blobby so um so let's keep with the theme of games today I did Flappy Bird and let's try to begin this agario thing I could always do Tetris there's no way I'm doing Tetris today so I don't I'm I'm only going to be here for about another half an hour or so um yeah I should make a way that you can launch sounds remotely um so let's um okay play my Flappy Bird game for a little bit I feeling a little tired a little sad uh okay trigger Frogger froger oo I love the idea of Frogger hold on Frogger classic uh so how do I do this oh how lovely this is probably much harder to do than you would think sorry I just got distracted by enjoying playing froger oh why do I oh I have to get on the things I forgot you know I I kind of want to do this but I want to think about this this is great somebody add this somebody add Frogger to uh oops somebody add Frogger to the uh rainbow topics uh GitHub and we're going to work I just all I need is for uh somebody to tell me how to pronounce agario and I'm to start doing that as the next coding challenge so let's go get Flappy Bird and uh AAR AAR IO yes ad all let's just make this okay and I'm gonna open this again in Sublime oh that's Adam I forgot that Adam wasn't working for me and we're going to close Floppy Bird and I'm going to make this an object I'm going to make this called blob and uh I'm gonna get rid of this and uh get rid of all this stuff uh that's the correct way to say it okay uh okay and setup draw I didn't eat a big enough breakfast today this is a problem uh and here it is okay great uh pipe is missing I don't need that this is blob let's give myself a slightly larger pixel space see if we can manage that I think that works console doesn't need to be so big um yeah I have been using um I have been using Adam the adom editor uh in most of my videos as a text editor but for some reason um I'm getting a weird error in it this morning and I don't feel like wasting time uh okay I uh so a lot of you are asking about Flappy Bird I just made made Flappy Bird so when the archive of the stream gets released you'll be able to watch that back and then there'll be an I actually there's one small edit point in it where I was like erasing the Whiteboard that'll also be published as a separate video uh actually you know what I uh okay um I'm sad to hear that the stream is not working for some of you I don't I don't have any um I don't have any um good advice for you guys about that okay so let's look up uh let me go here is is can I find a Wikipedia page for this uh yep okay matius Bala valadares uh okay so those of you who are having problems with the stream I wish I could uh do something about that right now but one thing I'll say is all of this is being recorded so at you know apologize that maybe it's not working so great for you live right now um but it will be published as an archive you'll be able to watch it later okay okay um right I guess I'm talking to the people who can't watch the stream as if they can hear me which is a bit of a problem okay okay getting ready for this oops power where's all my special effects special effects aren't happening right now okay so um let's recycle the camera I'm doing this in JavaScript okay here we go so oops no okay so I think this will be um the last coding challenge for today and then I'll hopefully have some time to take uh some questions at the end uh okay I like how people in the chat are asking what is happening why is he dancing clearly first time viewers uh hold on you might also be wondering why am I attaching stickers to myself there oh you can't really see that one that's another sticker okay here we go hello and welcome to another game coding challenge now this was suggested to me by a actually hold timeout let's find it start over all right start here I'm starting again hello everyone welcome to another coding challenge today's coding challenge is agario agar.io agario a game that I am was not familiar with until recently when little a on GitHub suggested this particular game I looked it up I played it for a few minutes uh it's a massively multi player game uh created by matus valadas I don't know if I'm um uh um pronouncing that correctly you could go to agar.io and play it yourself but basically you're this blob moving around the screen and you eat other blobs now here's the thing this is actually quite complex the simple mechanic I think it's going to be hopefully something easy that I can Implement in this short video but I'm going to do this in several stages and so part one is going I'm going to implement the basic game mechanic and in part two I will start to look at how you we might how I might use you might use websockets to create a multiplayer version of this game so this video is just going to be the basic game mechanic so I'm using the p5js framework I'm using the suime uh text editor I have a canvas and a black background that's all I'm starting with and I also I've created a separate oops darn ah oh pause or don't pause hold on uh yeah pause oh yeah hopefully I didn't mess up the Flappy Bird thing edit point back in sorry Mata um and I also have a Javascript file called blob. JS where I'm going to write a Constructor function to create this idea of a blob object The Blob object will serve to be both you the blob moving around the screen as well as other little blobs that you are trying to eat so what is this blob need now I'm going to use Vector objects which are something that exists in P5 a vector being an object that stores an X and A Y component for a position on the screen and lots of other things that we could do with that so I'm going to say this. pause equals create Victor Vector Victor what's your Victor Vector uh width divided by two height divided by two and then I'm going to write a function called show uh which actually since it's in this object I'm going to write this. show equals function and I'm going to say Phill 255 and I'm going to draw an ellipse at this.x this.y and I also I definitely need a variable to keep track of the radius the size of this blob let's just make it 32 or 64 to start with so then the size of the ellipse is the radius times two and the height is the radius times two so now if I go to sketch I can just say VAR blob blob equals new blob blob. show so let's just see where's the blob oh something's going terribly wrong pause oh don't pause or pause I'm kind of being silly here where I forgot the whole point of this was I made a vector called pause for position and then I tried to draw it at this.x which doesn't exist so this.x this. p.y there we go so there we are in the window now this is something a little bit crazy as I just realized as part of this game so I want to move around the space so the but the thing is I don't in the game this blob that you're seeing on the screen right here moves but visually it stays the same and rather the world shifts relative to it so we've got to kind of figure that out so I'm going to do something else here I think to help us where I'm going to make an array called blobs Bo I need some better variable names uh blobs can be just an empty array and by the way I think that I should give the blob a variable in the Constructor so I can actually say how big to make it so I want this blob to be 64 and now I want to say uh VAR I equals z i is less than I'm going to add 10 smaller blobs blob's index I equals new blob which will be smaller all these blobs are going to be 16 and then now I can have a loop in the draw Loop where uh I call show on all of those now look at that they're all in the center that's a bit of a problem so how about we also something we could do is in this blob object I could also give it an X and A Y and then I could say here I want this blob to be this blob to be in the middle and I want these blobs to be at a random location and then the blob is made with that X and Y there we go so this is where we're starting we have this idea of one blob that is me I am the blob and then lots of other little blobs that are food that I want to eat so now the way that the agario works is the blob moves in the direction of the mouse so let's see if we can figure out how to make that happen okay so what I want to do is add a function called update and let's think about how this camera went off let's think about um I have some old Flappy Bird diagram here that I'm going to erase let's think about how this actually works so here is the blob and here's the mouse what I want is I need to create a vector an arrow that points from The Blob towards the mouse and I want that to be the direction that it moves so this is actually quite easy to do because coming back over here if I know this position and I know this position if I take this position minus this position I get a vector that points from here to there so I can actually use coming back over here I can say mouse equals create Vector Mouse X Mouse Y and then I could say mouse. subtract uh this. position and then I can just say uh I could say mouse do uh set magnitude to like three set magnitude just takes that Vector however long it might be and sets it to a specific magnitude and then I could say this. pause add ex what am I doing this do pod add Mouse so really th this is how I'm calculating the velocity and oops we got some errors here blob. JS line 5 this. update equals function oh and you know what would help if I called this. update if I called blob. update Mouse is not defined and oops I'm calling it velocity now so you can see how that blob is now following the mouse here's the thing though it's moving and not the other stuff so I want the my view of the world to be relative to this particular object so how do we do that H I have an idea what if instead of what if okay okay okay I'm gonna use the translate function let me come back over here this is where the object is and this is where the origin is z z but let's say the object moves over here what if I move the origin over to here then we should see it still wait wait no no I need to move the origin the other way if I move the origin over here right it would be kind of here which would appear back in the center of our screen I I kind of got lost in my own thoughts there basically what I want to do is it's moving over here but I want to shift the view to be over there and the view of where we're seeing everything is kind of like where is the origin point in our canvas and translate is a function that shifts the origin so what if I just said right here translate by blob. position. X blob. position. Y negative now I think this is going to be a little bit off and you'll see why in a second it's working but the blob is at the top left so really what I want to do is translate by the center because that's really where I want to have the view minus that and now we can see as I move the mouse around the blob is that always stays in the center but these other things move am I doing this right guys tell me in the chat if this is kind of the right idea it's not right look is it yeah move this way move this way move up move down move this way move this way move this way move this way it is uh it's just sort of sort of strange to see let's add a lot more of these it feels like I'm steering it incorrectly okay people are saying it's right feels a little off to me but okay the other thing about okay the other thing that's a little bit crazy here is that what what's happening now why does it do that and pause smoothing dampening for the controls yeah it needs that hold on I'm thinking for a second yeah making a full screen would certainly help um why is it oh I know the problem and we're back so I forgot something as soon as I started moving it around I forgot that the this actual velocity is being tracked relative to the object's position which now is off somewhere and that it's actually The Mouse and the position in the same place and all sorts of I actually what I want now is I need to subtract just the center of the window so I can actually just create a vector like this I don't want to actually any more subtract the actual position of the object because the position object is relative to the world but the user's interaction is always relative to the center of the window and so that's what that's what was messing things up so now you can see um this work works well now there's another sort of issue here which is that the world should really be much bigger than what I'm seeing actually the width of the the canvas itself and in that sense we can kind of do that really rather easily by saying um uh let's pick a random X between like negative width and width divided times two and let's pick a y between negative height and height times two just so we have kind of like a larger space for the blobs to live in and so now you can see that as I move around there's a much kind of larger world uh of of things for me to eat potentially okay so I think we're moving along here we've got the basic gist of the game okay um now I need to add one more thing here which is that if I eat one of these if I find one of these other pieces of blob things and eat it then I get a little bit bigger I think that's something that happens in the game so one thing that I need to do is When We're looping through all of these blobs uh we should check function oh yeah if blob beats blobs index I then blob grows and actually what I want to do is uh remove that blob so blob index I.S splice 0 comma 1 I find myself saying this a lot these days I also want to Loop through the array backwards because I just said this in another video I made but uh if I'm removing things from the array as I'm going forward through the array the the elements SL backwards and I could Skip One by accident so it's good to Loop through the array backwards uh so let's see I want to check if the blob eats one of those other blobs then I want to remove one of those other blobs from the array and how do I determine if it eats it the way that I do that is by writing a function eats which receives another blob I'll call other and I need to check something I need to know what is the distance between this blob's x you know what and actually there is a P5 Vector distance function so I'm going to say what is the distance between this blob's position and the other blob's position and if that distance is less than this blob's radius plus the other blob's radius then we've eaten it why is that true oops I hit the wrong button uh right if I have two objects and I check their distance relative to the sum of the two radiuses radi if they're overlapping that sum that distance going to is going to be less than it if they're not overlapping that distance is going to be greater than that sum so coming back over here we can now say if it eats it then I can also let's say this do R gets bigger gets bigger by the other's radius and also return true otherwise otherwise return false and come over here to the blob come over here back to the main program and I think that's basically it so let's see how that works oops invalid left hand side in assignment un sketch. 21 uh what's oh I equals blobs length minus one okay so we should see here oop blobs indexi dos splice is not a function okay of course what am I doing here this is absolutely incorrect I don't know what I haven't eaten breakfast this morning clearly I'm kind of struggling here for my energy I want to splice out of the array at index I one element which means remove index one element starting at index I I don't know what I was writing before was completely wrong uh blobs splice refresh here come on eat there we go eat eat eat okay so it's getting quite a bit too big just from eating a blob so let's let's divide that let's multiply that by like 0 2 and we can see there we go and I think that what might be um okay so okay I'm going to pause for a second all right people are telling me some things um people are telling me in the game they don't eat it immediately when they touch so when um uh so guys give me some corrections here so um they don't eat each other immediately when they touch that's fixable um the other thing that I feel like some dampening would help right it seems like I'm let's go to the actual game is there dampening in the game no feels the same it's just your kind of smaller oh yeah it kind of adjusts there's a little bit of an interpolating okay so let's do a little bit of an interpolating to the velocity um I should scale everything else uh the screen zooms out instead of The Blob size increase really oh blob size stays the same does that really is that really how it works that's interesting okay oh that's cool ah so we use scale interesting okay okay global scale okay so that I can fix too okay I'm going to come back I'm going to do two things you shouldn't add the rate by calculate both blob's areas add them and get back the radius okay you increase the size but the zoom out cancels it somewhat okay okay calculate the blob areas add them that makes sense that makes sense area is pi r s right okay okay so I'm going to return here okay I'm back uh the chat gave me some nice helpful suggestions a couple things about how the game actually works one is uh increasing the blob's radius is not actually how the game works and this is actually a great thing that you should learn about if you're not familiar with because we often think of The Blob a circle size as its radius but that's not really its size the size that we're seeing is its um surface area the area which is calculated uh pi r squared so let's look at that so let's actually let's fix that for a second so um I'm going to make a variable called sum which is equal to Pi * this. R * this R plus pi time other R time other R so that is the sum of the two uh areas of of The Blob that's eating the smaller blob now the new radius should be the radius that's associated with that particular sum and how do I get that well um let's think about this really quick uh if the area equals p r 2 then R2 = area / Pi and R equals the square root of area divided Pi so I can just solve for r with that particular equation and I can come back to here ah no I'm getting I'm bad at my switching screen I can come back to here and I can say uh this. R equals the square root of that area uh what did I say oh no no that area divided by pi so let's take a look at that ah there we go that's such a more beautiful and elegant uh interaction now the other thing that I was told that actually happens with uh Gario is that instead of the um instead of you seeing your circle grow the actual view of the world kind of zooms out so while you're growing gr what you see is you stay the same size and the other circles kind of shrink and we can do that in P5 using the scale function so um in the same way that I used this translate function I could scale the World by um the blob's current radius divided by what it started with which is 64 so right if its radius is 64 then I'm scaling the word World by one so uh let's see how this works now the problem is this is causing everything to shift to the right which is not great so and um and by the way the radius is getting bigger so I wanted to do it the other way 64 divided by the blob's radius I wanted to shrink so this is working but everything is kind of Shifting up that's because I unfortunately am drawing everything relative to the top left so really what I want to do is I need to change the whole view of everything for the blob to start at 0 0 which is better anyway so I want the blob to start at 0 0 Let's go back to the main sketch I want me the blob to start at Z 0 and the other blobs can just go from negative width to positive width um negative height to positive height that should work I kind of had that weird before anyway and then the world is actually just drawn relative to negative the blob's position so I'm always doing everything relative to that particular blob which starts at z z that's going to make things much better oops um wait wait wait width divided by two plus wait I did this wrong whoa uh minus yeah there we go wait something is still off time out scale first then translate thank you no wait wait wait hold on let me think about this uh okay I want to first thing I want to do is translate to the center everything okay look I want to translate to the center this should make the blob okay that's what I want right so it's working correctly then I need to scale then I need to tr offset do the offset from the blob's location I think this is right now yeah yeah okay okay hold on let's go back because I think this is g to get edited out I got to edit this back okay the figuring out is probably good I should keep that okay there's a there's a kind of an issue going on here so um let me think about this let me get this right here for a second I want I've done this twice now but hopefully you're seeing an edited version of this now um so the problem is actually that the first thing that I need to do is translate to the center so let's not do anything just right now but translate to the center so now you can see this is where the blob moves freely around and it should be growing as it eats other blobs now what I want to do is uh I wanted to I want to scale it I wanted to scale it by its relative size relative its size relative to its original size so you can see the world is kind of shrinking rather than the blob growing but now that I have that I need to do the scale before I trans I offset the whole world then by negative the blob's X position negative the blob's Y position so now if I do it in that order you're going to oh whoa whoa whoa whoa I need a comma there now we can see we have the world uh doing what we I originally hoped and intended it to do so um so okay so now you can see that things are very kind of Herky jerky here um and that's because everything happens instantly the scale changes instantly The View changes instantly and it could be nice to have things massaged a little bit smoothed a little bit and a way to do that is with a function called in P5 called lurp which stands for linear interpolation instead of taking a value and setting it directly to the new value just want to kind of move slowly towards that new value and so let's let's do that with scale um so the new scale is 64 divided blob. R but I need a variable I'm going to call I don't want to call it scale because there's a P5 function called scale so I'm actually going to call it Zoom so Zoom I'm going to start Zoom equal to one and zoom should always be the lurp between the a value in between itself and what the new Zoom is and now the last argument of this lurp function I have a whole video about lurp you can find that video uh if I make it like 0.1 let's see what happens oh wa wait hold on hold on hold on hold on .9 oh wait wait wait I got to actually put it in there sorry everybody I got to actually use the variable I created so what I want is I want it to be just a little bit 10% of the new value so that I interpolate towards it and can you see that happening kind of smoothly let me um so one thing I want to do uh just to make this more obvious is I'm gonna just make it uh 10 times that amount whoops oh okay wait hold on hold on I think I had it Opposite I think this should be 0. n no hold on pause it's just such a subtle change that I'm not seeing it I think I did it right though um hold on why is it if I just multiply it by two it's so much more let's do um just temporarily let's do this okay so that's growing really fast and so I had it wrong no comment out the blob's radius new zoom zoom equals lurp to the new Zoom make 0.1 smaller yeah I know okay hold on let's let me just test something here lurp X comma y .01 yeah 100.5 so that is the the distance like I'm I'm going 1% from X to Y and I want to go 1% from the zoom Zoom to the new zoom and zoom starts at one and this the scale is slower than the lurp so this in my view this should work oh oh it is actually working I'm just not seeing it because the lurp is I'm just yeah you can see it there this is what I was trying to show you it was working all along I just kind of was like not looking at it correctly that's what I said yeah you all are giving me the corrections okay okay okay hold on how am I on time what time is it everybody 1215 so I've got to wrap this up okay got to finish this video I'm going to do this with the velocity as well um okay uh okay here we go okay um okay hi everybody okay I don't know mat you're gonna have to edit this somehow I don't know it'll be awkward but it's fine okay back for a second let's take a look actually forget it I'm not going to say back for a second this'll just be a weird edit Point Let's adjust the way the radius is growing to try to get a better look at this so I'm going to change the radius I'm going to take away that uh the using the surface area and just actually add the two radi together um and then now we should be able to see and and by the way there's so many it's actually I shouldn't allow any of the it also like it just eats a lot of blobs immediately so let me start with quite a few fewer just 10 and so now we can see what happens as I eat a blob it gets really big immediately but then the View kind of slowly interpolates and shrinks so you can obviously tune these numbers a little bit better but I'm going to go back now to the surface area and sort of see and I think I want to add one more interpolation here which is just to interpolate its velocity so that it doesn't immediately get the new velocity but rather kind of smoothly turns a little bit as you move the El around I don't know that agario is actually doing that but I think that might be an interesting thing to add so I'm going to add that here uh in the blob object I'm going to say I'm going to give it a velocity I'm going to give it a variable velocity create Vector uh uh and it's going to be empty 0 0 to start and then this is going to be its new velocity and its new velocity has a magnitude of three and its velocity I'm going to lurp to the new velocity by 0.1 so let's just see how that works uh is not defined and of course I forgot no I either this dot uh blob. 10 uh and this needs this dot velocity so you can see it's kind of the Turning is a little bit more interpolated now is a little bit smoother is it still going in the right direction right so you could play with that number quite a bit like if I made this number you know 0.01 its turning is going to be quite slow if I made that number 0.9 it's going to be as if it turns instantly so I'm going to just like use point two and you can see now there's a it's a little bit smoother now let's add let's go back to the original sketch and let's add a whole bunch of these and you can see here I am eating them all moving around and you know I as I eat them I should probably add new ones I've got a little bit of a performance issue because there's way too many of them you can see the scale I'm really kind of like zooming out on the world but this is the basic game mechanic so I'm going to stop here um in this particular video um I encourage you to take this tweak it improve it uh change the design of the blobs change the size of the world maybe as an exercise add the feature of when you eat a smaller blob a new one gets added somewhere else um and see what you can add to improve this and make this a little bit better I'm going to do two more videos this one video I'm just going to show you how to make this something that's a little bit Blobby so the vertices kind of undulate a little bit so it's not a perfect circle I'm going to do that in a separate video and then in a third part of this challenge eventually at some point I'm going to look at multiplayer networking with this so multiple people could sort of play against each other and consume each other in this kind of blob way um somebody also mentioned to me that in the actual game the blob doesn't eat it immediately maybe it has to envelop the whole thing or they squish against the each other a little bit so there's some some possible also like additional interesting features that I could think about adding at some point to this suggest those and let me know in the chat what I got wrong with this uh game um and also I'm going to have to do some work in the chat also been mention about optimizing this all these square root calculations are really slowing things down and there's some ways around that that I think I could ultimately um uh do to kind of optimize and make it perform a bit faster which I'll look at at some point as well okay so that is part one of agario game in P5 jazz coding challenge I'll see you in a future video goodbye thanks for watching okay everybody so um uh so I'm looking in the chat square root is not that slow just the amount array of Global Food as data cach blob split and fire oh you can split and fire stuff I haven't done that also the Border this is getting annoying so people giving lots of great suggestions in the chat okay so I think that I am finished for today I'm trying to see if I can hit the camera with the with the rainbow sweatbands ah it did hit the camera but I don't know if you saw that um so I encourage you to uh so I've got about five or 10 minutes before I have to move on to actually oh let me plug something I am here at the school for poetic computation uh they are running a 10we program whoops uh sfpc they are running a uh goodbye dance is being requested uh SF PCI is a school they are running uh a 10 we session now which is wrapping up this week I'm going to uh be helping some students with their projects or seeing some of their projects this afternoon which is why I need to go and I think if I go to attending. sfpc let's Google that uh two ah here we go uh we should be able to find uh SPC fspc summer 2016 student showcase it is happening us this Saturday and Sunday I believe um so I encourage you to uh find this and come and visit if you're in the New York City area come to the show see some interesting student projects um and um so so that I thought I would mention I'm trying to think of other things that I forgot to mention ah another thing that I will briefly plug is I recently uh some of you had asked about this I recently uh released a set of tshirts unfortunately this is mostly only us shipping friendly I am looking I say this every time and I got to get to this but I I am looking into some uh other parts of the world shipping friendly tshirt systems um this will ship outside of the US it just kind of can get expensive but um this uh tshirt run has now closed however I am told that if you go here and put in your email when it gets to 40 they we'll do another run of the tshirts and actually I have some friends that I wanted to buy Tshirts for um so I need this to get up a little bit higher so uh if but don't don't just put your email in here only if you're really interested I think uh put your email in here um to uh uh request that they do another run of the tshirts if you're interested however the the kit sizes actually are always available they don't do they do those sort of print on demand this lovely company cotton Bureau so I think if I do SLK kids uh these the kids uh sizes and the uh onesies are all available um another thing that I there was something else that I wanted to mention ah yes so I recently had a Caden course uh called the nature of code a lot of similar content to what I do in my YouTube channel has forums and some assignments this course is now closed but it's it's going to run again um in what they what Cadenza calls adaptive mode so it ran where they released a session every week and people did it at the same time adaptive mode meaning you can just come in and come out of it at any time but Caden asked me to plug um I think it's class Central uh nature of code reviews so if you took the course uh and liked the course or didn't like the course you could write a bad review if you so want if you feel so inclined um you could go to this URL um and I'll I'll post it in the description of this video or maybe Oliver can post it in the chat if if you can find it quickly um class central.com m3777 Caden dth the nature of code um and you can write a review there so far there are 13 student reviews so if you if you feel so inclined to write a review there uh Caden would appreciate it I would appreciate it okay let's see if there are yeah I use Google as my default search am I not using it Daniel uh let's coding rainbow yeah that's my default search um okay okay uh use the smooth movement library for doing client and server stuff can you show your new GIF okay hold on gify coding rainbows coding with rainbows it's on hold on how do I find it uh shoot uh I I have it oops o I rang the bell uh shoot where's the gify URL for that it's funny like I don't have all my recent um because I switch to a different user I don't have all of my recent and I don't know why it doesn't show up on search it would be nice if it showed up on search uh here I wonder if it's not listed I I could just find it on Twitter because I posted it I don't know why I'm so one thing that I'm working on is very very soon there's a giy URL for this maybe somebody can find it I don't know why this isn't playing the browser this browser cannot support video playback that is insane save hold on what is going on with the world today wow that's crazy uh you'll have to enjoy this on your own I don't know what is going on uh with uh my let's try Safari just SEC for a second keep Chrome something is weird with this here we go okay so this th this is for your own enjoyment uh Gooding power this is my goodbye dance oh I need the Sweat Band back now anyway um so so this is random anyway I'm gonna say goodbye this uh this is a sneak preview uh Adam Blau who is a h composer who out of Los Angeles who writes for television and film amongst other things has composed a wonderful uh coding Rainbow theme song A friend of mine from college is is the singer on the theme song I got a a preview version of it I I shot some green screen footage to create a little promo video that a bunch of people are helping me with so that will be released at some point soon in case you're interested uh okay um so um Akash asks what are some up topics good question uh you can kind of the two places you can find out about topics are in the rainbow topics GitHub repository uh if you sort by thumbs up you can see this is kind of what I'm looking at I wanted um I'm really trying to get to machine learning topics it's going to take me a little while to get to it but there's other things listed here I wanted to do um traveling salesperson as an upcoming topic more stuff with the connect I already did phot taxis that'll be uh oh I want to do fluid simul that's coming up um and that's it now you guys are all talking about the so those are some of the um upcoming topics that are coming I hope um yeah I don't think I'm I don't think that my little weird dancing will break the internet but it would be fun if it did uh plug my class again okay so uh which one I don't know which one but I'm in starting in the fall these are upcoming topics in SE I should mention something about schedule for a second hold on I got to pause this so let me mention something about schedule because um I am actually going on a little bit of vacation for about 10 days uh at the end of August starting August 12th um so next week is going to be my last live broadcast of the summer I'm planning on doing one on Thursday this week and one day next week I don't know what day yet um I have a big backlog of videos which is good so more releases will be coming out as I'm away on vacation um with the patreon for the patrons now that I'm doing this crowdfunding thing with that I'm sort of committed to four live streams per month and if you look at how many I've done in July and August I think I'm already at eight so I feel like I've kind of gotten that but sort of my mental checkpoint to see if I'm kind of doing enough to Merit the crowdfunding um you guys can always let me know if you don't feel that I am uh obviously um but um so this Thursday I'll be doing a live stream next week I'll be doing a live stream and then I'll be away um and you know even though I'm only going away for about 10 days as soon as I get back is NYU orientation so I have this job that keeps me living here in New York City and um so that's going to really keep me busy for that last week of August as well so likely the live streams won't come back then until September um and in September I am going to focus my live streams on first of all getting this machine learning stuff going that I haven't been able to make happen this summer I might have make that start that next week but I will be teaching a class on uh JavaScript and text so topics are Markov chains data and apis regular Expressions context free grammars look at Chrome extensions Twitter Bots doing some server side programming all this stuff I will be making videos about all semester long and um if you want to sort of follow along with the assignments and discuss assignments with me you can also subscribe to the patreon and there'll be a slack Channel where I'll discuss that um so boy uh David by the way in the chat in the chat suggest a new challenge Boyds so that would be great I have a lot of video material about flocking and boids already if you look through the nature of code playlists but I I could it'd be interesting to do it as a coding challenge where I program it from scratch um so that's kind of in the hopper for the fall and stay tuned to my Twitter or my email mailing list where I will announce kind of the schedule and once the fall Hits I'm teaching on Tuesdays and Thursdays my class at NYU and I so probably Mondays or Fridays will be my live I'll probably have a consistent once per week live stream so that's kind of my plan for the fall and also I'm starting in the fall I wanted to make this happen in the summer but it seems unrealistic at this point I'm going to start having guests so those viewers I'm going to uh if you want to submit a work a project that you're doing I will show you a project and you can even Skype in if you want and then I also have some uh get people who will come in and do quick guest tutorials I wanted to make that happen this summer so I could release those while I'm away but it it's hard to sort of pin people down it's mostly my fault but I haven't gotten it together so that's also on the horizon for the fall uh and so a lot of things like some Manuel in the chat asked about processing. py python processing um that will um um that will um be something that I might have like a guest come and do because I'm not I don't really do Python Programming but I know people who do and they could come in and do a guest tutorial about that uh okay so that is I think think all I have to say as the song Winds down as I say goodbye this was a 1 hour and 45 minute about live stream we did I did two coding challenges to sum up floppy birds and stage one part one of agario so uh Andrew bone asked what are your thoughts on web components I'm going to have to get back to you on that one that seems like a complex question I'm kind of just a dabbler a Sketcher a playing arounder so I'm not really a professional web developer type person who has serious strict thoughts about how to do things um thanks for tuning in U please subscribe on YouTube Share um you know um trying to make this a sustainable kind of operation so more viewers uh is a um um is great um goodbye okay so that's the end of the song that was coding rainbow episode 55 see you on Thursday this week it will probably also be in the morning stay tuned to Twitter and the email list for an announcement about the precise timing goodbye
