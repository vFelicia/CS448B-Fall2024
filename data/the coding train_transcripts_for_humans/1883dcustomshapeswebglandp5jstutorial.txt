00:00 - okay I've got another webgl in p5 video
00:04 - for you and in this one instead of
00:06 - drawing oh I erased everything on the
00:08 - whiteboard it's fine I don't need to go
00:10 - over there in my list instead of drawing
00:11 - a primitive shaped like a cube a sphere
00:14 - a torus a cone etc I am gonna make my
00:17 - own shape with begin shape and end shape
00:20 - so let's look at how that works so this
00:23 - has a box with a kitten as the texture
00:27 - when I'm done I want to see just a
00:29 - custom shape also with the kitten as a
00:31 - texture let's see if we can make this
00:32 - work okay so let's take out the box
00:37 - let's take out the texture just for now
00:39 - and let's say normal material hopefully
00:43 - this is gonna work now what I'm gonna do
00:45 - is I'm just gonna say begin shape and
00:48 - end shape and I have another video
00:51 - tutorial just about how begin shape and
00:53 - shape and vertex works and you can go
00:55 - refer to that one once you're into the
00:57 - 3d world there's a lot of possibilities
00:59 - we could tile with triangle strips and
01:01 - do all sorts of different things but I'm
01:02 - gonna just make a single shape that has
01:06 - that has vertices and it's like a
01:09 - basically like a quad I'm gonna make a
01:11 - quad so I'm gonna say vertex just to
01:14 - start 0-0 vertex 100 comma zero vertex
01:21 - 100 comma 100 vertex zero comma 100 and
01:28 - I think an important thing that I need
01:30 - to path here is close so what am i doing
01:32 - I have 0 0 100 comma 0 100 comma 100
01:42 - zero comma 100 so I this is my path and
01:46 - all of a sudden out the clothes
01:49 - parameter in end shape makes the last
01:52 - vertex connect to the first vertex ok so
01:55 - let's see this is the equivalent of
01:57 - doing plane right this is like doing
01:59 - plane but I'm doing it with begin shape
02:00 - and edge shape
02:03 - alright I don't see anything
02:05 - let's try fill there we go oh
02:12 - so normal material didn't work but
02:14 - that's fine Phil works
02:16 - can I get ambient material to work no so
02:24 - those seem like they might be bugs right
02:26 - now I'll have to investigate those who
02:27 - come back in this video or write
02:28 - something in the description but I
02:30 - really wanted to show you something
02:32 - about texturing and first of all let me
02:33 - just put Phil back the thing that I want
02:35 - to show you that's important is once I
02:38 - have these custom vertices I can start
02:40 - to really do weird things like for
02:41 - example what if this last vertex over
02:44 - here you know was a little bit more to
02:47 - the right I now have this kind of quad
02:50 - that's not a standard square and also
02:53 - like maybe I want to it's a sort of like
02:55 - Center itself so right now I could say
02:58 - just really quickly I mean I could redo
03:01 - all these vertices but I'm just gonna
03:02 - translate by like negative 50 comma zero
03:05 - and so now I kind of have this quad
03:08 - moving around at the center a bit more
03:10 - so let me put this back and we can see
03:14 - this is just like plain negative 50 I'm
03:19 - sorry negative 50 comma negative 50 it
03:20 - should be okay so now this is just like
03:23 - plain now what I want to do is texture
03:26 - this geometry so what's interesting
03:27 - about this is let's just say I add right
03:31 - now texture oops
03:33 - I'm gonna take texture kitten instead of
03:37 - film interesting website I don't see it
03:41 - why now something's happening but I
03:43 - don't see the kitten why not so this is
03:45 - what's really interesting about working
03:47 - with textures and custom shapes a vertex
03:51 - is defined by its X Y point or really in
03:56 - this case X Y Z that's what this is this
04:00 - is really zero zero zero 100 zero zero
04:03 - right I just sort of ignoring the Z but
04:04 - I probably put that in there if I want
04:07 - to take image data like a JPEG or a PNG
04:11 - or whatever and basically place that
04:15 - image data inside of that polygon the
04:19 - thing that I'm defining I need to say
04:22 - hey zero zero goes with what pixel
04:25 - this pixel 100/0 goes with what pixel
04:29 - this pixel now this would be kind of
04:30 - like a literal mapping of saying like
04:32 - this image gets mapped exactly onto it
04:35 - but what you see about this is you can
04:37 - start to do a lot of different things I
04:38 - will also refer you to a video about a
04:41 - flag simulation that I also have that
04:44 - does the same exact thing but with a
04:45 - more complex geometry so for the vertex
04:50 - function instead of just X Y Z I can
04:54 - also have you V the U and V coordinates
04:58 - are the pixel mappings on the image and
05:01 - I believe in p5 by default these are
05:06 - normalized so there are different ways
05:10 - this can be done but what I mean by
05:12 - normalized is this is actually 0 0 this
05:15 - is 1 0 this is 1 1 and this is 0 comma 1
05:19 - even if this is a 640 by 480 image so
05:24 - basically so let's look at how that
05:26 - works and let's start adding those UV
05:29 - coordinates in so I think this should be
05:31 - so let me add the 0 in because I have a
05:33 - feeling it might not it's probably gonna
05:36 - figure it out properly without the 0 so
05:39 - I'm going to now say this is 0 0 this is
05:44 - 1 comma 0 this is 1 comma 1 UV and this
05:49 - is 0 comma 1 so let's try that there we
05:53 - go there's the cat on our custom shape
05:58 - now it's so dark let's just pump up the
06:03 - ambient light here all right so I just
06:06 - wanted to add ambient more ambient so we
06:08 - could see it now here's the thing that's
06:09 - interesting these mapping you now have a
06:14 - lot of creative possibilities like for
06:16 - example what if I just took out this
06:19 - point right what if I put this what if I
06:21 - need this a triangle and kind of move
06:24 - this point to 50 comma 50 so let's try
06:30 - that
06:30 - so this lap this vertex is actually
06:33 - going to be 50 comma 50 and we should
06:36 - see look and you can see how it's sort
06:38 - of trying to figure out
06:39 - best as it can how to kind of squish the
06:42 - kitten in and probably in this case just
06:45 - this rotation stuff is more trouble than
06:47 - it's worth you can see this is what it's
06:49 - done how its decided to try to smush the
06:51 - kitten into that geometry and this of
06:54 - course could move like I could say Mouse
06:56 - X Mouse Y which is going to produce a
07:00 - really weird results but you can see
07:02 - this is me kind of like stretching so
07:04 - you could imagine you could have an
07:05 - algorithm that's changing the geometry I
07:07 - could have many many more points there's
07:11 - so many possibilities here another thing
07:13 - that I might that I'd love to show that
07:15 - I think's worth showing is what if I
07:17 - reverse so take a look at this kitten
07:20 - see that kitten it's looking that
07:24 - direction what if I flip the pixels and
07:28 - say this pixel should go with 1 comma 0
07:33 - and this should go with 0 comma 0 this
07:37 - should go 0 comma 1 and this should go
07:39 - with 1 comma 1 now the kittens looking
07:42 - the other direction what if I didn't
07:44 - flip the bottom I'm good no kittens will
07:48 - be harmed turning this like that's
07:51 - something weird crazy happen because the
07:52 - top was flipped and had to like twist it
07:54 - to get the bottom so and these can be
07:56 - variables right this could be these
07:58 - could be variables that are changing and
07:59 - oscillating I could you know if I go all
08:02 - the way back whoops let me get that let
08:09 - me get our kitten back there I could do
08:11 - something like I actually only want to
08:12 - see the top half of the kitten so the
08:15 - why are both 0.5 now that's the top half
08:17 - stretched into this stretch into the
08:19 - shape so there's a lot of I'm really
08:21 - just scratching the surface here but as
08:23 - you start to make your own shapes you
08:27 - can texture them and assign different
08:29 - pixels of different images and different
08:31 - parts of an image to different vertices
08:35 - of that sounds of that shape alright so
08:39 - hopefully this was helpful
08:41 - hold on my cap wait ready yeah
08:46 - you know there's still again after the
08:48 - time of this recording there seem to be
08:49 - some bugs with how custom shapes work in
08:53 - p5 WebGL hopefully any of you watching
08:55 - like decide to file a bug or look into
08:57 - fixing a bug in a friendly and
09:00 - supportive way and hopefully and and
09:04 - please tag me at Schiffman on github if
09:06 - you post an issue related to this video
09:07 - or of course you can also ask at forum
09:11 - processing org in the p5.js category if
09:13 - you have kind of questions about how
09:14 - this stuff works so thank you very much
09:17 - and I look forward to seeing your custom
09:19 - geometry with textures in p5 GS

Cleaned transcript:

okay I've got another webgl in p5 video for you and in this one instead of drawing oh I erased everything on the whiteboard it's fine I don't need to go over there in my list instead of drawing a primitive shaped like a cube a sphere a torus a cone etc I am gonna make my own shape with begin shape and end shape so let's look at how that works so this has a box with a kitten as the texture when I'm done I want to see just a custom shape also with the kitten as a texture let's see if we can make this work okay so let's take out the box let's take out the texture just for now and let's say normal material hopefully this is gonna work now what I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna say begin shape and end shape and I have another video tutorial just about how begin shape and shape and vertex works and you can go refer to that one once you're into the 3d world there's a lot of possibilities we could tile with triangle strips and do all sorts of different things but I'm gonna just make a single shape that has that has vertices and it's like a basically like a quad I'm gonna make a quad so I'm gonna say vertex just to start 00 vertex 100 comma zero vertex 100 comma 100 vertex zero comma 100 and I think an important thing that I need to path here is close so what am i doing I have 0 0 100 comma 0 100 comma 100 zero comma 100 so I this is my path and all of a sudden out the clothes parameter in end shape makes the last vertex connect to the first vertex ok so let's see this is the equivalent of doing plane right this is like doing plane but I'm doing it with begin shape and edge shape alright I don't see anything let's try fill there we go oh so normal material didn't work but that's fine Phil works can I get ambient material to work no so those seem like they might be bugs right now I'll have to investigate those who come back in this video or write something in the description but I really wanted to show you something about texturing and first of all let me
