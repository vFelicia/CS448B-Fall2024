05:34 - hello my mic was muted good afternoon
05:38 - good morning good evening good bill of
05:40 - the night I don't know when you're
05:41 - watching this
05:42 - welcome to the coding train with me I'm
05:46 - Dan Shipman now this is a very special
05:50 - livestream I haven't been around
05:52 - live-streaming very much actually I to
05:54 - be honest haven't felt like it very much
05:55 - things are busy things are chaotic and
05:58 - there's a lot going on in the world and
06:00 - especially here in New York City I live
06:01 - in Brooklyn New York and not too far
06:04 - from the Barclays Center and on my mind
06:08 - are the issues around police violence in
06:12 - the city on my mind are the protesters
06:14 - who are out raising their voice against
06:16 - racism and police violence and I wanted
06:19 - to I've been trying to focus some energy
06:22 - and time on supporting some of my
06:26 - students from NYU who have been out
06:28 - protesting and participating and local
06:30 - community organizations so our first
06:32 - thing I know people are making comments
06:34 - about my beard so first thing I want to
06:37 - say is black lives matter and I want to
06:39 - tell you about an organization that this
06:41 - particular live stream is supporting now
06:44 - let me see I'm I've got a lot of like
06:47 - new technical set up for today and thank
06:50 - you of Derek Morris who's made our first
06:52 - donation I want to switch to my computer
07:01 - screen which you're about to see and
07:03 - we've got another donation from
07:04 - anonymous thank you and let me switch
07:09 - right here laptop okay so now you're
07:12 - seeing my fancy computer screen without
07:14 - my camera in it and I'm gonna open up
07:17 - the web browser and I'm gonna talk about
07:19 - Aaron who's our guest today in a minute
07:22 - oh and you all know my dog Gloria I
07:26 - closed all the doors to the room that
07:28 - I'm in because I don't want to be
07:30 - bothered and unfortunately she wants to
07:33 - get out okay Gloria come on good girl
07:35 - there you go good girl
07:37 - look at a camera on her later for all of
07:38 - you who are interested okay I'm
07:40 - to switch over to power plant so
07:44 - power plant is an organization they're
07:48 - located in Bushwick Bushwick Brooklyn
07:51 - they connect teams and with established
07:54 - artists on free interest-driven digital
07:56 - art projects and educational programs
07:58 - they advocate that access to technology
08:01 - is a right and not a privilege
08:04 - now I actually was first introduced I
08:05 - realize this too power plant a year ago
08:10 - and let me see if I can get my camera
08:11 - going here I'm gonna Aaron there's a
08:14 - small chance you're gonna appear but I
08:16 - don't think so ah no you didn't I have
08:21 - you off but your audio is on I can if
08:23 - you talk they'll hear you that's Aaron
08:27 - Berger I was gonna do a really dramatic
08:28 - and huge introduction to bring Aaron on
08:31 - knife I've messed that all up but the
08:35 - processing foundation as as I probably
08:37 - talked about runs a fellowship program
08:39 - so let me briefly try to find the 2019
08:45 - fellows because here we go fellows 2019
08:49 - so a year ago just about from from today
08:53 - or around now I was the mentor for
08:56 - Matilda Matilda who you're seeing on the
08:59 - screen right now is a trans or ghen Iser
09:00 - programmer an artist with an interest in
09:02 - building tech infrastructure for
09:03 - organizing within and across boundaries
09:05 - problematizing are catastrophic notion
09:07 - of community and contributing the
09:08 - systems to uproot unjust socio-economic
09:11 - system so Matilda is fantastic and they
09:14 - taught were a workshop to trans and
09:18 - gender non-conforming youth and you know
09:21 - it's nice to bring this up also this is
09:23 - Pride Month here in June so there's a
09:24 - lot of wonderful causes and communities
09:26 - to support but so Matilda taught this
09:29 - workshop on digital literacy and privacy
09:31 - and coding at power plant so I was
09:35 - visited there when the workshop was
09:37 - running and it didn't didn't make that
09:39 - connection till just a week ago or
09:40 - actually just the other day but a week
09:42 - ago I learned about what power plant is
09:45 - doing in terms of supporting the black
09:47 - lives matter move
09:49 - and protesters in New York so there you
09:51 - can see here on their website they are
09:54 - there in Bushwick they are operating as
09:57 - a rest space and offering access to
09:59 - computers Wi-Fi and a printer they're
10:00 - also a donation drop-off center shall a
10:02 - group of students from anyways ITP
10:05 - program and and and friends and family
10:07 - of theirs organized a whole collection
10:09 - of donations to drop off their their
10:12 - teaching workshops on digital security
10:14 - protest safety surveillance I actually
10:16 - have some projects I'm working on
10:17 - related to security and surveillance in
10:21 - photos and images so maybe I'll come
10:22 - back later this we can do another
10:23 - livestream on that it's not what today
10:25 - um so you can you can donate to support
10:29 - power plant through their website I'm
10:32 - right in front of it right now but
10:34 - there's a donate button on the on their
10:36 - website itself but on YouTube and thank
10:38 - you David Schneider I'm not sure I'm
10:39 - catching all these donations but I'll
10:41 - try to shout them out when I do YouTube
10:43 - also you through one of the features I
10:47 - have for my channel is the YouTube
10:48 - Giving Program so any 501c3 nonprofit
10:51 - organization I can attach as a
10:54 - fundraiser to I've done this if you
10:55 - recall a couple times at least once for
10:57 - the processing foundation and there are
11:00 - many other fundraisers going on right
11:02 - now on YouTube and one of the things
11:04 - that I'm attempting to do and I think
11:05 - it's something that you can do as well
11:06 - if you're looking for ways that you can
11:07 - make a difference
11:08 - there are many large organizations that
11:11 - need your support but something that
11:13 - often gets missed are smaller local
11:15 - organizations that can really use just a
11:19 - volunteer time donations of food and
11:21 - supplies as well as money so powerplant
11:24 - is local - it's not my immediate
11:26 - neighborhood but local to Brooklyn where
11:28 - I live I do wanna mention that there are
11:30 - a bunch of other I did in trying to
11:32 - figure out to fundraise there were
11:33 - several other organizations that I've
11:35 - been talking to and also try to support
11:38 - in my own work I mean it's a little
11:39 - tricky to get them added to the YouTube
11:40 - system and I was so lucky enough to get
11:42 - powerplant write up but I do want to
11:44 - just mention a quick shout-out to a to
11:46 - others code cooperative and maybe I can
11:50 - do a fundraiser for them later code
11:52 - cooperative is a really amazing
11:54 - organization that is a community of
11:57 - people who learn use and build
11:59 - technology to create life-changing
12:00 - possibilities for individuals and
12:01 - communities impacted by
12:02 - car serration so you can volunteer and
12:05 - donate and they actually have a
12:06 - mentorship and a hiring program thank
12:08 - you science club for your donation so
12:12 - one thing I just wanted to mention here
12:13 - is if you're looking to hire go check
12:17 - out code cooperative I think it's here
12:18 - under the agency that they are basically
12:23 - they partner industry experts with
12:26 - formerly incarcerated technologists so
12:28 - something that we can do to help fight
12:33 - against you know mass incarceration is
12:35 - and and and help support people who have
12:37 - been incarcerated is through
12:39 - organizations like code cooperative
12:40 - particular former community so they're
12:41 - fantastic and I also was going to
12:44 - mention the Marci lab school which is a
12:50 - a school an organization that that runs
12:55 - programs for youth and that is really
13:00 - fantastic and does a lot of really
13:02 - excellent work that I would encourage
13:04 - you to check more about on their website
13:05 - under their programs that they run and
13:08 - you can see a bunch of their attendees
13:10 - of their fellows so this is really also
13:12 - I highly encourage you to check out
13:13 - Marci lab so maybe I could do more of
13:15 - these fundraisers for some of these
13:16 - other other organizations okay another
13:20 - donation from anonymous
13:22 - alright so that's my that's a bit of my
13:24 - opening spiel here for today I I
13:29 - certainly would subscribe to this
13:31 - statement access to technology as a
13:33 - right not a privilege I'm very lucky in
13:35 - so many ways in my life in terms of how
13:37 - I've had access to equipment and an
13:39 - audience and education and anything that
13:42 - I could do to help provide that for
13:43 - others I think YouTube is a platform
13:45 - that allows me to do that in one way it
13:48 - certainly leaves certain people out
13:51 - people are interested in watching me
13:53 - leaves people out perhaps and so
13:56 - something that I'm really trying to do
13:57 - through my work is also encourage other
14:00 - people to teach and stream and create
14:04 - with creative coding tools and
14:07 - technology so well someone that I really
14:10 - want to highlight for you today if I go
14:12 - back to the Fellowship's now I'm back on
14:14 - to the 2020 fellowships
14:16 - and I'm gonna bring her on her camera on
14:19 - right now let's see if this works
14:20 - very exciting you ready Aaron okay
14:24 - Aaron's cameras there now - hi and so
14:28 - I'm Aaron I'm gonna let Aaron really
14:30 - introduce herself but I met Aaron in
14:33 - person actually at the i/o festival err
14:37 - goal on Levin and introduced me to Aaron
14:40 - I guess were you where you go on student
14:42 - in a class or you just know him from you
14:43 - oh wow yeah I'm like I've known him
14:50 - since like a freshman year and like like
14:52 - I remember I having a huge story like
14:54 - when the first times I met him I was
14:56 - telling him um thinking of like
14:57 - transferring design and then he wanted
14:59 - huge rent saying how I shouldn't chanson
15:01 - to design and stay with art and that was
15:02 - my like first interactions oh and golems
15:06 - in the chat so first can I read about
15:08 - Aaron I just saw Golan wrote hey Aaron
15:11 - can everybody hear Aaron cuz I want to
15:13 - make sure my technology is set up
15:14 - correctly and audio quality is okay it's
15:17 - gonna take I'm it's gonna take a little
15:20 - bit but hopefully people are saying they
15:23 - love your room I'm ready to reverse my
15:26 - video because it looks like I'm looking
15:27 - away from you but when I look this
15:29 - direction I'm looking exactly at you I
15:31 - think it's gonna mirror my video how
15:34 - long is that a enable preview Oh while
15:38 - you're talking I'll try to switch my
15:40 - video people also they like your
15:41 - keyboard okay oh so so let me uh but I
15:45 - have to do my prepared remarks which
15:47 - aren't actually prepared cuz anybody's
15:48 - watch the coding train knows that I
15:49 - prepare absolutely nothing as you can
15:51 - tell by my very awkward attempts to use
15:54 - my voice to support black lives matter
15:55 - but I I do want to I do really want to
15:58 - do that to the extent that I can
16:00 - okay so Aaron is a fellow for processing
16:04 - Foundation and her proposal
16:06 - I remember reading it and being really
16:08 - excited by it because it was about how I
16:12 - should let you speak to this but I'm
16:14 - gonna give you my own characterization
16:16 - of it and you could correct me if I got
16:17 - it wrong but I know Aaron is someone who
16:19 - has been interested in code and
16:20 - technology and learned a lot on her own
16:22 - and was really didn't necessarily see
16:27 - when she was learning especially in high
16:28 - school role models are people for her to
16:31 - find online who were doing what she was
16:33 - doing and so she wanted to maybe be that
16:36 - person for somebody else through
16:38 - streaming as well she also talked a bit
16:40 - about how like rather than do streams a
16:42 - lot of my content are sort of like
16:44 - curricular tutorial to trick Euler
16:47 - curriculum tutorials yeah so it's like
16:50 - follow this playlist of videos where I
16:52 - or you know teacher person will talk at
16:54 - you and lecture and explain stuff and
16:56 - that has that has value hopefully people
16:59 - obviously I found it through the channel
17:01 - and learned to code I do do some more
17:03 - improvisational and sort of fun coding
17:05 - on my streams but I think what what what
17:08 - really resonated with me and Erin's
17:09 - proposal was this idea of what's like
17:11 - this sort of like fun hangout session
17:13 - where you can learn about coding see
17:15 - creative projects and that's really what
17:18 - you wanted to do in it kind of cosy way
17:20 - to read there with her stream so I got a
17:23 - shut up a glad you jump again and so
17:25 - well I'm gonna try to reverse fix up
17:27 - some of my tech stuff err maybe you
17:29 - could talk about your your journey and
17:34 - to learning to code what it's been like
17:35 - for you you know at CMU and what you're
17:37 - doing with your twitch channel okay okay
17:39 - yeah yeah I think like Oh something guys
17:41 - does anyone is saying about like um oh
17:44 - it feels so weird because I don't
17:46 - usually have this many audience but yeah
17:50 - I think it's one thing I want to mention
17:51 - was I in the proposal I physically said
17:55 - like oh I want this to be like um it's
17:58 - like coding train with your professors
18:00 - like lectures and stuff like that I want
18:03 - my code decoding to be like that cool TA
18:05 - and I was like friends with your older
18:07 - siblings you know and like they know
18:09 - what's up but also like they kind of are
18:12 - just relaxed and I could trouble with
18:13 - trying to get through college just like
18:15 - you so yeah um
18:19 - I guess I can say like like about me
18:21 - yeah so I'm Erin I really like hexagons
18:24 - that's my thing that's my steel besides
18:25 - like very cozy and comfortable things um
18:28 - I go to cranky though and right now and
18:30 - I'm like in the weird like senior row of
18:32 - my graduation I took this semester off
18:34 - like before I knew coronavirus would
18:36 - happen and I try to varios happen yeah
18:40 - that was like the best call I probably
18:42 - say my whole academic career it's fine
18:43 - I'm kidding this better calls but yeah
18:45 - um yeah so when doing this with Jameis
18:49 - mr. Dolph I was like I want to apply for
18:51 - the fasting fellowship because we like
18:53 - really cool to have like these more like
18:55 - interactive coding tutorial which into
18:57 - like up like the coding chain because
18:59 - it'll be like more fun if I can I talk
19:01 - to the chauchat and like also interact
19:03 - with my viewers and stuff like that and
19:05 - like it'd be like a bit more like
19:06 - personal so to speak like like I
19:08 - assumedly she's going it's like having
19:11 - with no plan for sure I just kind of
19:13 - take a like topic oh and like from the
19:16 - p5.js reference and I'm just like that's
19:18 - what we're gonna do today guys and just
19:20 - tend to go off with it and like everyone
19:22 - like I was like how to plan a bit like
19:25 - um maybe I'll they kind of go into mind
19:27 - that like here's how I should attack
19:28 - this like say like a problem and go
19:31 - ahead and like you know create this
19:32 - project but usually everything is just
19:34 - like up in the air like like like like
19:37 - hey sometimes you would see me just like
19:41 - completely like get stuck on this one
19:42 - problem you kind of see me get like
19:44 - super tiny but that's okay we're all
19:45 - getting like tired together the people
19:47 - I'm alpha editor has it's not alpha
19:49 - anymore so it's not like that the people
19:51 - I went by the editor has I crashed on me
19:53 - both of the times you see my despair in
19:55 - there oh well yeah it's a good time um
19:59 - yeah like I said mostly what I'm doing
20:02 - right now because you know it's a
20:04 - coronavirus o'clock like what else do
20:06 - you suppose to do
20:07 - I'd like to stay at home and like stream
20:09 - I listen to a lot of podcasts I guess I
20:12 - work on my hexagon library like once in
20:15 - a while I'm getting back into it at
20:16 - least and like now it's like I've like
20:19 - settled in the coronavirus groove I'm
20:21 - some time straight I'm gonna like like
20:23 - streaming like me working on it at least
20:24 - yeah Lily bass about it yeah awesome
20:28 - Thank You Erin for that awesome shirt so
20:30 - I want to address just a couple
20:32 - questions that came up in the chat and
20:33 - then we'll get started with the coding
20:34 - stuff so some people were oh and thank
20:37 - you go on for your donation
20:39 - where's my bell Colin's what you know
20:42 - it's funny like this this is very silly
20:44 - but like sometimes I can like I can
20:48 - create the illusion for myself that
20:49 - nobody is actually watching this or
20:51 - nobody act that I know is watching it's
20:53 - it's like oh there's a person that I
20:55 - know it's goal I'm like oh my god all of
20:58 - my flaws are there here for the world to
21:00 - see but anyway so I want to mention so a
21:04 - couple had asked about audio and video
21:06 - quality for Aaron so I what the way that
21:10 - I've got this working right now and
21:11 - apologies if it's not perfect is I'm on
21:13 - a discord to call with her video call
21:16 - with her and the audio and the video are
21:18 - coming in from that so so I think it's
21:23 - it's good enough but I would love any
21:25 - feedback or maybe if I do more of this
21:26 - kind of guest stuff I'll come back and
21:28 - improve it for the next time around but
21:29 - what I'm going to tell you is that in
21:32 - about an hour or sooner or later
21:34 - somewhere around there we are actually
21:35 - going to switch over we're gonna move
21:37 - this whole everybody watching we're all
21:40 - gonna move over to twitch.tv slash cozy
21:42 - coding and watching it resting and I
21:45 - knew audio and video quality will
21:47 - improve from from Aaron's because it'll
21:50 - be direct streaming from her location so
21:55 - it's this is the thing I actually a
21:58 - couple people I know that Kobe and and
22:01 - David who have that you've been using
22:02 - their experimental chat tool and yeah
22:05 - Steve for your donation I forgot to
22:07 - mention that I was planning to match
22:08 - these donations up to $500 so I don't
22:12 - know where we are right now with the
22:13 - total but if we can get up to 500 ollars
22:15 - for the total that I will be matching
22:17 - that donation myself just to encourage
22:20 - you it doesn't look like I needed to
22:21 - encourage people too much because people
22:22 - are donating and I really appreciate
22:23 - that and also like I realize a lot of
22:25 - you watching you you don't have the
22:26 - means to donate or maybe actually for
22:28 - some of you you might not actually even
22:29 - be able to in terms of what YouTube the
22:31 - Google commerce system allows in your
22:34 - local area but you can find other ways
22:37 - to support and certainly if you want to
22:39 - join the coding train discord and if
22:41 - there are ways we can talk about how the
22:42 - coding train community can support black
22:45 - lives matter that's a place to have that
22:47 - discussion okay now there were some
22:51 - other questions I got one so one person
22:56 - asked how do you apply for the
22:57 - processing fellowship so the processing
23:01 - fellowship and maybe let me say a couple
23:02 - things of them maybe Aaron can
23:04 - talk about her experience doing that but
23:06 - I what I will just say very briefly is
23:08 - if you go to processing org sorry
23:11 - processing foundation org slash
23:12 - fellowships which is what I have up on
23:13 - the screen right now we usually do the
23:16 - open call for the fellowships around
23:18 - November so stay tuned come back and
23:21 - look on this fall as well as subscribe
23:23 - to probably processing org on Twitter
23:26 - Aaron what was it like oh and Kate holla
23:28 - but look at these people that I sort of
23:29 - that I know I mean I know cake that's
23:31 - like thank you for your donation this is
23:34 - amazing
23:36 - Aaron what was it like for you to apply
23:38 - to do how do you define that process huh
23:40 - okay so I found it on like Twitter at
23:44 - least because like I knew I was going to
23:47 - take the semester off so I save up a bit
23:49 - and I was like oh shoot like what am I
23:51 - gonna do at least and then I saw I think
23:54 - it was Lauren that like posted on like
23:56 - Twitter saying like oh yeah we're having
23:59 - like open call for like associates no
24:01 - like all right oh why like why not you
24:03 - know I've got nothing going on and like
24:05 - I said it's like a couple of like
24:07 - recently like thinking of what to do and
24:09 - then like I think like two days before
24:11 - the due date it just all came to mind I
24:13 - was like that's it okay like stretch
24:18 - together like an application and I was
24:20 - like yeah it's like it's like twitch
24:22 - it's a coding train on Twitch but it's
24:25 - more casual and then like it was great
24:28 - and then like it seemed like the board
24:29 - like really loved it and then like yeah
24:31 - I did like some interviews and stuff
24:33 - like that I physically acts like dad as
24:35 - I mentor subways and just toting train
24:37 - and like it's like quite in a similar
24:39 - vein you know so like I thought though
24:41 - be a SAN mentor and you can do like a
24:43 - lot of things besides just like you know
24:45 - things like this doesn't have to be like
24:47 - all out there like I know that someone
24:49 - like someone else is doing I think like
24:51 - p5 p5.js tutorial than like Africa and
24:55 - everyone is doing like p5 and processing
24:58 - for like elder ease like elderly people
25:00 - in Korea and look like a couple more you
25:03 - know I think last year someone was
25:05 - working on the like getting their
25:06 - release of the p5 editor so it doesn't
25:09 - have to be like outreach like this it
25:11 - could also be something like internal
25:13 - where you kind of want to like improve
25:14 - processing and p5 itself you know
25:17 - ya know and Olivia just gave a donation
25:20 - hi olivia.olivia is watching Olivia I
25:24 - also met introduced by Golan at IO
25:27 - Festival yeah what's the thing I wanted
25:32 - to mention about the processing
25:33 - fellowships is so we run a bunch of
25:35 - different programs actually what's going
25:36 - on what's going on right now a program
25:38 - we run but we participate in its google
25:40 - Summer of Code and which is a way that
25:43 - if you're a university student
25:45 - undergraduate or graduate student you
25:46 - can apply to work on an open-source
25:48 - project over the summer and get paid and
25:50 - get paired with a mentor but some of
25:53 - these programs and this isn't
25:54 - necessarily a criticism of them but it's
25:55 - important to mention that really are
25:57 - specifically for people writing code and
26:00 - doing development work on open-source
26:03 - projects and from my point of view and I
26:05 - think I can say from the processing
26:06 - foundation point of view it's really
26:08 - important to support and fund projects
26:11 - that have to do with community education
26:14 - inclusion and so sometimes these it's
26:17 - easy to forget the importance of just
26:19 - things we do to to come together as a
26:23 - community to educate each other and so
26:26 - the fellowship program is really a way
26:27 - that you can apply for to get funding
26:30 - and mentorship for a project that's not
26:32 - just about like writing a code library
26:35 - although you can also write a code
26:37 - library and also I don't I hate that I'm
26:39 - even describing it this way because
26:41 - those are not separate things right the
26:43 - act of creating an open-source library
26:46 - is the act of building a community and
26:49 - and and it's just it's it's it's more
26:52 - important I would say and it's something
26:53 - that I think that I all you know I'm not
26:55 - saying I succeed at this but I always
26:57 - try to keep in mind with the kinds of
26:59 - things that I work on is how has access
27:03 - to this who's left out of this and how
27:05 - can we do better to to bring more people
27:08 - in to feel welcome and included and they
27:10 - can participate so I've been told by
27:14 - breaking news I have my by ridiculous
27:16 - breaking I'm trying not to use my sound
27:17 - effects today but and I it doesn't even
27:20 - work right now oh wait where's my
27:21 - breaking news here hold on
27:24 - [Music]
27:25 - breaking news we have hit our dollar
27:29 - [Music]
27:30 - okay thank you everybody keep donating
27:34 - one of the reasons why I wanted to do
27:36 - the matching donation is I don't know
27:38 - how actually takes for the sort of like
27:40 - systems that donation the YouTube system
27:43 - to be able to get them collect the money
27:47 - do all the stuff and get it to power
27:49 - plant so I'll be I'll make that donation
27:50 - today so they'll have some funds for the
27:53 - work that they're doing right now to act
27:55 - as a sanctuary space for protesters okay
27:58 - so next oh so what you can't see Aaron
28:01 - that I also brought up one of the thing
28:03 - that I love and I haven't caught every
28:05 - single minute of Aaron streams but I've
28:07 - watched I would say at least half of
28:08 - them and the the just the sheer like
28:12 - sort of colorful creative designs that
28:16 - come out of each of her playful
28:17 - experiments are really fun and beautiful
28:19 - and unique and so I have up on the
28:21 - screen right now just the sort of
28:24 - thumbnails from your last three streams
28:26 - so people can kind of see and so I think
28:28 - this is and I mean to put it on code
28:34 - pens but I haven't gotten around to yet
28:37 - either I'm gonna like like set an alarm
28:43 - for myself and like you bet like that's
28:46 - like I think I'll do it like in between
28:47 - like when we go to your stream and to my
28:50 - stream like like in that like time I'll
28:53 - just like slap one code pen real fast
28:54 - you know and I'm like release it yeah
28:57 - yeah epic oh I'll do awesome so I think
29:00 - I'm gonna try I'm table where I talk too
29:04 - much
29:04 - and I do this in a lot of aspects of my
29:07 - life as my children are like we have
29:09 - something to say to you know so I'm
29:13 - gonna try what I'd like to do now is I'm
29:16 - gonna switch over to the glitch page and
29:21 - I'm gonna let you take it from here and
29:25 - I'm gonna I should just mute myself I
29:28 - won't mute myself but I'm gonna I'm
29:30 - gonna try to move into the sidelines and
29:31 - let you start your cosy coding and I can
29:35 - answer any questions and participate in
29:36 - hopefully not messed things up
29:39 - okay No No please please feel free to
29:42 - like go ahead and like you know do
29:45 - whatever because this missamma collab at
29:47 - least you know I view this as a collab
29:49 - so I kind of just like both doing this
29:51 - together in this project together it's
29:53 - how I view it so if you want to go ahead
29:56 - and yeah so like gosh I didn't know what
29:59 - I want to do like if you guys can't see
30:01 - my screen cuz like right now I'm just
30:03 - going over to me like p5 reference that
30:05 - for this that's that
30:07 - um let's see what see and I'm kind of
30:10 - like a looking at lips I usually sight
30:12 - like a freight stream I just go ahead
30:14 - and look and say like ah what thing do I
30:16 - wanted to work on today and like I saw
30:19 - that like there and like typing like
30:21 - text-align at least like this I start
30:23 - typing like text things and I just like
30:25 - you know I haven't necessarily touched
30:27 - upon texts really yet so I might do
30:31 - something like that um but like I always
30:34 - found that text is like a little bit
30:35 - limiting whoo let's see let's see let's
30:40 - see let's see what the reference has
30:42 - protects all right place mostly have
30:43 - like text align text leading um what is
30:46 - oh you got kid no yeah but you can I can
30:52 - always pull something up so if there's
30:54 - something I think it's actually in a way
30:55 - it's sort of use well yeah I can pull
30:57 - something yeah yeah um no no I'm just
31:02 - like going super idea with this but I
31:03 - feel like going ahead and like using
31:06 - text of it cause like I don't
31:07 - necessarily like I just haven't
31:09 - agreement a lot uh-oh uh-oh
31:17 - I lost Erin's audio hold on Erin do you
31:19 - hear me
31:20 - shoot it was all going so well how many
31:25 - technical problems okay you you you code
31:29 - but why did I lose your audio did
31:32 - something happen on your end perhaps
31:34 - let's check sorry everybody a little
31:40 - technical difficulty here let me go to
31:44 - our video call
32:09 - you're muted Aaron I see you as muted
32:22 - I did not definitely there's a Defen
32:25 - setting oh yeah I think I see that I
32:40 - know but I don't we've put on some music
32:50 - here just like ease the awkwardness a
32:54 - little bit anybody in touch with her
33:36 - messaging her on discord
33:42 - I have too many things open okay let me
33:46 - just go to this for a second
33:53 - [Music]
33:58 - talk amongst yourself everybody okay
34:03 - are you hearing me right on that if you
34:06 - hear me please type okay wait this is
34:19 - great now we've got something we're
34:21 - doing here
34:21 - [Music]
34:36 - [Music]
35:01 - ah I've got you it's always my fault the
35:23 - technical problems I always I'm glad I'm
35:30 - glad no we're back and I usually don't
35:40 - press it
35:41 - but because the keyboard is different
35:44 - and it's easy to press with one no we're
35:50 - good we're good
35:50 - I've lost the chatting program okay ten
35:58 - oh it's the music too loud oh dear
36:00 - oh no no no it's good I turned the music
36:03 - off
36:03 - I should play some nice relaxing music
36:06 - this will be better I just think it's
36:12 - like I was typing whatever is going on
36:14 - and like thing is like when it deferens
36:16 - and discord deferens it would like play
36:18 - like a loud noise you know they tell you
36:20 - that you got deafened but it didn't play
36:22 - this time I screwed up my audio alright
36:29 - alright this was fun oh so we didn't
36:33 - hear a lot of what you were Sarah just
36:36 - but it's okay just don't worry about
36:38 - repeating yourself and then it was just
36:42 - like I see I a glance over her phone but
36:45 - she's muted and I was like oh oh no and
36:47 - then it's like it's funny I mean doesn't
36:49 - realize I'm just like oh no well all's
36:54 - well that ends well okay you can come
36:57 - here we're bad Koby in the chat and the
37:03 - disk or chat rightz this is the perfect
37:06 - representation for both of their streams
37:08 - to be honest and i would have to say oh
37:11 - that's about right
37:13 - actually the time like is that time
37:16 - where i like drink drink water like a
37:18 - chokes for like the solitude live like i
37:20 - couldn't do anything about it you know
37:22 - playing it t5i veterinary eats my toes
37:26 - this is this stream this is what you
37:28 - expected you heard aviaries thanks
37:34 - all right moving on great so I'm just
37:40 - gonna wrap it up I'm like one second
37:43 - yeah so I was saying my Texas I don't
37:47 - usually use text like I don't know right
37:49 - like what to do I don't know video that
37:51 - p5 text at least pod okay and that's it
37:56 - I'm just remembering back to thinking I
37:57 - couldn't hear you so I thought you just
37:59 - like didn't say anything I thought you
38:00 - must be dry it off like that no I'm here
38:08 - I'm here
38:09 - okay all right so um cool so like I
38:14 - don't like I was asking you if I'm Tina
38:17 - Google Fonts works in oe5 editor at
38:21 - least um so I know you can we I know you
38:26 - can set a font yeah and I know that
38:29 - Google Fonts has fonts and the question
38:35 - in my mind I believe it does we might
38:38 - have to do something goofy and CSS but I
38:41 - I've never tried this so it's certainly
38:43 - something we could try yeah yeah cuz I
38:46 - know if you go to be reference and if
38:49 - you check um like the text font and you
38:52 - look like um I think the second example
38:54 - it says function preload and you can
38:56 - like load spots there's like a load
38:58 - function yeah yeah so I'm doing right
39:01 - now
39:02 - mmm well certainly it it would work to
39:08 - download the font if it's the correct
39:12 - format OTF for example whatever that is
39:15 - I should know but I don't open type I
39:18 - guess open type format maybe and then we
39:22 - could upload it to glitch and then be
39:24 - able to load it that way okay okay I'm
39:27 - like the tricky thing about this is this
39:30 - is one thing that does require other
39:32 - browser pages besides the
39:37 - the glitch sketch itself so it's a
39:40 - little hard for me to show like you
39:42 - looking around for a font that you like
39:43 - but you can look and then when you find
39:45 - it you could tell me yeah yeah yeah I'm
39:47 - like I'm just like going towards the API
39:50 - I'm like you can like import a style you
39:53 - know to like HTML um like I wanna I see
39:59 - some of the chat so like you can pass
40:00 - like the URL when I'm trying to see if I
40:04 - couldn't like maybe maybe it's gonna
40:06 - work
40:07 - brookies I'm just gonna drop it in there
40:09 - and see what happens who knows it all
40:14 - right I'm just gonna get like a regular
40:16 - one and and Sam and just gonna copy this
40:23 - and therefore to use fonts you have to
40:26 - have a preload which is like our our
40:28 - setup setup okay look I'm not typing
40:34 - that code isn't that cool I'm showing my
40:36 - hands and probably just like a string I
40:46 - put that in there see what happens oh
40:48 - shoot it like autofill strings sugar
40:51 - that purrs me off all the time and it's
40:54 - like oh no what do I not know that's
40:55 - right it looks right to me yeah yeah but
40:58 - like it looks like it's sucking like
41:00 - loading purgatory like oh well oh I see
41:05 - what you mean so yeah like like it's
41:08 - uploading but like it can't get it you
41:11 - know what I mean like that's happened to
41:13 - me before
41:14 - look working like p5 let me sing my
41:17 - things
41:18 - no just say boating for like ever and I
41:21 - will never finish so we got an
41:23 - unsupported OpenType signature at parse
41:27 - buffer we got like a weird error that
41:30 - I'm showing on the screen right now in
41:31 - the console yeah well I would say maybe
41:41 - it makes more sense to download and
41:42 - upload the font I do have another sort
41:44 - of like idea though which is that one
41:47 - way that sort of you know I think
41:49 - sometimes the way
41:50 - type there's like that question that you
41:52 - were asking this of like well why do I
41:54 - want to work with type what I'd like to
41:55 - do is make geometric patterns and work
41:58 - on animations and color so one thing
42:01 - that you can do with type is just
42:04 - consider it like a shape like the same
42:07 - way you would draw squares but so you
42:11 - could create an entire design that's all
42:13 - just squares and then at the last moment
42:17 - basically change every square to like a
42:19 - letter form so we kind of like put the
42:22 - font stuff off for later and just sort
42:23 - of like bring that hang later that makes
42:27 - sense
42:27 - okay and I was actually going to tell
42:29 - you when you said you're going to
42:30 - download it and then re-upload it that's
42:32 - like the cool thing about glitch cuz he
42:34 - sees like where little expenses assets
42:35 - yeah you can like just drop like your
42:38 - files in there and then when you dropped
42:41 - your files in there you can like load it
42:43 - from like the assets folder like you
42:45 - essentially just say say like Flash
42:46 - assets and then flash like I have a file
42:48 - name in so you don't have so it's all
42:50 - like contained online you know what I
42:53 - mean people people are joining I see
43:00 - like chat messages from people on glitch
43:02 - like can I join but I think for right
43:05 - now I'm going to leave this glitch
43:07 - sketch just for Aaron and me to have
43:09 - typing privileges in but certainly what
43:13 - we'll do when this finishes is publish
43:15 - it and let people make their own
43:16 - versions of it yeah yeah okay yeah and I
43:21 - don't know if you heard me I think my
43:23 - key vines am I gonna turn it off right
43:24 - now I think I accidentally triggered it
43:26 - um what I was saying was is that um what
43:30 - you can do is like you can see all those
43:32 - like the assets oh yes yes yes yeah yeah
43:35 - you can go ahead and you can just like
43:38 - um you can go ahead and like upload the
43:41 - font there and this word whenever you
43:44 - want you can say flash assets and then
43:47 - flash the font name and therefore it
43:48 - should load from there so therefore
43:50 - you're like our whole project including
43:51 - like that's downloaded like assets are
43:54 - like well downloaded assets are like
43:56 - online so I'm also discovering something
44:01 - else
44:02 - Oh God
44:04 - which is that you this URL that you
44:07 - pasted in is like the URL for the CSS
44:10 - that would allow you to incorporate the
44:12 - font so it's not actually the font
44:14 - itself but in there I found what I
44:17 - believe is the URL to the actual font
44:19 - file I'll be this and that didn't work
44:24 - either
44:25 - okay but no unsupported type okay um
44:32 - that's like fine because I didn't
44:34 - download the font package local I
44:36 - compute it perfect oh if I could find
44:39 - the file Sam and then I'm just going to
44:43 - go ahead I'm adding I'm adding a little
44:46 - bit of extra code that I believe we need
44:49 - I just put an asset in there so we're
44:52 - going to go out and delete this mess of
44:55 - a string got it and then we're gonna say
45:00 - I think it's flash assets and then flash
45:03 - I don't know what the assets actually
45:04 - called ah Roboto mono - regular dot t TF
45:10 - yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and go into
45:14 - my sketch and paste it and hopefully did
45:19 - gosh it should what let's see
45:26 - unsupported OpenType signature not hold
45:29 - on let's rerun the only reason I took PT
45:32 - yes yeah yeah yeah um peopIe pasty TS
45:37 - hmm that's right do I have like an
45:41 - action no I think it's finding the file
45:46 - because it's not a 404 error like if I
45:49 - misspell it when I misspell that and
45:54 - then refresh it no oh no that's for now
46:01 - there was a 404 oh it's it's 404 it is
46:05 - hold on let's okay
46:09 - reg you right let's see they put it back
46:16 - refresh yeah it's giving a 404 error
46:23 - gosh darn it um someone's at son OTS it
46:28 - can be a TTS so that's just fine because
46:32 - I'm looking at the records right now and
46:34 - says well as an OpenType follow-up spot
46:36 - bio OTS how much ETF come on follow URL
46:40 - um I returned to p5 on object alright ah
46:48 - why don't you maybe with you want to
46:50 - move on and start making some other
46:54 - stuff I can look into this font thing
46:56 - and see if I can get it to fix okay um
46:58 - that's fine
47:00 - this is the beauty of like you know
47:02 - what's the cause a creative coding at
47:04 - least fully clothed code because someone
47:06 - can be buggy
47:08 - well another person can do that whatever
47:11 - it okay so um we're going to say you're
47:15 - gonna put the text stuff into the mortal
47:17 - coil and then I'm also going to like
47:19 - comment that out the lease I have like
47:22 - some I have something why oh all right
47:29 - it's like the preload I think the whole
47:30 - preload function is probably clogging it
47:32 - up so I will just comment out my whole
47:35 - preload function and let's see what
47:37 - happens all right I hear in the plate
47:41 - making sure I actually think Stefan
47:43 - myself even though I turned off all
47:47 - right um honestly let's start with
47:50 - shapes that's like the most basic part
47:52 - of like p5 it's shaped like what else
47:54 - are you gonna do besides draw shapes
47:55 - text I don't know so if we go to so it's
48:01 - like actually oh I haven't like done
48:02 - anything with arcs yet and that I'm kind
48:06 - of like I can't wait to do I don't know
48:09 - why I just haven't done anything so
48:12 - we're gonna say like we're gonna put in
48:14 - the middle what's / - height / - and
48:18 - what else - never arcs with of the arch
48:22 - by just default okay
48:24 - so just like yeah we can just give that
48:27 - a number that's like a bear radius
48:29 - we're gonna say like 100 and 100 and
48:32 - what else we need we need a start and a
48:35 - stop so we're gonna say 0 & 1
48:40 - II see cool um well well that that ain't
48:53 - 90 degrees uh you need to change it's
48:56 - doing it radians by default okay you can
49:00 - use an angle mode to change that it's
49:06 - funny because I who's it gonna sound
49:09 - like but back when I had to like walk
49:12 - whatever through the snow to school or
49:13 - whatever is like the idea of angle mode
49:15 - degrees was a thing that didn't exist in
49:17 - in processing so I my brain has been
49:19 - tuned to think in radians but most
49:22 - people are more comfortable with
49:24 - thinking in degrees oh darn young and
49:32 - yes I always forget I didn't have an
49:34 - angle mode degrees when I was growing up
49:40 - okay um let's see oh I know that the
49:46 - mode is like interesting because we can
49:48 - have they have the the extra two
49:51 - parameters or mode in detail and it's
49:53 - like determine the way of the Archaea
49:55 - that corridor pie or it's open and I
49:57 - like just like core it is just like you
49:59 - know the court itself
50:00 - pie is like it shaped like a pie now
50:04 - corn is like it can visualize draw the
50:06 - line from like the start to like the end
50:08 - at least so it's not white it like
50:09 - completes the border if I recall and
50:12 - like actually you know and sometimes
50:14 - just like vaguely describing it I might
50:16 - as well just show it the HRD I spelled
50:20 - that wrong yeah it goes like that which
50:24 - kind of I kind of liking that a little
50:27 - bit um that watching me like Highness on
50:29 - the play around with because like what
50:30 - if he had just like a little like for
50:34 - loop for
50:40 - I addressed them like 360 and like I and
50:47 - then I'm just going to go ahead and deal
50:49 - it I'm just gonna throw that out here
50:55 - what I have I'm like doing recently I've
50:58 - been reading a book called a clean code
51:02 - and it's just saying to you like how
51:04 - you're like code should be like you know
51:06 - clean and all neat and stuff like that
51:07 - and then I go to like here there is this
51:11 - lovely format this file button what
51:14 - which was mom yeah yeah and I'm like I
51:19 - go to like here at least oh silly that's
51:24 - right I forgot it's in like the draw
51:26 - loop I'm thinking I got the font to work
51:28 - you got the pot to work well I I don't
51:31 - so this is somebody in the chat I
51:33 - believe the name is Dov Jonny H maybe
51:35 - yes I I can't remember who suggested Oh
51:38 - Jonny H had a suggestion but anyway if
51:40 - you if I click in assets and then click
51:43 - on the uploaded thing I get a URL of
51:46 - like where that file is and I want the
51:50 - full I don't know if this is how you're
51:51 - supposed to do it but it didn't give me
51:53 - an error so okay so that that's easy oh
51:57 - I love what you just did Oh what's the
51:59 - chord yeah yeah yeah yeah oh that's so
52:02 - cool I go to like 360 we're just gonna
52:07 - like I did go to zero flap up and you're
52:15 - missing a double equals there or a
52:17 - triple equals totally correct my screen
52:20 - is tiny I need to like dude I'm gonna
52:24 - like do a bit like force a string there
52:27 - we go that can be much easier for me now
52:29 - I also want to like see the chat too and
52:31 - stuff so yeah there so we can have that
52:34 - um oh you know I've been like meaning
52:37 - okay I wasn't excited mean to play
52:39 - around with a bit of like easing
52:40 - functions but I recommend using
52:43 - functions are like a bit like annoying
52:45 - to start annoying to implement yeah I
52:52 - have one
52:53 - which file of my life if you want there
52:58 - is one that you can do that makes it
53:00 - really really simple and quick if you
53:01 - haven't tried it before which is just
53:02 - using like the lerp function is a really
53:05 - quick way to do if you wanted to do a
53:07 - quick easing from 0 to 360 oh yeah that
53:13 - makes sense actually have you ever used
53:15 - lerp before uh yeah I've used lip but I
53:18 - use lip color and then I didn't think of
53:20 - using lip as an easing function but that
53:22 - makes that yeah maybe I'm I also might
53:25 - not be using the term easing correctly
53:28 - what I think of how I'm doing it with
53:30 - lerp yeah
53:31 - using the time easing correctly looking
53:35 - at now I'm just like no I'm not sure
53:39 - yeah I don't think you can use left with
53:43 - an easing function you just get like a
53:46 - value like in between the start and end
53:49 - point yes but so can I can I show you
53:52 - what I mean real quick I'm gonna comment
53:56 - this out and if I say I equals lerp pi
54:01 - comma 360 if I just put one in there
54:04 - it's gonna be 360 immediately cuz it
54:07 - goes all the way there like a hundred
54:09 - percent of 360 if I put zero oh wait I
54:12 - think you doing oh and then so this
54:16 - should be like this yeah yeah yeah oh
54:20 - that that kind of makes sense
54:21 - oh I didn't realize that make sense
54:26 - cause it constantly changing you right
54:30 - cuz you're going you're going you're
54:31 - going half way you know half way then
54:34 - half way of that then half way of that
54:35 - so it's like you're starting fast it's
54:37 - not like a son like traditionally easing
54:39 - would be like a sine wave probably but
54:41 - it it has a quality to it it's close
54:44 - enough you know what I mean yeah I'm
54:51 - also gonna throw in like no fill oh I
54:54 - need to tell you I don't think I told
54:57 - you of like way for like deciding what
55:00 - color palette like Hawaii the victims
55:02 - website called cooler Co olor SCO
55:07 - random pallet generator oh it's so cool
55:12 - I don't cool I just pulled it up yeah
55:15 - and then you can learn it and then you
55:17 - can like hit space to just generate a
55:19 - random pallet and I just like go off you
55:22 - know I know yeah like sometimes I like
55:27 - played games myself or is like okay um I
55:30 - have to like use the first pallet that
55:32 - comes up unless it's like yellow cuz I
55:34 - hate yellow so like I don't put you I
55:38 - don't even do anything with yellow in it
55:40 - a lorry in the chat is asking can you
55:44 - explain the lerp function okay okay um I
55:48 - can I can do that so like um what can
55:52 - you poke the whip reference young cool
55:55 - just what I like
55:56 - Elise showed would scream cool so like
55:59 - what lip does it basically takes in like
56:01 - three arguments and it takes them as
56:03 - like a beginning point a being a number
56:06 - and end number and then a number between
56:08 - 1 and between 0 and 1 and essentially
56:12 - that like number between late 0 and 1 is
56:16 - like the distance between the start
56:18 - point the set number and the end number
56:20 - so like therefore if you do like a TCM
56:23 - example has a 28 and 80 and then you
56:25 - work a b and then like 5 it gives like
56:29 - it gives a number that's directly
56:31 - halfway between 20 and 80 but if it's
56:33 - point 2 it gives number that's 1/5 of
56:35 - the way between 20 and 80 and so on and
56:38 - so forth um and it's like really cool
56:40 - because like also there's a function
56:42 - work color which you can do the same
56:43 - thing but for color so you can have like
56:47 - really really really easy gradients you
56:49 - know I think like what we can do dan is
56:52 - like um just do a click like lip color
56:55 - like on the background to show what it
56:57 - what it's like I hold on I gotta go back
56:59 - to glitch I'm just saying like
57:04 - background and then we're just gonna
57:07 - have in the back here like a start and a
57:10 - stop cool and like um well here's like
57:14 - one of the palettes that I generated
57:16 - I'll put it to you on discord and oh if
57:19 - I could find my discord window
57:21 - yeah I'll thank you and just good real
57:22 - fast that's like the one that I'm gonna
57:24 - be using okay sure
57:25 - cuz like I just got it now my god whose
57:27 - call actually if you just paste that
57:30 - link in a comment in the code that's an
57:32 - easier way for me to grab it oh shoot
57:34 - you're right that's right cuz I forgot
57:35 - okay so I'm just gonna paste it here
57:41 - cool yeah and the URL is basically just
57:43 - like like six hex with five hex codes
57:45 - that would be generated and I'm gonna
57:48 - probably choose like the first one and
57:50 - be like uh-oh
57:54 - the probably like the first one I'm like
57:56 - the last one or like the second one well
57:59 - get there when we get there that's okay
58:00 - um and then we can say like background
58:06 - and I think they have to be in strings
58:10 - with a hashtag in front of it if I ever
58:13 - call correctly and we'll grab this one
58:17 - because that one and we gotta do it
58:20 - again alright so we're going to do lip
58:24 - background start and stop so we can say
58:26 - like what um I usually use it do it by
58:31 - lines so like essentially if you can say
58:34 - what lip color should equal lip color
58:40 - and I want to go to the preference real
58:42 - fast again she remembered what exactly
58:48 - the arguments have to be Oh sugar
58:52 - am i muted again no no you're good
58:54 - you're good oh okay I can tell you you
58:57 - you I can't I I think the arguments are
59:01 - the same it's like color one color two
59:03 - and the percentage oh it's the same
59:06 - thing color one color to finish cool
59:09 - alright cool so you can say lip see um
59:14 - we're going to put this in the for loop
59:16 - myself Michael for my eyes equal to min
59:24 - 0 is less than with I need commas and
59:30 - semicolons I I always mix it up like I
59:33 - shouldn't be Ivan
59:35 - Johnson for like so long I applause pool
59:39 - and then we can have that back um you
59:50 - can quickly just do a map let's say like
59:54 - let this bunny lips see so we're gonna
59:57 - take this we're gonna hold live remount
60:02 - instead because that's going to be the
60:04 - third argument so you can say let live
60:07 - from Mount is going to be map and we're
60:09 - going to map from i from 0 to the width
60:14 - sugar and then it's gonna be lips won't
60:20 - learn about speeds between 0 and 1 cool
60:23 - so we're gonna get yeah I'm gonna get a
60:27 - number between 0 and 1 and then we're
60:30 - going to say what color is going to be
60:36 - equal to let color start stop and then
60:45 - lip amount right and then that's what
60:51 - we're going to go ahead and we're going
60:52 - to Remy drawing lines CR okay you stroke
60:58 - it's gonna be equal to the color
61:01 - oh I see what you're doing yeah and then
61:05 - I was wondering why are you using a loop
61:07 - cuz like I thought you're gonna animate
61:08 - the background like like the circle is
61:11 - animating but instead you're gonna
61:14 - you're gonna draw like a gradient
61:15 - pattern across by having by going from
61:17 - one color to another yeah that's super
61:20 - cool yeah yes we're gonna say um line 0
61:24 - and they're going to be oopsie it's
61:26 - gonna be I to 0 and then I to height
61:34 - yeah
61:35 - and cool and then after that oh it's not
61:40 - showing up
61:52 - where is there should be a it's not like
61:56 - judge live an error somewhere and I I
62:01 - don't know where the console is I don't
62:03 - know it cannot reap repartee map of
62:10 - undefined oh I think it might be having
62:22 - issues with like this out here we're
62:27 - gonna say like angle a and goe this is
62:34 - gonna be angle and then this is gonna be
62:36 - angle and then I assume that's like B
62:41 - over here this would also have to be
62:47 - angle yeah yeah yeah great I don't think
62:53 - that should have like caused an error at
62:54 - least because I using well what what
62:58 - what if we just just a testing for a
63:01 - second what if we just do this okay so
63:06 - that works all right so what it probably
63:10 - is is like oh oh it's probably things
63:14 - it's like how lights up you're like my
63:16 - color thing like sometimes I get some
63:21 - like areas where I really fit where like
63:27 - um I say it's like what something and
63:29 - then it's like oh cuz it's like a
63:31 - peacock oh I see now I see no we have to
63:34 - say at the very beginning start is equal
63:39 - to colored like this oh those aren't
63:44 - colors of course of course of course of
63:46 - course yes this might like be mad yes
63:52 - very very like that yeah yeah yeah yeah
63:56 - and you need to probably change the
63:58 - white strip
63:59 - what happened to the ark Oh higher but
64:03 - like it's like uh so like we can also do
64:07 - this I might be ruining it visually but
64:09 - we all see it yeah looks like you use
64:14 - this color yeah yeah actually I actually
64:17 - really like the white oh I'm gonna put
64:22 - in the white but I think the white looks
64:24 - super cool there um actually yeah I kind
64:33 - of like that I like it a lot
64:34 - I can't hear you then oh sorry I'm not
64:37 - talking oh good my mouth was open cuz
64:41 - I'm like oh it's so pretty
64:45 - okay also somebody in the chat and said
64:49 - like Oh change the gradient colors to
64:51 - variables and animate them and I was
64:53 - thinking oh yeah how would that would be
64:56 - pretty cool okay that's actually not
64:58 - that's like not that bad because what we
65:00 - can do is we can just say you can say
65:05 - let's that color and then let top color
65:10 - right and we're just going to equal to
65:19 - the start color right yeah yeah
65:21 - then stop color is whoa
65:26 - we could lurk the start and the end has
65:31 - to be different colors than the burping
65:34 - in between is the collective I'm gonna
65:37 - Kathy from car objects right now so you
65:39 - won't have to like probably so you won't
65:41 - be able to do that up there because
65:44 - outside ya won't recognize the paper
65:47 - I've got you okay okay then in that case
65:51 - actually and then I kept it define it
65:59 - outside so I'm gonna take away the less
66:01 - right now let's write color salt color
66:07 - right and then we just have to pour
66:13 - I think can do this right yeah this
66:15 - should break and um I don't think we
66:19 - need these now Oh doesn't like it okay I
66:26 - guess you can't use color inside the
66:29 - setup no you can but now now you don't
66:32 - want to say well yeah yeah yeah like
66:39 - that
66:40 - Coco Coco we didn't we did it that's
66:44 - that's a very good idea um so you can
66:47 - like live between like the colors now
66:49 - right um um and we can like do this by
66:52 - like oh oh I'm trying to like think I'm
66:56 - going towards they like a color function
66:59 - in the reference right now because I
67:05 - think you can like add like right what
67:11 - if we kept separate RGB variables or HSB
67:16 - variables instead of instead of just the
67:20 - singular like hex code then those could
67:23 - change based on you know just
67:26 - incrementation or Perlin noise or a sine
67:28 - wave or any of those kind of things but
67:30 - maybe you wanted to focus more on dr no
67:35 - see that's that's the whole plains are
67:37 - shaped like hey we got attention totally
67:39 - fine right you know I like this um but
67:42 - like I thought was like the p5 color um
67:45 - well the color object you're right yeah
67:48 - so I forget because in processing it's
67:50 - actually not a color object the clear
67:53 - function just makes a raw integer that
67:56 - is the you know representation of that
67:59 - 24-bits color the eight eight and eight
68:01 - this is a 24 yes yeah it's a color
68:06 - object right now I assume it's gonna
68:09 - like triple triple triple check yeah
68:11 - no no you're absolutely right now in
68:12 - fact I'm just gonna add a little
68:13 - console.log and I'll pull it up you
68:15 - won't so yeah look at it that way so um
68:20 - we can like set the color you can set
68:23 - the red and the green the bloom the
68:24 - Alpha yeah
68:26 - um I don't know we can like it doesn't
68:28 - seem like we can get it you know what I
68:30 - mean like you know I started some
68:32 - getters which honestly is an oversight
68:37 - like oh we should like look like um any
68:39 - other people of color we should be able
68:41 - to get the like colors just get like the
68:44 - RGB a name it's new out it's not really
68:49 - designed to be manipulated by the act
68:53 - decoder which is interesting because of
68:55 - course what you want to do is manipulate
68:56 - color yeah and uh you know the way I've
69:00 - always done this is make my own color
69:02 - object because that's how in processing
69:04 - you kind of had to do it oh it is I can
69:07 - see it's unfortunate that we that are
69:09 - like we had this this idea of the shared
69:12 - code window and glitches brilliant and
69:14 - perfect but unfortunately like we can't
69:16 - exactly see what each other are doing
69:18 - but I I looks like there's like a levels
69:22 - array and then zero is red one is blue
69:25 - so there that the data is kind of there
69:27 - but I think it would be true might be
69:29 - actually better for us to just do like
69:34 - what like if we call it like a cosy
69:39 - color and then okay I mean this might be
69:51 - a terrible idea and then we could make
69:56 - our own color objects and then you would
69:57 - just oh but then you wouldn't have a
69:59 - lower color anymore we can have a to
70:02 - color function especially oh okay we
70:07 - just have them like Regan said you just
70:09 - turn the code like to color would like
70:11 - you know spit out like a p5 color object
70:14 - and it will be able to change the cosy
70:16 - color to p5 color yeah you know and
70:20 - that's how it can like manipulate it so
70:22 - that's great that's great that's great
70:26 - and we would have to make this I said I
70:31 - wasn't gonna type but I can't I I need
70:33 - to like I need like a buzzer like every
70:35 - time I start coding too much I have to
70:37 - play my like buzzer
70:39 - you're doing you're doing you're doing
70:40 - great
70:43 - yes we have that cheek color and then
70:45 - see the whole thing about clubs like
70:48 - Club coding it's just paralyzation right
70:51 - and then watch this watch this
70:53 - we could do this crazy thing if our is
70:56 - is nothing as a string instance of hold
71:00 - on
71:02 - like somebody will know this but test is
71:07 - of instance of strings that false no
71:14 - type of string no somebody will know
71:24 - type of R equals string somebody in the
71:27 - chat bar yeah that make neck wools
71:32 - string then this dot then let C equal
71:42 - color of our and then this dot R equals
71:49 - red of C this G equals green of C this
71:54 - dot I don't know if I'm doing this in
71:56 - the totally craziest way that's the
72:01 - right syntax
72:03 - I like double actually you know that
72:05 - seems like the right syntax
72:06 - yeah and then now oh you did oh you did
72:15 - it here I think you just need the
72:17 - parenthesis hate them too there we go
72:20 - all right hey yeah okay so now you could
72:30 - write whatever functions you want to
72:32 - like change the RGB values oh that's
72:34 - great that's great um cool I'm gonna
72:37 - like take it through the T real fast
72:39 - mhm like just to be sure about this
72:48 - yeah where do you yeah
72:52 - you can you should be able to oh yeah oh
72:57 - oh that's great that's great it's great
72:59 - to know have a we can have a quick
73:04 - function oh I need to like change my
73:08 - position real fast can I keep it in
73:10 - Ritchie I'm gonna move this to another
73:12 - javascript file is that okay
73:14 - the cosy color class yeah yeah go ahead
73:16 - go ahead go ahead
73:17 - that makes sense I I unfortunately like
73:19 - uh like took off like the little side
73:22 - part like the little bar on the sides my
73:24 - like don't know how to bring it back to
73:27 - make a new file there it is
73:29 - class but I will know that it exists
73:33 - how are you fresh the page you'll come
73:36 - back up but either way we're going to
73:38 - say a little huh oh sure sure I
73:45 - like I to let out and like then changed
73:49 - my clipboard we're fine now though ah
73:50 - okay cozy I think cozy color j/s alright
74:03 - we're back and now if we want to add
74:05 - color functionality it's in that other
74:07 - file okay I'm just trying I'm just
74:11 - trying to find out how do I go back to
74:13 - the sidebar thar little control I yeah
74:20 - that's it that's it that's it cool cool
74:21 - cool
74:22 - I just took out the sidebar so I had no
74:24 - idea like were you guys really doing
74:26 - that alright cool so we have that there
74:28 - and then you have like a function
74:29 - gradient color so we can say like uh
74:32 - mind is blanking for a second and so
74:36 - color is out there so we can say um
74:43 - start color that our plus plus this is
74:47 - like pretty simple
75:00 - it's art Culinaire somebody in the chat
75:04 - gave a suggestion to have the to have
75:08 - the the the ark once it finishes to like
75:11 - go back to 0 and I was just adding that
75:13 - really quick idea did you get that yeah
75:21 - so I'm just making an angle target
75:23 - variable okay
75:38 - oh it's gradient Oh whoopsie I need to
75:43 - change up my computer my keyboard
75:47 - unplugs there yeah that's one thing that
75:51 - happens the time not gradient I'm
75:54 - gradient color okay oh oh and then and
76:04 - then I have to get it to go back up yeah
76:06 - yeah yeah again you just set some flags
76:11 - with that so
76:21 - all right - - I'm gonna have to change
76:25 - this down here and say
76:28 - [Music]
76:45 - oh that's like a lot of flags I'll be
76:47 - thinking of by just oh no I was thinking
76:49 - of like how are you doing your bouncing
76:52 - thing yeah you have your friend Nick
76:54 - know you have your boolean stuff like
76:56 - that oh wait oh I want to - I don't
76:58 - think - it for like all the colors all
77:01 - the colors it'll be like six boolean's
77:03 - at least sounds like I think I only do
77:04 - it for our for rent
77:15 - what's that color ro we're gonna say ro
77:22 - to follow your convincing true yeah cool
77:26 - it's that color circle that R is less
77:39 - than C 55 and start color or grow I
77:47 - think I caught a cold
77:48 - um yeah yes it was less than 255 and
77:55 - it's mostly growing we're gonna say
77:57 - start color dot r + + right and it is
78:05 - elseis ah if that color R is less than
78:12 - 255 oh sorry
78:15 - if it's greater than 255 also going to
78:22 - change the gressman or equal to so we go
78:24 - up less than 255 and start color our
78:31 - grow that's when we want to go ahead and
78:36 - be like oh we got a set this negative
78:43 - now so sorry oh I see what you're doing
78:50 - all right
78:51 - well yeah that can be equal to false so
78:53 - that's what we're doing
78:54 - now another way if it's just like
78:57 - incrementation up and down would be to
78:59 - just have a variable like this sort of
79:01 - color speed so the same way you would do
79:03 - like a bouncing ball and then it just it
79:05 - gets to the edge you would say the like
79:07 - our speed our color speed times equal
79:10 - negative 1 and then it would bounce back
79:14 - and forth so much more sense
79:17 - oh yeah but I did it that crazy way it's
79:23 - not a crazy way but I did it the way
79:24 - that you're doing because that's how I
79:27 - did it here with this like angle thing
79:28 - but that was something beautiful I know
79:35 - right um we're gonna say what is it
79:38 - if start color dot R if it's uh what
79:43 - greater than 255 right and they'll say
79:47 - start color grow I quote speed yeah
79:53 - called speed speed is a wrong word but
79:57 - we're gonna find is x equals negative 1
80:01 - right and then um yes is it right if why
80:08 - is it invented no I think it bends will
80:14 - be here naturally and I the chat is
80:17 - suggesting a sine function which would
80:19 - also be an idea but let's keep going
80:20 - with this we can always try that after
80:23 - if it's going to be less than zero then
80:26 - that's we're going to say color one so
80:36 - we can just move this Oh perhaps or
80:42 - disappear and we're gonna say or Jerry
80:49 - yeah yeah yeah I'm silly that's okay and
80:53 - then you're gonna do start colors dot R
80:57 - plus equals that color speed right Oh
81:01 - yep it should be that oh there we go
81:07 - there we go there we go
81:08 - I don't change him back yet yes yes oh
81:15 - that's cool and then we can do it for
81:19 - like I'm thinking is like we can do it
81:25 - for like another card color value too so
81:27 - I'm also going to change us to start
81:29 - color like just be able to start color
81:31 - speed are just like specify that this is
81:33 - like the red yeah yeah yeah okay
81:38 - and interestingly like we could I could
81:40 - also imagine later this
81:41 - actually going into the color class like
81:44 - the color class this head like that's
81:46 - like a bounce color function or
81:47 - something exactly um all right I
81:51 - surprisingly really like this like oh
81:54 - we're good I know I'm with this right
81:55 - now um I'm gonna do though like a
81:58 - gradient for like the other color as
81:59 - well yeah yeah so we can say I think
82:06 - that's a soft color Kate remember yes
82:09 - stop color stop color are and really
82:16 - like
82:18 - same thing same difference
82:29 - we're gonna say x equals negative 1 and
82:32 - we also need go ahead and just smoke and
82:38 - so we got initialize it here's the equal
82:47 - 1 all right there we go um well it
82:53 - doesn't like something and we'll get to
82:56 - that later and to say stop hello stop
82:59 - color dot t I think this supposed to be
83:01 - oh yeah and also then plus equals see
83:12 - that probably dot R is what I mean what
83:15 - people stop I'll see you all right there
83:22 - we go so we should have that changing
83:25 - too oh I like that a lot
83:27 - uh-oh are they both don't I know they
83:32 - did they're kind of like a little bit in
83:34 - sync like what if you changed stop other
83:37 - to use like the green channel or the
83:39 - blue channel yeah you're right you're
83:40 - right you're right
83:41 - so we're gonna change this to well say
83:45 - well use blue I'm gonna say this is Z
83:48 - and then this is going to be God our
83:50 - looks like B and it is kind of tripping
83:53 - me up just a little bit just capital R
83:55 - it's like capital B and then this here
83:58 - and then this here so like that should
84:02 - be fine oh I kind of like that umm and
84:09 - then like I kind of want to also have
84:12 - [Music]
84:15 - too much um I also kind of have like a
84:19 - lot of like these arcs going about so do
84:22 - you want to like throw that in a
84:23 - function too sure
84:25 - okay okay so you can say function late
84:31 - all right
84:32 - oh you mean - like duplicate this like
84:34 - growing and shrinking art yeah yeah for
84:38 - me the way that I typically approach
84:40 - this is by making it a class and then
84:42 - making like an array of our like
84:44 - animated art objects yeah fine let's do
84:47 - that are you going to make a class make
84:54 - a file
84:55 - I'll make yeah I can make another file
84:58 - so I'll make a cozy arc file okay
85:02 - so cozy arc Jas and then I'm adding it
85:06 - to index dot HTML cozy arc Jas and then
85:11 - now I'm in cozy art Dutch I asked the
85:13 - file I'm right cool I'm there too so
85:25 - what I think makes sense is if I take
85:27 - your what you wrote to draw it all of
85:35 - this comes into here whoops in show and
85:42 - then now it needs like an x and y and
85:45 - all these need to be like this dot
85:46 - properties mm-hmm you need all the so
85:53 - like what I if I'm imagining this yeah
86:03 - so they can be at a certain location and
86:06 - then this could be like a size this
86:09 - could be like this dot angle and this
86:12 - dot angle target yeah okay
86:24 - I don't know if you're doing it I was I
86:27 - sure know what okay all right so do what
86:34 - you want me to go with what I'm thinking
86:35 - for a minute okay okay I'm gonna go with
86:38 - what I'm thinking for a minute so I'm
86:39 - gonna take all I'm gonna take the angle
86:41 - variable which is for the arc or no
86:44 - angle is angle for the arc yes yeah an
86:47 - angle target right and I'm gonna put
86:49 - those into cosy arc okay and then and
86:56 - also let angle okay so these are all
87:01 - going in cozy art but instead it's this
87:05 - dot angle this that angle target and
87:11 - this stuff growing and then I also make
87:13 - a like a variable called like amount
87:15 - which would be like for this so now if I
87:20 - just add this dot everywhere everybody
87:22 - knows that all I ever do is talk about
87:23 - this dot this should this should be in
87:38 - this angle here on 13 yeah and the loop
87:44 - and the angle target did I get
87:52 - everything I think he did yeah and then
87:56 - my idea here would be that if we made
88:01 - all Ray also just want to like we should
88:05 - put in like a dis box size to like what
88:08 - you want to have different sizes that
88:09 - leaves yeah I can go for it awesome so
88:13 - I'm gonna make an array and I'm gonna
88:15 - say X dot push new cosy arc and then for
88:28 - I'll loop through all of the arcs and
88:32 - just say arcs
88:36 - so I don't know if you're getting this
88:39 - era but it seemed like something called
88:41 - this project has received too many
88:43 - requests please try again later
88:45 - oh yeah oh because because we're so
88:47 - popular oh I meaning to buy a pro glitch
88:54 - account I wonder if I just need to do
88:57 - what app like to have I mean I assume
89:01 - that's what it is right everybody
89:04 - everybody turned off the project
89:06 - yeah upgrade my account
89:10 - oh that's fix it Oh local machine and
89:16 - use vs code live share delicious ice a
89:19 - timeout after like four thousand
89:21 - requests says somebody in the chat oh
89:24 - well I didn't know that glitch time that
89:26 - I'd refer to thousand requests see wait
89:28 - I'm a navigator for using like a
89:30 - web-based application yeah me too like
89:34 - warrior you know we are also at 4:30 so
89:38 - this was the sort of time we said we
89:40 - were gonna switch ok so we could use
89:43 - this as an opportunity to like I could
89:46 - let you sign off I could kind of wrap up
89:50 - things here and point people to go over
89:53 - to twitch to join I could try upgrade
89:55 - like lipstick out to a pro account and
89:58 - then see if we can like you know we'll
90:00 - have a little break and then I fix it
90:02 - should we try that if it's for drilling
90:05 - on the thought so I do want to give like
90:06 - about like like 15 to like 20 minutes to
90:09 - set up yeah yeah yeah it's for thorn
90:11 - exactly like ok so let me let me try to
90:16 - explain to the audience here what's in
90:18 - theory going to happen and you can first
90:20 - of all let me say a huge thank you to
90:22 - Aaron for joining I have you know I've
90:25 - tried a past to have guests on the
90:29 - coding train and I'm hoping to do more
90:32 - of this in the future so this was
90:33 - something of a bit of a test because in
90:35 - sort of figuring out the tech to do this
90:37 - properly and thank you for bearing
90:39 - bearing with me thank you for all the
90:41 - exciting and wonderful work you're doing
90:42 - on Twitch so what the plan here now for
90:45 - everybody watching is we're going to
90:47 - continue
90:48 - project remains to be seen whether I'll
90:50 - be able to successfully call into Aarons
90:52 - but at a minimum Aaron is going to
90:55 - continue this project on her twitch
90:58 - channel so I should put in somebody if
91:02 - somebody could type this in one of the
91:03 - mods could type this into the tap chat
91:05 - it's twitch dot TV actually I have it
91:07 - right here I'll pull it up
91:08 - it's twitch.tv slash cozy coding oops
91:12 - that's the wrong now they're not sorry I
91:15 - have its twitch.tv slash cozy coding
91:18 - it'll probably be first of all it'll
91:20 - probably be like another four hours
91:22 - while I ramble no I'm gonna stop myself
91:24 - from talking but it'll be at least 15
91:26 - minutes so Aaron is set up there thank
91:30 - you everyone who donated to power plant
91:33 - so Aaron maybe what I should do is I
91:35 - should let you go
91:36 - we're gonna stay query everybody give
91:37 - some rounds of applause and clapping for
91:39 - Aaron in the in the chat and people are
91:44 - posting the link and then I can kind of
91:46 - like vamp here for a little bit to help
91:49 - remind people to head over there and
91:50 - you'll be up and running in about 15
91:52 - minutes and I'll be there as well all
91:54 - right yes sir I'll leave the discord
91:56 - calls okay yeah all right awesome Thank
92:00 - You Aaron with more of this in the
92:01 - future and everybody should if you like
92:02 - this kind of style of improvisational
92:05 - cosy coding which you should I see no
92:07 - reason not to like it you should
92:09 - subscribe and all that stuff to Aaron's
92:11 - channel cuz she's pretty often yeah yeah
92:15 - almost like I would say like three times
92:17 - a week or so yeah yeah and I'm like once
92:19 - every three weeks so you really just
92:21 - just forget about this coding training
92:22 - and go do some cosy coding okay all
92:27 - right okay Thank You Aaron oh I'll see
92:29 - you in like just a short bit over on
92:31 - your channel yeah okay all right so
92:35 - there goes Aaron I'm gonna I'm gonna
92:38 - press that button I'm gonna mute that
92:41 - just in case it comes back okay so I'm
92:43 - here on my own oh it's just like old
92:46 - times on the coding train this the
92:49 - donation button that you see I thank you
92:51 - anonymous for the donation that you see
92:53 - to the left to the right whatever
92:55 - direction is will stay there I don't
92:58 - know about in perpetuity but even after
93:01 - this stream shuts down
93:03 - but again all you have to do and you can
93:05 - see it's actually even here already is
93:08 - go to twitch.tv slash cozy coding so let
93:11 - me see I'm just gonna go over to my
93:12 - camera so this is just me I'm going to
93:15 - attempt I'm gonna stay here for a little
93:19 - bit just in case people have questions I
93:21 - can answer but I'm gonna attempt to
93:22 - upgrade my twitch account but I prefer
93:26 - to do that without their showing you me
93:31 - entering in my like a credit card and
93:32 - all that nonsense
93:33 - so we're I don't even know where do I do
93:35 - this my account upgrade I'll become a
93:44 - glitch member no rate limits apps that
93:47 - stay awake so I'm definitely doing this
93:51 - and here we go but what's firm oh I have
94:02 - to I have to get my secret code for my
94:05 - credit oh and David is asking what are
94:07 - your plans for continuing the remakes of
94:09 - nature of code let me answer that let me
94:14 - address that question hold on I try to
94:22 - get my code like this is this is
94:24 - riveting live-streaming I'm sure for all
94:26 - of you to watch I have a password
94:30 - manager where I also keep a security
94:32 - codes and things for credit cards I'm
94:35 - sure that's exactly what you're
94:36 - interested in knowing about right now
94:40 - okay that's about to speak it I'm just
94:43 - gonna type it in hit confirm oh whoops
94:49 - hold on hold on hold on hold on I did
94:53 - something wrong I want to do it monthly
94:56 - okay give me a second here confirm
95:06 - okay sure
95:13 - putting in my zip code so about the
95:19 - nature of code so I you know I really
95:21 - have to I don't know if I should be
95:22 - apologizing or what I mean I feel like I
95:25 - want to apologize but I think that I
95:27 - have ambitions of I think being in
95:31 - quarantine and being off for the
95:33 - semester I sort of thought that I'd be
95:35 - able to do more than I actually can and
95:37 - some of that is just my own hang-ups and
95:39 - some of that is really just the
95:41 - realities of living at home with two
95:44 - small children who do not have school or
95:46 - Kayla and just sort of like the
95:49 - psychology of that and so I really have
95:52 - been different I having a difficult time
95:55 - focusing energy on making video content
95:58 - and streaming I'm also not as used to my
96:00 - technology and like just sort of a
96:02 - routine of it so and I'm totally frozen
96:05 - here it's and I'm not able to purchase
96:06 - this but hopefully that'll come through
96:07 - but I have a couple of thoughts one
96:10 - thing that I think that I could do is
96:12 - throw myself into the writing of nature
96:14 - of code I think this would be in many
96:16 - ways disappointing for some of you who
96:18 - are really interested in following the
96:20 - videos and livestreams but I have
96:23 - actually been considering taking just
96:24 - saying like I'm taking a month off from
96:26 - doing any video stuff and just working
96:29 - on the writing of the book the rewrites
96:31 - of the book and that would be something
96:33 - that I would share is some of you were
96:35 - supporting as members and you know so
96:38 - that's thing that I'm considering doing
96:40 - but I also would like to see if I also
96:45 - could potentially get this set up I do
96:47 - think that soon I'll have access safe
96:50 - access to the recording studio where I
96:53 - was making those video tutorials I can
96:55 - walk there it's about a 45-minute or
96:58 - hour walk from here I could also take
96:59 - public transportation if that's a thing
97:02 - that makes sense to do and that building
97:05 - will be open and I can probably so
97:08 - that's something I'm sort of like
97:09 - waiting for that if I have more of a
97:11 - routine where my kids are going back to
97:13 - school even if it's just part like
97:15 - halftime I'm their school is very near
97:19 - where the recording setup that I have
97:21 - for those tutorials so that but anyway
97:22 - I'm off too much talking about that that
97:24 - now so Marcos is asking is there ran
97:31 - saying so much content to catch up on
97:33 - yeah
97:37 - oh the bear oh the I'm sorry I was
97:40 - getting a discord message saying I'm by
97:42 - myself in the call and they're
97:43 - disconnecting me to save bandwidth so a
97:48 - Mason wants to know if I can make more
97:49 - processing tutorials there's so many
97:52 - things for me to do and I'm having a
97:54 - little bit of a difficult time focusing
97:57 - energy and keeping like basically like
98:01 - I'm like answering my email like that's
98:04 - mostly what I'm doing and working on
98:06 - figure out some plants or NYU ordinarily
98:09 - I wouldn't have any sort of like guilt
98:11 - or anxiety over this because I would
98:14 - just say you know what I think I'm gonna
98:15 - take the summer off from video stuff and
98:16 - be back at it in the fall maybe I'll do
98:18 - a couple coding in the Cabana videos
98:20 - which is something that I can do you
98:21 - know at home but I you know this I do
98:25 - have people who sign up to be members
98:27 - and it conceivably there supporting make
98:29 - the making of the content so I might
98:30 - like to shift that towards the writing
98:33 - of the book and maybe I'll discuss that
98:35 - the discord I know whatever I say people
98:37 - are like we support you whatever you
98:39 - want to do it's mine so I really
98:40 - appreciate that and everybody's saying
98:43 - that in the chat as well so I do
98:46 - appreciate that but the things that I
98:50 - would like to do this summer I would
98:52 - like I did those like late night shows I
98:54 - would like to get back and maybe try it
98:55 - another quick round of that cuz it was
98:57 - fun to work on the discord bot the Hugh
98:59 - I I have it working that I could control
99:01 - these hue lights that are behind me from
99:02 - node so I want to keep working on all
99:04 - that stuff the overlay stuff I know that
99:06 - Coby has been helping me with that so
99:08 - we'll see
99:09 - i as of now just in terms of like
99:11 - updates about the coding trans schedule
99:13 - for the summer I definitely plan to be
99:15 - gone for the whole month of August what
99:17 - gone means I don't know yet but I'm kind
99:20 - of using that month as a sort of family
99:22 - vacation it might be a staycation we'll
99:24 - sort of see and possibly the last week
99:26 - of July so right now I'm looking at the
99:28 - month the next couple weeks in June in
99:30 - some weeks in July of working on the
99:32 - book
99:32 - make encoding in the Cabana I've got
99:35 - lots of other things that I'm working on
99:37 - that are you know more for my day job at
99:38 - NYU I do have this project I was working
99:41 - on with Joey Lee actually let me bring
99:42 - that up right now
99:43 - I'll take a break in and and and try to
99:46 - figure out how to subscribe to glitch it
99:47 - just like completely crash my browser
99:49 - and I can't even I don't know why this
99:53 - is not working so I'm just gonna like
99:55 - force quit Chrome for a second Oh
100:01 - Roberto Oh Roberto I think this is the
100:04 - Roberto that I know it's asking the time
100:06 - I'm having trouble with rotating an
100:08 - image about ten degrees counterclockwise
100:09 - oh yes
100:10 - tech explorers so I recently met Roberto
100:14 - let's give a little plug to Roberto oops
100:19 - and I've got the hold on I've got the
100:20 - discord up so let me did not mean to
100:24 - open that up for a second that was a
100:27 - direct message with Jason who was making
100:30 - the cozy coding design so let me let me
100:36 - open this up here first let's let me
100:38 - mention tech explorers Brooklyn which is
100:41 - a local after-school a center it has a
100:45 - bunch of like camping things there I met
100:47 - Roberto Joseph is in the chat who is the
100:49 - founder director co-director apologies
100:52 - we get Iran of a text Boers broke
100:54 - Brooklyn so let me ask we have a new
100:57 - member
100:57 - hi Kevin see after all that like I'm
101:00 - gonna stop making content somebody
101:01 - joined what are you doing oh look at the
101:03 - planks the new member blinks so I got to
101:05 - get more stuff going with that with the
101:06 - hue lights okay ten degrees
101:08 - counterclockwise when the mouse is
101:10 - pressed and needed to go back to the
101:11 - original position okay so what I would
101:14 - say very briefly I got to get back to
101:18 - somebody keep an eye Ken can somebody in
101:21 - the discord chat violet Kobe Marcos
101:24 - Simon keep track of how Aaron is doing
101:27 - because I want to make sure I shut
101:29 - myself down and send everybody over to
101:31 - Aaron's stream as soon as she is ready
101:35 - but I the reason why I'm continuing to
101:38 - go is I don't want everybody to leave
101:39 - and have nowhere to go I want everybody
101:40 - to go to Aaron's stream so let's look at
101:42 - this little problem for a let's do a
101:43 - little debugging for
101:45 - Roberto so let's say I have an angle and
101:47 - I set it equal to zero and I use
101:51 - translate to get to the center of the
101:56 - window and I draw a rectangle at zero
101:59 - zero that's 100 comma 50 and let's just
102:08 - give it a color of blue and let's say
102:12 - wrecked mode Center and we're gonna say
102:15 - rotate by that angle so it should be
102:22 - that if I change this angle to 45 and
102:24 - say angle mode degrees it should be
102:31 - rotated 45 degrees okay now actually
102:33 - this is perfect we can do exactly what I
102:35 - just did with Aaron with lurk so I could
102:37 - also have a target angle which is zero
102:45 - and I could say on mousepressed if
102:52 - target if angle I'm just gonna say if
102:56 - it's like less than 46 set target angle
103:01 - oh no sorry if it is less than one set
103:04 - target angle equal to 4 - let me just
103:10 - start at zero and have the target angle
103:13 - be a zero set it equal to 45 else if
103:16 - angle is greater than like 44 that means
103:20 - it's 45 target angle this there I'm sure
103:23 - there's a more elegant way to do this
103:24 - equals zero so if I run this every time
103:27 - I click the mouse it should be changing
103:29 - target angle let's just see if that's
103:31 - the case console.log target angle right
103:40 - 45 45 mmm why is it not going to zero if
103:45 - it's less than 1 Oh cause it's the angle
103:49 - silly me
103:51 - I'm just changing the target angle
103:53 - there's a much more elegant way of doing
103:55 - this if it equals zero so it's a 45
103:59 - otherwise set it to zero and still I'm
104:02 - sure this could be improved so let's do
104:05 - this 45 0 45 zero and then i can use
104:08 - lurk
104:09 - so remember lerp if I say angle equals
104:12 - lurk angle to target angle by some
104:16 - amount like 0.5% now when I click the
104:20 - mouse it'll go to 45 back to 0 45 back
104:26 - to zero and if I want it to be like a
104:27 - really fast transition I could make it
104:29 - like 20% they'll give it a nice little
104:33 - like nudge there and of course if I
104:36 - wanted it to be instant Oh Erin is
104:39 - calling so let me answer this call I
104:45 - have to figure okay okay
104:50 - I'm think I'm simultaneously online
104:53 - talking to Erin while I'm still lifes
104:57 - Erin I'm still streaming and when you're
104:58 - ready I'll switch people over okay but
105:04 - I've lost track of what I'm doing
105:06 - because I can't figure out where I am
105:08 - there's so many scribe so many screens
105:10 - and things I can't get on yet but I can
105:13 - hear you as well okay so okay great so
105:16 - you'll let me know
105:17 - I'm just vamping and doing other like a
105:19 - goofy stuff while we're waiting for you
105:21 - to be set up that I'm going to send
105:22 - everybody over to twitch okay
105:27 - so but I've lost the Chad and everything
105:31 - I need another monitor I guess okay all
105:38 - right all right
105:40 - so that was Roberto's question oh now I
105:44 - hear Erin okay I hear you but I can hear
105:48 - you can you hear me
105:53 - sorry I know I'm debugging with Erin
105:57 - YouTube people
106:03 - no they can't nobody on my stream can
106:08 - see or hear you just me
106:10 - oh are you is she streaming Oh everybody
106:19 - Aaron is already streaming so everybody
106:22 - should now head over there so I'm gonna
106:25 - put up a sign
106:37 - I think Aaron is streaming so head to go
106:42 - to twitch.tv can someone confirm that
106:50 - for me oh this is so confusing I have so
106:58 - many things in my ear and so many
106:59 - screens I'm looking at I'm lost the live
107:03 - chat oh okay
107:04 - Aaron I can't confirm Aaron started
107:06 - streaming so you should go there
107:44 - you

Cleaned transcript:

check check audio check one two you can all hear me hello my mic was muted good afternoon good morning good evening good bill of the night I don't know when you're watching this welcome to the coding train with me I'm Dan Shipman now this is a very special livestream I haven't been around livestreaming very much actually I to be honest haven't felt like it very much things are busy things are chaotic and there's a lot going on in the world and especially here in New York City I live in Brooklyn New York and not too far from the Barclays Center and on my mind are the issues around police violence in the city on my mind are the protesters who are out raising their voice against racism and police violence and I wanted to I've been trying to focus some energy and time on supporting some of my students from NYU who have been out protesting and participating and local community organizations so our first thing I know people are making comments about my beard so first thing I want to say is black lives matter and I want to tell you about an organization that this particular live stream is supporting now let me see I'm I've got a lot of like new technical set up for today and thank you of Derek Morris who's made our first donation I want to switch to my computer screen which you're about to see and we've got another donation from anonymous thank you and let me switch right here laptop okay so now you're seeing my fancy computer screen without my camera in it and I'm gonna open up the web browser and I'm gonna talk about Aaron who's our guest today in a minute oh and you all know my dog Gloria I closed all the doors to the room that I'm in because I don't want to be bothered and unfortunately she wants to get out okay Gloria come on good girl there you go good girl look at a camera on her later for all of you who are interested okay I'm to switch over to power plant so power plant is an organization they're located in Bushwick Bushwick Brooklyn they connect teams and with established artists on free interestdriven digital art projects and educational programs they advocate that access to technology is a right and not a privilege now I actually was first introduced I realize this too power plant a year ago and let me see if I can get my camera going here I'm gonna Aaron there's a small chance you're gonna appear but I don't think so ah no you didn't I have you off but your audio is on I can if you talk they'll hear you that's Aaron Berger I was gonna do a really dramatic and huge introduction to bring Aaron on knife I've messed that all up but the processing foundation as as I probably talked about runs a fellowship program so let me briefly try to find the 2019 fellows because here we go fellows 2019 so a year ago just about from from today or around now I was the mentor for Matilda Matilda who you're seeing on the screen right now is a trans or ghen Iser programmer an artist with an interest in building tech infrastructure for organizing within and across boundaries problematizing are catastrophic notion of community and contributing the systems to uproot unjust socioeconomic system so Matilda is fantastic and they taught were a workshop to trans and gender nonconforming youth and you know it's nice to bring this up also this is Pride Month here in June so there's a lot of wonderful causes and communities to support but so Matilda taught this workshop on digital literacy and privacy and coding at power plant so I was visited there when the workshop was running and it didn't didn't make that connection till just a week ago or actually just the other day but a week ago I learned about what power plant is doing in terms of supporting the black lives matter move and protesters in New York so there you can see here on their website they are there in Bushwick they are operating as a rest space and offering access to computers WiFi and a printer they're also a donation dropoff center shall a group of students from anyways ITP program and and and friends and family of theirs organized a whole collection of donations to drop off their their teaching workshops on digital security protest safety surveillance I actually have some projects I'm working on related to security and surveillance in photos and images so maybe I'll come back later this we can do another livestream on that it's not what today um so you can you can donate to support power plant through their website I'm right in front of it right now but there's a donate button on the on their website itself but on YouTube and thank you David Schneider I'm not sure I'm catching all these donations but I'll try to shout them out when I do YouTube also you through one of the features I have for my channel is the YouTube Giving Program so any 501c3 nonprofit organization I can attach as a fundraiser to I've done this if you recall a couple times at least once for the processing foundation and there are many other fundraisers going on right now on YouTube and one of the things that I'm attempting to do and I think it's something that you can do as well if you're looking for ways that you can make a difference there are many large organizations that need your support but something that often gets missed are smaller local organizations that can really use just a volunteer time donations of food and supplies as well as money so powerplant is local it's not my immediate neighborhood but local to Brooklyn where I live I do wanna mention that there are a bunch of other I did in trying to figure out to fundraise there were several other organizations that I've been talking to and also try to support in my own work I mean it's a little tricky to get them added to the YouTube system and I was so lucky enough to get powerplant write up but I do want to just mention a quick shoutout to a to others code cooperative and maybe I can do a fundraiser for them later code cooperative is a really amazing organization that is a community of people who learn use and build technology to create lifechanging possibilities for individuals and communities impacted by car serration so you can volunteer and donate and they actually have a mentorship and a hiring program thank you science club for your donation so one thing I just wanted to mention here is if you're looking to hire go check out code cooperative I think it's here under the agency that they are basically they partner industry experts with formerly incarcerated technologists so something that we can do to help fight against you know mass incarceration is and and and help support people who have been incarcerated is through organizations like code cooperative particular former community so they're fantastic and I also was going to mention the Marci lab school which is a a school an organization that that runs programs for youth and that is really fantastic and does a lot of really excellent work that I would encourage you to check more about on their website under their programs that they run and you can see a bunch of their attendees of their fellows so this is really also I highly encourage you to check out Marci lab so maybe I could do more of these fundraisers for some of these other other organizations okay another donation from anonymous alright so that's my that's a bit of my opening spiel here for today I I certainly would subscribe to this statement access to technology as a right not a privilege I'm very lucky in so many ways in my life in terms of how I've had access to equipment and an audience and education and anything that I could do to help provide that for others I think YouTube is a platform that allows me to do that in one way it certainly leaves certain people out people are interested in watching me leaves people out perhaps and so something that I'm really trying to do through my work is also encourage other people to teach and stream and create with creative coding tools and technology so well someone that I really want to highlight for you today if I go back to the Fellowship's now I'm back on to the 2020 fellowships and I'm gonna bring her on her camera on right now let's see if this works very exciting you ready Aaron okay Aaron's cameras there now hi and so I'm Aaron I'm gonna let Aaron really introduce herself but I met Aaron in person actually at the i/o festival err goal on Levin and introduced me to Aaron I guess were you where you go on student in a class or you just know him from you oh wow yeah I'm like I've known him since like a freshman year and like like I remember I having a huge story like when the first times I met him I was telling him um thinking of like transferring design and then he wanted huge rent saying how I shouldn't chanson to design and stay with art and that was my like first interactions oh and golems in the chat so first can I read about Aaron I just saw Golan wrote hey Aaron can everybody hear Aaron cuz I want to make sure my technology is set up correctly and audio quality is okay it's gonna take I'm it's gonna take a little bit but hopefully people are saying they love your room I'm ready to reverse my video because it looks like I'm looking away from you but when I look this direction I'm looking exactly at you I think it's gonna mirror my video how long is that a enable preview Oh while you're talking I'll try to switch my video people also they like your keyboard okay oh so so let me uh but I have to do my prepared remarks which aren't actually prepared cuz anybody's watch the coding train knows that I prepare absolutely nothing as you can tell by my very awkward attempts to use my voice to support black lives matter but I I do want to I do really want to do that to the extent that I can okay so Aaron is a fellow for processing Foundation and her proposal I remember reading it and being really excited by it because it was about how I should let you speak to this but I'm gonna give you my own characterization of it and you could correct me if I got it wrong but I know Aaron is someone who has been interested in code and technology and learned a lot on her own and was really didn't necessarily see when she was learning especially in high school role models are people for her to find online who were doing what she was doing and so she wanted to maybe be that person for somebody else through streaming as well she also talked a bit about how like rather than do streams a lot of my content are sort of like curricular tutorial to trick Euler curriculum tutorials yeah so it's like follow this playlist of videos where I or you know teacher person will talk at you and lecture and explain stuff and that has that has value hopefully people obviously I found it through the channel and learned to code I do do some more improvisational and sort of fun coding on my streams but I think what what what really resonated with me and Erin's proposal was this idea of what's like this sort of like fun hangout session where you can learn about coding see creative projects and that's really what you wanted to do in it kind of cosy way to read there with her stream so I got a shut up a glad you jump again and so well I'm gonna try to reverse fix up some of my tech stuff err maybe you could talk about your your journey and to learning to code what it's been like for you you know at CMU and what you're doing with your twitch channel okay okay yeah yeah I think like Oh something guys does anyone is saying about like um oh it feels so weird because I don't usually have this many audience but yeah I think it's one thing I want to mention was I in the proposal I physically said like oh I want this to be like um it's like coding train with your professors like lectures and stuff like that I want my code decoding to be like that cool TA and I was like friends with your older siblings you know and like they know what's up but also like they kind of are just relaxed and I could trouble with trying to get through college just like you so yeah um I guess I can say like like about me yeah so I'm Erin I really like hexagons that's my thing that's my steel besides like very cozy and comfortable things um I go to cranky though and right now and I'm like in the weird like senior row of my graduation I took this semester off like before I knew coronavirus would happen and I try to varios happen yeah that was like the best call I probably say my whole academic career it's fine I'm kidding this better calls but yeah um yeah so when doing this with Jameis mr. Dolph I was like I want to apply for the fasting fellowship because we like really cool to have like these more like interactive coding tutorial which into like up like the coding chain because it'll be like more fun if I can I talk to the chauchat and like also interact with my viewers and stuff like that and like it'd be like a bit more like personal so to speak like like I assumedly she's going it's like having with no plan for sure I just kind of take a like topic oh and like from the p5.js reference and I'm just like that's what we're gonna do today guys and just tend to go off with it and like everyone like I was like how to plan a bit like um maybe I'll they kind of go into mind that like here's how I should attack this like say like a problem and go ahead and like you know create this project but usually everything is just like up in the air like like like like hey sometimes you would see me just like completely like get stuck on this one problem you kind of see me get like super tiny but that's okay we're all getting like tired together the people I'm alpha editor has it's not alpha anymore so it's not like that the people I went by the editor has I crashed on me both of the times you see my despair in there oh well yeah it's a good time um yeah like I said mostly what I'm doing right now because you know it's a coronavirus o'clock like what else do you suppose to do I'd like to stay at home and like stream I listen to a lot of podcasts I guess I work on my hexagon library like once in a while I'm getting back into it at least and like now it's like I've like settled in the coronavirus groove I'm some time straight I'm gonna like like streaming like me working on it at least yeah Lily bass about it yeah awesome Thank You Erin for that awesome shirt so I want to address just a couple questions that came up in the chat and then we'll get started with the coding stuff so some people were oh and thank you go on for your donation where's my bell Colin's what you know it's funny like this this is very silly but like sometimes I can like I can create the illusion for myself that nobody is actually watching this or nobody act that I know is watching it's it's like oh there's a person that I know it's goal I'm like oh my god all of my flaws are there here for the world to see but anyway so I want to mention so a couple had asked about audio and video quality for Aaron so I what the way that I've got this working right now and apologies if it's not perfect is I'm on a discord to call with her video call with her and the audio and the video are coming in from that so so I think it's it's good enough but I would love any feedback or maybe if I do more of this kind of guest stuff I'll come back and improve it for the next time around but what I'm going to tell you is that in about an hour or sooner or later somewhere around there we are actually going to switch over we're gonna move this whole everybody watching we're all gonna move over to twitch.tv slash cozy coding and watching it resting and I knew audio and video quality will improve from from Aaron's because it'll be direct streaming from her location so it's this is the thing I actually a couple people I know that Kobe and and David who have that you've been using their experimental chat tool and yeah Steve for your donation I forgot to mention that I was planning to match these donations up to $500 so I don't know where we are right now with the total but if we can get up to 500 ollars for the total that I will be matching that donation myself just to encourage you it doesn't look like I needed to encourage people too much because people are donating and I really appreciate that and also like I realize a lot of you watching you you don't have the means to donate or maybe actually for some of you you might not actually even be able to in terms of what YouTube the Google commerce system allows in your local area but you can find other ways to support and certainly if you want to join the coding train discord and if there are ways we can talk about how the coding train community can support black lives matter that's a place to have that discussion okay now there were some other questions I got one so one person asked how do you apply for the processing fellowship so the processing fellowship and maybe let me say a couple things of them maybe Aaron can talk about her experience doing that but I what I will just say very briefly is if you go to processing org sorry processing foundation org slash fellowships which is what I have up on the screen right now we usually do the open call for the fellowships around November so stay tuned come back and look on this fall as well as subscribe to probably processing org on Twitter Aaron what was it like oh and Kate holla but look at these people that I sort of that I know I mean I know cake that's like thank you for your donation this is amazing Aaron what was it like for you to apply to do how do you define that process huh okay so I found it on like Twitter at least because like I knew I was going to take the semester off so I save up a bit and I was like oh shoot like what am I gonna do at least and then I saw I think it was Lauren that like posted on like Twitter saying like oh yeah we're having like open call for like associates no like all right oh why like why not you know I've got nothing going on and like I said it's like a couple of like recently like thinking of what to do and then like I think like two days before the due date it just all came to mind I was like that's it okay like stretch together like an application and I was like yeah it's like it's like twitch it's a coding train on Twitch but it's more casual and then like it was great and then like it seemed like the board like really loved it and then like yeah I did like some interviews and stuff like that I physically acts like dad as I mentor subways and just toting train and like it's like quite in a similar vein you know so like I thought though be a SAN mentor and you can do like a lot of things besides just like you know things like this doesn't have to be like all out there like I know that someone like someone else is doing I think like p5 p5.js tutorial than like Africa and everyone is doing like p5 and processing for like elder ease like elderly people in Korea and look like a couple more you know I think last year someone was working on the like getting their release of the p5 editor so it doesn't have to be like outreach like this it could also be something like internal where you kind of want to like improve processing and p5 itself you know ya know and Olivia just gave a donation hi olivia.olivia is watching Olivia I also met introduced by Golan at IO Festival yeah what's the thing I wanted to mention about the processing fellowships is so we run a bunch of different programs actually what's going on what's going on right now a program we run but we participate in its google Summer of Code and which is a way that if you're a university student undergraduate or graduate student you can apply to work on an opensource project over the summer and get paid and get paired with a mentor but some of these programs and this isn't necessarily a criticism of them but it's important to mention that really are specifically for people writing code and doing development work on opensource projects and from my point of view and I think I can say from the processing foundation point of view it's really important to support and fund projects that have to do with community education inclusion and so sometimes these it's easy to forget the importance of just things we do to to come together as a community to educate each other and so the fellowship program is really a way that you can apply for to get funding and mentorship for a project that's not just about like writing a code library although you can also write a code library and also I don't I hate that I'm even describing it this way because those are not separate things right the act of creating an opensource library is the act of building a community and and and it's just it's it's it's more important I would say and it's something that I think that I all you know I'm not saying I succeed at this but I always try to keep in mind with the kinds of things that I work on is how has access to this who's left out of this and how can we do better to to bring more people in to feel welcome and included and they can participate so I've been told by breaking news I have my by ridiculous breaking I'm trying not to use my sound effects today but and I it doesn't even work right now oh wait where's my breaking news here hold on breaking news we have hit our dollar okay thank you everybody keep donating one of the reasons why I wanted to do the matching donation is I don't know how actually takes for the sort of like systems that donation the YouTube system to be able to get them collect the money do all the stuff and get it to power plant so I'll be I'll make that donation today so they'll have some funds for the work that they're doing right now to act as a sanctuary space for protesters okay so next oh so what you can't see Aaron that I also brought up one of the thing that I love and I haven't caught every single minute of Aaron streams but I've watched I would say at least half of them and the the just the sheer like sort of colorful creative designs that come out of each of her playful experiments are really fun and beautiful and unique and so I have up on the screen right now just the sort of thumbnails from your last three streams so people can kind of see and so I think this is and I mean to put it on code pens but I haven't gotten around to yet either I'm gonna like like set an alarm for myself and like you bet like that's like I think I'll do it like in between like when we go to your stream and to my stream like like in that like time I'll just like slap one code pen real fast you know and I'm like release it yeah yeah epic oh I'll do awesome so I think I'm gonna try I'm table where I talk too much and I do this in a lot of aspects of my life as my children are like we have something to say to you know so I'm gonna try what I'd like to do now is I'm gonna switch over to the glitch page and I'm gonna let you take it from here and I'm gonna I should just mute myself I won't mute myself but I'm gonna I'm gonna try to move into the sidelines and let you start your cosy coding and I can answer any questions and participate in hopefully not messed things up okay No No please please feel free to like go ahead and like you know do whatever because this missamma collab at least you know I view this as a collab so I kind of just like both doing this together in this project together it's how I view it so if you want to go ahead and yeah so like gosh I didn't know what I want to do like if you guys can't see my screen cuz like right now I'm just going over to me like p5 reference that for this that's that um let's see what see and I'm kind of like a looking at lips I usually sight like a freight stream I just go ahead and look and say like ah what thing do I wanted to work on today and like I saw that like there and like typing like textalign at least like this I start typing like text things and I just like you know I haven't necessarily touched upon texts really yet so I might do something like that um but like I always found that text is like a little bit limiting whoo let's see let's see let's see let's see what the reference has protects all right place mostly have like text align text leading um what is oh you got kid no yeah but you can I can always pull something up so if there's something I think it's actually in a way it's sort of use well yeah I can pull something yeah yeah um no no I'm just like going super idea with this but I feel like going ahead and like using text of it cause like I don't necessarily like I just haven't agreement a lot uhoh uhoh I lost Erin's audio hold on Erin do you hear me shoot it was all going so well how many technical problems okay you you you code but why did I lose your audio did something happen on your end perhaps let's check sorry everybody a little technical difficulty here let me go to our video call you're muted Aaron I see you as muted I did not definitely there's a Defen setting oh yeah I think I see that I know but I don't we've put on some music here just like ease the awkwardness a little bit anybody in touch with her messaging her on discord I have too many things open okay let me just go to this for a second talk amongst yourself everybody okay are you hearing me right on that if you hear me please type okay wait this is great now we've got something we're doing here ah I've got you it's always my fault the technical problems I always I'm glad I'm glad no we're back and I usually don't press it but because the keyboard is different and it's easy to press with one no we're good we're good I've lost the chatting program okay ten oh it's the music too loud oh dear oh no no no it's good I turned the music off I should play some nice relaxing music this will be better I just think it's like I was typing whatever is going on and like thing is like when it deferens and discord deferens it would like play like a loud noise you know they tell you that you got deafened but it didn't play this time I screwed up my audio alright alright this was fun oh so we didn't hear a lot of what you were Sarah just but it's okay just don't worry about repeating yourself and then it was just like I see I a glance over her phone but she's muted and I was like oh oh no and then it's like it's funny I mean doesn't realize I'm just like oh no well all's well that ends well okay you can come here we're bad Koby in the chat and the disk or chat rightz this is the perfect representation for both of their streams to be honest and i would have to say oh that's about right actually the time like is that time where i like drink drink water like a chokes for like the solitude live like i couldn't do anything about it you know playing it t5i veterinary eats my toes this is this stream this is what you expected you heard aviaries thanks all right moving on great so I'm just gonna wrap it up I'm like one second yeah so I was saying my Texas I don't usually use text like I don't know right like what to do I don't know video that p5 text at least pod okay and that's it I'm just remembering back to thinking I couldn't hear you so I thought you just like didn't say anything I thought you must be dry it off like that no I'm here I'm here okay all right so um cool so like I don't like I was asking you if I'm Tina Google Fonts works in oe5 editor at least um so I know you can we I know you can set a font yeah and I know that Google Fonts has fonts and the question in my mind I believe it does we might have to do something goofy and CSS but I I've never tried this so it's certainly something we could try yeah yeah cuz I know if you go to be reference and if you check um like the text font and you look like um I think the second example it says function preload and you can like load spots there's like a load function yeah yeah so I'm doing right now mmm well certainly it it would work to download the font if it's the correct format OTF for example whatever that is I should know but I don't open type I guess open type format maybe and then we could upload it to glitch and then be able to load it that way okay okay I'm like the tricky thing about this is this is one thing that does require other browser pages besides the the glitch sketch itself so it's a little hard for me to show like you looking around for a font that you like but you can look and then when you find it you could tell me yeah yeah yeah I'm like I'm just like going towards the API I'm like you can like import a style you know to like HTML um like I wanna I see some of the chat so like you can pass like the URL when I'm trying to see if I couldn't like maybe maybe it's gonna work brookies I'm just gonna drop it in there and see what happens who knows it all right I'm just gonna get like a regular one and and Sam and just gonna copy this and therefore to use fonts you have to have a preload which is like our our setup setup okay look I'm not typing that code isn't that cool I'm showing my hands and probably just like a string I put that in there see what happens oh shoot it like autofill strings sugar that purrs me off all the time and it's like oh no what do I not know that's right it looks right to me yeah yeah but like it looks like it's sucking like loading purgatory like oh well oh I see what you mean so yeah like like it's uploading but like it can't get it you know what I mean like that's happened to me before look working like p5 let me sing my things no just say boating for like ever and I will never finish so we got an unsupported OpenType signature at parse buffer we got like a weird error that I'm showing on the screen right now in the console yeah well I would say maybe it makes more sense to download and upload the font I do have another sort of like idea though which is that one way that sort of you know I think sometimes the way type there's like that question that you were asking this of like well why do I want to work with type what I'd like to do is make geometric patterns and work on animations and color so one thing that you can do with type is just consider it like a shape like the same way you would draw squares but so you could create an entire design that's all just squares and then at the last moment basically change every square to like a letter form so we kind of like put the font stuff off for later and just sort of like bring that hang later that makes sense okay and I was actually going to tell you when you said you're going to download it and then reupload it that's like the cool thing about glitch cuz he sees like where little expenses assets yeah you can like just drop like your files in there and then when you dropped your files in there you can like load it from like the assets folder like you essentially just say say like Flash assets and then flash like I have a file name in so you don't have so it's all like contained online you know what I mean people people are joining I see like chat messages from people on glitch like can I join but I think for right now I'm going to leave this glitch sketch just for Aaron and me to have typing privileges in but certainly what we'll do when this finishes is publish it and let people make their own versions of it yeah yeah okay yeah and I don't know if you heard me I think my key vines am I gonna turn it off right now I think I accidentally triggered it um what I was saying was is that um what you can do is like you can see all those like the assets oh yes yes yes yeah yeah you can go ahead and you can just like um you can go ahead and like upload the font there and this word whenever you want you can say flash assets and then flash the font name and therefore it should load from there so therefore you're like our whole project including like that's downloaded like assets are like well downloaded assets are like online so I'm also discovering something else Oh God which is that you this URL that you pasted in is like the URL for the CSS that would allow you to incorporate the font so it's not actually the font itself but in there I found what I believe is the URL to the actual font file I'll be this and that didn't work either okay but no unsupported type okay um that's like fine because I didn't download the font package local I compute it perfect oh if I could find the file Sam and then I'm just going to go ahead I'm adding I'm adding a little bit of extra code that I believe we need I just put an asset in there so we're going to go out and delete this mess of a string got it and then we're gonna say I think it's flash assets and then flash I don't know what the assets actually called ah Roboto mono regular dot t TF yeah so I'm gonna go ahead and go into my sketch and paste it and hopefully did gosh it should what let's see unsupported OpenType signature not hold on let's rerun the only reason I took PT yes yeah yeah yeah um peopIe pasty TS hmm that's right do I have like an action no I think it's finding the file because it's not a 404 error like if I misspell it when I misspell that and then refresh it no oh no that's for now there was a 404 oh it's it's 404 it is hold on let's okay reg you right let's see they put it back refresh yeah it's giving a 404 error gosh darn it um someone's at son OTS it can be a TTS so that's just fine because I'm looking at the records right now and says well as an OpenType followup spot bio OTS how much ETF come on follow URL um I returned to p5 on object alright ah why don't you maybe with you want to move on and start making some other stuff I can look into this font thing and see if I can get it to fix okay um that's fine this is the beauty of like you know what's the cause a creative coding at least fully clothed code because someone can be buggy well another person can do that whatever it okay so um we're going to say you're gonna put the text stuff into the mortal coil and then I'm also going to like comment that out the lease I have like some I have something why oh all right it's like the preload I think the whole preload function is probably clogging it up so I will just comment out my whole preload function and let's see what happens all right I hear in the plate making sure I actually think Stefan myself even though I turned off all right um honestly let's start with shapes that's like the most basic part of like p5 it's shaped like what else are you gonna do besides draw shapes text I don't know so if we go to so it's like actually oh I haven't like done anything with arcs yet and that I'm kind of like I can't wait to do I don't know why I just haven't done anything so we're gonna say like we're gonna put in the middle what's / height / and what else never arcs with of the arch by just default okay so just like yeah we can just give that a number that's like a bear radius we're gonna say like 100 and 100 and what else we need we need a start and a stop so we're gonna say 0 & 1 II see cool um well well that that ain't 90 degrees uh you need to change it's doing it radians by default okay you can use an angle mode to change that it's funny because I who's it gonna sound like but back when I had to like walk whatever through the snow to school or whatever is like the idea of angle mode degrees was a thing that didn't exist in in processing so I my brain has been tuned to think in radians but most people are more comfortable with thinking in degrees oh darn young and yes I always forget I didn't have an angle mode degrees when I was growing up okay um let's see oh I know that the mode is like interesting because we can have they have the the extra two parameters or mode in detail and it's like determine the way of the Archaea that corridor pie or it's open and I like just like core it is just like you know the court itself pie is like it shaped like a pie now corn is like it can visualize draw the line from like the start to like the end at least so it's not white it like completes the border if I recall and like actually you know and sometimes just like vaguely describing it I might as well just show it the HRD I spelled that wrong yeah it goes like that which kind of I kind of liking that a little bit um that watching me like Highness on the play around with because like what if he had just like a little like for loop for I addressed them like 360 and like I and then I'm just going to go ahead and deal it I'm just gonna throw that out here what I have I'm like doing recently I've been reading a book called a clean code and it's just saying to you like how you're like code should be like you know clean and all neat and stuff like that and then I go to like here there is this lovely format this file button what which was mom yeah yeah and I'm like I go to like here at least oh silly that's right I forgot it's in like the draw loop I'm thinking I got the font to work you got the pot to work well I I don't so this is somebody in the chat I believe the name is Dov Jonny H maybe yes I I can't remember who suggested Oh Jonny H had a suggestion but anyway if you if I click in assets and then click on the uploaded thing I get a URL of like where that file is and I want the full I don't know if this is how you're supposed to do it but it didn't give me an error so okay so that that's easy oh I love what you just did Oh what's the chord yeah yeah yeah yeah oh that's so cool I go to like 360 we're just gonna like I did go to zero flap up and you're missing a double equals there or a triple equals totally correct my screen is tiny I need to like dude I'm gonna like do a bit like force a string there we go that can be much easier for me now I also want to like see the chat too and stuff so yeah there so we can have that um oh you know I've been like meaning okay I wasn't excited mean to play around with a bit of like easing functions but I recommend using functions are like a bit like annoying to start annoying to implement yeah I have one which file of my life if you want there is one that you can do that makes it really really simple and quick if you haven't tried it before which is just using like the lerp function is a really quick way to do if you wanted to do a quick easing from 0 to 360 oh yeah that makes sense actually have you ever used lerp before uh yeah I've used lip but I use lip color and then I didn't think of using lip as an easing function but that makes that yeah maybe I'm I also might not be using the term easing correctly what I think of how I'm doing it with lerp yeah using the time easing correctly looking at now I'm just like no I'm not sure yeah I don't think you can use left with an easing function you just get like a value like in between the start and end point yes but so can I can I show you what I mean real quick I'm gonna comment this out and if I say I equals lerp pi comma 360 if I just put one in there it's gonna be 360 immediately cuz it goes all the way there like a hundred percent of 360 if I put zero oh wait I think you doing oh and then so this should be like this yeah yeah yeah oh that that kind of makes sense oh I didn't realize that make sense cause it constantly changing you right cuz you're going you're going you're going half way you know half way then half way of that then half way of that so it's like you're starting fast it's not like a son like traditionally easing would be like a sine wave probably but it it has a quality to it it's close enough you know what I mean yeah I'm also gonna throw in like no fill oh I need to tell you I don't think I told you of like way for like deciding what color palette like Hawaii the victims website called cooler Co olor SCO random pallet generator oh it's so cool I don't cool I just pulled it up yeah and then you can learn it and then you can like hit space to just generate a random pallet and I just like go off you know I know yeah like sometimes I like played games myself or is like okay um I have to like use the first pallet that comes up unless it's like yellow cuz I hate yellow so like I don't put you I don't even do anything with yellow in it a lorry in the chat is asking can you explain the lerp function okay okay um I can I can do that so like um what can you poke the whip reference young cool just what I like Elise showed would scream cool so like what lip does it basically takes in like three arguments and it takes them as like a beginning point a being a number and end number and then a number between 1 and between 0 and 1 and essentially that like number between late 0 and 1 is like the distance between the start point the set number and the end number so like therefore if you do like a TCM example has a 28 and 80 and then you work a b and then like 5 it gives like it gives a number that's directly halfway between 20 and 80 but if it's point 2 it gives number that's 1/5 of the way between 20 and 80 and so on and so forth um and it's like really cool because like also there's a function work color which you can do the same thing but for color so you can have like really really really easy gradients you know I think like what we can do dan is like um just do a click like lip color like on the background to show what it what it's like I hold on I gotta go back to glitch I'm just saying like background and then we're just gonna have in the back here like a start and a stop cool and like um well here's like one of the palettes that I generated I'll put it to you on discord and oh if I could find my discord window yeah I'll thank you and just good real fast that's like the one that I'm gonna be using okay sure cuz like I just got it now my god whose call actually if you just paste that link in a comment in the code that's an easier way for me to grab it oh shoot you're right that's right cuz I forgot okay so I'm just gonna paste it here cool yeah and the URL is basically just like like six hex with five hex codes that would be generated and I'm gonna probably choose like the first one and be like uhoh the probably like the first one I'm like the last one or like the second one well get there when we get there that's okay um and then we can say like background and I think they have to be in strings with a hashtag in front of it if I ever call correctly and we'll grab this one because that one and we gotta do it again alright so we're going to do lip background start and stop so we can say like what um I usually use it do it by lines so like essentially if you can say what lip color should equal lip color and I want to go to the preference real fast again she remembered what exactly the arguments have to be Oh sugar am i muted again no no you're good you're good oh okay I can tell you you you I can't I I think the arguments are the same it's like color one color two and the percentage oh it's the same thing color one color to finish cool alright cool so you can say lip see um we're going to put this in the for loop myself Michael for my eyes equal to min 0 is less than with I need commas and semicolons I I always mix it up like I shouldn't be Ivan Johnson for like so long I applause pool and then we can have that back um you can quickly just do a map let's say like let this bunny lips see so we're gonna take this we're gonna hold live remount instead because that's going to be the third argument so you can say let live from Mount is going to be map and we're going to map from i from 0 to the width sugar and then it's gonna be lips won't learn about speeds between 0 and 1 cool so we're gonna get yeah I'm gonna get a number between 0 and 1 and then we're going to say what color is going to be equal to let color start stop and then lip amount right and then that's what we're going to go ahead and we're going to Remy drawing lines CR okay you stroke it's gonna be equal to the color oh I see what you're doing yeah and then I was wondering why are you using a loop cuz like I thought you're gonna animate the background like like the circle is animating but instead you're gonna you're gonna draw like a gradient pattern across by having by going from one color to another yeah that's super cool yeah yes we're gonna say um line 0 and they're going to be oopsie it's gonna be I to 0 and then I to height yeah and cool and then after that oh it's not showing up where is there should be a it's not like judge live an error somewhere and I I don't know where the console is I don't know it cannot reap repartee map of undefined oh I think it might be having issues with like this out here we're gonna say like angle a and goe this is gonna be angle and then this is gonna be angle and then I assume that's like B over here this would also have to be angle yeah yeah yeah great I don't think that should have like caused an error at least because I using well what what what if we just just a testing for a second what if we just do this okay so that works all right so what it probably is is like oh oh it's probably things it's like how lights up you're like my color thing like sometimes I get some like areas where I really fit where like um I say it's like what something and then it's like oh cuz it's like a peacock oh I see now I see no we have to say at the very beginning start is equal to colored like this oh those aren't colors of course of course of course of course yes this might like be mad yes very very like that yeah yeah yeah yeah and you need to probably change the white strip what happened to the ark Oh higher but like it's like uh so like we can also do this I might be ruining it visually but we all see it yeah looks like you use this color yeah yeah actually I actually really like the white oh I'm gonna put in the white but I think the white looks super cool there um actually yeah I kind of like that I like it a lot I can't hear you then oh sorry I'm not talking oh good my mouth was open cuz I'm like oh it's so pretty okay also somebody in the chat and said like Oh change the gradient colors to variables and animate them and I was thinking oh yeah how would that would be pretty cool okay that's actually not that's like not that bad because what we can do is we can just say you can say let's that color and then let top color right and we're just going to equal to the start color right yeah yeah then stop color is whoa we could lurk the start and the end has to be different colors than the burping in between is the collective I'm gonna Kathy from car objects right now so you won't have to like probably so you won't be able to do that up there because outside ya won't recognize the paper I've got you okay okay then in that case actually and then I kept it define it outside so I'm gonna take away the less right now let's write color salt color right and then we just have to pour I think can do this right yeah this should break and um I don't think we need these now Oh doesn't like it okay I guess you can't use color inside the setup no you can but now now you don't want to say well yeah yeah yeah like that Coco Coco we didn't we did it that's that's a very good idea um so you can like live between like the colors now right um um and we can like do this by like oh oh I'm trying to like think I'm going towards they like a color function in the reference right now because I think you can like add like right what if we kept separate RGB variables or HSB variables instead of instead of just the singular like hex code then those could change based on you know just incrementation or Perlin noise or a sine wave or any of those kind of things but maybe you wanted to focus more on dr no see that's that's the whole plains are shaped like hey we got attention totally fine right you know I like this um but like I thought was like the p5 color um well the color object you're right yeah so I forget because in processing it's actually not a color object the clear function just makes a raw integer that is the you know representation of that 24bits color the eight eight and eight this is a 24 yes yeah it's a color object right now I assume it's gonna like triple triple triple check yeah no no you're absolutely right now in fact I'm just gonna add a little console.log and I'll pull it up you won't so yeah look at it that way so um we can like set the color you can set the red and the green the bloom the Alpha yeah um I don't know we can like it doesn't seem like we can get it you know what I mean like you know I started some getters which honestly is an oversight like oh we should like look like um any other people of color we should be able to get the like colors just get like the RGB a name it's new out it's not really designed to be manipulated by the act decoder which is interesting because of course what you want to do is manipulate color yeah and uh you know the way I've always done this is make my own color object because that's how in processing you kind of had to do it oh it is I can see it's unfortunate that we that are like we had this this idea of the shared code window and glitches brilliant and perfect but unfortunately like we can't exactly see what each other are doing but I I looks like there's like a levels array and then zero is red one is blue so there that the data is kind of there but I think it would be true might be actually better for us to just do like what like if we call it like a cosy color and then okay I mean this might be a terrible idea and then we could make our own color objects and then you would just oh but then you wouldn't have a lower color anymore we can have a to color function especially oh okay we just have them like Regan said you just turn the code like to color would like you know spit out like a p5 color object and it will be able to change the cosy color to p5 color yeah you know and that's how it can like manipulate it so that's great that's great that's great and we would have to make this I said I wasn't gonna type but I can't I I need to like I need like a buzzer like every time I start coding too much I have to play my like buzzer you're doing you're doing you're doing great yes we have that cheek color and then see the whole thing about clubs like Club coding it's just paralyzation right and then watch this watch this we could do this crazy thing if our is is nothing as a string instance of hold on like somebody will know this but test is of instance of strings that false no type of string no somebody will know type of R equals string somebody in the chat bar yeah that make neck wools string then this dot then let C equal color of our and then this dot R equals red of C this G equals green of C this dot I don't know if I'm doing this in the totally craziest way that's the right syntax I like double actually you know that seems like the right syntax yeah and then now oh you did oh you did it here I think you just need the parenthesis hate them too there we go all right hey yeah okay so now you could write whatever functions you want to like change the RGB values oh that's great that's great um cool I'm gonna like take it through the T real fast mhm like just to be sure about this yeah where do you yeah you can you should be able to oh yeah oh oh that's great that's great it's great to know have a we can have a quick function oh I need to like change my position real fast can I keep it in Ritchie I'm gonna move this to another javascript file is that okay the cosy color class yeah yeah go ahead go ahead go ahead that makes sense I I unfortunately like uh like took off like the little side part like the little bar on the sides my like don't know how to bring it back to make a new file there it is class but I will know that it exists how are you fresh the page you'll come back up but either way we're going to say a little huh oh sure sure I like I to let out and like then changed my clipboard we're fine now though ah okay cozy I think cozy color j/s alright we're back and now if we want to add color functionality it's in that other file okay I'm just trying I'm just trying to find out how do I go back to the sidebar thar little control I yeah that's it that's it that's it cool cool cool I just took out the sidebar so I had no idea like were you guys really doing that alright cool so we have that there and then you have like a function gradient color so we can say like uh mind is blanking for a second and so color is out there so we can say um start color that our plus plus this is like pretty simple it's art Culinaire somebody in the chat gave a suggestion to have the to have the the the ark once it finishes to like go back to 0 and I was just adding that really quick idea did you get that yeah so I'm just making an angle target variable okay oh it's gradient Oh whoopsie I need to change up my computer my keyboard unplugs there yeah that's one thing that happens the time not gradient I'm gradient color okay oh oh and then and then I have to get it to go back up yeah yeah yeah again you just set some flags with that so all right I'm gonna have to change this down here and say oh that's like a lot of flags I'll be thinking of by just oh no I was thinking of like how are you doing your bouncing thing yeah you have your friend Nick know you have your boolean stuff like that oh wait oh I want to I don't think it for like all the colors all the colors it'll be like six boolean's at least sounds like I think I only do it for our for rent what's that color ro we're gonna say ro to follow your convincing true yeah cool it's that color circle that R is less than C 55 and start color or grow I think I caught a cold um yeah yes it was less than 255 and it's mostly growing we're gonna say start color dot r + + right and it is elseis ah if that color R is less than 255 oh sorry if it's greater than 255 also going to change the gressman or equal to so we go up less than 255 and start color our grow that's when we want to go ahead and be like oh we got a set this negative now so sorry oh I see what you're doing all right well yeah that can be equal to false so that's what we're doing now another way if it's just like incrementation up and down would be to just have a variable like this sort of color speed so the same way you would do like a bouncing ball and then it just it gets to the edge you would say the like our speed our color speed times equal negative 1 and then it would bounce back and forth so much more sense oh yeah but I did it that crazy way it's not a crazy way but I did it the way that you're doing because that's how I did it here with this like angle thing but that was something beautiful I know right um we're gonna say what is it if start color dot R if it's uh what greater than 255 right and they'll say start color grow I quote speed yeah called speed speed is a wrong word but we're gonna find is x equals negative 1 right and then um yes is it right if why is it invented no I think it bends will be here naturally and I the chat is suggesting a sine function which would also be an idea but let's keep going with this we can always try that after if it's going to be less than zero then that's we're going to say color one so we can just move this Oh perhaps or disappear and we're gonna say or Jerry yeah yeah yeah I'm silly that's okay and then you're gonna do start colors dot R plus equals that color speed right Oh yep it should be that oh there we go there we go there we go I don't change him back yet yes yes oh that's cool and then we can do it for like I'm thinking is like we can do it for like another card color value too so I'm also going to change us to start color like just be able to start color speed are just like specify that this is like the red yeah yeah yeah okay and interestingly like we could I could also imagine later this actually going into the color class like the color class this head like that's like a bounce color function or something exactly um all right I surprisingly really like this like oh we're good I know I'm with this right now um I'm gonna do though like a gradient for like the other color as well yeah yeah so we can say I think that's a soft color Kate remember yes stop color stop color are and really like same thing same difference we're gonna say x equals negative 1 and we also need go ahead and just smoke and so we got initialize it here's the equal 1 all right there we go um well it doesn't like something and we'll get to that later and to say stop hello stop color dot t I think this supposed to be oh yeah and also then plus equals see that probably dot R is what I mean what people stop I'll see you all right there we go so we should have that changing too oh I like that a lot uhoh are they both don't I know they did they're kind of like a little bit in sync like what if you changed stop other to use like the green channel or the blue channel yeah you're right you're right you're right so we're gonna change this to well say well use blue I'm gonna say this is Z and then this is going to be God our looks like B and it is kind of tripping me up just a little bit just capital R it's like capital B and then this here and then this here so like that should be fine oh I kind of like that umm and then like I kind of want to also have too much um I also kind of have like a lot of like these arcs going about so do you want to like throw that in a function too sure okay okay so you can say function late all right oh you mean like duplicate this like growing and shrinking art yeah yeah for me the way that I typically approach this is by making it a class and then making like an array of our like animated art objects yeah fine let's do that are you going to make a class make a file I'll make yeah I can make another file so I'll make a cozy arc file okay so cozy arc Jas and then I'm adding it to index dot HTML cozy arc Jas and then now I'm in cozy art Dutch I asked the file I'm right cool I'm there too so what I think makes sense is if I take your what you wrote to draw it all of this comes into here whoops in show and then now it needs like an x and y and all these need to be like this dot properties mmhmm you need all the so like what I if I'm imagining this yeah so they can be at a certain location and then this could be like a size this could be like this dot angle and this dot angle target yeah okay I don't know if you're doing it I was I sure know what okay all right so do what you want me to go with what I'm thinking for a minute okay okay I'm gonna go with what I'm thinking for a minute so I'm gonna take all I'm gonna take the angle variable which is for the arc or no angle is angle for the arc yes yeah an angle target right and I'm gonna put those into cosy arc okay and then and also let angle okay so these are all going in cozy art but instead it's this dot angle this that angle target and this stuff growing and then I also make a like a variable called like amount which would be like for this so now if I just add this dot everywhere everybody knows that all I ever do is talk about this dot this should this should be in this angle here on 13 yeah and the loop and the angle target did I get everything I think he did yeah and then my idea here would be that if we made all Ray also just want to like we should put in like a dis box size to like what you want to have different sizes that leaves yeah I can go for it awesome so I'm gonna make an array and I'm gonna say X dot push new cosy arc and then for I'll loop through all of the arcs and just say arcs so I don't know if you're getting this era but it seemed like something called this project has received too many requests please try again later oh yeah oh because because we're so popular oh I meaning to buy a pro glitch account I wonder if I just need to do what app like to have I mean I assume that's what it is right everybody everybody turned off the project yeah upgrade my account oh that's fix it Oh local machine and use vs code live share delicious ice a timeout after like four thousand requests says somebody in the chat oh well I didn't know that glitch time that I'd refer to thousand requests see wait I'm a navigator for using like a webbased application yeah me too like warrior you know we are also at 430 so this was the sort of time we said we were gonna switch ok so we could use this as an opportunity to like I could let you sign off I could kind of wrap up things here and point people to go over to twitch to join I could try upgrade like lipstick out to a pro account and then see if we can like you know we'll have a little break and then I fix it should we try that if it's for drilling on the thought so I do want to give like about like like 15 to like 20 minutes to set up yeah yeah yeah it's for thorn exactly like ok so let me let me try to explain to the audience here what's in theory going to happen and you can first of all let me say a huge thank you to Aaron for joining I have you know I've tried a past to have guests on the coding train and I'm hoping to do more of this in the future so this was something of a bit of a test because in sort of figuring out the tech to do this properly and thank you for bearing bearing with me thank you for all the exciting and wonderful work you're doing on Twitch so what the plan here now for everybody watching is we're going to continue project remains to be seen whether I'll be able to successfully call into Aarons but at a minimum Aaron is going to continue this project on her twitch channel so I should put in somebody if somebody could type this in one of the mods could type this into the tap chat it's twitch dot TV actually I have it right here I'll pull it up it's twitch.tv slash cozy coding oops that's the wrong now they're not sorry I have its twitch.tv slash cozy coding it'll probably be first of all it'll probably be like another four hours while I ramble no I'm gonna stop myself from talking but it'll be at least 15 minutes so Aaron is set up there thank you everyone who donated to power plant so Aaron maybe what I should do is I should let you go we're gonna stay query everybody give some rounds of applause and clapping for Aaron in the in the chat and people are posting the link and then I can kind of like vamp here for a little bit to help remind people to head over there and you'll be up and running in about 15 minutes and I'll be there as well all right yes sir I'll leave the discord calls okay yeah all right awesome Thank You Aaron with more of this in the future and everybody should if you like this kind of style of improvisational cosy coding which you should I see no reason not to like it you should subscribe and all that stuff to Aaron's channel cuz she's pretty often yeah yeah almost like I would say like three times a week or so yeah yeah and I'm like once every three weeks so you really just just forget about this coding training and go do some cosy coding okay all right okay Thank You Aaron oh I'll see you in like just a short bit over on your channel yeah okay all right so there goes Aaron I'm gonna I'm gonna press that button I'm gonna mute that just in case it comes back okay so I'm here on my own oh it's just like old times on the coding train this the donation button that you see I thank you anonymous for the donation that you see to the left to the right whatever direction is will stay there I don't know about in perpetuity but even after this stream shuts down but again all you have to do and you can see it's actually even here already is go to twitch.tv slash cozy coding so let me see I'm just gonna go over to my camera so this is just me I'm going to attempt I'm gonna stay here for a little bit just in case people have questions I can answer but I'm gonna attempt to upgrade my twitch account but I prefer to do that without their showing you me entering in my like a credit card and all that nonsense so we're I don't even know where do I do this my account upgrade I'll become a glitch member no rate limits apps that stay awake so I'm definitely doing this and here we go but what's firm oh I have to I have to get my secret code for my credit oh and David is asking what are your plans for continuing the remakes of nature of code let me answer that let me address that question hold on I try to get my code like this is this is riveting livestreaming I'm sure for all of you to watch I have a password manager where I also keep a security codes and things for credit cards I'm sure that's exactly what you're interested in knowing about right now okay that's about to speak it I'm just gonna type it in hit confirm oh whoops hold on hold on hold on hold on I did something wrong I want to do it monthly okay give me a second here confirm okay sure putting in my zip code so about the nature of code so I you know I really have to I don't know if I should be apologizing or what I mean I feel like I want to apologize but I think that I have ambitions of I think being in quarantine and being off for the semester I sort of thought that I'd be able to do more than I actually can and some of that is just my own hangups and some of that is really just the realities of living at home with two small children who do not have school or Kayla and just sort of like the psychology of that and so I really have been different I having a difficult time focusing energy on making video content and streaming I'm also not as used to my technology and like just sort of a routine of it so and I'm totally frozen here it's and I'm not able to purchase this but hopefully that'll come through but I have a couple of thoughts one thing that I think that I could do is throw myself into the writing of nature of code I think this would be in many ways disappointing for some of you who are really interested in following the videos and livestreams but I have actually been considering taking just saying like I'm taking a month off from doing any video stuff and just working on the writing of the book the rewrites of the book and that would be something that I would share is some of you were supporting as members and you know so that's thing that I'm considering doing but I also would like to see if I also could potentially get this set up I do think that soon I'll have access safe access to the recording studio where I was making those video tutorials I can walk there it's about a 45minute or hour walk from here I could also take public transportation if that's a thing that makes sense to do and that building will be open and I can probably so that's something I'm sort of like waiting for that if I have more of a routine where my kids are going back to school even if it's just part like halftime I'm their school is very near where the recording setup that I have for those tutorials so that but anyway I'm off too much talking about that that now so Marcos is asking is there ran saying so much content to catch up on yeah oh the bear oh the I'm sorry I was getting a discord message saying I'm by myself in the call and they're disconnecting me to save bandwidth so a Mason wants to know if I can make more processing tutorials there's so many things for me to do and I'm having a little bit of a difficult time focusing energy and keeping like basically like I'm like answering my email like that's mostly what I'm doing and working on figure out some plants or NYU ordinarily I wouldn't have any sort of like guilt or anxiety over this because I would just say you know what I think I'm gonna take the summer off from video stuff and be back at it in the fall maybe I'll do a couple coding in the Cabana videos which is something that I can do you know at home but I you know this I do have people who sign up to be members and it conceivably there supporting make the making of the content so I might like to shift that towards the writing of the book and maybe I'll discuss that the discord I know whatever I say people are like we support you whatever you want to do it's mine so I really appreciate that and everybody's saying that in the chat as well so I do appreciate that but the things that I would like to do this summer I would like I did those like late night shows I would like to get back and maybe try it another quick round of that cuz it was fun to work on the discord bot the Hugh I I have it working that I could control these hue lights that are behind me from node so I want to keep working on all that stuff the overlay stuff I know that Coby has been helping me with that so we'll see i as of now just in terms of like updates about the coding trans schedule for the summer I definitely plan to be gone for the whole month of August what gone means I don't know yet but I'm kind of using that month as a sort of family vacation it might be a staycation we'll sort of see and possibly the last week of July so right now I'm looking at the month the next couple weeks in June in some weeks in July of working on the book make encoding in the Cabana I've got lots of other things that I'm working on that are you know more for my day job at NYU I do have this project I was working on with Joey Lee actually let me bring that up right now I'll take a break in and and and try to figure out how to subscribe to glitch it just like completely crash my browser and I can't even I don't know why this is not working so I'm just gonna like force quit Chrome for a second Oh Roberto Oh Roberto I think this is the Roberto that I know it's asking the time I'm having trouble with rotating an image about ten degrees counterclockwise oh yes tech explorers so I recently met Roberto let's give a little plug to Roberto oops and I've got the hold on I've got the discord up so let me did not mean to open that up for a second that was a direct message with Jason who was making the cozy coding design so let me let me open this up here first let's let me mention tech explorers Brooklyn which is a local afterschool a center it has a bunch of like camping things there I met Roberto Joseph is in the chat who is the founder director codirector apologies we get Iran of a text Boers broke Brooklyn so let me ask we have a new member hi Kevin see after all that like I'm gonna stop making content somebody joined what are you doing oh look at the planks the new member blinks so I got to get more stuff going with that with the hue lights okay ten degrees counterclockwise when the mouse is pressed and needed to go back to the original position okay so what I would say very briefly I got to get back to somebody keep an eye Ken can somebody in the discord chat violet Kobe Marcos Simon keep track of how Aaron is doing because I want to make sure I shut myself down and send everybody over to Aaron's stream as soon as she is ready but I the reason why I'm continuing to go is I don't want everybody to leave and have nowhere to go I want everybody to go to Aaron's stream so let's look at this little problem for a let's do a little debugging for Roberto so let's say I have an angle and I set it equal to zero and I use translate to get to the center of the window and I draw a rectangle at zero zero that's 100 comma 50 and let's just give it a color of blue and let's say wrecked mode Center and we're gonna say rotate by that angle so it should be that if I change this angle to 45 and say angle mode degrees it should be rotated 45 degrees okay now actually this is perfect we can do exactly what I just did with Aaron with lurk so I could also have a target angle which is zero and I could say on mousepressed if target if angle I'm just gonna say if it's like less than 46 set target angle oh no sorry if it is less than one set target angle equal to 4 let me just start at zero and have the target angle be a zero set it equal to 45 else if angle is greater than like 44 that means it's 45 target angle this there I'm sure there's a more elegant way to do this equals zero so if I run this every time I click the mouse it should be changing target angle let's just see if that's the case console.log target angle right 45 45 mmm why is it not going to zero if it's less than 1 Oh cause it's the angle silly me I'm just changing the target angle there's a much more elegant way of doing this if it equals zero so it's a 45 otherwise set it to zero and still I'm sure this could be improved so let's do this 45 0 45 zero and then i can use lurk so remember lerp if I say angle equals lurk angle to target angle by some amount like 0.5% now when I click the mouse it'll go to 45 back to 0 45 back to zero and if I want it to be like a really fast transition I could make it like 20% they'll give it a nice little like nudge there and of course if I wanted it to be instant Oh Erin is calling so let me answer this call I have to figure okay okay I'm think I'm simultaneously online talking to Erin while I'm still lifes Erin I'm still streaming and when you're ready I'll switch people over okay but I've lost track of what I'm doing because I can't figure out where I am there's so many scribe so many screens and things I can't get on yet but I can hear you as well okay so okay great so you'll let me know I'm just vamping and doing other like a goofy stuff while we're waiting for you to be set up that I'm going to send everybody over to twitch okay so but I've lost the Chad and everything I need another monitor I guess okay all right all right so that was Roberto's question oh now I hear Erin okay I hear you but I can hear you can you hear me sorry I know I'm debugging with Erin YouTube people no they can't nobody on my stream can see or hear you just me oh are you is she streaming Oh everybody Aaron is already streaming so everybody should now head over there so I'm gonna put up a sign I think Aaron is streaming so head to go to twitch.tv can someone confirm that for me oh this is so confusing I have so many things in my ear and so many screens I'm looking at I'm lost the live chat oh okay Aaron I can't confirm Aaron started streaming so you should go there you
