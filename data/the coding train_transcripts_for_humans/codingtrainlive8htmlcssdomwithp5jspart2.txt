01:33 - thing uh but I'm trying to see how far
01:36 - behind um how far behind the stream is

06:21 - little breaks I could just click the
06:23 - play ad button um sorry I'm trying to
06:26 - what I'm trying to do right now is fix
06:29 - an ISS issue I had with the previous
06:30 - videos I was making um I don't know
06:33 - where why I've Got Sublime Text open I
06:36 - need to go and
06:37 - get the newest p5js and I actually just
06:42 - want this single
06:44 - file and I want to close the editor and
06:49 - I want to find the example I'm making
06:52 - which was under Dom under
06:56 - slider other events and I want want this
06:59 - p5js file in there and I want this one
07:02 - to go away and then I want to launch the
07:07 - editor again I don't know uh quick
07:10 - Chrome close all these
07:12 - things
07:15 - and uh launch the editor
07:19 - again and there we go I have a feeling
07:22 - this is going to work
07:24 - now no
07:27 - error oh what did I do oh
07:30 - oh editor crash editor
07:35 - crash
07:37 - technology okay
07:42 - um
07:44 - uh I thought Lauren McCarthy are you
07:49 - there maybe she's in the
07:53 - hallway oh no she's teaching in class so
07:56 - there's a there's a trying to make a
07:58 - certain Feature work in p5js that was
08:00 - recently added but there was also a bug
08:01 - in a recent version of p5js which caused
08:04 - the editor to break I don't even know if
08:06 - I have the most recent version of the
08:08 - editor this is great to do this Live
08:11 - Well I could definitely use another
08:12 - editor I'm just uh trying to use
08:18 - um uh let me
08:21 - uh let me see here if I have the most
08:24 - recent version of the
08:26 - editor oh you know what I know what it
08:28 - is that I can fix
08:29 - manually aha so editor crashing with
08:33 - this
08:33 - version uh the line of code where it's
08:39 - crashing was comment this line
08:42 - out uh this doevents device motion
08:46 - equals
08:47 - null
08:48 - so um let me get the editor again
08:55 - open uh and let me go into here
09:00 - [Music]
09:05 - find let's just comment that out oops no
09:08 - no no no no I need to open the
09:11 - actual thing that I want to open other
09:14 - events and go to libraries p5js and I
09:19 - move this over here if anyone wants to
09:21 - watch what I'm doing def find this there
09:22 - we
09:25 - go and that should do the trick
09:31 - doesn't crash and this was it there we
09:37 - go success nobody has any nobody cares
09:40 - but I I I recorded a video earlier today
09:43 - which was like 20 minutes long 10
09:45 - minutes of it was trying to debug this
09:48 - problem uh and oh three people somebody
09:50 - else joined I can see exactly the number
09:53 - I love this new YouTube live streaming
09:54 - thing who are you third person who's not
09:57 - Sharon Dela Cruz or Jay David I ber oh
10:00 - you left cuz there's only two people
10:01 - watching or one of you left when when
10:03 - you have such a small audience like me I
10:05 - can pinpoint exactly who's there and
10:06 - who's not there um all right it is 2:30
10:10 - p.m. I am going to see I'm going to see
10:13 - if I can make uh another
10:16 - video
10:18 - um and uh hide
10:21 - sidebar uh actually show sidebar I'm
10:24 - going to close the browser here uh so
10:27 - this is where I am these are this is my
10:28 - list videos I'm going to see if I can do
10:31 - a CSS video so this video number six
10:35 - here is the one that was a total sort of
10:37 - failure and I I should go back and
10:38 - re-record it or do it in a different way
10:40 - or leave it as it is and record an extra
10:43 - little section that fixes it um but in
10:47 - the
10:48 - uh uh but in the
10:52 - um uh in the brief amount of time that I
10:55 - have I think I'm going to do the uh uh
10:57 - CSS and style
11:00 - uh video so couple things I need to do
11:02 - one is I just need to test that my
11:03 - recording system is actually working so
11:06 - I'm going to do that for a second and
11:07 - I'm going to hit
11:08 - record and then I'm going to dance
11:11 - around and
11:13 - sing
11:15 - um what's the song that I've uh there's
11:19 - usually a song that I sing I don't know
11:21 - what it is never mind no singing no
11:23 - singing aloud I'm going to go over here
11:26 - fraka F I'm not over here there we go uh
11:31 - you can see that the camera is in
11:32 - slightly the wrong position there we go
11:35 - that maybe helps uh to focus okay can
11:37 - you read this uh I'm going to come back
11:39 - over here and test this and I'm going to
11:42 - hit stop recording and then I should see
11:45 - on the
11:46 - desktop a file that I just recently
11:51 - recorded
11:53 - uh and it says today 2:34 p.m. ICM _ 0
11:59 - 41 megabytes I'm going to open up this
12:02 - video file and play
12:05 - it I turn the volume on to see if
12:07 - there's
12:12 - sound I'm
12:15 - check uh I want to check
12:21 - um my God I'm losing my
12:25 - mind I shouldn't live stream when I'm
12:27 - just like doing testing
12:29 - but I have to test that this new way
12:31 - works show movie
12:33 - inspector uh 30 frames per second 1280
12:36 - by
12:37 - 720 data size data rate all right I'm
12:41 - happy with this close
12:44 - this turn the volume back
12:47 - off close close so who would like who is
12:53 - there interested in the topic of more
12:56 - comments below only one everybody left
13:00 - one person who are you one person who
13:02 - Happ to left their left their browser
13:04 - open by accident
13:06 - um uh okay um let's see
13:11 - here
13:15 - uh uh okay
13:20 - um let's see maybe I should work on the
13:24 - green screening you guys want to this is
13:26 - going to I wonder if I can do this live
13:28 - while while I'm streaming so if I hit
13:31 - edit
13:32 - shot and I go to the green
13:35 - screen and I go to the chroma key and I
13:38 - check you can see are you seeing I
13:41 - should uh go back to the live dashboard
13:44 - you should see me right now in front of
13:46 - a green wall oh you can see the like
13:48 - Shadow here which is really
13:51 - because of the lighting let's see if I
13:53 - can fix that a little
13:57 - bit better worse oh you know what it is
14:01 - it's this table here I don't really care
14:04 - so much but I really should probably
14:06 - make that
14:07 - better
14:11 - um uh I have a
14:14 - light that I think just needs to point
14:16 - up more so if I put something under it
14:20 - like a
14:22 - book I I'll do anything to not have to
14:25 - record a video about CSS
14:27 - apparently this is an empty
14:32 - box let's do
14:35 - that o that created a strange new
14:40 - Shadow probably just need to put it over
14:43 - here and now I'm going to trip on
14:47 - myself I also oh look at this like weird
14:49 - extra Shadows I I'll work on this
14:52 - later good enough for
14:55 - now that's a little bit little bit
14:58 - better a little bit better little bit
15:01 - worse who
15:03 - knows
15:05 - um let's uh go back to use chroma key
15:10 - and
15:12 - uh I see and now I I do this okay
15:17 - no
15:18 - defaults uh pick color key with the
15:27 - mouse
15:32 - uh oh well I think that'll just be good
15:41 - enough
15:44 - uh yeah seeing in front of the text not
15:47 - pure
15:54 - green uh okay let's see do I have time
16:01 - 239 um I have 20
16:06 - minutes shall I make this
16:10 - happen yeah okay I'm going to do
16:13 - something about
16:15 - CSS CSS style so I'm I just want to make
16:20 - an example a little bit from
16:23 - scratch I'll leave the
16:26 - button get rid of the slider and the
16:28 - input field I'll leave the background
16:30 - color variable I will get rid of this
16:33 - canvas event
16:35 - stuff
16:41 - um
16:44 - and oh I definitely need a create P I
16:48 - need
16:55 - a and I'm going to get rid of all these
16:58 - these
16:59 - events
17:01 - and
17:09 - uh
17:10 - [Music]
17:11 - and let me make
17:19 - this like
17:22 - this and
17:25 - uh oh yes it doesn't look so great the
17:27 - green screen
17:29 - okay
17:34 - um
17:36 - and uh let me run this and
17:39 - see change color is not
17:42 - defined a
17:47 - problem see kind far can I get away with
17:49 - this okay change color is not to
17:53 - find that's all right I don't need an
17:55 - event right
17:57 - now
18:03 - all right
18:09 - uh and there we go okay uh I have this
18:13 - web page I have the
18:17 - editor

18:46 - and okay now getting ready here to make
18:52 - this
18:53 - video ah the green screen got a little
18:56 - better I think it has to do with um

24:56 - time I have uh office hours appointments
24:58 - at 3M so I meant to do this from 2: to 3
25:02 - but I I set up an entirely new streaming
25:05 - system I'm very small here um uh um and
25:10 - it took me 45 minutes to do that so I
25:12 - sort of lost all my time but I'm going
25:13 - to try to at least get one more video
25:15 - out I did a whole bunch this morning um
25:18 - and uh Mark Abby is in the chat Mark
25:20 - Abby is in the chat uh he has done a ton
25:23 - of work on the uh Dom Library over the
25:26 - summer and and uh as part of Google sum
25:30 - of code a lot of the new features are
25:31 - thanks to him and uh if you have actual
25:34 - questions about how it works or what it
25:35 - does you can ask in the chat he knows
25:37 - more about it than I do and I am I
25:39 - shrinking I feel so tiny uh okay I'm
25:42 - just gonna leave it um okay
25:46 - um here we go oh look at this I swear
25:50 - every time I look over I'm getting
25:52 - smaller I'm going to just set check
25:55 - these settings One Time One More Time
25:57 - time on this
25:59 - shot um there we
26:07 - go ah I see I have to click in and out
26:09 - okay I should be I got a lot of Shadow
26:11 - and a lot of issues going on but it's
26:14 - such as life I need to the lighting
26:17 - somehow in here just totally changed but
26:19 - um here we go I only have 10 minutes now
26:21 - if I keep talking I'm going to lose all
26:23 - my
26:25 - time uh
26:34 - all right so this video is about a giant
26:36 - topic one again that I know very little
26:39 - about uh and that topic is CSS and so uh
26:42 - you know there's been a bunch of videos
26:43 - here that I've made about the Dom the
26:45 - document object model web pages HTML
26:49 - Pages JavaScript how they control HTML
26:51 - Pages let's just take a step back for a
26:53 - moment and and and look at the pieces we
26:55 - know about and what's this third piece
26:57 - that I'm adding so this web page this
27:00 - thing that you're seeing in the browser
27:02 - or in the sort of browser window of the
27:04 - p5js editor where I'm writing all the
27:06 - code there the the thing that this page
27:09 - loads is a file called
27:12 - index.html okay so and this is not a
27:15 - good pen I'm switching pens in this file
27:18 - there is some content written into that
27:20 - file for example uh there is a header
27:24 - that's at the top of the page there's a
27:25 - paragraph this file is also referring to
27:29 - some JavaScript code uh it's referring
27:32 - to a bunch of different things like the
27:34 - p5js library file uh our own code which
27:38 - is in a file called sketch. and in those
27:40 - files we're doing some JavaScript stuff
27:43 - like making a canvas drawing a circle to
27:46 - that canvas and perhaps even as we've
27:48 - seen in previous videos making other Dom
27:51 - elements like more paragraphs and
27:54 - affecting those and changing those
27:57 - elements so you can think of uh these
28:00 - pieces as
28:01 - HTML this is really the
28:04 - structure and you could also say like
28:07 - initial content in a way like what's on
28:09 - the page when it first loads of that web
28:12 - page JavaScript is logic code things
28:16 - that can handle events store information
28:19 - make all sorts of magic happen this is
28:21 - what you can think of as the behavior of
28:23 - the page so this is where you and I and
28:27 - every body else who's doing this stuff
28:29 - is writing code to control what's
28:31 - happening on that page over time based
28:33 - on us your interaction based on some
28:35 - mathematical algorithm based on whatever
28:37 - you might fancy you like to draw
28:39 - rainbows in a canvas unicorns do that
28:42 - with JavaScript I'm adding unicorns to
28:45 - my repertoire here only was at rainbrow
28:47 - okay so um then the last piece here that
28:50 - I want to talk about is this idea of CSS
28:53 - and CSS stands for cascading style
28:56 - sheets I don't know why they're
28:58 - cascading probably has to do with some
29:00 - sort of like nesting and whatever and
29:02 - somebody on the internet who really
29:03 - knows this stuff will hopefully write in
29:05 - the comments why it's cascading but the
29:08 - keyword there is
29:10 - style so if you want to affect various
29:13 - aspects of the layout of this page you
29:16 - want the canvas to actually float on the
29:18 - right side of the page rather than the
29:19 - left side of the page you want to change
29:21 - the font that's in the paragraphs you
29:22 - want to change the background color of a
29:25 - paragraph you want to any just about
29:27 - anything that you can imagine that has
29:29 - to do with the visual look and feel of
29:31 - that page can be controlled with this
29:34 - idea of
29:35 - CSS now once again we're in the same
29:38 - place as we were with
29:40 - HTML you could write HTML into that
29:44 - index.html file or you could dynamically
29:48 - sort of insert HTML elements into the
29:51 - page using JavaScript you can write you
29:54 - can sort of in give some initial content
29:56 - you can also control those elements
29:58 - using JavaScript the same thing is true
30:00 - with CSS there is a kind of file camera
30:04 - went off there is a kind another kind of
30:06 - file you could write uh I've disappeared
30:09 - from the world but I am still here you
30:12 - cannot see me but I am still here I will
30:15 - never leave until every one last person
30:17 - on Earth actually most people on Earth
30:20 - don't really need to know about CSS or
30:21 - maybe they should I don't really know I
30:23 - I that was a terrible idea but you're
30:27 - here watching this video maybe CSS is
30:29 - useful to you I'm gonna keep going
30:32 - um the HTML file the Javascript file now
30:37 - you can also add information about
30:40 - styles to another kind of file named
30:42 - maybe style named whatever you want css.
30:45 - JS for javascript. HTML for html.
30:49 - CSS now we're in what I meant by saying
30:53 - we're in the same situation is I want to
30:54 - talk about how do you add that style
30:56 - stuff to
30:58 - style.css and then or and or how much
31:00 - you add style dynamically on the Fly
31:03 - based on user interaction based on some
31:05 - set of behaviors in JavaScript this is
31:07 - the bigger picture here and then there's
31:09 - lots of details to fill in boy am I
31:11 - rambling about this but hopefully it's
31:12 - making some sense okay so how does CSS
31:15 - work CSS works on a sing a couple
31:18 - different principles one is this idea of
31:20 - a selector so you need to have a
31:24 - selector meaning what are are the things
31:27 - that you want to select to style do you
31:30 - want to select all the paragraphs on the
31:31 - page do you want to select just this one
31:33 - particular paragraph do you want to
31:35 - select the canvas do what what Dom
31:38 - elements do you want to select in order
31:40 - to style after you say after you specify
31:43 - that selector so for example let's say
31:45 - you want to style all the paragraph
31:47 - elements on the page your selector would
31:49 - be P then you need some open and close
31:52 - curly brackets much like you always do
31:55 - when you're doing these kinds of things
31:56 - to to denote the beginning and end of
31:59 - the stuff that will the style
32:00 - information that will be applied to that
32:02 - paragraph once you have that all you
32:05 - need are a series of name value pairs
32:10 - this looks kind of like a JavaScript
32:12 - object but the syntax is a little bit
32:14 - different these name value pairs are
32:16 - like what's the property you want to
32:18 - style and what's the value for that
32:21 - style for example I want to style the
32:24 - background color and I want the
32:27 - background color to be black or white
32:31 - that's white oh I want it to be like
32:34 - pinkish F ZF so you can be asking your
32:37 - question like oh my God
32:39 - what what is that that looks terrifying
32:41 - to me there's like a pound symol and
32:43 - then a letter and then a number so
32:45 - there's a lot of things to learn this is
32:47 - a certain kind of special way of writing
32:49 - a color information you know I think
32:51 - maybe this would have been a little bit
32:53 - simpler if I just wrote the word pink
32:55 - here or purple here that would also work
32:58 - there are a variety of different ways so
33:00 - now the question is what are the kinds
33:01 - of things that can go here you know font
33:03 - size is one of them I think so if I want
33:05 - to like change the font size there's so
33:07 - much that could go here how do you know
33:09 - what the possibilities are how do you
33:11 - add that to your CSS and then how do you
33:14 - do that with JavaScript how much time do
33:17 - we have uh I'm gonna I'm gonna let's go
33:20 - to the code and look at how that some of
33:21 - this works okay I I've disappeared but
33:24 - I'm going to come back to life Sun shine
33:27 - rain down upon me and give me some light
33:29 - and have I shall appear now in front of
33:31 - the camera okay I have to turn this down
33:34 - uh okay so here I am with a p5js project
33:38 - in the p5js editor I'm going to run this
33:41 - and you can see there again we're back
33:44 - here I have this H1 element this
33:47 - paragraph element this canvas another
33:49 - paragraph element a button some of these
33:53 - elements are written here into the HTML
33:56 - body
33:57 - right in advance these are HTML elements
33:59 - that appear on the page as soon as it
34:01 - loads some of these elements are created
34:05 - with JavaScript made dynamically when
34:07 - the program runs create a paragraph
34:09 - create a button okay this is where we
34:11 - are how do I start to style let's style
34:13 - that
34:15 - paragraph Okay so actually um what I'm
34:18 - going to do even though I said over
34:21 - here uh come back even though I said
34:23 - over here you can create I'm was going
34:24 - to create a separate CSS file I'll do
34:27 - that in a later video what actually this
34:30 - buttons a little hyperactive what
34:32 - actually I think I would like to do is
34:33 - show you how you can actually add CSS
34:36 - style information directly into the HTML
34:39 - page so inside of this head tag where
34:43 - I'm referring to JavaScript files I
34:46 - could also potentially refer
34:49 - to some style information so what's that
34:53 - syntax paragraph I want to select all of
34:57 - the paragraphs on the page and assign
34:59 - them a background color which is uh
35:02 - purple I wish I could type rainbow there
35:04 - do you think it works if I type rainbow
35:06 - there I doubt it okay so now if I save
35:10 - and I run this again we can see look
35:12 - this paragraph element has a purple
35:14 - background this paragraph element has a
35:17 - purple background you know what it's
35:18 - very hard for me to see the text so I
35:20 - think if I say this color it refers to
35:24 - the color of the text inside the
35:25 - paragraph I think
35:28 - and now you can see I have white text
35:31 - with a purple background it looks a
35:33 - little crowded in there so something
35:35 - that I might add to this is some padding
35:37 - and how much padding how about eight
35:39 - pixels PX for
35:42 - Pixel so I'm going to do this and look
35:44 - ah look at this I've got some nice
35:46 - padding now so this is the basic idea of
35:49 - CSS I need to select something on the
35:52 - page and then give it some properties
35:55 - what's the property what's the value
35:56 - what's the the property what's the value
35:58 - how do you know what all these possible
35:59 - properties are well you need to look
36:01 - this stuff up you could get books you
36:03 - watch other videos that where someone
36:04 - really knows about CSS is talking about
36:06 - this but um but uh and this is where so
36:09 - so let's look for this briefly in a
36:11 - moment and I have a couple more minutes
36:14 - left uh I am going to
36:17 - um uh ah so I am on here developer.
36:22 - Mozilla um so this is one place I'll put
36:24 - some links in the description for this
36:26 - video but here is a URL of where I could
36:28 - find some information about CSS I'm
36:31 - going to remove this part
36:33 - here this is a CSS reference there's a
36:36 - tutorial there's demos uh I want to look
36:39 - at the ref an exhaustive I'm exhausted
36:42 - already an exhaustive reference I'm
36:44 - going to look at the exhaustive
36:45 - reference and I'm going to see like look
36:47 - these are all of the possible things I
36:49 - could add there's so much I just keep
36:51 - scrolling and scrolling and scrolling
36:53 - and scrolling but we can look under I
36:55 - can look for like background color and
36:57 - you can see background color is right
37:00 - over here I can click on it and what do
37:02 - I see now I see here are some examples
37:06 - of of different ways that I can call
37:08 - background color I could say red I could
37:10 - say RGB I could say current all sorts of
37:12 - ways so this is a topic for another time
37:15 - another video for you to look on your
37:17 - own there's another CSS reference that I
37:20 - like to use if I could find it in my
37:22 - history here um I think it's this one
37:25 - right so I'll include a link to this
37:27 - this is a nice reference of all sorts of
37:29 - possible uh parameters in CSS the things
37:33 - that I want to focus on in in my videos
37:36 - is less about the full encompassing of
37:39 - all of the CSS reference and more about
37:41 - two things one
37:44 - is this how how do these selectors work
37:47 - what are other ways that I could
37:48 - specifically address a single paragraph
37:50 - or only some paragraph there's a lot of
37:52 - ways you can use these selectors so I
37:53 - want to get to that and the other thing
37:55 - I want to get to is how do you do style
37:58 - dynamically in
38:00 - JavaScript so um with p5js specifically
38:04 - so let's take at least another video um
38:06 - um I'm one of my future videos I'm going
38:08 - to talk more about selectors but in this
38:10 - particular video I want to look at the
38:12 - style
38:13 - function so here if I come back if I
38:17 - quit Chrome for a second and I come back
38:18 - to this we can see that these particular
38:23 - elements now these paragraph elements
38:25 - are all styled
38:27 - based on the hardcoded style information
38:29 - that's in the HTML file inside of the
38:31 - style tags but another thing I can do is
38:36 - right over here I can for any HTM any
38:40 - element that I create with P5 and later
38:43 - I'm going to show you any element that I
38:44 - access in P5 whether it was created or
38:46 - not I can call a function called
38:50 - style which then requires just two
38:55 - arguments what are those arguments the
38:58 - name of the style property the value of
39:00 - the style property so if I were to put
39:02 - right here in quotes background- color
39:07 - and then I were to say in here in quotes
39:12 - pink you can see look at this this
39:15 - particular element is still getting the
39:17 - style from the HTML page this particular
39:20 - element whop I'm not
39:23 - there uh this particular element that
39:26 - down here is getting the style from my
39:28 - code so the when I apply a piece of
39:31 - styling dynamically in code uh it's
39:34 - going to overwrite the style that was
39:36 - originally set up in the HTML page so
39:38 - there's a lot of pieces here and for you
39:40 - essentially if you're following these
39:42 - videos along what I would suggest you do
39:44 - is try adding some style to the HTML
39:46 - file in the same
39:49 - way that I did here try adding some
39:52 - Styles this way what other tags might
39:55 - you reference try adding some Styles
39:58 - this way what happens if you add styles
40:00 - to other kinds of elements that aren't
40:02 - just paragraph elements and lastly and
40:04 - I'll do this for you really quickly set
40:07 - something style with an event okay let's
40:10 - think about this for example what if I
40:12 - say uh what if I were to say button.
40:16 - mous
40:18 - pressed change style right so now I am
40:24 - attaching the change style event to the
40:27 - Press of this button and what is that
40:29 - change style event it's a function that
40:32 - I need to write right the code inside
40:35 - this function right here will execute
40:37 - when I click the mouse on that button
40:39 - and maybe I'll change the text style to
40:43 - Pink and maybe I'll give it a lot more
40:47 - padding because who doesn't love padding
40:51 - jazz hands I don't know feel like that's
40:53 - going to be that's JavaScript the
40:55 - musical that's my first song who doesn't
40:56 - love
40:59 - padding you with me on that okay uh so
41:02 - now if we look at this everything's got
41:04 - its default style I'm going to trigger
41:06 - that event I got some more padding and
41:09 - uh a pink background so and you know
41:11 - maybe what I want to do I just I got to
41:13 - do a little bit more say text Mouse over
41:16 - change style oops and then uh I'll say
41:22 - button I'll say text Mouse out revert
41:28 - Style and what I can do here and I'm
41:31 - going to I'm just showing you some other
41:33 - things
41:34 - uh revert
41:37 - style and background purple
41:41 - padding eight pixels so let's take out
41:44 - the button event for a second I'm using
41:45 - Mouse out and mouse over I Mouse over I
41:48 - Mouse out I Mouse over I Mouse out I
41:50 - Mouse over that's a very rhythmic um so
41:53 - you can see here that you can start to
41:55 - highlight things make things happen
41:57 - based on button presses based on Mouse
41:59 - over bouse out based on the movement of
42:00 - a slider as we saw in the previous video
42:03 - so many possibilities so now you have
42:05 - something to work with try adding some
42:07 - style to the HTML page try adding some
42:10 - style using the style function see what
42:13 - types of elements what types of designs
42:14 - you can make and I'm going to come back
42:16 - and look at this again and again and
42:17 - again in several videos looking at other
42:19 - different types of scenarios with more
42:21 - events and more ways of selecting
42:23 - Elements which uh classes and IDs is the
42:26 - topic for that and just as a reminder uh
42:29 - go and look in those references that'll
42:30 - be linked below as to where you can find
42:32 - all this stuff so I'm 5 minutes over
42:34 - time not that that is relevant to you
42:35 - especially if you're watching this
42:37 - sometime in the future like in the year
42:39 - 2000 that was a while ago I guess but in
42:42 - my my childhood the year 2000 seemed
42:44 - like very far away uh the year 3000 is
42:47 - anybody watching this if you're watching
42:48 - this the year 3000 please go and get my
42:50 - brain out of that cryogenic thing that
42:52 - it's
42:53 - in and I don't know yeah
42:57 - do something with it talk to me about
42:59 - rainbows okay goodbye and I'll see you
43:01 - in a future
43:03 - video I have toit stop now okay live
43:06 - stream I don't know if that came across
43:07 - and worked uh anybody there's some
43:11 - discussion here uh so thanks for I I've
43:14 - got to go unfortunately I'm going to try
43:16 - to do some more live streams as soon as
43:17 - I have some more time I've got a whole
43:19 - long list of Dom manipulation videos to
43:22 - make and also I um
43:27 - I have a whole bunch from this morning
43:28 - that I need to upload and correct
43:30 - because there were some problems in them
43:31 - so goodbye for now please be in touch
43:34 - and uh I hope to see you all again in
43:37 - this weird strange context that is this
43:39 - live streaming
43:41 - thing uh okay how do I stop
43:44 - this
43:46 - um I wonder if I just hit settings here
43:51 - no oh wait look I'll play an ad who
43:53 - wants to watch an ad while I wait to
43:55 - figure out how to stop
43:56 - I won't do the ad right now the stream
43:58 - is public advanced settings maybe I'm
44:01 - just supposed to stop it from clicking a
44:03 - button in wirecast so I'm going to do
44:05 - that okay I'm going to click this button
44:06 - it's definitely going to shut off
44:07 - goodbye

Cleaned transcript:

here test test test I'm trying a new wave of streaming I don't even have the mic in or anything it says the stream is offline uh let's see here live dashboard is anyone watching this zero people come on somebody tell me if this is working okay test test ah there's a slam on the door sorry that was very loud I'm testing a new streaming way of streaming uh oh I'm hearing myself somewhere anywhere no maybe I'm just echoing to myself hello hello hello hello echo echo okay uh great I see great thank you all right so you hear me look so actually I'm using a new version of wirecast which I have here and that's why I have this like infinite Zoom thing uh but I'm trying to see how far behind um how far behind the stream is so I'm going to make a funny expression in face and then count and see how long till I see it in the actual uh see all in the delay so here we go 1 1,00 2 1000 3 1,000 4 1,000 5 1,000 6 1,000 7 1,000 8 1,000 9 1,000 10 1,00 11 1,00 12 1,00 30 1,00 401 so about 14 or 15 seconds is the lag between when I do something and you see it uh okay um I have only 35 minutes um I swear I'm hearing myself back audio somewhere hello but I don't know where that's coming from I got like three different machines in here all doing different things uh so one of the things I need to do here is I need to actually also set up my recording output out okay that's fine this the quality may be affected for a second uh record to dis uh okay and then no no no no no no uh Pro res 720 16 by9 I don't know let's just see what that does uh more options no uh sorry I'm like live configuring my my wirecast here so apologies for that uh I should have done this in advance ah shoot cord to dis more um let me try add cord to disk MP4 let's try that uh okay HD yeah this is what I want perfect I I want to compress it uh uh here we go so I don't want this one I want this one I wanted to go to the desktop and I want it to be called ICM 2015 uh save and okay so oops no no no don't close this close this okay hi everybody Google uh I could I'm smaller than I Ed usually am I made myself a little smaller and the green screening isn't perfect I should fix that and I swear I'm hearing myself Fe feedback coming out of somewhere which computer is that maybe it's this one hold on I think I know which one it is uh it's the it's the wirecast it's it's the uh okay I need to log back into wirecast and I need to go to this computer and turn volume off and that should do the trick I no longer hear myself echoing excellent um there are two people watching which is good because I'm not doing anything um and uh I've got all sorts of analytics I've got a permanent URL stream options I could play an ad let's see what happens if I play an ad you guys tolerate this for a second all two of you are watching the based on some complex criteria some of your viewers will see an ad keep streaming anybody seeing an ad uh is the volume okay um all right um okay I so actually I'm gonna come back to what I was doing so I was making some videos before and I was trying to get something to work ah and my problem is I didn't update p5js I thought I did but I didn't okay hold on I'm fixing something uh today copy it over here uh uh no that's the wrong one hold on everybody and the volume is cool Valene well thank you for watching the Valene ad I maybe I made about quarter of a cent or something uh okay it's what's what's good about this though is I know not very many people are going to tune into this but I often take these like short little breaks I could just click the play ad button um sorry I'm trying to what I'm trying to do right now is fix an ISS issue I had with the previous videos I was making um I don't know where why I've Got Sublime Text open I need to go and get the newest p5js and I actually just want this single file and I want to close the editor and I want to find the example I'm making which was under Dom under slider other events and I want want this p5js file in there and I want this one to go away and then I want to launch the editor again I don't know uh quick Chrome close all these things and uh launch the editor again and there we go I have a feeling this is going to work now no error oh what did I do oh oh editor crash editor crash technology okay um uh I thought Lauren McCarthy are you there maybe she's in the hallway oh no she's teaching in class so there's a there's a trying to make a certain Feature work in p5js that was recently added but there was also a bug in a recent version of p5js which caused the editor to break I don't even know if I have the most recent version of the editor this is great to do this Live Well I could definitely use another editor I'm just uh trying to use um uh let me uh let me see here if I have the most recent version of the editor oh you know what I know what it is that I can fix manually aha so editor crashing with this version uh the line of code where it's crashing was comment this line out uh this doevents device motion equals null so um let me get the editor again open uh and let me go into here find let's just comment that out oops no no no no no I need to open the actual thing that I want to open other events and go to libraries p5js and I move this over here if anyone wants to watch what I'm doing def find this there we go and that should do the trick doesn't crash and this was it there we go success nobody has any nobody cares but I I I recorded a video earlier today which was like 20 minutes long 10 minutes of it was trying to debug this problem uh and oh three people somebody else joined I can see exactly the number I love this new YouTube live streaming thing who are you third person who's not Sharon Dela Cruz or Jay David I ber oh you left cuz there's only two people watching or one of you left when when you have such a small audience like me I can pinpoint exactly who's there and who's not there um all right it is 230 p.m. I am going to see I'm going to see if I can make uh another video um and uh hide sidebar uh actually show sidebar I'm going to close the browser here uh so this is where I am these are this is my list videos I'm going to see if I can do a CSS video so this video number six here is the one that was a total sort of failure and I I should go back and rerecord it or do it in a different way or leave it as it is and record an extra little section that fixes it um but in the uh uh but in the um uh in the brief amount of time that I have I think I'm going to do the uh uh CSS and style uh video so couple things I need to do one is I just need to test that my recording system is actually working so I'm going to do that for a second and I'm going to hit record and then I'm going to dance around and sing um what's the song that I've uh there's usually a song that I sing I don't know what it is never mind no singing no singing aloud I'm going to go over here fraka F I'm not over here there we go uh you can see that the camera is in slightly the wrong position there we go that maybe helps uh to focus okay can you read this uh I'm going to come back over here and test this and I'm going to hit stop recording and then I should see on the desktop a file that I just recently recorded uh and it says today 234 p.m. ICM _ 0 41 megabytes I'm going to open up this video file and play it I turn the volume on to see if there's sound I'm check uh I want to check um my God I'm losing my mind I shouldn't live stream when I'm just like doing testing but I have to test that this new way works show movie inspector uh 30 frames per second 1280 by 720 data size data rate all right I'm happy with this close this turn the volume back off close close so who would like who is there interested in the topic of more comments below only one everybody left one person who are you one person who Happ to left their left their browser open by accident um uh okay um let's see here uh uh okay um let's see maybe I should work on the green screening you guys want to this is going to I wonder if I can do this live while while I'm streaming so if I hit edit shot and I go to the green screen and I go to the chroma key and I check you can see are you seeing I should uh go back to the live dashboard you should see me right now in front of a green wall oh you can see the like Shadow here which is really because of the lighting let's see if I can fix that a little bit better worse oh you know what it is it's this table here I don't really care so much but I really should probably make that better um uh I have a light that I think just needs to point up more so if I put something under it like a book I I'll do anything to not have to record a video about CSS apparently this is an empty box let's do that o that created a strange new Shadow probably just need to put it over here and now I'm going to trip on myself I also oh look at this like weird extra Shadows I I'll work on this later good enough for now that's a little bit little bit better a little bit better little bit worse who knows um let's uh go back to use chroma key and uh I see and now I I do this okay no defaults uh pick color key with the mouse uh oh well I think that'll just be good enough uh yeah seeing in front of the text not pure green uh okay let's see do I have time 239 um I have 20 minutes shall I make this happen yeah okay I'm going to do something about CSS CSS style so I'm I just want to make an example a little bit from scratch I'll leave the button get rid of the slider and the input field I'll leave the background color variable I will get rid of this canvas event stuff um and oh I definitely need a create P I need a and I'm going to get rid of all these these events and uh and let me make this like this and uh oh yes it doesn't look so great the green screen okay um and uh let me run this and see change color is not defined a problem see kind far can I get away with this okay change color is not to find that's all right I don't need an event right now all right uh and there we go okay uh I have this web page I have the editor uh I have the HTML file only thing I want to do here is this indent it correctly and okay now getting ready here to make this video ah the green screen got a little better I think it has to do with um how much sunlight is coming in here I it was working so much better this morning because I had the Sun and uh this Shadow here which is really where is the shadow it's over here but this is a this is a table oh you know what I can do is I can just make myself I know what to do uh you don't need to see so much of me move myself down a little bit there you go over it this way myself down uh and that's going to help did that not change anything uh riveting I'm sure you guys are just can't stop watching this right if I do that how come it's not updating uh maybe it can't update live and oh it is working it's like behind oh it stops me uh create button is something built into p5js I'm a tiny person I shouldn't be I I hope I can delete this I'm going to probably have to delete this one uh let me just get it exactly where I want it and just hope it works raise my hands up to there over there okay this will just have to do um yeah the shadow keeps coming and going it's getting better and worse depending on the light that's coming in from outside uh 243 okay I I'm going to try to make something happen um let me look at my list um and okay wait wait I I need this CSS reference page open um if I go to like background color uh I don't know that I love this background color blue color color units I'm like this is not my okay hold on Mozilla CSS reference let's try this this is good background color if I click here yeah there we go this is better okay great I'm going to use this particular reference um okay so I have 15 minutes um I'm going to mute myself I'm going to I'm going to record a video in two minutes I'm going to mute myself and be right okay I'm back I don't know if anyone's still there uh for people are there perhaps if you're there say something say hello uh and tell me if the audio and the picture is fine can you see this I'm going to erase all this um and and I'm about to take 10 minutes to make a short video Lesson about uh CSS and the style function in p5js okay and it is 247 p.m. oops it's 247 p.m. eastern time I have uh office hours appointments at 3M so I meant to do this from 2 to 3 but I I set up an entirely new streaming system I'm very small here um uh um and it took me 45 minutes to do that so I sort of lost all my time but I'm going to try to at least get one more video out I did a whole bunch this morning um and uh Mark Abby is in the chat Mark Abby is in the chat uh he has done a ton of work on the uh Dom Library over the summer and and uh as part of Google sum of code a lot of the new features are thanks to him and uh if you have actual questions about how it works or what it does you can ask in the chat he knows more about it than I do and I am I shrinking I feel so tiny uh okay I'm just gonna leave it um okay um here we go oh look at this I swear every time I look over I'm getting smaller I'm going to just set check these settings One Time One More Time time on this shot um there we go ah I see I have to click in and out okay I should be I got a lot of Shadow and a lot of issues going on but it's such as life I need to the lighting somehow in here just totally changed but um here we go I only have 10 minutes now if I keep talking I'm going to lose all my time uh all right so this video is about a giant topic one again that I know very little about uh and that topic is CSS and so uh you know there's been a bunch of videos here that I've made about the Dom the document object model web pages HTML Pages JavaScript how they control HTML Pages let's just take a step back for a moment and and and look at the pieces we know about and what's this third piece that I'm adding so this web page this thing that you're seeing in the browser or in the sort of browser window of the p5js editor where I'm writing all the code there the the thing that this page loads is a file called index.html okay so and this is not a good pen I'm switching pens in this file there is some content written into that file for example uh there is a header that's at the top of the page there's a paragraph this file is also referring to some JavaScript code uh it's referring to a bunch of different things like the p5js library file uh our own code which is in a file called sketch. and in those files we're doing some JavaScript stuff like making a canvas drawing a circle to that canvas and perhaps even as we've seen in previous videos making other Dom elements like more paragraphs and affecting those and changing those elements so you can think of uh these pieces as HTML this is really the structure and you could also say like initial content in a way like what's on the page when it first loads of that web page JavaScript is logic code things that can handle events store information make all sorts of magic happen this is what you can think of as the behavior of the page so this is where you and I and every body else who's doing this stuff is writing code to control what's happening on that page over time based on us your interaction based on some mathematical algorithm based on whatever you might fancy you like to draw rainbows in a canvas unicorns do that with JavaScript I'm adding unicorns to my repertoire here only was at rainbrow okay so um then the last piece here that I want to talk about is this idea of CSS and CSS stands for cascading style sheets I don't know why they're cascading probably has to do with some sort of like nesting and whatever and somebody on the internet who really knows this stuff will hopefully write in the comments why it's cascading but the keyword there is style so if you want to affect various aspects of the layout of this page you want the canvas to actually float on the right side of the page rather than the left side of the page you want to change the font that's in the paragraphs you want to change the background color of a paragraph you want to any just about anything that you can imagine that has to do with the visual look and feel of that page can be controlled with this idea of CSS now once again we're in the same place as we were with HTML you could write HTML into that index.html file or you could dynamically sort of insert HTML elements into the page using JavaScript you can write you can sort of in give some initial content you can also control those elements using JavaScript the same thing is true with CSS there is a kind of file camera went off there is a kind another kind of file you could write uh I've disappeared from the world but I am still here you cannot see me but I am still here I will never leave until every one last person on Earth actually most people on Earth don't really need to know about CSS or maybe they should I don't really know I I that was a terrible idea but you're here watching this video maybe CSS is useful to you I'm gonna keep going um the HTML file the Javascript file now you can also add information about styles to another kind of file named maybe style named whatever you want css. JS for javascript. HTML for html. CSS now we're in what I meant by saying we're in the same situation is I want to talk about how do you add that style stuff to style.css and then or and or how much you add style dynamically on the Fly based on user interaction based on some set of behaviors in JavaScript this is the bigger picture here and then there's lots of details to fill in boy am I rambling about this but hopefully it's making some sense okay so how does CSS work CSS works on a sing a couple different principles one is this idea of a selector so you need to have a selector meaning what are are the things that you want to select to style do you want to select all the paragraphs on the page do you want to select just this one particular paragraph do you want to select the canvas do what what Dom elements do you want to select in order to style after you say after you specify that selector so for example let's say you want to style all the paragraph elements on the page your selector would be P then you need some open and close curly brackets much like you always do when you're doing these kinds of things to to denote the beginning and end of the stuff that will the style information that will be applied to that paragraph once you have that all you need are a series of name value pairs this looks kind of like a JavaScript object but the syntax is a little bit different these name value pairs are like what's the property you want to style and what's the value for that style for example I want to style the background color and I want the background color to be black or white that's white oh I want it to be like pinkish F ZF so you can be asking your question like oh my God what what is that that looks terrifying to me there's like a pound symol and then a letter and then a number so there's a lot of things to learn this is a certain kind of special way of writing a color information you know I think maybe this would have been a little bit simpler if I just wrote the word pink here or purple here that would also work there are a variety of different ways so now the question is what are the kinds of things that can go here you know font size is one of them I think so if I want to like change the font size there's so much that could go here how do you know what the possibilities are how do you add that to your CSS and then how do you do that with JavaScript how much time do we have uh I'm gonna I'm gonna let's go to the code and look at how that some of this works okay I I've disappeared but I'm going to come back to life Sun shine rain down upon me and give me some light and have I shall appear now in front of the camera okay I have to turn this down uh okay so here I am with a p5js project in the p5js editor I'm going to run this and you can see there again we're back here I have this H1 element this paragraph element this canvas another paragraph element a button some of these elements are written here into the HTML body right in advance these are HTML elements that appear on the page as soon as it loads some of these elements are created with JavaScript made dynamically when the program runs create a paragraph create a button okay this is where we are how do I start to style let's style that paragraph Okay so actually um what I'm going to do even though I said over here uh come back even though I said over here you can create I'm was going to create a separate CSS file I'll do that in a later video what actually this buttons a little hyperactive what actually I think I would like to do is show you how you can actually add CSS style information directly into the HTML page so inside of this head tag where I'm referring to JavaScript files I could also potentially refer to some style information so what's that syntax paragraph I want to select all of the paragraphs on the page and assign them a background color which is uh purple I wish I could type rainbow there do you think it works if I type rainbow there I doubt it okay so now if I save and I run this again we can see look this paragraph element has a purple background this paragraph element has a purple background you know what it's very hard for me to see the text so I think if I say this color it refers to the color of the text inside the paragraph I think and now you can see I have white text with a purple background it looks a little crowded in there so something that I might add to this is some padding and how much padding how about eight pixels PX for Pixel so I'm going to do this and look ah look at this I've got some nice padding now so this is the basic idea of CSS I need to select something on the page and then give it some properties what's the property what's the value what's the the property what's the value how do you know what all these possible properties are well you need to look this stuff up you could get books you watch other videos that where someone really knows about CSS is talking about this but um but uh and this is where so so let's look for this briefly in a moment and I have a couple more minutes left uh I am going to um uh ah so I am on here developer. Mozilla um so this is one place I'll put some links in the description for this video but here is a URL of where I could find some information about CSS I'm going to remove this part here this is a CSS reference there's a tutorial there's demos uh I want to look at the ref an exhaustive I'm exhausted already an exhaustive reference I'm going to look at the exhaustive reference and I'm going to see like look these are all of the possible things I could add there's so much I just keep scrolling and scrolling and scrolling and scrolling but we can look under I can look for like background color and you can see background color is right over here I can click on it and what do I see now I see here are some examples of of different ways that I can call background color I could say red I could say RGB I could say current all sorts of ways so this is a topic for another time another video for you to look on your own there's another CSS reference that I like to use if I could find it in my history here um I think it's this one right so I'll include a link to this this is a nice reference of all sorts of possible uh parameters in CSS the things that I want to focus on in in my videos is less about the full encompassing of all of the CSS reference and more about two things one is this how how do these selectors work what are other ways that I could specifically address a single paragraph or only some paragraph there's a lot of ways you can use these selectors so I want to get to that and the other thing I want to get to is how do you do style dynamically in JavaScript so um with p5js specifically so let's take at least another video um um I'm one of my future videos I'm going to talk more about selectors but in this particular video I want to look at the style function so here if I come back if I quit Chrome for a second and I come back to this we can see that these particular elements now these paragraph elements are all styled based on the hardcoded style information that's in the HTML file inside of the style tags but another thing I can do is right over here I can for any HTM any element that I create with P5 and later I'm going to show you any element that I access in P5 whether it was created or not I can call a function called style which then requires just two arguments what are those arguments the name of the style property the value of the style property so if I were to put right here in quotes background color and then I were to say in here in quotes pink you can see look at this this particular element is still getting the style from the HTML page this particular element whop I'm not there uh this particular element that down here is getting the style from my code so the when I apply a piece of styling dynamically in code uh it's going to overwrite the style that was originally set up in the HTML page so there's a lot of pieces here and for you essentially if you're following these videos along what I would suggest you do is try adding some style to the HTML file in the same way that I did here try adding some Styles this way what other tags might you reference try adding some Styles this way what happens if you add styles to other kinds of elements that aren't just paragraph elements and lastly and I'll do this for you really quickly set something style with an event okay let's think about this for example what if I say uh what if I were to say button. mous pressed change style right so now I am attaching the change style event to the Press of this button and what is that change style event it's a function that I need to write right the code inside this function right here will execute when I click the mouse on that button and maybe I'll change the text style to Pink and maybe I'll give it a lot more padding because who doesn't love padding jazz hands I don't know feel like that's going to be that's JavaScript the musical that's my first song who doesn't love padding you with me on that okay uh so now if we look at this everything's got its default style I'm going to trigger that event I got some more padding and uh a pink background so and you know maybe what I want to do I just I got to do a little bit more say text Mouse over change style oops and then uh I'll say button I'll say text Mouse out revert Style and what I can do here and I'm going to I'm just showing you some other things uh revert style and background purple padding eight pixels so let's take out the button event for a second I'm using Mouse out and mouse over I Mouse over I Mouse out I Mouse over I Mouse out I Mouse over that's a very rhythmic um so you can see here that you can start to highlight things make things happen based on button presses based on Mouse over bouse out based on the movement of a slider as we saw in the previous video so many possibilities so now you have something to work with try adding some style to the HTML page try adding some style using the style function see what types of elements what types of designs you can make and I'm going to come back and look at this again and again and again in several videos looking at other different types of scenarios with more events and more ways of selecting Elements which uh classes and IDs is the topic for that and just as a reminder uh go and look in those references that'll be linked below as to where you can find all this stuff so I'm 5 minutes over time not that that is relevant to you especially if you're watching this sometime in the future like in the year 2000 that was a while ago I guess but in my my childhood the year 2000 seemed like very far away uh the year 3000 is anybody watching this if you're watching this the year 3000 please go and get my brain out of that cryogenic thing that it's in and I don't know yeah do something with it talk to me about rainbows okay goodbye and I'll see you in a future video I have toit stop now okay live stream I don't know if that came across and worked uh anybody there's some discussion here uh so thanks for I I've got to go unfortunately I'm going to try to do some more live streams as soon as I have some more time I've got a whole long list of Dom manipulation videos to make and also I um I have a whole bunch from this morning that I need to upload and correct because there were some problems in them so goodbye for now please be in touch and uh I hope to see you all again in this weird strange context that is this live streaming thing uh okay how do I stop this um I wonder if I just hit settings here no oh wait look I'll play an ad who wants to watch an ad while I wait to figure out how to stop I won't do the ad right now the stream is public advanced settings maybe I'm just supposed to stop it from clicking a button in wirecast so I'm going to do that okay I'm going to click this button it's definitely going to shut off goodbye
