00:07 - hello and welcome to a few 5g really how
00:11 - about seven that was kind of pathetic
00:13 - but I just had to do it I'm gonna mute
00:16 - this right now what I have here is a p5
00:20 - jazz sketch that is playing a sound file
00:23 - and this is a first video in a playlist
00:26 - series of videos about working with
00:28 - sound in p5 guess where we'll cover
00:31 - things from playing back music sound
00:33 - effects sound synthesis and playing
00:35 - melodies beat detection also queuing
00:39 - things to happen at certain points in
00:41 - music this is my random list of topics
00:43 - in my head right now but this very first
00:44 - video all I want to do is kind of start
00:47 - with this idea of loading a sound so the
00:49 - very first thing that I want to look at
00:51 - with you the viewer listener here is how
00:55 - to load a sound file now there are lots
00:58 - of different sound file formats I'm
01:00 - going to use a sound file format mp3 and
01:03 - the function that I want to use is in NP
01:06 - 5 is this function called load sound so
01:10 - what load sound does and in here the the
01:13 - argument that load sound requires is a
01:15 - file name you can actually give it an
01:16 - array of several different file names if
01:19 - you have multiple file if you have that
01:20 - same sound file in multiple formats and
01:23 - then different browsers based on what
01:25 - formats are compatible was kind of like
01:27 - picked the right one all magically
01:28 - behind-the-scenes but I'm going to skip
01:30 - all that and I'm just going to pass in
01:32 - the mp3 file here so let me show you the
01:36 - gist of how this works
01:37 - so I'm going to come over here and I'm
01:40 - going to go to my finder and desktop I
01:44 - have this folder here called play music
01:47 - and in that folder is a mp3 file that is
01:51 - called just like a rainbow by the
01:54 - columbian so this just to give credit
01:56 - where credit is due this particular this
02:00 - particular track comes is available on
02:02 - free music archive a Creative Commons
02:05 - license available for derivative work so
02:07 - I'm using it in this video it's got a
02:09 - nice old tiny sound to it that you're
02:11 - already heard
02:12 - and what I'm gonna do is now go to my
02:14 - code and I realize I already wrote the
02:16 - code for this I'm going to quickly
02:17 - delete that code yeah quickly delete
02:19 - that good query delete that code you
02:21 - didn't see it you didn't see it
02:22 - submissive oh I'm in a bike men in black
02:25 - erase your memory thing okay but anyway
02:29 - so the first thing you need is a
02:30 - variable so you need a variable to keep
02:32 - track of a reference to whatever you're
02:35 - going to load with a load sound over
02:38 - here so um you might think oh I'll just
02:40 - do something like this var song equals
02:42 - load sound and then say file dot mp3
02:45 - this absolutely will not work because
02:49 - the issue with what I've written here is
02:52 - load sound as a p5.js function is not
02:55 - available outside of setup or draw so
02:58 - another option I might do is all I want
03:00 - song to be a global variable but what
03:02 - I'll do is in setup I'll say this and
03:05 - then I'm going to say song dot play so
03:09 - this might be your kind of instinct here
03:11 - which is that uh what I want to do is
03:14 - load a particular sound and then
03:16 - immediately play it the thing is
03:19 - remember you and I here in this world
03:22 - that we're in which you are programming
03:25 - in JavaScript and JavaScript is the land
03:28 - of asynchronous callbacks things
03:30 - happening on their own schedule so we
03:33 - can't rely on the sound this large sound
03:37 - file might not actually be ready by the
03:40 - time we get to song dot play it's still
03:41 - going to be loading so we need some way
03:44 - to guarantee the file is loaded before
03:47 - we ask to play it and there are two ways
03:49 - to do this and I wrote these over here
03:51 - there's the sort of preload way and the
03:54 - callback way so let me first show you
03:56 - the preload way so everything a
04:00 - JavaScript of you know and in the world
04:02 - really in some ways is about events and
04:04 - we currently have a set up event in a
04:06 - draw event set up happens first draw
04:09 - loops over and over again but guess what
04:11 - in p5 there's a secret event that
04:13 - actually happens before setup it's like
04:15 - the pre setup so that thing is called
04:21 - preload so what I can actually do
04:25 - do is put things now preload is not for
04:28 - just stuff that you want to happen have
04:30 - happened before set up preload is only
04:32 - for things like loading files loading
04:36 - date loading media loading things that
04:38 - you want to make sure are finished
04:39 - loading before setup p5 is a special way
04:42 - of handling this behind the scenes but
04:43 - anything that you load load sound load
04:45 - image load video I mean load video is
04:48 - not a function I think idiots create
04:49 - great video but those types of things
04:51 - you can put in preload so now if I were
04:55 - to run this this would work because song
04:57 - play can be called because load sound is
04:59 - in preload now that file that mp3 is not
05:02 - the name of my file so I'm going to go
05:04 - just grab the actual name of my file and
05:07 - put it in here whoops and then I should
05:10 - be able to and let me just actually just
05:12 - rename the file to rainbow right now
05:14 - just to make things a little bit simpler
05:16 - looking at the code and now I'm going to
05:22 - unmute this tab and hit refresh
05:27 - that's scratching record so this works
05:39 - okay now what I do actually is in the
05:43 - console here since long ago
05:46 - I could just do that stop is a function
05:49 - that will stop a particular song from
05:52 - playing and then I could also play it
05:56 - again I'll also mention here oh oh it's
06:02 - very loud it's very loud so one thing
06:05 - that I think we should do I'm having an
06:06 - issue with my video recording sound
06:08 - setup thing where the volume of the
06:11 - sound is a bit too high compared to the
06:12 - mic people in the chat are telling me to
06:15 - keep dancing but you watching this as a
06:17 - video tutorial so don't want to see I
06:18 - can make a separate dancing only video
06:21 - there's also a theory going around the
06:22 - internet that I'm like a centaur or
06:24 - something cuz you can't see my legs but
06:26 - I guarantee you that I have actual legs
06:27 - we were wearing shorts IG's it's very
06:29 - hot okay um though I like the idea of
06:32 - being it then maybe being a centaur is a
06:34 - little bit weird I read more like a
06:35 - unicorn unicorn ah a unicorn are with a
06:38 - little like horn and some purple hair
06:40 - perhaps would be nicer for me that'd be
06:42 - more appropriate really gone off the
06:45 - deep end here so what I want to do
06:46 - actually you know we're here I have an
06:48 - excuse now to also show you that I can
06:50 - say other I could call all sorts of
06:52 - other functions on the particular song
06:54 - variable like set volume and I could say
06:57 - 0.5 so this will make the volume the
07:00 - volume is a number between 0 & 1 1 being
07:03 - at full volume 0 being at no volume so
07:05 - let me just do that and I can hit
07:06 - refresh and it should be a little bit
07:08 - quieter I could do a little each other I
07:12 - get one bottle just so you can hear it
07:15 - should be quieter when you should be
07:16 - able to hear me okay
07:18 - um that's one thing you could do while
07:21 - we're at it why not just stop it for a
07:26 - second uh I should let it play in the
07:28 - background actually let's let it play in
07:29 - the background uh while we're at it I
07:31 - might as well show you that I could
07:33 - consider doing things like slider equals
07:38 - create slider so if I create a slider
07:42 - then I need a couple things I need a
07:45 - range between zero and one I want to
07:49 - start at point five and I want to
07:50 - increment of like you know zero point
07:53 - zero one and then I could always say in
07:55 - draw now some got set volume slider
07:59 - value so this would allow me to now if i
08:02 - refresh this I should get a slider here
08:06 - and I can turn the volume off so this is
08:15 - good for me because now I can let this
08:17 - page run and I can keep that slider
08:19 - there so there's a lot of possibilities
08:21 - in terms of making sound very quickly
08:23 - and easily interactive in the browser
08:25 - with a slider a button set volume this
08:28 - is the basic idea but I digress
08:29 - uh because I forgot that what I was here
08:34 - for was to talk about now okay so here's
08:37 - the thing let me run this again and I'm
08:40 - actually having to start with a volume
08:41 - of zero just to like not have the sound
08:43 - play for a second
08:44 - notice see that message there it's there
08:47 - for a while let me zoom in on that again
08:49 - so p5 behind the scenes that preload
08:53 - function it can't make the canvas I
08:55 - can't do any man animation it can't do
08:56 - anything until that sound file is
08:59 - finished loading so behind the scenes
09:01 - automatically it just puts this the text
09:04 - loading there in a div or something so
09:06 - that you can see that something is
09:08 - happening so here's the thing you
09:09 - eventually making a fancy or more
09:12 - complex elaborate project you might
09:14 - actually want to have stuff you might
09:17 - first of all you might have like 50
09:18 - sound files and you don't want the user
09:19 - to sit there and watch it loading for
09:21 - several minutes you also might just want
09:24 - to have an animation start it's fine if
09:25 - it takes a bit to load and it'll play
09:27 - once it's loaded
09:27 - so this
09:29 - is the idea of a callback so instead of
09:35 - using preload there's a way for you to
09:37 - have your sketch and animation begin
09:39 - immediately and allow yourself to then
09:42 - trigger an event a callback when the
09:44 - sounds is finished loading so let's look
09:46 - at how to do that briefly okay so where
09:49 - am I
09:50 - I'm over here no I'm over here yes gotta
09:53 - work on the cut button okay ah code okay
09:56 - so the difference is now I want to
09:58 - eliminate preload eliminate preload and
10:03 - I'm going to put this back into setup I
10:06 - can even keep the slider there but I can
10:09 - no longer have song dot play in setup
10:12 - because um why can i no longer have saw
10:19 - not play in setup because because the
10:23 - sound won't have finished loading it so
10:24 - what load sound can have is a second
10:27 - argument that second argument being the
10:30 - function that's triggered when the sound
10:32 - is ready so I'm going to just right in
10:34 - here and say I'm going to say loaded
10:37 - which means I can now write a function
10:43 - called loaded and I can say song dot
10:46 - play in that function so look what I'm
10:48 - doing here I have a global variable
10:50 - called song I call load sound in the
10:53 - setup and then I don't actually play the
10:57 - sound until the sound is loaded and this
11:00 - callback is triggered this is very
11:03 - similar to things that I looked at in
11:05 - some other videos with like low JSON and
11:07 - loading data and that type of thing okay
11:09 - so let's see if this works
11:15 - and you can see it's working but and we
11:21 - didn't see that the point is we didn't
11:23 - see that loading thing so you know I
11:26 - could if I actually had some sort of
11:28 - animation going on here and let's let's
11:32 - have the volume start at 0.5 you can see
11:36 - that well before the sound is playing
11:38 - animation is started so that's nice
11:42 - infection rate lucky use the callback um
11:46 - now I'm starting to feel like a little
11:48 - bit crazy person like that song is just
11:50 - like looping the beginning of it in my
11:51 - head over and over again okay so how are
11:53 - we doing here I think we've gotten
11:54 - through let's see what I've got on my
11:55 - list little Mentalist here we talked
11:57 - about um so this is an easy one play
12:00 - I've been using dot play I don't I use
12:02 - dot play it just plays the song and when
12:04 - it gets to the end it stops I could also
12:07 - use loop and loop is going to you know
12:09 - it's going to whenever gets to the end
12:10 - it's going to start over from the
12:11 - beginning so if you have a background
12:12 - track for some type of animation call
12:14 - loop at the beginning it will play
12:15 - forever we looked at set volume and
12:21 - maybe what I'm going to do really
12:22 - quickly right now is look at rate and
12:24 - pan and then I'm going to do jump and
12:27 - add cue in the next video so let's
12:29 - quickly just add looking at manipulating
12:31 - the sound with rate and pan so I'm going
12:37 - to just create a couple more sliders a
12:39 - slider volume slider rate and slider pan
12:49 - so and I'm actually going to get rid of
12:52 - the volume slider and I'm going to add
12:56 - slider rate and I'm going to add a
13:01 - slider pan and what I'm going to do is
13:06 - I'm going to say a song okay so I want
13:10 - to do a pan so I'm going to comment
13:13 - these out right now and we'll get you in
13:16 - a second pan and rates and slider pan
13:20 - and slider rate okay so what's going on
13:25 - here
13:26 - the rate is the speed at which a sound
13:30 - is played back so let's think about the
13:32 - range of that well if I want it let's do
13:34 - rate first if I want it played back at
13:37 - its default rate that value would be one
13:40 - if I want it to be half the speed it'd
13:42 - be 0.5 if I want it to be double the
13:44 - speed it would be two so let's make the
13:46 - rate go between zero and three and
13:51 - uh let's call song dot right here in
13:54 - draw with the slider so I'm going to run
13:57 - this you got the song playing it now I
14:01 - can kick the second slider go back here
14:03 - oh and let me make it a slider and let
14:10 - me get rid of the panel side okay so if
14:17 - I want to dance at the regular rate I'll
14:21 - do that now let's turn it up so we can
14:28 - see how your five times the Tiki
14:31 - we've got like chipmunk stared right
14:33 - here got a little people in the chat or
14:40 - like talking about me like I'm a total
14:41 - crazy person which clearly yeah okay but
14:44 - you can hear it's lower down so I don't
14:45 - know maybe I just want to make the range
14:48 - between zero and one point five so you
15:01 - get the idea here you can also adjust
15:02 - the rate and it's also adjusting the
15:04 - pitch at that point and I'm sure there
15:06 - are clever you know sound magic math
15:09 - formulas till they speed it up but keep
15:10 - the pitch but that's not part of the
15:12 - short for default 0.5 Jes library and
15:15 - then I can also add the pan I have no
15:18 - idea if you'll be able to hear this
15:20 - now pan means am I going from the left
15:25 - speaker to the right speaker
15:27 - we're panning the span the sound back
15:30 - and forth from if you're wearing
15:31 - headphones left here to right here so
15:33 - I'll be curious if this works at all in
15:35 - this particular video tutorial okay so
15:39 - here we go ah so what is the range the
15:43 - range is between negative 1 and 1 so
15:45 - negative 1 by the way I'd be curious
15:49 - what happens if you watch these videos
15:50 - at two-speed
15:51 - anyway negative 1 being left and 1 being
15:55 - right so let's put that slider back in
15:58 - and I'm just going to get rid of the
15:59 - rates right now and put it just that
16:02 - okay whew oh I have it at 25 and put on
16:08 - one oh no no zero so I want the default
16:13 - to be at zero okay so listen you should
16:16 - be hearing the sound in both ears right
16:20 - I'm going to pan it now I can hear on my
16:25 - laptop
16:27 - there's only coming out of the right
16:28 - speaker I'm out of the left hand to the
16:31 - left I hear how to the left for not at
16:34 - all so I can pan back and forth which
16:37 - you can imagine in real time you created
16:39 - hook everybody I have now reached the
16:46 - end of this particular video about
16:48 - loading sound so this is just the basics
16:50 - just kind of getting started here I'm
16:51 - gonna make a lot of videos about
16:52 - different things you can do with sound
16:54 - in the browser of p5.js but at least we
16:56 - have now loading an mp3 pile playing it
16:58 - back adjusting its volume it's rate it's
17:00 - playback all that sort of stuff figuring
17:02 - out how to loaded with preload loading
17:03 - with a callback that sort of thing and
17:05 - in the next video I'm going to look at
17:06 - the cue the jump and add cue function
17:08 - which I think will be be some
17:10 - interesting things that you might not be
17:11 - aware of as possible

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to a few 5g really how about seven that was kind of pathetic but I just had to do it I'm gonna mute this right now what I have here is a p5 jazz sketch that is playing a sound file and this is a first video in a playlist series of videos about working with sound in p5 guess where we'll cover things from playing back music sound effects sound synthesis and playing melodies beat detection also queuing things to happen at certain points in music this is my random list of topics in my head right now but this very first video all I want to do is kind of start with this idea of

works so I'm going to come over here and I'm going to go to my finder and desktop I have this folder here called play music and in that folder is a mp3 file that is called just like a rainbow by the columbian so this just to give credit where credit is due this particular this particular track comes is available on free music archive a Creative Commons license available for derivative work so I'm using it in this video it's got a nice old tiny sound to it that you're already heard and what I'm gonna do is now go to my code and I realize I already wrote the code for this I'm going to quickly

want to start at point five and I want to increment of like you know zero point zero one and then I could always say in draw now some got set volume slider value so this would allow me to now if i refresh this I should get a slider here and I can turn the volume off so this is good for me because now I can let this page run and I can keep that slider there so there's a lot of possibilities in terms of making sound very quickly and easily interactive in the browser with a slider a button set volume this is the basic idea but I digress uh because I forgot that what I was here for was to talk about now okay so here's the thing let me run this again and I'm actually having to start with a volume of zero just to like not have the sound play for a second notice see that message there it's there for a while let me zoom in on that again so p5 behind the scenes that preload function it can't make the canvas I can't do any man animation it can't do anything until that sound file is finished loading so behind the scenes automatically it just puts this the text loading there in a div or something so that you can see that something is happening so here's the thing you eventually making a fancy or more complex elaborate project you might actually want to have stuff you might first of all you might have like 50 sound files and you don't want the user to sit there and watch it loading for several minutes you also might just want to have an animation start it's fine if it takes a bit to load and it'll play once it's loaded so this is the idea of a callback so instead of using preload there's a way for you to have your sketch and animation begin immediately and allow yourself to then trigger an event a callback when the sounds is finished loading so let's look at how to do that briefly okay so where am I I'm over here no I'm over here yes gotta work on the cut button okay ah code okay so the difference is now I want to eliminate preload eliminate preload and I'm going to put this back into setup I can even keep the slider there but I can no longer have song dot play in setup because um why can i no longer have saw not play in setup because because the sound won't have finished loading it so what load sound can have is a second argument that second argument being the function that's triggered when the sound is ready so I'm going to just right in here and say I'm going to say loaded which means I can now write a function called loaded and I can say song dot play in that function so look what I'm doing here I have a global variable called song I call load sound in the setup and then I don't actually play the sound until the sound is loaded and this callback is triggered this is very similar to things that I looked at in some other videos with like low JSON and loading data and that type of thing okay so let's see if this works and you can see it's working but and we didn't see that the point is we didn't see that loading thing so you know I could if I actually had some sort of animation going on here and let's let's have the volume start at 0.5 you can see that well before the sound is playing animation is started so that's nice infection rate lucky use the callback um now I'm starting to feel like a little bit crazy person like that song is just like looping the beginning of it in my head over and over again okay so how are we doing here I think we've gotten through let's see what I've got on my list little Mentalist here we talked about um so this is an easy one play I've been using dot play I don't I use dot play it just plays the song and when it gets to the end it stops I could also use loop and loop is going to you know it's going to whenever gets to the end it's going to start over from the beginning so if you have a background track for some type of animation call loop at the beginning it will play forever we looked at set volume and maybe what I'm going to do really quickly right now is look at rate and pan and then I'm going to do jump and add cue in the next video so let's quickly just add looking at manipulating the sound with rate and pan so I'm going to just create a couple more sliders a slider volume slider rate and slider pan so and I'm actually going to get rid of the volume slider and I'm going to add slider rate and I'm going to add a slider pan and what I'm going to do is I'm going to say a song okay so I want to do a pan so I'm going to comment these out right now and we'll get you in a second pan and rates and slider pan and slider rate okay so what's going on here the rate is the speed at which a sound is played back so let's think about the range of that well if I want it let's do rate first if I want it played back at its default rate that value would be one if I want it to be half the speed it'd be 0.5 if I want it to be double the speed it would be two so let's make the rate go between zero and three and uh let's call song dot right here in draw with the slider so I'm going to run this you got the song playing it now I can kick the second slider go back here oh and let me make it a slider and let me get rid of the panel side okay so if I want to dance at the regular rate I'll do that now let's turn it up so we can see how your five times the Tiki we've got like chipmunk stared right here got a little people in the chat or like talking about me like I'm a total crazy person which clearly yeah okay but you can hear it's lower down so I don't know maybe I just want to make the range between zero and one point five so you get the idea here you can also adjust the rate and it's also adjusting the pitch at that point and I'm sure there are clever you know sound magic math formulas till they speed it up but keep the pitch but that's not part of the short for default 0.5 Jes library and then I can also add the pan I have no idea if you'll be able to hear this now pan means am I going from the left speaker to the right speaker we're panning the span the sound back and forth from if you're wearing headphones left here to right here so I'll be curious if this works at all in this particular video tutorial okay so here we go ah so what is the range the range is between negative 1 and 1 so negative 1 by the way I'd be curious what happens if you watch these videos at twospeed anyway negative 1 being left and 1 being right so let's put that slider back in and I'm just going to get rid of the rates right now and put it just that okay whew oh I have it at 25 and put on one oh no no zero so I want the default to be at zero okay so listen you should be hearing the sound in both ears right I'm going to pan it now I can hear on my laptop there's only coming out of the right speaker I'm out of the left hand to the left I hear how to the left for not at all so I can pan back and forth which you can imagine in real time you created hook everybody I have now reached the end of this particular video about loading sound so this is just the basics just kind of getting started here I'm gonna make a lot of videos about different things you can do with sound in the browser of p5.js but at least we have now loading an mp3 pile playing it back adjusting its volume it's rate it's playback all that sort of stuff figuring out how to loaded with preload loading with a callback that sort of thing and in the next video I'm going to look at the cue the jump and add cue function which I think will be be some interesting things that you might not be aware of as possible
