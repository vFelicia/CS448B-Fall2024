00:00 - okay I've got one more probably more
00:02 - than that but at least one more thing to
00:03 - show you about Chrome extensions I'm
00:05 - gonna show you about overrides what is
00:06 - it override so first of all if you use
00:09 - the Chrome browser and you ever hit
00:10 - command T or new tab you get this
00:12 - default page which has a Google search
00:15 - and like shows you some recent web pages
00:17 - that you've been to this is something
00:18 - you can override you can create your own
00:20 - web page that appears for a new tab and
00:23 - there are lots of examples of Chrome
00:26 - extensions that you can get that show
00:27 - you pretty nice things and daily
00:29 - affirmations and stuff like that you can
00:33 - also override the history page and well
00:36 - something else where do you find out
00:37 - information about this it's I'll include
00:39 - a link to this in this video's
00:40 - description this is the documentation
00:41 - for override pages so you can override
00:43 - the bookmark page the history page and
00:45 - the new tab page I'm going to override
00:47 - just the new tab page and the way that
00:50 - we do this is by adding this code here
00:53 - to the manifest.json so I'm gonna copy
00:58 - this and I'm gonna go to the manifest
01:01 - JSON for a new Chrome extension I'm
01:04 - gonna get rid of the content script I
01:05 - just copied one of my previous ones I
01:07 - could get I don't need a content script
01:08 - as part of this and actually it wouldn't
01:11 - make sense to have a new tab override
01:13 - that also had a Content script I don't
01:14 - think so and I want to override new tab
01:18 - and what I want to do is point to my
01:23 - HTML page and I happen to have
01:28 - associated with this project this is my
01:32 - example number 6 a folder called sketch
01:35 - and it this is a p5 sketch and as an
01:38 - index on a HTML page so what I want to
01:40 - say is sketch slash index at HTML I am
01:46 - going to just say function setup create
01:51 - canvas 200 200 you know background 0 and
01:56 - I'm gonna say I'm gonna add something
01:59 - here like h1 hears a kitten cuz people
02:02 - make a new so I'm gonna add some stuff
02:06 - to the HTML and to the JavaScript just
02:08 - to see that this works now what I'm
02:10 - going to do is go to my extensions page
02:12 - I am going
02:13 - load the extension I want to load my
02:17 - example number six ah great I got an
02:20 - error what is my error looks like I have
02:23 - an extra comma here and it's telling me
02:25 - that I don't have valid JSON so I should
02:27 - be able to go back to my manifest.json
02:29 - get rid of that comma hit save try to
02:33 - then say a retry that worked and now I
02:37 - should open a new page yep
02:39 - so every time I open a new tab I get
02:42 - that webpage so let's make it do
02:44 - something a little more interesting
02:45 - let's say let's let's actually not have
02:50 - a canvas
02:51 - you obviously have an animation just say
02:53 - no canvas I'm gonna say R equals a
02:57 - random number between 1 and 6 because I
03:02 - actually want you know I'm going to say
03:04 - between 0 & 1 2 3 4 5 0 & 5 I have what
03:11 - I have is and then I'm gonna say a
03:13 - create image kittens / r + dot jpg so
03:25 - what you might notice is that I have a
03:27 - folder called kittens with 5 images of
03:30 - kittens all named 1 through 5 so I
03:33 - probably should have started naming him
03:35 - with 0 but I could just add 1 to it so I
03:37 - want to create a Dom element which is a
03:40 - kitten image and show it on the page so
03:41 - I'm gonna do that and I'm going to and
03:44 - we might have an issue I mean I'm just
03:46 - waiting to see what happens I'm going to
03:49 - reload the extension I'm gonna make a
03:51 - new tab up whoa that is and it worked
03:55 - well now here's the thing
03:57 - I should probably size it and I'm just
04:03 - gonna say image size window with window
04:07 - height image top position 0 0 so I mean
04:13 - this is some silly I should probably be
04:14 - more thoughtful about CSS and all that
04:16 - but I'm just going to use some p5 code
04:18 - to size the image to the page and maybe
04:21 - I'll get rid of the hears a kitten
04:23 - message now I'm going to
04:26 - reload again and now make a new tab or
04:30 - every time I make a new tab I get a
04:33 - different kitten
04:34 - yay so this is how you do a override so
04:38 - now the world is your kitten oyster
04:43 - think of what you might make something
04:45 - that checks the today's weather if you
04:47 - want to make something practical
04:48 - something that shows something beautiful
04:49 - something that reminds you of an
04:51 - important message anything that you can
04:53 - think of you can make anything you can
04:55 - make a webpage you can make as the new
04:57 - tab override thanks for watching
04:59 - subscribe like I'm supposed to say at
05:01 - the end of the video this was a short
05:02 - one so maybe you might actually hear me
05:09 - [Music]
05:14 - you
