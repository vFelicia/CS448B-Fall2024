02:44 - check one two testing my audio i had a
02:46 - little bit of a
02:48 - just bitty disaster as i tripped over
02:50 - the hdmi cable connected to my camera
02:53 - and uh i had to go find another hdmi
02:55 - cable but amazingly i'm
02:57 - barely late so uh i will be starting in
03:00 - just about a minute and a half let me
03:01 - know how my audio is
03:03 - thank you very much
03:04 - [Music]

04:38 - [Music]
04:55 - hello welcome to the coding train it's a
04:58 - kind of a miracle
05:00 - that i am here for you on camera
05:01 - slightly off to the side
05:03 - because i actually had no idea what i
05:05 - would look like when i pressed the
05:06 - button
05:07 - to switch to this camera right here to
05:09 - broadcast and live stream this
05:11 - if i move over this way because i
05:13 - tripped over i knocked the tripod over
05:15 - the
05:15 - cables went flying when the hdmi cables
05:17 - got bent
05:19 - i had already pressed start to the music
05:22 - actually no that was right before i
05:23 - pressed start i got another cable then i
05:25 - pressed start anyway
05:26 - it was like a mad rush in the last five
05:28 - minutes
05:29 - to get started here but i'm looking over
05:31 - and the lighting seems fine
05:32 - i'm assuming people can hear me uh i see
05:35 - audio coming through
05:36 - and i'm sitting here i wore a a slightly
05:39 - nicer shirt than i usually do on a
05:40 - saturday for you today
05:42 - i hope you appreciate that you don't
05:43 - need to appreciate that but
05:45 - uh i appreciate you i should be the one
05:48 - appreciating you
05:49 - um i do want to maybe make some
05:51 - adjustments here but before i do
05:53 - any of that i'm really excited to tell
05:55 - you about a new sponsor i have for the
05:56 - coding train live streams
05:58 - and so i want to very quickly let's see
06:01 - if i can press the right buttons to make
06:02 - this happen
06:03 - i'm going to click over here ah and i'm
06:06 - excited to tell you about today's
06:07 - sponsor
06:08 - of the coding train curiosity stream
06:11 - so launched by media visionary john
06:13 - hendricks who founded the discovery
06:15 - channel you know back when it was
06:17 - actually good
06:18 - um you know it's lot of reality tv on
06:19 - there now uh qrsd stream is the
06:21 - award-winning destination for
06:23 - documentary films and tv shows covering
06:25 - every topic from space exploration
06:26 - to adventure to the secret lives of wild
06:28 - animals so you can sign up see that link
06:30 - that's above me there
06:32 - curiositystream.com
06:33 - codingtree uh if you sign up at that
06:35 - link hopefully somebody can post it into
06:36 - the chat
06:37 - um it's also in the video's description
06:39 - you'll get a 26
06:41 - discount on the annual hd plan it's
06:44 - 14.79 for the entire year which is kind
06:47 - of mind-blowing
06:48 - to me i know money means a different
06:49 - thing to different people all over the
06:50 - world but
06:51 - i was thinking about how much i'd spend
06:52 - on just renting a movie time to time
06:55 - um and so uh um there's just a huge
06:57 - library of stuff
06:58 - you will also get access to the
07:00 - streaming video service nebula
07:01 - that i've talked about on several
07:02 - occasions here on the coding train
07:04 - um you can also see coding train videos
07:06 - on nebula a lot of other original
07:08 - content and from youtube creators when
07:11 - you sign up for curiosity stream using
07:13 - the link that's above me
07:14 - and hopefully by now it's gotten posted
07:16 - to the chat and i see that nico
07:19 - thank you for posting to the chat so um
07:21 - back to
07:22 - here so i'll come back and um we'll
07:24 - maybe look at a couple
07:25 - interesting recommendations i have for
07:27 - you i was watching last night a
07:28 - documentary on the on moose and there's
07:30 - like moose
07:31 - i think it's called moose on curiosity
07:32 - streams with my kids because
07:34 - we love to watch nature shows little
07:36 - cute little moose babies they were so
07:38 - wonderful
07:39 - um anyway really helps me out if you
07:41 - consider signing up so
07:43 - um i what am i gonna do today today is a
07:46 - day of coding
07:49 - that's ostensibly what i do um and i
07:52 - want to
07:52 - open today with looking at some of the
07:55 - recent video tutorials and by the way
07:57 - my glasses are incredibly dirty i can
08:00 - barely see a thing
08:02 - is there any way that i could possibly
08:04 - clean them
08:05 - maybe before i start live streaming for
08:08 - all i know there's like a giant piece of
08:10 - like
08:11 - jelly on my face i was having a peanut
08:13 - butter and jelly crepe earlier is that a
08:15 - weird thing to announce on live
08:18 - youtube in any case
08:21 - um i'm a little bit discombobulated even
08:24 - a little bit more so than i usually am i
08:26 - am enjoying looking at the chat
08:27 - i'm going to move this document out of
08:29 - the way uh
08:31 - and go over here and am i in the right
08:34 - discord channel i am oh
08:36 - have you joined the coding train discord
08:40 - let's see if i can open that up um oh
08:42 - good you're not seeing it because i want
08:43 - you to see it in a second
08:46 - i'm going to go over to here
08:50 - this is where the coding train community
08:54 - uh hangs out um during the times in
08:58 - between my live streams
09:01 - uh there's a wonderful community of
09:03 - folks there we've added some new
09:05 - moderators recently thank you to
09:06 - everyone who's come aboard
09:08 - to help moderate the discord um but
09:10 - mostly the reason why i mention it is as
09:12 - i'm doing stuff today on the live stream
09:14 - various things that i might be coding or
09:16 - talking about
09:17 - i will post links to them so i mean
09:20 - obviously i could post them to the
09:21 - youtube chat maybe that would be more
09:22 - efficient but
09:23 - i don't have easy access to that i like
09:25 - to kind of keep things um
09:27 - the youtube chat could disappear and who
09:29 - knows so i like to post things to this
09:31 - discord channel as i'm going
09:32 - so um i would love for you to join you
09:35 - can go to
09:36 - thecodingtrain.com discord or i have
09:39 - this button here
09:40 - when i press it it puts an invite to the
09:42 - discord in the chat i love
09:43 - my elgato stream deck it's over here
09:46 - it's really cool
09:48 - i'm looking at you elgato um
09:51 - [Music]
09:52 - let's see what else do i want to say
09:58 - so i'll be here till about three o'clock
09:59 - as some of you who might have watched my
10:01 - other recent live streams
10:02 - um saturdays uh one of these days i
10:04 - should really like not live stream and
10:05 - do the baking class with my kids
10:08 - but my kids are taking a zoom baking
10:10 - class today i believe is a pear
10:12 - tart so it goes between one and three
10:16 - they're not completely unsupervised in
10:17 - the kitchen
10:18 - there's another adult present
10:21 - uh making sure you know nothing light's
10:22 - on fire they're you know they're nine
10:24 - and 12. so they can handle themselves
10:25 - it's not like there's a
10:27 - you know two-year-old turning the oven
10:28 - on anymore it's uh that's just that
10:30 - didn't
10:30 - happen if it did i i apologize to all
10:33 - the other two-year-olds who am i even
10:35 - talking to anymore sometimes it's very
10:37 - hard
10:37 - to just keep speaking words continuously
10:40 - when you're in a room by yourself
10:42 - in an attic really staring at a camera
10:46 - i do see the outside world there's a
10:48 - nice window over there
10:49 - and i see brooklyn i see little rooftops
10:51 - of buildings and
10:53 - looks like the sun is coming out uh the
10:55 - snow is sort of melting although we're
10:56 - supposed to get four inches of snow
10:57 - tomorrow
10:58 - what was i was i but but i'm gonna jump
11:00 - right in because time is a wasting and i
11:02 - have a limited amount of time
11:03 - so this spring if you've been following
11:05 - me recently and i'm
11:06 - i'm you know a little bit crawling
11:08 - through the mud here and making progress
11:09 - although i am making progress
11:11 - this spring from now until probably
11:13 - through the summer really but at least
11:15 - until
11:15 - uh april or may it's not the spring yet
11:18 - it's clearly the winter if you look
11:20 - outside in new york city but my focus
11:22 - is the nature of code so let me uh say a
11:25 - few words about that
11:28 - first of all you can check out the
11:30 - nature of code book
11:31 - i'm not trying to sell you something
11:32 - here this is actually a um
11:35 - you know there are ways that you can
11:36 - support the project if you feel so
11:37 - inclined but this is a
11:39 - uh an open source uh book project with
11:42 - 10 chapters about creative coding and
11:44 - physics simulation
11:45 - um that um i really should figure out
11:47 - what i always want to say that i
11:49 - published in somebody fact check me on
11:51 - this
11:52 - i think i think i published this in 2012
11:55 - that's my guess
11:56 - right now i had to guess um but i
11:59 - haven't
12:00 - and i've been talking about publishing a
12:02 - second edition of it
12:03 - probably for like the last four or five
12:05 - years so you can see how well this is
12:06 - going
12:07 - um but i am really trying to double down
12:10 - on that make that my sole focus
12:12 - i'm teaching a course at nyu right now
12:15 - called
12:16 - guess what drum roll the nature of code
12:19 - um and i'm going to go over here and one
12:21 - of the things that i'm really excited
12:22 - about that i figured out how to do
12:24 - is we started using um at nyu well we
12:27 - nyu is now using a learning management
12:30 - system
12:31 - it's called brightspace i don't know if
12:32 - any of you use it
12:34 - for your schools or if you are involved
12:36 - with schools
12:37 - but i i really want not wanting to use
12:40 - learning management systems
12:41 - because i don't want the content that i
12:46 - work the educational content that i work
12:47 - on to be locked into
12:49 - a proprietary system um at the same time
12:53 - students privacy is a big concern um
12:56 - there's often a lot of
12:57 - you know postings and chatter and sort
12:59 - of administrative
13:01 - stuff that goes along with running a
13:03 - course that i don't want to be in
13:06 - an open platform so what i finally
13:08 - figured out how to do
13:10 - was keep all of my notes for each week
13:12 - so if i go here i'm just going to go to
13:13 - module 1 vectors
13:15 - keep them all as in an open source repo
13:17 - this is basically the assignment the
13:20 - videos and uh reading material
13:22 - some of this right now actually
13:23 - unfortunately if you click on this pdf
13:25 - maybe i can remedy this as only
13:27 - that's when the draft pdfs i've only
13:28 - made available in google drive if you
13:30 - have certain permissions but
13:31 - i don't mind sharing those more broadly
13:33 - but the point of what i'm saying is
13:35 - i have figured out how i can embed this
13:37 - markdown file
13:38 - into brightspace so the students can
13:42 - the reason why i mention this is i would
13:43 - love for any of you who are out there
13:45 - to follow along with this material feel
13:47 - free to complete the assignments
13:48 - yourself
13:49 - i'm going to show you where you can
13:50 - share them on the coding train website
13:52 - um i'm going to show you a bunch that
13:54 - some people have
13:54 - unknowingly done i mean they know that
13:56 - they did them maybe
13:57 - they don't know that they did them as
13:59 - part of like this course
14:01 - and um
14:04 - i would like and i would love your
14:06 - contributions so for example
14:08 - something that's really missing here on
14:11 - my notes
14:11 - are uh additional supplemental readings
14:16 - and material
14:17 - that might not be authored by me um in
14:20 - particular
14:21 - um you know i tend to uh most of the
14:25 - resources that i've researched and
14:26 - created with nature of code
14:28 - come from a kind of western american
14:31 - white male perspective and you know i
14:34 - try to be mindful of sharing um diverse
14:36 - artists especially
14:38 - uh black indigenous people of color and
14:40 - so if you have artists and references
14:43 - that you think would be relevant you
14:44 - know i don't want each one of these
14:46 - pages to be
14:47 - you know you know thousands of links
14:50 - long
14:51 - but i do want to curate and add and
14:54 - continue to update it
14:55 - so if you would like to continue the
14:57 - issues are open the pull rook
14:59 - continue if you'd like to contribute the
15:01 - issues are open the pull requests are
15:03 - open
15:04 - i encourage you you can see right now um
15:07 - there's nothing as of module 3.
15:09 - obviously the material for the modules
15:11 - exists on the internet and other places
15:13 - but i'm slowly putting them together you
15:14 - know i i'm not asking anyone to do my
15:16 - work for me but if you want to make a
15:18 - little fun project
15:19 - see if you could create one of these
15:21 - readme files for one of the later weeks
15:22 - based on
15:23 - all of the things that's in different
15:24 - places on the internet you could
15:25 - certainly do that and i would
15:27 - uh happily review it um this is my main
15:29 - focus right here
15:30 - so the updating the book is going along
15:33 - with this
15:34 - that's still on a little bit of hold i
15:35 - don't really have time to look at the
15:37 - book text
15:37 - too much but what's really happening
15:40 - live in motion going going going going
15:43 - going
15:45 - is the new videos so while i know it's
15:48 - disappointing to some folks
15:49 - that these coding challenges are few and
15:52 - far between
15:53 - i will i'm excited to say that there's a
15:54 - couple that have been recorded that will
15:56 - come out
15:57 - as part of coding challenges um my focus
16:00 - has been on
16:01 - um the nature of code uh playlist and
16:03 - what you'll see here
16:04 - is this most recently there are now four
16:08 - videos that go along with chapter three
16:10 - angles in motion
16:11 - angular motion angles and vectors polar
16:14 - coordinates i see that um
16:15 - kuntal in the chat is asking for these
16:18 - links so
16:19 - thank you for asking um kunta
16:23 - i am going to show you how i share links
16:25 - uh
16:28 - it's very hot and stig is actually a
16:30 - question about the platform for
16:32 - publishing the book so i'm happy to
16:34 - discuss that
16:35 - for a little bit i do have a tendency to
16:36 - like take up a half an hour when i start
16:38 - discussing that but let me see if i can
16:40 - return to that in one second so let me
16:41 - just offer some of these links
16:45 - um i'm gonna put them here in discord so
16:48 - remember this is in the live
16:50 - uh i can just zoom in on this in discord
16:52 - there is a category called live um i try
16:55 - to post updates to my schedule here and
16:56 - schedule
16:58 - um and links are where i'll post links
17:01 - of things i'm doing so here
17:02 - is that repo here is
17:06 - the nature of code book
17:11 - and one more link i want to make sure i
17:13 - share is
17:14 - this page that has all of the videos so
17:16 - far
17:17 - uh and then um i think let's see if this
17:19 - comes up
17:21 - yeah i can usually find it it's the the
17:23 - playlist on youtube
17:25 - uh is also the nature of code too and
17:27 - i've you ever
17:28 - some of you have watched my recent live
17:30 - streams know that i i feel a great
17:31 - amount of pain when i look at this page
17:34 - oh i just like my soul aches
17:37 - for the features that youtube
17:38 - implemented and took away oh
17:41 - i almost i mean i'm not gonna move off
17:43 - of youtube but boy
17:45 - [Music]
17:46 - certainly it's not helping me feel you
17:48 - know i have lots of mixed feelings about
17:50 - youtube as a platform
17:51 - there's the benefits for me right now
17:53 - outweigh the
17:54 - the the deficits um but
17:57 - the lack of the learning playlist uh
18:00 - structure that they had implemented is
18:01 - really it really makes me sad anybody
18:02 - from youtube is watching this
18:04 - thank you for listening to me and by the
18:07 - way everybody that i've worked with at
18:08 - youtube
18:08 - is absolutely lovely and has taken
18:11 - feedback graciously and works really
18:13 - hard so it's not a criticism these are
18:14 - big complicated
18:16 - software systems people are working on
18:18 - with a lot of different incentives so i
18:20 - don't mean that as a criticism i'm just
18:22 - i'm just sad a little bit sad i'm gonna
18:24 - read some random numbers that makes me
18:26 - happy
18:27 - what was i doing ah pasting this link in
18:29 - here all right so that's the link to
18:31 - that particular playlist
18:32 - i will tell you that chapter three um
18:36 - if we're looking at chapter three
18:37 - there's actually a 2.6 video that i made
18:40 - back in march like basically the day
18:42 - before uh
18:43 - well it wasn't you know there's no exact
18:46 - date to really pinpoint when the
18:47 - pandemic hit but at least it was kind of
18:48 - the day before everything shut down in
18:50 - new york city
18:51 - i mean i never got to releasing it it's
18:53 - also like
18:54 - it was kind of a mess that video so
18:56 - there's a 2.6 coming i think i should
18:58 - release it
18:59 - um and then uh 3. 3.5 6
19:02 - 7 and 8. there's four more videos for
19:04 - chapter three as well as two coding
19:06 - challenges
19:07 - so there's a lot coming it's all been
19:08 - recorded just putting it together
19:10 - waiting to publish it um
19:15 - all right i'm looking at the chat and
19:18 - juan says
19:19 - i got the physical nature of code book
19:21 - for my birthday last year and it was a
19:23 - great gift
19:24 - juan i'm so happy to hear that um i
19:26 - don't know
19:27 - if i could ever i mean it's
19:31 - far be it for me to assume that me
19:32 - signing anybody's book is something
19:34 - anybody actually wants
19:35 - but if i could ever meet you in person
19:38 - someday and you have your book with you
19:39 - i would be glad to write you a nice
19:40 - little note
19:41 - and hopefully i can remember and say i
19:42 - remember when you wrote about this on
19:44 - chat on the youtube
19:45 - live stream um okay
19:48 - so the first thing that i wanted to do
19:50 - today um
19:52 - is just look at some things that people
19:56 - um just remind you about the community
19:58 - contribution system that i have
20:00 - which by the way i have some i have some
20:02 - kind of secret plans
20:03 - nobody knows about this not even some of
20:06 - the people i really need to fill some
20:07 - people in
20:08 - um um there's been a the website the
20:10 - coding team website
20:11 - is a community driven project um and i
20:13 - have some plans for it
20:15 - so i'll be in touch with those of you
20:16 - who spend a lot of time helping to
20:17 - maintain the website
20:19 - um but what i wanted to remind you is
20:21 - right now for every single video
20:23 - and don't worry too much about am i
20:25 - posting this in the right place just
20:26 - share what you're making
20:28 - if you go to any particular video uh
20:30 - page
20:31 - first of all the code is there this is
20:32 - really important and uh sometimes
20:34 - there'll be more than one example with
20:36 - each video
20:36 - so you can see web editor um you can
20:39 - just you know if i'm looking at web
20:41 - editor and i just click
20:42 - right here on this one and then run the
20:44 - sketch this is a particular sketch that
20:46 - i demo
20:46 - demonstrate in the video and the code
20:47 - that goes along with it so i wanted to
20:49 - make sure everyone's aware of that
20:51 - um and then i also want to just
20:54 - highlight this community contribution
20:56 - section so if you
20:57 - make a sketch oh actually sorry if you
20:59 - make anything
21:00 - honestly it could be you made a sweater
21:03 - you drew
21:03 - you painted a picture i it doesn't have
21:06 - to be a code contribution
21:08 - a p5 if you if you um are
21:11 - uh putting something out there and you
21:13 - want to share it with me and the
21:14 - community this is the place to do it
21:17 - it's not the easiest thing to do
21:19 - uh requires a little bit of comfort with
21:22 - github
21:23 - a little bit of willingness to like put
21:24 - yourself out there
21:26 - we i hope that i and the rest of the
21:28 - folks who are helping to manage the repo
21:30 - are
21:30 - friendly and welcoming and inclusive so
21:33 - don't worry you can't do it wrong it's a
21:35 - learning opportunity for all of us to
21:36 - participate in these systems
21:38 - but um you can look at this guide
21:41 - uh for how to add your sketch i also
21:43 - have a little video that i think is
21:45 - still up to date
21:46 - and some information about how to do it
21:48 - um and then let me go and find one where
21:49 - there's one actually there
21:50 - so for example here we go uh lemur
21:53 - daniel
21:54 - great name daniel wow what an excellent
21:57 - name you've got there
22:02 - this coffee is very hot i've burnt my
22:03 - tongue on it at least three times while
22:05 - streaming
22:06 - and i'm now trying to drink it very
22:08 - slowly talk amongst yourself
22:14 - delicious so sometimes i will pick a
22:17 - contribution across
22:18 - everything and show it but i thought i
22:20 - wanted to really kind of want to like
22:21 - highlight these videos to make sure
22:22 - people are aware they exist and
22:24 - getting your feedback and that sort of
22:26 - stuff so let me click here
22:28 - on uh fortune wheels and let's take a
22:31 - look at
22:32 - oh cool so this is definitely based on
22:35 - one of the examples i remember
22:36 - referring to and making where you kind
22:38 - of have this wheel and i by the way this
22:40 - comes from my example it's a very
22:42 - awkward
22:44 - um kind of like dragon release
22:46 - interaction code
22:48 - there's probably a much more elegant
22:49 - thoughtful way of maybe doing a running
22:51 - average over time of how you're moving
22:52 - the arrow so that when you release
22:54 - i think i'm just taking like the last
22:57 - two frames
22:58 - of the p of the draw loop and looking at
23:00 - where the arrow is and then seeing how
23:02 - far apart they are and kind of
23:03 - applying that as a force but you can see
23:05 - this is called wheels 4
23:07 - sector count 10 audio off so oh
23:10 - oh my goodness this is wild sector count
23:14 - oh whoa i had no idea i looked at this
23:17 - earlier
23:20 - audio
23:22 - can you hear the audio
23:25 - i think you can that's pretty cool great
23:27 - work uh
23:28 - daniel an excellent name by the way
23:32 - i just want to make it clear you're
23:35 - quite allowed
23:36 - to publish a community contribution to
23:38 - the website even if your name isn't
23:40 - daniel
23:41 - just putting that out there
23:44 - uh okay um so now let's see if we have
23:47 - any more i think they might all be from
23:49 - lemur daniel
23:50 - uh angular motion none yet you could be
23:53 - the first
23:54 - um angles and vectors oh
23:58 - we've got two from
24:01 - lemur daniel thank you lemur daniel
24:05 - let's take a look at these quickly
24:06 - asteroid game vector thrust
24:09 - um whoa cool um
24:12 - ah oh this is fun
24:17 - so this is like so one of the things the
24:18 - videos talks about is how to
24:21 - use of the angle of a vector to apply
24:24 - a velocity or a force as well as how to
24:27 - um
24:27 - have an object you're drawing like this
24:29 - ship here point in the direction of
24:32 - motion
24:32 - so those are some of the things i'm
24:33 - covering in the videos
24:36 - cursor control oh that's cool oh wait a
24:38 - second this is like a steering behavior
24:41 - like basically i can oh my god i don't
24:44 - know why i've never thought
24:46 - of this is this a thing that other
24:47 - asteroid games do
24:49 - like i'm able to like apply the force
24:52 - um by just using the mouse cursor is it
24:54 - like stronger the further away i go
24:57 - oops kind of looks like it is
25:00 - like if i'm really close yeah it is it's
25:02 - proportional
25:03 - that's well great work ah this is a
25:05 - great train whistle for this one
25:08 - all right this is great very impressed
25:11 - um
25:11 - now um let me look at um
25:15 - vec was that what i was looking at
25:16 - vector thrust or asteroid game i think
25:17 - was looking at asteroid game
25:19 - oh this is just oh cool so one of the
25:21 - things i love about this is also like
25:23 - showing the vectors so you know i could
25:25 - do a better job of this um
25:28 - oh thank you abe is sharing something
25:29 - with me um which i will
25:32 - uh pull up in a second um
25:35 - so one of the things that i could do a
25:36 - better job of is having some of the
25:38 - examples be
25:40 - self-documenting or self-illustrative
25:42 - that's a way to say it
25:43 - like by including drawing the vectors
25:45 - that are part of
25:46 - how it works can really help people
25:48 - understand and see
25:49 - um i so the red vector is the current
25:52 - velocity i would assume
25:54 - and the uh white vector is the force
25:57 - that's being applied
25:58 - thrust instant progressive i don't even
26:00 - oh that's
26:01 - interesting friction on off testing oh
26:06 - this is wild look at this that is so
26:09 - cool
26:10 - i mean it's not just annotating a system
26:13 - and diagramming out what all the pieces
26:15 - are and
26:16 - notating the angles and the lengths this
26:18 - is this is
26:19 - really cool to see thank you for this so
26:21 - i hope you all check that check out
26:22 - these projects and hopefully
26:25 - if you're like trying to figure out how
26:26 - to make something like this yourself the
26:28 - video tutorial will help you
26:30 - let's see what else do i got 3.4 i just
26:32 - published this morning
26:33 - so i don't think there are any community
26:35 - contributions
26:37 - but i will point out to you that if
26:40 - you've
26:40 - ever wondered how to kind of do things
26:43 - like this
26:44 - like think about the asteroids game this
26:46 - is actually
26:47 - drawing a circle using polar coordinates
26:50 - and then
26:51 - moving every point along that surf i'm
26:53 - offsetting all the points along the
26:55 - perimeter of a
26:56 - circle randomly closer or further to the
26:59 - center and then
27:00 - putting it together as a polygon so um
27:03 - lots of fun stuff here that you're
27:04 - welcome to do so actually one of the
27:06 - things that i was
27:07 - this is a little bit backwards but the
27:09 - kind of first thing that i want to do
27:10 - today
27:11 - um is for and let's see if i can find it
27:16 - so um in the coding train sketches if
27:19 - you ever want to like figure out what's
27:21 - coming up in future videos
27:23 - you could probably just go to the coding
27:25 - train sketches
27:26 - because you can see all of these things
27:28 - like i'm working on a self-avoiding walk
27:30 - i actually recorded
27:31 - a video but it was uh i i think i have
27:34 - to throw away the footage unfortunately
27:36 - it should have like a second channel
27:37 - with like all just
27:39 - rough blooper cuts of everything by the
27:41 - way though if you want to join
27:42 - coding training as a member um some of
27:44 - my recording sessions i broadcast to
27:46 - have people
27:47 - tuning in to give feedback and that's
27:48 - one of the benefits of joining as a
27:50 - member which is somewhere
27:51 - a button somewhere on your youtube page
27:53 - um
27:55 - so but ah soft pendulum spring
27:58 - i'm looking for recently
28:03 - i recorded a video tutorial about a
28:05 - pendulum january 20th
28:07 - 2021 this seems right which is this
28:11 - ah and so one of the examples in the
28:15 - video
28:16 - um that i mentioned oh oh oh i meant to
28:20 - share abe's sketch as well but let me
28:22 - finish this thought
28:23 - um one of the um example one of the
28:27 - prompts that i mentioned in the video is
28:30 - what if you had an array of these
28:31 - pendulums kind of like all swinging
28:33 - together
28:34 - and so often what i'm doing now with
28:35 - these videos is when i talk through an
28:37 - example and then give an assignment
28:39 - prompt
28:39 - i'll kind of like show the results of
28:41 - that assignment and then link to the
28:43 - example and so i thought like it's a
28:44 - good thing for me to actually like code
28:46 - some of these up during
28:47 - often i just do it like i have i have 15
28:49 - minutes here i need to create this extra
28:50 - example for the video
28:51 - but i would like to do a lot of these
28:53 - during the live streams so that's kind
28:54 - of like a little extra
28:55 - coding challenge today bonus um where
28:58 - i'm going to
28:59 - attempt to make a version of this with
29:02 - like
29:02 - more pencil it's a little bit backwards
29:04 - because i haven't even released the
29:05 - video that explains this code yet
29:07 - so i don't know you may make a mental
29:11 - note go back and watch that video when
29:12 - it comes out come back and watch this
29:13 - later who knows
29:14 - just enjoy this right now go and do
29:16 - something else right now i have no idea
29:18 - but that's what i'm going to work on
29:22 - while i'm getting set up um let me see
29:26 - if i can find
29:27 - um abe's sketch i'm always hesitant to
29:31 - open up
29:32 - uh discord channels without uh
29:35 - permission
29:37 - um and i'm gonna open this one up oh my
29:39 - goodness oh right this is the stuff that
29:41 - abe
29:41 - and simon are working on together also i
29:44 - believe
29:45 - so you'll have to tell me um
29:48 - the sketch that i'm about to show
29:50 - whether this was one of your
29:51 - collaborations or not but this is really
29:53 - fun so i'm excited to show this to you
29:54 - here it comes
29:55 - all right this deserves a nice little uh
29:57 - uh snare drum
29:59 - ready everybody we're gonna see some
30:02 - exciting
30:02 - spinny springy thingy my bobbers
30:06 - cool so this is a by the way i it's not
30:09 - a big deal and uh i like to look at the
30:11 - sketches um
30:12 - at the the with the full view
30:15 - because it keeps um the most chaotic
30:18 - thing ever
30:19 - it keeps the link to the code and uh
30:21 - noting that it's part of p5 here on the
30:22 - top but look at this
30:23 - so this is coming i have a video about
30:25 - um doing like these
30:27 - springy things so this is actually an
30:29 - example from one of the videos
30:31 - i believe yeah this is the just this
30:34 - like soft stringy thing is
30:36 - the coding challenge that i do pretty
30:38 - debris recently and then
30:40 - um angles and rotation and more springy
30:42 - stuff
30:44 - cool i'm going to just put on a little
30:45 - music thank you for this abe
30:47 - great job and
30:50 - um i am just gonna put on a little music
30:54 - for a second while i get myself
30:55 - set up
31:05 - [Music]
31:16 - do
31:22 - [Music]
31:31 - [Music]
31:36 - so i i i'm looking for i need i need a
31:39 - pendulum class for what i want to do
31:41 - i'm noticing like there's some things
31:43 - that i want to update with this example
31:45 - but
31:46 - [Music]
31:48 - um i will do that right now so let me
31:50 - save this
31:52 - and we're going to call this video the
31:54 - pendulum video is going to be coding
31:55 - challenge
31:58 - 159 coding challenge
32:02 - 159 pendulum um exercise
32:07 - so and i think i can turn the music down
32:09 - so the first thing i want to do is i
32:10 - just want to kind of look at this for a
32:11 - second
32:12 - to figure out if i want to adjust
32:14 - anything
32:16 - um before i start to make multiple
32:18 - pendulums
32:19 - um and we can see this is uh the result
32:22 - of this code and i can see a couple
32:23 - things i want to do
32:25 - um this always bugs me i prefer to
32:29 - create an
32:29 - object with an x y rather than make a
32:32 - copy of a vector
32:34 - um so that i'm going to do
32:38 - angular velocity angular acceleration
32:39 - this is all fine
32:41 - let me just look here and say sketch
32:45 - um i think i can take out some of these
32:48 - comments just to like simplify
32:50 - this is i'm going to use some es6 magic
32:55 - p dot go that always has bothered me so
32:58 - first of all
32:58 - i also don't like i mean i can use a
33:02 - slightly shorter word like pendulum
33:05 - um and i also i used to make my examples
33:09 - and maybe i don't know why
33:10 - where um in this go function
33:13 - i call update and display so it's like
33:15 - one function to do all the steps
33:18 - but i've recently i prefer not to do
33:21 - that in my examples
33:22 - and i have found that i prefer to just
33:26 - actually explicitly call update and
33:28 - explicitly call
33:30 - uh display and i i've been calling those
33:32 - functions show also because i think
33:34 - display
33:35 - is a render is another good word but
33:37 - display i think is a key word in some
33:39 - parts of javascript um so let's make
33:42 - sure this still works
33:43 - what if i break oh i broke something
33:47 - no error it completely broke oh
33:50 - okay i remember uh so now i want this to
33:53 - be at
33:54 - uh width divided by two um and
33:57 - uh zero that's where the pendulum
34:00 - is there we go okay
34:04 - so in theory what i'm looking to do so
34:07 - actually the prompt that i give
34:10 - in the um so
34:13 - wasim akram let me answer this question
34:15 - asks
34:16 - will this go and abe says by the way
34:18 - that was a collaboration
34:20 - um with simon so one of the things that
34:23 - i have the capability to do is um
34:24 - in the members discord channel uh the
34:26 - messages there i can bring up on the
34:28 - screen so this is from abe
34:29 - who i mentioned that this was a
34:31 - collaboration with simon okay
34:32 - um so wasseem's question is a really
34:35 - good one
34:36 - will this coding challenge uh will this
34:39 - coding challenge be available as a
34:40 - separate video in the future
34:42 - so i don't i always it always
34:46 - bugged me how i had live streams
34:49 - that then got like edited and repurposed
34:52 - as separate videos
34:53 - and then during my live streams i
34:55 - started really thinking about the
34:57 - editing
34:57 - and i would stop and start and i just i
35:00 - don't know it felt something about it
35:02 - didn't feel
35:02 - like the way i wanted to do things
35:06 - and so i right now i've completely
35:09 - separated these things now that
35:10 - experience is still available because
35:12 - when i record a video that i know is
35:15 - going to be edited
35:16 - um um that those those are streamed for
35:19 - members so people can join and kind of
35:21 - like tune in but there's a lot of
35:22 - stopping and starting and me just like
35:23 - thinking and then i
35:24 - like to go for a walk and take a break
35:26 - and come back so
35:28 - um whereas the live streams now are just
35:30 - live streams
35:32 - they are what they are they have a start
35:34 - a middle and end they're a mess they're
35:35 - great they're terrible who knows
35:37 - uh they're archived in theory i would
35:39 - like to time code them and have good
35:41 - solid descriptions and
35:43 - eyes and all that kind of stuff so this
35:45 - will always be available
35:46 - but i'm no longer editing out stuff now
35:49 - i
35:49 - maybe i should go back to that other way
35:51 - i don't know so at least for right now
35:53 - that's what i'm trying
35:54 - um but uh to answer your what you might
35:56 - have been asking is
35:58 - the how to code a single pendulum i
36:00 - recorded a coding challenge of that
36:03 - which is currently being edited and
36:04 - hopefully will come out soon
36:07 - and it can't come out until i finish
36:08 - this piece of it that i want to include
36:11 - at the end
36:12 - so maybe i'll include a clip of me
36:14 - coding it or something so that people
36:16 - can understand how these things tie
36:18 - together
36:18 - but there you go um all right
36:22 - cube video people are saying they like
36:24 - the cube video i gotta return to that
36:28 - rubik's cube stuff
36:32 - i always do keep a ruby's cube nearby
36:36 - when all else fails i either can try to
36:39 - solve it or
36:40 - um read random numbers i wonder if
36:43 - there's
36:43 - there must be some uh rubik's cube
36:44 - documentaries on curiosity stream by the
36:46 - way
36:47 - i bet i should take a look for that um
36:49 - all right
36:50 - now so what i was saying is the prompt
36:54 - is actually
36:55 - to um if i can just zoom in here for a
36:57 - second is to
36:58 - fill uh pendulums across the top and
37:01 - across the sides and the bottom
37:03 - so let me um
37:06 - let me see if um
37:14 - let me see if i can just start with the
37:15 - top and and steinov is saying would be
37:18 - cool if you edit recording of live
37:19 - stream have some transition between
37:21 - clips yeah that's what i used to do but
37:24 - i also would love
37:25 - to have like highlight videos blooper
37:28 - videos but
37:29 - uh right now there's enough work for i
37:32 - mean
37:32 - the main video editor that i work with
37:34 - is matia um
37:36 - who um i i would be open to like
37:39 - having more content i don't know
37:42 - when i start my tick tock i'll make 60
37:44 - second little clips for my videos to
37:46 - post on tik tok
37:47 - never gonna happen might happen next
37:49 - year i have a
37:50 - uh i have some plans for next year we'll
37:52 - see if they come into fruition
37:54 - all right let's just start with um
37:56 - making this an array
37:58 - just i'm gonna start this way uh and
38:00 - then
38:01 - oh well first of all so actually before
38:04 - i do that
38:05 - i just want to save this as exercise oop
38:09 - so i think um one of the exercise
38:12 - prompts is also just to make
38:13 - in the coding challenge i don't make it
38:15 - object oriented
38:16 - um so
38:19 - now um i want to duplicate it and say
38:23 - pendulum exercise
38:25 - um i'm going to say array
38:29 - by the way there's this wonderful video
38:30 - on youtube
38:32 - that i used to refer to which has like
38:35 - physical pendulums and somebody like
38:37 - using
38:37 - a board to like line them all up
38:39 - twisting the board and letting it go so
38:41 - they're all slightly offset from each
38:42 - other
38:42 - and it's quite beautiful um
38:46 - is my chat not scrolling here totally
38:48 - it's not scrolling there we go i fixed
38:49 - that
38:50 - okay um so let's see here
38:54 - i don't want to sit in front of the code
38:55 - so move this over a little bit
38:58 - let's change this to an array
39:02 - um and let's make let's let's let's make
39:04 - a variable called spacing
39:06 - how much am i going to space them out
39:07 - let me space them out by
39:09 - 20 pixels and then
39:12 - um i need to
39:15 - what happening to my mouth uh i need to
39:19 - say
39:19 - uh the total number of pendulums is
39:23 - the width of the canvas divided by the
39:24 - spacing
39:26 - and sometimes i want i might want to
39:27 - have one at the beginning and the end
39:29 - so this could actually be plus one and i
39:32 - should make sure that's an integer value
39:33 - plus one
39:34 - then i'm gonna say let i equal zero i is
39:36 - less than total i plus
39:37 - plus and then
39:40 - pendulums index i and then i need a
39:44 - separate
39:44 - x position for each one um
39:47 - and that x position should be i
39:50 - times the spacing and then i should just
39:54 - hear i can say
39:55 - four i'm sitting in an awkward way today
39:58 - let
39:58 - every pendulum of the pendulums
40:02 - uh update and show let's see what
40:05 - happens here
40:07 - there we go so this is what i was
40:08 - looking to do but i need to i want to
40:11 - make this
40:11 - more interesting uh visually
40:15 - visually uh dynamic so there's a few
40:18 - things
40:18 - one important thing here is i feel like
40:21 - whatever i do
40:22 - i want i mean color is maybe something i
40:25 - want to think about here
40:26 - but right now i'm just going to at a
40:28 - minimum give the pendulums alpha
40:30 - so that um and of course now
40:34 - you're probably thinking about a
40:35 - newton's cradle and having to bang into
40:36 - each other
40:37 - that's another that's another project
40:39 - for another time not what i'm doing
40:40 - today
40:41 - uh i think so it's bugging me how much
40:44 - little space i have
40:46 - um let's go to
40:50 - um let's let's space them out a bit more
40:53 - and also have them be
40:54 - not as tall um i think i should make
40:57 - this a square for what i'm trying to do
40:59 - so let's make it 600 by 600
41:03 - okay so this is more along the lines of
41:05 - what i was expecting to see
41:07 - and want to see um
41:12 - i guess i i this happened by accident
41:15 - but
41:15 - the size of the pendulums must be 50.
41:18 - that's what i'm spreading
41:19 - spreading them out by r equals r so
41:22 - i should probably where do i create
41:24 - those pendulums
41:26 - it might make sense oh there are a
41:27 - hundred what if i say spacing here
41:31 - oh that's no that's the length that's
41:33 - not the size of the
41:36 - where is the size of oh ball radius is
41:38 - 48 it's arbitrary
41:40 - um it's actually called a bob
41:44 - let's call it bob r um
41:49 - let's um put that in there because i
41:51 - think i would like that to be
41:53 - rel something relative to the spacing
41:55 - right now
41:57 - great okay
42:00 - wonderful all right now i'm just curious
42:02 - here what is the first thing i should
42:04 - try in terms of having them
42:08 - should i give them all a slightly
42:09 - different phase
42:12 - should i give them all a slightly
42:15 - different like what's the best way to
42:17 - make this slightly more dynamic
42:20 - um so what are what are some of the
42:24 - the angle that they start on
42:28 - is pi divided by four
42:32 - so what if i were to give them a
42:35 - starting and yes thank you
42:37 - uh harvard natural sciences lecture
42:40 - demonstrations
42:41 - thank you let's see if i google it
42:42 - harvard natural sciences
42:45 - lecture demonstrations pendulum
42:49 - this is 100 um the video that i was
42:52 - looking for let's just watch this for a
42:54 - second
42:55 - oh they're different the heights are the
42:58 - lengths are different
43:01 - does this have sound can't tell
43:05 - if it has sound i don't hear it
43:12 - now i hear it
43:19 - of course now now this leads me to want
43:21 - to do this
43:22 - with a uh the pendulums all yeah okay
43:26 - oh boy oh i really want to make this
43:31 - uh
43:38 - wow that's that's cool so now now i'm
43:42 - sort of tempted to rethink the problem
43:43 - is my exercise prompt
43:45 - i probably shouldn't make the thing that
43:46 - i actually say in the video but i also
43:48 - kind of want to make this
43:49 - uh uh later on so let's let me go
43:52 - forward with what i was doing
43:54 - but i'm realizing here that actually
43:57 - something that
43:58 - might be interesting to try is actually
44:01 - just have
44:02 - their length be
44:05 - uh different so here i could say i
44:08 - times like you know 10 plus i
44:12 - times 10. like what would that do
44:17 - yeah that's basically
44:21 - i mean it's not maybe i should say
44:24 - you know 50 plus i times 20 just to like
44:28 - make it a bit i don't have the auto
44:30 - refresh on
44:36 - and is what i really want to see like
44:38 - many more of these
44:41 - and the damping is a bit of a problem
44:43 - right now because they're all coming to
44:44 - a stop
44:46 - so what if i if i just take that out
44:49 - completely
44:58 - that's pretty cool
45:14 - circular gradient on each circle to make
45:16 - them so steinov is having some great
45:18 - ideas in the chat about adding a
45:20 - gradient
45:21 - um so this is what i'm really hoping
45:25 - other people will do i'm going to leave
45:27 - this fair
45:28 - i might add some color to it just to
45:29 - make it pop a little bit more when it
45:31 - appears as an example but
45:32 - i think thinking about gradients and
45:34 - trails and how to visualize this
45:36 - um yeah put them in the same position
45:39 - that's exactly what i should do
45:40 - um distribute them vertically yeah
45:44 - so this was like a big this is
45:46 - interesting but obviously
45:48 - i'm totally now realizing that the way
45:51 - to make this
45:52 - more interesting is would be
45:55 - not more interesting but another way to
45:57 - think about this would be to have them
45:58 - all
45:59 - just right on top of each other
46:07 - and it's much more about this vertical
46:09 - spacing
46:12 - so um
46:16 - the vertical spacing is
46:20 - uh so i times spacing and the total is
46:23 - the height
46:24 - divided by spacing i don't need the plus
46:26 - one
46:29 - and i might say spacing plus
46:32 - i times spacing let's see if i get this
46:44 - if i remove the circles and flip them
46:46 - upside down
46:47 - i have a laser show i think i need
46:51 - some damping here i should just have it
46:54 - be incredibly subtle
46:56 - so like if i go back to this
47:07 - i think also this will make this much
47:10 - more interesting if the spacing is much
47:12 - less
47:19 - and uh
47:23 - i mean let's go all out with this people
47:26 - uh
47:27 - uh window with
47:30 - window height so whatever i do
47:35 - oh and then this needs to be
47:38 - width divided by two
47:46 - well this is a cool result
47:51 - i'm not sure what i expected um
47:54 - but i'm pretty happy with it i actually
47:56 - think i might want the damping to be
47:58 - even more now it's so
48:00 - exact it was kind of looking i like this
48:03 - idea by the way of
48:04 - thinking about like how i'm drawing this
48:07 - there's not really any reason
48:08 - necessarily to draw the circle
48:22 - um and um just to like add some color to
48:25 - it
48:26 - i'm very color i i always have trouble
48:29 - picking colors but i have this like
48:31 - coating train color palette so let's try
48:34 - adding some of those um
48:38 - i might have to record something to
48:39 - break into the video
48:43 - we can try doing that today and see if
48:44 - how that works um
48:46 - what was i trying to i'm in the wrong
48:48 - sketch um
48:49 - let's go here to the sketch let's set
48:51 - this to be the background
48:53 - but i'm going to give the background
48:54 - some alpha
48:56 - and then let's have the lines be should
48:59 - we try this like
49:00 - like like blue or this pink maybe
49:04 - um so let's go look at the pendulum
49:07 - lines and have them
49:10 - be this and let's just make the stroke
49:13 - weight one
49:18 - and now the question i think also
49:20 - becomes
49:21 - like what's the starting angle that i
49:23 - want like what happens if
49:26 - and maybe these colors are too similar
49:27 - here i don't know how well this comes
49:29 - through
49:30 - over the over youtube but um
49:33 - what if i by the way this is totally
49:36 - like a cozy coding live stream now
49:39 - if you don't know about aaron davey on
49:40 - twitch if you like what i'm doing here i
49:42 - feel like aaron davey does this all the
49:44 - time on twitch
49:44 - just sort of tries out weird stuff um
49:47 - what if i make the starting angle
49:50 - 90 degrees
49:56 - yeah and then i feel like this damping
49:59 - should actually be
50:00 - a bit more
50:04 - that's too much i think because you can
50:06 - see it's
50:07 - it's almost like a cloth or something
50:11 - let's give it another nine
50:22 - by the way it's crazy to think that i
50:25 - just started from this
50:28 - like this is the example and just with
50:31 - like adding an array basically
50:34 - i now have this what if you kept the
50:37 - circles and didn't draw the lines i do
50:39 - like this idea
50:40 - let's try that
50:44 - um okay keep the circles take out the
50:48 - lines
50:49 - let's give the circles also the same
50:53 - fil the same
50:56 - fill
51:01 - that is pretty crazy
51:14 - also like now i'm sort of thinking well
51:17 - i think maybe i want some i want like a
51:19 - little bit of a higher contrast in the
51:21 - color just to be able to sort of
51:22 - visually see what's going on
51:25 - so let's go back to the pendulum
51:30 - and use a different color
51:34 - there's also no reason why i couldn't
51:36 - make
51:38 - this uh like bigger
51:42 - just curious um and
51:45 - also um have the background alpha be a
51:51 - bit more extreme
52:08 - it kind of has like a sonar ultrasound
52:12 - like
52:12 - quality to it for sure like a tree
52:17 - also has a tree like it's quality to it
52:23 - it also really feels like the circles
52:27 - are traveling
52:29 - like oh they're traveling down or
52:31 - traveling up but they're not
52:33 - they're individual ones going but it's a
52:35 - total illusion
52:37 - [Music]
52:41 - total illusion i'm sure
52:45 - those of you watching with a flair for
52:47 - design
52:49 - could think about all different ways to
52:51 - apply
52:52 - color and blending um
52:56 - to this flip it upside
53:00 - down and you get the wi-fi symbol
53:03 - i am interested to see like what happens
53:05 - when i flip this upside down
53:07 - um i guess that would be
53:11 - just a matter of maybe i
53:14 - should is gravity a variable somewhere
53:17 - here yeah
53:18 - so i'm going to take this out and make
53:20 - gravity a global variable
53:22 - this is an arbitrary constant by the way
53:24 - that really affects
53:25 - the behavior quite a bit like we could
53:27 - see like if i make this much high twice
53:29 - as high
53:31 - or
53:32 - [Music]
53:35 - if i make this very low
53:38 - wait i'm not noticing a difference
53:41 - i feel like this value should be playing
53:44 - a more significant role
53:47 - um yeah it is negative one times gravity
53:56 - that's weird did i do did i not hit like
53:59 - running oh yeah okay
54:00 - i must not have restarted so this is
54:01 - with a very very low gravity
54:04 - which is actually quite cool
54:12 - um it's more it's it's like oozy
54:15 - oozy wavy um
54:19 - well i really went off a little tangent
54:21 - here oh but what i was trying to do
54:23 - and let's go back to the sketch is
54:27 - if i do this and
54:30 - i make the gravity in the other
54:32 - direction
54:34 - well they're all falling up so now
54:38 - i just need to put their origin at the
54:40 - bottom
54:44 - so this is uh upside down
54:57 - amber says these would make a great
54:59 - screensaver
55:00 - yeah that's my i'm happy with that
55:04 - all right i think i just should stop i
55:05 - have other things that i wanted to do
55:07 - today i've already forgotten
55:08 - what was on my list
55:11 - um and i i should take oh kim
55:17 - perfect timing kim
55:20 - welcome to coding training membership
55:23 - with your membership you will get
55:27 - your very own
55:29 - [Music]
55:31 - random pop random number
55:35 - [Applause]
55:39 - and here we go we're on page 247 of
55:44 - the million random digits book we're in
55:47 - row
55:48 - 12 330 and we are in column
55:51 - 51 and the random number is 51
55:54 - 525 thank you for joining
56:00 - so kim make sure that you uh link your
56:03 - discord and youtube accounts and you'll
56:05 - have access
56:05 - to some of the coding train member stuff
56:07 - in the discord
56:09 - um all right now what if you have four
56:11 - of these pointing in different
56:13 - directions from the center
56:15 - yeah i have to stop like the point of
56:18 - this here let me just save this
56:21 - and please go and make the stuff now and
56:23 - all of these can go
56:24 - on the coding challenge page when i
56:27 - publish it
56:27 - all your contributions so i'm gonna go
56:29 - i'm gonna just move back to here for a
56:31 - second because i don't know what i'm
56:32 - gonna open here in discord
56:33 - uh links um this is i am now posting um
56:37 - the code to discord so go go have fun
56:40 - play with this make something beautiful
56:42 - you know i love it especially when you
56:44 - um share it with me on twitter
56:46 - um there is a coding train uh
56:48 - codingtrain instagram that you can also
56:49 - tag
56:50 - um that's managed by psy um who's done a
56:53 - wonderful job
56:54 - kind of um building the community there
57:00 - so ah so this is perfect timing because
57:02 - it's two o'clock
57:05 - and i could take a break so one of the
57:06 - other things that i wanted to do today
57:07 - which uh you know
57:08 - admittedly may not be as exciting as
57:11 - this
57:12 - and just to just to like really
57:15 - um finish this off here
57:19 - let's make gravity 2.5 just curious if i
57:22 - go
57:23 - here to full and do this
57:27 - what we get wow um
57:31 - um what um
57:36 - um what i would like to do when i come
57:38 - back for my break
57:40 - is work on i have a bunch of sort of
57:43 - ongoing projects
57:45 - and i probably should uh i leave i have
57:48 - a bad habit of leaving things unfinished
57:50 - so i probably should go back to some of
57:51 - these other ones
57:52 - but i wanted to build a system where um
57:56 - we could have the discord bot keep track
57:58 - of people's random numbers
58:00 - because i am working on this is not one
58:02 - of them but these custom train whistles
58:04 - uh with a pattern that's generated from
58:06 - the that it's your random number
58:08 - so i'll come back and explain all of
58:09 - that first i am going to just take a
58:12 - moment
58:13 - um this will just take a few minutes to
58:15 - thank today's
58:16 - sponsor and i'm gonna play you a 30
58:19 - second video from
58:20 - today's sponsor which uh is curiosity
58:23 - stream and hopefully if the sound is not
58:25 - on during this video
58:26 - please let me know in the chat so but
58:28 - i'm pretty sure it works
58:31 - from the founder of discovery channel
58:34 - comes a new
58:35 - independent streaming service curiosity
58:38 - stream
58:41 - home of groundbreaking documentaries
58:45 - and award-winning original series
58:52 - follow your curiosity
58:57 - this is curiosity stream
59:05 - i'm back so um as you might have heard
59:08 - me talk about before i'm part of a group
59:10 - of educational creators
59:11 - that teamed up to build a platform where
59:13 - creators don't have to worry about
59:15 - demonetization
59:16 - or the youtube algorithm and it's called
59:17 - nebula and nebula i'm really excited to
59:20 - mention is partnering with curiosity
59:22 - stream
59:23 - so nebula here i have up here um
59:26 - here has a lot of wonderful um channels
59:29 - it's kind of like when i'm looking for
59:30 - something new to watch on youtube i'll
59:32 - often like
59:32 - sort of check out what's on nebula i
59:35 - think i could probably find coding
59:37 - trains somewhere on here
59:38 - um but there are one of the things
59:41 - there's a lot of fun stuff original
59:43 - content that's only available on nebula
59:45 - for example tom scott's money but you
59:47 - might be asking yourself like
59:49 - what does this have to do with curiosity
59:51 - stream so curiosity stream loves
59:53 - educational creators and supporting more
59:55 - educational content so nebula
59:57 - and the creators that involved that
59:58 - project worked out a deal so if you sign
60:00 - up for curiosity stream with that link
60:02 - not only do you get curiosity stream but
60:05 - you get nebula for free so it's a bundle
60:08 - um it's not a trial you're going to have
60:10 - nebula for free
60:12 - for as long as you are a curiosity
60:14 - stream member so and for a limited time
60:16 - curiosity stream is offering 26 off
60:19 - um its annual plan so that's less than
60:22 - 15
60:23 - a year for both a year by the way i'm
60:25 - not saying 50 a month
60:26 - a year the entire year for both
60:29 - curiosity stream
60:30 - um and nebula so here i can just open up
60:33 - the curiosity stream website
60:35 - there are thousands of documentaries um
60:37 - oop i've got another member or something
60:39 - joining my lights are blinking
60:41 - um and uh oh look i'm gonna let's click
60:44 - on the sneak peek of the library you can
60:45 - see science history technology nature
60:47 - so i'm really partial to the nature one
60:49 - i was mentioning i was watching this
60:50 - moose
60:50 - documentary with my kids um and you know
60:53 - a lot of us
60:54 - are staying inside these days hopefully
60:55 - that's going to be changing more and
60:56 - more we can go into the real nature but
60:58 - you can watch some really amazing nature
61:00 - documentaries
61:01 - you might as well be soothed by daytona
61:03 - david atvero's voice
61:04 - watch chris hadfield um or just watch
61:07 - tom scott torture your favorite
61:09 - youtubers on
61:10 - nebula watch chris hasfield in this
61:12 - space station that is
61:13 - so click to the link above um to get
61:16 - both curiosity stream and nebula for 26
61:19 - off it's a great way to support the
61:20 - coding train and educational content as
61:22 - a whole
61:22 - for 14.79 per year um right that's 26
61:26 - off again that's for the entire year so
61:29 - if you're already a curiosity stream
61:31 - member i'd love to hear any
61:33 - recommendations of things that i should
61:34 - watch
61:35 - because i've really been enjoying um
61:36 - checking it out i think um dr
61:38 - hannah fry has a wonderful series about
61:40 - maths um on curiosity stream that i also
61:43 - i just like watched a little bit of and
61:44 - i'm excited to really um
61:46 - dive into that as well so um so yeah so
61:49 - i'm gonna take a short break
61:50 - um you know maybe you want to sign up
61:52 - right now i don't want to be so bold
61:54 - but i'll be back in about three or four
61:56 - minutes and i will continue with looking
61:58 - at some
61:58 - discord bot and database stuff

67:24 - all right i am back thank you again to
67:26 - curiositystream
67:28 - check out curiositystream.com
67:30 - codingtrain
67:32 - okay um so what's up next i've got about
67:36 - 45 minutes or so and i
67:39 - think the timing is really quite perfect
67:41 - because if i'm not mistaken we just had
67:44 - two new members join so
67:48 - welcome to um ronnie and
67:52 - joseph thank you so much for boarding
67:54 - the coding train
67:56 - where we make strange yellow upside down
68:00 - pendulum patterns
68:01 - yes and for your membership you will
68:04 - receive your
68:05 - very own random number
68:08 - so rather than give you um ronnie and
68:12 - joseph your random number right now
68:14 - why don't we over engineer an elaborate
68:16 - software system to keep track of a
68:17 - random number for you
68:19 - in a very unnecessary way so um
68:24 - what am i going to do here let's go to
68:26 - the youtubes
68:28 - and see um this youtube channel called
68:30 - the coding train
68:32 - and maybe under playlists am i logged in
68:36 - i'm subscribed who am i i don't even
68:38 - know anymore
68:39 - um i'm looking for i think i'm just
68:42 - gonna
68:43 - my discord bot tutorial series so this
68:46 - is the most recent one
68:48 - welcome back to so this is uh my most
68:50 - recent discord bot tutorial i
68:52 - do intend to make some follow-up
68:56 - um videos um that continues showing
68:59 - other aspects i know working showing
69:01 - embeds and maybe
69:02 - is that the way to say it an embed
69:04 - because i embed something
69:06 - i'm going to embed this onto the web
69:08 - page
69:09 - i'm going to embed this nugget into my
69:11 - mind
69:13 - but if there is a if it's a noun if it's
69:15 - a thing
69:16 - like that's posted in discord it's not
69:19 - an
69:20 - embed it's an embed i think
69:24 - this is really what's important yeah
69:28 - that's kind of genius i wish i could
69:29 - share that more broadly just post a nice
69:32 - little meme
69:33 - about how i just moved from one
69:36 - old side project onto a new one but this
69:39 - one's really important
69:40 - because it has to do with something that
69:44 - i'm on
69:44 - a mission to do and you'll have to
69:46 - indulge me for a second
69:48 - because i don't know how many of you are
69:49 - new today and i'm
69:51 - i'm looking for something that i would
69:53 - have shown like quite a while ago ah
69:55 - here it is
69:55 - perfect um
70:00 - so um what this is and let me zoom in
70:03 - is a uh test
70:06 - run of it's not this train whistle but
70:09 - it is a blank
70:10 - wooden toy train yes this is what i'm
70:13 - talking about people
70:14 - with the coding train uh train etched
70:18 - into it
70:18 - and then on the other side
70:22 - will is a random walk pattern
70:27 - um where and actually i just have a i
70:29 - have a new idea now for the random walk
70:31 - pattern which i just realized
70:33 - nuno thank you so much mwah um
70:37 - for signing up for uh curiosity stream
70:38 - that's nice of you um
70:41 - so um the idea here is that every
70:44 - coding i would like everyone in the
70:46 - world who wants one to be able to have
70:48 - one of these i always say because i
70:49 - don't like this idea of the sort of like
70:50 - exclusive thing
70:51 - but you know i've got to start somewhere
70:53 - so right now everyone who joins
70:55 - at the conductor's level and eventually
70:57 - hopefully the passengers level we'll see
70:59 - if i can get to that
71:00 - um will receive their own custom etched
71:04 - coated train train whistle with a random
71:06 - number
71:07 - pattern generated from their own
71:10 - custom random number got it
71:14 - so so far i have done one one aspect of
71:17 - this
71:18 - which is that if i go to github.com
71:21 - codingtrain
71:22 - and this needs a lot of work by the way
71:24 - so your contributions to this are
71:26 - welcome as well
71:28 - but i think here under the random
71:30 - whistle uh repository
71:33 - um and then if i click over here we'll
71:34 - see it this is
71:36 - a you know i don't know if we'll pull if
71:39 - i don't want to pull this from the
71:40 - database or not but we have a few
71:42 - few tests sort of people in here so if i
71:44 - go to rnav for example
71:46 - puts the rnob's random number there i'm
71:49 - going to uncheck the download
71:50 - click the generate button you know no
71:54 - elegant and
71:54 - now this is arnhem's uh
71:57 - custom random walk pattern based on that
72:00 - random number i don't know maybe this
72:02 - isn't
72:02 - and i'm still working on the maybe i
72:04 - could see that i didn't i don't remember
72:06 - all the details of how i've got at some
72:07 - point i've got to like finalize
72:09 - how it's generated um so they'll start
72:11 - the same place also
72:13 - i'm just using the built-in um
72:16 - the random number generator built into
72:18 - p5 which actually i think is fine i
72:20 - might want to like put the random number
72:21 - generator
72:22 - in the code itself so we can know
72:24 - exactly what it's using or
72:26 - why am i even doing this this is
72:28 - completely insane
72:29 - this is what it has to be a new side
72:32 - project
72:33 - so um i think violet shared with me
72:36 - a link to the uh pdf
72:39 - of this book but i should be using the
72:42 - sequence of random numbers in this book
72:44 - what am i even thinking so i need to
72:47 - first get
72:48 - um so i'll find that we'll redo that i'm
72:50 - not gonna do that right now that would
72:51 - be much more fun
72:53 - because i gotta get this discord thing
72:54 - started um
72:58 - um and so yeah and stig that's a great
73:00 - suggestion for stig actually stig if you
73:02 - have some design ideas
73:03 - i know that's your one of your passions
73:05 - i welcome them and sort of helping
73:07 - figure out how to make this um work i'm
73:10 - also working on
73:11 - um uh um a a video about
73:16 - a self-avoiding walk i think i mentioned
73:18 - that let me just pull that up and and
73:20 - run it
73:21 - so that's like this and conceivably i
73:24 - could actually we could do the
73:25 - self-avoiding walk as the random walk
73:28 - um which you know creates more
73:30 - distinctive geometry
73:32 - i think i can make this more obvious
73:35 - by going to sketch and making the step
73:39 - size like
73:40 - 10. so this is a self-avoiding walk
73:44 - and when it gets stuck it just
73:45 - backtracks to try to go a different
73:47 - direction
73:48 - in theory if i let this run for a very
73:51 - long time
73:52 - it would uh find a path that hits every
73:55 - point
73:55 - on the entire grid um but you know the
73:58 - amount it's doing a brute force
74:00 - algorithm so i got to make a video about
74:02 - this i love this uh
74:03 - kind of pattern this um i i
74:06 - yeah so this could also be a different
74:09 - option
74:10 - for if this sort of visually is not as
74:12 - compelling let's just try it like some
74:14 - of these other ones like hunter parks
74:16 - see what we get right i like this one so
74:19 - this is what i was sort of more
74:20 - imagining that's like a fractal like
74:22 - brownian motion quality to it but but i
74:25 - what i need to be able to track this
74:27 - i need a system by which i can keep
74:30 - track of who the members are um
74:33 - what their um random number is
74:37 - and um their random number and maybe the
74:39 - discord bot itself should actually be
74:41 - like rendering this
74:42 - i don't know who knows um okay
74:48 - um oh and thank you um
74:52 - prathamesh uh highlighted a question
74:54 - from the youtube chat
74:55 - who does the illustration work for the
74:57 - channel so um
74:58 - those animations that you saw the
75:00 - interstitial animations
75:01 - those were made as a one-time thing and
75:03 - i am blanking on
75:05 - the person who made them so i can look
75:08 - that up and i can share that at discord
75:10 - later
75:10 - but the the source material of that is
75:12 - all from jason heglund and just to plug
75:14 - jason stuff
75:15 - for a moment because he really does
75:17 - amazing work and he's working on
75:19 - um um this video of the
75:22 - the train whistle is uh from his shop um
75:25 - out and we can see we were trying
75:26 - different patterns
75:28 - um also as well to see what they look
75:30 - like
75:31 - um but jason heglund if you're
75:32 - interested in learning more about jason
75:35 - um and i think um
75:38 - you can find his website here the coding
75:40 - train stuff is all here
75:42 - coding train expansion it's like another
75:45 - project of all these characters
75:46 - and everything you can find um here with
75:49 - all sorts of ideas
75:50 - but the thing that i was going to
75:51 - highlight for you is jason also has his
75:54 - own
75:54 - shop this i'm called hi hello there
75:58 - co um which has lots of really fun cool
76:01 - little like if you like the coding trade
76:02 - stuff
76:03 - you can get all these like really fun
76:05 - similar style kind of
76:07 - um shirts and shops and things so um wow
76:10 - this is really
76:10 - i haven't looked at this recently it's
76:12 - really really nice so
76:14 - um jason's amazing fred the ghost
76:17 - actually one of the one of my dreams is
76:19 - to make a little coding children's book
76:21 - and i think jason would be a great
76:22 - collaborator for that so if anybody has
76:24 - any ideas or contacts or
76:26 - anything like that um let me know all
76:28 - right let's see when am i gonna have
76:29 - time for that i don't know
76:31 - all right so oh this has been way too
76:33 - long of an explanation
76:37 - let's get to doing the discord bot so
76:40 - let me go
76:41 - to and
76:44 - um let's go to coding train
76:48 - choo choo bot
76:52 - choo choo tweets no
76:55 - discord bot choo choo think this is the
76:58 - current
76:58 - note no because this doesn't have the
77:02 - command handler
77:04 - all right let's go it's weird
77:07 - i i should have prepared this in advance
77:11 - strange uh let's go to the coding train
77:14 - learning uh discord bot
77:18 - by the way uh and now i'm really all in
77:20 - that's why i have a a
77:21 - project in the pipeline about
77:23 - redesigning the coding train website
77:24 - with the loss of the learning playlist
77:26 - on youtube i've given up
77:27 - and i'm just gonna like really try to
77:29 - build a separate website that really
77:31 - helps organize all of the videos and
77:33 - content and code
77:34 - so coming soon um more to come about
77:37 - that
77:38 - but the website that exists right now is
77:39 - amazing and it's been developed and
77:41 - designed by a
77:42 - variety of people that you would
77:43 - probably see here in the chat right now
77:46 - um but i have some ideas for some
77:48 - upgrades all right so what i'm looking
77:50 - for if i go to command
77:51 - handling and we go to view code
77:55 - so this is the code um
77:59 - from that's this is the code that i
78:01 - thought i had this
78:04 - i'm totally confused let's also go to
78:06 - glitch
78:08 - and now as i spend the remaining 40
78:11 - minutes just finding the code that i was
78:12 - going to work with
78:13 - choo choo bot discord
78:18 - this is the actual bot
78:21 - oh i think i never updated it
78:25 - to use the new command handler
78:29 - code so let's do that dane this is very
78:32 - dangerous what i'm about to do right now
78:34 - but also all sorts of api keys i'm sure
78:37 - are going to be revealed
78:38 - so let me work on oh this is a little
78:41 - bit scary
78:42 - but let's try this uh thank you for
78:43 - indulging me and letting me do some like
78:45 - open source maintenance right now
78:47 - right this is the this is the repo
78:51 - that goes along with the videos and it
78:54 - does not have the latest
78:56 - code in it which is strange but do i
79:00 - have it
79:03 - on the desktop like in
79:06 - a folder called like discord bot choo
79:09 - choo tweets does anybody see it no let's
79:11 - all right let's just clone it
79:16 - we're gonna bring this repo down
79:20 - um i'm going to shut off so actually if
79:23 - somebody i don't know
79:24 - if kobe or david or anybody who's a mod
79:27 - in discord right now i guess i could do
79:29 - this myself
79:30 - but there's that bot testing channel if
79:31 - you could lock that channel down for a
79:33 - moment
79:34 - just make it only like admins or mods
79:36 - can post it um that would be good
79:38 - because i'm going to run some tests in
79:39 - there in a moment
79:41 - um and if nobody does that then i will
79:44 - do that
79:45 - um all right so now i have a what i'm
79:48 - actually going to turn off the bot
79:51 - in theory it'd be good if there was a
79:53 - better way to do this but
79:54 - they're just going to comment out the
79:55 - code right now this is my way
79:58 - of just saying the bot is deployed and
80:00 - running on glitch which also i need to
80:01 - make a video about
80:02 - how to deploy it all right so um the
80:05 - block
80:06 - now the bot is shut off uh david said
80:08 - done thank you
80:10 - um so now i am going to
80:14 - uh open this up in visual studio code
80:18 - so you know when uh whoops no let's
80:20 - actually go
80:22 - into the repo
80:27 - boy that pendulum stuff was fun wasn't
80:28 - it
80:30 - well we've got about 35 minutes here
80:31 - before i've gotta move on with my day
80:33 - so let's see how things go um so this
80:37 - is the discord bot code and this is dot
80:40 - env
80:40 - sample so if you haven't watched these
80:43 - tutorials
80:44 - um one of the things you need to do is
80:46 - have secret keys and tokens and codes
80:48 - to run your bot so i need to i'm going
80:50 - to save this as
80:52 - dot env so i'm going to have the real
80:55 - env file then i'm going to go over to
80:58 - discord
80:59 - and i'm going to click and copy the
81:01 - contents from this file into my local
81:03 - repo but i don't want you to see that so
81:05 - i'm moving over to here
81:08 - and i'm doing copy
81:11 - again it's not a coding train live
81:12 - stream i'm going to definitely going to
81:13 - show these to you by accident at some
81:15 - point
81:15 - but the fewer times i do that the better
81:19 - and now i copied i'm going back
81:22 - to dot env and i'm pasting
81:26 - um and
81:30 - um i am now
81:33 - closing that and going back to index.js
81:35 - okay
81:36 - so now i'm back in this file now here
81:40 - are my secret keys for this particular
81:43 - discord bot
81:44 - and i'm gonna try to run it right now
81:46 - ooh weird
81:48 - oh but this code is oh this is so weird
81:50 - this code doesn't match
81:53 - or maybe it does hold on
81:57 - i'm so confused
82:01 - this is like some really old code all
82:04 - right hold on
82:05 - let's also go back to glitch and grab
82:08 - this a little bit more recent
82:13 - why not i don't know what's going on i
82:15 - obviously haven't been keeping up with
82:17 - what i'm doing all right so now
82:19 - i've got the more slightly more recent
82:21 - code but i'm going to get even more
82:22 - recent code in a second then i need to
82:24 - go
82:24 - and do npm install to install the node
82:27 - dependencies
82:30 - and then let's try just running it okay
82:34 - now i'm going to go over to discord
82:36 - where's my discord
82:39 - and um i i'm gonna go here and then i'm
82:42 - going to go
82:44 - to the bot testing channel
82:47 - which is where it's okay i'm so troubled
82:51 - now so many channels
82:53 - i'll close this uh stage
82:56 - [Music]
83:00 - oh here it is spot testing okay uh
83:03 - choo choo
83:08 - hmm ah okay wait we got an error
83:12 - missing permissions
83:18 - what
83:22 - i like the little hearts popping in by
83:24 - the way well
83:25 - this i really meant to set this up
83:27 - before i started today
83:29 - missing permissions have i lost my mind
83:33 - and this is not the
83:34 - correct so hold on so let me quit this
83:40 - pretty sure this is the discord bot
83:44 - is this not do i have multiple glitch
83:47 - projects and this is like an old one
83:48 - that i found
83:49 - that's not actually running beep beep
83:58 - oh oh okay it was david's mistake
84:02 - my bad removed messages from the bot too
84:04 - okay
84:05 - phew should be fixed okay good good good
84:08 - good good
84:08 - all right all is right with the world um
84:12 - so let me let's try it again
84:16 - um and now i'm gonna go back to discord
84:19 - and
84:20 - i'm gonna try this again
84:30 - same issue
84:33 - [Music]
84:38 - tick tock tick tock
84:49 - let's see oh i'm not running the bot
84:51 - anymore so let's see
84:53 - maybe maybe i messed up oh there we go
84:56 - we're back we're back in business
84:58 - we're back we're back baby okay um all
85:01 - right so now then i can also say
85:03 - uh gif and we'll get a gif from
85:06 - uh the coding train and i can do things
85:08 - like gif
85:09 - um uh you know uh kitten
85:14 - and i will also get so that's these are
85:15 - the features that are in the discord bot
85:17 - so far
85:20 - i'm literally gonna get as far as like
85:22 - getting set up to add some code
85:24 - that are gonna be done with the live
85:25 - stream uh we'll see
85:27 - um all right so
85:31 - um now what do i want to do
85:34 - the next thing i want to do is go to the
85:37 - more recent
85:38 - code which is here and actually
85:42 - get the code that involves the command
85:47 - handler to work from there
85:48 - so i'm going to go here
85:52 - then i need to add um
85:56 - a folder called commands
86:00 - commands right is that what i do and
86:02 - then i'm just
86:03 - updating the code from what i actually
86:08 - did in the tutorial
86:10 - commands.js
86:15 - oh and then this is then i also need to
86:17 - make
86:21 - there's got to be a more efficient way
86:23 - for me to do this
86:24 - commands.js and a command's folder got
86:26 - it so now i'm going to make a file
86:28 - called commands.js
86:30 - not that needs to be out in the root
86:32 - directory move
86:35 - paste this code in then in here in
86:38 - commands itself i need choo choo
86:40 - dot js and
86:44 - uh what's the other one gif dot js right
86:47 - uh that's what the files i'm loading
86:49 - choo choo and gif
86:50 - and then you know i can go here and get
86:53 - the choo choo code
86:57 - which goes here and by the way all of
86:59 - this code is i
87:00 - you know i go through it in lots of
87:02 - detail in the
87:04 - video tutorials so i don't understand
87:07 - why
87:08 - where it went but obviously it was
87:10 - somewhere and here it is i'm just
87:12 - re-creating it
87:14 - and now let's just see what happens if
87:18 - i quit and
87:21 - run it again and is it still
87:25 - working i'm lost i'm lost where do i go
87:28 - discord
87:29 - uh choo choo great
87:33 - and gif right all right so everything's
87:35 - still working
87:37 - um thank you code guppy and marianne
87:40 - i'm keeping it up appreciate it very
87:42 - kind of you
87:44 - um so now
87:47 - next step
87:51 - let's create a branch
87:54 - called command a handler
87:59 - i'm going to check out that branch
88:03 - and this is new code from the command
88:10 - handler tutorial
88:14 - and let's push this to the command
88:16 - handler branch
88:21 - and i realize some of the stuff that i'm
88:22 - doing is going to be very unfamiliar to
88:24 - people who are in the audience right now
88:25 - hopefully just sort of seeing this
88:26 - process
88:27 - is helpful to you um i uh my get github
88:31 - videos could really use a refresher
88:33 - um and now i'm just gonna say um
88:37 - updating the code i should write
88:38 - something more thoughtful
88:40 - but this is a note to myself i will just
88:42 - keep it short and sweet and you're all
88:44 - watching i'm going to create this pull
88:45 - request
88:47 - and this we can see everything that i
88:49 - changed here
88:50 - all of the new code and the changes um
88:55 - um i can merge this
88:59 - then i can just go back to uh main
89:05 - and grab the code
89:08 - merge code and now for my grand finale
89:13 - i'm gonna i'm going to go back to
89:17 - um glitch and i'm going to go to
89:21 - tools import and export
89:26 - import from github
89:29 - and just
89:32 - go to here
89:38 - and import from github
89:41 - paste this in here let's see what
89:43 - happens
89:44 - it's basically rebuilding the project
89:47 - with all the code from github
89:49 - so this is kind of an awkward way
89:51 - awkward highly manual way of deploying a
89:53 - project
89:54 - but it's actually kind of working fairly
89:56 - well for me um you can see there's some
89:58 - log messages where it's kind of booting
90:00 - up and
90:00 - installing node and all of that let's
90:02 - wait for this to finish
90:07 - so now the updated code is deployed to
90:10 - glitch
90:14 - uh oh ah i messed something up
90:18 - so i forgot that i need for it to work
90:21 - on glitch
90:22 - i need to have a start script
90:26 - so i think this would be start and it
90:28 - needs to be i would just say node
90:30 - index.js
90:32 - so i need to add that i'm going to skip
90:36 - a few details here
90:38 - and just do uh
90:40 - [Music]
90:42 - i'm gonna uh i'm gonna do something
90:44 - really awful but uh
90:46 - i can't help it i'm pushing domain
90:49 - everybody
90:50 - look away everybody look away i'm not
90:52 - actually doing this
90:53 - look away i'm not doing this okay
90:57 - uh then i should be able to go back to
90:59 - glitch
91:01 - go to tools uh
91:04 - import import from github and just say
91:07 - okay again
91:08 - by the way i have not this is the only
91:09 - way i've not been able to get it to work
91:12 - where i could just push to glitch from
91:14 - from terminal i should be able to
91:16 - but i just pushed to github and then i
91:18 - just manually hit import on glitch
91:20 - and now hopefully yes i think it is
91:24 - oh throw error cannot find module node
91:26 - fetch
91:29 - what have i like messed up here uh the
91:32 - dependencies are wrong
91:34 - that's so weird
91:38 - hold on
91:41 - so strange what
91:46 - what is going on
91:52 - okay i don't know why that wasn't in my
91:55 - package.json what did i do to like
91:57 - remove it
92:04 - adding node fetch
92:07 - everybody look away again look away
92:11 - turn off your computers avert your eyes
92:15 - hide under your desks
92:17 - [Music]
92:20 - oh my god oh this is terrible
92:24 - all right now go back to import again
92:28 - import from github by the way no
92:32 - no no no no no this is very bad
92:36 - i don't like seeing that big red message
92:37 - here don't don't don't do something bad
92:39 - to my bot
92:40 - i don't think you can see it i don't
92:42 - think the whole git url was uh available
92:45 - to anybody
92:46 - if it was somebody let me know could i
92:49 - use a github action to automatically
92:51 - export to glish when glitch when you
92:53 - push the main
92:54 - joseph i i hope so um
92:57 - so i you can do this with a lot of other
93:00 - like
93:00 - with heroku or amazon or
93:03 - netlify or versal um so
93:07 - i i should get better at these kind of
93:08 - deployment systems aha
93:10 - there we go beep beep with a little
93:13 - sparkly hearty thingy
93:14 - that means my bot
93:18 - is active and running on um
93:22 - high code guppy um is
93:25 - running on
93:29 - um is running on glitch
93:33 - 237 folks we're making progress here
93:37 - welcome to what act coding is actually
93:39 - like oh i'm gonna add a new feature to
93:41 - this piece of software i'm working on
93:43 - but first i need to spend about an hour
93:44 - just to remember how i got it to run in
93:46 - the first place
93:47 - and also realizing that i didn't update
93:49 - the code in this place and then i have
93:50 - to deploy and then i have to check this
93:52 - and i have to not reveal my secret api
93:54 - key on a live stream
93:56 - [Music]
93:58 - welcome to software engineering everyone
94:04 - so flowstriker is asking why should you
94:06 - push domain directly
94:08 - i'm sure some other folks probably can
94:11 - offer some helpful thoughts in the chat
94:12 - i would encourage you to do so
94:14 - i you know i think there are
94:18 - everything you know context is key here
94:21 - and
94:22 - um i think there are scenarios where
94:25 - um you know if this discord bot were
94:28 - being used by
94:29 - millions of people around the world and
94:31 - it was a collaboration that i was
94:33 - building with tens of other people or
94:36 - like lots of collaborators
94:38 - um i would want to have a system with
94:40 - checks and balances where
94:41 - you couldn't just automatically override
94:44 - the sort of main branch of a source code
94:46 - repo
94:46 - without running some tests without
94:48 - having a code review
94:50 - without deploying it to a test server so
94:53 - in those there are like that in that
94:54 - context
94:56 - um you know pushing directly to maine
94:58 - would be a huge problem
95:02 - so in my context of like um
95:07 - keyboard smashing talking on the
95:09 - internet weirdo person like making a bot
95:11 - that posts
95:12 - gifts to a uh to a discord server that i
95:15 - own
95:17 - i'm happy to like bend the rules here
95:19 - but
95:20 - um you know it's important also to try
95:22 - to like set up some good habits but you
95:24 - don't want those hat over engineer those
95:25 - habits that they block you from your
95:27 - you know creative exploration so it's a
95:29 - fine line
95:32 - where to find that balance i definitely
95:34 - lean towards the side of
95:36 - just like keyboard smashing and
95:39 - experimental coding and uh you know
95:41 - really release early release often kind
95:43 - of stuff
95:44 - in the sort of creative coding art and
95:46 - expression education context
95:48 - but i do want to be mindful of good
95:50 - practices
95:51 - and people who really um uh um
95:55 - i hear of the pitter patter of little
95:56 - feet which means i think that pear tart
95:59 - might be ready soon i'm gonna have to go
96:00 - very soon uh but eric is writing um
96:05 - um eric wrote in the chat the idea is to
96:07 - work on branches and commit only when
96:08 - you know it works
96:10 - um i seem to know it works before
96:12 - committing which is not the case
96:13 - is the pair tart ready all right i just
96:15 - need i was gonna finish at
96:17 - three which is 20 minutes from now is
96:19 - that acceptable
96:20 - yeah okay all right everybody start your
96:23 - countdown clock let's see if i get a
96:25 - little bit further here
96:28 - i love actually having a hard out and
96:30 - that my kids come and tell me to stop
96:32 - because as you know i tend to just
96:34 - stream for the whole day and uh it
96:37 - doesn't help nobody's happy in the after
96:39 - two hours
96:46 - um which language am i using to make
96:48 - this bot this is in javascript
96:50 - um with node.js okay
96:53 - so where was i i'm going to go back and
96:56 - comment this out
96:58 - and i want to add a new feature
97:01 - there's no way i'm going to get very far
97:02 - with this right now so
97:04 - let's at least add a command um
97:07 - and we'll i'll be working on this more
97:10 - outside of the live stream with some
97:11 - contributions and then maybe
97:12 - make a video about it but
97:15 - let me add a command so the way i do
97:18 - that is by creating a new file
97:20 - i'm going to call it a number.js
97:24 - maybe i should call that randomnumber i
97:26 - don't know let's just get the chuchu one
97:28 - as
97:29 - a good starting point
97:32 - um and so if this
97:36 - message comes in i'm just going to say
97:39 - um
97:43 - i'm going to reply back with god uh i
97:45 - see you
97:48 - um so i'm just going to i just want to
97:50 - make sure the new command works
97:52 - and then in the commands folder i need
97:54 - to add
97:56 - another variable called number where i
97:58 - import number.js
98:00 - and then that is also a command so that
98:03 - should be good
98:04 - then i just want to redeploy not
98:06 - redeploy sorry i just want to run the
98:08 - bot
98:12 - and test it
98:15 - so choo choo and number
98:19 - oops number i see you okay great
98:23 - excellent so now the question is
98:27 - should the discord bot
98:32 - oh there's a lot of shouting going on
98:33 - downstairs should should the discord bot
98:36 - um offer set the rent let's let's make
98:40 - it so that you can set
98:41 - the random number for yourself so
98:45 - um so just as a quick feature
98:48 - um just to add a little bit more here
98:52 - so the arguments come in um
98:55 - so console.log let's see all right so
98:58 - let's just
98:59 - again i'm gonna have to be more
99:00 - thoughtful about this let's just say if
99:05 - oh yeah let's just say if there's an
99:06 - argument or just um
99:08 - i'm just gonna use one argument so um
99:12 - if args is greater than args.length
99:16 - is greater than zero and
99:19 - args index zero
99:23 - um i need to do a regular expression
99:26 - real quick
99:27 - so um um i think i can do like
99:31 - backslash d plus test
99:34 - um one two three is true
99:39 - uh it's also true so it needs to be the
99:40 - full thing so this needs to be
99:43 - this regular expression i'm skipping
99:44 - around to kind of get going here
99:47 - uh there we go okay so this is my
99:50 - regular expression
99:51 - to check to make sure it's a digit and
99:55 - um if there is an argument
99:58 - and that argument is
100:02 - a num a valid number uh
100:08 - then uh
100:12 - we're gonna say i set your
100:19 - i set your number to
100:25 - args zero
100:30 - oh that doesn't go there
100:33 - otherwise i'm gonna say
100:38 - uh i need a number why i shouldn't have
100:40 - the bot be saying i
100:42 - oh my goodness muhammad is upgrading
100:44 - their membership
100:45 - thanks mohammed um i um
100:50 - i'm going to say number number
100:54 - set to please provide
100:58 - please provide a valid whole
101:02 - number so this is now
101:05 - what i want basically is to test to see
101:08 - did i get a number or not
101:10 - so let's uh rerun the bot what what kind
101:13 - of error happened there
101:15 - commands command is not a function oh it
101:17 - breaks if there's not a command
101:19 - that's interesting i should definitely
101:20 - need some error handling there
101:23 - and there's an error message i guess i
101:25 - need another
101:27 - parenthesis there
101:30 - so now i should be able to say uh number
101:34 - hello please provide a valid whole
101:36 - number
101:38 - number one two three four five numbers
101:40 - set to one two three four five
101:42 - awesome so you can see though this is
101:44 - good i've got a feature going here
101:47 - i wanted to do a so now i'm going to try
101:49 - to set up a mongodb
101:51 - oh well no chance i have time to do this
101:55 - um what's a good way to wrap up in the
101:59 - next
102:00 - 15 minutes well let's get started i'm
102:01 - gonna get started on it
102:03 - um now everyone tells me the last time i
102:05 - did something like this
102:07 - i was told i should be using mongoose
102:10 - but i have no idea what that is but i'm
102:12 - gonna look up mongodb atlas
102:16 - which i believe is um previously i've
102:19 - made video tutorials on how to do this
102:21 - with firebase
102:23 - um but recently i was playing around
102:25 - mongodb atlas and i kind of liked it
102:27 - which is their like cloud service now
102:30 - i think i might have already created an
102:32 - account with my
102:33 - so i'm just going to try to like i'm
102:35 - going to move off here and try to like
102:36 - log in with my account for a second
102:40 - oh password manager
102:43 - so hold on a second uh talk amongst
102:49 - [Music]
102:54 - yourselves
102:57 - [Music]
103:00 - the number of times i do this while i'm
103:02 - live streaming
103:05 - is insane
103:10 - i should really have this as like a
103:11 - favorite or something
103:14 - here we go show enlarge type
103:22 - somebody told me i should mute myself
103:24 - when i'm typing in my passwords because
103:26 - you could
103:26 - figure it out from audio
103:38 - [Music]
103:45 - all right back to being unmuted all
103:47 - right yeah
103:49 - oh right i've shown this because this is
103:53 - what i'm using for
103:54 - the other side project that i
103:57 - failed to keep going uh the forrest gump
104:01 - 500 project i
104:02 - really love some contributions and help
104:04 - with that because i feel like um
104:07 - um so but
104:11 - we'll see uh uh
104:14 - g-joe jijo says i think that if someone
104:17 - knows your password from the audio
104:18 - they 100 deserve it i kind of agree i
104:21 - also have two factors so what's it
104:22 - really going to do for you
104:27 - so i think what i need to create
104:31 - is um
104:34 - um uh solar liner is saying i'm just
104:38 - curious about this comment
104:39 - um you should talk about deploying with
104:41 - docker2 a dockercompose.yml file along
104:44 - with a simple server would solve all
104:45 - your deployment problems
104:47 - okay i'm interested in this tell me more
104:50 - tell me more about solving all of my
104:52 - deployment problems
104:54 - i don't really know very much about
104:55 - docker so that would be really helpful
104:57 - and awesome
104:59 - uh all right um
105:02 - so what i need to do here is create
105:07 - this is like the gump 500 database
105:10 - how do i make a new one create a new
105:14 - cluster
105:15 - no i'm in a cluster this is definitely a
105:18 - cluster
105:20 - what gum 500 how do i make what is gump
105:23 - 500
105:25 - is that a like um
105:28 - if i go here project i want a new
105:32 - project right
105:35 - random what should i call this
105:39 - uh i'll just call it random numbers okay
105:43 - next um
105:46 - knock i will add some other people later
105:48 - maybe i'm the owner
105:49 - create the project
105:54 - then the idea here is that
105:58 - do i need to build a cluster
106:01 - i need a cluster
106:04 - okay or do i do database
106:08 - grade data lake what's a lake there's a
106:10 - lake with data in it
106:13 - do i click build does anybody know let's
106:15 - create the cluster ah
106:17 - oh no no no wait
106:20 - free free free yes yes yes for learning
106:23 - mongodb
106:23 - or small applications yes okay
106:26 - um i guess i don't need to do i need to
106:28 - do another one i'm so confused
106:32 - um aws i do have this looks good
106:38 - fine
106:40 - okay connect
106:44 - i got 10 minutes i think i actually
106:45 - could do this because to be honest i'm
106:48 - i'm
106:48 - um this is going to be skipping some
106:50 - steps but just to get a little further
106:51 - here
106:53 - if i go to the gump 500 project
106:58 - which is a twitter bot that i am
107:02 - working with mongodb is
107:06 - i kind of have the code for all of that
107:08 - here so i can just grab this code but
107:10 - let's um
107:14 - so okay so i think i need to now
107:17 - um i think i need to click on this
107:19 - connect button
107:20 - and this connect button is maybe going
107:22 - to give me some
107:24 - secret information um
107:31 - and so i'm gonna also switch over here
107:34 - this is why by the way recording video
107:35 - tutorial is as good of this stuff
107:37 - because then i could just like keep
107:38 - everything in but blur
107:39 - out or reset all the tokens afterwards
107:42 - but live streaming is typical
107:43 - difficult connect
107:50 - by the way i really have no idea what
107:51 - i'm doing here
107:53 - and this might be completely overkill
107:55 - but i've really been looking for
107:58 - a simple free database as a service
108:00 - cloud service
108:02 - um and in my
108:05 - experience i guess i'm still creating
108:08 - that cluster
108:10 - so unfortunately we're in this sort of
108:12 - like wait waiting so while we're waiting
108:16 - let's go um back to
108:19 - here and
108:22 - um in index let's require let's see hold
108:26 - on um
108:28 - let's go back to gump oh my cluster is
108:30 - complete of course this happens
108:32 - so now i'm going to click on this
108:35 - connect button but i'm taking you away
108:37 - because i don't know
108:38 - what's going to pop up no it still says
108:41 - it's
108:41 - what this is so weird didn't it just say
108:45 - it was finished
108:46 - now it's saying it's being created again
108:48 - this is so bizarre
108:50 - all right let me go back to here
108:53 - and go to here and i want to
108:56 - require mongodb so i
109:00 - know i need to add to my bot
109:04 - require mongodb i need to say
109:08 - npm install mongodb
109:12 - so i'm adding the mongodb javascript
109:15 - thingy the node package
109:18 - then uh inside in
109:21 - the to connect to the database i'm going
109:23 - to just
109:24 - connect catch i'm going to just add this
109:26 - exact code
109:29 - um which will
109:32 - oh it should really be in the numbers
109:35 - yeah i'm gonna
109:36 - you know what i'm gonna do
109:39 - well so tricky here right now i'm going
109:41 - to assume
109:42 - i'm going to do something to make the
109:43 - assumption that this mongodb
109:45 - is only for that number command so i'm
109:48 - going to take this out
109:50 - i'm going to put it in here and i think
109:53 - this kind of like to the database when
109:56 - it boots up thing
109:57 - will still happen
110:01 - if i put this just into the number file
110:06 - right so um
110:09 - so i could have made a new database i
110:12 - could have made a new
110:13 - database with a dif with the same
110:16 - cluster some i don't understand
110:18 - what the cluster is versus the database
110:20 - versus the collection
110:21 - i've got to figure that out but let's
110:24 - just um
110:25 - so i'm going to create a uh a numbers db
110:31 - and uh we'll call this numbers
110:36 - people i don't know uh numbers db i want
110:39 - to connect to
110:41 - um oh and there's uh i want to just
110:44 - connect to that database
110:48 - so let's see i just want to successfully
110:50 - connect to this database
110:53 - so back to the page that might have my
110:56 - hopefully my
110:57 - secret connection stuff yeah okay so
110:59 - first of all
111:01 - it's definitely live
111:04 - now it's connected now i'm really going
111:06 - to hit this button
111:08 - collections i didn't i don't understand
111:12 - can i use the same i'm so confused
111:14 - someone will explain this to me
111:17 - but let me just click connect okay
111:21 - allow access from anywhere set up
111:23 - security
111:24 - choose a connection method okay the
111:27 - first user will have
111:28 - keep credentials handy okay so i i can
111:31 - show this to you
111:32 - so i'm going to create a database user
111:37 - with allow access from anywhere
111:41 - which is probably a little bit scary to
111:45 - do and i'm going to make a user called
111:48 - coding train and then i am going to
111:51 - auto generate a secure password i assume
111:54 - it's going to let me regenerate one
111:56 - so i'm going to i'm going to click that
111:58 - a bunch of times
112:00 - then um i'm going to hit create database
112:03 - user keep your credentials handy
112:06 - let me let me try to save that password
112:16 - i'm saving that password in my env file
112:20 - right now
112:22 - and then i'm going to hide it so now i
112:24 - can go back and hit create database user
112:28 - choose a connection method
112:31 - connect your app so this is where
112:36 - i don't remember which one i pick
112:39 - i think it's connect your application oh
112:41 - javascript interface
112:43 - no i think it must be this one
112:47 - yes okay i shouldn't be showing this to
112:49 - you
112:51 - but at least i'm not showing you the use
112:54 - the password
112:55 - but i think even this like this cluster
112:57 - address i probably should be keeping
112:59 - secret but i'm going to copy this
113:06 - oh look at this and it gives me this is
113:07 - definitely right node.js
113:09 - i could actually get a full driver code
113:11 - example but i'm going to copy this
113:13 - and i'm going to put this into my
113:16 - env file i'll show you in a second
113:20 - so db
113:27 - um mongodb
113:31 - so i'm going to i just want to zoom
113:35 - where the the and put this off the
113:36 - screen so i
113:38 - what i'm going to do is in my dot env if
113:40 - i'm ready
113:42 - db and i'm putting this um
113:45 - url path oh i'm showing you my tenor key
113:48 - i didn't realize my other key was there
113:50 - good job everybody thank you
113:52 - thank you and good night thank you thank
113:54 - you thank you
113:55 - and that's the end of today's go
113:59 - we showed it's 2 58 pm i showed you one
114:02 - of my api keys
114:03 - and we're done uh
114:09 - the cluster is a server the server can
114:11 - have any amount of database
114:13 - the database can have any amount of
114:14 - collections so i should have done this a
114:16 - different way
114:19 - um you know have fun with my tenor key
114:23 - i'm gonna just reset that pretty soon
114:25 - so good luck move fast people i'm gonna
114:27 - do that right now
114:31 - um let's see tenor
114:34 - api key i mean i don't know what you
114:37 - could do with that
114:40 - uh sign in i'm resetting that api key
114:47 - really i don't even know where okay it's
114:49 - going to take me a while to find how i
114:50 - even logged into tenor in the first
114:52 - place
114:52 - so i think that api key just lets you
114:54 - get gifts so
114:56 - um you know all right uh
115:00 - the funny thing is i seriously am done
115:04 - the cluster is a virtual machine that
115:06 - runs the database so i should
115:08 - have done this right it's three o'clock
115:10 - so
115:11 - you know welcome to the new coding train
115:13 - where i just cut myself off at a certain
115:14 - time
115:16 - let me just talk about what my intention
115:18 - is to do next um
115:19 - and if anybody wants to help uh
115:21 - contribute i think i'm gonna make a
115:23 - branch
115:24 - so let me make a let me let me finish
115:25 - off by um
115:30 - making a branch with what i've done so
115:32 - far
115:33 - i'm just going to close the dot env file
115:38 - i'm going to here so i'm going to
115:42 - um here i'm going to go back to
115:46 - here i'm gonna do git branch a number db
115:50 - get check out number db um
115:53 - git add git commit
115:56 - um new code for random number
116:00 - db
116:04 - so now that branch
116:08 - i'll even make it like a draft i'll show
116:10 - you something that's that you can do
116:13 - so i can make this a draft pull request
116:16 - starting to work on
116:17 - a database of random numbers
116:20 - um this this is for the coding train
116:24 - custom random number whistle
116:28 - project and i should um
116:34 - i should link to this repo as well
116:38 - and then i think i can do this create
116:41 - draft
116:42 - pull request so this isn't done but the
116:44 - code you can find it
116:46 - if you want to look at what i've done so
116:48 - far by going to this pull request
116:51 - and i am going to add that back into
116:54 - discord
116:55 - under links um i'm gonna
116:59 - say goodbye so i will continue to work
117:02 - on this
117:03 - uh maybe i'll revisit it next week's
117:05 - live stream
117:06 - uh maybe i'll just do it on my own or
117:08 - you know some other contributors will
117:10 - add to it
117:11 - um just as a reminder um as i wrap up
117:14 - here
117:15 - um you know we did have some successes
117:17 - today
117:18 - by creating this sort of pretty
117:19 - interesting examples of this like
117:21 - whole collection of pendulums that are
117:23 - like upside down
117:24 - swinging back and forth i actually
117:26 - really think i want to leave this
117:28 - this it's lovely but i kind of really
117:30 - liked it with the lines
117:32 - so i actually am going to change it back
117:35 - to the lines
117:38 - so we can just remember what that looked
117:40 - like oh take out the circles
117:44 - um so we can see what that looks like
117:46 - with just the lines so
117:48 - if you just joined recently this is what
117:50 - i did earlier in today's live stream
117:52 - um if you make a version of this please
117:54 - share with me right now the best place
117:55 - be shared with me at twitter
117:57 - shiffman on twitter um i really want to
118:00 - encourage you hopefully the next one
118:01 - will be out
118:02 - later today or tomorrow but i really
118:04 - want to encourage you
118:06 - to follow along with the new nature of
118:09 - code video tutorials
118:10 - um add your uh community contributions
118:14 - here
118:15 - uh leimer daniel doesn't have to be the
118:17 - only person with community contributions
118:19 - add them here and um i really also want
118:22 - to remind you to
118:24 - um check out this syllabus that i'm
118:26 - actively working on that i really
118:28 - welcome
118:29 - suggestions and pull requests um here as
118:32 - well
118:33 - so i'm going to put on this goodbye song
118:42 - and just answer maybe
118:45 - one or two last questions from the chat
118:51 - and then i'll be saying goodbye
118:54 - and uh bot testing is reopened i think
118:56 - that i should re-enable the
118:58 - glitch spot so let's
119:02 - oh it actually it's not running so let
119:04 - me put uh
119:07 - the coding train bot back on
119:12 - um do you speak oh no i'm just looking
119:14 - socket servers so people are talking
119:15 - about
119:16 - sockets and node um
119:21 - and i'm just checking out the chat
119:23 - there's not really too many questions
119:25 - there right now of course you're all a
119:26 - little bit behind
119:27 - so uh oh i didn't give the random
119:30 - numbers to our new members
119:33 - so who are those new members i'm
119:34 - scrolling up boy there's a lot of chat
119:40 - by the way thank you to marianne
119:42 - marianne marion
119:44 - and code guppy for all of your support
119:46 - it's very kind of you
119:48 - uh we've got um ronnie and joseph
119:52 - i didn't even read any random numbers
119:56 - today
120:00 - so um i'm ronnie your random number that
120:04 - i just
120:04 - this is cool that's the first three
120:06 - numbers of it or the first three digits
120:08 - of pi
120:08 - well not the first yeah i mean if you
120:10 - count the three as a digit
120:12 - um so from page 137 6 000
120:15 - row 6825 your number is 31
120:19 - 413 right and then we could just set it
120:23 - in discord
120:26 - but can't do that yet so that might give
120:28 - people new rand
120:30 - what's one random number versus another
120:31 - now for joseph
120:33 - [Music]
120:38 - joseph
120:40 - oh this is kind of a cool random from
120:42 - page 27 row 1
120:43 - 325 88 890.
120:49 - that's your random number joseph thank
120:50 - you to joseph and i'm ronnie for joining
120:54 - um i'm checking out the chat which now i
120:57 - have scrolled
120:58 - up a six-point snowflake generator
121:02 - why don't you make a playlist of all
121:03 - your live streams
121:05 - so this is oh oh i feel kind of sad
121:08 - about this no so i just need to do that
121:11 - i really would like to have a nice
121:14 - solid playlist of all of my live streams
121:16 - well annotated
121:18 - and it's just a lot of work to maintain
121:19 - and do that so um
121:23 - if i can um you know get somebody from
121:25 - the coding train team to allocate some
121:27 - time to work on that or if somebody from
121:29 - the community wants to sort of volunteer
121:30 - to help with that
121:31 - that's definitely something i would like
121:33 - to do but it's i'm just like
121:35 - i fell so far behind and it's not
121:36 - something into my sort of weekly
121:39 - work practice of like going back to the
121:41 - live stream adding time codes
121:43 - adding a description linking to all the
121:44 - things i talked about
121:46 - but it would be so helpful for people to
121:48 - be able to go back and find things like
121:50 - even just that one little section about
121:51 - me coding the pendulum
121:52 - so i would love help for that
121:54 - [Music]
121:56 - um
122:01 - abhay writes you didn't see this one dan
122:03 - but i'm not sure what that's referring
122:05 - to
122:05 - a very auspicious number i would agree a
122:09 - very
122:09 - auspicious number all right everybody
122:11 - goodbye thank you again to uh
122:13 - curiositystream for
122:15 - uh sponsoring today's live stream and i
122:17 - will see you all hopefully next
122:19 - week stay tuned for all of the new
122:23 - nature of code videos that are coming
122:24 - whip to be released click the like and
122:27 - subscribe stuff don't you don't have to
122:29 - though you really don't have to i just

Cleaned transcript:

do do do check one two testing my audio i had a little bit of a just bitty disaster as i tripped over the hdmi cable connected to my camera and uh i had to go find another hdmi cable but amazingly i'm barely late so uh i will be starting in just about a minute and a half let me know how my audio is thank you very much hello welcome to the coding train it's a kind of a miracle that i am here for you on camera slightly off to the side because i actually had no idea what i would look like when i pressed the button to switch to this camera right here to broadcast and live stream this if i move over this way because i tripped over i knocked the tripod over the cables went flying when the hdmi cables got bent i had already pressed start to the music actually no that was right before i pressed start i got another cable then i pressed start anyway it was like a mad rush in the last five minutes to get started here but i'm looking over and the lighting seems fine i'm assuming people can hear me uh i see audio coming through and i'm sitting here i wore a a slightly nicer shirt than i usually do on a saturday for you today i hope you appreciate that you don't need to appreciate that but uh i appreciate you i should be the one appreciating you um i do want to maybe make some adjustments here but before i do any of that i'm really excited to tell you about a new sponsor i have for the coding train live streams and so i want to very quickly let's see if i can press the right buttons to make this happen i'm going to click over here ah and i'm excited to tell you about today's sponsor of the coding train curiosity stream so launched by media visionary john hendricks who founded the discovery channel you know back when it was actually good um you know it's lot of reality tv on there now uh qrsd stream is the awardwinning destination for documentary films and tv shows covering every topic from space exploration to adventure to the secret lives of wild animals so you can sign up see that link that's above me there curiositystream.com codingtree uh if you sign up at that link hopefully somebody can post it into the chat um it's also in the video's description you'll get a 26 discount on the annual hd plan it's 14.79 for the entire year which is kind of mindblowing to me i know money means a different thing to different people all over the world but i was thinking about how much i'd spend on just renting a movie time to time um and so uh um there's just a huge library of stuff you will also get access to the streaming video service nebula that i've talked about on several occasions here on the coding train um you can also see coding train videos on nebula a lot of other original content and from youtube creators when you sign up for curiosity stream using the link that's above me and hopefully by now it's gotten posted to the chat and i see that nico thank you for posting to the chat so um back to here so i'll come back and um we'll maybe look at a couple interesting recommendations i have for you i was watching last night a documentary on the on moose and there's like moose i think it's called moose on curiosity streams with my kids because we love to watch nature shows little cute little moose babies they were so wonderful um anyway really helps me out if you consider signing up so um i what am i gonna do today today is a day of coding that's ostensibly what i do um and i want to open today with looking at some of the recent video tutorials and by the way my glasses are incredibly dirty i can barely see a thing is there any way that i could possibly clean them maybe before i start live streaming for all i know there's like a giant piece of like jelly on my face i was having a peanut butter and jelly crepe earlier is that a weird thing to announce on live youtube in any case um i'm a little bit discombobulated even a little bit more so than i usually am i am enjoying looking at the chat i'm going to move this document out of the way uh and go over here and am i in the right discord channel i am oh have you joined the coding train discord let's see if i can open that up um oh good you're not seeing it because i want you to see it in a second i'm going to go over to here this is where the coding train community uh hangs out um during the times in between my live streams uh there's a wonderful community of folks there we've added some new moderators recently thank you to everyone who's come aboard to help moderate the discord um but mostly the reason why i mention it is as i'm doing stuff today on the live stream various things that i might be coding or talking about i will post links to them so i mean obviously i could post them to the youtube chat maybe that would be more efficient but i don't have easy access to that i like to kind of keep things um the youtube chat could disappear and who knows so i like to post things to this discord channel as i'm going so um i would love for you to join you can go to thecodingtrain.com discord or i have this button here when i press it it puts an invite to the discord in the chat i love my elgato stream deck it's over here it's really cool i'm looking at you elgato um let's see what else do i want to say so i'll be here till about three o'clock as some of you who might have watched my other recent live streams um saturdays uh one of these days i should really like not live stream and do the baking class with my kids but my kids are taking a zoom baking class today i believe is a pear tart so it goes between one and three they're not completely unsupervised in the kitchen there's another adult present uh making sure you know nothing light's on fire they're you know they're nine and 12. so they can handle themselves it's not like there's a you know twoyearold turning the oven on anymore it's uh that's just that didn't happen if it did i i apologize to all the other twoyearolds who am i even talking to anymore sometimes it's very hard to just keep speaking words continuously when you're in a room by yourself in an attic really staring at a camera i do see the outside world there's a nice window over there and i see brooklyn i see little rooftops of buildings and looks like the sun is coming out uh the snow is sort of melting although we're supposed to get four inches of snow tomorrow what was i was i but but i'm gonna jump right in because time is a wasting and i have a limited amount of time so this spring if you've been following me recently and i'm i'm you know a little bit crawling through the mud here and making progress although i am making progress this spring from now until probably through the summer really but at least until uh april or may it's not the spring yet it's clearly the winter if you look outside in new york city but my focus is the nature of code so let me uh say a few words about that first of all you can check out the nature of code book i'm not trying to sell you something here this is actually a um you know there are ways that you can support the project if you feel so inclined but this is a uh an open source uh book project with 10 chapters about creative coding and physics simulation um that um i really should figure out what i always want to say that i published in somebody fact check me on this i think i think i published this in 2012 that's my guess right now i had to guess um but i haven't and i've been talking about publishing a second edition of it probably for like the last four or five years so you can see how well this is going um but i am really trying to double down on that make that my sole focus i'm teaching a course at nyu right now called guess what drum roll the nature of code um and i'm going to go over here and one of the things that i'm really excited about that i figured out how to do is we started using um at nyu well we nyu is now using a learning management system it's called brightspace i don't know if any of you use it for your schools or if you are involved with schools but i i really want not wanting to use learning management systems because i don't want the content that i work the educational content that i work on to be locked into a proprietary system um at the same time students privacy is a big concern um there's often a lot of you know postings and chatter and sort of administrative stuff that goes along with running a course that i don't want to be in an open platform so what i finally figured out how to do was keep all of my notes for each week so if i go here i'm just going to go to module 1 vectors keep them all as in an open source repo this is basically the assignment the videos and uh reading material some of this right now actually unfortunately if you click on this pdf maybe i can remedy this as only that's when the draft pdfs i've only made available in google drive if you have certain permissions but i don't mind sharing those more broadly but the point of what i'm saying is i have figured out how i can embed this markdown file into brightspace so the students can the reason why i mention this is i would love for any of you who are out there to follow along with this material feel free to complete the assignments yourself i'm going to show you where you can share them on the coding train website um i'm going to show you a bunch that some people have unknowingly done i mean they know that they did them maybe they don't know that they did them as part of like this course and um i would like and i would love your contributions so for example something that's really missing here on my notes are uh additional supplemental readings and material that might not be authored by me um in particular um you know i tend to uh most of the resources that i've researched and created with nature of code come from a kind of western american white male perspective and you know i try to be mindful of sharing um diverse artists especially uh black indigenous people of color and so if you have artists and references that you think would be relevant you know i don't want each one of these pages to be you know you know thousands of links long but i do want to curate and add and continue to update it so if you would like to continue the issues are open the pull rook continue if you'd like to contribute the issues are open the pull requests are open i encourage you you can see right now um there's nothing as of module 3. obviously the material for the modules exists on the internet and other places but i'm slowly putting them together you know i i'm not asking anyone to do my work for me but if you want to make a little fun project see if you could create one of these readme files for one of the later weeks based on all of the things that's in different places on the internet you could certainly do that and i would uh happily review it um this is my main focus right here so the updating the book is going along with this that's still on a little bit of hold i don't really have time to look at the book text too much but what's really happening live in motion going going going going going is the new videos so while i know it's disappointing to some folks that these coding challenges are few and far between i will i'm excited to say that there's a couple that have been recorded that will come out as part of coding challenges um my focus has been on um the nature of code uh playlist and what you'll see here is this most recently there are now four videos that go along with chapter three angles in motion angular motion angles and vectors polar coordinates i see that um kuntal in the chat is asking for these links so thank you for asking um kunta i am going to show you how i share links uh it's very hot and stig is actually a question about the platform for publishing the book so i'm happy to discuss that for a little bit i do have a tendency to like take up a half an hour when i start discussing that but let me see if i can return to that in one second so let me just offer some of these links um i'm gonna put them here in discord so remember this is in the live uh i can just zoom in on this in discord there is a category called live um i try to post updates to my schedule here and schedule um and links are where i'll post links of things i'm doing so here is that repo here is the nature of code book and one more link i want to make sure i share is this page that has all of the videos so far uh and then um i think let's see if this comes up yeah i can usually find it it's the the playlist on youtube uh is also the nature of code too and i've you ever some of you have watched my recent live streams know that i i feel a great amount of pain when i look at this page oh i just like my soul aches for the features that youtube implemented and took away oh i almost i mean i'm not gonna move off of youtube but boy certainly it's not helping me feel you know i have lots of mixed feelings about youtube as a platform there's the benefits for me right now outweigh the the the deficits um but the lack of the learning playlist uh structure that they had implemented is really it really makes me sad anybody from youtube is watching this thank you for listening to me and by the way everybody that i've worked with at youtube is absolutely lovely and has taken feedback graciously and works really hard so it's not a criticism these are big complicated software systems people are working on with a lot of different incentives so i don't mean that as a criticism i'm just i'm just sad a little bit sad i'm gonna read some random numbers that makes me happy what was i doing ah pasting this link in here all right so that's the link to that particular playlist i will tell you that chapter three um if we're looking at chapter three there's actually a 2.6 video that i made back in march like basically the day before uh well it wasn't you know there's no exact date to really pinpoint when the pandemic hit but at least it was kind of the day before everything shut down in new york city i mean i never got to releasing it it's also like it was kind of a mess that video so there's a 2.6 coming i think i should release it um and then uh 3. 3.5 6 7 and 8. there's four more videos for chapter three as well as two coding challenges so there's a lot coming it's all been recorded just putting it together waiting to publish it um all right i'm looking at the chat and juan says i got the physical nature of code book for my birthday last year and it was a great gift juan i'm so happy to hear that um i don't know if i could ever i mean it's far be it for me to assume that me signing anybody's book is something anybody actually wants but if i could ever meet you in person someday and you have your book with you i would be glad to write you a nice little note and hopefully i can remember and say i remember when you wrote about this on chat on the youtube live stream um okay so the first thing that i wanted to do today um is just look at some things that people um just remind you about the community contribution system that i have which by the way i have some i have some kind of secret plans nobody knows about this not even some of the people i really need to fill some people in um um there's been a the website the coding team website is a community driven project um and i have some plans for it so i'll be in touch with those of you who spend a lot of time helping to maintain the website um but what i wanted to remind you is right now for every single video and don't worry too much about am i posting this in the right place just share what you're making if you go to any particular video uh page first of all the code is there this is really important and uh sometimes there'll be more than one example with each video so you can see web editor um you can just you know if i'm looking at web editor and i just click right here on this one and then run the sketch this is a particular sketch that i demo demonstrate in the video and the code that goes along with it so i wanted to make sure everyone's aware of that um and then i also want to just highlight this community contribution section so if you make a sketch oh actually sorry if you make anything honestly it could be you made a sweater you drew you painted a picture i it doesn't have to be a code contribution a p5 if you if you um are uh putting something out there and you want to share it with me and the community this is the place to do it it's not the easiest thing to do uh requires a little bit of comfort with github a little bit of willingness to like put yourself out there we i hope that i and the rest of the folks who are helping to manage the repo are friendly and welcoming and inclusive so don't worry you can't do it wrong it's a learning opportunity for all of us to participate in these systems but um you can look at this guide uh for how to add your sketch i also have a little video that i think is still up to date and some information about how to do it um and then let me go and find one where there's one actually there so for example here we go uh lemur daniel great name daniel wow what an excellent name you've got there this coffee is very hot i've burnt my tongue on it at least three times while streaming and i'm now trying to drink it very slowly talk amongst yourself delicious so sometimes i will pick a contribution across everything and show it but i thought i wanted to really kind of want to like highlight these videos to make sure people are aware they exist and getting your feedback and that sort of stuff so let me click here on uh fortune wheels and let's take a look at oh cool so this is definitely based on one of the examples i remember referring to and making where you kind of have this wheel and i by the way this comes from my example it's a very awkward um kind of like dragon release interaction code there's probably a much more elegant thoughtful way of maybe doing a running average over time of how you're moving the arrow so that when you release i think i'm just taking like the last two frames of the p of the draw loop and looking at where the arrow is and then seeing how far apart they are and kind of applying that as a force but you can see this is called wheels 4 sector count 10 audio off so oh oh my goodness this is wild sector count oh whoa i had no idea i looked at this earlier audio can you hear the audio i think you can that's pretty cool great work uh daniel an excellent name by the way i just want to make it clear you're quite allowed to publish a community contribution to the website even if your name isn't daniel just putting that out there uh okay um so now let's see if we have any more i think they might all be from lemur daniel uh angular motion none yet you could be the first um angles and vectors oh we've got two from lemur daniel thank you lemur daniel let's take a look at these quickly asteroid game vector thrust um whoa cool um ah oh this is fun so this is like so one of the things the videos talks about is how to use of the angle of a vector to apply a velocity or a force as well as how to um have an object you're drawing like this ship here point in the direction of motion so those are some of the things i'm covering in the videos cursor control oh that's cool oh wait a second this is like a steering behavior like basically i can oh my god i don't know why i've never thought of this is this a thing that other asteroid games do like i'm able to like apply the force um by just using the mouse cursor is it like stronger the further away i go oops kind of looks like it is like if i'm really close yeah it is it's proportional that's well great work ah this is a great train whistle for this one all right this is great very impressed um now um let me look at um vec was that what i was looking at vector thrust or asteroid game i think was looking at asteroid game oh this is just oh cool so one of the things i love about this is also like showing the vectors so you know i could do a better job of this um oh thank you abe is sharing something with me um which i will uh pull up in a second um so one of the things that i could do a better job of is having some of the examples be selfdocumenting or selfillustrative that's a way to say it like by including drawing the vectors that are part of how it works can really help people understand and see um i so the red vector is the current velocity i would assume and the uh white vector is the force that's being applied thrust instant progressive i don't even oh that's interesting friction on off testing oh this is wild look at this that is so cool i mean it's not just annotating a system and diagramming out what all the pieces are and notating the angles and the lengths this is this is really cool to see thank you for this so i hope you all check that check out these projects and hopefully if you're like trying to figure out how to make something like this yourself the video tutorial will help you let's see what else do i got 3.4 i just published this morning so i don't think there are any community contributions but i will point out to you that if you've ever wondered how to kind of do things like this like think about the asteroids game this is actually drawing a circle using polar coordinates and then moving every point along that surf i'm offsetting all the points along the perimeter of a circle randomly closer or further to the center and then putting it together as a polygon so um lots of fun stuff here that you're welcome to do so actually one of the things that i was this is a little bit backwards but the kind of first thing that i want to do today um is for and let's see if i can find it so um in the coding train sketches if you ever want to like figure out what's coming up in future videos you could probably just go to the coding train sketches because you can see all of these things like i'm working on a selfavoiding walk i actually recorded a video but it was uh i i think i have to throw away the footage unfortunately it should have like a second channel with like all just rough blooper cuts of everything by the way though if you want to join coding training as a member um some of my recording sessions i broadcast to have people tuning in to give feedback and that's one of the benefits of joining as a member which is somewhere a button somewhere on your youtube page um so but ah soft pendulum spring i'm looking for recently i recorded a video tutorial about a pendulum january 20th 2021 this seems right which is this ah and so one of the examples in the video um that i mentioned oh oh oh i meant to share abe's sketch as well but let me finish this thought um one of the um example one of the prompts that i mentioned in the video is what if you had an array of these pendulums kind of like all swinging together and so often what i'm doing now with these videos is when i talk through an example and then give an assignment prompt i'll kind of like show the results of that assignment and then link to the example and so i thought like it's a good thing for me to actually like code some of these up during often i just do it like i have i have 15 minutes here i need to create this extra example for the video but i would like to do a lot of these during the live streams so that's kind of like a little extra coding challenge today bonus um where i'm going to attempt to make a version of this with like more pencil it's a little bit backwards because i haven't even released the video that explains this code yet so i don't know you may make a mental note go back and watch that video when it comes out come back and watch this later who knows just enjoy this right now go and do something else right now i have no idea but that's what i'm going to work on while i'm getting set up um let me see if i can find um abe's sketch i'm always hesitant to open up uh discord channels without uh permission um and i'm gonna open this one up oh my goodness oh right this is the stuff that abe and simon are working on together also i believe so you'll have to tell me um the sketch that i'm about to show whether this was one of your collaborations or not but this is really fun so i'm excited to show this to you here it comes all right this deserves a nice little uh uh snare drum ready everybody we're gonna see some exciting spinny springy thingy my bobbers cool so this is a by the way i it's not a big deal and uh i like to look at the sketches um at the the with the full view because it keeps um the most chaotic thing ever it keeps the link to the code and uh noting that it's part of p5 here on the top but look at this so this is coming i have a video about um doing like these springy things so this is actually an example from one of the videos i believe yeah this is the just this like soft stringy thing is the coding challenge that i do pretty debris recently and then um angles and rotation and more springy stuff cool i'm going to just put on a little music thank you for this abe great job and um i am just gonna put on a little music for a second while i get myself set up do so i i i'm looking for i need i need a pendulum class for what i want to do i'm noticing like there's some things that i want to update with this example but um i will do that right now so let me save this and we're going to call this video the pendulum video is going to be coding challenge 159 coding challenge 159 pendulum um exercise so and i think i can turn the music down so the first thing i want to do is i just want to kind of look at this for a second to figure out if i want to adjust anything um before i start to make multiple pendulums um and we can see this is uh the result of this code and i can see a couple things i want to do um this always bugs me i prefer to create an object with an x y rather than make a copy of a vector um so that i'm going to do angular velocity angular acceleration this is all fine let me just look here and say sketch um i think i can take out some of these comments just to like simplify this is i'm going to use some es6 magic p dot go that always has bothered me so first of all i also don't like i mean i can use a slightly shorter word like pendulum um and i also i used to make my examples and maybe i don't know why where um in this go function i call update and display so it's like one function to do all the steps but i've recently i prefer not to do that in my examples and i have found that i prefer to just actually explicitly call update and explicitly call uh display and i i've been calling those functions show also because i think display is a render is another good word but display i think is a key word in some parts of javascript um so let's make sure this still works what if i break oh i broke something no error it completely broke oh okay i remember uh so now i want this to be at uh width divided by two um and uh zero that's where the pendulum is there we go okay so in theory what i'm looking to do so actually the prompt that i give in the um so wasim akram let me answer this question asks will this go and abe says by the way that was a collaboration um with simon so one of the things that i have the capability to do is um in the members discord channel uh the messages there i can bring up on the screen so this is from abe who i mentioned that this was a collaboration with simon okay um so wasseem's question is a really good one will this coding challenge uh will this coding challenge be available as a separate video in the future so i don't i always it always bugged me how i had live streams that then got like edited and repurposed as separate videos and then during my live streams i started really thinking about the editing and i would stop and start and i just i don't know it felt something about it didn't feel like the way i wanted to do things and so i right now i've completely separated these things now that experience is still available because when i record a video that i know is going to be edited um um that those those are streamed for members so people can join and kind of like tune in but there's a lot of stopping and starting and me just like thinking and then i like to go for a walk and take a break and come back so um whereas the live streams now are just live streams they are what they are they have a start a middle and end they're a mess they're great they're terrible who knows uh they're archived in theory i would like to time code them and have good solid descriptions and eyes and all that kind of stuff so this will always be available but i'm no longer editing out stuff now i maybe i should go back to that other way i don't know so at least for right now that's what i'm trying um but uh to answer your what you might have been asking is the how to code a single pendulum i recorded a coding challenge of that which is currently being edited and hopefully will come out soon and it can't come out until i finish this piece of it that i want to include at the end so maybe i'll include a clip of me coding it or something so that people can understand how these things tie together but there you go um all right cube video people are saying they like the cube video i gotta return to that rubik's cube stuff i always do keep a ruby's cube nearby when all else fails i either can try to solve it or um read random numbers i wonder if there's there must be some uh rubik's cube documentaries on curiosity stream by the way i bet i should take a look for that um all right now so what i was saying is the prompt is actually to um if i can just zoom in here for a second is to fill uh pendulums across the top and across the sides and the bottom so let me um let me see if um let me see if i can just start with the top and and steinov is saying would be cool if you edit recording of live stream have some transition between clips yeah that's what i used to do but i also would love to have like highlight videos blooper videos but uh right now there's enough work for i mean the main video editor that i work with is matia um who um i i would be open to like having more content i don't know when i start my tick tock i'll make 60 second little clips for my videos to post on tik tok never gonna happen might happen next year i have a uh i have some plans for next year we'll see if they come into fruition all right let's just start with um making this an array just i'm gonna start this way uh and then oh well first of all so actually before i do that i just want to save this as exercise oop so i think um one of the exercise prompts is also just to make in the coding challenge i don't make it object oriented um so now um i want to duplicate it and say pendulum exercise um i'm going to say array by the way there's this wonderful video on youtube that i used to refer to which has like physical pendulums and somebody like using a board to like line them all up twisting the board and letting it go so they're all slightly offset from each other and it's quite beautiful um is my chat not scrolling here totally it's not scrolling there we go i fixed that okay um so let's see here i don't want to sit in front of the code so move this over a little bit let's change this to an array um and let's make let's let's let's make a variable called spacing how much am i going to space them out let me space them out by 20 pixels and then um i need to what happening to my mouth uh i need to say uh the total number of pendulums is the width of the canvas divided by the spacing and sometimes i want i might want to have one at the beginning and the end so this could actually be plus one and i should make sure that's an integer value plus one then i'm gonna say let i equal zero i is less than total i plus plus and then pendulums index i and then i need a separate x position for each one um and that x position should be i times the spacing and then i should just hear i can say four i'm sitting in an awkward way today let every pendulum of the pendulums uh update and show let's see what happens here there we go so this is what i was looking to do but i need to i want to make this more interesting uh visually visually uh dynamic so there's a few things one important thing here is i feel like whatever i do i want i mean color is maybe something i want to think about here but right now i'm just going to at a minimum give the pendulums alpha so that um and of course now you're probably thinking about a newton's cradle and having to bang into each other that's another that's another project for another time not what i'm doing today uh i think so it's bugging me how much little space i have um let's go to um let's let's space them out a bit more and also have them be not as tall um i think i should make this a square for what i'm trying to do so let's make it 600 by 600 okay so this is more along the lines of what i was expecting to see and want to see um i guess i i this happened by accident but the size of the pendulums must be 50. that's what i'm spreading spreading them out by r equals r so i should probably where do i create those pendulums it might make sense oh there are a hundred what if i say spacing here oh that's no that's the length that's not the size of the where is the size of oh ball radius is 48 it's arbitrary um it's actually called a bob let's call it bob r um let's um put that in there because i think i would like that to be rel something relative to the spacing right now great okay wonderful all right now i'm just curious here what is the first thing i should try in terms of having them should i give them all a slightly different phase should i give them all a slightly different like what's the best way to make this slightly more dynamic um so what are what are some of the the angle that they start on is pi divided by four so what if i were to give them a starting and yes thank you uh harvard natural sciences lecture demonstrations thank you let's see if i google it harvard natural sciences lecture demonstrations pendulum this is 100 um the video that i was looking for let's just watch this for a second oh they're different the heights are the lengths are different does this have sound can't tell if it has sound i don't hear it now i hear it of course now now this leads me to want to do this with a uh the pendulums all yeah okay oh boy oh i really want to make this uh wow that's that's cool so now now i'm sort of tempted to rethink the problem is my exercise prompt i probably shouldn't make the thing that i actually say in the video but i also kind of want to make this uh uh later on so let's let me go forward with what i was doing but i'm realizing here that actually something that might be interesting to try is actually just have their length be uh different so here i could say i times like you know 10 plus i times 10. like what would that do yeah that's basically i mean it's not maybe i should say you know 50 plus i times 20 just to like make it a bit i don't have the auto refresh on and is what i really want to see like many more of these and the damping is a bit of a problem right now because they're all coming to a stop so what if i if i just take that out completely that's pretty cool circular gradient on each circle to make them so steinov is having some great ideas in the chat about adding a gradient um so this is what i'm really hoping other people will do i'm going to leave this fair i might add some color to it just to make it pop a little bit more when it appears as an example but i think thinking about gradients and trails and how to visualize this um yeah put them in the same position that's exactly what i should do um distribute them vertically yeah so this was like a big this is interesting but obviously i'm totally now realizing that the way to make this more interesting is would be not more interesting but another way to think about this would be to have them all just right on top of each other and it's much more about this vertical spacing so um the vertical spacing is uh so i times spacing and the total is the height divided by spacing i don't need the plus one and i might say spacing plus i times spacing let's see if i get this if i remove the circles and flip them upside down i have a laser show i think i need some damping here i should just have it be incredibly subtle so like if i go back to this i think also this will make this much more interesting if the spacing is much less and uh i mean let's go all out with this people uh uh window with window height so whatever i do oh and then this needs to be width divided by two well this is a cool result i'm not sure what i expected um but i'm pretty happy with it i actually think i might want the damping to be even more now it's so exact it was kind of looking i like this idea by the way of thinking about like how i'm drawing this there's not really any reason necessarily to draw the circle um and um just to like add some color to it i'm very color i i always have trouble picking colors but i have this like coating train color palette so let's try adding some of those um i might have to record something to break into the video we can try doing that today and see if how that works um what was i trying to i'm in the wrong sketch um let's go here to the sketch let's set this to be the background but i'm going to give the background some alpha and then let's have the lines be should we try this like like like blue or this pink maybe um so let's go look at the pendulum lines and have them be this and let's just make the stroke weight one and now the question i think also becomes like what's the starting angle that i want like what happens if and maybe these colors are too similar here i don't know how well this comes through over the over youtube but um what if i by the way this is totally like a cozy coding live stream now if you don't know about aaron davey on twitch if you like what i'm doing here i feel like aaron davey does this all the time on twitch just sort of tries out weird stuff um what if i make the starting angle 90 degrees yeah and then i feel like this damping should actually be a bit more that's too much i think because you can see it's it's almost like a cloth or something let's give it another nine by the way it's crazy to think that i just started from this like this is the example and just with like adding an array basically i now have this what if you kept the circles and didn't draw the lines i do like this idea let's try that um okay keep the circles take out the lines let's give the circles also the same fil the same fill that is pretty crazy also like now i'm sort of thinking well i think maybe i want some i want like a little bit of a higher contrast in the color just to be able to sort of visually see what's going on so let's go back to the pendulum and use a different color there's also no reason why i couldn't make this uh like bigger just curious um and also um have the background alpha be a bit more extreme it kind of has like a sonar ultrasound like quality to it for sure like a tree also has a tree like it's quality to it it also really feels like the circles are traveling like oh they're traveling down or traveling up but they're not they're individual ones going but it's a total illusion total illusion i'm sure those of you watching with a flair for design could think about all different ways to apply color and blending um to this flip it upside down and you get the wifi symbol i am interested to see like what happens when i flip this upside down um i guess that would be just a matter of maybe i should is gravity a variable somewhere here yeah so i'm going to take this out and make gravity a global variable this is an arbitrary constant by the way that really affects the behavior quite a bit like we could see like if i make this much high twice as high or if i make this very low wait i'm not noticing a difference i feel like this value should be playing a more significant role um yeah it is negative one times gravity that's weird did i do did i not hit like running oh yeah okay i must not have restarted so this is with a very very low gravity which is actually quite cool um it's more it's it's like oozy oozy wavy um well i really went off a little tangent here oh but what i was trying to do and let's go back to the sketch is if i do this and i make the gravity in the other direction well they're all falling up so now i just need to put their origin at the bottom so this is uh upside down amber says these would make a great screensaver yeah that's my i'm happy with that all right i think i just should stop i have other things that i wanted to do today i've already forgotten what was on my list um and i i should take oh kim perfect timing kim welcome to coding training membership with your membership you will get your very own random pop random number and here we go we're on page 247 of the million random digits book we're in row 12 330 and we are in column 51 and the random number is 51 525 thank you for joining so kim make sure that you uh link your discord and youtube accounts and you'll have access to some of the coding train member stuff in the discord um all right now what if you have four of these pointing in different directions from the center yeah i have to stop like the point of this here let me just save this and please go and make the stuff now and all of these can go on the coding challenge page when i publish it all your contributions so i'm gonna go i'm gonna just move back to here for a second because i don't know what i'm gonna open here in discord uh links um this is i am now posting um the code to discord so go go have fun play with this make something beautiful you know i love it especially when you um share it with me on twitter um there is a coding train uh codingtrain instagram that you can also tag um that's managed by psy um who's done a wonderful job kind of um building the community there so ah so this is perfect timing because it's two o'clock and i could take a break so one of the other things that i wanted to do today which uh you know admittedly may not be as exciting as this and just to just to like really um finish this off here let's make gravity 2.5 just curious if i go here to full and do this what we get wow um um what um um what i would like to do when i come back for my break is work on i have a bunch of sort of ongoing projects and i probably should uh i leave i have a bad habit of leaving things unfinished so i probably should go back to some of these other ones but i wanted to build a system where um we could have the discord bot keep track of people's random numbers because i am working on this is not one of them but these custom train whistles uh with a pattern that's generated from the that it's your random number so i'll come back and explain all of that first i am going to just take a moment um this will just take a few minutes to thank today's sponsor and i'm gonna play you a 30 second video from today's sponsor which uh is curiosity stream and hopefully if the sound is not on during this video please let me know in the chat so but i'm pretty sure it works from the founder of discovery channel comes a new independent streaming service curiosity stream home of groundbreaking documentaries and awardwinning original series follow your curiosity this is curiosity stream i'm back so um as you might have heard me talk about before i'm part of a group of educational creators that teamed up to build a platform where creators don't have to worry about demonetization or the youtube algorithm and it's called nebula and nebula i'm really excited to mention is partnering with curiosity stream so nebula here i have up here um here has a lot of wonderful um channels it's kind of like when i'm looking for something new to watch on youtube i'll often like sort of check out what's on nebula i think i could probably find coding trains somewhere on here um but there are one of the things there's a lot of fun stuff original content that's only available on nebula for example tom scott's money but you might be asking yourself like what does this have to do with curiosity stream so curiosity stream loves educational creators and supporting more educational content so nebula and the creators that involved that project worked out a deal so if you sign up for curiosity stream with that link not only do you get curiosity stream but you get nebula for free so it's a bundle um it's not a trial you're going to have nebula for free for as long as you are a curiosity stream member so and for a limited time curiosity stream is offering 26 off um its annual plan so that's less than 15 a year for both a year by the way i'm not saying 50 a month a year the entire year for both curiosity stream um and nebula so here i can just open up the curiosity stream website there are thousands of documentaries um oop i've got another member or something joining my lights are blinking um and uh oh look i'm gonna let's click on the sneak peek of the library you can see science history technology nature so i'm really partial to the nature one i was mentioning i was watching this moose documentary with my kids um and you know a lot of us are staying inside these days hopefully that's going to be changing more and more we can go into the real nature but you can watch some really amazing nature documentaries you might as well be soothed by daytona david atvero's voice watch chris hadfield um or just watch tom scott torture your favorite youtubers on nebula watch chris hasfield in this space station that is so click to the link above um to get both curiosity stream and nebula for 26 off it's a great way to support the coding train and educational content as a whole for 14.79 per year um right that's 26 off again that's for the entire year so if you're already a curiosity stream member i'd love to hear any recommendations of things that i should watch because i've really been enjoying um checking it out i think um dr hannah fry has a wonderful series about maths um on curiosity stream that i also i just like watched a little bit of and i'm excited to really um dive into that as well so um so yeah so i'm gonna take a short break um you know maybe you want to sign up right now i don't want to be so bold but i'll be back in about three or four minutes and i will continue with looking at some discord bot and database stuff do do do do do do do all right i am back thank you again to curiositystream check out curiositystream.com codingtrain okay um so what's up next i've got about 45 minutes or so and i think the timing is really quite perfect because if i'm not mistaken we just had two new members join so welcome to um ronnie and joseph thank you so much for boarding the coding train where we make strange yellow upside down pendulum patterns yes and for your membership you will receive your very own random number so rather than give you um ronnie and joseph your random number right now why don't we over engineer an elaborate software system to keep track of a random number for you in a very unnecessary way so um what am i going to do here let's go to the youtubes and see um this youtube channel called the coding train and maybe under playlists am i logged in i'm subscribed who am i i don't even know anymore um i'm looking for i think i'm just gonna my discord bot tutorial series so this is the most recent one welcome back to so this is uh my most recent discord bot tutorial i do intend to make some followup um videos um that continues showing other aspects i know working showing embeds and maybe is that the way to say it an embed because i embed something i'm going to embed this onto the web page i'm going to embed this nugget into my mind but if there is a if it's a noun if it's a thing like that's posted in discord it's not an embed it's an embed i think this is really what's important yeah that's kind of genius i wish i could share that more broadly just post a nice little meme about how i just moved from one old side project onto a new one but this one's really important because it has to do with something that i'm on a mission to do and you'll have to indulge me for a second because i don't know how many of you are new today and i'm i'm looking for something that i would have shown like quite a while ago ah here it is perfect um so um what this is and let me zoom in is a uh test run of it's not this train whistle but it is a blank wooden toy train yes this is what i'm talking about people with the coding train uh train etched into it and then on the other side will is a random walk pattern um where and actually i just have a i have a new idea now for the random walk pattern which i just realized nuno thank you so much mwah um for signing up for uh curiosity stream that's nice of you um so um the idea here is that every coding i would like everyone in the world who wants one to be able to have one of these i always say because i don't like this idea of the sort of like exclusive thing but you know i've got to start somewhere so right now everyone who joins at the conductor's level and eventually hopefully the passengers level we'll see if i can get to that um will receive their own custom etched coated train train whistle with a random number pattern generated from their own custom random number got it so so far i have done one one aspect of this which is that if i go to github.com codingtrain and this needs a lot of work by the way so your contributions to this are welcome as well but i think here under the random whistle uh repository um and then if i click over here we'll see it this is a you know i don't know if we'll pull if i don't want to pull this from the database or not but we have a few few tests sort of people in here so if i go to rnav for example puts the rnob's random number there i'm going to uncheck the download click the generate button you know no elegant and now this is arnhem's uh custom random walk pattern based on that random number i don't know maybe this isn't and i'm still working on the maybe i could see that i didn't i don't remember all the details of how i've got at some point i've got to like finalize how it's generated um so they'll start the same place also i'm just using the builtin um the random number generator built into p5 which actually i think is fine i might want to like put the random number generator in the code itself so we can know exactly what it's using or why am i even doing this this is completely insane this is what it has to be a new side project so um i think violet shared with me a link to the uh pdf of this book but i should be using the sequence of random numbers in this book what am i even thinking so i need to first get um so i'll find that we'll redo that i'm not gonna do that right now that would be much more fun because i gotta get this discord thing started um um and so yeah and stig that's a great suggestion for stig actually stig if you have some design ideas i know that's your one of your passions i welcome them and sort of helping figure out how to make this um work i'm also working on um uh um a a video about a selfavoiding walk i think i mentioned that let me just pull that up and and run it so that's like this and conceivably i could actually we could do the selfavoiding walk as the random walk um which you know creates more distinctive geometry i think i can make this more obvious by going to sketch and making the step size like 10. so this is a selfavoiding walk and when it gets stuck it just backtracks to try to go a different direction in theory if i let this run for a very long time it would uh find a path that hits every point on the entire grid um but you know the amount it's doing a brute force algorithm so i got to make a video about this i love this uh kind of pattern this um i i yeah so this could also be a different option for if this sort of visually is not as compelling let's just try it like some of these other ones like hunter parks see what we get right i like this one so this is what i was sort of more imagining that's like a fractal like brownian motion quality to it but but i what i need to be able to track this i need a system by which i can keep track of who the members are um what their um random number is and um their random number and maybe the discord bot itself should actually be like rendering this i don't know who knows um okay um oh and thank you um prathamesh uh highlighted a question from the youtube chat who does the illustration work for the channel so um those animations that you saw the interstitial animations those were made as a onetime thing and i am blanking on the person who made them so i can look that up and i can share that at discord later but the the source material of that is all from jason heglund and just to plug jason stuff for a moment because he really does amazing work and he's working on um um this video of the the train whistle is uh from his shop um out and we can see we were trying different patterns um also as well to see what they look like um but jason heglund if you're interested in learning more about jason um and i think um you can find his website here the coding train stuff is all here coding train expansion it's like another project of all these characters and everything you can find um here with all sorts of ideas but the thing that i was going to highlight for you is jason also has his own shop this i'm called hi hello there co um which has lots of really fun cool little like if you like the coding trade stuff you can get all these like really fun similar style kind of um shirts and shops and things so um wow this is really i haven't looked at this recently it's really really nice so um jason's amazing fred the ghost actually one of the one of my dreams is to make a little coding children's book and i think jason would be a great collaborator for that so if anybody has any ideas or contacts or anything like that um let me know all right let's see when am i gonna have time for that i don't know all right so oh this has been way too long of an explanation let's get to doing the discord bot so let me go to and um let's go to coding train choo choo bot choo choo tweets no discord bot choo choo think this is the current note no because this doesn't have the command handler all right let's go it's weird i i should have prepared this in advance strange uh let's go to the coding train learning uh discord bot by the way uh and now i'm really all in that's why i have a a project in the pipeline about redesigning the coding train website with the loss of the learning playlist on youtube i've given up and i'm just gonna like really try to build a separate website that really helps organize all of the videos and content and code so coming soon um more to come about that but the website that exists right now is amazing and it's been developed and designed by a variety of people that you would probably see here in the chat right now um but i have some ideas for some upgrades all right so what i'm looking for if i go to command handling and we go to view code so this is the code um from that's this is the code that i thought i had this i'm totally confused let's also go to glitch and now as i spend the remaining 40 minutes just finding the code that i was going to work with choo choo bot discord this is the actual bot oh i think i never updated it to use the new command handler code so let's do that dane this is very dangerous what i'm about to do right now but also all sorts of api keys i'm sure are going to be revealed so let me work on oh this is a little bit scary but let's try this uh thank you for indulging me and letting me do some like open source maintenance right now right this is the this is the repo that goes along with the videos and it does not have the latest code in it which is strange but do i have it on the desktop like in a folder called like discord bot choo choo tweets does anybody see it no let's all right let's just clone it we're gonna bring this repo down um i'm going to shut off so actually if somebody i don't know if kobe or david or anybody who's a mod in discord right now i guess i could do this myself but there's that bot testing channel if you could lock that channel down for a moment just make it only like admins or mods can post it um that would be good because i'm going to run some tests in there in a moment um and if nobody does that then i will do that um all right so now i have a what i'm actually going to turn off the bot in theory it'd be good if there was a better way to do this but they're just going to comment out the code right now this is my way of just saying the bot is deployed and running on glitch which also i need to make a video about how to deploy it all right so um the block now the bot is shut off uh david said done thank you um so now i am going to uh open this up in visual studio code so you know when uh whoops no let's actually go into the repo boy that pendulum stuff was fun wasn't it well we've got about 35 minutes here before i've gotta move on with my day so let's see how things go um so this is the discord bot code and this is dot env sample so if you haven't watched these tutorials um one of the things you need to do is have secret keys and tokens and codes to run your bot so i need to i'm going to save this as dot env so i'm going to have the real env file then i'm going to go over to discord and i'm going to click and copy the contents from this file into my local repo but i don't want you to see that so i'm moving over to here and i'm doing copy again it's not a coding train live stream i'm going to definitely going to show these to you by accident at some point but the fewer times i do that the better and now i copied i'm going back to dot env and i'm pasting um and um i am now closing that and going back to index.js okay so now i'm back in this file now here are my secret keys for this particular discord bot and i'm gonna try to run it right now ooh weird oh but this code is oh this is so weird this code doesn't match or maybe it does hold on i'm so confused this is like some really old code all right hold on let's also go back to glitch and grab this a little bit more recent why not i don't know what's going on i obviously haven't been keeping up with what i'm doing all right so now i've got the more slightly more recent code but i'm going to get even more recent code in a second then i need to go and do npm install to install the node dependencies and then let's try just running it okay now i'm going to go over to discord where's my discord and um i i'm gonna go here and then i'm going to go to the bot testing channel which is where it's okay i'm so troubled now so many channels i'll close this uh stage oh here it is spot testing okay uh choo choo hmm ah okay wait we got an error missing permissions what i like the little hearts popping in by the way well this i really meant to set this up before i started today missing permissions have i lost my mind and this is not the correct so hold on so let me quit this pretty sure this is the discord bot is this not do i have multiple glitch projects and this is like an old one that i found that's not actually running beep beep oh oh okay it was david's mistake my bad removed messages from the bot too okay phew should be fixed okay good good good good good all right all is right with the world um so let me let's try it again um and now i'm gonna go back to discord and i'm gonna try this again same issue tick tock tick tock let's see oh i'm not running the bot anymore so let's see maybe maybe i messed up oh there we go we're back we're back in business we're back we're back baby okay um all right so now then i can also say uh gif and we'll get a gif from uh the coding train and i can do things like gif um uh you know uh kitten and i will also get so that's these are the features that are in the discord bot so far i'm literally gonna get as far as like getting set up to add some code that are gonna be done with the live stream uh we'll see um all right so um now what do i want to do the next thing i want to do is go to the more recent code which is here and actually get the code that involves the command handler to work from there so i'm going to go here then i need to add um a folder called commands commands right is that what i do and then i'm just updating the code from what i actually did in the tutorial commands.js oh and then this is then i also need to make there's got to be a more efficient way for me to do this commands.js and a command's folder got it so now i'm going to make a file called commands.js not that needs to be out in the root directory move paste this code in then in here in commands itself i need choo choo dot js and uh what's the other one gif dot js right uh that's what the files i'm loading choo choo and gif and then you know i can go here and get the choo choo code which goes here and by the way all of this code is i you know i go through it in lots of detail in the video tutorials so i don't understand why where it went but obviously it was somewhere and here it is i'm just recreating it and now let's just see what happens if i quit and run it again and is it still working i'm lost i'm lost where do i go discord uh choo choo great and gif right all right so everything's still working um thank you code guppy and marianne i'm keeping it up appreciate it very kind of you um so now next step let's create a branch called command a handler i'm going to check out that branch and this is new code from the command handler tutorial and let's push this to the command handler branch and i realize some of the stuff that i'm doing is going to be very unfamiliar to people who are in the audience right now hopefully just sort of seeing this process is helpful to you um i uh my get github videos could really use a refresher um and now i'm just gonna say um updating the code i should write something more thoughtful but this is a note to myself i will just keep it short and sweet and you're all watching i'm going to create this pull request and this we can see everything that i changed here all of the new code and the changes um um i can merge this then i can just go back to uh main and grab the code merge code and now for my grand finale i'm gonna i'm going to go back to um glitch and i'm going to go to tools import and export import from github and just go to here and import from github paste this in here let's see what happens it's basically rebuilding the project with all the code from github so this is kind of an awkward way awkward highly manual way of deploying a project but it's actually kind of working fairly well for me um you can see there's some log messages where it's kind of booting up and installing node and all of that let's wait for this to finish so now the updated code is deployed to glitch uh oh ah i messed something up so i forgot that i need for it to work on glitch i need to have a start script so i think this would be start and it needs to be i would just say node index.js so i need to add that i'm going to skip a few details here and just do uh i'm gonna uh i'm gonna do something really awful but uh i can't help it i'm pushing domain everybody look away everybody look away i'm not actually doing this look away i'm not doing this okay uh then i should be able to go back to glitch go to tools uh import import from github and just say okay again by the way i have not this is the only way i've not been able to get it to work where i could just push to glitch from from terminal i should be able to but i just pushed to github and then i just manually hit import on glitch and now hopefully yes i think it is oh throw error cannot find module node fetch what have i like messed up here uh the dependencies are wrong that's so weird hold on so strange what what is going on okay i don't know why that wasn't in my package.json what did i do to like remove it adding node fetch everybody look away again look away turn off your computers avert your eyes hide under your desks oh my god oh this is terrible all right now go back to import again import from github by the way no no no no no no this is very bad i don't like seeing that big red message here don't don't don't do something bad to my bot i don't think you can see it i don't think the whole git url was uh available to anybody if it was somebody let me know could i use a github action to automatically export to glish when glitch when you push the main joseph i i hope so um so i you can do this with a lot of other like with heroku or amazon or netlify or versal um so i i should get better at these kind of deployment systems aha there we go beep beep with a little sparkly hearty thingy that means my bot is active and running on um high code guppy um is running on um is running on glitch 237 folks we're making progress here welcome to what act coding is actually like oh i'm gonna add a new feature to this piece of software i'm working on but first i need to spend about an hour just to remember how i got it to run in the first place and also realizing that i didn't update the code in this place and then i have to deploy and then i have to check this and i have to not reveal my secret api key on a live stream welcome to software engineering everyone so flowstriker is asking why should you push domain directly i'm sure some other folks probably can offer some helpful thoughts in the chat i would encourage you to do so i you know i think there are everything you know context is key here and um i think there are scenarios where um you know if this discord bot were being used by millions of people around the world and it was a collaboration that i was building with tens of other people or like lots of collaborators um i would want to have a system with checks and balances where you couldn't just automatically override the sort of main branch of a source code repo without running some tests without having a code review without deploying it to a test server so in those there are like that in that context um you know pushing directly to maine would be a huge problem so in my context of like um keyboard smashing talking on the internet weirdo person like making a bot that posts gifts to a uh to a discord server that i own i'm happy to like bend the rules here but um you know it's important also to try to like set up some good habits but you don't want those hat over engineer those habits that they block you from your you know creative exploration so it's a fine line where to find that balance i definitely lean towards the side of just like keyboard smashing and experimental coding and uh you know really release early release often kind of stuff in the sort of creative coding art and expression education context but i do want to be mindful of good practices and people who really um uh um i hear of the pitter patter of little feet which means i think that pear tart might be ready soon i'm gonna have to go very soon uh but eric is writing um um eric wrote in the chat the idea is to work on branches and commit only when you know it works um i seem to know it works before committing which is not the case is the pair tart ready all right i just need i was gonna finish at three which is 20 minutes from now is that acceptable yeah okay all right everybody start your countdown clock let's see if i get a little bit further here i love actually having a hard out and that my kids come and tell me to stop because as you know i tend to just stream for the whole day and uh it doesn't help nobody's happy in the after two hours um which language am i using to make this bot this is in javascript um with node.js okay so where was i i'm going to go back and comment this out and i want to add a new feature there's no way i'm going to get very far with this right now so let's at least add a command um and we'll i'll be working on this more outside of the live stream with some contributions and then maybe make a video about it but let me add a command so the way i do that is by creating a new file i'm going to call it a number.js maybe i should call that randomnumber i don't know let's just get the chuchu one as a good starting point um and so if this message comes in i'm just going to say um i'm going to reply back with god uh i see you um so i'm just going to i just want to make sure the new command works and then in the commands folder i need to add another variable called number where i import number.js and then that is also a command so that should be good then i just want to redeploy not redeploy sorry i just want to run the bot and test it so choo choo and number oops number i see you okay great excellent so now the question is should the discord bot oh there's a lot of shouting going on downstairs should should the discord bot um offer set the rent let's let's make it so that you can set the random number for yourself so um so just as a quick feature um just to add a little bit more here so the arguments come in um so console.log let's see all right so let's just again i'm gonna have to be more thoughtful about this let's just say if oh yeah let's just say if there's an argument or just um i'm just gonna use one argument so um if args is greater than args.length is greater than zero and args index zero um i need to do a regular expression real quick so um um i think i can do like backslash d plus test um one two three is true uh it's also true so it needs to be the full thing so this needs to be this regular expression i'm skipping around to kind of get going here uh there we go okay so this is my regular expression to check to make sure it's a digit and um if there is an argument and that argument is a num a valid number uh then uh we're gonna say i set your i set your number to args zero oh that doesn't go there otherwise i'm gonna say uh i need a number why i shouldn't have the bot be saying i oh my goodness muhammad is upgrading their membership thanks mohammed um i um i'm going to say number number set to please provide please provide a valid whole number so this is now what i want basically is to test to see did i get a number or not so let's uh rerun the bot what what kind of error happened there commands command is not a function oh it breaks if there's not a command that's interesting i should definitely need some error handling there and there's an error message i guess i need another parenthesis there so now i should be able to say uh number hello please provide a valid whole number number one two three four five numbers set to one two three four five awesome so you can see though this is good i've got a feature going here i wanted to do a so now i'm going to try to set up a mongodb oh well no chance i have time to do this um what's a good way to wrap up in the next 15 minutes well let's get started i'm gonna get started on it um now everyone tells me the last time i did something like this i was told i should be using mongoose but i have no idea what that is but i'm gonna look up mongodb atlas which i believe is um previously i've made video tutorials on how to do this with firebase um but recently i was playing around mongodb atlas and i kind of liked it which is their like cloud service now i think i might have already created an account with my so i'm just going to try to like i'm going to move off here and try to like log in with my account for a second oh password manager so hold on a second uh talk amongst yourselves the number of times i do this while i'm live streaming is insane i should really have this as like a favorite or something here we go show enlarge type somebody told me i should mute myself when i'm typing in my passwords because you could figure it out from audio all right back to being unmuted all right yeah oh right i've shown this because this is what i'm using for the other side project that i failed to keep going uh the forrest gump 500 project i really love some contributions and help with that because i feel like um um so but we'll see uh uh gjoe jijo says i think that if someone knows your password from the audio they 100 deserve it i kind of agree i also have two factors so what's it really going to do for you so i think what i need to create is um um uh solar liner is saying i'm just curious about this comment um you should talk about deploying with docker2 a dockercompose.yml file along with a simple server would solve all your deployment problems okay i'm interested in this tell me more tell me more about solving all of my deployment problems i don't really know very much about docker so that would be really helpful and awesome uh all right um so what i need to do here is create this is like the gump 500 database how do i make a new one create a new cluster no i'm in a cluster this is definitely a cluster what gum 500 how do i make what is gump 500 is that a like um if i go here project i want a new project right random what should i call this uh i'll just call it random numbers okay next um knock i will add some other people later maybe i'm the owner create the project then the idea here is that do i need to build a cluster i need a cluster okay or do i do database grade data lake what's a lake there's a lake with data in it do i click build does anybody know let's create the cluster ah oh no no no wait free free free yes yes yes for learning mongodb or small applications yes okay um i guess i don't need to do i need to do another one i'm so confused um aws i do have this looks good fine okay connect i got 10 minutes i think i actually could do this because to be honest i'm i'm um this is going to be skipping some steps but just to get a little further here if i go to the gump 500 project which is a twitter bot that i am working with mongodb is i kind of have the code for all of that here so i can just grab this code but let's um so okay so i think i need to now um i think i need to click on this connect button and this connect button is maybe going to give me some secret information um and so i'm gonna also switch over here this is why by the way recording video tutorial is as good of this stuff because then i could just like keep everything in but blur out or reset all the tokens afterwards but live streaming is typical difficult connect by the way i really have no idea what i'm doing here and this might be completely overkill but i've really been looking for a simple free database as a service cloud service um and in my experience i guess i'm still creating that cluster so unfortunately we're in this sort of like wait waiting so while we're waiting let's go um back to here and um in index let's require let's see hold on um let's go back to gump oh my cluster is complete of course this happens so now i'm going to click on this connect button but i'm taking you away because i don't know what's going to pop up no it still says it's what this is so weird didn't it just say it was finished now it's saying it's being created again this is so bizarre all right let me go back to here and go to here and i want to require mongodb so i know i need to add to my bot require mongodb i need to say npm install mongodb so i'm adding the mongodb javascript thingy the node package then uh inside in the to connect to the database i'm going to just connect catch i'm going to just add this exact code um which will oh it should really be in the numbers yeah i'm gonna you know what i'm gonna do well so tricky here right now i'm going to assume i'm going to do something to make the assumption that this mongodb is only for that number command so i'm going to take this out i'm going to put it in here and i think this kind of like to the database when it boots up thing will still happen if i put this just into the number file right so um so i could have made a new database i could have made a new database with a dif with the same cluster some i don't understand what the cluster is versus the database versus the collection i've got to figure that out but let's just um so i'm going to create a uh a numbers db and uh we'll call this numbers people i don't know uh numbers db i want to connect to um oh and there's uh i want to just connect to that database so let's see i just want to successfully connect to this database so back to the page that might have my hopefully my secret connection stuff yeah okay so first of all it's definitely live now it's connected now i'm really going to hit this button collections i didn't i don't understand can i use the same i'm so confused someone will explain this to me but let me just click connect okay allow access from anywhere set up security choose a connection method okay the first user will have keep credentials handy okay so i i can show this to you so i'm going to create a database user with allow access from anywhere which is probably a little bit scary to do and i'm going to make a user called coding train and then i am going to auto generate a secure password i assume it's going to let me regenerate one so i'm going to i'm going to click that a bunch of times then um i'm going to hit create database user keep your credentials handy let me let me try to save that password i'm saving that password in my env file right now and then i'm going to hide it so now i can go back and hit create database user choose a connection method connect your app so this is where i don't remember which one i pick i think it's connect your application oh javascript interface no i think it must be this one yes okay i shouldn't be showing this to you but at least i'm not showing you the use the password but i think even this like this cluster address i probably should be keeping secret but i'm going to copy this oh look at this and it gives me this is definitely right node.js i could actually get a full driver code example but i'm going to copy this and i'm going to put this into my env file i'll show you in a second so db um mongodb so i'm going to i just want to zoom where the the and put this off the screen so i what i'm going to do is in my dot env if i'm ready db and i'm putting this um url path oh i'm showing you my tenor key i didn't realize my other key was there good job everybody thank you thank you and good night thank you thank you thank you and that's the end of today's go we showed it's 2 58 pm i showed you one of my api keys and we're done uh the cluster is a server the server can have any amount of database the database can have any amount of collections so i should have done this a different way um you know have fun with my tenor key i'm gonna just reset that pretty soon so good luck move fast people i'm gonna do that right now um let's see tenor api key i mean i don't know what you could do with that uh sign in i'm resetting that api key really i don't even know where okay it's going to take me a while to find how i even logged into tenor in the first place so i think that api key just lets you get gifts so um you know all right uh the funny thing is i seriously am done the cluster is a virtual machine that runs the database so i should have done this right it's three o'clock so you know welcome to the new coding train where i just cut myself off at a certain time let me just talk about what my intention is to do next um and if anybody wants to help uh contribute i think i'm gonna make a branch so let me make a let me let me finish off by um making a branch with what i've done so far i'm just going to close the dot env file i'm going to here so i'm going to um here i'm going to go back to here i'm gonna do git branch a number db get check out number db um git add git commit um new code for random number db so now that branch i'll even make it like a draft i'll show you something that's that you can do so i can make this a draft pull request starting to work on a database of random numbers um this this is for the coding train custom random number whistle project and i should um i should link to this repo as well and then i think i can do this create draft pull request so this isn't done but the code you can find it if you want to look at what i've done so far by going to this pull request and i am going to add that back into discord under links um i'm gonna say goodbye so i will continue to work on this uh maybe i'll revisit it next week's live stream uh maybe i'll just do it on my own or you know some other contributors will add to it um just as a reminder um as i wrap up here um you know we did have some successes today by creating this sort of pretty interesting examples of this like whole collection of pendulums that are like upside down swinging back and forth i actually really think i want to leave this this it's lovely but i kind of really liked it with the lines so i actually am going to change it back to the lines so we can just remember what that looked like oh take out the circles um so we can see what that looks like with just the lines so if you just joined recently this is what i did earlier in today's live stream um if you make a version of this please share with me right now the best place be shared with me at twitter shiffman on twitter um i really want to encourage you hopefully the next one will be out later today or tomorrow but i really want to encourage you to follow along with the new nature of code video tutorials um add your uh community contributions here uh leimer daniel doesn't have to be the only person with community contributions add them here and um i really also want to remind you to um check out this syllabus that i'm actively working on that i really welcome suggestions and pull requests um here as well so i'm going to put on this goodbye song and just answer maybe one or two last questions from the chat and then i'll be saying goodbye and uh bot testing is reopened i think that i should reenable the glitch spot so let's oh it actually it's not running so let me put uh the coding train bot back on um do you speak oh no i'm just looking socket servers so people are talking about sockets and node um and i'm just checking out the chat there's not really too many questions there right now of course you're all a little bit behind so uh oh i didn't give the random numbers to our new members so who are those new members i'm scrolling up boy there's a lot of chat by the way thank you to marianne marianne marion and code guppy for all of your support it's very kind of you uh we've got um ronnie and joseph i didn't even read any random numbers today so um i'm ronnie your random number that i just this is cool that's the first three numbers of it or the first three digits of pi well not the first yeah i mean if you count the three as a digit um so from page 137 6 000 row 6825 your number is 31 413 right and then we could just set it in discord but can't do that yet so that might give people new rand what's one random number versus another now for joseph joseph oh this is kind of a cool random from page 27 row 1 325 88 890. that's your random number joseph thank you to joseph and i'm ronnie for joining um i'm checking out the chat which now i have scrolled up a sixpoint snowflake generator why don't you make a playlist of all your live streams so this is oh oh i feel kind of sad about this no so i just need to do that i really would like to have a nice solid playlist of all of my live streams well annotated and it's just a lot of work to maintain and do that so um if i can um you know get somebody from the coding train team to allocate some time to work on that or if somebody from the community wants to sort of volunteer to help with that that's definitely something i would like to do but it's i'm just like i fell so far behind and it's not something into my sort of weekly work practice of like going back to the live stream adding time codes adding a description linking to all the things i talked about but it would be so helpful for people to be able to go back and find things like even just that one little section about me coding the pendulum so i would love help for that um abhay writes you didn't see this one dan but i'm not sure what that's referring to a very auspicious number i would agree a very auspicious number all right everybody goodbye thank you again to uh curiositystream for uh sponsoring today's live stream and i will see you all hopefully next week stay tuned for all of the new nature of code videos that are coming whip to be released click the like and subscribe stuff don't you don't have to though you really don't have to i just thought it's a thing people say i'm looking for the song that i'm going to play there it is as always i always forget that this stop this stop it stop this stop i'm going to do this stop this stop i'm going to do this this stock this stock is stopped this never forget this dot song never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go sing it with me it's the forward coordinate song it's the forward new cartesian coordinate song autotune and the internet will fix that for me see it with me it's the polaroid song unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kids thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what i get i'm really losing my mind okay let's do it the kids the kittens kittens and kittens the kittens kittens the kittens i feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this is a this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it i'm really getting to something i need my sound effect what else is that was invalid syntax i forgot uh there was one other thing here that i think is important that i will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that i will use continuously over and over again first thing i need to do is yes kittens and kittens and kittens at dust medina you
