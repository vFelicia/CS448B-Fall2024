00:00 - hello welcome to session two of nature
00:03 - of code intelligence and learning so I
00:05 - am making this video in
00:07 - 2017 these are videos that go along with
00:09 - a course that I'm teaching at New York
00:11 - University ITP um this video is going to
00:14 - be very very short um and you're here in
00:16 - session two so the topic for session two
00:19 - is evolutionary algorithms so um this uh
00:22 - this there will be a link to this
00:24 - particular readme file on GitHub which
00:26 - has kind of a little outline of a lot of
00:28 - the topics some additional reading that
00:30 - you could do about the topic links to
00:31 - various examples but mostly if you're in
00:34 - this playlist if you're seeing this
00:35 - video this is part of session two
00:37 - intelligence learning playlist there's
00:38 - going to be a lot of videos about
00:41 - genetic algorithms that you can watch
00:43 - this is a long session um there'll be
00:45 - there it starts with about four or five
00:46 - videos that just explain the idea then I
00:49 - go through a kind of uh a scenario known
00:52 - as the Shakespeare monkey scenario I
00:55 - don't if that makes any sense to use a
00:56 - genetic algorithm to evolve a monkey
00:58 - that could type Shakespeare it's not
01:00 - really what happens but something like
01:01 - that and then I try to take a variety of
01:03 - other approaches looking at something
01:04 - called interactive selection where the
01:06 - user plays a role in The evolutionary
01:08 - algorithm by making Fitness selections
01:10 - of what the user likes or doesn't like
01:12 - or what that sort of thing um and then
01:14 - also I'm going to look at um an
01:16 - ecosystem kind of simulation where you
01:18 - just have a continuous system of Agents
01:20 - moving around the screen that try to um
01:23 - try to eat food or escape from a
01:24 - predator and that type of thing so
01:26 - there's a lot of videos watch them all
01:28 - don't watch them all but um uh would if
01:31 - you get to the end there will be a video
01:33 - that is gives you kind of an an exercise
01:35 - or assignment prompt so if you get to
01:37 - the end and watch that video and you
01:38 - make something you create something
01:40 - please share it with me shiffman on
01:42 - Twitter or um uh uh in the comments here
01:47 - there anywhere and I look forward to
01:49 - seeing what you make now normally in
01:50 - this introductory video I might sort of
01:52 - introduce the topic genetic algorithms
01:54 - but this video was really really short
01:56 - because the very first uh video in this
01:58 - particular playlist which which should
02:00 - come up next to you actually does that
02:02 - so genetic algorithm introduction so you
02:05 - can just walk right into that video I
02:07 - don't know if you walk into a video but
02:08 - you can go right to that next video
02:09 - where I'll actually talk about what a
02:11 - genetic algorithm is and how it can be
02:12 - applied okay thanks for watching this
02:14 - short video that I don't know if it ever
02:15 - will actually exist but I'm making it so
02:17 - maybe if you're watching it then it does
02:18 - exist okay see you
02:20 - [Music]
02:28 - soon

hello welcome to session two of nature of code intelligence and learning so I am making this video in 2017 these are videos that go along with a course that I'm teaching at New York University ITP um this video is going to be very very short um and you're here in session two so the topic for session two is evolutionary algorithms so um this uh this there will be a link to this particular readme file on GitHub which has kind of a little outline of a lot of the topics some additional reading that you could do about the topic links to various examples but mostly if you're in this playlist if you're seeing this video this is part of session two intelligence learning playlist there's going to be a lot of videos about genetic algorithms that you can watch this is a long session um there'll be there it starts with about four or five videos that just explain the idea then I go through a kind of uh a scenario known as the Shakespeare monkey scenario I don't if that makes any sense to use a genetic algorithm to evolve a monkey that could type Shakespeare it's not really what happens but something like that and then I try to take a variety of other approaches looking at something called interactive selection where the user plays a role in The evolutionary algorithm by making Fitness selections of what the user likes or doesn't like or what that sort of thing um and then also I'm going to look at um an ecosystem kind of simulation where you just have a continuous system of Agents moving around the screen that try to um try to eat food or escape from a predator and that type of thing so there's a lot of videos watch them all don't watch them all but um uh would if you get to the end there will be a video that is gives you kind of an an exercise or assignment prompt so if you get to the end and watch that video and you make something you create something please share it with me shiffman on Twitter or um uh uh in the comments here there anywhere and I look forward to seeing what you make now normally in this introductory video I might sort of introduce the topic genetic algorithms but this video was really really short because the very first uh video in this particular playlist which which should come up next to you actually does that so genetic algorithm introduction so you can just walk right into that video I don't know if you walk into a video but you can go right to that next video where I'll actually talk about what a genetic algorithm is and how it can be applied okay thanks for watching this short video that I don't know if it ever will actually exist but I'm making it so maybe if you're watching it then it does exist okay see you soon
