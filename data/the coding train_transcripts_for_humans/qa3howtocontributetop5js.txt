00:00 - hello and welcome to another Q&A uh
00:03 - creative coding video in this video I'm
00:05 - going to answer a question from Michelle
00:07 - Michelle writes on helping with P5
00:10 - development I'm still Beery but is there
00:12 - a way I can contribute to it I was
00:14 - thinking about contributing to the
00:15 - inline examples might be a way VIA this
00:17 - page and there's a link to a particular
00:19 - page that I'll show you in a minute or
00:20 - there's certain examples which might be
00:22 - a good one to keep in mind as a
00:23 - reference okay so you're asking the
00:25 - question let's say Michelle is asking a
00:28 - question I'm going to generalize the
00:29 - question a bit more I I like P5 I'm
00:31 - interested in it how can I contribute so
00:33 - the first thing I want to say is that um
00:36 - there is a wonderful set of video
00:38 - tutorials that are being created by
00:40 - Louisa Pereira um and they are called
00:43 - looking inside P5 and you can see
00:45 - there's part one and there's also a part
00:47 - two she also has both of these tutorials
00:49 - in Spanish so they're both in English
00:51 - and in Spanish now I would play it for
00:53 - you right now but you can go the links
00:54 - will be in this video's description and
00:56 - you can go and watch them on your own
00:58 - but what's wonderful about these video
00:59 - tutorials is they kind of explain to you
01:01 - this is let's say you want to contribute
01:03 - to p5js this is where you will land this
01:05 - is the GitHub repository page for p5js
01:09 - github.com processing p5js there's all
01:13 - this stuff there's a source folder and a
01:15 - lib folder and a doc folder in this
01:17 - build task and test how is this
01:19 - organized how does it all work Louisa
01:21 - does a wonderful job of going through
01:23 - all of these things in her tutorial
01:25 - videos so rather than do that here I'm
01:27 - going to refer you to those particular
01:29 - videos and what I'm going to do here is
01:30 - show you a bit about how you might other
01:33 - places and how you might sort of get
01:34 - involved so one thing is is is um the
01:38 - first thing that you can do is just kind
01:40 - of go and look at some of the wiki pages
01:43 - so here um you might look through
01:45 - there's some tutorials and different
01:47 - things but there one thing that I would
01:48 - look at here first is this development
01:50 - Wiki so this development Wiki uh gives
01:54 - you a nice kind of set of ideas and
01:57 - things about what you can do in order to
01:59 - get started started getting um
02:00 - contributing so you can look through the
02:02 - GitHub issues there's links to that here
02:05 - you could think about implementing a new
02:07 - feature there's lots of stuff here
02:09 - there's instructions of what you need to
02:11 - do to set up and download it some of
02:13 - this stuff might look a little bit
02:14 - intimidating or a little bit scary but
02:17 - p5js is a friendly and open place it
02:19 - doesn't matter what your skill level is
02:21 - we want you to contribute we want you to
02:22 - help so come and give it a try and see
02:25 - where you get stuck send me a tweet um
02:27 - post on the processing forums there's
02:29 - various plac where you can uh where you
02:31 - can get help I also have a bunch of
02:32 - video tutorials about GitHub that you
02:34 - could take a look at now uh Michelle had
02:36 - asked Michelle had pointed out this
02:39 - particular uh this particular wiki page
02:41 - which is called the development
02:42 - checklist and the development checklist
02:45 - is kind of a checklist oh I wish I had
02:46 - looked at this for my webg video earlier
02:49 - but you can sort of see here are a bunch
02:51 - of things that are kind of in progress
02:53 - or being developed that you can think
02:54 - about contributing to and one of the
02:57 - things that you can look at
03:00 - that she had noticed
03:03 - here okay I'm gonna find it more quickly
03:06 - is the uh uh
03:09 - inline uh inline exam okay wait hold on
03:13 - what am I looking at here sorry
03:15 - reference sketches sorry so these are
03:18 - sketches and things that are for the
03:20 - reference now you can see that some of
03:22 - them are not crossed out meaning they
03:24 - haven't been done yet ID class so let's
03:28 - look at how that works and I'll show you
03:29 - a little bit about how you might do this
03:32 - so oh these aren't links um so let's say
03:35 - you want to um create something for the
03:40 - um the ID function in P5 Dawn how would
03:43 - you do that so let's go and I'm going to
03:48 - show you actually I'm going to go to
03:49 - p5js I'm going to go here to source and
03:54 - actually I just realized this is all the
03:56 - source for all the stuff that's in the
03:58 - P5 JS Library itself and all gets
04:01 - compiled together into that big p5js
04:03 - library but the P5 Dom
04:06 - function the P5 Dom library is actually
04:08 - different and it's right here in lib
04:10 - Addam addons
04:12 - p5.js so you can see here is actually
04:15 - all of the source code for
04:18 - p5.js now I what I want to do is go back
04:21 - to that development
04:23 - checklist ah it's not showing
04:26 - up if I H there we go that's what I
04:28 - wanted it to show up and let's look back
04:32 - um under Dom and we can see that for
04:34 - example uh position is implemented so
04:38 - right here we can see that position is
04:39 - implemented so I'm going to look for the
04:41 - position
04:44 - function uh so I can see actually this
04:48 - is the source code for the position
04:51 - function in P5 Dom so what position does
04:53 - is it takes a Dom element and gives it
04:55 - an absolute position on the page I don't
04:58 - have my I'm not looking at my chat and
05:01 - I'm worried that something's not working
05:02 - okay so
05:04 - um now here is the source code for it
05:07 - but up here is a quick little example
05:10 - create a canvas and call canvas doos and
05:13 - look how this is formatted it's
05:15 - formatted at
05:16 - example with a div with code class
05:20 - equals no render because the code isn't
05:22 - rendered or maybe it should be rendered
05:23 - I don't know and then uh close code tag
05:27 - close div tag so I'm going to go here
05:29 - and just going to copy paste
05:32 - this so now what I'm going to do is I'm
05:35 - let's look for the ID function so I'm
05:38 - going to look for ID
05:40 - equals equals
05:46 - function I got to find
05:50 - it oh you know why it's not here Tricky
05:54 - Tricky
05:56 - Tricky back I couldn't find the function
05:59 - that I want to edit here in
06:01 - p5.js and actually what I didn't realize
06:04 - is the function ID is a function that
06:07 - assigns a specific ID to a Dom element
06:10 - and it's not actually in the
06:13 - p5.js function sorry add-on it because
06:16 - it comes with core P5 it's actually part
06:20 - of core P5 and for that I need to go to
06:24 - source and then um I'm looking for P5
06:28 - core p 5. element. JS and here it is so
06:32 - I want to look for ID equals whoops ID
06:36 - equals and now here's that function and
06:39 - you'll notice that function does not
06:41 - have an example so let's just do this
06:43 - right now we're going to live on YouTube
06:45 - on the air make an example and submit a
06:48 - poll
06:49 - request am I logged in well I'm logged
06:51 - in as shiffman that's going to be a bit
06:53 - of a problem uh that's fine uh so I'm
06:56 - going to hit
06:57 - edit cuz I have uh privileges to make
07:01 - changes so I have to make sure so now I
07:03 - want to look for ID
07:05 - equals and I'm going to go right here
07:08 - and I'm gonna paste that in ah I lost it
07:11 - so hold
07:12 - on I gotta I got to get back to uh lib
07:18 - add-ons P5
07:20 - D and I'm going to search for uh what
07:24 - was one that we liked uh
07:27 - position position
07:30 - here it is I got to get this example
07:33 - stuff right here I'm going to go back
07:36 - here and now I'm going to zoom in here
07:37 - so you can see what I'm doing I'm going
07:39 - to paste this in here o so I need to fix
07:42 - this so that the spacing is right you
07:44 - know I could be more thoughtful about
07:54 - this uh and then I need to make sure
07:57 - this is closed so now you can see I've
08:00 - added the code for an example but this
08:02 - is the code for the position so what I
08:04 - want to do is do make give it an
08:08 - ID and I'll make that ID my canvas and
08:12 - then what this does is uh I'll already
08:16 - assigns a CSS selector ID
08:21 - to the canvas
08:24 - element so I don't know if anybody so
08:27 - this is now adding a quick little
08:29 - example that shows you how you can use
08:31 - the ID function and then all oh there's
08:35 - German going on in the chat now um and
08:38 - then uh I'm going to go down to the
08:41 - bottom and I want to create a new branch
08:43 - and start a pull request so adding uh
08:47 - inline
08:49 - example for ID function and I'm going to
08:52 - write I'm Live on YouTube
08:55 - demonstrating how to make a poll request
08:58 - and add add an
09:00 - inline uh
09:03 - inline uh example so once I do that I'm
09:07 - going to click propose file
09:12 - change and there's some guidelines for
09:15 - contributing that I could click at and I
09:17 - want to see uh and I'm going to create
09:20 - this uh this you can see my change is
09:22 - just in this one P5 do element it adds
09:25 - just this code and I'm going to say
09:28 - create pull request
09:31 - and it's going to do some checks to make
09:32 - sure things are okay and we'll see on
09:35 - Thursday this Thursday's coding rainbow
09:38 - the uh there will be a mystery we will
09:41 - discover was this poll request merged or
09:43 - was it not merged stay tuned to be
09:46 - continued oh I need a sound effect for D
09:51 - D um is that uh okay I won't look for
09:55 - that right now okay so again I kind of
09:57 - went off in a little bit of tangent of
09:58 - showing you a very specific thing but
10:01 - basically what you uh the P5 as an
10:06 - environment is designed to be both
10:07 - something that beginners can use to
10:09 - learn to program and also can learn to
10:11 - contribute to an open source environment
10:13 - and the place to do that first is GitHub
10:16 - the problem with GitHub is it doesn't
10:17 - appear that friendly to you so I would
10:19 - encourage you to check out the wikis in
10:21 - the development page I would encourage
10:23 - you to tweet at P5 xjs on Twitter to
10:26 - post um on the processing forum uh
10:29 - forum. processing.org and you can go
10:32 - down to the um p5js
10:35 - uh and here p5js development questions
10:39 - if you post to there and are looking for
10:40 - help on how to contribute post there
10:42 - send me a tweet so I can look at your
10:43 - post and help answer it um as well as
10:46 - I'd recommend checking out Louisa's
10:47 - videos and also something you can just
10:50 - literally do to be a part of the the
10:52 - contributions is go to the issues page
10:55 - this is the issues page read through
10:57 - some of the issues scan through them if
10:59 - there's something that you think should
11:01 - be a feature something you're not sure
11:02 - about if it works correctly contribute
11:05 - write an issue file an issue do not
11:06 - worry about filing an issue correctly
11:09 - you incorrectly you cannot file it
11:11 - incorrectly the act of filing an issue
11:13 - is the act of filing it correctly and if
11:16 - there's ways if you need to close the
11:17 - issue and reopen a new one all of that
11:19 - is possible and fine so please come and
11:21 - join and contribute to p5js and um yes
11:25 - dramatic chipmunk that's the name of the
11:26 - sound effect I'm looking for um and Hope
11:29 - this video was somewhat useful about a
11:30 - little bit about how you can get started
11:32 - contributing to p5js thanks for watching

Cleaned transcript:

hello and welcome to another Q&A uh creative coding video in this video I'm going to answer a question from Michelle Michelle writes on helping with P5 development I'm still Beery but is there a way I can contribute to it I was thinking about contributing to the inline examples might be a way VIA this page and there's a link to a particular page that I'll show you in a minute or there's certain examples which might be a good one to keep in mind as a reference okay so you're asking the question let's say Michelle is asking a question I'm going to generalize the question a bit more I I like P5 I'm interested in it how can I contribute so the first thing I want to say is that um there is a wonderful set of video tutorials that are being created by Louisa Pereira um and they are called
