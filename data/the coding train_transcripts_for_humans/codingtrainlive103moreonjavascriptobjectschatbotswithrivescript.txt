00:01 - coating train Friday afternoon take two
00:06 - okay so let's see here um you guys hear
00:11 - me am I here am I not frozen is this
00:14 - actually the coding train how's my
00:19 - volume what better way to test my volume
00:22 - then reading some random numbers
00:39 - fifty-one thousand and seven eighty
00:43 - thousand seven hundred and thirty-four
00:47 - 7258 74 thousand seven hundred
00:51 - twenty-eight the volume sounds great now
00:54 - wonderful how's the balance between me
00:57 - and the music because it's Friday off
01:02 - the coding train and I'm talking into a
01:04 - microphone with music playing alright
01:21 - let us begin what are you watching just
01:25 - a strange corner of the internet it is
01:26 - true is what you are watching but my
01:29 - name is Dan Schiffman I am here every
01:30 - Friday and I have this like plan where
01:33 - maybe possibly I might also be here on
01:35 - other days of the week sometimes working
01:37 - on that
01:37 - stay tuned for 2018 which is another
01:40 - year after this year I also know from
01:43 - many of you that I've heard that the
01:45 - time that it is now which is
01:46 - approximately 3:45 Eastern Daylight Time
01:48 - it's the middle of a night for you or at
01:51 - least of the time that you're going to
01:52 - bed and I apologize for that I know that
01:54 - last week I did livestream in the
01:55 - morning my time which a lot of you
01:57 - enjoyed and some of you wasn't as
01:59 - convenient for so I will try to as much
02:01 - as I should probably actually set a
02:03 - specific time I will also try to vary
02:04 - the time using my handy random numbers
02:09 - all right I'm looking the balances fine
02:12 - the music could be louder I turned it
02:14 - down
02:15 - that's exciting to know all right so I
02:21 - am so this is the thing you would think
02:24 - that if only I had the time to like
02:28 - arrive here in this room in the morning
02:30 - and look through some stuff and makes
02:31 - them to-do lists and think about things
02:34 - and answer questions and make a plan
02:36 - that this would be an organized helpful
02:39 - useful livestream about learning to code
02:43 - unfortunately what happens to me is I'm
02:45 - like around doing this and this turning
02:48 - out to this email got on this thing on
02:49 - the table and then I just become this
02:51 - room then none of the equipment works
02:52 - and I'm trying to remember which button
02:54 - to press and I'm live streaming I
02:55 - realized like I have no idea no idea
02:57 - what my plan is but I have to keep
02:59 - talking because of that I said we'll be
03:00 - dead air but actually this is video so
03:07 - if I'm silent and I just move perhaps
03:11 - it's fine low music so I'm looking at
03:16 - the chat don't turn the music louder do
03:18 - you Dan do you like Lady gaga you know
03:22 - Lady Gaga I believe let me we shouldn't
03:23 - graduate particularly she was a student
03:25 - here at Tisch at one point maybe she's
03:26 - in the hallway
03:33 - this is a hallway fresh air comes in
03:38 - from the hallway there is sunlight
03:40 - through the windows in the hallway but
03:42 - instead I'll just close this door and be
03:46 - in this strange this is by the way a
03:48 - storage closet I am in a storage closet
03:50 - with some file cabinets where some
03:52 - cameras and desks and computer equipment
03:54 - have haphazardly been set up
03:56 - oh and I've got the glare thing again so
03:58 - let's see if I can just set this light
03:59 - let me move this light okay all right so
04:04 - here I obtained you guys is the light
04:05 - okay this looks it looks I look very
04:07 - dark I will start doing something at
04:09 - some point let me try to fix this light
04:12 - I feel like kind of like extra dark I
04:15 - should you know I should probably do
04:17 - this before I start live streaming right
04:20 - this is not going very well
04:22 - there we go it's a little bit better
04:25 - okay oh oh that's me over here okay now
04:28 - I'm coming back alright so I actually
04:31 - have some stuff that I want to cover
04:32 - today what do I want to do so last week
04:36 - I should do some like introductory like
04:38 - stuff about what this is but I mean I'll
04:40 - get to that in a second last week I
04:42 - started introducing the topic of
04:45 - object-oriented programming with classes
04:47 - in es6 javascript everybody was just
04:52 - waiting to hear about that's what they
04:55 - wanted to spend their day hearing about
04:56 - so I want to continue that I'm slowly
05:00 - making my way through many videos from
05:02 - my introduction to JavaScript
05:04 - programming course that used a previous
05:08 - style of creating objects using a
05:10 - constructor function and I'd like to
05:12 - redo all those videos so I'm gonna at
05:13 - least try to do two or three do two or
05:15 - three of those videos today so I'll try
05:16 - to get a little further with that and
05:18 - introduce arrays with objects I also
05:21 - have been teaching recently about chat
05:25 - BOTS so I have a little presentation
05:29 - that I meant to look at before I got
05:32 - here I want to talk about chat BOTS and
05:34 - program a simple chat bot using p5.js in
05:38 - the browser browser by chat bot I mean
05:40 - just like a computer program that talks
05:42 - to you with text
05:43 - and so that can mean so many different
05:46 - things there's so many different
05:47 - frameworks and I will get to that sort
05:49 - of stuff at some point I eventually whoa
05:55 - there's a little bit hold on a sec don't
05:58 - want to get water as you know on the
06:03 - Kotick train it's always important to
06:06 - stay hydrated
06:07 - however this water bottle which is
06:10 - producing a lot of condensation right
06:12 - now this is very near the electronic
06:14 - equipment so let me deal with that
06:22 - you're watching a person drinking water
06:24 - on the Internet that's what you're doing
06:25 - right now you realize that right there
06:36 - was a point oh yes this was gonna be a
06:38 - prop Alexa what's the weather today
06:46 - oh okay what hey Google is this thing on
06:58 - [Music]
07:00 - computer make me a vegan turkey sandwich
07:05 - it's not working so I think I have to
07:07 - get an actual Alexa or something like
07:09 - that up here I will try to do that
07:11 - there's a sort of a weird problem where
07:12 - the flexible connect to the NYU Wi-Fi so
07:16 - to figure that out I want to work on
07:17 - doing a coding challenge building an
07:19 - Alexa skill but before I get to that I
07:21 - want to try to use some just free and
07:22 - open source tools to make a chatbot and
07:25 - have computer talk to you with speech to
07:28 - text or text to speech wherever that
07:29 - thing is okay so that's on my list for
07:37 - today let's see what else this has been
07:45 - a rough week what are some things I went
07:48 - about oh whoa I'm so excited I got to
07:50 - talk about a couple things so first of
07:51 - all you are watching the coding train
07:53 - for more information about the coding
07:55 - drain you can
07:56 - to the coding train calm look at that
07:59 - look the coding trains currently live
08:04 - there I am I don't think he can hear
08:09 - that though so so things that you can do
08:15 - if you want to support the work that I'm
08:17 - doing is you can subscribe
08:19 - apparently YouTube likes it or they give
08:21 - you something they give you stuff when
08:22 - people subscribe to your channel like
08:26 - silver things to hang on your wall you
08:29 - can become a patron which is a way of a
08:32 - crowdfunding system to support the work
08:34 - that I'm doing and I am using those
08:35 - funds to hopefully make more videos and
08:38 - do more things in the future that's
08:40 - something you can do you could also help
08:44 - me figure out how to make this website
08:45 - nicer look at this this is kind of great
08:48 - I've done this stick before with the
08:50 - thing and live and the same time it's
08:52 - going back and forth please more volume
08:55 - so that's one thing I wanted to say now
08:59 - one of the things that I've discovered
09:01 - recently on the coding train is the Hat
09:05 - there's this whole community of people
09:07 - out there make watching and making stuff
09:09 - and me I am so me has come on board to
09:13 - help me manage some community projects
09:15 - where people could contribute code and
09:17 - apparently it's like hack tober fest I
09:20 - actually don't know what that is I
09:21 - should know what that is
09:22 - I guess that's run by a digital ocean
09:24 - and I think that if you do something
09:28 - where it's like at least four pull
09:30 - requests or something you can get a
09:32 - t-shirt so anyway I don't know if you're
09:34 - interested in participating in this hack
09:36 - Tober fest you could consider
09:38 - contributing to one of these community
09:39 - projects now community projects what are
09:41 - these I'm very excited to report that
09:43 - the coding train twelve O'Clock project
09:47 - which is a project inspired by hold on a
09:56 - sec I just google to find things because
09:58 - I'm so unprepared by John Maeda
10:01 - world-renowned artist extraordinaire
10:03 - John Midas 1990s work making these
10:08 - twelve
10:10 - clock designs this is an art piece
10:12 - that's in the permanent collection of
10:13 - MoMA and it only works on an OS 9
10:16 - machine so Golan Levin who teaches a
10:19 - class at carnegie mellon it would spy
10:21 - helped inspire this clock challenge put
10:24 - up this documentation of these animated
10:25 - gifts he got the the clocks to run on an
10:27 - old emulator and we here we roll we hear
10:34 - me or maybe somebody outside this idea
10:36 - who knows I thought let's see if we can
10:38 - recreate all these clocks in p5.js and I
10:41 - am pleased to report that if I go here
10:43 - and click on this URL I have all of
10:52 - these clocks ported to p5.js now me I am
10:55 - so me and many of the contributors have
10:58 - painstakingly looked at all sorts of
11:00 - details to really see if they're
11:01 - accurate but we could always do more of
11:03 - this this is an ongoing continuing
11:05 - project it's great that all these ports
11:06 - are here and I believe if I click on
11:08 - this we can see here a list of many of
11:12 - the contributors there all sorts of like
11:14 - interesting features that I don't know
11:17 - Oh Topher J and the chat is asking if
11:20 - the stream froze is it just Topher or a
11:25 - Topher's back but what now it's frozen
11:30 - for everybody although the game of life
11:31 - thing is still animating so I think I
11:33 - can click oh look at this
11:34 - I can click on it I get a big I don't
11:36 - even know I could do this I mean I am so
11:38 - music genius and probably somebody else
11:40 - who actually added this feature I could
11:43 - see this clock closer up and we can see
11:45 - a link a referent a link to the github
11:50 - user who helped to port this clock and
11:52 - many of these clocks were ported by
11:53 - multiple users and you can see there
11:55 - even here in the list wow this is
11:57 - incredible this is like the greatest
11:58 - thing ever so this is the clock now
12:01 - community project number two clouds
12:08 - coding trained community clouds so I'm
12:11 - gonna go to this year now now this is
12:14 - actually a project for day processing
12:18 - org so processing Day is a community day
12:21 - to celebrate the community of processing
12:23 - that's happening on October 21st that's
12:28 - the two weeks from today Yanks
12:30 - well it's weeks from tomorrow in
12:32 - Cambridge Massachusetts I will be there
12:34 - I'm apparently gonna do some sort of
12:35 - like live coding Train episode I mean
12:37 - this is live but live in person where my
12:40 - legs will be seen for the very first
12:42 - time let's see if I can make that happen
12:44 - now oh this is gonna if I get injured so
12:49 - then it was nice it was nice getting
12:52 - this like month of live streams there we
12:55 - go okay so I will be there with my legs
12:59 - and on October 21st and so one of the
13:06 - ideas for this conference and the thing
13:08 - that I'm going to do for the live code
13:09 - and train up sewed is making a cloud
13:10 - design but the idea for the name tags
13:13 - and I think this came from Tim choy and
13:15 - other organizers of the event is to have
13:19 - each nametag have the name inside of an
13:21 - algorithmic cloud so this website shows
13:25 - all of these clouds and I think maybe
13:27 - there's a way I can just with the arrow
13:29 - keys I don't know if that feature has
13:30 - been added yet is it like every once in
13:34 - a while changing the cloud oh if I click
13:43 - it just goes to a new cloud so we can
13:45 - see all these different cloud designs oh
13:47 - look at that beautiful and so you still
13:50 - have some time to submit a cloud and
13:52 - your design will be on a nametag at the
13:55 - processing Community Day event so if you
13:59 - want to learn more about how to submit a
14:01 - cloud go to the github repository there
14:03 - are some instructions there just file an
14:04 - issue I will say however that the
14:06 - deadline I mean this is an ongoing
14:08 - project I hope these clouds will live on
14:11 - forever and maybe be reused again
14:13 - another time for a different purpose but
14:15 - were probably going to print the actual
14:16 - name tags early next week you know
14:18 - Monday or Tuesday so let's just
14:19 - arbitrarily say that Monday morning
14:21 - October 9th is the deadline Monday
14:26 - morning Eastern Time like 9:00 a.m. is
14:28 - the deadline to submit your cloud if you
14:30 - want to make sure that it's has a chance
14:32 - to be printed and maybe will be a little
14:34 - late looks up
14:34 - relate but that's what I'll guarantee
14:36 - for right now okay so now loyal viewer
14:42 - of the coding train
14:44 - Simon Tiger who lives in Europe who is
14:48 - seven years old mind you has created a
14:53 - community project as well called
14:55 - procedural designs now I'm trying to
14:57 - figure out where am I gonna find this
15:00 - we're I'm gonna find Simon's URL hold on
15:04 - let's go let's try github.com slash
15:07 - Simon Tiger what's the chance that
15:09 - that's right no I'm gonna have to look
15:13 - this up somebody in the looking old
15:23 - music Simon Tiger interesting so am I in
15:50 - the right place
15:51 - github calm slash Simon Tiger /
15:55 - procedural - designs dunt dunt uh is it
16:00 - like Simon - Tiger there we go
16:04 - Simon - Tiger so um you can come here to
16:08 - see and let's look at the site and the
16:09 - idea this is inspired I think if by
16:12 - community clouds and but it allows you
16:15 - to submit something that's animated so
16:18 - well as the clouds or static designs and
16:21 - I Simon writes here there will be a new
16:24 - theme every month the theme this month
16:26 - the four elements water air fire earth
16:28 - so this is not an official community
16:32 - project but it is a community project
16:34 - that is created by Simon there's a loyal
16:38 - viewer and if people can provide some
16:40 - nice feedback or try test it out for him
16:43 - that would be wonderful and I would be
16:45 - glad to help with that
16:46 - okay what else I've got ah okay now the
16:51 - other thing is I have done some coding
16:52 - challenges recently and I am just amazed
16:56 - by if I go to whoops
16:58 - hashtag twitter.com hashtag ten print
17:06 - can you guys hear that music I just
17:10 - played in the classroom next to me so
17:12 - I've mentioned this book many times ten
17:14 - print I just have like books turn about
17:16 - the floor apparently here and there have
17:19 - been so many wonderful variations of the
17:22 - ten print design I encourage you to
17:23 - check out the Twitter hashtag ten print
17:26 - and my 10 print coding challenge if you
17:29 - want to keep that going on Twitter and
17:32 - also the new hashtag Ike which I think I
17:36 - need to workshop this a little more for
17:38 - the most recent coding challenge about
17:40 - recursion if I go to hashtag recursive
17:42 - train you can see that we're starting to
17:45 - get some submissions here so here's some
17:47 - nice variations by fire fluid on Twitter
17:51 - of the recursive design stuff that I
17:54 - showed in a previous coding challenge
17:55 - these are some kind of interesting ones
17:57 - it looks like this is combining
17:58 - recursion and ten print which exactly
18:02 - what chaos once on Twitter says this is
18:04 - quite beautiful oh and look so this let
18:08 - me actually click on the open processing
18:09 - link and there goes the camera which
18:11 - means I've been doing this for a half an
18:12 - hour this is called fractal oyd I think
18:21 - I'm not gonna oh this must respond to my
18:22 - microphone hello whoa this responds to
18:25 - sound oh oh here we go
18:30 - as always I always forget to this stop
18:33 - it stop it stop this dock
18:39 - awesome work and though this is a nice
18:43 - one I hadn't seen before by valu thick
18:48 - on Twitter and look at these I see some
18:50 - colorful ones coming up this is exciting
18:53 - look at these whoo I love this is
18:54 - beautiful
18:56 - love the choice of color and the
18:58 - variation of the circles so and nothing
19:01 - like a rainbow sierpinski triangle to
19:03 - bring joy to wednesday wonder if oh this
19:06 - is kind of crazy look at this so there's
19:08 - so many wonderful recursive designs that
19:10 - you can find on Twitter you can also I
19:12 - don't know if people have been doing
19:13 - this actually I haven't been keeping
19:14 - good track but if I go to coding train
19:19 - the code repository for the coding
19:22 - challenges and go all the way to the
19:23 - bottom and look at recursive design
19:27 - recursion there are none yet here so you
19:30 - can also pull requests and add links to
19:32 - your variations of the recursive design
19:35 - coding challenge I think this ends the
19:40 - introductory portion of today's Friday's
19:43 - coding train and so with that I am ready
19:46 - to actually start doing some coding but
19:48 - I will take a minute there's a little
19:50 - black mark on okay hold on there's a
19:53 - little black mark on the green screen if
19:56 - you go to a white page on your computer
19:58 - you will see it around the top right
20:00 - might be nice to fix it okay let's see
20:02 - so let me investigate this hold music
20:05 - please
20:07 - [Music]
20:09 - oh yeah look it's right there I see it
20:17 - wait over here
20:20 - what is that this it's not a black mark
20:25 - it is a cable a cable connecting a
20:30 - camera so let's see how do I get this
20:37 - out of the way is it this cable it's
20:38 - this cable it's actually this cable so I
20:45 - [Music]
20:57 - have my tricep muscles have fairly rich
21:00 - Burton
21:01 - hopefully my physical excellently there
21:06 - we go this is a good physical therapy
21:14 - live on the floating train a physical
21:17 - therapist I like erasing the whiteboard
21:19 - just good physical therapy cable tape
21:27 - problem resolved all right I feel like I
21:35 - look dark but maybe it's just if I come
21:36 - over here I'm out of the light over here
21:38 - so that's because I turned this light
21:40 - because of the glare issue lemme just
21:42 - see here how how much can I turn it more
21:46 - this way that's not so bad let's do that
21:48 - that's not such bad glare okay all right
21:51 - so I I am how what is it this is like
21:56 - don't tell me it's for oh my god it's
21:58 - four o'clock already it's okay
22:00 - what's the score of Red Sox versus
22:02 - Astros anybody no I'm not gonna watch
22:04 - that game later so I'm happy to be told
22:06 - in the chat baseball fans anybody okay
22:12 - five o'clock Yankees play Cleveland okay
22:22 - now I will take a minute to answer a few
22:27 - questions one of which I already know
22:29 - what it is is hey hey you coding train
22:36 - you had this video series about machine
22:39 - learning what happened to it so let me
22:43 - talk about that for a little bit and
22:44 - actually I think I might edit take this
22:48 - portion and edit it out to make a quick
22:52 - video because every time I produce a
22:54 - video now at least five of the comments
22:57 - are why aren't you making your machine
22:59 - learning videos that's what I'm here for
23:01 - and probably actually I'm projecting
23:03 - more likely the comment is like this you
23:14 - know just wondering I'm kind of
23:16 - interested in that machine learning
23:17 - stuff are you gonna get back to that so
23:20 - let me talk about that so where's my
23:25 - playlist do I have a playlist about
23:26 - machine learning by the way somebody
23:30 - asks why I was not subscribed to Suraj's
23:32 - channel when he was a guest here and it
23:35 - is because I am logged in on some like
23:38 - dummy
23:39 - count which is coding rainbow live at
23:41 - gmail.com don't email that address I'll
23:43 - never check it but why not have why not
23:49 - subscribe to YouTube channels also
23:51 - what's the one three blue brown what's
23:54 - that math channel that's awesome
23:57 - three blue brown Houston is winning four
24:02 - to one fifth inning three blue one brown
24:04 - okay so let me subscribe to that channel
24:08 - to 90,000 subscribers good work three
24:12 - blue brown uploads here we go
24:18 - would you guys mind if we just watch
24:20 - this video together would that be an
24:22 - appropriate use of this light stroking
24:24 - time probably not okay let me go to
24:27 - Suraj's channel and what's the
24:35 - interplanetary file system I have no
24:36 - idea what that is because I have to
24:37 - watch that later let me go to the coding
24:40 - training look how I just procrastinate
24:45 - for max doing any actual coding because
24:48 - I thought I was gonna answer their
24:49 - questions oh I see I'm not logged in as
24:51 - myself that's what's ultimately really
24:53 - confusing me
24:53 - here we go well have you thought I have
25:03 - you thought about exploring machine
25:04 - learning this is the class on udemy
25:08 - taught by an expert instructor you can
25:12 - make bro Busta models you should
25:15 - definitely consider that none of this
25:16 - nonsense here
25:17 - alright so okay so let me talk about
25:22 - this watching hello I'm here I am here
25:36 - mostly to apologize please stop don't
25:38 - throw the tomatoes the green wall will
25:41 - have Tomatoes flats on them but I'm here
25:43 - just to give a quick update about the my
25:45 - machine learning videos that I have a
25:46 - playlist called ten neuro networks - the
25:50 - nature of code I was making these videos
25:52 - over the summer
25:52 - then I had this moment where I was like
25:55 - riding along on a bicycle and I was
25:56 - thinking way too much about machine
25:58 - learning
25:58 - I had a bump fell over I broke my elbow
26:01 - I had surgery on it twice I lost a
26:04 - couple months of like being able to make
26:06 - content and then the fall started so
26:09 - unfortunately I was in the middle of
26:11 - this series I was at ten point seven I
26:14 - had made seven videos that's crazy
26:15 - and every time I upload a video now
26:18 - comments asking could I please continue
26:20 - that series and I am planning to
26:22 - continue it what I do here on the coding
26:25 - train is I make videos about stuff that
26:31 - I'm currently teaching at my full-time
26:34 - job here at New York University and
26:36 - currently what I'm teaching is an
26:37 - introduction to programming course and
26:39 - of course about text analysis so I am
26:42 - going to be making some videos about
26:44 - chatbots which is kind of adjacent to
26:46 - machine learning can be a tool to drive
26:49 - a chatbot I'm also gonna make some
26:51 - videos about hopefully long term short
26:54 - long short term I can't remember I don't
26:56 - have long or short term memory but some
26:58 - of these recurrent neural networks for
27:00 - text generation and then I my hope is
27:02 - that I will be coming back to this
27:04 - playlist again after this semester is
27:06 - over or towards the end of the semester
27:08 - if I finished up some of the content so
27:10 - in the meantime I hope to continue to
27:14 - have some github repositories where I'm
27:16 - gonna be making some new examples so
27:18 - stay in touch with me on Twitter and I
27:20 - would recommend to you well as you've
27:23 - seen as a guest on my channel Suraj has
27:25 - a channel about deep learning and also
27:27 - this is a new video that just came out
27:29 - from one of my favorite channels three
27:32 - blue one Brown but what is a neural
27:34 - network deep learning part one so now we
27:36 - have an internet competition will deep
27:39 - learning part to come out before ten
27:46 - point eight the answer is almost a
27:49 - definite yes so please write all of your
27:51 - complaints in the comments here I'm
27:52 - going to read them I'm going to sit with
27:55 - some sort of like meditative cucumber
27:58 - eye mask thing on and I'm going to
28:00 - listen to all of your feedback about why
28:02 - I should do this right now and
28:03 - the other stuff that I'm doing now and
28:04 - then I will feel guilty for a while and
28:07 - then eventually these videos will come
28:08 - out okay so thanks for watching this
28:10 - short little video explanation and I'll
28:14 - see you soon all right the sound is off
28:19 - everybody is telling me all sorts of
28:21 - technical stuff so that ad was super
28:26 - targeted right right it was like look
28:28 - you're gonna watch some crazy lunatics
28:30 - video about neural networks would you
28:33 - like to watch this absolutely sane
28:35 - you'd-you'd how do you say that you Demi
28:37 - you to me you to me I'm never gonna get
28:40 - them as a sponsor now and their ads
28:42 - gonna be removed from all my videos
28:43 - shortly I'm sure they're wonderful
28:45 - people over it you to me it's like
28:47 - Academy but you to me so it must be you
28:50 - to me so instead of it instead of
28:52 - Academy for the icons
28:54 - it's the udemy for the use you got it
28:56 - now alright um three blue brown you make
29:00 - some wonderful videos support three boob
29:02 - on support Siraj support oh look at this
29:05 - oh my goodness okay
29:12 - oh is the sound sticking off let's try
29:16 - so he's talking to me it sounds like the
29:19 - teachers in Charlie Brown won't long cuz
29:21 - just coming through the you know
29:23 - soundproof room
29:24 - I'm definitely to get to some coding
29:26 - soon swear swear I affirm I affirm I
29:29 - will get to some coding soon I
29:30 - remembered one other thing I wanted to
29:31 - mention I'm changing something here to
29:39 - do multi output device okay so now I
29:42 - think you can hear the audio and I'm
29:44 - going to go to SoundCloud so Christian
29:50 - Petersen or Christian Peterson I'm not
29:51 - sure if I'm pronouncing this correctly
29:53 - is keeping a playlist on soundcloud of
29:59 - coding train remixes best is where the
30:02 - biscuit song originally came from and
30:04 - there is another this song made by f
30:06 - looper the creator of the Perlin noise
30:08 - song which I play a lot and there's some
30:10 - other ones the loading song by Ike
30:12 - Bishop this is I haven't been able to
30:15 - add these to my
30:16 - on board yet so this is a new one called
30:23 - mini-me me so while I get ready to
30:33 - figure out what I'm gonna do I'm gonna
30:36 - play this song for you guys
30:43 - now a little contest here who can figure
30:46 - out which video this came from
30:47 - the fastest I don't know I don't have a
30:51 - prize for this contest but a shout-out
30:54 - will give a prize all right can you
31:01 - actually can you guys actually hear this
31:02 - oh that was the end of the song okay so
31:08 - let's put on the loading song I like
31:11 - that I'm just reading Twitter okay
31:18 - ah I'm getting ready to do some coding
31:37 - [Music]
31:41 - music okay thank you much
32:21 - maybe s can hear the people okay I got I
32:24 - got to turn this off I got a I got a
32:27 - start I've lost my the temperature in
32:31 - here is very wor okay all right so now
32:39 - what I want to do is talk about chatbots
32:44 - so this is this is I'm gonna do the
32:52 - object stuff but I sort of felt like if
32:55 - I did the object stuff that I would
32:58 - never get to the chatbot stuff that I
33:00 - want to do today so my goal is to so let
33:08 - me see here
33:10 - sorry I have to like plan this while I'm
33:12 - here with you guys so if I go to is
33:17 - there a programming with text one here
33:21 - no 15 so let's see here playlists I'm
33:29 - looking for my a-to-z playlists I really
33:38 - have to be logged into my own account
33:40 - all right I'll figure this out so this
33:42 - is gonna be a new this is going to be a
33:44 - new series of videos for the A to Z
33:48 - course it used to be called the A to Z
33:49 - it's called the A to Z course but I'm
33:51 - from YouTube I'm calling a program in
33:53 - with text because it's kind of an
33:54 - advanced course why don't you use a fan
33:56 - fan working here
33:58 - you think the client I think it's
34:00 - because I'm in a storage closet that
34:02 - there isn't really good climate control
34:03 - in this room so I have a little
34:05 - presentation that
34:07 - NACHA helped me with and so I mean this
34:12 - is a new experiment for me which is to
34:14 - actually like walk through some slides
34:15 - as if I like had a plan for what I was
34:18 - doing and talked a little bit about
34:20 - chatbots
34:20 - then I'm gonna do a tutorial about a
34:23 - chatbot framework called rive script and
34:27 - then I want to do a coding challenge or
34:29 - show you how to use this chat bot
34:31 - framework rive script which is open
34:33 - source with p5 GS and the brown
34:35 - this will lead me to eventually show you
34:38 - how to do speech to text in the browser
34:41 - so your chat bot could actually listen
34:43 - to what you're saying and talk back to
34:44 - you as if you were programming your own
34:46 - Alexa kind of our Google home type to a
34:49 - conversational interface from scratch
34:50 - we've only open-source tools and then I
34:54 - also want to explore using some not
34:57 - necessarily open-source tools like what
34:58 - does it does it need to make a skill for
35:00 - something like a product like the Amazon
35:02 - Alexa so I have materials for all of
35:04 - this already with my A to Z course I'll
35:07 - include links to that in whatever video
35:08 - descriptions I make and yes so this will
35:13 - this probably happen over the next
35:15 - couple weeks a little bit today a little
35:17 - bit next week so let's begin with that
35:19 - now I'm looking at the chat all right so
35:28 - hello welcome to the first video in a
35:31 - new section of my programming with text
35:34 - series so this kind of follows on the
35:36 - Twitter bot series because what I want
35:39 - to look at in this section is how to
35:41 - make a chat bot so now we can just think
35:43 - of that - this term bot in a much more
35:44 - general way I mean Twitter bot could be
35:46 - a chat bot chat bot could be a Twitter
35:48 - bot I don't know what's the difference
35:49 - so when I think about BOTS I am this is
35:53 - straight from Wikipedia but a chat bot
35:55 - this is what I'm talking about I want to
35:57 - think about ways that I can make a
35:59 - computer program which conducts a
36:02 - conversation via auditory or textual
36:03 - methods so this could be a one-sided
36:06 - conversation I could just be a Twitter
36:07 - bot that just says things every once in
36:09 - a while to nobody or to myself I could
36:11 - be two computers talking to each other I
36:13 - could be a computer and a human I could
36:16 - talk to my ok Expo what's the weather
36:21 - today oh shoot this thing does not
36:23 - actually how many electronics or
36:24 - speeches well but if I add like some
36:27 - sort of product from some company that
36:30 - I'm not gonna buzz market right now for
36:31 - free because he just sponsored me no not
36:33 - really I would show you that so I'm
36:35 - gonna get to all that sort of stuff in
36:36 - these videos series there's gonna be a
36:38 - lot of them this is just the first one
36:39 - so I want to think about where this
36:43 - topic comes from so of course many of
36:48 - you are probably
36:49 - familiar with Alan Turing and Alan
36:52 - Turing's question oh wait a second I'm
36:57 - sorry get the chat but you were looking
37:02 - at the chat I this is the thing I gotta
37:04 - stop I you know there's you shouldn't be
37:05 - stuff it's edited out ever but anyway
37:08 - okay oops
37:12 - I don't know it slides are coming next
37:14 - as I'm not prepared let's keep going
37:19 - Turing test is probably something that
37:21 - you you may be familiar with if not I'll
37:23 - include some links for further reading
37:25 - in this alright hold on
37:31 - pause I just ran what's the seminal
37:33 - paper called the Alan Turing paper it's
37:37 - called can machines think right where
37:41 - where the imitation game is proposed
37:49 - don't look at this machines think
37:57 - nobody's answered my question I do have
38:00 - a reddit AMA but I'm never gonna get
38:02 - through this if I'm gonna like try to
38:03 - like do some research like remember what
38:06 - the names of things are what's the paper
38:08 - called somebody's gonna tell me nobody's
38:19 - nobody's telling me this I'm just gonna
38:21 - keep going okay this is me reading
38:25 - Wikipedia backwards really fat is like
38:28 - it's entering my brain
38:39 - Papa thought yes I'm really looking at
38:42 - this in the wrong order the wrong order
38:54 - Computing Machinery and intelligence
38:56 - that's what I have here no wonder I just
38:58 - couldn't remember that thank you
39:10 - we're gonna get through this everybody
39:12 - you and me together so this idea of a
39:16 - chatbot of a computer that's having a
39:18 - conversation is nothing new we can we
39:20 - can date this research back to Alan
39:22 - Turing the seminal paper Computing
39:24 - Machinery and intelligence inspiration
39:26 - for the movie the the the imitation game
39:28 - can a computer think can a computer have
39:31 - a conversation much like a human being
39:32 - might have a conversation are their
39:35 - imaginable digital computers which would
39:37 - do well in the imitation game eliza is
39:40 - an example of a chatbot created about
39:42 - the MIT artificial intelligence library
39:44 - in 1966 it simulated a conversation
39:48 - using pattern matching and substitution
39:49 - so this is really a key key points here
39:52 - so what does it mean to program a
39:55 - chatbot what are some techniques and
39:57 - styles for doing that and you might be
39:58 - thinking I know deep learning neural
40:01 - networks super artificial intelligent
40:03 - magic computer machine thing but one way
40:05 - to develop a chatbot that's actually
40:07 - quite powerful and is the way that I'm
40:08 - gonna start with some simple examples is
40:10 - by doing simple pattern matching and
40:12 - substitution by that I mean I'm trying
40:14 - to match a pattern in something that the
40:16 - person the human being or the other side
40:18 - of the conversation is saying and I have
40:20 - a database of replies for different
40:22 - patterns that I might match so Eliza's a
40:26 - well-known a chatbot example perry is
40:30 - another one from 1972 created by Kenneth
40:32 - Colby at Stanford which attempted to
40:34 - simulate a person with paranoid
40:36 - schizophrenia so informally known as
40:38 - Eliza with attitude there is the lobe no
40:41 - prize which is an annual competition
40:43 - artificial intelligence that Awards a
40:45 - prize to the Chatterbox considered by
40:47 - the judges to be the most human-like you
40:49 - know I think it's
40:51 - you know one could be critical about
40:53 - this you know a little worried I'm gonna
41:02 - I'm gonna it's alright everything's
41:04 - gonna be fine but I keep going through
41:05 - this I'm standing in front of the slides
41:09 - is like I'm not really like meant for
41:11 - this but so I think one question about
41:15 - the Loebner prize is is this is is this
41:18 - really is this is evaluating a
41:20 - computer's abilities to trick a human
41:22 - being into thinking it's a human
41:23 - actually a appropriate metric or measure
41:27 - of some form of intelligence or ability
41:29 - to carry out a conversation or is it
41:30 - just a metric of being able to
41:32 - foolishness way of like you know the
41:35 - best trickery and is there what's the
41:38 - what's the substance behind that
41:39 - trickery so I think which is something a
41:41 - question to ask beyond just is it
41:42 - fooling me or not so Alice is a project
41:47 - from 1995 as inspired by Eliza part of
41:52 - out the Alice project is something
41:54 - called AI ml which is an artificial
41:56 - intelligence markup language similar to
41:59 - something like XML or JSON it's a format
42:01 - for creating a script in essence for
42:04 - chatbot alice is the inspiration for the
42:06 - Spike Jonze movie her and this is
42:11 - interesting because the reason why I
42:13 - bring this up is so this is what AI ml
42:17 - looks like and this is directly from the
42:19 - Alice bot org website so this is great
42:22 - but it can be a little bit unwieldy to
42:23 - work with so what I want to do is look
42:25 - at systems that work in this way with
42:28 - something called a retrieval model so
42:30 - this I want to say that most of this
42:32 - information is from this wonderful
42:34 - article which is from Wild ml calm deep
42:37 - learning for chat BOTS and part one so a
42:41 - retrieval model is a way of creating a
42:44 - chat bot where there are a set of
42:46 - predefined responses and you're doing
42:49 - this pattern matching so you're trying
42:51 - to figure out some kind of heuristic of
42:52 - heuristic as a fancy word for educated
42:54 - guess basically I'm trying to figure out
42:56 - like aha the user said something which
42:59 - slot does that fit in
43:01 - did the is the user saying like what's
43:02 - the weather or
43:04 - order a pizza or what is it does it
43:06 - match some type of pattern and I have
43:08 - some predefined responses for different
43:09 - patterns so now that's heuristic that
43:12 - way of making an educated guess could be
43:14 - a really advanced machine learning
43:17 - system with some kind of like neural
43:18 - network thing or it could just be like
43:20 - regular expressions and pattern matching
43:21 - or looking for exact phrases and so you
43:24 - there's a lot that you can do even with
43:25 - these basic ideas generative model is
43:29 - something I also want to look at which
43:30 - is a way we'll we'll use some type of
43:32 - algorithm a context-free grammar or a
43:34 - Markov chain a recurrent neural network
43:36 - some type of algorithm to generate the
43:38 - response as opposed to having these
43:39 - predefined set of responses this is very
43:42 - similar to how machine translation
43:44 - systems work something else to consider
43:46 - really is are you building a chatbot
43:50 - that's going to have a short
43:52 - conversation or a long conversation and
43:54 - my and certainly you could think of it's
43:56 - going to be much easier so an example of
43:58 - a short conversation is knock knock
44:01 - who's there
44:03 - chat bot chat bot who I'm making a video
44:10 - about chat BOTS that wasn't very funny
44:15 - so that's a short conversation and you
44:18 - could imagine that that's going to be a
44:20 - much easier thing to program in some
44:21 - long conversation that's going to I
44:23 - don't know talk about some you know
44:26 - Ionesco ZnO exit the play and what it
44:28 - means to you in your life or something
44:29 - like that so and by the way no exit was
44:33 - written by Sartre not ionesco this is
44:38 - really not going well I don't like this
44:40 - whole use a presentation thing
44:42 - I'm just trying it as an experiment I
44:43 - might not use this okay another thing to
44:46 - consider is open domain versus closed
44:48 - domain conversations you know are you
44:51 - creating a chat bot that the only thing
44:53 - the person will ever do with this chat
44:54 - bot is order a pizza and then you have
44:56 - kind of a framework to say well they
44:58 - might say large or small or medium they
45:00 - might say you know broccoli is broccoli
45:03 - appropriate topping for pizza I don't
45:04 - really eat pizza whatever they you know
45:06 - there's a closed domain of possible
45:08 - things that could be discussed as
45:09 - opposed to open-ended conversation that
45:11 - could be just about anything so this is
45:14 - certainly a much easier thing I think
45:16 - for you to work with in programs
45:17 - what I want to kind of focus on right
45:19 - now in these tutorials are short closed
45:22 - domain conversations that I think is a
45:24 - good place to start with building a
45:25 - chatbot oh yeah deep learning has
45:28 - something to do with this there's some
45:30 - interesting things that we could play
45:31 - with if you're looking at training data
45:33 - to sort of look at if you're going to
45:35 - use a generative model or a machine
45:36 - learning based model there's the
45:38 - internet movie script database which has
45:39 - like tons of movie scripts which are
45:41 - essentially big scripts of dialogue many
45:44 - of them and there's the boo to dialogue
45:47 - corpus which is a large data set from
45:49 - chat rooms that's open source that you
45:52 - can look at with these links and there's
45:54 - some wonderful and interesting projects
45:56 - and papers that I will include trained
45:59 - on friends episodes and all sorts of
46:03 - interesting things so there are some
46:05 - frameworks that you can look at that I
46:06 - would recommend that people tell me are
46:09 - interesting here's a list of some of
46:10 - them but what I want to use in my
46:12 - starting tutorials it's something called
46:14 - Drive scripts so rie script is fertile
46:16 - it's open source I'm pretty sure it's
46:17 - MIT license I will check that I'll have
46:19 - to correct this if it's not it's a
46:21 - simple scripting language for chat BOTS
46:22 - with a friendly easy to learn syntax
46:24 - this is all from write script comm and
46:26 - it's you you can it has just really a
46:28 - handful of simple rules that you can
46:30 - combine and recombine it with some
46:32 - powerful results to create a personality
46:35 - so this is where I'm gonna start I'm
46:36 - gonna look at a variety of techniques
46:39 - for creating chat BOTS I'm maybe even do
46:41 - some coding challenges to try to make
46:43 - some specific chat BOTS and I hope that
46:45 - you will make some interesting chat bots
46:46 - with me now you might be asking oh I
46:47 - want to make something for Facebook or
46:50 - discord or I don't know snapchat can you
46:53 - make a bot for snapchat probably not you
46:56 - might be wondering about this so I'm
46:57 - gonna stay pretty platform agnostic for
47:00 - at least the beginning and just look at
47:01 - systems and principles and you could
47:03 - plug in to other systems but at some
47:05 - point I will try to take a look just
47:06 - like I did with the Twitter bot series
47:07 - of some specific services that you might
47:10 - want to plug into where your thing that
47:12 - you're making has a conversation okay so
47:14 - I don't know if this video was useful or
47:15 - not but you just hear on the internet
47:17 - now and you have watched it and I will
47:20 - see you where I'll actually do some
47:21 - coding soon in the next video where I
47:23 - introduce Rhys script
47:27 - okay yeah pizza really is good I do like
47:31 - to eat pizza it's just you know I tried
47:36 - very I try to be very healthy eater not
47:38 - that pizza is unhealthy nothing
47:39 - unhealthy about pizza but you know if
47:41 - that's all anyway I don't know I'm
47:43 - talking about now okay
47:51 - right lactose intolerance that's really
47:55 - my problem cheese though is that really
47:57 - lactose I don't know it's one of your
48:02 - five a day oh yes it is
48:05 - okay the reason why I got a little
48:09 - paranoid there is that I'm very I like
48:13 - to be incredibly conscientious about
48:16 - crediting sources and this is some
48:22 - slides I made for a my class and I think
48:27 - a bit differently about things that I
48:28 - might show in a class if I'm quoting
48:30 - from something whereas I do versus
48:35 - things that I might show on this live
48:37 - stream so I got a little worried that
48:38 - like is you know did I not properly
48:41 - credit these so anyway so I'm gonna I'm
48:44 - gonna just sort of double check that but
48:47 - okay
48:49 - alright I'm having a little trouble
48:53 - today it's 4:30 what's the score of the
48:54 - Red Sox game now he's still waiting go
48:56 - Astros alright so let's see here
49:05 - it's so warm in here today I'm going to
49:09 - open this door for some fresh air for a
49:11 - second okay so here's rife script I
49:17 - should just start with the object stuff
49:18 - I feel unprepared for this tutorial is a
49:22 - really important this is a really
49:24 - excellent page and I had some notes I
49:28 - wrote down weird I
49:29 - them so what I'm gonna do is I am going
49:35 - to yeah I'm just scanning through this
49:43 - to remind myself about rice scripts okay
49:49 - all right okay
50:02 - so are you guys ready for this we are
50:04 - going to actually we are actually going
50:09 - to thank you Chris virgin four to one in
50:11 - the six inning
50:11 - okay we are actually going to do some
50:17 - stuff with rice crib now let me go to
50:18 - try it and I think rice script
50:24 - playground might work better yeah okay
50:31 - and all right okay and then what I need
50:37 - to do I think is probably dude this
50:40 - great and this okay here we go ready
50:45 - we're gonna make our first bot so this
50:50 - is going to be a quick tutorial of what
50:54 - is rice script and some of its features
50:57 - and it's bear with me for a second
51:06 - remember what these things are called
51:12 - write command symbol okay
51:19 - command symbol okay here we go everybody
51:26 - hello welcome to my first video beyond
51:29 - my introductory video about making chat
51:32 - BOTS and again I am using something
51:34 - called rive script and open source an
51:39 - open source library for chat BOTS a link
51:41 - to the github repository thank you to
51:44 - the creators and maintainer zuv rive
51:45 - scripts it's a wonderful project I've
51:47 - used it and a lot of things before I
51:49 - really enjoy using it so I'm gonna try
51:51 - to show you a bit about how it works I
51:53 - am not some sort of official
51:54 - representative of the rive script
51:56 - project I'm just a user and fan of write
51:58 - script so the idea oh boy
52:07 - the idea of Rive script is to is pattern
52:12 - matching is a is it it's basically a
52:14 - chatbot system that uses a technique
52:16 - called pattern matching and retrieval oh
52:18 - those are the right terms let me
52:20 - describe to you what I the user says
52:24 - something hello that goes into the chat
52:31 - box brain the brain does something so
52:37 - this is input and then gives a reply hi
52:45 - we could actually make a chat I know
52:48 - it's shocking I know we could program a
52:50 - chat bot that does this any time the
52:51 - user says ha hello and then that could
52:54 - be typed in or spoken in depending on
52:55 - what sort of what our interactive what
52:58 - our what medium we're we're kind of
52:59 - deploying this chat bot says hello and
53:03 - the reply which the word reply has an L
53:05 - in it guess we're wondering it says hi
53:08 - so rive script is the thing that i want
53:12 - to use here I want it to be the brain of
53:15 - the chat bot it's not the only option in
53:17 - the world for programming or creating a
53:19 - chat bot brain but it is one option I am
53:22 - going to start at least by using
53:24 - javascript and p5.js to take my input
53:27 - and display my reply so I'm gonna build
53:29 - a simple chat bot that just runs in the
53:30 - browser programmed with JavaScript in
53:32 - the p5 just library but I'm gonna have
53:34 - its brain driven by RIE script and this
53:36 - brain uses a technique called pattern
53:40 - matching so ultimately there are so many
53:44 - different kinds of things we could put
53:45 - into this brain that are super
53:46 - sophisticated but one thing I could
53:48 - actually do is just say did the users
53:50 - say exactly this word hello or did it
53:53 - say the word hello or hi or howdy can I
53:56 - match one of these possible phrases that
53:59 - the user said and if it said one of
54:01 - these possible phrases that I'm gonna
54:02 - say this exact reply this is the idea of
54:06 - Rive script and so every rive script is
54:10 - really just a markup syntax for
54:12 - configuring different sorts of expected
54:15 - patterns much like a regular expression
54:17 - if you look at my regular
54:18 - tutorials that you might expect the user
54:20 - to say and the replies that should come
54:23 - with those patterns so every so the way
54:26 - arrives and Rui script is modeled off of
54:28 - something called a I M L artificial
54:35 - intelligence markup language which is an
54:36 - XML like tag based markup thing that is
54:40 - interesting you could also use but rive
54:42 - script has a bit of a simpler syntax so
54:44 - in ryf script every single was just a
54:47 - text file every single line in the text
54:50 - file begins with a command symbol so
54:53 - some possible command symbols are an
54:56 - exclamation point plus minus and pound
55:00 - or hash tag so this is just wait timeout
55:03 - how am i doing with the whiteboard today
55:06 - it's the white boy look you can see it
55:08 - everything seems fine there's like a gif
55:12 - of okay sorry okay that looks good what
55:25 - I was saying so for example this chat
55:29 - bot that I want to program would look
55:30 - like this hello hi which means the plus
55:40 - means this is the pattern I want to
55:42 - match as the input and the reply that I
55:46 - want to give to that input is the - this
55:48 - is the reply now one thing I could do is
55:51 - I could have two possible replies so the
55:55 - first thing i can do in rai script is
55:56 - configure an input that i'm looking for
55:59 - and then give a set of possible replies
56:02 - and rive script will pick one of those
56:04 - randomly there actually isn't even a
56:06 - syntax for waiting these so I could say
56:08 - 90% of the time I want to say hi and 10%
56:12 - of the time I want to say howdy so you
56:14 - know that's a level of detail that I
56:15 - don't think I need right now for what
56:17 - I'm gonna try to demonstrate but that is
56:19 - possible so you might be asking the
56:20 - question okay if that's the basic idea
56:22 - well how do I learn what all the
56:25 - possible things I could put
56:27 - here are and and hopefully I'm going to
56:29 - show you some of them I don't actually
56:30 - really I don't have them memorized so
56:32 - I'm gonna have to like learn them and
56:33 - figure them out as I go a bit and and
56:37 - and and and how where do I learn that
56:40 - stuff so and and where can I test out so
56:43 - could I test out a brain configuration
56:46 - without having to write my own
56:47 - JavaScript code so yes yes yes all of
56:50 - the above just come over here with me oh
56:53 - look we're over here so this is the rive
56:57 - script website I find if you go to just
56:59 - rise script comm you'll come to the main
57:01 - web page but under here a slash Doc's
57:04 - tutorial this is a wonderful walkthrough
57:06 - of all the possible features and you can
57:09 - see here I'm going to skip some stuff
57:10 - here about you can say here here is the
57:13 - your first chat bot same thing that I've
57:15 - said exclamation point is a kind of
57:18 - command simple for like a configuration
57:21 - thing you can actually store variables
57:22 - and different things like that in the
57:23 - chat pod which I will get to so we want
57:25 - to be compatible with version 2.0 of
57:27 - Rive script and i want a plus to say
57:30 - hello bot and a minus to say i want to I
57:32 - want to look for the user saying hello
57:34 - bot and I want the bot say hello human
57:36 - so let's go and actually test this now
57:38 - there's something called the rice script
57:39 - playground and I'm gonna get rid of this
57:42 - part of it so here is that chat bot in
57:45 - the right script playground and I can
57:47 - say well I'm gonna say run so I can down
57:51 - here say hello bot and it says hello
57:56 - human and I'm going to say hi hi bot and
58:01 - it says error no match reply no no reply
58:04 - match so here's the first thing I want
58:06 - to do I would like to have something
58:08 - that's a catch-all of response for
58:10 - anything I don't know about let's add
58:12 - that pause point to the video we're
58:15 - gonna look up how to do that ah catch oh
58:23 - I think it's just a wild card catch all
58:25 - triggers just start yeah that's what I
58:26 - thought okay I was right I didn't have
58:27 - to look that up okay so just like in
58:31 - regular expressions where you have meta
58:33 - characters and literal characters and
58:36 - this is what I'm saying here is like I
58:38 - want to match exactly hello
58:40 - notice there's no capitalization here so
58:42 - capitalization and punctuation don't
58:44 - really play a role in the patterns that
58:46 - you're matching you're just looking for
58:47 - the raw text but I can have wildcards so
58:51 - I couldn't say something like Apple I
58:55 - love apples - or apples are delicious so
59:02 - now I'm using a wild card so Apple
59:04 - anything after Apple will give you one
59:07 - of these responses so now if I run it
59:10 - Apple you eats question mark apples are
59:14 - delicious Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple
59:17 - I love apples to see we even got one the
59:20 - different one the second time but if I
59:22 - say hello Apple error no reply matched
59:26 - so this is one way you can use a chat
59:28 - bot to kind of just realize that the
59:30 - users kind of brought up a certain topic
59:32 - so for example if you want to say
59:34 - anywhere the word Apple appears if the
59:37 - user says anything with Apple say like
59:40 - oh let's talk about apples and then I
59:44 - can also use a complete and total just
59:47 - one star as a wildcard to say like I
59:50 - prefer to discuss fruit so now I'm gonna
59:55 - run my chat bot and I'm going to say
59:58 - hello bot hello human and I'm gonna say
60:01 - I'm gonna say let's discuss pokemons and
60:06 - then rock group says I prefer to discuss
60:08 - fruit oh I love apples and oh no oh no
60:15 - what happened here so look at this oh I
60:18 - love apples ROG script is saying I
60:20 - prefer to discuss fruit am i still
60:22 - making a video about chat BOTS in this
60:24 - is actually like what I'm talking about
60:26 - oh boy hopefully this is okay here so I
60:29 - think what's going on here is I have
60:30 - Apple space star and maybe if I did
60:34 - Apple star like that then now I could
60:38 - say oh I love apples oh let's talk about
60:43 - apples so that space was actually
60:45 - matching their the Apple space star I
60:47 - needed to have I couldn't you I couldn't
60:49 - match apples okay anyway so you get
60:54 - the basic idea here this we could see
60:56 - here so this is very little like this is
60:58 - just like all I we've learned so far is
61:00 - I can match something exactly or I can
61:02 - match something with a wild card there
61:05 - are many more things that you can do I
61:08 - will not be able to show you all of them
61:10 - but I'm going to show you a couple more
61:11 - things pause for a second I need to
61:13 - drink some water and think about what
61:14 - I'm going to do next
61:15 - this is what happens right so my
61:16 - intention by the way for those of you
61:18 - watching this live stream the pizza
61:21 - actually so ordering pizza is actually a
61:23 - pretty good as an example that I see a
61:24 - lot on the internet for yes it's gonna
61:32 - make that pineapples or apples it's a
61:34 - very good point so I think it's my
61:39 - intention actually really was this
61:40 - morning to go through all this rice
61:42 - group stuff to prepare and I didn't do
61:45 - it so this is kind of a mess I think I
61:47 - think it's better if I usually I try to
61:49 - make videos after I've taught something
61:51 - in class and I usually didn't get to
61:52 - this in class so one thing I want to
61:54 - look at is variables open-ended tree
61:59 - these are all these are called triggers
62:00 - I forgot about that so I'll mention that
62:04 - I'm saying input but they're really
62:05 - called triggers oh yeah and that all
62:10 - right remember right okay okay
62:17 - so let's add a few more things to this
62:20 - chat bot now one thing that I would like
62:23 - to mention is that the the the these are
62:27 - the the plus elements without I've been
62:29 - calling inputs are actually called
62:30 - triggers so the term for that is trigger
62:31 - and you'll actually see in some modern
62:34 - chat bot systems this word called intent
62:37 - so we're trying to match the intention
62:39 - of the user
62:41 - what if which in what is their intention
62:42 - and what would i if what is it that they
62:45 - want to do and i need to reply
62:46 - accordingly so one thing that you we can
62:49 - do that's nice about these wildcards is
62:54 - we can also use what the person said in
62:56 - the wild-card in the reply so I can say
62:59 - what if the user says my name is star
63:02 - and I could say nice to meet you and
63:05 - then star so I can refer back to what
63:10 - they said by putting star in the these
63:12 - greater than Alessa so I can say my name
63:18 - is coding train now interestingly enough
63:21 - nice to meet you coding train and it
63:24 - didn't keep my capitalization and
63:26 - there's probably some way that I could
63:27 - configure that we could look through the
63:29 - documentation and that's a little bit
63:31 - weird that my name is coding train but
63:33 - so that's one thing you can do we can
63:34 - also have multiple stars so I could do
63:37 - something like my name is star star and
63:41 - then I could change that nice to meet
63:44 - you star I could be like really weird
63:48 - about this star 2 comma star 1 so like
63:51 - for example my name is Daniel she Mon
63:59 - nice to meet you Schiffman comma Daniel
64:02 - because this is a thought who likes to
64:04 - speak very formally so you can see here
64:06 - that you can match the different
64:08 - different stars in a particular order so
64:10 - again there is nothing going there's
64:13 - this is there's no type of learning or
64:15 - training I am configuring precise
64:19 - patterns for the bots to look for with
64:22 - certain replies
64:28 - okay I'm just looking at the chat and
64:33 - can we make the chap out return dynamit
64:36 - responses like if the user sends Bitcoin
64:38 - price them oh yeah okay so a question is
64:45 - coming up in the chat which is great
64:47 - which is like well what if you what if
64:48 - the user asks something about the
64:50 - weather and you wanted to say well the
64:52 - web the temperature today is blank so
64:54 - this would be some this is why I want to
64:56 - combine Drive script with JavaScript and
64:58 - I'm gonna do this in the next video but
65:00 - this is just essentially the script for
65:02 - the brain but there's no reason if I'm
65:04 - not if I'm using this brain in my own
65:05 - code that I couldn't also inject
65:07 - something like an API call so I will
65:10 - have you know there's not I could write
65:11 - my own program to do a lot if elseis if
65:14 - conditional statements and regular
65:15 - expressions that I don't need rive
65:17 - script before but riah script is a nice
65:19 - syntax for me able to configure a really
65:21 - elaborate set of possible possibilities
65:24 - and then I can combine that with coding
65:26 - to do something much more dynamic so
65:28 - that's really where I'm trying to go
65:29 - with this here so I want to look at a
65:31 - few more features in Rive script so
65:35 - substitutions is an important one let me
65:37 - look for that substitutions this is this
65:43 - can be edited out match yeah yeah I
65:46 - can't spell substitution yeah okay
65:55 - an important feature of Rive script is
65:58 - substitutions because you know you might
66:01 - have something where the the chat bot
66:05 - might say who is there not the chat bot
66:08 - do you the trigger you're looking for is
66:10 - who is there but the user might say
66:11 - who's there or who is there and so
66:13 - something you can do in Rive script is
66:15 - configure all these different
66:17 - substitutions meaning these are
66:19 - equivalent substitute I'm for I am
66:22 - substitute I'd for I would so you can
66:24 - put I m in your chat bot let's do this
66:28 - right here let's put this here I'm gonna
66:33 - add this as a substitution at the top
66:35 - and now I'm going to say I'm going to
66:41 - say I'm oh I'm just gonna change this to
66:46 - I'm oh I am sorry and now I'm gonna run
66:52 - this and I can say I am Dan Schiffman
66:56 - nice to meet you shift in comma Dan or
66:58 - I'm ship I'm Dan Schiffman same thing so
67:03 - now I have a substitution so this is a
67:05 - way that I can have this particular
67:07 - phrase and so one thing that you can
67:09 - actually do that will see is that you
67:11 - can have separate files that make up the
67:14 - brain so this thing that I'm talking
67:16 - about all these files can be a can have
67:21 - the dot rive extension and you could
67:23 - have many many many of these so you
67:25 - could have one file that just has a
67:27 - thousand substitutions in it and you
67:29 - could use that as part of the brain you
67:30 - could use that for multiple projects and
67:32 - and you could just carry that file along
67:33 - with you so once you've made one chatbot
67:36 - or you're using somebody else's chat bar
67:37 - you got an example chat bot you can
67:39 - divide things in different files to kind
67:40 - of keep organized and reuse stuff
67:44 - another key feature is variables so I
67:48 - think there's two more things that I
67:49 - want to talk about one is variables and
67:50 - one is sequencing so how do you do
67:52 - variables so I'm pretty sure that you
67:54 - can just do stuff like var var name
67:58 - equals computer and then I think
68:03 - nice to meet you star and and then so if
68:06 - the if the user says who are
68:08 - you you could say I am named I think
68:12 - this is how this works I'm actually kind
68:13 - of speculating I think you can set up a
68:15 - name and then you can say I am that name
68:19 - so let's see if that works
68:21 - who are you I am blank so that's not
68:25 - right so much for me just making up what
68:27 - rice group does let's look for it in the
68:29 - tutorial variables variables
68:34 - my name is hold on let's hold on
68:37 - Matthew I'm sorry to make you add at
68:39 - this let me so so that didn't work let
68:44 - me find it in the tutorial so hold on
68:46 - let me actually try to find it how do
68:49 - you set how do you said yeah var name
68:56 - equals tutorial and then and then where
69:04 - is it oh yeah this is good these are
69:10 - good all right you can do an or I'm
69:12 - gonna show this you can do optional you
69:18 - can do arrays all these things you can
69:20 - do but what I'm trying to do is how do
69:23 - you put a variable into the thing that's
69:35 - right knock knock is a great one it's an
69:39 - example here my name is set name set age
69:42 - get 8 you say get ah okay
69:52 - oops ah let me find that spot
70:04 - oops there's so many things sorry sorry
70:07 - everybody
70:07 - this is what happens when you don't
70:09 - prepare for class okay okay so I found
70:15 - this spot in the tutorial I apologize
70:17 - you have to if you want to display the
70:19 - value of variable you have to use get as
70:21 - well so what I missed here is I am get
70:25 - name so I'm gonna run this now and I'm
70:27 - gonna say who are you
70:29 - I am undefined how what did I get wrong
70:35 - okay Dwight what did I get wrong here
70:40 - set Nate I know you could say set me
70:44 - variables I just keep looking at the
70:49 - chat like someone's gonna like you I
70:52 - need I don't think I need it in quotes
70:53 - do I but I'm like scrolling like a crazy
70:58 - person here it's like scrolling up and
71:06 - down in this variables okay name yeah
71:14 - look at this huh why can't I just use
71:18 - okay oh by the way pound is not a
71:24 - comment it's slash slash I don't know I
71:26 - said pound how do I use the variable
71:32 - nice to meet you my name is Noah I know
71:37 - how to use set to set the variable know
71:43 - I can't believe someone just used the
71:46 - super chat keep it donation that's the
71:48 - most ridiculous thing ever that just
71:49 - happened thank you green person who
71:54 - currency is euros yeah come on come on
72:02 - come on come on what did I miss
72:07 - var name is it var name equals computer
72:11 - get name so I know I could well let's
72:21 - try putting I don't think putting this
72:22 - in quotes does anything who are yeah I
72:28 - have some examples why don't I go look
72:31 - at my examples so I have a chatbot
72:33 - workshop that I did boy this is really
72:45 - so let's look at this I should have
72:53 - looked at this first far name equals bot
72:57 - this means define that's what I put in
73:00 - my example and then I'm not using it
73:07 - here window
73:16 - botany really
73:27 - oh if it's not something I set it's
73:32 - actually this oh yeah
73:39 - all right thank you me I am so me
73:54 - so it appears that for the variables
73:57 - that you set up at the top you can
73:59 - actually retrieve their values not with
74:01 - get but with the keyword bot get is
74:04 - something that I'm going to show you in
74:05 - a minute that's four variables that
74:06 - you've set in a different way using set
74:08 - so maybe I'm missing a few important
74:10 - details here that I will try to get to
74:12 - but so what I need to do is if I want to
74:14 - retrieve that variable I use bot name so
74:16 - these are like kind of almost like fixed
74:19 - constants or settings for the particular
74:20 - bots so I can say now I can say who are
74:24 - are you and it can say I am computer the
74:28 - reason why this is useful is I could use
74:29 - bot name in all sorts of places in my
74:31 - chat bot and then I if I wanted to
74:33 - change its name later I could just
74:35 - change it at the top so it's a way of
74:36 - setting just like the reason why you
74:37 - might use variables and coding the same
74:40 - reason why you might use variables here
74:41 - now here's the interesting thing
74:42 - sometimes you might want to remember
74:44 - something the user says so for example
74:48 - let's say let's say what you what you
74:56 - though the user says my favorite
75:00 - favorite color is star now one thing I
75:04 - should mention is there ways of setting
75:06 - up specific options only that they're a
75:09 - valid like it has to be a number or it
75:11 - has to be a word or has to be one of
75:12 - these three words then you can have a
75:14 - different reply if it doesn't fit that
75:15 - that but but for right now I'm just
75:17 - gonna say my favorite color is anything
75:18 - and what I want to do is say oh I love
75:23 - and I can do set color equals star
75:26 - something like this too
75:29 - so this is this idea of in addition to
75:34 - displaying back what the user said I
75:37 - could store that in another variable now
75:39 - I might not have gotten this syntax
75:40 - exactly right let's go look at the
75:42 - tutorial so I'm gonna search for the
75:44 - part of the tutorial that's using set so
75:46 - yeah so set Nate
75:48 - set name equal star so actually what I
75:50 - should do is put this at the beginning
75:51 - and then I can say get if I want to
75:53 - actually use that and I could use that
75:54 - later too
75:55 - so for I did that wrong so let's do this
75:58 - was right set color equals star and then
76:02 - I could say oh I love get color
76:06 - - and let me give myself a bit more room
76:08 - here so that fits in one line I know I'm
76:11 - gonna be standing in front of it but we
76:14 - can see here okay so now what I could do
76:16 - is if the user says my favorite color is
76:21 - blue oh I love blue - but I haven't only
76:26 - spent sent something back to the user
76:28 - what I can actually say I am but who are
76:33 - you I am bought name and my favorite
76:36 - color is get color so this is a way now
76:40 - that the bot will always say back the
76:45 - same favorite color that the user has
76:47 - set so now we can say my favorite color
76:52 - is purple which is actually my favorite
76:54 - color and then I can say who are you I
76:56 - am a computer and my favorite color is
76:58 - purple so we can actually use stuff that
77:01 - the user is saying store that
77:02 - information and save it later so you
77:04 - could imagine if you're creating a pot
77:07 - to have a conversation over a period of
77:08 - time that's gonna remember stuff about
77:09 - the user this could be incredibly useful
77:13 - oh I'm sorry I need because it's a bot
77:18 - variable Thank You Simon tiger
77:21 - so the important thing here is the
77:24 - difference between bot variables which
77:26 - are the ones you set up at the top and
77:27 - other variables that you're setting
77:29 - during the conversation with set okay so
77:34 - there's a few other things I want to
77:35 - cover here let me look at my examples
77:37 - they're random multiple replies this is
77:41 - not so important so wild cards multiple
77:52 - things all right yeah oh yeah optionals
77:56 - is important so here oops
78:07 - so I have a set of examples that will
78:10 - include front links from this video that
78:12 - mostly pull from that tutorial I'm just
78:15 - gonna kind of show you those right now
78:16 - because we could spend forever like
78:17 - showing you each possible configuration
78:19 - but I think once you get the basic idea
78:21 - of how it works you can read through the
78:23 - documentation yourself and the key thing
78:25 - here that the key thing here that I want
78:36 - to demonstrate to you is the next step
78:38 - which is actually using this in your own
78:39 - program in JavaScript which is pretty
78:41 - exciting and interesting so this is some
78:43 - of an example that I have so I already
78:45 - talked to you about star which means
78:48 - match anything and you can you can say
78:51 - you could have different stars star one
78:52 - star two you can have a catch-all you
78:55 - can match only a number so if if the if
79:00 - it's not a number
79:01 - you could you could match you could you
79:03 - could say back like oh please give me a
79:05 - number
79:05 - you can match only A to Z characters you
79:08 - can have something optional like if the
79:10 - user says what is your phone number or
79:11 - what is your number optional anything is
79:15 - a nice way to match a topic so if so if
79:18 - the this is sort of us doing this
79:20 - earlier you can see if the user uses the
79:23 - word JavaScript anywhere can you teach
79:24 - me to program in JavaScript you can use
79:26 - in other so if the user says I love
79:29 - purple or I love pink you could say what
79:31 - about red so this is a lot of this
79:32 - you'll notice the syntax is very similar
79:34 - to regular expressions and you can also
79:36 - use an array so I was kind of mentioning
79:38 - this before right you can set up an
79:40 - array of different options and then you
79:43 - could say what if the user says to
79:45 - anything that matches anything from that
79:47 - array so there are so many Possible's
79:50 - possible configurations that's just a
79:53 - little bit I'm trying to think if I
79:55 - missed anything else that I wanted to
79:57 - show you in here learning I mentioned in
80:00 - terms of like saving information oh and
80:04 - you can also have conditionals so so
80:07 - this is really great so one thing let's
80:08 - try this actually so let's try to use I
80:11 - think the age is a good example
80:16 - where the bots think
80:18 - of a number and the user has to like
80:20 - guess the number so maybe actually
80:22 - that's what we'll do when I get to the
80:24 - JavaScript example so let's not worry
80:25 - too much about this right now you can
80:27 - see that if if the if the bot says and
80:31 - if the user sorry if the trigger is it's
80:33 - always very confusing I keep saying the
80:34 - wrong thing if the user says and my
80:36 - older than you if the users age that was
80:40 - set up here is greater than 10 say you
80:42 - are I am 10 if the users age is less
80:45 - than or equal to 10
80:47 - nope I am 10 so this is like saying that
80:48 - the bots age is 10 and incidentally I
80:51 - could make that a bot variable as well
80:54 - or a user set variable because maybe the
80:57 - user says how old the bot is I don't
80:59 - know so there's so many possibilities
81:00 - here I hope this gives you boy this is a
81:02 - really terribly disorganized
81:04 - introduction to Rive script I you know
81:06 - admittedly I was really figuring it out
81:08 - as I went I don't know write script that
81:09 - well but I kind of did this for myself
81:12 - to remind me how it is and what it does
81:13 - and now I want to take that next step
81:15 - and use rive script in a JavaScript
81:17 - program you could and you can use one of
81:20 - the things I love about writing scripts
81:21 - is it's open source it's MIT license and
81:23 - you can use it in a variety of
81:24 - programming languages I'm the user in
81:26 - JavaScript so I'll see you in the next
81:27 - video where I'm going to do that I saw
81:37 - somebody in the chat say something about
81:38 - this big boring yeah I feel a little
81:43 - like like I'm a little off my game today
81:45 - which I do I say every week but today
81:50 - [Music]
81:51 - okay yes rye script does support random
81:55 - numbers I think sort of
82:03 - boring boring boring okay so what I'm
82:06 - going to do now is hopefully gonna do
82:08 - something a little more interesting
82:11 - which is do I don't know whether this
82:15 - should be a coding challenge let's make
82:20 - this a coding challenge and have it be I
82:22 - mean the thing that I made already was a
82:23 - knock-knock joke thing oh it was
82:27 - sequencing I forgot to mention
82:28 - sequencing I'm not worried okay good
82:31 - thank you positive feedback cuz
82:35 - otherwise
82:35 - oh this cameras off it was gonna change
82:40 - to that otherwise I'm gonna be reduced
82:47 - to saying talking to you this way to
82:48 - make an s boring okay so she sees all
82:53 - right so let's I think I'm gonna do this
82:57 - as a coding challenge I'm going to
83:01 - generate it's five o'clock and then I'm
83:06 - going to so I'm not going to do the P 5
83:08 - speed stuff I'm going to try to do some
83:10 - more object videos today eight to one
83:18 - Astros Wow okay where am i I'm a desktop
83:27 - CD desktop p5 generate chat bot oh no no
83:32 - clear make directory chat bot o CD chat
83:39 - bot p5 generate - B how about a chat bot
83:48 - one okay so now Python I'm sorry Austin
83:54 - gives me tells me to learn to check out
83:56 - I I term - is that what it's called a
83:59 - really really really should do that but
84:01 - I'm just still just using simple HTTP
84:05 - server and localhost 8001
84:15 - minimize this open up atom and close
84:27 - this and go to I will get there
84:32 - eventually everybody chatbot I think
84:37 - this is lower than it usually is maybe
84:39 - it's not feel so much lower I mean
84:43 - that's too much table for you guys to
84:44 - see in the video
84:46 - okay chatbot one sketch a yes/no canvas
84:53 - and so one thing I want to do is that
85:01 - I'm going to just download the rive
85:03 - script JavaScript library in advance so
85:05 - that's not part of the actual video
85:07 - tutorial that I'll publish as part of
85:08 - this live stream so when I go to write
85:10 - script j/s and what I want is Oh No look
85:17 - I can just do it this way so I can
85:20 - always just link to it this way so I'm
85:21 - gonna do that
85:29 - so that will be there and there we go
85:41 - and okay alright how's the font size
85:47 - everybody font size okay I think feel
85:53 - like it needs to be a little bigger so
85:59 - the thing that I forgot to mention is
86:01 - sequencing oh you know it should be
86:05 - don't you think it should be that the
86:07 - bot has to guess the random number so
86:11 - we're thinking of the random number and
86:12 - the bot has to guess it hmm that's this
86:17 - is gonna be a hard one I should just do
86:20 - the knock-knock joke thing I mean that's
86:22 - an example from rive script I actually
86:26 - have no idea how to do this with the
86:27 - guessing the random number thing because
86:29 - oh no it's easy I just check whether
86:33 - it's equal less than or greater than and
86:35 - I have some other stuff about picking
86:37 - the random number and your name and
86:38 - whatever let's do it so who should who
86:40 - should pick the random number I should
86:42 - pick the random number cuz I know I'm
86:44 - saying their number and I have to figure
86:46 - out whether it's bigger or the bots know
86:49 - the bots picking the number is gonna be
86:51 - oh I could have an automatic thing who's
86:57 - the user pick it okay the bots gonna
86:59 - pick the number okay bot thinks of a
87:03 - number okay thank you everybody that's
87:05 - gonna do that all right oh you know what
87:09 - I want to do packages so there's a rive
87:14 - script syntax highlighter I'm so I'm
87:16 - gonna go to packages oh I already have
87:20 - it installed okay so this is I already
87:22 - have this rive script syntax highlighter
87:24 - installed okay and here I'm sketch that
87:29 - yes
87:29 - all right everybody you ready here we go
87:41 - pick them from the book of course so how
87:47 - do I feed it how do I feed it the random
87:51 - number
87:54 - but I could do I have a clever idea I
87:57 - think I know I have I have a crazy idea
87:59 - I've got an idea
88:01 - oh this is gonna be good this is gonna
88:02 - be good this is gonna be good okay I'm
88:04 - excited
88:10 - welcome to a coding challenge where I
88:13 - will make a cheese bot that thinks that
88:15 - a random number and then the user has to
88:18 - guess that ringing them that random
88:20 - number will be
88:21 - [Music]
88:28 - [Music]
88:34 - thank you very much okay
88:37 - so I already forgot what I said three
88:40 - 7155
88:41 - so I'm gonna do this in JavaScript I'm
88:44 - gonna say let let dot let dot no there's
88:47 - no that dot let number equal 37 Oh 555
88:53 - okay I guess the bots gonna think of a
88:55 - number between 0 and 999 thousand and
89:00 - the chat bot framework that I'm gonna
89:02 - use to create this bot is something
89:05 - called rive script and I made a really
89:07 - terrible video about rive script that
89:10 - you could go and watch if you haven't
89:12 - but I would probably recommend just go
89:13 - and look at the right script tutorial
89:15 - which will be linked on the right script
89:16 - website which would be linked in this
89:17 - video's description and so what I need
89:20 - to I need to do two things I need to
89:22 - program in JavaScript I need to
89:23 - configure my chat bot the brain of the
89:25 - chat bot right this is a diagram
89:30 - technical fail this is a diagram from my
89:32 - previous video where I have something a
89:35 - JavaScript program is going to feed
89:36 - input into the brain and the brain is
89:39 - going to give me a reply so I'm gonna do
89:40 - all this input and output in JavaScript
89:42 - but the brain is actually gonna be
89:44 - controlled by rive scripts so in order
89:46 - for that to happen I need to create a
89:48 - rive script file so I'm gonna say a new
89:50 - file and I'm gonna call it a brain drive
89:54 - there's I don't have to call it that I'm
89:57 - actually I have an atom package the atom
89:59 - drive script package which is doing
90:02 - syntax highlighting so I can do things
90:04 - like and I said in my previous video
90:05 - that a pound was a comment it's not so
90:08 - this is the chatbots brain so the first
90:11 - thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give the
90:13 - chat bot a specific number I have an
90:15 - idea for the number to be picked
90:16 - randomly each time but let's just start
90:19 - with specific random number in the chat
90:21 - bot so this is rive script syntax it
90:24 - looks like JavaScript but it's write
90:26 - script syntax and I'm gonna do something
90:29 - that just says so I'm gonna do a
90:34 - catch-all so I'm this is a trigger so
90:37 - this is so rife script if you didn't
90:39 - watch the previous video or don't know
90:40 - anything about it is a pattern matching
90:41 - system for chatbots so this is match any
90:44 - the user says that I don't match
90:46 - otherwise I'm gonna say the reply is
90:48 - going to be guess a number between zero
90:54 - and nine nine nine nine nine right so
90:57 - that's what the chat bot is going to say
90:58 - so actually let's leave this let's try
91:01 - to get the whole system working and then
91:03 - we'll come back and finish configuring
91:05 - the chat bot so how do I want to make
91:07 - this work well I want to have let's
91:10 - start putting some stuff in the HTML
91:11 - like chat bot and then I'm going to
91:14 - create a input user gonna call this user
91:19 - input and I'm gonna say say I'm gonna
91:24 - and then I'm going to create I'm going
91:31 - to create so this I'm just trying to put
91:32 - some stuff on the HTML page and I'm
91:35 - going to say reply I mean I'm not being
91:40 - thoughtful about the design here output
91:44 - and then I probably need like some sort
91:48 - of button that's like submit I mean like
91:50 - button ID equals submit button so again
91:56 - I'm being absolutely not very thoughtful
91:58 - about this interface but I'm just
92:00 - putting it let's see if what I wrote
92:01 - here in HTML will appear on the page
92:05 - there we go
92:08 - and the button should say submit great
92:12 - so this is the idea is that I'm gonna be
92:15 - able to say things like hello and hit
92:17 - submit and the chat BOTS gonna say
92:19 - something to me here in the reply
92:20 - obviously it's my hope that those of you
92:22 - watching this video will make something
92:24 - more creative and thoughtful about the
92:26 - design and eventually what I want to do
92:28 - is use a library called p5 speech to
92:32 - actually have all this happen with voice
92:33 - so but let's first make it work with
92:35 - text and I'll do another video to make
92:37 - it work with voice okay so how do I then
92:40 - so now I have my framework and well
92:44 - let's actually look we need to write
92:46 - some JavaScript I forgot about that part
92:48 - so let's go back to JavaScript and I
92:50 - don't need to draw a function and I'm
92:53 - gonna say let button equals select I
92:56 - called it some
92:58 - an idea submit I'm gonna say let user
93:03 - input equals select user input is the ID
93:08 - I gave it and what else do I need
93:11 - I need let output equals select output
93:15 - so now I have access to all of those Dom
93:17 - elements like I need the bunny to know
93:19 - when the user hits the button I need to
93:21 - know in the user what the user is said
93:22 - when they hit the button I need to build
93:24 - to put the reply somewhere so now I need
93:26 - a callback an event for whenever I click
93:28 - the button button Mouse pressed and I'm
93:32 - gonna call function called chat so I'm
93:34 - now going to write a function called
93:35 - chat and all I'm gonna do here I'm going
93:41 - to say input equals user input value so
93:45 - this is me getting the value what the
93:47 - user said and I'm gonna say output dot
93:50 - HTML input so I now have a parrot chat
93:54 - bot I have made a parrot chat bot all it
93:56 - ever will do is put back what the user
93:58 - says I haven't put the ride script brain
94:00 - into this program yet so now let's see
94:02 - if this is correct if I run this hello
94:05 - hello goodbye goodbye what's up
94:10 - question mark what's up so we can see
94:12 - here this is my very basic parrot chat
94:14 - bot I can read what the user says and I
94:16 - can give it a reply now what I want to
94:18 - do is have rive script act as the brain
94:20 - to tell me what the reply should
94:23 - actually be well time out I think
94:28 - somebody's at the door
94:28 - oh hello I'm yes I'm actually live right
94:34 - now
94:35 - you can't nobody can see you but they
94:37 - could hear you oh I got it for Jeff
94:41 - already I uploaded it oh I just haven't
94:44 - emailed it to you guys but I will okay
94:46 - perfect no problem
94:50 - that was a very famous guest star that
94:53 - just appeared on the coding train let's
94:55 - see if anybody could guess who that was
94:56 - if anybody heard that conversation okay
95:00 - so where was I in this video I oh this
95:09 - hasn't happened for you guys in real
95:10 - time yet
95:11 - now I'm seeing that okay I'll say who
95:19 - that was later another time let's see if
95:20 - anybody can guess okay uh was not Lady
95:26 - gaga that was a good lady we was Elijah
95:28 - the prophet no anyway as you open the
95:31 - door whatever okay so where was I
95:36 - okay now it's time for us to add that
95:39 - brain so I'm gonna go to the right
95:42 - script github page and this is actually
95:44 - in this particular repository called
95:47 - rive script J s so write scripts is a
95:49 - generic syntax for configuring a chat
95:52 - bot that you can then use in a variety
95:54 - of different programming languages
95:55 - environments I want to use it in
95:57 - JavaScript so all I need to do and one
95:59 - thing I've done already that I should
96:01 - have mentioned is I've imported the rive
96:04 - script library so here i've imported the
96:07 - rice script library just from a URL i
96:09 - could download it but i must have a
96:10 - reference to that rice script javascript
96:12 - library so i've done that is and it's
96:14 - covered in that github page and then I'm
96:16 - really just gonna say load file so no
96:19 - first I'm going to create a bot so I'm
96:21 - gonna go here and I'm gonna say let bot
96:26 - equal new rye script then I'm gonna say
96:29 - load file and my file is just called
96:33 - brain drive and I'm gonna I need to
96:38 - callbacks ready brain ready and brain
96:46 - error being very inconsistent of my
96:48 - naming of stuff so I'm now gonna write
96:50 - those callbacks brain ready console dot
96:54 - log chat bot ready and then I'm going to
96:59 - say brain error console dot log chat bot
97:07 - error and I'm sure I could there's
97:10 - probably an argument I could get some
97:11 - information about the error but let's
97:13 - just add this right now and let's just
97:15 - see if I now run this uncaught dollar
97:20 - sign is not defined
97:22 - so I have an error somehow
97:25 - let's take a look maybe I need to say at
97:29 - the top of version right I was doing
97:33 - this before let's say version 2 probably
97:35 - I might need this the top of the brain
97:39 - and let's go back no ok
97:42 - debugging time debugging debugging
97:46 - debugging time debugging time hmm what's
97:51 - wrong here dollar sign is not defined
97:58 - let me look at my actual example
98:11 - oh did I type the name wrong name of the
98:13 - file oh my god brain drive Oh brah
98:18 - look everybody in the chat sorry
98:23 - apparently I named my chat bot Brian
98:26 - without realizing it the name is brain
98:29 - not Brian the life of brain okay here we
98:33 - go let's try this now ah oh I know what
98:40 - the problem is I know what the problem
98:43 - is what could possibly dollar sign is
98:45 - not defined mean what javascript library
98:50 - uses dollar sign as a key term jQuery I
98:55 - think that rive script depent the rive
98:57 - script JavaScript library depends on
98:59 - jQuery and I have it imported jQuery
99:01 - that must be the problem right so it's
99:04 - not even loading the file it hasn't even
99:05 - gotten to the air and error in the file
99:06 - yet so if I want to load jQuery let's
99:10 - find a way to do that and I should be
99:14 - able to I don't know jQuery minified
99:17 - copy this copy I need to blow jQuery in
99:22 - my index.html file so and I can do that
99:25 - via URL so oops ah let's grab this come
99:32 - on people help me out here with some
99:34 - copy pasting this should copy it copy to
99:36 - clipboard copied it's not copying it to
99:39 - clipboard
99:40 - I hope this part gets edited out okay so
99:50 - okay so now I've imported jQuery as well
99:53 - here's the thing so JavaScript files
99:56 - that a web page uses can be loaded just
99:59 - like this is the code that I'm writing
100:00 - it's it's get Dutch yes these are some
100:02 - p5 libraries that I'm using but they're
100:04 - actually locally stored on the computer
100:06 - there are some other libraries but I'm
100:07 - getting them from a URL all these things
100:09 - are possible I don't know there's
100:10 - probably some nice good best practices
100:12 - here that somebody who knows something
100:13 - about programming will tell you but I'm
100:15 - just gonna make it work okay so now
100:17 - let's go back hit refresh chatbot ready
100:20 - okay so the chat bot is ready so now
100:24 - what do I do next
100:25 - what I want all I need to do is here in
100:28 - this chat and I probably should make you
100:31 - know if I were being really careful
100:33 - about this I would write some code to
100:35 - make sure the brain had been loaded
100:37 - before the bot tries to reply but I
100:40 - think it's very unlikely that a user is
100:42 - gonna be able to submit something before
100:44 - the bots actually loaded so but I'm
100:46 - gonna show you there's something I'm
100:47 - gonna have to add to this later that I
100:48 - think it's gonna be a little bit of an
100:49 - issue okay so what I'm going to do is I
100:53 - am going to I have code you alright so I
101:00 - need to ask the bot for a reply I'm
101:01 - pretty sure this is gonna this is gonna
101:03 - be here just in this page and oh
101:05 - interesting so I think that I might
101:10 - actually need this the replies have to
101:12 - be sorted to be honest I have no idea
101:14 - what that does but I imagine this is
101:17 - some sort of like processing element so
101:22 - let's add this in and so let's add this
101:28 - in under brain ready I'm gonna sort the
101:32 - replies and then what I want to do is I
101:35 - want to say let reply equal bot reply
101:39 - input now I think this actually isn't
101:41 - going to work I think I need to say I
101:44 - think if I look at the code example here
101:47 - local user I forget what this does but I
101:52 - need to give the first argument as local
101:55 - user so I want to say let input equals
101:58 - user input value and bot reply love it
102:00 - so let's see what happens now I think I
102:01 - did everything
102:04 - hello guess the number between so no
102:07 - matter what I do it's just gonna say
102:09 - guess the number between 0 and 99 99 so
102:12 - now aha so what do i what what else do I
102:16 - need in this chat bot so for example
102:18 - what if the user says any number great
102:25 - guess I like the number star-1 so this
102:30 - isn't a star but this is a wild card
102:32 - just like this is a wild card but this
102:35 - is a wild card that only will match
102:37 - number so now if I reload this again if
102:41 - I say anything I'm gonna say guessing
102:43 - number but if I say 100 great guess I
102:46 - like the number 100 let me make this a
102:47 - little bit bigger so we can see I'm
102:49 - starting he could figure the bot to do
102:51 - certain things now what I really want to
102:53 - do is use a conditional so I want to say
102:57 - something like if star 1 is greater than
103:06 - is greater than bot num then I'm going
103:12 - to I need an equals here I don't even
103:13 - remember then I'm going to say pick a
103:16 - higher a lower number and if it's less
103:23 - than I don't know if I've got the syntax
103:26 - right here pick a higher number and
103:28 - again you can go and read the raj script
103:30 - tutorial heart watch my previous video
103:32 - that wasn't very good nothing this one's
103:34 - any good and then I could say oh I'm
103:38 - sorry what am I doing here I'm in the
103:40 - wrong I'm totally in the wrong place
103:42 - oh no no I'm in the right place I just
103:44 - don't know if I have the syntax right
103:45 - and then if it's equal you got it you
103:52 - got it
103:52 - so let's go to the Rice script tutorial
103:55 - which is here and let's look for
103:59 - conditional condition condition
104:02 - additional so this is a way I can have
104:07 - the bot set something and what I'm
104:10 - looking for is like this here we go ah
104:15 - what I get age is greater than 25 this
104:20 - is what you can do so this is what I
104:21 - want I have I want this conditional and
104:23 - I need the equals like almost like the
104:25 - arrow syntax the equals greater than so
104:28 - I want to say equals like this so I
104:33 - think this should work let's see if this
104:37 - is right and let's let's take a look
104:42 - here oh these are stars so I guess I
104:45 - need stars if I'm going to do a
104:46 - conditional
104:51 - and syntax highlighting is doing
104:53 - something weird which and the equal
104:55 - should be double equals I guess there we
104:57 - go so I think maybe this is right now
104:59 - okay let's see
105:02 - and I don't don't need to say star one
105:04 - cuz there's only star so let's see
105:06 - what's the chance I've gotten this right
105:11 - so things are still working is telling
105:15 - me to guess the number I'm gonna guess
105:16 - the number 10 pick a higher number I'm
105:19 - gonna guess the number 9 9 9 9 9 9
105:21 - pick a lower number I'm gonna guess the
105:23 - number 37 5 5 5 you got it okay
105:31 - we should probably do more with this bot
105:33 - like it should have a name and it should
105:34 - be able to respond to other things but
105:36 - one thing I want to do is so why am I
105:38 - doing this I don't know I've really lost
105:40 - track of that but one reason why I'm
105:43 - doing this is if I combine rye Script
105:47 - and JavaScript I can make use of the
105:49 - powerful pieces of Drive script and
105:53 - JavaScript together so what I could do
105:56 - is I could actually have JavaScript I
105:59 - don't think there's a way for write
106:00 - script easily to pick a random number it
106:01 - probably is but just for the sake of
106:04 - argument what if I oh it's funny how I
106:08 - had this here so what if I actually say
106:11 - let num equal floor random nine nine
106:16 - nine nine nine so and then I'm going to
106:19 - and actually what I'm saying is 100,000
106:23 - oh and I need to know the parentheses
106:26 - now I'm going to just console.log that
106:28 - number let's just what I want is for
106:31 - JavaScript to pick the random number
106:35 - there so it's picking a random number
106:37 - each time and maybe I need to make this
106:39 - a little bigger so you can see it right
106:42 - so how can I pass something that
106:44 - javascript picked to the bot well I'm
106:48 - asking
106:49 - I'm sending things to the bot from the
106:52 - user but I don't actually have to I
106:54 - could send stuff from the bot from my
106:56 - program as well so there's no reason why
106:58 - I couldn't actually just do this when
107:00 - the chat bot is ready
107:05 - and then what if what I send to the bot
107:12 - is let reply equal bot dot wouldn't it
107:18 - what is what is the function bot reply
107:20 - user lok local is it something like that
107:23 - i don't know i can't remember the local
107:24 - user set plus the number so what I'm
107:33 - doing is I'm sending to the bot I'm
107:35 - telling the bot like a secret message
107:37 - the code is sending a message to the bot
107:39 - not me the actual user typing saying set
107:42 - number so what I now want to do is if
107:45 - and of course this is very easily
107:47 - hackable don't get me wrong
107:49 - set number is a message where now I the
107:55 - bot will set and we don't need this a
107:59 - hard-coded variable anymore set num
108:03 - equal star so this will actually and I
108:09 - don't did I get this syntax right looks
108:12 - like something might be weird but I
108:13 - think I got it right so set Nam equals
108:15 - star and then now I can change this from
108:17 - bot num to get numb so let's see and I
108:20 - don't know let's make this pick a number
108:21 - between but between 1 and 10 just to
108:26 - like make things a little simpler here
108:28 - so this is gonna be a guess a number
108:29 - between 1 and 10
108:43 - between one and ten and now the number
108:47 - will be here plus one because this is
108:49 - gonna give you a number between zero and
108:50 - nine and so and let's actually let's
108:56 - look at that number so we can cheat so
108:59 - to speak to make sure this is working
109:00 - and let's run this now okay so we'd pick
109:04 - the number four I can see that in the in
109:06 - the in the console so if I say one no
109:10 - reply found so what happened here brain
109:16 - so this is wrong this is clearly the
109:19 - wrong syntax let's go back to the rive
109:23 - script tutorial and we can see here a
109:29 - set name oh you know what it is you
109:32 - probably doesn't want any white space
109:33 - their set name equal formal formal by
109:38 - the way this is a way to keep that the
109:40 - case sensitivity of what the users typed
109:42 - there's all sorts of things and and so I
109:46 - can say set num let's see where was that
109:53 - set name equals formal let's just paste
109:57 - this in here to make sure I'm using the
109:58 - right syntax set num equal star so let's
110:04 - try this pick a higher number nine pick
110:11 - a lower number eight pick a lower number
110:14 - seven
110:16 - you got it too so you know I'm hacking
110:25 - it basically but pick a higher number
110:27 - pick a lower number so probably I don't
110:30 - know if this is the best solution there
110:31 - might be a different way to pass that
110:32 - value to the brain but certainly if I
110:35 - wanted to do it this way I could come up
110:37 - with like a really strange thing that
110:39 - the user would probably never type
110:41 - that's almost like a secret code to set
110:43 - a particular value that I'm getting from
110:45 - JavaScript so so anyway um there's more
110:49 - that could be done with this I've missed
110:50 - so many pieces
110:51 - thing that I actually missed that's
110:53 - important about chat bots are sequencing
110:55 - so one thing you can do is what if I
110:59 - have an example that's a knock-knock
111:01 - joke
111:01 - bot and so and that's actually from rive
111:04 - script I encourage you to check that out
111:06 - on the tutorial let's actually look for
111:08 - it but you can see something that's
111:11 - important here is about is the previous
111:14 - command so in other words the wild-card
111:20 - you want to you basically the user in a
111:23 - knock-knock joke the user can say
111:25 - anything I could just paste this in the
111:27 - user can say anything but there'd be the
111:30 - chat BOTS gonna say something different
111:32 - based on where you are in the sequence
111:34 - of the knock-knock joke so this is
111:35 - saying this is what the user this is
111:38 - what the chat bot should reply with
111:40 - after who is there has already happened
111:44 - and this is what should the chatbox
111:46 - reply after who so that's important okay
111:48 - I went off track there so here is my
111:51 - number guessing chat bot with rice
111:54 - script and p5 I would love to see what
111:57 - kind of different chat BOTS you make
111:59 - with this same framework you know what
112:01 - happens if you like start querying api's
112:03 - and get there like the weather and have
112:04 - the bot talk about stuff and different
112:06 - topics or it's a programming questions
112:07 - or I don't know what you can make this
112:08 - bot do but I look forward to seeing what
112:10 - you guys create from this video to say
112:13 - that again I feel like I look forward to
112:16 - seeing what you create from this video
112:21 - losing my mind I look I look forward to
112:24 - seeing what you create from this video
112:26 - and in the next video I'm going to take
112:30 - exactly this I don't know if I'm gonna
112:31 - do this in the next video but in the
112:32 - next video or two I'm gonna do exactly
112:34 - this but with speech recognition so this
112:37 - conversation this guessing game could
112:38 - happen just purely in an auditory if
112:42 - that's the right word audio way okay
112:44 - things are clicking all over the place
112:45 - see you soon good bye
112:50 - okay oh there's some interesting thing
112:57 - happening in the chat alright so
113:00 - hopefully this was useful for people
113:01 - look at this you can make a chat bot so
113:03 - easy a game
113:05 - guessing thing look how easy that was
113:07 - and I didn't even use any neural network
113:09 - involved with any of this stuff I don't
113:13 - know what are you talking about rounded
113:14 - up to the nearest ten million me I am so
113:16 - me okay
113:24 - so what time is it 5:35 I how long have
113:31 - I been live streaming am i at two hours
113:34 - already I two hours is generally my
113:36 - limit let me see what I'm gonna do in
113:39 - terms of this object stuff that I want
113:43 - to keep going with because oh you okay
113:48 - topic discussion in the patron live
113:51 - channel I really like it's you totally
113:54 - can you don't listen to me that should
113:55 - be your channel to enjoy yourself to
113:56 - talk about anything you want but those I
113:58 - got confused okay I feel like there
114:01 - should be like a live channel that I
114:04 - should see in a live channel that I
114:05 - shouldn't see close the span what did I
114:10 - miss
114:14 - whoops open recent chat BOTS oh sorry
114:23 - thank you there we go alright 3:05 a.m.
114:31 - in India and by the way the audio has
114:34 - the audio the audio is good alright
114:36 - let's see here
114:38 - so now you've made a chat but let's I'm
114:43 - right I'm going back to object stuff
114:44 - please hold
114:51 - [Music]
115:15 - you know when your hands are covered in
115:17 - flour or ooh chicken gizzard this is
115:31 - these are the new video I'm going
115:33 - through and slowly replacing and leaving
115:35 - online my older videos object-oriented
115:39 - program in es6 so this definitely needs
115:44 - to be redone arrays of objects but
115:47 - before I get to that I also was gonna do
115:50 - this like more on objects video which is
115:58 - remember I had this list let's see if I
116:01 - have it it's whoops go back let me come
116:09 - over here oh sorry this camera went off
116:19 - very hard to erase to use pressure on
116:23 - the board this eraser is also terrible
116:28 - but not so bad grey wizard and the chat
116:33 - will be reminding me to get a better
116:34 - eraser right about now so the things
116:40 - that I wanted to I mean the things that
116:42 - I want to eventually get to are so in
116:46 - this is a video that I imagine that's
116:48 - more on objects what are the things that
116:53 - I want to include
116:55 - [Music]
116:58 - let me go to once again here and looking
117:07 - for learning processing and I'm looking
117:12 - for object-oriented programming okay
117:16 - okay and more on objects particle class
117:21 - objects as data for other objects
117:24 - overloading and objects communicating
117:26 - with other objects make a robot already
117:33 - overloading hmm actually what I want to
117:37 - do is clickable so I think the objects
117:39 - communicating with other objects is
117:40 - almost more interesting once I have an
117:42 - array because if I go I'm trying to
117:45 - figure out what videos I'm gonna make
117:46 - here and that's I know I have clicking
117:48 - on objects adding and removing objects
117:52 - deleting objects checking I have all
117:54 - about here so actually maybe I should do
118:00 - all those that's what I did with you
118:05 - could do all those things once I already
118:07 - have an array so maybe that makes sense
118:10 - so is there actually doesn't make sense
118:12 - for anything else to come after these
118:16 - three because the next thing I want to
118:20 - do is a raise of objects okay I think
118:26 - it's still off topic and the chat is
118:27 - about Internet Explorer okay all right
118:32 - so I think what I'm gonna do who who
118:36 - wants to humor me and this is the video
118:41 - I'm replacing so I need to watch this
118:42 - for a sec okay so now I've made two
118:45 - videos one just about what is an array
118:47 - in the syntax of an array and the other
118:49 - video looking at how to use a loop to
118:52 - iterate over every element in that array
118:54 - and in this video I want to unlock this
118:57 - great power to you which is how to take
119:00 - an object and duplicate that object many
119:03 - times into an array so first this is
119:05 - viscera again that's all I need to know
119:07 - okay so that's what I do
119:09 - oh geez that I'm kind of redoing old
119:11 - content but I got to get to this
119:12 - sometime because look at this look at
119:15 - this horrible thing that I've done can
119:18 - you believe this nonsense that I'm
119:19 - making this like literal object and I'm
119:21 - like copy oh nobody should ever watch
119:22 - this video and try to learn programming
119:23 - from it Oh horrible okay
119:31 - so but I did get it just to revisit this
119:33 - is what I'm talking about how would you
119:34 - make so what I need to do now is close
119:44 - this close this close this and I need to
119:51 - please hold
119:52 - [Music]
121:04 - okay I am now ready oh is the music very
121:09 - loud sorry sorry sorry sorry I can't
121:18 - like get it right cuz all right
121:23 - [Music]
121:27 - sorry about that
121:29 - I just Boston saying advice as well take
121:32 - 10 minutes to install I term actor
121:34 - there's I term I'm gonna do I turn right
121:37 - before I do Chrome extensions no I'm
121:39 - gonna do it it's just it's so hard to
121:41 - like oh no bad me okay um
121:49 - ready here we go hello it's me again
121:54 - your friendly neighborhood coding person
121:57 - who made some bubbles so if you were
121:59 - watching some previous videos a while
122:01 - back I made these bubble objects and
122:04 - there they are they're moving around the
122:06 - street and then there were some videos
122:07 - where I look kind of different which
122:10 - were about arrays just like a raise of
122:12 - numbers and raise of strings and like
122:14 - it's a list of things and things have
122:16 - indices so why am I here now I'm here in
122:18 - this video because I have this goal I
122:21 - have this goal in life which is to say I
122:23 - have defined what it means to be a
122:25 - bubble
122:26 - I made a bubble class I made a bubble
122:29 - object and I made two bubble objects
122:32 - bubble one and bubble two and I would
122:36 - like to be able to make five bubble
122:37 - objects and I would like to not have to
122:40 - do this because I would also like to
122:43 - make five hundred or a thousand or ten
122:45 - thousand I want to be able to
122:48 - make as many duplicate as many objects
122:50 - as I want create as many objects as I
122:51 - want from that template from that class
122:54 - without having to have all these
122:55 - separate variables and wouldn't you just
122:58 - isn't it just so convenient that I'm
123:01 - right here
123:02 - having just talked about objects and
123:03 - arrays if I just put those two things
123:04 - together we'll be in good shape so let's
123:06 - do that I don't think I need to yeah
123:10 - okay so let's just do that oh no don't
123:12 - go over there okay so so I'm gonna
123:14 - change this from one variable to Beryl's
123:16 - to a single variable called bubbles now
123:19 - remember when I want a variable to hold
123:22 - an array a list of information instead
123:25 - of making it equal to something like an
123:27 - object or a number
123:29 - I set it equal to open closed brackets
123:33 - there's other ways you can create an
123:35 - array also but this is a pretty
123:36 - conventional way now what I might do is
123:39 - I might say okay I have this array in
123:45 - theory I have this array that I could
123:47 - fill why don't I put a bubble in index
123:51 - zero and a bubble in index one so I'm
123:55 - going to put my bubble here and put my
123:56 - bubble here make two bubble objects
123:58 - instead of having separate variables
124:01 - bubble one bubble - I am going to have a
124:06 - variable bubbles index 0 because
124:10 - remember the first spot in the array is
124:12 - 0 not 1 so it was kind of bad that when
124:15 - I was doing this idea in the bubble 1
124:16 - and bubble - I should really name the
124:18 - double 0 and bubble 1 so the first thing
124:20 - I could do is just change this program
124:22 - to say like hey bubbles zero bubbles
124:27 - 1 bubbles 0 this is bubbles 0 you get
124:36 - the idea right one oh this is all why am
124:40 - I even bothering with this bubbles one
124:42 - oh no look at this
124:44 - this is bubbles zero and one and this is
124:46 - bubbles zero in one ah oh my goodness oh
124:49 - my gosh no wait a second stop the
124:53 - presses I'm so confused
124:55 - I think what I would prefer to do is
124:56 - move 0 and 1 and then
124:59 - chosen one so of course I could do this
125:01 - in any order but I want to move the
125:03 - first one and and by the way this is not
125:06 - going to be the solution because even
125:08 - though this now works and I have the
125:10 - same exact result the only thing that
125:12 - I've done differently is that instead of
125:15 - having two separate variables I have one
125:17 - array but I'm still referencing the two
125:19 - separate bubble objects individually so
125:21 - if I want to have ten of them I still
125:23 - have to keep adding more and more lines
125:25 - of code so what I want to do is I want
125:28 - to use that for loop if I say for let I
125:34 - equals zero I is less than some number I
125:40 - plus plus then inside here I can refer
125:46 - to that array called bubbles instead of
125:49 - saying hard-coding in zero hard-coding
125:52 - in one if I just say bubbles index I
125:55 - this is going to repeat many times with
125:58 - a different value for I I is zero then
126:00 - it's 1 then it's two then it's three so
126:03 - this is a way of me iterating accessing
126:05 - every single element of that array so I
126:07 - can use that too and by the way I know I
126:10 - know there's like a for each sort of
126:12 - thing and maybe I'll make a video about
126:14 - that but I'm gonna just use a nice for
126:16 - loop with a counter variable so I'm
126:18 - gonna today for let I equals 0 eyes less
126:22 - than 2 I plus plus and now instead of
126:28 - referencing the bubbles individually I'm
126:31 - going to just say bubbles index high
126:35 - which means I can now do this
126:39 - bubbles index I that same loop later and
126:44 - draw this is to use a loop to create the
126:46 - bubble objects and set up I can say
126:48 - bubbles index I'd move bubbles index I
126:52 - dot I don't even remember anymore a show
126:55 - is that what it was show we can look in
126:58 - the bubble class if I forgotten where's
127:01 - the bubbles class oh here it is
127:03 - move and show oh boy what happened here
127:06 - wait hold on hold on that shouldn't be
127:10 - there that was like me too
127:13 - guessing something sold on move and show
127:18 - what was that we would show what was
127:22 - what this show is the show mightier
127:24 - please edit this somehow move show was
127:27 - it show we could scroll down and look at
127:29 - the bubble claw MC move and show okay so
127:31 - those were the names of the functions
127:32 - that I used in that bubble class so now
127:35 - let's run this again oops
127:38 - and here we go so look at that ah now I
127:42 - still have two bubbles but one was big
127:45 - one was small before and then one was
127:47 - they were both there were different
127:49 - spots I lost that so one of the things
127:51 - that I had in my previous example if I
127:53 - just go back to here is I had specified
127:56 - exact locations for each bubble object
127:59 - and exact sizes and now that I have a
128:03 - loop I'm in a much happier place in that
128:06 - I can easily make 20 of these but it's
128:08 - what do I do about initializing all that
128:11 - stuff so this thing is here hello
128:13 - welcome to programming the reason why
128:16 - I'm coding here is not because I want to
128:19 - specifically set some exact locations
128:21 - for bubbles more likely I want to come
128:23 - up with some kind of algorithm like I
128:25 - want all the bubbles to appear in a
128:27 - perfect grid or I want them all to
128:29 - appear randomly or I want them to be in
128:30 - a grid that's slightly offset randomly
128:32 - or I want them to appear in a spiral
128:34 - pattern I want them all to start in the
128:35 - same place so what is that algorithm so
128:38 - let me just say so one thing I could do
128:39 - is I could use the fact that I have this
128:40 - counter I and I could say let X equal
128:43 - like well what if I start the bubbles
128:46 - starting on at like pixel ten and then
128:50 - add space them out by like 30 pixels you
128:54 - know so this kind of came to me and
128:55 - immediately because I've done this so
128:57 - many times but this is now a formula
128:59 - that when I is 0 X will equal 10 when I
129:02 - is 1 X will equal 10 plus 30 times 140
129:05 - and if I ever got to to which one in
129:07 - this case it would be 10 plus 1670 right
129:11 - so this idea of spacing the bubbles out
129:13 - so I could made 3 of them and by the way
129:18 - and then of course instead of
129:19 - hard-coding this value here I could say
129:21 - X I could use this variable to pass in
129:24 - which is calculated everything and then
129:25 - by the way this is really
129:27 - so one thing that's bad about this is
129:29 - now if I if I'm creating three bubbles
129:32 - all of a sudden right then I left this
129:35 - number two here so what I want to do is
129:38 - say bubbles dot length so this way
129:40 - however now I can't use bubbles dot
129:42 - length here because the array when I
129:44 - first started was empty so I'm adding
129:46 - things to the array a certain number of
129:48 - them then I can retrieve that length
129:49 - later and again there are different ways
129:51 - you can approach how many spots there
129:53 - are and how you store the length but
129:55 - this is just a way that i'ma do it for
129:56 - this example
129:57 - so now let's look at this you can see
130:00 - look at them they started now let's not
130:02 - move them just so we can see you can see
130:05 - there they are spaced out and I could
130:06 - easily just say well actually I want to
130:08 - space them out by a hundred pixels and I
130:10 - want them just to be 20 pixels in and
130:12 - you can see there we go and I want them
130:14 - to actually start at least 20 pixels in
130:17 - and you can see there they are and then
130:19 - I want to have ten of them there we go
130:22 - but I can't really have ten of them you
130:24 - get the idea and now I could put back in
130:26 - move and there they go
130:30 - so this is a way and I but what hello do
130:34 - you do something kind of exciting about
130:35 - this video which is that I haven't once
130:38 - changed any of the code down here this
130:41 - idea of a single bubble has remained
130:43 - exactly the same the thing that's
130:45 - different now is that I can create them
130:47 - and put them in an array and however
130:49 - many there are I could just move it show
130:51 - over so I'm gonna show you a few more
130:55 - things here now here's another thing I
130:57 - could do let's actually just make them
130:59 - let's let's just sort of prove this
131:00 - point let's give them all random spots
131:02 - and again I could set them randomly in
131:05 - the constructor but I'm just going to do
131:08 - it here so I'm gonna give them all a
131:13 - random I'm going to just create a whole
131:14 - bunch of bubbles with random locations
131:16 - and we can see in random sizes and you
131:19 - can see there they are but this is what
131:20 - I'm talking about now I have this one
131:22 - program here
131:24 - it makes ten bubbles I want this program
131:27 - to now make 100 how how many keys on the
131:32 - keyboard do I need to hit in order to
131:33 - make this change one if I programmed
131:37 - everything correctly all I need to do
131:40 - is at a zero here and suddenly I have a
131:44 - hundred of them and if I add another
131:46 - zero suddenly I have a thousand of them
131:49 - now my program is slowing down because
131:51 - it has to render and draw a lot of stuff
131:56 - hold on did I mess something up oh no
131:59 - people you guys are just distract me in
132:01 - the chat like I have a mistake in my
132:03 - code but it's just the autofill that
132:05 - Adam is doing that for you're talking
132:06 - about yeah why is it doing that
132:09 - okay sorry now my program might be
132:14 - slowing down because it's drawing a lot
132:17 - of bubbles and it's a lot to draw and
132:20 - you know I could sort of start thinking
132:21 - about what I really want to do here
132:23 - maybe actually what I want is for these
132:25 - bubbles not to have a stroke but I want
132:29 - them to have a fill with quite a bit of
132:32 - alpha and I could take this out of here
132:35 - and now I've got this sort of like
132:38 - cloudy thing going on so again I can use
132:41 - this idea what I'm really doing here is
132:43 - I'm kind of on the way to building
132:44 - something called a particle system I'm
132:46 - building a system of many individual
132:48 - elements that together make some sort of
132:50 - effect like a smoky cloudy thing but I
132:53 - could just with a with one variable now
132:55 - with one value change how many things
132:57 - are in there now here's the thing what
132:58 - if I'm gonna do one more thing in this
133:00 - video and I'm gonna I'm gonna actually
133:03 - put the bubble back to have that so
133:08 - let's just go back to where I was with
133:11 - just start with ten bubbles ten bubbles
133:15 - now what if what if I take this out of
133:18 - setup entirely it's gone what's gonna
133:22 - happen what's my program going to do
133:26 - nothing emptiest no but no emptiness no
133:29 - bubbles what if what I want to do is add
133:31 - bubbles when I click the mouse okay
133:33 - let's think about this the first thing
133:36 - that I might want to do is figure out
133:39 - where I can wear code executes when I
133:41 - click the mouse so that is that I want
133:43 - to add function mousepressed now whoops
133:48 - sorry
133:49 - now what do I want to do I want to make
133:51 - a bubble let be equal
133:53 - new bubble and I want that bubble to be
133:56 - where the mouse is and maybe it has a
133:59 - random size between 10 and 50 pixels so
134:04 - I've Nate I've and I don't love these 1
134:05 - character variables I should do better
134:07 - than that but I've picked a random
134:08 - number and I've made a new bubble what
134:10 - if I want to put that bubble in the
134:12 - array well I could say something like
134:14 - bubbles index 0 equals B right I could
134:17 - say I the first spot in the array put
134:19 - that bubble when I click the mouse look
134:22 - I only have one though because what I'm
134:24 - doing here is every single time I'm
134:27 - making a new bubble and putting it in
134:28 - the first spot but if this were a
134:30 - counter and it went up every single time
134:32 - I could put the first bubble in the
134:34 - first spot the next bubble in the second
134:36 - spot the next bubble in the third spot
134:38 - but I could do even better than that
134:40 - there's actually a function there's a
134:41 - lot of functions associated with arrays
134:43 - arrays are actually objects too that
134:45 - allow you to do certain things I'm gonna
134:46 - get to them I can delete stuff I can
134:48 - move stuff around I can shuffle I can
134:49 - sort but what I'm going to do is I'm
134:51 - gonna use this function called push push
134:55 - is a function that means add something
134:57 - to the array push it to the array and
135:00 - actually by default it's going to push
135:02 - it to the end of the array so now that I
135:04 - have that every time I click I add a new
135:11 - bubble and what's interesting about this
135:13 - is there's no there's a there's no limit
135:18 - to the number of bubbles I can have
135:19 - other than the computer speed and memory
135:20 - and interestingly enough I might just as
135:22 - a little effect change this to Mouse
135:24 - dragged and you can see now and I drag
135:27 - the mouse I'm kind of drawing this this
135:31 - kind of array of bubble objects okay so
135:34 - this is all about making an array of
135:36 - objects so if you're following along
135:38 - maybe you had an object you made some
135:39 - variation of the bubble you made a
135:41 - bouncing ball you made some kind of
135:42 - flying pig I don't know what it is you
135:45 - made a rainbow heart take that don't
135:49 - don't make any changes in your class at
135:51 - all try to write a program where you
135:53 - duplicate it in an array and you can
135:55 - just change one number and you can have
135:56 - 500 versus a thousand versus 10 see if
135:59 - you can add them with clicking the mouse
136:00 - or hitting the keyboard or some type of
136:02 - maybe what happened what if you try to
136:04 - like add
136:05 - every 10 seconds how would you do that
136:07 - what kind of event can trigger the
136:09 - adding of an object and then what I want
136:12 - to do in a future video which maybe will
136:14 - be the next one is how could I delete
136:16 - these when I click on them or how do I
136:19 - even know how do I communicate for all
136:21 - just a couple things how do I know if
136:23 - these bubbles are intersecting with each
136:24 - other so I want objects to talk to other
136:26 - objects and I also want to be able to
136:27 - talk to the objects bubbles you bubble
136:31 - hello bubble that's me talking to the
136:33 - objects I guess but I don't miss a alexa
136:36 - that's not a bubbles name's not alexa
136:38 - anyway what was I talking about
136:42 - oh so I want to be able to figure out
136:45 - how do I interact with the bubbles 10
136:47 - each bubble have its own mouth pressed
136:49 - kind of like event how does that work so
136:51 - I got to get to that sort of stuff and
136:52 - that'll come in a future video thanks
136:54 - for watching
136:58 - ok
137:03 - so here's the reason why I don't like
137:05 - using for each it's confusing it's
137:11 - confusing to beginners it's it uses a
137:16 - callback which is not even a concept in
137:19 - these videos that I've covered yet so if
137:21 - you're in this sequence oh I should do a
137:23 - video about for each and when you learn
137:25 - to use it but also the asynchronous
137:26 - aspect of the callback I think can be
137:29 - problematic and there's so many times
137:30 - we're having the counter is also just
137:32 - the index is incredibly useful so that's
137:35 - one of my reasons why I don't like using
137:36 - a for each alright so that was pretty
137:40 - good where was it 6 o'clock I think I'm
137:43 - gonna have to go this like desire to
137:45 - like but I'm not gonna say it I'll be
137:47 - it'll be if alright so we're so how did
137:51 - I how did I do there what did I get done
137:53 - I lost my playlist and if I go to my
138:01 - playlist here I told my dad yeah so
138:08 - weird whatever am I so I basically did
138:13 - this 7.3 this goes away so this year did
138:18 - gone
138:19 - there's no reason for this video to
138:22 - exist anymore in this playlist and then
138:24 - these can stay adding and removing
138:26 - objects and clicking on objects deleting
138:30 - objects using splice what's the
138:31 - difference between oh I made those two
138:33 - separate videos I think I've done this
138:35 - one oh I haven't done the I don't think
138:37 - do I do i I have to investigate this
138:39 - whether this actually I remove objects
138:41 - in this one but whatever's I'm in a
138:43 - slightly different sequence now because
138:45 - I did both push in this so what I need
138:50 - these can stay right now this should go
138:52 - away these can stay and the next things
138:55 - I need to do are clicking on an object
138:56 - and there's all of these deleting
139:02 - objects that sort of thing all right oh
139:06 - hi Sean Vann every Oh Sean man every so
139:09 - I forgot I opened I opened this live
139:13 - coding train episode with a sketch that
139:17 - Sean ban ever he made and this had
139:19 - crashed so let's try that again
139:24 - history oh how come it's not in this
139:32 - history show full history because it's I
139:35 - restarted the computer where wherever
139:42 - here we go here we go there we go all
139:47 - right Sean this is for you
139:58 - okay this is what the sponsored for not
140:02 - actually any money but this is this
140:04 - sponsored portion of my live video yes I
140:08 - that here's the thing I have no fear
140:10 - about showing my browser history because
140:13 - I'm logged in to a separate account that
140:17 - I only use for live streaming although I
140:19 - don't know who knows what I was doing
140:21 - earlier today in that account while I
140:22 - was setting up no that was not Sean Vann
140:25 - every at the door somebody else was at
140:27 - the door and I don't think anyone's
140:30 - guessed it yet
140:32 - okay so hello I'm here to tell you about
140:39 - something called
140:41 - interactive media arts which is a new
140:43 - BFA program at Tisch School of the Arts
140:45 - New York University right here in New
140:47 - York my name is Dan Shipman I am from
140:50 - the coding terrain YouTube channel but I
140:51 - also teach at a program called ITP
140:53 - which is a two-year graduate two-year
140:55 - graduate program master's program which
140:56 - still is here and it's still deep there
140:58 - and it's been around since 1979 so ver
141:01 - do the math I can't do that math but you
141:05 - can do it a long time and so next year
141:08 - we are starting a new undergraduate
141:10 - program and we're looking for students
141:12 - to apply if you are a high school senior
141:13 - junior I guess we can apply it whatever
141:15 - whatever you if you are the appropriate
141:17 - age to apply to college and are
141:20 - interested come and study here with us
141:22 - you can learn more at ITP NYU edu slash
141:26 - ima and you can there's all sorts of
141:31 - more information there and get your app
141:32 - there's stuff about how to apply and you
141:33 - can watch them Cody train videos to get
141:35 - a sense of what happens at ITP
141:37 - at ima and what will happen in ima it's
141:39 - gonna be great so please join us and
141:43 - tweet me at Schiffman if you if you need
141:45 - any if you have questions about or
141:46 - you're thinking about applying and we're
141:49 - seeing who will come here and and make
141:51 - the world a better place with code and
141:53 - other stuff to thank you
141:58 - how'd I do Sean Sean in the chat by the
142:01 - way is the director of undergraduate
142:03 - studies for the new I am a
142:05 - that's starting next year we have no
142:07 - idea if anyone will apply so I'm trying
142:12 - to do a little outreach we'd love for
142:14 - anybody from anywhere with any
142:16 - background who's interested in being
142:18 - creative maybe you are a maker or artist
142:21 - or you're a thinker engineer but this is
142:23 - really this is the button you should be
142:25 - because you should be defining yourself
142:27 - that sort of thing
142:30 - Gerald hunt says no one will acknowledge
142:32 - this comment but is there an upper age
142:39 - limit well I don't know that's a good
142:41 - question
142:42 - maybe Shawn in that chat can answer that
142:43 - question okay yeah me too Joseph okay
142:52 - you know by the way it's very bad
142:54 - practice when you're doing like a live
142:56 - stream to answer quote things that are
142:58 - in the chat without actually saying out
143:00 - repeating what they are but I just did
143:01 - it anyway and yeah you know so Austin
143:06 - writes and other people have writing the
143:08 - same things oh I wish I could go you
143:10 - know I can't afford it and this is a
143:11 - that is a really important and valid
143:16 - response and I hope that stuff that I'm
143:19 - doing here in this YouTube channel and
143:21 - other another innovative ways that
143:23 - people are thinking about to reduce the
143:25 - cost of Education I would love to be a
143:28 - part of that discussion and you know it
143:31 - is true that New York University being
143:33 - here this is a very expensive place and
143:35 - anything I could do to help make
143:37 - education accessible and more affordable
143:39 - for people I would love to do alright so
143:44 - I can't talk about the thing that I
143:48 - can't talk about because I was talking
143:50 - about it and then the whole thing
143:51 - crashed so right if you have a
143:57 - bachelor's degree already you should
143:58 - apply to ITP by the way if you're
144:00 - interested in hold on I did make some
144:06 - some videos that you might like if
144:08 - spring show ITP Schiffman coding train
144:12 - let's try this so that's the archive so
144:16 - this is a video that I made
144:18 - oh my god that's that music in it like
144:25 - [Music]
144:30 - I'm Dan this is a special coding
144:33 - training episode this what playing
144:36 - behind me spring show that's weird
144:42 - that's really weird so I won't play all
144:47 - this but you this is a video compilation
144:49 - that I made I don't know if you can hear
144:50 - me over this video show about a hundred
144:54 - I should do those like commentary like
144:57 - things where I like watch somebody
144:59 - else's video and I just like comment on
145:00 - it
145:00 - this video is terrible who's this idiot
145:06 - so this here like there's a bunch of
145:08 - projects that I show on different
145:09 - students and this is a graduate program
145:11 - and so and this is Michelle is amazing
145:14 - and so oh so you get you guys can you
145:19 - guys can watch this video it's online
145:20 - separate I'll link to it that you can
145:22 - learn a bit more about the kind of
145:23 - projects that people make it ITP by
145:25 - watching that video look there's also
145:28 - look at all these videos you could watch
145:29 - that are being recommended oh look at
145:33 - this what is ITP all right here we go
145:47 - dude I don't know
146:00 - this is so fancy what's he gonna stand
146:04 - for Oh program program program the video
146:10 - is too quiet still have no idea what
146:14 - they did here
146:15 - it's like humans plus technology or plus
146:18 - humans plus technology plus humans plus
146:23 - technology probably a lot of people
146:26 - still have that notion I have no idea
146:28 - what they do in there but it's something
146:29 - very quite a while ago I have a figure
146:31 - it's a problem it was a problem in that
146:33 - was a know something you know what he
146:35 - does oh so would you believe like things
146:37 - around the floor that I triple repeat oh
146:40 - it's that potage beans well I'm going to
146:44 - med school you know it's just it's hard
146:49 - to describe rob has 2006 gainfully tried
146:53 - to turn condensed to give us a I guess a
146:56 - mission statement all right at least a
146:58 - working description of the place which
147:01 - he thought I'm really enjoying them this
147:02 - has got to be at least ten years old
147:04 - we should insert that now
147:06 - [Music]
147:17 - we're trying to teach students that how
147:20 - to describe the program when they can
147:22 - describe the program to their parents
147:24 - they graduate ITP has definitely changed
147:28 - his personality over the years you guys
147:30 - recognize that voice dude Redbirds who
147:32 - I've talked about and I have Reds
147:33 - developing no this is a great video
147:46 - actually this is the origin actually I
147:55 - was fortunate with a colleague to get
147:58 - some money from the market foundation to
148:00 - start said about the college and the
148:01 - media center in 1971 and so when I was
148:06 - doing that that I realized there was no
148:07 - graduate department anywhere that
148:10 - provided this kind of opportunity for
148:12 - people to play with its tools and so in
148:16 - 1979 IP was started with 20 students it
148:22 - became apparent that the whole structure
148:24 - of communicating was radical
148:28 - there was again the spirit of pioneering
148:31 - and trying and you know they ran with it
148:34 - when I to be started in the nineteen the
148:37 - late 70s there were no computers and
148:39 - they were using closed caption video to
148:41 - do a lot of conferencing and stuff like
148:42 - that Twitty interesting stuff right
148:48 - video okay watching this I can watch
148:54 - this on my own time yeah
149:04 - okay
149:05 - and it became alright that's pretty
149:07 - interesting okay now where was I so I
149:12 - think I'm kind of wrapping up here I
149:14 - don't know if anybody has any I think
149:22 - I'm kind of done for today it is 610 to
149:24 - the Yankees game start what's the score
149:26 - the Yankees game and but but maybe I can
149:31 - answer a few questions or I don't think
149:37 - that I think I guess I could do one more
149:39 - of these they're short and I could get
149:40 - another one out of the way I could do
149:42 - the clicking maybe I should do the
149:46 - clicking so so Lubin's asked it so
149:55 - everyone's asking about the machine
149:56 - learning stuff again how to solve this
149:58 - problem but I'm gonna get to it I'm just
150:01 - I'm trying to doing some other stuff now
150:03 - I mean III talked about this earlier in
150:06 - the livestream so I'll come back to that
150:10 - yes sorry I'm not questions
150:20 - Annie's entertainment says where do I
150:22 - send you money send all of your checks
150:25 - to actually you should really donate to
150:27 - maybe a good cause like I saw that
150:30 - lin-manuel Miranda did is doing a
150:32 - fundraiser for Puerto Rico hurricane
150:34 - relief so that's where I would put my
150:36 - words right now today if I were you okay
150:43 - all right let me do one more because
150:46 - let's see what if I what have I actually
150:49 - gotten that will get published in the
150:50 - next week out today I did this tear I
150:53 - did this video where I tried to make a
150:54 - presentation about chatbots that I think
150:56 - maybe isn't any good I kind of did an
150:58 - introduction to rise script it was okay
151:00 - but not so great then I did a chatbot
151:02 - coding challenge which I thought turned
151:03 - out pretty well and then I I did this
151:08 - one so I've done four four things that
151:10 - it can get edited out of this and
151:12 - possibly a three or four depending on
151:14 - how many I choose to publish separately
151:17 - so so oh and I should really stop so
151:24 - Simon and I would like to do some kind
151:29 - of like marathon livestream at some
151:31 - point you know health was a concern of
151:33 - course I don't know that I could do
151:34 - something for 24 hours which Austin
151:36 - suggests plus the ima promo yeah yeah
151:40 - that's very sharp I just did it during
151:41 - the livestream I hope that was okay but
151:46 - and yes I do have a patreon that is
151:49 - correct so let's see let's no no
151:54 - clicking I should just go maybe I'll
151:57 - just go I'm gonna do the clicking I wish
151:59 - I had an idea for like you know how did
152:01 - the room well let's stop timeout
152:03 - I'm taking suggestions right now for
152:06 - anything similar to hi so I'm a harmonic
152:12 - motion again and I could really really
152:14 - make it super simple and just have
152:17 - something oscillating and I could make
152:19 - it color or size so what I'm looking for
152:22 - I'll take other suggestions but what I'm
152:24 - looking for I've been enjoying doing
152:27 - these so far these the 10 print and
152:30 - recursion this is nine minutes and this
152:33 - was twelve minutes they barely anything
152:35 - in the content of the video but the
152:37 - amount of creative things that people
152:39 - have created out of it has been really
152:41 - exciting to see so what's clicking the
152:44 - clicking the clicking was yeah so
152:47 - physics engine is no good that's too
152:49 - complicated
152:50 - Austin's telling me to set up I term
152:53 - make the ITP scrolling effect from the
152:56 - last video I don't know what that is
152:58 - harmonic motion is one recursion I
153:02 - already did
153:03 - game engine to complicated Hanoi towers
153:06 - to complicated anything the matter
153:08 - that's too complicated so so far I've
153:13 - got simple harmonic motion that's the
153:15 - only one that I've did I think and I
153:17 - term but point point box baking a pizza
153:24 - WebSockets to complicated
153:28 - if you click on the p5 homepage it makes
153:30 - a purple dot similar to the circle
153:32 - recursion do recursion and body
153:34 - simulation to calm the pac-man to
153:35 - complicated sine wave that I could do it
153:40 - could be a sine wave yeah let's do the
153:43 - sine wave Armand let's do the full I sis
153:48 - now that I have these array two toriel's
153:49 - kind of done let's do that okay here we
153:52 - go everybody Chrome extensions good one
153:55 - okay we're gonna do one more coding
153:58 - challenge then I'm gonna go home for the
154:00 - weekend cuz I can't bear to do another
154:02 - object-oriented programming video
154:05 - particle system I could do aa
154:07 - simple particle system look at that
154:10 - alright everybody
154:14 - last coding challenge we're gonna do a
154:17 - nice little poll simple particle system
154:21 - and when I say simple particle system I
154:24 - really mean Oh smoke like smoke effect
154:28 - okay and or us sine wave / simple
154:35 - harmonic motion and I should really just
154:37 - do both of these I'm just gonna do one
154:39 - okay
154:40 - here we go rb8 1d kak and now while I'm
154:52 - waiting for you to enter the straw poll
155:00 - [Music]
155:03 - 6240 to 3244 16,700
155:11 - oh that sound is so loud see this is the
155:38 - problem I don't have the laptop sorry
155:41 - everybody
155:41 - sorry 25 ok I've lost my energy okay
155:55 - that was your one minute to vote so I
155:59 - should really give you a little more
156:00 - time though because you guys are a
156:02 - little bit behind me so if I had three
156:11 - of these I could juggle them I bet
156:26 - nevermind ok poll is dead let's see here
156:30 - we go
156:50 - okay this is pretty clear oh I'm
156:53 - surprised nobody's watching is anybody
156:56 - watching these two loud again that's too
157:02 - loud I don't hold on I don't know what's
157:06 - going I should love to listen to I don't
157:07 - know I'm sorry the sound is all out of
157:08 - whack
157:13 - alright this even though only three my
157:17 - popularity is waning but it's pretty
157:25 - clear it's not too hot okay they're
157:29 - messing with you oh thank you
157:32 - it's fine I control you all so I could
157:41 - just do this for the next hour and never
157:44 - do the Cody challenge alright this is
158:03 - the last thing I'm going to do and okay
158:11 - so let's do this
158:16 - [Music]
158:31 - okay
158:46 - okay all right let's see here now
159:07 - and I'll get rid of this okay we're
159:16 - ready everybody I don't know how long
159:18 - I've been streaming for it's got to be
159:19 - like two and a half hours now I would
159:21 - guess so this is gonna be it for today
159:24 - I'm just gonna do I don't know why I'm
159:25 - doing one more thing it's really no
159:28 - reason for me to but I am I feel like
159:30 - guilty like I don't I'm not doing enough
159:32 - okay here we go oh wait this views hello
159:42 - welcome to another coding challenge in
159:45 - this coding challenge I'm gonna try to
159:46 - vary in a very simple way in a quick way
159:48 - program a simple particle system that
159:51 - resembles something like smoke so I'm
159:55 - gonna do this probably in a way that has
159:56 - very little visual interesting quality
159:58 - to it whatsoever it's my hope much like
160:00 - with my recent temperent and recursion
160:02 - coding challenges that I see a wide
160:05 - variety of clever beautiful remixes of
160:07 - this simple idea and what kind of
160:10 - beautiful particle system ideas can you
160:12 - make out of what I make so let me just
160:14 - start by making it so what I'm going to
160:15 - do the idea of the particle system by
160:17 - the way is creating something out of
160:20 - many particle things that's like the
160:23 - worst ever definition of a particle
160:27 - system but incidentally the term
160:29 - particle system was coined for
160:32 - originally for the movie the Wrath of
160:34 - Khan the effect the Genesis effect
160:37 - there's a effect where like this thing
160:39 - gets shot at a planet that doesn't have
160:40 - anything on it and kind of planet kind
160:42 - of catches fire and then all of a sudden
160:43 - it's all green and life is there and so
160:45 - anyway I think it's William T Reeves
160:47 - there's a paper I'll link to all that
160:49 - the history of particle systems in this
160:51 - video's description but but the idea is
160:54 - I want to make and I'm gonna do this as
160:56 - a class so I just recently started using
160:59 - es6 and I made a bunch of tutorials
161:01 - about classes and objects and I'm going
161:03 - to use that technique in this video so
161:06 - I'm gonna make a class anytime I make a
161:08 - class I need to make a constructor and
161:10 - this particle now I could use if you
161:12 - look at my nature of code videos I use
161:14 - this thing called a P vector that's in
161:16 - processing in p5 there's something
161:18 - called a p5 fector but
161:20 - stay simple here and I'm just going to
161:22 - make this X just an X a separate X which
161:27 - will be 300 and this dot Y which will be
161:29 - 3 380 so the reason why I'm doing this
161:34 - is I want my particles to in this idea
161:37 - you know I could do anything but I want
161:39 - them all to start at the bottom and kind
161:41 - of come up word and fade out which will
161:43 - hopefully give me a somewhat smoke or
161:46 - fire like effect it probably will not
161:48 - look like that at all but that you're
161:49 - gonna then you're gonna modify it make
161:51 - something much better okay so I want a
161:53 - function called show for each object and
161:56 - in it show I'm just gonna you know like
161:58 - loading images and using textures to
162:00 - draw the particles would be a nice
162:01 - technique to create more interesting
162:03 - visual effects but I'm just gonna draw
162:05 - them as circles this dot X this dot Y
162:08 - and I'm gonna give this I'm gonna have
162:09 - it be a diameter of 16 and I don't if
162:13 - the width and height are equal I can
162:14 - just use one I'm gonna say fill and I'm
162:16 - gonna give it some alpha and I'm gonna
162:18 - I'm gonna say stroke 255 just so I can
162:20 - see it really well now and so the Alpha
162:22 - will be like 10 so now let's just try
162:26 - making a single particle I'll just call
162:28 - it P P equals new particle and P dot
162:34 - show so let's run this there we go
162:40 - there's that particle now I does it a
162:42 - little bit so there's this is it I have
162:44 - one particle there it is at the bottom
162:46 - good so now what I want to do it's
162:49 - obvious I'm going to need many of them
162:50 - so I'm going to change this to be an
162:51 - array and what I'm actually going to do
162:54 - is I'm going to say in draw let P is
162:59 - equal a new particle and then I'm gonna
163:02 - say particles dot push P so what I'm
163:05 - going to do is I'm gonna use the push
163:07 - function which adds an object to the
163:09 - array and let me put this in setup now
163:11 - just for the sake of argument so I'm
163:12 - going to put one particle in the array
163:15 - so that now if I write a for loop that's
163:18 - in you know q2 complaining about not a
163:22 - for each loop where I iterate over the
163:25 - array using a counter variable like eye
163:27 - and say particles index where how do I
163:30 - get up there particles index I
163:33 - now I kind of have the same program this
163:36 - should be the same I should see just
163:37 - that one particle I created it and setup
163:40 - I added to the array and I'm showing it
163:42 - same exact program but now let's make
163:46 - that particle move
163:47 - so let's write a function called update
163:50 - let's give this particle variables like
163:54 - VX and V Y and I'm gonna give it an
163:58 - initial random like I'm gonna give it's
164:00 - random VX for velocity so I need a speed
164:03 - or way that it changes along the x-axis
164:05 - and a y-axis so using p5 vector could be
164:07 - helpful here and if anyone wants to do a
164:09 - port of this with p5 vector you're
164:11 - welcome to and then I'm gonna give it a
164:13 - random velocity going upward so what
164:16 - would that be upward is negative so
164:18 - something like between like negative 5
164:20 - and negative 1 so an update I'm now
164:24 - going to say this dot X plus equals this
164:27 - dot V X this dot y plus equals this dot
164:29 - dy so the idea here is that I'm going to
164:33 - change the location by some random
164:36 - amount and so I can now for all those
164:38 - particles I can say update you can think
164:44 - there it goes it goes up so I actually
164:47 - now I'm realizing a couple things here
164:48 - but what I want to do right is instead
164:51 - of just having one particle I mean when
164:53 - do I want to add particles do I want to
164:55 - start with a burst of them so I add 100
164:57 - and set up so I want to have them once
164:58 - every 5 seconds so I add some sort of
165:00 - timer there's so many different ways but
165:02 - let's try for the sake of argument just
165:05 - adding one new particle every time
165:07 - through draw so I'm getting somewhere
165:11 - this is kind of you know perhaps
165:13 - somewhat like the idea smoke doesn't
165:16 - really look like smoke but I've got a
165:17 - particle system here so things that I
165:19 - would want to do yeah and then way I
165:22 - could stop here and I could say hey you
165:23 - make this more creative and interesting
165:25 - but I'm missing some key features that I
165:28 - really need to have here so first of all
165:30 - one thing that I want to try doing is I
165:32 - want to give these particles a
165:34 - transparency so let's actually give them
165:37 - a variable called alpha and we'll start
165:38 - it at 255 and I'm going to use this
165:41 - variable here in its fill this alpha and
165:46 - an update I'm gonna say this dot alpha -
165:51 - equal one or - - or something so each
165:54 - one will fade out I don't know
165:56 - - equal five let's have them fade out
165:58 - pretty fast so it's gonna lose some
166:01 - alpha with each frame so you can see
166:04 - there this is gonna hopefully help me
166:06 - have something a bit more like smoke and
166:07 - the stroke is is there so I'm still
166:10 - seeing them all so what I want to do is
166:13 - let's actually take out the outline
166:16 - color we can see okay how did I do
166:22 - oh let's roast a marshmallow by the
166:26 - white circular fire delicious okay
166:31 - so actually in a way I'm kind of done
166:32 - but there's there's some more things I
166:35 - should really think about here number
166:36 - one is hmm after I run this for a while
166:40 - it's gonna start really being really
166:42 - really slow
166:43 - for example particles I could look in
166:46 - the console here particles dot length
166:47 - there's eight hundred thirty particles
166:49 - right now but I don't need eight hundred
166:52 - thirty particles right and if I look at
166:55 - it now there's a thousand fifty
166:56 - particles I'm adding new particles every
166:58 - frame but I'm never getting rid of them
167:00 - so I want to make sure that I remove
167:03 - particles so there's a different ways I
167:06 - could do this I think one way that I'm
167:08 - going to try to do this is I'm going to
167:09 - remove the particles when their alpha
167:12 - becomes less than zero so one way to do
167:16 - that is with the splice function and so
167:21 - if I come back to this main loop I could
167:24 - say if so one thing I might add I'm
167:26 - gonna say if particles index I is to
167:30 - delete iterative function that's kind of
167:32 - a weird name I want this function to
167:35 - delete - tell me true or false whether I
167:36 - should delete it it's like a question -
167:38 - delete delete finish maybe I'll just
167:41 - call it like finished then I want to
167:44 - remove this particle so let's write that
167:47 - function first so I'm gonna call this
167:50 - function finished and basically I'm just
167:54 - gonna return this dot alpha less than
167:58 - zero so it's a little bit weird
168:00 - I'm just writing return the results of
168:03 - this alpha less than zero so this not
168:05 - alpha is less than when it's less than
168:07 - zero this will evaluate to true or it
168:09 - will evaluate to false so this function
168:11 - is either going to return true or false
168:13 - and it's true when alpha when it's faded
168:15 - out I don't want to display it anymore
168:16 - so let's actually put that stroke back
168:19 - just so we can see it and then let me
168:24 - how do I remove a particle why could
168:27 - actually say particles dot splice I
168:29 - comma one so I happen to know this
168:31 - already but the splice function is a
168:33 - function that removes an element from
168:34 - the array at position I and just that
168:37 - one element so I could put it two there
168:40 - and remove that one and the one after it
168:41 - that's not what I want to do
168:57 - so now look at this you can see them
169:00 - getting removed now something weird is
169:02 - happening you see this like weird like
169:04 - flickery like thing so there's a little
169:06 - bit of an issue I've I've covered this
169:08 - in so many different videos I'm not sure
169:11 - if I should cover it here and just point
169:12 - to it but I'm gonna I think I will cover
169:14 - it here really briefly so I just
169:18 - realized you need to erase this
169:36 - so there's other ways around this and in
169:39 - many ways if I took out the stroke I
169:41 - wouldn't have this problem visually but
169:43 - what's happening here is if I have an
169:46 - array that has a bunch of spots in it
169:48 - and I call these like people a particle
169:50 - a particle B particle C particle D
169:54 - particle E and these are in spots 0 1 2
169:59 - 3 4 well what happens is if I'm
170:04 - iterating over this if I'm saying
170:06 - check spot zero should I delete it nope
170:09 - check spot 1 should I delete it nope
170:12 - check spot two should I delete it let's
170:16 - say yes I should delete it so I delete
170:18 - this one and now I have the array looks
170:20 - like this it has instead of having 1 2 3
170:23 - 4 5 it has 1 2 3 4 things in it PA PB P
170:29 - D and PE 0 1 2 3 so the next one I
170:36 - should check is number 3 right which is
170:38 - the last one notice what happened I was
170:40 - here
170:41 - so these shifted over and then I went to
170:43 - the next one which actually I ended up
170:45 - skipping PD so so this could be a
170:48 - problem and a way that I could deal this
170:50 - is just go backwards because I'm going
170:52 - backwards I check this when I check this
170:53 - one then I check this one if I remove it
170:55 - these shift over it doesn't matter I'm
170:56 - not affecting the beginning of the array
170:57 - and in some ways this is less of an of
171:01 - an important issue right here but it is
171:03 - this is the thing you need to be
171:04 - thinking about if you're using a counter
171:06 - and iterating over the right like if
171:07 - ideally we're on adding stuff to the
171:09 - array that's also really good be a
171:10 - problem never get to the end and I'll be
171:12 - stuck in an infinite loop so here's a
171:14 - way around that I'm gonna start at the
171:16 - end of the array particles length minus
171:18 - 1 then I'm going to say greater than I'm
171:22 - gonna go down to 0 and say I minus minus
171:24 - just gonna go in the array backwards and
171:27 - now you can see was the stuff fades out
171:30 - it disappears there's no more weird
171:31 - flickering there's a little weird that
171:33 - they just disappear suddenly but this is
171:35 - mostly just because of the fact that
171:38 - they have this stroke on them now I'm
171:41 - only removing them when I can't see them
171:43 - so now if I look at
171:45 - particles dot length is only 51
171:50 - particles and I run this for another a
171:51 - few seconds while I'm talking and
171:52 - there's still only 51 and there's still
171:54 - only 51 so the timing is working out
171:56 - such that there's only ever going to be
171:57 - 51 so how could I make this look more
172:00 - like smoke well one thing that might be
172:03 - important to play with is how many
172:05 - particles do I want to add each frame so
172:12 - this is now five particles per frame
172:14 - whoops and oh sorry this needs to be
172:19 - inside the loop so you can see here you
172:23 - know does this look more like smoke left
172:25 - like smoke but so that's one parameter
172:28 - here that's important to work on but
172:30 - here is really what I think is important
172:32 - number one is oh I didn't even add any
172:34 - acceleration so like adding some type of
172:37 - acceleration so I'm not going to do this
172:39 - in this video but this is what you want
172:41 - to think about what's a different way
172:43 - that you could pick initial velocities
172:44 - should those velocities change over time
172:47 - what are you actually are using color
172:48 - what shape are you drawing do the size
172:51 - of those circles vary are you can you
172:54 - make it feel like something that's not
172:56 - smoke or fire but more like a confetti
172:58 - bursts or something fireworks I have
173:00 - another coding challenge where I do
173:01 - fireworks which is pretty similar to so
173:03 - there's a lot of possible things you
173:05 - could do and so I'm gonna end this here
173:07 - with this code and I look forward to a
173:10 - thousand particle flower systems
173:12 - blooming please share them with me
173:16 - hashtag on Twitter particle train
173:19 - particle trade particle train particle
173:22 - train no what's that song particle it's
173:25 - particle man's that they might be done
173:26 - the particle train is good
173:27 - so hashtag particle train on Twitter I
173:31 - would love to see love gifts and
173:32 - animations of all your particle systems
173:33 - that you make share your code and I look
173:36 - forward to seeing you in my next coding
173:38 - challenge alright everybody I think this
173:48 - is the end so I don't know how did I do
173:52 - I did an extra thing it is now 6:35
173:57 - and it's time for me to go I will
174:00 - happily answer a few last questions I'm
174:08 - looking at my phone I'm getting updates
174:11 - about the Yankees game I need to show
174:19 - the eye - what - equals one in the
174:21 - for-loop oh oh yeah I could also so this
174:24 - is a good point another strategy thank
174:27 - you for this another strategy I could do
174:29 - is just like as I'm going through the
174:31 - loop and things shift over I could just
174:33 - set I back and like no and say I minus
174:36 - one so I could have done that that's a
174:38 - very good thing did the sound oh you
174:43 - guys are okay alright everybody thank
174:49 - you to everyone I appreciate all of your
174:52 - comments even when you're asking when
174:53 - I'm gonna do the Agha Rio part 3 or a
174:55 - machine-learning school the Chrome
174:57 - extensions is the one I really could get
174:59 - to and I term those are all those things
175:00 - I'm coming they're coming
175:02 - there's only I if I could do this every
175:03 - day think about how many things they
175:05 - could get through except I have to there
175:07 - are certain things as you know as with
175:09 - the chat BOTS that I have to kind of
175:10 - research and practice a little bit I
175:12 - think it makes the tutorials a little
175:14 - bit better to be honest and certain
175:15 - things I could kind of do off-the-cuff
175:16 - like like this particular one so goodbye
175:21 - song people like this alright alright so
175:24 - this is going to go for two and a half
175:26 - minutes and I'm gonna just sort of read
175:27 - the chat and see if I can answer any
175:30 - questions
175:31 - plans for the next livestream so next
175:34 - Friday I'm hoping to continue the chat
175:36 - bots stuff to do the p5 speech thing and
175:39 - maybe an Alexa skill as well as more
175:41 - object and Ray videos get those done
175:44 - Yeah right it could pop removes the
175:51 - object from the array but can we push at
175:53 - the end yes
175:55 - Lorenz and is asking which is the
175:57 - firework one if somebody could help out
175:59 - and post a link to the fireworks coding
176:01 - challenge in the chat that would be
176:03 - great it's the couldn't challenge number
176:04 - something to just go to the coding
176:06 - challenge playlist there's 70 some of
176:08 - them now you'll find it yeah before I do
176:12 - the Alexis skill I want to have the
176:14 - Alexa in here working and it doesn't
176:17 - work on the NYU wireless unless I
176:19 - authenticate it in some way so when are
176:22 - these videos going to be released so
176:24 - what happens is you have more gaming
176:26 - challenges I know people are interested
176:28 - in that working on these videos so what
176:32 - happens is after today Matt at math
176:36 - blank on Twitter helps edit them and
176:39 - release them as separate videos this
176:41 - live stream will stay archived forever
176:43 - you know it's available immediately
176:44 - after this end it goes to unlisted so
176:47 - you might have to be clever to find the
176:49 - link or ask me for it but it'll be
176:51 - probably made public tomorrow or the
176:52 - next day and the videos will come out I
176:54 - can't try to release one new video per
176:56 - day I don't know in theory like
176:57 - spreading them out is better than
176:59 - replacing them all at once API is
177:03 - definitely something I would love to
177:04 - look at papa bane I would love to keep
177:08 - track look at your particle system yes
177:11 - can you allow links to your own videos I
177:14 - have to add dot because of the spam
177:16 - filter oh yeah I don't know if someone
177:20 - tells me how to do that I'm happy to do
177:21 - that right now it has to be someone who
177:23 - has moderator privileges
177:27 - great so Topher I mean I cover it not
177:30 - you know there's a lot to making Alexis
177:32 - kill button if we need to go over the
177:33 - basics is p5 shader support on the way
177:38 - there was a lot of work I really need to
177:41 - do a video exploring WebGL again
177:42 - somebody helped me remember that but
177:44 - there's been a lot of work over the
177:45 - summer that I mentioned by Stahl Jia and
177:48 - Kate and
177:49 - apologize for missing their full names
177:50 - or the Twitter handles but did google
177:52 - Summer of Code about WebGL mp5 and I
177:55 - think probably someone needs to
177:56 - volunteer to really help work on that
177:58 - shader support there is some of the
177:59 - progress worked I don't know where this
178:02 - [Music]
178:03 - Alexa skill Alexa is the Amazon echo
178:06 - product where you can create a your own
178:09 - chat bot you can release on Alexa for
178:11 - people to interact with okay thank you
178:16 - anybody uh one last question I wonder if
178:19 - your pupil students watch your streams I
178:21 - really hope not I mean I have fun doing
178:25 - this and I'm glad that people appreciate
178:26 - it but sometimes I worry about it okay
178:30 - anyway so thank you everybody I will see
178:32 - you next Friday for another coding train
178:36 - episode and enjoy your weekend and your
178:41 - week and take some time away from your
178:43 - code do something nice for somebody and
178:46 - all that stuff okay thank you dolly for
178:49 - posting Kate Holland back as her last
178:50 - name installed gia also has a last name
178:53 - two students who did google Summer of
178:55 - Code you can check out in processing org
178:56 - medium ok pac-man pac-man probably needs
179:00 - multiple parts it's a longer project I'm
179:02 - gonna have to dedicate a whole session
179:04 - for that probably alright goodbye
179:06 - everybody it's a different time rembu
179:09 - sighs it's a different time every week
179:10 - you check Friday morning Easter time I
179:12 - usually set the time it's usually
179:14 - mid-afternoon but I like doing in the
179:15 - morning if I can alright good bye
179:18 - everybody
179:19 - have a good rest of your time okay stop
179:24 - straight

Cleaned transcript:

coating train Friday afternoon take two okay so let's see here um you guys hear me am I here am I not frozen is this actually the coding train how's my volume what better way to test my volume then reading some random numbers fiftyone thousand and seven eighty thousand seven hundred and thirtyfour 7258 74 thousand seven hundred twentyeight the volume sounds great now wonderful how's the balance between me and the music because it's Friday off the coding train and I'm talking into a microphone with music playing alright let us begin what are you watching just a strange corner of the internet it is true is what you are watching but my name is Dan Schiffman I am here every Friday and I have this like plan where maybe possibly I might also be here on other days of the week sometimes working on that stay tuned for 2018 which is another year after this year I also know from many of you that I've heard that the time that it is now which is approximately 345 Eastern Daylight Time it's the middle of a night for you or at least of the time that you're going to bed and I apologize for that I know that last week I did livestream in the morning my time which a lot of you enjoyed and some of you wasn't as convenient for so I will try to as much as I should probably actually set a specific time I will also try to vary the time using my handy random numbers all right I'm looking the balances fine the music could be louder I turned it down that's exciting to know all right so I am so this is the thing you would think that if only I had the time to like arrive here in this room in the morning and look through some stuff and makes them todo lists and think about things and answer questions and make a plan that this would be an organized helpful useful livestream about learning to code unfortunately what happens to me is I'm like around doing this and this turning out to this email got on this thing on the table and then I just become this room then none of the equipment works and I'm trying to remember which button to press and I'm live streaming I realized like I have no idea no idea what my plan is but I have to keep talking because of that I said we'll be dead air but actually this is video so if I'm silent and I just move perhaps it's fine low music so I'm looking at the chat don't turn the music louder do you Dan do you like Lady gaga you know Lady Gaga I believe let me we shouldn't graduate particularly she was a student here at Tisch at one point maybe she's in the hallway this is a hallway fresh air comes in from the hallway there is sunlight through the windows in the hallway but instead I'll just close this door and be in this strange this is by the way a storage closet I am in a storage closet with some file cabinets where some cameras and desks and computer equipment have haphazardly been set up oh and I've got the glare thing again so let's see if I can just set this light let me move this light okay all right so here I obtained you guys is the light okay this looks it looks I look very dark I will start doing something at some point let me try to fix this light I feel like kind of like extra dark I should you know I should probably do this before I start live streaming right this is not going very well there we go it's a little bit better okay oh oh that's me over here okay now I'm coming back alright so I actually have some stuff that I want to cover today what do I want to do so last week I should do some like introductory like stuff about what this is but I mean I'll get to that in a second last week I started introducing the topic of objectoriented programming with classes in es6 javascript everybody was just waiting to hear about that's what they wanted to spend their day hearing about so I want to continue that I'm slowly making my way through many videos from my introduction to JavaScript programming course that used a previous style of creating objects using a constructor function and I'd like to redo all those videos so I'm gonna at least try to do two or three do two or three of those videos today so I'll try to get a little further with that and introduce arrays with objects I also have been teaching recently about chat BOTS so I have a little presentation that I meant to look at before I got here I want to talk about chat BOTS and program a simple chat bot using p5.js in the browser browser by chat bot I mean just like a computer program that talks to you with text and so that can mean so many different things there's so many different frameworks and I will get to that sort of stuff at some point I eventually whoa there's a little bit hold on a sec don't want to get water as you know on the Kotick train it's always important to stay hydrated however this water bottle which is producing a lot of condensation right now this is very near the electronic equipment so let me deal with that you're watching a person drinking water on the Internet that's what you're doing right now you realize that right there was a point oh yes this was gonna be a prop Alexa what's the weather today oh okay what hey Google is this thing on computer make me a vegan turkey sandwich it's not working so I think I have to get an actual Alexa or something like that up here I will try to do that there's a sort of a weird problem where the flexible connect to the NYU WiFi so to figure that out I want to work on doing a coding challenge building an Alexa skill but before I get to that I want to try to use some just free and open source tools to make a chatbot and have computer talk to you with speech to text or text to speech wherever that thing is okay so that's on my list for today let's see what else this has been a rough week what are some things I went about oh whoa I'm so excited I got to talk about a couple things so first of all you are watching the coding train for more information about the coding drain you can to the coding train calm look at that look the coding trains currently live there I am I don't think he can hear that though so so things that you can do if you want to support the work that I'm doing is you can subscribe apparently YouTube likes it or they give you something they give you stuff when people subscribe to your channel like silver things to hang on your wall you can become a patron which is a way of a crowdfunding system to support the work that I'm doing and I am using those funds to hopefully make more videos and do more things in the future that's something you can do you could also help me figure out how to make this website nicer look at this this is kind of great I've done this stick before with the thing and live and the same time it's going back and forth please more volume so that's one thing I wanted to say now one of the things that I've discovered recently on the coding train is the Hat there's this whole community of people out there make watching and making stuff and me I am so me has come on board to help me manage some community projects where people could contribute code and apparently it's like hack tober fest I actually don't know what that is I should know what that is I guess that's run by a digital ocean and I think that if you do something where it's like at least four pull requests or something you can get a tshirt so anyway I don't know if you're interested in participating in this hack Tober fest you could consider contributing to one of these community projects now community projects what are these I'm very excited to report that the coding train twelve O'Clock project which is a project inspired by hold on a sec I just google to find things because I'm so unprepared by John Maeda worldrenowned artist extraordinaire John Midas 1990s work making these twelve clock designs this is an art piece that's in the permanent collection of MoMA and it only works on an OS 9 machine so Golan Levin who teaches a class at carnegie mellon it would spy helped inspire this clock challenge put up this documentation of these animated gifts he got the the clocks to run on an old emulator and we here we roll we hear me or maybe somebody outside this idea who knows I thought let's see if we can recreate all these clocks in p5.js and I am pleased to report that if I go here and click on this URL I have all of these clocks ported to p5.js now me I am so me and many of the contributors have painstakingly looked at all sorts of details to really see if they're accurate but we could always do more of this this is an ongoing continuing project it's great that all these ports are here and I believe if I click on this we can see here a list of many of the contributors there all sorts of like interesting features that I don't know Oh Topher J and the chat is asking if the stream froze is it just Topher or a Topher's back but what now it's frozen for everybody although the game of life thing is still animating so I think I can click oh look at this I can click on it I get a big I don't even know I could do this I mean I am so music genius and probably somebody else who actually added this feature I could see this clock closer up and we can see a link a referent a link to the github user who helped to port this clock and many of these clocks were ported by multiple users and you can see there even here in the list wow this is incredible this is like the greatest thing ever so this is the clock now community project number two clouds coding trained community clouds so I'm gonna go to this year now now this is actually a project for day processing org so processing Day is a community day to celebrate the community of processing that's happening on October 21st that's the two weeks from today Yanks well it's weeks from tomorrow in Cambridge Massachusetts I will be there I'm apparently gonna do some sort of like live coding Train episode I mean this is live but live in person where my legs will be seen for the very first time let's see if I can make that happen now oh this is gonna if I get injured so then it was nice it was nice getting this like month of live streams there we go okay so I will be there with my legs and on October 21st and so one of the ideas for this conference and the thing that I'm going to do for the live code and train up sewed is making a cloud design but the idea for the name tags and I think this came from Tim choy and other organizers of the event is to have each nametag have the name inside of an algorithmic cloud so this website shows all of these clouds and I think maybe there's a way I can just with the arrow keys I don't know if that feature has been added yet is it like every once in a while changing the cloud oh if I click it just goes to a new cloud so we can see all these different cloud designs oh look at that beautiful and so you still have some time to submit a cloud and your design will be on a nametag at the processing Community Day event so if you want to learn more about how to submit a cloud go to the github repository there are some instructions there just file an issue I will say however that the deadline I mean this is an ongoing project I hope these clouds will live on forever and maybe be reused again another time for a different purpose but were probably going to print the actual name tags early next week you know Monday or Tuesday so let's just arbitrarily say that Monday morning October 9th is the deadline Monday morning Eastern Time like 900 a.m. is the deadline to submit your cloud if you want to make sure that it's has a chance to be printed and maybe will be a little late looks up relate but that's what I'll guarantee for right now okay so now loyal viewer of the coding train Simon Tiger who lives in Europe who is seven years old mind you has created a community project as well called procedural designs now I'm trying to figure out where am I gonna find this we're I'm gonna find Simon's URL hold on let's go let's try github.com slash Simon Tiger what's the chance that that's right no I'm gonna have to look this up somebody in the looking old music Simon Tiger interesting so am I in the right place github calm slash Simon Tiger / procedural designs dunt dunt uh is it like Simon Tiger there we go Simon Tiger so um you can come here to see and let's look at the site and the idea this is inspired I think if by community clouds and but it allows you to submit something that's animated so well as the clouds or static designs and I Simon writes here there will be a new theme every month the theme this month the four elements water air fire earth so this is not an official community project but it is a community project that is created by Simon there's a loyal viewer and if people can provide some nice feedback or try test it out for him that would be wonderful and I would be glad to help with that okay what else I've got ah okay now the other thing is I have done some coding challenges recently and I am just amazed by if I go to whoops hashtag twitter.com hashtag ten print can you guys hear that music I just played in the classroom next to me so I've mentioned this book many times ten print I just have like books turn about the floor apparently here and there have been so many wonderful variations of the ten print design I encourage you to check out the Twitter hashtag ten print and my 10 print coding challenge if you want to keep that going on Twitter and also the new hashtag Ike which I think I need to workshop this a little more for the most recent coding challenge about recursion if I go to hashtag recursive train you can see that we're starting to get some submissions here so here's some nice variations by fire fluid on Twitter of the recursive design stuff that I showed in a previous coding challenge these are some kind of interesting ones it looks like this is combining recursion and ten print which exactly what chaos once on Twitter says this is quite beautiful oh and look so this let me actually click on the open processing link and there goes the camera which means I've been doing this for a half an hour this is called fractal oyd I think I'm not gonna oh this must respond to my microphone hello whoa this responds to sound oh oh here we go as always I always forget to this stop it stop it stop this dock awesome work and though this is a nice one I hadn't seen before by valu thick on Twitter and look at these I see some colorful ones coming up this is exciting look at these whoo I love this is beautiful love the choice of color and the variation of the circles so and nothing like a rainbow sierpinski triangle to bring joy to wednesday wonder if oh this is kind of crazy look at this so there's so many wonderful recursive designs that you can find on Twitter you can also I don't know if people have been doing this actually I haven't been keeping good track but if I go to coding train the code repository for the coding challenges and go all the way to the bottom and look at recursive design recursion there are none yet here so you can also pull requests and add links to your variations of the recursive design coding challenge I think this ends the introductory portion of today's Friday's coding train and so with that I am ready to actually start doing some coding but I will take a minute there's a little black mark on okay hold on there's a little black mark on the green screen if you go to a white page on your computer you will see it around the top right might be nice to fix it okay let's see so let me investigate this hold music please oh yeah look it's right there I see it wait over here what is that this it's not a black mark it is a cable a cable connecting a camera so let's see how do I get this out of the way is it this cable it's this cable it's actually this cable so I have my tricep muscles have fairly rich Burton hopefully my physical excellently there we go this is a good physical therapy live on the floating train a physical therapist I like erasing the whiteboard just good physical therapy cable tape problem resolved all right I feel like I look dark but maybe it's just if I come over here I'm out of the light over here so that's because I turned this light because of the glare issue lemme just see here how how much can I turn it more this way that's not so bad let's do that that's not such bad glare okay all right so I I am how what is it this is like don't tell me it's for oh my god it's four o'clock already it's okay what's the score of Red Sox versus Astros anybody no I'm not gonna watch that game later so I'm happy to be told in the chat baseball fans anybody okay five o'clock Yankees play Cleveland okay now I will take a minute to answer a few questions one of which I already know what it is is hey hey you coding train you had this video series about machine learning what happened to it so let me talk about that for a little bit and actually I think I might edit take this portion and edit it out to make a quick video because every time I produce a video now at least five of the comments are why aren't you making your machine learning videos that's what I'm here for and probably actually I'm projecting more likely the comment is like this you know just wondering I'm kind of interested in that machine learning stuff are you gonna get back to that so let me talk about that so where's my playlist do I have a playlist about machine learning by the way somebody asks why I was not subscribed to Suraj's channel when he was a guest here and it is because I am logged in on some like dummy count which is coding rainbow live at gmail.com don't email that address I'll never check it but why not have why not subscribe to YouTube channels also what's the one three blue brown what's that math channel that's awesome three blue brown Houston is winning four to one fifth inning three blue one brown okay so let me subscribe to that channel to 90,000 subscribers good work three blue brown uploads here we go would you guys mind if we just watch this video together would that be an appropriate use of this light stroking time probably not okay let me go to Suraj's channel and what's the interplanetary file system I have no idea what that is because I have to watch that later let me go to the coding training look how I just procrastinate for max doing any actual coding because I thought I was gonna answer their questions oh I see I'm not logged in as myself that's what's ultimately really confusing me here we go well have you thought I have you thought about exploring machine learning this is the class on udemy taught by an expert instructor you can make bro Busta models you should definitely consider that none of this nonsense here alright so okay so let me talk about this watching hello I'm here I am here mostly to apologize please stop don't throw the tomatoes the green wall will have Tomatoes flats on them but I'm here just to give a quick update about the my machine learning videos that I have a playlist called ten neuro networks the nature of code I was making these videos over the summer then I had this moment where I was like riding along on a bicycle and I was thinking way too much about machine learning I had a bump fell over I broke my elbow I had surgery on it twice I lost a couple months of like being able to make content and then the fall started so unfortunately I was in the middle of this series I was at ten point seven I had made seven videos that's crazy and every time I upload a video now comments asking could I please continue that series and I am planning to continue it what I do here on the coding train is I make videos about stuff that I'm currently teaching at my fulltime job here at New York University and currently what I'm teaching is an introduction to programming course and of course about text analysis so I am going to be making some videos about chatbots which is kind of adjacent to machine learning can be a tool to drive a chatbot I'm also gonna make some videos about hopefully long term short long short term I can't remember I don't have long or short term memory but some of these recurrent neural networks for text generation and then I my hope is that I will be coming back to this playlist again after this semester is over or towards the end of the semester if I finished up some of the content so in the meantime I hope to continue to have some github repositories where I'm gonna be making some new examples so stay in touch with me on Twitter and I would recommend to you well as you've seen as a guest on my channel Suraj has a channel about deep learning and also this is a new video that just came out from one of my favorite channels three blue one Brown but what is a neural network deep learning part one so now we have an internet competition will deep learning part to come out before ten point eight the answer is almost a definite yes so please write all of your complaints in the comments here I'm going to read them I'm going to sit with some sort of like meditative cucumber eye mask thing on and I'm going to listen to all of your feedback about why I should do this right now and the other stuff that I'm doing now and then I will feel guilty for a while and then eventually these videos will come out okay so thanks for watching this short little video explanation and I'll see you soon all right the sound is off everybody is telling me all sorts of technical stuff so that ad was super targeted right right it was like look you're gonna watch some crazy lunatics video about neural networks would you like to watch this absolutely sane you'dyou'd how do you say that you Demi you to me you to me I'm never gonna get them as a sponsor now and their ads gonna be removed from all my videos shortly I'm sure they're wonderful people over it you to me it's like Academy but you to me so it must be you to me so instead of it instead of Academy for the icons it's the udemy for the use you got it now alright um three blue brown you make some wonderful videos support three boob on support Siraj support oh look at this oh my goodness okay oh is the sound sticking off let's try so he's talking to me it sounds like the teachers in Charlie Brown won't long cuz just coming through the you know soundproof room I'm definitely to get to some coding soon swear swear I affirm I affirm I will get to some coding soon I remembered one other thing I wanted to mention I'm changing something here to do multi output device okay so now I think you can hear the audio and I'm going to go to SoundCloud so Christian Petersen or Christian Peterson I'm not sure if I'm pronouncing this correctly is keeping a playlist on soundcloud of coding train remixes best is where the biscuit song originally came from and there is another this song made by f looper the creator of the Perlin noise song which I play a lot and there's some other ones the loading song by Ike Bishop this is I haven't been able to add these to my on board yet so this is a new one called minime me so while I get ready to figure out what I'm gonna do I'm gonna play this song for you guys now a little contest here who can figure out which video this came from the fastest I don't know I don't have a prize for this contest but a shoutout will give a prize all right can you actually can you guys actually hear this oh that was the end of the song okay so let's put on the loading song I like that I'm just reading Twitter okay ah I'm getting ready to do some coding music okay thank you much maybe s can hear the people okay I got I got to turn this off I got a I got a start I've lost my the temperature in here is very wor okay all right so now what I want to do is talk about chatbots so this is this is I'm gonna do the object stuff but I sort of felt like if I did the object stuff that I would never get to the chatbot stuff that I want to do today so my goal is to so let me see here sorry I have to like plan this while I'm here with you guys so if I go to is there a programming with text one here no 15 so let's see here playlists I'm looking for my atoz playlists I really have to be logged into my own account all right I'll figure this out so this is gonna be a new this is going to be a new series of videos for the A to Z course it used to be called the A to Z it's called the A to Z course but I'm from YouTube I'm calling a program in with text because it's kind of an advanced course why don't you use a fan fan working here you think the client I think it's because I'm in a storage closet that there isn't really good climate control in this room so I have a little presentation that NACHA helped me with and so I mean this is a new experiment for me which is to actually like walk through some slides as if I like had a plan for what I was doing and talked a little bit about chatbots then I'm gonna do a tutorial about a chatbot framework called rive script and then I want to do a coding challenge or show you how to use this chat bot framework rive script which is open source with p5 GS and the brown this will lead me to eventually show you how to do speech to text in the browser so your chat bot could actually listen to what you're saying and talk back to you as if you were programming your own Alexa kind of our Google home type to a conversational interface from scratch we've only opensource tools and then I also want to explore using some not necessarily opensource tools like what does it does it need to make a skill for something like a product like the Amazon Alexa so I have materials for all of this already with my A to Z course I'll include links to that in whatever video descriptions I make and yes so this will this probably happen over the next couple weeks a little bit today a little bit next week so let's begin with that now I'm looking at the chat all right so hello welcome to the first video in a new section of my programming with text series so this kind of follows on the Twitter bot series because what I want to look at in this section is how to make a chat bot so now we can just think of that this term bot in a much more general way I mean Twitter bot could be a chat bot chat bot could be a Twitter bot I don't know what's the difference so when I think about BOTS I am this is straight from Wikipedia but a chat bot this is what I'm talking about I want to think about ways that I can make a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods so this could be a onesided conversation I could just be a Twitter bot that just says things every once in a while to nobody or to myself I could be two computers talking to each other I could be a computer and a human I could talk to my ok Expo what's the weather today oh shoot this thing does not actually how many electronics or speeches well but if I add like some sort of product from some company that I'm not gonna buzz market right now for free because he just sponsored me no not really I would show you that so I'm gonna get to all that sort of stuff in these videos series there's gonna be a lot of them this is just the first one so I want to think about where this topic comes from so of course many of you are probably familiar with Alan Turing and Alan Turing's question oh wait a second I'm sorry get the chat but you were looking at the chat I this is the thing I gotta stop I you know there's you shouldn't be stuff it's edited out ever but anyway okay oops I don't know it slides are coming next as I'm not prepared let's keep going Turing test is probably something that you you may be familiar with if not I'll include some links for further reading in this alright hold on pause I just ran what's the seminal paper called the Alan Turing paper it's called can machines think right where where the imitation game is proposed don't look at this machines think nobody's answered my question I do have a reddit AMA but I'm never gonna get through this if I'm gonna like try to like do some research like remember what the names of things are what's the paper called somebody's gonna tell me nobody's nobody's telling me this I'm just gonna keep going okay this is me reading Wikipedia backwards really fat is like it's entering my brain Papa thought yes I'm really looking at this in the wrong order the wrong order Computing Machinery and intelligence that's what I have here no wonder I just couldn't remember that thank you we're gonna get through this everybody you and me together so this idea of a chatbot of a computer that's having a conversation is nothing new we can we can date this research back to Alan Turing the seminal paper Computing Machinery and intelligence inspiration for the movie the the the imitation game can a computer think can a computer have a conversation much like a human being might have a conversation are their imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game eliza is an example of a chatbot created about the MIT artificial intelligence library in 1966 it simulated a conversation using pattern matching and substitution so this is really a key key points here so what does it mean to program a chatbot what are some techniques and styles for doing that and you might be thinking I know deep learning neural networks super artificial intelligent magic computer machine thing but one way to develop a chatbot that's actually quite powerful and is the way that I'm gonna start with some simple examples is by doing simple pattern matching and substitution by that I mean I'm trying to match a pattern in something that the person the human being or the other side of the conversation is saying and I have a database of replies for different patterns that I might match so Eliza's a wellknown a chatbot example perry is another one from 1972 created by Kenneth Colby at Stanford which attempted to simulate a person with paranoid schizophrenia so informally known as Eliza with attitude there is the lobe no prize which is an annual competition artificial intelligence that Awards a prize to the Chatterbox considered by the judges to be the most humanlike you know I think it's you know one could be critical about this you know a little worried I'm gonna I'm gonna it's alright everything's gonna be fine but I keep going through this I'm standing in front of the slides is like I'm not really like meant for this but so I think one question about the Loebner prize is is this is is this really is this is evaluating a computer's abilities to trick a human being into thinking it's a human actually a appropriate metric or measure of some form of intelligence or ability to carry out a conversation or is it just a metric of being able to foolishness way of like you know the best trickery and is there what's the what's the substance behind that trickery so I think which is something a question to ask beyond just is it fooling me or not so Alice is a project from 1995 as inspired by Eliza part of out the Alice project is something called AI ml which is an artificial intelligence markup language similar to something like XML or JSON it's a format for creating a script in essence for chatbot alice is the inspiration for the Spike Jonze movie her and this is interesting because the reason why I bring this up is so this is what AI ml looks like and this is directly from the Alice bot org website so this is great but it can be a little bit unwieldy to work with so what I want to do is look at systems that work in this way with something called a retrieval model so this I want to say that most of this information is from this wonderful article which is from Wild ml calm deep learning for chat BOTS and part one so a retrieval model is a way of creating a chat bot where there are a set of predefined responses and you're doing this pattern matching so you're trying to figure out some kind of heuristic of heuristic as a fancy word for educated guess basically I'm trying to figure out like aha the user said something which slot does that fit in did the is the user saying like what's the weather or order a pizza or what is it does it match some type of pattern and I have some predefined responses for different patterns so now that's heuristic that way of making an educated guess could be a really advanced machine learning system with some kind of like neural network thing or it could just be like regular expressions and pattern matching or looking for exact phrases and so you there's a lot that you can do even with these basic ideas generative model is something I also want to look at which is a way we'll we'll use some type of algorithm a contextfree grammar or a Markov chain a recurrent neural network some type of algorithm to generate the response as opposed to having these predefined set of responses this is very similar to how machine translation systems work something else to consider really is are you building a chatbot that's going to have a short conversation or a long conversation and my and certainly you could think of it's going to be much easier so an example of a short conversation is knock knock who's there chat bot chat bot who I'm making a video about chat BOTS that wasn't very funny so that's a short conversation and you could imagine that that's going to be a much easier thing to program in some long conversation that's going to I don't know talk about some you know Ionesco ZnO exit the play and what it means to you in your life or something like that so and by the way no exit was written by Sartre not ionesco this is really not going well I don't like this whole use a presentation thing I'm just trying it as an experiment I might not use this okay another thing to consider is open domain versus closed domain conversations you know are you creating a chat bot that the only thing the person will ever do with this chat bot is order a pizza and then you have kind of a framework to say well they might say large or small or medium they might say you know broccoli is broccoli appropriate topping for pizza I don't really eat pizza whatever they you know there's a closed domain of possible things that could be discussed as opposed to openended conversation that could be just about anything so this is certainly a much easier thing I think for you to work with in programs what I want to kind of focus on right now in these tutorials are short closed domain conversations that I think is a good place to start with building a chatbot oh yeah deep learning has something to do with this there's some interesting things that we could play with if you're looking at training data to sort of look at if you're going to use a generative model or a machine learning based model there's the internet movie script database which has like tons of movie scripts which are essentially big scripts of dialogue many of them and there's the boo to dialogue corpus which is a large data set from chat rooms that's open source that you can look at with these links and there's some wonderful and interesting projects and papers that I will include trained on friends episodes and all sorts of interesting things so there are some frameworks that you can look at that I would recommend that people tell me are interesting here's a list of some of them but what I want to use in my starting tutorials it's something called Drive scripts so rie script is fertile it's open source I'm pretty sure it's MIT license I will check that I'll have to correct this if it's not it's a simple scripting language for chat BOTS with a friendly easy to learn syntax this is all from write script comm and it's you you can it has just really a handful of simple rules that you can combine and recombine it with some powerful results to create a personality so this is where I'm gonna start I'm gonna look at a variety of techniques for creating chat BOTS I'm maybe even do some coding challenges to try to make some specific chat BOTS and I hope that you will make some interesting chat bots with me now you might be asking oh I want to make something for Facebook or discord or I don't know snapchat can you make a bot for snapchat probably not you might be wondering about this so I'm gonna stay pretty platform agnostic for at least the beginning and just look at systems and principles and you could plug in to other systems but at some point I will try to take a look just like I did with the Twitter bot series of some specific services that you might want to plug into where your thing that you're making has a conversation okay so I don't know if this video was useful or not but you just hear on the internet now and you have watched it and I will see you where I'll actually do some coding soon in the next video where I introduce Rhys script okay yeah pizza really is good I do like to eat pizza it's just you know I tried very I try to be very healthy eater not that pizza is unhealthy nothing unhealthy about pizza but you know if that's all anyway I don't know I'm talking about now okay right lactose intolerance that's really my problem cheese though is that really lactose I don't know it's one of your five a day oh yes it is okay the reason why I got a little paranoid there is that I'm very I like to be incredibly conscientious about crediting sources and this is some slides I made for a my class and I think a bit differently about things that I might show in a class if I'm quoting from something whereas I do versus things that I might show on this live stream so I got a little worried that like is you know did I not properly credit these so anyway so I'm gonna I'm gonna just sort of double check that but okay alright I'm having a little trouble today it's 430 what's the score of the Red Sox game now he's still waiting go Astros alright so let's see here it's so warm in here today I'm going to open this door for some fresh air for a second okay so here's rife script I should just start with the object stuff I feel unprepared for this tutorial is a really important this is a really excellent page and I had some notes I wrote down weird I them so what I'm gonna do is I am going to yeah I'm just scanning through this to remind myself about rice scripts okay all right okay so are you guys ready for this we are going to actually we are actually going to thank you Chris virgin four to one in the six inning okay we are actually going to do some stuff with rice crib now let me go to try it and I think rice script playground might work better yeah okay and all right okay and then what I need to do I think is probably dude this great and this okay here we go ready we're gonna make our first bot so this is going to be a quick tutorial of what is rice script and some of its features and it's bear with me for a second remember what these things are called write command symbol okay command symbol okay here we go everybody hello welcome to my first video beyond my introductory video about making chat BOTS and again I am using something called rive script and open source an open source library for chat BOTS a link to the github repository thank you to the creators and maintainer zuv rive scripts it's a wonderful project I've used it and a lot of things before I really enjoy using it so I'm gonna try to show you a bit about how it works I am not some sort of official representative of the rive script project I'm just a user and fan of write script so the idea oh boy the idea of Rive script is to is pattern matching is a is it it's basically a chatbot system that uses a technique called pattern matching and retrieval oh those are the right terms let me describe to you what I the user says something hello that goes into the chat box brain the brain does something so this is input and then gives a reply hi we could actually make a chat I know it's shocking I know we could program a chat bot that does this any time the user says ha hello and then that could be typed in or spoken in depending on what sort of what our interactive what our what medium we're we're kind of deploying this chat bot says hello and the reply which the word reply has an L in it guess we're wondering it says hi so rive script is the thing that i want to use here I want it to be the brain of the chat bot it's not the only option in the world for programming or creating a chat bot brain but it is one option I am going to start at least by using javascript and p5.js to take my input and display my reply so I'm gonna build a simple chat bot that just runs in the browser programmed with JavaScript in the p5 just library but I'm gonna have its brain driven by RIE script and this brain uses a technique called pattern matching so ultimately there are so many different kinds of things we could put into this brain that are super sophisticated but one thing I could actually do is just say did the users say exactly this word hello or did it say the word hello or hi or howdy can I match one of these possible phrases that the user said and if it said one of these possible phrases that I'm gonna say this exact reply this is the idea of Rive script and so every rive script is really just a markup syntax for configuring different sorts of expected patterns much like a regular expression if you look at my regular tutorials that you might expect the user to say and the replies that should come with those patterns so every so the way arrives and Rui script is modeled off of something called a I M L artificial intelligence markup language which is an XML like tag based markup thing that is interesting you could also use but rive script has a bit of a simpler syntax so in ryf script every single was just a text file every single line in the text file begins with a command symbol so some possible command symbols are an exclamation point plus minus and pound or hash tag so this is just wait timeout how am i doing with the whiteboard today it's the white boy look you can see it everything seems fine there's like a gif of okay sorry okay that looks good what I was saying so for example this chat bot that I want to program would look like this hello hi which means the plus means this is the pattern I want to match as the input and the reply that I want to give to that input is the this is the reply now one thing I could do is I could have two possible replies so the first thing i can do in rai script is configure an input that i'm looking for and then give a set of possible replies and rive script will pick one of those randomly there actually isn't even a syntax for waiting these so I could say 90% of the time I want to say hi and 10% of the time I want to say howdy so you know that's a level of detail that I don't think I need right now for what I'm gonna try to demonstrate but that is possible so you might be asking the question okay if that's the basic idea well how do I learn what all the possible things I could put here are and and hopefully I'm going to show you some of them I don't actually really I don't have them memorized so I'm gonna have to like learn them and figure them out as I go a bit and and and and and how where do I learn that stuff so and and where can I test out so could I test out a brain configuration without having to write my own JavaScript code so yes yes yes all of the above just come over here with me oh look we're over here so this is the rive script website I find if you go to just rise script comm you'll come to the main web page but under here a slash Doc's tutorial this is a wonderful walkthrough of all the possible features and you can see here I'm going to skip some stuff here about you can say here here is the your first chat bot same thing that I've said exclamation point is a kind of command simple for like a configuration thing you can actually store variables and different things like that in the chat pod which I will get to so we want to be compatible with version 2.0 of Rive script and i want a plus to say hello bot and a minus to say i want to I want to look for the user saying hello bot and I want the bot say hello human so let's go and actually test this now there's something called the rice script playground and I'm gonna get rid of this part of it so here is that chat bot in the right script playground and I can say well I'm gonna say run so I can down here say hello bot and it says hello human and I'm going to say hi hi bot and it says error no match reply no no reply match so here's the first thing I want to do I would like to have something that's a catchall of response for anything I don't know about let's add that pause point to the video we're gonna look up how to do that ah catch oh I think it's just a wild card catch all triggers just start yeah that's what I thought okay I was right I didn't have to look that up okay so just like in regular expressions where you have meta characters and literal characters and this is what I'm saying here is like I want to match exactly hello notice there's no capitalization here so capitalization and punctuation don't really play a role in the patterns that you're matching you're just looking for the raw text but I can have wildcards so I couldn't say something like Apple I love apples or apples are delicious so now I'm using a wild card so Apple anything after Apple will give you one of these responses so now if I run it Apple you eats question mark apples are delicious Apple Apple Apple Apple Apple I love apples to see we even got one the different one the second time but if I say hello Apple error no reply matched so this is one way you can use a chat bot to kind of just realize that the users kind of brought up a certain topic so for example if you want to say anywhere the word Apple appears if the user says anything with Apple say like oh let's talk about apples and then I can also use a complete and total just one star as a wildcard to say like I prefer to discuss fruit so now I'm gonna run my chat bot and I'm going to say hello bot hello human and I'm gonna say I'm gonna say let's discuss pokemons and then rock group says I prefer to discuss fruit oh I love apples and oh no oh no what happened here so look at this oh I love apples ROG script is saying I prefer to discuss fruit am i still making a video about chat BOTS in this is actually like what I'm talking about oh boy hopefully this is okay here so I think what's going on here is I have Apple space star and maybe if I did Apple star like that then now I could say oh I love apples oh let's talk about apples so that space was actually matching their the Apple space star I needed to have I couldn't you I couldn't match apples okay anyway so you get the basic idea here this we could see here so this is very little like this is just like all I we've learned so far is I can match something exactly or I can match something with a wild card there are many more things that you can do I will not be able to show you all of them but I'm going to show you a couple more things pause for a second I need to drink some water and think about what I'm going to do next this is what happens right so my intention by the way for those of you watching this live stream the pizza actually so ordering pizza is actually a pretty good as an example that I see a lot on the internet for yes it's gonna make that pineapples or apples it's a very good point so I think it's my intention actually really was this morning to go through all this rice group stuff to prepare and I didn't do it so this is kind of a mess I think I think it's better if I usually I try to make videos after I've taught something in class and I usually didn't get to this in class so one thing I want to look at is variables openended tree these are all these are called triggers I forgot about that so I'll mention that I'm saying input but they're really called triggers oh yeah and that all right remember right okay okay so let's add a few more things to this chat bot now one thing that I would like to mention is that the the the these are the the plus elements without I've been calling inputs are actually called triggers so the term for that is trigger and you'll actually see in some modern chat bot systems this word called intent so we're trying to match the intention of the user what if which in what is their intention and what would i if what is it that they want to do and i need to reply accordingly so one thing that you we can do that's nice about these wildcards is we can also use what the person said in the wildcard in the reply so I can say what if the user says my name is star and I could say nice to meet you and then star so I can refer back to what they said by putting star in the these greater than Alessa so I can say my name is coding train now interestingly enough nice to meet you coding train and it didn't keep my capitalization and there's probably some way that I could configure that we could look through the documentation and that's a little bit weird that my name is coding train but so that's one thing you can do we can also have multiple stars so I could do something like my name is star star and then I could change that nice to meet you star I could be like really weird about this star 2 comma star 1 so like for example my name is Daniel she Mon nice to meet you Schiffman comma Daniel because this is a thought who likes to speak very formally so you can see here that you can match the different different stars in a particular order so again there is nothing going there's this is there's no type of learning or training I am configuring precise patterns for the bots to look for with certain replies okay I'm just looking at the chat and can we make the chap out return dynamit responses like if the user sends Bitcoin price them oh yeah okay so a question is coming up in the chat which is great which is like well what if you what if the user asks something about the weather and you wanted to say well the web the temperature today is blank so this would be some this is why I want to combine Drive script with JavaScript and I'm gonna do this in the next video but this is just essentially the script for the brain but there's no reason if I'm not if I'm using this brain in my own code that I couldn't also inject something like an API call so I will have you know there's not I could write my own program to do a lot if elseis if conditional statements and regular expressions that I don't need rive script before but riah script is a nice syntax for me able to configure a really elaborate set of possible possibilities and then I can combine that with coding to do something much more dynamic so that's really where I'm trying to go with this here so I want to look at a few more features in Rive script so substitutions is an important one let me look for that substitutions this is this can be edited out match yeah yeah I can't spell substitution yeah okay an important feature of Rive script is substitutions because you know you might have something where the the chat bot might say who is there not the chat bot do you the trigger you're looking for is who is there but the user might say who's there or who is there and so something you can do in Rive script is configure all these different substitutions meaning these are equivalent substitute I'm for I am substitute I'd for I would so you can put I m in your chat bot let's do this right here let's put this here I'm gonna add this as a substitution at the top and now I'm going to say I'm going to say I'm oh I'm just gonna change this to I'm oh I am sorry and now I'm gonna run this and I can say I am Dan Schiffman nice to meet you shift in comma Dan or I'm ship I'm Dan Schiffman same thing so now I have a substitution so this is a way that I can have this particular phrase and so one thing that you can actually do that will see is that you can have separate files that make up the brain so this thing that I'm talking about all these files can be a can have the dot rive extension and you could have many many many of these so you could have one file that just has a thousand substitutions in it and you could use that as part of the brain you could use that for multiple projects and and you could just carry that file along with you so once you've made one chatbot or you're using somebody else's chat bar you got an example chat bot you can divide things in different files to kind of keep organized and reuse stuff another key feature is variables so I think there's two more things that I want to talk about one is variables and one is sequencing so how do you do variables so I'm pretty sure that you can just do stuff like var var name equals computer and then I think nice to meet you star and and then so if the if the user says who are you you could say I am named I think this is how this works I'm actually kind of speculating I think you can set up a name and then you can say I am that name so let's see if that works who are you I am blank so that's not right so much for me just making up what rice group does let's look for it in the tutorial variables variables my name is hold on let's hold on Matthew I'm sorry to make you add at this let me so so that didn't work let me find it in the tutorial so hold on let me actually try to find it how do you set how do you said yeah var name equals tutorial and then and then where is it oh yeah this is good these are good all right you can do an or I'm gonna show this you can do optional you can do arrays all these things you can do but what I'm trying to do is how do you put a variable into the thing that's right knock knock is a great one it's an example here my name is set name set age get 8 you say get ah okay oops ah let me find that spot oops there's so many things sorry sorry everybody this is what happens when you don't prepare for class okay okay so I found this spot in the tutorial I apologize you have to if you want to display the value of variable you have to use get as well so what I missed here is I am get name so I'm gonna run this now and I'm gonna say who are you I am undefined how what did I get wrong okay Dwight what did I get wrong here set Nate I know you could say set me variables I just keep looking at the chat like someone's gonna like you I need I don't think I need it in quotes do I but I'm like scrolling like a crazy person here it's like scrolling up and down in this variables okay name yeah look at this huh why can't I just use okay oh by the way pound is not a comment it's slash slash I don't know I said pound how do I use the variable nice to meet you my name is Noah I know how to use set to set the variable know I can't believe someone just used the super chat keep it donation that's the most ridiculous thing ever that just happened thank you green person who currency is euros yeah come on come on come on come on what did I miss var name is it var name equals computer get name so I know I could well let's try putting I don't think putting this in quotes does anything who are yeah I have some examples why don't I go look at my examples so I have a chatbot workshop that I did boy this is really so let's look at this I should have looked at this first far name equals bot this means define that's what I put in my example and then I'm not using it here window botany really oh if it's not something I set it's actually this oh yeah all right thank you me I am so me so it appears that for the variables that you set up at the top you can actually retrieve their values not with get but with the keyword bot get is something that I'm going to show you in a minute that's four variables that you've set in a different way using set so maybe I'm missing a few important details here that I will try to get to but so what I need to do is if I want to retrieve that variable I use bot name so these are like kind of almost like fixed constants or settings for the particular bots so I can say now I can say who are are you and it can say I am computer the reason why this is useful is I could use bot name in all sorts of places in my chat bot and then I if I wanted to change its name later I could just change it at the top so it's a way of setting just like the reason why you might use variables and coding the same reason why you might use variables here now here's the interesting thing sometimes you might want to remember something the user says so for example let's say let's say what you what you though the user says my favorite favorite color is star now one thing I should mention is there ways of setting up specific options only that they're a valid like it has to be a number or it has to be a word or has to be one of these three words then you can have a different reply if it doesn't fit that that but but for right now I'm just gonna say my favorite color is anything and what I want to do is say oh I love and I can do set color equals star something like this too so this is this idea of in addition to displaying back what the user said I could store that in another variable now I might not have gotten this syntax exactly right let's go look at the tutorial so I'm gonna search for the part of the tutorial that's using set so yeah so set Nate set name equal star so actually what I should do is put this at the beginning and then I can say get if I want to actually use that and I could use that later too so for I did that wrong so let's do this was right set color equals star and then I could say oh I love get color and let me give myself a bit more room here so that fits in one line I know I'm gonna be standing in front of it but we can see here okay so now what I could do is if the user says my favorite color is blue oh I love blue but I haven't only spent sent something back to the user what I can actually say I am but who are you I am bought name and my favorite color is get color so this is a way now that the bot will always say back the same favorite color that the user has set so now we can say my favorite color is purple which is actually my favorite color and then I can say who are you I am a computer and my favorite color is purple so we can actually use stuff that the user is saying store that information and save it later so you could imagine if you're creating a pot to have a conversation over a period of time that's gonna remember stuff about the user this could be incredibly useful oh I'm sorry I need because it's a bot variable Thank You Simon tiger so the important thing here is the difference between bot variables which are the ones you set up at the top and other variables that you're setting during the conversation with set okay so there's a few other things I want to cover here let me look at my examples they're random multiple replies this is not so important so wild cards multiple things all right yeah oh yeah optionals is important so here oops so I have a set of examples that will include front links from this video that mostly pull from that tutorial I'm just gonna kind of show you those right now because we could spend forever like showing you each possible configuration but I think once you get the basic idea of how it works you can read through the documentation yourself and the key thing here that the key thing here that I want to demonstrate to you is the next step which is actually using this in your own program in JavaScript which is pretty exciting and interesting so this is some of an example that I have so I already talked to you about star which means match anything and you can you can say you could have different stars star one star two you can have a catchall you can match only a number so if if the if it's not a number you could you could match you could you could say back like oh please give me a number you can match only A to Z characters you can have something optional like if the user says what is your phone number or what is your number optional anything is a nice way to match a topic so if so if the this is sort of us doing this earlier you can see if the user uses the word JavaScript anywhere can you teach me to program in JavaScript you can use in other so if the user says I love purple or I love pink you could say what about red so this is a lot of this you'll notice the syntax is very similar to regular expressions and you can also use an array so I was kind of mentioning this before right you can set up an array of different options and then you could say what if the user says to anything that matches anything from that array so there are so many Possible's possible configurations that's just a little bit I'm trying to think if I missed anything else that I wanted to show you in here learning I mentioned in terms of like saving information oh and you can also have conditionals so so this is really great so one thing let's try this actually so let's try to use I think the age is a good example where the bots think of a number and the user has to like guess the number so maybe actually that's what we'll do when I get to the JavaScript example so let's not worry too much about this right now you can see that if if the if the bot says and if the user sorry if the trigger is it's always very confusing I keep saying the wrong thing if the user says and my older than you if the users age that was set up here is greater than 10 say you are I am 10 if the users age is less than or equal to 10 nope I am 10 so this is like saying that the bots age is 10 and incidentally I could make that a bot variable as well or a user set variable because maybe the user says how old the bot is I don't know so there's so many possibilities here I hope this gives you boy this is a really terribly disorganized introduction to Rive script I you know admittedly I was really figuring it out as I went I don't know write script that well but I kind of did this for myself to remind me how it is and what it does and now I want to take that next step and use rive script in a JavaScript program you could and you can use one of the things I love about writing scripts is it's open source it's MIT license and you can use it in a variety of programming languages I'm the user in JavaScript so I'll see you in the next video where I'm going to do that I saw somebody in the chat say something about this big boring yeah I feel a little like like I'm a little off my game today which I do I say every week but today okay yes rye script does support random numbers I think sort of boring boring boring okay so what I'm going to do now is hopefully gonna do something a little more interesting which is do I don't know whether this should be a coding challenge let's make this a coding challenge and have it be I mean the thing that I made already was a knockknock joke thing oh it was sequencing I forgot to mention sequencing I'm not worried okay good thank you positive feedback cuz otherwise oh this cameras off it was gonna change to that otherwise I'm gonna be reduced to saying talking to you this way to make an s boring okay so she sees all right so let's I think I'm gonna do this as a coding challenge I'm going to generate it's five o'clock and then I'm going to so I'm not going to do the P 5 speed stuff I'm going to try to do some more object videos today eight to one Astros Wow okay where am i I'm a desktop CD desktop p5 generate chat bot oh no no clear make directory chat bot o CD chat bot p5 generate B how about a chat bot one okay so now Python I'm sorry Austin gives me tells me to learn to check out I I term is that what it's called a really really really should do that but I'm just still just using simple HTTP server and localhost 8001 minimize this open up atom and close this and go to I will get there eventually everybody chatbot I think this is lower than it usually is maybe it's not feel so much lower I mean that's too much table for you guys to see in the video okay chatbot one sketch a yes/no canvas and so one thing I want to do is that I'm going to just download the rive script JavaScript library in advance so that's not part of the actual video tutorial that I'll publish as part of this live stream so when I go to write script j/s and what I want is Oh No look I can just do it this way so I can always just link to it this way so I'm gonna do that so that will be there and there we go and okay alright how's the font size everybody font size okay I think feel like it needs to be a little bigger so the thing that I forgot to mention is sequencing oh you know it should be don't you think it should be that the bot has to guess the random number so we're thinking of the random number and the bot has to guess it hmm that's this is gonna be a hard one I should just do the knockknock joke thing I mean that's an example from rive script I actually have no idea how to do this with the guessing the random number thing because oh no it's easy I just check whether it's equal less than or greater than and I have some other stuff about picking the random number and your name and whatever let's do it so who should who should pick the random number I should pick the random number cuz I know I'm saying their number and I have to figure out whether it's bigger or the bots know the bots picking the number is gonna be oh I could have an automatic thing who's the user pick it okay the bots gonna pick the number okay bot thinks of a number okay thank you everybody that's gonna do that all right oh you know what I want to do packages so there's a rive script syntax highlighter I'm so I'm gonna go to packages oh I already have it installed okay so this is I already have this rive script syntax highlighter installed okay and here I'm sketch that yes all right everybody you ready here we go pick them from the book of course so how do I feed it how do I feed it the random number but I could do I have a clever idea I think I know I have I have a crazy idea I've got an idea oh this is gonna be good this is gonna be good this is gonna be good okay I'm excited welcome to a coding challenge where I will make a cheese bot that thinks that a random number and then the user has to guess that ringing them that random number will be thank you very much okay so I already forgot what I said three 7155 so I'm gonna do this in JavaScript I'm gonna say let let dot let dot no there's no that dot let number equal 37 Oh 555 okay I guess the bots gonna think of a number between 0 and 999 thousand and the chat bot framework that I'm gonna use to create this bot is something called rive script and I made a really terrible video about rive script that you could go and watch if you haven't but I would probably recommend just go and look at the right script tutorial which will be linked on the right script website which would be linked in this video's description and so what I need to I need to do two things I need to program in JavaScript I need to configure my chat bot the brain of the chat bot right this is a diagram technical fail this is a diagram from my previous video where I have something a JavaScript program is going to feed input into the brain and the brain is going to give me a reply so I'm gonna do all this input and output in JavaScript but the brain is actually gonna be controlled by rive scripts so in order for that to happen I need to create a rive script file so I'm gonna say a new file and I'm gonna call it a brain drive there's I don't have to call it that I'm actually I have an atom package the atom drive script package which is doing syntax highlighting so I can do things like and I said in my previous video that a pound was a comment it's not so this is the chatbots brain so the first thing I'm gonna do is I'm gonna give the chat bot a specific number I have an idea for the number to be picked randomly each time but let's just start with specific random number in the chat bot so this is rive script syntax it looks like JavaScript but it's write script syntax and I'm gonna do something that just says so I'm gonna do a catchall so I'm this is a trigger so this is so rife script if you didn't watch the previous video or don't know anything about it is a pattern matching system for chatbots so this is match any the user says that I don't match otherwise I'm gonna say the reply is going to be guess a number between zero and nine nine nine nine nine right so that's what the chat bot is going to say so actually let's leave this let's try to get the whole system working and then we'll come back and finish configuring the chat bot so how do I want to make this work well I want to have let's start putting some stuff in the HTML like chat bot and then I'm going to create a input user gonna call this user input and I'm gonna say say I'm gonna and then I'm going to create I'm going to create so this I'm just trying to put some stuff on the HTML page and I'm going to say reply I mean I'm not being thoughtful about the design here output and then I probably need like some sort of button that's like submit I mean like button ID equals submit button so again I'm being absolutely not very thoughtful about this interface but I'm just putting it let's see if what I wrote here in HTML will appear on the page there we go and the button should say submit great so this is the idea is that I'm gonna be able to say things like hello and hit submit and the chat BOTS gonna say something to me here in the reply obviously it's my hope that those of you watching this video will make something more creative and thoughtful about the design and eventually what I want to do is use a library called p5 speech to actually have all this happen with voice so but let's first make it work with text and I'll do another video to make it work with voice okay so how do I then so now I have my framework and well let's actually look we need to write some JavaScript I forgot about that part so let's go back to JavaScript and I don't need to draw a function and I'm gonna say let button equals select I called it some an idea submit I'm gonna say let user input equals select user input is the ID I gave it and what else do I need I need let output equals select output so now I have access to all of those Dom elements like I need the bunny to know when the user hits the button I need to know in the user what the user is said when they hit the button I need to build to put the reply somewhere so now I need a callback an event for whenever I click the button button Mouse pressed and I'm gonna call function called chat so I'm now going to write a function called chat and all I'm gonna do here I'm going to say input equals user input value so this is me getting the value what the user said and I'm gonna say output dot HTML input so I now have a parrot chat bot I have made a parrot chat bot all it ever will do is put back what the user says I haven't put the ride script brain into this program yet so now let's see if this is correct if I run this hello hello goodbye goodbye what's up question mark what's up so we can see here this is my very basic parrot chat bot I can read what the user says and I can give it a reply now what I want to do is have rive script act as the brain to tell me what the reply should actually be well time out I think somebody's at the door oh hello I'm yes I'm actually live right now you can't nobody can see you but they could hear you oh I got it for Jeff already I uploaded it oh I just haven't emailed it to you guys but I will okay perfect no problem that was a very famous guest star that just appeared on the coding train let's see if anybody could guess who that was if anybody heard that conversation okay so where was I in this video I oh this hasn't happened for you guys in real time yet now I'm seeing that okay I'll say who that was later another time let's see if anybody can guess okay uh was not Lady gaga that was a good lady we was Elijah the prophet no anyway as you open the door whatever okay so where was I okay now it's time for us to add that brain so I'm gonna go to the right script github page and this is actually in this particular repository called rive script J s so write scripts is a generic syntax for configuring a chat bot that you can then use in a variety of different programming languages environments I want to use it in JavaScript so all I need to do and one thing I've done already that I should have mentioned is I've imported the rive script library so here i've imported the rice script library just from a URL i could download it but i must have a reference to that rice script javascript library so i've done that is and it's covered in that github page and then I'm really just gonna say load file so no first I'm going to create a bot so I'm gonna go here and I'm gonna say let bot equal new rye script then I'm gonna say load file and my file is just called brain drive and I'm gonna I need to callbacks ready brain ready and brain error being very inconsistent of my naming of stuff so I'm now gonna write those callbacks brain ready console dot log chat bot ready and then I'm going to say brain error console dot log chat bot error and I'm sure I could there's probably an argument I could get some information about the error but let's just add this right now and let's just see if I now run this uncaught dollar sign is not defined so I have an error somehow let's take a look maybe I need to say at the top of version right I was doing this before let's say version 2 probably I might need this the top of the brain and let's go back no ok debugging time debugging debugging debugging time debugging time hmm what's wrong here dollar sign is not defined let me look at my actual example oh did I type the name wrong name of the file oh my god brain drive Oh brah look everybody in the chat sorry apparently I named my chat bot Brian without realizing it the name is brain not Brian the life of brain okay here we go let's try this now ah oh I know what the problem is I know what the problem is what could possibly dollar sign is not defined mean what javascript library uses dollar sign as a key term jQuery I think that rive script depent the rive script JavaScript library depends on jQuery and I have it imported jQuery that must be the problem right so it's not even loading the file it hasn't even gotten to the air and error in the file yet so if I want to load jQuery let's find a way to do that and I should be able to I don't know jQuery minified copy this copy I need to blow jQuery in my index.html file so and I can do that via URL so oops ah let's grab this come on people help me out here with some copy pasting this should copy it copy to clipboard copied it's not copying it to clipboard I hope this part gets edited out okay so okay so now I've imported jQuery as well here's the thing so JavaScript files that a web page uses can be loaded just like this is the code that I'm writing it's it's get Dutch yes these are some p5 libraries that I'm using but they're actually locally stored on the computer there are some other libraries but I'm getting them from a URL all these things are possible I don't know there's probably some nice good best practices here that somebody who knows something about programming will tell you but I'm just gonna make it work okay so now let's go back hit refresh chatbot ready okay so the chat bot is ready so now what do I do next what I want all I need to do is here in this chat and I probably should make you know if I were being really careful about this I would write some code to make sure the brain had been loaded before the bot tries to reply but I think it's very unlikely that a user is gonna be able to submit something before the bots actually loaded so but I'm gonna show you there's something I'm gonna have to add to this later that I think it's gonna be a little bit of an issue okay so what I'm going to do is I am going to I have code you alright so I need to ask the bot for a reply I'm pretty sure this is gonna this is gonna be here just in this page and oh interesting so I think that I might actually need this the replies have to be sorted to be honest I have no idea what that does but I imagine this is some sort of like processing element so let's add this in and so let's add this in under brain ready I'm gonna sort the replies and then what I want to do is I want to say let reply equal bot reply input now I think this actually isn't going to work I think I need to say I think if I look at the code example here local user I forget what this does but I need to give the first argument as local user so I want to say let input equals user input value and bot reply love it so let's see what happens now I think I did everything hello guess the number between so no matter what I do it's just gonna say guess the number between 0 and 99 99 so now aha so what do i what what else do I need in this chat bot so for example what if the user says any number great guess I like the number star1 so this isn't a star but this is a wild card just like this is a wild card but this is a wild card that only will match number so now if I reload this again if I say anything I'm gonna say guessing number but if I say 100 great guess I like the number 100 let me make this a little bit bigger so we can see I'm starting he could figure the bot to do certain things now what I really want to do is use a conditional so I want to say something like if star 1 is greater than is greater than bot num then I'm going to I need an equals here I don't even remember then I'm going to say pick a higher a lower number and if it's less than I don't know if I've got the syntax right here pick a higher number and again you can go and read the raj script tutorial heart watch my previous video that wasn't very good nothing this one's any good and then I could say oh I'm sorry what am I doing here I'm in the wrong I'm totally in the wrong place oh no no I'm in the right place I just don't know if I have the syntax right and then if it's equal you got it you got it so let's go to the Rice script tutorial which is here and let's look for conditional condition condition additional so this is a way I can have the bot set something and what I'm looking for is like this here we go ah what I get age is greater than 25 this is what you can do so this is what I want I have I want this conditional and I need the equals like almost like the arrow syntax the equals greater than so I want to say equals like this so I think this should work let's see if this is right and let's let's take a look here oh these are stars so I guess I need stars if I'm going to do a conditional and syntax highlighting is doing something weird which and the equal should be double equals I guess there we go so I think maybe this is right now okay let's see and I don't don't need to say star one cuz there's only star so let's see what's the chance I've gotten this right so things are still working is telling me to guess the number I'm gonna guess the number 10 pick a higher number I'm gonna guess the number 9 9 9 9 9 9 pick a lower number I'm gonna guess the number 37 5 5 5 you got it okay we should probably do more with this bot like it should have a name and it should be able to respond to other things but one thing I want to do is so why am I doing this I don't know I've really lost track of that but one reason why I'm doing this is if I combine rye Script and JavaScript I can make use of the powerful pieces of Drive script and JavaScript together so what I could do is I could actually have JavaScript I don't think there's a way for write script easily to pick a random number it probably is but just for the sake of argument what if I oh it's funny how I had this here so what if I actually say let num equal floor random nine nine nine nine nine so and then I'm going to and actually what I'm saying is 100,000 oh and I need to know the parentheses now I'm going to just console.log that number let's just what I want is for JavaScript to pick the random number there so it's picking a random number each time and maybe I need to make this a little bigger so you can see it right so how can I pass something that javascript picked to the bot well I'm asking I'm sending things to the bot from the user but I don't actually have to I could send stuff from the bot from my program as well so there's no reason why I couldn't actually just do this when the chat bot is ready and then what if what I send to the bot is let reply equal bot dot wouldn't it what is what is the function bot reply user lok local is it something like that i don't know i can't remember the local user set plus the number so what I'm doing is I'm sending to the bot I'm telling the bot like a secret message the code is sending a message to the bot not me the actual user typing saying set number so what I now want to do is if and of course this is very easily hackable don't get me wrong set number is a message where now I the bot will set and we don't need this a hardcoded variable anymore set num equal star so this will actually and I don't did I get this syntax right looks like something might be weird but I think I got it right so set Nam equals star and then now I can change this from bot num to get numb so let's see and I don't know let's make this pick a number between but between 1 and 10 just to like make things a little simpler here so this is gonna be a guess a number between 1 and 10 between one and ten and now the number will be here plus one because this is gonna give you a number between zero and nine and so and let's actually let's look at that number so we can cheat so to speak to make sure this is working and let's run this now okay so we'd pick the number four I can see that in the in the in the console so if I say one no reply found so what happened here brain so this is wrong this is clearly the wrong syntax let's go back to the rive script tutorial and we can see here a set name oh you know what it is you probably doesn't want any white space their set name equal formal formal by the way this is a way to keep that the case sensitivity of what the users typed there's all sorts of things and and so I can say set num let's see where was that set name equals formal let's just paste this in here to make sure I'm using the right syntax set num equal star so let's try this pick a higher number nine pick a lower number eight pick a lower number seven you got it too so you know I'm hacking it basically but pick a higher number pick a lower number so probably I don't know if this is the best solution there might be a different way to pass that value to the brain but certainly if I wanted to do it this way I could come up with like a really strange thing that the user would probably never type that's almost like a secret code to set a particular value that I'm getting from JavaScript so so anyway um there's more that could be done with this I've missed so many pieces thing that I actually missed that's important about chat bots are sequencing so one thing you can do is what if I have an example that's a knockknock joke bot and so and that's actually from rive script I encourage you to check that out on the tutorial let's actually look for it but you can see something that's important here is about is the previous command so in other words the wildcard you want to you basically the user in a knockknock joke the user can say anything I could just paste this in the user can say anything but there'd be the chat BOTS gonna say something different based on where you are in the sequence of the knockknock joke so this is saying this is what the user this is what the chat bot should reply with after who is there has already happened and this is what should the chatbox reply after who so that's important okay I went off track there so here is my number guessing chat bot with rice script and p5 I would love to see what kind of different chat BOTS you make with this same framework you know what happens if you like start querying api's and get there like the weather and have the bot talk about stuff and different topics or it's a programming questions or I don't know what you can make this bot do but I look forward to seeing what you guys create from this video to say that again I feel like I look forward to seeing what you create from this video losing my mind I look I look forward to seeing what you create from this video and in the next video I'm going to take exactly this I don't know if I'm gonna do this in the next video but in the next video or two I'm gonna do exactly this but with speech recognition so this conversation this guessing game could happen just purely in an auditory if that's the right word audio way okay things are clicking all over the place see you soon good bye okay oh there's some interesting thing happening in the chat alright so hopefully this was useful for people look at this you can make a chat bot so easy a game guessing thing look how easy that was and I didn't even use any neural network involved with any of this stuff I don't know what are you talking about rounded up to the nearest ten million me I am so me okay so what time is it 535 I how long have I been live streaming am i at two hours already I two hours is generally my limit let me see what I'm gonna do in terms of this object stuff that I want to keep going with because oh you okay topic discussion in the patron live channel I really like it's you totally can you don't listen to me that should be your channel to enjoy yourself to talk about anything you want but those I got confused okay I feel like there should be like a live channel that I should see in a live channel that I shouldn't see close the span what did I miss whoops open recent chat BOTS oh sorry thank you there we go alright 305 a.m. in India and by the way the audio has the audio the audio is good alright let's see here so now you've made a chat but let's I'm right I'm going back to object stuff please hold you know when your hands are covered in flour or ooh chicken gizzard this is these are the new video I'm going through and slowly replacing and leaving online my older videos objectoriented program in es6 so this definitely needs to be redone arrays of objects but before I get to that I also was gonna do this like more on objects video which is remember I had this list let's see if I have it it's whoops go back let me come over here oh sorry this camera went off very hard to erase to use pressure on the board this eraser is also terrible but not so bad grey wizard and the chat will be reminding me to get a better eraser right about now so the things that I wanted to I mean the things that I want to eventually get to are so in this is a video that I imagine that's more on objects what are the things that I want to include let me go to once again here and looking for learning processing and I'm looking for objectoriented programming okay okay and more on objects particle class objects as data for other objects overloading and objects communicating with other objects make a robot already overloading hmm actually what I want to do is clickable so I think the objects communicating with other objects is almost more interesting once I have an array because if I go I'm trying to figure out what videos I'm gonna make here and that's I know I have clicking on objects adding and removing objects deleting objects checking I have all about here so actually maybe I should do all those that's what I did with you could do all those things once I already have an array so maybe that makes sense so is there actually doesn't make sense for anything else to come after these three because the next thing I want to do is a raise of objects okay I think it's still off topic and the chat is about Internet Explorer okay all right so I think what I'm gonna do who who wants to humor me and this is the video I'm replacing so I need to watch this for a sec okay so now I've made two videos one just about what is an array in the syntax of an array and the other video looking at how to use a loop to iterate over every element in that array and in this video I want to unlock this great power to you which is how to take an object and duplicate that object many times into an array so first this is viscera again that's all I need to know okay so that's what I do oh geez that I'm kind of redoing old content but I got to get to this sometime because look at this look at this horrible thing that I've done can you believe this nonsense that I'm making this like literal object and I'm like copy oh nobody should ever watch this video and try to learn programming from it Oh horrible okay so but I did get it just to revisit this is what I'm talking about how would you make so what I need to do now is close this close this close this and I need to please hold okay I am now ready oh is the music very loud sorry sorry sorry sorry I can't like get it right cuz all right sorry about that I just Boston saying advice as well take 10 minutes to install I term actor there's I term I'm gonna do I turn right before I do Chrome extensions no I'm gonna do it it's just it's so hard to like oh no bad me okay um ready here we go hello it's me again your friendly neighborhood coding person who made some bubbles so if you were watching some previous videos a while back I made these bubble objects and there they are they're moving around the street and then there were some videos where I look kind of different which were about arrays just like a raise of numbers and raise of strings and like it's a list of things and things have indices so why am I here now I'm here in this video because I have this goal I have this goal in life which is to say I have defined what it means to be a bubble I made a bubble class I made a bubble object and I made two bubble objects bubble one and bubble two and I would like to be able to make five bubble objects and I would like to not have to do this because I would also like to make five hundred or a thousand or ten thousand I want to be able to make as many duplicate as many objects as I want create as many objects as I want from that template from that class without having to have all these separate variables and wouldn't you just isn't it just so convenient that I'm right here having just talked about objects and arrays if I just put those two things together we'll be in good shape so let's do that I don't think I need to yeah okay so let's just do that oh no don't go over there okay so so I'm gonna change this from one variable to Beryl's to a single variable called bubbles now remember when I want a variable to hold an array a list of information instead of making it equal to something like an object or a number I set it equal to open closed brackets there's other ways you can create an array also but this is a pretty conventional way now what I might do is I might say okay I have this array in theory I have this array that I could fill why don't I put a bubble in index zero and a bubble in index one so I'm going to put my bubble here and put my bubble here make two bubble objects instead of having separate variables bubble one bubble I am going to have a variable bubbles index 0 because remember the first spot in the array is 0 not 1 so it was kind of bad that when I was doing this idea in the bubble 1 and bubble I should really name the double 0 and bubble 1 so the first thing I could do is just change this program to say like hey bubbles zero bubbles 1 bubbles 0 this is bubbles 0 you get the idea right one oh this is all why am I even bothering with this bubbles one oh no look at this this is bubbles zero and one and this is bubbles zero in one ah oh my goodness oh my gosh no wait a second stop the presses I'm so confused I think what I would prefer to do is move 0 and 1 and then chosen one so of course I could do this in any order but I want to move the first one and and by the way this is not going to be the solution because even though this now works and I have the same exact result the only thing that I've done differently is that instead of having two separate variables I have one array but I'm still referencing the two separate bubble objects individually so if I want to have ten of them I still have to keep adding more and more lines of code so what I want to do is I want to use that for loop if I say for let I equals zero I is less than some number I plus plus then inside here I can refer to that array called bubbles instead of saying hardcoding in zero hardcoding in one if I just say bubbles index I this is going to repeat many times with a different value for I I is zero then it's 1 then it's two then it's three so this is a way of me iterating accessing every single element of that array so I can use that too and by the way I know I know there's like a for each sort of thing and maybe I'll make a video about that but I'm gonna just use a nice for loop with a counter variable so I'm gonna today for let I equals 0 eyes less than 2 I plus plus and now instead of referencing the bubbles individually I'm going to just say bubbles index high which means I can now do this bubbles index I that same loop later and draw this is to use a loop to create the bubble objects and set up I can say bubbles index I'd move bubbles index I dot I don't even remember anymore a show is that what it was show we can look in the bubble class if I forgotten where's the bubbles class oh here it is move and show oh boy what happened here wait hold on hold on that shouldn't be there that was like me too guessing something sold on move and show what was that we would show what was what this show is the show mightier please edit this somehow move show was it show we could scroll down and look at the bubble claw MC move and show okay so those were the names of the functions that I used in that bubble class so now let's run this again oops and here we go so look at that ah now I still have two bubbles but one was big one was small before and then one was they were both there were different spots I lost that so one of the things that I had in my previous example if I just go back to here is I had specified exact locations for each bubble object and exact sizes and now that I have a loop I'm in a much happier place in that I can easily make 20 of these but it's what do I do about initializing all that stuff so this thing is here hello welcome to programming the reason why I'm coding here is not because I want to specifically set some exact locations for bubbles more likely I want to come up with some kind of algorithm like I want all the bubbles to appear in a perfect grid or I want them all to appear randomly or I want them to be in a grid that's slightly offset randomly or I want them to appear in a spiral pattern I want them all to start in the same place so what is that algorithm so let me just say so one thing I could do is I could use the fact that I have this counter I and I could say let X equal like well what if I start the bubbles starting on at like pixel ten and then add space them out by like 30 pixels you know so this kind of came to me and immediately because I've done this so many times but this is now a formula that when I is 0 X will equal 10 when I is 1 X will equal 10 plus 30 times 140 and if I ever got to to which one in this case it would be 10 plus 1670 right so this idea of spacing the bubbles out so I could made 3 of them and by the way and then of course instead of hardcoding this value here I could say X I could use this variable to pass in which is calculated everything and then by the way this is really so one thing that's bad about this is now if I if I'm creating three bubbles all of a sudden right then I left this number two here so what I want to do is say bubbles dot length so this way however now I can't use bubbles dot length here because the array when I first started was empty so I'm adding things to the array a certain number of them then I can retrieve that length later and again there are different ways you can approach how many spots there are and how you store the length but this is just a way that i'ma do it for this example so now let's look at this you can see look at them they started now let's not move them just so we can see you can see there they are spaced out and I could easily just say well actually I want to space them out by a hundred pixels and I want them just to be 20 pixels in and you can see there we go and I want them to actually start at least 20 pixels in and you can see there they are and then I want to have ten of them there we go but I can't really have ten of them you get the idea and now I could put back in move and there they go so this is a way and I but what hello do you do something kind of exciting about this video which is that I haven't once changed any of the code down here this idea of a single bubble has remained exactly the same the thing that's different now is that I can create them and put them in an array and however many there are I could just move it show over so I'm gonna show you a few more things here now here's another thing I could do let's actually just make them let's let's just sort of prove this point let's give them all random spots and again I could set them randomly in the constructor but I'm just going to do it here so I'm gonna give them all a random I'm going to just create a whole bunch of bubbles with random locations and we can see in random sizes and you can see there they are but this is what I'm talking about now I have this one program here it makes ten bubbles I want this program to now make 100 how how many keys on the keyboard do I need to hit in order to make this change one if I programmed everything correctly all I need to do is at a zero here and suddenly I have a hundred of them and if I add another zero suddenly I have a thousand of them now my program is slowing down because it has to render and draw a lot of stuff hold on did I mess something up oh no people you guys are just distract me in the chat like I have a mistake in my code but it's just the autofill that Adam is doing that for you're talking about yeah why is it doing that okay sorry now my program might be slowing down because it's drawing a lot of bubbles and it's a lot to draw and you know I could sort of start thinking about what I really want to do here maybe actually what I want is for these bubbles not to have a stroke but I want them to have a fill with quite a bit of alpha and I could take this out of here and now I've got this sort of like cloudy thing going on so again I can use this idea what I'm really doing here is I'm kind of on the way to building something called a particle system I'm building a system of many individual elements that together make some sort of effect like a smoky cloudy thing but I could just with a with one variable now with one value change how many things are in there now here's the thing what if I'm gonna do one more thing in this video and I'm gonna I'm gonna actually put the bubble back to have that so let's just go back to where I was with just start with ten bubbles ten bubbles now what if what if I take this out of setup entirely it's gone what's gonna happen what's my program going to do nothing emptiest no but no emptiness no bubbles what if what I want to do is add bubbles when I click the mouse okay let's think about this the first thing that I might want to do is figure out where I can wear code executes when I click the mouse so that is that I want to add function mousepressed now whoops sorry now what do I want to do I want to make a bubble let be equal new bubble and I want that bubble to be where the mouse is and maybe it has a random size between 10 and 50 pixels so I've Nate I've and I don't love these 1 character variables I should do better than that but I've picked a random number and I've made a new bubble what if I want to put that bubble in the array well I could say something like bubbles index 0 equals B right I could say I the first spot in the array put that bubble when I click the mouse look I only have one though because what I'm doing here is every single time I'm making a new bubble and putting it in the first spot but if this were a counter and it went up every single time I could put the first bubble in the first spot the next bubble in the second spot the next bubble in the third spot but I could do even better than that there's actually a function there's a lot of functions associated with arrays arrays are actually objects too that allow you to do certain things I'm gonna get to them I can delete stuff I can move stuff around I can shuffle I can sort but what I'm going to do is I'm gonna use this function called push push is a function that means add something to the array push it to the array and actually by default it's going to push it to the end of the array so now that I have that every time I click I add a new bubble and what's interesting about this is there's no there's a there's no limit to the number of bubbles I can have other than the computer speed and memory and interestingly enough I might just as a little effect change this to Mouse dragged and you can see now and I drag the mouse I'm kind of drawing this this kind of array of bubble objects okay so this is all about making an array of objects so if you're following along maybe you had an object you made some variation of the bubble you made a bouncing ball you made some kind of flying pig I don't know what it is you made a rainbow heart take that don't don't make any changes in your class at all try to write a program where you duplicate it in an array and you can just change one number and you can have 500 versus a thousand versus 10 see if you can add them with clicking the mouse or hitting the keyboard or some type of maybe what happened what if you try to like add every 10 seconds how would you do that what kind of event can trigger the adding of an object and then what I want to do in a future video which maybe will be the next one is how could I delete these when I click on them or how do I even know how do I communicate for all just a couple things how do I know if these bubbles are intersecting with each other so I want objects to talk to other objects and I also want to be able to talk to the objects bubbles you bubble hello bubble that's me talking to the objects I guess but I don't miss a alexa that's not a bubbles name's not alexa anyway what was I talking about oh so I want to be able to figure out how do I interact with the bubbles 10 each bubble have its own mouth pressed kind of like event how does that work so I got to get to that sort of stuff and that'll come in a future video thanks for watching ok so here's the reason why I don't like using for each it's confusing it's confusing to beginners it's it uses a callback which is not even a concept in these videos that I've covered yet so if you're in this sequence oh I should do a video about for each and when you learn to use it but also the asynchronous aspect of the callback I think can be problematic and there's so many times we're having the counter is also just the index is incredibly useful so that's one of my reasons why I don't like using a for each alright so that was pretty good where was it 6 o'clock I think I'm gonna have to go this like desire to like but I'm not gonna say it I'll be it'll be if alright so we're so how did I how did I do there what did I get done I lost my playlist and if I go to my playlist here I told my dad yeah so weird whatever am I so I basically did this 7.3 this goes away so this year did gone there's no reason for this video to exist anymore in this playlist and then these can stay adding and removing objects and clicking on objects deleting objects using splice what's the difference between oh I made those two separate videos I think I've done this one oh I haven't done the I don't think do I do i I have to investigate this whether this actually I remove objects in this one but whatever's I'm in a slightly different sequence now because I did both push in this so what I need these can stay right now this should go away these can stay and the next things I need to do are clicking on an object and there's all of these deleting objects that sort of thing all right oh hi Sean Vann every Oh Sean man every so I forgot I opened I opened this live coding train episode with a sketch that Sean ban ever he made and this had crashed so let's try that again history oh how come it's not in this history show full history because it's I restarted the computer where wherever here we go here we go there we go all right Sean this is for you okay this is what the sponsored for not actually any money but this is this sponsored portion of my live video yes I that here's the thing I have no fear about showing my browser history because I'm logged in to a separate account that I only use for live streaming although I don't know who knows what I was doing earlier today in that account while I was setting up no that was not Sean Vann every at the door somebody else was at the door and I don't think anyone's guessed it yet okay so hello I'm here to tell you about something called interactive media arts which is a new BFA program at Tisch School of the Arts New York University right here in New York my name is Dan Shipman I am from the coding terrain YouTube channel but I also teach at a program called ITP which is a twoyear graduate twoyear graduate program master's program which still is here and it's still deep there and it's been around since 1979 so ver do the math I can't do that math but you can do it a long time and so next year we are starting a new undergraduate program and we're looking for students to apply if you are a high school senior junior I guess we can apply it whatever whatever you if you are the appropriate age to apply to college and are interested come and study here with us you can learn more at ITP NYU edu slash ima and you can there's all sorts of more information there and get your app there's stuff about how to apply and you can watch them Cody train videos to get a sense of what happens at ITP at ima and what will happen in ima it's gonna be great so please join us and tweet me at Schiffman if you if you need any if you have questions about or you're thinking about applying and we're seeing who will come here and and make the world a better place with code and other stuff to thank you how'd I do Sean Sean in the chat by the way is the director of undergraduate studies for the new I am a that's starting next year we have no idea if anyone will apply so I'm trying to do a little outreach we'd love for anybody from anywhere with any background who's interested in being creative maybe you are a maker or artist or you're a thinker engineer but this is really this is the button you should be because you should be defining yourself that sort of thing Gerald hunt says no one will acknowledge this comment but is there an upper age limit well I don't know that's a good question maybe Shawn in that chat can answer that question okay yeah me too Joseph okay you know by the way it's very bad practice when you're doing like a live stream to answer quote things that are in the chat without actually saying out repeating what they are but I just did it anyway and yeah you know so Austin writes and other people have writing the same things oh I wish I could go you know I can't afford it and this is a that is a really important and valid response and I hope that stuff that I'm doing here in this YouTube channel and other another innovative ways that people are thinking about to reduce the cost of Education I would love to be a part of that discussion and you know it is true that New York University being here this is a very expensive place and anything I could do to help make education accessible and more affordable for people I would love to do alright so I can't talk about the thing that I can't talk about because I was talking about it and then the whole thing crashed so right if you have a bachelor's degree already you should apply to ITP by the way if you're interested in hold on I did make some some videos that you might like if spring show ITP Schiffman coding train let's try this so that's the archive so this is a video that I made oh my god that's that music in it like I'm Dan this is a special coding training episode this what playing behind me spring show that's weird that's really weird so I won't play all this but you this is a video compilation that I made I don't know if you can hear me over this video show about a hundred I should do those like commentary like things where I like watch somebody else's video and I just like comment on it this video is terrible who's this idiot so this here like there's a bunch of projects that I show on different students and this is a graduate program and so and this is Michelle is amazing and so oh so you get you guys can you guys can watch this video it's online separate I'll link to it that you can learn a bit more about the kind of projects that people make it ITP by watching that video look there's also look at all these videos you could watch that are being recommended oh look at this what is ITP all right here we go dude I don't know this is so fancy what's he gonna stand for Oh program program program the video is too quiet still have no idea what they did here it's like humans plus technology or plus humans plus technology plus humans plus technology probably a lot of people still have that notion I have no idea what they do in there but it's something very quite a while ago I have a figure it's a problem it was a problem in that was a know something you know what he does oh so would you believe like things around the floor that I triple repeat oh it's that potage beans well I'm going to med school you know it's just it's hard to describe rob has 2006 gainfully tried to turn condensed to give us a I guess a mission statement all right at least a working description of the place which he thought I'm really enjoying them this has got to be at least ten years old we should insert that now we're trying to teach students that how to describe the program when they can describe the program to their parents they graduate ITP has definitely changed his personality over the years you guys recognize that voice dude Redbirds who I've talked about and I have Reds developing no this is a great video actually this is the origin actually I was fortunate with a colleague to get some money from the market foundation to start said about the college and the media center in 1971 and so when I was doing that that I realized there was no graduate department anywhere that provided this kind of opportunity for people to play with its tools and so in 1979 IP was started with 20 students it became apparent that the whole structure of communicating was radical there was again the spirit of pioneering and trying and you know they ran with it when I to be started in the nineteen the late 70s there were no computers and they were using closed caption video to do a lot of conferencing and stuff like that Twitty interesting stuff right video okay watching this I can watch this on my own time yeah okay and it became alright that's pretty interesting okay now where was I so I think I'm kind of wrapping up here I don't know if anybody has any I think I'm kind of done for today it is 610 to the Yankees game start what's the score the Yankees game and but but maybe I can answer a few questions or I don't think that I think I guess I could do one more of these they're short and I could get another one out of the way I could do the clicking maybe I should do the clicking so so Lubin's asked it so everyone's asking about the machine learning stuff again how to solve this problem but I'm gonna get to it I'm just I'm trying to doing some other stuff now I mean III talked about this earlier in the livestream so I'll come back to that yes sorry I'm not questions Annie's entertainment says where do I send you money send all of your checks to actually you should really donate to maybe a good cause like I saw that linmanuel Miranda did is doing a fundraiser for Puerto Rico hurricane relief so that's where I would put my words right now today if I were you okay all right let me do one more because let's see what if I what have I actually gotten that will get published in the next week out today I did this tear I did this video where I tried to make a presentation about chatbots that I think maybe isn't any good I kind of did an introduction to rise script it was okay but not so great then I did a chatbot coding challenge which I thought turned out pretty well and then I I did this one so I've done four four things that it can get edited out of this and possibly a three or four depending on how many I choose to publish separately so so oh and I should really stop so Simon and I would like to do some kind of like marathon livestream at some point you know health was a concern of course I don't know that I could do something for 24 hours which Austin suggests plus the ima promo yeah yeah that's very sharp I just did it during the livestream I hope that was okay but and yes I do have a patreon that is correct so let's see let's no no clicking I should just go maybe I'll just go I'm gonna do the clicking I wish I had an idea for like you know how did the room well let's stop timeout I'm taking suggestions right now for anything similar to hi so I'm a harmonic motion again and I could really really make it super simple and just have something oscillating and I could make it color or size so what I'm looking for I'll take other suggestions but what I'm looking for I've been enjoying doing these so far these the 10 print and recursion this is nine minutes and this was twelve minutes they barely anything in the content of the video but the amount of creative things that people have created out of it has been really exciting to see so what's clicking the clicking the clicking was yeah so physics engine is no good that's too complicated Austin's telling me to set up I term make the ITP scrolling effect from the last video I don't know what that is harmonic motion is one recursion I already did game engine to complicated Hanoi towers to complicated anything the matter that's too complicated so so far I've got simple harmonic motion that's the only one that I've did I think and I term but point point box baking a pizza WebSockets to complicated if you click on the p5 homepage it makes a purple dot similar to the circle recursion do recursion and body simulation to calm the pacman to complicated sine wave that I could do it could be a sine wave yeah let's do the sine wave Armand let's do the full I sis now that I have these array two toriel's kind of done let's do that okay here we go everybody Chrome extensions good one okay we're gonna do one more coding challenge then I'm gonna go home for the weekend cuz I can't bear to do another objectoriented programming video particle system I could do aa simple particle system look at that alright everybody last coding challenge we're gonna do a nice little poll simple particle system and when I say simple particle system I really mean Oh smoke like smoke effect okay and or us sine wave / simple harmonic motion and I should really just do both of these I'm just gonna do one okay here we go rb8 1d kak and now while I'm waiting for you to enter the straw poll 6240 to 3244 16,700 oh that sound is so loud see this is the problem I don't have the laptop sorry everybody sorry 25 ok I've lost my energy okay that was your one minute to vote so I should really give you a little more time though because you guys are a little bit behind me so if I had three of these I could juggle them I bet nevermind ok poll is dead let's see here we go okay this is pretty clear oh I'm surprised nobody's watching is anybody watching these two loud again that's too loud I don't hold on I don't know what's going I should love to listen to I don't know I'm sorry the sound is all out of whack alright this even though only three my popularity is waning but it's pretty clear it's not too hot okay they're messing with you oh thank you it's fine I control you all so I could just do this for the next hour and never do the Cody challenge alright this is the last thing I'm going to do and okay so let's do this okay okay all right let's see here now and I'll get rid of this okay we're ready everybody I don't know how long I've been streaming for it's got to be like two and a half hours now I would guess so this is gonna be it for today I'm just gonna do I don't know why I'm doing one more thing it's really no reason for me to but I am I feel like guilty like I don't I'm not doing enough okay here we go oh wait this views hello welcome to another coding challenge in this coding challenge I'm gonna try to vary in a very simple way in a quick way program a simple particle system that resembles something like smoke so I'm gonna do this probably in a way that has very little visual interesting quality to it whatsoever it's my hope much like with my recent temperent and recursion coding challenges that I see a wide variety of clever beautiful remixes of this simple idea and what kind of beautiful particle system ideas can you make out of what I make so let me just start by making it so what I'm going to do the idea of the particle system by the way is creating something out of many particle things that's like the worst ever definition of a particle system but incidentally the term particle system was coined for originally for the movie the Wrath of Khan the effect the Genesis effect there's a effect where like this thing gets shot at a planet that doesn't have anything on it and kind of planet kind of catches fire and then all of a sudden it's all green and life is there and so anyway I think it's William T Reeves there's a paper I'll link to all that the history of particle systems in this video's description but but the idea is I want to make and I'm gonna do this as a class so I just recently started using es6 and I made a bunch of tutorials about classes and objects and I'm going to use that technique in this video so I'm gonna make a class anytime I make a class I need to make a constructor and this particle now I could use if you look at my nature of code videos I use this thing called a P vector that's in processing in p5 there's something called a p5 fector but stay simple here and I'm just going to make this X just an X a separate X which will be 300 and this dot Y which will be 3 380 so the reason why I'm doing this is I want my particles to in this idea you know I could do anything but I want them all to start at the bottom and kind of come up word and fade out which will hopefully give me a somewhat smoke or fire like effect it probably will not look like that at all but that you're gonna then you're gonna modify it make something much better okay so I want a function called show for each object and in it show I'm just gonna you know like loading images and using textures to draw the particles would be a nice technique to create more interesting visual effects but I'm just gonna draw them as circles this dot X this dot Y and I'm gonna give this I'm gonna have it be a diameter of 16 and I don't if the width and height are equal I can just use one I'm gonna say fill and I'm gonna give it some alpha and I'm gonna I'm gonna say stroke 255 just so I can see it really well now and so the Alpha will be like 10 so now let's just try making a single particle I'll just call it P P equals new particle and P dot show so let's run this there we go there's that particle now I does it a little bit so there's this is it I have one particle there it is at the bottom good so now what I want to do it's obvious I'm going to need many of them so I'm going to change this to be an array and what I'm actually going to do is I'm going to say in draw let P is equal a new particle and then I'm gonna say particles dot push P so what I'm going to do is I'm gonna use the push function which adds an object to the array and let me put this in setup now just for the sake of argument so I'm going to put one particle in the array so that now if I write a for loop that's in you know q2 complaining about not a for each loop where I iterate over the array using a counter variable like eye and say particles index where how do I get up there particles index I now I kind of have the same program this should be the same I should see just that one particle I created it and setup I added to the array and I'm showing it same exact program but now let's make that particle move so let's write a function called update let's give this particle variables like VX and V Y and I'm gonna give it an initial random like I'm gonna give it's random VX for velocity so I need a speed or way that it changes along the xaxis and a yaxis so using p5 vector could be helpful here and if anyone wants to do a port of this with p5 vector you're welcome to and then I'm gonna give it a random velocity going upward so what would that be upward is negative so something like between like negative 5 and negative 1 so an update I'm now going to say this dot X plus equals this dot V X this dot y plus equals this dot dy so the idea here is that I'm going to change the location by some random amount and so I can now for all those particles I can say update you can think there it goes it goes up so I actually now I'm realizing a couple things here but what I want to do right is instead of just having one particle I mean when do I want to add particles do I want to start with a burst of them so I add 100 and set up so I want to have them once every 5 seconds so I add some sort of timer there's so many different ways but let's try for the sake of argument just adding one new particle every time through draw so I'm getting somewhere this is kind of you know perhaps somewhat like the idea smoke doesn't really look like smoke but I've got a particle system here so things that I would want to do yeah and then way I could stop here and I could say hey you make this more creative and interesting but I'm missing some key features that I really need to have here so first of all one thing that I want to try doing is I want to give these particles a transparency so let's actually give them a variable called alpha and we'll start it at 255 and I'm going to use this variable here in its fill this alpha and an update I'm gonna say this dot alpha equal one or or something so each one will fade out I don't know equal five let's have them fade out pretty fast so it's gonna lose some alpha with each frame so you can see there this is gonna hopefully help me have something a bit more like smoke and the stroke is is there so I'm still seeing them all so what I want to do is let's actually take out the outline color we can see okay how did I do oh let's roast a marshmallow by the white circular fire delicious okay so actually in a way I'm kind of done but there's there's some more things I should really think about here number one is hmm after I run this for a while it's gonna start really being really really slow for example particles I could look in the console here particles dot length there's eight hundred thirty particles right now but I don't need eight hundred thirty particles right and if I look at it now there's a thousand fifty particles I'm adding new particles every frame but I'm never getting rid of them so I want to make sure that I remove particles so there's a different ways I could do this I think one way that I'm going to try to do this is I'm going to remove the particles when their alpha becomes less than zero so one way to do that is with the splice function and so if I come back to this main loop I could say if so one thing I might add I'm gonna say if particles index I is to delete iterative function that's kind of a weird name I want this function to delete tell me true or false whether I should delete it it's like a question delete delete finish maybe I'll just call it like finished then I want to remove this particle so let's write that function first so I'm gonna call this function finished and basically I'm just gonna return this dot alpha less than zero so it's a little bit weird I'm just writing return the results of this alpha less than zero so this not alpha is less than when it's less than zero this will evaluate to true or it will evaluate to false so this function is either going to return true or false and it's true when alpha when it's faded out I don't want to display it anymore so let's actually put that stroke back just so we can see it and then let me how do I remove a particle why could actually say particles dot splice I comma one so I happen to know this already but the splice function is a function that removes an element from the array at position I and just that one element so I could put it two there and remove that one and the one after it that's not what I want to do so now look at this you can see them getting removed now something weird is happening you see this like weird like flickery like thing so there's a little bit of an issue I've I've covered this in so many different videos I'm not sure if I should cover it here and just point to it but I'm gonna I think I will cover it here really briefly so I just realized you need to erase this so there's other ways around this and in many ways if I took out the stroke I wouldn't have this problem visually but what's happening here is if I have an array that has a bunch of spots in it and I call these like people a particle a particle B particle C particle D particle E and these are in spots 0 1 2 3 4 well what happens is if I'm iterating over this if I'm saying check spot zero should I delete it nope check spot 1 should I delete it nope check spot two should I delete it let's say yes I should delete it so I delete this one and now I have the array looks like this it has instead of having 1 2 3 4 5 it has 1 2 3 4 things in it PA PB P D and PE 0 1 2 3 so the next one I should check is number 3 right which is the last one notice what happened I was here so these shifted over and then I went to the next one which actually I ended up skipping PD so so this could be a problem and a way that I could deal this is just go backwards because I'm going backwards I check this when I check this one then I check this one if I remove it these shift over it doesn't matter I'm not affecting the beginning of the array and in some ways this is less of an of an important issue right here but it is this is the thing you need to be thinking about if you're using a counter and iterating over the right like if ideally we're on adding stuff to the array that's also really good be a problem never get to the end and I'll be stuck in an infinite loop so here's a way around that I'm gonna start at the end of the array particles length minus 1 then I'm going to say greater than I'm gonna go down to 0 and say I minus minus just gonna go in the array backwards and now you can see was the stuff fades out it disappears there's no more weird flickering there's a little weird that they just disappear suddenly but this is mostly just because of the fact that they have this stroke on them now I'm only removing them when I can't see them so now if I look at particles dot length is only 51 particles and I run this for another a few seconds while I'm talking and there's still only 51 and there's still only 51 so the timing is working out such that there's only ever going to be 51 so how could I make this look more like smoke well one thing that might be important to play with is how many particles do I want to add each frame so this is now five particles per frame whoops and oh sorry this needs to be inside the loop so you can see here you know does this look more like smoke left like smoke but so that's one parameter here that's important to work on but here is really what I think is important number one is oh I didn't even add any acceleration so like adding some type of acceleration so I'm not going to do this in this video but this is what you want to think about what's a different way that you could pick initial velocities should those velocities change over time what are you actually are using color what shape are you drawing do the size of those circles vary are you can you make it feel like something that's not smoke or fire but more like a confetti bursts or something fireworks I have another coding challenge where I do fireworks which is pretty similar to so there's a lot of possible things you could do and so I'm gonna end this here with this code and I look forward to a thousand particle flower systems blooming please share them with me hashtag on Twitter particle train particle trade particle train particle train no what's that song particle it's particle man's that they might be done the particle train is good so hashtag particle train on Twitter I would love to see love gifts and animations of all your particle systems that you make share your code and I look forward to seeing you in my next coding challenge alright everybody I think this is the end so I don't know how did I do I did an extra thing it is now 635 and it's time for me to go I will happily answer a few last questions I'm looking at my phone I'm getting updates about the Yankees game I need to show the eye what equals one in the forloop oh oh yeah I could also so this is a good point another strategy thank you for this another strategy I could do is just like as I'm going through the loop and things shift over I could just set I back and like no and say I minus one so I could have done that that's a very good thing did the sound oh you guys are okay alright everybody thank you to everyone I appreciate all of your comments even when you're asking when I'm gonna do the Agha Rio part 3 or a machinelearning school the Chrome extensions is the one I really could get to and I term those are all those things I'm coming they're coming there's only I if I could do this every day think about how many things they could get through except I have to there are certain things as you know as with the chat BOTS that I have to kind of research and practice a little bit I think it makes the tutorials a little bit better to be honest and certain things I could kind of do offthecuff like like this particular one so goodbye song people like this alright alright so this is going to go for two and a half minutes and I'm gonna just sort of read the chat and see if I can answer any questions plans for the next livestream so next Friday I'm hoping to continue the chat bots stuff to do the p5 speech thing and maybe an Alexa skill as well as more object and Ray videos get those done Yeah right it could pop removes the object from the array but can we push at the end yes Lorenz and is asking which is the firework one if somebody could help out and post a link to the fireworks coding challenge in the chat that would be great it's the couldn't challenge number something to just go to the coding challenge playlist there's 70 some of them now you'll find it yeah before I do the Alexis skill I want to have the Alexa in here working and it doesn't work on the NYU wireless unless I authenticate it in some way so when are these videos going to be released so what happens is you have more gaming challenges I know people are interested in that working on these videos so what happens is after today Matt at math blank on Twitter helps edit them and release them as separate videos this live stream will stay archived forever you know it's available immediately after this end it goes to unlisted so you might have to be clever to find the link or ask me for it but it'll be probably made public tomorrow or the next day and the videos will come out I can't try to release one new video per day I don't know in theory like spreading them out is better than replacing them all at once API is definitely something I would love to look at papa bane I would love to keep track look at your particle system yes can you allow links to your own videos I have to add dot because of the spam filter oh yeah I don't know if someone tells me how to do that I'm happy to do that right now it has to be someone who has moderator privileges great so Topher I mean I cover it not you know there's a lot to making Alexis kill button if we need to go over the basics is p5 shader support on the way there was a lot of work I really need to do a video exploring WebGL again somebody helped me remember that but there's been a lot of work over the summer that I mentioned by Stahl Jia and Kate and apologize for missing their full names or the Twitter handles but did google Summer of Code about WebGL mp5 and I think probably someone needs to volunteer to really help work on that shader support there is some of the progress worked I don't know where this Alexa skill Alexa is the Amazon echo product where you can create a your own chat bot you can release on Alexa for people to interact with okay thank you anybody uh one last question I wonder if your pupil students watch your streams I really hope not I mean I have fun doing this and I'm glad that people appreciate it but sometimes I worry about it okay anyway so thank you everybody I will see you next Friday for another coding train episode and enjoy your weekend and your week and take some time away from your code do something nice for somebody and all that stuff okay thank you dolly for posting Kate Holland back as her last name installed gia also has a last name two students who did google Summer of Code you can check out in processing org medium ok pacman pacman probably needs multiple parts it's a longer project I'm gonna have to dedicate a whole session for that probably alright goodbye everybody it's a different time rembu sighs it's a different time every week you check Friday morning Easter time I usually set the time it's usually midafternoon but I like doing in the morning if I can alright good bye everybody have a good rest of your time okay stop straight
