03:45 - all right doing a little sound check
03:47 - here how's my audio
03:48 - uh had some technical difficulties where
03:50 - i popped up on the screen for a moment
03:53 - uh let me know how the sound is going
03:55 - [Music]
04:03 - i'll be getting started in just about
04:07 - two minutes
04:18 - [Music]
04:48 - people are pointing out that the
04:49 - description has time stamps
04:52 - that's just that's an error that's just
04:55 - because
04:56 - i uh cloned last live stream
04:59 - for today and forgot to remove the time
05:01 - stamp so
05:02 - uh i will try to fix that shortly
05:11 - [Music]
05:36 - baby
05:39 - [Music]
06:08 - [Music]
06:28 - good morning everybody welcome to the
06:30 - coding train which
06:32 - has amazingly pulled into the station
06:34 - quite on time which is
06:35 - a thing that almost i don't know this
06:37 - might be the first time in coding train
06:39 - history although technically
06:40 - my clock here says 1002 so i suppose
06:44 - a couple minutes late usually i start
06:46 - the sort of well usually i start things
06:48 - late but then there's the animation and
06:50 - the music
06:51 - and me trying to like fix some wire that
06:53 - became unplugged
06:55 - and things don't get going till quite
06:57 - late but here we are i don't know
06:58 - this must mean it probably means that
07:01 - this is going to be a total disaster
07:02 - of a live stream which of course if i'm
07:04 - being honest is pretty much every coding
07:06 - train live stream
07:07 - but um i don't know maybe today will be
07:10 - the perfect day
07:11 - i don't have a plan oh it's been a month
07:15 - um how's everybody doing um i do
07:18 - have um some thing and while i don't
07:21 - have a plan i do have some things that i
07:23 - want to
07:23 - look at and talk about oh i do have a
07:25 - plan i forgot about my plan
07:29 - all right hold on a second uh let's let
07:32 - me take a minute to just sort of
07:33 - introduce myself perhaps there are new
07:35 - viewers here
07:36 - who have never tuned into the coding
07:37 - train before is that you
07:39 - if that is you please say hello in the
07:41 - chat uh robert
07:42 - uh perhaps has never tuned in before
07:44 - because robert asks
07:46 - is it 10 am or pm for you and it is most
07:49 - distinctly
07:50 - 10 am can't you tell by the glorious
07:53 - sunlight
07:54 - shining in on my face the sun has risen
07:56 - here in brooklyn new york
07:57 - out of the window of this attic i see
07:59 - steam
08:00 - coming from the rooftops of some other
08:02 - small building and some clouds going by
08:07 - i do have a lot of artificial sunlight
08:08 - here it's not really artificial sunlight
08:10 - i have this new elgato
08:11 - key lights elgato are you listening i
08:14 - really like your products did you notice
08:16 - how i also picked up this microphone
08:19 - oh um so that's why that's why i'm
08:22 - positively aglow
08:25 - well oh i was introducing myself so my
08:27 - name is dan
08:28 - um uh or daniel nobody ever calls me i
08:31 - don't know why when i say daniel i think
08:33 - i just said daniel
08:35 - you could call me daniel uh my name is
08:37 - daniel that was that's the name that i
08:39 - was given
08:40 - at the time of my birth oh many many
08:42 - many
08:43 - many years ago i was noticing by the way
08:47 - that um i have a rather young audience
08:50 - and i think that is positively
08:51 - delightful and wonderful um
08:53 - however if it is the morning for you and
08:56 - it is a beautiful day outside and you
08:58 - are part of the youth
08:59 - hey anybody really make sure you take
09:01 - some time to get some physical activity
09:04 - um um and
09:08 - uh sorry i'm very just i have like four
09:10 - different chats going out of the corner
09:11 - of my eye
09:12 - it's really hard to keep it all together
09:14 - i went off at some tangent about
09:16 - um having about um talking to the youth
09:20 - which really
09:21 - really really was the wrong uh train
09:24 - track let me
09:24 - get the train the switcher and go back
09:28 - down
09:28 - this track hello okay my name is dan uh
09:32 - i am somebody who likes to program the
09:34 - computer
09:35 - uh i am somebody who likes to make uh
09:37 - programming video tutorials
09:39 - and i have a youtube channel that you
09:41 - are currently watching
09:43 - where i release a lot of video tutorials
09:46 - and what you are watching right now is a
09:47 - live stream where i essentially
09:49 - uh waste a lot of time um answer some
09:51 - questions from the chat work on some
09:53 - kind of on
09:53 - work on some ongoing projects and read
09:56 - from a random numbers book so they're
09:58 - probably just to be clear
10:00 - better things you could do with your day
10:02 - but if you choose to be here i am
10:04 - grateful i am thankful
10:06 - um and there we go
10:09 - all right so i'm starting to think so i
10:11 - have this system by the way which is uh
10:13 - i got this like j
10:14 - like ultra wide monitor showing me like
10:16 - with like 15 different panels showing me
10:18 - all sorts of various things
10:21 - uh and like how many people are watching
10:23 - what the chat rate is and there's
10:25 - i have a new feature which um i'm going
10:27 - to pin this message
10:29 - from um kobe so
10:32 - you'll see a message that pops up above
10:33 - me this is my new methodology for
10:35 - featuring uh chat messages from the
10:38 - coding train discord
10:40 - right now this is only available to
10:42 - people who have joined as a youtube
10:44 - member which isn't necessarily my
10:47 - future plan forever but i'm sort of
10:51 - testing the system to figure out ways
10:54 - that
10:54 - i can take suggestions answer questions
10:58 - and show them here so i can pin
11:01 - and unpin messages as they come in let
11:04 - me get rid of kobe's message
11:06 - and um and simon asks
11:11 - what if uh just have the overlay on the
11:14 - scene so i think simon is wondering
11:18 - i'm a little awkward so um i don't want
11:20 - to just have a flood of messages going
11:22 - by i want to be able to curate them i
11:24 - want to be able to moderate them
11:25 - so this is the system that i'm working
11:26 - on this is part of um
11:30 - [Music]
11:32 - by the way this is kobe writes if you
11:35 - have no plan today dan you could work on
11:37 - the idea we discussed in dms
11:39 - oh you're so kind to think that my
11:41 - memory is intact and my brain works like
11:44 - a normal functioning human
11:45 - that i could positively pull out of the
11:47 - corners of the recesses of my mind the
11:49 - recollection of what was in our direct
11:51 - message i have no idea
11:52 - i'm gonna need a little bit help but
11:54 - what i wanted to do is thank um
11:56 - kobe and david who have been working on
11:58 - this particular system
12:00 - um it is called this stream chat um
12:03 - and you can um take a look you can you
12:06 - could get this stream chat for your
12:08 - it's like a bot and some software and
12:10 - all sorts of stuff
12:11 - it's really better for people who stream
12:12 - on twitch because it has a whole lot of
12:14 - twitch stuff i don't know
12:15 - david and kobe will post some
12:17 - information about that in the chat
12:19 - but thank you for um working on this um
12:22 - to help with the coding train
12:24 - interaction with the audience
12:25 - stuff so i do have some things
12:29 - that i specifically want to do uh today
12:33 - um let's let me pull up my handy
12:37 - dandy computer system here
12:40 - and so i have two kind of projects that
12:43 - i'm working on
12:44 - one is a live poll overlay which
12:47 - has come quite far along since the last
12:50 - time i live streamed
12:51 - so perhaps i could even use it today to
12:52 - do a quick poll to sort of pick the next
12:54 - thing to do
12:55 - that's something that i am sort of
12:57 - excited to start working with
12:59 - um i have been working also on this um
13:02 - presentation manager so right now i also
13:06 - in addition to doing this nonsense that
13:07 - i do on youtube
13:08 - i teach courses at new york university
13:11 - my copious amounts of spare time
13:14 - and um all the the courses that i'm
13:16 - teaching are currently fully remote
13:18 - um i'm using video conferencing software
13:22 - not a sponsor i'm just like this is just
13:25 - me
13:25 - like like asking for sponsors which is
13:28 - really a little bit
13:29 - weird anyway um so
13:32 - um and i've been struggling really with
13:34 - time management
13:36 - so i built this little tool that i can
13:39 - make a as a virtual camera out of it to
13:42 - pipe
13:42 - into uh let's just say it's zoom i'm
13:44 - using zoom okay
13:46 - not music zoom so i can create a zoom i
13:49 - can log
13:50 - into my class from a separate account
13:53 - that's different than me or i could do
13:54 - it as an overlay but the point of what
13:55 - i'm saying is
13:56 - this appears as a box in zoom and i can
13:59 - control it over web sockets to
14:00 - say who's going to be up next how much
14:02 - time you have left and really helps with
14:04 - um uh really helps with
14:12 - really helps with time management okay i
14:14 - got to pull up some of these messages
14:15 - that i'm enjoying
14:16 - so marcos says uh dan can only remember
14:18 - random numbers well i can't actually
14:20 - remember them
14:21 - the reason i don't need to remember them
14:22 - is because i have an entire book full of
14:24 - them
14:25 - and octopus would really like to see
14:27 - more of the live poll stuff
14:29 - octopus you are in luck so um
14:32 - these are ah the new year's event sketch
14:37 - right so that's i'm gonna save that
14:40 - though kobe that's great i
14:41 - think i'm gonna save that because um
14:43 - it's not yet december
14:45 - today is technically still november 29th
14:48 - it's still november
14:50 - and i am planning to do a lot of fun
14:54 - stuff for the holidays and new year's in
14:56 - december
14:57 - raise money for the processing
14:58 - foundation um
15:00 - do some community engagement stuff with
15:02 - all of you um and so that's coming but
15:04 - i'm gonna wait until december
15:06 - begins okay
15:09 - um is your shirt green by any chance it
15:12 - is not oh there is a cat
15:14 - make it come here there's a cat making
15:18 - some very loud noises over there look
15:20 - i have by the way also have a system
15:23 - by which i can show you the cat
15:27 - oh cat's leaving come on oh my god the
15:29 - cat has something in its mouth
15:32 - it's a toy it's one of my i think it's
15:34 - one of my daughter's toys
15:36 - but it looked like a little like a small
15:39 - rodent
15:40 - that it had captured all right i'm not
15:41 - going to worry about trying to show you
15:42 - the cat right now
15:44 - okay ah this is very hard to make but
15:46 - you know you just add
15:47 - one more piece of software on my console
15:49 - and i'm lost
15:51 - um so okay so these are two things live
15:53 - poll
15:54 - presentation manager let me also pull up
15:56 - something else
16:00 - i am now navigating over to my a twitter
16:02 - account
16:05 - um and looking for a particular
16:11 - uh tweet that i sent that's just a reply
16:15 - and let me see if i can find it aha here
16:18 - we go
16:20 - now i'm going to pull this back up
16:23 - for you to see so this is the other
16:25 - thing that i am very excited to maybe
16:27 - explore today
16:29 - open call for tiny code sketches
16:32 - tweet your creative code in less than
16:34 - 256 characters
16:36 - and we will display it on the media
16:37 - facade at media lab prado on
16:39 - saturday december 12th plus info so we
16:42 - can click over here so first of all
16:44 - um this is something that i have been
16:47 - following on social media for quite some
16:49 - time
16:50 - i uh i think there's a variety of
16:52 - different initiatives different hashtags
16:54 - there's one called twitter or something
16:56 - maybe even
16:57 - where people will post a very small
17:00 - amount of code that fits into a tweet
17:02 - along with a
17:02 - gif animation or recording of it and
17:05 - it's just it blows my mind what people
17:07 - are able to do
17:08 - and so what i want to work on today is
17:11 - not
17:12 - make my own submission to this that is
17:14 - not my role in the world
17:17 - my role in the world is to help other
17:19 - people like who are
17:20 - have creative ideas and uh think in
17:23 - beautiful wonderful ways to be able to
17:24 - share and express themselves
17:26 - and so if i can make a little example
17:28 - and some tips and tricks
17:30 - for how to get your p5 code down to
17:33 - or processing code or whatever your code
17:35 - might be down to a small number of
17:36 - characters
17:38 - um then um
17:42 - then i'm bringing up a question here um
17:45 - and then uh i'm excited about that so
17:48 - those are the three
17:50 - things on my list live poll
17:53 - presentation manager oh i got another
17:55 - thing on my list well
17:57 - i wanted to revisit my fall 2020 list to
18:00 - see how i did which is
18:01 - you know c plus b minus c plus i would
18:05 - give myself as a grade
18:07 - um um
18:10 - but um
18:14 - i also on this list i recall is i need
18:17 - to work i was
18:18 - planning to work on http uh this a new
18:21 - release of this particular processing
18:22 - library so many things to do
18:24 - and yet it's only 10 15. ah the whole
18:28 - day is ahead of me here
18:29 - okay what is on my hat not a very
18:32 - exciting answer
18:34 - uh but um it is a this is a baltimore
18:37 - orioles hat that is a
18:39 - baseball team here in these united
18:41 - states
18:42 - um i grew up in baltimore maryland i
18:44 - went to many a baltimore earl's game at
18:46 - the old
18:47 - memorial stadium i once i said recently
18:50 - i said to somebody oh you mean at the
18:51 - new stadium the news
18:52 - this is not going to be interesting to
18:54 - like 99.7 percent of you but i will just
18:57 - go with that for a second
18:59 - um the the current stadium in baltimore
19:02 - where the orioles play is called camden
19:04 - yards and to me that's the new stadium
19:05 - but
19:06 - somebody could look up on wikipedia it's
19:07 - probably been there for like 25 years at
19:09 - least
19:10 - uh but i think of it as the new stadium
19:13 - ah memorial stadium those were the days
19:17 - all right so um now i should be able to
19:20 - ooh so one thing that's tricky now
19:21 - here's some
19:22 - live feedback i've got it when there's a
19:24 - lot of messages coming in
19:26 - to the chat here i got to scroll back
19:28 - down to find the one to unpin
19:30 - okay um close out a bunch of things
19:33 - one thing i did which is very exciting
19:34 - my upgrade to my studio today is i
19:37 - moved the mouse got a usb extension so i
19:40 - can
19:40 - control it's not my laptop here which is
19:43 - a different computer
19:44 - it's not that interesting is it maybe
19:46 - it's interesting why everybody want a
19:47 - little behind the scenes
19:48 - let's look at a little behind the scenes
19:49 - for a second all right let's see if we
19:52 - can make this happen
19:53 - and then we're gonna then i'm gonna try
19:54 - to get the live poll going
19:56 - uh let's see connecting to your computer
20:00 - ensure that your phone and computer on
20:02 - the same wi-fi network or connected via
20:04 - the usb cable this should work
20:06 - come on fancy epoc cam thingy
20:11 - um let's see how do i get this to work
20:15 - not coming up so this is my new way of
20:19 - wirelessly connecting my phone
20:23 - camera
20:26 - and it's not working for whatever reason
20:28 - so i guess my little behind the scenes
20:30 - show and tell will have to wait until
20:32 - later
20:33 - okay um
20:40 - i don't even know how to turn this off
20:42 - now there we go
20:44 - all right i'll figure that out later um
20:49 - okay let's read some random numbers
20:55 - this always helps me feel
20:59 - relaxed soothed centered and ready to
21:02 - attack
21:03 - attack in a very friendly way give a
21:06 - nice
21:08 - friendly hug to the day
21:12 - oh wait
21:17 - uh speaking of discord
21:23 - bring this up here
21:30 - um i need to uh figure out so a couple
21:33 - things i want to mention about uh
21:34 - discord
21:35 - is that uh you may have noticed that i
21:38 - recently released
21:39 - a few uh three video tutorials on how to
21:43 - make a discord bot
21:44 - there are three more coming one is
21:48 - how to use env to hide your api keys uh
21:50 - it's about six minutes long
21:52 - i wouldn't be surprised if it's out on
21:54 - monday or tuesday very very short
21:56 - quick tutorial the one after that is how
21:59 - to
22:01 - um post uh gifs to discord
22:04 - um and you can see here that i've added
22:06 - a new command
22:07 - exclamation point gif uh kitten um
22:11 - and um so that there that is the next
22:14 - uh that's the s one of the video
22:17 - tutorials that is coming out how to do
22:18 - this
22:19 - and then the third video tour which will
22:21 - be a little bit
22:22 - later it was recorded separately and i'm
22:24 - just finishing getting it put together
22:26 - is about how to write a command handler
22:29 - hey wait a second k wickman is typing
22:32 - this is supposed to be a channel that
22:33 - only i have access to
22:34 - maybe that's not actually true
22:38 - um i don't know what's going on here
22:41 - so ah but the reason why i came into the
22:43 - discord is this is usually where i keep
22:44 - track of where i was in my quest
22:47 - my quest to read the entire book of
22:50 - random numbers it looks like the last
22:52 - time i did this
22:53 - was uh november 7th 2020
22:58 - and i finished up oh we should do some
23:00 - community contributions today of course
23:02 - i finished up on row 14 oh boy i'm still
23:05 - on page one everybody
23:07 - page one
23:10 - of my book um i
23:14 - uh need to go to row 14
23:17 - and column two all right let's see what
23:20 - we can get let's see if we can at least
23:22 - get
23:22 - maybe we can get to row 16 today that'll
23:24 - be really exciting

25:13 - oh you think
25:17 - [Music]
25:20 - well you know you win some you lose some
25:23 - um i guess i will have to figure that
25:25 - out also
25:26 - uh i don't know if the mic is actually a
25:29 - little bit quiet here let me turn that
25:30 - up
25:31 - uh okay music is overpowering the voice
25:35 - audio
25:36 - okay so is uh well hold on i gotta mute
25:39 - myself i'm about to sneeze this very
25:41 - exciting moment
25:44 - [Music]
25:53 - [Music]
26:10 - [Music]
26:16 - [Music]
26:22 - so
26:24 - [Music]
26:36 - do
26:38 - okay boy it's so many things to control
26:42 - right now i'm going a little crazy i
26:44 - can't even turn around
26:45 - the music okay i mean i
26:48 - i wish i could show you my behind the
26:50 - scenes here because i've got like the
26:51 - craziest console of stuff going on right
26:53 - now
26:54 - definitely need to get myself a purdue
26:57 - production team actually the most
26:59 - exciting thing if you will bear with me
27:01 - for a second
27:04 - um
27:06 - i i need somebody i need someone to give
27:07 - me like a really good
27:09 - uh quick um
27:12 - dad joke i know can you still hear me
27:17 - i guess why why why is um
27:21 - what's that number joke where nine is
27:23 - afraid of eight or something
27:25 - but eight is afraid of seven nine is
27:26 - afraid of seven because seven eight nine
27:34 - okay new drum new drum new drum set
27:38 - everybody i don't think that was worth
27:40 - it
27:42 - uh i can't show it to you because i
27:44 - can't seem to get my mobile camera
27:45 - working but
27:46 - um my son who plays the drums
27:50 - he's he got we got uh a friend was uh
27:53 - giving away their
27:54 - drum set so no more electronic drums for
27:56 - him a real
27:57 - life actual drum set let me get him up
27:58 - here to be my band leader
28:00 - um we'll see if we can make that happen
28:03 - for everybody at some point okay
28:09 - oh is that like really loud the um
28:16 - hold on i'm amazed by what's going on
28:19 - here
28:19 - ah too many things okay i need ghost
28:23 - chair yeah okay um
28:27 - all right all right all right settle
28:29 - down everybody
28:31 - let's take a minute to see if we can get
28:34 - the live
28:35 - poll going so um
28:38 - i am going to open up um i
28:41 - term here and uh check in
28:45 - on my live pull a web application
28:51 - grab the latest version of it now i seem
28:54 - to have made some changes here that i
28:56 - have no idea what they are
28:58 - uh let me move this down here and
29:01 - close this okay so many distractions all
29:04 - right
29:05 - so what's going on here i think if i
29:07 - type git diff
29:08 - it's gonna show me what weirdness i've
29:10 - put in here anything that i put into
29:12 - this can't possibly be
29:15 - uh stuff that i want so i'm gonna say
29:17 - git stash
29:18 - which will stash any weird changes that
29:20 - are in there then i can get
29:22 - uh what is actually
29:26 - from the repo let's open up the code
29:29 - and take a look so what is this live
29:32 - poll application so first of all i have
29:35 - a lot of people to thank
29:36 - um so one of the things i certainly
29:38 - realized is my
29:41 - technique of like putting out a web
29:43 - application into the world
29:44 - putting it on github having a bunch of
29:46 - people look at it and submit some issues
29:49 - and pull requests
29:50 - over a week and then me coming back to
29:52 - it live on stream to try to look at
29:54 - those pull requests
29:55 - analyze them understand them merge them
29:57 - resolve conflicts
29:58 - did not make for a good live stream
30:01 - i don't think that was a particularly
30:03 - productive use of anybody's time
30:05 - so i have been taking making some effort
30:08 - to manage this
30:10 - in between live streams so rather than
30:13 - try to merge a bunch of pull requests
30:15 - right now
30:16 - i can actually just go through and show
30:18 - you a bunch of things that have been
30:20 - added
30:21 - so there has been some restructuring and
30:23 - refactoring
30:24 - um one of the things you'll notice here
30:26 - to all of these ads so and so as a
30:28 - contributor ad so and so as a
30:29 - contributor
30:30 - this is something um new that i added if
30:32 - you're not familiar with there is a
30:34 - particular
30:36 - bot that you can um add
30:39 - onto a github repo
30:42 - it's called the all contributors bot and
30:45 - it follows this
30:46 - all contributors spec so this is a
30:49 - specification for recognizing
30:50 - contributors to an open source project
30:52 - in a way that rewards
30:53 - each and every contribution not just
30:55 - code this is something that i care
30:57 - very deeply about uh credit and
31:00 - acknowledging labor and credit and
31:02 - volunteerism and paying people
31:04 - and all of that all of the myriad
31:07 - kind of complicated discussions and
31:10 - topics that come
31:11 - up around open source software
31:13 - development so
31:14 - um there's no easy answers to all the
31:16 - different questions i ask myself
31:18 - all day long about how to work on open
31:21 - source in as inclusive in an equitable
31:23 - way as possible
31:24 - but i think all contributors is a good
31:26 - starting point
31:28 - so just so you know you can see here
31:30 - that anybody
31:31 - who has made a contribution whether it's
31:33 - an idea or a bit of code
31:34 - um can be acknowledged in the readme and
31:37 - it that process is automated
31:39 - so i don't know if um anyway so we'll
31:41 - see if
31:42 - i can demonstrate that actually let me
31:43 - demonstrate that right now
31:45 - um let's see here let's look at the
31:46 - issues
31:48 - um so actually i don't think i
31:51 - acknowledged
31:52 - john telton who and actually i want to
31:55 - look at this
31:56 - because i want to see if i can get this
31:57 - onto glitch um
32:01 - and so what i can do now because i have
32:03 - the all contributors bot
32:05 - added to this project i can say all
32:08 - contributors add
32:11 - john t alton4 and let's just say for
32:13 - ideas maybe there's one for like
32:15 - reference
32:16 - there's a there's a set a pre-written
32:19 - list
32:20 - of categories of kinds of contributions
32:22 - that you can tag people
32:24 - with um the one that always jumps to my
32:26 - mind is ideas so if i add this and i put
32:28 - a comment here
32:29 - um any moment now if i did that
32:31 - correctly we should see
32:34 - i can like play my little drum
32:38 - see i could actually get my son he can
32:41 - do this live
32:42 - but we can see we got this pull request
32:44 - so i can move on over to the pull
32:45 - request
32:48 - and um i'm just going to assume this is
32:51 - adding
32:51 - john talton as a contributor for ideas
32:54 - requested by shiffman in this comment
32:56 - and i can now squash and merge this
32:59 - and then if i go back to the main
33:03 - readme we'll see that john has been
33:06 - added here
33:07 - so this is one thing that's happened
33:10 - i think probably the most significant
33:13 - there's a couple of significant things
33:15 - that have changed
33:16 - um and it's actually interestingly
33:19 - enough now i'm noticing that it does
33:21 - create a lot of noise in the repo i
33:23 - don't know if there's a better way to
33:24 - manage that
33:25 - because now like i don't want to like
33:27 - find a couple of the key pull requests
33:29 - recently and there's like
33:30 - so many all contributors posts pull
33:32 - requests but
33:33 - that aside i still think it's a it's a
33:35 - it's a really great tool
33:36 - um there's a bunch of refactoring a
33:39 - bunch of
33:40 - like fixing just mistakes that happened
33:41 - as i just willy-nilly was merging
33:43 - people's pull requests without
33:44 - checking them there's no testing um
33:47 - fixing of the rats but i was looking for
33:48 - some of the design
33:49 - stuff um that i wanted to
33:54 - um coats this was super helpful by the
33:57 - way
33:57 - um i don't know too much about this
34:01 - but um this apparently so
34:04 - i'm like obsessed with code formatting
34:06 - and i
34:07 - really advocate that all of you watching
34:09 - do not don't be like me
34:12 - but um my shirt is not key this is a
34:16 - blue
34:16 - shirt oh it's totally what is going on
34:20 - why is it also half
34:21 - it's the same color is it because of
34:24 - this light
34:25 - wait a second this is the weirdest thing
34:27 - ever
34:29 - what is going on oh no that's it's not
34:31 - half it's just like actually keyed out
34:33 - okay i didn't realize that this shirt
34:34 - was
34:35 - gotta work on my key okay um
34:39 - so um
34:42 - so i'm trying to understand how to
34:47 - have good auto formatting of my code
34:51 - that maintains a set of standards
34:54 - and isn't isn't a barrier isn't like
34:58 - causing
34:59 - so much pain and suffering that it's
35:01 - actually making it harder to do a
35:02 - project but just keeping things neat and
35:04 - tidy
35:05 - and i think one of the things that's
35:06 - always been a point of confusion for me
35:08 - is
35:08 - and looking at this pull request it kind
35:10 - of helps me there's prettier
35:11 - there's eslint and there's husky so what
35:14 - are these things
35:16 - prettier from what i understand is a
35:18 - code
35:19 - formatting uh well it's what is it let's
35:22 - let's look at how does it define itself
35:24 - opinionated um code formatter so this
35:28 - actually uh form will format the code
35:31 - right put all the
35:32 - spacing in invitation in add semicolons
35:35 - make everything single quotes or double
35:36 - quotes
35:38 - i believe if i'm correct yes lint is not
35:42 - a code formatter but is a code linting
35:44 - which means
35:45 - we'll check your code to see whether it
35:47 - complies with a set of standards or not
35:51 - and then husky i guess is some kind of
35:54 - like
35:54 - dev tool that will write a bunch of
35:56 - scripts to reformat things with prettier
35:59 - check for mistakes with eslint
36:02 - is this um is this how interesting
36:05 - anyway so a lot of the stuff has been
36:06 - added
36:07 - so i would like to understand this
36:09 - better
36:11 - and one thing that i can see is that
36:13 - like ah so if i want to use
36:15 - single quotes there should be this
36:17 - prettier
36:18 - rc file which i can see here and single
36:22 - quotes i could change to true
36:26 - and then if i go to one of my
36:30 - bits of code somewhere let's find one
36:31 - that has quotes in it
36:33 - ah here if i now hit save
36:36 - i change it to single quotes now why did
36:38 - i get this weird error
36:40 - fail to load module if you have prettier
36:43 - or plug-ins referenced in package.json
36:45 - ensure that you have run npm install
36:47 - oh so the new aha
36:51 - because i pulled the code from this pull
36:53 - request down
36:54 - i now also need to run npm install to
36:57 - get the new
36:58 - packages like
37:03 - husky lint stage eslint plug-in printer
37:06 - and eslint
37:09 - lint stage eslint fix so much stuff
37:12 - so much stuff lint fix oh so these are
37:15 - some new things
37:17 - lint staged post install i don't know do
37:20 - i need to run this
37:22 - post install looks like i might right i
37:24 - assume i have to say like now npm run
37:26 - post i'm
37:29 - post install
37:33 - okay done husky is for universal git hux
37:38 - get hooks i cannot speak today
37:44 - all right so anyway moving along very
37:48 - very slowly here i now
37:50 - have in this project and one of the
37:53 - things i really like about working this
37:54 - way
37:55 - is on with these kind of weekend side
37:57 - projects meandering through figuring
37:59 - this stuff out is
38:00 - you know if i could get my act together
38:02 - eventually if i wanted to i could do
38:03 - some
38:04 - tutorials then that kind of go through
38:05 - some of these bits and pieces more step
38:07 - by step
38:08 - but um what i also wanted to highlight
38:11 - so thank you samuel
38:12 - martino martino for
38:16 - that but i wanted to look for the
38:19 - um some of the design stuff that was
38:22 - added
38:23 - see if i can find i mean let's see
38:24 - rainbow
38:26 - no i could have sworn
38:30 - seven days ago that pretty recently
38:34 - there was some work
38:37 - done to um add a bunch of visual design
38:40 - elements anyway i'm not it's not
38:41 - i'm not not finding it right now and i
38:44 - see that vishal in the chat says use
38:47 - typescript no i will never use
38:48 - typescript and then you could
38:50 - what like two years from now when like
38:52 - entire coding range is all typescript
38:53 - you can you can play that clip back for
38:55 - me
38:56 - um but let's let's see if we can get
38:58 - this running so there's a bit of
39:00 - awkwardness still with this live poll
39:03 - in that um there is no
39:07 - system to there's no uh endpoint
39:11 - or front-end page for creating a new
39:14 - poll it all happens manly right now
39:16 - by uncommenting and commenting back in
39:19 - this create new poll function
39:20 - so let me take a look at that um here
39:24 - so in um i'm looking for index.js
39:29 - or server index.js create new poll so
39:32 - let's see what happens there
39:35 - create new poll how come i can't find
39:38 - this
39:40 - here it is oh wait huh
39:45 - oh right okay so this is this is
39:48 - me so this is hard coding in a new poll
39:51 - which is certainly by the way there's a
39:53 - weird echo going on in here today
39:55 - so what should we do now i'll i'll leave
39:57 - that question
39:58 - or what next let's see
40:02 - so let's try oh this is good well except
40:05 - for bots
40:06 - so um ah so what do i do what what's the
40:10 - thing to say
40:11 - what what did i what was i calling that
40:12 - tiny code
40:14 - so these are three things i mean the
40:16 - live poll to be honest like
40:18 - it's it's a more live poll work look at
40:22 - community contributions or tiny code
40:24 - those will be the three options
40:26 - that i want to explore right now so
40:29 - i believe if i just put comment back in
40:31 - this create new poll function
40:34 - and uh let's follow the readme here
40:38 - um and
40:42 - okay i should could be running npm run
40:44 - dev already
40:48 - so that should have created the new poll
40:51 - then i want to go back and
40:52 - uncomment this
40:56 - so that should have restarted the server
40:59 - let's go to the server
41:02 - now why don't i see anything ah oh no
41:05 - so i need to then look at script.js
41:09 - line 36 so i probably need to then go
41:13 - into the database here
41:16 - and grab this id
41:19 - right this is the poll that i want to
41:20 - look at again all of this should
41:22 - eventually be automated in a very
41:24 - elegant way where i can just launch a
41:26 - poll through an interface
41:28 - but right now it's all very manual i'm
41:30 - going to grab that id
41:33 - and then i'm going to go to the web page
41:35 - that i'm looking at
41:36 - which can actually get uh get the poll
41:40 - id
41:40 - from url parameters but i could also
41:43 - just make it the default one right
41:45 - so if i go and make it
41:48 - the default poll id here paste that
41:52 - in then i should be able to refresh this
41:54 - page aha
41:57 - so here's a bug early bug
42:00 - if there are no votes it should probably
42:02 - have them all be
42:03 - zero percent so if i want to vote to
42:06 - continue working on the live
42:08 - poll i can see that that now is a
42:11 - hundred percent
42:12 - so in theory now and the other thing is
42:15 - this
42:16 - this does not need to have uh does not
42:18 - need to be keyed out so let me also
42:20 - change um the background
42:26 - um to be just transparent
42:29 - so i don't need a background color how
42:31 - do i comment something out in
42:35 - css that's weird how do you comment out
42:39 - css is that not possible
42:41 - oops i also just completely reformatted
42:45 - all of this
42:46 - somebody's got to know
42:49 - q a could be nice as well yeah i've
42:51 - never had a good luck with doing q and
42:53 - a's but
42:54 - um i guess i could just delete this
42:57 - fine delete this
43:02 - and refresh and that's good
43:06 - so now if i wanted to host this
43:10 - um well
43:13 - let's see let's do dude i um i can end
43:17 - rocket
43:24 - let's see so i'm going to use this um
43:26 - ngrok tool
43:29 - is this what i do
43:32 - no oh no ngrok http
43:36 - 3000. that's what i say okay so i should
43:39 - be so now people can actually go and
43:41 - vote right now
43:42 - um at this particular url
43:47 - which i can just put into um
43:51 - discord as well in the live links
43:53 - channel let's see does that actually
43:54 - work
43:57 - so if i vote here
44:01 - yeah so i don't know maybe maybe you're
44:03 - still 30 seconds behind
44:06 - so let's see if the votes can uh start
44:09 - coming
44:10 - in but what i want to do is get it as an
44:13 - overlay in open broadcast
44:15 - studio so oh i have my mouse here
44:19 - where is that um so i need to add a new
44:23 - browser source
44:27 - um and
44:32 - add and grok um and then
44:36 - look at its properties and i need to go
44:40 - to
44:42 - oh i can just copy this from discord
44:46 - uh where is that i'm going
44:49 - to
44:55 - um
44:58 - uh and i want to deploy this to glitch
45:01 - so give me a moment i'm going to do that
45:03 - next but i just want to see if this
45:04 - works
45:05 - i'm looking for where is
45:08 - my links okay
45:12 - copy link
45:15 - paste link okay
45:18 - and there we go it should be
45:23 - uh the live poll should be going now uh
45:26 - visually i've got a bit of an
45:28 - issue here where
45:31 - maybe um i need to think about how to
45:33 - make it appear
45:34 - better because i could go over to here
45:38 - um and well i don't know what is gone
45:41 - happening there let's go to um
45:45 - transform reset
45:50 - there we go so now i guess i guess
45:55 - so now i can cut this
45:58 - off and here we go
46:03 - so uh go ahead and
46:10 - [Music]
46:12 - vote
46:17 - as no one pasted the link into the
46:18 - actual chat i will do so
46:29 - [Music]
46:31 - this is very exciting
46:35 - there's apparently there's 500 people
46:37 - watching which is kind of nuts
46:40 - um
46:43 - [Music]
46:44 - tiny code is growing
46:48 - [Music]
46:50 - very dramatic
46:56 - you don't store the so somebody did make
47:00 - a uh pull request
47:05 - there was a pull request that did
47:07 - something to protect against stuffing
47:10 - the ballot
47:11 - oh god no please can i not talk about
47:14 - voting
47:16 - um i've got some breaking news here
47:22 - everybody
47:24 - breaking news 46 of coding trained
47:27 - viewers
47:29 - are so meta they just want to vote
47:32 - for working on the voting system itself
47:38 - yes you can vote multiple times
47:41 - i think but somebody did put something
47:44 - in there was a particular let's see if i
47:48 - can
47:49 - get to it here there was a particular
47:54 - pull request
47:55 - that had some kind of like validation
47:58 - thing involved with it
48:01 - um
48:04 - what is going on where am i oh i mean
48:06 - all contributors i want to go
48:07 - here uh there was a pull request
48:11 - that somebody implemented to do some um
48:14 - validation and and protection simple
48:17 - time-based anti-spam package and test
48:20 - so this was crunchy pie um
48:24 - who added a package for lightweight
48:26 - anti-spam guard it's time based
48:29 - so so i think what
48:32 - if i'm looking at this right that maybe
48:35 - this just protects you from voting
48:38 - more than once within a very short
48:40 - period of time
48:42 - so i think you can vote again but you
48:44 - have to wait
48:46 - 30 seconds 60 seconds i'm not entirely
48:49 - sure you can reload the ip
48:51 - um and you could but okay tiny code is
48:55 - now
48:55 - anyway i didn't mean for this to be
48:58 - super scientific
49:00 - um do not use the rainbow it's not
49:02 - colorblind accessible yes so that's also
49:05 - uh thank you for pointing that out
49:07 - prathamesh
49:08 - um one thing that's very important to
49:10 - consider
49:11 - is accessibility in design and which is
49:15 - to sort of uh you know my
49:17 - understanding of sort of what primary
49:19 - thing to look at is contrast
49:20 - color contrast um and so
49:24 - crabby says i use set interval anyway
49:27 - i voted 18 times
49:34 - and octopus is very sad here tiny code
49:37 - overtook the live poll all right well
49:39 - um there we go uh this was interesting
49:42 - to see
49:44 - i used a clicker says anti-venom that
49:47 - must be some fancy futuristic technology
49:50 - here
49:54 - all right so i do want to definitely
49:57 - take a look at the tiny code stuff
50:00 - this is so weird this is like this is
50:02 - like oppo this is like bizarro coding
50:05 - train i started on time
50:07 - i was like i must be running out of time
50:08 - now it's only 10 45. i'm like
50:10 - doing this for hours on end um
50:16 - and um but uh
50:19 - bader says they spammed tiny code the
50:22 - anti-spam isn't connected um so where do
50:26 - i
50:26 - say samuel martino
50:32 - so cross says that they are colorblind
50:35 - um and so uh definitely fi if um you
50:38 - know cross i hopefully um
50:40 - if you have some experience with this
50:41 - whether your own personal experience or
50:42 - as a designer
50:44 - uh color um if uh if you want to file an
50:47 - issue
50:47 - um that um to um i would love to correct
50:52 - the a rainbow design and use a different
50:55 - design
50:55 - so that it is accessible to anyone who
50:59 - has color blindness
51:00 - or any other type of vision impairment
51:03 - okay all right so
51:06 - moving along here
51:10 - let's uh put the so the so what
51:14 - what next let me solicit some help from
51:17 - people
51:18 - so what are some things that need to
51:20 - happen next
51:21 - for the live poll i will make
51:25 - an issue here and i will say
51:30 - help wanted
51:35 - um future improvements now ordinarily i
51:38 - might suggest
51:39 - oh and you're not seeing what i'm doing
51:41 - here ordinarily i might suggest
51:44 - um
51:48 - and uh let's see here nope
51:52 - shoot the wrong one okay ordinarily i
51:55 - might suggest a
51:56 - separate issue for each uh
52:00 - improvement or bug report but because
52:03 - i'm live streaming and i want to move
52:04 - quickly here i just want to
52:06 - create a quick list of things that are
52:09 - um ah and
52:13 - flesh mash mesh mesh in prathamesh
52:16 - is pronounced like it rhymes with flesh
52:19 - let's let me practice this one
52:20 - another thing that's very important to
52:22 - me is pronouncing people's names
52:24 - correctly
52:25 - um i do my best i don't always remember
52:27 - it's something that i really
52:28 - work on with students that i have in my
52:30 - nyu classes it's
52:31 - you know i feel like it's not their job
52:34 - to
52:34 - correct me or to sit quietly while i
52:36 - mispronounce their names
52:37 - it's my job to learn to pronounce names
52:39 - correctly
52:40 - um and so the mesh in profamesh is
52:44 - pronounced like it rhymes with flesh not
52:45 - mash
52:46 - so profamesh hopefully that was an
52:49 - improvement
52:50 - on the pronunciation now so what are
52:53 - some things that need to happen next
52:55 - deploy to glitch which i could work on
52:58 - today myself
53:00 - um oh yeah a different cat has emerged
53:03 - by the way
53:04 - um uh accessibility
53:08 - concerns uh color um rainbow color
53:12 - etc
53:15 - um uh what else um
53:21 - endpoint for new poll and front
53:24 - and for new poll uh anti-spam
53:28 - protections what else
53:33 - um oh yeah and there was a suggestion
53:35 - it's already in there as an issue
53:37 - to add web sockets so that
53:41 - so that would be a nice improvement um
53:44 - okay
53:45 - so what else am i missing anything
53:47 - important um i'm going to
53:50 - submit this issue these will be things
53:53 - that i will hopefully consider for next
53:54 - week also
53:56 - i have to figure out how to have i guess
53:58 - another question is
54:01 - um i'm gonna make this a new issue
54:05 - uh overlay design
54:09 - how um different
54:12 - views for uh
54:16 - different scenarios in obs
54:19 - for example
54:23 - um maybe a semi-transparent
54:27 - background for when the obs
54:30 - video is very noisy and busy
54:34 - i don't that makes sense what i'm saying
54:36 - here
54:39 - transparent all right
54:42 - all right
54:49 - moving along
54:52 - [Laughter]
54:54 - let me move to looking at
54:57 - uh so i i would love for people to
54:59 - continue
55:00 - to work on this submit pull requests
55:02 - file issues
55:04 - i'm trying to keep an eye on it over the
55:05 - course of the week i'm kind of managing
55:07 - this myself
55:08 - doing a pretty poor job of it but i i
55:10 - welcome your contributions
55:12 - um now
55:16 - let's move on to
55:19 - looking at tiny code sketches
55:23 - so i want to understand um
55:27 - um how this works what are what are some
55:29 - of the let me see if i can find very
55:31 - briefly
55:32 - um
55:35 - one of the hashtags that i really like
55:40 - um shoot is kind of awkward that i'm not
55:49 - signed in
55:49 - on twitter but i think it's fine so also
55:51 - i'm looking for something
55:56 - um yeah so
56:02 - ah natto must be watching i'm looking
56:04 - under um
56:05 - because natto just uh screenshot the
56:08 - poll
56:08 - on twitter the reason why i'm looking
56:10 - for an alto i don't know if i'm
56:11 - pronouncing your name correctly
56:13 - um i would love help with that i'm
56:15 - looking for maybe you can help me with
56:17 - this
56:17 - um if you're in the chat i i feel like i
56:19 - went to your twitter instantly to find
56:22 - some of the hashtags
56:23 - i feel like you're always retweeting um
56:25 - tinycode sketches
56:27 - um so ah okay uh here we go
56:31 - let's look at this casey reese tweet
56:34 - which i think has a couple
56:35 - this is this is perfect um
56:38 - so um i am at this tweet now
56:42 - where i believe that these are two
56:44 - hashtags that are used quite commonly
56:47 - for these um tiny code challenges so
56:50 - let's click on both of these
56:52 - and let's take a look oh they couldn't
56:55 - you believe that this game
56:56 - it's like i i just like oh my god i
56:59 - can't believe how wonderful this is like
57:00 - the greatest thing ever
57:02 - and i can't i'm only sad that i didn't
57:04 - make it myself
57:05 - i can't believe this came up so perfect
57:08 - so here's the idea
57:09 - and what i what i wanted to do was start
57:12 - to understand
57:14 - how like what are some of these tricks
57:17 - here
57:18 - that are being used to
57:21 - whittle down a longer piece of code into
57:24 - something shorter so i
57:25 - thought what might make sense is for me
57:27 - to take one of my coding challenges
57:30 - um and right so there is a
57:34 - the concept thank you to uh
57:37 - kobe who's posted the concept is known
57:39 - as code
57:40 - golfing so i i'm quite familiar
57:44 - with it as a regex golf which is this
57:46 - idea of like
57:47 - trying to write the shortest regular
57:48 - expression to match a particular pattern
57:51 - um so um but in a way like i think of
57:56 - i you know i don't love the sort of
57:58 - competitive
57:59 - nature of code golfing um
58:02 - what i think is wonderful about this
58:06 - is it's not really about having the
58:08 - shortest code
58:09 - it's about this sort of creative
58:11 - constraint because
58:12 - there's nothing inherently better but
58:15 - this sketch fits into
58:17 - fewer characters than what it is right
58:19 - now as long as it can fit within this
58:20 - constraint
58:21 - of a single tweet um so let's see let's
58:24 - so first of all let's just
58:27 - let's just prove the point that this
58:29 - works by going to the p5 web editor
58:32 - and let's um what should i call this
58:36 - um so this is i'm just going to put a
58:39 - comment here i'm just going to
58:42 - let's get to this yeah perfect it's
58:45 - going to put a comment
58:46 - in here
58:49 - and now i think i can close this
58:52 - um let's go to here and let's grab this
58:56 - code
59:00 - and let's run it and whoa
59:04 - wow ah interesting so what's
59:08 - missing why is this showing up
59:12 - differently now a couple ah okay
59:16 - i i do oh i know why
59:19 - so a little uh unfortunate thing
59:21 - happened here
59:22 - where um the emojis uh didn't copy paste
59:26 - correctly
59:27 - so let's see if i can replace those
59:32 - with my own let's see so let me get to
59:35 - a tree let's put this here
59:40 - and then let's put the tram
59:44 - tram car train which was what was used
59:47 - here
59:47 - let's just try i don't know if um
59:52 - i don't know if it matters let's just
59:53 - use this one tram car
59:55 - and let's run it there we go
59:58 - and what is there another one that i'm
60:00 - missing here
60:02 - or yeah no that's just
60:05 - ah there's no white uh so i suppose
60:10 - would it if i did this
60:20 - there we go so i've gotten something
60:22 - close now so there's
60:23 - a little bit of extra stuff there and
60:25 - let me just
60:41 - so what is the magic of what's happening
60:44 - here
60:45 - there's a lot of tricks to this first of
60:48 - all no semicolons
60:50 - lots of one character variable names
60:54 - create it's really unfortunate that
60:56 - create canvas is such a
60:58 - long word but let's let's go to
61:02 - uh codingtrain.com let's go to the
61:03 - coding challenges
61:06 - and let's find one
61:09 - um and see if we can fit it into a tweet
61:15 - the raycasting one is kind of
61:16 - interesting i don't know if anybody has
61:18 - a particular oh i'm in in dark
61:21 - mode also right that's that's why in the
61:23 - web editor thank you that's
61:24 - obviously a great point like could i
61:27 - um like well no i can't get the open
61:30 - simplex noise loop to work
61:32 - because it requires um a whole separate
61:35 - library but i could
61:37 - try like a perlin noise loop that's an
61:39 - interesting one to try
61:42 - um let's look at the code for this one
61:48 - yeah so for example
61:51 - could i fit this into a tweet
61:57 - um and right and
62:00 - um this is a great comment also from
62:03 - [Music]
62:04 - uh kobe who says code golfing is an art
62:08 - in this case and not a competition which
62:09 - makes it beautiful and i i really do
62:11 - agree with that sentiment
62:13 - um so let's see oh the meta balls one is
62:16 - also a good one
62:17 - i don't know i think i'm going to try
62:18 - this one so let me duplicate it
62:24 - and um so let's try this as purlin
62:29 - noise loop tiny
62:32 - code okay and uh
62:36 - in case anyone wants to follow along i'm
62:38 - really
62:40 - i think i'm having an allergy to my pets
62:42 - today
62:43 - um you know actually i was cleaning up
62:45 - up here in the attic and i think i
62:46 - kicked up a lot of dust i'm constantly
62:48 - feeling like i need to sneeze so i
62:50 - apologize
62:54 - it's coming along um let me post a link
62:57 - to this sketch
62:59 - so if people want to follow along you
63:01 - know as i save you'll be able to refresh
63:03 - this url and you'll get the code
63:06 - so let's see so i'm going to get rid of
63:09 - the slider first of all
63:12 - and just have it be a fixed value
63:16 - so where what this noise max
63:20 - uh what what did we have the slider
63:22 - range it started at
63:24 - uh between 0 and 10 and the default was
63:26 - 3.
63:28 - so let me just get rid of the slider
63:29 - here and change
63:32 - the um
63:36 - this to three
63:40 - now i wish i had a chrome extension or
63:43 - something that could
63:44 - actively count the number of characters
63:46 - i have here i mean
63:47 - i could always
63:51 - just go whoops well i'm not logged i
63:54 - can't
63:55 - uh i guess i need to log into twitter
63:57 - let's let's let's make that happen
63:59 - people
64:00 - um give me a second here
64:03 - um
64:03 - [Music]
64:10 - login
64:12 - it's gonna take me an hour to log into
64:14 - my twitter account because i have to
64:17 - look up my password at my password
64:18 - manager
64:20 - and um
64:26 - uh talk amongst yourselves for a minute
64:30 - here people
64:41 - [Music]
64:52 - do
64:57 - [Music]
65:03 - [Music]
65:36 - [Music]
65:42 - [Music]
65:48 - do
65:52 - [Music]
65:57 - okay i i was much too afraid to log into
66:00 - my actual twitter account
66:02 - so i logged into this account for a
66:04 - twitter bot example that i was
66:06 - been working on and just for the sake of
66:08 - argument what i want to do is go
66:10 - over to um
66:14 - the p5 web editor grab this code and
66:18 - paste it in here so we can see here this
66:20 - is how
66:21 - i am oh it's
66:24 - wow look at this because it's in the
66:26 - code comments it actually
66:30 - gave a little preview to the video here
66:32 - so i'm 441 characters over so we got to
66:34 - get
66:35 - get working on this first of all i think
66:37 - we can get rid of all of these
66:40 - um let's do auto refresh i'm not you
66:43 - know um
66:44 - so the uh i was gonna say i i don't need
66:46 - the slider sorry
66:47 - um i can see immediately that i don't
66:50 - need this noise max
66:52 - variable because i can just put three
66:54 - and three here
66:57 - um i
67:00 - um phase can be a one
67:04 - letter variable z offset can be a one
67:06 - letter variable
67:08 - so let's do p p z
67:12 - let's call this x y
67:15 - x so i'm just like lowering variable
67:18 - names right now
67:19 - um and shape close
67:23 - p and z so even just with
67:28 - x has already been declared oh um
67:31 - so this is totally extra stuff that i
67:33 - don't need
67:37 - here let's look at this
67:41 - okay so we can see even with just making
67:44 - some
67:45 - one ver a tiny code is 256 that's
67:48 - correct
67:49 - so the limit this is a um sorry this is
67:51 - a really good
67:52 - um comment from octopus twitter has a
67:55 - limp character of 280 characters i
67:57 - believe the constraint for the tiny code
67:58 - challenge
67:59 - is uh 256. so i should
68:03 - try to make that i can use tau rather
68:06 - than two pi
68:11 - there we go all right so i'm going to
68:12 - definitely be taking your suggestions
68:14 - from the chat
68:16 - uh thank you for that one luke finch um
68:19 - arrow functions and no let const for
68:22 - variables so here's another one let's do
68:24 - this
68:25 - so instead of saying function setup can
68:28 - be
68:29 - this and draw
68:34 - can be this i think is how i have to
68:36 - write it
68:39 - still good and no let and const so i
68:43 - think i could do
68:43 - this right p comma z equals zero
68:49 - no p is not defined
68:56 - is that a thing yeah i didn't know you
69:00 - could do that but
69:01 - let's say that all right so let's see
69:02 - how we're doing character wise
69:07 - right i'm now fitting into a tweet i'm
69:09 - only 178 i just like lost 300 characters
69:12 - amazing
69:14 - so now um all of the white space can go
69:18 - right so um
69:26 - all right so this
69:29 - i mean i still need to be able to follow
69:31 - it somehow
69:37 - i should be able to just say clear
69:40 - that is much better
69:44 - do i need to do translate
69:48 - probably
69:52 - translate so this i could also do
69:55 - as this
70:00 - i mean do i need a stroke weight of two
70:04 - do i need to say no phil
70:10 - now here's the question
70:15 - radians of five
70:21 - uh no the other way around five degrees
70:24 - so point like i do about point zero
70:27 - eight
70:28 - um
70:36 - oh no no there needs to be a space there
70:40 - don't auto format no no no format
70:47 - uh okay
70:50 - so there's also this simon is saying use
70:54 - underscore instead of parentheses
70:58 - friends this is not something i know
71:00 - about
71:01 - i can do this
71:04 - huh i never have seen this what the
71:07 - what is that that i have never seen use
71:10 - minifire so right
71:12 - so who am i suggesting i could use a
71:14 - minifier but
71:16 - i kind of want to do this manually to
71:18 - understand
71:19 - uh draw so that's saving me a character
71:22 - still good still good
71:24 - um i feel like i can get away without
71:28 - using
71:29 - map
71:32 - there's got the math for this is much
71:34 - simpler right
71:35 - like i could just say right
71:39 - six times cosine
71:43 - plus three right that's that's the
71:46 - equivalent of this map function
71:49 - so y equals six times
71:53 - sine
71:57 - plus three is this still working
72:01 - oh i did something weird
72:05 - i thought i would go wasn't i mapping it
72:07 - between
72:09 - it's fine i like this anyway did i am i
72:11 - confused
72:21 - i'm i'm lost here oh no no plus
72:25 - it should be three times plus three
72:27 - there we go
72:28 - right because i'm trying to now
72:32 - um sorry i
72:36 - my system for comments is i'm now like
72:40 - if i so i think what i need by the way
72:42 - here's a little feedback for
72:43 - uh just stream chat if i pin something
72:46 - it needs to stay on the top
72:48 - of needs to stay on the top of the
72:51 - scroll
72:52 - so i can always like go out of order so
72:54 - i can always just unpin it
72:55 - and then i can go back because now i
72:57 - have to like
72:58 - get through a whole lot of comments to
73:00 - find the ones that i pinned also the
73:02 - green is
73:03 - very hard for me to see little comments
73:05 - you guys can't see this but i could uh
73:07 - um all right so now uh r
73:11 - is map noise and
73:14 - right i don't need to have these
73:16 - separate variables
73:19 - this goes here
73:22 - this goes i'm going to get to do so much
73:24 - more i have so many characters left
73:26 - z and i
73:31 - can i don't need the map function right
73:34 - r oh no do i yeah
73:38 - r equals noise
73:41 - of three times cosine plus three three
73:43 - times sine and i'm mapping it goes
73:45 - between
73:46 - 0 and 1 and i want it to be
73:50 - between 100 and height divided by 2.
73:53 - so times
73:59 - 200 plus one let's just do that for
74:01 - right now
74:03 - then vertex
74:07 - set the vertex
74:15 - uh end shape
74:20 - get rid of some spaces and
74:25 - how am i doing people look at that i got
74:28 - 12 more characters left to go
74:30 - oh amazing
74:34 - wow oh i messed something up here
74:37 - but um
74:40 - there we go uh so hold on hold on let me
74:43 - finish this off this is very exciting
74:46 - now i do want to log into my real
74:47 - twitter account so i can tweet it
74:54 - i still have uh line breaks
75:05 - no i messed something up um
75:15 - what did i mess up
75:22 - ah because if i put everything on the
75:26 - same line that needs a semicolon i guess
75:30 - there we go
75:36 - look at me so did i get this into 256
75:40 - that's the question
75:43 - um do i have enough i have enough space
75:46 - for the hashtag that's for sure
75:50 - uh the question is
75:55 - do i um
75:58 - [Music]
76:00 - the other thing about this the whole
76:01 - point of this demonstration is that it's
76:03 - a loop
76:06 - it'll actually like animate a loop but
76:11 - i could rename sine and cosine to s and
76:14 - c
76:15 - that's interesting would that really
76:17 - save me
76:18 - a lot of space it might because am i
76:20 - using them a bunch of times
76:23 - like in other words
76:26 - if i go back to
76:35 - does this still work no
76:38 - oh because it's not in setup
76:45 - so that works and then
76:50 - and then c s
76:54 - c s
76:58 - that's interesting did i save characters
77:00 - there
77:04 - so currently this is with 17 additional
77:07 - characters
77:08 - third no that's
77:12 - that added characters me adding s equals
77:15 - sine c equals cosine that added
77:17 - characters is that really true
77:31 - let's see here yeah i did
77:34 - so how many characters is this is um
77:40 - is this so if i do
77:49 - 263 so to get this
77:52 - in the let in the for loop there's a let
77:54 - in the for loop okay
77:56 - thank you everybody that will get me a
77:59 - bunch
78:00 - where's my let
78:04 - and also can i get away with this
78:08 - yep so i don't need that
78:11 - zero leading zero
78:15 - i don't need this one i don't need this
78:17 - one
78:20 - okay that's good
78:27 - so now
78:32 - wait uh
78:33 - [Music]
78:38 - oh i need to i need to shave off two
78:40 - more characters
78:42 - shave off two more characters what can i
78:44 - shave off here
78:46 - there's a semicolon oh there we go
78:48 - there's one
78:50 - one more character
79:00 - um
79:03 - i mean i
79:06 - could does this close actually really
79:11 - necessary
79:15 - or is it enough that it will get there
79:19 - no whoops shoot what did i just do
79:26 - uh oh what error do i have
79:34 - i have lost something
79:40 - ah
79:44 - i don't know what that is
79:49 - oh did i get rid of that no the clue
79:50 - okay so now let me get rid of the
79:52 - clothes
79:56 - well
79:59 - i guess i could have it have one more i
80:01 - i could have it
80:03 - um by the way i really like how this
80:04 - looks i could
80:06 - have it be
80:09 - divisible perfectly by
80:13 - two pie
80:16 - let's put the clothes back so right now
80:18 - i feel like i need the clothes
80:22 - and but do i have
80:33 - i did it
80:37 - okay so now
80:41 - now i need to capture this as a gif
80:44 - that perfectly loops
80:49 - how do i render it with a perfect loop
80:53 - oh my god um well here first let me hit
80:56 - save
80:58 - i should now i should really log into my
81:00 - actual twitter account so
81:02 - i'm gonna do something ill-advised
81:07 - first of all i'm gonna paste this into
81:09 - just a text file here
81:11 - then i'm gonna hit auto format just
81:13 - curious
81:14 - okay that's better i prefer to look at
81:17 - it this way anyway
81:19 - so if i wanted to get the idea of this
81:22 - also is that it's a loop
81:25 - so um i believe
81:33 - oh i don't know that it's oh this is
81:35 - just a closed
81:36 - loop here uh it won't be a perfect loop
81:41 - yeah no no i was i forgot this is part
81:43 - of my series about
81:45 - how to make a perfect loop with noise
81:48 - but i'm not loop i'm not making a
81:50 - perfect loop of the animation i would
81:51 - need a
81:52 - fourth dimension there i think or just
81:55 - have the z
81:56 - value um be walking through
82:00 - walking through circular values anyway
82:03 - um
82:03 - so i'll just i'll just capture this
82:07 - this way and we're gonna make
82:11 - our so i know hopefully this helps
82:13 - people sort of see
82:14 - some tips and techniques of things you
82:16 - could do
82:18 - um whoops
82:24 - um let's clear all these i don't know
82:26 - what's in here
82:28 - uh clear captures yes
82:32 - um and let's just grab a small amount of
82:34 - this
82:35 - i think maybe i'm where's 400 400 let's
82:43 - okay let's also
82:54 - what was i trying to do here um
82:58 - oh wait where am i what's going on
82:59 - people
83:01 - um would i let's change the stroke
83:04 - weight
83:06 - to four i think that'll look a little
83:09 - nicer
83:12 - to eight
83:18 - to two here what's p
83:21 - doing well that's the phase
83:24 - uh i can't add can i add an extra
83:27 - character
83:29 - no that's not what i want okay don't
83:31 - stop
83:32 - stop i don't care all right let's let's
83:35 - go back to
83:36 - uh four all right so now i want to
83:39 - record this for a little bit
83:43 - we'll just do like a little 10 second or
83:46 - five second
83:47 - gif
83:54 - um pixel size original is fine
83:59 - save as uh
84:03 - gif desktop noise
84:06 - tiny code
84:11 - could i
84:16 - i give it like a higher frame rate and
84:17 - will it still
84:20 - um tolerate me
84:26 - [Music]
84:28 - yeah okay so now what's the only thing i
84:32 - changed was
84:33 - four right all right i think i have to
84:36 - post this from my actual
84:40 - uh thank you to john person
84:43 - um for your very kind
84:46 - uh donation it's much appreciated uh i
84:50 - don't believe that it will become
84:51 - self-aware a random number yes john
84:53 - person will get a random number
84:56 - um but i gotta finish this i gotta
84:57 - finish what i'm doing here
84:59 - so uh i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and
85:01 - log community contributions have moved
85:03 - up into the poll
85:04 - so that's what we'll do next um i am
85:08 - going to
85:08 - move to signing into my actual twitter
85:12 - account
85:13 - um because i believe now this should be
85:17 - posted from my actual twitter account
85:19 - where are we 11 20
85:21 - okay log out
85:25 - how do i log out oh add existing account
85:29 - uh shiffman this will take a moment here
85:34 - for me to find my twitter account
85:38 - password
85:46 - i suppose i should mute my for all of
85:49 - you people who are picking up my
85:50 - password from my keys
86:08 - okay two factoring myself in
86:17 - and tweet
86:23 - okay so now um here we are i should be
86:27 - able to
86:28 - grab code what was the one thing i
86:32 - changed i just made the stroke weight
86:39 - so that goes there tiny code
86:43 - is that the hashtag i want i also want
86:48 - oops
86:50 - um i like this one p5t
86:56 - um they both fit um
87:02 - coding train can you do
87:05 - a
87:09 - train as a hashtag not really right
87:15 - um okay so i've got seven characters
87:18 - left i don't know what to do
87:22 - uh
87:26 - okay what's happening here um
87:30 - all right so i've got this now what do i
87:32 - want next
87:35 - i want to
87:39 - get that gif
87:44 - and put it here ah
87:48 - oh internet there we go
87:52 - come on there we go there we go um add a
87:55 - description
87:57 - sure um a
88:01 - wiggly like
88:04 - a circular
88:09 - jagged polygon with
88:12 - white outline and no fill
88:15 - jiggles and rotates with purlin
88:19 - noise okay so got that
88:24 - so i think i think i'm good to go
88:27 - i'm ready to tweet this this is very
88:29 - exciting
88:31 - uh arnov is trying the hilbert curve
88:33 - would have been a good one
88:35 - the hilbert curve that's a probably that
88:37 - that's i
88:39 - oh now i want to do it with the hilbert
88:40 - curve let's do the hilbert curve after
88:42 - this
88:43 - why not should i do another live poll
88:44 - since that was so successful
88:46 - all right let's tweet this one out and
88:49 - watch
88:51 - watch the likes and replies come in
88:57 - look at this look at this ah oh give me
89:00 - those fake internet points
89:02 - all i ever wanted was fake internet
89:03 - points the real internet points
89:10 - anybody got it under 200 oh oh so um if
89:14 - anybody
89:17 - has gotten it shorter particularly if
89:20 - you're in the member discord chat
89:22 - and you want to paste it in a discord
89:24 - message i can feature that on screen
89:28 - look at my internet points they're just
89:30 - like flowing overflowing
89:34 - i really i'm not i should not be allowed
89:36 - to do what i'm doing what is going on
89:37 - with
89:38 - this message all right um
89:43 - oh this was fun uh okay okay everyone
89:46 - wants me to give the random number to
89:47 - the john person all right so first of
89:48 - all i just want to say
89:49 - thank you for your super chat i wanted
89:52 - to be clear that i
89:53 - do appreciate the donations they
89:55 - actually make a difference here in terms
89:57 - of
89:58 - uh the sort of mental budget i have for
90:00 - the channel and things that i'm buying
90:02 - for equipment and
90:03 - having time to do it and i appreciate
90:04 - everybody's membership but i do
90:06 - want to be it's really thoughtful about
90:09 - um uh how i ask for that
90:12 - hey i i don't i'm not actually
90:14 - soliciting your donations or your
90:15 - memberships it's great if you can
90:17 - support in that way
90:18 - but if you do have um i'm doing fine
90:21 - and if you are looking to donate i might
90:24 - suggest a local food bank
90:26 - or um any other sort of non-profit
90:29 - that's helping people who
90:30 - um really really need the help
90:32 - especially in this difficult time
90:34 - and then if after you've donated there
90:36 - you want to donate some to me still
90:37 - that's great
90:38 - also of course the processing foundation
90:41 - i will be doing a fundraiser for them in
90:44 - july but for your donation
90:49 - john person i would like to provide you
90:54 - with your very own random number
90:57 - [Music]
91:00 - the setup function does not need the
91:02 - curly braces
91:03 - oh that's a good one thank you mika
91:05 - [Music]
91:14 - uh eleven thousand and six hundred it's
91:17 - quite a round number oh
91:18 - niraj stop for the donations people
91:21 - niraj thank you for blinking my lights
91:28 - and connor all these random numbers
91:31 - okay okay okay the eggs i
91:35 - [Music]
91:38 - 8781 29643
91:45 - okay thank you everybody ron and uh not
91:48 - ron connor
91:50 - uh simon posted this trick five
91:53 - times sorry simon i missed it uh
91:57 - all right now
92:00 - um
92:04 - let's see i kind of want to go do the
92:05 - hilbert so where
92:07 - oh i see set up there and so why don't i
92:11 - need the curl i don't need the curly
92:12 - braces because it's
92:13 - one line of code that's cool to see
92:16 - okay um let's do let's do one more
92:19 - because i can't now i'm having fun i
92:21 - can't resist this um let's do one more
92:30 - um let's grab the hilbert curve code
92:37 - and let's do duplicate hilbert curve
92:41 - tiny code um
92:45 - save and then for anybody who
92:48 - is looking for this later i posted the
92:50 - link in the discord okay
92:52 - so let's look here let's make sure this
92:54 - works
92:55 - ooh oh this is my crazy rainbow one too
92:58 - all right
92:59 - can i get this
93:02 - into 256 characters
93:07 - all right um so first we know we can get
93:10 - rid let's let's look at what we're what
93:12 - we're starting with here
93:14 - what are we starting with and i'm just
93:16 - well into my own twitter account now
93:18 - here
93:19 - we're starting with uh
93:22 - oh that's bad oh boy
93:26 - uh how's this gonna go oh no no uh
93:30 - so let's see let's get over here so
93:32 - first thing we can save a lot
93:38 - also i think
93:41 - just okay oops
93:48 - uh hold on i'm going to i'm just
93:56 - so let's
94:00 - let's take off some stuff here that
94:04 - is
94:08 - make i'm trying to just make it run oh
94:11 - look there's some commented stuff that's
94:13 - gonna help
94:19 - um just sort of shortening the code in
94:21 - the first place
94:24 - [Music]
94:30 - um
94:35 - oh i wasn't auto refreshing what is
94:38 - wrong with me
94:41 - okay that's what i this is what i wanted
94:42 - let me get it to like
94:44 - all right this is good okay
94:48 - so let's look here
94:53 - what are some things oh i'm using like
94:55 - vectors and stuff so that's
94:57 - oh my god this is going to be an
94:59 - interesting challenge
95:02 - oh my goodness oh what have i done oh i
95:05 - created a hard one
95:06 - let's see what let's see where we are
95:08 - now
95:13 - 975 characters to go okay
95:18 - so order as six i can get rid of this
95:21 - variable
95:25 - uh line 43
95:29 - yeah okay that's good i just have to
95:32 - remember that
95:33 - um all right so that's good um
95:41 - now uh n
95:45 - don't need this here we're good
95:49 - total
95:52 - can i get rid of this
95:57 - yup path
96:02 - counter being zero
96:07 - okay uh i don't need this background
96:11 - here
96:16 - isn't there some way to like make the
96:19 - counter go up here
96:24 - okay so we're getting somewhere
96:36 - um i mean this is silly for me to start
96:38 - just getting rid of the
96:40 - all right length is width divided by n
96:44 - so if n is going to be
96:51 - two to the sixth power
96:56 - um which is
97:00 - with divided by so like if i said 512
97:03 - divided by
97:08 - two to the sixth power that's just eight
97:13 - so get rid of this
97:21 - and i think
97:35 - the question is should i try i should
97:38 - probably make this
97:46 - i guess i'm going to leave what it is
97:47 - right now
97:50 - um and we know we can do
97:55 - i don't understand this
98:00 - i don't understand how that works
98:12 - okay what did i do i
98:16 - need this here
98:20 - right
98:24 - i think all the vector stuff i'm gonna
98:26 - have to
98:33 - rethink
98:36 - but
98:40 - where else okay oh this
98:43 - can absolutely be um
98:54 - do i even need these
98:57 - no i guess i do
99:05 - what if i do hsb
99:11 - yeah okay
99:15 - so now i'm now we're cooking here
99:39 - all right um now
99:44 - uh so how am i doing
99:48 - how are we doing character wise oh my
99:54 - god i still have 650 characters to go
99:56 - i'm oops still pretty good
100:00 - pretty pretty pretty good all right um
100:13 - so i know just leave some i need to
100:14 - leave line breaks until the end
100:17 - because i've got to be able to
100:21 - look at this
100:28 - this should work chaining should work
100:34 - right
100:36 - and then i also don't need these
100:40 - ah what did i do line six
100:45 - oh i need another parentheses oh no no
100:48 - there here there we go
100:52 - okay that's good um
101:04 - okay that's this is looking good now the
101:06 - setup
101:09 - um now let's see here
101:16 - clear
101:22 - um
101:29 - okay now
101:32 - this
101:37 - this hilbert function is really where
101:40 - i need to
101:44 - do some other stuff
101:47 - [Music]
101:57 - all right so why
102:01 - do i say new p5 vector and not create
102:04 - vector
102:10 - [Music]
102:12 - and
102:14 - this will save me some characters
102:23 - okay so this also
102:26 - can i make this function just called h
102:32 - okay am i already using
102:36 - p for path
102:40 - it's okay though um so points
102:44 - i'll call it t now i'm assuming there's
102:48 - a way i'm going to be able to not
102:49 - call oh well what if i did
103:01 - what if i did that and then
103:14 - oh no i have v here um
103:19 - so let's call this oh there's only so
103:22 - many letters in the alphabet
103:24 - a create vector uh
103:28 - uh create let's call it i don't know
103:32 - a a for create
103:36 - create i ate the vector
103:41 - or i could call this i'll call that a
103:43 - let's let's keep that as v
103:45 - and let's just change this to a
103:53 - k equals i ampersand three
104:00 - and then also
104:04 - um
104:09 - wow this is actually quite enjoyable
104:14 - oh am i still going here ah
104:17 - i better i better get this working here
104:24 - oh we're gonna need uh boy this is this
104:27 - is gonna need some serious work
104:30 - there's gotta be some ways
104:38 - uh and this is k k
104:42 - k i believe return
104:45 - a just want to make sure this works
104:49 - v is not defined 17
104:53 - v equals create vector
105:00 - hmm
105:07 - just just to double check this
105:15 - why is this
105:18 - not save and create vector
105:22 - hmm why am i not
105:26 - save and create vector let's see
105:29 - just put create vector back here for a
105:31 - second
105:33 - just one i don't want to break it so
105:35 - much that i can't get it back
105:36 - index is not a fine line 23 okay
105:41 - okay i'm back
105:46 - so why is vv equal create vector
105:53 - oh because it's aha
106:00 - where do i call the hilbert function
106:04 - make this first line of code
106:10 - okay because hilbert is being called
106:13 - oh hilbert's being the hilbert function
106:15 - is being called right there no wonder
106:17 - okay
106:18 - i have to have that beforehand
106:27 - okay
106:30 - let's let's have a little check in here
106:35 - oh vv pv okay
106:39 - okay still got it let's
106:42 - uh whoa
106:46 - oh we're doing we're doing well just got
106:48 - to get rid of 444 more characters
106:52 - no problem no problem
106:56 - okay
107:01 - uh
107:04 - can i do that okay
107:08 - um
107:21 - a lot of this happening
107:29 - so now length is power 2 to the j
107:33 - there is a way to write
107:36 - the power function right i also have
107:39 - this here
107:39 - this i've got to be able to do or
107:42 - isn't there a bit shifting way to write
107:44 - this
107:46 - um n equals 2 to the sixth power
107:50 - um change
107:55 - um right somebody will tell me that
107:59 - that i can never pull i can't um but
108:02 - certainly here
108:04 - this can be l equals power 2 to the j
108:07 - for right now um
108:15 - and this can be
108:23 - um i don't know if this is is that fewer
108:26 - characters
108:27 - i think it might be
108:35 - did i already use t can i use t
109:01 - oh is the switch statement going to do
109:03 - this for me
109:04 - do i need a switch statement all right
109:08 - so power 2 to the j is the same as 2
109:12 - exclamation uh two asterisk asterisk j
109:15 - thank you for that um so this
109:18 - i should be able to say two asterisk
109:21 - asterisk
109:21 - six oh is it also isn't that just
109:25 - the number 64. 2 to the ones
109:28 - two four
109:31 - eight sixteen thirty-two sixty-four
109:35 - sixty-four
109:39 - uh length is not defined
109:47 - line 25
109:51 - okay i'm back um
110:01 - oh i can't stop myself here must succeed
110:04 - at this
110:08 - just want to see like what where am i
110:09 - really
110:11 - with all of this
110:27 - okay this no temp is not fine 31t
110:38 - just i need a reality check here
110:43 - okay please remove the else is
110:49 - oh that's a good point right this
110:56 - isn't great coding but will certainly
110:59 - work
111:03 - line 36
111:09 - hmm what did i mess up here
111:15 - for ifko
111:22 - no
111:25 - k is 2 k is 1 k is 0
111:32 - 4
111:36 - oh okay hold on this
111:39 - is opening
111:43 - a for loop if statement
111:46 - if statement ah
111:56 - that should
112:03 - okay what am i working with now
112:08 - wait oh i got only 200 characters more
112:13 - to go
112:14 - ah this is great okay
112:20 - would k equals three work as if k is
112:22 - greater than two that's an interesting
112:25 - um
112:29 - okay right so i don't need
112:36 - these curlies that's i don't need
112:40 - these curlies
112:46 - um
112:50 - this can also be two
112:53 - j right
112:56 - okay
112:59 - now question is
113:06 - i mean one thing i could do is get rid
113:07 - of the rainbow color
113:11 - like i don't need to have color mode
113:14 - and then i could also get rid of the
113:15 - stroke
113:17 - like that's gonna save me a lot of
113:19 - characters
113:21 - um could i
113:25 - would no i guess having
113:30 - i need to write a swap would a swap
113:32 - function
113:35 - really save me that much
113:40 - oops uh-oh oh no it's working
113:44 - would a swap function
113:48 - if not k
113:57 - okay that's good
114:06 - so the swap function could i
114:10 - write a function
114:20 - hmm
114:26 - okay k is greater than two i like that
114:34 - okay save myself i need a lot more just
114:37 - get
114:38 - down to fewer characters uh i mean
114:41 - i guess maybe i should get rid of color
114:43 - mode i didn't want to
114:45 - but i think i might have to get rid of
114:46 - the color mode right
114:56 - hmm right because if i get rid of that
115:01 - i can always bring it back right let's
115:04 - get rid of color mode
115:06 - sad
115:14 - oh uh
115:34 - okay we're back to just sort of this
115:37 - plane
115:38 - uh i don't know how to get to
115:43 - david's comment to
115:46 - remove it
115:51 - okay hold on this will give me a second
115:58 - here
116:03 - uh
116:08 - okay where is david's pin comment there
116:10 - it is okay
116:12 - all right so that's working um
116:16 - how we doing people
116:25 - oh this is good
116:28 - now just out of curiosity does it
116:31 - oh i save characters when it's on one
116:34 - line
116:35 - wow so that's going to make a huge
116:38 - difference when i eventually get to that
116:41 - point
116:46 - so i didn't realize that
116:49 - [Music]
116:53 - instead of curiosity here how what am i
116:55 - really working with here
117:06 - getting close people
117:11 - you know what i don't oh i just realized
117:15 - something
117:16 - i just realized there's a fundamental
117:18 - thing that i could change
117:22 - i don't need to write a loop
117:25 - i don't need to save the values in an
117:27 - array
117:29 - i can oh boy i did that
117:33 - because i was technically doing it where
117:36 - i wanted to be able to draw the
117:38 - entire thing but i can just
117:42 - bear with me for a second
117:45 - right if i get rid of this
117:48 - i don't need that clear it's drawing
117:51 - over itself
117:52 - but i i don't believe that i need
117:58 - this array i just need the current point
118:01 - and the previous point
118:04 - to draw a line hold on uh all right so
118:07 - let me save this
118:09 - because i'm going to do something
118:10 - radical here duplicate
118:13 - i'm going to do something radical here
118:17 - i don't need this array
118:20 - i don't need this loop
118:24 - i do need a variable i
118:30 - and i don't need c
118:34 - i is c
118:47 - what i'm saying is
118:51 - i is h i
118:54 - b is
118:58 - i already used did i use a here i'm so
119:01 - confused
119:03 - um okay so look look just give me a
119:06 - second here v1
119:08 - is hi v2 is h
119:11 - i plus one
119:28 - right
119:31 - p is not defined line four
119:36 - um i guess i need to add
119:40 - these in but this is this is that's this
119:43 - is all shortenable
119:59 - then
120:08 - okay oh this is going to make a huge
120:10 - difference
120:12 - so i need
120:15 - a and b
120:19 - well actually i just need b
120:25 - so if the problem is what am i using a
120:28 - for here
120:36 - equals t index k what
120:42 - oh yeah yeah that's fine um
120:49 - so i need two points
120:53 - i need a let's call it a b c
120:56 - d i'm going to use e and f
121:00 - e and f or e f g h
121:03 - i i and j j and k i'm already using
121:06 - those somewhere else
121:07 - m n m n that's perfect m
121:10 - equals this
121:27 - then n equals m
121:30 - so n is not defined yet let me just
121:36 - define it as something very briefly
121:38 - okay all right so that works
121:44 - how do i get it so that it's
122:03 - do i really have to define it as
122:04 - something that's kind of irritating
122:18 - no
122:23 - all right let's see what i'm working
122:24 - with here
122:31 - oh okay i'm i'm doing quite well here
122:34 - i equals n equals zero thank you
122:44 - i hate that i'm getting this like
122:46 - warning thing but i'll live with that
122:49 - okay so now
123:00 - else can i do
123:08 - use draw as your loop exactly okay
123:11 - so now let's see if i put this in here
123:17 - can i just by getting rid of all the
123:19 - line breaks
123:21 - get myself there
123:49 - there's still a lot i don't have 50.
124:00 - can't tell where the line breaks are now
124:03 - but again i still have a lot more to do
124:20 - i'm just trying to think if this can be
124:22 - reduced
124:25 - most
124:32 - like do i maybe i don't need
124:36 - maybe i don't need create vector
124:41 - the dot x though is so much like
124:49 - right a equals t
124:56 - there's got to be a way to do this
124:58 - without create vector
125:04 - um
125:07 - ah okay i like that um this is a good
125:11 - suggestion from mika i can put
125:14 - v equals create vector into
125:18 - draw
125:22 - that way
125:26 - i can get rid of these
125:35 - i guess if i want to keep the line
125:36 - breaks i could lose the semicolons
125:42 - so that helps a little bit
125:52 - there's some kind of object
125:53 - restructuring i could do
126:00 - like
126:10 - [Music]
126:14 - no
126:19 - i'm looking for more suggestions
126:24 - because it's a square put 512 in a
126:27 - variable
126:32 - is that really going to save me
126:33 - characters though
126:53 - oh i see
127:00 - that's a way to do it
127:05 - hmm
127:09 - okay line ten
127:15 - and you could swap by saying a b equals
127:18 - b a
127:19 - can i really do that
127:38 - hmm
127:41 - um yeah so i could
127:45 - so one way for me to just know how many
127:48 - characters i actually have
127:51 - is get rid of these semicolons
128:00 - am i still good here yeah
128:06 - um
128:18 - this will just help me
128:24 - sort of see what's going on
128:31 - 50 hey didn't i have it better than 51.
128:41 - combine lines 22 and 24 i see
128:55 - oh that was a really good one uh that
128:58 - was from
129:02 - um
129:05 - that was from andrew garvin
129:16 - interesting
129:21 - how many characters did that save me
129:24 - okay down to 46. oh this is really hard
129:51 - okay i just want to like
130:11 - what am i down to now
130:15 - 37 people
130:26 - oh
130:29 - v a equals v a y dot a x
130:33 - that is super interesting
130:36 - so this is this is a really interesting
130:38 - one that david has just suggested
130:42 - for the swap
130:45 - so here
130:51 - t equals ax a x equals a y yeah
130:57 - a equals v
131:01 - a dot y a dot x
131:06 - yeah wow that was huge
131:10 - that was huge we're down to 28.
131:14 - can i do that with this last one i
131:18 - should be able to
131:19 - a equals
131:25 - this comma
131:28 - this and then i don't need
131:38 - oh boy i messed something up
131:45 - all right how do i do this last one
131:49 - a equals v
131:52 - this is a dot x
131:57 - and this is a dot y
132:10 - just for a second here separate this out
132:13 - okay
132:17 - all right that's good then get rid of
132:19 - these
132:21 - get rid of this
132:26 - oh now we're cooking with gas
132:29 - here okay
132:35 - i think could this possibly have done it
132:41 - oh my god so close to fitting into a
132:43 - tweet now we're way beyond
132:45 - my goal is no longer to get this into
132:46 - 256
132:49 - i'm just trying to get this into a tweet
132:52 - so that'll might be my goal move line 15
132:55 - k
132:55 - equals 2 to 20 and rename to else i'm
132:58 - not sure
132:59 - if i'm behind okay
133:04 - all right so let's look at this
133:17 - all right what else could i do
133:32 - um okay so this is save this could save
133:34 - me a character
133:38 - um this
133:42 - anywhere there's a bracket it's no
133:49 - yeah that has to be a new line okay um
134:05 - this looks so short by the way
134:12 - um i've lost david's message to unpin it
134:19 - um all right let's see
134:24 - rename if k is greater than 2 to
134:27 - else ah
134:33 - does that really save me some characters
134:35 - no
134:37 - no no no i can't use else because
134:41 - i can't use because i got rid of all the
134:43 - other i can't do that that was a great
134:44 - idea though
134:46 - uh if k equals one
134:49 - yeah um
134:52 - i do like what i'm getting line four h i
134:55 - plus plus remove line six
135:05 - huh i never understand how that works
135:08 - but i'll take it
135:10 - that's awesome line 15
135:14 - remove negative one
135:17 - and plus one those aren't oh negative
135:20 - one
135:23 - i
135:28 - replace i equals
135:31 - this so this is one that mika is saying
135:35 - with just
135:36 - shifting it ah yeah
135:42 - okay wow thank you mika that was a good
135:45 - one
135:47 - yeah slightly annoyed you can't pass two
135:49 - vectors to line
135:55 - uh okay
135:58 - how we doing how we doing this those are
136:00 - some good improvements
136:03 - 14 characters just 14 characters more
136:08 - this to me feels like there's got to be
136:11 - something i can do with this
136:16 - i divide equal four
136:21 - is that what the bit shifting is line
136:24 - four scale eight
136:26 - oh interesting
136:36 - would that really help but it's
136:39 - afternoon now okay
136:40 - hold on scale
136:43 - scale i don't think that that's really
136:46 - saving me
136:47 - any characters though with line
136:50 - eight hmm
137:00 - create canvas into draw and delete setup
137:04 - no that's not gonna work because i can't
137:06 - call createcanvas over and over
137:12 - oh you mean the whole thing just scale
137:14 - eight
137:16 - would that actually work
137:26 - so that does work but my line thickness
137:28 - is way out of whack now
137:33 - so i'd have to do like a stroke weight
137:38 - right i'd have to add stroke weight
137:42 - of like point two or something
137:45 - like that works but now i've added a
137:47 - bazillion characters
137:50 - so it's a good idea
137:57 - so youfu unfortunately so some of the
138:00 - the way i'm looking at the chat right
138:01 - now
138:02 - with the this stream chat is i'm like
138:05 - way when you post a link to a discord
138:07 - message previous message i don't
138:09 - know what that is plus plus j
138:14 - plus plus j
138:25 - where would that go with line
138:29 - eight
138:34 - i don't know what any of those
138:35 - suggestions are maybe line eight j
138:37 - plus pl oh like this
138:55 - that didn't work j
138:58 - equals one plus plus j is that that
139:00 - didn't work hold on did i mess something
139:02 - else up
139:02 - no yeah i like this idea
139:06 - but
139:10 - oh i froze froze ah come on come back
139:14 - oh no oh no come back plus
139:17 - j plus
139:21 - at least screenshot this
139:30 - we're gonna get this people uh
139:34 - line 14 i have
139:38 - plus l and
139:41 - negative l l minus one
139:46 - oh yeah look at this
139:50 - those cancel each other out right
139:53 - no
139:56 - l no no no two out can i do two times l
140:03 - that doesn't really save me any
140:05 - characters
140:08 - also what did i just do
140:16 - oh oh
140:19 - line 12 if k equals 1 8
140:23 - why is it like sometimes it's like
140:25 - freaking out and but that didn't save me
140:27 - any characters
140:36 - uh v i know that's what i was thinking
140:39 - instead of create vector
140:43 - but
140:48 - you're double incrementing no plus plus
140:51 - j
140:51 - at the end no i took that out
140:56 - i saved the sketch by the way
141:00 - line ten
141:03 - l equals two star star admit it in line
141:10 - eight
141:18 - i don't understand that
141:24 - v00 can be replaced with that's a good
141:27 - one
141:29 - oh that's a good one all right thank you
141:32 - uh to i've done that uh
141:35 - marion who said v zero zero
141:40 - j equals zero plus plus j
141:45 - i just don't understand
141:49 - if you remove create canvas q equals
141:53 - 5 12 and then okay
142:01 - oh i mean just use the default cam no i
142:03 - kind of want it to be bigger i mean
142:05 - that's an interesting idea
142:08 - like to just not even use create canvas
142:13 - right if i don't use create canvas
142:17 - right it makes a 100 by 100 canvas so i
142:19 - could scale the thing down
142:22 - very like but that's let's let's hold
142:24 - off on that
142:27 - let's hold off on that
142:30 - people are saying
142:40 - huh that really worked
142:44 - okay where am i now
142:49 - we have nine characters left to go okay
142:59 - replace twelve and thirteen oh i could
143:01 - use it
143:02 - a ternary on 12 and 13 okay
143:06 - let's try this says 60
143:13 - replace 12 and 13
143:17 - with
143:21 - k equals 1 then if that's true
143:25 - a dot y plus equal l
143:31 - oh you mean i could just use the only
143:33 - the question mark
143:38 - like this will work
143:43 - well if that's true that's huge
143:48 - i might be able to get my color back in
143:51 - here
143:58 - no
144:05 - hmm
144:12 - oh oh i see i can do
144:15 - this like that
144:36 - oh that's so weird
144:51 - i have no idea what this is like sorcery
144:54 - here
144:59 - no
145:08 - okay i don't understand what i just did
145:11 - if k
145:11 - is 1 do this otherwise if k is 2
145:15 - do this otherwise just like i put a 0 in
145:18 - there for doing nothing
145:25 - um thank you 60 for that
145:32 - but could i even keep going with this
145:36 - and do this now
145:40 - but this might have gotten me enough
145:42 - characters
145:45 - still need five more okay
145:48 - i still need five more
145:53 - i still need five more ternary operators
145:56 - ternary operators that's so could i do
145:59 - one more ternary by putting
146:03 - this here now
146:07 - and then
146:22 - okay down to 2002 oh my god this is
146:25 - insane
146:27 - line 10 remove j plus plus line 10
146:30 - add plus plus
146:33 - when i don't need the greater than two
146:35 - now
146:38 - because it's just the only other
146:39 - possibility
146:44 - oh whoops just did something awful
146:49 - no ah
146:54 - okay right so like if this
146:57 - is true do this otherwise
147:00 - if this is true
147:03 - do this otherwise can't i don't need to
147:07 - even check this
147:08 - shouldn't i just be able to say really
147:16 - feel like you should be able to do that
147:17 - no
147:20 - oh because of this all right i need to
147:23 - bet i need to keep going with the
147:25 - ternaries
147:27 - so not k
147:32 - do this otherwise this
147:36 - and then
147:42 - oh my god
147:46 - and then i don't even think i need this
147:48 - last one right
147:52 - no it wants one more or do i can i get
147:56 - rid of that no
148:05 - oh hey i fit it into a tweet
148:09 - oh my god put a as a global variable
148:12 - don't return
148:12 - a oh that's interesting
148:16 - put a as a global variable
148:27 - then i don't even need return a is that
148:39 - oh true of undefined
148:44 - oh no oh but then i would have to say
148:59 - did this actually save me characters
149:03 - it's working does this save me
149:06 - characters
149:14 - yeah i can i can put a hashtag in there
149:17 - now
149:19 - okay amazing but i still feel like i've
149:22 - got extra stuff here that i don't need
149:24 - i'm so lost not k do this
149:29 - or not
149:33 - one do this otherwise to
149:37 - do this otherwise
149:40 - i guess i do need it because i need to
149:43 - oh unless i get rid of this
149:51 - so come on i need more space people
149:54 - need more space think now ah
150:00 - come on give me some space there thank
150:03 - you
150:08 - another curly bracket
150:12 - okay now i've got the turnery thing
150:16 - all set oh my god
150:19 - save save
150:24 - i've got 11 characters left i might be
150:26 - able to get my colors back
150:30 - line 10 is unnecessary k
150:33 - is already set
150:40 - i don't think that's true
150:49 - i don't think that's true
150:52 - yeah no no that's definitely necessary
150:57 - remove yeah okay line seven remove the
151:00 - line break
151:01 - got it there's another one
151:05 - no whoa whoa no i have to have it
151:08 - because it's a function definition
151:10 - i don't know why i can do this that'll
151:14 - work
151:17 - i am going to put semicolons in and
151:18 - remove all the line breaks
151:20 - when i'm done get rid of setup by doing
151:23 - if not i
151:24 - create canvas yeah no
151:27 - unfortunately p5 needs to have the setup
151:29 - function
151:31 - you don't need j plus plus in
151:35 - line 9 if you do plus plus in a line 11.
151:44 - like this wait hold on let me save
151:48 - let me save save plus plus
151:54 - nope
152:00 - there we go yeah that's
152:03 - fascinating that saved me a character
152:07 - right
152:08 - yep
152:15 - so can i get this to 256 that's the
152:17 - question
152:18 - [Laughter]
152:20 - line eight a equals i modulus
152:24 - 3 and remove line 10.
152:31 - a equals t
152:34 - i modulus
152:42 - so unfortunately the youtube chat is too
152:44 - fast for me to follow
152:47 - imodulus3 is that all that that is doing
152:51 - with the bit shifting there
152:52 - the ampersand no i like that okay
152:57 - that's pretty cool looking though
153:04 - nope
153:09 - oh wait oh why do i have this here oh
153:13 - because i do it
153:18 - once
153:28 - that's weird wait wait wait this has got
153:30 - to be
153:34 - why do i can't i just make this zero
153:38 - and then get rid of this
153:43 - no that seems like something i could do
153:54 - right why do i have this extra
153:59 - it's gonna be the same oh i see
154:03 - and then i looped through
154:10 - there was no setup in the train tree
154:12 - example
154:13 - really i can do this without setup
154:23 - line eight uh
154:27 - t equals hold on let me try to
154:35 - hmm
154:39 - there's an implied empty setup if you
154:41 - don't have it
154:44 - oh says chris okay
154:55 - i don't understand oh you mean just do
154:58 - it in
154:59 - draw
155:03 - do it in draw i see
155:16 - oh i get it i didn't understand that
155:26 - that is wild 15
155:29 - wait what do i need to get to 256 uh 280
155:33 - minus 256 i need to have 24 characters
155:37 - well now i'm really determined to get to
155:39 - 256.
155:42 - is t only used for a equals t index
155:45 - k it totally is
156:11 - yeah i didn't need that that's a huge
156:14 - extra thing
156:36 - hmm
156:40 - initialize j in the first line
156:45 - no because it's got to be reinitialized
156:47 - every time
156:52 - oh i see what you mean no yeah it's got
156:54 - to be reinitialized every time
157:02 - q512q
157:06 - line two
157:12 - can i do this silly thing again
157:30 - this
157:36 - okay so close
157:47 - i or
157:57 - i or create canvas
158:02 - yeah that's even better
158:08 - there are so many okay i've got it
158:12 - line okay let's
158:15 - let's see kobe says line eight can be
158:21 - h equals i
158:26 - ah yes okay so this is a really good one
158:29 - i understand this now
158:31 - this i can just look at
158:34 - i don't need a separate variable
158:38 - a equals the index into this array
158:41 - that is at i and
158:45 - three did i get that right yeah
158:48 - okay okay that's good
158:51 - oh my god
158:55 - uh um
158:58 - can i go with v i don't think so let's
159:02 - find out
159:11 - yeah it's not that's a syntax error
159:14 - oh what did i do
159:18 - oh what did i do
159:24 - oh it's 1-1 yeah sorry
159:28 - okay all right um thank you kobe for
159:32 - that one
159:33 - uh let's see did i get it to 256
159:36 - characters
159:38 - oh now i don't know anymore okay it's
159:41 - not even showing me it's i have so much
159:43 - room left that's not even telling me how
159:45 - many characters i have left
159:47 - one two three four five six twenty oh
159:50 - yeah i think i did it
159:52 - i think this is 256. okay hold on
160:00 - how do i count characters
160:07 - that's 254 characters
160:13 - okay all right let's add i want to i i
160:15 - prefer for it to be on one line
160:18 - so let me hit save the other thing is
160:21 - why not go for a higher
160:25 - n like
160:29 - why not make this a bit more detailed
160:33 - like for example if i've already like
160:37 - lost track of where i started with this
160:42 - by the way in case you're just tuning in
160:44 - right now
160:48 - um
160:51 - and it's still working um i wanna like
160:54 - this was the
160:56 - original code um
161:02 - and i started with an
161:05 - order of six so if i made order eight
161:08 - like i'm just curious if i
161:10 - change the order back to eight where
161:12 - does what is that effect
161:15 - it makes instead of this being 64.
161:22 - i don't even know where those numbers
161:24 - went to
161:30 - like lost my mind here
161:34 - is it really just a matter of how many
161:37 - oh
161:38 - i'm not even doing that anymore because
161:39 - oh it's gonna crash at the end
161:42 - it's gonna crash at the end or will it
161:45 - just go back over itself
161:47 - right because the length is all that
161:50 - matters now right
161:51 - if the length is
162:02 - like if i do this
162:06 - it's gonna go forever right
162:09 - let's let this run for a little bit
162:19 - i mean i could do this just for fun
162:27 - i saved so much space i could make it
162:28 - rainbow color again
162:30 - k equals i
162:39 - eight
162:45 - does that work if i somehow do this
162:53 - no
162:59 - i can write v oh this one
163:06 - nope
163:08 - uh inside the indexing yeah i don't know
163:11 - how to do that
163:13 - do colors hold on the nicos
163:17 - musics
163:20 - this is like crazy to me i don't
163:22 - understand this one
163:26 - if people who are in discord can pull in
163:28 - some of the
163:36 - um interesting suggestions
163:40 - move line 11 into the for loop increment
163:47 - is that the only thing i'm using j for
163:55 - i don't i don't that hurts my brain
164:08 - oh there's this one
164:12 - yeah there we go thank you
164:16 - v1 it'll replace the second argument
164:18 - automatically
164:19 - there we go that's a good one line 12 k
164:22 - equals 1 to k is less than 2.
164:30 - that's another one okay
164:33 - define k equals i mu and use it in line
164:37 - eight
164:40 - no because
164:45 - i still would need to have it here
164:46 - because i is changing
164:49 - but there's probably a way i could say k
164:52 - equals
164:53 - i divide equal four
164:58 - boy this is there's okay here's the
165:01 - suggestion from nico
165:02 - this one i wanted to look at
165:08 - a equals v
165:11 - of i modulus 3
165:15 - oh my god i don't understand this at all
165:20 - i'm fascinated by this though
165:26 - so let's just think about this here
165:37 - a equals v of
165:42 - could i actually figure out what should
165:44 - go here
165:45 - based off of this by
165:49 - saying well let me just type this out i
165:51 - don't understand it
165:53 - but let me type it out and maybe that'll
165:56 - help me understand it
165:58 - v of i modulus
166:02 - 3 because it's 0
166:05 - 0 1 1. that makes sense
166:09 - zero zero one one
166:15 - bit shift one okay so it's zero zero one
166:19 - zero zero one one will this get me zero
166:21 - zero one one whatever i
166:23 - is and then the next one
166:26 - is
166:30 - 0 1 0 1 1
166:33 - 0 index i
166:37 - modulus three
166:44 - i didn't get that right
166:52 - does this do i mean for this to be this
166:55 - yeah that's
166:56 - not modulus the ampersand
167:02 - oh i really got off the rails here now
167:12 - uh-oh why is this so nice happen to me
167:27 - i don't know why that happened sometimes
167:29 - the web editor just freezes up
167:31 - okay i think i have to stop soon
167:45 - this is pretty good
167:50 - oh camera died the camera's not plugged
167:53 - in
167:54 - oh the camera died oh my god bye camera
167:59 - how did that happen this whole time the
168:02 - camera's been going on batteries
168:06 - don't worry everyone i have a solution
168:07 - to this problem
168:09 - it's called a plug
168:16 - uh although this might be a sign that i
168:18 - just have to stop
168:25 - all right nope this is an ethernet cable
168:28 - it's not gonna be any good
168:32 - what i'm looking for is my
168:36 - where did that plug go
168:44 - i didn't notice this was happening i had
168:50 - a cable here
168:58 - oh this is the saddest thing that ever
168:59 - happened
169:01 - i just literally had a usbc cable which
169:04 - is what i'm looking for
169:06 - actually what i need is a
169:10 - um you need that cable
169:14 - if i unplug my microphone like oh
169:17 - there's there's the cable i'm looking
169:18 - for
169:23 - you can't see what i'm doing but i'm
169:26 - plugging in this camera
169:28 - to power
169:31 - usbc goes right
169:35 - here why does this keep getting
169:39 - plug i blame my children
169:43 - you can fit in there usbc cable
169:48 - your usbc port your usbc cable there we
169:52 - go now i just need
169:55 - a other end to plug it into something
169:59 - right i'm going to unplug my
170:03 - laptop for a second and plug it into
170:05 - that
170:07 - hopefully this doesn't fry the camera
170:13 - let's see charge charge charge
170:17 - up my friend camera camera
170:22 - should be back
170:27 - okay should be back all right i think i
170:30 - have to be done
170:32 - make q64 i know but
170:36 - i think i actually want to go back to
170:38 - 512 because technically speaking
170:44 - um
170:48 - it's going to um
170:51 - let's record it
170:56 - it's going to take a very long time
171:00 - but 512 by 5
171:03 - 12. but i think it'll be fun to have oh
171:06 - oh it's not going it's going to take
171:07 - longer this thing only records for 30
171:09 - seconds
171:11 - all right so i'm going to need to do a
171:13 - quick time screen capture let's quit
171:15 - this
171:16 - um finishing up folks
171:23 - hello i'm gonna be done will you just
171:26 - play like a drum
171:27 - thing for me i don't know
171:31 - give me a beat will you give me a beat
171:34 - well
171:35 - it's about to get very loud in here i'll
171:37 - turn down the gain on the mic
171:38 - okay ready give me a beat
171:46 - [Music]
171:48 - oh it's going over it again
171:52 - that was good
171:57 - um all right i have to finish up oh my
171:59 - god it's almost like one o'clock
172:00 - oh my god wait why is it going over it
172:03 - again
172:07 - because of this
172:11 - [Music]
172:12 - um
172:18 - line eight oh remove the multiply
172:22 - right if these
172:34 - oh my god i'm losing my mind
172:37 - [Music]
172:41 - k equals two to k okay hold on
172:47 - in line five just add two
172:52 - why did this not go on to the next
173:02 - i guess i'm missing something critical
173:08 - here
173:11 - that's fine let's just make it a 256 by
173:13 - 256 thing
173:15 - i have to stop
173:24 - i don't even know where i am when all of
173:26 - my chats
173:33 - replace all ternary operators with
173:35 - immediate array
173:37 - god this is crazy
173:43 - uh turn a equals
173:47 - oh i can't i have to stop
173:50 - i hadn't restarted the sketch oh
173:55 - is that why i don't think so
174:01 - all right
174:11 - my my brain is completely
174:14 - has completely died
174:28 - five i have to stop i'm being
174:32 - i can't believe i went this one this was
174:34 - like so fun but it's kind of like off
174:36 - the rails now
174:42 - okay
174:47 - let's just see what happens camera died
174:49 - again
174:50 - [Laughter]
174:53 - um all right let me let it let me let it
174:55 - charge up a little bit more
175:03 - so i'm
175:06 - i'm gonna be just not on camera for a
175:08 - little bit
175:12 - yeah what did i do wrong
175:15 - for it not to do the full 512 by 512.
175:23 - is it this six here
175:27 - needs to be
175:36 - like for example oh how can i
175:40 - how do i tell to record chord okay
175:45 - um so if i go back to the original code
175:52 - order is eight n
175:56 - is two to the eighth power
175:59 - which is 256.
176:03 - that's how far it's at length
176:07 - is width divided by 256 but that
176:10 - shouldn't matter
176:19 - like if i go back
176:23 - to the original code
176:32 - like i wanted to do this
176:36 - over the whole thing
176:43 - and what did i do differently
177:01 - add colors
177:13 - i think i have to come back i'll have to
177:14 - come back to this another time
177:17 - but i'm trying to i'm trying to
177:20 - understand
177:22 - to the j j is less than order
177:26 - ah there we go i see what i've confused
177:34 - so
177:42 - yeah i just need to increase that
177:52 - that's all
178:02 - i know you can't see me i'm i'm enjoying
178:04 - the fact that you can't see me right now
178:07 - i'm letting the camera charge up a
178:09 - little bit
178:10 - because it clearly can't be charging and
178:16 - so there are probably still ways that i
178:19 - could reduce the
178:20 - number of characters um getting some
178:23 - good suggestions in the chat
178:26 - um and
178:36 - but i just want to see if this moves
178:39 - on to the next section
178:44 - which is very unnecessary but i must
178:48 - know there we go
178:51 - okay yeah
178:54 - okay so i have it calibrated correctly
178:56 - now am i actually recording the screen
178:58 - here
179:00 - hit stop oh i was okay
179:04 - so let me delete this
179:10 - and then i could i'm going to speed this
179:12 - up
179:14 - new screen recording
179:17 - there we go stop
179:22 - record stop and here we go
179:28 - all right i'm gonna let this go uh and
179:30 - then i'm gonna be done
179:34 - uh who who wants to help me uh quickly
179:38 - uh speed up this video so i guess i
179:40 - could i could make it long is it
179:42 - recording my audio am i talking
179:43 - throughout this whole thing oh that's
179:44 - going to irritate me so much
179:48 - now we're trying to get the color back
179:50 - [Music]
179:54 - um
179:56 - well let me at least finish recording
179:58 - this
180:01 - i'm sorry that i didn't do any community
180:03 - contributions today i i got obsessed
180:05 - with this
180:13 - i should have just let it do the um i
180:16 - guess i could record this later maybe
180:17 - i'll post this tweet after the stream
180:20 - um so i don't have to sit here and wait
180:22 - for it to do the whole thing it's going
180:23 - to take a very long time
180:26 - use ffmpeg that's a good point
180:33 - um yeah so this is by the way this goes
180:36 - against everything i stand for in terms
180:39 - of programming
180:40 - you know the i this was like a fun
180:41 - challenge to explore
180:43 - but you know my whole ethos is to write
180:45 - the code in as long
180:47 - winded away as possible
180:51 - um so i can't really increase the frame
180:55 - rate in the way that i'm doing it here
180:57 - but
180:58 - i see that i can use people are giving
180:59 - me great suggestions
181:01 - like marcos here's i use ffmpeg a lot
181:04 - i guess i should let this finish now
181:05 - that i have it started
181:07 - um the problem is i'm screen recording
181:11 - so i can't check anything
181:13 - can somebody check how many characters i
181:15 - have currently
181:17 - um and
181:20 - if someone wants to check how many
181:22 - characters i have currently i could
181:23 - consider if i could get
181:25 - just stroke back i would need color mode
181:29 - hsb stroke
181:34 - [Music]
181:38 - i should really do this after the stream
181:43 - but i like i'm a completionist
181:49 - you know we've got uh
181:51 - [Music]
181:53 - oh i don't have the um hold on
181:56 - i don't have the overlay here just
181:59 - stream shot overlay in the view i'm
182:00 - looking at
182:03 - [Music]
182:09 - 248 characters
182:13 - bruno says it's a good example to show
182:16 - why people should not do it this way i
182:18 - agree
182:20 - so i don't think i can get color and
182:22 - stay within 256 characters
182:24 - i could stay within the tweet though
182:27 - so i'll do a second one with color
182:30 - [Music]
182:32 - because i agree
182:36 - um that would be nice
182:39 - [Music]
182:41 - i still think that um
182:45 - [Music]
182:47 - this one this comment from la culotte on
182:50 - youtube
182:50 - so i i realized that some people are
182:52 - saying that people are posting
182:53 - suggestions when other people are copy
182:55 - pasting their suggestions
182:56 - so i'm not sure if this is the correct
182:57 - attribution
182:59 - and there is also getting a suggestion
183:02 - for how to rewrite the for loop to
183:04 - remove the curly brackets and the line
183:06 - breaks
183:06 - [Music]
183:09 - which i'm looking at um
183:12 - but i think i'm going to leave it
183:17 - um i think i'm going to leave it as is
183:20 - right now
183:22 - it's so close to finishing
183:27 - [Music]
183:48 - all right i think i'm about to reappear
183:50 - there i am all
183:52 - aglow let the lights adjust
183:56 - so close here
183:57 - [Music]
184:00 - okay awkwardly go up here and hit stop
184:07 - [Music]
184:09 - great so now i'm going to save this
184:16 - um okay
184:20 - save this all right i'm wrapping up
184:22 - people
184:24 - at export to hilbert one
184:27 - desktop hilbert let's call this black
184:29 - and white desktop okay
184:33 - all right so that's good now
184:37 - let's just briefly see if i can get the
184:41 - color back
184:42 - and stay within 280 characters
184:45 - so how did i have color i know i need to
184:48 - add
184:55 - that's probably enough that's
184:59 - i lost my i'm still within a tweet
185:03 - i have 15 characters to add color
185:06 - and then the original way i had color
185:09 - was having q b i
185:14 - map from the entire length
185:18 - which is
185:20 - [Music]
185:22 - path.length is
185:26 - the total number of points which is
185:29 - 2 to the 8th squared
185:36 - so let's just try for a second um
185:42 - stroke i
185:46 - divided by
185:51 - um so 300
185:54 - i divided by
185:59 - two to the eighth is 256.
186:05 - so that's that am i is that that
186:11 - how do i do something squared like this
186:26 - yeah
186:29 - yeah oh no no
186:34 - this is gonna get me color i think
186:49 - right it's the same thing right
187:00 - i can't tell if the color's actually
187:02 - changing
187:04 - i don't think that it is
187:26 - hmm
187:31 - it's so hard to tell
187:35 - because but i'm
188:04 - thinking
188:06 - i think it is oh and it's working
188:10 - it's just really slow it's change the
188:13 - color is changing
188:19 - it's changing color did i map the hue
188:22 - fully i'm not 100
188:23 - sure and does this fit into a tweet
188:32 - uh
188:35 - i'm over by seven characters
188:42 - i'm over by seven characters
188:50 - do i need these parentheses
189:02 - so i currently can't really i could
189:04 - increase the speed but
189:06 - not with the way that i've written this
189:10 - um
189:13 - spectral piano says they have 273
189:15 - characters
189:16 - what did i miss that you got spectral
189:18 - piano
189:20 - line five
189:35 - yeah i i think i can get rid of these
189:37 - two parentheses
189:41 - so i guess is there a way i can just for
189:44 - testing purposes increase the speed
189:46 - i should be able to say
189:56 - right
190:00 - am i using n somewhere
190:04 - i'm not using you
190:20 - oh whoops
190:30 - okay that's just temporarily increasing
190:32 - the speed
190:34 - um
190:38 - okay oh boy i've unplugged things
190:41 - everything is dying and also
190:42 - is this that's not right did i get the
190:45 - few
190:46 - full hsb
191:02 - yeah that's right that's
191:10 - whoa yeah i don't know i guess i was off
191:14 - by two
191:16 - i don't know why
191:19 - just make sure yeah okay i mean it's
191:22 - it's interesting to have it repeat but
191:24 - okay so that should be 14 here i'm not
191:26 - i'm
191:27 - i'm not going to question that um then
191:31 - um and also
191:36 - kind of want this
191:41 - oh okay okay let's not so i could let's
191:43 - not get too picky here people
191:45 - um what was i doing
191:51 - uh i
191:55 - wait right right now can i get rid of
191:57 - this
191:59 - that's two characters less okay yes
192:14 - [Music]
192:16 - um
192:28 - i'm so close to being done
192:37 - now let me just run this make sure it's
192:39 - still working oh i've messed everything
192:41 - up
192:44 - what have i done
192:53 - oh help me line 14.
192:57 - i need another curly bracket maybe
193:01 - there we go okay uh does this not fit
193:06 - in my tweet
193:10 - five characters i need to remove five
193:12 - characters from this
193:16 - one more for semicolon in line 14.
193:20 - there's i've gotten good suggestions
193:29 - replace 2 to the 14 with 4 to the 7 okay
193:37 - that's good
193:40 - now i am at
193:46 - i need four four more characters people
193:50 - four more characters to remove instead
193:53 - of
193:54 - x to a equals
194:10 - okay i don't understand that one
194:15 - don't line 14 k is less than two
194:19 - don't understand that one a okay line
194:22 - eight says spectral piano okay can
194:24 - someone grab spectral pianos
194:26 - um uh message
194:30 - equals two with less than three i've
194:32 - already done that i've already done that
194:35 - they need spectral pianos comment i
194:38 - i okay
194:45 - can't capture them i can't capture them
194:47 - it's too fast
194:48 - someone's got to capture it for me
194:52 - thank you
194:56 - okay oh
194:59 - all right line eight
195:03 - it's not line eight anymore
195:07 - well let's look at this a equals
195:11 - v i
195:14 - ampersand two
195:19 - times two oh is this gonna get this is
195:21 - just gonna give me
195:22 - ah i see zero four
195:27 - four zero
195:30 - uh right then i don't need
195:34 - the multiplier
195:39 - is that what's going on here
196:05 - i'm trying to figure out how to get rid
196:07 - of the multiplier
196:16 - uh oh my monitor died
196:31 - okay everything's falling apart
196:41 - i can't see anything anymore
196:45 - what happened there
197:01 - i should have known that it was telling
197:04 - me that
197:05 - there we go okay
197:09 - uh right i should this looks right
197:13 - it's just tiny so i should be able to
197:17 - say
197:21 - four times this right
197:27 - no oh no four times this
197:38 - no
197:40 - i'm very stubborn
197:50 - so this i like what you're doing here
197:52 - this makes sense this would be 0
197:54 - 4 4
198:00 - and then maybe i can just the
198:04 - multiplying can happen here
198:15 - and then i can just do the add here
198:17 - right
198:19 - no how come that doesn't work
198:39 - oh my god people are really
198:47 - i don't think you understand what's
198:49 - happening to me okay
198:50 - hold on all right chris ray has a really
198:53 - interesting suggestion
198:56 - this whole thing
198:59 - can be replaced with i
199:04 - am sand
199:07 - 1
199:10 - to the i ampersand 2 power
199:14 - i don't believe that fascinating
199:18 - that is not right though i'm getting a
199:20 - very interesting pattern there
199:32 - of not k a a equals not
199:35 - k or v and omit the a equals in between
199:44 - okay
199:53 - a equals not k
199:59 - or v but that doesn't really help me at
200:02 - all
200:08 - well i've got to get back to what i had
200:12 - i don't understand that
200:27 - i'm lost i'm completely lost
200:37 - why don't you need to move line 12
200:40 - to line seven i don't understand that at
200:43 - all
200:46 - yeah uh i
200:49 - i believe in this solution
200:52 - but i don't understand it
200:58 - um
201:09 - color mode three oh oh
201:13 - that's genius no the hsb
201:17 - constant is something but it's not
201:22 - three
201:25 - i think it stands for a string actually
201:27 - unfortunately
201:35 - can't remove the mult or the ad
201:38 - yeah i agree
201:49 - okay people i think i might have to give
201:51 - up
201:57 - is this my best
202:04 - oh i'll gain the character
202:08 - in between here
202:12 - okay um
202:36 - um so close
202:39 - line six remove the second two from add
202:42 - oh
202:44 - will that work oh that's a good one
202:48 - that's a good one
202:52 - okay i just need two more characters
202:54 - this can be done
202:55 - right two more characters
203:09 - nope really doesn't want to give me any
203:12 - defaults for hsb
203:22 - i and oh
203:26 - this this is a good i yeah i've been
203:29 - trying
203:30 - this i agree that that should work
203:42 - no
203:44 - there should be a way for me to get 0 1
203:47 - 1 0
203:50 - that sequence but i'm not sure how the
203:53 - suggestions that i've gotten don't seem
203:55 - to work
203:57 - um
204:02 - line 10 remove the last item on the list
204:05 - says marcos
204:14 - i really don't need that zero
204:19 - that's amazing it'll default that's
204:21 - amazing
204:23 - that is totally amazing
204:27 - replace line 10 replace this with times
204:30 - two yeah
204:34 - no that is cool looking though
204:38 - uh what did i do it
204:43 - ah we did it we did it

Cleaned transcript:

do do all right doing a little sound check here how's my audio uh had some technical difficulties where i popped up on the screen for a moment uh let me know how the sound is going i'll be getting started in just about two minutes people are pointing out that the description has time stamps that's just that's an error that's just because i uh cloned last live stream for today and forgot to remove the time stamp so uh i will try to fix that shortly baby good morning everybody welcome to the coding train which has amazingly pulled into the station quite on time which is a thing that almost i don't know this might be the first time in coding train history although technically my clock here says 1002 so i suppose a couple minutes late usually i start the sort of well usually i start things late but then there's the animation and the music and me trying to like fix some wire that became unplugged and things don't get going till quite late but here we are i don't know this must mean it probably means that this is going to be a total disaster of a live stream which of course if i'm being honest is pretty much every coding train live stream but um i don't know maybe today will be the perfect day i don't have a plan oh it's been a month um how's everybody doing um i do have um some thing and while i don't have a plan i do have some things that i want to look at and talk about oh i do have a plan i forgot about my plan all right hold on a second uh let's let me take a minute to just sort of introduce myself perhaps there are new viewers here who have never tuned into the coding train before is that you if that is you please say hello in the chat uh robert uh perhaps has never tuned in before because robert asks is it 10 am or pm for you and it is most distinctly 10 am can't you tell by the glorious sunlight shining in on my face the sun has risen here in brooklyn new york out of the window of this attic i see steam coming from the rooftops of some other small building and some clouds going by i do have a lot of artificial sunlight here it's not really artificial sunlight i have this new elgato key lights elgato are you listening i really like your products did you notice how i also picked up this microphone oh um so that's why that's why i'm positively aglow well oh i was introducing myself so my name is dan um uh or daniel nobody ever calls me i don't know why when i say daniel i think i just said daniel you could call me daniel uh my name is daniel that was that's the name that i was given at the time of my birth oh many many many many years ago i was noticing by the way that um i have a rather young audience and i think that is positively delightful and wonderful um however if it is the morning for you and it is a beautiful day outside and you are part of the youth hey anybody really make sure you take some time to get some physical activity um um and uh sorry i'm very just i have like four different chats going out of the corner of my eye it's really hard to keep it all together i went off at some tangent about um having about um talking to the youth which really really really was the wrong uh train track let me get the train the switcher and go back down this track hello okay my name is dan uh i am somebody who likes to program the computer uh i am somebody who likes to make uh programming video tutorials and i have a youtube channel that you are currently watching where i release a lot of video tutorials and what you are watching right now is a live stream where i essentially uh waste a lot of time um answer some questions from the chat work on some kind of on work on some ongoing projects and read from a random numbers book so they're probably just to be clear better things you could do with your day but if you choose to be here i am grateful i am thankful um and there we go all right so i'm starting to think so i have this system by the way which is uh i got this like j like ultra wide monitor showing me like with like 15 different panels showing me all sorts of various things uh and like how many people are watching what the chat rate is and there's i have a new feature which um i'm going to pin this message from um kobe so you'll see a message that pops up above me this is my new methodology for featuring uh chat messages from the coding train discord right now this is only available to people who have joined as a youtube member which isn't necessarily my future plan forever but i'm sort of testing the system to figure out ways that i can take suggestions answer questions and show them here so i can pin and unpin messages as they come in let me get rid of kobe's message and um and simon asks what if uh just have the overlay on the scene so i think simon is wondering i'm a little awkward so um i don't want to just have a flood of messages going by i want to be able to curate them i want to be able to moderate them so this is the system that i'm working on this is part of um by the way this is kobe writes if you have no plan today dan you could work on the idea we discussed in dms oh you're so kind to think that my memory is intact and my brain works like a normal functioning human that i could positively pull out of the corners of the recesses of my mind the recollection of what was in our direct message i have no idea i'm gonna need a little bit help but what i wanted to do is thank um kobe and david who have been working on this particular system um it is called this stream chat um and you can um take a look you can you could get this stream chat for your it's like a bot and some software and all sorts of stuff it's really better for people who stream on twitch because it has a whole lot of twitch stuff i don't know david and kobe will post some information about that in the chat but thank you for um working on this um to help with the coding train interaction with the audience stuff so i do have some things that i specifically want to do uh today um let's let me pull up my handy dandy computer system here and so i have two kind of projects that i'm working on one is a live poll overlay which has come quite far along since the last time i live streamed so perhaps i could even use it today to do a quick poll to sort of pick the next thing to do that's something that i am sort of excited to start working with um i have been working also on this um presentation manager so right now i also in addition to doing this nonsense that i do on youtube i teach courses at new york university my copious amounts of spare time and um all the the courses that i'm teaching are currently fully remote um i'm using video conferencing software not a sponsor i'm just like this is just me like like asking for sponsors which is really a little bit weird anyway um so um and i've been struggling really with time management so i built this little tool that i can make a as a virtual camera out of it to pipe into uh let's just say it's zoom i'm using zoom okay not music zoom so i can create a zoom i can log into my class from a separate account that's different than me or i could do it as an overlay but the point of what i'm saying is this appears as a box in zoom and i can control it over web sockets to say who's going to be up next how much time you have left and really helps with um uh really helps with really helps with time management okay i got to pull up some of these messages that i'm enjoying so marcos says uh dan can only remember random numbers well i can't actually remember them the reason i don't need to remember them is because i have an entire book full of them and octopus would really like to see more of the live poll stuff octopus you are in luck so um these are ah the new year's event sketch right so that's i'm gonna save that though kobe that's great i think i'm gonna save that because um it's not yet december today is technically still november 29th it's still november and i am planning to do a lot of fun stuff for the holidays and new year's in december raise money for the processing foundation um do some community engagement stuff with all of you um and so that's coming but i'm gonna wait until december begins okay um is your shirt green by any chance it is not oh there is a cat make it come here there's a cat making some very loud noises over there look i have by the way also have a system by which i can show you the cat oh cat's leaving come on oh my god the cat has something in its mouth it's a toy it's one of my i think it's one of my daughter's toys but it looked like a little like a small rodent that it had captured all right i'm not going to worry about trying to show you the cat right now okay ah this is very hard to make but you know you just add one more piece of software on my console and i'm lost um so okay so these are two things live poll presentation manager let me also pull up something else i am now navigating over to my a twitter account um and looking for a particular uh tweet that i sent that's just a reply and let me see if i can find it aha here we go now i'm going to pull this back up for you to see so this is the other thing that i am very excited to maybe explore today open call for tiny code sketches tweet your creative code in less than 256 characters and we will display it on the media facade at media lab prado on saturday december 12th plus info so we can click over here so first of all um this is something that i have been following on social media for quite some time i uh i think there's a variety of different initiatives different hashtags there's one called twitter or something maybe even where people will post a very small amount of code that fits into a tweet along with a gif animation or recording of it and it's just it blows my mind what people are able to do and so what i want to work on today is not make my own submission to this that is not my role in the world my role in the world is to help other people like who are have creative ideas and uh think in beautiful wonderful ways to be able to share and express themselves and so if i can make a little example and some tips and tricks for how to get your p5 code down to or processing code or whatever your code might be down to a small number of characters um then um then i'm bringing up a question here um and then uh i'm excited about that so those are the three things on my list live poll presentation manager oh i got another thing on my list well i wanted to revisit my fall 2020 list to see how i did which is you know c plus b minus c plus i would give myself as a grade um um but um i also on this list i recall is i need to work i was planning to work on http uh this a new release of this particular processing library so many things to do and yet it's only 10 15. ah the whole day is ahead of me here okay what is on my hat not a very exciting answer uh but um it is a this is a baltimore orioles hat that is a baseball team here in these united states um i grew up in baltimore maryland i went to many a baltimore earl's game at the old memorial stadium i once i said recently i said to somebody oh you mean at the new stadium the news this is not going to be interesting to like 99.7 percent of you but i will just go with that for a second um the the current stadium in baltimore where the orioles play is called camden yards and to me that's the new stadium but somebody could look up on wikipedia it's probably been there for like 25 years at least uh but i think of it as the new stadium ah memorial stadium those were the days all right so um now i should be able to ooh so one thing that's tricky now here's some live feedback i've got it when there's a lot of messages coming in to the chat here i got to scroll back down to find the one to unpin okay um close out a bunch of things one thing i did which is very exciting my upgrade to my studio today is i moved the mouse got a usb extension so i can control it's not my laptop here which is a different computer it's not that interesting is it maybe it's interesting why everybody want a little behind the scenes let's look at a little behind the scenes for a second all right let's see if we can make this happen and then we're gonna then i'm gonna try to get the live poll going uh let's see connecting to your computer ensure that your phone and computer on the same wifi network or connected via the usb cable this should work come on fancy epoc cam thingy um let's see how do i get this to work not coming up so this is my new way of wirelessly connecting my phone camera and it's not working for whatever reason so i guess my little behind the scenes show and tell will have to wait until later okay um i don't even know how to turn this off now there we go all right i'll figure that out later um okay let's read some random numbers this always helps me feel relaxed soothed centered and ready to attack attack in a very friendly way give a nice friendly hug to the day oh wait uh speaking of discord bring this up here um i need to uh figure out so a couple things i want to mention about uh discord is that uh you may have noticed that i recently released a few uh three video tutorials on how to make a discord bot there are three more coming one is how to use env to hide your api keys uh it's about six minutes long i wouldn't be surprised if it's out on monday or tuesday very very short quick tutorial the one after that is how to um post uh gifs to discord um and you can see here that i've added a new command exclamation point gif uh kitten um and um so that there that is the next uh that's the s one of the video tutorials that is coming out how to do this and then the third video tour which will be a little bit later it was recorded separately and i'm just finishing getting it put together is about how to write a command handler hey wait a second k wickman is typing this is supposed to be a channel that only i have access to maybe that's not actually true um i don't know what's going on here so ah but the reason why i came into the discord is this is usually where i keep track of where i was in my quest my quest to read the entire book of random numbers it looks like the last time i did this was uh november 7th 2020 and i finished up oh we should do some community contributions today of course i finished up on row 14 oh boy i'm still on page one everybody page one of my book um i uh need to go to row 14 and column two all right let's see what we can get let's see if we can at least get maybe we can get to row 16 today that'll be really exciting 87 517 64 969 ninety one thousand eight hundred twenty six eight thousand nine hundred and twenty eight ninety three thousand seven hundred and eighty five sixty one thousand three hundred sixty eight twenty three thousand four hundred and seventy eight thirty four thousand one hundred and thirteen sixty five thousand four hundred eighty one seventeen thousand six hundred seventy four seventeen thousand four hundred sixty eight fifty thousand nine hundred and fifty boy this is a little depressing i feel like we need something a little bit more exciting ninety one thousand eight hundred and twenty six eight thousand nine hundred and twenty eight ninety three thousand seven hundred and eighty five sixty one thousand three hundred sixty 23 478 34 113 65 481 17 674 17 468 thousand nine hundred fifty fifty eight thousand forty seven seventy six thousand nine hundred and seventy four seventy three thousand thirty nine fifty seven thousand one eighty six forty thousand two hundred eighteen and sixteen thousand five hundred and forty four all right everybody whoo yeah oh boy what a thrilling and exciting morning this is move the book from in front of the mic i think the sound is being muffled oh you think well you know you win some you lose some um i guess i will have to figure that out also uh i don't know if the mic is actually a little bit quiet here let me turn that up uh okay music is overpowering the voice audio okay so is uh well hold on i gotta mute myself i'm about to sneeze this very exciting moment so do okay boy it's so many things to control right now i'm going a little crazy i can't even turn around the music okay i mean i i wish i could show you my behind the scenes here because i've got like the craziest console of stuff going on right now definitely need to get myself a purdue production team actually the most exciting thing if you will bear with me for a second um i i need somebody i need someone to give me like a really good uh quick um dad joke i know can you still hear me i guess why why why is um what's that number joke where nine is afraid of eight or something but eight is afraid of seven nine is afraid of seven because seven eight nine okay new drum new drum new drum set everybody i don't think that was worth it uh i can't show it to you because i can't seem to get my mobile camera working but um my son who plays the drums he's he got we got uh a friend was uh giving away their drum set so no more electronic drums for him a real life actual drum set let me get him up here to be my band leader um we'll see if we can make that happen for everybody at some point okay oh is that like really loud the um hold on i'm amazed by what's going on here ah too many things okay i need ghost chair yeah okay um all right all right all right settle down everybody let's take a minute to see if we can get the live poll going so um i am going to open up um i term here and uh check in on my live pull a web application grab the latest version of it now i seem to have made some changes here that i have no idea what they are uh let me move this down here and close this okay so many distractions all right so what's going on here i think if i type git diff it's gonna show me what weirdness i've put in here anything that i put into this can't possibly be uh stuff that i want so i'm gonna say git stash which will stash any weird changes that are in there then i can get uh what is actually from the repo let's open up the code and take a look so what is this live poll application so first of all i have a lot of people to thank um so one of the things i certainly realized is my technique of like putting out a web application into the world putting it on github having a bunch of people look at it and submit some issues and pull requests over a week and then me coming back to it live on stream to try to look at those pull requests analyze them understand them merge them resolve conflicts did not make for a good live stream i don't think that was a particularly productive use of anybody's time so i have been taking making some effort to manage this in between live streams so rather than try to merge a bunch of pull requests right now i can actually just go through and show you a bunch of things that have been added so there has been some restructuring and refactoring um one of the things you'll notice here to all of these ads so and so as a contributor ad so and so as a contributor this is something um new that i added if you're not familiar with there is a particular bot that you can um add onto a github repo it's called the all contributors bot and it follows this all contributors spec so this is a specification for recognizing contributors to an open source project in a way that rewards each and every contribution not just code this is something that i care very deeply about uh credit and acknowledging labor and credit and volunteerism and paying people and all of that all of the myriad kind of complicated discussions and topics that come up around open source software development so um there's no easy answers to all the different questions i ask myself all day long about how to work on open source in as inclusive in an equitable way as possible but i think all contributors is a good starting point so just so you know you can see here that anybody who has made a contribution whether it's an idea or a bit of code um can be acknowledged in the readme and it that process is automated so i don't know if um anyway so we'll see if i can demonstrate that actually let me demonstrate that right now um let's see here let's look at the issues um so actually i don't think i acknowledged john telton who and actually i want to look at this because i want to see if i can get this onto glitch um and so what i can do now because i have the all contributors bot added to this project i can say all contributors add john t alton4 and let's just say for ideas maybe there's one for like reference there's a there's a set a prewritten list of categories of kinds of contributions that you can tag people with um the one that always jumps to my mind is ideas so if i add this and i put a comment here um any moment now if i did that correctly we should see i can like play my little drum see i could actually get my son he can do this live but we can see we got this pull request so i can move on over to the pull request and um i'm just going to assume this is adding john talton as a contributor for ideas requested by shiffman in this comment and i can now squash and merge this and then if i go back to the main readme we'll see that john has been added here so this is one thing that's happened i think probably the most significant there's a couple of significant things that have changed um and it's actually interestingly enough now i'm noticing that it does create a lot of noise in the repo i don't know if there's a better way to manage that because now like i don't want to like find a couple of the key pull requests recently and there's like so many all contributors posts pull requests but that aside i still think it's a it's a it's a really great tool um there's a bunch of refactoring a bunch of like fixing just mistakes that happened as i just willynilly was merging people's pull requests without checking them there's no testing um fixing of the rats but i was looking for some of the design stuff um that i wanted to um coats this was super helpful by the way um i don't know too much about this but um this apparently so i'm like obsessed with code formatting and i really advocate that all of you watching do not don't be like me but um my shirt is not key this is a blue shirt oh it's totally what is going on why is it also half it's the same color is it because of this light wait a second this is the weirdest thing ever what is going on oh no that's it's not half it's just like actually keyed out okay i didn't realize that this shirt was gotta work on my key okay um so um so i'm trying to understand how to have good auto formatting of my code that maintains a set of standards and isn't isn't a barrier isn't like causing so much pain and suffering that it's actually making it harder to do a project but just keeping things neat and tidy and i think one of the things that's always been a point of confusion for me is and looking at this pull request it kind of helps me there's prettier there's eslint and there's husky so what are these things prettier from what i understand is a code formatting uh well it's what is it let's let's look at how does it define itself opinionated um code formatter so this actually uh form will format the code right put all the spacing in invitation in add semicolons make everything single quotes or double quotes i believe if i'm correct yes lint is not a code formatter but is a code linting which means we'll check your code to see whether it complies with a set of standards or not and then husky i guess is some kind of like dev tool that will write a bunch of scripts to reformat things with prettier check for mistakes with eslint is this um is this how interesting anyway so a lot of the stuff has been added so i would like to understand this better and one thing that i can see is that like ah so if i want to use single quotes there should be this prettier rc file which i can see here and single quotes i could change to true and then if i go to one of my bits of code somewhere let's find one that has quotes in it ah here if i now hit save i change it to single quotes now why did i get this weird error fail to load module if you have prettier or plugins referenced in package.json ensure that you have run npm install oh so the new aha because i pulled the code from this pull request down i now also need to run npm install to get the new packages like husky lint stage eslint plugin printer and eslint lint stage eslint fix so much stuff so much stuff lint fix oh so these are some new things lint staged post install i don't know do i need to run this post install looks like i might right i assume i have to say like now npm run post i'm post install okay done husky is for universal git hux get hooks i cannot speak today all right so anyway moving along very very slowly here i now have in this project and one of the things i really like about working this way is on with these kind of weekend side projects meandering through figuring this stuff out is you know if i could get my act together eventually if i wanted to i could do some tutorials then that kind of go through some of these bits and pieces more step by step but um what i also wanted to highlight so thank you samuel martino martino for that but i wanted to look for the um some of the design stuff that was added see if i can find i mean let's see rainbow no i could have sworn seven days ago that pretty recently there was some work done to um add a bunch of visual design elements anyway i'm not it's not i'm not not finding it right now and i see that vishal in the chat says use typescript no i will never use typescript and then you could what like two years from now when like entire coding range is all typescript you can you can play that clip back for me um but let's let's see if we can get this running so there's a bit of awkwardness still with this live poll in that um there is no system to there's no uh endpoint or frontend page for creating a new poll it all happens manly right now by uncommenting and commenting back in this create new poll function so let me take a look at that um here so in um i'm looking for index.js or server index.js create new poll so let's see what happens there create new poll how come i can't find this here it is oh wait huh oh right okay so this is this is me so this is hard coding in a new poll which is certainly by the way there's a weird echo going on in here today so what should we do now i'll i'll leave that question or what next let's see so let's try oh this is good well except for bots so um ah so what do i do what what's the thing to say what what did i what was i calling that tiny code so these are three things i mean the live poll to be honest like it's it's a more live poll work look at community contributions or tiny code those will be the three options that i want to explore right now so i believe if i just put comment back in this create new poll function and uh let's follow the readme here um and okay i should could be running npm run dev already so that should have created the new poll then i want to go back and uncomment this so that should have restarted the server let's go to the server now why don't i see anything ah oh no so i need to then look at script.js line 36 so i probably need to then go into the database here and grab this id right this is the poll that i want to look at again all of this should eventually be automated in a very elegant way where i can just launch a poll through an interface but right now it's all very manual i'm going to grab that id and then i'm going to go to the web page that i'm looking at which can actually get uh get the poll id from url parameters but i could also just make it the default one right so if i go and make it the default poll id here paste that in then i should be able to refresh this page aha so here's a bug early bug if there are no votes it should probably have them all be zero percent so if i want to vote to continue working on the live poll i can see that that now is a hundred percent so in theory now and the other thing is this this does not need to have uh does not need to be keyed out so let me also change um the background um to be just transparent so i don't need a background color how do i comment something out in css that's weird how do you comment out css is that not possible oops i also just completely reformatted all of this somebody's got to know q a could be nice as well yeah i've never had a good luck with doing q and a's but um i guess i could just delete this fine delete this and refresh and that's good so now if i wanted to host this um well let's see let's do dude i um i can end rocket let's see so i'm going to use this um ngrok tool is this what i do no oh no ngrok http 3000. that's what i say okay so i should be so now people can actually go and vote right now um at this particular url which i can just put into um discord as well in the live links channel let's see does that actually work so if i vote here yeah so i don't know maybe maybe you're still 30 seconds behind so let's see if the votes can uh start coming in but what i want to do is get it as an overlay in open broadcast studio so oh i have my mouse here where is that um so i need to add a new browser source um and add and grok um and then look at its properties and i need to go to oh i can just copy this from discord uh where is that i'm going to um uh and i want to deploy this to glitch so give me a moment i'm going to do that next but i just want to see if this works i'm looking for where is my links okay copy link paste link okay and there we go it should be uh the live poll should be going now uh visually i've got a bit of an issue here where maybe um i need to think about how to make it appear better because i could go over to here um and well i don't know what is gone happening there let's go to um transform reset there we go so now i guess i guess so now i can cut this off and here we go so uh go ahead and vote as no one pasted the link into the actual chat i will do so this is very exciting there's apparently there's 500 people watching which is kind of nuts um tiny code is growing very dramatic you don't store the so somebody did make a uh pull request there was a pull request that did something to protect against stuffing the ballot oh god no please can i not talk about voting um i've got some breaking news here everybody breaking news 46 of coding trained viewers are so meta they just want to vote for working on the voting system itself yes you can vote multiple times i think but somebody did put something in there was a particular let's see if i can get to it here there was a particular pull request that had some kind of like validation thing involved with it um what is going on where am i oh i mean all contributors i want to go here uh there was a pull request that somebody implemented to do some um validation and and protection simple timebased antispam package and test so this was crunchy pie um who added a package for lightweight antispam guard it's time based so so i think what if i'm looking at this right that maybe this just protects you from voting more than once within a very short period of time so i think you can vote again but you have to wait 30 seconds 60 seconds i'm not entirely sure you can reload the ip um and you could but okay tiny code is now anyway i didn't mean for this to be super scientific um do not use the rainbow it's not colorblind accessible yes so that's also uh thank you for pointing that out prathamesh um one thing that's very important to consider is accessibility in design and which is to sort of uh you know my understanding of sort of what primary thing to look at is contrast color contrast um and so crabby says i use set interval anyway i voted 18 times and octopus is very sad here tiny code overtook the live poll all right well um there we go uh this was interesting to see i used a clicker says antivenom that must be some fancy futuristic technology here all right so i do want to definitely take a look at the tiny code stuff this is so weird this is like this is like oppo this is like bizarro coding train i started on time i was like i must be running out of time now it's only 10 45. i'm like doing this for hours on end um and um but uh bader says they spammed tiny code the antispam isn't connected um so where do i say samuel martino so cross says that they are colorblind um and so uh definitely fi if um you know cross i hopefully um if you have some experience with this whether your own personal experience or as a designer uh color um if uh if you want to file an issue um that um to um i would love to correct the a rainbow design and use a different design so that it is accessible to anyone who has color blindness or any other type of vision impairment okay all right so moving along here let's uh put the so the so what what next let me solicit some help from people so what are some things that need to happen next for the live poll i will make an issue here and i will say help wanted um future improvements now ordinarily i might suggest oh and you're not seeing what i'm doing here ordinarily i might suggest um and uh let's see here nope shoot the wrong one okay ordinarily i might suggest a separate issue for each uh improvement or bug report but because i'm live streaming and i want to move quickly here i just want to create a quick list of things that are um ah and flesh mash mesh mesh in prathamesh is pronounced like it rhymes with flesh let's let me practice this one another thing that's very important to me is pronouncing people's names correctly um i do my best i don't always remember it's something that i really work on with students that i have in my nyu classes it's you know i feel like it's not their job to correct me or to sit quietly while i mispronounce their names it's my job to learn to pronounce names correctly um and so the mesh in profamesh is pronounced like it rhymes with flesh not mash so profamesh hopefully that was an improvement on the pronunciation now so what are some things that need to happen next deploy to glitch which i could work on today myself um oh yeah a different cat has emerged by the way um uh accessibility concerns uh color um rainbow color etc um uh what else um endpoint for new poll and front and for new poll uh antispam protections what else um oh yeah and there was a suggestion it's already in there as an issue to add web sockets so that so that would be a nice improvement um okay so what else am i missing anything important um i'm going to submit this issue these will be things that i will hopefully consider for next week also i have to figure out how to have i guess another question is um i'm gonna make this a new issue uh overlay design how um different views for uh different scenarios in obs for example um maybe a semitransparent background for when the obs video is very noisy and busy i don't that makes sense what i'm saying here transparent all right all right moving along [Laughter] let me move to looking at uh so i i would love for people to continue to work on this submit pull requests file issues i'm trying to keep an eye on it over the course of the week i'm kind of managing this myself doing a pretty poor job of it but i i welcome your contributions um now let's move on to looking at tiny code sketches so i want to understand um um how this works what are what are some of the let me see if i can find very briefly um one of the hashtags that i really like um shoot is kind of awkward that i'm not signed in on twitter but i think it's fine so also i'm looking for something um yeah so ah natto must be watching i'm looking under um because natto just uh screenshot the poll on twitter the reason why i'm looking for an alto i don't know if i'm pronouncing your name correctly um i would love help with that i'm looking for maybe you can help me with this um if you're in the chat i i feel like i went to your twitter instantly to find some of the hashtags i feel like you're always retweeting um tinycode sketches um so ah okay uh here we go let's look at this casey reese tweet which i think has a couple this is this is perfect um so um i am at this tweet now where i believe that these are two hashtags that are used quite commonly for these um tiny code challenges so let's click on both of these and let's take a look oh they couldn't you believe that this game it's like i i just like oh my god i can't believe how wonderful this is like the greatest thing ever and i can't i'm only sad that i didn't make it myself i can't believe this came up so perfect so here's the idea and what i what i wanted to do was start to understand how like what are some of these tricks here that are being used to whittle down a longer piece of code into something shorter so i thought what might make sense is for me to take one of my coding challenges um and right so there is a the concept thank you to uh kobe who's posted the concept is known as code golfing so i i'm quite familiar with it as a regex golf which is this idea of like trying to write the shortest regular expression to match a particular pattern um so um but in a way like i think of i you know i don't love the sort of competitive nature of code golfing um what i think is wonderful about this is it's not really about having the shortest code it's about this sort of creative constraint because there's nothing inherently better but this sketch fits into fewer characters than what it is right now as long as it can fit within this constraint of a single tweet um so let's see let's so first of all let's just let's just prove the point that this works by going to the p5 web editor and let's um what should i call this um so this is i'm just going to put a comment here i'm just going to let's get to this yeah perfect it's going to put a comment in here and now i think i can close this um let's go to here and let's grab this code and let's run it and whoa wow ah interesting so what's missing why is this showing up differently now a couple ah okay i i do oh i know why so a little uh unfortunate thing happened here where um the emojis uh didn't copy paste correctly so let's see if i can replace those with my own let's see so let me get to a tree let's put this here and then let's put the tram tram car train which was what was used here let's just try i don't know if um i don't know if it matters let's just use this one tram car and let's run it there we go and what is there another one that i'm missing here or yeah no that's just ah there's no white uh so i suppose would it if i did this there we go so i've gotten something close now so there's a little bit of extra stuff there and let me just so what is the magic of what's happening here there's a lot of tricks to this first of all no semicolons lots of one character variable names create it's really unfortunate that create canvas is such a long word but let's let's go to uh codingtrain.com let's go to the coding challenges and let's find one um and see if we can fit it into a tweet the raycasting one is kind of interesting i don't know if anybody has a particular oh i'm in in dark mode also right that's that's why in the web editor thank you that's obviously a great point like could i um like well no i can't get the open simplex noise loop to work because it requires um a whole separate library but i could try like a perlin noise loop that's an interesting one to try um let's look at the code for this one yeah so for example could i fit this into a tweet um and right and um this is a great comment also from uh kobe who says code golfing is an art in this case and not a competition which makes it beautiful and i i really do agree with that sentiment um so let's see oh the meta balls one is also a good one i don't know i think i'm going to try this one so let me duplicate it and um so let's try this as purlin noise loop tiny code okay and uh in case anyone wants to follow along i'm really i think i'm having an allergy to my pets today um you know actually i was cleaning up up here in the attic and i think i kicked up a lot of dust i'm constantly feeling like i need to sneeze so i apologize it's coming along um let me post a link to this sketch so if people want to follow along you know as i save you'll be able to refresh this url and you'll get the code so let's see so i'm going to get rid of the slider first of all and just have it be a fixed value so where what this noise max uh what what did we have the slider range it started at uh between 0 and 10 and the default was 3. so let me just get rid of the slider here and change the um this to three now i wish i had a chrome extension or something that could actively count the number of characters i have here i mean i could always just go whoops well i'm not logged i can't uh i guess i need to log into twitter let's let's let's make that happen people um give me a second here um login it's gonna take me an hour to log into my twitter account because i have to look up my password at my password manager and um uh talk amongst yourselves for a minute here people do do okay i i was much too afraid to log into my actual twitter account so i logged into this account for a twitter bot example that i was been working on and just for the sake of argument what i want to do is go over to um the p5 web editor grab this code and paste it in here so we can see here this is how i am oh it's wow look at this because it's in the code comments it actually gave a little preview to the video here so i'm 441 characters over so we got to get get working on this first of all i think we can get rid of all of these um let's do auto refresh i'm not you know um so the uh i was gonna say i i don't need the slider sorry um i can see immediately that i don't need this noise max variable because i can just put three and three here um i um phase can be a one letter variable z offset can be a one letter variable so let's do p p z let's call this x y x so i'm just like lowering variable names right now um and shape close p and z so even just with x has already been declared oh um so this is totally extra stuff that i don't need here let's look at this okay so we can see even with just making some one ver a tiny code is 256 that's correct so the limit this is a um sorry this is a really good um comment from octopus twitter has a limp character of 280 characters i believe the constraint for the tiny code challenge is uh 256. so i should try to make that i can use tau rather than two pi there we go all right so i'm going to definitely be taking your suggestions from the chat uh thank you for that one luke finch um arrow functions and no let const for variables so here's another one let's do this so instead of saying function setup can be this and draw can be this i think is how i have to write it still good and no let and const so i think i could do this right p comma z equals zero no p is not defined is that a thing yeah i didn't know you could do that but let's say that all right so let's see how we're doing character wise right i'm now fitting into a tweet i'm only 178 i just like lost 300 characters amazing so now um all of the white space can go right so um all right so this i mean i still need to be able to follow it somehow i should be able to just say clear that is much better do i need to do translate probably translate so this i could also do as this i mean do i need a stroke weight of two do i need to say no phil now here's the question radians of five uh no the other way around five degrees so point like i do about point zero eight um oh no no there needs to be a space there don't auto format no no no format uh okay so there's also this simon is saying use underscore instead of parentheses friends this is not something i know about i can do this huh i never have seen this what the what is that that i have never seen use minifire so right so who am i suggesting i could use a minifier but i kind of want to do this manually to understand uh draw so that's saving me a character still good still good um i feel like i can get away without using map there's got the math for this is much simpler right like i could just say right six times cosine plus three right that's that's the equivalent of this map function so y equals six times sine plus three is this still working oh i did something weird i thought i would go wasn't i mapping it between it's fine i like this anyway did i am i confused i'm i'm lost here oh no no plus it should be three times plus three there we go right because i'm trying to now um sorry i my system for comments is i'm now like if i so i think what i need by the way here's a little feedback for uh just stream chat if i pin something it needs to stay on the top of needs to stay on the top of the scroll so i can always like go out of order so i can always just unpin it and then i can go back because now i have to like get through a whole lot of comments to find the ones that i pinned also the green is very hard for me to see little comments you guys can't see this but i could uh um all right so now uh r is map noise and right i don't need to have these separate variables this goes here this goes i'm going to get to do so much more i have so many characters left z and i can i don't need the map function right r oh no do i yeah r equals noise of three times cosine plus three three times sine and i'm mapping it goes between 0 and 1 and i want it to be between 100 and height divided by 2. so times 200 plus one let's just do that for right now then vertex set the vertex uh end shape get rid of some spaces and how am i doing people look at that i got 12 more characters left to go oh amazing wow oh i messed something up here but um there we go uh so hold on hold on let me finish this off this is very exciting now i do want to log into my real twitter account so i can tweet it i still have uh line breaks no i messed something up um what did i mess up ah because if i put everything on the same line that needs a semicolon i guess there we go look at me so did i get this into 256 that's the question um do i have enough i have enough space for the hashtag that's for sure uh the question is do i um the other thing about this the whole point of this demonstration is that it's a loop it'll actually like animate a loop but i could rename sine and cosine to s and c that's interesting would that really save me a lot of space it might because am i using them a bunch of times like in other words if i go back to does this still work no oh because it's not in setup so that works and then and then c s c s that's interesting did i save characters there so currently this is with 17 additional characters third no that's that added characters me adding s equals sine c equals cosine that added characters is that really true let's see here yeah i did so how many characters is this is um is this so if i do 263 so to get this in the let in the for loop there's a let in the for loop okay thank you everybody that will get me a bunch where's my let and also can i get away with this yep so i don't need that zero leading zero i don't need this one i don't need this one okay that's good so now wait uh oh i need to i need to shave off two more characters shave off two more characters what can i shave off here there's a semicolon oh there we go there's one one more character um i mean i could does this close actually really necessary or is it enough that it will get there no whoops shoot what did i just do uh oh what error do i have i have lost something ah i don't know what that is oh did i get rid of that no the clue okay so now let me get rid of the clothes well i guess i could have it have one more i i could have it um by the way i really like how this looks i could have it be divisible perfectly by two pie let's put the clothes back so right now i feel like i need the clothes and but do i have i did it okay so now now i need to capture this as a gif that perfectly loops how do i render it with a perfect loop oh my god um well here first let me hit save i should now i should really log into my actual twitter account so i'm gonna do something illadvised first of all i'm gonna paste this into just a text file here then i'm gonna hit auto format just curious okay that's better i prefer to look at it this way anyway so if i wanted to get the idea of this also is that it's a loop so um i believe oh i don't know that it's oh this is just a closed loop here uh it won't be a perfect loop yeah no no i was i forgot this is part of my series about how to make a perfect loop with noise but i'm not loop i'm not making a perfect loop of the animation i would need a fourth dimension there i think or just have the z value um be walking through walking through circular values anyway um so i'll just i'll just capture this this way and we're gonna make our so i know hopefully this helps people sort of see some tips and techniques of things you could do um whoops um let's clear all these i don't know what's in here uh clear captures yes um and let's just grab a small amount of this i think maybe i'm where's 400 400 let's okay let's also what was i trying to do here um oh wait where am i what's going on people um would i let's change the stroke weight to four i think that'll look a little nicer to eight to two here what's p doing well that's the phase uh i can't add can i add an extra character no that's not what i want okay don't stop stop i don't care all right let's let's go back to uh four all right so now i want to record this for a little bit we'll just do like a little 10 second or five second gif um pixel size original is fine save as uh gif desktop noise tiny code could i i give it like a higher frame rate and will it still um tolerate me yeah okay so now what's the only thing i changed was four right all right i think i have to post this from my actual uh thank you to john person um for your very kind uh donation it's much appreciated uh i don't believe that it will become selfaware a random number yes john person will get a random number um but i gotta finish this i gotta finish what i'm doing here so uh i'm gonna i'm gonna go ahead and log community contributions have moved up into the poll so that's what we'll do next um i am going to move to signing into my actual twitter account um because i believe now this should be posted from my actual twitter account where are we 11 20 okay log out how do i log out oh add existing account uh shiffman this will take a moment here for me to find my twitter account password i suppose i should mute my for all of you people who are picking up my password from my keys okay two factoring myself in and tweet okay so now um here we are i should be able to grab code what was the one thing i changed i just made the stroke weight so that goes there tiny code is that the hashtag i want i also want oops um i like this one p5t um they both fit um coding train can you do a train as a hashtag not really right um okay so i've got seven characters left i don't know what to do uh okay what's happening here um all right so i've got this now what do i want next i want to get that gif and put it here ah oh internet there we go come on there we go there we go um add a description sure um a wiggly like a circular jagged polygon with white outline and no fill jiggles and rotates with purlin noise okay so got that so i think i think i'm good to go i'm ready to tweet this this is very exciting uh arnov is trying the hilbert curve would have been a good one the hilbert curve that's a probably that that's i oh now i want to do it with the hilbert curve let's do the hilbert curve after this why not should i do another live poll since that was so successful all right let's tweet this one out and watch watch the likes and replies come in look at this look at this ah oh give me those fake internet points all i ever wanted was fake internet points the real internet points anybody got it under 200 oh oh so um if anybody has gotten it shorter particularly if you're in the member discord chat and you want to paste it in a discord message i can feature that on screen look at my internet points they're just like flowing overflowing i really i'm not i should not be allowed to do what i'm doing what is going on with this message all right um oh this was fun uh okay okay everyone wants me to give the random number to the john person all right so first of all i just want to say thank you for your super chat i wanted to be clear that i do appreciate the donations they actually make a difference here in terms of uh the sort of mental budget i have for the channel and things that i'm buying for equipment and having time to do it and i appreciate everybody's membership but i do want to be it's really thoughtful about um uh how i ask for that hey i i don't i'm not actually soliciting your donations or your memberships it's great if you can support in that way but if you do have um i'm doing fine and if you are looking to donate i might suggest a local food bank or um any other sort of nonprofit that's helping people who um really really need the help especially in this difficult time and then if after you've donated there you want to donate some to me still that's great also of course the processing foundation i will be doing a fundraiser for them in july but for your donation john person i would like to provide you with your very own random number the setup function does not need the curly braces oh that's a good one thank you mika uh eleven thousand and six hundred it's quite a round number oh niraj stop for the donations people niraj thank you for blinking my lights and connor all these random numbers okay okay okay the eggs i 8781 29643 okay thank you everybody ron and uh not ron connor uh simon posted this trick five times sorry simon i missed it uh all right now um let's see i kind of want to go do the hilbert so where oh i see set up there and so why don't i need the curl i don't need the curly braces because it's one line of code that's cool to see okay um let's do let's do one more because i can't now i'm having fun i can't resist this um let's do one more um let's grab the hilbert curve code and let's do duplicate hilbert curve tiny code um save and then for anybody who is looking for this later i posted the link in the discord okay so let's look here let's make sure this works ooh oh this is my crazy rainbow one too all right can i get this into 256 characters all right um so first we know we can get rid let's let's look at what we're what we're starting with here what are we starting with and i'm just well into my own twitter account now here we're starting with uh oh that's bad oh boy uh how's this gonna go oh no no uh so let's see let's get over here so first thing we can save a lot also i think just okay oops uh hold on i'm going to i'm just so let's let's take off some stuff here that is make i'm trying to just make it run oh look there's some commented stuff that's gonna help um just sort of shortening the code in the first place um oh i wasn't auto refreshing what is wrong with me okay that's what i this is what i wanted let me get it to like all right this is good okay so let's look here what are some things oh i'm using like vectors and stuff so that's oh my god this is going to be an interesting challenge oh my goodness oh what have i done oh i created a hard one let's see what let's see where we are now 975 characters to go okay so order as six i can get rid of this variable uh line 43 yeah okay that's good i just have to remember that um all right so that's good um now uh n don't need this here we're good total can i get rid of this yup path counter being zero okay uh i don't need this background here isn't there some way to like make the counter go up here okay so we're getting somewhere um i mean this is silly for me to start just getting rid of the all right length is width divided by n so if n is going to be two to the sixth power um which is with divided by so like if i said 512 divided by two to the sixth power that's just eight so get rid of this and i think the question is should i try i should probably make this i guess i'm going to leave what it is right now um and we know we can do i don't understand this i don't understand how that works okay what did i do i need this here right i think all the vector stuff i'm gonna have to rethink but where else okay oh this can absolutely be um do i even need these no i guess i do what if i do hsb yeah okay so now i'm now we're cooking here all right um now uh so how am i doing how are we doing character wise oh my god i still have 650 characters to go i'm oops still pretty good pretty pretty pretty good all right um so i know just leave some i need to leave line breaks until the end because i've got to be able to look at this this should work chaining should work right and then i also don't need these ah what did i do line six oh i need another parentheses oh no no there here there we go okay that's good um okay that's this is looking good now the setup um now let's see here clear um okay now this this hilbert function is really where i need to do some other stuff all right so why do i say new p5 vector and not create vector and this will save me some characters okay so this also can i make this function just called h okay am i already using p for path it's okay though um so points i'll call it t now i'm assuming there's a way i'm going to be able to not call oh well what if i did what if i did that and then oh no i have v here um so let's call this oh there's only so many letters in the alphabet a create vector uh uh create let's call it i don't know a a for create create i ate the vector or i could call this i'll call that a let's let's keep that as v and let's just change this to a k equals i ampersand three and then also um wow this is actually quite enjoyable oh am i still going here ah i better i better get this working here oh we're gonna need uh boy this is this is gonna need some serious work there's gotta be some ways uh and this is k k k i believe return a just want to make sure this works v is not defined 17 v equals create vector hmm just just to double check this why is this not save and create vector hmm why am i not save and create vector let's see just put create vector back here for a second just one i don't want to break it so much that i can't get it back index is not a fine line 23 okay okay i'm back so why is vv equal create vector oh because it's aha where do i call the hilbert function make this first line of code okay because hilbert is being called oh hilbert's being the hilbert function is being called right there no wonder okay i have to have that beforehand okay let's let's have a little check in here oh vv pv okay okay still got it let's uh whoa oh we're doing we're doing well just got to get rid of 444 more characters no problem no problem okay uh can i do that okay um a lot of this happening so now length is power 2 to the j there is a way to write the power function right i also have this here this i've got to be able to do or isn't there a bit shifting way to write this um n equals 2 to the sixth power um change um right somebody will tell me that that i can never pull i can't um but certainly here this can be l equals power 2 to the j for right now um and this can be um i don't know if this is is that fewer characters i think it might be did i already use t can i use t oh is the switch statement going to do this for me do i need a switch statement all right so power 2 to the j is the same as 2 exclamation uh two asterisk asterisk j thank you for that um so this i should be able to say two asterisk asterisk six oh is it also isn't that just the number 64. 2 to the ones two four eight sixteen thirtytwo sixtyfour sixtyfour uh length is not defined line 25 okay i'm back um oh i can't stop myself here must succeed at this just want to see like what where am i really with all of this okay this no temp is not fine 31t just i need a reality check here okay please remove the else is oh that's a good point right this isn't great coding but will certainly work line 36 hmm what did i mess up here for ifko no k is 2 k is 1 k is 0 4 oh okay hold on this is opening a for loop if statement if statement ah that should okay what am i working with now wait oh i got only 200 characters more to go ah this is great okay would k equals three work as if k is greater than two that's an interesting um okay right so i don't need these curlies that's i don't need these curlies um this can also be two j right okay now question is i mean one thing i could do is get rid of the rainbow color like i don't need to have color mode and then i could also get rid of the stroke like that's gonna save me a lot of characters um could i would no i guess having i need to write a swap would a swap function really save me that much oops uhoh oh no it's working would a swap function if not k okay that's good so the swap function could i write a function hmm okay k is greater than two i like that okay save myself i need a lot more just get down to fewer characters uh i mean i guess maybe i should get rid of color mode i didn't want to but i think i might have to get rid of the color mode right hmm right because if i get rid of that i can always bring it back right let's get rid of color mode sad oh uh okay we're back to just sort of this plane uh i don't know how to get to david's comment to remove it okay hold on this will give me a second here uh okay where is david's pin comment there it is okay all right so that's working um how we doing people oh this is good now just out of curiosity does it oh i save characters when it's on one line wow so that's going to make a huge difference when i eventually get to that point so i didn't realize that instead of curiosity here how what am i really working with here getting close people you know what i don't oh i just realized something i just realized there's a fundamental thing that i could change i don't need to write a loop i don't need to save the values in an array i can oh boy i did that because i was technically doing it where i wanted to be able to draw the entire thing but i can just bear with me for a second right if i get rid of this i don't need that clear it's drawing over itself but i i don't believe that i need this array i just need the current point and the previous point to draw a line hold on uh all right so let me save this because i'm going to do something radical here duplicate i'm going to do something radical here i don't need this array i don't need this loop i do need a variable i and i don't need c i is c what i'm saying is i is h i b is i already used did i use a here i'm so confused um okay so look look just give me a second here v1 is hi v2 is h i plus one right p is not defined line four um i guess i need to add these in but this is this is that's this is all shortenable then okay oh this is going to make a huge difference so i need a and b well actually i just need b so if the problem is what am i using a for here equals t index k what oh yeah yeah that's fine um so i need two points i need a let's call it a b c d i'm going to use e and f e and f or e f g h i i and j j and k i'm already using those somewhere else m n m n that's perfect m equals this then n equals m so n is not defined yet let me just define it as something very briefly okay all right so that works how do i get it so that it's do i really have to define it as something that's kind of irritating no all right let's see what i'm working with here oh okay i'm i'm doing quite well here i equals n equals zero thank you i hate that i'm getting this like warning thing but i'll live with that okay so now else can i do use draw as your loop exactly okay so now let's see if i put this in here can i just by getting rid of all the line breaks get myself there there's still a lot i don't have 50. can't tell where the line breaks are now but again i still have a lot more to do i'm just trying to think if this can be reduced most like do i maybe i don't need maybe i don't need create vector the dot x though is so much like right a equals t there's got to be a way to do this without create vector um ah okay i like that um this is a good suggestion from mika i can put v equals create vector into draw that way i can get rid of these i guess if i want to keep the line breaks i could lose the semicolons so that helps a little bit there's some kind of object restructuring i could do like no i'm looking for more suggestions because it's a square put 512 in a variable is that really going to save me characters though oh i see that's a way to do it hmm okay line ten and you could swap by saying a b equals b a can i really do that hmm um yeah so i could so one way for me to just know how many characters i actually have is get rid of these semicolons am i still good here yeah um this will just help me sort of see what's going on 50 hey didn't i have it better than 51. combine lines 22 and 24 i see oh that was a really good one uh that was from um that was from andrew garvin interesting how many characters did that save me okay down to 46. oh this is really hard okay i just want to like what am i down to now 37 people oh v a equals v a y dot a x that is super interesting so this is this is a really interesting one that david has just suggested for the swap so here t equals ax a x equals a y yeah a equals v a dot y a dot x yeah wow that was huge that was huge we're down to 28. can i do that with this last one i should be able to a equals this comma this and then i don't need oh boy i messed something up all right how do i do this last one a equals v this is a dot x and this is a dot y just for a second here separate this out okay all right that's good then get rid of these get rid of this oh now we're cooking with gas here okay i think could this possibly have done it oh my god so close to fitting into a tweet now we're way beyond my goal is no longer to get this into 256 i'm just trying to get this into a tweet so that'll might be my goal move line 15 k equals 2 to 20 and rename to else i'm not sure if i'm behind okay all right so let's look at this all right what else could i do um okay so this is save this could save me a character um this anywhere there's a bracket it's no yeah that has to be a new line okay um this looks so short by the way um i've lost david's message to unpin it um all right let's see rename if k is greater than 2 to else ah does that really save me some characters no no no no i can't use else because i can't use because i got rid of all the other i can't do that that was a great idea though uh if k equals one yeah um i do like what i'm getting line four h i plus plus remove line six huh i never understand how that works but i'll take it that's awesome line 15 remove negative one and plus one those aren't oh negative one i replace i equals this so this is one that mika is saying with just shifting it ah yeah okay wow thank you mika that was a good one yeah slightly annoyed you can't pass two vectors to line uh okay how we doing how we doing this those are some good improvements 14 characters just 14 characters more this to me feels like there's got to be something i can do with this i divide equal four is that what the bit shifting is line four scale eight oh interesting would that really help but it's afternoon now okay hold on scale scale i don't think that that's really saving me any characters though with line eight hmm create canvas into draw and delete setup no that's not gonna work because i can't call createcanvas over and over oh you mean the whole thing just scale eight would that actually work so that does work but my line thickness is way out of whack now so i'd have to do like a stroke weight right i'd have to add stroke weight of like point two or something like that works but now i've added a bazillion characters so it's a good idea so youfu unfortunately so some of the the way i'm looking at the chat right now with the this stream chat is i'm like way when you post a link to a discord message previous message i don't know what that is plus plus j plus plus j where would that go with line eight i don't know what any of those suggestions are maybe line eight j plus pl oh like this that didn't work j equals one plus plus j is that that didn't work hold on did i mess something else up no yeah i like this idea but oh i froze froze ah come on come back oh no oh no come back plus j plus at least screenshot this we're gonna get this people uh line 14 i have plus l and negative l l minus one oh yeah look at this those cancel each other out right no l no no no two out can i do two times l that doesn't really save me any characters also what did i just do oh oh line 12 if k equals 1 8 why is it like sometimes it's like freaking out and but that didn't save me any characters uh v i know that's what i was thinking instead of create vector but you're double incrementing no plus plus j at the end no i took that out i saved the sketch by the way line ten l equals two star star admit it in line eight i don't understand that v00 can be replaced with that's a good one oh that's a good one all right thank you uh to i've done that uh marion who said v zero zero j equals zero plus plus j i just don't understand if you remove create canvas q equals 5 12 and then okay oh i mean just use the default cam no i kind of want it to be bigger i mean that's an interesting idea like to just not even use create canvas right if i don't use create canvas right it makes a 100 by 100 canvas so i could scale the thing down very like but that's let's let's hold off on that let's hold off on that people are saying huh that really worked okay where am i now we have nine characters left to go okay replace twelve and thirteen oh i could use it a ternary on 12 and 13 okay let's try this says 60 replace 12 and 13 with k equals 1 then if that's true a dot y plus equal l oh you mean i could just use the only the question mark like this will work well if that's true that's huge i might be able to get my color back in here no hmm oh oh i see i can do this like that oh that's so weird i have no idea what this is like sorcery here no okay i don't understand what i just did if k is 1 do this otherwise if k is 2 do this otherwise just like i put a 0 in there for doing nothing um thank you 60 for that but could i even keep going with this and do this now but this might have gotten me enough characters still need five more okay i still need five more i still need five more ternary operators ternary operators that's so could i do one more ternary by putting this here now and then okay down to 2002 oh my god this is insane line 10 remove j plus plus line 10 add plus plus when i don't need the greater than two now because it's just the only other possibility oh whoops just did something awful no ah okay right so like if this is true do this otherwise if this is true do this otherwise can't i don't need to even check this shouldn't i just be able to say really feel like you should be able to do that no oh because of this all right i need to bet i need to keep going with the ternaries so not k do this otherwise this and then oh my god and then i don't even think i need this last one right no it wants one more or do i can i get rid of that no oh hey i fit it into a tweet oh my god put a as a global variable don't return a oh that's interesting put a as a global variable then i don't even need return a is that oh true of undefined oh no oh but then i would have to say did this actually save me characters it's working does this save me characters yeah i can i can put a hashtag in there now okay amazing but i still feel like i've got extra stuff here that i don't need i'm so lost not k do this or not one do this otherwise to do this otherwise i guess i do need it because i need to oh unless i get rid of this so come on i need more space people need more space think now ah come on give me some space there thank you another curly bracket okay now i've got the turnery thing all set oh my god save save i've got 11 characters left i might be able to get my colors back line 10 is unnecessary k is already set i don't think that's true i don't think that's true yeah no no that's definitely necessary remove yeah okay line seven remove the line break got it there's another one no whoa whoa no i have to have it because it's a function definition i don't know why i can do this that'll work i am going to put semicolons in and remove all the line breaks when i'm done get rid of setup by doing if not i create canvas yeah no unfortunately p5 needs to have the setup function you don't need j plus plus in line 9 if you do plus plus in a line 11. like this wait hold on let me save let me save save plus plus nope there we go yeah that's fascinating that saved me a character right yep so can i get this to 256 that's the question [Laughter] line eight a equals i modulus 3 and remove line 10. a equals t i modulus so unfortunately the youtube chat is too fast for me to follow imodulus3 is that all that that is doing with the bit shifting there the ampersand no i like that okay that's pretty cool looking though nope oh wait oh why do i have this here oh because i do it once that's weird wait wait wait this has got to be why do i can't i just make this zero and then get rid of this no that seems like something i could do right why do i have this extra it's gonna be the same oh i see and then i looped through there was no setup in the train tree example really i can do this without setup line eight uh t equals hold on let me try to hmm there's an implied empty setup if you don't have it oh says chris okay i don't understand oh you mean just do it in draw do it in draw i see oh i get it i didn't understand that that is wild 15 wait what do i need to get to 256 uh 280 minus 256 i need to have 24 characters well now i'm really determined to get to 256. is t only used for a equals t index k it totally is yeah i didn't need that that's a huge extra thing hmm initialize j in the first line no because it's got to be reinitialized every time oh i see what you mean no yeah it's got to be reinitialized every time q512q line two can i do this silly thing again this okay so close i or i or create canvas yeah that's even better there are so many okay i've got it line okay let's let's see kobe says line eight can be h equals i ah yes okay so this is a really good one i understand this now this i can just look at i don't need a separate variable a equals the index into this array that is at i and three did i get that right yeah okay okay that's good oh my god uh um can i go with v i don't think so let's find out yeah it's not that's a syntax error oh what did i do oh what did i do oh it's 11 yeah sorry okay all right um thank you kobe for that one uh let's see did i get it to 256 characters oh now i don't know anymore okay it's not even showing me it's i have so much room left that's not even telling me how many characters i have left one two three four five six twenty oh yeah i think i did it i think this is 256. okay hold on how do i count characters that's 254 characters okay all right let's add i want to i i prefer for it to be on one line so let me hit save the other thing is why not go for a higher n like why not make this a bit more detailed like for example if i've already like lost track of where i started with this by the way in case you're just tuning in right now um and it's still working um i wanna like this was the original code um and i started with an order of six so if i made order eight like i'm just curious if i change the order back to eight where does what is that effect it makes instead of this being 64. i don't even know where those numbers went to like lost my mind here is it really just a matter of how many oh i'm not even doing that anymore because oh it's gonna crash at the end it's gonna crash at the end or will it just go back over itself right because the length is all that matters now right if the length is like if i do this it's gonna go forever right let's let this run for a little bit i mean i could do this just for fun i saved so much space i could make it rainbow color again k equals i eight does that work if i somehow do this no i can write v oh this one nope uh inside the indexing yeah i don't know how to do that do colors hold on the nicos musics this is like crazy to me i don't understand this one if people who are in discord can pull in some of the um interesting suggestions move line 11 into the for loop increment is that the only thing i'm using j for i don't i don't that hurts my brain oh there's this one yeah there we go thank you v1 it'll replace the second argument automatically there we go that's a good one line 12 k equals 1 to k is less than 2. that's another one okay define k equals i mu and use it in line eight no because i still would need to have it here because i is changing but there's probably a way i could say k equals i divide equal four boy this is there's okay here's the suggestion from nico this one i wanted to look at a equals v of i modulus 3 oh my god i don't understand this at all i'm fascinated by this though so let's just think about this here a equals v of could i actually figure out what should go here based off of this by saying well let me just type this out i don't understand it but let me type it out and maybe that'll help me understand it v of i modulus 3 because it's 0 0 1 1. that makes sense zero zero one one bit shift one okay so it's zero zero one zero zero one one will this get me zero zero one one whatever i is and then the next one is 0 1 0 1 1 0 index i modulus three i didn't get that right does this do i mean for this to be this yeah that's not modulus the ampersand oh i really got off the rails here now uhoh why is this so nice happen to me i don't know why that happened sometimes the web editor just freezes up okay i think i have to stop soon this is pretty good oh camera died the camera's not plugged in oh the camera died oh my god bye camera how did that happen this whole time the camera's been going on batteries don't worry everyone i have a solution to this problem it's called a plug uh although this might be a sign that i just have to stop all right nope this is an ethernet cable it's not gonna be any good what i'm looking for is my where did that plug go i didn't notice this was happening i had a cable here oh this is the saddest thing that ever happened i just literally had a usbc cable which is what i'm looking for actually what i need is a um you need that cable if i unplug my microphone like oh there's there's the cable i'm looking for you can't see what i'm doing but i'm plugging in this camera to power usbc goes right here why does this keep getting plug i blame my children you can fit in there usbc cable your usbc port your usbc cable there we go now i just need a other end to plug it into something right i'm going to unplug my laptop for a second and plug it into that hopefully this doesn't fry the camera let's see charge charge charge up my friend camera camera should be back okay should be back all right i think i have to be done make q64 i know but i think i actually want to go back to 512 because technically speaking um it's going to um let's record it it's going to take a very long time but 512 by 5 12. but i think it'll be fun to have oh oh it's not going it's going to take longer this thing only records for 30 seconds all right so i'm going to need to do a quick time screen capture let's quit this um finishing up folks hello i'm gonna be done will you just play like a drum thing for me i don't know give me a beat will you give me a beat well it's about to get very loud in here i'll turn down the gain on the mic okay ready give me a beat oh it's going over it again that was good um all right i have to finish up oh my god it's almost like one o'clock oh my god wait why is it going over it again because of this um line eight oh remove the multiply right if these oh my god i'm losing my mind k equals two to k okay hold on in line five just add two why did this not go on to the next i guess i'm missing something critical here that's fine let's just make it a 256 by 256 thing i have to stop i don't even know where i am when all of my chats replace all ternary operators with immediate array god this is crazy uh turn a equals oh i can't i have to stop i hadn't restarted the sketch oh is that why i don't think so all right my my brain is completely has completely died five i have to stop i'm being i can't believe i went this one this was like so fun but it's kind of like off the rails now okay let's just see what happens camera died again [Laughter] um all right let me let it let me let it charge up a little bit more so i'm i'm gonna be just not on camera for a little bit yeah what did i do wrong for it not to do the full 512 by 512. is it this six here needs to be like for example oh how can i how do i tell to record chord okay um so if i go back to the original code order is eight n is two to the eighth power which is 256. that's how far it's at length is width divided by 256 but that shouldn't matter like if i go back to the original code like i wanted to do this over the whole thing and what did i do differently add colors i think i have to come back i'll have to come back to this another time but i'm trying to i'm trying to understand to the j j is less than order ah there we go i see what i've confused so yeah i just need to increase that that's all i know you can't see me i'm i'm enjoying the fact that you can't see me right now i'm letting the camera charge up a little bit because it clearly can't be charging and so there are probably still ways that i could reduce the number of characters um getting some good suggestions in the chat um and but i just want to see if this moves on to the next section which is very unnecessary but i must know there we go okay yeah okay so i have it calibrated correctly now am i actually recording the screen here hit stop oh i was okay so let me delete this and then i could i'm going to speed this up new screen recording there we go stop record stop and here we go all right i'm gonna let this go uh and then i'm gonna be done uh who who wants to help me uh quickly uh speed up this video so i guess i could i could make it long is it recording my audio am i talking throughout this whole thing oh that's going to irritate me so much now we're trying to get the color back um well let me at least finish recording this i'm sorry that i didn't do any community contributions today i i got obsessed with this i should have just let it do the um i guess i could record this later maybe i'll post this tweet after the stream um so i don't have to sit here and wait for it to do the whole thing it's going to take a very long time use ffmpeg that's a good point um yeah so this is by the way this goes against everything i stand for in terms of programming you know the i this was like a fun challenge to explore but you know my whole ethos is to write the code in as long winded away as possible um so i can't really increase the frame rate in the way that i'm doing it here but i see that i can use people are giving me great suggestions like marcos here's i use ffmpeg a lot i guess i should let this finish now that i have it started um the problem is i'm screen recording so i can't check anything can somebody check how many characters i have currently um and if someone wants to check how many characters i have currently i could consider if i could get just stroke back i would need color mode hsb stroke i should really do this after the stream but i like i'm a completionist you know we've got uh oh i don't have the um hold on i don't have the overlay here just stream shot overlay in the view i'm looking at 248 characters bruno says it's a good example to show why people should not do it this way i agree so i don't think i can get color and stay within 256 characters i could stay within the tweet though so i'll do a second one with color because i agree um that would be nice i still think that um this one this comment from la culotte on youtube so i i realized that some people are saying that people are posting suggestions when other people are copy pasting their suggestions so i'm not sure if this is the correct attribution and there is also getting a suggestion for how to rewrite the for loop to remove the curly brackets and the line breaks which i'm looking at um but i think i'm going to leave it um i think i'm going to leave it as is right now it's so close to finishing all right i think i'm about to reappear there i am all aglow let the lights adjust so close here okay awkwardly go up here and hit stop great so now i'm going to save this um okay save this all right i'm wrapping up people at export to hilbert one desktop hilbert let's call this black and white desktop okay all right so that's good now let's just briefly see if i can get the color back and stay within 280 characters so how did i have color i know i need to add that's probably enough that's i lost my i'm still within a tweet i have 15 characters to add color and then the original way i had color was having q b i map from the entire length which is path.length is the total number of points which is 2 to the 8th squared so let's just try for a second um stroke i divided by um so 300 i divided by two to the eighth is 256. so that's that am i is that that how do i do something squared like this yeah yeah oh no no this is gonna get me color i think right it's the same thing right i can't tell if the color's actually changing i don't think that it is hmm it's so hard to tell because but i'm thinking i think it is oh and it's working it's just really slow it's change the color is changing it's changing color did i map the hue fully i'm not 100 sure and does this fit into a tweet uh i'm over by seven characters i'm over by seven characters do i need these parentheses so i currently can't really i could increase the speed but not with the way that i've written this um spectral piano says they have 273 characters what did i miss that you got spectral piano line five yeah i i think i can get rid of these two parentheses so i guess is there a way i can just for testing purposes increase the speed i should be able to say right am i using n somewhere i'm not using you oh whoops okay that's just temporarily increasing the speed um okay oh boy i've unplugged things everything is dying and also is this that's not right did i get the few full hsb yeah that's right that's whoa yeah i don't know i guess i was off by two i don't know why just make sure yeah okay i mean it's it's interesting to have it repeat but okay so that should be 14 here i'm not i'm i'm not going to question that um then um and also kind of want this oh okay okay let's not so i could let's not get too picky here people um what was i doing uh i wait right right now can i get rid of this that's two characters less okay yes um i'm so close to being done now let me just run this make sure it's still working oh i've messed everything up what have i done oh help me line 14. i need another curly bracket maybe there we go okay uh does this not fit in my tweet five characters i need to remove five characters from this one more for semicolon in line 14. there's i've gotten good suggestions replace 2 to the 14 with 4 to the 7 okay that's good now i am at i need four four more characters people four more characters to remove instead of x to a equals okay i don't understand that one don't line 14 k is less than two don't understand that one a okay line eight says spectral piano okay can someone grab spectral pianos um uh message equals two with less than three i've already done that i've already done that they need spectral pianos comment i i okay can't capture them i can't capture them it's too fast someone's got to capture it for me thank you okay oh all right line eight it's not line eight anymore well let's look at this a equals v i ampersand two times two oh is this gonna get this is just gonna give me ah i see zero four four zero uh right then i don't need the multiplier is that what's going on here i'm trying to figure out how to get rid of the multiplier uh oh my monitor died okay everything's falling apart i can't see anything anymore what happened there i should have known that it was telling me that there we go okay uh right i should this looks right it's just tiny so i should be able to say four times this right no oh no four times this no i'm very stubborn so this i like what you're doing here this makes sense this would be 0 4 4 and then maybe i can just the multiplying can happen here and then i can just do the add here right no how come that doesn't work oh my god people are really i don't think you understand what's happening to me okay hold on all right chris ray has a really interesting suggestion this whole thing can be replaced with i am sand 1 to the i ampersand 2 power i don't believe that fascinating that is not right though i'm getting a very interesting pattern there of not k a a equals not k or v and omit the a equals in between okay a equals not k or v but that doesn't really help me at all well i've got to get back to what i had i don't understand that i'm lost i'm completely lost why don't you need to move line 12 to line seven i don't understand that at all yeah uh i i believe in this solution but i don't understand it um color mode three oh oh that's genius no the hsb constant is something but it's not three i think it stands for a string actually unfortunately can't remove the mult or the ad yeah i agree okay people i think i might have to give up is this my best oh i'll gain the character in between here okay um um so close line six remove the second two from add oh will that work oh that's a good one that's a good one okay i just need two more characters this can be done right two more characters nope really doesn't want to give me any defaults for hsb i and oh this this is a good i yeah i've been trying this i agree that that should work no there should be a way for me to get 0 1 1 0 that sequence but i'm not sure how the suggestions that i've gotten don't seem to work um line 10 remove the last item on the list says marcos i really don't need that zero that's amazing it'll default that's amazing that is totally amazing replace line 10 replace this with times two yeah no that is cool looking though uh what did i do it ah we did it we did it it fits okay hold on okay everybody save duplicate i'm signing off folks what is going on here okay there we go is it gonna let me put an image with this that's the sad thing but it will okay okay well okay i'm i've got to go everybody it's so sad how like i'm so like hours and hours beyond where i meant to be that i have to just like race off this live stream without having a nice wrapup moment um but um i really appreciate everyone's help with this oh i could do ad l that's another one that should work thank you it's another one i didn't see oh no that didn't work it didn't work i don't know why that didn't work but that is not it does that did not allow it did not work okay i'm sorry everybody i really have to go um and i uh i didn't think we need a song to celebrate but i'm just going to play with this dot song so i didn't do communica i got this is what happens in all of my live streams i hope you enjoyed this um i'm going to in a little bit like tweet that i'm going to capture the hilbert curve thing and then i'm going to actually tweet this so i hope you will uh see that and retweet it and enjoy it but i'm just going to play the this dots on as always i always forget that say goodbye and say thank you stay tuned for some afternoon videos coming out next week and some more live streams in december and i'll see you all all right goodbye this dot i'm going to do this this star this dot this dot this dot song never forget the this dot somebody composed that song for me see you all i'm sorry i'm just shutting this down shut this down the tweet's gonna come out soon though
