01:40 - approximately one minute
01:42 - and six seconds let me know in the chat
01:44 - if you can hear the audio just fine this
01:46 - is
01:47 - not your usual coding live stream
01:50 - tonight this is a
01:51 - broadcast of the itp ima
01:55 - lo-res at nyu tisch school of the arts
01:58 - spring 2021 show so i'll explain more
02:00 - about that once i get started
02:13 - [Music]
02:52 - sorry about that one more minute until i
02:55 - get started one more song here to play
03:04 - [Music]

03:54 - hello and happy tuesday evening
03:57 - i'm here at my desk prepare to broadcast
04:01 - the news no
04:02 - not the news i'm actually here to
04:04 - broadcast the itp
04:06 - ima low res spring show
04:09 - of 2021 a festival of the recently
04:13 - possible now
04:15 - here's the thing typically
04:18 - um in the past if you've ever seen one
04:21 - of my
04:22 - biannual it's biannual twice a year or
04:24 - every other year
04:25 - you let me know in the chat but twice a
04:28 - year i will broadcast
04:30 - uh the show of the wonderful students
04:33 - from the itp
04:34 - ima and now low res program at tisch
04:36 - school of the arts new york university
04:38 - located right here where i
04:39 - am sitting in brooklyn new york
04:41 - typically this is a live
04:43 - in-person show and i'm wandering around
04:44 - with a mobile camera trying to
04:47 - somehow like do all of my internet wi-fi
04:50 - dances properly so that the stream can
04:52 - broadcast
04:54 - but um here we are once again uh now i
04:56 - think this is the third time
04:59 - that the itp ima lores show is
05:04 - online but it's pretty different today
05:07 - so
05:08 - what i'm doing right now is is kind of
05:10 - in some sense useless
05:12 - because what i really would much prefer
05:15 - that you do i would you know
05:16 - you're not supposed to say this when
05:18 - you're live streaming or making a video
05:19 - but turn this off
05:21 - and go and to
05:24 - and join the show yourself so i need to
05:26 - figure out um
05:28 - i'm going i think if i take this link no
05:30 - i'm in the wrong place ah
05:32 - no i'm good no wrong yes i think i can
05:34 - do this
05:36 - sorry i'm about to put into the chat um
05:40 - and hopefully you're not gonna hear this
05:42 - good i'm about to paste into the chat
05:44 - the link to the show itself i'm typing
05:48 - this now
05:49 - you're actually seeing this
05:52 - like way before you're gonna hear me say
05:54 - this because of the way the delay is i
05:56 - don't know what's the future what's the
05:58 - past
05:58 - but that's the actual link that you can
06:00 - go and join the show
06:02 - yourself i'm actually going to also edit
06:04 - the video
06:07 - and just go to the video description and
06:10 - paste the link now
06:12 - in the video description i'm going to
06:13 - hit save
06:15 - so if you were to refresh the page that
06:18 - you're on um
06:20 - in addition to seeing the link in the
06:21 - chat um
06:23 - and i don't know youtube is like yelling
06:25 - at me like it's not
06:26 - it's got an error but let's see if this
06:28 - worked yes so now in this video's
06:31 - description
06:32 - is the link to the actual show itself so
06:35 - in just a moment
06:36 - i'm going to go in there myself
06:39 - and show you how it all works where you
06:42 - can find the project where you can chat
06:44 - with the creators of the project
06:45 - then i will continue to stream and
06:47 - wander around but you could
06:48 - experience this stream in your own way
06:51 - just by being in the show itself i'm
06:53 - just
06:53 - checking out the chat um saying hello to
06:56 - tom
06:57 - g who says hello saying hello to wucha
06:59 - and thomas
07:00 - smith and gregor biennial versus
07:05 - biannual
07:06 - biennial like the venice biennale is
07:09 - every two years
07:10 - by annual every six months i really hope
07:14 - i can remember that
07:15 - in the future because i would love to be
07:17 - able to
07:18 - call upon that knowledge when needed
07:20 - because i
07:21 - is there an equivalent for bi-weekly
07:24 - is there by weekly
07:28 - by bi-monthly by i don't know
07:31 - carson is here hey all right so um let's
07:35 - throw caution to the wind
07:37 - and just get started with what um i
07:40 - don't know i don't have a lot of other
07:41 - stuff to say i could talk about
07:43 - you know coding train news and updates
07:45 - there will be a regularly scheduled live
07:47 - stream
07:47 - this thursday but i'm going to switch
07:49 - over here and
07:51 - i am now uh in uh
07:54 - spatial chat itself so uh if you might
07:57 - remember that last time i live streamed
07:59 - a
07:59 - uh online version of the itbiamalorez
08:01 - show we were using something called
08:03 - yorb um without by accident going into
08:08 - oh wait i can hear somebody
08:11 - i thought the oh oh
08:15 - oh oh i thought that the microphones
08:18 - were disabled in this room
08:20 - but i guess if you're a host it's not
08:23 - i've i've stopped i've muted the audio
08:26 - so you can't hear it i gotta go i gotta
08:28 - i gotta go to a different welcome room
08:30 - this is too destructive wait no i can do
08:31 - this
08:32 - great all right here we are yorb
08:35 - was a 3d world created by
08:38 - um a bunch of developers and artists and
08:42 - students and
08:43 - researchers at the itb program itself
08:45 - spatial chat
08:46 - from what i understand is a third party
08:49 - commercial system
08:50 - i think there's a way to use it for free
08:52 - but let's see if i can kind of like walk
08:54 - you through
08:55 - how spatial chat works
08:58 - so basically the way that it works is
09:01 - and you can see here this is um
09:03 - there's a whole bunch of rooms and soon
09:04 - i'm gonna start going into the rooms
09:06 - to view the various projects but we can
09:09 - look here
09:10 - and sort of see um how it works so audio
09:12 - and video is spatial so this is me right
09:14 - now
09:15 - i can move myself around notice how
09:17 - these other circles get larger and
09:19 - smaller
09:20 - if we were in a room where the audio and
09:22 - video was not disabled
09:24 - then we would see the video appear as we
09:26 - got closer and disappear as we got
09:28 - further
09:28 - the audio would get louder and quieter
09:30 - depending on our distance
09:32 - um the other thing we can note here is
09:35 - that each room has a theme
09:37 - six projects in each room each project
09:39 - has their own area labeled with the name
09:41 - and project title
09:42 - so this is what it's going to look like
09:44 - i wonder if i can zoom in any further on
09:46 - this
09:46 - i can do my own zoom so we're going to
09:48 - start to move around and find
09:50 - projects and there'll be videos being
09:52 - shared and there's the creators of the
09:53 - project will be there that i can
09:54 - interview and ask some questions
09:56 - um um you can see here you if you
10:00 - if you join right here's the url once
10:01 - again it's in the chat
10:03 - and i don't think i pinned it let me pin
10:05 - it in the chat
10:07 - and replace the pin message so now
10:08 - that's pinned
10:10 - you can find the url right there is
10:12 - anybody watching right now are any of
10:14 - you
10:15 - in welcome room a are these any of your
10:18 - circles floating around
10:20 - i would be excited and hello to grant
10:23 - from utah utah the time zone that this
10:26 - is meant for perhaps because i know
10:29 - a lot of the viewers that regular
10:30 - viewers of the coding train or in
10:32 - europe or asia and other parts of the
10:35 - world
10:36 - and plenty of other uh places that just
10:38 - are it's you know the middle of the
10:39 - night are quite late right now so
10:41 - thank you to anyone who happens to be
10:42 - tuning in let's see what else we can
10:44 - find out help and map
10:46 - um navigate the directory uh and desk
10:48 - for the project map you will also find
10:50 - helpers
10:51 - if you have questions or need support by
10:52 - the way
10:54 - uh let's see how many people do i have
10:56 - um vicky lou
10:57 - says that they are there let's see if we
10:59 - can find vicky this is where i am oh no
11:01 - no wait this is where i am
11:03 - vicki come over near here and let's see
11:06 - your icon now of course once i actually
11:08 - start guarding the rooms with audio and
11:09 - video i might not be so encouraging of
11:11 - you
11:12 - to come and interrupt but yeah you
11:14 - should you should come and say i'm just
11:15 - slightly afraid of the live broadcast
11:18 - aspect of doing this
11:20 - um is anybody from itp ima or lores
11:23 - watching this right now
11:24 - if you are say hi in the chat but really
11:26 - come on go into the spatial chat
11:28 - so i've been told that there's a limit
11:30 - of 500 people on the spatial chat
11:32 - and i um i kind of have a personal
11:35 - mission to see if we can
11:36 - get it above 500. i can see right now
11:39 - there are 89 people watching this
11:42 - stream or um which is um
11:45 - a wonderful amazing number of people if
11:48 - i'm being honest but also a little bit
11:49 - lower than
11:50 - i usually will have for a live stream
11:52 - probably the time
11:53 - uh is a little bit of a barrier there
11:55 - for a lot of people but
11:56 - um wessie is there um and maybe this is
11:59 - oh that's wesley
12:01 - um and i i don't know where did i go
12:04 - here i am
12:04 - so all right so let's go we're now in
12:06 - welcome room hey i gotta ease my way in
12:08 - i mean welcome room a i'm gonna ease my
12:11 - way in
12:13 - and um uh yes and i see also just
12:17 - just to respond to carson in the chat
12:19 - who writes i really
12:21 - should be doing college right now what
12:22 - does it mean to do college by the way i
12:24 - would like to do
12:25 - college that sounds like fun i did i did
12:27 - college once upon a time many moons ago
12:30 - oh boy i'm old okay i really should be
12:33 - doing college right now but maybe i
12:34 - could watch your streams more during the
12:35 - summer
12:36 - yes first of all take care of yourself
12:39 - take care of your own well-being drink
12:42 - water
12:43 - rest take care of your work study be
12:46 - with your friends and family and loved
12:47 - ones
12:48 - and then if you happen to have a little
12:50 - bit of extra time left over you could
12:52 - join a coding train stream
12:53 - that's what i would say that should be
12:54 - your priority list um
12:56 - and algeria is in the house zach from
12:59 - algeria
13:00 - and uh christopher chenier all right
13:02 - we're getting some announcements
13:04 - actually
13:04 - let's tune into these announcements
13:08 - the the projects in those rooms i
13:10 - believe there's
13:11 - just a little bit of a check of the
13:13 - audio do you hear both
13:14 - of the announcements that's going on and
13:16 - me and then to navigate you can actually
13:19 - move your bubble around
13:22 - um the closer you get to somebody the
13:24 - louder
13:25 - the sound is it's almost as if i'm
13:27 - actually sitting in these seats
13:28 - um and then you can also move this if
13:32 - you click on the background
13:44 - marvel give me a call look at these
13:46 - special effects i've got going and if
13:48 - you want to unmute if you have any
13:49 - questions feel free to unmute yourself
13:51 - as well
13:54 - okay we're going to welcome room b right
13:56 - now and i'm going to mute the
13:58 - spatial uh chat audio all right when
14:01 - welcome room b oh i guess the welcome
14:03 - rooms all have the same thing
14:05 - welcome room c i somehow i imagine the
14:07 - welcome rooms had different images
14:09 - um so okay maybe
14:12 - maybe just maybe we're ready
14:16 - to go into directory
14:19 - and info desk
14:23 - oh i played a sound effect and you
14:24 - didn't hear it okay let's try this again
14:26 - maybe just maybe i feel
14:30 - ready everyone oh oh we've got more now
14:32 - to the show
14:35 - you're looking if you're a little
14:36 - confused on how to navigate let me go
14:38 - back to this room okay hold on
14:40 - welcome roommate okay inside the column
14:43 - all right let me welcome room b
14:44 - now maybe come on i have a bit to do
14:47 - here
14:48 - maybe we feel ready now to go into the
14:51 - directory
14:52 - and info desk right shall we do it
14:58 - what do you all think what do you think
15:02 - what do you think all right i'm going to
15:04 - mute the audio
15:06 - of i'm like very afraid oh wait
15:09 - look i everybody knows
15:12 - i just i don't love the idea of like
15:15 - broadcasting
15:16 - this space without people's consent and
15:19 - so
15:20 - um you know i'm going to be very mindful
15:22 - of that i mean this is a public
15:24 - online space so people are hopefully
15:27 - just generally aware that they are being
15:29 - watched and could be recorded but the
15:31 - students are aware that i'm going to be
15:32 - visiting their project
15:34 - and i've also prepared a sign to appear
15:36 - on my face that says live broadcast
15:38 - so here we go uh twirling
15:42 - tech goddess is in the house and i
15:45 - really
15:46 - there's just no way that you could
15:48 - possibly be referring to my hair
15:51 - i don't think any i'm just gonna
15:55 - got to be somebody else right because i
15:57 - know it's getting a little bit
15:58 - long and i've got my little streak of
16:00 - gray and eventually
16:01 - hopefully if it stays it will be all
16:03 - silver at some point and
16:05 - i'm very excited for those days if i'm
16:06 - still a person who's doing things on
16:08 - youtube
16:10 - you will appreciate this twirling tech
16:11 - god goddess because my t-shirt says
16:13 - don't hate
16:15 - wait hold i gotta go to this view don't
16:17 - hate
16:18 - roller skate all right
16:21 - um where am i here i am all right now
16:24 - we're going into the directory and info
16:27 - desk it's like 8 15 i haven't looked at
16:28 - a project yet
16:30 - okay uh here we go directory and info
16:33 - desk
16:34 - here we are i'm going to turn on my
16:36 - camera
16:38 - here i am i'm going to go to the corner
16:40 - just for a second to be
16:41 - by myself i'm turning on my mic and then
16:44 - i'm going to zoom in
16:46 - and this is me see this is my now
16:49 - i'm seeing it mirrored because um
16:52 - spatial chat wants to show me my image
16:55 - mirrored which makes a lot of sense
16:56 - by the way this camera that you're
16:58 - seeing here right now is the different
17:00 - than this camera right like i can cover
17:01 - my camera
17:02 - the camera that's in spatial chat is the
17:04 - camera that's on my
17:06 - laptop but where i'm broadcasting this
17:08 - from open broadcast studio is
17:10 - this camera over there hi this camera
17:12 - over there
17:14 - camera one i only have one camera
17:16 - someday i'll have more than one camera
17:18 - so i can do the bit where i go
17:19 - camera two come on let's talk we gotta
17:22 - talk
17:22 - camera two but there's there's no camera
17:24 - two right now so i can't do that
17:26 - all right back to here so i think i can
17:28 - remove myself
17:30 - as i move around because this is me
17:32 - right here i am the live broadcast
17:35 - um and now we're in um let's see let's
17:38 - go uh
17:38 - let's go like if you have social anxiety
17:42 - this is really
17:43 - like i don't know if live streaming to
17:45 - the internet and weirdly it's like
17:47 - easier for me to do that than
17:49 - uh walk into a room full of people but
17:51 - um
17:52 - uh let's go wander over and say hi to
17:54 - some folks
17:56 - oh hello i'm a live broadcast
18:00 - everybody be careful hi hello
18:03 - well hello shipping oh this is the let's
18:05 - see is the audio the audio is going
18:07 - through
18:07 - to my live broadcast i've got my sign
18:10 - that says i'm a live broadcast
18:12 - so everybody knows everybody's okay
18:15 - we've got a chat going
18:17 - mostly people are joining the live
18:19 - broadcast and then i'm steering them
18:20 - here so if you are watching
18:22 - the live broadcast right now here is
18:24 - your link right here on the screen
18:27 - chat slash s slash spring show 2021
18:31 - you could jump right in here and invade
18:33 - the live broadcast
18:35 - you know be kind
18:39 - uh how's everybody doing tonight this is
18:41 - like such a nice crew of folks
18:43 - i'm i'm i'm having like a just a very
18:46 - small
18:47 - minor fit of anxiety and panic here but
18:49 - it's everything
18:52 - as we circle you
18:56 - is there anything we can do to help no
18:58 - no no that's my
18:59 - that's my uh uh baseline so things are
19:02 - actually quite good
19:03 - um and i'm i'm okay and um i'm
19:07 - i'm slow like for a while i just spent
19:09 - the time in the welcome rooms
19:10 - where you couldn't um speak or hear
19:14 - other people
19:15 - and then now we changed that yeah oh oh
19:18 - that was nice though it was a good way
19:19 - to ease into spatial chat
19:21 - so now i'm in the directory room and i
19:24 - i'm working up the courage
19:26 - to go to i think my first stop is going
19:28 - to be
19:29 - virtual reality
19:32 - you're brave dan you're so brave have
19:35 - fun
19:36 - thank you all right everyone
19:39 - i'm going to go over here so they don't
19:41 - have to hear me um
19:43 - i am now going ahead let's go look we're
19:46 - going to head over to
19:47 - vr where there are these um let's see
19:50 - how far can i zoom
19:52 - in um we're there and i
19:55 - i was meaning not to show people's names
19:56 - here um we're gonna head over to vr
19:59 - where we have these one two oh i'm
20:01 - pointing the wrong way
20:03 - i'm looking the whole reason why i don't
20:04 - have my video flipped
20:06 - is because i can look i guess i could go
20:08 - over here here we go this is very
20:09 - obviously this is like making all the
20:11 - difference in your viewing experience
20:13 - must point correctly uh ah
20:17 - julia ann myers is in the vr room i
20:20 - think the last time i think i've
20:21 - interacted with julia before but julia
20:23 - you are a low-res student at the itp ima
20:26 - lores
20:27 - program so many names and acronyms what
20:29 - does it all mean
20:31 - ask in the chat i'm happy to try to
20:32 - answer that um
20:34 - julia cyberspace three julia if it's all
20:37 - right with you
20:38 - let's head over to your project first
20:40 - because um
20:41 - yeah why not okay we're heading over to
20:43 - julia's project
20:45 - um so i'm going to the vr room
20:49 - and now i am i just got plopped in
20:52 - what is history it's many parallel
20:54 - streams of events
20:55 - which meet at certain points so why not
20:58 - create them as parallel structures that
21:00 - makes it easier to write easy
21:02 - to read so to me the computer was an
21:05 - opportunity to radically redefine
21:07 - the nature of writing this is a really
21:09 - cool movie
21:10 - okay can you hear me yeah i'm not sure
21:13 - if we're allowed to talk
21:15 - i got so much audio going on um
21:18 - yeah let me give you a little demo so
21:19 - this is a video in the middle but i'm
21:21 - going to open up this screen here
21:23 - um because this is the actual live demo
21:26 - and so you can visit the site so i've
21:27 - gotten basically last time you stream me
21:29 - my a-frame skills were
21:31 - very rudimentary um this is all a-frame
21:34 - this is uh
21:35 - yeah print out some more features so
21:38 - a-frame is a programming language
21:41 - yeah so a-frame is for writing or
21:42 - creating vr uh do you know 3js
21:45 - like the javascript library so it
21:48 - basically uses that library so you can
21:50 - create like a frame which is a
21:52 - like vr in the browser so like right now
21:54 - what you can see here
21:59 - okay so this is running in the browser
22:02 - right now so you can actually use this
22:03 - with
22:04 - uh a headset an oculus headset or just
22:06 - in the browser
22:08 - and um yeah so basically this time i
22:10 - experimented with like interaction
22:12 - and it's exploration of like pixels and
22:14 - screens and space and all that
22:17 - um so yeah it was really fun um
22:21 - i did a lot of work in after effects and
22:23 - a lot of this all this is is
22:24 - an a-frame though um again the loading
22:27 - times down was
22:28 - a miracle i'm getting some questions
22:31 - from some folks
22:32 - about what is a-frame could you could
22:34 - you give a quick
22:35 - like um high-level uh
22:38 - uh explanation of what a-frame is yeah
22:41 - sure so a-frame uh basically allows you
22:43 - to
22:44 - host vr in the browser so for a lot of
22:47 - your projects you have to have like an
22:48 - oculus or a headset
22:49 - and for this it makes a lot more
22:51 - accessible so anyone can like open up
22:53 - their browser even on your phone and
22:55 - stuff and like this is running yeah
22:57 - right now in chrome chrome is
22:58 - recommended
22:59 - um and you can have a whole vr project
23:01 - there and there's a lot of really cool
23:03 - uses for it
23:04 - um because you can basically have this
23:05 - kind of like 360
23:07 - ability to create in 360 for the web
23:10 - which i think is very cool
23:11 - um yeah and it so it works on time based
23:14 - so it's timed out in javascript so after
23:16 - like 30 seconds
23:17 - each room moves on yeah that's my little
23:19 - project so
23:20 - but a frame is very cool and a lot
23:22 - easier than you'd think it's all in html
23:24 - so
23:24 - um like inside html so i'd recommend
23:30 - oh wow okay so you wait so
23:33 - you make the a-frame is the language
23:36 - powered by 3js
23:37 - in html i i just started i mean
23:41 - just yeah it sounds kind of crazy yeah
23:43 - yeah
23:44 - but basically yeah basically you're
23:45 - working with like entities which are
23:47 - making kind of these 3d
23:48 - objects in a space
23:52 - but it's coded i don't think that
23:54 - they're saying it's like
23:56 - i'm just going to interrupt for a second
23:59 - here
24:00 - um and oh wait a sec uh
24:06 - sorry i meant to mute myself here and i
24:08 - muted myself in the wrong place i'm not
24:10 - interrupting here i'm interrupting
24:11 - someone else
24:13 - cook as you were all good yeah all right
24:16 - go ahead
24:21 - the wrong button again okay now we're
24:23 - all good i
24:24 - i i thought i was doing so well with the
24:26 - technology i've got like
24:28 - audio and multiple computers here and
24:31 - streaming i i just wanted to answer some
24:32 - of the questions in the chat because i
24:34 - think people are all confused about what
24:35 - you're watching
24:36 - so there is at this moment going on in
24:39 - uh in a in a shared space called spatial
24:42 - chat you can go to spatial dot chat
24:44 - s spring show 2021 link in the
24:47 - description and pinned in the chat
24:48 - the end of semester show for the itp ima
24:52 - and lo-res programs at nyu
24:54 - tisch school of the arts just wanted to
24:56 - reset the room here for a moment
24:57 - um julian is asking what does itp and
25:00 - ima stand for
25:02 - so itp stands for interactive
25:04 - telecommunications program it's a
25:05 - two-year master's program
25:07 - and ima stands for interactive media
25:09 - arts which is a a four-year bachelor's
25:12 - of fine arts it's an undergrad program
25:14 - so um hopefully i've linked to those
25:16 - programs in the video's description but
25:18 - if you go to itp.nyu.edu you'll find out
25:20 - there
25:21 - and so ultimately really this is just a
25:23 - a show that you can go and wander around
25:25 - and
25:26 - chat with students and see their
25:27 - projects in a virtual space normally
25:29 - this would be
25:30 - um physically an in-person show in
25:32 - brooklyn new york
25:33 - but um you know here we are
25:36 - in living in 2021 um
25:39 - and a global pandemic so the uh the the
25:42 - show is online for this semester
25:44 - spatial chat is a service that i have
25:47 - nothing to do with
25:48 - that it ima has nothing to do with it's
25:51 - a um
25:52 - like a browser-based multi-user chat
25:56 - video audio spatially oriented
25:59 - system i'm sure we could find out more
26:02 - about it if i looked on their about page
26:04 - um that the department is using for the
26:06 - show all right i'm gonna jump back
26:08 - into the show and listen to what julia
26:11 - is saying
26:14 - yeah and then you just type in the uh
26:17 - the name of my
26:18 - project but you can see it but
26:19 - unfortunately so the interaction i'm
26:21 - adding interaction for oculus controls
26:23 - in like the final version like my thesis
26:25 - is due in july so this is uh like very
26:28 - much a prototype still
26:29 - but so you will be able to interact with
26:31 - the boxes and stuff but you can like
26:32 - click but yeah
26:33 - that'll be final version so okay all
26:36 - right
26:37 - i can't wait i uh i i only you know i
26:39 - can't wait to try this out i'm like oh
26:41 - my gosh i just got in here
26:43 - yeah last night but uh is this going to
26:45 - be available like after 10 o'clock
26:48 - oh the website yeah yeah it will be up
26:50 - okay
26:59 - yeah thanks for stopping by this is
27:01 - great yeah no i'm glad
27:03 - this live broad what's the show called
27:06 - with the rainbows
27:07 - oh the coding train you gotta check it
27:09 - out when you
27:10 - start talking i was like okay it's great
27:13 - no i'm sorry about that i have like
27:15 - a million different controls for like
27:17 - live streams i have the audio
27:20 - from my live stream and i pressed the
27:22 - wrong button but actually julia
27:24 - what i did is actually people were
27:25 - asking a little confusion so i was like
27:27 - resetting the room a bit and i explained
27:29 - what itp and ima are
27:31 - but i didn't really say too much about
27:32 - the low res i don't want to take up too
27:34 - much of your time but
27:35 - yeah could you just talk about what the
27:37 - the low res program for 30 seconds
27:39 - what an electronic document what it's
27:41 - for or what are
27:42 - you know for one thing yeah what it's
27:44 - like for you your own experience
27:46 - yeah for sure yeah it's been really cool
27:48 - so this is like the first year of it so
27:49 - it's a brand new program
27:51 - but i think it's a great way of kind of
27:52 - meeting bridging the gap so it's only
27:54 - one year
27:55 - and you basically do every semester and
27:56 - it's been online from
27:58 - the intention is that you get to
27:59 - experience different campuses
28:02 - and um yeah i love because it's like uh
28:05 - interactive media arts it's also my
28:07 - undergrad major
28:08 - and so i feel like i got so into it
28:09 - that's why i love being able to kind of
28:11 - continue
28:12 - what i was doing and what i was looking
28:13 - into with the uh with the masters but
28:16 - yeah so it's one year
28:17 - i like that's very small you really like
28:19 - have great relationships with professors
28:20 - and all that
28:21 - and um but yeah uh
28:25 - awesome no that's true no no that's
28:26 - perfect that's really helpful
28:28 - yeah yeah and i will um put a link in
28:31 - the
28:32 - youtube chat and uh for people who are
28:34 - interested in finding out more about the
28:36 - program awesome thank you for being the
28:37 - guinea pig this is the first
28:38 - project that i stopped by so i'm gonna
28:40 - go wander around
28:41 - and find some other projects to look at
28:43 - thanks so much yeah have fun
28:45 - thanks for stopping by
28:49 - all right so i'm back to here um and i
28:51 - have someone walking around

28:55 - should be able to move around
28:57 - let's go back in i'm just going to move
29:00 - over here
29:01 - into spatial chat you can't see what i'm
29:03 - doing here i am i'm just moving over
29:05 - here where i don't see a lot of people
29:07 - so i can have a little bit of a break
29:09 - and figure out where i'm going to go
29:11 - next um so i i want to come back to the
29:14 - vr room if i can
29:15 - um because there are more um
29:19 - projects here actually let me see let me
29:21 - see if actually
29:22 - um looks like marianne is there
29:25 - let's see if we can stop by marianne's
29:27 - project um briefly so i'm going to
29:29 - switch
29:30 - to this view i'm going to unmute myself
29:34 - and now i'm going to move back over here
29:37 - and hello is anybody here anybody home
29:40 - hi yes hi how are you oh wait wait wait
29:43 - i
29:43 - messed up my audio buttons okay now i
29:45 - can hear
29:48 - hi dan i'm just saying hello oh yes um
29:50 - so i this is a live broadcast currently
29:52 - i'm mostly encouraging people to leave
29:54 - the live broadcast
29:55 - and enter spatial chat itself but i'm
29:58 - kind of just
29:58 - popping around and visiting projects do
30:00 - you have a minute to tell us about your
30:02 - project marianne sure is the um
30:05 - the trailer playing in the background
30:06 - like distracting oh
30:08 - well i it's not distracting because i
30:10 - don't hear audio from it
30:12 - so it's okay to see it on the screen
30:14 - sure okay
30:15 - um so my project is called root it is
30:19 - a immersive film and also a vr
30:22 - installation looking at race and
30:23 - representation
30:25 - in 3d digital media um it follows
30:28 - a character named yara and she goes
30:30 - through the she does this
30:31 - like hair journey going through these
30:34 - magical hair worlds where she likes
30:36 - and starts off in a straight air force
30:38 - and ends up in a curly hair world and
30:40 - is transformed so that's basically my
30:42 - project
30:44 - awesome and what's the um i'm sorry to
30:47 - ask such a question where
30:48 - because i'm so like such a vr kind of
30:51 - beginner
30:52 - or i don't know beginners maybe even two
30:54 - too strong what is your
30:56 - um is it for a particular platform if
30:58 - somebody wanted to
31:00 - um watch the film or experience it is
31:03 - that something that they can do
31:05 - now or in the future if they want to
31:06 - learn more about it
31:08 - um in the future i'll post it on the
31:10 - project page um
31:12 - i'm going to be taking the summer to
31:13 - actually complete it right now i just
31:15 - have the trailer and the
31:16 - the world setup and some of the the
31:18 - performance capture
31:20 - um ideally it would be an in-person
31:22 - installation where we'd scream the film
31:24 - and then
31:25 - check out the vr piece but i'm
31:26 - definitely going to be working on a
31:27 - web-based version
31:29 - so once that's out i will share that
31:31 - awesome fantastic
31:32 - so if people want to i see this is so
31:34 - kind of amazing by the way i love the
31:36 - way your
31:36 - area is organized and that you filled
31:38 - the chairs with wonderful little emojis
31:41 - which is awesome but i i mean it's i
31:43 - guess i'm speaking the obvious here but
31:45 - um everyone should take a look here you
31:47 - can see um
31:49 - in this pink square over here there's

32:07 - thank you have fun everybody thanks
32:13 - okay here i am oh
32:17 - actually i'm gonna i'm gonna move closer
32:18 - to your trailer because i realize when i

32:21 - so i'm gonna let it play oh yeah
33:50 - please let me know if you guys have any
33:51 - questions
33:57 - i have a little trouble navigating here
34:00 - oh my computer is like
34:01 - all of a sudden grinding to a halt here
34:03 - okay
34:04 - move over here um
34:07 - maybe i should mute myself in spatial
34:10 - chat for a moment so people don't hear
34:11 - me
34:11 - there we go i'm gonna bring myself back
34:13 - here okay
34:15 - so i am going to
34:18 - um move on to my sort of goal is to look
34:22 - at a couple projects on each page
34:24 - i'm gonna move to narrative and
34:26 - storytelling
34:27 - um and see if david is there for his
34:30 - a life's a boat project so here we go
34:34 - i'm clicking on narrative and
34:35 - storytelling oh just to reset the room
34:37 - again
34:38 - anybody's newly joined uh you don't need
34:40 - to be watching me
34:42 - i i appreciate it if you do that's
34:43 - wonderful maybe you maybe you prefer
34:45 - just being able to see somebody kind of
34:47 - wandering around through this show
34:49 - but i highly encourage you to just join
34:51 - yourself um
34:52 - you can just go right to this url in the
34:54 - browser and
34:56 - experience the different projects that
34:57 - are on display in different rooms
35:00 - and uh ask questions and enjoy yourself
35:04 - all right so let me move on to
35:07 - going to the narrative and storytelling
35:09 - uh
35:10 - page and acting with
35:14 - weird mute the spatial chat audio for
35:18 - all of you
35:19 - and let's see where am i i can't find
35:21 - myself
35:29 - what is going on
35:33 - where am i i can't
35:37 - i can't find myself in spatial chat i'm
35:39 - lost
35:40 - i don't exist
35:45 - uh let's see
35:48 - i must be somewhere i'm looking at all
35:51 - these projects
35:53 - my video is on let's see i'm gonna
35:56 - unmute myself
35:57 - i can't find myself is anybody near me
35:59 - to tell me where i am
36:03 - okay what room what project is this
36:07 - i found myself okay
36:12 - oh okay now i've uh hi uh so i'm a live
36:16 - broadcast i mean i'm a person
36:18 - i don't know why my computer has decided
36:20 - that it's just like all
36:21 - was working so well all of a sudden it's
36:23 - you can see my videos basically become
36:25 - incredibly choppy um but um
36:29 - i'm able to hear you and see you just
36:31 - fine so here i am
36:32 - in the project called it's raining could
36:35 - you introduce yourself and tell us about
36:37 - your project if you're okay with doing
36:38 - that yeah sure
36:41 - um welcome um my project call it's
36:43 - raining it's an
36:45 - interactive multi-story line website
36:47 - about
36:48 - a rainy day it was first a digital
36:51 - translation of the real life art piece
36:54 - ring room
36:55 - um but then i got into building this
36:57 - site i add my
36:59 - impressions of rainy days i think
37:00 - they're secretive
37:02 - absurd and mysterious so i build
37:05 - interactions based on
37:06 - those impressions rather than going
37:09 - through a complete story
37:11 - um you will find yourself being in
37:14 - moments that will lead you to other
37:16 - certain moments according to your choice
37:18 - of past
37:20 - um yeah the link is above um feel feel
37:23 - free to visit the site
37:25 - or i can like like demonstrate it i have
37:27 - a screen share here
37:32 - oh let's try the live demo we haven't
37:33 - had a live demo yet i'd love to see how
37:35 - that
37:36 - works okay happy too it's my first time
37:38 - so
37:41 - so you can choose
37:45 - the man or you can choose that you have
37:47 - an umbrella i don't know if you have a
37:49 - preference
37:50 - but if you do please tell me
37:53 - oh it's too much too much of a decision
37:56 - for me i can't i can't handle it
38:00 - maybe um an umbrella then okay you have
38:03 - an umbrella
38:04 - on a rainy day and you're
38:07 - walking um
38:11 - and then there's a dog and a in a house
38:15 - do you want to choose or i can choose it
38:16 - for you no i i can now
38:18 - i can handle it let's go for the dog
38:21 - i'm a dog person nice

39:06 - fascinated by your project but mostly
39:08 - i'm just like so thrilled to see
39:10 - so this is in the way that you're doing
39:12 - this in spatial chat is that
39:14 - you're you've added a screen share that
39:17 - just appears as
39:18 - like any other image or video and then
39:20 - we're able to see it
39:21 - that's amazing and so um if people want
39:23 - to try is
39:24 - try the project themselves um they can

41:20 - thoughtful and helpful
41:21 - person but i don't know you use the word
41:24 - cool there i don't know if i qualify for
41:25 - that that's for sure
41:30 - i don't know man i mean you seem pretty
41:32 - cool to me
41:34 - right off the bat yeah
41:38 - yes you should see his youtube videos
41:40 - like he has a whole youtube channel
41:41 - called the
41:43 - recording train yes we're live on it
41:46 - right now
41:48 - but i teach 3d in photoshop
41:53 - so i'm having a little bit of a 4d an
41:55 - issue where my
41:56 - like browser is just locking up so hold
41:58 - on i'm going to try
41:59 - resetting it and be right back okay
42:04 - uh technical difficulties everyone look
42:07 - at this do you want to see my project
42:08 - then
42:09 - i do but i'm a little worried it's not
42:10 - going to work because everything is
42:12 - frozen so i'm going to come right back
42:18 - page unresponsive okay so i don't know
42:22 - to what extent
42:22 - um obs this is what i i'm running open
42:26 - broadcast studio
42:27 - and i might oh headphone just
42:29 - disconnected
42:30 - um let me try getting back into
42:33 - spatial chat um
42:37 - and this is just the uh coding train
42:39 - discord
42:41 - let's see if everything is kind of going
42:42 - smoothly again all right this is
42:44 - going sorry everybody let's try
42:48 - opening up the browser again
42:51 - i feel like maybe i should quit obs i
42:54 - want to quit obs briefly
42:56 - see if that helps
43:00 - um i'm also going to do something that
43:02 - seems a little bit odd but i'm going to
43:03 - change where my plug is
43:06 - oh my battery is done wow
43:12 - i'm plugged in but like it has no
43:16 - charge why it's just like battery is not
43:18 - charging
43:20 - because it's just like the life is being
43:22 - sucked out of my computer sorry i
43:24 - realized i wasn't even on screen here
43:26 - so let's give this a second okay it's
43:29 - charging again
43:31 - oof that was kind of a disaster
43:35 - i've lowered the brightness doesn't
43:37 - lower for you
43:40 - let's see if i can get back to spatial
43:41 - chat
43:43 - all right let's take here i'm gonna take
43:46 - a short break here
43:47 - and i'm gonna quit chrome i'm gonna quit
43:50 - discord
43:52 - and i'm going to let the um
43:55 - right i'm going to see if my computer
43:57 - can kind of
43:59 - um just gather its strength
44:04 - i don't know what just happened but like
44:07 - the fan is going crazy
44:09 - the battery went to zero even though i'm
44:11 - plugged in which uh
44:12 - is a little bit distressing so i think
44:15 - maybe just somehow running obs
44:17 - and being in spatial chat and all of
44:19 - that really just
44:20 - um i need like an ice pack to put
44:22 - underneath the computer look at this
44:24 - nice
44:24 - see-through little uh sticker here so i
44:27 - don't know if
44:28 - anybody has um any questions you want to
44:31 - ask right now
44:32 - i can put on some like uh waiting music
44:36 - here um
44:39 - oh the music's not gonna play because i
44:40 - have uh oh wait
44:42 - um i've disconnected oh no it is
44:46 - all right hold on everyone
44:50 - let's do the following i'm actually
44:53 - going to just completely shut down the
44:55 - computer
44:57 - and restart it
45:01 - so if you're just tuning in which i
45:03 - don't know that anybody is
45:05 - i am attempting to live stream the itp
45:08 - ima lo-res
45:09 - show um but my computer
45:12 - that i am uh for joining the show the
45:16 - online show from uh which is not the
45:18 - same computer that i'm live streaming
45:20 - from obviously because you can still
45:21 - hear and see me
45:22 - um really just i don't know what
45:24 - happened but it just decided to
45:26 - fall apart so i'm giving it a moment to
45:28 - rest a moment to breathe
45:30 - i could go to maybe i need a little
45:32 - break for myself could go to my little
45:34 - like
45:35 - intermission animation but mostly i'm
45:37 - just kind of
45:38 - talking here vamping so to speak um
45:41 - to like let the computer charge up a
45:43 - little bit
45:44 - and hopefully then kind of reboot it and
45:46 - be all set
45:47 - and fine um vicky asks in the chat why
45:52 - is there nature of code in the video
45:54 - unfortunately i've lost the threat of
45:55 - what that was referring to
45:58 - i've also just now in the last five
46:00 - minutes lost about 15 viewers
46:02 - i hope it's because you've all gone and
46:04 - joined the show yourself
46:06 - uh i'm gonna give let's let's let's take
46:08 - a proper
46:09 - uh i think this is too awkward for oh
46:11 - who built the spatial chat website i got
46:13 - a question
46:14 - i don't know the answer it is not
46:16 - something that i am affiliated with
46:18 - um it is a service that i believe you
46:21 - can use for free and sign up for but i
46:23 - have no
46:24 - personal knowledge or relationship to it
46:26 - whatsoever it just happens that the
46:28 - program chose to use it as a mechanism
46:30 - or means
46:31 - to display all the projects and ronald
46:33 - thank you for your nice message
46:35 - that's good because i'm am i feeling a
46:38 - little like uh
46:41 - hot and sweaty here um having some
46:43 - technical difficulties and just having
46:45 - to
46:45 - um talk silently in a room by myself
46:49 - with these lights i'm in an attic in
46:51 - brooklyn new york
46:52 - with a camera on me um i think how is
46:55 - the doggy ask here and oh thank you for
46:57 - asking so first of all
46:59 - if you don't know i was i have a gloria
47:01 - pickle is my dog
47:02 - she is a six i want me to get gloria up
47:05 - here hey gloria
47:06 - [Music]
47:08 - gloria we'll see if she comes usually
47:11 - she comes and sleeps right next to me
47:13 - if i'm working at this desk or streaming
47:15 - or teaching
47:16 - but gloria is a six-year-old corgi
47:20 - beagle mix
47:22 - she was uh rescued by a
47:25 - um an organization called muddy paws
47:27 - rescue muddy as in
47:29 - i like to jump in muddy puddles um they
47:32 - are based in brooklyn but they rescue
47:34 - dogs
47:34 - i think from kentucky and also perhaps
47:36 - alabama mightypawsrescue.org
47:39 - um and i've also been we've my family
47:42 - has been fostering with them so we had a
47:43 - dog
47:44 - a puppy an eight-week-old puppy named
47:46 - marlon
47:47 - that was his name i was calling him
47:48 - martin so i got confused or marvin
47:50 - depending on how i felt um and we really
47:54 - loved uh having marlin here i have to
47:55 - admit i
47:56 - i wasn't the nicest but i was kind of
47:57 - complaining because having a puppy is a
47:59 - lot it was like a little bit too much
48:00 - for me
48:02 - but my family wonderfully took care of
48:04 - marlin i participated to the extent that
48:06 - i could
48:07 - but marlon was since adopted by a
48:09 - wonderful
48:10 - uh family and uh marlon's gonna have a
48:13 - wonderful life living in upstate new
48:15 - york at a campground
48:16 - so um many many happy returns from
48:19 - marlin i hope to be able to keep in
48:20 - touch
48:20 - the video was the video on the life's
48:22 - about in the spatial chat so the reason
48:24 - why
48:24 - is that particular video is uh david's
48:27 - project is from my class called nature
48:29 - of code
48:30 - so i'm gonna restart my computer you're
48:31 - gonna hear the lovely chime sound in a
48:33 - minute
48:37 - [Music]
48:39 - we're going to hope that everything gets
48:42 - i'm going to blow on it maybe just to
48:43 - cool it off a little bit
48:48 - i think this works this is
48:49 - scientifically known
48:51 - if you go to the apple support website
48:54 - and you talk to the geniuses at the
48:55 - genius bar they will tell you
48:57 - lift up your laptop and blow on it
49:02 - way to cool down a computer also get an
49:03 - ice pack just set it right on top of the
49:05 - ice pack
49:07 - i'm gonna log in now uh poor david is
49:10 - probably waiting for me
49:12 - i am uh rebooting my computer francello
49:15 - wants to know what are your plans for
49:16 - the summer
49:17 - i'm so glad you asked coding train is my
49:20 - plan for summer
49:23 - may is a little bit wonky june is a
49:26 - little bit i'm not so sure
49:28 - july and august i hack i have some plans
49:30 - to be set up in a new
49:32 - studio with a standing desk to be
49:35 - getting back to my roots doing some more
49:37 - coding challenges
49:38 - we'll see if that happens uh but that's
49:41 - that's my plans um you know hopefully
49:43 - i'll have some time to just enjoy with
49:45 - family
49:46 - enjoy being outside um
49:50 - catching up ah the nature of code
49:52 - project i'm working on in collaboration
49:55 - with some folks
49:56 - a brand new coding train website
49:59 - um jiraj asks is the new nature of code
50:02 - playlist completely up now no
50:04 - no not even close in fact all of chapter
50:07 - five has yet to be released it's all
50:09 - been recorded and mostly edited
50:11 - so stay tuned for that i think i
50:12 - probably said this a month ago in the
50:14 - next couple weeks
50:14 - but really it's coming let's see how my
50:17 - uh how the laptop is doing
50:19 - um show percentage i'm at eight percent
50:24 - but as long as it's charging no apps
50:26 - using significant
50:27 - energy so that's a that's good
50:30 - um um
50:34 - and now i'm sorry i'm kind of answering
50:38 - questions and talking and trying to
50:39 - operate my computer at the same time
50:41 - i can show you what i'm doing so i'm i
50:43 - want to go and open up
50:44 - obs um i'm opening up open broadcast
50:49 - studio
50:50 - which should have my camera by the way
50:53 - this is a green screen which i just
50:54 - keyed it to black
50:56 - which is sort of silly with my live
50:58 - broadcast
50:59 - sign uh using significant energy i don't
51:03 - like that
51:04 - stop using significant energy um i need
51:07 - that energy
51:09 - let's go to tools and start virtual
51:12 - camera
51:14 - now we're going to go back into spatial
51:16 - chat
51:18 - coding train live broadcast i'm a live
51:20 - broadcast all that
51:22 - stuff got it continue
51:25 - uh uh no i want to be my
51:31 - my uh headphones disconnected they are
51:34 - now connected
51:36 - so i should be able to go to come on
51:43 - do i need to re let's refresh and see if
51:46 - the mic shows up
51:48 - there we go i am back into these
51:50 - headphones
51:53 - um yeah it's a little bit silly the
51:55 - whole reason i'm using obs
51:57 - is for this you know i wonder if turning
51:59 - off the keying
52:00 - the chroma keying is probably
52:03 - [Music]
52:05 - using a lot of resources so let's turn
52:07 - that off
52:08 - let's just delete it
52:12 - so hopefully that will help
52:15 - and now i just have a green background
52:17 - which is fine
52:18 - so we'll go back into here i'm going to
52:21 - join the
52:21 - space
52:25 - i also need to have loopback audio going
52:31 - um all right here i am i don't know if
52:33 - anybody can hear me
52:35 - i'm going to mute myself in spatial chat
52:40 - and i'm going to mute the spatial chat
52:41 - audio to the live stream
52:43 - uh everyone i'm just here in a welcome
52:46 - room trying to set up a live stream so
52:48 - you're
52:48 - you're welcome to participate and talk
52:50 - or come near me or run away
52:52 - just letting you know that's what's
52:53 - happening um
52:56 - ah great i had a little technical
52:59 - disaster hold on
53:00 - i'm going to send the audio here around
53:03 - the help
53:04 - uh basically if you want to visit any of
53:06 - the rooms there's a list of rooms on the
53:08 - right
53:09 - if you click any of them it'll take you
53:10 - there everything here
53:12 - is spatial yeah uh so if you if i move
53:15 - away from you you won't hear me anymore
53:19 - uh yeah and all the directory room has a
53:22 - map
53:22 - if you want to find out more about any
53:24 - of the projects being shown
53:28 - all right everybody got that explanation
53:30 - uh we're going to go
53:31 - back to narrative and storytelling
53:34 - we're going to try to find david i'm
53:36 - saying online they're
53:38 - just doing something
53:41 - maybe i'll check it out sounds good
53:44 - congratulations david this is this is
53:45 - really great
53:46 - oh thank you so much to louisa oh you're
53:49 - shiffman
53:49 - i'm back yeah so i discovered just in
53:52 - case anyone's wondering i for some
53:54 - reason
53:54 - my um computer plugged in
53:58 - the battery went all the way to zero
54:00 - percent running obs
54:01 - and spacer chat and everything oh my god
54:04 - so i shut it down
54:06 - i lifted it up i blew on it for a while
54:08 - to cool it off which i think is a
54:10 - scientifically proven method and uh
54:13 - i got it to ten percent and it seems to
54:15 - be going okay right now
54:17 - so i'm ready jay we're sorry for keeping
54:19 - you waiting we're i'm ready
54:21 - for uh for this audience that i've got
54:23 - on youtube who by the way should just
54:25 - join spatial chat and come right here in
54:27 - spatial chat
54:28 - itself but uh uh could you introduce
54:31 - yourself and tell us about your project
54:33 - okay so my name is david and i'm a first
54:37 - year itp
54:38 - student i just finished my first year
54:41 - i'm located in queens new york in
54:43 - flushing
54:44 - and like this is a final project i
54:46 - created for the nature of code
54:49 - is the nature of code class it's like a
54:51 - combination
54:52 - my life story my covet life story
54:54 - experience
54:55 - through p5.js and arduino physical
54:58 - computing
55:00 - so this is a video right here
55:03 - and i can i just use the potentiometers
55:06 - to adjust
55:07 - the weather of the ocean scene as seen
55:09 - in this video
55:11 - and i think it came out pretty good and
55:13 - like
55:14 - it's it shows like my personal life
55:16 - story and
55:17 - just explaining to it releasing my
55:20 - stress through the potentiometer you
55:21 - know so
55:23 - it's it's i made this project also
55:25 - metaphorical
55:26 - for both sending to life you know and
55:29 - standing through a storm and through
55:31 - good times and bad times you know so
55:34 - that's it wonderful yeah one of my
55:36 - favorite things about your project david
55:38 - is so you just have some beautiful
55:40 - quotes in there i don't want to spoil
55:42 - them i'll let people
55:44 - experiencing them for themselves but you
55:45 - really have some just delightful quotes
55:47 - and i just think it's also
55:49 - just tremendous work i know how
55:50 - challenging it can be to build your own
55:53 - interface
55:54 - and have it communicate with the browser
55:56 - and the way that you pick the different
55:58 - parameters with some of these
55:59 - algorithmic systems that we looked at in
56:00 - class and were able to develop your own
56:02 - interface for them
56:03 - and tie it into such a personal story is
56:06 - really just terrific wonderful work
56:08 - so um i i think i i'm not i think if i
56:10 - move my
56:11 - um self closer to the video i can hear
56:15 - your audio so i'm gonna do that and let
56:16 - people
56:17 - listen but um if people wanted to watch
56:19 - um use the sketch
56:21 - or watch this particular video
56:23 - themselves i'm assuming these two links
56:25 - that i see right here
56:27 - yes so that's it the first link is a
56:29 - documentation
56:31 - for my former project the second link is
56:35 - a non-pecan version of the sketch
56:37 - so that people can interact with it with
56:39 - the sliders which i replace with the
56:41 - potentiometers for this video or should
56:43 - i say
56:44 - right yeah we talked about that it's
56:45 - such a great thing to do if you work on
56:48 - an interactive p5.js sketch that's like
56:51 - got custom physical installation and
56:53 - hardware um
56:54 - you can have both you can maintain a
56:56 - simultaneous version
56:58 - that works with just browser-based
57:00 - interaction so people can actually
57:01 - experience that interaction themselves
57:03 - and then watch your video documentation
57:05 - to understand
57:06 - um how the hardware and the um gesture
57:09 - based physical
57:10 - interface works so it'd be uh it's too
57:11 - bad this is like such a perfect project
57:13 - for the live
57:14 - itp show i hope that next year and we're
57:17 - back together on the floor sometime
57:18 - you'll be able to bring it in
57:20 - so other other folks can can try it
57:22 - themselves yeah
57:24 - i really want to friendship breakups so
57:26 - i'm gonna i'm i'm kind of like
57:28 - listening in the in the back of my mind
57:30 - here or like just
57:32 - the corner of my ear i don't know what
57:33 - the right expression is for when the
57:34 - video starts but i think it's nearing
57:36 - the end is that right
57:38 - it is yeah yeah so i'm going to try to
57:39 - move myself up and so that we can so i
57:41 - can play it
57:42 - for the stream when it starts over okay
57:44 - perfect
57:45 - better now congratulations david i'm
57:48 - going to go and look around oh thank you
57:50 - so nice to meet you yeah nice to meet
57:52 - you nice to meet you
57:54 - too bye take care looking forward to a
57:56 - much better year
57:58 - and not stormy days anymore all right
58:01 - just i'm moving over here just to reset
58:02 - the room for a minute for anybody who's
58:04 - watching me
58:05 - live this is a oh uh live broadcast
58:08 - of an end of semester show from the itp
58:10 - ima and low res
58:11 - programs at tisch school of the arts nyu
58:13 - and i think the pro
58:14 - i think the video is about to start over
58:16 - is that right
58:18 - yes perfect i'm gonna move up and kind
58:20 - of zoom in on it thank you david
58:23 - when you go towards one side of the life
58:27 - bad things happen to you you go to a
58:29 - dark
58:30 - miserable storm and everything seems
58:32 - very pessimistic
58:38 - you go through happy days and things go
58:41 - very good for you
58:42 - people love you everything goes the way
58:45 - you wanted to
58:47 - and in between you have ups and downs
58:51 - just like any other person does
58:55 - so 2020 was one hell of a year for me
58:58 - i've been through so much throughout the
59:00 - covet pandemic and
59:02 - a lot of people like i know like got the
59:05 - virus
59:06 - and it's been a crazy tough year you
59:09 - know
59:10 - so when the pandemic started my family
59:14 - and i got very sick with covet
59:17 - and we've been to these dark times
59:20 - my mother almost died and my father got
59:22 - very sick
59:24 - i was the most healthiest one during the
59:26 - pandemic
59:28 - and things were very dark for me and
59:31 - just
59:32 - just knowing that wanting for better
59:35 - days to come
59:36 - was just like a far away thing you know
59:42 - but then the pandemic got better
59:45 - my family and i tested negative for
59:47 - coving
59:49 - like things were looking up but it still
59:52 - wasn't the same
59:54 - there were still dark and stormy days
59:58 - i gained the quarantine 15 or should i
60:01 - say
60:02 - quarantine 50 pounds which was a whole
60:04 - lot for me
60:07 - aside from the weight already gained in
60:09 - the past
60:12 - my ticks social god works for my
60:14 - tourette's syndrome because
60:15 - i have tourette's syndrome which is a
60:18 - neurological disorder characterized by
60:21 - inflammatory movements and ticks and
60:24 - these were like horrible days for me
60:28 - like it's just tough to remember it you
60:30 - know
60:31 - so these were the stormy days
60:35 - and suddenly things were kind of rough
60:37 - here and there
60:39 - i also broke up with a lot of friends
60:40 - sorry
60:42 - had some friendship breakups and this
60:45 - thing's happening to me you know like
60:48 - a lot of changes in my life
60:52 - but then the better days were coming in
60:54 - 2021
60:56 - now this year is looking up for me
60:59 - and there's no more storm things are
61:02 - starting to get better now
61:04 - although things are do have its ups and
61:06 - downs still
61:09 - but it's getting better now
61:12 - looking forward to a much better year
61:15 - and
61:16 - not stormy days anymore
61:19 - what a good way to release myself so far
61:23 - just to the turn of a potentiometer knob
61:28 - and one more thing i have to say
61:31 - light's a boat okay not too bad
61:36 - life is like a potentiometer
61:40 - when you go towards one side of the life
61:44 - bad things happen thanks for
61:45 - broadcasting yeah thanks for
61:46 - broadcasting
61:47 - of course all right i'm gonna wander
61:49 - around and head to some other projects
61:53 - take care it's kind of here i am uh
61:55 - really
61:56 - incredible for me to think that it's
61:57 - been a little over 20 years actually if
61:59 - we're talking about the full itp journey
62:01 - my itp journey has been uh
62:05 - rather long
62:08 - i saw myself on the in the video
62:12 - and i had to come over here reload on
62:14 - her screens
62:18 - um can you i'm i'm in the middle i'm
62:20 - kind of like wandering around the show
62:22 - and live broadcasting
62:23 - some of the projects can you give a
62:25 - quick um uh summary of uh just introduce
62:28 - yourself and tell us a few sentences
62:29 - about what it is that you worked on
62:33 - sure yeah so i'm akshita and i'm a first
62:35 - year itp student
62:36 - and my project was a hundred days of
62:39 - journalism for a class called hundred
62:41 - days of making
62:42 - and for the last 100 days i've been
62:44 - interviewing everyone from itp
62:46 - student faculties and staff members and
62:49 - hopefully this project is going to go on
62:51 - in summer and fall as well up to now
62:54 - i've done about 65 interviews
62:56 - and this uh is a compilation of
63:00 - the bits of the first question that i
63:02 - asked in the interview
63:03 - like which is on the screen and if you
63:05 - see the link on the left is the
63:07 - instagram page
63:08 - of uh where i post individual interviews
63:10 - as well
63:13 - amazing i i'm really just always so
63:16 - impressed and in awe of the hundred days
63:19 - projects that i've been following many
63:20 - of them and
63:21 - it's something that i have never tried
63:23 - to do and i certainly
63:25 - aspire to do it especially in the sort
63:27 - of creative coding world
63:28 - there's a lot of people who will do
63:30 - things like daily sketching
63:33 - and i think you know in in the sort of
63:34 - coding sketching sense and i think it's
63:36 - a wonderful practice
63:37 - to adopt to sort of uh you know
63:40 - release yourself in a way of like oh i
63:42 - have to spend like weeks or months or
63:45 - like
63:45 - get everything perfect no just but uh
63:47 - this is such a different kind of project
63:49 - with the
63:50 - with the journalism i imagine it was a
63:51 - tremendous amount of work just to
63:54 - like coordinate how did you manage that
63:58 - so i i think i i sent out google forms
64:00 - for the students and they filled out the
64:02 - google forms and that's how i got to
64:04 - know about their available days and
64:05 - times
64:06 - and for faculty i sent you all emails
64:08 - personally
64:10 - uh to better match um the timings i
64:13 - think the most challenging part was the
64:14 - post-production
64:16 - because uh that took a lot of time
64:18 - honestly especially for the interviews
64:20 - that i took in person on the floor
64:22 - that was literally hard yeah yeah
64:26 - see wonderful well thank you for sharing
64:28 - this so if folks want to um
64:30 - catch all of the interviews they can
64:32 - it's the best places to send them to
64:33 - your instagram page
64:36 - yeah wonderful yeah i'm gonna zoom in on
64:40 - it and show show show everyone all right
64:42 - thanks so much for sharing
64:43 - thank you so much for coming by
64:49 - so here uh i'm gonna mute myself in
64:51 - spatial chat for a second
64:52 - um so here uh i'm gonna bring myself
64:55 - back here
64:56 - uh so here i would encourage you to
64:58 - check out the 100 days of journalism
65:00 - project
65:00 - by akshita and uh you can find
65:04 - her instagram link right there at
65:05 - instagram.com 100 days
65:07 - of journalism okay
65:10 - uh how's everybody doing in the chat
65:12 - people are still here
65:13 - are you you should go too have we hit
65:16 - well how many people are in the actual
65:18 - itp ima
65:20 - spatial chat show can we get it up to
65:22 - 500 people that's my personal goal
65:24 - help me out here share this let's get
65:26 - 500 people into it we could do it
65:30 - um i'm gonna wander through i have a
65:32 - kind of list of projects oh
65:34 - where am i
65:44 - um
65:47 - moving around here layton vignettes
65:52 - let's go check that out yeah yep yep
65:55 - that was right
65:59 - i see mr shipman i think
66:03 - uh i haven't figured out it is hi
66:06 - i have arrived hello
66:09 - i should warn everyone that this is
66:11 - you're being you're being sort of like
66:13 - transmitted across the intertubes right
66:15 - now
66:16 - although mostly i just so used to tom
66:18 - ran away
66:21 - um i heard that and he was like i don't
66:23 - know why that's why i've done
66:24 - this that's the proper that is the only
66:27 - appropriate reaction by the way
66:29 - to uh um so
66:32 - here i am i'm i'm sorry i have like a
66:34 - million buttons to press before i
66:36 - can uh to orient myself let me press
66:38 - this
66:39 - um hi kevin how are you
66:42 - hi i'm great how are you um
66:46 - um i would love for you to uh if you
66:48 - have a minute and don't mind being uh
66:50 - broadcast here to tell us a little bit
66:52 - about this project
66:54 - sure um this is a virtual production
66:57 - short made entirely in unreal engine 4.
67:01 - so um at least at itp there's
67:04 - two kind of like prevailing schools of
67:06 - thoughts or kind of use cases of unreal
67:08 - engine
67:09 - one is uh in game play so using like
67:12 - blueprints or a c
67:13 - plus and kind of like programming
67:14 - environment where the user can go
67:16 - through yourself
67:17 - or um in you know hollywood and the
67:20 - mandalorian i'm sure a lot of people
67:21 - have seen
67:22 - is using unreal engine sequencer um to
67:25 - produce uh you know time-based media uh
67:28 - media production
67:29 - so it's more kind of like a 3d after
67:32 - effects premiere pro type of
67:34 - situation so this is the latter um this
67:36 - is using that
67:37 - and kind of like recording out a bunch
67:39 - of unreal
67:40 - uh sorry uh real-time uh sequences and
67:43 - then
67:44 - uh tied together with match cuts so you
67:46 - know the eye-opening
67:48 - into the subway tunnel the falling
67:50 - versus the rising
67:51 - um the connected with light and then the
67:53 - life and death
67:55 - wow so just to unpack this for a moment
67:59 - um i definitely understand the
68:00 - distinction between
68:02 - using something like unreal engine for
68:04 - an interactive experience a game that
68:06 - somebody might play
68:07 - or for i'm a huge fan of like
68:12 - the mandalorian specifically but just
68:14 - kind of shows that are using a lot of um
68:17 - exciting new techniques and virtual
68:18 - production visual effects but one thing
68:20 - that's
68:20 - never is not entirely clear to me is um
68:23 - the the
68:24 - what's what's actually um you know
68:27 - what's real time versus rendered so for
68:30 - example
68:31 - is the benefit of a lot of what you're
68:33 - doing here is that there isn't that
68:34 - distinction like
68:36 - if you design a scene uh you don't need
68:38 - to like press the render button and wait
68:39 - overnight to see the footage but it
68:41 - actually just
68:42 - happens real time and is there like sort
68:44 - of a uh a quality trade-off there
68:46 - um that's that's one i don't i don't
68:49 - have it's kind of a
68:50 - i'm kind of bouncing around this
68:51 - question without a very well formed
68:53 - thought but that's kind of
68:54 - uh that distinction between real time
68:56 - versus render
68:58 - how does that play a role in your work
69:01 - uh
69:01 - yes um that i think you pretty much got
69:05 - it
69:05 - it's a it's a definitive time trade-off
69:07 - and in you know like media production
69:09 - time is money
69:10 - yeah and also for
69:13 - rendering essentially you know like
69:15 - really good animation studios like pixar
69:17 - dreamworks like they have essentially
69:19 - large render farms like
69:20 - large server rooms just blasting uh like
69:23 - gpu cards
69:24 - at it and real time just you know relies
69:26 - on your local
69:27 - like gpu whatever you have there is a
69:30 - quality trade-off but not much
69:33 - i think that that's the appeal of unreal
69:34 - is right now it's getting to a place
69:37 - where it's much
69:38 - better um and it depends on kind of like
69:42 - what you're using it for maybe it's not
69:45 - you know to the level that people want
69:48 - for pixar
69:49 - like you know like um feature length
69:52 - movies sort of like quality
69:53 - um and a lot of the tools uh that unreal
69:56 - has is getting better and better
69:58 - partially because it's owned by epic
70:00 - games
70:00 - and epic has fortnite so they're able to
70:03 - just buy
70:03 - everyone um the same strategy that apple
70:07 - use essentially you know you have the
70:09 - money you buy all the startups and you
70:10 - get all the tech
70:11 - and you make it free to a certain extent
70:13 - um
70:14 - so it's getting popular more and more
70:16 - popular and then you know thanks to
70:17 - shows like the mandalorian
70:19 - which uh the virtual production there is
70:21 - essentially i don't know if you've seen
70:22 - the behind the scenes yeah the led
70:24 - yeah um it's the time right like you're
70:27 - getting you're able to get posts and vfx
70:30 - into the same room as principal
70:32 - photography
70:33 - or the dp and the director so there's no
70:35 - lag
70:36 - there's no latency between the two and
70:38 - you're able to visualize things on the
70:40 - fly
70:40 - so you don't have to like go back and
70:42 - see oh this didn't come out right let me
70:44 - reshoot it right yeah i was
70:45 - i was watching an interview i think it
70:47 - was with one of the sort of like
70:49 - lighting designer or lighting animators
70:51 - and i i mean by like
70:52 - virtual lighting and they were so
70:55 - excited to work on the mandalorian and
70:57 - the
70:57 - i'm paraphrasing whatever the interview
70:59 - was but it was the first experience
71:01 - where they were actually there on set
71:03 - like doing their work as opposed to it
71:05 - all being sort of after the fact
71:06 - in a different room like by themselves
71:11 - so that was really cool to see i would
71:12 - love um i think it would be really
71:14 - exciting to have
71:15 - a kind of at you know tisch at itp
71:19 - ima to have a kind of mini or virtual
71:22 - volume type set that people could play
71:24 - with and so what um
71:26 - if um like for me like i you know have a
71:28 - lot of experience with certain kinds of
71:29 - digital media and coding and
71:31 - different kinds of graphics but i
71:32 - haven't worked with these kinds of 3d
71:34 - engines
71:34 - what what would be for somebody who's
71:36 - coming from a creative coding world
71:38 - perhaps
71:38 - if they wanted to get into unreal like
71:40 - what what are the
71:42 - what's the starting point what are the
71:44 - skills or or kind of prerequisites in a
71:46 - way before
71:47 - getting started with this kind of work
71:50 - um
71:50 - i would say in my opinion uh most of the
71:53 - creative coding people
71:55 - actually prefer unity a little bit more
71:58 - than on
71:59 - just based on you know you can just get
72:01 - into c-sharp and
72:02 - and modify things uh with code which to
72:05 - me
72:05 - i'm coming from a uh actually like a
72:08 - filmmaking and data science background
72:10 - um so unreal's ui felt much more
72:13 - intuitive
72:14 - and a lot of this sort of controls that
72:16 - we're dealing with right now
72:18 - um is essentially mimicking real-life
72:21 - filmmaking
72:22 - and that's the kind of like um the
72:24 - on-ramp for
72:26 - um you know professional filmmakers to
72:28 - get onto unreal or that's the hope
72:30 - um so uh examples of this
72:33 - are you know the way that the camera
72:34 - glides there's like a virtual crane
72:37 - there's a virtual dolly um you know you
72:39 - can put
72:40 - like lens flares and you can put like
72:42 - different like sort of like dirt maps on
72:44 - there and you can change the focal
72:46 - length and the the
72:47 - um sensor with even though there's no
72:50 - sensor
72:50 - no um but i would say
72:54 - you know uh understand kind of what
72:57 - you're using on real four
72:58 - um it's interesting because
73:02 - it's a game engine but you don't have to
73:04 - use it for games right you're
73:06 - essentially
73:06 - in the real-timeness of it um and the
73:09 - 3dness of it
73:11 - and uh there's a lot of applications to
73:14 - be done there
73:14 - and uh one of the things actually if you
73:18 - uh went to the p-comp room i have
73:20 - another project i did with
73:21 - a collaborator at itp um where we
73:24 - created a physical computing uh camera
73:27 - without any image detection
73:29 - and we would essentially instead have a
73:31 - bunch of environmental sensors
73:33 - and you can grab kind of like snapshots
73:36 - of
73:36 - um the light condition and send it to a
73:39 - server and in unreal i can hook
73:41 - onto that server through http get
73:43 - request and then use
73:44 - that data to drive the lighting
73:46 - condition uh change in the scene
73:50 - awesome wow that's cool i've actually
73:53 - i'm hoping to head by i
73:54 - i'm like i was like oh i'm gonna hit all
73:57 - the rooms and somehow i think i'm only
73:58 - on my third so
74:00 - but um that's awesome to hear and and
74:02 - for anybody who's tuning in like
74:04 - obviously you can just join this spatial
74:05 - chat uh
74:07 - system yourself just by going to the url
74:09 - that's pinned in the video description
74:11 - and in the chat
74:12 - so check out both this project and the
74:14 - other one
74:15 - uh in the p-comp room as well so cool
74:17 - thanks so much for sharing this
74:19 - um it's awesome i'm excited to see where
74:21 - it all leads
74:22 - thank you thank you awesome thanks
74:28 - okay let me head to uh empty welcome
74:31 - room
74:32 - all right i'm in an empty welcome room
74:33 - woof here i am
74:35 - right i'm back in my seat this is my
74:37 - really high-end visual effects
74:40 - i've integrated myself perfectly into
74:42 - this room
74:43 - of watching the show here
74:46 - how's everybody doing there's a few of
74:48 - you still tuning in
74:50 - um ronald is saying that's crazy i never
74:53 - thought about unreal as an animating
74:55 - engine
74:56 - yeah i i don't know like maybe i feel
74:58 - like
74:59 - i was gonna say it's too late for me
75:01 - which is the wrong way to put it but
75:03 - um i i i'm just fascinated by what's
75:06 - happening
75:06 - in animation and virtual production it's
75:09 - it's not really a skill set
75:11 - or that i have um
75:14 - but it's kind of amazing to see
75:17 - um what different students and and
75:20 - creative folks are doing these days and
75:22 - maybe
75:23 - maybe in some small way i can align some
75:26 - ideas or you know i was thinking of
75:27 - learning actually unity or blender
75:29 - um in particular and trying to do some
75:31 - to work with those on the coding train
75:33 - but okay
75:34 - let's move on um i'm running i'm
75:37 - kind of running a a little bit low on
75:39 - steam here i was going to try to go
75:40 - until 9
75:41 - 30 p.m which is very late way past my
75:44 - bedtime
75:44 - it's way past my bedtime let's play this
75:47 - 19 music here
75:50 - oh boy people are hearing me i remember
75:52 - i should mute myself with spacious chat
75:54 - i came here because it was empty uh but
75:57 - uh ah
75:58 - maybe this is a viewer here um you're
76:00 - hearing me probably in both ears now and
76:02 - sort of like with a weird echo delay
76:06 - but i'm going to head over to
76:10 - physical computing and product design
76:13 - and i have
76:13 - my eye and a couple projects um there
76:17 - that i want to check out
76:18 - so oh there's a lot of people in that
76:20 - room i wonder if i should go somewhere
76:22 - that's a little less crowded
76:26 - all right we'll turn this music off
76:30 - um all right so i'm heading over to
76:33 - product design pcomp here we go
76:37 - and i meant to check my only mute myself
76:39 - here
76:40 - bring myself oh i am back i'm gonna i'm
76:42 - gonna just check how's my
76:43 - oh good okay we seem to be the computer
76:46 - seems to be charging again
76:48 - uh which is a very good sign okay so
76:52 - let's find um let me zoom out here
76:58 - let me take myself out there and let's
77:01 - see
77:01 - ah um where did i go where did i end up
77:04 - i'm lost again i zoomed out and i can't
77:07 - find myself is great how did that happen
77:18 - where am i i have to unmute myself oh no
77:20 - i'm down here
77:21 - okay you don't lose it's not as if you
77:25 - need too many they seem to be in the
77:26 - middle of a conversation
77:28 - so let's go uh
77:31 - all right here we are ah okay hold on
77:33 - hello aiden
77:36 - hello how's it going it's going well um
77:39 - i am sorry i'm kind of getting my
77:42 - ducks in a row the wires plugged into
77:44 - the right thing i'm making sure my audio
77:46 - stuff is going so this is by the way
77:48 - it's a live broadcast
77:49 - if you can tell by the uh overlay i got
77:51 - going here
77:52 - um do you have a minute to share um
77:55 - share about your
77:56 - work and project yeah absolutely i'd
77:58 - love to
77:59 - awesome uh take it away whenever you're
78:01 - ready i've got all
78:02 - right plugged in and working sounds
78:05 - great hello everybody
78:06 - um this is my project called infinite
78:08 - reflections and it is the first
78:10 - video infinity mirrors what you're
78:11 - looking at right up here is
78:13 - a real-life video sculpture containing
78:15 - 14 000 leds
78:17 - it is not a render um if you want to
78:19 - scan the hash uh
78:20 - yeah this qr code you can see the videos
78:22 - in hd i'm also going to play them here
78:24 - but
78:24 - we'll see what happens um so just to go
78:26 - over the basics of an infinity mirror
78:28 - you've got a light source in between a
78:29 - regular mirror and a beam splitter so
78:31 - the light bounces back and forth
78:33 - some of it escapes each time and you see
78:34 - uh repetition into the z
78:36 - axis um so last semester so hyland knows
78:39 - that and i created the first
78:40 - video infinity mirror which you can see
78:41 - here um
78:43 - and this is what it looks like in my
78:45 - apartment it is about two feet wide
78:47 - and that's what it looks like when i can
78:49 - start um
78:52 - this semester i kept on going and i
78:55 - created a sphere mirror and convex
78:57 - mirror these are
78:59 - the same inside modular ring but there's
79:02 - different back and front plates so
79:04 - in this case on the left there's speeder
79:06 - mirror which is based on yay kusama's
79:07 - work
79:08 - it's hemispheres on a back mirror that
79:10 - are reflected into spheres and then
79:12 - repeated into the z-axis
79:14 - on the right i'm using a convex smear so
79:17 - that's
79:17 - kind of what you might see at a
79:19 - convenience store to see around the
79:20 - corner it's a bulging lens and that
79:21 - causes the visuals to warp
79:23 - warp inwards um i'll just play this for
79:26 - a couple seconds so we can see
79:27 - um maybe fast forward to here
79:31 - um yeah so if you look closely on any of
79:35 - the individual
79:36 - spheres i don't know if this is
79:37 - glitching out or not but you can
79:38 - actually see
79:39 - all the other spheres floating in space
79:42 - there and the visuals you see
79:44 - happenstance turn out to be exactly what
79:46 - is
79:47 - visible in the same animations on the
79:49 - convex mirror because
79:50 - a hemisphere is a convex mirror as well
79:53 - um
79:54 - so a lot of my work this semester was
79:55 - learning how to use touch designer so
79:57 - that i could create
79:58 - different types of particle simulations
80:00 - and graphics that take advantage of this
80:02 - circular um screen that i built with
80:05 - these
80:05 - mirroring properties so if you move the
80:07 - graphics up and down through the screen
80:09 - it creates a tunnel
80:10 - if you flip them on your side and move
80:12 - them back and forth through the screen
80:13 - it creates this spiraling tunnel effect
80:17 - the next one is the result of moving the
80:20 - visuals one direction through the screen
80:22 - and reflecting the subsequent
80:24 - repetitions
80:25 - um and up until this point i've been
80:27 - using all these mirroring tricks
80:29 - to get rid of the scene that's in the
80:32 - middle because i'm setting a rectangular
80:34 - video to a circular screen
80:36 - um the next one is the first example
80:38 - i've been able to figure out so far
80:39 - of getting rid of the seam and not using
80:41 - any tricks i'm actually programmed in
80:43 - the
80:44 - rules in the asteroids game so the
80:46 - stripes are flying out one side of the
80:48 - screen and then they come in through the
80:49 - other at the same angle
80:51 - both on the top and the bottom uh
80:53 - eventually i'll be rendering in a 3d
80:55 - environment and then mapping it to a
80:56 - cylinder but i haven't gotten that part
80:58 - yet
80:59 - um here's a overview of how everything
81:02 - works but
81:02 - the important things are that there's an
81:04 - app you can control on your phone
81:06 - and you can send live graphics to it
81:08 - over wi-fi
81:09 - so i built a server that's running on my
81:12 - raspberry pi
81:13 - that takes udp messages that i'm sending
81:16 - from my desktop
81:17 - that can basically pull in any siphon
81:19 - stream from any program
81:21 - in a processing sketch and what that
81:23 - allows me to do is create
81:25 - a real-time interactive sculpture
81:28 - so this is called panopti's mirror and
81:30 - it's based on the panopti's uh
81:32 - myth of the hundred-eyed beast that was
81:34 - rewarded for his service for
81:35 - um by having his eyes put on the peacock
81:37 - feathers
81:39 - so this version of the mirror um is the
81:41 - commentary on surveillance capitalism
81:43 - and the ease at which we give our
81:46 - biometric data
81:47 - and privacy information away for a
81:49 - little bit of entertainment so
81:51 - go back to the beginning it attracts you
81:52 - over to these flashy peacock
81:54 - visuals and when you step in front of it
81:56 - it's using open cv eye tracking
81:58 - the camera grabs your eyes they do a
82:01 - real-time mask
82:02 - send them through touch designer and
82:03 - then out over wi-fi
82:05 - to project in real time into the mirror
82:07 - your reward for
82:08 - giving up your eyes is to have your eyes
82:11 - staring back at you so
82:12 - the eyes get switched over from the
82:14 - peacock feathers into this particle
82:15 - simulation
82:17 - um and it gets a little bit overwhelming
82:20 - sometimes and then when you step away
82:23 - uh knows you're no longer in front of it
82:24 - and transitions back into
82:26 - peacock feathers um
82:30 - out of rest a lot of stuff there yeah
82:32 - wow that was uh
82:34 - you must have explained this project
82:35 - before i think you seem to have that
82:37 - totally down um practice a little bit it
82:40 - was my thesis
82:41 - yeah no i don't but so um so this is
82:44 - amazing and people are
82:45 - uh you probably don't see the youtube
82:46 - chat there's a small audience here and
82:48 - people are saying all sorts of nice
82:49 - things including how could i buy this
82:51 - was one of the comments so
82:53 - um actually so that's my first question
82:55 - on instagram yeah first question to you
82:56 - which isn't how can i buy this but uh
82:59 - are the is this just currently in your
83:01 - own
83:02 - space have you installed it anywhere
83:03 - else do you have plans to because to me
83:05 - i i kind of i really have a sense of
83:07 - what it is
83:08 - and i can kind of you know use my
83:12 - mind to sort of like try to imagine
83:15 - uh i mean it's absolutely beautiful
83:16 - seeing the documentation of it you've
83:18 - done a really excellent job
83:20 - uh taking video and and imagery of it
83:23 - that i get a good sense of it but i
83:24 - i can't help but think nothing there's
83:26 - no real replacement for being there
83:28 - with it um so is um and i know obviously
83:32 - there's a lot of
83:33 - you know challenges and restrictions in
83:36 - terms of being able to show work
83:38 - um in the last year and um but as things
83:40 - are now changing and opening up um this
83:42 - is something that
83:42 - do you have plans of where you might
83:44 - install this or uh
83:46 - when can i see it in person that's
83:47 - really my question you can see it
83:48 - tomorrow because it's at the itp floor
83:50 - right now oh it is
83:51 - i put it up in the hallways yeah so it'd
83:53 - be great if you go there at night when
83:55 - it's dark so you don't get the
83:56 - white washing you out behind you um but
83:58 - yeah so it's gonna be at itp for a few
84:00 - weeks
84:00 - um i definitely would love to exhibit it
84:03 - anywhere i could get the opportunity to
84:04 - in the future
84:05 - um and yeah i'm kind of exploring this
84:08 - idea
84:09 - kind of just brush the surface of it but
84:11 - this this idea that you can
84:13 - have a physical sculpture that many
84:14 - people have um but
84:16 - the physical sculptures can have
84:18 - customized digital content on them
84:20 - um this future marketplace of you know
84:23 - all these digital assets that are
84:24 - becoming collectibles
84:25 - i think this could be a great um actual
84:27 - use case instead of just fake uh
84:30 - spinning gifts spinning dollar signs i
84:32 - um
84:33 - i own um a couple one piece that's like
84:36 - from a company called infinite objects
84:38 - which is like um
84:40 - they make it's called you know printable
84:41 - video and so there you know obviously
84:43 - you have a much
84:44 - more highly specialized unique
84:47 - like you know uh display i mean their
84:50 - uh infinite object stuff is is amazing
84:52 - but it's more traditional rectangular
84:54 - video as opposed to
84:55 - this like incredible uh
84:58 - spherical display but yes i think you
85:01 - know to me i love having that
85:03 - and um you know i i can see that that's
85:06 - there's a lot of potential there in
85:08 - thinking about how um
85:10 - how people could you know share their
85:13 - artworks and visuals on this
85:14 - over a network uh um and and that sort
85:17 - of thing um one thing just to quickly
85:18 - add
85:19 - it's so funny like i was uh i was
85:20 - watching a twitch stream about shaders
85:23 - the other day and they were basically
85:25 - making all these radial patterns
85:28 - it's amazing how similar they look but
85:30 - also
85:31 - the discussion i was kind of chiming in
85:33 - on the chat there was about
85:34 - dealing with the seam so it depends a
85:37 - lot on what you're doing but
85:38 - um you know there's a lot of tricks in
85:41 - computer graphics in terms of looking at
85:43 - polar coordinates
85:44 - and saying and like um and um
85:48 - being able to you know people are doing
85:50 - this often with like gif
85:51 - loops and using uh purlin noise or
85:54 - simplex noise these different like noise
85:56 - algorithms
85:56 - to be able to sort of like walk through
85:58 - the numbers in a
86:00 - in a radial space to then tie one end to
86:02 - the other
86:03 - so i'm sure you've explored and thought
86:04 - about some of this stuff but to the
86:06 - extent um that's definitely something
86:07 - that comes
86:08 - up a lot in my own sort of teaching and
86:09 - examples and if there's anything
86:11 - that i can help with there definitely
86:12 - let me know this is it it does like to
86:14 - be
86:14 - used for coding trains that i would love
86:18 - it's a small detail but it's it it can
86:20 - make as i'm sure you've discovered like
86:21 - a huge
86:22 - uh difference it's gonna like take you
86:24 - out of the
86:25 - the sort of absolutely the illusion of
86:27 - what you're experiencing once you see
86:29 - that like ah
86:30 - it's a it's a screen because there's
86:32 - this weird line there
86:33 - so um yeah it's a wonderful amazing work
86:36 - i can't i'm so excited to hear
86:38 - what what is today tuesday yes i'll be
86:40 - on the floor tomorrow not at night but
86:42 - i'll try to be able to be cloudy at some
86:43 - point i can take a look at it
86:45 - take a big poster board and hold it
86:47 - behind your back yeah that's awesome
86:49 - and so if people want to find out more
86:51 - about this the qr code and your website
86:53 - are the best place
86:54 - to send them yeah yep or instagram too
86:57 - yeah it's not updated
86:58 - great awesome thank you so much for
87:01 - sharing
87:02 - thanks so much for stopping by now all
87:03 - right
87:06 - okay i have muted myself
87:10 - i'm coming back here
87:13 - how's everybody doing um i see we have a
87:17 - coding train member
87:18 - adriel oliveira that i um i don't know
87:21 - if you're still watching
87:22 - uh i think you must be newish um if
87:25 - you're a new coding trained member
87:27 - um make sure you check um
87:30 - that find the google form that's like
87:31 - linkedin where you sign up
87:33 - um so that we can be in touch and get
87:34 - you uh onboarded into the discord and
87:36 - all that stuff
87:37 - um let's see um let's let me zoom out
87:41 - here
87:43 - uh oh brandon looks like let me go see i
87:46 - wanted to check out the
87:47 - solar fractal
88:00 - so um i'm listening there's a little bit
88:03 - of a conversation going on that i don't
88:04 - want to interrupt
88:06 - um but um
88:12 - um
88:14 - but uh i'll wait as they wind down and
88:17 - maybe we'll we'll see if brandon can
88:18 - give us a nice explanation of this
88:20 - project
88:27 - yes hi sorry i oh now i i have just
88:30 - unmuted your audio i have a
88:32 - i i i'm getting a little better at my
88:34 - system here this is a live broadcast
88:37 - uh uh it's the the appropriate reaction
88:39 - by the way is to run away go somewhere
88:41 - else if you want
88:42 - um but i'm kind of wandering around here
88:45 - and um checking out some of the projects
88:47 - um this is one that i know well because
88:48 - it just happens to be from a class that
88:51 - i'm involved with
88:53 - i guess is a weird way to put it um so
88:56 - do you have a minute brandon to to give
88:57 - us a quick um
88:58 - to introduce yourself and tell us a bit
89:00 - about this project
89:02 - yeah of course so uh yeah i'm i'm
89:04 - brandon
89:05 - uh i was fortunate to be in the nature
89:07 - of code with dan this semester
89:09 - and uh this project is a
89:12 - solar-powered fractal tree so it's uh
89:15 - you know combining what i was learning
89:17 - in the nature of code with
89:19 - fractal trees and l systems um
89:22 - with an enclosure that's uh an e-paper
89:25 - display
89:26 - that's being run by an arduino so i had
89:29 - to port
89:30 - a bunch of what we were learning in in
89:31 - class to the
89:33 - arduino ide and uh
89:36 - then it's solar-powered so like a a real
89:38 - plant when it's
89:39 - exposed to light uh that'll generate new
89:41 - growth
89:42 - over time
89:46 - amazing and and this is um i have not
89:48 - yet experienced this in person
89:51 - but this is um you have this there's
89:54 - just one of these right now and you have
89:55 - it uh at home with you or do you have
89:57 - plans for thinking about how
89:59 - you might get yeah oh there it is
90:02 - just the one yeah i'd love to figure out
90:06 - how to
90:07 - simplify it a bit um i had a good chat a
90:10 - moment ago with allison parrish and she
90:12 - was
90:13 - pointing out how um yeah like the
90:15 - minimalist aesthetic
90:16 - i think there's some ways right now
90:18 - there's a lipo battery in it that's not
90:20 - necessarily good for the environment i
90:21 - think the whole thing could be
90:23 - trimmed down to maybe run on a capacitor
90:26 - maybe even lower power so yeah there's i
90:29 - want to do a little tweaking to the
90:30 - hardware but
90:31 - uh yeah certainly
90:34 - uh yeah i'd love to make more of these i
90:38 - think uh
90:38 - you know we were of course talking about
90:40 - mutation in class
90:42 - and in my mind uh some next steps for
90:44 - this would be
90:45 - to have the growth continue for the
90:47 - plant so
90:49 - once it kind of reaches an adult stage
90:51 - it could
90:52 - develop seeds and those seeds could have
90:55 - some random mutations to the rules from
90:59 - the l system
91:00 - uh into the next generation so like over
91:02 - time it could evolve
91:04 - so um yeah it's really interesting to
91:07 - see that
91:08 - we i was just looking at um aiden's
91:10 - project and you know on the one hand you
91:12 - think these are completely
91:14 - unrelated different projects this
91:15 - infinity mirror
91:17 - and this you know small e-paper display
91:21 - but they both i think get at something
91:23 - to me that's really
91:25 - exciting about this kind of work which
91:26 - is you know especially in the last year
91:29 - we're all
91:30 - experiencing so much of you know
91:33 - graphics and chat and text and
91:35 - everything through our rectangular
91:37 - traditional
91:37 - very bright computer screens hunched
91:41 - over them
91:42 - and so there's something i think aiden's
91:44 - the infinity mirror is
91:45 - is you know is is very uh like explosive
91:49 - and exciting and dynamic and
91:51 - uh and red bloods but this has this sort
91:53 - of very like quiet and contemplative
91:55 - quality to it
91:56 - but yet it's the same algorithms and
91:58 - kind of graphical systems that
92:00 - i know from that i would see in a p5
92:03 - sketch so i think there's
92:04 - um there's i think there's some
92:06 - something really lovely about that and i
92:07 - agree i think you know
92:08 - my like my family's super into animal
92:11 - crossing
92:12 - which is so much like gardening and
92:14 - plants and stuff like that but i
92:15 - i love this idea of being able to if i
92:17 - had one to have my own
92:19 - you know little l system plant that i
92:20 - could tend to and care to
92:22 - and share with others and what does it
92:24 - mean that how is mine the same or
92:26 - different than yours and i think there's
92:28 - a lot of potential and possibilities
92:29 - there
92:30 - um and i and i and i love you know what
92:33 - yeah the idea that this is um you know
92:34 - solar powered
92:36 - um it has a kind of handmade uh quality
92:39 - to it that i think you know
92:40 - all those pieces like really work
92:41 - together conceptually as um
92:44 - within in one project which is great
92:47 - yeah thank you so much dan i love those
92:49 - thoughts
92:49 - and i think uh slowing down is something
92:53 - i've been thinking
92:54 - a lot about um and there there are other
92:57 - projects too like i
92:58 - i never show the other wall of my room
93:00 - because the zoom is always facing this
93:01 - way
93:02 - but um yeah there's uh this year moon
93:05 - day clock that i've been infatuated with
93:09 - um that similarly like makes you think
93:11 - about time on a different scale yeah
93:13 - and uh yeah i love i love that this
93:15 - project too can be
93:16 - yeah using so many new technologies but
93:18 - still um
93:20 - kind of make me slow down and and think
93:22 - about time on a different scale
93:24 - yeah wonderful awesome and so if people
93:26 - want to find out more
93:27 - and hopefully you know sign up for your
93:30 - eventual um
93:31 - crowdfunding uh campaign to produce
93:35 - millions of these
93:36 - um where should where should they go i
93:39 - guess the link's right here
93:40 - is the page yeah yeah so my name
93:42 - brandonroots.com i
93:43 - mean i'll post links there eventually uh
93:46 - or you can follow me on
93:47 - instagram be roots but yeah there's a
93:50 - link here
93:51 - for uh the blog posts showing up awesome
93:54 - thank you so much for sharing great work
93:56 - congratulations thank you dan
93:58 - yeah it's great seeing you thank you
94:02 - okay i'm moving along here let me i
94:04 - muted myself
94:07 - i'm gonna go to a welcome room here
94:13 - okay here i am ah the quiet space of the
94:16 - welcome room oh we got the coding
94:18 - train live broadcast with us again yeah
94:20 - but the
94:21 - welcome room is my place to go and like
94:23 - take a beat take a breath oh i pressed
94:25 - the wrong button
94:26 - uh like but because at one point i think
94:28 - it changed like
94:29 - there was a point where the welcome room
94:30 - was everybody was muted with camera off
94:32 - and i was like
94:34 - [Laughter]
94:37 - by the way coding trade audience
94:40 - you are looking at the uh i don't know
94:43 - what the producers
94:44 - organizers the heroes of the itp ima
94:48 - lowrise spring show
94:49 - matt and ellen how is this experience
94:52 - this is like we're flipping the script
94:53 - back you're interviewing me on lip tv
94:55 - now i'm interviewing you been a guest on
95:00 - uh
95:02 - great um no it's been really nice we've
95:06 - had so many amazing people just kind of
95:08 - show up that i hadn't met before
95:10 - um maybe some of you from coding train
95:12 - are coming and joining us and
95:14 - it's just been really nice to meet some
95:15 - new folks
95:17 - and uh yeah we've been talking to
95:18 - students and they're saying that they
95:20 - got some great conversations happening
95:22 - people kind of showing up
95:23 - and chatting and um
95:26 - i don't know ellen and i were just
95:28 - shooting for fun chaos
95:29 - yeah uh not everything crashing and
95:31 - breaking crap chaos so i think so far
95:33 - we're succeeding with uh
95:35 - yeah it's great uh you know this the way
95:38 - you've organized the spatial chat stuff
95:39 - is working
95:40 - super well um and and people in the um
95:43 - just informally in like the youtube chat
95:45 - have been really like everyone's like
95:46 - what's spatial chat who made spatial
95:48 - chat this looks so cool so i think uh
95:50 - we're doing something for the spatial
95:51 - chat company should hopefully give us a
95:53 - discount next year with all the
95:54 - promotions
96:02 - [Laughter]
96:04 - sorry ellen i think i was interrupting
96:05 - you you're about to say something
96:08 - oh just that we have one more hour of
96:10 - the show left so
96:11 - if folks want to want to come join and
96:14 - hang out
96:14 - um we'd we'd love to have you for the
96:16 - next hour yeah and i'm i'm
96:18 - i'm winding down i haven't made it to
96:20 - every room yet i'm going to try to do a
96:22 - couple more
96:22 - but i'm winding down soon so definitely
96:25 - if you're watching this
96:26 - the real experience is the spatial chat
96:30 - url that is
96:31 - in the description as well as pin to the
96:32 - chat so don't don't watch this
96:34 - banter this like exciting banter between
96:38 - very tired after a long semester
96:42 - employees of new york university you got
96:45 - to get into the real thing and get feed
96:47 - off the energy and creativity of all the
96:48 - students in their projects
96:50 - all right i'm going to wander off to the
96:51 - corner to reset the room a bit and
96:53 - figure out where i'm going next so i'll
96:55 - let you get back to your
96:56 - okay welcoming of people
97:04 - okay how we doing everybody i'm muting
97:07 - myself
97:09 - i'm just going off into the corner
97:10 - people are following me
97:13 - oh this is exhausting um there's a few
97:16 - of you still watching i'm
97:18 - um i'm getting seeing some comments here
97:20 - and there in the chat
97:21 - i'm looking at my list of projects um
97:24 - let's see oh i meant to get the live
97:27 - poll going what's the
97:30 - chance oh no this is a terrible idea
97:33 - i have this live poll system that i'm
97:35 - working on to put an overlay
97:37 - on my live streams where people can vote
97:39 - on things and i meant to actually
97:42 - test that out because i i i did it on a
97:44 - recent live stream and had all sorts of
97:46 - issues
97:46 - and thanks to um different viewers who
97:49 - have been contributing a bunch of those
97:50 - issues have been ironed out
97:52 - and i meant to i was thinking oh i could
97:54 - like have people vote but if you're in
97:56 - the chat
97:57 - well i think as i say love wonderful
97:58 - name love
98:00 - um has asked a question how long have
98:03 - you been a professor
98:04 - for well the first class that i taught
98:08 - um formally uh was paid to teach at a
98:11 - university so i guess that's
98:13 - the measurement was in 2004. um at that
98:16 - time i taught as an adjunct
98:18 - um and then a few years later i had a
98:21 - full-time
98:22 - teaching position um and i've had
98:24 - various iterations of that
98:26 - over the years but i have now been
98:28 - associated with this
98:30 - program this department at nyu for
98:33 - um a little over 20 years now or 20
98:35 - years exactly because i started in 2001.
98:38 - um all right so that answered that
98:42 - question
98:43 - um let's see so i would like to if
98:45 - you're in the chat there
98:47 - is play games education which i'm really
98:50 - keen on going to that's probably my next
98:51 - stop
98:53 - machine learning perform performance
98:56 - grab bag and
98:58 - installation slash ar so let me know in
99:01 - the chat
99:02 - if you have you can see the rooms here
99:06 - if you have a preference as to where i
99:09 - should go but i think i'm probably going
99:11 - ahead
99:12 - to play games animation there's a
99:15 - project
99:16 - there that i think is of great interest
99:18 - to coding trained viewers
99:19 - called b5 you might recognize b5 yes i'm
99:22 - saying b
99:23 - as in uh bagel not uh
99:26 - uh uh uh pea as in processing
99:29 - uh but maybe that'll be my last stop
99:31 - because honestly like i haven't
99:33 - it's 9 40 at night it was been a very
99:35 - busy day i kind of only had a bit of
99:37 - like a snack for dinner and i'm really
99:39 - starting to feel that pain right now
99:41 - um so i think i want to like allow
99:43 - myself to go to one more room
99:45 - and then kind of wrap up for the night
99:47 - how's everybody how's everybody okay
99:48 - with that
99:49 - so let's head over to play games
99:52 - education here we go
99:55 - and where am i i never know where i am
99:59 - when i drop into a page here people
100:03 - i'm gonna mute them
100:07 - where
100:13 - where am i
100:17 - is this me no here i am that's me oh i'm
100:20 - in b5
100:23 - that's where i was going
100:27 - uh hold on a sec uh hello uh
100:30 - this is a live broadcast as i uh
100:33 - i see people running for the hills which
100:35 - again is the appropriate reaction
100:39 - uh but you're welcome to stay um so i'm
100:42 - i'm wandering around i'm on the tail end
100:43 - here i've been seeing a lot of projects
100:45 - and
100:45 - my my mind is turning a little bit to
100:47 - mush but i know that this particular
100:49 - project would be of great interest to
100:51 - coding trained viewers
100:52 - with the connection to creative coding
100:54 - uh you can see sort of b5 and
100:56 - how uh as an upside down p looks like uh
100:59 - there p5
101:00 - um paling i wonder if you could take if
101:02 - you if you have some time
101:04 - to introduce yourself and talk a little
101:05 - bit about this project
101:08 - uh yeah sure so i'm a graduating ima
101:11 - student and also
101:12 - incoming itp student um so this is my
101:16 - capstone project for ima and
101:18 - it's called b5 and it's like a visual
101:21 - programming language for creative coding
101:23 - so visual programming language is
101:25 - basically people use like
101:26 - wires and box instead of lines of code
101:29 - to
101:30 - to make programs um and b5 particularly
101:34 - and focused on creative coding so uh
101:36 - it's like a visual
101:38 - version of p5 and and i hope it's more
101:42 - intuitive and more
101:43 - playful and easier to learn than p5 and
101:48 - yeah so people can kind of get get their
101:50 - hands on it
101:51 - more easily and use it for like learning
101:53 - and fast prototyping
101:55 - and with when they want to learn like
101:57 - creative coding
102:02 - amazing i thought i thought i was muted
102:03 - i'm like looking for my unmute button
102:05 - but i think you can hear me
102:06 - um wonderful uh super exciting to see um
102:08 - so i guess i have a couple questions
102:10 - one is um you know my
102:13 - you know there's a lot of parallels here
102:14 - obviously it's a very different project
102:16 - as well but parallels to
102:17 - things something like scratch which is
102:19 - block based
102:21 - as well as other like data flow
102:23 - environments like max msp jitter
102:25 - scratch being more geared to younger
102:27 - audiences
102:29 - max msp jitter being to sort of you know
102:31 - i don't know if this is accurate to say
102:33 - but
102:33 - uh you know sort of like audio audio
102:36 - video uh advanced users maybe
102:38 - um is there um if you see that the
102:41 - audience for
102:42 - what you're building here is um
102:45 - intersects with p5 users but is it about
102:48 - a different age group or a different way
102:50 - of thinking like how do you
102:51 - differentiate that in your mind what's
102:53 - the
102:53 - i guess if i were to i'm like rambling i
102:55 - can't ask a question in one sentence i
102:56 - really need to
102:57 - like work on that but my question is who
102:59 - is your desired audience for this
103:02 - yeah yeah yeah so so you mentioned
103:04 - scratch and also like more advanced
103:06 - tools like
103:07 - max mxp and so so
103:10 - to me b5 is more like a midpoint uh
103:14 - of those two kinds of projects so uh
103:17 - products so so like in terms of design
103:20 - um it's kind of like a mix of
103:24 - node-based and block-based visual
103:25 - programming languages
103:27 - so so scratch is like a blog based so
103:30 - it's it's like you there's still like
103:32 - lines of code
103:33 - but they're like wrapped in blocks and
103:35 - you play with the blocks
103:36 - and for max it's like node base so to
103:39 - kind of connect the blocks with your
103:41 - with your wires and b5 is kind of like a
103:44 - mix of them
103:46 - so it's node based so you still have
103:48 - like separate blocks
103:49 - but also the location of the blocks
103:52 - still matters so so when you place a
103:55 - block like
103:56 - kind of like uh before another block uh
103:59 - their execution order will change so so
104:03 - so this is a particular design that is
104:05 - very special to b5 so you can
104:07 - kind of play with your code or like
104:09 - tweaks a little bit
104:11 - and to to have a like totally different
104:13 - like
104:14 - an effect and also um in terms of
104:17 - like the target users as you mentioned
104:19 - so scratches for like kids or
104:22 - like people who have no experience in
104:24 - programming
104:25 - and like there's definitely a lot of
104:28 - like
104:29 - very advanced or powerful visual
104:31 - programming languages
104:33 - and b5 is uh kind of also like in
104:36 - between so we want to
104:38 - so so i i try to make it like as simple
104:41 - and user friendly as possible
104:43 - follows i i'm trying to kind of give it
104:45 - some power so it can be used for like
104:47 - serious production
104:49 - and also for like a lot of uh you know
104:52 - creative coding projects and also for
104:54 - fast prototyping
104:55 - yeah and that's been the spirit i think
104:57 - of uh of you know the processing project
104:59 - certainly since the beginning
105:01 - it's very challenging to kind of like
105:03 - balance
105:04 - all these different trade-offs of
105:06 - different audiences but
105:07 - having a tool that is both something
105:09 - that people can get started with
105:11 - very quickly and easily and kind of see
105:13 - results immediately on their sort of
105:15 - first day
105:16 - or first five minutes even as well as
105:19 - that has depth to it and allows you to
105:21 - sort of build larger
105:22 - more involved projects um it's really
105:26 - uh is is really a wonderful sweet spot
105:30 - for these kind of creative coding tools
105:31 - and frameworks so it's great to see that
105:32 - you're kind of
105:33 - exploring exploring that um through this
105:36 - project
105:37 - so i see that you it's you know here on
105:39 - the you know i guess it's to the
105:41 - the right of me left me who knows what
105:43 - direction that is or
105:45 - everything's mirrored and backwards but
105:46 - there's the people can actually just go
105:48 - ahead and try it right now
105:49 - um um and are there what's what are your
105:52 - kind of like next steps for the project
105:54 - i know when we've talked about this
105:55 - before like we've talked about like
105:56 - sort of user testing and like you know
105:58 - sort of longer term roadmap for the
106:00 - project where are you
106:01 - kind of in the journey of it and what
106:03 - sort of like how can people who might be
106:05 - watching like help help out or get
106:07 - involved
106:08 - yeah so uh so first thing for for me of
106:12 - course is continue debugging it
106:14 - so although it's like live right now
106:16 - it's still very buggy and your pro
106:18 - so so it's very not recommended for for
106:20 - alexa's production right now
106:22 - using it and so i'll definitely add more
106:25 - like
106:26 - some basic features to it and also for
106:28 - people who
106:30 - who are interested in this project and
106:31 - also want to contribute
106:33 - uh the best way is probably to design a
106:35 - blog for yourself
106:37 - so you can find like how to design
106:39 - blocking the redmi file in the github
106:41 - repo
106:42 - and it's actually very easy to to kind
106:44 - of design a block and just like push it
106:46 - to
106:47 - the ripple and i guess that's uh the
106:50 - most meaningful or
106:51 - like the most wonky way for for for
106:54 - contributors to contribute to this
106:56 - project right now so designing a block
106:57 - would be something like
106:59 - if um like this might already be
107:01 - implemented but like if they're
107:02 - if purlin noise wasn't available as a
107:05 - block that
107:06 - um i could contribute sort of like code
107:09 - in
107:09 - presumably javascript to write the code
107:11 - for that block you know
107:12 - yeah embed the perlin noise algorithm
107:14 - into it and then
107:16 - that would become part of b5 that people
107:18 - could get have inputs and outputs from
107:19 - that block is that the idea
107:21 - right right yes yes yes and so you can
107:23 - define
107:24 - like the the style of the block the
107:27 - the input output nodes what are they and
107:29 - their descriptions
107:30 - and yeah so so i have a like kind of
107:33 - like a template for that and you can
107:35 - just like put putting those information
107:37 - if i render block for you wonderful
107:40 - awesome
107:40 - cool that's very exciting uh great work
107:42 - it's super exciting to
107:43 - to see and if um i guess if people um
107:46 - have questions or they find issues with
107:48 - it
107:48 - posting in the sort of issues on the
107:50 - github page is that the best place for
107:52 - feedback and questions uh yes definitely
107:55 - awesome all right so everyone please
107:57 - check out and give a b5
107:58 - editor.app a try um and you can join you
108:02 - can check out the github repo and more
108:03 - info about
108:04 - paling's work at his website there
108:06 - thanks so much for sharing this with us
108:07 - thank you thank you
108:12 - okay i just heard you
108:15 - this is my new technique when i need to
108:17 - like sort of have a momentary break here
108:20 - is just turn off my camera and mute my
108:22 - microphone
108:23 - all right so let's have let me zoom out
108:25 - here and see what we can see
108:27 - um hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy
108:29 - inner oracle
108:30 - itp sandbox
108:33 - and soul train machine says i'll be
108:36 - right back i was kind of wanted to see
108:38 - this
108:38 - all-terrain machine but it says i'll be
108:40 - right back so i think we have to wait
108:43 - um i'm looking for oh
108:46 - sub to vizio let's um i think this is
108:48 - i'm trying to hit some low res
108:50 - projects so that's also uh let's see if
108:52 - we can wander over here
108:54 - let me let me turn my camera back on
108:57 - um and mute myself
109:01 - and let's see if i can zoom in
109:06 - hello uh i'm a a live broadcast visitor
109:12 - is this is this project open for
109:14 - business
109:16 - okay hi adam nice to see you um so for
109:19 - anybody who's just kind of oops let me
109:21 - remove myself
109:22 - in this way um who is um a wandering
109:25 - nearby
109:26 - i'm a simul casting this uh spatial chat
109:29 - room to
109:30 - uh to youtube wandering through various
109:32 - projects
109:33 - and uh adam here has graciously just
109:36 - spontaneously agreed to
109:38 - to share his work so if uh could you
109:40 - would if you have a minute to introduce
109:41 - yourself and talk about
109:42 - a subdivisio exclamation point i'd love
109:44 - to hear about it
110:52 - it's starting to there's a little bit
110:54 - you can vary just
110:55 - at this point um and if i subdivide it
110:59 - again
111:00 - then it's taking oops each of those
111:03 - sorry i'm
111:05 - i've done a horrible thing which is that
111:07 - i had an
111:08 - audio glitch the last couple of minutes
111:12 - and so you're on oh it wasn't going
111:14 - through i
111:15 - hate to make you start all the way over
111:18 - um but i have that fixed now if you want
111:20 - to you're welcome to
111:22 - con to but yeah no uh but but yeah so
111:26 - sorry about that i wonder if you could
111:27 - just kind of
111:28 - circle back to the beginning of what you
111:29 - were uh uh
111:31 - explaining for the project sure take it
111:34 - uh go all the way back to the top or
111:36 - just start talking about the project
111:37 - yeah go introduce yourself again because
111:39 - i think uh
111:40 - it's great for people to get to know
111:41 - about your um work and where you're
111:43 - coming from
111:44 - if you don't mind yeah no problem all
111:46 - right cool
111:47 - um yeah so i'm adam colstock i'm a a
111:50 - computer science and a steam teacher in
111:53 - chicago for fourth through eighth
111:55 - graders
111:56 - uh and i've created on my um in the low
111:59 - res ima program
112:00 - um the first class of it about to
112:02 - graduate this summer
112:04 - uh so i've created subdivisio which is
112:07 - a tool that allows you to explore
112:09 - algorithmic art
112:11 - using one particular subdivision
112:13 - algorithm
112:15 - and so i can sort of just quickly walk
112:18 - through what what's happening with that
112:20 - um so the idea is you've got a
112:22 - four-sided shape that you start with
112:24 - and then you can divide it up once using
112:27 - this top slider
112:29 - so the division that it's doing is it's
112:31 - taking one point along the top edge and
112:33 - one point along
112:34 - the left edge and the opposite vertex
112:38 - from those two edges
112:39 - and it's connecting those up along a
112:41 - point that lies along the diagonal
112:44 - and so if i uh start to drag that point
112:48 - then it varies the design because these
112:51 - two points are both dependent on
112:53 - the position of the top point sort of
112:55 - how far along the line it is uh what
112:58 - proportion of the line it takes up
113:00 - and if i divide it again then it took
113:03 - each of those three cells and applied
113:06 - the same rule so this top cell here
113:09 - took two points along the edge and the
113:11 - opposite vertex
113:12 - and the same for the other one even
113:14 - though it's not a square it's a
113:16 - different kind of
113:17 - uh four-sided shape um it's doing the
113:19 - same rule
113:21 - but already at this point i can start to
113:22 - play around with the design a little bit
113:24 - so rather than using that same
113:26 - orientation for the first cell i can
113:28 - rotate it
113:29 - so you can see that that line that's
113:31 - connecting into the vertex
113:32 - is changing which orientation it has
113:36 - you could do that for any of the cells
113:38 - and then you can also
113:40 - add color um and
113:44 - so applying multiple subdivisions you
113:47 - start to get
113:48 - uh some patterns that emerge that you
113:50 - can play with by changing the color
113:53 - um of it and it has some elements of
113:56 - transparency so you can start to control
113:59 - what
113:59 - points are what colors are shining
114:01 - through
114:03 - and then the last thing i think that's a
114:05 - little bit interesting
114:06 - is right now it's all dependent on
114:09 - this top point um so if this line
114:13 - if this point is halfway so is this
114:15 - point
114:16 - and that point um but i could imagine
114:19 - those
114:19 - points not being tied to each other in
114:21 - terms of how far along the lines up they
114:23 - are so you can
114:24 - change the number of draggable points so
114:27 - if i have two
114:28 - then the top one becomes independent
114:31 - from the one over here
114:33 - and one middle is still dependent on the
114:35 - top one
114:36 - or you could have it so that all three
114:38 - points are independent so you can sort
114:40 - of
114:41 - play around yeah the design even more
114:43 - that way
114:45 - wow i can imagine just being sort of
114:47 - like hypnotized and you know i i i might
114:50 - often when i'm working on like a code
114:51 - example or something i can i can just
114:53 - spend
114:54 - hours and hours tweaking little like
114:56 - parameters and numbers and i i could
114:58 - really imagine having that kind of rich
114:59 - experience with this
115:01 - um i guess one thing i'm curious about
115:02 - especially with your background as a
115:04 - teacher
115:05 - um one is there a particular
115:09 - i mean i obviously i think this has a
115:11 - very wide audience like i would enjoy
115:12 - this as much as a fourth grader might
115:13 - enjoy this
115:14 - but um yeah is there a particular i
115:17 - guess i'm curious was there a particular
115:19 - like age group or kind of uh
115:22 - you know curriculum like my daughter who
115:24 - happens to be in fourth gr fourth grade
115:25 - came home today and said i learned
115:27 - decimals today
115:28 - so is there a particular um like topic
115:31 - and either
115:32 - math or uh geometry or computer science
115:35 - that this like
115:36 - specifically relates to from your
115:37 - teaching practice or um where did you
115:39 - get the idea for this i guess is kind of
115:41 - one way of asking the question
115:42 - yeah let me start with that question
115:44 - actually and then i can cycle around
115:46 - to the first one so i got the idea um
115:49 - i've been teaching uh for about 10 years
115:52 - or so
115:53 - and since i started teaching there's um
115:58 - software called dynamic geometry
116:00 - software um
116:01 - keyometer sketchpad is one example
116:03 - geogebra is an online version
116:05 - um and they really take advantage of the
116:07 - idea that
116:08 - uh there's all sorts of interesting
116:10 - geometric explorations you can do
116:13 - in a learning environment in which you
116:16 - can create geometric constructions by
116:18 - drawing points and lines
116:20 - and identifying relationships and
116:22 - constraints like things are parallel or
116:24 - defining particular angles
116:26 - but then dragging so that the things
116:29 - that have those relationships maintain
116:31 - them
116:31 - but those that can can very do and you
116:34 - can start to sort of
116:36 - see and explore different kinds of
116:37 - representations even like what the
116:39 - difference between
116:41 - an isosceles and an equilateral triangle
116:43 - is by
116:44 - um you know making it so two sides are
116:48 - the same length and then dragging any of
116:50 - the three points and seeing what's
116:51 - staying the same and what's changing
116:53 - different
116:54 - and you can be doing that with kids that
116:56 - are sort of in elementary school so i
116:57 - had that software
116:59 - um we would use it for some lessons um
117:01 - but i also started to like
117:02 - mess around and sort of create more
117:04 - artistic designs with it
117:06 - and i really enjoyed that um so one of
117:09 - the answers to the question is i'm
117:11 - interested in
117:12 - just a tool that will provide sort of a
117:14 - bridge between visual arts and
117:16 - mathematics so
117:17 - maybe you're coming to it with a visual
117:19 - arts background and you haven't really
117:21 - um thought about programming or
117:24 - algorithms much before
117:25 - um but you could step in and use this
117:27 - tool and it might sort of change about
117:29 - uh change how you think about what
117:32 - you're creating or maybe even lead you
117:34 - to want to like learn more about
117:35 - this kind of thing or you might be a
117:38 - programmer or mathematician someone that
117:39 - really enjoys numbers and then
117:41 - programming
117:42 - but haven't done much in the visual arts
117:44 - and you could come in and sort of see
117:46 - how some of the things that you're
117:47 - familiar with are being implied and
117:49 - applied in a visual thinking kind of way
117:52 - um
117:52 - so i think that's like my main
117:53 - motivation you know independent of age
117:56 - even
117:57 - um but uh
118:00 - certainly i i like the idea that
118:03 - um i teach at a school where we try and
118:07 - do things in an
118:08 - interdisciplinary way um so you know
118:12 - being able to come with up with a
118:13 - project that has
118:15 - an artistic output but which you could
118:18 - be
118:19 - exploring you know even with this one
118:22 - the idea that like
118:23 - how are these lines how are these points
118:25 - related they're the same
118:26 - proportion along each line so what is
118:29 - you know what does that mean for them to
118:31 - be the same proportion along the line um
118:34 - that could lead into something about the
118:36 - golden ratio if you wanted to or there's
118:38 - all kinds of directions
118:39 - you can take different things like that
118:41 - i i haven't
118:42 - been there to this place that i'm about
118:44 - to mention in a while because you know
118:46 - it's been
118:47 - a year of coronavirus but um
118:50 - the museum of math here in new york um
118:53 - has a lot of exhibits that i think kind
118:55 - of like strike a really nice balance
118:56 - there
118:57 - of being able to kind of just play
119:00 - um in a really sort of create playful
119:02 - creative uh
119:04 - um improvisational way um
119:08 - uh but kind of also and tying those to
119:10 - specific
119:11 - um kind of well-known algorithms or
119:13 - techniques and kind of
119:14 - wandering back and forth between
119:16 - thinking about the math behind something
119:18 - versus just
119:19 - enjoying the sort of aesthetic quality
119:21 - and the sort of like surprise and
119:22 - discovery of it so i could really
119:24 - imagine
119:25 - um this project um working really well
119:28 - in you know that's what you know i think
119:29 - just being on the web is like in many
119:31 - ways just like the perfect place for it
119:32 - but also um like being in uh a kind of
119:36 - context like
119:36 - like the museum of math um um it really
119:40 - would fit right into that kind of space
119:41 - so
119:42 - great work and so if folks want to try
119:44 - it out i see the
119:45 - the best place is just to go right to
119:46 - the link that's right here there's a
119:48 - video
119:49 - um and um and yeah is there any any
119:52 - other
119:52 - links that people should go to or know
119:53 - about if they want to like learn more
119:54 - about this work or you
119:56 - uh no at this point those are the the
119:59 - two most direct links
120:00 - i would say about a month or so from now
120:02 - it'll probably all be put together
120:04 - in a website for you know my uh thesis
120:07 - project
120:08 - but uh for now those are the the best
120:10 - way to be able to explore it a little
120:12 - bit awesome
120:12 - great all right so this is i forget that
120:14 - with the for the low-res
120:16 - uh uh program um you're you while
120:19 - while this is the end of a semester
120:20 - there's like a big thing happening this
120:22 - summer which is like
120:23 - really more of the culmination so it's
120:25 - exciting to hear that you'll be
120:26 - continuing to work on this and i can't
120:27 - wait to
120:28 - uh follow and see where it leads great
120:31 - thanks wonderful
120:32 - thank you so much for sharing sure no
120:34 - problem
120:38 - okay i have muted and i'm wandering
120:42 - zooming out let's see
120:46 - soul train machine is back i think we
120:48 - should finish off with soul train
120:52 - machine
121:07 - bye is it okay if i barge on in here
121:10 - with my giant live broadcast
121:12 - sign yes oh my god
121:15 - that [ __ ] then um
121:18 - i'm uh i'm i'm running on empty here
121:21 - running on fumes here i've been kind of
121:22 - like wandering around
121:23 - yeah but i i thought i saw i saw
121:26 - soul train machine i thought this could
121:28 - be a way to complete the circle of this
121:32 - strange evening in spatial chat so um
121:37 - um yeah so in case anybody who's happens
121:40 - to be nearby i'm kind of simulcasting
121:42 - this
121:43 - um on youtube to a small audience right
121:45 - now um
121:46 - kind of wandering around so feel free to
121:49 - some people have
121:50 - done the appropriate reaction of just
121:51 - run away it seems like i'm near them
121:53 - but mary hopefully you'll stay um would
121:55 - you mind do you have a minute to
121:56 - introduce yourself and tell us a little
121:58 - bit about
121:58 - this project to take us out of this uh
122:02 - what's the what's the word to like close
122:04 - it's not the end of the evening because
122:05 - i know this is going on for 30 more
122:07 - minutes but
122:08 - yeah that's like as i hear my your your
122:10 - broadcast yes my bro
122:11 - yes thank you it would be my pleasure so
122:14 - my name is mary no terry i am a
122:17 - graduating itp
122:18 - second year and uh the project i'm
122:21 - presenting tonight
122:22 - is the first in a series of prototypes
122:26 - that i will be making
122:27 - over the next few months uh that i'm
122:29 - building towards what i'm calling the
122:31 - soul train
122:32 - machine so when i say soul train i mean
122:34 - soul train
122:35 - like the long-running
122:38 - tv show where people showed off their
122:41 - amazing moves and
122:42 - new music in new fashion and so this is
122:46 - a project that's very much grounded
122:47 - in the vocabulary
122:52 - of that style of funk soul disco
122:55 - so i used the ml5 neural network
122:59 - to train a an algorithm
123:02 - on some very basic disco moves that i
123:05 - just did in front of the camera
123:07 - uh in or this in order to do this
123:09 - prototype
123:10 - so the two moves are and you can go to
123:13 - the link up here
123:14 - uh and test it out yourself but the two
123:16 - the moves are
123:18 - uh like a snap up here a roll
123:21 - and a like head shape like a tina turner
123:25 - style head shake
123:27 - um and at the moment the
123:30 - what i'm building towards is having
123:32 - those be
123:33 - triggers for musical events at the
123:36 - moment
123:37 - the musical events are mostly just
123:38 - triggered by pressing a button
123:40 - uh but there are some sliders where it's
123:42 - like if you're closer to the camera
123:44 - it gets uh clearer there's a low-pass
123:48 - filter
123:48 - or if you go up and down the volume goes
123:50 - up and down
123:52 - um but the idea is yeah to turn this
123:55 - into a standalone
123:58 - web app where a couple of people
124:02 - can join in and control music through
124:05 - their
124:06 - groovy dance moves
124:11 - awesome and so this can be tried out
124:13 - right now at this very moment
124:15 - just by going to that link that's right
124:17 - there oh i just clicked on it okay hold
124:19 - on
124:20 - i'm i'm gonna save this i'm gonna uh oh
124:23 - my goodness
124:24 - okay i'm going to uh i'm coming back to
124:26 - spatial chat
124:28 - uh i'm gonna go that'll be a perfect
124:29 - thing for me to test and try you know
124:31 - one of the things
124:32 - um that i that i've actually like um
124:34 - that i find to be a challenge with
124:36 - um some of these systems that do pose
124:39 - detection especially on the web
124:40 - oh my goodness and i think my i have to
124:42 - actually close this because my computer
124:44 - is about to
124:45 - freak out um is that people use their
124:48 - computer like the way that i'm
124:50 - right now which is kind of like hunched
124:52 - over it
124:53 - like with my face next to the laptop
124:55 - whereas this really
124:56 - is about i'm imagining and it strikes me
124:59 - from your description of the sort of
125:00 - like
125:01 - full body um you know like let it all
125:04 - out kind of experience and i
125:06 - you know i know that you know to the
125:07 - extent that you that you're still in
125:09 - development with this
125:10 - like is that something that um do you
125:12 - have any have you been have you tested
125:14 - with people is that
125:15 - something that you've sort of thought
125:16 - about of how to like uh sort of onboard
125:19 - people
125:19 - into being in the right sort of like
125:21 - physical space and mindset
125:23 - for it or oh that's a really good
125:26 - question
125:27 - and i haven't gotten to the stage of
125:29 - user testing inside of
125:31 - me and my roommates so we will see
125:34 - and we're all pretty out there people to
125:36 - begin with
125:37 - um but that's something that i'm
125:39 - definitely gonna have to keep in mind
125:40 - and i think uh i guess
125:44 - i also am aiming to create an uh
125:48 - a browser-based experience that is
125:52 - if that evokes uh a certain
125:55 - like time and space like time and place
125:58 - uh
125:59 - and i this is kind of for people who
126:02 - like me
126:11 - um and so uh
126:15 - but that's i really appreciate that
126:16 - question because
126:18 - i have a tendency to design for myself
126:20 - sometime yeah
126:22 - well it's a great way to start i don't
126:25 - know
126:25 - it's yeah it's just something that like
126:27 - i've just i've spent a lot of time
126:29 - working with the post-detection stuff as
126:30 - you probably
126:31 - uh um no and so like it's it's something
126:34 - that's sort of like always top of mind
126:35 - for me but i
126:36 - i love i just like like i think you have
126:39 - a successful
126:40 - interactive web-based project if you can
126:44 - get people to like
126:45 - stand up and move their whole body like
126:46 - it's such a nice like goal
126:48 - to like to break people out of um kind
126:51 - of their
126:51 - just sort of default way of sitting
126:53 - engaging in their computer so that's
126:55 - super it's super cool and exciting to
126:56 - see and i i i i
126:58 - i'm so thrilled and excited to see as a
127:01 - nice note to end on to sort of see
127:03 - uh the ml5 neural network and the
127:05 - posenet um machine learning model which
127:07 - are two things that i've spent a lot of
127:08 - time
127:09 - like banging on for um the last uh bunch
127:12 - of years so it's
127:13 - great it's really exciting to see those
127:14 - applied in a project here
127:17 - and i have to thank you for banging on
127:19 - them i have to thank you
127:21 - very very much for saving my rump
127:24 - in more than like in terms of making
127:26 - this work
127:27 - so thank you awesome well
127:30 - congratulations
127:31 - um i'm gonna what i'm gonna do actually
127:32 - this is perfect i'm gonna see if i can
127:34 - get it to work with me as i leave as i
127:37 - launch
127:43 - um and off into um
127:47 - it's like way past my bedtime this is
127:49 - insane that it's after 10 o'clock at
127:50 - night all of a sudden
127:51 - so thank you so much for sharing this
127:54 - congratulations on all of your
127:56 - work and accomplishments at itp and i
127:58 - i'm i'm excited to see what comes next
128:01 - thank you so much awesome okay bye mary
128:05 - okay so here i am i'm moving up here i'm
128:07 - muting
128:08 - turning off my camera let's see i i feel
128:11 - like no i feel like i'm completely
128:13 - by myself here let's bring this back
128:15 - nope bring this back nope yep here we
128:17 - are
128:17 - all right we're going to click on it try
128:19 - it for ourselves
128:21 - i'm going to close out a spatial chat
128:24 - and let's see let's play some sounds
128:31 - um i have all sorts of computer issues
128:36 - so let's see i hear my children getting
128:39 - ready for pet dumpsters
128:41 - let's try now let's try let's get ready
128:44 - to boogie
128:50 - do i need to like oh you know what it's
128:51 - not getting my camera
128:53 - hold on we're gonna re we're gonna quit
128:55 - chrome
128:56 - we're to quit obs we're gonna leave loop
128:58 - back open because i need that for the
129:00 - audio
129:01 - come on everybody we're gonna make this
129:02 - happen
129:08 - there we go there we go
129:18 - i don't know if i can hear the audio but
129:20 - it might be my
129:21 - uh issue with my audio it's all weird
129:24 - wonky
129:25 - chrome is on headphones are on
129:28 - going out to you this week after all
129:30 - right let's see let's see
129:32 - okay we're getting up
129:35 - okay here we are snaps
129:38 - roll okay hold on i got some music here
129:52 - maybe this is better
129:57 - what's become of my life
130:13 - all right oh it's bedtime we're this old
130:15 - man
130:16 - oh you can't hear the audio
130:20 - oh no that's probably from the past well
130:22 - this was
130:23 - fun mary i'm so sorry
130:26 - for everything that i've done
130:32 - this is really fun i'm i'm wondering why
130:35 - um if uh if if maybe i missed something
130:39 - with this the audio here
130:41 - but um i'll just assume
130:46 - that i'm doing something wrong here
130:48 - anyway
130:52 - this has been quite the live stream
130:57 - some nice relaxing music here
131:01 - uh thank you all for um
131:04 - tuning into this with me i'm gonna um
131:07 - [Music]
131:09 - just remind you that for the next 20
131:11 - minutes
131:13 - you can go and experience it for
131:15 - yourself
131:17 - the itp ima
131:20 - low res spring show 2021.
131:23 - congratulations
131:24 - to all of the amazing students and staff
131:28 - and faculty and everybody who's worked
131:30 - so hard
131:31 - all year all semester boy it's been a
131:33 - year an academic year
131:35 - summer is here we all hopefully will be
131:38 - on the beach with our ukuleles
131:40 - where's the link um
131:44 - but i believe you can go to i know
131:50 - if you're here watching this right now
131:52 - then all you need to do
131:54 - is go right to this link right here
131:57 - i might pop back in there without the
131:59 - pressure and stress of live streaming
132:03 - um oh is the chrome tap itself muted
132:06 - says love it's possible
132:08 - please everybody try out the soul train
132:10 - machine
132:12 - go visit the show i'll be back on
132:15 - thursday for a coding stream
132:19 - i've got some updates and different
132:21 - things to show and demo

Cleaned transcript:

well hello there everyone i am just doing a quick mic check i will be getting started in approximately one minute and six seconds let me know in the chat if you can hear the audio just fine this is not your usual coding live stream tonight this is a broadcast of the itp ima lores at nyu tisch school of the arts spring 2021 show so i'll explain more about that once i get started sorry about that one more minute until i get started one more song here to play do do hello and happy tuesday evening i'm here at my desk prepare to broadcast the news no not the news i'm actually here to broadcast the itp ima low res spring show of 2021 a festival of the recently possible now here's the thing typically um in the past if you've ever seen one of my biannual it's biannual twice a year or every other year you let me know in the chat but twice a year i will broadcast uh the show of the wonderful students from the itp ima and now low res program at tisch school of the arts new york university located right here where i am sitting in brooklyn new york typically this is a live inperson show and i'm wandering around with a mobile camera trying to somehow like do all of my internet wifi dances properly so that the stream can broadcast but um here we are once again uh now i think this is the third time that the itp ima lores show is online but it's pretty different today so what i'm doing right now is is kind of in some sense useless because what i really would much prefer that you do i would you know you're not supposed to say this when you're live streaming or making a video but turn this off and go and to and join the show yourself so i need to figure out um i'm going i think if i take this link no i'm in the wrong place ah no i'm good no wrong yes i think i can do this sorry i'm about to put into the chat um and hopefully you're not gonna hear this good i'm about to paste into the chat the link to the show itself i'm typing this now you're actually seeing this like way before you're gonna hear me say this because of the way the delay is i don't know what's the future what's the past but that's the actual link that you can go and join the show yourself i'm actually going to also edit the video and just go to the video description and paste the link now in the video description i'm going to hit save so if you were to refresh the page that you're on um in addition to seeing the link in the chat um and i don't know youtube is like yelling at me like it's not it's got an error but let's see if this worked yes so now in this video's description is the link to the actual show itself so in just a moment i'm going to go in there myself and show you how it all works where you can find the project where you can chat with the creators of the project then i will continue to stream and wander around but you could experience this stream in your own way just by being in the show itself i'm just checking out the chat um saying hello to tom g who says hello saying hello to wucha and thomas smith and gregor biennial versus biannual biennial like the venice biennale is every two years by annual every six months i really hope i can remember that in the future because i would love to be able to call upon that knowledge when needed because i is there an equivalent for biweekly is there by weekly by bimonthly by i don't know carson is here hey all right so um let's throw caution to the wind and just get started with what um i don't know i don't have a lot of other stuff to say i could talk about you know coding train news and updates there will be a regularly scheduled live stream this thursday but i'm going to switch over here and i am now uh in uh spatial chat itself so uh if you might remember that last time i live streamed a uh online version of the itbiamalorez show we were using something called yorb um without by accident going into oh wait i can hear somebody i thought the oh oh oh oh i thought that the microphones were disabled in this room but i guess if you're a host it's not i've i've stopped i've muted the audio so you can't hear it i gotta go i gotta i gotta go to a different welcome room this is too destructive wait no i can do this great all right here we are yorb was a 3d world created by um a bunch of developers and artists and students and researchers at the itb program itself spatial chat from what i understand is a third party commercial system i think there's a way to use it for free but let's see if i can kind of like walk you through how spatial chat works so basically the way that it works is and you can see here this is um there's a whole bunch of rooms and soon i'm gonna start going into the rooms to view the various projects but we can look here and sort of see um how it works so audio and video is spatial so this is me right now i can move myself around notice how these other circles get larger and smaller if we were in a room where the audio and video was not disabled then we would see the video appear as we got closer and disappear as we got further the audio would get louder and quieter depending on our distance um the other thing we can note here is that each room has a theme six projects in each room each project has their own area labeled with the name and project title so this is what it's going to look like i wonder if i can zoom in any further on this i can do my own zoom so we're going to start to move around and find projects and there'll be videos being shared and there's the creators of the project will be there that i can interview and ask some questions um um you can see here you if you if you join right here's the url once again it's in the chat and i don't think i pinned it let me pin it in the chat and replace the pin message so now that's pinned you can find the url right there is anybody watching right now are any of you in welcome room a are these any of your circles floating around i would be excited and hello to grant from utah utah the time zone that this is meant for perhaps because i know a lot of the viewers that regular viewers of the coding train or in europe or asia and other parts of the world and plenty of other uh places that just are it's you know the middle of the night are quite late right now so thank you to anyone who happens to be tuning in let's see what else we can find out help and map um navigate the directory uh and desk for the project map you will also find helpers if you have questions or need support by the way uh let's see how many people do i have um vicky lou says that they are there let's see if we can find vicky this is where i am oh no no wait this is where i am vicki come over near here and let's see your icon now of course once i actually start guarding the rooms with audio and video i might not be so encouraging of you to come and interrupt but yeah you should you should come and say i'm just slightly afraid of the live broadcast aspect of doing this um is anybody from itp ima or lores watching this right now if you are say hi in the chat but really come on go into the spatial chat so i've been told that there's a limit of 500 people on the spatial chat and i um i kind of have a personal mission to see if we can get it above 500. i can see right now there are 89 people watching this stream or um which is um a wonderful amazing number of people if i'm being honest but also a little bit lower than i usually will have for a live stream probably the time uh is a little bit of a barrier there for a lot of people but um wessie is there um and maybe this is oh that's wesley um and i i don't know where did i go here i am so all right so let's go we're now in welcome room hey i gotta ease my way in i mean welcome room a i'm gonna ease my way in and um uh yes and i see also just just to respond to carson in the chat who writes i really should be doing college right now what does it mean to do college by the way i would like to do college that sounds like fun i did i did college once upon a time many moons ago oh boy i'm old okay i really should be doing college right now but maybe i could watch your streams more during the summer yes first of all take care of yourself take care of your own wellbeing drink water rest take care of your work study be with your friends and family and loved ones and then if you happen to have a little bit of extra time left over you could join a coding train stream that's what i would say that should be your priority list um and algeria is in the house zach from algeria and uh christopher chenier all right we're getting some announcements actually let's tune into these announcements the the projects in those rooms i believe there's just a little bit of a check of the audio do you hear both of the announcements that's going on and me and then to navigate you can actually move your bubble around um the closer you get to somebody the louder the sound is it's almost as if i'm actually sitting in these seats um and then you can also move this if you click on the background marvel give me a call look at these special effects i've got going and if you want to unmute if you have any questions feel free to unmute yourself as well okay we're going to welcome room b right now and i'm going to mute the spatial uh chat audio all right when welcome room b oh i guess the welcome rooms all have the same thing welcome room c i somehow i imagine the welcome rooms had different images um so okay maybe maybe just maybe we're ready to go into directory and info desk oh i played a sound effect and you didn't hear it okay let's try this again maybe just maybe i feel ready everyone oh oh we've got more now to the show you're looking if you're a little confused on how to navigate let me go back to this room okay hold on welcome roommate okay inside the column all right let me welcome room b now maybe come on i have a bit to do here maybe we feel ready now to go into the directory and info desk right shall we do it what do you all think what do you think what do you think all right i'm going to mute the audio of i'm like very afraid oh wait look i everybody knows i just i don't love the idea of like broadcasting this space without people's consent and so um you know i'm going to be very mindful of that i mean this is a public online space so people are hopefully just generally aware that they are being watched and could be recorded but the students are aware that i'm going to be visiting their project and i've also prepared a sign to appear on my face that says live broadcast so here we go uh twirling tech goddess is in the house and i really there's just no way that you could possibly be referring to my hair i don't think any i'm just gonna got to be somebody else right because i know it's getting a little bit long and i've got my little streak of gray and eventually hopefully if it stays it will be all silver at some point and i'm very excited for those days if i'm still a person who's doing things on youtube you will appreciate this twirling tech god goddess because my tshirt says don't hate wait hold i gotta go to this view don't hate roller skate all right um where am i here i am all right now we're going into the directory and info desk it's like 8 15 i haven't looked at a project yet okay uh here we go directory and info desk here we are i'm going to turn on my camera here i am i'm going to go to the corner just for a second to be by myself i'm turning on my mic and then i'm going to zoom in and this is me see this is my now i'm seeing it mirrored because um spatial chat wants to show me my image mirrored which makes a lot of sense by the way this camera that you're seeing here right now is the different than this camera right like i can cover my camera the camera that's in spatial chat is the camera that's on my laptop but where i'm broadcasting this from open broadcast studio is this camera over there hi this camera over there camera one i only have one camera someday i'll have more than one camera so i can do the bit where i go camera two come on let's talk we gotta talk camera two but there's there's no camera two right now so i can't do that all right back to here so i think i can remove myself as i move around because this is me right here i am the live broadcast um and now we're in um let's see let's go uh let's go like if you have social anxiety this is really like i don't know if live streaming to the internet and weirdly it's like easier for me to do that than uh walk into a room full of people but um uh let's go wander over and say hi to some folks oh hello i'm a live broadcast everybody be careful hi hello well hello shipping oh this is the let's see is the audio the audio is going through to my live broadcast i've got my sign that says i'm a live broadcast so everybody knows everybody's okay we've got a chat going mostly people are joining the live broadcast and then i'm steering them here so if you are watching the live broadcast right now here is your link right here on the screen chat slash s slash spring show 2021 you could jump right in here and invade the live broadcast you know be kind uh how's everybody doing tonight this is like such a nice crew of folks i'm i'm i'm having like a just a very small minor fit of anxiety and panic here but it's everything as we circle you is there anything we can do to help no no no that's my that's my uh uh baseline so things are actually quite good um and i'm i'm okay and um i'm i'm slow like for a while i just spent the time in the welcome rooms where you couldn't um speak or hear other people and then now we changed that yeah oh oh that was nice though it was a good way to ease into spatial chat so now i'm in the directory room and i i'm working up the courage to go to i think my first stop is going to be virtual reality you're brave dan you're so brave have fun thank you all right everyone i'm going to go over here so they don't have to hear me um i am now going ahead let's go look we're going to head over to vr where there are these um let's see how far can i zoom in um we're there and i i was meaning not to show people's names here um we're gonna head over to vr where we have these one two oh i'm pointing the wrong way i'm looking the whole reason why i don't have my video flipped is because i can look i guess i could go over here here we go this is very obviously this is like making all the difference in your viewing experience must point correctly uh ah julia ann myers is in the vr room i think the last time i think i've interacted with julia before but julia you are a lowres student at the itp ima lores program so many names and acronyms what does it all mean ask in the chat i'm happy to try to answer that um julia cyberspace three julia if it's all right with you let's head over to your project first because um yeah why not okay we're heading over to julia's project um so i'm going to the vr room and now i am i just got plopped in what is history it's many parallel streams of events which meet at certain points so why not create them as parallel structures that makes it easier to write easy to read so to me the computer was an opportunity to radically redefine the nature of writing this is a really cool movie okay can you hear me yeah i'm not sure if we're allowed to talk i got so much audio going on um yeah let me give you a little demo so this is a video in the middle but i'm going to open up this screen here um because this is the actual live demo and so you can visit the site so i've gotten basically last time you stream me my aframe skills were very rudimentary um this is all aframe this is uh yeah print out some more features so aframe is a programming language yeah so aframe is for writing or creating vr uh do you know 3js like the javascript library so it basically uses that library so you can create like a frame which is a like vr in the browser so like right now what you can see here okay so this is running in the browser right now so you can actually use this with uh a headset an oculus headset or just in the browser and um yeah so basically this time i experimented with like interaction and it's exploration of like pixels and screens and space and all that um so yeah it was really fun um i did a lot of work in after effects and a lot of this all this is is an aframe though um again the loading times down was a miracle i'm getting some questions from some folks about what is aframe could you could you give a quick like um highlevel uh uh explanation of what aframe is yeah sure so aframe uh basically allows you to host vr in the browser so for a lot of your projects you have to have like an oculus or a headset and for this it makes a lot more accessible so anyone can like open up their browser even on your phone and stuff and like this is running yeah right now in chrome chrome is recommended um and you can have a whole vr project there and there's a lot of really cool uses for it um because you can basically have this kind of like 360 ability to create in 360 for the web which i think is very cool um yeah and it so it works on time based so it's timed out in javascript so after like 30 seconds each room moves on yeah that's my little project so but a frame is very cool and a lot easier than you'd think it's all in html so um like inside html so i'd recommend oh wow okay so you wait so you make the aframe is the language powered by 3js in html i i just started i mean just yeah it sounds kind of crazy yeah yeah but basically yeah basically you're working with like entities which are making kind of these 3d objects in a space but it's coded i don't think that they're saying it's like i'm just going to interrupt for a second here um and oh wait a sec uh sorry i meant to mute myself here and i muted myself in the wrong place i'm not interrupting here i'm interrupting someone else cook as you were all good yeah all right go ahead the wrong button again okay now we're all good i i i thought i was doing so well with the technology i've got like audio and multiple computers here and streaming i i just wanted to answer some of the questions in the chat because i think people are all confused about what you're watching so there is at this moment going on in uh in a in a shared space called spatial chat you can go to spatial dot chat s spring show 2021 link in the description and pinned in the chat the end of semester show for the itp ima and lores programs at nyu tisch school of the arts just wanted to reset the room here for a moment um julian is asking what does itp and ima stand for so itp stands for interactive telecommunications program it's a twoyear master's program and ima stands for interactive media arts which is a a fouryear bachelor's of fine arts it's an undergrad program so um hopefully i've linked to those programs in the video's description but if you go to itp.nyu.edu you'll find out there and so ultimately really this is just a a show that you can go and wander around and chat with students and see their projects in a virtual space normally this would be um physically an inperson show in brooklyn new york but um you know here we are in living in 2021 um and a global pandemic so the uh the the show is online for this semester spatial chat is a service that i have nothing to do with that it ima has nothing to do with it's a um like a browserbased multiuser chat video audio spatially oriented system i'm sure we could find out more about it if i looked on their about page um that the department is using for the show all right i'm gonna jump back into the show and listen to what julia is saying yeah and then you just type in the uh the name of my project but you can see it but unfortunately so the interaction i'm adding interaction for oculus controls in like the final version like my thesis is due in july so this is uh like very much a prototype still but so you will be able to interact with the boxes and stuff but you can like click but yeah that'll be final version so okay all right i can't wait i uh i i only you know i can't wait to try this out i'm like oh my gosh i just got in here yeah last night but uh is this going to be available like after 10 o'clock oh the website yeah yeah it will be up okay yeah thanks for stopping by this is great yeah no i'm glad this live broad what's the show called with the rainbows oh the coding train you gotta check it out when you start talking i was like okay it's great no i'm sorry about that i have like a million different controls for like live streams i have the audio from my live stream and i pressed the wrong button but actually julia what i did is actually people were asking a little confusion so i was like resetting the room a bit and i explained what itp and ima are but i didn't really say too much about the low res i don't want to take up too much of your time but yeah could you just talk about what the the low res program for 30 seconds what an electronic document what it's for or what are you know for one thing yeah what it's like for you your own experience yeah for sure yeah it's been really cool so this is like the first year of it so it's a brand new program but i think it's a great way of kind of meeting bridging the gap so it's only one year and you basically do every semester and it's been online from the intention is that you get to experience different campuses and um yeah i love because it's like uh interactive media arts it's also my undergrad major and so i feel like i got so into it that's why i love being able to kind of continue what i was doing and what i was looking into with the uh with the masters but yeah so it's one year i like that's very small you really like have great relationships with professors and all that and um but yeah uh awesome no that's true no no that's perfect that's really helpful yeah yeah and i will um put a link in the youtube chat and uh for people who are interested in finding out more about the program awesome thank you for being the guinea pig this is the first project that i stopped by so i'm gonna go wander around and find some other projects to look at thanks so much yeah have fun thanks for stopping by all right so i'm back to here um and i have someone walking around directly in space yeah cool so now i should be able to move around let's go back in i'm just going to move over here into spatial chat you can't see what i'm doing here i am i'm just moving over here where i don't see a lot of people so i can have a little bit of a break and figure out where i'm going to go next um so i i want to come back to the vr room if i can um because there are more um projects here actually let me see let me see if actually um looks like marianne is there let's see if we can stop by marianne's project um briefly so i'm going to switch to this view i'm going to unmute myself and now i'm going to move back over here and hello is anybody here anybody home hi yes hi how are you oh wait wait wait i messed up my audio buttons okay now i can hear hi dan i'm just saying hello oh yes um so i this is a live broadcast currently i'm mostly encouraging people to leave the live broadcast and enter spatial chat itself but i'm kind of just popping around and visiting projects do you have a minute to tell us about your project marianne sure is the um the trailer playing in the background like distracting oh well i it's not distracting because i don't hear audio from it so it's okay to see it on the screen sure okay um so my project is called root it is a immersive film and also a vr installation looking at race and representation in 3d digital media um it follows a character named yara and she goes through the she does this like hair journey going through these magical hair worlds where she likes and starts off in a straight air force and ends up in a curly hair world and is transformed so that's basically my project awesome and what's the um i'm sorry to ask such a question where because i'm so like such a vr kind of beginner or i don't know beginners maybe even two too strong what is your um is it for a particular platform if somebody wanted to um watch the film or experience it is that something that they can do now or in the future if they want to learn more about it um in the future i'll post it on the project page um i'm going to be taking the summer to actually complete it right now i just have the trailer and the the world setup and some of the the performance capture um ideally it would be an inperson installation where we'd scream the film and then check out the vr piece but i'm definitely going to be working on a webbased version so once that's out i will share that awesome fantastic so if people want to i see this is so kind of amazing by the way i love the way your area is organized and that you filled the chairs with wonderful little emojis which is awesome but i i mean it's i guess i'm speaking the obvious here but um everyone should take a look here you can see um in this pink square over here there's the url for the project you can check out um instagram linkedin vimeo page and contact info if people would like to find out more about this really exciting and wonderful film and more about your work yeah thank you congratulations thank you have fun everybody thanks okay here i am oh actually i'm gonna i'm gonna move closer to your trailer because i realize when i move closer to it we can hear the audio so i'm gonna let it play oh yeah please let me know if you guys have any questions i have a little trouble navigating here oh my computer is like all of a sudden grinding to a halt here okay move over here um maybe i should mute myself in spatial chat for a moment so people don't hear me there we go i'm gonna bring myself back here okay so i am going to um move on to my sort of goal is to look at a couple projects on each page i'm gonna move to narrative and storytelling um and see if david is there for his a life's a boat project so here we go i'm clicking on narrative and storytelling oh just to reset the room again anybody's newly joined uh you don't need to be watching me i i appreciate it if you do that's wonderful maybe you maybe you prefer just being able to see somebody kind of wandering around through this show but i highly encourage you to just join yourself um you can just go right to this url in the browser and experience the different projects that are on display in different rooms and uh ask questions and enjoy yourself all right so let me move on to going to the narrative and storytelling uh page and acting with weird mute the spatial chat audio for all of you and let's see where am i i can't find myself what is going on where am i i can't i can't find myself in spatial chat i'm lost i don't exist uh let's see i must be somewhere i'm looking at all these projects my video is on let's see i'm gonna unmute myself i can't find myself is anybody near me to tell me where i am okay what room what project is this i found myself okay oh okay now i've uh hi uh so i'm a live broadcast i mean i'm a person i don't know why my computer has decided that it's just like all was working so well all of a sudden it's you can see my videos basically become incredibly choppy um but um i'm able to hear you and see you just fine so here i am in the project called it's raining could you introduce yourself and tell us about your project if you're okay with doing that yeah sure um welcome um my project call it's raining it's an interactive multistory line website about a rainy day it was first a digital translation of the real life art piece ring room um but then i got into building this site i add my impressions of rainy days i think they're secretive absurd and mysterious so i build interactions based on those impressions rather than going through a complete story um you will find yourself being in moments that will lead you to other certain moments according to your choice of past um yeah the link is above um feel feel free to visit the site or i can like like demonstrate it i have a screen share here oh let's try the live demo we haven't had a live demo yet i'd love to see how that works okay happy too it's my first time so so you can choose the man or you can choose that you have an umbrella i don't know if you have a preference but if you do please tell me oh it's too much too much of a decision for me i can't i can't handle it maybe um an umbrella then okay you have an umbrella on a rainy day and you're walking um and then there's a dog and a in a house do you want to choose or i can choose it for you no i i can now i can handle it let's go for the dog i'm a dog person nice well you're following the dog it's leading you to a pond and here's a countdown back to the opening scene amazing so i i it's like i i'm fascinated by your project but mostly i'm just like so thrilled to see so this is in the way that you're doing this in spatial chat is that you're you've added a screen share that just appears as like any other image or video and then we're able to see it that's amazing and so um if people want to try is try the project themselves um they can go the url is right there um you can sort of see i'm going to zoom in so people can see it shannon who dot github dot io slash final is that right did i pronounce your name correctly yes okay wonderful and did you what what um um what tools did you use to build this um html script css and javascript wonderful yeah great work thank you so much for sharing thank you for coming all right here we go i'm moving around i'm trying i'm seeing if david i see some people following me i know i know you're like um you were one of his close friends so yeah i know looks like we we got company yeah we do hello i'm sorry to interrupt i just want to let everybody know that i'm currently a live broadcast i mean you're live on the internet in some sense but uh uh you know so if anybody wants to run away you're welcome to do that but uh i i don't know i'm really sorry to interrupt but do you have a minute david to show your project sure so first of all i want to introduce you to nick who is outside of itp like i know him through an undergrad friend of mine oh awesome hi nick yeah so nice to meet you man yeah dan is one of my favorite professors you know so he's not a professor he's a professor [Laughter] i had him this semester yeah so back in college i had a thing with the professors it's like if you were like a really cool professor i would call you professor like you don't really you don't really get that title from me unless i i spill it upon you you know what i'm saying i see i don't know i feel like uh i don't know if i fit i mean i hopefully i'm like a nice and thoughtful and helpful person but i don't know you use the word cool there i don't know if i qualify for that that's for sure i don't know man i mean you seem pretty cool to me right off the bat yeah yes you should see his youtube videos like he has a whole youtube channel called the recording train yes we're live on it right now but i teach 3d in photoshop so i'm having a little bit of a 4d an issue where my like browser is just locking up so hold on i'm going to try resetting it and be right back okay uh technical difficulties everyone look at this do you want to see my project then i do but i'm a little worried it's not going to work because everything is frozen so i'm going to come right back page unresponsive okay so i don't know to what extent um obs this is what i i'm running open broadcast studio and i might oh headphone just disconnected um let me try getting back into spatial chat um and this is just the uh coding train discord let's see if everything is kind of going smoothly again all right this is going sorry everybody let's try opening up the browser again i feel like maybe i should quit obs i want to quit obs briefly see if that helps um i'm also going to do something that seems a little bit odd but i'm going to change where my plug is oh my battery is done wow i'm plugged in but like it has no charge why it's just like battery is not charging because it's just like the life is being sucked out of my computer sorry i realized i wasn't even on screen here so let's give this a second okay it's charging again oof that was kind of a disaster i've lowered the brightness doesn't lower for you let's see if i can get back to spatial chat all right let's take here i'm gonna take a short break here and i'm gonna quit chrome i'm gonna quit discord and i'm going to let the um right i'm going to see if my computer can kind of um just gather its strength i don't know what just happened but like the fan is going crazy the battery went to zero even though i'm plugged in which uh is a little bit distressing so i think maybe just somehow running obs and being in spatial chat and all of that really just um i need like an ice pack to put underneath the computer look at this nice seethrough little uh sticker here so i don't know if anybody has um any questions you want to ask right now i can put on some like uh waiting music here um oh the music's not gonna play because i have uh oh wait um i've disconnected oh no it is all right hold on everyone let's do the following i'm actually going to just completely shut down the computer and restart it so if you're just tuning in which i don't know that anybody is i am attempting to live stream the itp ima lores show um but my computer that i am uh for joining the show the online show from uh which is not the same computer that i'm live streaming from obviously because you can still hear and see me um really just i don't know what happened but it just decided to fall apart so i'm giving it a moment to rest a moment to breathe i could go to maybe i need a little break for myself could go to my little like intermission animation but mostly i'm just kind of talking here vamping so to speak um to like let the computer charge up a little bit and hopefully then kind of reboot it and be all set and fine um vicky asks in the chat why is there nature of code in the video unfortunately i've lost the threat of what that was referring to i've also just now in the last five minutes lost about 15 viewers i hope it's because you've all gone and joined the show yourself uh i'm gonna give let's let's let's take a proper uh i think this is too awkward for oh who built the spatial chat website i got a question i don't know the answer it is not something that i am affiliated with um it is a service that i believe you can use for free and sign up for but i have no personal knowledge or relationship to it whatsoever it just happens that the program chose to use it as a mechanism or means to display all the projects and ronald thank you for your nice message that's good because i'm am i feeling a little like uh hot and sweaty here um having some technical difficulties and just having to um talk silently in a room by myself with these lights i'm in an attic in brooklyn new york with a camera on me um i think how is the doggy ask here and oh thank you for asking so first of all if you don't know i was i have a gloria pickle is my dog she is a six i want me to get gloria up here hey gloria gloria we'll see if she comes usually she comes and sleeps right next to me if i'm working at this desk or streaming or teaching but gloria is a sixyearold corgi beagle mix she was uh rescued by a um an organization called muddy paws rescue muddy as in i like to jump in muddy puddles um they are based in brooklyn but they rescue dogs i think from kentucky and also perhaps alabama mightypawsrescue.org um and i've also been we've my family has been fostering with them so we had a dog a puppy an eightweekold puppy named marlon that was his name i was calling him martin so i got confused or marvin depending on how i felt um and we really loved uh having marlin here i have to admit i i wasn't the nicest but i was kind of complaining because having a puppy is a lot it was like a little bit too much for me but my family wonderfully took care of marlin i participated to the extent that i could but marlon was since adopted by a wonderful uh family and uh marlon's gonna have a wonderful life living in upstate new york at a campground so um many many happy returns from marlin i hope to be able to keep in touch the video was the video on the life's about in the spatial chat so the reason why is that particular video is uh david's project is from my class called nature of code so i'm gonna restart my computer you're gonna hear the lovely chime sound in a minute we're going to hope that everything gets i'm going to blow on it maybe just to cool it off a little bit i think this works this is scientifically known if you go to the apple support website and you talk to the geniuses at the genius bar they will tell you lift up your laptop and blow on it way to cool down a computer also get an ice pack just set it right on top of the ice pack i'm gonna log in now uh poor david is probably waiting for me i am uh rebooting my computer francello wants to know what are your plans for the summer i'm so glad you asked coding train is my plan for summer may is a little bit wonky june is a little bit i'm not so sure july and august i hack i have some plans to be set up in a new studio with a standing desk to be getting back to my roots doing some more coding challenges we'll see if that happens uh but that's that's my plans um you know hopefully i'll have some time to just enjoy with family enjoy being outside um catching up ah the nature of code project i'm working on in collaboration with some folks a brand new coding train website um jiraj asks is the new nature of code playlist completely up now no no not even close in fact all of chapter five has yet to be released it's all been recorded and mostly edited so stay tuned for that i think i probably said this a month ago in the next couple weeks but really it's coming let's see how my uh how the laptop is doing um show percentage i'm at eight percent but as long as it's charging no apps using significant energy so that's a that's good um um and now i'm sorry i'm kind of answering questions and talking and trying to operate my computer at the same time i can show you what i'm doing so i'm i want to go and open up obs um i'm opening up open broadcast studio which should have my camera by the way this is a green screen which i just keyed it to black which is sort of silly with my live broadcast sign uh using significant energy i don't like that stop using significant energy um i need that energy let's go to tools and start virtual camera now we're going to go back into spatial chat coding train live broadcast i'm a live broadcast all that stuff got it continue uh uh no i want to be my my uh headphones disconnected they are now connected so i should be able to go to come on do i need to re let's refresh and see if the mic shows up there we go i am back into these headphones um yeah it's a little bit silly the whole reason i'm using obs is for this you know i wonder if turning off the keying the chroma keying is probably using a lot of resources so let's turn that off let's just delete it so hopefully that will help and now i just have a green background which is fine so we'll go back into here i'm going to join the space i also need to have loopback audio going um all right here i am i don't know if anybody can hear me i'm going to mute myself in spatial chat and i'm going to mute the spatial chat audio to the live stream uh everyone i'm just here in a welcome room trying to set up a live stream so you're you're welcome to participate and talk or come near me or run away just letting you know that's what's happening um ah great i had a little technical disaster hold on i'm going to send the audio here around the help uh basically if you want to visit any of the rooms there's a list of rooms on the right if you click any of them it'll take you there everything here is spatial yeah uh so if you if i move away from you you won't hear me anymore uh yeah and all the directory room has a map if you want to find out more about any of the projects being shown all right everybody got that explanation uh we're going to go back to narrative and storytelling we're going to try to find david i'm saying online they're just doing something maybe i'll check it out sounds good congratulations david this is this is really great oh thank you so much to louisa oh you're shiffman i'm back yeah so i discovered just in case anyone's wondering i for some reason my um computer plugged in the battery went all the way to zero percent running obs and spacer chat and everything oh my god so i shut it down i lifted it up i blew on it for a while to cool it off which i think is a scientifically proven method and uh i got it to ten percent and it seems to be going okay right now so i'm ready jay we're sorry for keeping you waiting we're i'm ready for uh for this audience that i've got on youtube who by the way should just join spatial chat and come right here in spatial chat itself but uh uh could you introduce yourself and tell us about your project okay so my name is david and i'm a first year itp student i just finished my first year i'm located in queens new york in flushing and like this is a final project i created for the nature of code is the nature of code class it's like a combination my life story my covet life story experience through p5.js and arduino physical computing so this is a video right here and i can i just use the potentiometers to adjust the weather of the ocean scene as seen in this video and i think it came out pretty good and like it's it shows like my personal life story and just explaining to it releasing my stress through the potentiometer you know so it's it's i made this project also metaphorical for both sending to life you know and standing through a storm and through good times and bad times you know so that's it wonderful yeah one of my favorite things about your project david is so you just have some beautiful quotes in there i don't want to spoil them i'll let people experiencing them for themselves but you really have some just delightful quotes and i just think it's also just tremendous work i know how challenging it can be to build your own interface and have it communicate with the browser and the way that you pick the different parameters with some of these algorithmic systems that we looked at in class and were able to develop your own interface for them and tie it into such a personal story is really just terrific wonderful work so um i i think i i'm not i think if i move my um self closer to the video i can hear your audio so i'm gonna do that and let people listen but um if people wanted to watch um use the sketch or watch this particular video themselves i'm assuming these two links that i see right here yes so that's it the first link is a documentation for my former project the second link is a nonpecan version of the sketch so that people can interact with it with the sliders which i replace with the potentiometers for this video or should i say right yeah we talked about that it's such a great thing to do if you work on an interactive p5.js sketch that's like got custom physical installation and hardware um you can have both you can maintain a simultaneous version that works with just browserbased interaction so people can actually experience that interaction themselves and then watch your video documentation to understand um how the hardware and the um gesture based physical interface works so it'd be uh it's too bad this is like such a perfect project for the live itp show i hope that next year and we're back together on the floor sometime you'll be able to bring it in so other other folks can can try it themselves yeah i really want to friendship breakups so i'm gonna i'm i'm kind of like listening in the in the back of my mind here or like just the corner of my ear i don't know what the right expression is for when the video starts but i think it's nearing the end is that right it is yeah yeah so i'm going to try to move myself up and so that we can so i can play it for the stream when it starts over okay perfect better now congratulations david i'm going to go and look around oh thank you so nice to meet you yeah nice to meet you nice to meet you too bye take care looking forward to a much better year and not stormy days anymore all right just i'm moving over here just to reset the room for a minute for anybody who's watching me live this is a oh uh live broadcast of an end of semester show from the itp ima and low res programs at tisch school of the arts nyu and i think the pro i think the video is about to start over is that right yes perfect i'm gonna move up and kind of zoom in on it thank you david when you go towards one side of the life bad things happen to you you go to a dark miserable storm and everything seems very pessimistic you go through happy days and things go very good for you people love you everything goes the way you wanted to and in between you have ups and downs just like any other person does so 2020 was one hell of a year for me i've been through so much throughout the covet pandemic and a lot of people like i know like got the virus and it's been a crazy tough year you know so when the pandemic started my family and i got very sick with covet and we've been to these dark times my mother almost died and my father got very sick i was the most healthiest one during the pandemic and things were very dark for me and just just knowing that wanting for better days to come was just like a far away thing you know but then the pandemic got better my family and i tested negative for coving like things were looking up but it still wasn't the same there were still dark and stormy days i gained the quarantine 15 or should i say quarantine 50 pounds which was a whole lot for me aside from the weight already gained in the past my ticks social god works for my tourette's syndrome because i have tourette's syndrome which is a neurological disorder characterized by inflammatory movements and ticks and these were like horrible days for me like it's just tough to remember it you know so these were the stormy days and suddenly things were kind of rough here and there i also broke up with a lot of friends sorry had some friendship breakups and this thing's happening to me you know like a lot of changes in my life but then the better days were coming in 2021 now this year is looking up for me and there's no more storm things are starting to get better now although things are do have its ups and downs still but it's getting better now looking forward to a much better year and not stormy days anymore what a good way to release myself so far just to the turn of a potentiometer knob and one more thing i have to say light's a boat okay not too bad life is like a potentiometer when you go towards one side of the life bad things happen thanks for broadcasting yeah thanks for broadcasting of course all right i'm gonna wander around and head to some other projects take care it's kind of here i am uh really incredible for me to think that it's been a little over 20 years actually if we're talking about the full itp journey my itp journey has been uh rather long i saw myself on the in the video and i had to come over here reload on her screens um can you i'm i'm in the middle i'm kind of like wandering around the show and live broadcasting some of the projects can you give a quick um uh summary of uh just introduce yourself and tell us a few sentences about what it is that you worked on sure yeah so i'm akshita and i'm a first year itp student and my project was a hundred days of journalism for a class called hundred days of making and for the last 100 days i've been interviewing everyone from itp student faculties and staff members and hopefully this project is going to go on in summer and fall as well up to now i've done about 65 interviews and this uh is a compilation of the bits of the first question that i asked in the interview like which is on the screen and if you see the link on the left is the instagram page of uh where i post individual interviews as well amazing i i'm really just always so impressed and in awe of the hundred days projects that i've been following many of them and it's something that i have never tried to do and i certainly aspire to do it especially in the sort of creative coding world there's a lot of people who will do things like daily sketching and i think you know in in the sort of coding sketching sense and i think it's a wonderful practice to adopt to sort of uh you know release yourself in a way of like oh i have to spend like weeks or months or like get everything perfect no just but uh this is such a different kind of project with the with the journalism i imagine it was a tremendous amount of work just to like coordinate how did you manage that so i i think i i sent out google forms for the students and they filled out the google forms and that's how i got to know about their available days and times and for faculty i sent you all emails personally uh to better match um the timings i think the most challenging part was the postproduction because uh that took a lot of time honestly especially for the interviews that i took in person on the floor that was literally hard yeah yeah see wonderful well thank you for sharing this so if folks want to um catch all of the interviews they can it's the best places to send them to your instagram page yeah wonderful yeah i'm gonna zoom in on it and show show show everyone all right thanks so much for sharing thank you so much for coming by so here uh i'm gonna mute myself in spatial chat for a second um so here uh i'm gonna bring myself back here uh so here i would encourage you to check out the 100 days of journalism project by akshita and uh you can find her instagram link right there at instagram.com 100 days of journalism okay uh how's everybody doing in the chat people are still here are you you should go too have we hit well how many people are in the actual itp ima spatial chat show can we get it up to 500 people that's my personal goal help me out here share this let's get 500 people into it we could do it um i'm gonna wander through i have a kind of list of projects oh where am i um moving around here layton vignettes let's go check that out yeah yep yep that was right i see mr shipman i think uh i haven't figured out it is hi i have arrived hello i should warn everyone that this is you're being you're being sort of like transmitted across the intertubes right now although mostly i just so used to tom ran away um i heard that and he was like i don't know why that's why i've done this that's the proper that is the only appropriate reaction by the way to uh um so here i am i'm i'm sorry i have like a million buttons to press before i can uh to orient myself let me press this um hi kevin how are you hi i'm great how are you um um i would love for you to uh if you have a minute and don't mind being uh broadcast here to tell us a little bit about this project sure um this is a virtual production short made entirely in unreal engine 4. so um at least at itp there's two kind of like prevailing schools of thoughts or kind of use cases of unreal engine one is uh in game play so using like blueprints or a c plus and kind of like programming environment where the user can go through yourself or um in you know hollywood and the mandalorian i'm sure a lot of people have seen is using unreal engine sequencer um to produce uh you know timebased media uh media production so it's more kind of like a 3d after effects premiere pro type of situation so this is the latter um this is using that and kind of like recording out a bunch of unreal uh sorry uh realtime uh sequences and then uh tied together with match cuts so you know the eyeopening into the subway tunnel the falling versus the rising um the connected with light and then the life and death wow so just to unpack this for a moment um i definitely understand the distinction between using something like unreal engine for an interactive experience a game that somebody might play or for i'm a huge fan of like the mandalorian specifically but just kind of shows that are using a lot of um exciting new techniques and virtual production visual effects but one thing that's never is not entirely clear to me is um the the what's what's actually um you know what's real time versus rendered so for example is the benefit of a lot of what you're doing here is that there isn't that distinction like if you design a scene uh you don't need to like press the render button and wait overnight to see the footage but it actually just happens real time and is there like sort of a uh a quality tradeoff there um that's that's one i don't i don't have it's kind of a i'm kind of bouncing around this question without a very well formed thought but that's kind of uh that distinction between real time versus render how does that play a role in your work uh yes um that i think you pretty much got it it's a it's a definitive time tradeoff and in you know like media production time is money yeah and also for rendering essentially you know like really good animation studios like pixar dreamworks like they have essentially large render farms like large server rooms just blasting uh like gpu cards at it and real time just you know relies on your local like gpu whatever you have there is a quality tradeoff but not much i think that that's the appeal of unreal is right now it's getting to a place where it's much better um and it depends on kind of like what you're using it for maybe it's not you know to the level that people want for pixar like you know like um feature length movies sort of like quality um and a lot of the tools uh that unreal has is getting better and better partially because it's owned by epic games and epic has fortnite so they're able to just buy everyone um the same strategy that apple use essentially you know you have the money you buy all the startups and you get all the tech and you make it free to a certain extent um so it's getting popular more and more popular and then you know thanks to shows like the mandalorian which uh the virtual production there is essentially i don't know if you've seen the behind the scenes yeah the led yeah um it's the time right like you're getting you're able to get posts and vfx into the same room as principal photography or the dp and the director so there's no lag there's no latency between the two and you're able to visualize things on the fly so you don't have to like go back and see oh this didn't come out right let me reshoot it right yeah i was i was watching an interview i think it was with one of the sort of like lighting designer or lighting animators and i i mean by like virtual lighting and they were so excited to work on the mandalorian and the i'm paraphrasing whatever the interview was but it was the first experience where they were actually there on set like doing their work as opposed to it all being sort of after the fact in a different room like by themselves so that was really cool to see i would love um i think it would be really exciting to have a kind of at you know tisch at itp ima to have a kind of mini or virtual volume type set that people could play with and so what um if um like for me like i you know have a lot of experience with certain kinds of digital media and coding and different kinds of graphics but i haven't worked with these kinds of 3d engines what what would be for somebody who's coming from a creative coding world perhaps if they wanted to get into unreal like what what are the what's the starting point what are the skills or or kind of prerequisites in a way before getting started with this kind of work um i would say in my opinion uh most of the creative coding people actually prefer unity a little bit more than on just based on you know you can just get into csharp and and modify things uh with code which to me i'm coming from a uh actually like a filmmaking and data science background um so unreal's ui felt much more intuitive and a lot of this sort of controls that we're dealing with right now um is essentially mimicking reallife filmmaking and that's the kind of like um the onramp for um you know professional filmmakers to get onto unreal or that's the hope um so uh examples of this are you know the way that the camera glides there's like a virtual crane there's a virtual dolly um you know you can put like lens flares and you can put like different like sort of like dirt maps on there and you can change the focal length and the the um sensor with even though there's no sensor no um but i would say you know uh understand kind of what you're using on real four um it's interesting because it's a game engine but you don't have to use it for games right you're essentially in the realtimeness of it um and the 3dness of it and uh there's a lot of applications to be done there and uh one of the things actually if you uh went to the pcomp room i have another project i did with a collaborator at itp um where we created a physical computing uh camera without any image detection and we would essentially instead have a bunch of environmental sensors and you can grab kind of like snapshots of um the light condition and send it to a server and in unreal i can hook onto that server through http get request and then use that data to drive the lighting condition uh change in the scene awesome wow that's cool i've actually i'm hoping to head by i i'm like i was like oh i'm gonna hit all the rooms and somehow i think i'm only on my third so but um that's awesome to hear and and for anybody who's tuning in like obviously you can just join this spatial chat uh system yourself just by going to the url that's pinned in the video description and in the chat so check out both this project and the other one uh in the pcomp room as well so cool thanks so much for sharing this um it's awesome i'm excited to see where it all leads thank you thank you awesome thanks okay let me head to uh empty welcome room all right i'm in an empty welcome room woof here i am right i'm back in my seat this is my really highend visual effects i've integrated myself perfectly into this room of watching the show here how's everybody doing there's a few of you still tuning in um ronald is saying that's crazy i never thought about unreal as an animating engine yeah i i don't know like maybe i feel like i was gonna say it's too late for me which is the wrong way to put it but um i i i'm just fascinated by what's happening in animation and virtual production it's it's not really a skill set or that i have um but it's kind of amazing to see um what different students and and creative folks are doing these days and maybe maybe in some small way i can align some ideas or you know i was thinking of learning actually unity or blender um in particular and trying to do some to work with those on the coding train but okay let's move on um i'm running i'm kind of running a a little bit low on steam here i was going to try to go until 9 30 p.m which is very late way past my bedtime it's way past my bedtime let's play this 19 music here oh boy people are hearing me i remember i should mute myself with spacious chat i came here because it was empty uh but uh ah maybe this is a viewer here um you're hearing me probably in both ears now and sort of like with a weird echo delay but i'm going to head over to physical computing and product design and i have my eye and a couple projects um there that i want to check out so oh there's a lot of people in that room i wonder if i should go somewhere that's a little less crowded all right we'll turn this music off um all right so i'm heading over to product design pcomp here we go and i meant to check my only mute myself here bring myself oh i am back i'm gonna i'm gonna just check how's my oh good okay we seem to be the computer seems to be charging again uh which is a very good sign okay so let's find um let me zoom out here let me take myself out there and let's see ah um where did i go where did i end up i'm lost again i zoomed out and i can't find myself is great how did that happen where am i i have to unmute myself oh no i'm down here okay you don't lose it's not as if you need too many they seem to be in the middle of a conversation so let's go uh all right here we are ah okay hold on hello aiden hello how's it going it's going well um i am sorry i'm kind of getting my ducks in a row the wires plugged into the right thing i'm making sure my audio stuff is going so this is by the way it's a live broadcast if you can tell by the uh overlay i got going here um do you have a minute to share um share about your work and project yeah absolutely i'd love to awesome uh take it away whenever you're ready i've got all right plugged in and working sounds great hello everybody um this is my project called infinite reflections and it is the first video infinity mirrors what you're looking at right up here is a reallife video sculpture containing 14 000 leds it is not a render um if you want to scan the hash uh yeah this qr code you can see the videos in hd i'm also going to play them here but we'll see what happens um so just to go over the basics of an infinity mirror you've got a light source in between a regular mirror and a beam splitter so the light bounces back and forth some of it escapes each time and you see uh repetition into the z axis um so last semester so hyland knows that and i created the first video infinity mirror which you can see here um and this is what it looks like in my apartment it is about two feet wide and that's what it looks like when i can start um this semester i kept on going and i created a sphere mirror and convex mirror these are the same inside modular ring but there's different back and front plates so in this case on the left there's speeder mirror which is based on yay kusama's work it's hemispheres on a back mirror that are reflected into spheres and then repeated into the zaxis on the right i'm using a convex smear so that's kind of what you might see at a convenience store to see around the corner it's a bulging lens and that causes the visuals to warp warp inwards um i'll just play this for a couple seconds so we can see um maybe fast forward to here um yeah so if you look closely on any of the individual spheres i don't know if this is glitching out or not but you can actually see all the other spheres floating in space there and the visuals you see happenstance turn out to be exactly what is visible in the same animations on the convex mirror because a hemisphere is a convex mirror as well um so a lot of my work this semester was learning how to use touch designer so that i could create different types of particle simulations and graphics that take advantage of this circular um screen that i built with these mirroring properties so if you move the graphics up and down through the screen it creates a tunnel if you flip them on your side and move them back and forth through the screen it creates this spiraling tunnel effect the next one is the result of moving the visuals one direction through the screen and reflecting the subsequent repetitions um and up until this point i've been using all these mirroring tricks to get rid of the scene that's in the middle because i'm setting a rectangular video to a circular screen um the next one is the first example i've been able to figure out so far of getting rid of the seam and not using any tricks i'm actually programmed in the rules in the asteroids game so the stripes are flying out one side of the screen and then they come in through the other at the same angle both on the top and the bottom uh eventually i'll be rendering in a 3d environment and then mapping it to a cylinder but i haven't gotten that part yet um here's a overview of how everything works but the important things are that there's an app you can control on your phone and you can send live graphics to it over wifi so i built a server that's running on my raspberry pi that takes udp messages that i'm sending from my desktop that can basically pull in any siphon stream from any program in a processing sketch and what that allows me to do is create a realtime interactive sculpture so this is called panopti's mirror and it's based on the panopti's uh myth of the hundredeyed beast that was rewarded for his service for um by having his eyes put on the peacock feathers so this version of the mirror um is the commentary on surveillance capitalism and the ease at which we give our biometric data and privacy information away for a little bit of entertainment so go back to the beginning it attracts you over to these flashy peacock visuals and when you step in front of it it's using open cv eye tracking the camera grabs your eyes they do a realtime mask send them through touch designer and then out over wifi to project in real time into the mirror your reward for giving up your eyes is to have your eyes staring back at you so the eyes get switched over from the peacock feathers into this particle simulation um and it gets a little bit overwhelming sometimes and then when you step away uh knows you're no longer in front of it and transitions back into peacock feathers um out of rest a lot of stuff there yeah wow that was uh you must have explained this project before i think you seem to have that totally down um practice a little bit it was my thesis yeah no i don't but so um so this is amazing and people are uh you probably don't see the youtube chat there's a small audience here and people are saying all sorts of nice things including how could i buy this was one of the comments so um actually so that's my first question on instagram yeah first question to you which isn't how can i buy this but uh are the is this just currently in your own space have you installed it anywhere else do you have plans to because to me i i kind of i really have a sense of what it is and i can kind of you know use my mind to sort of like try to imagine uh i mean it's absolutely beautiful seeing the documentation of it you've done a really excellent job uh taking video and and imagery of it that i get a good sense of it but i i can't help but think nothing there's no real replacement for being there with it um so is um and i know obviously there's a lot of you know challenges and restrictions in terms of being able to show work um in the last year and um but as things are now changing and opening up um this is something that do you have plans of where you might install this or uh when can i see it in person that's really my question you can see it tomorrow because it's at the itp floor right now oh it is i put it up in the hallways yeah so it'd be great if you go there at night when it's dark so you don't get the white washing you out behind you um but yeah so it's gonna be at itp for a few weeks um i definitely would love to exhibit it anywhere i could get the opportunity to in the future um and yeah i'm kind of exploring this idea kind of just brush the surface of it but this this idea that you can have a physical sculpture that many people have um but the physical sculptures can have customized digital content on them um this future marketplace of you know all these digital assets that are becoming collectibles i think this could be a great um actual use case instead of just fake uh spinning gifts spinning dollar signs i um i own um a couple one piece that's like from a company called infinite objects which is like um they make it's called you know printable video and so there you know obviously you have a much more highly specialized unique like you know uh display i mean their uh infinite object stuff is is amazing but it's more traditional rectangular video as opposed to this like incredible uh spherical display but yes i think you know to me i love having that and um you know i i can see that that's there's a lot of potential there in thinking about how um how people could you know share their artworks and visuals on this over a network uh um and and that sort of thing um one thing just to quickly add it's so funny like i was uh i was watching a twitch stream about shaders the other day and they were basically making all these radial patterns it's amazing how similar they look but also the discussion i was kind of chiming in on the chat there was about dealing with the seam so it depends a lot on what you're doing but um you know there's a lot of tricks in computer graphics in terms of looking at polar coordinates and saying and like um and um being able to you know people are doing this often with like gif loops and using uh purlin noise or simplex noise these different like noise algorithms to be able to sort of like walk through the numbers in a in a radial space to then tie one end to the other so i'm sure you've explored and thought about some of this stuff but to the extent um that's definitely something that comes up a lot in my own sort of teaching and examples and if there's anything that i can help with there definitely let me know this is it it does like to be used for coding trains that i would love it's a small detail but it's it it can make as i'm sure you've discovered like a huge uh difference it's gonna like take you out of the the sort of absolutely the illusion of what you're experiencing once you see that like ah it's a it's a screen because there's this weird line there so um yeah it's a wonderful amazing work i can't i'm so excited to hear what what is today tuesday yes i'll be on the floor tomorrow not at night but i'll try to be able to be cloudy at some point i can take a look at it take a big poster board and hold it behind your back yeah that's awesome and so if people want to find out more about this the qr code and your website are the best place to send them yeah yep or instagram too yeah it's not updated great awesome thank you so much for sharing thanks so much for stopping by now all right okay i have muted myself i'm coming back here how's everybody doing um i see we have a coding train member adriel oliveira that i um i don't know if you're still watching uh i think you must be newish um if you're a new coding trained member um make sure you check um that find the google form that's like linkedin where you sign up um so that we can be in touch and get you uh onboarded into the discord and all that stuff um let's see um let's let me zoom out here uh oh brandon looks like let me go see i wanted to check out the solar fractal so um i'm listening there's a little bit of a conversation going on that i don't want to interrupt um but um um but uh i'll wait as they wind down and maybe we'll we'll see if brandon can give us a nice explanation of this project yes hi sorry i oh now i i have just unmuted your audio i have a i i i'm getting a little better at my system here this is a live broadcast uh uh it's the the appropriate reaction by the way is to run away go somewhere else if you want um but i'm kind of wandering around here and um checking out some of the projects um this is one that i know well because it just happens to be from a class that i'm involved with i guess is a weird way to put it um so do you have a minute brandon to to give us a quick um to introduce yourself and tell us a bit about this project yeah of course so uh yeah i'm i'm brandon uh i was fortunate to be in the nature of code with dan this semester and uh this project is a solarpowered fractal tree so it's uh you know combining what i was learning in the nature of code with fractal trees and l systems um with an enclosure that's uh an epaper display that's being run by an arduino so i had to port a bunch of what we were learning in in class to the arduino ide and uh then it's solarpowered so like a a real plant when it's exposed to light uh that'll generate new growth over time amazing and and this is um i have not yet experienced this in person but this is um you have this there's just one of these right now and you have it uh at home with you or do you have plans for thinking about how you might get yeah oh there it is just the one yeah i'd love to figure out how to simplify it a bit um i had a good chat a moment ago with allison parrish and she was pointing out how um yeah like the minimalist aesthetic i think there's some ways right now there's a lipo battery in it that's not necessarily good for the environment i think the whole thing could be trimmed down to maybe run on a capacitor maybe even lower power so yeah there's i want to do a little tweaking to the hardware but uh yeah certainly uh yeah i'd love to make more of these i think uh you know we were of course talking about mutation in class and in my mind uh some next steps for this would be to have the growth continue for the plant so once it kind of reaches an adult stage it could develop seeds and those seeds could have some random mutations to the rules from the l system uh into the next generation so like over time it could evolve so um yeah it's really interesting to see that we i was just looking at um aiden's project and you know on the one hand you think these are completely unrelated different projects this infinity mirror and this you know small epaper display but they both i think get at something to me that's really exciting about this kind of work which is you know especially in the last year we're all experiencing so much of you know graphics and chat and text and everything through our rectangular traditional very bright computer screens hunched over them and so there's something i think aiden's the infinity mirror is is you know is is very uh like explosive and exciting and dynamic and uh and red bloods but this has this sort of very like quiet and contemplative quality to it but yet it's the same algorithms and kind of graphical systems that i know from that i would see in a p5 sketch so i think there's um there's i think there's some something really lovely about that and i agree i think you know my like my family's super into animal crossing which is so much like gardening and plants and stuff like that but i i love this idea of being able to if i had one to have my own you know little l system plant that i could tend to and care to and share with others and what does it mean that how is mine the same or different than yours and i think there's a lot of potential and possibilities there um and i and i and i love you know what yeah the idea that this is um you know solar powered um it has a kind of handmade uh quality to it that i think you know all those pieces like really work together conceptually as um within in one project which is great yeah thank you so much dan i love those thoughts and i think uh slowing down is something i've been thinking a lot about um and there there are other projects too like i i never show the other wall of my room because the zoom is always facing this way but um yeah there's uh this year moon day clock that i've been infatuated with um that similarly like makes you think about time on a different scale yeah and uh yeah i love i love that this project too can be yeah using so many new technologies but still um kind of make me slow down and and think about time on a different scale yeah wonderful awesome and so if people want to find out more and hopefully you know sign up for your eventual um crowdfunding uh campaign to produce millions of these um where should where should they go i guess the link's right here is the page yeah yeah so my name brandonroots.com i mean i'll post links there eventually uh or you can follow me on instagram be roots but yeah there's a link here for uh the blog posts showing up awesome thank you so much for sharing great work congratulations thank you dan yeah it's great seeing you thank you okay i'm moving along here let me i muted myself i'm gonna go to a welcome room here okay here i am ah the quiet space of the welcome room oh we got the coding train live broadcast with us again yeah but the welcome room is my place to go and like take a beat take a breath oh i pressed the wrong button uh like but because at one point i think it changed like there was a point where the welcome room was everybody was muted with camera off and i was like [Laughter] by the way coding trade audience you are looking at the uh i don't know what the producers organizers the heroes of the itp ima lowrise spring show matt and ellen how is this experience this is like we're flipping the script back you're interviewing me on lip tv now i'm interviewing you been a guest on uh great um no it's been really nice we've had so many amazing people just kind of show up that i hadn't met before um maybe some of you from coding train are coming and joining us and it's just been really nice to meet some new folks and uh yeah we've been talking to students and they're saying that they got some great conversations happening people kind of showing up and chatting and um i don't know ellen and i were just shooting for fun chaos yeah uh not everything crashing and breaking crap chaos so i think so far we're succeeding with uh yeah it's great uh you know this the way you've organized the spatial chat stuff is working super well um and and people in the um just informally in like the youtube chat have been really like everyone's like what's spatial chat who made spatial chat this looks so cool so i think uh we're doing something for the spatial chat company should hopefully give us a discount next year with all the promotions [Laughter] sorry ellen i think i was interrupting you you're about to say something oh just that we have one more hour of the show left so if folks want to want to come join and hang out um we'd we'd love to have you for the next hour yeah and i'm i'm i'm winding down i haven't made it to every room yet i'm going to try to do a couple more but i'm winding down soon so definitely if you're watching this the real experience is the spatial chat url that is in the description as well as pin to the chat so don't don't watch this banter this like exciting banter between very tired after a long semester employees of new york university you got to get into the real thing and get feed off the energy and creativity of all the students in their projects all right i'm going to wander off to the corner to reset the room a bit and figure out where i'm going next so i'll let you get back to your okay welcoming of people okay how we doing everybody i'm muting myself i'm just going off into the corner people are following me oh this is exhausting um there's a few of you still watching i'm um i'm getting seeing some comments here and there in the chat i'm looking at my list of projects um let's see oh i meant to get the live poll going what's the chance oh no this is a terrible idea i have this live poll system that i'm working on to put an overlay on my live streams where people can vote on things and i meant to actually test that out because i i i did it on a recent live stream and had all sorts of issues and thanks to um different viewers who have been contributing a bunch of those issues have been ironed out and i meant to i was thinking oh i could like have people vote but if you're in the chat well i think as i say love wonderful name love um has asked a question how long have you been a professor for well the first class that i taught um formally uh was paid to teach at a university so i guess that's the measurement was in 2004. um at that time i taught as an adjunct um and then a few years later i had a fulltime teaching position um and i've had various iterations of that over the years but i have now been associated with this program this department at nyu for um a little over 20 years now or 20 years exactly because i started in 2001. um all right so that answered that question um let's see so i would like to if you're in the chat there is play games education which i'm really keen on going to that's probably my next stop machine learning perform performance grab bag and installation slash ar so let me know in the chat if you have you can see the rooms here if you have a preference as to where i should go but i think i'm probably going ahead to play games animation there's a project there that i think is of great interest to coding trained viewers called b5 you might recognize b5 yes i'm saying b as in uh bagel not uh uh uh uh pea as in processing uh but maybe that'll be my last stop because honestly like i haven't it's 9 40 at night it was been a very busy day i kind of only had a bit of like a snack for dinner and i'm really starting to feel that pain right now um so i think i want to like allow myself to go to one more room and then kind of wrap up for the night how's everybody how's everybody okay with that so let's head over to play games education here we go and where am i i never know where i am when i drop into a page here people i'm gonna mute them where where am i is this me no here i am that's me oh i'm in b5 that's where i was going uh hold on a sec uh hello uh this is a live broadcast as i uh i see people running for the hills which again is the appropriate reaction uh but you're welcome to stay um so i'm i'm wandering around i'm on the tail end here i've been seeing a lot of projects and my my mind is turning a little bit to mush but i know that this particular project would be of great interest to coding trained viewers with the connection to creative coding uh you can see sort of b5 and how uh as an upside down p looks like uh there p5 um paling i wonder if you could take if you if you have some time to introduce yourself and talk a little bit about this project uh yeah sure so i'm a graduating ima student and also incoming itp student um so this is my capstone project for ima and it's called b5 and it's like a visual programming language for creative coding so visual programming language is basically people use like wires and box instead of lines of code to to make programs um and b5 particularly and focused on creative coding so uh it's like a visual version of p5 and and i hope it's more intuitive and more playful and easier to learn than p5 and yeah so people can kind of get get their hands on it more easily and use it for like learning and fast prototyping and with when they want to learn like creative coding amazing i thought i thought i was muted i'm like looking for my unmute button but i think you can hear me um wonderful uh super exciting to see um so i guess i have a couple questions one is um you know my you know there's a lot of parallels here obviously it's a very different project as well but parallels to things something like scratch which is block based as well as other like data flow environments like max msp jitter scratch being more geared to younger audiences max msp jitter being to sort of you know i don't know if this is accurate to say but uh you know sort of like audio audio video uh advanced users maybe um is there um if you see that the audience for what you're building here is um intersects with p5 users but is it about a different age group or a different way of thinking like how do you differentiate that in your mind what's the i guess if i were to i'm like rambling i can't ask a question in one sentence i really need to like work on that but my question is who is your desired audience for this yeah yeah yeah so so you mentioned scratch and also like more advanced tools like max mxp and so so to me b5 is more like a midpoint uh of those two kinds of projects so uh products so so like in terms of design um it's kind of like a mix of nodebased and blockbased visual programming languages so so scratch is like a blog based so it's it's like you there's still like lines of code but they're like wrapped in blocks and you play with the blocks and for max it's like node base so to kind of connect the blocks with your with your wires and b5 is kind of like a mix of them so it's node based so you still have like separate blocks but also the location of the blocks still matters so so when you place a block like kind of like uh before another block uh their execution order will change so so so this is a particular design that is very special to b5 so you can kind of play with your code or like tweaks a little bit and to to have a like totally different like an effect and also um in terms of like the target users as you mentioned so scratches for like kids or like people who have no experience in programming and like there's definitely a lot of like very advanced or powerful visual programming languages and b5 is uh kind of also like in between so we want to so so i i try to make it like as simple and user friendly as possible follows i i'm trying to kind of give it some power so it can be used for like serious production and also for like a lot of uh you know creative coding projects and also for fast prototyping yeah and that's been the spirit i think of uh of you know the processing project certainly since the beginning it's very challenging to kind of like balance all these different tradeoffs of different audiences but having a tool that is both something that people can get started with very quickly and easily and kind of see results immediately on their sort of first day or first five minutes even as well as that has depth to it and allows you to sort of build larger more involved projects um it's really uh is is really a wonderful sweet spot for these kind of creative coding tools and frameworks so it's great to see that you're kind of exploring exploring that um through this project so i see that you it's you know here on the you know i guess it's to the the right of me left me who knows what direction that is or everything's mirrored and backwards but there's the people can actually just go ahead and try it right now um um and are there what's what are your kind of like next steps for the project i know when we've talked about this before like we've talked about like sort of user testing and like you know sort of longer term roadmap for the project where are you kind of in the journey of it and what sort of like how can people who might be watching like help help out or get involved yeah so uh so first thing for for me of course is continue debugging it so although it's like live right now it's still very buggy and your pro so so it's very not recommended for for alexa's production right now using it and so i'll definitely add more like some basic features to it and also for people who who are interested in this project and also want to contribute uh the best way is probably to design a blog for yourself so you can find like how to design blocking the redmi file in the github repo and it's actually very easy to to kind of design a block and just like push it to the ripple and i guess that's uh the most meaningful or like the most wonky way for for for contributors to contribute to this project right now so designing a block would be something like if um like this might already be implemented but like if they're if purlin noise wasn't available as a block that um i could contribute sort of like code in presumably javascript to write the code for that block you know yeah embed the perlin noise algorithm into it and then that would become part of b5 that people could get have inputs and outputs from that block is that the idea right right yes yes yes and so you can define like the the style of the block the the input output nodes what are they and their descriptions and yeah so so i have a like kind of like a template for that and you can just like put putting those information if i render block for you wonderful awesome cool that's very exciting uh great work it's super exciting to to see and if um i guess if people um have questions or they find issues with it posting in the sort of issues on the github page is that the best place for feedback and questions uh yes definitely awesome all right so everyone please check out and give a b5 editor.app a try um and you can join you can check out the github repo and more info about paling's work at his website there thanks so much for sharing this with us thank you thank you okay i just heard you this is my new technique when i need to like sort of have a momentary break here is just turn off my camera and mute my microphone all right so let's have let me zoom out here and see what we can see um hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy inner oracle itp sandbox and soul train machine says i'll be right back i was kind of wanted to see this allterrain machine but it says i'll be right back so i think we have to wait um i'm looking for oh sub to vizio let's um i think this is i'm trying to hit some low res projects so that's also uh let's see if we can wander over here let me let me turn my camera back on um and mute myself and let's see if i can zoom in hello uh i'm a a live broadcast visitor is this is this project open for business okay hi adam nice to see you um so for anybody who's just kind of oops let me remove myself in this way um who is um a wandering nearby i'm a simul casting this uh spatial chat room to uh to youtube wandering through various projects and uh adam here has graciously just spontaneously agreed to to share his work so if uh could you would if you have a minute to introduce yourself and talk about a subdivisio exclamation point i'd love to hear about it it's starting to there's a little bit you can vary just at this point um and if i subdivide it again then it's taking oops each of those sorry i'm i've done a horrible thing which is that i had an audio glitch the last couple of minutes and so you're on oh it wasn't going through i hate to make you start all the way over um but i have that fixed now if you want to you're welcome to con to but yeah no uh but but yeah so sorry about that i wonder if you could just kind of circle back to the beginning of what you were uh uh explaining for the project sure take it uh go all the way back to the top or just start talking about the project yeah go introduce yourself again because i think uh it's great for people to get to know about your um work and where you're coming from if you don't mind yeah no problem all right cool um yeah so i'm adam colstock i'm a a computer science and a steam teacher in chicago for fourth through eighth graders uh and i've created on my um in the low res ima program um the first class of it about to graduate this summer uh so i've created subdivisio which is a tool that allows you to explore algorithmic art using one particular subdivision algorithm and so i can sort of just quickly walk through what what's happening with that um so the idea is you've got a foursided shape that you start with and then you can divide it up once using this top slider so the division that it's doing is it's taking one point along the top edge and one point along the left edge and the opposite vertex from those two edges and it's connecting those up along a point that lies along the diagonal and so if i uh start to drag that point then it varies the design because these two points are both dependent on the position of the top point sort of how far along the line it is uh what proportion of the line it takes up and if i divide it again then it took each of those three cells and applied the same rule so this top cell here took two points along the edge and the opposite vertex and the same for the other one even though it's not a square it's a different kind of uh foursided shape um it's doing the same rule but already at this point i can start to play around with the design a little bit so rather than using that same orientation for the first cell i can rotate it so you can see that that line that's connecting into the vertex is changing which orientation it has you could do that for any of the cells and then you can also add color um and so applying multiple subdivisions you start to get uh some patterns that emerge that you can play with by changing the color um of it and it has some elements of transparency so you can start to control what points are what colors are shining through and then the last thing i think that's a little bit interesting is right now it's all dependent on this top point um so if this line if this point is halfway so is this point and that point um but i could imagine those points not being tied to each other in terms of how far along the lines up they are so you can change the number of draggable points so if i have two then the top one becomes independent from the one over here and one middle is still dependent on the top one or you could have it so that all three points are independent so you can sort of play around yeah the design even more that way wow i can imagine just being sort of like hypnotized and you know i i i might often when i'm working on like a code example or something i can i can just spend hours and hours tweaking little like parameters and numbers and i i could really imagine having that kind of rich experience with this um i guess one thing i'm curious about especially with your background as a teacher um one is there a particular i mean i obviously i think this has a very wide audience like i would enjoy this as much as a fourth grader might enjoy this but um yeah is there a particular i guess i'm curious was there a particular like age group or kind of uh you know curriculum like my daughter who happens to be in fourth gr fourth grade came home today and said i learned decimals today so is there a particular um like topic and either math or uh geometry or computer science that this like specifically relates to from your teaching practice or um where did you get the idea for this i guess is kind of one way of asking the question yeah let me start with that question actually and then i can cycle around to the first one so i got the idea um i've been teaching uh for about 10 years or so and since i started teaching there's um software called dynamic geometry software um keyometer sketchpad is one example geogebra is an online version um and they really take advantage of the idea that uh there's all sorts of interesting geometric explorations you can do in a learning environment in which you can create geometric constructions by drawing points and lines and identifying relationships and constraints like things are parallel or defining particular angles but then dragging so that the things that have those relationships maintain them but those that can can very do and you can start to sort of see and explore different kinds of representations even like what the difference between an isosceles and an equilateral triangle is by um you know making it so two sides are the same length and then dragging any of the three points and seeing what's staying the same and what's changing different and you can be doing that with kids that are sort of in elementary school so i had that software um we would use it for some lessons um but i also started to like mess around and sort of create more artistic designs with it and i really enjoyed that um so one of the answers to the question is i'm interested in just a tool that will provide sort of a bridge between visual arts and mathematics so maybe you're coming to it with a visual arts background and you haven't really um thought about programming or algorithms much before um but you could step in and use this tool and it might sort of change about uh change how you think about what you're creating or maybe even lead you to want to like learn more about this kind of thing or you might be a programmer or mathematician someone that really enjoys numbers and then programming but haven't done much in the visual arts and you could come in and sort of see how some of the things that you're familiar with are being implied and applied in a visual thinking kind of way um so i think that's like my main motivation you know independent of age even um but uh certainly i i like the idea that um i teach at a school where we try and do things in an interdisciplinary way um so you know being able to come with up with a project that has an artistic output but which you could be exploring you know even with this one the idea that like how are these lines how are these points related they're the same proportion along each line so what is you know what does that mean for them to be the same proportion along the line um that could lead into something about the golden ratio if you wanted to or there's all kinds of directions you can take different things like that i i haven't been there to this place that i'm about to mention in a while because you know it's been a year of coronavirus but um the museum of math here in new york um has a lot of exhibits that i think kind of like strike a really nice balance there of being able to kind of just play um in a really sort of create playful creative uh um improvisational way um uh but kind of also and tying those to specific um kind of wellknown algorithms or techniques and kind of wandering back and forth between thinking about the math behind something versus just enjoying the sort of aesthetic quality and the sort of like surprise and discovery of it so i could really imagine um this project um working really well in you know that's what you know i think just being on the web is like in many ways just like the perfect place for it but also um like being in uh a kind of context like like the museum of math um um it really would fit right into that kind of space so great work and so if folks want to try it out i see the the best place is just to go right to the link that's right here there's a video um and um and yeah is there any any other links that people should go to or know about if they want to like learn more about this work or you uh no at this point those are the the two most direct links i would say about a month or so from now it'll probably all be put together in a website for you know my uh thesis project but uh for now those are the the best way to be able to explore it a little bit awesome great all right so this is i forget that with the for the lowres uh uh program um you're you while while this is the end of a semester there's like a big thing happening this summer which is like really more of the culmination so it's exciting to hear that you'll be continuing to work on this and i can't wait to uh follow and see where it leads great thanks wonderful thank you so much for sharing sure no problem okay i have muted and i'm wandering zooming out let's see soul train machine is back i think we should finish off with soul train machine bye is it okay if i barge on in here with my giant live broadcast sign yes oh my god that [ __ ] then um i'm uh i'm i'm running on empty here running on fumes here i've been kind of like wandering around yeah but i i thought i saw i saw soul train machine i thought this could be a way to complete the circle of this strange evening in spatial chat so um um yeah so in case anybody who's happens to be nearby i'm kind of simulcasting this um on youtube to a small audience right now um kind of wandering around so feel free to some people have done the appropriate reaction of just run away it seems like i'm near them but mary hopefully you'll stay um would you mind do you have a minute to introduce yourself and tell us a little bit about this project to take us out of this uh what's the what's the word to like close it's not the end of the evening because i know this is going on for 30 more minutes but yeah that's like as i hear my your your broadcast yes my bro yes thank you it would be my pleasure so my name is mary no terry i am a graduating itp second year and uh the project i'm presenting tonight is the first in a series of prototypes that i will be making over the next few months uh that i'm building towards what i'm calling the soul train machine so when i say soul train i mean soul train like the longrunning tv show where people showed off their amazing moves and new music in new fashion and so this is a project that's very much grounded in the vocabulary of that style of funk soul disco so i used the ml5 neural network to train a an algorithm on some very basic disco moves that i just did in front of the camera uh in or this in order to do this prototype so the two moves are and you can go to the link up here uh and test it out yourself but the two the moves are uh like a snap up here a roll and a like head shape like a tina turner style head shake um and at the moment the what i'm building towards is having those be triggers for musical events at the moment the musical events are mostly just triggered by pressing a button uh but there are some sliders where it's like if you're closer to the camera it gets uh clearer there's a lowpass filter or if you go up and down the volume goes up and down um but the idea is yeah to turn this into a standalone web app where a couple of people can join in and control music through their groovy dance moves awesome and so this can be tried out right now at this very moment just by going to that link that's right there oh i just clicked on it okay hold on i'm i'm gonna save this i'm gonna uh oh my goodness okay i'm going to uh i'm coming back to spatial chat uh i'm gonna go that'll be a perfect thing for me to test and try you know one of the things um that i that i've actually like um that i find to be a challenge with um some of these systems that do pose detection especially on the web oh my goodness and i think my i have to actually close this because my computer is about to freak out um is that people use their computer like the way that i'm right now which is kind of like hunched over it like with my face next to the laptop whereas this really is about i'm imagining and it strikes me from your description of the sort of like full body um you know like let it all out kind of experience and i you know i know that you know to the extent that you that you're still in development with this like is that something that um do you have any have you been have you tested with people is that something that you've sort of thought about of how to like uh sort of onboard people into being in the right sort of like physical space and mindset for it or oh that's a really good question and i haven't gotten to the stage of user testing inside of me and my roommates so we will see and we're all pretty out there people to begin with um but that's something that i'm definitely gonna have to keep in mind and i think uh i guess i also am aiming to create an uh a browserbased experience that is if that evokes uh a certain like time and space like time and place uh and i this is kind of for people who like me um and so uh but that's i really appreciate that question because i have a tendency to design for myself sometime yeah well it's a great way to start i don't know it's yeah it's just something that like i've just i've spent a lot of time working with the postdetection stuff as you probably uh um no and so like it's it's something that's sort of like always top of mind for me but i i love i just like like i think you have a successful interactive webbased project if you can get people to like stand up and move their whole body like it's such a nice like goal to like to break people out of um kind of their just sort of default way of sitting engaging in their computer so that's super it's super cool and exciting to see and i i i i i'm so thrilled and excited to see as a nice note to end on to sort of see uh the ml5 neural network and the posenet um machine learning model which are two things that i've spent a lot of time like banging on for um the last uh bunch of years so it's great it's really exciting to see those applied in a project here and i have to thank you for banging on them i have to thank you very very much for saving my rump in more than like in terms of making this work so thank you awesome well congratulations um i'm gonna what i'm gonna do actually this is perfect i'm gonna see if i can get it to work with me as i leave as i launch um and off into um it's like way past my bedtime this is insane that it's after 10 o'clock at night all of a sudden so thank you so much for sharing this
