00:00 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]
00:00 - OK, that was the
sound effect this time
00:02 - for my substitute train whistle.
00:04 - Welcome back.
00:04 - You came back.
00:05 - That's so nice of you.
00:06 - I'm here in the
second video in my
00:08 - How to Make a
Discord Bot series.
00:10 - I actually was just
recording this,
00:12 - but I had a technical problem,
so I'm doing this again.
00:14 - But that means I'm
going to be perfect.
00:16 - I'm not going to
make any mistakes.
00:17 - Very rarely happens, I mean
I will make lots of mistakes.
00:20 - So where do you need
to be doing now?
00:21 - The first thing where I want
to get started in this video
00:23 - is I want to make the
Discord bot itself.
00:27 - I'm going to need to do that
through the Discord website.
00:29 - So go to Discord.com.
00:31 - Make sure you're signed
up with an account
00:33 - and you're logged in.
00:34 - You can scroll all the
way down to the bottom
00:36 - and look for where
it says Developers.
00:39 - So if I click here, I am now in
the Discord Developer portal.
00:43 - So there's lots of
information here.
00:45 - I encourage you to read
it through, take a look
00:46 - at this stuff, read about
all the possibilities
00:48 - and the polices.
00:49 - But what I want to do here
is go under Applications.
00:53 - You can see here I've made
several applications already.
00:55 - I've been making Discord
bots for a little while now.
00:57 - I have a bot that I made
for the ITPIMA program.
01:00 - That's the department
that I teach
01:01 - at at NYU School of the Arts.
01:03 - I have a dad bot which
will tell you dad jokes.
01:06 - It's dormant right now.
01:07 - I've got to revive that one.
01:08 - And then two other example
bots for different courses
01:10 - that I've been
teaching here at NYU.
01:12 - So it's time now for us to
make our coding train bot.
01:15 - So I'm going to click
New Application.
01:19 - Are you a game dev?
01:21 - Oh, my goodness, this is such
a deep philosophical question.
01:24 - I'm not a game dev.
01:25 - I am going to name my
application Coding Train Bot,
01:29 - and I'm going to call
it Application here.
01:31 - This is a little
bit silly, but this
01:32 - is-- there's a difference
between the application
01:35 - and the bot itself,
which I will get to.
01:37 - That will become evident as I
go a little further through this
01:39 - here.
01:40 - So I'm going to hit Create.
01:41 - I want to have a neat icon.
01:43 - I actually spent
like a half an hour
01:46 - earlier trying to
pick which icon.
01:48 - And I'm just going to
go straight to it now--
01:50 - rainbow hearts.
01:53 - Can't go wrong with
rainbow hearts.
01:55 - And then look, I've got some
important information here.
01:59 - I've got a client ID.
02:01 - This number is really important.
02:03 - I'm going to make use of that
in just a moment in order
02:05 - to add the bot to a
particular Discord server.
02:09 - I also have the client secret.
02:11 - This is a secret key that
you absolutely should not
02:14 - show to anybody else.
02:16 - For example, I really, really
definitely should not right now
02:19 - hit Click to reveal.
02:20 - Ahhh!
02:22 - All of you will not be
able to hack my account,
02:25 - because if you do
this by accident,
02:26 - it's not the end of the world.
02:28 - I can very quickly
just hit Regenerate
02:30 - and I've got a new
one that you also see.
02:32 - Don't worry.
02:33 - Later, before you watch this,
I'll have regenerated it.
02:36 - The client secret
actually isn't something
02:38 - that I'm going to use at
all in this video series.
02:41 - The client secret
is a code that you
02:42 - need if you were making a
Discord integration from a game
02:45 - or some other broader context.
02:47 - And all I'm doing
is making a bot.
02:49 - And I want to talk to the
Discord API from my bot.
02:52 - For that, I need something
else called a bot token.
02:55 - So let's move on
to that next stage,
02:57 - and I'm going to go down here.
02:59 - So even though I've
made the application,
03:01 - I have not made the bot itself.
03:04 - So I want to look over
here and find Bot.
03:06 - Click there.
03:07 - I don't have a bot
yet, but I can get one.
03:10 - Let's add a bot.
03:12 - Yes, do it.
03:15 - The username will just be--
let's call it Choo Choo Bot.
03:19 - This here, this token that
I'm about to reveal to you,
03:22 - this is something that I
will need for the code.
03:24 - And also, this is
something I'm really
03:26 - going to have to think about.
03:27 - If I'm putting this
token in the code,
03:29 - and then I open source
my project so you
03:31 - can use this as
an example, I want
03:33 - to make sure that I don't
include the token in that.
03:35 - So I will address that later
on as I get to future videos,
03:38 - but for right now, I just
want to make note of that.
03:40 - And I'll be coming back
to that in the next video.
03:43 - We're almost there.
03:44 - I've got my Discord account.
03:46 - I've made my client application.
03:48 - And now I attached a bot to
that particular application.
03:53 - The next thing I
want to do is make
03:55 - this bot a member of the Coding
Train Discord server itself.
03:59 - To do that, I need to go
back to General Information,
04:02 - and I need to grab
this client ID.
04:06 - Once I have the client ID
copied into my clipboard,
04:09 - I can paste it into
this URL path--
04:12 - discord.com/oaut
h2/authorize?cli
04:15 - ent_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID--
04:18 - I'm going to paste
it right in here.
04:20 - And this now is a
particular URL that you
04:23 - could embed into a
website or send to anybody
04:25 - if you wanted them to add your
bot to a particular server.
04:29 - And this brings up an important
question about trust, right?
04:34 - In this case, right now,
I am the maker of the bot
04:38 - and I am the owner
of the Discord server
04:40 - to which I'm going
to add that bot.
04:42 - So I am just trusting myself.
04:44 - And I think it's going to be OK.
04:46 - But if somebody were to
send you a link to their bot
04:49 - and say, please add
this to your server,
04:51 - or if you're just asking people
willy nilly, please add my bot,
04:54 - please add my bot, there's
trust that has to happen there.
04:57 - Bots have a lot of
permissions and things
04:58 - they could do in a server,
and could really wreak havoc.
05:01 - So this is something I'm
going to have to think about.
05:03 - How do I vet people's
creative bots
05:04 - that they make to
include into the server?
05:06 - Maybe I'll come up with a
process for that someday.
05:08 - But most likely, if you're
going to take this next step,
05:11 - you might not have
permissions right now
05:13 - to add a bot to any
server you're a member of.
05:15 - So you might need to create
your own Discord server first.
05:18 - When you're logged into Discord,
you'll see a plus button,
05:21 - Add a Server.
05:22 - That's the place you could
start to create your own server
05:25 - for testing your bot.
05:26 - But for me, I'm just going
to take this particular URL,
05:31 - open up a new tab and
paste it in, and hit Enter.
05:34 - And now, here we are.
05:35 - Coding Train Bot Application,
Connect to Discord.
05:38 - It's going to give me a
list of servers where I have
05:41 - the manage server permission.
05:45 - So I have the manage server
permission for these servers.
05:48 - I want to add it to
Coding Train Choo Choo.
05:50 - I'm going to click Authorize.
05:52 - It's very exciting.
05:54 - All right, and then
I'm going to click--
05:56 - but, but I am a robot!
05:58 - I'm a bot!
05:59 - I'm a robot!
06:01 - What do I do?
06:03 - As a human being, I am
the maker of the bot,
06:05 - so I guess I can click
this, I'm not a robot.
06:08 - And it's authorized.
06:09 - Let's head over to the
Coding Train Discord server.
06:11 - I can actually quickly
check the passenger log.
06:14 - That's a channel that
whenever a new user joins,
06:18 - a message is posted there.
06:19 - And look what we've
got at the bottom here,
06:22 - welcome aboard Choo Choo Bot.
06:24 - Choo Choo bot better read
that code of conduct.
06:27 - And Choo Choo bot has
hopped into the server.
06:29 - So I know that the
bot is there and I
06:31 - am ready for the next step.
06:33 - I'm going to head over to a
channel called Bot Testing.
06:36 - This is the channel
that I'm going to use
06:38 - for working with the bot.
06:39 - Eventually, I might let the bot
run rampant all over the server
06:43 - itself and all the
other channels.
06:45 - But as I'm figuring out and
getting the basics working,
06:47 - I want to stay in this channel.
06:48 - Let's just mention it to
make sure it's really there.
06:51 - There it is.
06:52 - Hi.
06:53 - So at some point, I could
certainly, from the code, see,
06:57 - did somebody mention
the bot, did mention me?
06:59 - And then reply appropriately.
07:01 - So that's what I'll
be getting into next.
07:02 - We were there.
07:04 - We've now made-- have
a Discord account,
07:07 - made a Discord
application, added a bot
07:10 - to that application, and
then authorized that bot
07:13 - on a particular Discord server.
07:14 - If we've done all of that, we
are ready for the next step,
07:18 - actually writing some code
to connect to the Discord
07:21 - API itself, and have that bot
communicate and participate
07:24 - in the Discord community.
07:26 - And that'll be fun.
07:27 - I can't wait.
07:27 - I'm going to go do that now.
07:29 - And I'll see you
there if you want.
07:30 - That's what I said last
time in the last video.
07:32 - Where's the whistle?
07:33 - [TRAIN WHISTLE]

Cleaned transcript:

[TRAIN WHISTLE] OK, that was the sound effect this time for my substitute train whistle. Welcome back. You came back. That's so nice of you. I'm here in the second video in my How to Make a Discord Bot series. I actually was just recording this, but I had a technical problem, so I'm doing this again.
