04:49 - check one two here comes my mic uh let
04:52 - me know how the audio is over here oh
04:55 - double audio that could very well be
04:57 - happening
04:59 - yeah i'm uh
05:02 - uh
05:03 - why would that be happening
05:05 - [Music]
05:07 - well
05:09 - i'm coming on in a moment hopefully
05:11 - you're hearing my voice just once at
05:12 - least

06:21 - [Music]
06:24 - hello everybody good morning
06:26 - happy
06:27 - coding train on youtube live stream
06:31 - my name is dan i will be your host for
06:34 - today on this approximately two hour
06:37 - live stream with a bit of a break in the
06:40 - middle i'm just looking over here to see
06:42 - that i see green bars on my audio i see
06:44 - a preview image of myself on a little
06:46 - monitor in front of me this means i see
06:49 - a green light on open broadcast studio
06:51 - that me this means that everything is
06:52 - working well and i am coming to you live
06:55 - from the hudson valley of new york it's
06:57 - a warm day outside but the temperature
07:00 - is dropping i have sorted out the
07:02 - heating in this garage space so i'm
07:05 - quite comfortable right now but i have
07:07 - disabled and turned off and shut
07:09 - everything down so hopefully there will
07:10 - be no noise interruptions for today now
07:12 - before i get started with my list of
07:14 - things to cover today on this highly
07:17 - organized episode of the coding train
07:19 - let me take a moment to thank today's
07:21 - sponsor i hope this works
07:24 - brilliant do you like learning are you
07:27 - watching the coding train because you
07:28 - like computer science and algorithms and
07:30 - math and fractals and all sorts of fun
07:33 - stuff well watching videos and reading
07:36 - essays and books and text is one way to
07:38 - learn and i hope that you enjoy my
07:40 - videos but really if you want to really
07:42 - dive in and learn
07:43 - i might suggest that you check out
07:45 - brilliant
07:46 - it is full of interactive lessons around
07:49 - all of the kind of concepts and topics i
07:51 - talk about on the coding train in the
07:53 - middle of today's live stream i will
07:55 - come back and look at some of their
07:56 - courses and maybe try my hand at an
07:58 - exercise or two but you can sign up for
08:00 - free right now
08:02 - at brilliant.org codingtrain it lets
08:04 - them know that you found brilliant from
08:06 - me dan the coding train and they go wow
08:09 - dan recommended us and look all of that
08:11 - stuff
08:12 - um
08:13 - and then of course if you would like to
08:15 - unlock all of their premium features and
08:17 - courses you could do so and you'll get
08:19 - 20 off through that link for the first
08:20 - 200 people who sign up all right
08:23 - moving along here uh nope this is still
08:25 - the right button um um what's happening
08:28 - so first of all you might be wondering
08:30 - and i'm on item number item number two i
08:32 - said brilliant was item number one i do
08:34 - number two i'm on i'm on it says twitch
08:36 - so let me talk about that
08:38 - and i'm gonna take a peek at the chat
08:40 - here
08:40 - um okay
08:43 - uh do you read the comments sort of
08:46 - sometimes maybe arbitrarily if you see
08:48 - me looking this way it means i'm reading
08:50 - the chat i also actually have the chat
08:52 - over here but the font is so incredibly
08:55 - tiny i have to do this and then i have
08:57 - to take my glasses off and look up
08:59 - really close and it says hi dan you're
09:01 - the best i'm learning js thanks to you
09:03 - only ciao from italy
09:05 - ah
09:06 - okay
09:07 - so
09:10 - what's going on with the coding train
09:12 - live streams well i am experimenting
09:14 - with the platform known as twitch i like
09:17 - things that start with the twist sound
09:19 - like tuesday or twen's day today's
09:22 - friday
09:24 - so i've been i had this idea that i was
09:25 - going to stream on twitch on tuesdays
09:28 - and youtube on fridays no alliteration
09:31 - there there's no day of the week that
09:32 - starts with a u is there
09:34 - un
09:35 - saturday you use you today you today
09:38 - today is due today youtube bidet
09:41 - streaming
09:42 - no this is not going anywhere um
09:44 - i don't know i i'm 2022 is a new year
09:47 - for me because i have sabbatical from
09:48 - teaching and so i'm focusing on some new
09:50 - things you might have noticed
09:52 - that uh two coding challenge videos came
09:54 - out
09:55 - um slide puzzle and ascii to
09:59 - kind of like an image to ascii coding
10:01 - challenge which if you haven't watched
10:03 - please take a look at it lots of people
10:04 - are watching it it's one of my most
10:06 - uh sort of like immediately popular
10:08 - videos i mean it's all relative what's
10:10 - popular not popular on youtube but for
10:12 - me
10:13 - it's off the charts in terms of my sort
10:15 - of recent string of videos um and i've
10:18 - got another one
10:20 - which is coming out hopefully tomorrow
10:22 - because i released the ascii one
10:23 - saturday at about 11 a.m ish eastern i'm
10:26 - gonna try to do the same tomorrow
10:28 - and i'm going to talk a little bit about
10:29 - what's in that video tomorrow coming so
10:32 - i'm trying to get back to my roots of a
10:35 - weekly coding challenge video for 2022
10:38 - um because i have a more a bit of more
10:40 - of elaborate production process if you
10:42 - watched that ascii coding challenge
10:44 - there's a lot more editing and
10:46 - additional graphics and things so um
10:48 - some bells and whistles literal bells
10:50 - and whistles
10:52 - are not literal because they're like
10:54 - sound effect bells anyway this is not
10:56 - the point um so i'm i was sort of
10:58 - experimenting with the idea of having
11:00 - sort of weekly edited videos on youtube
11:03 - open-ended live streams on twitch but
11:06 - i'm still gonna stream on youtube right
11:08 - now at least because i'm trying both
11:09 - platforms but um let me at least alert
11:12 - you to
11:14 - if you want to kind of follow me
11:16 - everywhere which i'm not suggesting you
11:17 - need to do by any means whatsoever let
11:20 - me at least um
11:22 - pull this up
11:25 - uh this is the twitch channel uh
11:27 - twitch.tv
11:30 - codingtrain a choo choo
11:32 - choo choo was taken i believe as well as
11:34 - coding train so i
11:35 - put them up it's not a portmanteau
11:37 - exactly but uh it's two words just
11:40 - smooshed together coding train choo choo
11:42 - if you have an idea for a
11:43 - a available name that i could take
11:45 - that's better than this uh feel free to
11:47 - let me know um you can see some recent
11:50 - broadcasts both of the
11:52 - um
11:53 - live streams i'm sorry both of the
11:55 - coding challenges the ascii one and the
11:58 - prime spiral were both recorded on
12:00 - twitch and then if you're looking for
12:02 - the archives i didn't think it made
12:04 - sense to just like re-upload them to
12:06 - this channel obviously this live stream
12:09 - on youtube will live on this channel but
12:11 - if you're looking for coding train
12:13 - twitch i just made a new channel on
12:16 - youtube codingtrain twitch archive it
12:18 - doesn't even show up on google
12:20 - no oh no codingtrain here it is oh no
12:23 - here it is here it is this is a video
12:25 - from it there we go
12:27 - uh coding train twitch archive uh here
12:30 - here somebody can put this into the chat
12:33 - uh that's the just write that um channel
12:36 - down i guess i could give myself one of
12:37 - those vanity urls at some point but you
12:40 - can see the live the recent live streams
12:43 - on twitch are all here for you to go
12:45 - back and look at if you want to kind of
12:47 - catch up with that
12:50 - let me see here
12:52 - um
12:53 - [Music]
12:54 - if anything in the chat that i want to
12:56 - refer to youtube's day oh
12:59 - joseph
13:01 - suggest youtube's day the thing is i i i
13:04 - i got to stick to my list
13:07 - but
13:08 - um but just bear but but but indulge me
13:11 - for a moment um which is that one of the
13:14 - things that i have absolutely learned at
13:16 - the start of this year with my
13:17 - sabbatical is that teaching
13:19 - is not ultimately the impediment to me
13:23 - um
13:24 - really producing uh sort of regularly
13:27 - scheduled regular uh uh
13:29 - um frequent content on youtube
13:33 - there are lots of other things life gets
13:34 - in the way and i have other projects and
13:37 - initiatives that i'm working on
13:39 - so i'm not uh able to just suddenly like
13:43 - dive in in the way that i might have
13:45 - thought
13:46 - but i am getting these coding challenges
13:48 - out and i really want to use 2022 to
13:50 - experiment and sort of find the right
13:52 - balance between the different things
13:53 - that i'm doing with what i assume will
13:55 - be a return to teaching in 2023 although
13:58 - you never know never say never
14:02 - the sky's the limit with this youtube
14:04 - thing
14:05 - it's a little bit niche the creative
14:06 - coding tutorial stuff but you know you
14:08 - never know um
14:11 - and so for right now what i am hoping to
14:14 - focus on at least immediately is getting
14:17 - these kind of like fun
14:18 - short and short being like 20 to 30
14:20 - minute coding challenges videos out i
14:23 - want to say every week but i think three
14:25 - per month is maybe a more realistic
14:27 - promise um i have something next anyway
14:31 - so i have some other stuff on my
14:32 - schedule and family commitments and
14:33 - stuff it's going to make the next coding
14:35 - challenge a little bit harder so the
14:36 - other thing that i'll mention
14:38 - where can i find this oh yeah if i go to
14:40 - twitch
14:42 - and i go to
14:44 - i don't really know
14:46 - uh twitch very well
14:48 - uh videos maybe oh no you know what i
14:50 - can just do i can do slash
14:52 - clips
14:54 - that is not how you spell clips
14:58 - coding train
15:01 - choo choo
15:02 - slash clips
15:05 - um so one of the things that i'm doing
15:08 - is that i and you can see that it's
15:10 - clipped like at the end so um i'm kind
15:13 - of trying to develop this rhythm
15:15 - where i record a coding challenge
15:18 - uh
15:19 - and then after i do that i spin a wheel
15:22 - i mean i've kind of done this before
15:23 - this might not be totally new to you but
15:25 - i'm trying to formalize this a bit more
15:27 - of ideas that i feel like will fit well
15:29 - into the format
15:30 - um and you can see this clip here
15:34 - um let's see if the audio comes through
15:36 - yeah
15:41 - i just did the ulan spiral recorded
15:42 - today's coding challenge and now i'm
15:44 - spinning the wheel for the next one
15:46 - which i will record next friday although
15:48 - i might have a conflict next friday we
15:49 - shall see sometime next week what are we
15:51 - going to get
15:52 - i do not have a conflict next friday
15:54 - because i'm here
15:57 - no keep going keep going keep going oh
16:00 - no no no
16:03 - and you'll see here that where we landed
16:06 - last week was the end body problem thus
16:09 - the title of today's stream the end body
16:12 - problem and i i so my process is and
16:15 - you'll see this in the prime spiral
16:17 - video like when i begin that coding
16:20 - challenge i have a pretty good sense in
16:21 - my head of what the prime spiral is
16:23 - because before i recorded that i you
16:25 - know read the wikipedia page and did a
16:27 - little research on it like very sort of
16:29 - perfunctory and i was kind of aware of
16:31 - what it was before also
16:33 - um
16:34 - but i hadn't programmed it before which
16:36 - i think really is important because as
16:38 - you'll see
16:40 - what is that sound i think it's just the
16:42 - wind but as you'll see i get stuck um a
16:45 - tree came down outside last night it's
16:47 - been very windy here but that was not a
16:49 - tree falling down um as you'll see in
16:51 - the video that comes out tomorrow please
16:53 - watch it when it comes out tomorrow if
16:54 - you don't mind
16:55 - or a monday enjoy your weekend don't
16:57 - watch youtube videos about coding on the
16:59 - weekend if that's not your thing um if
17:01 - you're watching this right now to be
17:02 - honest it probably is your thing
17:05 - um
17:07 - oh but i get stuck and confused quite a
17:09 - bit and make lots of mistakes and i
17:10 - think that's sort of the uh
17:12 - you know dare i say charm but more that
17:15 - what's important for me to communicate
17:17 - is show that
17:18 - this is the process getting stuck
17:20 - struggling trying to figure it out and
17:22 - uh you know i can't remember who
17:24 - suggested this so apologize someone in
17:26 - the discord suggested that i could do
17:27 - like a year-end wrap-up and rate all my
17:30 - counting coding challenges from gravy
17:32 - train or from train wreck all the way to
17:34 - gravy train that one was probably in the
17:35 - middle it wasn't definitely wasn't a
17:37 - train wreck because i successfully
17:38 - solved it at the end
17:40 - probably if i would like try to think of
17:41 - the train wreck ones um that fluid
17:43 - simulation thing that i did that i
17:45 - really didn't understand and i was just
17:46 - trying to like type out formulas from a
17:47 - paper that was kind of nuts um
17:52 - so i'm just taking a picture of that so
17:54 - that's why the end body problem hits
17:55 - here so let me come back to that because
17:57 - i am going down my list i talked about
18:00 - twitch
18:02 - so um
18:03 - [Music]
18:04 - the other thing that i'm working on is i
18:06 - will soon be probably next week or you
18:09 - know march first maybe let's just put a
18:11 - date on it i will be putting out a big
18:13 - survey oh i don't know biggest right
18:15 - word i'll be putting out a regularly
18:17 - sized survey for the coding train
18:20 - viewers and community it's going to have
18:22 - lots of questions about what videos you
18:23 - like what what do you like about the
18:25 - live streams what you don't like i'm
18:27 - really trying to pare down and focus on
18:30 - what i think is not just like what is
18:31 - most popular with the audience so i'm
18:33 - not just going to like do
18:34 - [Music]
18:35 - uh
18:36 - you know sort of go in the i try to
18:38 - fight against the urge to just go in the
18:39 - direction of clicks
18:41 - although i can't help myself most of the
18:43 - time
18:44 - um
18:45 - but i want to hear from you and kind of
18:47 - figure out what makes the most sense and
18:49 - whether you prefer twitch or youtube for
18:51 - the live streams do you like the coding
18:52 - challenges do you like the tutorial
18:53 - videos
18:54 - somebody in the chat
18:56 - earlier said um and steve parker is
18:59 - asking let's see if this button works
19:00 - did not work i have a button on my
19:02 - stream deck that's supposed to post a
19:04 - link to the discord
19:06 - in the chat it doesn't it's just
19:09 - slash thecodingtrain.com
19:10 - or discord dot gg slash coding train
19:13 - those will take you to the coding train
19:14 - discord um
19:16 - you can barely hear me turn up your
19:18 - volume
19:20 - all right mike gained is a tad low i see
19:23 - that i worry because i really hate it
19:25 - when it's speaking so here's the deal
19:27 - people
19:28 - i will gladly turn up my by the way i
19:30 - ordered a new mic
19:32 - this is like a pretty old lab and i was
19:34 - having all sorts of interference that i
19:35 - ordered a higher quality one i need to
19:37 - do a lot of sound proofing in here still
19:39 - because it is quite echoey i don't know
19:40 - if you can hear that um so
19:43 - sound will be different after today's
19:44 - stream
19:45 - but i will turn the volume up for all of
19:48 - you i'm doing that right now
19:50 - i turned up the gain here
19:52 - so um but i would really like you to let
19:55 - me know if if any distortion or peaking
19:58 - happens it's like just a pet peeve of
19:59 - mine it really bothers me doesn't really
20:02 - it's not so great to like have it so low
20:04 - that we don't hear that because then
20:05 - anyway
20:06 - but hopefully that helps so um
20:09 - [Music]
20:10 - somebody in the chat it was a while ago
20:12 - and i filed this in the back of my brain
20:13 - briefly asked about like oh what about a
20:15 - series about processing for the pie
20:18 - so i would like to get back and today is
20:20 - a little
20:22 - toe dip into that
20:24 - i would like to get back to recording
20:26 - sort of more tutorial series that are
20:29 - like chunks of videos that are sequins
20:30 - that build upon each other and i think
20:32 - where i'm landing is i'm going to do
20:35 - much
20:36 - less production value on those and by
20:38 - production value image image and sound
20:41 - is kind of the same across the board but
20:43 - in terms of the amount of editing and
20:45 - additional animation i'm kind of leaving
20:48 - those for the coding challenge videos
20:50 - and especially videos that are have the
20:52 - potential to be more evergreen because
20:55 - for example i put a lot of effort into
20:57 - those discord bot tutorials that i made
20:59 - and they're basically completely
21:00 - irrelevant because discord updated their
21:02 - api uh anyway and i also just want to be
21:05 - able to make those faster so i hope to
21:07 - be
21:08 - getting uh some clipping now okay so
21:11 - just gonna turn it down a tiny bit
21:13 - there is a slight buzz
21:15 - i should so hope
21:17 - i'm going to ask about that in a second
21:19 - but um i um
21:22 - oh my goodness
21:23 - pi day is coming up
21:26 - holy okay adding this to my list
21:29 - because i actually am going i will be
21:32 - traveling
21:33 - i have done so little traveling in a few
21:35 - years but i think that i have a chance
21:38 - to do some
21:39 - in march
21:42 - um and i will be doing some traveling
21:45 - um
21:46 - [Music]
21:48 - uh i will be away on pi day so there
21:51 - will not be almost definitely not be a
21:53 - pi day live stream but i should prepare
21:56 - a coding challenge in advance of that to
21:59 - release on pi day and i better record
22:01 - that i'm going to have to
22:03 - i have to add just do a wheel spin of pi
22:06 - day ideas
22:07 - just for pi day so i i'm i'm in the
22:10 - market i have no idea for what i plan to
22:12 - do for pi day this year
22:14 - so i'm in the market for something
22:16 - usually i just take something that like
22:18 - stand up math or three blue one brown or
22:20 - some other youtube channel did years ago
22:22 - i'm like let me make my own version of
22:23 - that but uh um yeah pi day on a train i
22:27 - will not be on a train like i i i my
22:30 - preferred method it will come as no
22:31 - surprise to you of travellers train i
22:34 - really um
22:36 - uh my dream actually i would really like
22:37 - to go to japan this summer i'm just
22:39 - putting that out into the universe if
22:40 - anyone wants to invite me to anything um
22:43 - and i really want to go on the trains in
22:45 - japan i've never been to japan
22:47 - um
22:49 - got some wonderful trains in europe that
22:50 - i've been on mwah oh i love that taiji
22:53 - uh is that still like
22:56 - is that a a relevant uh uh a timely
22:59 - reference or it's like not anything
23:01 - anybody rides or says anymore okay be
23:03 - time traveling what is the keyboard
23:05 - shortcut for commenting out multiple
23:07 - lines at once
23:09 - uh command slash i believe
23:11 - uh all right so where are we on my list
23:13 - the survey so the survey will be coming
23:14 - out be on the lookout for that please
23:16 - fill it up i'm trying to think of what a
23:17 - good incentive will be i mean the only
23:19 - thing that we came up with so far as
23:21 - like uh uh we'll pick some random people
23:23 - filled out the survey to send them
23:24 - coding train stickers but if there's
23:26 - something you would like um you know a
23:28 - shout out a little video hello i don't
23:29 - know i'm happy to do any of those things
23:32 - i'm getting a text message here
23:35 - i don't know what that is
23:37 - um
23:38 - okay
23:39 - um
23:40 - all right so
23:42 - hmm
23:43 - looking at my list and i'm looking at
23:44 - the time
23:47 - um
23:49 - brandon asks do you want to derive pi or
23:52 - just do something fun with pi so
23:55 - yes to i want to do something fun with
23:58 - pi now deriving pi could be doing
24:00 - something fun with pi
24:02 - so it just it uh um
24:05 - it's important to me all right so it's
24:07 - not a pi day video if it doesn't sort of
24:09 - center around
24:10 - the number pi in some way um and i did
24:14 - do some i've done videos on estimating
24:16 - the value of pi through random chance
24:18 - and various kinds of things i've done
24:21 - like the leibniz
24:24 - sequence and some other like formula so
24:26 - you can look back and find some of the
24:28 - ones that i've done
24:30 - but something that has a good visual to
24:32 - it i think is always
24:33 - a nice pretty pattern
24:36 - uh certainly better than the rer is it
24:38 - is this train chat is this like i need
24:40 - like a sound drop for like hey everybody
24:42 - it's train chat time where we just talk
24:44 - about our favorite trains around the
24:45 - world huh oh i have this dream
24:48 - this other dream so i'm gonna uh just
24:50 - i'm putting this out there i don't maybe
24:52 - i shouldn't talk about the stuff on
24:53 - there i i want to go on a train i think
24:56 - they have these like um
24:58 - i'm basically just i am uh i'm basically
25:00 - just an old person who wants to go on
25:02 - like luxury train rides with they don't
25:04 - have to be luxury i just want them to
25:05 - have beautiful views and landscapes and
25:07 - i think they have some uh
25:10 - beautiful like kind of like
25:12 - tourist train rides i want the
25:13 - equivalent of a cruise that's on a boat
25:16 - but on a train
25:17 - and cruises aren't for me i don't think
25:19 - um i mean i like boats i like water what
25:22 - what am i even talking about right now
25:25 - scotland i hear this is a this is
25:27 - another a little fantasy of mine to go
25:28 - on a
25:29 - beautiful train ride through i don't
25:31 - know the scottish highlands or something
25:33 - is that a thing somebody will tell me
25:35 - um all right so one thing that i want to
25:37 - do is talk about community
25:40 - contributions so first of all
25:42 - i need
25:45 - corey says by the way this is a very
25:46 - relatable comment corey says this is oh
25:49 - i have a space heater under me which is
25:51 - not on but i keep kicking it um
25:53 - lol this is so strange i'm used to
25:56 - watching you at 2x speed yes apologies
25:59 - this probably
26:01 - sounds like i'm speaking like this to
26:06 - you my children's favorite pastime
26:08 - although we haven't done this in quite a
26:09 - while is to take my videos and put them
26:11 - on like 0.25 or 0.5 x because they think
26:14 - i sound
26:16 - ridiculous
26:18 - so um hogwarts train in scotland oh boy
26:22 - my my uh little harry potter fan
26:26 - uh super fans would uh in my household
26:28 - would love that uh train from spain to
26:31 - turkey
26:32 - i took a beautiful train in norway it
26:35 - was from oslo to addison i believe
26:39 - i think that was the route it was
26:41 - absolutely incredible
26:43 - um
26:45 - okay
26:47 - um have a little sip of my a coffee
26:49 - drink
26:54 - train to the highlands is my travel
26:56 - dream says chris sears i want to go to
26:58 - lockdesk so i actually have been to loch
27:00 - ness
27:01 - uh um
27:02 - i was in scotland once and uh it was
27:05 - that was
27:06 - that was an amazing trip
27:07 - there were no trains involved in that
27:09 - trip
27:10 - train from this is awesome these like
27:12 - uh
27:14 - these train recommendations i mean if i
27:16 - could go on like a world tour this is
27:18 - okay if i could just go on like a world
27:19 - tour
27:20 - of trains and like do coding videos
27:22 - while i'm on the train i mean ah that's
27:24 - what i should have been doing on
27:25 - sabbatical
27:27 - i have children who need to be driven to
27:28 - school and they need breakfast made for
27:30 - them so i can't just go travel the world
27:32 - on trains for the whole year i mean
27:35 - maybe one maybe you want to maybe this
27:37 - is more of a like a retirement or when
27:39 - they when they're off on their own if
27:41 - they ever move out and escape the nest
27:44 - then i could do that
27:47 - if you came to india check out our local
27:49 - trains in mumbai i would love to visit
27:51 - india uh there's a train that goes all
27:53 - the way across canada welcome to
27:56 - i really need okay hold on i think i got
27:58 - it
28:00 - uh where is it hold on just give me a
28:02 - minute here i'm looking at my sound
28:03 - board
28:04 - uh
28:06 - no
28:11 - no scary music that's not the train
28:13 - sound effect
28:15 - i had a whole like i guess i never when
28:18 - i redid the studio i never brought the
28:21 - my train sound effects here
28:24 - laughing
28:32 - no all right sorry i was gonna uh
28:37 - i was gonna i don't know what i was
28:38 - gonna do but it was gonna be great
28:41 - all right uh all right on to my next
28:43 - item on my list why did my computer go
28:45 - to sleep
28:47 - am i not plugged in no i am plugged in
28:50 - um okay so let's go to
28:53 - the coding train youtube page
28:55 - which i redid a little bit by the way so
28:58 - i guess i'm live streaming right now
28:59 - whoa there's a lot of people watching
29:01 - maybe i should stick to streaming on
29:03 - youtube don't have these numbers on
29:04 - twitch
29:06 - uh
29:07 - um
29:08 - so i i was kind of redoing this home
29:09 - page here to try to make it a little bit
29:11 - like you know start learning here and
29:13 - here are the coding challenges some of
29:15 - the other playlists that i recommend my
29:16 - popular videos why was i going here
29:19 - uploads yes
29:21 - so i want to go to this video
29:24 - and um i want to uh click over here so
29:28 - in every video
29:30 - you will see a link that goes to
29:31 - thecodingtrain.com now i'm a little bit
29:33 - delayed
29:34 - the reason why i'm bringing this up and
29:36 - it's a little bit unfortunate because i
29:37 - would love to be showing you the new
29:39 - website
29:40 - but i'm going to click over to the
29:42 - current existing website the new website
29:43 - will have the same content but as
29:45 - different design and we'll be featuring
29:47 - your work
29:49 - more
29:50 - and we'll even have a probably a
29:52 - different uh a way that you can submit
29:55 - without having to do a github pull
29:56 - request although you could still do that
29:58 - um so this is the coding challenge and
30:00 - if i go here
30:01 - this is here where is it like
30:03 - i'm going to cry
30:06 - uh
30:07 - um
30:08 - sound
30:10 - let's
30:16 - it seems like
30:18 - there haven't been made yet
30:20 - any variations
30:23 - based on this coding challenge by the
30:24 - community yet now first of all that's a
30:26 - very awkward sentence
30:28 - so i will be re-writing all the language
30:30 - on the new website but i'm shocked
30:33 - i'm shocked and dare i say appalled no
30:36 - i'm not appalled that
30:38 - this video which is one of my more
30:39 - popular ones which i think is ripe for
30:42 - you to remix and make your own version
30:45 - of
30:46 - um
30:46 - doesn't have any yet now
30:48 - in fairness this came out a week ago i
30:50 - haven't really been pushing the
30:51 - community contribution thing one thing i
30:53 - would love to hear suggestions for
30:56 - is um
30:58 - how
30:59 - what should i call these
31:01 - so
31:02 - community contributions i don't really
31:03 - like i mean that's what they are
31:04 - literally and i could either that could
31:05 - be a
31:06 - a way that we refer to them but i've got
31:07 - my little notebook here
31:10 - so if you have a good idea
31:12 - like to hear it now
31:13 - by the way i think i'm going to stick
31:14 - with the coding challenges i was going
31:16 - to try to rename them coding journeys
31:18 - everybody suggested coding adventures
31:19 - and i don't know if you're trolling me
31:20 - or not but that's sebastian lags thing
31:23 - and they're amazing i'm not calling by
31:24 - things coding coding journeys is
31:26 - probably a little bit too close to that
31:27 - frankly people had some great ideas like
31:30 - choo choo
31:34 - i don't remember what that one was but
31:35 - um community contributions could they be
31:37 - like uh passenger
31:39 - manifest
31:41 - i don't think that really works i don't
31:42 - know so give me your ideas but please
31:44 - submit them and since we don't have any
31:47 - to feature today i would like to do more
31:49 - of i'm going to be featuring them on the
31:50 - website more prominently so get yours in
31:53 - uh and they'll be on the new website but
31:56 - um
31:56 - what i would like to do
31:59 - is
32:00 - go ahead and look at the comments so i
32:02 - like to um i want to take a little time
32:04 - let's allow nice me
32:06 - whoops it's 10 30. let's try to take
32:09 - something with the word conductor train
32:12 - um uh something about trains
32:16 - contributions contributions
32:19 - is not about so um
32:22 - uh so
32:23 - by the way what is going on with my
32:25 - recommendations today interesting um
32:29 - so
32:30 - oh this is new
32:32 - i have not seen this that's kind of cool
32:34 - now they're supposed to be like little
32:35 - thumbnails there about what's going on i
32:37 - like this
32:38 - little chapters that's cool
32:41 - um so let's take a look at your comments
32:43 - which are mostly about like keeping it
32:45 - coding challenge but there was some oh
32:49 - oh
32:50 - just want to zoom in here a little bit
32:53 - there we go ah
32:54 - i guess i have to go down yeah there we
32:56 - go um
32:57 - let's take a look at um see if there's i
33:00 - know there were some interesting
33:00 - technical questions and things that were
33:02 - pointed out that i can discuss
33:05 - um
33:07 - all i can hear is the hot hot hot
33:09 - chocolate song for polar express i have
33:11 - no idea what that is does it go like
33:12 - this
33:13 - hot
33:14 - hot hot hot chocolate on the train
33:21 - you know back in the day people would
33:23 - make all these remix musical remixes of
33:25 - me doing weird stuff in videos it just
33:27 - doesn't happen anymore
33:29 - did all the
33:30 - talent musically talented viewers go off
33:33 - and
33:34 - become sensations they don't have time
33:37 - anymore
33:45 - all right um
33:46 - all right messed around with the some of
33:48 - the ascii shading characters and found
33:49 - that this combo works great ooh let's
33:53 - try this
33:55 - um so let's go back to uh you know one
33:58 - thing you should know that when you if
33:59 - you're looking for the code and this
34:01 - will be different on the new website but
34:02 - the same stuff will be there if you're
34:04 - looking for the code for any particular
34:06 - video if you find the corresponding page
34:08 - on the website
34:10 - you will see the different
34:12 - ways to view the code here so if i look
34:15 - at i want to look at just the ascii
34:16 - video one
34:19 - so in case you missed this video
34:21 - um you can see what it is
34:24 - and
34:24 - uh
34:27 - i do need to give so it is uh here here
34:29 - we go i am making a sort of like ascii
34:32 - render of myself but i have this
34:35 - variable
34:38 - oh god that is so windy outside so let's
34:40 - try this suggestion
34:45 - and see what we get
34:48 - oh that's cool
34:50 - wow that is wild i love this
34:54 - um
34:56 - yeah not much more to say about but
34:57 - thank you for this excellent suggestion
35:00 - um i mean it's much more like a
35:01 - pixelated version of the image i'm like
35:04 - kind of looking in close
35:07 - but that is really i love that thank you
35:09 - for this
35:10 - um and i'm gonna leave that as a comment
35:13 - i'm gonna go back to where i left the
35:15 - video with this particular um set of
35:17 - characters
35:19 - um
35:20 - let me go back and sort of see the um
35:23 - people are uh edge recognition yeah this
35:25 - would be interesting so one thing that i
35:26 - didn't do with this video that i would
35:28 - love to see
35:29 - if anybody
35:31 - um passenger proposition um
35:34 - one thing that um
35:38 - i didn't what didn't do
35:41 - is if you look at ascii art that people
35:43 - are making very carefully
35:45 - with sort of like hand selection or sort
35:47 - of manual curation of the characters the
35:49 - characters often really have meaning in
35:50 - terms of the contour of the thing that's
35:52 - being drawn
35:53 - um
35:54 - like if i just search like ascii
35:56 - cat
35:58 - i'm sure
35:59 - you know we would see
36:01 - things like this so this is not at all
36:04 - what i did this would be a fascinating
36:06 - thing to try to do i wonder if there is
36:07 - like a machine learning approach to this
36:10 - where we could train a model to have
36:13 - sort of photographic images and their
36:15 - ascii counterpoints counterparts
36:17 - that would be
36:18 - let me write that down
36:21 - ascii
36:23 - art
36:24 - ml model projects that i will never get
36:26 - to goes on the list here um
36:29 - so i didn't do that but i would love to
36:31 - see if anybody has an idea on to how to
36:34 - do that um
36:38 - thank you chris for this very nice
36:40 - feedback um coding challenge coding
36:42 - challenge
36:43 - right so this was pointed out i was very
36:46 - focused on
36:47 - figuring out how to when i'm making this
36:49 - sort of html dom version of the ascii
36:52 - characters how to deal with non-breaking
36:54 - spaces and i could have just used white
36:56 - space pre as a css property
37:01 - 3d objects ascii style that would be
37:03 - awesome see you could do this you're
37:05 - this is what i want i want all of you to
37:07 - make the things you're suggesting
37:09 - um code stations i like that
37:13 - um
37:14 - okay people are really mostly talking
37:16 - about the name which i really appreciate
37:19 - but part of me wonders if this video is
37:20 - just popular because at the beginning of
37:22 - it i said let me know what you think i
37:24 - should call this series and i'm like
37:25 - flooded with comments about that so like
37:27 - the youtube
37:28 - uh thing the you know the the the uh
37:32 - the wizard behind the curtain at youtube
37:33 - is like oh lots of comments on this
37:35 - video keep suggesting it so i just need
37:36 - to at the beginning of our video be like
37:38 - what do you think of my hair today
37:39 - please let me know in the comments
37:42 - uh locomotive language learning caboose
37:45 - coding coding caboose i like um
37:48 - hey where's the rest of the comments why
37:50 - did it just stop
37:51 - it says 414 530 i wanted there were some
37:54 - really good ones with questions
37:56 - that i wanted to look at i really really
37:58 - should get it together am i already at
38:00 - my 10 minutes to um
38:03 - let me just see
38:05 - uh if i refresh this page if i can
38:07 - if i can scroll down faster
38:09 - yeah okay um yeah they just weren't now
38:12 - they're now they're loading um i can
38:14 - just zoom in
38:16 - there are some interesting questions
38:17 - that i want to take a look at
38:19 - [Music]
38:20 - um
38:22 - ah
38:23 - fresh noob hi freshnoob asked could i
38:25 - get some hints for how to have
38:28 - custom running text which forms an image
38:30 - referring to 1057 when you mention
38:32 - writing some poetry yeah so one thing
38:34 - you should realize that i'm doing and
38:35 - this is what chris manning made a nice
38:37 - uh friendly comment about is when i show
38:41 - a additional uh uh thank you
38:45 - yeah so jake i agree like that worked
38:47 - hard on that uh thumbnail oh i didn't
38:49 - work hard and that somehow i i worked
38:51 - hard on trying to ask around get a lot
38:53 - of advice and get help with the
38:54 - thumbnail um
38:57 - so
38:59 - um
39:01 - apprecia yeah um i'm sorry i lost
39:05 - sort by newest okay yeah there's too
39:06 - much stuff going on
39:08 - i had a thought that i wanted to talk
39:09 - about when
39:10 - ever
39:12 - i show an additional demonstration in
39:14 - the video even if i haven't coded it you
39:16 - can find
39:18 - that example here also included on the
39:21 - webpage so for clues about how to do
39:24 - that
39:25 - i can show you this one which is
39:27 - actually
39:28 - um since this is a sort of an ascii
39:31 - version of my dog gloria i know this is
39:34 - i don't know if this is easier for you
39:35 - to see it's very it's bright in here i
39:38 - just need to turn my monitor brightness
39:39 - up i don't think that changes anything
39:40 - for what you're seeing um i think this
39:42 - is like
39:43 - from um
39:46 - ah why am i blanking on the name
39:48 - of
39:49 - the book by jack london with the wolf in
39:52 - it
39:55 - did i forget to eat breakfast again
39:56 - today this is what happens when i don't
39:57 - eat breakfast like things that i know
39:59 - about and that i've read
40:01 - in my life but anyway i just pulled
40:03 - something from public domain project
40:04 - gutenberg um so this is not using the
40:07 - specific characters to generate a
40:10 - brightness in fact there's lots of extra
40:12 - spaces in here that make it uh
40:15 - that add additional noise but i'm just
40:17 - coloring the characters but you can see
40:18 - i'm walking through them so the idea
40:21 - here is that if i were to go to here you
40:24 - can see um
40:25 - [Music]
40:28 - you can see the text from the book and
40:31 - then in the code itself i'm loading the
40:34 - full text i called it gloria.txt call of
40:36 - the wild thank you
40:38 - [Music]
40:40 - and then uh i am just
40:43 - getting a character from that text but
40:45 - also cycling through them so there's
40:47 - this appearance of motion so if you were
40:49 - curious about that
40:52 - okay
40:53 - so uh thank you for that question i
40:55 - think i'm at 10 40. let me just
40:58 - scroll through and see if i can get one
41:00 - more
41:01 - um
41:01 - [Music]
41:05 - um
41:07 - question that i thought so i really
41:08 - should go through these in advance and
41:09 - prepare which ones i want to talk about
41:12 - um oh yeah this is the one this is
41:14 - actually a really important one
41:17 - i should answer this right now but um
41:19 - maybe somebody can reply so the density
41:21 - array seems wrong there are bright
41:23 - characters at one end and dark
41:24 - characters are the other but in the
41:25 - middle it's just all the numbers in
41:26 - numerical order which i highly doubt is
41:29 - also the order of density so let's
41:31 - address this
41:32 - really good point and i wish i had sort
41:34 - of thought to mention this or look at
41:36 - this in more detail in the video
41:39 - so this one the current one that i'm
41:40 - using
41:41 - by my eye and i didn't do a proper
41:43 - calculation here these characters are
41:46 - actually ordered from darkest and
41:47 - there's many many many many many blank
41:49 - spaces for sort of like thresholding any
41:51 - brightness below a certain value and
41:53 - then brighter brighter brighter more and
41:54 - more like characters now this one
41:58 - if i switch back to this one and
42:00 - unfortunately this is in the wrong order
42:01 - now also
42:03 - so it is uh this is inverted but you get
42:06 - the idea
42:08 - um it is very true
42:11 - that this
42:12 - albeit
42:13 - um you know these characters over on
42:16 - this side you can see are have fewer and
42:18 - fewer
42:20 - pixels if you will
42:22 - ramping up to
42:24 - full of pixels over here the numbers are
42:26 - just arbitrarily in order and at a
42:28 - glance probably seven is a
42:32 - darker
42:34 - represents a darker pixel versus like
42:36 - zero
42:37 - so um i didn't think about this i just
42:40 - kind of tossed this in there
42:42 - and it comes from
42:44 - the uh ascii playground
42:48 - uh which is from um
42:51 - andreas
42:53 - gishens and i apologies for
42:55 - maybe um mispronouncing the name i made
42:58 - several mistakes one is when i was
42:59 - looking at this quickly i just assumed
43:01 - that's a shader you know i just throw
43:04 - export function main out of the corner
43:05 - of my eye and i was like that's shader
43:07 - code oh thank you herobrine very kind of
43:10 - you
43:11 - um
43:12 - exploring tracks that's interesting um
43:16 - so this is not this is just plain
43:18 - javascript it's just what i'm doing um
43:20 - and we're pulling characters from this
43:22 - density array and so i assume that um
43:24 - andreas who goes by erta
43:28 - which i now know is the order of keys on
43:30 - the keyboard e r t d f g c v b
43:35 - um
43:36 - is just using that character because it
43:38 - creates nice patterns and there's
43:40 - something quite lovely about seeing the
43:42 - numbers i think in order i'm sorry that
43:44 - this is might be very like flickery to
43:46 - you
43:46 - um so i just kind of lifted this as a
43:49 - nice starting set of characters but i
43:51 - think the decision is made not just
43:53 - purely out of brightness for these sort
43:54 - of more abstract ascii visualizations um
43:58 - this is more
44:00 - and i and i probably if i'm really
44:02 - trying to authentically match the image
44:04 - i would want to be
44:06 - more
44:07 - um precise about the which characters i
44:09 - choose and in what order and i have seen
44:12 - i believe in the processing
44:15 - um
44:16 - ascii video let's see if
44:20 - uh
44:21 - well here's the get i don't know if
44:22 - there's a better place for me to find
44:24 - this example
44:25 - but this is a um
44:28 - this is an example from the processing
44:31 - um
44:32 - ide
44:33 - and you can see this is like
44:35 - uh a ton of more characters
44:38 - and probably i'm assuming
44:40 - yeah sorted according to their visual
44:42 - density so i don't know
44:44 - ben fry made this
44:46 - ring the bell for ben frye um i'm
44:48 - assuming that ben did some like
44:50 - you know phd level like hyper
44:53 - sophisticated analysis
44:55 - of these letter forms um and i could
44:57 - copy paste that into my code you could
44:59 - take a look at this one lots of stuff to
45:01 - explore all right so that's so let me
45:03 - just give you a little pitch here to
45:05 - encourage you
45:07 - uh on the one hand i'm encouraging you
45:09 - to make your own
45:10 - to watch this video if you haven't let
45:12 - me know what you think do you appreciate
45:15 - all the extra
45:17 - bells and whistles
45:21 - bells and whistles
45:25 - or would you rather me just make more
45:26 - videos without any editing blah blah
45:28 - blah
45:30 - and oh the ascii fluid simulation that
45:32 - josh davis in the chat is mentioning is
45:35 - chef's kiss i have seen that
45:37 - um
45:37 - [Music]
45:39 - so uh make your own version uh watch the
45:42 - video make your own version but even
45:43 - better uh the video that's coming out
45:45 - tomorrow the prime spiral video
45:48 - it will definitely be out by monday
45:50 - hopefully tomorrow youtube members
45:53 - twitch subscribers github sponsors
45:56 - patrons of all these different ways you
45:58 - can sign up for the sort of supporter
46:01 - community um i do share
46:04 - earlier versions of the videos you're
46:06 - not missing anything if you're
46:08 - don't worry the video comes out you see
46:09 - it a day later but i will hopefully be
46:11 - sharing that with you all of you a
46:12 - little bit early at least for like
46:14 - feedback
46:15 - um and mark boots is writing it depends
46:18 - on the font family too i guess and
46:20 - that's absolutely true
46:21 - so please watch that prime spiral video
46:24 - comment on it let me know what you think
46:26 - about it
46:27 - and make your own version of it and
46:30 - share it with me
46:32 - on the website social media also also
46:33 - works well
46:35 - tag the coding train on twitter or
46:37 - the.coding.train on instagram
46:40 - all that jazz okay
46:43 - going back to my list
46:46 - ah so i mentioned the prime spiral let
46:48 - me
46:49 - let me just show you give you a little
46:52 - sneak peek here
46:55 - of just the code itself
46:58 - um
47:00 - let me open up
47:01 - the
47:03 - i think just this one
47:07 - everybody which wish chris a happy
47:09 - birthday was chris's 50th birthday not
47:11 - chris manning in the chat no idea what
47:13 - chris manning's age is a friend of mine
47:15 - named chris
47:17 - i'm sure he'll appreciate i made a
47:18 - little p5 sketch here i'll show it to
47:20 - you
47:23 - uh uh uh since it popped up i think
47:25 - people are gonna ask uh
47:27 - here we go
47:30 - everybody wish chris the happiest
47:31 - birthday
47:32 - it was a while ago now but
47:35 - uh okay i don't think chris is watching
47:38 - the chris associated with this video
47:40 - okay let me go back to the spiral so
47:41 - this is the ulam spiral or the prime
47:43 - spiral um what is happening is i am
47:46 - counting numbers
47:47 - from one to the theoretically infinity
47:50 - obviously i have only a certain amount
47:51 - of space on the screen and when it is a
47:54 - prime number i am marking it with a dot
47:56 - uh this was um this idea comes from the
47:59 - mathematician stanislav ulam i talk
48:01 - about a little bit about the history of
48:03 - this in the video
48:05 - program this i have a lot of trouble
48:08 - getting the spiral to work correctly so
48:10 - the video that comes out tomorrow will
48:12 - show you how to do this program
48:14 - showcase station
48:16 - all right
48:20 - this i'm really liking showcase
48:22 - station
48:26 - where am i going to write this
48:28 - showcase
48:33 - station
48:38 - all right that so far
48:41 - is the winner
48:43 - i like everyone's saying
48:45 - um so i until i hear something better uh
48:48 - forevermore corey james cooper when i
48:51 - say like i forgot who suggested this it
48:54 - was you you could refer back to this
48:56 - clip clip it if this was a twitch stream
48:58 - you could clip it thank you i mean we
48:59 - might not call it that there's a lot of
49:01 - people gonna weigh in other ideas no
49:03 - promises but that's right now the
49:06 - winning suggestion as far as i'm
49:07 - concerned all right um so now you've
49:10 - seen the prime spiral i do have some
49:11 - additional examples that i need to make
49:14 - still for the video i will probably just
49:16 - do those on my own later today in my
49:19 - copious amounts of free time
49:22 - but i sort of had hoped to maybe do
49:24 - those today but
49:27 - i don't think that i can
49:29 - so i we're about to
49:32 - get to uh okay
49:34 - so let me get to my next topic then i'm
49:36 - going to take a short break
49:37 - and then i'll have the last hour
49:40 - hopefully for
49:42 - going through and talking about the end
49:44 - body simulation
49:46 - spinning the wheel for the next topic
49:50 - and um
49:53 - pi day i was about to like um and oh a
49:55 - pie no pi day isn't a thing i just you
49:57 - can clip on youtube also
50:00 - how did you do the hearts on the
50:01 - birthday sketch asks kathy mcginnis
50:04 - so the hearts are
50:10 - if you look for my a fireworks coding
50:12 - challenge which is quite an uh a one
50:14 - from quite a while ago from july
50:17 - 2nd uh 2016. let's see if we go here
50:20 - and i think actually uh
50:24 - oh no i i really don't think that i took
50:27 - this from this let's take a look
50:30 - i think i did this also in in parallel
50:33 - but let's take a look
50:38 - yeah this looks different good okay so
50:40 - i'm glad to see that this looks
50:42 - sufficiently different that i clearly
50:43 - did the same it's a different slightly
50:45 - different heart-shaped
50:46 - uh that i clearly didn't just cop-lift
50:49 - this code um but um i remember that
50:52 - david snyder made a version i don't see
50:55 - it here look at this
50:57 - all right can we all just celebrate for
50:59 - a moment i don't know when this was
51:00 - submitted and maybe caitlyn is
51:02 - you know 15 or 16 now
51:05 - caitlyn using her dad's github account
51:07 - which is good because i don't believe
51:08 - you can have your own account until
51:10 - you're at least 13. um and totally uh
51:13 - it's three cheers for both caitlyn and
51:16 - her dad uh let's take a look at these
51:17 - rainbow fireworks
51:21 - oh look at that
51:23 - oh and they go kind of like off to the
51:25 - side which is way where my fireworks
51:28 - just went
51:29 - right up in the air like they're all
51:31 - going to the right though is it a random
51:33 - trajectory is it always the same oh no
51:35 - it's definitely a random that looks
51:36 - different these are beautiful great job
51:38 - caitlin i hope you're still watching in
51:40 - coding train and coding or maybe if you
51:41 - moved on to something else that's great
51:42 - too that's great nobody needs to
51:45 - spend their life like me
51:47 - just making p5 sketch after p5 sketch
51:49 - after p5 sketch
51:51 - it's okay you can do other things
51:56 - ah all right so the way i did this if i
51:59 - go to the web editor version of the
52:02 - sketch
52:03 - i think i did
52:04 - i think the coding challenge i might
52:05 - have done it
52:07 - here under
52:08 - firework.js
52:10 - let me look
52:13 - um
52:16 - just trying to look for where i create
52:18 - all the particles
52:20 - new particle
52:23 - if this dot exploded
52:26 - where do i make ah here we go so i make
52:28 - new particles there we go
52:30 - i make new particles this is it
52:33 - and the particles right here
52:35 - get a random velocity
52:39 - um let me run this sketch for you and
52:41 - show you uh how this works
52:43 - so this is my origin we could actually
52:45 - this is my original sketch
52:47 - so these just look like
52:49 - um
52:49 - [Music]
52:50 - things exploding randomly
52:53 - and there's no pattern here but if i
52:56 - were to take
52:57 - this
52:58 - off
53:00 - and i were to say this dot velocity dot
53:02 - multiply
53:05 - 5
53:07 - wind
53:08 - you're going to see something different
53:10 - see how they form a perfect circle
53:13 - so the initial velocities of each one of
53:16 - these
53:17 - um
53:18 - fire each one of these particles
53:21 - uh
53:23 - determine like where it kind of like
53:26 - ends up in its trajectory before it
53:27 - begins to fall and fade out
53:29 - so
53:30 - a random vector is any vector along
53:34 - the perimeter of a circle
53:36 - but there's no reason why and i could
53:38 - use the whiteboard
53:40 - let's see if this let me come over here
53:43 - so what's happening
53:45 - is
53:47 - i have
53:49 - a whole bunch of particles that all
53:50 - start from the same point
53:52 - and they pick a random velocity
53:55 - if that random velocity is any direction
53:57 - but the same magnitude
53:59 - those vectors all point out
54:02 - to the perimeter the circumference of a
54:04 - circle
54:05 - so if i just knew
54:07 - a whole lot of vectors for some shape
54:11 - like a heart
54:13 - and then i could pick every firework
54:17 - gets one of these random vectors
54:21 - it's going to explode out into that form
54:23 - and you we could use letter forms
54:26 - um there's so many things we could do
54:28 - beyond just hearts and i i a bunch of
54:30 - people made creative versions of this i
54:33 - remember seeing them i don't know why
54:34 - they're not all on the website maybe the
54:35 - links went dead and we removed them or
54:37 - they weren't shared on the website
54:38 - because this was you know five or six
54:41 - years ago at some point where i did this
54:42 - but there's a lot of fun things and i'd
54:44 - be glad to go through this in more
54:46 - detail at some time but i should get
54:47 - back to my uh list of things all right
54:52 - now uh one thing that i think that i
54:54 - might need to do here i worked very hard
54:56 - on the lighting for this whiteboard and
54:58 - i just realized that i might not have
55:00 - actually focused the camera yeah that's
55:02 - better so good thing i discovered that
55:04 - now
55:08 - and i can come back over here
55:10 - um
55:14 - [Music]
55:16 - okay
55:17 - yeah and sit back is saying
55:19 - is is correctly saying like this this
55:21 - code like if i go into my the happy
55:24 - birthday thing let's just find it
55:29 - um if i look at
55:32 - the particles
55:34 - this is
55:35 - the math
55:37 - for a heart pattern it's like this
55:41 - uh
55:42 - trigonometric uh equation and actually
55:47 - heart
55:49 - curve i think i'd uh
55:50 - [Music]
55:52 - p5
55:54 - look at this february 18 2019
55:58 - the heart curve so if you want to learn
56:00 - about the equation to draw a heart
56:03 - there you go i've got another video for
56:04 - you i've got one for everything
56:07 - except not really but if i live to be a
56:10 - hundred i will get them all eventually
56:16 - all right um
56:20 - uh okay let's see so moving on
56:25 - let me give you an update on the nature
56:27 - of code so
56:29 - slow going so far i'm working with two
56:31 - wonderful nyu students who are helping
56:34 - me with the nature of code project um
56:36 - and
56:38 - i just want to give you an update on
56:39 - that
56:41 - because i know it's of great interest
56:43 - yeah
56:44 - so if you want it
56:47 - okay this is not it igor
56:51 - give me back my url it's not mine it's
56:53 - yours
56:54 - you registered it i don't own it
56:57 - i'm happy you have it
56:58 - nature dash of dash code
57:01 - okay so this is um
57:04 - the collection of repos for the nature
57:06 - of code project
57:07 - um
57:08 - and
57:10 - um
57:15 - the chat is wonderful i wish i could
57:17 - just like read every comment aloud and
57:19 - and reply to them but but know that i'm
57:21 - seeing all your wonderful um comments
57:24 - now um
57:26 - or actually i'm probably not seeing all
57:28 - of your wonderful comments i just saw
57:29 - kathy and abhijits they're great i'll
57:31 - read them i used your heart code to make
57:33 - a valentine's day sketch for my husband
57:35 - i love that and abhijit writes it must
57:37 - feel good when you search something
57:38 - general and google shows your own videos
57:40 - it's a little bit eerie actually the
57:41 - weirdest thing that happens this is this
57:43 - happens to me a lot is like i'm trying
57:45 - to figure out how to do something that i
57:47 - don't know how to do i search
57:50 - and i find like
57:51 - my explanation or my vid like my results
57:54 - are coming up to try to help me but i'm
57:55 - like no those don't help me i made those
57:58 - they don't that's what i'm looking for
58:00 - or weirdly enough they actually do and i
58:01 - just forgot how to do it completely
58:03 - another thing that welcome to my life
58:05 - i'm sure you all needed to know that
58:06 - little tidbit um so i'm actively working
58:08 - on this project one thing i'm just going
58:10 - to just uh um
58:13 - show just really quickly mention is i'm
58:15 - working on a new method to have a draft
58:18 - of the book in notion to make writing a
58:21 - little bit easier this has actually been
58:22 - pioneered by um
58:25 - folks at itp and other books that people
58:27 - are working on it's not my idea
58:29 - and then the the notion project
58:32 - automatically comes back into github as
58:35 - markdown so there's still be an open
58:37 - source like markdown version of the book
58:38 - but when i'm trying to like write
58:40 - something new i don't have to like edit
58:41 - the markdown which could be kind of
58:42 - awkward actually the current book is
58:44 - even worse than that
58:46 - um in the sense that if i go to the
58:48 - content and look at any given chapter
58:51 - it's actually just raw html so right now
58:53 - if i want to like rewrite the book or
58:55 - edit it i've got to be editing this html
58:58 - which is really painful and the thing
58:59 - that i here's my new mantra
59:02 - i have been saying i want to make a
59:03 - second edition of the nature of code for
59:05 - at least five years the book came out in
59:07 - december 2012. i started working on it
59:09 - probably in 2008 which is just insane to
59:11 - me
59:12 - um and it's just never getting done so
59:15 - like
59:16 - uh yes
59:17 - i wanted to have this html system so i
59:19 - could perfectly refine and markup and
59:21 - format everything i ever wanted in this
59:23 - book
59:24 - but
59:28 - printer printer making noise
59:29 - everything's fine
59:32 - but if i'm not getting to rewrite the
59:34 - new version because it's too like much
59:36 - effort and complicated and i've got to
59:38 - like i just need a simpler workflow and
59:40 - i just need to make it happen if this
59:42 - you heard it here well not first because
59:44 - i've been saying this now for the last
59:45 - couple weeks but you heard it here
59:48 - if this nature of code second edition is
59:50 - not out by the 10 year anniversary of
59:52 - the first edition
59:53 - i'm never doing it i'm not doing it it's
59:56 - never going to happen
59:57 - so whatever happens i got to get it done
59:59 - this year i do need time to invest in
60:01 - that so i will apologize if the youtube
60:04 - channel or the twitch streams go dark
60:06 - for a little bit
60:07 - uh at present they don't need to do that
60:09 - and it's still way higher on my priority
60:11 - list which i think is kind of the
60:12 - problem to be frank um although my name
60:15 - is dan
60:16 - um
60:18 - yeah so
60:19 - [Music]
60:21 - um
60:22 - and but i would love i people are so
60:24 - interested in helping
60:26 - and i just don't know how to
60:29 - harness that interest and excitement
60:31 - enthusiasm so right now i don't have any
60:32 - calls for help um with the nature of
60:35 - code book but your your support and your
60:38 - enthusiasm goes a long way
60:42 - all right okay it is 11 o'clock
60:45 - i managed
60:47 - to do
60:50 - what
60:51 - i
60:53 - i i said i was not going to keep doing
60:56 - which but i had a list that i went
60:57 - through and these were important pieces
60:58 - of information and announcements and
61:00 - you're all
61:02 - you're all still here most of you
61:04 - some of you
61:06 - hi
61:07 - thank you
61:08 - so i need to take a short break to get
61:10 - some water and before i take my break i
61:13 - would like to tell you
61:16 - once again
61:18 - about
61:22 - it's the olympics so this is my today's
61:24 - sponsor
61:25 - [Music]
61:28 - brilliant
61:31 - by the way it's not even a script
61:33 - i like just do this off the cuff but i
61:36 - like to make it sound like a script do
61:38 - you like learning i like learning you
61:40 - like learning too wait are you watching
61:42 - the coding train do you like programming
61:44 - and computer science and math and
61:46 - algorithms and interactivity and visuals
61:48 - and all that stuff oh so do i
61:51 - if you like all that stuff uh you are
61:53 - going to love brilliant um i'm i'm being
61:56 - kind of silly right now but it is really
61:58 - a wonderful uh website and platform to
62:01 - for to continue learning journey uh
62:04 - again like i said this at the top of the
62:06 - stream um videos i hope you enjoy my
62:08 - videos i hope they help you learn and
62:10 - and bring some joy to your day and
62:12 - inspire you um but i do think that
62:14 - watching videos and reading books
62:18 - and by wait we should put reading books
62:19 - probably at the top of the list there
62:20 - before the videos are wonderful things
62:22 - um being able to actually try stuff
62:25 - yourself for me has always been the way
62:27 - uh the path towards understanding and
62:29 - exploration for me and brilliant uh
62:32 - really just has an amazing set of
62:34 - courses and tools and resources with
62:36 - interactive lessons and quizzes and a
62:38 - whole community of people doing this
62:39 - stuff so i'm going to just show you very
62:41 - quickly two of my favorite um courses
62:44 - from brilliant one is the um
62:49 - uh
62:50 - algorithm fundamentals sorry and you can
62:52 - see that like this is basically a
62:54 - wonderful complement and companion to
62:55 - learning to code this is an interactive
62:58 - lesson about doing an insertion sort
63:00 - algorithm
63:01 - and
63:02 - you can move all the pieces around it's
63:04 - pseudo code so you don't need to know a
63:05 - particular programming language but the
63:08 - the the site is just full of these kinds
63:10 - of interactive exercises and lessons
63:13 - that allow you to explore all of your
63:16 - programming wonderful now that that clip
63:18 - ended it was supposed to loop so
63:19 - apologies for my technical mistake there
63:21 - um they also have this wonderful course
63:24 - about neural networks so i you know i
63:26 - spend a lot of time
63:28 - on my channel doing uh videos about
63:31 - machine learning and neural networks and
63:33 - this particular course you can see here
63:36 - you know i i wish
63:38 - that i had in my videos a sort of uh a
63:42 - an interactive explanation and
63:44 - demonstration of how a neural network
63:46 - can recognize handwritten digits um and
63:53 - uh i forgot to turn on looping so you
63:55 - got to come back and see me um so let's
63:58 - go let's go wander over to the uh
64:00 - brilliant website for a minute
64:03 - um and it's going to let's take a look
64:05 - at it um i have been doing the logic
64:08 - course
64:09 - um i was i i um and a bunch of these
64:12 - also this is really one of my favorites
64:14 - i mean the thing about the ones the one
64:16 - thing that i really love about brilliant
64:18 - honestly
64:19 - uh for me personally is i need more
64:21 - ideas for videos and i was just looking
64:23 - at a lesson i forgot which course it's
64:24 - in about the kerninsburg
64:27 - i'm probably saying that bridge
64:30 - the konigsberg bridge problem
64:33 - um which is a well-known um
64:39 - problem around graph theory and with
64:41 - math so i was like oh i could do that as
64:43 - a coding college the seven bridges of
64:44 - kerningsburg
64:46 - um so uh um there's you know these are
64:48 - the kinds of problems that are really
64:50 - rich and ripe for this so let's take a
64:51 - quick look
64:52 - um i kind of want to go back to this
64:54 - beautiful job oh i love the what is
64:56 - what's infinite data structures
64:58 - i can't pick
65:00 - let's go back to abstract order logic i
65:02 - don't remember actually doing this one i
65:04 - think i might have just started it i
65:06 - didn't really get very far with it let's
65:07 - take a look um
65:09 - the evil core robots continued their
65:12 - physical fitness evaluation but it's day
65:13 - two and they're getting tired their
65:15 - self-reporting of results while still
65:17 - accurate is even spottier based on
65:19 - limited information it's possible to
65:20 - tell exactly how the races ended up
65:21 - there are multiple possible outcomes
65:23 - okay
65:24 - how many different orders could the
65:26 - racers finish
65:28 - the only report that rey finishes ahead
65:32 - of tie
65:33 - so
65:35 - here's a possibility
65:38 - one
65:40 - two
65:44 - three i've definitely got three
65:48 - right so let's think about this if rey
65:50 - is ahead of tie ray cannot be last so re
65:53 - can only be in one of these two spots if
65:56 - rey is in this spot
65:58 - a tie has to be here so there's only one
66:01 - configuration if ray is in this spot
66:03 - there's two configurations because tai
66:05 - and marv could switch so three should be
66:07 - the answer
66:10 - you know brilliant should really include
66:12 - these drum rolls into their website they
66:13 - have wonderful sound effects but
66:21 - i got it right
66:23 - okay
66:24 - so um i hope you can sort of get the
66:26 - idea oh i want to just keep going with
66:27 - this because they're so fun to do
66:30 - but i'm just going to encourage you i'm
66:31 - gonna take a one or two minute break
66:33 - sign up at brilliant.org codingtrain
66:35 - lets them know that you found out about
66:37 - um brilliant from me there's the url on
66:40 - the screen and it's it's free you can
66:41 - sign up for free there is a premium
66:43 - subscription that you can get through
66:45 - that link the first 200 people to do so
66:47 - will get 20 off of that it's also a
66:48 - wonderful gift you can gift a premium
66:50 - subscription to somebody if you don't
66:51 - know what to get them and they love
66:52 - learning um i would certainly suggest
66:54 - that as well um okay so i'm gonna take
66:57 - hopefully just like a two minute break
67:00 - uh uh where you could
67:02 - talk amongst yourselves sign up for
67:04 - brilliant enjoy uh stretch your legs and
67:06 - arms i'm gonna grab a little bit of
67:07 - water um and i will be back within two
67:10 - minutes and we are going to finally if
67:12 - you were here for the end body stuff uh
67:14 - that's what i'm doing from about 11 10
67:17 - to noon here eastern time i'll be right
67:20 - back
67:32 - so
67:36 - [Music]
67:59 - [Music]
68:11 - [Music]
69:09 - [Music]
69:30 - check check making sure my mic is back
69:32 - i i've gone through great lengths
69:35 - some unit multiple in a million
69:37 - different possible ways during this
69:39 - break
69:40 - oh i better come back look at how
69:41 - everybody's leaving
69:56 - [Music]
70:00 - all right i have returned
70:04 - it was hopefully less than two minutes
70:06 - or it was probably about two minutes
70:08 - um
70:10 - andrew isaac asked will you be
70:12 - considering approximations like quad
70:14 - trees yes so i'm a little to be honest
70:17 - this is where my list
70:20 - that i made of things to go over today
70:22 - in today's stream kind of falls apart
70:25 - because i don't really have an exact
70:27 - plan here but let me
70:30 - um
70:32 - let me uh give you back
70:35 - let me get myself i was kind of going to
70:36 - organize my tabs and things during the
70:39 - break but
70:40 - um
70:42 - instead i'm just going to do that with
70:44 - you all watching um let me close these
70:47 - out
70:48 - um
70:50 - and i don't need any of these open
70:53 - um
70:56 - and
70:58 - uh okay so let's
71:01 - let's figure out what we're doing here
71:03 - so first
71:10 - so
71:11 - let's start here
71:13 - okay
71:14 - so the idea of the end body problem or
71:17 - maybe a better search for me here would
71:19 - be like an n-body simulation
71:22 - um
71:24 - because there's this really incredible
71:25 - one uh that i love
71:28 - oh it's actually not this one although
71:29 - i'm sure this one is great
71:31 - there's a really
71:33 - all right i'm not gonna i'm not gonna
71:34 - just randomly scroll through wikipedia
71:35 - right now but the idea of an end body
71:37 - problem is
71:43 - let me come back over here
71:47 - and i have to apologize uh those of you
71:49 - have been tuning in on twitch recently
71:51 - you'll know that when i'm over here i
71:53 - can't really see the chat or anything
71:55 - that's going on
71:56 - but hopefully
71:58 - everything looks right
71:59 - um the idea of an end body problem
72:03 - and i wonder if i should be recording
72:04 - this
72:05 - i'm just going to record this just in
72:06 - case hold on
72:08 - ultimately i want to turn this into a
72:10 - tutorial video
72:12 - but i don't know if i feel ready to do
72:14 - that today
72:19 - but just in case i want to use any of
72:21 - this material
72:25 - i have a system
72:27 - by which
72:29 - i can
72:30 - record what i'm doing to disk all the
72:32 - various parts of it so that i can re-put
72:35 - it together later all right
72:38 - so um
72:42 - yeah i think i'm going to just allow
72:43 - myself to be very free-form here and not
72:45 - and kind of let you know where my brain
72:47 - is at and we'll see where this leads
72:50 - so
72:51 - if you've been following the nature of
72:53 - code series which i have not continued
72:55 - in quite a while
72:56 - chapter two
73:01 - is all about forces
73:04 - and apologies for the shaky white board
73:09 - um
73:10 - and
73:12 - it starts off by looking at just
73:16 - force equals oops
73:22 - force equals
73:24 - mass
73:26 - times acceleration
73:28 - and how i can translate that into
73:32 - euler
73:33 - integration
73:34 - which is a very fancy sounding name for
73:37 - the code that's in almost every one of
73:38 - my examples that has like velocity
73:42 - add acceleration
73:44 - and then position
73:46 - [Music]
73:47 - add velocity
73:49 - so the idea is that we have a body
73:54 - that has a position
73:55 - vector
73:58 - of where it is as well as a velocity
74:01 - there are forces in the system which
74:04 - affect the acceleration which then
74:06 - alters the velocity which then alters
74:08 - the position that's the core idea of the
74:11 - sort of physics simulation behind the
74:12 - nature of code the really limiting
74:15 - factor
74:16 - uh to the sort of like level of
74:19 - sophistication and breadth and depth of
74:21 - what i am able to achieve in those sort
74:24 - of basic examples is really due to this
74:26 - simpler
74:27 - simple integration technique like i'm
74:29 - not really using
74:31 - laws of motion and ordinary differential
74:34 - equations and all those kinds of things
74:35 - that you might find in a physics
74:37 - textbook i want a rapid fast
74:41 - algorithm and uh implementation to make
74:44 - stuff happen
74:46 - so this
74:48 - is what
74:49 - the reason why i gave you all that
74:50 - backstory is because this is a body
74:56 - i'm starting to feel like oh maybe i
74:57 - could actually use this
74:59 - i'm recording it yay
75:01 - this is a body
75:03 - so an n body
75:04 - like a two body let's just talk about
75:06 - like what would be a two body
75:09 - simulation or what is the two-body
75:11 - problem
75:13 - what if i had
75:15 - two bodies
75:18 - what would be the motion of these bodies
75:22 - based on the forces in their environment
75:25 - now but we're talking about a very
75:27 - specific kind of force and the kind of
75:29 - force we're talking about is
75:31 - gravitational attraction
75:33 - the force of gravity equals the
75:36 - universal constant g
75:39 - times the mass of one object
75:43 - times the mass of another object divided
75:46 - by
75:47 - let's call this vector r
75:51 - the magnitude of r squared the distance
75:54 - squared
75:56 - um
75:57 - times the unit vector r
75:59 - and vice versa so
76:01 - this object is attracting this so what
76:04 - would the motion of those bodies be
76:06 - in a two body simulation let's go back
76:09 - to
76:10 - the computer i can sort of take a peek
76:12 - at the chat here for a second
76:14 - this is the beginning stages
76:17 - so if i look for under two body problem
76:20 - we can see
76:22 - uh we could take like the sun and the
76:24 - earth as the examples
76:26 - and you can sort of see there's
76:27 - something very similar going on
76:30 - to my formula here but
76:32 - um
76:34 - um
76:36 - and the two body problem is famously
76:38 - solved
76:40 - uh meaning we could actually calculate
76:42 - precisely the motion of these objects
76:45 - these bodies
76:46 - um and um let's just do like i always
76:49 - see like
76:50 - um
76:52 - i feel like when i was um
76:54 - you know there's always like wonderful
76:55 - blog posts like here we go
76:57 - this is just one that i happened to find
76:59 - we could see somebody made a beautiful
77:02 - kind of simulation showing this sort of
77:05 - solution and mapping out these orbits of
77:07 - the two bodies here
77:10 - so um i ultimately um
77:15 - in if oh sorry let's
77:17 - now let's go to
77:20 - uh the nature of code uh playlist
77:24 - and as you'll see
77:26 - where up where i left off back when i
77:29 - was recording these in april of 2020. oh
77:32 - hey anybody remember april of 2020
77:35 - i wonder why there were no more videos
77:37 - until january of 2021 and i didn't
77:39 - record this these just finally came out
77:41 - i mean i think i recorded all these in
77:43 - early march
77:45 - and yeah remember that
77:46 - all right but
77:48 - this particular example
77:53 - if i go to it
77:56 - is showing what looks kind of like an
77:59 - end body problem in a way like oh
78:02 - these are celestial bodies kind of
78:05 - orbiting around something
78:08 - it's like oh one if i just had one of
78:10 - these
78:12 - for example
78:16 - um
78:19 - if let's just change it to i'm sorry i'm
78:21 - having
78:22 - trouble with my spacing here when i
78:25 - recorded my last coding challenge i was
78:26 - standing in front of the code too much
78:28 - but i do have more room here so let me
78:31 - space this out a little bit better
78:33 - um i want to just change this to one
78:35 - you can say like oh is this the two body
78:37 - problem
78:38 - uh and if i sort of like were to somehow
78:42 - put in
78:43 - the
78:44 - uh relative masses of the sun and the
78:47 - earth and like an initial velocity would
78:49 - i get something that resembled the
78:50 - earth's orbit and if i drew it with the
78:52 - sort of like sun everything being like
78:54 - relative to the sun's position even if
78:57 - um you know then would i see something
78:58 - so the answer most likely is no because
79:02 - in my
79:04 - uh sorry
79:05 - in all of my examples i am using this
79:08 - highly approximate technique
79:12 - so i would need to have you know really
79:15 - solve
79:16 - in a sort of pure mathematics way the
79:19 - equations of motion to map that precise
79:22 - orbit pattern so that's problem number
79:25 - one problem number two
79:27 - is
79:28 - i'm actually not doing that in this
79:30 - example there is only the force of this
79:33 - pink dot
79:35 - attracting the other circle
79:38 - so there is no mutual attraction
79:40 - one body has exerts a gravitational
79:43 - force on the other the other
79:45 - uh exerts that same gravitational force
79:47 - on the that one body but in the other
79:49 - direction
79:50 - so
79:51 - all of this to say is to say
79:54 - here i am wanting to make a video or a
79:57 - coding challenge or more likely what i
79:59 - think probably makes sense should just
80:01 - be
80:03 - 2.6 like the next video in this sequence
80:08 - what direction do i go in so certainly i
80:11 - absolutely could solve right now
80:15 - for the issue where i wasn't doing both
80:18 - forces
80:19 - so i feel pretty confident because i
80:21 - i've already done this it's actually in
80:23 - the textbook itself
80:25 - i could show you a sort of simulation of
80:27 - this two body problem by giving both
80:30 - uh mutual mutually attracting each other
80:34 - i would not however have solved for
80:37 - optimizing this
80:38 - i think i don't want to go down the road
80:41 - of
80:43 - looking deeper into the mathematical
80:45 - equations a little bit
80:46 - i like to say out of scope as like uh
80:50 - like
80:50 - i don't excuse is the wrong word but
80:52 - like an escape valve for when i'm like
80:54 - i'm just not prepared to do that it
80:55 - doesn't really fit into how i've worked
80:57 - these code examples i'm not i haven't
80:59 - really researched this i just can't like
81:01 - do this off the cuff today i don't feel
81:02 - like but but but really it's just not a
81:04 - scope
81:06 - um
81:07 - so
81:08 - um so that's one direction i could do it
81:10 - wouldn't be so interesting with two
81:12 - bodies but
81:13 - it certainly could be interesting
81:16 - uh with n bodies and in fact i did do
81:18 - that
81:19 - let me show you
81:22 - um let me show you if i go to my and i'm
81:24 - just gonna switch over here for a second
81:26 - i'm gonna go to my twitter for a second
81:29 - because during the month of january
81:32 - there was an initiative
81:34 - and apologies that i don't have to
81:36 - scroll through this for a while
81:38 - um
81:39 - there was an initiative called january
81:43 - which
81:44 - was to do like a sort of creative
81:47 - project
81:49 - every day
81:52 - and that this one was that was the like
81:54 - i did little things like this this was
81:55 - for day 30. organic looking output look
81:58 - using only rectangular shapes flocking
82:00 - simulation so i want to go down and find
82:03 - my um
82:05 - the prompt i did for the day called
82:08 - space there was a day where the prompt
82:10 - was space
82:12 - and i basically took this idea of mutual
82:14 - attraction
82:16 - and actually you can see it here
82:18 - this is a variation of it i did with uh
82:20 - just adding some color so this is an
82:23 - n-body simulation it's basically doing
82:27 - whoops
82:28 - exactly this formula with like zillions
82:33 - of particles it's not really i don't
82:35 - remember how many i used and kind of
82:37 - drawing them with some additive blending
82:38 - giving them an initial state that caused
82:41 - that sort of results in this swirling
82:43 - pattern um but uh i even used somebody
82:46 - had asked about a quad tree i used some
82:48 - but it this was rendering at about like
82:52 - you know a frame
82:54 - per five seconds you know i just didn't
82:57 - do any so i don't know that i could
82:58 - probably do a version of this with like
83:00 - a thousand particles
83:02 - uh we might get somewhere kind of
83:03 - interesting so that's something that i
83:05 - could do
83:07 - and then there's one other thing that
83:08 - i'm kind of intrigued by
83:10 - so if i'm making a list of options
83:14 - there's just
83:16 - option number
83:17 - one is
83:19 - uh add this is probably what i want to
83:22 - do add mutual attraction
83:26 - but keep
83:27 - euler integration that sort of simple
83:30 - thing
83:31 - and then uh
83:34 - two bodies
83:36 - and then go to
83:38 - n bodies
83:40 - and then maybe add
83:43 - quadtree
83:45 - which is actually a there's something
83:47 - called the barnes hut
83:50 - which i have not researched in detail
83:52 - barnes hut did i say barnes nut i think
83:54 - it's barnes hut i don't remember
83:56 - um
83:57 - which is i think just ultimately
83:59 - applying a quad tree to n bodies but
84:02 - maybe it has to do with like adding the
84:03 - forces in each cell of the quad tree or
84:05 - something so it's a slight variation on
84:07 - that i think so this is what i'm
84:09 - thinking of doing
84:10 - the question is is this a coding
84:13 - challenge
84:17 - or
84:18 - is it
84:19 - 2.6
84:21 - nature of code that's the quest that's
84:23 - question number one
84:26 - another question is is it worth
84:28 - investigating improving
84:31 - the integration and sorry that i'm just
84:34 - kind of not writing this well but i was
84:36 - reading about something called leapfrog
84:39 - integration which is kind of doing sort
84:41 - of like these sort of partial updates
84:44 - multiple times through a given time step
84:47 - um that can maybe make the actual motion
84:50 - a bit more accurate to the true physics
84:53 - i'm not super inclined to do that i feel
84:55 - like that's out of scope
84:58 - but i'm thinking about that and then the
85:00 - other thing the last thing i want to
85:01 - mention before i i don't know what i'm
85:02 - what i'm really doing today ultimately
85:04 - i'm talking this through is what i'm
85:06 - doing and then i
85:07 - come back next week or tomorrow or uh
85:10 - stay an extra little bit of extra time i
85:12 - don't really know um
85:14 - but um there's one other thing i want to
85:16 - mention which is really cool
85:19 - and i i'm not looking at your feedback
85:21 - right now i really want to hear your
85:22 - feedback
85:23 - but
85:24 - um
85:27 - um so
85:29 - um
85:30 - [Music]
85:33 - uh
85:34 - where am i oh i'm in the wrong thing
85:36 - okay
85:36 - so
85:37 - i'm gonna do like a quarry three body
85:41 - choreographies i think this will pull up
85:43 - the paper i'm looking for
85:45 - um
85:51 - um look uh dan grease did the
85:54 - visualizations for the paper
85:56 - uh yep this is what i'm looking for
85:58 - um oh so this is actually the
86:00 - visualization i want to find the paper
86:02 - though very briefly
86:03 - um
86:06 - uh antaldi
86:09 - uh
86:11 - uh paper choreographies sorry i really
86:14 - meant to have these things ready to show
86:16 - you
86:18 - yeah this is what i'm looking for
86:20 - uh pdf
86:23 - okay so there's this amazing paper that
86:25 - i have
86:26 - yet to read i've
86:28 - skimmed it
86:29 - because i only found it like yesterday
86:31 - afternoon which is looking at a
86:33 - particular
86:34 - set of stable orbits of three body um
86:40 - of three bodies so it's a kind of like a
86:42 - paper about
86:44 - an apologies if i'm kind of
86:45 - mischaracterizing this this is my sort
86:47 - of cursory understanding of this
86:49 - but basically it's looking at a set of
86:52 - initial conditions for a three-body
86:54 - problem that produces these stable
86:57 - orbits because that three-body problem
86:59 - is famously chaotic
87:01 - and so one of the things that i thought
87:03 - is could i try to and and and uh dan
87:07 - greece who did
87:08 - these i'm gonna ramp up the speed here
87:11 - did these visual um visualizations of
87:14 - these particular orbits um like if i
87:16 - click on this one four on oh these
87:18 - aren't just three bodies these are end
87:19 - body choreography so these are four i
87:22 - was curious to see
87:24 - if i could try to recreate this
87:27 - how close i could get using just like
87:30 - euler integration so these were done
87:33 - using i guess like a sort of fourier
87:35 - um
87:36 - [Music]
87:37 - set of fourier transforms uh i believe
87:40 - um and so these are just sort of like
87:41 - the precise routes there's not a physics
87:44 - simulation going on here so that's like
87:46 - a quite an aside but i could do that
87:49 - just as a video itself
87:51 - so i don't know how to decide or how to
87:53 - ask you
87:54 - um
87:55 - there's a three-body novel problem novel
87:59 - i have not read that
88:00 - three body problem
88:03 - novel
88:06 - what is this
88:08 - a science fiction novel written by the
88:10 - chinese writer okay i gotta write this
88:12 - down
88:15 - three body
88:16 - novel well i should read that before i
88:18 - do this three body novels i'm just going
88:21 - to take a quick scan at the chat take
88:23 - the temperature for a second here
88:25 - real time on gpu that's probably not
88:28 - going to have
88:29 - happen um
88:30 - [Music]
88:34 - yeah i mean so so by the way if you're
88:36 - looking for
88:37 - the sort of like latest and greatest
88:39 - most highest end like you know compute
88:43 - shader
88:44 - probably like
88:46 - n body
88:48 - simulation
88:49 - like people are doing these and there's
88:51 - like amazing ones uh
88:53 - i don't know like which one of these to
88:55 - click on how how old or recent they are
88:58 - but
88:59 - this is a thing that people do which is
89:01 - to create these very high-end
89:04 - fully optimized gpu-based end-body
89:06 - simulations
89:08 - um but that's again that's not really my
89:11 - thing like i want to teach the concepts
89:12 - and give you kind of like a basic kind
89:14 - of bite-sized working version
89:16 - simon wrote that's a trilogy it's being
89:19 - turned into a netflix or amazon series
89:22 - well
89:24 - by golly are you serious
89:27 - how can i how can i
89:30 - capitalize on that
89:33 - so simon's saying there's no reason you
89:34 - can't make it both a coding challenge
89:36 - and 2.6 of nfc absolutely
89:39 - so conceptually that's what it is
89:42 - the question is which way is it branded
89:46 - and what what's its like home
89:48 - base
89:50 - like is it a video that has
89:53 - the nature of code visual treatment
89:56 - it's called 2.6 that's much more tied to
90:00 - me just sort of doing a tutorial about
90:01 - this concept
90:04 - or is it a coding challenge where i'm
90:06 - kind of more building it as we go again
90:09 - both of these are kind of the same thing
90:10 - ultimately in how my process but it has
90:13 - a thumbnail looks it's called a coding
90:15 - challenge it has the number and then i
90:16 - could just drop it into the nature of
90:18 - code playlist as like a wrap-up of the
90:20 - chapter
90:22 - i'm kind of leaning towards that right
90:23 - now
90:28 - runge-kutta is another thing
90:32 - that
90:33 - is being suggested yes so that's another
90:43 - i guess what i want to know
90:46 - from all of you experts out there
90:48 - is if all i do
90:51 - is take my simple gravitational
90:54 - attraction example with euler
90:56 - integration
91:00 - create an array of the body of the
91:01 - things
91:03 - um and
91:05 - calculate their mutual attraction forces
91:07 - with the same exact technique basically
91:09 - this
91:10 - if i add mutual attraction so each body
91:13 - attracts each other one i try with two
91:16 - maybe i try with three i could represe i
91:19 - could i could refer this is what i'm
91:21 - going to do i think i've got it i could
91:22 - refer to those choreographic things
91:24 - maybe try some of them
91:26 - and then i could just sort of see how it
91:28 - goes with a lot of them
91:30 - how far i can sort of do the performance
91:33 - maybe i can incorporate this maybe this
91:35 - is just like an additional reference but
91:38 - this is my trajectory
91:39 - if i call it n body if i talk about how
91:42 - i'm doing this as an end body simulation
91:44 - are people going to get hung up
91:47 - am i doing a disservice by sticking with
91:50 - this
91:52 - really uh the sort of like simplest
91:54 - basic a form of integration that's
91:57 - highly inaccurate
91:58 - so i'm not really doing a uh i'm not
92:01 - attempting to
92:02 - create a realistic realistic is wrong
92:04 - where i want it to feel realistic but
92:06 - i'm not attempting to actually match the
92:09 - orbits of how real in our universe
92:12 - celestial bodies would interact with
92:14 - each other so that's kind of where i'm
92:16 - landing through this full explanation
92:21 - and i don't know what to try to achieve
92:24 - now in the next 30 minutes i mean
92:31 - it's being developed by the same people
92:32 - did game of thrones
92:34 - this is crazy
92:38 - all right so i'm just going to take a
92:39 - moment to think
92:40 - and like take a look at the chat
92:42 - sebastian lag oh that's not for me okay
92:44 - yeah
92:51 - turn it into einstein newton was
92:53 - yesterday yeah but see where my brain
92:55 - i'm still in the world of newton in the
92:57 - way that i think about creative coding
92:59 - and simulation
93:01 - um
93:06 - i don't think it needs to be accurate
93:07 - you're not trying to put a satellite
93:09 - into orbit
93:10 - says uh fishy 22 in the discord okay yes
93:14 - i'm in agreement with you
93:17 - so now the question let's make a poll i
93:19 - think i know what you're going to answer
93:22 - and i don't want to do i kind of want it
93:24 - to just be 2.6
93:26 - but i'm going to i'm going to put a
93:28 - little poll
93:31 - okay i'm definitely reading this book
93:33 - joseph i'm kind of
93:36 - i'm sort of stuck in this other fanta
93:38 - this fantasy series that's incredibly
93:40 - long
93:41 - and i'm being very slow at reading it
93:42 - i'm kind of busy and so i don't know if
93:44 - i should start saying no berlit
93:45 - integration
93:46 - uh freya uh oh
93:48 - look
93:51 - denise lehigh
93:53 - welcome
93:55 - you're the latest passenger
93:58 - conductor whoa to board the coding train
94:04 - thank you so much for your support um i
94:06 - really appreciate it i don't know if
94:08 - you're actually watching right now but
94:10 - um
94:11 - uh you get a random number
94:14 - remember remember this whole random
94:16 - number thing that i i all i do is start
94:18 - things and not follow them through
94:22 - i'm going to give you a random number
94:23 - anyway
94:25 - we're on page 314
94:27 - row
94:28 - 15680 column
94:30 - something
94:32 - nine
94:33 - it's not it's your random sequence of
94:35 - five digits it's 93791
94:38 - um and
94:39 - um
94:42 - i've got to figure out these are really
94:44 - uh
94:45 - apologies to everyone
94:47 - working on getting the conductors these
94:49 - train whistles
94:51 - um but i think if you've signed up on
94:53 - the conductor level one of these
94:55 - with a um
94:57 - random walk cus a unique random walk
94:59 - pattern is coming to you
95:02 - uh i'm very sad because i'm
95:05 - no one to blame but myself but
95:07 - um okay
95:08 - um all right wait
95:12 - magnus writes he hasn't even started yet
95:15 - oh no
95:16 - oh no see this is
95:23 - there's been some value in this and this
95:24 - is incredibly valuable for me i got to
95:27 - like go through a lot of lists of
95:28 - announcements and things
95:30 - in par give you information about my
95:31 - process and updates on my schedule
95:33 - things that are going on in the coding
95:35 - train universe
95:37 - and uh i'm thinking through what i'm
95:39 - going to do with this end body thing
95:42 - but i realized that like i'm getting
95:44 - really dangerously close to the end of
95:46 - this live stream and i have not even
95:47 - made
95:48 - a single coding example
95:50 - um
95:53 - um
95:55 - so let's put this poll in
95:59 - it's the same topic the same content
96:02 - but is it
96:04 - branded
96:05 - coding challenge
96:08 - branded
96:10 - 2.6 nature of code
96:18 - uh whoops
96:22 - i post this poll
96:25 - do i have to have three options
96:31 - um
96:36 - which one
96:40 - ask your community
96:43 - don't pick
96:47 - i guess i could call this like see
96:48 - results
96:52 - all right
96:54 - i think i posted this poll
96:56 - um
96:58 - let's see
96:59 - if i
97:01 - coding challenge as a recap of noc
97:04 - so um
97:09 - swarm simulations and i have that on my
97:11 - list
97:12 - um
97:14 - i mean i have done you know flocking
97:15 - simulations but i think there's a
97:17 - specific kind of i don't know why that
97:19 - poll didn't show up oh there it is
97:26 - um
97:30 - eric is here hi eric i haven't seen you
97:32 - in a while um
97:36 - so
97:38 - ah you're also on discord great so
97:41 - teamise make sure you
97:43 - sync your discord and youtube accounts
97:46 - so we can uh
97:48 - give you all the info there on discord
97:50 - um in terms of the member channel stuff
97:53 - um
97:55 - yeah
97:56 - so
97:57 - i think the real question here the
97:58 - reason why i'm i'm kind of airing
98:00 - against coding challenge
98:02 - or leaning against coding challenge even
98:04 - though that's winning currently in the
98:05 - poll
98:06 - is that
98:08 - um
98:10 - i
98:11 - i like the coding challenges to sort of
98:13 - start from a blank slate whenever is
98:15 - possible i mean obviously i'm using p5
98:17 - and i'm sometimes we'll pull in other
98:18 - libraries or other known techniques
98:21 - but i really want to just start this
98:24 - from where i left off the previous code
98:26 - all right i think that makes the
98:28 - decision for me and the numbers are
98:30 - pretty close like they're right now it
98:31 - says 40 coding challenge 30 41 coding 34
98:36 - so like that's enough like my vote
98:39 - counts for a lot it counts are at least
98:41 - 5
98:42 - so i can push it over the edge
98:45 - uh and and you know famously all i ever
98:48 - do is do the opposite of what the pole
98:49 - says i don't know why
98:52 - so i'm starting to think
98:54 - this should be
98:56 - um um nature of code 2.6
99:02 - and
99:03 - um
99:03 - [Music]
99:05 - that's what i'm thinking right now
99:07 - the question is and why did the
99:09 - the question is what the heck am i going
99:12 - to do with the next 20 minutes all right
99:14 - how about this
99:16 - um
99:17 - [Music]
99:19 - 25 of you abstained
99:22 - that's a high number um
99:28 - yeah and that's simon is saying for the
99:30 - end of every chapter you have a coding
99:32 - challenge that combines all the stuff
99:33 - from the chapter and you know you know
99:34 - you're kind of getting me i'm leaning
99:36 - back towards that idea because that's
99:38 - kind of what i wanted
99:40 - with the original and if you look at
99:43 - the
99:46 - i think if this
99:48 - comes up
99:50 - i think if you look at the playlist and
99:52 - the way that it's organized that's what
99:54 - i do for chapter three
99:58 - and in a way that's what i do for
99:59 - chapter five
100:01 - because um i just didn't put it in the
100:03 - playlist because i have flocking as a
100:04 - coding challenge
100:06 - and that's what i do for chapter three i
100:08 - have these coding challenges that kind
100:11 - of synthesize
100:13 - all the concepts so yeah let's do that
100:15 - let's call this
100:18 - coding challenge
100:21 - i'm going with oh no wait
100:24 - just as i swung back the other way
100:26 - branded nature of code is like coming up
100:29 - in this almost feeding branded coding
100:31 - challenge ah
100:34 - this is so hard
100:39 - i could still do a different coding
100:40 - challenge that wraps up the chapter
100:48 - um mean i think the real answer here is
100:51 - people just want me to make the video
100:53 - not just spend forever figuring out like
100:55 - whether it's called 2.6 or coding
100:58 - challenge number 1
101:00 - 60
101:02 - what number am i on now
101:04 - image to ascii is 166.
101:07 - prime spiral is 167 so it would be
101:10 - number 168.
101:13 - all right the other thing i could do
101:16 - is not worry about that at all
101:18 - and just kind of record
101:20 - the tutorial
101:22 - slash challenge
101:24 - and
101:25 - um
101:25 - [Music]
101:27 - um
101:30 - and um just come back and record like an
101:32 - intro for it later depending on
101:35 - how i end up sort of positioning it oh
101:37 - it's tied right now if you haven't voted
101:39 - yet you have tremendous power
101:41 - oh wait i haven't voted yet oh it
101:43 - doesn't let me vote
101:50 - uh uh consider that the c results are
101:52 - asking you to vote on their behalf
101:55 - yeah so
101:56 - that means i get 29 of the votes which
102:00 - is basically enough
102:03 - okay
102:05 - the the irony here is this there's no
102:08 - point in me trying to decide this today
102:09 - because
102:10 - i can't do this in 20 minutes could i do
102:12 - this in a half an hour and stay a little
102:13 - longer
102:16 - let me stop and restart recording
102:22 - okay one thing that i should do
102:24 - oh
102:26 - nature of code well how do i end the
102:28 - poll does it end automatically
102:31 - end pull all right i'm gonna give it
102:36 - i'm gonna give it um
102:38 - one more minute
102:40 - which uh is
102:45 - uh
102:47 - uh i'm gonna give it one more minute uh
102:50 - i'll just put a timer on my watch
102:53 - one minute okay in one minute i'm
102:56 - clicking end poll
102:58 - and certainly
102:59 - uh if it says branded nature of code
103:01 - that's what i'm gonna do if it says
103:03 - coding challenge i'll think about it
103:06 - ah they're back to tied i think the guy
103:08 - i think the audience is just trolling me
103:09 - to like try to keep it even
103:14 - coding challenge please says ashik
103:20 - um i mean this is the thing like what am
103:22 - i doing today
103:25 - i think if i do it by the way is the
103:27 - nature of code tutorial i have a greater
103:28 - chance of doing it today the other thing
103:30 - is here's my reasoning i'm kind of
103:33 - making the decision that the coding
103:34 - challenge videos will involve
103:37 - more
103:38 - less preparation
103:40 - and more uh post-production to make them
103:43 - kind of like
103:44 - short entertaining videos and the nature
103:46 - of code videos or
103:47 - again it's the same me and this sort of
103:49 - will be a little bit more like just
103:51 - let's just let me just code this let's
103:53 - edit it together let's put it out oop
103:55 - timer is done i'm going to go hit end
103:57 - poll
104:00 - and the numbers are final
104:03 - uh it went away but it was at 38 percent
104:07 - oh yeah
104:08 - there we go
104:10 - 311 votes
104:12 - 38
104:13 - nature of code
104:14 - 33 coding challenge
104:16 - 27 see results all right
104:19 - the people have spoken no matter what i
104:22 - won't always follow what the poll says
104:27 - now the question is
104:29 - can i do so i don't need to do that full
104:31 - recap i do need to take a look at if
104:34 - you'll
104:36 - bear with me let me take a look at the
104:38 - 2.6 video
104:40 - um and just see like what i say at the
104:42 - end
104:46 - 2.5 sorry is going to be equal to the
104:49 - mass of one object times the mass of the
104:51 - other object divided by the distance
104:54 - squared
105:03 - um
106:16 - oh
106:33 - well
106:35 - i mean
106:36 - i could have saved myself a lot of
106:38 - trouble if i just watch that before i
106:40 - begin this whole discussion because
106:44 - that's the whole that's i mean i the
106:46 - video says that and i never did it
106:48 - because 2020.
106:51 - i came back and i just started with
106:52 - chapter three
106:54 - all right
106:56 - so
107:03 - i'm just crying because
107:06 - i took this whole live stream to like
107:08 - come to this conclusion
107:10 - and now i have like 15 minutes left i
107:14 - mean the next
107:16 - real commitment i have is at 1pm
107:20 - but i need to walk the dog i need to eat
107:23 - some lunch
107:25 - hmm
107:27 - i'm just trying to think like
107:28 - realistically
107:30 - like even if i said i'm gonna go to 12
107:32 - 30 am i gonna record this whole thing
107:36 - in 45 minutes i guess i could give it a
107:39 - try could i begin it and come back and
107:41 - finish it later or maybe i should just
107:43 - maybe i should just take the 15 minutes
107:45 - now
107:46 - to kind of do some quick experiments to
107:49 - like figure out what i'm going to do
107:51 - with the 2.6 video
107:57 - oh i really really really
107:59 - got myself into uh
108:02 - quite the pickle here
108:10 - all right
108:14 - i got myself all dressed up
108:16 - combed my hair i feel like this is a
108:18 - good shirt to wear for the nature of
108:20 - code
108:22 - i you know maybe what i'll do is i'm
108:24 - going to just act as if i'm going to
108:25 - start this tutorial
108:27 - but um i can uh like put the same
108:30 - clothes on and come back and finish it
108:32 - another time or maybe i'll just gain
108:34 - some momentum and finish it now or it'll
108:37 - just be practice so this will be
108:38 - practice this is practice
108:45 - i want to leave this up here because i
108:46 - might like to refer to that
108:48 - and
108:52 - this is the example where i left it
108:58 - so
108:59 - duplicate
109:03 - let's call this nature of code two let
109:05 - me call it mutual attraction
109:20 - and
109:24 - i wonder if i change this to 400 by i
109:27 - just feel like i don't have the right
109:28 - amount of space here to code
109:31 - i need that to be further over okay
109:33 - that's
109:34 - better um
109:42 - just make these a little smaller too
109:43 - there we go
109:44 - um
109:47 - i'm being eight so this is good this is
109:49 - this is my starting point
109:56 - okay
109:58 - now
110:02 - i will need to do i
110:04 - now the question is
110:06 - is any of this this was my
110:09 - recap so no
110:20 - so i'm going to erase all this
110:33 - so if i recorded
110:36 - the last 2.5 video in march of 2020 this
110:40 - is actually a full two years later
110:44 - i'm really tempted to open this door
110:46 - back here i think it'll bring too much
110:47 - light in here
110:49 - which will but i love the idea let's
110:51 - just try this
110:59 - oh shoot
111:00 - oh i can't get it
111:02 - it's jammed
111:04 - to pull do i pull it oh no i have to
111:06 - unlock it
111:07 - it's not jammed
111:14 - it's such a beautiful day
111:21 - does that
111:22 - uh
111:32 - how to never actually record a video oh
111:34 - boy now wait hold on
111:41 - what am i doing now i'm like let me
111:43 - adjust the camera
111:45 - i just love having
111:46 - the the nature scene in the background
111:50 - of course my lighting is all a mess now
111:54 - can you see that
111:57 - um i think i need to turn
112:00 - down it's too bright oh yeah oh my god
112:04 - um
112:09 - wrong way
112:18 - uh
112:19 - should i change the iso
112:34 - what have i done
112:41 - oh no this is so badly backlit now okay
112:45 - hold on
112:47 - i see i see the issue
112:48 - don't worry everybody we're gonna get it
112:50 - back
112:52 - okay
112:55 - it's just some fresh air
112:58 - okay
113:06 - this is a problem i thought i locked the
113:08 - uh
113:15 - i mean if i were in class
113:18 - if i were actually teaching my nature of
113:19 - code class at nyu
113:21 - and i was like oh we have a half an hour
113:23 - left let's go over the mutual attraction
113:25 - example that would be no problem i would
113:27 - be no problem i got that half an hour
113:29 - here we go
113:34 - matcha is gonna kill me
113:36 - i had worked so hard to light this white
113:39 - board
113:42 - and i've completely messed it up
113:47 - let me just
113:49 - take a peek at the chat here
113:53 - uh
113:55 - um
113:57 - i'm just
113:59 - i love how i'm like outside though
114:01 - that's wild
114:04 - um maybe that'll get over i mean maybe
114:07 - it'll sort of turn a little bit more
114:08 - overcast
114:10 - um
114:16 - all right this is just practice anyway
114:18 - where'd i put my marker
114:23 - all right
114:25 - um
114:29 - let me just quickly just see if i can
114:31 - see
114:32 - if the focus is okay
114:34 - um
114:41 - you know i shouldn't put the number
114:43 - i shouldn't put the number
114:46 - let me just write on here
114:57 - you true
115:15 - just write that there
115:17 - let me have a look
115:18 - oh yeah that looks pretty good actually
115:21 - that looks pretty good
115:23 - okay
115:31 - i do i'm a little okay okay
115:35 - okay
115:36 - good enough
115:40 - all right
115:41 - here we go everybody
115:44 - the street has five minutes left but i'm
115:46 - gonna go till 12 30.
115:48 - i've got i'm a little bit hungry this is
115:50 - going to be a little bit of a problem
115:51 - but i think i can tough it out till 12
115:53 - 30. probably will never use this i'm
115:56 - gonna hit uh
115:57 - stop
115:58 - and start recording again
116:00 - i'm just going to turn my mic down a
116:03 - tiny bit even though
116:09 - yeah people are wondering where i am
116:11 - i am in the hudson valley right now in
116:13 - new york state but yes i did grow up in
116:14 - baltimore both go go o's
116:21 - and
116:26 - all right
116:31 - here we go ready everybody
116:38 - uh what have i got in terms of like in
116:40 - the way here
116:43 - that's fine what's uh what are you
116:44 - seeing here can i
116:46 - get this out of the way i guess this is
116:49 - fine i don't love having this stream
116:51 - deck here
116:52 - in the shot
116:53 - i guess i could move desk down a tiny
116:57 - bit
116:59 - yeah that's fine
117:01 - okay better i mean i have to look much
117:03 - more down but okay
117:06 - welcome to another nature of code video
117:09 - this one is all about mutual attraction
117:11 - and the end body problem now i don't
117:13 - know how you arrived here
117:16 - this is a follow-up to the previous
117:18 - video about gravitational attraction but
117:20 - i'm actually making it almost two years
117:22 - later i just watched the end of that
117:23 - video so i think i know if you're
117:25 - watching this in sequence what you
117:26 - expect
117:28 - okay so that's my opening
117:32 - that is correct uh daniel valdengro okay
117:36 - um
117:48 - this is the example from the end of the
117:50 - last video where every one of these
117:52 - orbiting circles
117:54 - is attracted to that pink circle in the
117:57 - center but this is not anywhere close to
118:00 - a true simulation of how celestial
118:02 - bodies would interact with each other in
118:05 - the wonder valley
118:07 - in the vast wonder that is space
118:22 - this is not at all how actual uh
118:24 - whatever that's fine this is just
118:26 - practice
118:31 - what is
118:33 - the step
118:34 - this is way too exciting i'm way too
118:36 - excited by this like nature scene it's
118:38 - kind of amazing looking forward to the
118:40 - spring when it really gets warm
118:47 - okay
118:51 - so what am i talking about here let's
118:53 - just
118:55 - all right
118:56 - let's review very quickly that formula
118:59 - for gravitational attraction
119:24 - so in the case here we have two bodies
119:30 - i'm going to call them m1 and m2 that's
119:32 - they're the mass of one in the massive
119:34 - two oh no
119:35 - i'm gonna call them body one and body
119:38 - two
119:39 - i'm gonna call them body one and body
119:40 - two
119:44 - they each have a mass that is what is
119:46 - represented by m1 and m2 in this formula
119:52 - we can look at the vector that points
119:54 - from one body to the other
119:59 - we can call that vector r
120:02 - the magnitude of that vector squared is
120:04 - the distance between the two objects
120:06 - squared and then this here is the unit
120:08 - vector to describe
120:10 - the direction of that gravitational
120:12 - force so in my code example this
120:16 - is the pink dot in the center and this
120:19 - is
120:20 - the other circle that is orbiting around
120:23 - that that's being attracted to that pink
120:25 - dot but
120:26 - in the troop needham
120:28 - but if you go back to what i think i
120:30 - mentioned in an earlier video
120:34 - but if you go back to hopefully when i
120:37 - talked about newton's laws
120:40 - and
120:41 - how forces occur in pairs
120:43 - the gravitational force that two
120:47 - exerts on one pulling it towards it
120:50 - one exerts on two pulling it
120:53 - towards this
120:54 - and if
120:55 - we have two
120:57 - bodies
121:01 - if we have two bodies that have no other
121:05 - sorry so if we have two bodies like one
121:08 - and two here and there are no other
121:10 - forces in the environment there's no air
121:13 - resistance there's no other things other
121:15 - bodies the pure essence of just the
121:19 - gravitational forces that these two
121:21 - bodies exert on each other and what
121:23 - motion would occur is known as the
121:26 - two-body problem
121:39 - why did i draw all those
121:41 - stars
121:53 - okay what do i want to say next
122:00 - now one thing i should mention
122:07 - one thing i should mention now
122:09 - one thing i'd like to mention if you
122:10 - were about to go and do some research
122:13 - about the two body problem you would
122:15 - discover that it is a solved problem
122:18 - that the paths of the motion of these
122:20 - bodies can be computed precisely with
122:23 - mathematical equations
122:27 - starting with the formula for
122:28 - gravitational uh attraction and the
122:30 - equations of motion
122:33 - to to execute those solutions requires
122:37 - calculus and here we are in the nature
122:39 - of code creative coding funtime
122:41 - landscape
122:45 - where instead of using
122:47 - um instead of using sort of the
122:50 - instead of using
122:52 - instead of evaluating um
122:54 - [Music]
122:57 - instead of evaluating a simulation
122:59 - according to precise mathematical
123:05 - instead of evaluating the scenario
123:07 - through solving differential equations
123:10 - i'm using this technique that i've
123:12 - described previously as euler
123:14 - integration where we just use large time
123:17 - steps the frames of our in
123:20 - the frames of our animation and we add
123:23 - acceleration into the velocity and the
123:25 - velocity into the position
123:35 - shoot
123:46 - i wrote this totally wrong
123:49 - you just do that again
124:07 - if we wanted to investigate some more
124:10 - accurate ways or
124:12 - if we wanted to investigate some more
124:13 - sophisticated methods
124:15 - for doing performing this kind of
124:17 - integration you could we could look at
124:20 - something called leapfrog
124:22 - integration we could look at verlet
124:25 - integration
124:27 - we could look at runge-kutta integration
124:36 - and i would love to hear from you if you
124:38 - try to execute a version of whatever i
124:40 - make in this video with one of these
124:42 - styles of integration does that improve
124:44 - or change the results that you get from
124:46 - whatever examples i make here
124:48 - please let me know in the comments
124:53 - but for creating a sort of first pass at
124:56 - the two-body problem
124:57 - then maybe moving to a three-body
124:59 - problem
125:00 - and then to an n-body problem i'm gonna
125:03 - just stick with my simplistic method
125:06 - known as euler integration
125:12 - the other nice thing about what we're
125:13 - doing here is i'm foreshadowing some
125:15 - things that are come later in the nature
125:17 - of code in particular in the autonomous
125:19 - agents chapter because one of the things
125:21 - i want to look at are scenarios like
125:23 - flocking simulations where every agent
125:26 - moving around a system
125:28 - interacts with every other agent
125:32 - that's what we are beginning to do here
125:34 - but with gravitational attraction
125:38 - we will see that we'll quickly run into
125:41 - a kind of computation roadblock because
125:44 - this is a problem that is typically an n
125:48 - squared problem if i have n bodies i
125:51 - need to check everybody's force against
125:54 - every other body that's n squared
125:59 - however there are some optimization
126:01 - techniques that i do have some videos
126:03 - about that you could also consider for
126:05 - when we move from two to three to n
126:13 - for example you might take a look at my
126:14 - videos on the quad tree
126:22 - and a technique
126:23 - designed for end body simulation known
126:26 - as barnes hut
126:34 - but i think i've shown off my outdoor
126:36 - it's not really outdoor i'm like
126:37 - slightly inside this garage whiteboard
126:40 - enough and i could go over and start
126:42 - writing some code to step into at least
126:44 - the two body problem
126:53 - all right
126:54 - so how was that every server thank you
126:56 - bot for your super chat
126:58 - um
127:02 - all right
127:10 - all right so thank you simon when i get
127:12 - to
127:12 - when i get to the three body problem
127:14 - your quote there is super helpful
127:17 - um
127:20 - so how is that so far by the way i'm
127:22 - like hey
127:24 - um love from vancouver thank you i'm
127:26 - like hey
127:27 - this is going okay i'm gonna keep this
127:29 - i'm recording the video right now it's
127:32 - happening
127:33 - and i have
127:34 - 24 minutes to give myself myself give
127:37 - myself at least a half an hour before my
127:39 - next thing today let me just check and
127:41 - make sure there's no like emergency
127:43 - um messages of like um
127:47 - you know
127:48 - uh
127:48 - your children have to break be picked up
127:50 - from school
127:52 - blah blah no no emergency messages i can
127:54 - keep going uh thank you zero one
127:58 - all right um
128:01 - uh uh i'm really worried about my volume
128:03 - is peaking quite a bit i'm turning it
128:05 - down
128:07 - turning it down
128:08 - all right
128:10 - so
128:14 - the first thing that i would like to do
128:15 - to this example i'm going to stick with
128:17 - the array
128:18 - um
128:21 - all right
128:22 - so in looking at this example while if i
128:24 - wanted to do a two body simulation i
128:27 - could reduce it to just two separate
128:29 - variables mover one mover two um i would
128:33 - like to stick with the array because
128:35 - that's going to help me later so what
128:36 - i'm going to do is just change the array
128:39 - to having just two elements in it
128:41 - and i'm also going to get rid of this
128:44 - idea of an attractor right there is no
128:47 - distinction now in this example that i
128:49 - want to make between mover and attractor
128:51 - i mean that's not a real world
128:52 - distinction that's an artificial thing
128:54 - that i created for this idea of
128:56 - attraction simulation
128:58 - attraction simulations and
128:59 - visualizations so now i'm just going to
129:02 - completely get rid of this idea of an
129:03 - attractor
129:05 - i'm also going to take out the reference
129:08 - to the attractor javascript file
129:11 - and by the way i don't know when you're
129:13 - watching this at what time in history
129:15 - and whether p5 is even a thing that
129:16 - exists but i might as well take a moment
129:19 - right now to um update my version of p5
129:22 - from the last time i recorded these
129:24 - videos
129:25 - which is 1.4.0
129:30 - okay stop
129:40 - now let me go back and get rid of this
129:42 - attractor
129:54 - and now we have two bodies now they are
129:57 - not
129:58 - exerting any force on each other
130:00 - whatsoever they're just two bodies with
130:02 - an initial random velocity
130:08 - i'm going to take
130:09 - the exact attract function i put in the
130:13 - attractor and move it over into the
130:15 - mover
130:19 - for those of you watching the live
130:20 - stream i'm gonna be done in like five
130:21 - minutes i mean not really but
130:35 - so now the mover
130:38 - has a function by which it can attract
130:41 - another mover
130:53 - just
131:01 - sorry i'm reading the chat for a second
131:02 - okay um
131:07 - and let me actually i'm actually going
131:08 - to delete the attractor.js file
131:11 - just to keep things clean
131:23 - so
131:25 - because i
131:27 - now because i have an array
131:30 - uh oh no now because i have only two
131:32 - mover objects i can write the explicit
131:36 - functions for mover one to attract two
131:39 - and mover two to attract one of course
131:41 - they're actually zero and one and one in
131:44 - zero because i'm using an array and
131:45 - arrays the index values start at zero
131:59 - so this
132:00 - whoops
132:03 - oh it's movers apologies
132:09 - so this is now
132:11 - mover zero attracting mover one and you
132:14 - kind of saw that so i think what i'd
132:15 - like to do
132:17 - is just
132:18 - give them very little um
132:23 - starting velocity
132:27 - and we can see every time i run this
132:30 - mover one is attracted to mover zero of
132:32 - course i'm not actually
132:34 - drawing their index values maybe i can
132:36 - overlay that here just so you can see
132:53 - now
132:54 - i have mover one
132:56 - attracting mover zero
132:59 - and you can see this little dance that
133:00 - they do with each other
133:30 - okay i'm just sort of thinking about
133:32 - where i'm going with this
133:40 - once again we might produce some results
133:42 - that we
133:45 - once again maybe we would reveal
133:47 - something more about this if we
133:51 - just like before if i draw these circles
133:54 - with trails i might be able to
133:57 - i'm trying to say here
134:02 - oh focus on me i really want to answer
134:04 - that question but uh i can't it's going
134:06 - to break my rhythm too much it's a
134:07 - really good question i would say no you
134:09 - don't need to switch but
134:10 - yes and that's what i'm gonna do ellis
134:12 - as well
134:17 - so just to try to understand and see
134:19 - what's going on a bit more let's add
134:21 - back some trails
134:30 - and let's see if we can give these
134:32 - circles more precise locations uh and
134:36 - with specific initial velocities to see
134:38 - if there's any kind of more expected
134:40 - patterns that we might see
135:14 - so now i have the mover start um on
135:18 - opposite horizontal ends of the canvas
135:22 - let's see what happens if i start one
135:24 - mover maybe moving directly up and the
135:26 - other ones start moving directly down
135:51 - so i'm going to add two additional
135:53 - arguments to the constructor which gives
135:55 - me the x and y components of the
135:57 - velocity vector
136:20 - well i love this they're moving quite
136:23 - slowly
136:24 - so a couple things i could do is let's
136:26 - give them a higher initial velocity
136:30 - and let's increase
136:32 - the strength of the gravitational force
136:40 - and we get this
136:41 - nice beautiful like sort of like
136:43 - repeating circular dance now again
136:47 - i am not using
136:50 - now again i'm not solving for the
136:52 - precise equations of motion i am not
136:55 - using the proper units of measurement
136:58 - that we might have in uh outer space
137:02 - or
137:03 - i'm not using the proper units of
137:05 - measurement that map to actual celestial
137:08 - bodies in terms of their distance and
137:10 - mass the universal gravitational
137:12 - constant but i do see this makes a lot
137:15 - of sense in terms of what we are seeing
137:17 - here
137:20 - oh i'm excited by this
137:26 - i almost don't want to keep going
137:27 - because i want to stop here
137:29 - and just like play with the parameters
137:31 - and variables of the system add
137:32 - infinitem
137:34 - but let's add a third
137:37 - but let's add a third body
137:41 - let me see what simon says oh
137:44 - yeah um
137:51 - now i mentioned that the two body
137:52 - problem is a solved problem the
137:55 - three-body problem is not a solved one
137:58 - we could approximate the actual motion
138:02 - we could approximate
138:04 - we could
138:06 - approximate the motion of three bodies
138:09 - using sophisticated methods of
138:11 - integration let's see how close we get
138:13 - just with my examples right here
138:25 - i'm going to add a second a third body
138:28 - just in the center
138:32 - and i'm going to give it no velocity
138:34 - just for the moment
138:36 - so and it's not it's not participating
138:39 - in this at all now what i need to do is
138:42 - i need to say okay zero attracts one
138:45 - zero attracts two
138:50 - one attract zero and two
138:57 - and two attracts
139:00 - one and two one zero and one
139:08 - amazingly the body in the center is not
139:11 - moving
139:12 - because
139:13 - its attraction forces are
139:16 - perfectly balanced between those two
139:18 - particles on the outside that's kind of
139:20 - unbelievable that's really cool
139:24 - i'm not i don't know what initial
139:25 - velocity to give it
139:27 - let's just push it slightly to the left
140:01 - one thing that i might suggest just to
140:03 - play with different sort of visual ideas
140:05 - is drawing a line between all of them
140:07 - instead of drawing the actual particles
140:09 - themselves
140:11 - and
140:12 - all
140:13 - well actually let me not mention that
140:14 - right now i
140:16 - so this is not sustainable right if i
140:17 - want to start having like more
140:20 - four four
140:22 - so this is not super sustainable if i
140:23 - want to have four movers five movers i
140:26 - can't keep individually assigning which
140:28 - ones attract the other ones so but i can
140:31 - write a loop that handles this
140:35 - now i have a loop down here to update
140:38 - and show all the different movers i want
140:40 - to keep the force calculations in a
140:42 - separate loop
140:51 - but i need a nested one
141:07 - this loop now it's not behaving the same
141:09 - way and i'll get to why in a second but
141:11 - this nested loop is doing exactly what
141:14 - this says start with mover zero and have
141:16 - it attract one and two then go to mover
141:18 - one have it retract zero two then two
141:21 - zero and one but there is a bit of a
141:23 - problem because every mover attracting
141:26 - every other mover means that the mover
141:29 - will also attract itself because it is
141:31 - another mover in the array so one way
141:34 - that i could approach this is by just
141:35 - saying as long as mover is not equal to
141:38 - other and this is checking if two
141:41 - objects you can check if they're equal
141:43 - meaning they're the same data in memory
141:46 - of the computer that's the same object
141:49 - then
141:51 - this should now be exactly what i had
141:53 - before only it's not because
141:56 - i have it twice so i could delete this
141:58 - now
142:00 - and we should now be seeing exactly the
142:03 - pattern of motion of these
142:06 - there's probably a lot of things you
142:07 - could try doing
142:09 - in terms of how you visualize this one
142:11 - idea would be to connect them with lines
142:39 - so i'm no longer drawing the dots only
142:41 - the lines this doesn't look like much
142:43 - yet but i have a feeling once
142:45 - the three start to move a bit more
142:47 - chaotically in relation to each other
142:50 - we'll see what we get here
142:53 - i'm curious just what happens if i um
142:58 - let's if i do four movers and kind of
143:01 - put them in a like a bit of a diamond
143:03 - pattern
143:17 - and
143:38 - i don't know what i expected to get but
143:40 - i'm quite pleased with these interesting
143:41 - results and i think there's a lot for
143:43 - you to sort of try and continue playing
143:45 - with
143:48 - just out of curiosity let me go back to
143:52 - making them random
144:24 - so we can see with them random i'm
144:26 - getting quite an unstable chaotic system
144:28 - i i'm actually quite surprised how much
144:30 - it's staying within the canvas in my
144:32 - experience with doing this it's usually
144:34 - just going to kind of go crazy and fly
144:36 - off the handle but you can see
144:39 - but i think what i'm trying to emphasize
144:41 - here is that by thinking about the
144:43 - initial starting conditions of the
144:45 - system the results that you get might
144:47 - have some
144:48 - symmetry or sort of character to them
144:51 - that you could really um
144:56 - that you could take advantage of for a
144:57 - particular kind of design and there it's
145:00 - off and running
145:08 - um okay
145:14 - so let me think about though how could i
145:17 - achieve something like what i started
145:20 - with but not have to individually assign
145:23 - all of the locations
145:27 - oh i want to use polar coordinates here
145:29 - but um
145:32 - that's not something that
145:35 - um
145:36 - i could i could give them random
145:37 - locations though okay that's what i'm
145:38 - gonna do
145:39 - um
145:44 - well one way to do that would be to
145:46 - give all the x y locations as randomly
145:50 - around the perimeter of a circle if you
145:52 - remember in my first videos about
145:55 - picking random vectors i did something
145:56 - exactly like that
146:06 - let's have the mass be consistent
146:08 - between them all just for right now
146:11 - and i'm going to have a position
146:22 - so basically i'm picking a random vector
146:26 - i'm stretching it out by a hundred and
146:28 - then i'm adding the center of the canvas
146:31 - so that it's um
146:34 - so that its location is relative to that
146:38 - i'm going to take out the line for a
146:39 - second and just
146:41 - show the dots
146:50 - add the position
146:59 - let's not
147:03 - i don't let's not update the locations
147:05 - for a second
147:07 - all right so that's not very many of
147:08 - them right i should have like arranged
147:11 - them spaced out perfectly around the
147:13 - circle
147:16 - but let's do 50 of them
147:19 - so what happens if i arrange all the
147:21 - particles
147:22 - uh this way
147:25 - and what if
147:27 - their
147:28 - velocity hmm
147:30 - well let's just see what happens with a
147:32 - random velocity
147:40 - right it's kind of going out of control
147:44 - let's reduce the mass by quite a bit
147:53 - chaos ensues
148:01 - i don't know if i really like this
148:02 - result oh and it's almost 12 30 but i'm
148:04 - kind of getting to the end of this
148:07 - um
148:13 - okay i have a different idea
148:15 - let's arrange them all in a vertical
148:17 - line
148:35 - um
148:57 - so let's have x be in the center
149:00 - let's arrange them from top to the
149:03 - middle
149:06 - um
149:16 - and let's have their velocities all
149:18 - point in the same direction
149:28 - and i would like the ones that as they
149:31 - get closer to the center to have a
149:32 - higher mass
149:39 - this did not work at all
149:43 - i might have to come back and finish
149:45 - this
149:47 - all right hold on
149:48 - let's let's not update them
149:53 - oh yeah this is what i was trying to do
150:01 - oh i forgot to turn the boiler off hold
150:03 - on
150:17 - let me
150:23 - uh
150:28 - uh
150:32 - yeah um well there's interesting stuff
150:33 - happening in the chat but i will address
150:35 - that in a second i times four
150:37 - yes that's what i want to do
150:39 - um
150:43 - okay i
150:44 - times uh let's see
150:50 - that's fine let's
151:02 - oh i made that so high
151:04 - let's put that
151:05 - let's make this a global vari
151:07 - i'm going to make g a global variable
151:09 - because hold on
151:13 - i'm going to make g a global variable so
151:15 - i can fine tune it a bit more easily
151:17 - it's really just one variable to like
151:19 - increase the overall strength or
151:21 - weakness of the gravitational attraction
151:23 - forces
151:29 - let's make that one
151:33 - i'll make the initial velocity just one
151:40 - oh you know what they should be faster
151:44 - at the top maybe
151:46 - map
151:47 - from i goes from 0 to 50 so they're
151:50 - going at a fast rate to the left there
151:54 - oh i could alternate uh hold on there's
151:56 - so many things i could do with the
151:57 - initial conditions i'm getting kind of
151:59 - obsessed with this
152:00 - uh
152:01 - down to uh zero
152:04 - okay let's
152:07 - just very let's put an update back
152:12 - yeah i was sort of hoping for something
152:13 - more like this it's kind of spinning out
152:15 - of control i want that bottom particle i
152:18 - could also like to be locked in a bit
152:20 - more
152:29 - uh maybe i just don't want so many of
152:31 - them
152:42 - goodbye oh let's have them alternate
152:44 - their directions
152:58 - this is a nice little bit of code using
153:00 - modulo to have every other one go the
153:02 - other direction there we go i was
153:03 - looking for something more like this
153:06 - and
153:07 - let's have it go the whole way down
153:24 - let's increase
153:26 - the strength of gravity a little bit
153:33 - um
153:43 - i'm just going to make them i'm going to
153:44 - make the mass of all them equal
153:48 - and maybe a little bit bigger
153:51 - too big
153:58 - put g back to one
154:02 - okay you can see how you could do this
154:04 - forever
154:09 - let's draw the lines one more time
154:16 - without the circles
154:29 - that's a great suggestion though
154:31 - i could also put you know i already have
154:33 - some artificial limits in the system
154:35 - like if i go here under mover
154:38 - oh sorry
154:41 - where is that
154:45 - if i
154:46 - i already have some artificial limits in
154:48 - the system if i go look at the attract
154:50 - function you'll remember that i used
154:52 - constrain to keep the range of the
154:55 - forces within some reasonable minimum
154:57 - and maximum range
155:01 - i could also do something where i say
155:03 - this dot velocity limit and limit the
155:05 - velocity of some maximum speed
155:08 - which might stabilize the system a bit
155:10 - more
155:11 - not in a necessarily realistic way but
155:13 - in a way that might allow me to sort of
155:15 - explore the kinds of patterns i could
155:17 - make
155:18 - what does this look like without the
155:20 - trails
155:29 - what does this look like with many many
155:31 - many more particles
155:33 - or mover
155:35 - what does it look like with many many
155:36 - more movers
155:45 - whoops
155:46 - oh because my mapping so i need a
155:48 - variable
155:54 - because whenever i'm mapping
155:56 - i
156:00 - whoa
156:01 - ah look at this
156:02 - wait why is it oh what is going on
156:25 - ah the system is collapsing under itself
157:00 - these are the movers we're adding the
157:02 - shakers
157:03 - yeah
157:06 - too powerful let's make it more powerful
157:10 - oh yeah
157:12 - less powerful
157:14 - oh
157:15 - it's stretching out okay so i
157:18 - i've gone off the rails with this a bit
157:21 - i'm way off the train track if you will
157:23 - so i hope that you're getting some ideas
157:25 - here um
157:38 - i'm trying to think of
157:41 - how i want to end this
157:45 - i kind of wanted to have them swirling
157:47 - around themselves so the circle was
157:49 - actually kind of better
157:50 - but
157:52 - um
157:55 - whoa
158:03 - i can't stop as my problem
158:37 - uh
158:49 - i'm trying to think like is there like
158:50 - an interesting place to end this
158:53 - i might have to come back and redo the
158:55 - end
158:59 - like play around with this more and like
159:01 - come to some sort of
159:04 - interesting conclusion
159:11 - when i added the speed limiter yeah
159:13 - that's it that's where it started
159:14 - collapsing that's a good point
159:18 - um
159:23 - add a force along radius of orbit to
159:25 - each other
159:26 - do colors
159:29 - yeah i mean the reason why i wasn't
159:31 - doing polar coordinates later is is
159:33 - because
159:35 - i
159:36 - um
159:37 - that's like chapter three and i didn't
159:39 - want to like introduce that here
159:41 - um maybe i'll mention that
159:46 - i gotta wrap this up though
159:49 - so i can't stop playing with this i have
159:51 - a um i have a feeling if you think about
159:54 - the initial conditions you know one
159:56 - thing i avoided you doing here was using
159:58 - polar coordinates because that's
159:59 - actually something that's part of
160:00 - chapter three so you might look ahead at
160:02 - that video then you could arrange all
160:04 - these movers in along uh
160:07 - then you could arrange all these movers
160:08 - in maybe starting a spiral pattern and
160:10 - some type of circular pattern i'll try
160:12 - to show you some examples of how that
160:13 - might look but really if you add color
160:16 - if you think about different shapes the
160:17 - number of movers
160:19 - there's a lot of possibilities here i
160:21 - should mention that once you start to
160:23 - increase this total
160:26 - for example if i put this total at 500
160:30 - um the f i'm not even getting the first
160:32 - frame
160:34 - because the amount of drawing is way too
160:37 - extensive let me see if i can hit stop
160:39 - here i haven't crashed everything too
160:42 - horribly
160:45 - come on stop
160:54 - i want to
160:58 - stop recording and start recording again
161:00 - um
161:02 - come on i hope i saved this
161:06 - i can always recreate it
161:09 - stop
161:10 - don't go to auto refresh 500 was way too
161:12 - much
161:13 - oh wait there we go i stopped it come on
161:16 - come back to me browser come back to me
161:18 - browser
161:21 - so that was so extreme i think also
161:22 - drawing uh 500 times 500 lines was crazy
161:29 - um wait wait i think it's going to come
161:31 - back
161:33 - um there we go i got it back no
161:37 - what i wanted to emphasize was how just
161:40 - doing the force calculations of 500
161:42 - particles against all other 500 is
161:45 - rather extreme
161:49 - no wait wait it's gonna come back
161:58 - all right i'm now i'm now i'm no longer
162:00 - i can't be patient anymore i'm
162:01 - refreshing hold on
162:03 - let's just find out like
162:05 - oh good
162:09 - no no no no we're in bad shape here
162:16 - no no
162:17 - where did i last save it
162:20 - i can't tell if this is what i
162:25 - yeah no this is what i last saved it as
162:27 - right
162:28 - so we're okay let's make this back five
162:30 - let me just see
162:31 - oh yeah we're good we're good we're good
162:34 - also i got it back
162:42 - but even without drawing the lines
162:47 - and just drawing them as dots
162:52 - let me put it at 100 to be a bit more
162:53 - reasonable
162:55 - like this works of course they all
162:57 - collapse under each other because my
162:58 - initial conditions aren't that
162:59 - interesting
163:02 - let me put it at 500
163:06 - now this is running slow not just
163:08 - because of the drawing
163:17 - because if i comment out the forces
163:19 - you can see that the frame rate is fine
163:22 - what is incredibly slow about this
163:30 - is the n
163:33 - is the n squared
163:35 - i
163:36 - is the uh is the is the order
163:40 - is the efficiency
163:43 - what's incredibly slow about this is the
163:46 - n squared efficiency of the algorithm
163:48 - where every single
163:50 - mover needs to apply a force to every
163:53 - other mover
163:54 - 100 times 100 that's 10 000 computations
163:58 - but if we were to optimize this using a
164:01 - quad tree and the sort of barnes hut
164:03 - algorithm which i'll provide links in
164:06 - the description with references for that
164:07 - including my quad tree video we could
164:10 - reduce the complexity there enormously
164:12 - to be able to make this run fairly
164:14 - smoothly
164:19 - um
164:21 - and i think i'm wrapping this up now
164:25 - um
164:38 - i'm just gonna
164:45 - i also want to reference this wonderful
164:47 - paper classification of symmetry groups
164:49 - for planar and body choreographies what
164:52 - this paper shows is that with certain
164:54 - initial starting conditions these
164:56 - beautiful symmetrical orbits these the
164:59 - dance of end bodies if you will that
165:02 - result in these um
165:05 - what this paper shows is that with
165:07 - certain initial conditions for various
165:09 - end body systems these beautiful
165:11 - symmetrical dances occur
165:15 - and there's a wonderful
165:17 - um simulation of the of
165:20 - and there's a wonderful simulation of
165:22 - many of these patterns created by dan
165:24 - greece for that particular paper now
165:27 - i'll note that these simulations are
165:30 - mapping the ex
165:31 - that these simulations are running i'll
165:34 - note that these simulations are running
165:36 - through the trajectories based on um
165:42 - let's i don't know how to say this
165:44 - i'll note that these
165:47 - i'll note that these simulations are
165:49 - running through the trajectories based
165:51 - on the mathematical equations and not
165:54 - running through an actual physics
165:55 - simulation but i've you know it's an
165:58 - amazing sort of stretch goal here maybe
166:00 - i could do this someday maybe you're
166:01 - going to be inspired to try this is
166:03 - could you look through this paper find
166:05 - some of these initial conditions and see
166:06 - how closely you can match different
166:09 - kinds of these um beautiful um dances
166:14 - let's try six on a square
166:16 - oh i've got to try these
166:19 - i have a whole project now to work on i
166:20 - don't maybe this will come back in
166:22 - another video sometime
166:25 - all right
166:26 - so this wraps up chapter two of the
166:28 - nature of code uh you can move right on
166:30 - into chapter three a lot of the
166:33 - aspects of chapter three in terms of
166:34 - looking at angles and rotations and
166:36 - orbital motion could really be applied
166:38 - to this particular visualization if you
166:40 - make something from this video check the
166:42 - link in the video description it'll take
166:43 - you to a website where you can add a
166:45 - version of it and i would love to see it
166:47 - thanks for watching and i'll see you
166:50 - sometime soon on the coding train
166:51 - goodbye
166:53 - okay
166:55 - um
167:01 - um
167:04 - um yes i said don't worry chad i'll be
167:07 - done in five minutes an hour ago okay i
167:09 - have to go i have a meeting in 15
167:10 - minutes 15 minutes to walk the dog eat
167:12 - lunch thank you all for tuning in i wish
167:14 - i could stay and like answer some
167:16 - questions oh i got to spin the wheel i
167:18 - got to spin the wheel hold on
167:21 - hold on
167:23 - you can't not have that maybe i need to
167:24 - do a separate twitch stream since i've
167:26 - been doing that on twitch
167:28 - um
167:29 - remind me later my goodness
167:38 - uh
167:39 - oh boy please
167:43 - no
167:45 - please history
167:47 - have the
167:48 - randomizer in it let's see show full
167:50 - history
167:52 - um
167:53 - local
167:54 - ah why why
167:59 - oh wait i did it this
168:00 - yeah uh
168:02 - no no no
168:04 - yeah but i want the specific page i went
168:06 - to oh it's there beautiful just wanted
168:09 - to show you okay so i could remove the
168:10 - end body problem
168:13 - i could remove the ulam spiral
168:18 - and in theory now i'm about to spin
168:23 - this wheel
168:24 - to pick
168:25 - the next thing i'm going to do let's see
168:27 - what on here do i really not want to do
168:29 - oh and i wanted to add the kerningsburg
168:32 - bridge but i guess i'll have to add this
168:33 - i'm going to remind me that another time
168:36 - can i add that easily not right now i
168:38 - don't have a system for adding something
168:40 - um
168:41 - all right geez
168:43 - i don't know what i want to come up here
168:46 - all right here we go
169:02 - i can't look
169:05 - oh it's totally gonna land on the slide
169:07 - puzzle solver why does it always land on
169:09 - the slide puzzle oh it's going to
169:10 - falling sand is it going to hit mandle
169:11 - bulb oh mandelball will be exciting keep
169:14 - going come on mandelbaum
169:17 - okay that's awesome oh my god the mantle
169:20 - bulb is really hard i don't have to just
169:21 - do it as a point cloud i hope everybody
169:23 - will allow me to just do the mandelbulb
169:26 - just as a point cloud but that'll be the
169:27 - next coding challenge i don't know what
169:29 - i'm going to record that because um i
169:32 - might not be able to stream next friday
169:34 - but we'll see
169:37 - all right everybody i gotta go i'm gonna
169:39 - play this play you out thank you um
169:41 - just a quick uh thank you for uh
169:43 - brilliant for sponsoring today's live
169:45 - stream and i'm going to go to this uh
169:48 - goodbye music and uh just sort of race
169:51 - on out of here i'll take a peek at the
169:52 - chat if anybody has any really important
169:54 - things i want to mention or ask about
169:56 - but i will see you all soon
169:58 - as always i always forget that this stop
169:59 - this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna
170:01 - do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this
170:04 - this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna
170:06 - do this
170:14 - [Music]
170:46 - this dot
170:48 - [Music]
171:01 - this dot song never forget this dot
171:16 - i'm gonna say once again here we go
171:47 - autotune and the internet will fix that
171:49 - for me
171:59 - coordinate song
172:05 - it's the polar cartesian coordinate song
172:09 - it's the polar cartesian coordinate song
172:17 - [Music]
173:14 - you

Cleaned transcript:

do do check one two here comes my mic uh let me know how the audio is over here oh double audio that could very well be happening yeah i'm uh uh why would that be happening well i'm coming on in a moment hopefully you're hearing my voice just once at least hello everybody good morning happy coding train on youtube live stream my name is dan i will be your host for today on this approximately two hour live stream with a bit of a break in the middle i'm just looking over here to see that i see green bars on my audio i see a preview image of myself on a little monitor in front of me this means i see a green light on open broadcast studio that me this means that everything is working well and i am coming to you live from the hudson valley of new york it's a warm day outside but the temperature is dropping i have sorted out the heating in this garage space so i'm quite comfortable right now but i have disabled and turned off and shut everything down so hopefully there will be no noise interruptions for today now before i get started with my list of things to cover today on this highly organized episode of the coding train let me take a moment to thank today's sponsor i hope this works brilliant do you like learning are you watching the coding train because you like computer science and algorithms and math and fractals and all sorts of fun stuff well watching videos and reading essays and books and text is one way to learn and i hope that you enjoy my videos but really if you want to really dive in and learn i might suggest that you check out brilliant it is full of interactive lessons around all of the kind of concepts and topics i talk about on the coding train in the middle of today's live stream i will come back and look at some of their courses and maybe try my hand at an exercise or two but you can sign up for free right now at brilliant.org codingtrain it lets them know that you found brilliant from me dan the coding train and they go wow dan recommended us and look all of that stuff um and then of course if you would like to unlock all of their premium features and courses you could do so and you'll get 20 off through that link for the first 200 people who sign up all right moving along here uh nope this is still the right button um um what's happening so first of all you might be wondering and i'm on item number item number two i said brilliant was item number one i do number two i'm on i'm on it says twitch so let me talk about that and i'm gonna take a peek at the chat here um okay uh do you read the comments sort of sometimes maybe arbitrarily if you see me looking this way it means i'm reading the chat i also actually have the chat over here but the font is so incredibly tiny i have to do this and then i have to take my glasses off and look up really close and it says hi dan you're the best i'm learning js thanks to you only ciao from italy ah okay so what's going on with the coding train live streams well i am experimenting with the platform known as twitch i like things that start with the twist sound like tuesday or twen's day today's friday so i've been i had this idea that i was going to stream on twitch on tuesdays and youtube on fridays no alliteration there there's no day of the week that starts with a u is there un saturday you use you today you today today is due today youtube bidet streaming no this is not going anywhere um i don't know i i'm 2022 is a new year for me because i have sabbatical from teaching and so i'm focusing on some new things you might have noticed that uh two coding challenge videos came out um slide puzzle and ascii to kind of like an image to ascii coding challenge which if you haven't watched please take a look at it lots of people are watching it it's one of my most uh sort of like immediately popular videos i mean it's all relative what's popular not popular on youtube but for me it's off the charts in terms of my sort of recent string of videos um and i've got another one which is coming out hopefully tomorrow because i released the ascii one saturday at about 11 a.m ish eastern i'm gonna try to do the same tomorrow and i'm going to talk a little bit about what's in that video tomorrow coming so i'm trying to get back to my roots of a weekly coding challenge video for 2022 um because i have a more a bit of more of elaborate production process if you watched that ascii coding challenge there's a lot more editing and additional graphics and things so um some bells and whistles literal bells and whistles are not literal because they're like sound effect bells anyway this is not the point um so i'm i was sort of experimenting with the idea of having sort of weekly edited videos on youtube openended live streams on twitch but i'm still gonna stream on youtube right now at least because i'm trying both platforms but um let me at least alert you to if you want to kind of follow me everywhere which i'm not suggesting you need to do by any means whatsoever let me at least um pull this up uh this is the twitch channel uh twitch.tv codingtrain a choo choo choo choo was taken i believe as well as coding train so i put them up it's not a portmanteau exactly but uh it's two words just smooshed together coding train choo choo if you have an idea for a a available name that i could take that's better than this uh feel free to let me know um you can see some recent broadcasts both of the um live streams i'm sorry both of the coding challenges the ascii one and the prime spiral were both recorded on twitch and then if you're looking for the archives i didn't think it made sense to just like reupload them to this channel obviously this live stream on youtube will live on this channel but if you're looking for coding train twitch i just made a new channel on youtube codingtrain twitch archive it doesn't even show up on google no oh no codingtrain here it is oh no here it is here it is this is a video from it there we go uh coding train twitch archive uh here here somebody can put this into the chat uh that's the just write that um channel down i guess i could give myself one of those vanity urls at some point but you can see the live the recent live streams on twitch are all here for you to go back and look at if you want to kind of catch up with that let me see here um if anything in the chat that i want to refer to youtube's day oh joseph suggest youtube's day the thing is i i i i got to stick to my list but um but just bear but but but indulge me for a moment um which is that one of the things that i have absolutely learned at the start of this year with my sabbatical is that teaching is not ultimately the impediment to me um really producing uh sort of regularly scheduled regular uh uh um frequent content on youtube there are lots of other things life gets in the way and i have other projects and initiatives that i'm working on so i'm not uh able to just suddenly like dive in in the way that i might have thought but i am getting these coding challenges out and i really want to use 2022 to experiment and sort of find the right balance between the different things that i'm doing with what i assume will be a return to teaching in 2023 although you never know never say never the sky's the limit with this youtube thing it's a little bit niche the creative coding tutorial stuff but you know you never know um and so for right now what i am hoping to focus on at least immediately is getting these kind of like fun short and short being like 20 to 30 minute coding challenges videos out i want to say every week but i think three per month is maybe a more realistic promise um i have something next anyway so i have some other stuff on my schedule and family commitments and stuff it's going to make the next coding challenge a little bit harder so the other thing that i'll mention where can i find this oh yeah if i go to twitch and i go to i don't really know uh twitch very well uh videos maybe oh no you know what i can just do i can do slash clips that is not how you spell clips coding train choo choo slash clips um so one of the things that i'm doing is that i and you can see that it's clipped like at the end so um i'm kind of trying to develop this rhythm where i record a coding challenge uh and then after i do that i spin a wheel i mean i've kind of done this before this might not be totally new to you but i'm trying to formalize this a bit more of ideas that i feel like will fit well into the format um and you can see this clip here um let's see if the audio comes through yeah i just did the ulan spiral recorded today's coding challenge and now i'm spinning the wheel for the next one which i will record next friday although i might have a conflict next friday we shall see sometime next week what are we going to get i do not have a conflict next friday because i'm here no keep going keep going keep going oh no no no and you'll see here that where we landed last week was the end body problem thus the title of today's stream the end body problem and i i so my process is and you'll see this in the prime spiral video like when i begin that coding challenge i have a pretty good sense in my head of what the prime spiral is because before i recorded that i you know read the wikipedia page and did a little research on it like very sort of perfunctory and i was kind of aware of what it was before also um but i hadn't programmed it before which i think really is important because as you'll see what is that sound i think it's just the wind but as you'll see i get stuck um a tree came down outside last night it's been very windy here but that was not a tree falling down um as you'll see in the video that comes out tomorrow please watch it when it comes out tomorrow if you don't mind or a monday enjoy your weekend don't watch youtube videos about coding on the weekend if that's not your thing um if you're watching this right now to be honest it probably is your thing um oh but i get stuck and confused quite a bit and make lots of mistakes and i think that's sort of the uh you know dare i say charm but more that what's important for me to communicate is show that this is the process getting stuck struggling trying to figure it out and uh you know i can't remember who suggested this so apologize someone in the discord suggested that i could do like a yearend wrapup and rate all my counting coding challenges from gravy train or from train wreck all the way to gravy train that one was probably in the middle it wasn't definitely wasn't a train wreck because i successfully solved it at the end probably if i would like try to think of the train wreck ones um that fluid simulation thing that i did that i really didn't understand and i was just trying to like type out formulas from a paper that was kind of nuts um so i'm just taking a picture of that so that's why the end body problem hits here so let me come back to that because i am going down my list i talked about twitch so um the other thing that i'm working on is i will soon be probably next week or you know march first maybe let's just put a date on it i will be putting out a big survey oh i don't know biggest right word i'll be putting out a regularly sized survey for the coding train viewers and community it's going to have lots of questions about what videos you like what what do you like about the live streams what you don't like i'm really trying to pare down and focus on what i think is not just like what is most popular with the audience so i'm not just going to like do uh you know sort of go in the i try to fight against the urge to just go in the direction of clicks although i can't help myself most of the time um but i want to hear from you and kind of figure out what makes the most sense and whether you prefer twitch or youtube for the live streams do you like the coding challenges do you like the tutorial videos somebody in the chat earlier said um and steve parker is asking let's see if this button works did not work i have a button on my stream deck that's supposed to post a link to the discord in the chat it doesn't it's just slash thecodingtrain.com or discord dot gg slash coding train those will take you to the coding train discord um you can barely hear me turn up your volume all right mike gained is a tad low i see that i worry because i really hate it when it's speaking so here's the deal people i will gladly turn up my by the way i ordered a new mic this is like a pretty old lab and i was having all sorts of interference that i ordered a higher quality one i need to do a lot of sound proofing in here still because it is quite echoey i don't know if you can hear that um so sound will be different after today's stream but i will turn the volume up for all of you i'm doing that right now i turned up the gain here so um but i would really like you to let me know if if any distortion or peaking happens it's like just a pet peeve of mine it really bothers me doesn't really it's not so great to like have it so low that we don't hear that because then anyway but hopefully that helps so um somebody in the chat it was a while ago and i filed this in the back of my brain briefly asked about like oh what about a series about processing for the pie so i would like to get back and today is a little toe dip into that i would like to get back to recording sort of more tutorial series that are like chunks of videos that are sequins that build upon each other and i think where i'm landing is i'm going to do much less production value on those and by production value image image and sound is kind of the same across the board but in terms of the amount of editing and additional animation i'm kind of leaving those for the coding challenge videos and especially videos that are have the potential to be more evergreen because for example i put a lot of effort into those discord bot tutorials that i made and they're basically completely irrelevant because discord updated their api uh anyway and i also just want to be able to make those faster so i hope to be getting uh some clipping now okay so just gonna turn it down a tiny bit there is a slight buzz i should so hope i'm going to ask about that in a second but um i um oh my goodness pi day is coming up holy okay adding this to my list because i actually am going i will be traveling i have done so little traveling in a few years but i think that i have a chance to do some in march um and i will be doing some traveling um uh i will be away on pi day so there will not be almost definitely not be a pi day live stream but i should prepare a coding challenge in advance of that to release on pi day and i better record that i'm going to have to i have to add just do a wheel spin of pi day ideas just for pi day so i i'm i'm in the market i have no idea for what i plan to do for pi day this year so i'm in the market for something usually i just take something that like stand up math or three blue one brown or some other youtube channel did years ago i'm like let me make my own version of that but uh um yeah pi day on a train i will not be on a train like i i i my preferred method it will come as no surprise to you of travellers train i really um uh my dream actually i would really like to go to japan this summer i'm just putting that out into the universe if anyone wants to invite me to anything um and i really want to go on the trains in japan i've never been to japan um got some wonderful trains in europe that i've been on mwah oh i love that taiji uh is that still like is that a a relevant uh uh a timely reference or it's like not anything anybody rides or says anymore okay be time traveling what is the keyboard shortcut for commenting out multiple lines at once uh command slash i believe uh all right so where are we on my list the survey so the survey will be coming out be on the lookout for that please fill it up i'm trying to think of what a good incentive will be i mean the only thing that we came up with so far as like uh uh we'll pick some random people filled out the survey to send them coding train stickers but if there's something you would like um you know a shout out a little video hello i don't know i'm happy to do any of those things i'm getting a text message here i don't know what that is um okay um all right so hmm looking at my list and i'm looking at the time um brandon asks do you want to derive pi or just do something fun with pi so yes to i want to do something fun with pi now deriving pi could be doing something fun with pi so it just it uh um it's important to me all right so it's not a pi day video if it doesn't sort of center around the number pi in some way um and i did do some i've done videos on estimating the value of pi through random chance and various kinds of things i've done like the leibniz sequence and some other like formula so you can look back and find some of the ones that i've done but something that has a good visual to it i think is always a nice pretty pattern uh certainly better than the rer is it is this train chat is this like i need like a sound drop for like hey everybody it's train chat time where we just talk about our favorite trains around the world huh oh i have this dream this other dream so i'm gonna uh just i'm putting this out there i don't maybe i shouldn't talk about the stuff on there i i want to go on a train i think they have these like um i'm basically just i am uh i'm basically just an old person who wants to go on like luxury train rides with they don't have to be luxury i just want them to have beautiful views and landscapes and i think they have some uh beautiful like kind of like tourist train rides i want the equivalent of a cruise that's on a boat but on a train and cruises aren't for me i don't think um i mean i like boats i like water what what am i even talking about right now scotland i hear this is a this is another a little fantasy of mine to go on a beautiful train ride through i don't know the scottish highlands or something is that a thing somebody will tell me um all right so one thing that i want to do is talk about community contributions so first of all i need corey says by the way this is a very relatable comment corey says this is oh i have a space heater under me which is not on but i keep kicking it um lol this is so strange i'm used to watching you at 2x speed yes apologies this probably sounds like i'm speaking like this to you my children's favorite pastime although we haven't done this in quite a while is to take my videos and put them on like 0.25 or 0.5 x because they think i sound ridiculous so um hogwarts train in scotland oh boy my my uh little harry potter fan uh super fans would uh in my household would love that uh train from spain to turkey i took a beautiful train in norway it was from oslo to addison i believe i think that was the route it was absolutely incredible um okay um have a little sip of my a coffee drink train to the highlands is my travel dream says chris sears i want to go to lockdesk so i actually have been to loch ness uh um i was in scotland once and uh it was that was that was an amazing trip there were no trains involved in that trip train from this is awesome these like uh these train recommendations i mean if i could go on like a world tour this is okay if i could just go on like a world tour of trains and like do coding videos while i'm on the train i mean ah that's what i should have been doing on sabbatical i have children who need to be driven to school and they need breakfast made for them so i can't just go travel the world on trains for the whole year i mean maybe one maybe you want to maybe this is more of a like a retirement or when they when they're off on their own if they ever move out and escape the nest then i could do that if you came to india check out our local trains in mumbai i would love to visit india uh there's a train that goes all the way across canada welcome to i really need okay hold on i think i got it uh where is it hold on just give me a minute here i'm looking at my sound board uh no no scary music that's not the train sound effect i had a whole like i guess i never when i redid the studio i never brought the my train sound effects here laughing no all right sorry i was gonna uh i was gonna i don't know what i was gonna do but it was gonna be great all right uh all right on to my next item on my list why did my computer go to sleep am i not plugged in no i am plugged in um okay so let's go to the coding train youtube page which i redid a little bit by the way so i guess i'm live streaming right now whoa there's a lot of people watching maybe i should stick to streaming on youtube don't have these numbers on twitch uh um so i i was kind of redoing this home page here to try to make it a little bit like you know start learning here and here are the coding challenges some of the other playlists that i recommend my popular videos why was i going here uploads yes so i want to go to this video and um i want to uh click over here so in every video you will see a link that goes to thecodingtrain.com now i'm a little bit delayed the reason why i'm bringing this up and it's a little bit unfortunate because i would love to be showing you the new website but i'm going to click over to the current existing website the new website will have the same content but as different design and we'll be featuring your work more and we'll even have a probably a different uh a way that you can submit without having to do a github pull request although you could still do that um so this is the coding challenge and if i go here this is here where is it like i'm going to cry uh um sound let's it seems like there haven't been made yet any variations based on this coding challenge by the community yet now first of all that's a very awkward sentence so i will be rewriting all the language on the new website but i'm shocked i'm shocked and dare i say appalled no i'm not appalled that this video which is one of my more popular ones which i think is ripe for you to remix and make your own version of um doesn't have any yet now in fairness this came out a week ago i haven't really been pushing the community contribution thing one thing i would love to hear suggestions for is um how what should i call these so community contributions i don't really like i mean that's what they are literally and i could either that could be a a way that we refer to them but i've got my little notebook here so if you have a good idea like to hear it now by the way i think i'm going to stick with the coding challenges i was going to try to rename them coding journeys everybody suggested coding adventures and i don't know if you're trolling me or not but that's sebastian lags thing and they're amazing i'm not calling by things coding coding journeys is probably a little bit too close to that frankly people had some great ideas like choo choo i don't remember what that one was but um community contributions could they be like uh passenger manifest i don't think that really works i don't know so give me your ideas but please submit them and since we don't have any to feature today i would like to do more of i'm going to be featuring them on the website more prominently so get yours in uh and they'll be on the new website but um what i would like to do is go ahead and look at the comments so i like to um i want to take a little time let's allow nice me whoops it's 10 30. let's try to take something with the word conductor train um uh something about trains contributions contributions is not about so um uh so by the way what is going on with my recommendations today interesting um so oh this is new i have not seen this that's kind of cool now they're supposed to be like little thumbnails there about what's going on i like this little chapters that's cool um so let's take a look at your comments which are mostly about like keeping it coding challenge but there was some oh oh just want to zoom in here a little bit there we go ah i guess i have to go down yeah there we go um let's take a look at um see if there's i know there were some interesting technical questions and things that were pointed out that i can discuss um all i can hear is the hot hot hot chocolate song for polar express i have no idea what that is does it go like this hot hot hot hot chocolate on the train you know back in the day people would make all these remix musical remixes of me doing weird stuff in videos it just doesn't happen anymore did all the talent musically talented viewers go off and become sensations they don't have time anymore all right um all right messed around with the some of the ascii shading characters and found that this combo works great ooh let's try this um so let's go back to uh you know one thing you should know that when you if you're looking for the code and this will be different on the new website but the same stuff will be there if you're looking for the code for any particular video if you find the corresponding page on the website you will see the different ways to view the code here so if i look at i want to look at just the ascii video one so in case you missed this video um you can see what it is and uh i do need to give so it is uh here here we go i am making a sort of like ascii render of myself but i have this variable oh god that is so windy outside so let's try this suggestion and see what we get oh that's cool wow that is wild i love this um yeah not much more to say about but thank you for this excellent suggestion um i mean it's much more like a pixelated version of the image i'm like kind of looking in close but that is really i love that thank you for this um and i'm gonna leave that as a comment i'm gonna go back to where i left the video with this particular um set of characters um let me go back and sort of see the um people are uh edge recognition yeah this would be interesting so one thing that i didn't do with this video that i would love to see if anybody um passenger proposition um one thing that um i didn't what didn't do is if you look at ascii art that people are making very carefully with sort of like hand selection or sort of manual curation of the characters the characters often really have meaning in terms of the contour of the thing that's being drawn um like if i just search like ascii cat i'm sure you know we would see things like this so this is not at all what i did this would be a fascinating thing to try to do i wonder if there is like a machine learning approach to this where we could train a model to have sort of photographic images and their ascii counterpoints counterparts that would be let me write that down ascii art ml model projects that i will never get to goes on the list here um so i didn't do that but i would love to see if anybody has an idea on to how to do that um thank you chris for this very nice feedback um coding challenge coding challenge right so this was pointed out i was very focused on figuring out how to when i'm making this sort of html dom version of the ascii characters how to deal with nonbreaking spaces and i could have just used white space pre as a css property 3d objects ascii style that would be awesome see you could do this you're this is what i want i want all of you to make the things you're suggesting um code stations i like that um okay people are really mostly talking about the name which i really appreciate but part of me wonders if this video is just popular because at the beginning of it i said let me know what you think i should call this series and i'm like flooded with comments about that so like the youtube uh thing the you know the the the uh the wizard behind the curtain at youtube is like oh lots of comments on this video keep suggesting it so i just need to at the beginning of our video be like what do you think of my hair today please let me know in the comments uh locomotive language learning caboose coding coding caboose i like um hey where's the rest of the comments why did it just stop it says 414 530 i wanted there were some really good ones with questions that i wanted to look at i really really should get it together am i already at my 10 minutes to um let me just see uh if i refresh this page if i can if i can scroll down faster yeah okay um yeah they just weren't now they're now they're loading um i can just zoom in there are some interesting questions that i want to take a look at um ah fresh noob hi freshnoob asked could i get some hints for how to have custom running text which forms an image referring to 1057 when you mention writing some poetry yeah so one thing you should realize that i'm doing and this is what chris manning made a nice uh friendly comment about is when i show a additional uh uh thank you yeah so jake i agree like that worked hard on that uh thumbnail oh i didn't work hard and that somehow i i worked hard on trying to ask around get a lot of advice and get help with the thumbnail um so um apprecia yeah um i'm sorry i lost sort by newest okay yeah there's too much stuff going on i had a thought that i wanted to talk about when ever i show an additional demonstration in the video even if i haven't coded it you can find that example here also included on the webpage so for clues about how to do that i can show you this one which is actually um since this is a sort of an ascii version of my dog gloria i know this is i don't know if this is easier for you to see it's very it's bright in here i just need to turn my monitor brightness up i don't think that changes anything for what you're seeing um i think this is like from um ah why am i blanking on the name of the book by jack london with the wolf in it did i forget to eat breakfast again today this is what happens when i don't eat breakfast like things that i know about and that i've read in my life but anyway i just pulled something from public domain project gutenberg um so this is not using the specific characters to generate a brightness in fact there's lots of extra spaces in here that make it uh that add additional noise but i'm just coloring the characters but you can see i'm walking through them so the idea here is that if i were to go to here you can see um you can see the text from the book and then in the code itself i'm loading the full text i called it gloria.txt call of the wild thank you and then uh i am just getting a character from that text but also cycling through them so there's this appearance of motion so if you were curious about that okay so uh thank you for that question i think i'm at 10 40. let me just scroll through and see if i can get one more um um question that i thought so i really should go through these in advance and prepare which ones i want to talk about um oh yeah this is the one this is actually a really important one i should answer this right now but um maybe somebody can reply so the density array seems wrong there are bright characters at one end and dark characters are the other but in the middle it's just all the numbers in numerical order which i highly doubt is also the order of density so let's address this really good point and i wish i had sort of thought to mention this or look at this in more detail in the video so this one the current one that i'm using by my eye and i didn't do a proper calculation here these characters are actually ordered from darkest and there's many many many many many blank spaces for sort of like thresholding any brightness below a certain value and then brighter brighter brighter more and more like characters now this one if i switch back to this one and unfortunately this is in the wrong order now also so it is uh this is inverted but you get the idea um it is very true that this albeit um you know these characters over on this side you can see are have fewer and fewer pixels if you will ramping up to full of pixels over here the numbers are just arbitrarily in order and at a glance probably seven is a darker represents a darker pixel versus like zero so um i didn't think about this i just kind of tossed this in there and it comes from the uh ascii playground uh which is from um andreas gishens and i apologies for maybe um mispronouncing the name i made several mistakes one is when i was looking at this quickly i just assumed that's a shader you know i just throw export function main out of the corner of my eye and i was like that's shader code oh thank you herobrine very kind of you um exploring tracks that's interesting um so this is not this is just plain javascript it's just what i'm doing um and we're pulling characters from this density array and so i assume that um andreas who goes by erta which i now know is the order of keys on the keyboard e r t d f g c v b um is just using that character because it creates nice patterns and there's something quite lovely about seeing the numbers i think in order i'm sorry that this is might be very like flickery to you um so i just kind of lifted this as a nice starting set of characters but i think the decision is made not just purely out of brightness for these sort of more abstract ascii visualizations um this is more and i and i probably if i'm really trying to authentically match the image i would want to be more um precise about the which characters i choose and in what order and i have seen i believe in the processing um ascii video let's see if uh well here's the get i don't know if there's a better place for me to find this example but this is a um this is an example from the processing um ide and you can see this is like uh a ton of more characters and probably i'm assuming yeah sorted according to their visual density so i don't know ben fry made this ring the bell for ben frye um i'm assuming that ben did some like you know phd level like hyper sophisticated analysis of these letter forms um and i could copy paste that into my code you could take a look at this one lots of stuff to explore all right so that's so let me just give you a little pitch here to encourage you uh on the one hand i'm encouraging you to make your own to watch this video if you haven't let me know what you think do you appreciate all the extra bells and whistles bells and whistles or would you rather me just make more videos without any editing blah blah blah and oh the ascii fluid simulation that josh davis in the chat is mentioning is chef's kiss i have seen that um so uh make your own version uh watch the video make your own version but even better uh the video that's coming out tomorrow the prime spiral video it will definitely be out by monday hopefully tomorrow youtube members twitch subscribers github sponsors patrons of all these different ways you can sign up for the sort of supporter community um i do share earlier versions of the videos you're not missing anything if you're don't worry the video comes out you see it a day later but i will hopefully be sharing that with you all of you a little bit early at least for like feedback um and mark boots is writing it depends on the font family too i guess and that's absolutely true so please watch that prime spiral video comment on it let me know what you think about it and make your own version of it and share it with me on the website social media also also works well tag the coding train on twitter or the.coding.train on instagram all that jazz okay going back to my list ah so i mentioned the prime spiral let me let me just show you give you a little sneak peek here of just the code itself um let me open up the i think just this one everybody which wish chris a happy birthday was chris's 50th birthday not chris manning in the chat no idea what chris manning's age is a friend of mine named chris i'm sure he'll appreciate i made a little p5 sketch here i'll show it to you uh uh uh since it popped up i think people are gonna ask uh here we go everybody wish chris the happiest birthday it was a while ago now but uh okay i don't think chris is watching the chris associated with this video okay let me go back to the spiral so this is the ulam spiral or the prime spiral um what is happening is i am counting numbers from one to the theoretically infinity obviously i have only a certain amount of space on the screen and when it is a prime number i am marking it with a dot uh this was um this idea comes from the mathematician stanislav ulam i talk about a little bit about the history of this in the video program this i have a lot of trouble getting the spiral to work correctly so the video that comes out tomorrow will show you how to do this program showcase station all right this i'm really liking showcase station where am i going to write this showcase station all right that so far is the winner i like everyone's saying um so i until i hear something better uh forevermore corey james cooper when i say like i forgot who suggested this it was you you could refer back to this clip clip it if this was a twitch stream you could clip it thank you i mean we might not call it that there's a lot of people gonna weigh in other ideas no promises but that's right now the winning suggestion as far as i'm concerned all right um so now you've seen the prime spiral i do have some additional examples that i need to make still for the video i will probably just do those on my own later today in my copious amounts of free time but i sort of had hoped to maybe do those today but i don't think that i can so i we're about to get to uh okay so let me get to my next topic then i'm going to take a short break and then i'll have the last hour hopefully for going through and talking about the end body simulation spinning the wheel for the next topic and um pi day i was about to like um and oh a pie no pi day isn't a thing i just you can clip on youtube also how did you do the hearts on the birthday sketch asks kathy mcginnis so the hearts are if you look for my a fireworks coding challenge which is quite an uh a one from quite a while ago from july 2nd uh 2016. let's see if we go here and i think actually uh oh no i i really don't think that i took this from this let's take a look i think i did this also in in parallel but let's take a look yeah this looks different good okay so i'm glad to see that this looks sufficiently different that i clearly did the same it's a different slightly different heartshaped uh that i clearly didn't just coplift this code um but um i remember that david snyder made a version i don't see it here look at this all right can we all just celebrate for a moment i don't know when this was submitted and maybe caitlyn is you know 15 or 16 now caitlyn using her dad's github account which is good because i don't believe you can have your own account until you're at least 13. um and totally uh it's three cheers for both caitlyn and her dad uh let's take a look at these rainbow fireworks oh look at that oh and they go kind of like off to the side which is way where my fireworks just went right up in the air like they're all going to the right though is it a random trajectory is it always the same oh no it's definitely a random that looks different these are beautiful great job caitlin i hope you're still watching in coding train and coding or maybe if you moved on to something else that's great too that's great nobody needs to spend their life like me just making p5 sketch after p5 sketch after p5 sketch it's okay you can do other things ah all right so the way i did this if i go to the web editor version of the sketch i think i did i think the coding challenge i might have done it here under firework.js let me look um just trying to look for where i create all the particles new particle if this dot exploded where do i make ah here we go so i make new particles there we go i make new particles this is it and the particles right here get a random velocity um let me run this sketch for you and show you uh how this works so this is my origin we could actually this is my original sketch so these just look like um things exploding randomly and there's no pattern here but if i were to take this off and i were to say this dot velocity dot multiply 5 wind you're going to see something different see how they form a perfect circle so the initial velocities of each one of these um fire each one of these particles uh determine like where it kind of like ends up in its trajectory before it begins to fall and fade out so a random vector is any vector along the perimeter of a circle but there's no reason why and i could use the whiteboard let's see if this let me come over here so what's happening is i have a whole bunch of particles that all start from the same point and they pick a random velocity if that random velocity is any direction but the same magnitude those vectors all point out to the perimeter the circumference of a circle so if i just knew a whole lot of vectors for some shape like a heart and then i could pick every firework gets one of these random vectors it's going to explode out into that form and you we could use letter forms um there's so many things we could do beyond just hearts and i i a bunch of people made creative versions of this i remember seeing them i don't know why they're not all on the website maybe the links went dead and we removed them or they weren't shared on the website because this was you know five or six years ago at some point where i did this but there's a lot of fun things and i'd be glad to go through this in more detail at some time but i should get back to my uh list of things all right now uh one thing that i think that i might need to do here i worked very hard on the lighting for this whiteboard and i just realized that i might not have actually focused the camera yeah that's better so good thing i discovered that now and i can come back over here um okay yeah and sit back is saying is is correctly saying like this this code like if i go into my the happy birthday thing let's just find it um if i look at the particles this is the math for a heart pattern it's like this uh trigonometric uh equation and actually heart curve i think i'd uh p5 look at this february 18 2019 the heart curve so if you want to learn about the equation to draw a heart there you go i've got another video for you i've got one for everything except not really but if i live to be a hundred i will get them all eventually all right um uh okay let's see so moving on let me give you an update on the nature of code so slow going so far i'm working with two wonderful nyu students who are helping me with the nature of code project um and i just want to give you an update on that because i know it's of great interest yeah so if you want it okay this is not it igor give me back my url it's not mine it's yours you registered it i don't own it i'm happy you have it nature dash of dash code okay so this is um the collection of repos for the nature of code project um and um the chat is wonderful i wish i could just like read every comment aloud and and reply to them but but know that i'm seeing all your wonderful um comments now um or actually i'm probably not seeing all of your wonderful comments i just saw kathy and abhijits they're great i'll read them i used your heart code to make a valentine's day sketch for my husband i love that and abhijit writes it must feel good when you search something general and google shows your own videos it's a little bit eerie actually the weirdest thing that happens this is this happens to me a lot is like i'm trying to figure out how to do something that i don't know how to do i search and i find like my explanation or my vid like my results are coming up to try to help me but i'm like no those don't help me i made those they don't that's what i'm looking for or weirdly enough they actually do and i just forgot how to do it completely another thing that welcome to my life i'm sure you all needed to know that little tidbit um so i'm actively working on this project one thing i'm just going to just uh um show just really quickly mention is i'm working on a new method to have a draft of the book in notion to make writing a little bit easier this has actually been pioneered by um folks at itp and other books that people are working on it's not my idea and then the the notion project automatically comes back into github as markdown so there's still be an open source like markdown version of the book but when i'm trying to like write something new i don't have to like edit the markdown which could be kind of awkward actually the current book is even worse than that um in the sense that if i go to the content and look at any given chapter it's actually just raw html so right now if i want to like rewrite the book or edit it i've got to be editing this html which is really painful and the thing that i here's my new mantra i have been saying i want to make a second edition of the nature of code for at least five years the book came out in december 2012. i started working on it probably in 2008 which is just insane to me um and it's just never getting done so like uh yes i wanted to have this html system so i could perfectly refine and markup and format everything i ever wanted in this book but printer printer making noise everything's fine but if i'm not getting to rewrite the new version because it's too like much effort and complicated and i've got to like i just need a simpler workflow and i just need to make it happen if this you heard it here well not first because i've been saying this now for the last couple weeks but you heard it here if this nature of code second edition is not out by the 10 year anniversary of the first edition i'm never doing it i'm not doing it it's never going to happen so whatever happens i got to get it done this year i do need time to invest in that so i will apologize if the youtube channel or the twitch streams go dark for a little bit uh at present they don't need to do that and it's still way higher on my priority list which i think is kind of the problem to be frank um although my name is dan um yeah so um and but i would love i people are so interested in helping and i just don't know how to harness that interest and excitement enthusiasm so right now i don't have any calls for help um with the nature of code book but your your support and your enthusiasm goes a long way all right okay it is 11 o'clock i managed to do what i i i said i was not going to keep doing which but i had a list that i went through and these were important pieces of information and announcements and you're all you're all still here most of you some of you hi thank you so i need to take a short break to get some water and before i take my break i would like to tell you once again about it's the olympics so this is my today's sponsor brilliant by the way it's not even a script i like just do this off the cuff but i like to make it sound like a script do you like learning i like learning you like learning too wait are you watching the coding train do you like programming and computer science and math and algorithms and interactivity and visuals and all that stuff oh so do i if you like all that stuff uh you are going to love brilliant um i'm i'm being kind of silly right now but it is really a wonderful uh website and platform to for to continue learning journey uh again like i said this at the top of the stream um videos i hope you enjoy my videos i hope they help you learn and and bring some joy to your day and inspire you um but i do think that watching videos and reading books and by wait we should put reading books probably at the top of the list there before the videos are wonderful things um being able to actually try stuff yourself for me has always been the way uh the path towards understanding and exploration for me and brilliant uh really just has an amazing set of courses and tools and resources with interactive lessons and quizzes and a whole community of people doing this stuff so i'm going to just show you very quickly two of my favorite um courses from brilliant one is the um uh algorithm fundamentals sorry and you can see that like this is basically a wonderful complement and companion to learning to code this is an interactive lesson about doing an insertion sort algorithm and you can move all the pieces around it's pseudo code so you don't need to know a particular programming language but the the the site is just full of these kinds of interactive exercises and lessons that allow you to explore all of your programming wonderful now that that clip ended it was supposed to loop so apologies for my technical mistake there um they also have this wonderful course about neural networks so i you know i spend a lot of time on my channel doing uh videos about machine learning and neural networks and this particular course you can see here you know i i wish that i had in my videos a sort of uh a an interactive explanation and demonstration of how a neural network can recognize handwritten digits um and uh i forgot to turn on looping so you got to come back and see me um so let's go let's go wander over to the uh brilliant website for a minute um and it's going to let's take a look at it um i have been doing the logic course um i was i i um and a bunch of these also this is really one of my favorites i mean the thing about the ones the one thing that i really love about brilliant honestly uh for me personally is i need more ideas for videos and i was just looking at a lesson i forgot which course it's in about the kerninsburg i'm probably saying that bridge the konigsberg bridge problem um which is a wellknown um problem around graph theory and with math so i was like oh i could do that as a coding college the seven bridges of kerningsburg um so uh um there's you know these are the kinds of problems that are really rich and ripe for this so let's take a quick look um i kind of want to go back to this beautiful job oh i love the what is what's infinite data structures i can't pick let's go back to abstract order logic i don't remember actually doing this one i think i might have just started it i didn't really get very far with it let's take a look um the evil core robots continued their physical fitness evaluation but it's day two and they're getting tired their selfreporting of results while still accurate is even spottier based on limited information it's possible to tell exactly how the races ended up there are multiple possible outcomes okay how many different orders could the racers finish the only report that rey finishes ahead of tie so here's a possibility one two three i've definitely got three right so let's think about this if rey is ahead of tie ray cannot be last so re can only be in one of these two spots if rey is in this spot a tie has to be here so there's only one configuration if ray is in this spot there's two configurations because tai and marv could switch so three should be the answer you know brilliant should really include these drum rolls into their website they have wonderful sound effects but i got it right okay so um i hope you can sort of get the idea oh i want to just keep going with this because they're so fun to do but i'm just going to encourage you i'm gonna take a one or two minute break sign up at brilliant.org codingtrain lets them know that you found out about um brilliant from me there's the url on the screen and it's it's free you can sign up for free there is a premium subscription that you can get through that link the first 200 people to do so will get 20 off of that it's also a wonderful gift you can gift a premium subscription to somebody if you don't know what to get them and they love learning um i would certainly suggest that as well um okay so i'm gonna take hopefully just like a two minute break uh uh where you could talk amongst yourselves sign up for brilliant enjoy uh stretch your legs and arms i'm gonna grab a little bit of water um and i will be back within two minutes and we are going to finally if you were here for the end body stuff uh that's what i'm doing from about 11 10 to noon here eastern time i'll be right back so check check making sure my mic is back i i've gone through great lengths some unit multiple in a million different possible ways during this break oh i better come back look at how everybody's leaving all right i have returned it was hopefully less than two minutes or it was probably about two minutes um andrew isaac asked will you be considering approximations like quad trees yes so i'm a little to be honest this is where my list that i made of things to go over today in today's stream kind of falls apart because i don't really have an exact plan here but let me um let me uh give you back let me get myself i was kind of going to organize my tabs and things during the break but um instead i'm just going to do that with you all watching um let me close these out um and i don't need any of these open um and uh okay so let's let's figure out what we're doing here so first so let's start here okay so the idea of the end body problem or maybe a better search for me here would be like an nbody simulation um because there's this really incredible one uh that i love oh it's actually not this one although i'm sure this one is great there's a really all right i'm not gonna i'm not gonna just randomly scroll through wikipedia right now but the idea of an end body problem is let me come back over here and i have to apologize uh those of you have been tuning in on twitch recently you'll know that when i'm over here i can't really see the chat or anything that's going on but hopefully everything looks right um the idea of an end body problem and i wonder if i should be recording this i'm just going to record this just in case hold on ultimately i want to turn this into a tutorial video but i don't know if i feel ready to do that today but just in case i want to use any of this material i have a system by which i can record what i'm doing to disk all the various parts of it so that i can reput it together later all right so um yeah i think i'm going to just allow myself to be very freeform here and not and kind of let you know where my brain is at and we'll see where this leads so if you've been following the nature of code series which i have not continued in quite a while chapter two is all about forces and apologies for the shaky white board um and it starts off by looking at just force equals oops force equals mass times acceleration and how i can translate that into euler integration which is a very fancy sounding name for the code that's in almost every one of my examples that has like velocity add acceleration and then position add velocity so the idea is that we have a body that has a position vector of where it is as well as a velocity there are forces in the system which affect the acceleration which then alters the velocity which then alters the position that's the core idea of the sort of physics simulation behind the nature of code the really limiting factor uh to the sort of like level of sophistication and breadth and depth of what i am able to achieve in those sort of basic examples is really due to this simpler simple integration technique like i'm not really using laws of motion and ordinary differential equations and all those kinds of things that you might find in a physics textbook i want a rapid fast algorithm and uh implementation to make stuff happen so this is what the reason why i gave you all that backstory is because this is a body i'm starting to feel like oh maybe i could actually use this i'm recording it yay this is a body so an n body like a two body let's just talk about like what would be a two body simulation or what is the twobody problem what if i had two bodies what would be the motion of these bodies based on the forces in their environment now but we're talking about a very specific kind of force and the kind of force we're talking about is gravitational attraction the force of gravity equals the universal constant g times the mass of one object times the mass of another object divided by let's call this vector r the magnitude of r squared the distance squared um times the unit vector r and vice versa so this object is attracting this so what would the motion of those bodies be in a two body simulation let's go back to the computer i can sort of take a peek at the chat here for a second this is the beginning stages so if i look for under two body problem we can see uh we could take like the sun and the earth as the examples and you can sort of see there's something very similar going on to my formula here but um um and the two body problem is famously solved uh meaning we could actually calculate precisely the motion of these objects these bodies um and um let's just do like i always see like um i feel like when i was um you know there's always like wonderful blog posts like here we go this is just one that i happened to find we could see somebody made a beautiful kind of simulation showing this sort of solution and mapping out these orbits of the two bodies here so um i ultimately um in if oh sorry let's now let's go to uh the nature of code uh playlist and as you'll see where up where i left off back when i was recording these in april of 2020. oh hey anybody remember april of 2020 i wonder why there were no more videos until january of 2021 and i didn't record this these just finally came out i mean i think i recorded all these in early march and yeah remember that all right but this particular example if i go to it is showing what looks kind of like an end body problem in a way like oh these are celestial bodies kind of orbiting around something it's like oh one if i just had one of these for example um if let's just change it to i'm sorry i'm having trouble with my spacing here when i recorded my last coding challenge i was standing in front of the code too much but i do have more room here so let me space this out a little bit better um i want to just change this to one you can say like oh is this the two body problem uh and if i sort of like were to somehow put in the uh relative masses of the sun and the earth and like an initial velocity would i get something that resembled the earth's orbit and if i drew it with the sort of like sun everything being like relative to the sun's position even if um you know then would i see something so the answer most likely is no because in my uh sorry in all of my examples i am using this highly approximate technique so i would need to have you know really solve in a sort of pure mathematics way the equations of motion to map that precise orbit pattern so that's problem number one problem number two is i'm actually not doing that in this example there is only the force of this pink dot attracting the other circle so there is no mutual attraction one body has exerts a gravitational force on the other the other uh exerts that same gravitational force on the that one body but in the other direction so all of this to say is to say here i am wanting to make a video or a coding challenge or more likely what i think probably makes sense should just be 2.6 like the next video in this sequence what direction do i go in so certainly i absolutely could solve right now for the issue where i wasn't doing both forces so i feel pretty confident because i i've already done this it's actually in the textbook itself i could show you a sort of simulation of this two body problem by giving both uh mutual mutually attracting each other i would not however have solved for optimizing this i think i don't want to go down the road of looking deeper into the mathematical equations a little bit i like to say out of scope as like uh like i don't excuse is the wrong word but like an escape valve for when i'm like i'm just not prepared to do that it doesn't really fit into how i've worked these code examples i'm not i haven't really researched this i just can't like do this off the cuff today i don't feel like but but but really it's just not a scope um so um so that's one direction i could do it wouldn't be so interesting with two bodies but it certainly could be interesting uh with n bodies and in fact i did do that let me show you um let me show you if i go to my and i'm just gonna switch over here for a second i'm gonna go to my twitter for a second because during the month of january there was an initiative and apologies that i don't have to scroll through this for a while um there was an initiative called january which was to do like a sort of creative project every day and that this one was that was the like i did little things like this this was for day 30. organic looking output look using only rectangular shapes flocking simulation so i want to go down and find my um the prompt i did for the day called space there was a day where the prompt was space and i basically took this idea of mutual attraction and actually you can see it here this is a variation of it i did with uh just adding some color so this is an nbody simulation it's basically doing whoops exactly this formula with like zillions of particles it's not really i don't remember how many i used and kind of drawing them with some additive blending giving them an initial state that caused that sort of results in this swirling pattern um but uh i even used somebody had asked about a quad tree i used some but it this was rendering at about like you know a frame per five seconds you know i just didn't do any so i don't know that i could probably do a version of this with like a thousand particles uh we might get somewhere kind of interesting so that's something that i could do and then there's one other thing that i'm kind of intrigued by so if i'm making a list of options there's just option number one is uh add this is probably what i want to do add mutual attraction but keep euler integration that sort of simple thing and then uh two bodies and then go to n bodies and then maybe add quadtree which is actually a there's something called the barnes hut which i have not researched in detail barnes hut did i say barnes nut i think it's barnes hut i don't remember um which is i think just ultimately applying a quad tree to n bodies but maybe it has to do with like adding the forces in each cell of the quad tree or something so it's a slight variation on that i think so this is what i'm thinking of doing the question is is this a coding challenge or is it 2.6 nature of code that's the quest that's question number one another question is is it worth investigating improving the integration and sorry that i'm just kind of not writing this well but i was reading about something called leapfrog integration which is kind of doing sort of like these sort of partial updates multiple times through a given time step um that can maybe make the actual motion a bit more accurate to the true physics i'm not super inclined to do that i feel like that's out of scope but i'm thinking about that and then the other thing the last thing i want to mention before i i don't know what i'm what i'm really doing today ultimately i'm talking this through is what i'm doing and then i come back next week or tomorrow or uh stay an extra little bit of extra time i don't really know um but um there's one other thing i want to mention which is really cool and i i'm not looking at your feedback right now i really want to hear your feedback but um um so um uh where am i oh i'm in the wrong thing okay so i'm gonna do like a quarry three body choreographies i think this will pull up the paper i'm looking for um um look uh dan grease did the visualizations for the paper uh yep this is what i'm looking for um oh so this is actually the visualization i want to find the paper though very briefly um uh antaldi uh uh paper choreographies sorry i really meant to have these things ready to show you yeah this is what i'm looking for uh pdf okay so there's this amazing paper that i have yet to read i've skimmed it because i only found it like yesterday afternoon which is looking at a particular set of stable orbits of three body um of three bodies so it's a kind of like a paper about an apologies if i'm kind of mischaracterizing this this is my sort of cursory understanding of this but basically it's looking at a set of initial conditions for a threebody problem that produces these stable orbits because that threebody problem is famously chaotic and so one of the things that i thought is could i try to and and and uh dan greece who did these i'm gonna ramp up the speed here did these visual um visualizations of these particular orbits um like if i click on this one four on oh these aren't just three bodies these are end body choreography so these are four i was curious to see if i could try to recreate this how close i could get using just like euler integration so these were done using i guess like a sort of fourier um set of fourier transforms uh i believe um and so these are just sort of like the precise routes there's not a physics simulation going on here so that's like a quite an aside but i could do that just as a video itself so i don't know how to decide or how to ask you um there's a threebody novel problem novel i have not read that three body problem novel what is this a science fiction novel written by the chinese writer okay i gotta write this down three body novel well i should read that before i do this three body novels i'm just going to take a quick scan at the chat take the temperature for a second here real time on gpu that's probably not going to have happen um yeah i mean so so by the way if you're looking for the sort of like latest and greatest most highest end like you know compute shader probably like n body simulation like people are doing these and there's like amazing ones uh i don't know like which one of these to click on how how old or recent they are but this is a thing that people do which is to create these very highend fully optimized gpubased endbody simulations um but that's again that's not really my thing like i want to teach the concepts and give you kind of like a basic kind of bitesized working version simon wrote that's a trilogy it's being turned into a netflix or amazon series well by golly are you serious how can i how can i capitalize on that so simon's saying there's no reason you can't make it both a coding challenge and 2.6 of nfc absolutely so conceptually that's what it is the question is which way is it branded and what what's its like home base like is it a video that has the nature of code visual treatment it's called 2.6 that's much more tied to me just sort of doing a tutorial about this concept or is it a coding challenge where i'm kind of more building it as we go again both of these are kind of the same thing ultimately in how my process but it has a thumbnail looks it's called a coding challenge it has the number and then i could just drop it into the nature of code playlist as like a wrapup of the chapter i'm kind of leaning towards that right now rungekutta is another thing that is being suggested yes so that's another i guess what i want to know from all of you experts out there is if all i do is take my simple gravitational attraction example with euler integration create an array of the body of the things um and calculate their mutual attraction forces with the same exact technique basically this if i add mutual attraction so each body attracts each other one i try with two maybe i try with three i could represe i could i could refer this is what i'm going to do i think i've got it i could refer to those choreographic things maybe try some of them and then i could just sort of see how it goes with a lot of them how far i can sort of do the performance maybe i can incorporate this maybe this is just like an additional reference but this is my trajectory if i call it n body if i talk about how i'm doing this as an end body simulation are people going to get hung up am i doing a disservice by sticking with this really uh the sort of like simplest basic a form of integration that's highly inaccurate so i'm not really doing a uh i'm not attempting to create a realistic realistic is wrong where i want it to feel realistic but i'm not attempting to actually match the orbits of how real in our universe celestial bodies would interact with each other so that's kind of where i'm landing through this full explanation and i don't know what to try to achieve now in the next 30 minutes i mean it's being developed by the same people did game of thrones this is crazy all right so i'm just going to take a moment to think and like take a look at the chat sebastian lag oh that's not for me okay yeah turn it into einstein newton was yesterday yeah but see where my brain i'm still in the world of newton in the way that i think about creative coding and simulation um i don't think it needs to be accurate you're not trying to put a satellite into orbit says uh fishy 22 in the discord okay yes i'm in agreement with you so now the question let's make a poll i think i know what you're going to answer and i don't want to do i kind of want it to just be 2.6 but i'm going to i'm going to put a little poll okay i'm definitely reading this book joseph i'm kind of i'm sort of stuck in this other fanta this fantasy series that's incredibly long and i'm being very slow at reading it i'm kind of busy and so i don't know if i should start saying no berlit integration uh freya uh oh look denise lehigh welcome you're the latest passenger conductor whoa to board the coding train thank you so much for your support um i really appreciate it i don't know if you're actually watching right now but um uh you get a random number remember remember this whole random number thing that i i all i do is start things and not follow them through i'm going to give you a random number anyway we're on page 314 row 15680 column something nine it's not it's your random sequence of five digits it's 93791 um and um i've got to figure out these are really uh apologies to everyone working on getting the conductors these train whistles um but i think if you've signed up on the conductor level one of these with a um random walk cus a unique random walk pattern is coming to you uh i'm very sad because i'm no one to blame but myself but um okay um all right wait magnus writes he hasn't even started yet oh no oh no see this is there's been some value in this and this is incredibly valuable for me i got to like go through a lot of lists of announcements and things in par give you information about my process and updates on my schedule things that are going on in the coding train universe and uh i'm thinking through what i'm going to do with this end body thing but i realized that like i'm getting really dangerously close to the end of this live stream and i have not even made a single coding example um um so let's put this poll in it's the same topic the same content but is it branded coding challenge branded 2.6 nature of code uh whoops i post this poll do i have to have three options um which one ask your community don't pick i guess i could call this like see results all right i think i posted this poll um let's see if i coding challenge as a recap of noc so um swarm simulations and i have that on my list um i mean i have done you know flocking simulations but i think there's a specific kind of i don't know why that poll didn't show up oh there it is um eric is here hi eric i haven't seen you in a while um so ah you're also on discord great so teamise make sure you sync your discord and youtube accounts so we can uh give you all the info there on discord um in terms of the member channel stuff um yeah so i think the real question here the reason why i'm i'm kind of airing against coding challenge or leaning against coding challenge even though that's winning currently in the poll is that um i i like the coding challenges to sort of start from a blank slate whenever is possible i mean obviously i'm using p5 and i'm sometimes we'll pull in other libraries or other known techniques but i really want to just start this from where i left off the previous code all right i think that makes the decision for me and the numbers are pretty close like they're right now it says 40 coding challenge 30 41 coding 34 so like that's enough like my vote counts for a lot it counts are at least 5 so i can push it over the edge uh and and you know famously all i ever do is do the opposite of what the pole says i don't know why so i'm starting to think this should be um um nature of code 2.6 and um that's what i'm thinking right now the question is and why did the the question is what the heck am i going to do with the next 20 minutes all right how about this um 25 of you abstained that's a high number um yeah and that's simon is saying for the end of every chapter you have a coding challenge that combines all the stuff from the chapter and you know you know you're kind of getting me i'm leaning back towards that idea because that's kind of what i wanted with the original and if you look at the i think if this comes up i think if you look at the playlist and the way that it's organized that's what i do for chapter three and in a way that's what i do for chapter five because um i just didn't put it in the playlist because i have flocking as a coding challenge and that's what i do for chapter three i have these coding challenges that kind of synthesize all the concepts so yeah let's do that let's call this coding challenge i'm going with oh no wait just as i swung back the other way branded nature of code is like coming up in this almost feeding branded coding challenge ah this is so hard i could still do a different coding challenge that wraps up the chapter um mean i think the real answer here is people just want me to make the video not just spend forever figuring out like whether it's called 2.6 or coding challenge number 1 60 what number am i on now image to ascii is 166. prime spiral is 167 so it would be number 168. all right the other thing i could do is not worry about that at all and just kind of record the tutorial slash challenge and um um and um just come back and record like an intro for it later depending on how i end up sort of positioning it oh it's tied right now if you haven't voted yet you have tremendous power oh wait i haven't voted yet oh it doesn't let me vote uh uh consider that the c results are asking you to vote on their behalf yeah so that means i get 29 of the votes which is basically enough okay the the irony here is this there's no point in me trying to decide this today because i can't do this in 20 minutes could i do this in a half an hour and stay a little longer let me stop and restart recording okay one thing that i should do oh nature of code well how do i end the poll does it end automatically end pull all right i'm gonna give it i'm gonna give it um one more minute which uh is uh uh i'm gonna give it one more minute uh i'll just put a timer on my watch one minute okay in one minute i'm clicking end poll and certainly uh if it says branded nature of code that's what i'm gonna do if it says coding challenge i'll think about it ah they're back to tied i think the guy i think the audience is just trolling me to like try to keep it even coding challenge please says ashik um i mean this is the thing like what am i doing today i think if i do it by the way is the nature of code tutorial i have a greater chance of doing it today the other thing is here's my reasoning i'm kind of making the decision that the coding challenge videos will involve more less preparation and more uh postproduction to make them kind of like short entertaining videos and the nature of code videos or again it's the same me and this sort of will be a little bit more like just let's just let me just code this let's edit it together let's put it out oop timer is done i'm going to go hit end poll and the numbers are final uh it went away but it was at 38 percent oh yeah there we go 311 votes 38 nature of code 33 coding challenge 27 see results all right the people have spoken no matter what i won't always follow what the poll says now the question is can i do so i don't need to do that full recap i do need to take a look at if you'll bear with me let me take a look at the 2.6 video um and just see like what i say at the end 2.5 sorry is going to be equal to the mass of one object times the mass of the other object divided by the distance squared um oh well i mean i could have saved myself a lot of trouble if i just watch that before i begin this whole discussion because that's the whole that's i mean i the video says that and i never did it because 2020. i came back and i just started with chapter three all right so i'm just crying because i took this whole live stream to like come to this conclusion and now i have like 15 minutes left i mean the next real commitment i have is at 1pm but i need to walk the dog i need to eat some lunch hmm i'm just trying to think like realistically like even if i said i'm gonna go to 12 30 am i gonna record this whole thing in 45 minutes i guess i could give it a try could i begin it and come back and finish it later or maybe i should just maybe i should just take the 15 minutes now to kind of do some quick experiments to like figure out what i'm going to do with the 2.6 video oh i really really really got myself into uh quite the pickle here all right i got myself all dressed up combed my hair i feel like this is a good shirt to wear for the nature of code i you know maybe what i'll do is i'm going to just act as if i'm going to start this tutorial but um i can uh like put the same clothes on and come back and finish it another time or maybe i'll just gain some momentum and finish it now or it'll just be practice so this will be practice this is practice i want to leave this up here because i might like to refer to that and this is the example where i left it so duplicate let's call this nature of code two let me call it mutual attraction and i wonder if i change this to 400 by i just feel like i don't have the right amount of space here to code i need that to be further over okay that's better um just make these a little smaller too there we go um i'm being eight so this is good this is this is my starting point okay now i will need to do i now the question is is any of this this was my recap so no so i'm going to erase all this so if i recorded the last 2.5 video in march of 2020 this is actually a full two years later i'm really tempted to open this door back here i think it'll bring too much light in here which will but i love the idea let's just try this oh shoot oh i can't get it it's jammed to pull do i pull it oh no i have to unlock it it's not jammed it's such a beautiful day does that uh how to never actually record a video oh boy now wait hold on what am i doing now i'm like let me adjust the camera i just love having the the nature scene in the background of course my lighting is all a mess now can you see that um i think i need to turn down it's too bright oh yeah oh my god um wrong way uh should i change the iso what have i done oh no this is so badly backlit now okay hold on i see i see the issue don't worry everybody we're gonna get it back okay it's just some fresh air okay this is a problem i thought i locked the uh i mean if i were in class if i were actually teaching my nature of code class at nyu and i was like oh we have a half an hour left let's go over the mutual attraction example that would be no problem i would be no problem i got that half an hour here we go matcha is gonna kill me i had worked so hard to light this white board and i've completely messed it up let me just take a peek at the chat here uh um i'm just i love how i'm like outside though that's wild um maybe that'll get over i mean maybe it'll sort of turn a little bit more overcast um all right this is just practice anyway where'd i put my marker all right um let me just quickly just see if i can see if the focus is okay um you know i shouldn't put the number i shouldn't put the number let me just write on here you true just write that there let me have a look oh yeah that looks pretty good actually that looks pretty good okay i do i'm a little okay okay okay good enough all right here we go everybody the street has five minutes left but i'm gonna go till 12 30. i've got i'm a little bit hungry this is going to be a little bit of a problem but i think i can tough it out till 12 30. probably will never use this i'm gonna hit uh stop and start recording again i'm just going to turn my mic down a tiny bit even though yeah people are wondering where i am i am in the hudson valley right now in new york state but yes i did grow up in baltimore both go go o's and all right here we go ready everybody uh what have i got in terms of like in the way here that's fine what's uh what are you seeing here can i get this out of the way i guess this is fine i don't love having this stream deck here in the shot i guess i could move desk down a tiny bit yeah that's fine okay better i mean i have to look much more down but okay welcome to another nature of code video this one is all about mutual attraction and the end body problem now i don't know how you arrived here this is a followup to the previous video about gravitational attraction but i'm actually making it almost two years later i just watched the end of that video so i think i know if you're watching this in sequence what you expect okay so that's my opening that is correct uh daniel valdengro okay um this is the example from the end of the last video where every one of these orbiting circles is attracted to that pink circle in the center but this is not anywhere close to a true simulation of how celestial bodies would interact with each other in the wonder valley in the vast wonder that is space this is not at all how actual uh whatever that's fine this is just practice what is the step this is way too exciting i'm way too excited by this like nature scene it's kind of amazing looking forward to the spring when it really gets warm okay so what am i talking about here let's just all right let's review very quickly that formula for gravitational attraction so in the case here we have two bodies i'm going to call them m1 and m2 that's they're the mass of one in the massive two oh no i'm gonna call them body one and body two i'm gonna call them body one and body two they each have a mass that is what is represented by m1 and m2 in this formula we can look at the vector that points from one body to the other we can call that vector r the magnitude of that vector squared is the distance between the two objects squared and then this here is the unit vector to describe the direction of that gravitational force so in my code example this is the pink dot in the center and this is the other circle that is orbiting around that that's being attracted to that pink dot but in the troop needham but if you go back to what i think i mentioned in an earlier video but if you go back to hopefully when i talked about newton's laws and how forces occur in pairs the gravitational force that two exerts on one pulling it towards it one exerts on two pulling it towards this and if we have two bodies if we have two bodies that have no other sorry so if we have two bodies like one and two here and there are no other forces in the environment there's no air resistance there's no other things other bodies the pure essence of just the gravitational forces that these two bodies exert on each other and what motion would occur is known as the twobody problem why did i draw all those stars okay what do i want to say next now one thing i should mention one thing i should mention now one thing i'd like to mention if you were about to go and do some research about the two body problem you would discover that it is a solved problem that the paths of the motion of these bodies can be computed precisely with mathematical equations starting with the formula for gravitational uh attraction and the equations of motion to to execute those solutions requires calculus and here we are in the nature of code creative coding funtime landscape where instead of using um instead of using sort of the instead of using instead of evaluating um instead of evaluating a simulation according to precise mathematical instead of evaluating the scenario through solving differential equations i'm using this technique that i've described previously as euler integration where we just use large time steps the frames of our in the frames of our animation and we add acceleration into the velocity and the velocity into the position shoot i wrote this totally wrong you just do that again if we wanted to investigate some more accurate ways or if we wanted to investigate some more sophisticated methods for doing performing this kind of integration you could we could look at something called leapfrog integration we could look at verlet integration we could look at rungekutta integration and i would love to hear from you if you try to execute a version of whatever i make in this video with one of these styles of integration does that improve or change the results that you get from whatever examples i make here please let me know in the comments but for creating a sort of first pass at the twobody problem then maybe moving to a threebody problem and then to an nbody problem i'm gonna just stick with my simplistic method known as euler integration the other nice thing about what we're doing here is i'm foreshadowing some things that are come later in the nature of code in particular in the autonomous agents chapter because one of the things i want to look at are scenarios like flocking simulations where every agent moving around a system interacts with every other agent that's what we are beginning to do here but with gravitational attraction we will see that we'll quickly run into a kind of computation roadblock because this is a problem that is typically an n squared problem if i have n bodies i need to check everybody's force against every other body that's n squared however there are some optimization techniques that i do have some videos about that you could also consider for when we move from two to three to n for example you might take a look at my videos on the quad tree and a technique designed for end body simulation known as barnes hut but i think i've shown off my outdoor it's not really outdoor i'm like slightly inside this garage whiteboard enough and i could go over and start writing some code to step into at least the two body problem all right so how was that every server thank you bot for your super chat um all right all right so thank you simon when i get to when i get to the three body problem your quote there is super helpful um so how is that so far by the way i'm like hey um love from vancouver thank you i'm like hey this is going okay i'm gonna keep this i'm recording the video right now it's happening and i have 24 minutes to give myself myself give myself at least a half an hour before my next thing today let me just check and make sure there's no like emergency um messages of like um you know uh your children have to break be picked up from school blah blah no no emergency messages i can keep going uh thank you zero one all right um uh uh i'm really worried about my volume is peaking quite a bit i'm turning it down turning it down all right so the first thing that i would like to do to this example i'm going to stick with the array um all right so in looking at this example while if i wanted to do a two body simulation i could reduce it to just two separate variables mover one mover two um i would like to stick with the array because that's going to help me later so what i'm going to do is just change the array to having just two elements in it and i'm also going to get rid of this idea of an attractor right there is no distinction now in this example that i want to make between mover and attractor i mean that's not a real world distinction that's an artificial thing that i created for this idea of attraction simulation attraction simulations and visualizations so now i'm just going to completely get rid of this idea of an attractor i'm also going to take out the reference to the attractor javascript file and by the way i don't know when you're watching this at what time in history and whether p5 is even a thing that exists but i might as well take a moment right now to um update my version of p5 from the last time i recorded these videos which is 1.4.0 okay stop now let me go back and get rid of this attractor and now we have two bodies now they are not exerting any force on each other whatsoever they're just two bodies with an initial random velocity i'm going to take the exact attract function i put in the attractor and move it over into the mover for those of you watching the live stream i'm gonna be done in like five minutes i mean not really but so now the mover has a function by which it can attract another mover just sorry i'm reading the chat for a second okay um and let me actually i'm actually going to delete the attractor.js file just to keep things clean so because i now because i have an array uh oh no now because i have only two mover objects i can write the explicit functions for mover one to attract two and mover two to attract one of course they're actually zero and one and one in zero because i'm using an array and arrays the index values start at zero so this whoops oh it's movers apologies so this is now mover zero attracting mover one and you kind of saw that so i think what i'd like to do is just give them very little um starting velocity and we can see every time i run this mover one is attracted to mover zero of course i'm not actually drawing their index values maybe i can overlay that here just so you can see now i have mover one attracting mover zero and you can see this little dance that they do with each other okay i'm just sort of thinking about where i'm going with this once again we might produce some results that we once again maybe we would reveal something more about this if we just like before if i draw these circles with trails i might be able to i'm trying to say here oh focus on me i really want to answer that question but uh i can't it's going to break my rhythm too much it's a really good question i would say no you don't need to switch but yes and that's what i'm gonna do ellis as well so just to try to understand and see what's going on a bit more let's add back some trails and let's see if we can give these circles more precise locations uh and with specific initial velocities to see if there's any kind of more expected patterns that we might see so now i have the mover start um on opposite horizontal ends of the canvas let's see what happens if i start one mover maybe moving directly up and the other ones start moving directly down so i'm going to add two additional arguments to the constructor which gives me the x and y components of the velocity vector well i love this they're moving quite slowly so a couple things i could do is let's give them a higher initial velocity and let's increase the strength of the gravitational force and we get this nice beautiful like sort of like repeating circular dance now again i am not using now again i'm not solving for the precise equations of motion i am not using the proper units of measurement that we might have in uh outer space or i'm not using the proper units of measurement that map to actual celestial bodies in terms of their distance and mass the universal gravitational constant but i do see this makes a lot of sense in terms of what we are seeing here oh i'm excited by this i almost don't want to keep going because i want to stop here and just like play with the parameters and variables of the system add infinitem but let's add a third but let's add a third body let me see what simon says oh yeah um now i mentioned that the two body problem is a solved problem the threebody problem is not a solved one we could approximate the actual motion we could approximate we could approximate the motion of three bodies using sophisticated methods of integration let's see how close we get just with my examples right here i'm going to add a second a third body just in the center and i'm going to give it no velocity just for the moment so and it's not it's not participating in this at all now what i need to do is i need to say okay zero attracts one zero attracts two one attract zero and two and two attracts one and two one zero and one amazingly the body in the center is not moving because its attraction forces are perfectly balanced between those two particles on the outside that's kind of unbelievable that's really cool i'm not i don't know what initial velocity to give it let's just push it slightly to the left one thing that i might suggest just to play with different sort of visual ideas is drawing a line between all of them instead of drawing the actual particles themselves and all well actually let me not mention that right now i so this is not sustainable right if i want to start having like more four four so this is not super sustainable if i want to have four movers five movers i can't keep individually assigning which ones attract the other ones so but i can write a loop that handles this now i have a loop down here to update and show all the different movers i want to keep the force calculations in a separate loop but i need a nested one this loop now it's not behaving the same way and i'll get to why in a second but this nested loop is doing exactly what this says start with mover zero and have it attract one and two then go to mover one have it retract zero two then two zero and one but there is a bit of a problem because every mover attracting every other mover means that the mover will also attract itself because it is another mover in the array so one way that i could approach this is by just saying as long as mover is not equal to other and this is checking if two objects you can check if they're equal meaning they're the same data in memory of the computer that's the same object then this should now be exactly what i had before only it's not because i have it twice so i could delete this now and we should now be seeing exactly the pattern of motion of these there's probably a lot of things you could try doing in terms of how you visualize this one idea would be to connect them with lines so i'm no longer drawing the dots only the lines this doesn't look like much yet but i have a feeling once the three start to move a bit more chaotically in relation to each other we'll see what we get here i'm curious just what happens if i um let's if i do four movers and kind of put them in a like a bit of a diamond pattern and i don't know what i expected to get but i'm quite pleased with these interesting results and i think there's a lot for you to sort of try and continue playing with just out of curiosity let me go back to making them random so we can see with them random i'm getting quite an unstable chaotic system i i'm actually quite surprised how much it's staying within the canvas in my experience with doing this it's usually just going to kind of go crazy and fly off the handle but you can see but i think what i'm trying to emphasize here is that by thinking about the initial starting conditions of the system the results that you get might have some symmetry or sort of character to them that you could really um that you could take advantage of for a particular kind of design and there it's off and running um okay so let me think about though how could i achieve something like what i started with but not have to individually assign all of the locations oh i want to use polar coordinates here but um that's not something that um i could i could give them random locations though okay that's what i'm gonna do um well one way to do that would be to give all the x y locations as randomly around the perimeter of a circle if you remember in my first videos about picking random vectors i did something exactly like that let's have the mass be consistent between them all just for right now and i'm going to have a position so basically i'm picking a random vector i'm stretching it out by a hundred and then i'm adding the center of the canvas so that it's um so that its location is relative to that i'm going to take out the line for a second and just show the dots add the position let's not i don't let's not update the locations for a second all right so that's not very many of them right i should have like arranged them spaced out perfectly around the circle but let's do 50 of them so what happens if i arrange all the particles uh this way and what if their velocity hmm well let's just see what happens with a random velocity right it's kind of going out of control let's reduce the mass by quite a bit chaos ensues i don't know if i really like this result oh and it's almost 12 30 but i'm kind of getting to the end of this um okay i have a different idea let's arrange them all in a vertical line um so let's have x be in the center let's arrange them from top to the middle um and let's have their velocities all point in the same direction and i would like the ones that as they get closer to the center to have a higher mass this did not work at all i might have to come back and finish this all right hold on let's let's not update them oh yeah this is what i was trying to do oh i forgot to turn the boiler off hold on let me uh uh yeah um well there's interesting stuff happening in the chat but i will address that in a second i times four yes that's what i want to do um okay i times uh let's see that's fine let's oh i made that so high let's put that let's make this a global vari i'm going to make g a global variable because hold on i'm going to make g a global variable so i can fine tune it a bit more easily it's really just one variable to like increase the overall strength or weakness of the gravitational attraction forces let's make that one i'll make the initial velocity just one oh you know what they should be faster at the top maybe map from i goes from 0 to 50 so they're going at a fast rate to the left there oh i could alternate uh hold on there's so many things i could do with the initial conditions i'm getting kind of obsessed with this uh down to uh zero okay let's just very let's put an update back yeah i was sort of hoping for something more like this it's kind of spinning out of control i want that bottom particle i could also like to be locked in a bit more uh maybe i just don't want so many of them goodbye oh let's have them alternate their directions this is a nice little bit of code using modulo to have every other one go the other direction there we go i was looking for something more like this and let's have it go the whole way down let's increase the strength of gravity a little bit um i'm just going to make them i'm going to make the mass of all them equal and maybe a little bit bigger too big put g back to one okay you can see how you could do this forever let's draw the lines one more time without the circles that's a great suggestion though i could also put you know i already have some artificial limits in the system like if i go here under mover oh sorry where is that if i i already have some artificial limits in the system if i go look at the attract function you'll remember that i used constrain to keep the range of the forces within some reasonable minimum and maximum range i could also do something where i say this dot velocity limit and limit the velocity of some maximum speed which might stabilize the system a bit more not in a necessarily realistic way but in a way that might allow me to sort of explore the kinds of patterns i could make what does this look like without the trails what does this look like with many many many more particles or mover what does it look like with many many more movers whoops oh because my mapping so i need a variable because whenever i'm mapping i whoa ah look at this wait why is it oh what is going on ah the system is collapsing under itself these are the movers we're adding the shakers yeah too powerful let's make it more powerful oh yeah less powerful oh it's stretching out okay so i i've gone off the rails with this a bit i'm way off the train track if you will so i hope that you're getting some ideas here um i'm trying to think of how i want to end this i kind of wanted to have them swirling around themselves so the circle was actually kind of better but um whoa i can't stop as my problem uh i'm trying to think like is there like an interesting place to end this i might have to come back and redo the end like play around with this more and like come to some sort of interesting conclusion when i added the speed limiter yeah that's it that's where it started collapsing that's a good point um add a force along radius of orbit to each other do colors yeah i mean the reason why i wasn't doing polar coordinates later is is because i um that's like chapter three and i didn't want to like introduce that here um maybe i'll mention that i gotta wrap this up though so i can't stop playing with this i have a um i have a feeling if you think about the initial conditions you know one thing i avoided you doing here was using polar coordinates because that's actually something that's part of chapter three so you might look ahead at that video then you could arrange all these movers in along uh then you could arrange all these movers in maybe starting a spiral pattern and some type of circular pattern i'll try to show you some examples of how that might look but really if you add color if you think about different shapes the number of movers there's a lot of possibilities here i should mention that once you start to increase this total for example if i put this total at 500 um the f i'm not even getting the first frame because the amount of drawing is way too extensive let me see if i can hit stop here i haven't crashed everything too horribly come on stop i want to stop recording and start recording again um come on i hope i saved this i can always recreate it stop don't go to auto refresh 500 was way too much oh wait there we go i stopped it come on come back to me browser come back to me browser so that was so extreme i think also drawing uh 500 times 500 lines was crazy um wait wait i think it's going to come back um there we go i got it back no what i wanted to emphasize was how just doing the force calculations of 500 particles against all other 500 is rather extreme no wait wait it's gonna come back all right i'm now i'm now i'm no longer i can't be patient anymore i'm refreshing hold on let's just find out like oh good no no no no we're in bad shape here no no where did i last save it i can't tell if this is what i yeah no this is what i last saved it as right so we're okay let's make this back five let me just see oh yeah we're good we're good we're good also i got it back but even without drawing the lines and just drawing them as dots let me put it at 100 to be a bit more reasonable like this works of course they all collapse under each other because my initial conditions aren't that interesting let me put it at 500 now this is running slow not just because of the drawing because if i comment out the forces you can see that the frame rate is fine what is incredibly slow about this is the n is the n squared i is the uh is the is the order is the efficiency what's incredibly slow about this is the n squared efficiency of the algorithm where every single mover needs to apply a force to every other mover 100 times 100 that's 10 000 computations but if we were to optimize this using a quad tree and the sort of barnes hut algorithm which i'll provide links in the description with references for that including my quad tree video we could reduce the complexity there enormously to be able to make this run fairly smoothly um and i think i'm wrapping this up now um i'm just gonna i also want to reference this wonderful paper classification of symmetry groups for planar and body choreographies what this paper shows is that with certain initial starting conditions these beautiful symmetrical orbits these the dance of end bodies if you will that result in these um what this paper shows is that with certain initial conditions for various end body systems these beautiful symmetrical dances occur and there's a wonderful um simulation of the of and there's a wonderful simulation of many of these patterns created by dan greece for that particular paper now i'll note that these simulations are mapping the ex that these simulations are running i'll note that these simulations are running through the trajectories based on um let's i don't know how to say this i'll note that these i'll note that these simulations are running through the trajectories based on the mathematical equations and not running through an actual physics simulation but i've you know it's an amazing sort of stretch goal here maybe i could do this someday maybe you're going to be inspired to try this is could you look through this paper find some of these initial conditions and see how closely you can match different kinds of these um beautiful um dances let's try six on a square oh i've got to try these i have a whole project now to work on i don't maybe this will come back in another video sometime all right so this wraps up chapter two of the nature of code uh you can move right on into chapter three a lot of the aspects of chapter three in terms of looking at angles and rotations and orbital motion could really be applied to this particular visualization if you make something from this video check the link in the video description it'll take you to a website where you can add a version of it and i would love to see it thanks for watching and i'll see you sometime soon on the coding train goodbye okay um um um yes i said don't worry chad i'll be done in five minutes an hour ago okay i have to go i have a meeting in 15 minutes 15 minutes to walk the dog eat lunch thank you all for tuning in i wish i could stay and like answer some questions oh i got to spin the wheel i got to spin the wheel hold on hold on you can't not have that maybe i need to do a separate twitch stream since i've been doing that on twitch um remind me later my goodness uh oh boy please no please history have the randomizer in it let's see show full history um local ah why why oh wait i did it this yeah uh no no no yeah but i want the specific page i went to oh it's there beautiful just wanted to show you okay so i could remove the end body problem i could remove the ulam spiral and in theory now i'm about to spin this wheel to pick the next thing i'm going to do let's see what on here do i really not want to do oh and i wanted to add the kerningsburg bridge but i guess i'll have to add this i'm going to remind me that another time can i add that easily not right now i don't have a system for adding something um all right geez i don't know what i want to come up here all right here we go i can't look oh it's totally gonna land on the slide puzzle solver why does it always land on the slide puzzle oh it's going to falling sand is it going to hit mandle bulb oh mandelball will be exciting keep going come on mandelbaum okay that's awesome oh my god the mantle bulb is really hard i don't have to just do it as a point cloud i hope everybody will allow me to just do the mandelbulb just as a point cloud but that'll be the next coding challenge i don't know what i'm going to record that because um i might not be able to stream next friday but we'll see all right everybody i gotta go i'm gonna play this play you out thank you um just a quick uh thank you for uh brilliant for sponsoring today's live stream and i'm going to go to this uh goodbye music and uh just sort of race on out of here i'll take a peek at the chat if anybody has any really important things i want to mention or ask about but i will see you all soon as always i always forget that this stop this stop this stop this stop i'm gonna do this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this stock this stop this stop i'm gonna do this this dot this dot song never forget this dot i'm gonna say once again here we go autotune and the internet will fix that for me coordinate song it's the polar cartesian coordinate song it's the polar cartesian coordinate song you
