03:27 - good morning I'm just checking my
03:29 - microphone I believe that you are
03:32 - hearing me right now and if you could
03:33 - confirm that in the chat let me know
03:36 - Felipe that is a great question please
03:38 - ask it at the

05:19 - momentous moment
05:22 - it's a bit redundant I suppose where I'm
05:25 - here back live streaming with you I'm
05:27 - looking over at my mother over here to
05:29 - see that I see myself I see the chat
05:32 - going I see people talking about how I
05:34 - am late the train this is not a European
05:37 - train this is definitely a
05:40 - it's an American train I mean we've got
05:43 - some nice trains here in this country
05:45 - I would love to have just a whole long
05:48 - session discussion about trains all over
05:51 - the world and which ones we love and why
05:53 - tell me about your favorite trains in
05:56 - the chat my audio might be on the low
05:58 - side so let's take a look at that
06:00 - um that is quite possible
06:02 - I can Pump Up the Volume
06:06 - uh very easily here
06:08 - let me just do this try that okay how is
06:12 - that I tend so I'm not maybe I won't
06:15 - worry about it too much right now
06:16 - because I'm often when I record I'm
06:19 - noticing that as I start to get excited
06:21 - about something volume tends to peek and
06:25 - get very distorted but um let me know
06:27 - still uh so it's hard for me to know
06:31 - because
06:33 - um you are all a bit uh behind oh let's
06:37 - see
06:38 - looking at these interesting questions
06:40 - how do I delete okay I could delete them
06:42 - answered okay uh you can hear me Well
06:45 - audio is fine audio is good okay I did
06:47 - turn it up a little bit so hopefully
06:48 - it's good now hi everyone
06:51 - I have four train whistles let's try
06:54 - them all
06:56 - train whistle number one
06:59 - first attempt to laser etch coding train
07:01 - logo into a train whistle
07:05 - no good
07:07 - cheap train whistle bought online very
07:09 - inexpensively made
07:12 - drain whistle from uh a actual toy shop
07:16 - uh not coding train branded just says
07:19 - train whistle right here
07:21 - beautiful sound oh that sound
07:25 - I will never I will not get anything as
07:28 - good as that now I also happen to have
07:30 - here
07:31 - a custom
07:33 - laser etched coding train the train
07:36 - right there uh a random walk laser
07:40 - etched on the side this was made the
07:43 - laser etching was done by Jason who does
07:45 - all the coding train illustrations but
07:47 - this was made by Maple Landmark out of
07:49 - Middlebury Vermont a nice wood shop
07:52 - there
07:55 - all right
07:56 - pretty good sound requires quite a bit
07:58 - more force is this what you expected
08:00 - because I'm
08:04 - gonna start looking at train whistles
08:06 - and I get distracted by the fact that
08:08 - it's pouring rain outside or something
08:10 - else
08:11 - not sure how much coding there will be
08:13 - today this is really just a chance to
08:15 - press the reset button for the fall
08:17 - engage and welcome you to the coding
08:19 - train uh YouTube channel uh chat answer
08:22 - questions look at a whole bite of a
08:24 - whole long list of updates the main
08:26 - thing on this agenda today I would say
08:28 - is processing four I'm going to take a
08:31 - long look at processing four and all the
08:33 - new features and wonderful things that
08:35 - are present there
08:37 - um now
08:39 - you may have seen this whistle because
08:41 - this whistle which is in this little box
08:45 - uh and I should have like an overhead
08:47 - camera or a closer camera but I think if
08:49 - I hold it here up to my face you can
08:50 - kind of see it a processing Community
08:52 - Day Copenhagen 2022 I was lucky enough
08:56 - to travel to Copenhagen over the summer
08:57 - where I was presented with an authentic
09:02 - wow can you I'm just gonna be quiet for
09:04 - a second
09:06 - can you hear that rain it is it is a
09:09 - beautiful sound it's just like a
09:11 - constant low hum a strong
09:14 - downpour very little wind just tons of
09:17 - water falling from the sky ah
09:20 - beautiful all right so this is an
09:22 - authentic
09:23 - actually used by Danish train conductors
09:26 - in the 1950s uh let's try
09:30 - um let's try this for a second let's see
09:32 - if it can Auto apologies for the uh loss
09:36 - of focus now there we go I think you're
09:37 - gonna see this right now so there you go
09:39 - look at this beautiful uh authentic
09:42 - Danish train whistle from the 1950s you
09:45 - can see that it's uh got some good use
09:47 - in it I've cleaned it thoroughly
09:50 - I'm the only one who uses it we're all
09:53 - covered safe train whistle protocols
09:55 - here in this household
09:57 - um I would love to read to you a little
09:59 - bit about this train whistle of a whole
10:02 - beautiful uh
10:04 - uh uh
10:06 - um explanation about the history of it
10:09 - um
10:10 - this is by uh pricken from 1957. uh if
10:14 - you like Denmark's Railway traffic is
10:16 - directed by buffaloes Indian buffaloes
10:19 - at that this might sound like an
10:21 - insinuation which of course it is not it
10:23 - is true insofar as the black Railway
10:24 - whistles that unleash the horsepower of
10:27 - steam and diesel oil start their Earthly
10:29 - existence as the main ornaments of
10:31 - buffaloes and a quick calculation tells
10:33 - us that Denmark's Communications have
10:35 - cost oh
10:36 - oh boy oh boy I'm sorry Buffalo so I
10:40 - didn't realize this would get so dark so
10:41 - quick anyway
10:44 - um so let's let's let's take a listen
10:45 - I'm just gonna make quite a loud sound
10:48 - uh
10:50 - everybody
10:52 - um please if you're wearing headphones
10:55 - turn down your volume
10:58 - uh get ready here we go
11:10 - definitely in the red there I hope I did
11:13 - not blow out your ears
11:15 - okay that was amazing I'm gonna wrap
11:17 - this up nicely very carefully
11:21 - put it back in its beautiful box
11:24 - and move on to the next item on my
11:27 - agenda but one more thing about the
11:30 - whistles if you are a coding train
11:32 - member which you can join on YouTube on
11:36 - patreon you can do a GitHub sponsorship
11:38 - there's twitch subscriptions if you are
11:41 - at one of the higher levels
11:44 - um you are owed one of these whistles
11:47 - laser etched and specially made just for
11:50 - you this has been probably one of my
11:53 - biggest failures in terms of the coding
11:55 - train is getting these to people some
11:56 - people have received them some people
11:58 - are next on the list some people I don't
12:00 - even have on my list so if you are one
12:03 - of those people please get in touch
12:06 - um I know that Daniel at the coding
12:09 - train that's where you should there's a
12:10 - bunch of different coding train emails
12:11 - and I forget where each of them go but I
12:14 - know that Daniel at the coding train
12:15 - will go to me so if you happen to be
12:16 - watching this you happen to be a member
12:18 - at a certain level I want to get you
12:20 - this whistle
12:21 - um please okay all members by the way
12:23 - any anyway everybody's welcome the
12:25 - Discord but I have some private channels
12:27 - on the Discord for people who sign up
12:28 - where you can ask questions about
12:30 - getting your stickers and all that kind
12:31 - of stuff so a link also your Discord
12:34 - account with YouTube if you sign up
12:36 - through YouTube or patreon Etc and it
12:38 - will allow you access those channels
12:39 - okay so first things first
12:43 - um on my list
12:44 - um I am trying a new experiment
12:46 - which is I found this a wonderful
12:49 - website called
12:52 - onlinequestions.org where you can add
12:56 - and upload I'm sorry you can add an
12:58 - upvote questions I have an admin Port an
13:01 - admin view of it over here so I can
13:03 - quickly delete something I forgot any
13:05 - uh trolls out there watching the live
13:08 - stream this is live I um so I kind of
13:10 - want to move away from it right now but
13:12 - you can upvote um questions and I will
13:14 - answer them so I'm going to start
13:16 - with uh the very first question uh what
13:20 - is
13:22 - uh the meaning of life
13:25 - I think we all know what the meaning of
13:28 - life is it is a very obvious answer to
13:30 - that question
13:31 - 42. okay
13:34 - uh answered how do I do this click
13:37 - answer
13:39 - all right check are there any good
13:41 - videos for learning how interpolation
13:44 - Works ooh okay this is a great question
13:49 - are there any good videos so
13:53 - um let's think about this so
13:55 - in processing in P5 there is a function
13:58 - called lerp
14:01 - can you hear that rain hold on I've got
14:04 - my wireless mic with me I'm going over
14:05 - to a door
14:07 - I'm going to open this door
14:09 - so you can really hear this rain
14:15 - beautiful
14:17 - this is a little coding train rain ASMR
14:19 - for you today
14:21 - all right
14:24 - sorry to leave you hanging there
14:27 - um
14:28 - lerp uh
14:30 - um so let's see let's try lerp
14:33 - um with P5
14:36 - I'm back right okay good I'm back hi
14:39 - uh reference okay so first of all
14:42 - um oh fascinating let's it's interesting
14:45 - to see what Google uh tells us about how
14:48 - to learn about lerp so this is I feel
14:51 - like this is oh yeah this is a 2015
14:54 - video wow this is old I don't look that
14:57 - different I don't think kind of got the
14:59 - same exact haircut wearing a pink shirt
15:01 - I used to do this thing where I would
15:03 - unbutton my shirt
15:04 - and
15:07 - some people made comments about it as if
15:09 - it was some kind of fashion attempt what
15:12 - it was authentically I'm just being
15:15 - completely honest here this is what you
15:17 - tuned in for I swear this is why you're
15:19 - all here
15:20 - the reason why I kept the shirt
15:21 - unbuttoned I wanted to wear a shirt so
15:23 - that I could clip my mic to it but I
15:26 - wanted to show what was on my t-shirt
15:28 - and I've given that up because people I
15:30 - get too many comments I was like oh this
15:32 - guy thinks it's so cool this is
15:33 - unbuttoned shirt okay anyway
15:37 - uh we were talking about lerp so
15:40 - um I do have some videos about lip so
15:42 - why what is lerp lerp is short for
15:45 - linear interpolation what does
15:48 - interpolate mean it means to boy I I I
15:51 - I'm gonna have a hard time like
15:52 - articulating this I was I'm just going
15:54 - to do it off the top of my head in the
15:55 - way that I think about it it means to
15:59 - um uh sort of mix
16:02 - find the point in between two things we
16:05 - want to interpolate between this color
16:07 - and this color so if I was interpolating
16:09 - between red
16:11 - and blue and I get like a purplish I
16:15 - don't know if that's exactly accurate
16:16 - but it's but the idea of interpolation
16:19 - doesn't tell us enough because we need
16:21 - to know what kind of math do I want to
16:24 - use to interpolate between two different
16:26 - values and I can interpolate between
16:28 - scalar single numbers vectors arrays
16:32 - colors there's also as long as I've got
16:35 - some kind of numeric quantity I can
16:37 - interpolate between two and lerp is
16:40 - really
16:42 - um the simplest version of this now
16:44 - here's a really interesting question
16:45 - this is a great test of the coding Train
16:48 - website
16:51 - so one of the things about the coding
16:52 - Train website is
16:57 - uh one of the things about the coding
16:59 - Train website is I have a new feature
17:01 - it's still really being worked on and
17:03 - there's some significant bugs about not
17:05 - bugs not bugs in the website I would say
17:07 - bugs in the data entry my on me if I go
17:11 - to videos let's first go to challenges
17:14 - and one thing I can do is I can type in
17:17 - here lerp and nothing came up so this is
17:20 - instantly a mistake in that I know that
17:23 - I have some coding challenges in
17:24 - particular in particular the bezier
17:26 - curve by the way if you all ever looked
17:29 - at a bezie and curve and thought Oh I
17:30 - could never possibly understand the math
17:32 - that makes this beautiful curve well
17:34 - first of all you should watch Freya
17:35 - Homer's video about bezier curves
17:40 - it's so loud the rain I hopefully the
17:43 - the power does go out where I am
17:44 - sometimes with these big storms so for
17:46 - some reason I just disappear instantly
17:48 - that's probably what happened so you
17:49 - should really look at um Freya holmers
17:52 - uh and apologies if I'm getting their
17:54 - name pronounced incorrectly but Freya
17:57 - holmer's uh video the beauty of bezier
17:59 - Curves it is absolutely fantastic and
18:01 - amazing I have my own
18:04 - poor ver like not nearly as beautiful
18:06 - and thoughtful and amazing version of
18:08 - that which if I probably search coding
18:10 - train bezier
18:11 - um which I want to show you here so if
18:13 - I'm on the coding Train website let's
18:15 - try putting in bezier
18:17 - what about curve
18:19 - I really gotta I really got to work on
18:21 - so this is good we got Lisa Duke curve
18:23 - coch curve Hilbert curve so
18:26 - um we're just gonna find it
18:29 - by searching here's the bezier curve so
18:31 - uh note to all of you contributors to
18:33 - the coding Train website let's work on
18:36 - the ah the topics this one just says uh
18:38 - for beginners so I've got to add some
18:40 - topics to this one maybe we could even
18:41 - do this live uh later let's do uh topics
18:47 - I don't want to get too distracted right
18:49 - now by editing the coding drain website
18:51 - but I would like to show that to you
18:53 - um so if we look at let's see let's
18:56 - think about some of these examples
18:58 - bezier curve with formula I believe with
19:01 - I want to show you
19:05 - um
19:07 - not sure which one is going to be
19:10 - the best I know that this one let's try
19:14 - let's try looking at this one I'm going
19:16 - to look at the um
19:18 - let's look at this coding example
19:21 - cubic okay ah so I'm using in this one
19:24 - the reason what I'm looking for is when
19:26 - I remember making this coding challenge
19:29 - and using the lerp function to do it
19:31 - yeah there we go
19:34 - so you can see the actual and this is
19:37 - going to look like a mess to you and I
19:38 - hopefully if you actually go and watch
19:40 - this video I stepped through this in
19:42 - great detail to explain all of the math
19:44 - but you can see that the actual idea of
19:48 - a bezier
19:49 - curve is just a lot of linear
19:52 - interpolations multiple points all being
19:54 - interpolated together to get this curve
19:57 - like if I have these endpoints okay we
20:00 - got a whiteboard over here I'm off track
20:02 - but this is this is what you tuned in
20:04 - for I hope
20:05 - um so oh it's a little bit dark the
20:07 - Whiteboard but that's fine and also it's
20:08 - still got my Apple II stuff on it but
20:10 - right if I have this point here
20:13 - uh call it X1 y1 terrible marker
20:21 - and my audio is still coming through I
20:23 - hope let me just double check yeah I see
20:25 - it and I have this point here
20:28 - X2 Y2
20:32 - a linear interpolation uh sorry I got to
20:35 - work on the uh I move the lights around
20:37 - it's okay sorry about that for today
20:39 - this will just be as good as it's going
20:41 - to be
20:42 - um this is something I have to talk
20:43 - about in related to the Apple II plus
20:45 - videos I moved everything around
20:46 - multiple times
20:48 - um the idea here is I could be
20:50 - interpolating
20:51 - like 50 of the way of in between these
20:56 - two points
20:57 - would be here and a bezier curve is all
21:00 - about oh take these two points take some
21:03 - control points
21:05 - and do a lot of interpolation with these
21:07 - two points to get this curve that's like
21:10 - a very hand wave high level view of it
21:11 - the video goes over it in much more
21:13 - detail so this would so the bezier curve
21:16 - video might be a place for you to I
21:18 - again I know you asked like what's a
21:21 - good video for interpolation and it's
21:23 - hard for me to off the top of my head
21:24 - know about other videos besides the one
21:26 - that I made I Know freya's video because
21:28 - I it's like the most amazing thing I've
21:30 - ever seen
21:31 - um
21:33 - so
21:34 - um um but uh the other place where we
21:37 - would find and I don't know that we will
21:39 - because I got to work on the metadata oh
21:41 - I'm in the wrong view here we are back
21:43 - again I'm going to go to tracks now I
21:45 - happen to know this again is the new
21:47 - coding Train website these tracks are
21:49 - all of my sequence tutorials that you
21:51 - could find
21:53 - um I happen to know that there is a
21:55 - video on lerp inside this first track
21:59 - but just out of curiosity let's see nope
22:02 - so I don't see it interpolation yeah so
22:04 - that's a useful note I think that would
22:06 - be great metadata for people who are
22:08 - searching for this particular topic on
22:10 - the coding train but I'm going to go to
22:11 - the track uh and I'm going to find the
22:14 - video here which would be
22:16 - unless I imagined it
22:19 - I'm pretty sure
22:21 - map oh you know what I'm getting
22:24 - confused
22:26 - I have a video on the map function uh
22:30 - here as part of this track but the lerp
22:32 - function actually isn't here and Richard
22:35 - is asking what's the best way to
22:37 - contribute to the website so let me talk
22:39 - about that when I get to it
22:41 - uh contribute
22:45 - oh the rain is so loud unbelievable
22:50 - um
22:51 - so uh Stoops New York asked a really
22:54 - interesting question do you sell a boot
22:56 - camp I do not
22:58 - um there's one exception uh with a paid
23:01 - course of mine that you can find on
23:03 - nebula classes which I could Point your
23:05 - way towards if you just go to
23:07 - nebulaclasses.com codingtrain I have
23:09 - kind of a general purpose of what is
23:11 - code a set of videos there but if you
23:14 - want to learn to code through my videos
23:17 - um my suggestion would be
23:19 - and these are all just on YouTube uh
23:23 - find these tracks maybe pick one
23:25 - depending on your level or area of
23:27 - interest
23:28 - um certainly if you're a total beginner
23:29 - this code programming with p5.js is the
23:32 - one that I would suggest
23:34 - um and then if you prefer to learn
23:37 - through more project oriented stuff you
23:40 - could go to the challenges page and the
23:41 - challenges page are more just like a
23:43 - selection of many different videos of
23:45 - different projects that I made over the
23:47 - years
23:48 - um so you know you can see that a lot of
23:50 - work and love went into this website
23:51 - site so much so that the amount of
23:53 - content that I've made just quite a bit
23:55 - less in maybe the last six months or so
23:57 - but hopefully having this organized
23:59 - system for all the content will help
24:00 - people
24:01 - um ultimately okay so
24:04 - um you can't hear the rain that's sorry
24:06 - uh all right video so many wonderful
24:08 - things in the chat so put your questions
24:10 - in onlinequestions.org because I can see
24:12 - them now so uh anyway um so I do have so
24:15 - I have a video on lerp I think I would
24:17 - if you're interested in interpolation go
24:19 - look at bezier curves and then the other
24:21 - thing that you could look at is
24:24 - um uh I I mean this is a little outside
24:27 - the scope of interpolation but um
24:30 - uh let's see Penner easing functions see
24:33 - if we can find a really nice
24:34 - demonstration of this so Robert Penner
24:37 - uh let's see if this uh actually works
24:39 - oh yeah so um
24:42 - you know I think of these as
24:43 - interpolations these easing functions
24:46 - and a linear interpolation would be a
24:48 - straight line right we're moving from
24:50 - one point to another but we could ease
24:53 - in and ease out with a sign with a cubic
24:56 - cubic interpolation exponent elastic
24:59 - they're all these like wild so this
25:01 - actually would be a wonderful you know
25:03 - mental note
25:04 - coding challenge code all uh Penner
25:09 - easing functions um there used to be
25:11 - like a processing Penner Library maybe
25:13 - there's one for p5.js great project for
25:15 - somebody if you want to take this on
25:17 - okay so I answered that question
25:20 - um I'm gonna do one more and then I'm
25:21 - gonna um
25:23 - how do come on answered I'm gonna do one
25:26 - more just in case you see where I am
25:28 - here we are uh I'm gonna answer
25:31 - um whoops ah three one four one five
25:34 - nine I guess I could just open the admin
25:36 - portal here
25:38 - um what's lurk so hopefully uh uh
25:41 - hopefully this is answered
25:43 - oh I can't I can't do it here okay uh
25:45 - what do I do for a living great question
25:52 - so I would say
25:55 - um well let's since you asked it this
25:58 - way the majority of my income how I
26:00 - sustain myself is a full-time day job at
26:04 - New York University teaching as part of
26:07 - a program called uh ITP and IMA it's an
26:10 - undergraduate and graduate program in
26:12 - interactive media arts at Tisch School
26:14 - of the Arts I'm currently on sabbatical
26:16 - which you would think would allow me to
26:19 - spend a lot more time doing this YouTube
26:20 - thing but in reality it did you know
26:23 - there's a lot of things have been
26:24 - accomplished but um yeah so that um I
26:28 - um I do
26:30 - um also focus on a lot of projects that
26:34 - derive income the coding train being one
26:36 - of them
26:37 - um as well as
26:40 - books so I have a learning processing
26:42 - book which was published through a
26:44 - company called elsevier many many years
26:46 - ago it's a little bit out of date don't
26:48 - necessarily recommend that you buy it
26:49 - but you know you might enjoy having a
26:52 - copy of it or if you can find a used one
26:54 - or a cheap one somewhere go for it there
26:57 - is a second edition of it and then the
26:58 - nature of code book which I
27:00 - self-published and that's on my list to
27:02 - talk about today where I am with that
27:04 - project and my goal to have this new
27:06 - second edition done by the end of
27:08 - December this year
27:11 - um okay
27:12 - I just want I want to answer this next
27:14 - one
27:15 - um
27:17 - have you
27:19 - thought of making any assembly videos so
27:21 - yeah so I have on my list here to look
27:24 - at some of the comments and showcase
27:26 - projects for my recent Apple 2 videos
27:28 - let's just mention if you haven't been
27:33 - keeping up with the recent videos on the
27:35 - channel I would love for you to check
27:37 - out I've been really like obsessively
27:39 - playing with the thumbnails and titles
27:41 - of these over and over again but I would
27:43 - love for you to check out these two
27:44 - videos you can go do it now I won't be
27:47 - affected or you can watch them put them
27:49 - on your watch later check them out later
27:50 - but I've been there seems to audience
27:53 - seems to have really appreciated and
27:55 - enjoyed these I've been doing coding on
27:58 - an Apple two plus video I dismantled my
28:00 - entire streaming setup to create this
28:03 - little mini set of me coding on the
28:06 - Apple II Plus
28:07 - I have now put back my streaming setup
28:10 - and I moved the Apple II plus to the
28:12 - other corner of this room
28:14 - so my goal is to be able to go back and
28:16 - forth and I certainly have the technical
28:18 - capability I could even do it today
28:20 - although I no I don't have certain
28:22 - things plugged in
28:24 - um I see Stig in the chat I don't know
28:25 - if Stig was here when I did my entire
28:27 - long elaborate demonstration of the
28:29 - Danish train whistle but you can you can
28:31 - ask all your questions about the history
28:33 - and context of this train whistle to
28:35 - Stig who's in the chat
28:37 - um I see you true bolt Geometry Dash I
28:40 - thought that's coming on the Apple II
28:42 - plus but I do love that idea
28:44 - um so I really would like to be able to
28:45 - do both
28:46 - so the tricky thing is I don't have
28:48 - enough cameras so I have enough physical
28:50 - space now to have both the Apple II plus
28:53 - over there
28:54 - lights are somewhat easy for me to move
28:57 - because I have them on stands and wheels
28:59 - uh cameras I have to like move these
29:03 - cameras aren't sort of fixed tripods
29:04 - they're all plugged in HDMI cables are
29:06 - all set up everything going in this
29:08 - capture PC so it's a bit of a pain to
29:10 - move them so I have to decide do I want
29:12 - to get separate cameras
29:14 - just for the Apple II Plus or do I want
29:17 - to suffer through like uh today I'm
29:18 - gonna do Apple 2 plus let me just break
29:21 - down all the cameras set them back up
29:23 - record a video break it down put it back
29:26 - um so I that's what I'm trying to figure
29:28 - out but please I would love your
29:29 - feedback
29:30 - um if you haven't watched these I think
29:32 - you'll enjoy sort of a little taste of
29:34 - computing history and me re-attempting
29:36 - to do some of my older coding challenges
29:38 - like the snake game over here on the
29:41 - right and the fractal tree over here on
29:43 - the left on the Apple II
29:45 - okay thanks for all these questions oh
29:48 - Assembly Language so a lot of people in
29:50 - the comments and I'll get to this when I
29:51 - get to the uh review of these Apple 2
29:53 - plus videos ask about Assembly Language
29:55 - and I would like to do that and in fact
29:58 - bear with me I'm going to find them up
30:01 - here I have where is it where is it
30:03 - where is it where all my Apple II books
30:08 - um here's a few of them just I'm I'm I'm
30:10 - nearby you don't worry I haven't left
30:12 - uh dos manual ah yes
30:16 - here we go I have so one of the amazing
30:19 - things not just about having the Apple
30:20 - II Plus
30:23 - is that I have in addition and I'm going
30:25 - to move to here and come around and show
30:27 - this to you a little closer in addition
30:29 - to
30:30 - um having the computer itself I have all
30:32 - of the books and manuals and things that
30:34 - I had in the when I was you know 10
30:36 - years old
30:37 - um
30:38 - uh in the early 80s so this is uh
30:41 - programming the 6502 so I thought I
30:44 - would do some re oh you can't see this
30:46 - at all
30:47 - um I would do some reading
30:49 - of this book
30:51 - uh sorry this is pathetic
30:54 - um uh and uh
30:57 - uh try to learn a bit more about it I
30:59 - know that Ben eater has a lot of videos
31:01 - on YouTube about Assembly Language and
31:05 - um working with building your own 6502
31:08 - chip baby with modern microcontrollers
31:10 - uh don't quote me on that so this is
31:12 - definitely something that I would like
31:13 - to get into
31:16 - um I also love love love love love love
31:20 - we think of creative coding creative
31:22 - Computing as kind of this new term of
31:24 - today generative art processing P5 look
31:27 - here if you need to know the 6502 you
31:30 - may not be able to find a text easier to
31:31 - understand this one creative Computing I
31:34 - assume that's some magazine book
31:36 - newspaper Journal I don't know a
31:39 - newspaper the creative Computing a
31:42 - newsletter from the 1980s would love to
31:44 - find that out Isn't that cool okay
31:47 - um try turning off the green screen
31:48 - probably would have helped yeah so sorry
31:51 - about that um but I will I do sometimes
31:53 - use an overhead camera okay so let me
31:56 - um
31:59 - uh and but but the thing is like the
32:02 - question says most of the ones I'm able
32:03 - to find online are on a very basic
32:05 - beginner level that's certainly where I
32:06 - would start so I don't know if I'd be
32:08 - getting exactly what you're looking for
32:09 - but okay I'm going to answer that so you
32:11 - can still ask questions
32:14 - um you can still ask your questions at
32:18 - um
32:18 - onlinequestions.org uh you know I've
32:20 - answered these top four upvoted ones I
32:22 - might poke through and see if there's
32:24 - one that I find particularly interesting
32:25 - I will look at these also later I have
32:27 - it's kind of cool to see all these
32:28 - comments coming in
32:29 - um
32:30 - So and I've got it in my my uh
32:33 - peripheral vision over here so if I see
32:36 - a question rising to the top I will
32:37 - gladly answer it and try to do more
32:39 - towards the end of my agenda here okay
32:43 - so
32:45 - um I'm gonna let's come back to the
32:47 - coding Train website I've talked about
32:49 - it on uh quite a few uh streams recently
32:53 - um but I do want you to know that it's
32:56 - there and let's move on to the
33:01 - um main topic of today so I've bear with
33:05 - me for a second
33:07 - um I don't know what music
33:09 - [Music]
33:24 - okay so first of all
33:28 - if you like the coding trade
33:33 - like even more I might say the new it's
33:37 - not it's not as new it's not as new and
33:39 - shiny as the coding Train website
33:40 - because it's bit it's been it was
33:41 - launched quite a a fair amount of time
33:43 - ago now but also who created and
33:45 - designed by Design Systems International
33:47 - wonderful design uh then put the music a
33:51 - little less loud okay uh I will I will
33:54 - fix that next time the event number
33:55 - Hassan is um three one four one five
33:59 - nine uh it's in the pinned message in
34:01 - the chat okay so this is processing the
34:03 - new processing website
34:05 - um
34:06 - we are going to live this is processing
34:08 - four but um this is over here this icon
34:11 - over here this is the probably one of
34:13 - the Alphas or betas that I downloaded
34:15 - quite some time ago
34:16 - um I'm gonna go over here there is a new
34:18 - official processing for release uh
34:23 - 4.0.1 uh stable release
34:26 - um I sadly have to download the Intel
34:29 - 64-bit but one of the things in my notes
34:32 - Here is that the new if you you know
34:36 - first of all if you're on Windows great
34:37 - if you're on older Mac great but uh if
34:41 - you happen to have one of these
34:42 - newfangled silicon Max M1 M2 M2 Max
34:46 - whatever those things might be
34:49 - um make sure you get the Apple silicon
34:51 - version uh it is a lot of work that Ben
34:54 - Frye did and other contributors I'm sure
34:56 - went into optimizing and getting
34:58 - processing for to work super fast and
35:02 - awesome on um uh silicon chip okay so
35:05 - let's download this we're going to take
35:07 - a look at it and look at some of the new
35:08 - features some of the new uh some new
35:11 - functions you can call in it I've got a
35:13 - whole list of stuff here to look at and
35:15 - uh as I will uh um take your wish so so
35:19 - Alka asks official release yeah yeah I
35:22 - mean I don't know what counts as an
35:23 - official release
35:25 - but this is an official release it's 4.0
35:27 - out of beta 4.0.1
35:34 - I really can't believe you can't hear
35:35 - that rain it's so loud
35:38 - all right so let's open this up uh let's
35:40 - just whatever version this was let's
35:43 - dispose of it let's bring this version
35:45 - over here and let's give it a run and
35:48 - one of the things that's really
35:49 - wonderful about it which I hope shows up
35:52 - uh is
35:55 - um yes I want to open it is a new
35:57 - welcome screen
36:01 - yes
36:06 - this is so cool
36:08 - so take a look at this beauty
36:11 - um when you first start processing four
36:14 - you get this wonderful welcome screen
36:16 - which shows you a few examples you could
36:19 - try uh tells you how to find more
36:22 - examples we could go to this is going to
36:24 - be an important link for us uh what has
36:27 - changed let's go ahead and open that up
36:29 - because we're going to come back to this
36:31 - and kind of go through it
36:33 - um
36:34 - and you know you also might be if you
36:37 - want more detail about this I would
36:39 - highly recommend you check out the
36:41 - revisions which is like the many many
36:44 - notes of all of the things I mean I just
36:46 - you know just I'm just going to scroll
36:47 - this for a little bit you may not
36:49 - realize how much work goes into these
36:52 - projects we could do the same thing with
36:53 - P5 pick your poison pick your favorite
36:56 - open source uh project made with love
36:59 - you know tremendous amount of time and
37:02 - energy goes in and one of the things I
37:04 - especially appreciate about this page is
37:07 - the thorough detailed level of
37:09 - documentation this page is not for
37:10 - everyone you might not want to get lost
37:12 - in this certainly if you're a beginner
37:13 - today's like today's the day I'm going
37:15 - to learn to code I'm going to download
37:16 - processing and try it for the first time
37:17 - you don't really need to look at this
37:19 - page you might come back to it later but
37:21 - certainly if you're if you've used
37:23 - processing before and familiar with
37:25 - processing three or two then this page
37:28 - which is a bit shorter more of a summary
37:30 - is absolutely something you're going to
37:31 - want to take a look at
37:33 - okay
37:35 - um
37:37 - so what was I where was I uh changes uh
37:41 - processing four okay so we were looking
37:43 - at this wonderful page uh then okay
37:45 - we've got to look at this awesome thing
37:47 - be sure to visit tools theme selector to
37:51 - choose your own color scheme for the
37:53 - environment
37:57 - uh you could also select an alternate
37:59 - sketch naming method so processing will
38:00 - always auto-name your sketches obviously
38:02 - you can name them whatever you want but
38:04 - you can also adjust the auto naming
38:07 - algorithm it seems so let's I'm going to
38:09 - keep this show this message because I
38:11 - like it so much I want to see it next
38:12 - time but you don't have to keep that you
38:15 - could uncheck that
38:16 - um I'm curious what happens if I click
38:17 - on one of these examples
38:19 - yeah it opens it up in processing that's
38:21 - so cool
38:23 - so we could look at this message this is
38:25 - a nice very beginner friendly message if
38:27 - it's your first day coding
38:29 - um there's going to be a lot in this
38:30 - message that you might not understand
38:31 - but you can also this is something that
38:34 - you would be could sort of interesting I
38:35 - think one of the things I don't I don't
38:37 - do this enough but I know I remember a
38:39 - Kyle McDonald once did a workshop like
38:42 - this which was like for total beginners
38:44 - or never coded before it was like here's
38:46 - a code project let's just look at it and
38:47 - try to see what we can understand what
38:49 - we don't understand and without
38:51 - understanding it or knowing it can we
38:53 - change stuff and so that can be kind of
38:55 - fun like if I didn't know how to code
38:57 - maybe I would just like oh what happens
38:58 - if I change that number to 800 and I run
39:01 - it again oh whoa okay the size of the
39:03 - window changed so this is the kind of
39:05 - thing you should
39:06 - uh freely do whether you're a new coder
39:10 - or an experienced coder always fun to
39:13 - just play around and change stuff in a
39:15 - certain level you'll get lost or the
39:16 - things you want to understand you might
39:17 - want to double back and review Concepts
39:20 - in a more methodical step-by-step way
39:22 - but those two ways of working are not
39:24 - mutually exclusive okay so let's also
39:27 - let me close this out
39:30 - um let's look at and I'm going to close
39:32 - the welcome screen let's look at them
39:35 - just look at the time it's 10 45. uh I'm
39:38 - gonna be here my hope would be to be
39:40 - this would be about a 90-minute stream
39:42 - with no break but I you know I could
39:44 - might be here until about
39:46 - um noon mblab says can they add auto
39:48 - complete there is autocomplete um I
39:51 - don't there's I think it's a preference
39:52 - and there might be some tricky ways to
39:54 - get it enabled it's not just there
39:55 - automatically I can try to look into
39:57 - that for you
39:58 - um or you come into the coding train
40:00 - Discord but yes there is autocomplete in
40:02 - processing so let's go to oh not the
40:04 - preferences let's go to tools
40:10 - um
40:11 - theme selector there we go
40:15 - so you can read about how to create your
40:18 - own theme and you can save a theme.text
40:21 - txt file for editing themes but I'm just
40:24 - going to go and click through them
40:29 - and I really like the purple one I don't
40:31 - know what looks best it's kind of a dark
40:33 - mode I think maybe one of the lighter
40:35 - ones is maybe better for video
40:39 - it's kind of nice this is how I feel I
40:42 - feel like I've ah
40:43 - feel this one this one has me in my
40:45 - feels
40:47 - uh you know this is this could be a good
40:49 - one for a certain day you know and
40:52 - they're also
40:53 - minerals what Alloys whoa oh these are
40:57 - the gradient themes
40:59 - wild so here there are minerals which
41:02 - are solid colors and Alloys which are
41:06 - gradient themes
41:10 - I hear somebody talking but it must be
41:12 - my wife
41:19 - um okay
41:20 - uh all right let's let's do this one
41:22 - this is very bright and cheery
41:24 - um I like it the line numbers are very
41:27 - hard to see with the themes that is a
41:29 - very good note
41:31 - um certainly I know that for
41:32 - accessibility
41:33 - web content accessibility guidelines uh
41:36 - color contrast is really a key uh thing
41:39 - to always consider for user experience
41:41 - design and accessibility when you're
41:43 - building a website and I think this is a
41:46 - a good note here
41:47 - to maybe uh I don't know where you could
41:51 - file this as an issue or bring it up on
41:54 - the processing Forum I'm trying to take
41:55 - a mental note of it right now that I
41:57 - don't have a good system of tracking
41:59 - everything while I'm streaming
42:00 - um you can tweet at me to remind me but
42:02 - yes I do see that that on some of these
42:04 - themes in particular this one the line
42:06 - numbers are a bit light and hard to see
42:07 - thank you for that comment my shirt is
42:10 - inside out
42:12 - my undershirt is inside out I don't
42:14 - think so you really know how to get me
42:17 - right how to how to push my buttons and
42:19 - make a comment about my appearance live
42:21 - on live streaming and I'm very very okay
42:23 - so let's keep going here
42:25 - um and look at some more things so I
42:28 - mentioned oh so so this is using also uh
42:31 - a lot of work going into updating the
42:33 - version of java and so um from what I
42:36 - understand and I haven't rigorously
42:38 - tested this if you get processing four
42:40 - you're gonna see many many performance
42:42 - boosts
42:44 - um
42:45 - I really want to look at this window
42:46 - ratio method so there's a new window
42:49 - ratio method let's see if I can find it
42:52 - in the reference
42:54 - window ratio so it doesn't appear that
42:58 - it's in the reference yet that's another
43:00 - note uh
43:02 - um to uh
43:06 - I got it if you want me to want me to
43:09 - stop looking at the chat keep making
43:10 - comments about my shirt being inside out
43:13 - um
43:14 - this is another note for the processing
43:16 - Community the processing docs GitHub
43:18 - perhaps maybe we need to have the window
43:20 - ratio function uh documented but let's
43:23 - just give it a try
43:26 - forget how it works let's go look at
43:29 - here
43:31 - window ratio a command that helps
43:34 - automatically resize your sketches
43:36 - whenever the window size changes you can
43:38 - read about it in the release notes for
43:40 - beta 7 ah but a reference page is coming
43:43 - soon so this is known known that the
43:45 - reference page isn't there yet
43:48 - um
43:48 - let's read about it in the notes
43:51 - so let's look for window ratio ah okay
43:58 - so added a new window ratio method
44:01 - function that remaps screen and mouse
44:04 - coordinates to the specified aspect
44:06 - ratio
44:07 - for instance use window ratio
44:10 - whether using full screen or set
44:12 - resizable the sketch will scale its
44:14 - coordinates and the coordinates of your
44:17 - mouse
44:18 - oh this is freaking me out
44:22 - what the oh and then there's like new
44:25 - variables
44:26 - are with r height contain the width and
44:29 - height that we're past a window ratio
44:31 - row it could be used what okay
44:35 - whoa I don't understand okay let's
44:38 - figure this out right well let's just
44:40 - take let's just use this sketch
44:46 - I'm going to do it use a smaller window
44:49 - to start just because I don't have a lot
44:51 - of screen space here let's run the
44:53 - sketch and see what happens
44:59 - so I have a resizable window
45:01 - oh my God
45:03 - this is insane this is insanity that is
45:06 - wild it's like responsive design built
45:08 - into processing
45:10 - it's showing me okay well I'm I'm like
45:13 - confused I'm gonna have to rebuild this
45:14 - a little bit on my own so first of all
45:17 - I guess if I wanted it to start at the
45:20 - size that is the ratio I should still
45:23 - add the size function
45:26 - that makes sense
45:28 - um I'm gonna just take out this I'm
45:30 - going to comment this out here for a
45:31 - second
45:32 - because what I want to understand is
45:38 - is the stroke weight
45:41 - okay hold on
45:46 - so let's just
45:48 - let's try something for a second I'm
45:50 - going to draw a circle at width divided
45:53 - by 2 height divided by two
45:55 - um 100 100.
45:58 - so this oh 100. and I'm going to say
46:01 - fill 0
46:03 - um okay so this
46:06 - would put a circle in the middle
46:08 - but now if I were to do that oh so
46:12 - something weird happens
46:14 - that's off when I resize the window
46:17 - which makes sense that it would be off
46:20 - because I think the idea here now is if
46:22 - I use r with and R height those values
46:27 - are going to change
46:32 - yeah look at that
46:34 - and the side okay the size is changing
46:39 - relative to the
46:41 - size of the window what if I take this
46:44 - out I'm so confused
46:48 - okay this is just like ah so our width
46:51 - and our height don't
46:52 - don't even work and if I were to do this
46:57 - okay so what I'm expecting to see
47:00 - yeah okay I get it now so this works
47:03 - like width and height always update
47:08 - but the thing that's happening now when
47:11 - I use the window ratio
47:14 - is notice how and I use
47:17 - r with and R height
47:21 - notice how the size of the circle
47:24 - the size of the circle is currently 1 8
47:27 - of the width
47:31 - and it looks like it is staying that
47:34 - now what if I just adjust the height
47:35 - same thing it's basically figuring out
47:39 - how to adjust the size so the appearance
47:42 - of the sketch doesn't change regardless
47:45 - of the scale of the window
47:50 - um
47:50 - yeah time to change that and add R
47:53 - everywhere in my old processing projects
47:55 - let's take a look at this page again to
47:58 - see can be used in place of width height
47:59 - our Mouse X and R Mouse y contain the
48:03 - mouse positions scaled by the current
48:05 - ratio
48:06 - fat so if your window is taller or wider
48:09 - than the specified ratio your sketch
48:11 - will be moved using translate to fit the
48:13 - space
48:14 - and our Mouse X and our Mouse y might
48:16 - even have negative the exact amount of
48:18 - space that's extra can be found in ratio
48:20 - left and ratio top and the current scale
48:23 - being used compounding ratio scale
48:28 - yeah got it got it got it got it there's
48:31 - a lot more to this
48:32 - and I I almost like I almost can't wrap
48:35 - my brain around it because I'm so used
48:38 - to you thinking about processing and
48:40 - it's sort of fixed window size but I
48:43 - think the real power here for me would
48:46 - be in using full screen because we won't
48:49 - I won't easily be able to demonstrate
48:50 - this but if I'm saying full screen
48:56 - um what this is going to allow me to do
48:59 - is design something did it just
49:01 - letterbox it oh no I think design
49:03 - something to appear full screen but if
49:06 - I'm on a different machine with a
49:08 - different screen resolution ratio it'll
49:11 - still if I'm using all these variables
49:13 - correctly it'll still have the exact
49:15 - same appearance without me having to
49:16 - adjust my code I think that's the idea
49:20 - uh
49:23 - glad to know my shirt is acceptable okay
49:26 - uh great what else do I so I looked at
49:28 - that okay
49:30 - now I want to look at
49:32 - um there's pde X and p d e z files which
49:37 - allowing you to bundle sketches and
49:39 - contributions into double clickable
49:41 - things okay
49:43 - this is gonna have to parse out I should
49:46 - have by the way I had I have this list
49:48 - thank you to Benton Frye who sent me a
49:49 - lot of these things but I honestly like
49:51 - I haven't really taken it done a deep
49:53 - dive in a lot of these so I'm looking at
49:54 - these for the first time so apologies
49:56 - for not fully knowing where I'm going or
49:58 - I'm looking at or how this stuff works
49:59 - so let's take a look at this pdex and
50:03 - pde Z so let's go back to these changes
50:06 - and see so ah let's actually just go
50:09 - through here
50:11 - um
50:12 - not fond of the default sketch blah blah
50:16 - blah blah blah naming system you can
50:17 - also select an alternate naming scheme
50:19 - in the preferences window
50:21 - it's possible to create your own word
50:22 - list so let's look at that oops
50:27 - ah look at this
50:29 - oh ah look so you can create a different
50:33 - naming scheme like culinary arts oh my
50:36 - God this is so cool
50:38 - I'm gonna hit OK and now I'm gonna make
50:41 - a new sketch I get a dissolved croissant
50:44 - or a red hot cider or dried strips of
50:48 - Curry an infusion of fresh Panini
50:51 - amazing now let's try to figure out
50:54 - where is it doing it and how would I oh
50:56 - I've got a project for you I want to
50:58 - make my own work uh naming scheme so how
51:00 - does that work
51:01 - whoops
51:03 - um
51:05 - so where
51:07 - uh make your own word list for
51:10 - generating sketch name I wonder if it
51:12 - uses something like a context-free
51:14 - grammar
51:16 - um that would be a way to do it hello
51:20 - Argentina in the chat
51:23 - um let's see so where I think that if I
51:25 - go here often
51:28 - if we go to could it be in the
51:31 - Sketchbook folder
51:33 - like I've got a lot of stuff in my
51:35 - Sketchbook so tools
51:38 - modes templates no
51:42 - theme
51:44 - theme there's some theme files there
51:47 - where are
51:50 - here I bet you it's here aha
51:55 - because there's
51:58 - I wonder if
52:01 - adding that's my recent so there's some
52:03 - important files here which are like the
52:05 - actual preferences
52:07 - I wonder where console
52:10 - I wonder where let's look
52:13 - um
52:15 - let's see if there's more
52:18 - um information about it I really want to
52:21 - find this out
52:23 - um
52:24 - sketch naming naming
52:28 - uh
52:29 - oh this is
52:33 - sorry hold on
52:35 - uh
52:39 - detailed information okay
52:41 - uh
52:45 - okay we've replaced underscores
52:51 - new sketch naming schemes can a friendly
52:53 - name of schemes
52:56 - create a file naming.json in your
52:59 - Sketchbook folder that follows the same
53:02 - layout in the processing download
53:04 - provide a name a list of prefixes and a
53:06 - list of suffixes just like that okay so
53:10 - where are those
53:11 - same layout in the processing download
53:14 - so on the Mac it's like the an
53:17 - application it looks like it's one thing
53:20 - I don't know if you know this but it's
53:21 - actually like a bundle
53:22 - of a lot of files so I wonder if
53:26 - I would find one in here
53:30 - somewhere
53:32 - uh
53:35 - Road revisions tools so I might have to
53:39 - like look into this a bit more to find
53:41 - ah there we go look at this I found it
53:44 - so let's open with a visual studio code
53:51 - aha so we can see okay come on come back
53:55 - we can see how this works now
53:58 - that
54:00 - um
54:01 - the friendly name
54:03 - it comes from glitch.com friendly words
54:06 - prefixes
54:14 - I wonder if I skipped over something can
54:16 - I
54:17 - oh my God the rain is so loud
54:20 - can I condense this yeah suffixes
54:24 - yeah and culinary arts is prefixes
54:27 - come on close there we go suffixes yeah
54:31 - Cosmos previous so yeah so now I see
54:35 - um now I see how this is done so we
54:37 - could make our own let's just try it
54:39 - let's do a coding train one
54:41 - so if I do this
54:48 - um let's make a new file I'm going to
54:50 - call it
54:51 - naming.json I'm going to put it in my uh
54:55 - processing sketch folder
55:00 - um well I didn't mean to
55:07 - uh let's call it uh coding train
55:14 - sorry
55:21 - there's got to be a better way for me to
55:23 - do this but I can't think of it right
55:25 - now
55:30 - all right this is fine
55:36 - I'm too stubborn okay so we're gonna get
55:39 - uh an array
55:41 - with name notes and prefixes
55:48 - wow the rain is insane
55:53 - if water starts coming through the
55:55 - ceiling we'll know why
55:57 - um
55:58 - and
56:00 - uh suffixes
56:04 - whoops
56:13 - so prefixes could be chew
56:17 - oh it has to be in
56:21 - Shiny Happy
56:25 - suffixes could be uh chew
56:28 - rainbow unicorn
56:36 - vegan cupcake
56:38 - I don't know what am I doing here what's
56:41 - become of me oh this is from
56:46 - coding train live stream
56:49 - uh
56:51 - coding train all right so I've made this
56:54 - file now
56:56 - this is the most important thing I'm
56:57 - going to do today I'm going to close
56:59 - this out
57:00 - uh I'm assuming that it doesn't Auto
57:03 - populate here so let's let's see if I go
57:06 - out of the preferences
57:09 - doesn't show up let's try quitting
57:12 - processing
57:14 - opening it up again
57:16 - this dot would have been good I don't
57:18 - know why I didn't think of that
57:20 - uh and now
57:23 - I've got a farm fresh bag of almonds
57:28 - and now I see cutting train
57:33 - chew vegan cupcake two unicorn shiny
57:36 - vegan cupcake happy vegan cupcake happy
57:39 - unicorn I want to get choo choo
57:41 - one of these days we're gonna get choo
57:43 - choo
58:03 - okay I know the music's kind of loud
58:06 - it's not loud for me
58:09 - now it is
58:10 - [Music]
58:12 - turn it down for you guys all right
58:16 - all right uh what else new processing
58:18 - stuff do we want to look at okay we've
58:20 - gotten through
58:22 - um
58:23 - oh okay so we've gotten through the
58:25 - naming convention naming system oh I
58:27 - haven't been looking at the um
58:34 - uh okay there I see a couple comments in
58:36 - the um
58:38 - in the uh in the coding training Discord
58:40 - okay new movie maker tool that can
58:43 - create animated gifs as well as high
58:46 - resolution lossless MPEG videos all
58:48 - right
58:49 - this we have to try
58:52 - now let's interestingly enough let's go
58:56 - to the coding Train website
58:59 - let's go to challenges
59:02 - I think I had one on like
59:06 - making gift loops
59:12 - okay so you can see I really need to
59:13 - work on the metadata stuff here
59:16 - would love help with this uh
59:20 - so let's go back here
59:24 - um
59:26 - whoops come on
59:28 - also not all the challenges have been
59:31 - ported so that also might be this might
59:33 - be one that hasn't been ported yet let's
59:35 - go to the next page
59:39 - Cube Wave by bees and bombs yeah let's
59:42 - try this
59:43 - so let's look at this uh code
59:46 - oh this is the oops so by the way if
59:49 - you're on the coding Train website and
59:52 - you're looking for the code if you click
59:54 - on this it's typically going to open by
59:56 - default in p5.js to go to the web editor
59:59 - but over here you can see this
60:01 - processing icon this should take me to
60:04 - directly to the processing code and huge
60:07 - shout out to dipom sen who has done a
60:10 - ton of work organizing this code and
60:12 - doing a lot of the content porting
60:15 - um so let me grab this code bring it
60:19 - into the new processing let's
60:22 - close all these windows that I opened
60:25 - unnecessarily why won't they close
60:30 - you know I shouldn't trust my computer
60:32 - my computer is kind of a disaster this
60:35 - 2019
60:36 - MacBook I really need to upgrade it
60:41 - those new those new M2 matte apples
60:43 - they're not they don't come cheap
60:46 - um okay
60:47 - so crushed sweet potato
60:52 - let's paste this code in let's run it
60:54 - see if it works
60:58 - great so there is oh lovely so I think
61:01 - uh there's a bunch of flaws in my code
61:04 - example versus the original this is a
61:06 - this is one of my coding challenges
61:07 - where I attempted to recreate a very
61:09 - well-known GIF from the artist bees and
61:13 - bombs who you should follow on Twitter
61:15 - or Tumblr or Instagram or wherever you
61:17 - can find all these amazing gifts mine
61:19 - looks like it's upside down perhaps or
61:22 - doesn't have as much as sort of
61:23 - thoughtful visual design in terms of the
61:25 - quality of the graphics and lighting and
61:27 - all of that but this will do for our
61:29 - purposes
61:31 - tools Movie Maker so how does this work
61:37 - oh I see compression ah I see so
61:42 - the movie maker I remember this now the
61:45 - movie maker doesn't directly render a
61:48 - movie so to speak or um from your sketch
61:52 - but
61:54 - if I were to include
61:59 - save frame
62:02 - and I'm going to do a folder called
62:04 - output
62:05 - and I'll do render Dash
62:09 - pound pound Pound
62:10 - these hash symbols indicate to
62:13 - processing that it should number the
62:16 - files up to four places and I'm gonna
62:19 - say I don't know dot PNG
62:21 - and what I would like to do with this
62:24 - code I haven't been thoughtful about oh
62:26 - we can see the original GIF here let's
62:28 - take a look at it but one thing I would
62:30 - love is for the it might not be possible
62:32 - for the text editor to somehow allow
62:35 - clickable links in it uh to recognize a
62:39 - URL in comments but
62:41 - Cube wave
62:43 - it's waiting to load there it is ah so
62:45 - you can see this is this is a much a
62:48 - nicer version of this but mine will do
62:51 - so my guess is just I I could certainly
62:55 - look at thinking about the variables so
62:58 - such that
63:00 - um how would I match the beginning to
63:03 - the end but let's just try to guess the
63:07 - angle starts at zero
63:10 - there's also m a no and angle minus
63:14 - equal negative one so I'm assuming that
63:17 - if the angle
63:20 - is less than negative 2 pi that would be
63:24 - one full cycle of this wave that's just
63:27 - now I haven't evaluated the math to know
63:29 - that this is really true whoops
63:34 - let's do uh B B's and bombs too
63:39 - um so let's see what this does
63:42 - um I'm going to say otherwise exit
63:45 - so I'm going to as long as the angle is
63:49 - less than negative 2 pi no greater than
63:52 - because the numbers are negative going
63:55 - down so my limit is negative 2 pi so
63:58 - while I'm greater than negative 2 pi
64:00 - keep saving the images and then once I
64:03 - get past
64:04 - uh quit exit so let's see what happens
64:10 - oh look how fast so wow that was
64:14 - remarkably fast so how many images did I
64:17 - get so now we can see we have this
64:19 - output folder
64:21 - with all of these images
64:24 - now
64:26 - the first one does it match the last one
64:30 - that would be the question yeah
64:33 - I don't know if I've gone through a full
64:35 - cycle of the wave but they certainly
64:37 - match so now I should be able to go to
64:39 - tools Movie Maker
64:42 - I want to do same size as Originals
64:45 - because I want to generate my GIF to be
64:48 - the same size as the sketch
64:51 - um then I'm going to just oh I called it
64:55 - the French for output
64:59 - it's fine my typo aside I'm going to
65:02 - drag that into here
65:04 - and then I want to create a animated gif
65:08 - Loop
65:10 - and let's hit create
65:13 - uh and I want to save it let's just save
65:14 - it to the desktop
65:16 - uh bees
65:20 - chew
65:22 - I don't know uh save
65:25 - uh did it do it
65:28 - was it just that fast because usually it
65:30 - shows I've done this before with like
65:32 - thousands and thousands of images and it
65:34 - shows me a progress bar let's see if uh
65:38 - on the desktop we do we have this
65:45 - I think I did it is it a perfect looping
65:47 - GIF I'm not entirely sure because I
65:50 - might have missed one frame on one side
65:54 - or the other I wasn't there's a more
65:56 - thoughtful ways of doing this and I do
65:57 - have a set of videos that I build off of
66:00 - golong leavens examples for this like
66:03 - GIF Loop
66:05 - uh coding train
66:08 - yeah so you'll see that I have some
66:10 - videos about making a gif Loop and
66:13 - making a purling noise Loop a hard curve
66:16 - GIF Lube so there's a bunch of these
66:18 - that you could find if you want to like
66:20 - go do a deeper dive into this but what I
66:22 - don't address in these videos is the
66:25 - fact that you can have processing render
66:26 - the GIF because that's a new feature so
66:30 - yes so what this is using from what I
66:33 - understand so uh Greg in the chat is
66:35 - recommending image magic which is a nice
66:38 - command line tool that you can use to
66:40 - create
66:41 - gifts with a lot of different parameters
66:43 - or render images adjust images I've used
66:46 - it there's also ffmpeg which I use quite
66:50 - a bit and I believe that this movie
66:53 - maker tool is just a user interface in
66:57 - front of f it might be using some other
66:59 - things too I didn't develop this I'd
67:01 - have to look at it uh you know we can
67:03 - look at the processing source code or
67:04 - you could ask a question on the Forum
67:06 - but my understanding is that this is
67:08 - using ffmpeg behind the scenes
67:11 - okay
67:13 - I'm gonna move on oh it's 11 12. I gotta
67:15 - move on from this I'm obviously doing a
67:18 - very long dive into all these new
67:21 - features so we talked about this apple
67:23 - silicon is supported sketch folder
67:25 - restrictions have been relaxed making it
67:28 - easier to use Version Control yeah this
67:30 - has been a big thing so I don't know if
67:32 - you've ever noticed
67:34 - um
67:35 - um that
67:37 - and I I know I spelled bees and bombs
67:39 - wrong but one of the things that has
67:41 - been trickied about working with
67:43 - processing is that you can um you all
67:47 - let me sorry let me go here to ask
67:49 - columns typically with processing
67:52 - sketches the pde file which is your
67:55 - source code file has to have the same
67:58 - exact name as the folder
68:01 - um and then if you have this like stray
68:03 - pde file like if you try to open it it's
68:06 - like oh I've got to make a folder with
68:07 - that name and things can get messy and
68:09 - confusing I want to move on from this so
68:12 - I'm and I don't have the full awareness
68:14 - of all the changes here but I believe
68:16 - and if somebody in the chat knows
68:18 - um
68:20 - um there's somebody in the chat knows
68:22 - please
68:22 - um chime in you can ask um by the way
68:24 - Raphael who does the wonderful creative
68:26 - coding news twitch streams is the new
68:29 - processing Community lead so that's
68:31 - tweet at Raphael if you ask all these
68:34 - questions to Raphael
68:37 - um but um I believe the pdex and pdez
68:41 - are mechanisms for different file
68:43 - extensions for having your processing
68:46 - sketches and not and being able to like
68:48 - move them around in more flexible ways
68:50 - with more flexible file naming and my
68:53 - suspicion is
68:55 - if I go back
68:57 - to here
69:03 - oh yeah uh we could look
69:07 - um
69:12 - yeah
69:13 - um I want to I I'm I'm noticing how long
69:16 - I'm so I'm gonna look into this a little
69:18 - bit more and come back to it
69:21 - um but so um but the but know that
69:23 - that's there for you and it's pretty
69:25 - exciting okay uh many many changes made
69:29 - to Future proof the software Java 17
69:32 - um hundreds of bug fixes and usability
69:33 - updates
69:35 - um all the Gory details in this revision
69:36 - document let me look at the note uh
69:37 - there's new Raspberry Pi support so um
69:41 - if it's not something I could
69:42 - demonstrate right now not something I
69:43 - spend time with but if you are
69:44 - interested in doing development on the
69:46 - Raspberry Pi take a look at processing
69:48 - again it's been revamped from what I
69:49 - understand
69:50 - being able to rename the main tab so
69:53 - that Version Control doesn't break when
69:54 - you rename a sketch
69:57 - that's one of the ones gradient themes
69:59 - let me look here multiple ways to name
70:01 - sketches okay I'm going to read you
70:03 - um this is direct from Ben Frye there
70:06 - are a few options for these found in the
70:07 - preferences window oh yeah no this is
70:10 - multiple ways personalizing the
70:12 - environment okay I showed this already
70:14 - uh new welcome screen a lot of Plumbing
70:17 - work oh preferences and Export to
70:19 - application dialog boxes have changed
70:22 - quite a bit so let's look at
70:25 - um let me uh I'm gonna just comment this
70:27 - out let's look at the export to
70:30 - application feature
70:32 - so this is great if you're not aware of
70:34 - this this is such a wonderful wonderful
70:37 - thing for those of you who work on
70:40 - um sort of kiosk like installations
70:42 - whether for a museum exhibit an art
70:45 - installation a project that you want
70:47 - running in the lobby of a building the
70:49 - ability to export a standalone
70:51 - application that can boot up with a
70:53 - machine from processing is huge it's
70:56 - much harder to do that kind of thing
70:57 - with like a browser-based environment
70:59 - because like okay we've got to like
71:00 - write this script for the browser to
71:02 - open the browser has to go full screen
71:03 - it could be a bit of a mess so um
71:07 - what's important is this sort of
71:09 - question
71:11 - um is and I guess this is only relevant
71:13 - for uh what I'm using right now Intel
71:15 - 64-bit Mac but
71:17 - um
71:18 - if you embed Java processing still runs
71:21 - on Java so the application if it doesn't
71:23 - have Java with it it's going to expect
71:25 - the machine to have Java which in most
71:27 - cases it will but this is a way of
71:30 - including it so it sort of guarantees
71:32 - the experience of running it is
71:33 - identical to your running it there's
71:35 - also this really sort of messy thing on
71:38 - Macs about
71:40 - signed applications so to make sure that
71:43 - they're not that they're that they can
71:45 - be run that they're not coming from an
71:47 - unidentified developer let's see how
71:49 - this goes for me right now sort of
71:51 - dramatic uh
71:53 - you know we can we could do like a um
71:55 - [Music]
71:57 - dramatic uh um pause here so I want to
72:00 - do Mac OS Intel 16 for a bit export
72:06 - and I now have
72:11 - this application right here and I
72:13 - believe you can customize the icon
72:15 - there's a way of doing that I mean you
72:16 - obviously could do that on your own so
72:18 - let's see what happens now like I'm just
72:20 - gonna drag this over to the desktop so
72:22 - you see this is totally like a
72:24 - standalone application now I'm gonna
72:26 - it's over here I'm gonna double click it
72:30 - oh
72:34 - let's try this oh I got something I got
72:37 - something for you oh this is so cool
72:38 - okay let's try this now now let's put it
72:41 - all together we're gonna wrap everything
72:42 - up with a beautiful bow
72:44 - okay we're gonna say window ratio 400
72:49 - 400
72:53 - uh uh full screen yeah full screen p3d
72:59 - I think what this will do well first
73:02 - let's just try running it
73:08 - oh I'm not using r with okay hold on
73:11 - am I using with ah r with
73:14 - R height our height our width now
73:16 - obviously I could do a find and replace
73:18 - but that's not me I'm not a I'm like a
73:23 - tedious
73:24 - meditation coding person
73:28 - let's try this
73:31 - this is very exciting oh whoa okay uh
73:37 - hmm let's try
73:41 - what did I do
73:48 - um
73:57 - I probably missed something okay what
73:59 - did I miss
74:03 - and where do these
74:06 - uh
74:08 - see
74:09 - all right w
74:12 - I have to investigate this later
74:18 - I suppose because I was getting so big
74:21 - oh hold on hold on
74:26 - oh this probably I have a feeling that
74:29 - this is okay
74:32 - maybe this needs to be oh
74:35 - maybe the way that I've sort of figured
74:38 - this out all of these things need to be
74:41 - tied to the width and height as well
74:43 - that's probably what it is so I need to
74:46 - this is my fault for not coding this
74:48 - thoughtfully
74:50 - the ortho
74:53 - uh shouldn't the aspect ratio match with
74:55 - ortho probably right it should yes right
75:00 - okay that makes sense but maybe
75:07 - let's just try this and then
75:11 - uh how do I do window resizable
75:15 - is that the
75:16 - function
75:20 - so let's see what happens when I do this
75:24 - yeah oh I see I don't want to I want
75:27 - actually this is not the behavior I want
75:30 - it's doing it correctly it's trying to
75:34 - adjust it to uh the size but really what
75:37 - I just want I always want to I I mean
75:40 - who knows why I'm doing this so the
75:43 - thing that in my head that I just
75:45 - created in my head was like I want to
75:46 - see it nicely fixed as a square in the
75:48 - center but that's not actually what this
75:52 - ratio stuff is meant to do it's doing
75:55 - exactly what it's meant to do which is
75:56 - making it look kind of weird as I resize
75:58 - it but that's kind of cool like so let's
76:00 - just take this out again and let's go
76:02 - back to I'm just curious let's look at
76:04 - the difference
76:07 - uh
76:11 - I'll do find replace here let's look at
76:14 - what happens without
76:16 - that are with our height stuff
76:19 - yeah look it totally whoa
76:22 - it is kind of cool but some weird stuff
76:24 - is definitely happening and then if I
76:27 - wanted it to not I could have these be
76:31 - right I could fix
76:33 - another way of thinking about this would
76:35 - be to actually have all these fixed at
76:38 - 400 no matter what I do
76:46 - and then this could be r with an R
76:50 - height
76:55 - I think this is kind of I don't know if
76:58 - this is the right way to do this
77:02 - but
77:05 - interesting but I'll have to think oh no
77:07 - because it's still
77:09 - um
77:13 - oh this would be
77:17 - I'm gonna get this I want aspect ratio
77:20 - oh there's an ass yeah there's an aspect
77:23 - ratio anyway you you work this out you
77:27 - can see how I can't figure this out
77:28 - right now because my brain cannot my
77:31 - brain it's like when I was programming
77:33 - when I first used processing we're
77:35 - talking almost 20 years ago now 19
77:37 - really if I'm being more precise
77:40 - I'm coming up on 20 years though I would
77:42 - say summer of 2003 so when I first used
77:44 - processing no
77:46 - I I this wasn't even called draw when I
77:50 - use processing this is called Loop so
77:51 - how's my brain supposed to understand
77:52 - how to resize a window in your aspect
77:54 - ratio that's for you young coders out
77:57 - there
77:58 - to do okay did you get the idea it's
78:00 - really cool that I can export the
78:01 - application run it full screen that's
78:03 - what I was trying to show you
78:06 - um
78:09 - all right so uh what else what else what
78:12 - else
78:13 - um welcome screen
78:15 - uh multiple platforms I think I've
78:17 - covered just about everything
78:20 - um
78:21 - about processing four so
78:25 - um
78:26 - there we go okay
78:30 - I've got a few other things on my agenda
78:32 - here I'm going to be wrapping up in the
78:34 - next
78:35 - 10 to 30 minutes so if you're
78:39 - um and and one thing that I would really
78:40 - like to do with these live streams
78:42 - especially now that I've covered this
78:44 - stuff and somebody hey I would uh if
78:46 - somebody wants to help me with this
78:47 - fantastic but I want to make sure that
78:50 - after this stream ends that I put time
78:53 - codes in the description so people can
78:55 - find the different parts where I'm
78:56 - looking at these different processing
78:58 - four features
79:00 - um you know one of the things you know
79:01 - that you might notice is that the coding
79:05 - Train website has a tremendous amount of
79:09 - metadata and a full uh hopefully nice
79:13 - way of archiving and organizing all of
79:16 - the sort of Standalone project videos
79:17 - otherwise known as challenges as well as
79:20 - all of the sequence tutorials otherwise
79:23 - known as tracks but there is no
79:26 - uh bar here for live streams now I would
79:30 - very much like to add
79:32 - live stream archive but the reason why I
79:35 - haven't done that is because I don't
79:37 - have the time or capacity and I haven't
79:40 - um and people I I have people who help
79:42 - and work on who are paid to work on
79:43 - coding train there are volunteers who
79:45 - help with coding train
79:46 - um I I that hasn't been something that
79:48 - we've been able to make time and space
79:49 - for but I really would like for the live
79:53 - streams to be archived in a way that
79:55 - they're more searchable time coded
79:57 - because there are uh you know good luck
80:01 - to you if you're trying to find
80:01 - something that happened for like 20
80:03 - minutes on a given live stream that's
80:05 - like an important nugget of information
80:06 - it's just probably called on YouTube
80:08 - live stream archive and it's three hours
80:10 - long without time codes so if anyone is
80:13 - interested Step One is like let's try
80:15 - doing it for this live stream today but
80:17 - if anyone's interested in helping with
80:18 - that add it to the list of things that I
80:20 - would like to do eventually for the
80:22 - coding trade okay
80:24 - tracks meme tutorials okay Andrew has
80:27 - the great so fall plan is on my list
80:31 - here so uh Raj and Andrew are asking
80:34 - about what challenges are planned
80:37 - um what
80:38 - um how often you're gonna live stream
80:41 - um
80:43 - I'm noticing Simon is not here which is
80:46 - unusual so I'm gonna have to check in
80:47 - and say hi to Simon hope Simon's doing
80:49 - well
80:50 - um
80:51 - uh Sky Grizzly is asking a great
80:54 - question about the Apple 2 plus
80:56 - um so I'm running out of steam a little
80:58 - bit my the engine is getting quite tired
81:01 - but let me fall plan is on my list so
81:04 - let me move through a bit more quickly
81:06 - here so first of all let's check I'm
81:09 - going to check um online questions
81:15 - um there are yeah did I know that this
81:18 - service has no spamming protection I do
81:21 - know that so I'm relying on the kindness
81:24 - of strangers here
81:26 - um where is the name so there are a few
81:29 - questions that have been upvoted
81:31 - um I will come back to those at the end
81:32 - so just so you know
81:34 - um you can go to
81:36 - onlinequestions.org and type in the code
81:38 - uh 314159 uh into the little box there
81:43 - you can upvote questions or ask your own
81:45 - I'll try to do a couple more
81:47 - um at the end
81:49 - um okay
81:50 - Apple II Plus
81:58 - so as I mentioned
82:00 - you can see my recent two videos have
82:03 - been about coding on the Apple II plus
82:04 - I'm planning to do the next one where
82:07 - I'm going to look at building a simple
82:09 - 3D renderer on the Apple II plus so how
82:13 - can the first one I did just text and I
82:16 - made a little snake game with characters
82:17 - moving around the screen then I looked
82:19 - at Graphics drew a fractal tree next I'm
82:22 - going to continue with Graphics but look
82:24 - at 3D rendering that's the plan although
82:26 - I currently don't have a camera set up
82:28 - for it so who knows when I will get to
82:29 - it so I did want to go through and look
82:32 - at some of the interesting stories and
82:35 - comments that people posted here
82:38 - um I think I might not have enough time
82:40 - for that today so what I'm going to do
82:42 - is look at the Showcase so let's go look
82:45 - at the passenger showcase for these but
82:47 - I would certainly encourage you
82:49 - um to take a look at the um
82:54 - the comments there are yeah so like
82:56 - let's just look at this one
82:58 - um
82:59 - 43 year old software engineer here and
83:01 - this is where it all started for me
83:03 - messing around with basic on the Apple
83:04 - 2E in my Elementary School library
83:06 - creating these little games stimulated
83:08 - my imagination as a kid and I can't
83:10 - imagine videos like yours wouldn't do
83:12 - the same for kids today this stuff is
83:14 - timeless thank you for the Nostalgia
83:15 - trip so um thank you for this I see
83:17 - Rusty here in the mid
83:19 - 1970s we got our first computer as my
83:22 - dad was a programmer it was immediately
83:24 - enthralled the game this game was the
83:26 - first program I wrote it was on a Radio
83:28 - Shack TRS 80. so you know I don't know
83:30 - how far down this Rabbit Hole of retro
83:32 - Computing I'll do there are a bunch of
83:33 - YouTube channels um Adrian's basement is
83:35 - one that people pointed me to which
83:37 - maybe is more about restoring the
83:39 - machines than programming on them but um
83:41 - it's been really wonderful uh and thank
83:44 - you practical engineering wonderful
83:45 - YouTube channel to read people's stories
83:48 - about how what kind of uh programming
83:51 - they did on Old Computers in the 70s and
83:54 - 80s I also love hearing from people who
83:57 - are you know born in the century for
83:59 - example and we're like wow I didn't know
84:01 - what programming looked like on these
84:03 - older computers
84:04 - um basic is a bit of um
84:06 - I mean it's certainly something that was
84:08 - widely used but it's a environment that
84:11 - I might say was more for recreational or
84:13 - educational programming but it really
84:15 - fits with what I do I mean I think there
84:17 - is a line that you could draw from basic
84:20 - to processing
84:21 - um whereas you know Punch Cards and
84:23 - Assembly Language and Fortran these are
84:25 - things that I could also get into at
84:26 - some point but that does some people
84:28 - didn't notice that in the comments of
84:29 - people talking about that
84:31 - um okay so I would encourage you if you
84:34 - haven't had a chance to check these out
84:36 - um you can see there's some fun little
84:37 - things in there
84:39 - um uh people uh you know I talk about I
84:41 - was able to screen capture with analog
84:43 - video into HDMI so I'm not going to go
84:45 - through these but what I would like to
84:46 - do
84:47 - is go to the code and Train website
84:50 - and I'm going to go to challenges and
84:55 - you can see here the most two two
84:56 - reasons so first thing I have to
84:58 - chastise you the coding train viewership
85:01 - grab some real talk here people
85:06 - I'm not doing this just to code myself
85:11 - I want to see your successes and
85:13 - failures and where you got stuck and
85:16 - what you tried
85:17 - um so uh so far there are no passenger
85:21 - showcase
85:22 - for no passenger showcases submitted for
85:25 - this particular
85:27 - um video so I want to encourage anybody
85:29 - I don't know what your plans are for
85:31 - today for tomorrow this weekend you know
85:33 - be with friends and family uh make sure
85:36 - you're you're sleeping well you're
85:37 - taking care of your mental and physical
85:38 - health spend some time outside if you
85:40 - can but you know if you're at the
85:42 - computer programming I would love to see
85:44 - some of your work related to this
85:46 - particular video now moving on to the
85:49 - next challenge is there a way for me to
85:51 - go from this page to the next one
85:53 - I think there is and this should really
85:56 - uh um I think oh no we haven't merged
85:58 - that pull request yet so many things I
86:00 - want to talk about
86:01 - um let's go to
86:04 - um back to challenges whoops
86:06 - back to challenges I can do this
86:10 - Apple II
86:11 - and you can see I've got the two so that
86:13 - metadata made it in there I'm gonna
86:15 - click on this one and now we can see I
86:18 - have quite a few wonderful uh passenger
86:21 - showcase projects so I want to take a
86:23 - look at these
86:24 - um coming soon oh look there's a lot of
86:26 - them wow coming soon so I'm going to
86:27 - click through these kind of quickly
86:29 - um because I want to look at all of them
86:30 - coming soon is a way that these will
86:34 - appear in random Order each time
86:37 - um and if by the way if you're wondering
86:38 - how do you submit yours
86:41 - um up here on so first of all there
86:43 - should be a link to it ah submit a
86:44 - contribution it's right here so if you
86:46 - click on this link it'll take you to a
86:48 - new page which has a submission form
86:50 - with information but you can also do it
86:53 - uh through a GitHub pull request so I
86:56 - encourage you to try that the form
86:58 - creates a pull request so regardless
87:00 - you're getting your first pull request
87:02 - made
87:03 - which is going to be really exciting for
87:05 - people that's that's my mission in life
87:07 - is for people to have for me to provide
87:09 - a welcoming positive experience for
87:11 - people to have their first pull request
87:13 - merged to an open source project
87:16 - foreign
87:18 - so I highly encourage you to do this
87:23 - um
87:27 - Raj the thumbnail is something you have
87:29 - to submit so as we've been porting a
87:32 - showcase projects over from the previous
87:33 - website uh
87:35 - Kathy and depam and many other people
87:38 - have been making all these screenshots
87:40 - because we didn't have them originally
87:41 - but now it's up to you to take a
87:43 - screenshot and submit it with your um if
87:46 - you don't submit one it'll it'll just
87:48 - use the thumbnail of the video I think
87:50 - or the screenshot of the the code
87:52 - example associated with the video
87:54 - um
87:55 - so ah so uh I forgot what I was going to
87:59 - say
88:01 - um oh so let's take a look at these so
88:02 - let me actually just go and click on all
88:05 - of them
88:07 - and go through them oh this is gonna
88:10 - cause a problem for me but it's fine
88:12 - Okay so
88:14 - now first is oops looks like it's behind
88:17 - it now this is a little unusual because
88:19 - usually what I would do most passenger
88:23 - showcase projects are to what I usually
88:25 - ask people to submit is well if it's a
88:28 - piece if it's a website
88:30 - it runs online it's the P5 sketch linked
88:32 - to the code editor maybe if you made it
88:34 - in processing maybe you recorded a
88:36 - screen capture it's nice to have like
88:38 - something that I can quickly visually
88:39 - and see but with this it's kind of
88:41 - unrealistic to do that but what I can do
88:43 - very nicely is I can grab the code
88:47 - um
88:50 - and I'm going to go there's a few
88:52 - different emulators I'm gonna actually
88:54 - go to this one
88:57 - and I can just paste the code in here
88:59 - and run it so let's have a look and
89:02 - let's try playing it so one this has
89:04 - obviously been uh switch to Graphics
89:07 - mode mine was just using text
89:09 - and that's really cool to see low
89:11 - resolution Graphics mode and maybe also
89:14 - a nice end screen we can see game over
89:16 - right there so that's wonderful thank
89:18 - you Heinrich and we can see I love that
89:20 - there are nice uh comments and things
89:23 - here uh with with REM being a way to do
89:26 - a comment
89:28 - not the band REM for a remark okay thank
89:32 - you now we've got Julian's
89:34 - um base Apple uh basic okay so let's
89:38 - do this and I think I might have just
89:40 - closed this let's go here let's paste
89:43 - this one in and run it so this also
89:45 - looks this looks like it's doing text
89:48 - but oh it's very fast but just different
89:51 - characters that maybe make more sense
90:01 - game over a game over screen so one of
90:03 - the things by the way
90:04 - um so
90:06 - if I wanted to try these on the Apple II
90:08 - plus I would have to sit and type the
90:09 - whole thing out so copy paste
90:12 - um
90:13 - uh and uh one of the things that you
90:16 - don't realize or that you do if you did
90:18 - this kind of work is and you look at any
90:21 - of these books you would get um
90:22 - magazines in the mail that had cool
90:25 - basic programs that were on pages and
90:28 - pages and pages and you could sit there
90:30 - and just like retype them into your
90:32 - computer and it was a really exciting
90:33 - thing to do to take all that time to
90:35 - retype them and finally run it and
90:36 - realize you missed something I have to
90:38 - look through and find the typo oh those
90:39 - were the days okay thank you for this
90:42 - I'm gonna go backwards now uh ooh so
90:46 - this is a place to hold some code for a
90:48 - snake game in Commodore 64 basic
90:52 - uh here's the basic code the question is
90:56 - I have to run this on a vice emulator
91:00 - you can drag this or attach it
91:04 - let's see convert I'm just curious by
91:07 - the way I'm sure it won't work
91:10 - I'm curious what happens if we try
91:15 - running this code on the Apple emulator
91:19 - yeah so unsupported poke location so if
91:22 - you watch the video you'll know that
91:24 - Peaks and pokes it's an old tiny command
91:27 - to look in the computer's memory or to
91:30 - add something update the computer's
91:32 - memory poke is poking at the memory
91:34 - changing it Peak is peaking it so I used
91:37 - it in the video for peeking at the place
91:39 - in memory that is keeping track of the
91:41 - last key pressed on the keyboard so
91:43 - obviously the Commodore 64 is going to
91:45 - have different memory addresses then so
91:48 - let's just see is there a
91:50 - JavaScript c64 emulator
91:57 - um
91:58 - let's see can I um oh I have to drop
92:00 - some so I don't have unfortunately just
92:02 - because for the interest of time I'm
92:04 - very sorry about this I am not able to I
92:07 - already lost that page
92:09 - um I am not able to figure out the
92:12 - Commodore 64 emulator right now live but
92:15 - I would love to do look at that so thank
92:18 - you for that submission I encourage
92:19 - those of you to investigate that more if
92:22 - you're interested okay so now we're
92:24 - looking at another one snake game
92:28 - gameplay video so that I could watch but
92:31 - where is the code
92:34 - um okay hold on that's the readme file
92:37 - so let's try running this one
92:41 - and let's go back to here this one is
92:43 - from
92:45 - whoops
92:48 - did I just close this one out who is
92:50 - this one from
92:54 - okay this was the
92:56 - uh Commodore 64 one right and this one
93:00 - is from unified data Corp thank you to
93:04 - unified data Corp let's try running this
93:06 - whoa okay this is wild
93:10 - press enter to begin
93:14 - so wait can I just do I get all these oh
93:18 - and it beeps
93:19 - that is so cool
93:21 - oh this is incredible
93:24 - and look at the like text here at the
93:26 - bottom like saying yummy oh I hit the
93:27 - wall oh no press enter to start a new
93:29 - game this is amazing
93:31 - look at all this code
93:34 - look at all this code
93:36 - got some nice comments
93:40 - Go Subs delays welcome screen a poke I
93:44 - wonder what this poke is I actually have
93:46 - the poster over here still
93:48 - four six one eight
93:50 - um here I'll take I'll show you this is
93:53 - um pull it off the wall for a second
93:55 - this is my um
93:58 - so it's gonna get keyed out a little bit
94:00 - but this is the Peaks and post poster it
94:03 - actually has some really fun stuff on
94:04 - the back
94:05 - uh I guess I'd have to turn the green
94:07 - screen on or show it to you on the
94:09 - Whiteboard view but I wonder if we can
94:11 - figure out 49162
94:14 - -49162
94:16 - four nine two four nine one five two
94:18 - four nine one six eight oh four nine one
94:21 - six eight clears the keyboard so the
94:24 - Poke of 49168 is clearing the keyboard
94:27 - so that way if you're using a key that
94:29 - somebody pressed and you don't want that
94:31 - if statement to execute again you would
94:33 - then poke to clear it okay that's
94:35 - wonderful thank you okay I gotta put
94:37 - this back on my wall this is a very very
94:39 - precious thing of mine I don't want to
94:41 - lose it
94:44 - okay
94:46 - um all right thank you for this this is
94:47 - totally awesome
94:49 - um by the way if anybody is in the chat
94:51 - who made one of these
94:53 - um
94:54 - I would love to please say hi uh now
94:57 - we've got the great the amazing
94:59 - Sebastian lag who uh created their own
95:03 - version of it
95:05 - um and let's take a look at their code
95:10 - um look at this really nice commenting
95:12 - going on here we're gonna ah I'm always
95:15 - closing the window now let's uh run this
95:20 - well look at that startup screen ah whoa
95:24 - this is going very fast
95:29 - oh my God so interestingly enough the
95:32 - speed going horizontally is so much
95:35 - faster than vertically because the size
95:37 - of the pixel is not a uniform Square
95:41 - it's interesting be interesting to try
95:43 - to account for that in the code
95:48 - I'm sorry it's sort of like hard to not
95:50 - stop playing these let's see what
95:51 - happens if I get to the end oh
95:56 - I guess there is no
95:58 - I'm not long enough to hit myself and
96:00 - it's got wrap around
96:01 - so let's see let's see if I can I'm just
96:03 - curious if there's a
96:07 - okay well you get the idea amazing work
96:09 - Sebastian lag I love that you did this I
96:12 - look forward to like long thoughtful
96:14 - video essay about programming on the um
96:16 - Apple II plus okay so that's Sebastian
96:19 - lags we've got uh Michael Kemps uh snake
96:25 - let's take a look at this wait a second
96:27 - seed Peak 78 Peak 79
96:31 - to create a random seed
96:35 - gotta look at my poster again
96:37 - Peak 78 78 random number field it's
96:42 - right here that's interesting I was not
96:43 - aware of that that's cool to see all
96:46 - right let's try uh running this one see
96:49 - what it looks like whoops
96:51 - oh
96:52 - okay hold on let's refresh this page
96:56 - and let's try running this
96:58 - whoa ah game over
97:01 - oh what are the keys
97:04 - uh arrows
97:06 - so these are using the arrows
97:13 - I'm looking at the chat here this is
97:15 - great
97:16 - let's look at let's see our game over
97:18 - screen game over yes great job thank you
97:21 - for sharing this so fantastic do we have
97:24 - any more
97:26 - did I get them all snake game with
97:28 - Graphics Julian's we did Michael Kemp
97:31 - Sebastian lag Daniel long we saw uh I
97:35 - don't remember seeing this one slightly
97:36 - more complete and faster did I miss this
97:38 - one
97:40 - oh I missed this one it was a paste bin
97:42 - site that's why I closed that let's uh
97:45 - how do I let's look at Raw
97:47 - let's try this one so I missed this one
97:50 - let's take a look
97:53 - so this is the most close to uh the the
97:58 - version that I actually do in the video
98:01 - um and one thing I'm curious about is
98:07 - um
98:09 - I was looking to see if it used a ring
98:11 - buffer so
98:12 - um
98:13 - one of the things that I didn't do
98:17 - is
98:20 - use this idea of thinking of the array
98:24 - so I I'm like in my modern Computing
98:27 - World thinking about an array as having
98:30 - you know five spots in or ten spots in
98:33 - it and if I want to remove something
98:35 - from the array and add something new
98:37 - maybe I shift everything over and add
98:40 - something to the end whereas on the
98:42 - Apple II this glooping through the array
98:45 - to shift all the elements is incredibly
98:47 - slow so it would make much more sense to
98:50 - think of the array as a circle and all
98:53 - I'm doing is changing where the
98:56 - beginning of the array is so rather than
98:58 - Shifting the elements over I shift where
99:00 - I start and that would be this idea of
99:03 - using a ring buffer which honestly is an
99:05 - efficient way of doing things regardless
99:06 - of whether I'm you know on a M2 Max
99:09 - computer or on um you know an old Apple
99:12 - II but I didn't think to do that while I
99:14 - was programming it certainly that would
99:16 - be something to do all right so thank
99:18 - you I want to really encourage all of
99:19 - you
99:20 - um
99:21 - if um to um to submit to the passenger
99:24 - showcase what will happen is
99:28 - um
99:32 - so when you go if you under guides
99:36 - um under the passenger showcase guide if
99:39 - you submit this form
99:40 - um you are not required to include your
99:43 - email but if you include your email and
99:46 - you have a GitHub account with that
99:48 - email then the Commit This will
99:51 - automatically make a commit and a pull
99:52 - request will be tied to your GitHub
99:54 - account otherwise it's just going to be
99:56 - tied to Choo chupot on an account that
99:58 - we have set up just as like a bot
100:00 - account on GitHub so fill out this form
100:03 - submit it you could also do it manually
100:05 - as a pull request and then what will
100:07 - happen is and I'm pretty sure in the
100:10 - footer of the website
100:12 - if we go here to um
100:16 - here
100:19 - and go to the codingtrain.com
100:22 - and I go to pull requests what you would
100:25 - see if I go to look at pull requests
100:28 - with the label
100:31 - showcase
100:33 - and look at closed
100:36 - you can see these are the five most
100:38 - recent so we can see that there are
100:40 - these snake applesauce basic showcase
100:42 - projects that I looked at and then also
100:45 - let's look at this Space Invaders one
100:50 - um
100:51 - so we can see that this is one that's
100:53 - already been merged it's going to show
100:54 - up on the Space Invaders challenge page
100:58 - let's go look at that
101:00 - just curious
101:05 - uh oh that's going to be hold on
101:10 - Space Invaders there we go
101:13 - and uh yeah you can see it right here oh
101:16 - no no right here this is there's a bunch
101:18 - of them it probably is the last one
101:20 - because they're not random right now
101:21 - there's a lot of them
101:23 - let's see
101:25 - sometimes they don't actually show up
101:27 - unless I clear rebuild the site clearing
101:29 - cache
101:30 - regardless
101:34 - um
101:35 - let's take a look at it here we can look
101:36 - at it here so thank you to Steve King
101:40 - uh here is the Space Invaders project
101:43 - tap canvas to start it's still loading
101:49 - so Lucifer says when is this there's no
101:52 - end to these you can submit them
101:54 - whenever
101:56 - um and I don't know if there's an error
101:58 - here if it's loading so I think there
102:01 - unfortunately was an error with this
102:02 - running so sorry for this little moment
102:06 - of fail here but I encourage you please
102:09 - submit your passenger showcase projects
102:11 - I want to see them I look at all of them
102:13 - and I'm trying to get better organized
102:15 - to look at them and the live streams as
102:17 - you can see okay what else is on my list
102:19 - so I talked about the Apple II plus
102:21 - talked about the Showcase talked about
102:23 - the website got a few more questions to
102:25 - answer so two other updates
102:28 - nature of code
102:30 - fall plans these are highly tied
102:33 - together
102:34 - so let me close a bunch of Windows here
102:36 - and I'm going to be out of here in five
102:38 - or ten minutes
102:42 - um all right so as you know
102:45 - you don't know this as you might know
102:47 - there is a book called the nature of
102:49 - code published in 2012.
102:53 - um you can read the entire book for free
102:56 - online right here
102:58 - this has largely been untouched since
103:01 - 2012. this is the original text it is
103:04 - all written uh for uh processing and has
103:07 - a lot of mistakes in it
103:09 - the neural networks chapter was written
103:12 - before
103:13 - anything that's happened in the last
103:16 - six months let alone nine years
103:20 - 10 years
103:23 - so what's happening with this
103:25 - if you go to GitHub
103:29 - nature of code
103:30 - you will see that there is a new repo
103:33 - called book website second edition
103:35 - this is the new repo
103:39 - where all of the and we're actually
103:42 - currently working on more documentation
103:44 - here where all of the uh content
103:47 - diagrams styling for the new second
103:50 - edition of the book is here and in fact
103:56 - it really should have a link right to
103:59 - the netlify preview
104:01 - right here in the readme I don't think
104:03 - that it does so I have to like remember
104:05 - this
104:06 - what is it called can I log into my
104:08 - netlify account hold on
104:10 - let me just uh
104:16 - see if I can log in here
104:18 - GitHub pretty sure if I log in with
104:20 - GitHub it'll work
104:22 - and nature of code
104:25 - um yeah so I'm gonna I'll show this to
104:26 - you no reason why you can't see it so
104:28 - I'm using netlify which
104:30 - thecodingtrain.com also uses to build
104:33 - the site uh from that repo there's a
104:36 - workflow that whenever updates are made
104:38 - the new site is built so I'm happy to
104:41 - share this URL if anyone wants to take a
104:43 - look this is the current version of the
104:46 - second edition you can see it is missing
104:49 - chapter five it is missing chapter 10
104:51 - and it is missing chapter 11. but most
104:54 - of these chapters with some long a
104:57 - medium-sized list of things they are
104:59 - done and there is a second edition
105:01 - version of the chapter here with a
105:03 - little bit of a new design
105:05 - p5.js code and one of the things you'll
105:08 - see if I go to forces for example which
105:11 - is really exciting
105:14 - let's get to the first example
105:18 - oh okay maybe I need to go to vectors
105:20 - because I haven't done I haven't done
105:22 - this for most of the chapters yet yeah
105:23 - here we go the examples are running
105:26 - embedded here in the browser
105:29 - and then if I click here open in the P5
105:32 - web editor so this is all in progress
105:35 - because they actually changed
105:37 - everything's changing uh this will
105:40 - actually fix it it would take me to the
105:43 - um the sketch in the P5 web editor so
105:46 - this is a lot of work is going into this
105:49 - um
105:51 - Jason who is a recent Alum the ITP
105:53 - program has been doing a ton of work
105:55 - building out this website this uh I
105:57 - didn't think this by the book goes
105:58 - anywhere because you can't yet so a this
106:01 - is here all I haven't been on YouTube as
106:03 - much because I'm doing a lot of work on
106:05 - this but the really so one check it out
106:09 - um there's not really an easy way for
106:11 - people to contribute or participate in
106:12 - this right now but you're welcome to
106:14 - look at the website look through the
106:15 - GitHub repo I welcome your GitHub issues
106:19 - ETC
106:21 - but the real work needs to happen right
106:23 - now which is that I need to
106:26 - get my act together and write
106:30 - the new physics libraries chapter which
106:32 - will be chapter five I'm going to use
106:34 - matter.js
106:35 - write update the neural network chapter
106:37 - to deal with neural networks in 2022 and
106:42 - write the new chapter chapter 11 which
106:44 - is going to touch on reinforcement
106:46 - learning and neuro evolution
106:48 - so I'm not sure yet but in terms of my
106:52 - fall plan I might have to take October
106:55 - off from YouTube streaming and video
106:59 - making in order
107:02 - to start writing these because I have
107:03 - not I've made space to work on editing
107:06 - to get the site going I mean I'm not
107:08 - doing a lot of this work but I'm kind of
107:10 - managing it and thinking about it and
107:12 - making lots of changes so I think that
107:16 - what I'm going I I have an absolute
107:18 - deadline in my mind of finishing the
107:20 - second edition by the end of December so
107:22 - what happens if I don't do any live
107:24 - streaming or recording videos in October
107:26 - do I get drafts of all three of those
107:28 - chapters done in October and I come back
107:30 - to YouTube in November
107:32 - or do I also need to take November off
107:34 - and then December off so I don't know
107:36 - what the future of this fall holds
107:39 - um but I do have I'm I there's still
107:42 - time in September so it's my intention
107:44 - to do another Apple II plus video
107:47 - I would really like to do the wave
107:48 - function collapse part two and now that
107:51 - there's processing four I want to create
107:54 - a new YouTube course on learning to code
107:58 - with the processing so uh our track so
108:02 - to speak so that's
108:04 - um that's the kind of thing that I can
108:06 - just do in one day like it'll take
108:07 - longer to put it all together with a
108:09 - little light editing and and organizing
108:11 - all the metadata but I'm hoping to take
108:13 - like a Saturday just get in here and
108:15 - like teach all the fundamentals of
108:17 - programming with processing over the
108:18 - course of a day so it'll be very little
108:20 - post-production
108:21 - um involved with that and it'll just be
108:23 - up on YouTube as like an archived
108:24 - hopefully somewhat Evergreen video that
108:26 - people could use to learn to code I do
108:28 - have that right now for P5 and I do have
108:31 - a really old one for processing but that
108:34 - that one is 10 years old so I'd like to
108:35 - do it with processing four so that's the
108:37 - fall plan
108:39 - um
108:41 - um uh I I I uh yeah there's more to wave
108:44 - function collapse I don't know
108:46 - realistically what I'm gonna get to in
108:47 - the next couple weeks but that's
108:50 - um that's my fall plan I have a uh if
108:52 - you have questions or comments about
108:54 - that
108:55 - um please let me know uh
108:58 - um join the coding train Discord I would
109:00 - love to see you there
109:02 - um you can find it at thecodingtrain.com
109:04 - uh Slash Discord or there's links to the
109:07 - Discord there let's take a look at
109:09 - answering some of these last questions
109:12 - so I'm going to go to whoops I'm going
109:14 - to go to
109:15 - onlinequestions.org type in the event
109:17 - number
109:19 - and uh
109:22 - we see there's a few ques like let's see
109:25 - if I can get so yes I know this has no
109:27 - spam prediction
109:29 - so I'm going to answer that I I uh what
109:32 - I'm my spam production is I'm looking at
109:35 - it to my right I'm not showing it on the
109:37 - screen in case somebody posts something
109:39 - inappropriate but it probably takes
109:41 - something inappropriate a while to get
109:43 - upvoted so that's also a little bit of a
109:45 - protection here
109:46 - will you continue the Apple II tutorials
109:49 - yes
109:50 - the this the roadblock for me and I
109:53 - would love to hear from you about this
109:54 - you know on Twitter at schiffman at the
109:56 - coding train
109:58 - um I need to figure out how to have a
110:00 - nice setup where I can go back and forth
110:02 - between working on the Apple II and this
110:04 - setup that you're seeing right now with
110:06 - this view as well as the uh whiteboard
110:09 - view so
110:11 - um I'll be working on that and um but
110:14 - yes it's my intention to do at least one
110:16 - more Apple II video
110:19 - uh
110:21 - answered
110:23 - and have you seen any of the physical oh
110:27 - where's the name sorry there's two
110:28 - questions where is the name coding train
110:31 - where's the name coding train come from
110:32 - well
110:33 - sit back it's Story Time with Daniel
110:36 - shipping on the coding trade oh only a
110:38 - few minutes left I'll make this a short
110:40 - story
110:41 - um
110:42 - this channel used to be called coding
110:44 - rainbow that was a nice name it was an
110:46 - homage to the wonderful you know you can
110:48 - see that I have a little bit of an
110:49 - obsession with the 80s being the time of
110:52 - my youth
110:53 - um there was a wonderful television
110:55 - program called Reading Rainbow with the
110:57 - amazing incomparable iconic legendary
111:00 - LeVar Burton and I don't know I just I
111:04 - love the vibe of it and I thought what
111:06 - is it that I want to say about coding to
111:09 - the world I want to say it's a rainbow
111:12 - so I called the thing coding rainbow not
111:15 - thinking I was starting a YouTube
111:16 - channel or a brand
111:18 - um
111:19 - but I flew too close to the Sun if you
111:21 - will like Icarus I hit the rainbow dead
111:25 - on hit me in the head and the very kind
111:28 - lovely wonderful nice Folks at Reading
111:30 - Rainbow where we would appreciate
111:32 - if you didn't name your things so close
111:35 - to arthay
111:36 - so I had had to come up with a new name
111:40 - ask for people on social media what do
111:42 - you think
111:43 - and by golly
111:45 - we need like a wick if somebody make a
111:48 - Wikipedia page edit the Daniel shipping
111:50 - Wikipedia page let's find the person who
111:53 - suggested this
111:54 - um
111:55 - because I can never seem to pull it out
111:57 - of my brain but uh a very nice person
111:59 - suggested coding train and I thought
112:01 - that works for me I like trains
112:04 - has a friendly Vibe we can have a
112:06 - rainbow coming out of the train and
112:08 - honestly that's where the train to
112:11 - training to code I didn't really think
112:12 - of that at the time people have
112:13 - mentioned that in fact so that's that's
112:15 - where it came from if you want to learn
112:17 - more about
112:18 - coding rainbow
112:21 - probably shouldn't be showing this
112:24 - coding uh coding rainbow
112:28 - believe
112:30 - you will if you Google it you will find
112:32 - ah yeah this next web article
112:36 - from 2016
112:38 - has uh this video which is unlisted on
112:42 - YouTube embedded into it which is a
112:45 - little funny uh
112:48 - theme song
112:51 - wow okay okay so you know please enjoy
112:53 - this
112:55 - you can find it uh and if you like
112:57 - coding train I haven't done one of these
112:59 - in a while uh um
113:03 - [Music]
113:05 - coding Train theme
113:09 - yeah here we go this one in 2017.
113:12 - is the updated a coding Train theme with
113:16 - all sorts of additional silly graphics
113:18 - and animations so please please enjoy
113:21 - these If you're sort of new and haven't
113:22 - seen these These are from years ago I
113:24 - guess my newest version of that is the
113:26 - coding together
113:27 - uh sitcom intro so that's where the name
113:30 - coding train came from uh that's my
113:32 - little story time to end today uh
113:36 - hopefully there'll be some new videos oh
113:39 - I have this other project I'm working on
113:41 - which is kind of related to the Apple II
113:43 - but I think I want to make a JavaScript
113:44 - web version on it but and then do it
113:46 - over on Twitch
113:48 - and I if I I got to do this soon I'm I'm
113:51 - making a version of the Oregon Trail the
113:53 - Oregon Trail uh my own code example I
113:56 - guess I could do it as a coding
113:57 - challenge I'm not sure but if you're
113:58 - interested in that old game uh you could
114:01 - probably play it on Apple 2 plus load it
114:03 - from a disk that's also a project it
114:05 - relates to this like podcast and I have
114:07 - a lot more to say about that but remind
114:10 - me about that I really got to get that
114:11 - done got to get started on that soon
114:13 - okay so
114:15 - um thank you wave Morpher thank you Alex
114:18 - thank you sarvagya
114:20 - um this is it this is the end of today's
114:23 - live stream
114:25 - um I've got exactly one minute left
114:28 - before I said I had to go uh Alka has
114:30 - all the assets for the old intro that's
114:32 - great uh your lies coding rainbow yeah
114:36 - exactly can you do fractals on the Apple
114:38 - too hello
114:40 - did you not see my latest video
114:43 - um yeah so you can so go watch my latest
114:44 - video on YouTube
114:46 - um
114:46 - um uh Gabriel so yeah uh preferred on
114:50 - YouTube over twitch yeah I
114:54 - I really struggle I I'm trying to like
114:57 - have my I dip my toe in all the
114:58 - different platforms
115:00 - this is probably very loud for you I
115:02 - made a coding train tick tock
115:05 - that has one video on it now you might
115:07 - be able to find it
115:10 - um
115:12 - I um
115:14 - I I I
115:15 - was curious to experiment with YouTube
115:17 - shorts a little bit so we'll see
115:21 - um but yes I hear you I hear I hear from
115:24 - the audience that at least I mean you're
115:26 - I hear from the audience that's watching
115:28 - right now no surprise here you're
115:30 - watching this stream on YouTube that you
115:32 - prefer the YouTube streams I use the
115:34 - twitch stream just to kind of like
115:37 - experiment with weird stuff that I
115:39 - but in the end like why am I doing that
115:42 - my YouTube streams aren't exactly like
115:43 - professional
115:45 - broadcasts they're really just weird
115:47 - experiments but this today like you
115:50 - notice I didn't code any projects I
115:52 - would like to have these live streams be
115:53 - more about interacting with the audience
115:55 - and answering questions and featuring
115:56 - your work is that less interesting to
115:58 - you would you prefer to just watch me
115:59 - code stuff during live streams I don't
116:02 - know but I certainly would um
116:05 - would uh welcome
116:08 - um cervic yeah I'm so glad I pronounced
116:10 - your name correctly one thing I'd love
116:12 - to see just as I leave let me know where
116:14 - you're from where are you watching this
116:15 - from I the international
116:17 - um
116:19 - um the the fact that the coding trade
116:22 - audience viewers are so so all over the
116:25 - world it's something that brings me
116:26 - tremendous happiness I want to visit all
116:28 - of you
116:29 - I want to go everywhere
116:31 - I want to take going to coding train
116:33 - World Tour probably when I retire that's
116:35 - what I'll do I don't want to have to
116:37 - work though I just want to like
116:38 - experience the beauty that is the world
116:41 - presenting giving toxic very stressful
116:44 - just invite me somewhere I will come but
116:47 - I don't have to give it
116:50 - North Carolina Journey Hershey
116:52 - Pennsylvania the Netherlands Germany
116:55 - Bangalore India Korea India Seattle
116:58 - Boston Norway oh I have an invitation in
117:01 - Norway
117:02 - I got a reply to that email from Oslo
117:05 - the Netherlands India
117:08 - coding train Meetup yeah
117:11 - we had one kind of at prostate Community
117:12 - today in Copenhagen
117:15 - oh that's the end of the song Oh I'll be
117:16 - appearing live in New York City on
117:18 - October 8th and we're in a very smart
117:19 - part of a Matt Parker show more on that
117:21 - later
117:23 - goodbye everyone
117:25 - I always forget that this stock this
117:27 - stock
117:28 - [Music]
117:33 - this stuff
117:41 - [Music]
117:49 - [Music]
118:07 - this is
118:13 - stop
118:14 - [Music]
118:23 - never forget this stuff I'm gonna do
118:26 - this this dot this dot this dot this Dot
118:29 - Song never forget the this Dot
118:42 - and I'm gonna say once again you're
118:46 - important
118:52 - [Music]
119:02 - foreign
119:14 - autotune and the internet will fix that
119:16 - for me
119:18 - [Music]
119:22 - bring it with me
119:25 - Cartesian coordinates it
119:28 - [Music]
119:36 - look forward to Cartesian coordinate
119:39 - song
119:41 - [Music]
119:46 - so this is random this is noise hurling
119:49 - noise that is in the core random
119:51 - algorithm the actual random algorithm
119:54 - itself those numbers aren't related at
119:57 - all you pick like I'm picking random
119:58 - numbers between zero and ten nine two
120:01 - seven six one nine four eight nine two
120:05 - one three I pick nine a lot apparently
120:07 - but with purling noise I might pick
120:09 - numbers like this two three four three
120:12 - four five six five four five six seven
120:16 - five six seven five six seven eight nine
120:19 - eight seven six well this is like pearly
120:22 - noise performance art nine two seven six
120:26 - one five four eight nine two one three I
120:31 - think nine one two one two three four
120:33 - three four five six five four well this
120:36 - is like thoroughly noise
120:41 - [Music]
120:53 - [Music]
121:11 - [Music]
121:22 - [Music]
121:25 - I might pick numbers like this two three
121:29 - four three four five six five four five
121:33 - seven five six seven five two three four
121:37 - three four five six five four five six
121:41 - seven five six seven five well this is
121:44 - like pearly noise performance art
121:49 - unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what
121:52 - else is there
121:54 - yes kittens thank you very much kittens
121:57 - and rainbows and cupcakes notice that
122:00 - look what I get I'm really losing my
122:02 - mind okay let's do it
122:06 - [Music]
122:08 - kittens
122:12 - [Music]
122:20 - pictures
122:22 - [Music]
123:08 - [Music]
123:17 - thank you
123:19 - I feel just sort of like a nice feeling
123:23 - of relaxation everything's gonna be okay
123:25 - today dream is not broken it has not
123:28 - frozen this isn't this is a wonderful
123:30 - thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really
123:33 - getting to something I need my sound
123:34 - effect
123:36 - foreign
123:38 - [Music]
124:00 - that I will use continuously over and
124:03 - over again all sorts of text generation
124:06 - analysis things that I will use
124:09 - continuously over and over again first
124:12 - thing I need to do is yes
124:18 - okay we're gonna do it kittens and
124:21 - kittens and kittens and kittens kittens
124:22 - and kittens and kittens and kittens
124:24 - kittens and kittens and kittens and
124:25 - kittens kittens and kittens and kittens

Cleaned transcript:

foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign foreign good morning I'm just checking my microphone I believe that you are hearing me right now and if you could confirm that in the chat let me know Felipe that is a great question please ask it at the onlinequestions.org website code 314159 foreign foreign foreign momentous moment it's a bit redundant I suppose where I'm here back live streaming with you I'm looking over at my mother over here to see that I see myself I see the chat going I see people talking about how I am late the train this is not a European train this is definitely a it's an American train I mean we've got some nice trains here in this country I would love to have just a whole long session discussion about trains all over the world and which ones we love and why tell me about your favorite trains in the chat my audio might be on the low side so let's take a look at that um that is quite possible I can Pump Up the Volume uh very easily here let me just do this try that okay how is that I tend so I'm not maybe I won't worry about it too much right now because I'm often when I record I'm noticing that as I start to get excited about something volume tends to peek and get very distorted but um let me know still uh so it's hard for me to know because um you are all a bit uh behind oh let's see looking at these interesting questions how do I delete okay I could delete them answered okay uh you can hear me Well audio is fine audio is good okay I did turn it up a little bit so hopefully it's good now hi everyone I have four train whistles let's try them all train whistle number one first attempt to laser etch coding train logo into a train whistle no good cheap train whistle bought online very inexpensively made drain whistle from uh a actual toy shop uh not coding train branded just says train whistle right here beautiful sound oh that sound I will never I will not get anything as good as that now I also happen to have here a custom laser etched coding train the train right there uh a random walk laser etched on the side this was made the laser etching was done by Jason who does all the coding train illustrations but this was made by Maple Landmark out of Middlebury Vermont a nice wood shop there all right pretty good sound requires quite a bit more force is this what you expected because I'm gonna start looking at train whistles and I get distracted by the fact that it's pouring rain outside or something else not sure how much coding there will be today this is really just a chance to press the reset button for the fall engage and welcome you to the coding train uh YouTube channel uh chat answer questions look at a whole bite of a whole long list of updates the main thing on this agenda today I would say is processing four I'm going to take a long look at processing four and all the new features and wonderful things that are present there um now you may have seen this whistle because this whistle which is in this little box uh and I should have like an overhead camera or a closer camera but I think if I hold it here up to my face you can kind of see it a processing Community Day Copenhagen 2022 I was lucky enough to travel to Copenhagen over the summer where I was presented with an authentic wow can you I'm just gonna be quiet for a second can you hear that rain it is it is a beautiful sound it's just like a constant low hum a strong downpour very little wind just tons of water falling from the sky ah beautiful all right so this is an authentic actually used by Danish train conductors in the 1950s uh let's try um let's try this for a second let's see if it can Auto apologies for the uh loss of focus now there we go I think you're gonna see this right now so there you go look at this beautiful uh authentic Danish train whistle from the 1950s you can see that it's uh got some good use in it I've cleaned it thoroughly I'm the only one who uses it we're all covered safe train whistle protocols here in this household um I would love to read to you a little bit about this train whistle of a whole beautiful uh uh uh um explanation about the history of it um this is by uh pricken from 1957. uh if you like Denmark's Railway traffic is directed by buffaloes Indian buffaloes at that this might sound like an insinuation which of course it is not it is true insofar as the black Railway whistles that unleash the horsepower of steam and diesel oil start their Earthly existence as the main ornaments of buffaloes and a quick calculation tells us that Denmark's Communications have cost oh oh boy oh boy I'm sorry Buffalo so I didn't realize this would get so dark so quick anyway um so let's let's let's take a listen I'm just gonna make quite a loud sound uh everybody um please if you're wearing headphones turn down your volume uh get ready here we go definitely in the red there I hope I did not blow out your ears okay that was amazing I'm gonna wrap this up nicely very carefully put it back in its beautiful box and move on to the next item on my agenda but one more thing about the whistles if you are a coding train member which you can join on YouTube on patreon you can do a GitHub sponsorship there's twitch subscriptions if you are at one of the higher levels um you are owed one of these whistles laser etched and specially made just for you this has been probably one of my biggest failures in terms of the coding train is getting these to people some people have received them some people are next on the list some people I don't even have on my list so if you are one of those people please get in touch um I know that Daniel at the coding train that's where you should there's a bunch of different coding train emails and I forget where each of them go but I know that Daniel at the coding train will go to me so if you happen to be watching this you happen to be a member at a certain level I want to get you this whistle um please okay all members by the way any anyway everybody's welcome the Discord but I have some private channels on the Discord for people who sign up where you can ask questions about getting your stickers and all that kind of stuff so a link also your Discord account with YouTube if you sign up through YouTube or patreon Etc and it will allow you access those channels okay so first things first um on my list um I am trying a new experiment which is I found this a wonderful website called onlinequestions.org where you can add and upload I'm sorry you can add an upvote questions I have an admin Port an admin view of it over here so I can quickly delete something I forgot any uh trolls out there watching the live stream this is live I um so I kind of want to move away from it right now but you can upvote um questions and I will answer them so I'm going to start with uh the very first question uh what is uh the meaning of life I think we all know what the meaning of life is it is a very obvious answer to that question 42. okay uh answered how do I do this click answer all right check are there any good videos for learning how interpolation Works ooh okay this is a great question are there any good videos so um let's think about this so in processing in P5 there is a function called lerp can you hear that rain hold on I've got my wireless mic with me I'm going over to a door I'm going to open this door so you can really hear this rain beautiful this is a little coding train rain ASMR for you today all right sorry to leave you hanging there um lerp uh um so let's see let's try lerp um with P5 I'm back right okay good I'm back hi uh reference okay so first of all um oh fascinating let's it's interesting to see what Google uh tells us about how to learn about lerp so this is I feel like this is oh yeah this is a 2015 video wow this is old I don't look that different I don't think kind of got the same exact haircut wearing a pink shirt I used to do this thing where I would unbutton my shirt and some people made comments about it as if it was some kind of fashion attempt what it was authentically I'm just being completely honest here this is what you tuned in for I swear this is why you're all here the reason why I kept the shirt unbuttoned I wanted to wear a shirt so that I could clip my mic to it but I wanted to show what was on my tshirt and I've given that up because people I get too many comments I was like oh this guy thinks it's so cool this is unbuttoned shirt okay anyway uh we were talking about lerp so um I do have some videos about lip so why what is lerp lerp is short for linear interpolation what does interpolate mean it means to boy I I I I'm gonna have a hard time like articulating this I was I'm just going to do it off the top of my head in the way that I think about it it means to um uh sort of mix find the point in between two things we want to interpolate between this color and this color so if I was interpolating between red and blue and I get like a purplish I don't know if that's exactly accurate but it's but the idea of interpolation doesn't tell us enough because we need to know what kind of math do I want to use to interpolate between two different values and I can interpolate between scalar single numbers vectors arrays colors there's also as long as I've got some kind of numeric quantity I can interpolate between two and lerp is really um the simplest version of this now here's a really interesting question this is a great test of the coding Train website so one of the things about the coding Train website is uh one of the things about the coding Train website is I have a new feature it's still really being worked on and there's some significant bugs about not bugs not bugs in the website I would say bugs in the data entry my on me if I go to videos let's first go to challenges and one thing I can do is I can type in here lerp and nothing came up so this is instantly a mistake in that I know that I have some coding challenges in particular in particular the bezier curve by the way if you all ever looked at a bezie and curve and thought Oh I could never possibly understand the math that makes this beautiful curve well first of all you should watch Freya Homer's video about bezier curves it's so loud the rain I hopefully the the power does go out where I am sometimes with these big storms so for some reason I just disappear instantly that's probably what happened so you should really look at um Freya holmers uh and apologies if I'm getting their name pronounced incorrectly but Freya holmer's uh video the beauty of bezier Curves it is absolutely fantastic and amazing I have my own poor ver like not nearly as beautiful and thoughtful and amazing version of that which if I probably search coding train bezier um which I want to show you here so if I'm on the coding Train website let's try putting in bezier what about curve I really gotta I really got to work on so this is good we got Lisa Duke curve coch curve Hilbert curve so um we're just gonna find it by searching here's the bezier curve so uh note to all of you contributors to the coding Train website let's work on the ah the topics this one just says uh for beginners so I've got to add some topics to this one maybe we could even do this live uh later let's do uh topics I don't want to get too distracted right now by editing the coding drain website but I would like to show that to you um so if we look at let's see let's think about some of these examples bezier curve with formula I believe with I want to show you um not sure which one is going to be the best I know that this one let's try let's try looking at this one I'm going to look at the um let's look at this coding example cubic okay ah so I'm using in this one the reason what I'm looking for is when I remember making this coding challenge and using the lerp function to do it yeah there we go so you can see the actual and this is going to look like a mess to you and I hopefully if you actually go and watch this video I stepped through this in great detail to explain all of the math but you can see that the actual idea of a bezier curve is just a lot of linear interpolations multiple points all being interpolated together to get this curve like if I have these endpoints okay we got a whiteboard over here I'm off track but this is this is what you tuned in for I hope um so oh it's a little bit dark the Whiteboard but that's fine and also it's still got my Apple II stuff on it but right if I have this point here uh call it X1 y1 terrible marker and my audio is still coming through I hope let me just double check yeah I see it and I have this point here X2 Y2 a linear interpolation uh sorry I got to work on the uh I move the lights around it's okay sorry about that for today this will just be as good as it's going to be um this is something I have to talk about in related to the Apple II plus videos I moved everything around multiple times um the idea here is I could be interpolating like 50 of the way of in between these two points would be here and a bezier curve is all about oh take these two points take some control points and do a lot of interpolation with these two points to get this curve that's like a very hand wave high level view of it the video goes over it in much more detail so this would so the bezier curve video might be a place for you to I again I know you asked like what's a good video for interpolation and it's hard for me to off the top of my head know about other videos besides the one that I made I Know freya's video because I it's like the most amazing thing I've ever seen um so um um but uh the other place where we would find and I don't know that we will because I got to work on the metadata oh I'm in the wrong view here we are back again I'm going to go to tracks now I happen to know this again is the new coding Train website these tracks are all of my sequence tutorials that you could find um I happen to know that there is a video on lerp inside this first track but just out of curiosity let's see nope so I don't see it interpolation yeah so that's a useful note I think that would be great metadata for people who are searching for this particular topic on the coding train but I'm going to go to the track uh and I'm going to find the video here which would be unless I imagined it I'm pretty sure map oh you know what I'm getting confused I have a video on the map function uh here as part of this track but the lerp function actually isn't here and Richard is asking what's the best way to contribute to the website so let me talk about that when I get to it uh contribute oh the rain is so loud unbelievable um so uh Stoops New York asked a really interesting question do you sell a boot camp I do not um there's one exception uh with a paid course of mine that you can find on nebula classes which I could Point your way towards if you just go to nebulaclasses.com codingtrain I have kind of a general purpose of what is code a set of videos there but if you want to learn to code through my videos um my suggestion would be and these are all just on YouTube uh find these tracks maybe pick one depending on your level or area of interest um certainly if you're a total beginner this code programming with p5.js is the one that I would suggest um and then if you prefer to learn through more project oriented stuff you could go to the challenges page and the challenges page are more just like a selection of many different videos of different projects that I made over the years um so you know you can see that a lot of work and love went into this website site so much so that the amount of content that I've made just quite a bit less in maybe the last six months or so but hopefully having this organized system for all the content will help people um ultimately okay so um you can't hear the rain that's sorry uh all right video so many wonderful things in the chat so put your questions in onlinequestions.org because I can see them now so uh anyway um so I do have so I have a video on lerp I think I would if you're interested in interpolation go look at bezier curves and then the other thing that you could look at is um uh I I mean this is a little outside the scope of interpolation but um uh let's see Penner easing functions see if we can find a really nice demonstration of this so Robert Penner uh let's see if this uh actually works oh yeah so um you know I think of these as interpolations these easing functions and a linear interpolation would be a straight line right we're moving from one point to another but we could ease in and ease out with a sign with a cubic cubic interpolation exponent elastic they're all these like wild so this actually would be a wonderful you know mental note coding challenge code all uh Penner easing functions um there used to be like a processing Penner Library maybe there's one for p5.js great project for somebody if you want to take this on okay so I answered that question um I'm gonna do one more and then I'm gonna um how do come on answered I'm gonna do one more just in case you see where I am here we are uh I'm gonna answer um whoops ah three one four one five nine I guess I could just open the admin portal here um what's lurk so hopefully uh uh hopefully this is answered oh I can't I can't do it here okay uh what do I do for a living great question so I would say um well let's since you asked it this way the majority of my income how I sustain myself is a fulltime day job at New York University teaching as part of a program called uh ITP and IMA it's an undergraduate and graduate program in interactive media arts at Tisch School of the Arts I'm currently on sabbatical which you would think would allow me to spend a lot more time doing this YouTube thing but in reality it did you know there's a lot of things have been accomplished but um yeah so that um I um I do um also focus on a lot of projects that derive income the coding train being one of them um as well as books so I have a learning processing book which was published through a company called elsevier many many years ago it's a little bit out of date don't necessarily recommend that you buy it but you know you might enjoy having a copy of it or if you can find a used one or a cheap one somewhere go for it there is a second edition of it and then the nature of code book which I selfpublished and that's on my list to talk about today where I am with that project and my goal to have this new second edition done by the end of December this year um okay I just want I want to answer this next one um have you thought of making any assembly videos so yeah so I have on my list here to look at some of the comments and showcase projects for my recent Apple 2 videos let's just mention if you haven't been keeping up with the recent videos on the channel I would love for you to check out I've been really like obsessively playing with the thumbnails and titles of these over and over again but I would love for you to check out these two videos you can go do it now I won't be affected or you can watch them put them on your watch later check them out later but I've been there seems to audience seems to have really appreciated and enjoyed these I've been doing coding on an Apple two plus video I dismantled my entire streaming setup to create this little mini set of me coding on the Apple II Plus I have now put back my streaming setup and I moved the Apple II plus to the other corner of this room so my goal is to be able to go back and forth and I certainly have the technical capability I could even do it today although I no I don't have certain things plugged in um I see Stig in the chat I don't know if Stig was here when I did my entire long elaborate demonstration of the Danish train whistle but you can you can ask all your questions about the history and context of this train whistle to Stig who's in the chat um I see you true bolt Geometry Dash I thought that's coming on the Apple II plus but I do love that idea um so I really would like to be able to do both so the tricky thing is I don't have enough cameras so I have enough physical space now to have both the Apple II plus over there lights are somewhat easy for me to move because I have them on stands and wheels uh cameras I have to like move these cameras aren't sort of fixed tripods they're all plugged in HDMI cables are all set up everything going in this capture PC so it's a bit of a pain to move them so I have to decide do I want to get separate cameras just for the Apple II Plus or do I want to suffer through like uh today I'm gonna do Apple 2 plus let me just break down all the cameras set them back up record a video break it down put it back um so I that's what I'm trying to figure out but please I would love your feedback um if you haven't watched these I think you'll enjoy sort of a little taste of computing history and me reattempting to do some of my older coding challenges like the snake game over here on the right and the fractal tree over here on the left on the Apple II okay thanks for all these questions oh Assembly Language so a lot of people in the comments and I'll get to this when I get to the uh review of these Apple 2 plus videos ask about Assembly Language and I would like to do that and in fact bear with me I'm going to find them up here I have where is it where is it where is it where all my Apple II books um here's a few of them just I'm I'm I'm nearby you don't worry I haven't left uh dos manual ah yes here we go I have so one of the amazing things not just about having the Apple II Plus is that I have in addition and I'm going to move to here and come around and show this to you a little closer in addition to um having the computer itself I have all of the books and manuals and things that I had in the when I was you know 10 years old um uh in the early 80s so this is uh programming the 6502 so I thought I would do some re oh you can't see this at all um I would do some reading of this book uh sorry this is pathetic um uh and uh uh try to learn a bit more about it I know that Ben eater has a lot of videos on YouTube about Assembly Language and um working with building your own 6502 chip baby with modern microcontrollers uh don't quote me on that so this is definitely something that I would like to get into um I also love love love love love love we think of creative coding creative Computing as kind of this new term of today generative art processing P5 look here if you need to know the 6502 you may not be able to find a text easier to understand this one creative Computing I assume that's some magazine book newspaper Journal I don't know a newspaper the creative Computing a newsletter from the 1980s would love to find that out Isn't that cool okay um try turning off the green screen probably would have helped yeah so sorry about that um but I will I do sometimes use an overhead camera okay so let me um uh and but but the thing is like the question says most of the ones I'm able to find online are on a very basic beginner level that's certainly where I would start so I don't know if I'd be getting exactly what you're looking for but okay I'm going to answer that so you can still ask questions um you can still ask your questions at um onlinequestions.org uh you know I've answered these top four upvoted ones I might poke through and see if there's one that I find particularly interesting I will look at these also later I have it's kind of cool to see all these comments coming in um So and I've got it in my my uh peripheral vision over here so if I see a question rising to the top I will gladly answer it and try to do more towards the end of my agenda here okay so um I'm gonna let's come back to the coding Train website I've talked about it on uh quite a few uh streams recently um but I do want you to know that it's there and let's move on to the um main topic of today so I've bear with me for a second um I don't know what music okay so first of all if you like the coding trade like even more I might say the new it's not it's not as new it's not as new and shiny as the coding Train website because it's bit it's been it was launched quite a a fair amount of time ago now but also who created and designed by Design Systems International wonderful design uh then put the music a little less loud okay uh I will I will fix that next time the event number Hassan is um three one four one five nine uh it's in the pinned message in the chat okay so this is processing the new processing website um we are going to live this is processing four but um this is over here this icon over here this is the probably one of the Alphas or betas that I downloaded quite some time ago um I'm gonna go over here there is a new official processing for release uh 4.0.1 uh stable release um I sadly have to download the Intel 64bit but one of the things in my notes Here is that the new if you you know first of all if you're on Windows great if you're on older Mac great but uh if you happen to have one of these newfangled silicon Max M1 M2 M2 Max whatever those things might be um make sure you get the Apple silicon version uh it is a lot of work that Ben Frye did and other contributors I'm sure went into optimizing and getting processing for to work super fast and awesome on um uh silicon chip okay so let's download this we're going to take a look at it and look at some of the new features some of the new uh some new functions you can call in it I've got a whole list of stuff here to look at and uh as I will uh um take your wish so so Alka asks official release yeah yeah I mean I don't know what counts as an official release but this is an official release it's 4.0 out of beta 4.0.1 I really can't believe you can't hear that rain it's so loud all right so let's open this up uh let's just whatever version this was let's dispose of it let's bring this version over here and let's give it a run and one of the things that's really wonderful about it which I hope shows up uh is um yes I want to open it is a new welcome screen yes this is so cool so take a look at this beauty um when you first start processing four you get this wonderful welcome screen which shows you a few examples you could try uh tells you how to find more examples we could go to this is going to be an important link for us uh what has changed let's go ahead and open that up because we're going to come back to this and kind of go through it um and you know you also might be if you want more detail about this I would highly recommend you check out the revisions which is like the many many notes of all of the things I mean I just you know just I'm just going to scroll this for a little bit you may not realize how much work goes into these projects we could do the same thing with P5 pick your poison pick your favorite open source uh project made with love you know tremendous amount of time and energy goes in and one of the things I especially appreciate about this page is the thorough detailed level of documentation this page is not for everyone you might not want to get lost in this certainly if you're a beginner today's like today's the day I'm going to learn to code I'm going to download processing and try it for the first time you don't really need to look at this page you might come back to it later but certainly if you're if you've used processing before and familiar with processing three or two then this page which is a bit shorter more of a summary is absolutely something you're going to want to take a look at okay um so what was I where was I uh changes uh processing four okay so we were looking at this wonderful page uh then okay we've got to look at this awesome thing be sure to visit tools theme selector to choose your own color scheme for the environment uh you could also select an alternate sketch naming method so processing will always autoname your sketches obviously you can name them whatever you want but you can also adjust the auto naming algorithm it seems so let's I'm going to keep this show this message because I like it so much I want to see it next time but you don't have to keep that you could uncheck that um I'm curious what happens if I click on one of these examples yeah it opens it up in processing that's so cool so we could look at this message this is a nice very beginner friendly message if it's your first day coding um there's going to be a lot in this message that you might not understand but you can also this is something that you would be could sort of interesting I think one of the things I don't I don't do this enough but I know I remember a Kyle McDonald once did a workshop like this which was like for total beginners or never coded before it was like here's a code project let's just look at it and try to see what we can understand what we don't understand and without understanding it or knowing it can we change stuff and so that can be kind of fun like if I didn't know how to code maybe I would just like oh what happens if I change that number to 800 and I run it again oh whoa okay the size of the window changed so this is the kind of thing you should uh freely do whether you're a new coder or an experienced coder always fun to just play around and change stuff in a certain level you'll get lost or the things you want to understand you might want to double back and review Concepts in a more methodical stepbystep way but those two ways of working are not mutually exclusive okay so let's also let me close this out um let's look at and I'm going to close the welcome screen let's look at them just look at the time it's 10 45. uh I'm gonna be here my hope would be to be this would be about a 90minute stream with no break but I you know I could might be here until about um noon mblab says can they add auto complete there is autocomplete um I don't there's I think it's a preference and there might be some tricky ways to get it enabled it's not just there automatically I can try to look into that for you um or you come into the coding train Discord but yes there is autocomplete in processing so let's go to oh not the preferences let's go to tools um theme selector there we go so you can read about how to create your own theme and you can save a theme.text txt file for editing themes but I'm just going to go and click through them and I really like the purple one I don't know what looks best it's kind of a dark mode I think maybe one of the lighter ones is maybe better for video it's kind of nice this is how I feel I feel like I've ah feel this one this one has me in my feels uh you know this is this could be a good one for a certain day you know and they're also minerals what Alloys whoa oh these are the gradient themes wild so here there are minerals which are solid colors and Alloys which are gradient themes I hear somebody talking but it must be my wife um okay uh all right let's let's do this one this is very bright and cheery um I like it the line numbers are very hard to see with the themes that is a very good note um certainly I know that for accessibility web content accessibility guidelines uh color contrast is really a key uh thing to always consider for user experience design and accessibility when you're building a website and I think this is a a good note here to maybe uh I don't know where you could file this as an issue or bring it up on the processing Forum I'm trying to take a mental note of it right now that I don't have a good system of tracking everything while I'm streaming um you can tweet at me to remind me but yes I do see that that on some of these themes in particular this one the line numbers are a bit light and hard to see thank you for that comment my shirt is inside out my undershirt is inside out I don't think so you really know how to get me right how to how to push my buttons and make a comment about my appearance live on live streaming and I'm very very okay so let's keep going here um and look at some more things so I mentioned oh so so this is using also uh a lot of work going into updating the version of java and so um from what I understand and I haven't rigorously tested this if you get processing four you're gonna see many many performance boosts um I really want to look at this window ratio method so there's a new window ratio method let's see if I can find it in the reference window ratio so it doesn't appear that it's in the reference yet that's another note uh um to uh I got it if you want me to want me to stop looking at the chat keep making comments about my shirt being inside out um this is another note for the processing Community the processing docs GitHub perhaps maybe we need to have the window ratio function uh documented but let's just give it a try forget how it works let's go look at here window ratio a command that helps automatically resize your sketches whenever the window size changes you can read about it in the release notes for beta 7 ah but a reference page is coming soon so this is known known that the reference page isn't there yet um let's read about it in the notes so let's look for window ratio ah okay so added a new window ratio method function that remaps screen and mouse coordinates to the specified aspect ratio for instance use window ratio whether using full screen or set resizable the sketch will scale its coordinates and the coordinates of your mouse oh this is freaking me out what the oh and then there's like new variables are with r height contain the width and height that we're past a window ratio row it could be used what okay whoa I don't understand okay let's figure this out right well let's just take let's just use this sketch I'm going to do it use a smaller window to start just because I don't have a lot of screen space here let's run the sketch and see what happens so I have a resizable window oh my God this is insane this is insanity that is wild it's like responsive design built into processing it's showing me okay well I'm I'm like confused I'm gonna have to rebuild this a little bit on my own so first of all I guess if I wanted it to start at the size that is the ratio I should still add the size function that makes sense um I'm gonna just take out this I'm going to comment this out here for a second because what I want to understand is is the stroke weight okay hold on so let's just let's try something for a second I'm going to draw a circle at width divided by 2 height divided by two um 100 100. so this oh 100. and I'm going to say fill 0 um okay so this would put a circle in the middle but now if I were to do that oh so something weird happens that's off when I resize the window which makes sense that it would be off because I think the idea here now is if I use r with and R height those values are going to change yeah look at that and the side okay the size is changing relative to the size of the window what if I take this out I'm so confused okay this is just like ah so our width and our height don't don't even work and if I were to do this okay so what I'm expecting to see yeah okay I get it now so this works like width and height always update but the thing that's happening now when I use the window ratio is notice how and I use r with and R height notice how the size of the circle the size of the circle is currently 1 8 of the width and it looks like it is staying that now what if I just adjust the height same thing it's basically figuring out how to adjust the size so the appearance of the sketch doesn't change regardless of the scale of the window um yeah time to change that and add R everywhere in my old processing projects let's take a look at this page again to see can be used in place of width height our Mouse X and R Mouse y contain the mouse positions scaled by the current ratio fat so if your window is taller or wider than the specified ratio your sketch will be moved using translate to fit the space and our Mouse X and our Mouse y might even have negative the exact amount of space that's extra can be found in ratio left and ratio top and the current scale being used compounding ratio scale yeah got it got it got it got it there's a lot more to this and I I almost like I almost can't wrap my brain around it because I'm so used to you thinking about processing and it's sort of fixed window size but I think the real power here for me would be in using full screen because we won't I won't easily be able to demonstrate this but if I'm saying full screen um what this is going to allow me to do is design something did it just letterbox it oh no I think design something to appear full screen but if I'm on a different machine with a different screen resolution ratio it'll still if I'm using all these variables correctly it'll still have the exact same appearance without me having to adjust my code I think that's the idea uh glad to know my shirt is acceptable okay uh great what else do I so I looked at that okay now I want to look at um there's pde X and p d e z files which allowing you to bundle sketches and contributions into double clickable things okay this is gonna have to parse out I should have by the way I had I have this list thank you to Benton Frye who sent me a lot of these things but I honestly like I haven't really taken it done a deep dive in a lot of these so I'm looking at these for the first time so apologies for not fully knowing where I'm going or I'm looking at or how this stuff works so let's take a look at this pdex and pde Z so let's go back to these changes and see so ah let's actually just go through here um not fond of the default sketch blah blah blah blah blah naming system you can also select an alternate naming scheme in the preferences window it's possible to create your own word list so let's look at that oops ah look at this oh ah look so you can create a different naming scheme like culinary arts oh my God this is so cool I'm gonna hit OK and now I'm gonna make a new sketch I get a dissolved croissant or a red hot cider or dried strips of Curry an infusion of fresh Panini amazing now let's try to figure out where is it doing it and how would I oh I've got a project for you I want to make my own work uh naming scheme so how does that work whoops um so where uh make your own word list for generating sketch name I wonder if it uses something like a contextfree grammar um that would be a way to do it hello Argentina in the chat um let's see so where I think that if I go here often if we go to could it be in the Sketchbook folder like I've got a lot of stuff in my Sketchbook so tools modes templates no theme theme there's some theme files there where are here I bet you it's here aha because there's I wonder if adding that's my recent so there's some important files here which are like the actual preferences I wonder where console I wonder where let's look um let's see if there's more um information about it I really want to find this out um sketch naming naming uh oh this is sorry hold on uh detailed information okay uh okay we've replaced underscores new sketch naming schemes can a friendly name of schemes create a file naming.json in your Sketchbook folder that follows the same layout in the processing download provide a name a list of prefixes and a list of suffixes just like that okay so where are those same layout in the processing download so on the Mac it's like the an application it looks like it's one thing I don't know if you know this but it's actually like a bundle of a lot of files so I wonder if I would find one in here somewhere uh Road revisions tools so I might have to like look into this a bit more to find ah there we go look at this I found it so let's open with a visual studio code aha so we can see okay come on come back we can see how this works now that um the friendly name it comes from glitch.com friendly words prefixes I wonder if I skipped over something can I oh my God the rain is so loud can I condense this yeah suffixes yeah and culinary arts is prefixes come on close there we go suffixes yeah Cosmos previous so yeah so now I see um now I see how this is done so we could make our own let's just try it let's do a coding train one so if I do this um let's make a new file I'm going to call it naming.json I'm going to put it in my uh processing sketch folder um well I didn't mean to uh let's call it uh coding train sorry there's got to be a better way for me to do this but I can't think of it right now all right this is fine I'm too stubborn okay so we're gonna get uh an array with name notes and prefixes wow the rain is insane if water starts coming through the ceiling we'll know why um and uh suffixes whoops so prefixes could be chew oh it has to be in Shiny Happy suffixes could be uh chew rainbow unicorn vegan cupcake I don't know what am I doing here what's become of me oh this is from coding train live stream uh coding train all right so I've made this file now this is the most important thing I'm going to do today I'm going to close this out uh I'm assuming that it doesn't Auto populate here so let's let's see if I go out of the preferences doesn't show up let's try quitting processing opening it up again this dot would have been good I don't know why I didn't think of that uh and now I've got a farm fresh bag of almonds and now I see cutting train chew vegan cupcake two unicorn shiny vegan cupcake happy vegan cupcake happy unicorn I want to get choo choo one of these days we're gonna get choo choo okay I know the music's kind of loud it's not loud for me now it is turn it down for you guys all right all right uh what else new processing stuff do we want to look at okay we've gotten through um oh okay so we've gotten through the naming convention naming system oh I haven't been looking at the um uh okay there I see a couple comments in the um in the uh in the coding training Discord okay new movie maker tool that can create animated gifs as well as high resolution lossless MPEG videos all right this we have to try now let's interestingly enough let's go to the coding Train website let's go to challenges I think I had one on like making gift loops okay so you can see I really need to work on the metadata stuff here would love help with this uh so let's go back here um whoops come on also not all the challenges have been ported so that also might be this might be one that hasn't been ported yet let's go to the next page Cube Wave by bees and bombs yeah let's try this so let's look at this uh code oh this is the oops so by the way if you're on the coding Train website and you're looking for the code if you click on this it's typically going to open by default in p5.js to go to the web editor but over here you can see this processing icon this should take me to directly to the processing code and huge shout out to dipom sen who has done a ton of work organizing this code and doing a lot of the content porting um so let me grab this code bring it into the new processing let's close all these windows that I opened unnecessarily why won't they close you know I shouldn't trust my computer my computer is kind of a disaster this 2019 MacBook I really need to upgrade it those new those new M2 matte apples they're not they don't come cheap um okay so crushed sweet potato let's paste this code in let's run it see if it works great so there is oh lovely so I think uh there's a bunch of flaws in my code example versus the original this is a this is one of my coding challenges where I attempted to recreate a very wellknown GIF from the artist bees and bombs who you should follow on Twitter or Tumblr or Instagram or wherever you can find all these amazing gifts mine looks like it's upside down perhaps or doesn't have as much as sort of thoughtful visual design in terms of the quality of the graphics and lighting and all of that but this will do for our purposes tools Movie Maker so how does this work oh I see compression ah I see so the movie maker I remember this now the movie maker doesn't directly render a movie so to speak or um from your sketch but if I were to include save frame and I'm going to do a folder called output and I'll do render Dash pound pound Pound these hash symbols indicate to processing that it should number the files up to four places and I'm gonna say I don't know dot PNG and what I would like to do with this code I haven't been thoughtful about oh we can see the original GIF here let's take a look at it but one thing I would love is for the it might not be possible for the text editor to somehow allow clickable links in it uh to recognize a URL in comments but Cube wave it's waiting to load there it is ah so you can see this is this is a much a nicer version of this but mine will do so my guess is just I I could certainly look at thinking about the variables so such that um how would I match the beginning to the end but let's just try to guess the angle starts at zero there's also m a no and angle minus equal negative one so I'm assuming that if the angle is less than negative 2 pi that would be one full cycle of this wave that's just now I haven't evaluated the math to know that this is really true whoops let's do uh B B's and bombs too um so let's see what this does um I'm going to say otherwise exit so I'm going to as long as the angle is less than negative 2 pi no greater than because the numbers are negative going down so my limit is negative 2 pi so while I'm greater than negative 2 pi keep saving the images and then once I get past uh quit exit so let's see what happens oh look how fast so wow that was remarkably fast so how many images did I get so now we can see we have this output folder with all of these images now the first one does it match the last one that would be the question yeah I don't know if I've gone through a full cycle of the wave but they certainly match so now I should be able to go to tools Movie Maker I want to do same size as Originals because I want to generate my GIF to be the same size as the sketch um then I'm going to just oh I called it the French for output it's fine my typo aside I'm going to drag that into here and then I want to create a animated gif Loop and let's hit create uh and I want to save it let's just save it to the desktop uh bees chew I don't know uh save uh did it do it was it just that fast because usually it shows I've done this before with like thousands and thousands of images and it shows me a progress bar let's see if uh on the desktop we do we have this I think I did it is it a perfect looping GIF I'm not entirely sure because I might have missed one frame on one side or the other I wasn't there's a more thoughtful ways of doing this and I do have a set of videos that I build off of golong leavens examples for this like GIF Loop uh coding train yeah so you'll see that I have some videos about making a gif Loop and making a purling noise Loop a hard curve GIF Lube so there's a bunch of these that you could find if you want to like go do a deeper dive into this but what I don't address in these videos is the fact that you can have processing render the GIF because that's a new feature so yes so what this is using from what I understand so uh Greg in the chat is recommending image magic which is a nice command line tool that you can use to create gifts with a lot of different parameters or render images adjust images I've used it there's also ffmpeg which I use quite a bit and I believe that this movie maker tool is just a user interface in front of f it might be using some other things too I didn't develop this I'd have to look at it uh you know we can look at the processing source code or you could ask a question on the Forum but my understanding is that this is using ffmpeg behind the scenes okay I'm gonna move on oh it's 11 12. I gotta move on from this I'm obviously doing a very long dive into all these new features so we talked about this apple silicon is supported sketch folder restrictions have been relaxed making it easier to use Version Control yeah this has been a big thing so I don't know if you've ever noticed um um that and I I know I spelled bees and bombs wrong but one of the things that has been trickied about working with processing is that you can um you all let me sorry let me go here to ask columns typically with processing sketches the pde file which is your source code file has to have the same exact name as the folder um and then if you have this like stray pde file like if you try to open it it's like oh I've got to make a folder with that name and things can get messy and confusing I want to move on from this so I'm and I don't have the full awareness of all the changes here but I believe and if somebody in the chat knows um um there's somebody in the chat knows please um chime in you can ask um by the way Raphael who does the wonderful creative coding news twitch streams is the new processing Community lead so that's tweet at Raphael if you ask all these questions to Raphael um but um I believe the pdex and pdez are mechanisms for different file extensions for having your processing sketches and not and being able to like move them around in more flexible ways with more flexible file naming and my suspicion is if I go back to here oh yeah uh we could look um yeah um I want to I I'm I'm noticing how long I'm so I'm gonna look into this a little bit more and come back to it um but so um but the but know that that's there for you and it's pretty exciting okay uh many many changes made to Future proof the software Java 17 um hundreds of bug fixes and usability updates um all the Gory details in this revision document let me look at the note uh there's new Raspberry Pi support so um if it's not something I could demonstrate right now not something I spend time with but if you are interested in doing development on the Raspberry Pi take a look at processing again it's been revamped from what I understand being able to rename the main tab so that Version Control doesn't break when you rename a sketch that's one of the ones gradient themes let me look here multiple ways to name sketches okay I'm going to read you um this is direct from Ben Frye there are a few options for these found in the preferences window oh yeah no this is multiple ways personalizing the environment okay I showed this already uh new welcome screen a lot of Plumbing work oh preferences and Export to application dialog boxes have changed quite a bit so let's look at um let me uh I'm gonna just comment this out let's look at the export to application feature so this is great if you're not aware of this this is such a wonderful wonderful thing for those of you who work on um sort of kiosk like installations whether for a museum exhibit an art installation a project that you want running in the lobby of a building the ability to export a standalone application that can boot up with a machine from processing is huge it's much harder to do that kind of thing with like a browserbased environment because like okay we've got to like write this script for the browser to open the browser has to go full screen it could be a bit of a mess so um what's important is this sort of question um is and I guess this is only relevant for uh what I'm using right now Intel 64bit Mac but um if you embed Java processing still runs on Java so the application if it doesn't have Java with it it's going to expect the machine to have Java which in most cases it will but this is a way of including it so it sort of guarantees the experience of running it is identical to your running it there's also this really sort of messy thing on Macs about signed applications so to make sure that they're not that they're that they can be run that they're not coming from an unidentified developer let's see how this goes for me right now sort of dramatic uh you know we can we could do like a um dramatic uh um pause here so I want to do Mac OS Intel 16 for a bit export and I now have this application right here and I believe you can customize the icon there's a way of doing that I mean you obviously could do that on your own so let's see what happens now like I'm just gonna drag this over to the desktop so you see this is totally like a standalone application now I'm gonna it's over here I'm gonna double click it oh let's try this oh I got something I got something for you oh this is so cool okay let's try this now now let's put it all together we're gonna wrap everything up with a beautiful bow okay we're gonna say window ratio 400 400 uh uh full screen yeah full screen p3d I think what this will do well first let's just try running it oh I'm not using r with okay hold on am I using with ah r with R height our height our width now obviously I could do a find and replace but that's not me I'm not a I'm like a tedious meditation coding person let's try this this is very exciting oh whoa okay uh hmm let's try what did I do um I probably missed something okay what did I miss and where do these uh see all right w I have to investigate this later I suppose because I was getting so big oh hold on hold on oh this probably I have a feeling that this is okay maybe this needs to be oh maybe the way that I've sort of figured this out all of these things need to be tied to the width and height as well that's probably what it is so I need to this is my fault for not coding this thoughtfully the ortho uh shouldn't the aspect ratio match with ortho probably right it should yes right okay that makes sense but maybe let's just try this and then uh how do I do window resizable is that the function so let's see what happens when I do this yeah oh I see I don't want to I want actually this is not the behavior I want it's doing it correctly it's trying to adjust it to uh the size but really what I just want I always want to I I mean who knows why I'm doing this so the thing that in my head that I just created in my head was like I want to see it nicely fixed as a square in the center but that's not actually what this ratio stuff is meant to do it's doing exactly what it's meant to do which is making it look kind of weird as I resize it but that's kind of cool like so let's just take this out again and let's go back to I'm just curious let's look at the difference uh I'll do find replace here let's look at what happens without that are with our height stuff yeah look it totally whoa it is kind of cool but some weird stuff is definitely happening and then if I wanted it to not I could have these be right I could fix another way of thinking about this would be to actually have all these fixed at 400 no matter what I do and then this could be r with an R height I think this is kind of I don't know if this is the right way to do this but interesting but I'll have to think oh no because it's still um oh this would be I'm gonna get this I want aspect ratio oh there's an ass yeah there's an aspect ratio anyway you you work this out you can see how I can't figure this out right now because my brain cannot my brain it's like when I was programming when I first used processing we're talking almost 20 years ago now 19 really if I'm being more precise I'm coming up on 20 years though I would say summer of 2003 so when I first used processing no I I this wasn't even called draw when I use processing this is called Loop so how's my brain supposed to understand how to resize a window in your aspect ratio that's for you young coders out there to do okay did you get the idea it's really cool that I can export the application run it full screen that's what I was trying to show you um all right so uh what else what else what else um welcome screen uh multiple platforms I think I've covered just about everything um about processing four so um there we go okay I've got a few other things on my agenda here I'm going to be wrapping up in the next 10 to 30 minutes so if you're um and and one thing that I would really like to do with these live streams especially now that I've covered this stuff and somebody hey I would uh if somebody wants to help me with this fantastic but I want to make sure that after this stream ends that I put time codes in the description so people can find the different parts where I'm looking at these different processing four features um you know one of the things you know that you might notice is that the coding Train website has a tremendous amount of metadata and a full uh hopefully nice way of archiving and organizing all of the sort of Standalone project videos otherwise known as challenges as well as all of the sequence tutorials otherwise known as tracks but there is no uh bar here for live streams now I would very much like to add live stream archive but the reason why I haven't done that is because I don't have the time or capacity and I haven't um and people I I have people who help and work on who are paid to work on coding train there are volunteers who help with coding train um I I that hasn't been something that we've been able to make time and space for but I really would like for the live streams to be archived in a way that they're more searchable time coded because there are uh you know good luck to you if you're trying to find something that happened for like 20 minutes on a given live stream that's like an important nugget of information it's just probably called on YouTube live stream archive and it's three hours long without time codes so if anyone is interested Step One is like let's try doing it for this live stream today but if anyone's interested in helping with that add it to the list of things that I would like to do eventually for the coding trade okay tracks meme tutorials okay Andrew has the great so fall plan is on my list here so uh Raj and Andrew are asking about what challenges are planned um what um how often you're gonna live stream um I'm noticing Simon is not here which is unusual so I'm gonna have to check in and say hi to Simon hope Simon's doing well um uh Sky Grizzly is asking a great question about the Apple 2 plus um so I'm running out of steam a little bit my the engine is getting quite tired but let me fall plan is on my list so let me move through a bit more quickly here so first of all let's check I'm going to check um online questions um there are yeah did I know that this service has no spamming protection I do know that so I'm relying on the kindness of strangers here um where is the name so there are a few questions that have been upvoted um I will come back to those at the end so just so you know um you can go to onlinequestions.org and type in the code uh 314159 uh into the little box there you can upvote questions or ask your own I'll try to do a couple more um at the end um okay Apple II Plus so as I mentioned you can see my recent two videos have been about coding on the Apple II plus I'm planning to do the next one where I'm going to look at building a simple 3D renderer on the Apple II plus so how can the first one I did just text and I made a little snake game with characters moving around the screen then I looked at Graphics drew a fractal tree next I'm going to continue with Graphics but look at 3D rendering that's the plan although I currently don't have a camera set up for it so who knows when I will get to it so I did want to go through and look at some of the interesting stories and comments that people posted here um I think I might not have enough time for that today so what I'm going to do is look at the Showcase so let's go look at the passenger showcase for these but I would certainly encourage you um to take a look at the um the comments there are yeah so like let's just look at this one um 43 year old software engineer here and this is where it all started for me messing around with basic on the Apple 2E in my Elementary School library creating these little games stimulated my imagination as a kid and I can't imagine videos like yours wouldn't do the same for kids today this stuff is timeless thank you for the Nostalgia trip so um thank you for this I see Rusty here in the mid 1970s we got our first computer as my dad was a programmer it was immediately enthralled the game this game was the first program I wrote it was on a Radio Shack TRS 80. so you know I don't know how far down this Rabbit Hole of retro Computing I'll do there are a bunch of YouTube channels um Adrian's basement is one that people pointed me to which maybe is more about restoring the machines than programming on them but um it's been really wonderful uh and thank you practical engineering wonderful YouTube channel to read people's stories about how what kind of uh programming they did on Old Computers in the 70s and 80s I also love hearing from people who are you know born in the century for example and we're like wow I didn't know what programming looked like on these older computers um basic is a bit of um I mean it's certainly something that was widely used but it's a environment that I might say was more for recreational or educational programming but it really fits with what I do I mean I think there is a line that you could draw from basic to processing um whereas you know Punch Cards and Assembly Language and Fortran these are things that I could also get into at some point but that does some people didn't notice that in the comments of people talking about that um okay so I would encourage you if you haven't had a chance to check these out um you can see there's some fun little things in there um uh people uh you know I talk about I was able to screen capture with analog video into HDMI so I'm not going to go through these but what I would like to do is go to the code and Train website and I'm going to go to challenges and you can see here the most two two reasons so first thing I have to chastise you the coding train viewership grab some real talk here people I'm not doing this just to code myself I want to see your successes and failures and where you got stuck and what you tried um so uh so far there are no passenger showcase for no passenger showcases submitted for this particular um video so I want to encourage anybody I don't know what your plans are for today for tomorrow this weekend you know be with friends and family uh make sure you're you're sleeping well you're taking care of your mental and physical health spend some time outside if you can but you know if you're at the computer programming I would love to see some of your work related to this particular video now moving on to the next challenge is there a way for me to go from this page to the next one I think there is and this should really uh um I think oh no we haven't merged that pull request yet so many things I want to talk about um let's go to um back to challenges whoops back to challenges I can do this Apple II and you can see I've got the two so that metadata made it in there I'm gonna click on this one and now we can see I have quite a few wonderful uh passenger showcase projects so I want to take a look at these um coming soon oh look there's a lot of them wow coming soon so I'm going to click through these kind of quickly um because I want to look at all of them coming soon is a way that these will appear in random Order each time um and if by the way if you're wondering how do you submit yours um up here on so first of all there should be a link to it ah submit a contribution it's right here so if you click on this link it'll take you to a new page which has a submission form with information but you can also do it uh through a GitHub pull request so I encourage you to try that the form creates a pull request so regardless you're getting your first pull request made which is going to be really exciting for people that's that's my mission in life is for people to have for me to provide a welcoming positive experience for people to have their first pull request merged to an open source project foreign so I highly encourage you to do this um Raj the thumbnail is something you have to submit so as we've been porting a showcase projects over from the previous website uh Kathy and depam and many other people have been making all these screenshots because we didn't have them originally but now it's up to you to take a screenshot and submit it with your um if you don't submit one it'll it'll just use the thumbnail of the video I think or the screenshot of the the code example associated with the video um so ah so uh I forgot what I was going to say um oh so let's take a look at these so let me actually just go and click on all of them and go through them oh this is gonna cause a problem for me but it's fine Okay so now first is oops looks like it's behind it now this is a little unusual because usually what I would do most passenger showcase projects are to what I usually ask people to submit is well if it's a piece if it's a website it runs online it's the P5 sketch linked to the code editor maybe if you made it in processing maybe you recorded a screen capture it's nice to have like something that I can quickly visually and see but with this it's kind of unrealistic to do that but what I can do very nicely is I can grab the code um and I'm going to go there's a few different emulators I'm gonna actually go to this one and I can just paste the code in here and run it so let's have a look and let's try playing it so one this has obviously been uh switch to Graphics mode mine was just using text and that's really cool to see low resolution Graphics mode and maybe also a nice end screen we can see game over right there so that's wonderful thank you Heinrich and we can see I love that there are nice uh comments and things here uh with with REM being a way to do a comment not the band REM for a remark okay thank you now we've got Julian's um base Apple uh basic okay so let's do this and I think I might have just closed this let's go here let's paste this one in and run it so this also looks this looks like it's doing text but oh it's very fast but just different characters that maybe make more sense game over a game over screen so one of the things by the way um so if I wanted to try these on the Apple II plus I would have to sit and type the whole thing out so copy paste um uh and uh one of the things that you don't realize or that you do if you did this kind of work is and you look at any of these books you would get um magazines in the mail that had cool basic programs that were on pages and pages and pages and you could sit there and just like retype them into your computer and it was a really exciting thing to do to take all that time to retype them and finally run it and realize you missed something I have to look through and find the typo oh those were the days okay thank you for this I'm gonna go backwards now uh ooh so this is a place to hold some code for a snake game in Commodore 64 basic uh here's the basic code the question is I have to run this on a vice emulator you can drag this or attach it let's see convert I'm just curious by the way I'm sure it won't work I'm curious what happens if we try running this code on the Apple emulator yeah so unsupported poke location so if you watch the video you'll know that Peaks and pokes it's an old tiny command to look in the computer's memory or to add something update the computer's memory poke is poking at the memory changing it Peak is peaking it so I used it in the video for peeking at the place in memory that is keeping track of the last key pressed on the keyboard so obviously the Commodore 64 is going to have different memory addresses then so let's just see is there a JavaScript c64 emulator um let's see can I um oh I have to drop some so I don't have unfortunately just because for the interest of time I'm very sorry about this I am not able to I already lost that page um I am not able to figure out the Commodore 64 emulator right now live but I would love to do look at that so thank you for that submission I encourage those of you to investigate that more if you're interested okay so now we're looking at another one snake game gameplay video so that I could watch but where is the code um okay hold on that's the readme file so let's try running this one and let's go back to here this one is from whoops did I just close this one out who is this one from okay this was the uh Commodore 64 one right and this one is from unified data Corp thank you to unified data Corp let's try running this whoa okay this is wild press enter to begin so wait can I just do I get all these oh and it beeps that is so cool oh this is incredible and look at the like text here at the bottom like saying yummy oh I hit the wall oh no press enter to start a new game this is amazing look at all this code look at all this code got some nice comments Go Subs delays welcome screen a poke I wonder what this poke is I actually have the poster over here still four six one eight um here I'll take I'll show you this is um pull it off the wall for a second this is my um so it's gonna get keyed out a little bit but this is the Peaks and post poster it actually has some really fun stuff on the back uh I guess I'd have to turn the green screen on or show it to you on the Whiteboard view but I wonder if we can figure out 49162 49162 four nine two four nine one five two four nine one six eight oh four nine one six eight clears the keyboard so the Poke of 49168 is clearing the keyboard so that way if you're using a key that somebody pressed and you don't want that if statement to execute again you would then poke to clear it okay that's wonderful thank you okay I gotta put this back on my wall this is a very very precious thing of mine I don't want to lose it okay um all right thank you for this this is totally awesome um by the way if anybody is in the chat who made one of these um I would love to please say hi uh now we've got the great the amazing Sebastian lag who uh created their own version of it um and let's take a look at their code um look at this really nice commenting going on here we're gonna ah I'm always closing the window now let's uh run this well look at that startup screen ah whoa this is going very fast oh my God so interestingly enough the speed going horizontally is so much faster than vertically because the size of the pixel is not a uniform Square it's interesting be interesting to try to account for that in the code I'm sorry it's sort of like hard to not stop playing these let's see what happens if I get to the end oh I guess there is no I'm not long enough to hit myself and it's got wrap around so let's see let's see if I can I'm just curious if there's a okay well you get the idea amazing work Sebastian lag I love that you did this I look forward to like long thoughtful video essay about programming on the um Apple II plus okay so that's Sebastian lags we've got uh Michael Kemps uh snake let's take a look at this wait a second seed Peak 78 Peak 79 to create a random seed gotta look at my poster again Peak 78 78 random number field it's right here that's interesting I was not aware of that that's cool to see all right let's try uh running this one see what it looks like whoops oh okay hold on let's refresh this page and let's try running this whoa ah game over oh what are the keys uh arrows so these are using the arrows I'm looking at the chat here this is great let's look at let's see our game over screen game over yes great job thank you for sharing this so fantastic do we have any more did I get them all snake game with Graphics Julian's we did Michael Kemp Sebastian lag Daniel long we saw uh I don't remember seeing this one slightly more complete and faster did I miss this one oh I missed this one it was a paste bin site that's why I closed that let's uh how do I let's look at Raw let's try this one so I missed this one let's take a look so this is the most close to uh the the version that I actually do in the video um and one thing I'm curious about is um I was looking to see if it used a ring buffer so um one of the things that I didn't do is use this idea of thinking of the array so I I'm like in my modern Computing World thinking about an array as having you know five spots in or ten spots in it and if I want to remove something from the array and add something new maybe I shift everything over and add something to the end whereas on the Apple II this glooping through the array to shift all the elements is incredibly slow so it would make much more sense to think of the array as a circle and all I'm doing is changing where the beginning of the array is so rather than Shifting the elements over I shift where I start and that would be this idea of using a ring buffer which honestly is an efficient way of doing things regardless of whether I'm you know on a M2 Max computer or on um you know an old Apple II but I didn't think to do that while I was programming it certainly that would be something to do all right so thank you I want to really encourage all of you um if um to um to submit to the passenger showcase what will happen is um so when you go if you under guides um under the passenger showcase guide if you submit this form um you are not required to include your email but if you include your email and you have a GitHub account with that email then the Commit This will automatically make a commit and a pull request will be tied to your GitHub account otherwise it's just going to be tied to Choo chupot on an account that we have set up just as like a bot account on GitHub so fill out this form submit it you could also do it manually as a pull request and then what will happen is and I'm pretty sure in the footer of the website if we go here to um here and go to the codingtrain.com and I go to pull requests what you would see if I go to look at pull requests with the label showcase and look at closed you can see these are the five most recent so we can see that there are these snake applesauce basic showcase projects that I looked at and then also let's look at this Space Invaders one um so we can see that this is one that's already been merged it's going to show up on the Space Invaders challenge page let's go look at that just curious uh oh that's going to be hold on Space Invaders there we go and uh yeah you can see it right here oh no no right here this is there's a bunch of them it probably is the last one because they're not random right now there's a lot of them let's see sometimes they don't actually show up unless I clear rebuild the site clearing cache regardless um let's take a look at it here we can look at it here so thank you to Steve King uh here is the Space Invaders project tap canvas to start it's still loading so Lucifer says when is this there's no end to these you can submit them whenever um and I don't know if there's an error here if it's loading so I think there unfortunately was an error with this running so sorry for this little moment of fail here but I encourage you please submit your passenger showcase projects I want to see them I look at all of them and I'm trying to get better organized to look at them and the live streams as you can see okay what else is on my list so I talked about the Apple II plus talked about the Showcase talked about the website got a few more questions to answer so two other updates nature of code fall plans these are highly tied together so let me close a bunch of Windows here and I'm going to be out of here in five or ten minutes um all right so as you know you don't know this as you might know there is a book called the nature of code published in 2012. um you can read the entire book for free online right here this has largely been untouched since 2012. this is the original text it is all written uh for uh processing and has a lot of mistakes in it the neural networks chapter was written before anything that's happened in the last six months let alone nine years 10 years so what's happening with this if you go to GitHub nature of code you will see that there is a new repo called book website second edition this is the new repo where all of the and we're actually currently working on more documentation here where all of the uh content diagrams styling for the new second edition of the book is here and in fact it really should have a link right to the netlify preview right here in the readme I don't think that it does so I have to like remember this what is it called can I log into my netlify account hold on let me just uh see if I can log in here GitHub pretty sure if I log in with GitHub it'll work and nature of code um yeah so I'm gonna I'll show this to you no reason why you can't see it so I'm using netlify which thecodingtrain.com also uses to build the site uh from that repo there's a workflow that whenever updates are made the new site is built so I'm happy to share this URL if anyone wants to take a look this is the current version of the second edition you can see it is missing chapter five it is missing chapter 10 and it is missing chapter 11. but most of these chapters with some long a mediumsized list of things they are done and there is a second edition version of the chapter here with a little bit of a new design p5.js code and one of the things you'll see if I go to forces for example which is really exciting let's get to the first example oh okay maybe I need to go to vectors because I haven't done I haven't done this for most of the chapters yet yeah here we go the examples are running embedded here in the browser and then if I click here open in the P5 web editor so this is all in progress because they actually changed everything's changing uh this will actually fix it it would take me to the um the sketch in the P5 web editor so this is a lot of work is going into this um Jason who is a recent Alum the ITP program has been doing a ton of work building out this website this uh I didn't think this by the book goes anywhere because you can't yet so a this is here all I haven't been on YouTube as much because I'm doing a lot of work on this but the really so one check it out um there's not really an easy way for people to contribute or participate in this right now but you're welcome to look at the website look through the GitHub repo I welcome your GitHub issues ETC but the real work needs to happen right now which is that I need to get my act together and write the new physics libraries chapter which will be chapter five I'm going to use matter.js write update the neural network chapter to deal with neural networks in 2022 and write the new chapter chapter 11 which is going to touch on reinforcement learning and neuro evolution so I'm not sure yet but in terms of my fall plan I might have to take October off from YouTube streaming and video making in order to start writing these because I have not I've made space to work on editing to get the site going I mean I'm not doing a lot of this work but I'm kind of managing it and thinking about it and making lots of changes so I think that what I'm going I I have an absolute deadline in my mind of finishing the second edition by the end of December so what happens if I don't do any live streaming or recording videos in October do I get drafts of all three of those chapters done in October and I come back to YouTube in November or do I also need to take November off and then December off so I don't know what the future of this fall holds um but I do have I'm I there's still time in September so it's my intention to do another Apple II plus video I would really like to do the wave function collapse part two and now that there's processing four I want to create a new YouTube course on learning to code with the processing so uh our track so to speak so that's um that's the kind of thing that I can just do in one day like it'll take longer to put it all together with a little light editing and and organizing all the metadata but I'm hoping to take like a Saturday just get in here and like teach all the fundamentals of programming with processing over the course of a day so it'll be very little postproduction um involved with that and it'll just be up on YouTube as like an archived hopefully somewhat Evergreen video that people could use to learn to code I do have that right now for P5 and I do have a really old one for processing but that that one is 10 years old so I'd like to do it with processing four so that's the fall plan um um uh I I I uh yeah there's more to wave function collapse I don't know realistically what I'm gonna get to in the next couple weeks but that's um that's my fall plan I have a uh if you have questions or comments about that um please let me know uh um join the coding train Discord I would love to see you there um you can find it at thecodingtrain.com uh Slash Discord or there's links to the Discord there let's take a look at answering some of these last questions so I'm going to go to whoops I'm going to go to onlinequestions.org type in the event number and uh we see there's a few ques like let's see if I can get so yes I know this has no spam prediction so I'm going to answer that I I uh what I'm my spam production is I'm looking at it to my right I'm not showing it on the screen in case somebody posts something inappropriate but it probably takes something inappropriate a while to get upvoted so that's also a little bit of a protection here will you continue the Apple II tutorials yes the this the roadblock for me and I would love to hear from you about this you know on Twitter at schiffman at the coding train um I need to figure out how to have a nice setup where I can go back and forth between working on the Apple II and this setup that you're seeing right now with this view as well as the uh whiteboard view so um I'll be working on that and um but yes it's my intention to do at least one more Apple II video uh answered and have you seen any of the physical oh where's the name sorry there's two questions where is the name coding train where's the name coding train come from well sit back it's Story Time with Daniel shipping on the coding trade oh only a few minutes left I'll make this a short story um this channel used to be called coding rainbow that was a nice name it was an homage to the wonderful you know you can see that I have a little bit of an obsession with the 80s being the time of my youth um there was a wonderful television program called Reading Rainbow with the amazing incomparable iconic legendary LeVar Burton and I don't know I just I love the vibe of it and I thought what is it that I want to say about coding to the world I want to say it's a rainbow so I called the thing coding rainbow not thinking I was starting a YouTube channel or a brand um but I flew too close to the Sun if you will like Icarus I hit the rainbow dead on hit me in the head and the very kind lovely wonderful nice Folks at Reading Rainbow where we would appreciate if you didn't name your things so close to arthay so I had had to come up with a new name ask for people on social media what do you think and by golly we need like a wick if somebody make a Wikipedia page edit the Daniel shipping Wikipedia page let's find the person who suggested this um because I can never seem to pull it out of my brain but uh a very nice person suggested coding train and I thought that works for me I like trains has a friendly Vibe we can have a rainbow coming out of the train and honestly that's where the train to training to code I didn't really think of that at the time people have mentioned that in fact so that's that's where it came from if you want to learn more about coding rainbow probably shouldn't be showing this coding uh coding rainbow believe you will if you Google it you will find ah yeah this next web article from 2016 has uh this video which is unlisted on YouTube embedded into it which is a little funny uh theme song wow okay okay so you know please enjoy this you can find it uh and if you like coding train I haven't done one of these in a while uh um coding Train theme yeah here we go this one in 2017. is the updated a coding Train theme with all sorts of additional silly graphics and animations so please please enjoy these If you're sort of new and haven't seen these These are from years ago I guess my newest version of that is the coding together uh sitcom intro so that's where the name coding train came from uh that's my little story time to end today uh hopefully there'll be some new videos oh I have this other project I'm working on which is kind of related to the Apple II but I think I want to make a JavaScript web version on it but and then do it over on Twitch and I if I I got to do this soon I'm I'm making a version of the Oregon Trail the Oregon Trail uh my own code example I guess I could do it as a coding challenge I'm not sure but if you're interested in that old game uh you could probably play it on Apple 2 plus load it from a disk that's also a project it relates to this like podcast and I have a lot more to say about that but remind me about that I really got to get that done got to get started on that soon okay so um thank you wave Morpher thank you Alex thank you sarvagya um this is it this is the end of today's live stream um I've got exactly one minute left before I said I had to go uh Alka has all the assets for the old intro that's great uh your lies coding rainbow yeah exactly can you do fractals on the Apple too hello did you not see my latest video um yeah so you can so go watch my latest video on YouTube um um uh Gabriel so yeah uh preferred on YouTube over twitch yeah I I really struggle I I'm trying to like have my I dip my toe in all the different platforms this is probably very loud for you I made a coding train tick tock that has one video on it now you might be able to find it um I um I I I was curious to experiment with YouTube shorts a little bit so we'll see um but yes I hear you I hear I hear from the audience that at least I mean you're I hear from the audience that's watching right now no surprise here you're watching this stream on YouTube that you prefer the YouTube streams I use the twitch stream just to kind of like experiment with weird stuff that I but in the end like why am I doing that my YouTube streams aren't exactly like professional broadcasts they're really just weird experiments but this today like you notice I didn't code any projects I would like to have these live streams be more about interacting with the audience and answering questions and featuring your work is that less interesting to you would you prefer to just watch me code stuff during live streams I don't know but I certainly would um would uh welcome um cervic yeah I'm so glad I pronounced your name correctly one thing I'd love to see just as I leave let me know where you're from where are you watching this from I the international um um the the fact that the coding trade audience viewers are so so all over the world it's something that brings me tremendous happiness I want to visit all of you I want to go everywhere I want to take going to coding train World Tour probably when I retire that's what I'll do I don't want to have to work though I just want to like experience the beauty that is the world presenting giving toxic very stressful just invite me somewhere I will come but I don't have to give it North Carolina Journey Hershey Pennsylvania the Netherlands Germany Bangalore India Korea India Seattle Boston Norway oh I have an invitation in Norway I got a reply to that email from Oslo the Netherlands India coding train Meetup yeah we had one kind of at prostate Community today in Copenhagen oh that's the end of the song Oh I'll be appearing live in New York City on October 8th and we're in a very smart part of a Matt Parker show more on that later goodbye everyone I always forget that this stock this stock this stuff this is stop never forget this stuff I'm gonna do this this dot this dot this dot this Dot Song never forget the this Dot and I'm gonna say once again you're important foreign autotune and the internet will fix that for me bring it with me Cartesian coordinates it look forward to Cartesian coordinate song so this is random this is noise hurling noise that is in the core random algorithm the actual random algorithm itself those numbers aren't related at all you pick like I'm picking random numbers between zero and ten nine two seven six one nine four eight nine two one three I pick nine a lot apparently but with purling noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five six seven eight nine eight seven six well this is like pearly noise performance art nine two seven six one five four eight nine two one three I think nine one two one two three four three four five six five four well this is like thoroughly noise I might pick numbers like this two three four three four five six five four five seven five six seven five two three four three four five six five four five six seven five six seven five well this is like pearly noise performance art unicorns and rainbows and cupcakes what else is there yes kittens thank you very much kittens and rainbows and cupcakes notice that look what I get I'm really losing my mind okay let's do it kittens pictures thank you I feel just sort of like a nice feeling of relaxation everything's gonna be okay today dream is not broken it has not frozen this isn't this is a wonderful thing okay we're gonna do it I'm really getting to something I need my sound effect foreign that I will use continuously over and over again all sorts of text generation analysis things that I will use continuously over and over again first thing I need to do is yes okay we're gonna do it kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens and kittens kittens and kittens and kittens at dust and died yeah
